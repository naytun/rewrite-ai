Everyone was finally afraid.</p><p>Although spirit herbs were good, one had to be alive to enjoy them. Otherwise, everything would be in vain.</p><p>Many people wanted to retreat and leave this place to seek opportunities elsewhere.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>Suddenly, a group of people in blood-red robes surrounded them. They were all cold-blood Hall experts.</p><p>“What are you guys doing? Why are you blocking our way?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>“What are you doing? Since we let you come in with cold-blood Hall, you should at least do something and make a difference. Otherwise, what’s the point of you trash coming in? Go ahead and lead the way!”</p><p>A burly man said in a cold voice.</p><p>This man was in his forties, half a generation older than Lu Ming and the others. His qi and blood were surging, and his aura was extremely powerful. His cultivation was unfathomable. This time, he was the leader of the people from cold-blood Hall.</p><p>“What? You want us to explore the way for cold-blood Hall with our lives. No, I won’t agree to that!”</p><p>A man in his Prime refused.</p><p>There were formations in front of them. Wouldn’t they be courting death if they went to Scout the way for cold-blood Hall?</p><p>“You don’t agree? Then die!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The brawny man from cold-blood Hall took a step forward and suddenly appeared in front of the man. The man wanted to resist, but he was enveloped by a terrifying force and could not move.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The brawny man from cold-blood Hall stabbed his hand into the man’s chest like a knife. The man let out a shrill scream, and then, under everyone’s horrified eyes, his body shriveled up and turned into a dry corpse.</p><p>cold-blood Hall’s bloodthirsty technique!</p><p>Someone’s voice trembled and his face was filled with fear.</p><p>“Now, are you guys going in or not?”</p><p>The brawny man from cold-blood Hall looked at the crowd coldly.</p><p>Everyone’s face turned pale.</p><p>I knew it. I wouldn’t have a good ending if I followed cold-blood Hall. I shouldn’t have come in!</p><p>Someone sighed.</p><p>However, at this time, it was useless to say anything more. The group of people could only move forward.</p><p>“Brat, hurry up and go!”</p><p>Huang Kui was among the cold-blood Hall disciples and he had his eyes on Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming cast a nonchalant glance at Huang Kui but did not make a move. Instead, he walked forward with the others.</p><p>Xue Luo Zi stared at Lu Ming and sneered, his eyes cold.</p><p>hurry up! If you don’t leave, kill!</p><p>The brawny man shouted coldly. His name was Xue Feng, and he was the top master of the previous generation in cold-blood Hall.</p><p>Many people gritted their teeth and stepped forward.</p><p>Light flickered, and a large array appeared. In an instant, more than ten people were killed.</p><p>ah, it’s too dangerous. I’m just looking for death if I go up like this. I beg you, let me go!</p><p>Some of them were trembling in fear and begging for mercy.</p><p>“What is it called? Some people were not fine? If you keep shouting, I’ll kill you right now!”</p><p>Xue Feng said maliciously.</p><p>Sure enough, some people were fine. They didn’t encounter the formation even after moving forward for a hundred meters.</p><p>This area was not completely filled with formations. There were some gaps that could be used to move forward. However, one needed to observe with good eyesight, and not everyone could see it.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flickered and he continued to move forward for more than a hundred meters, but nothing happened.</p><p>“This kid’s luck is pretty good!”</p><p>Blood Luo Zi stared at Lu Ming with cold eyes.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had refused to give him the opportunity to enter the marrow cleansing pool. As a result, he harbored a grudge against Lu Ming and had been looking for an opportunity to kill him.</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze across the area and identified it carefully. With his eyesight, he could naturally tell which places were gaps and there were no arrays.</p><p>His figure flickered left and right mountains before he came to a small hill. There was a small purple tree growing here. It was only a meter tall and was like purple jade. Essence Qi filled the air and it was very extraordinary.</p><p>“Purple-gold tree!”</p><p>Lu Ming recognized the small tree. It was an upper eighth-grade spiritual herb. If it was nurtured well, it could even bear purple gold fruits and evolve into a ninth-grade spiritual herb.</p><p>Lu Ming dug out the purplish-gold tree and kept it. He would plant it in the mountain and river diagram when he had the time.</p><p>“Hey, kid, what are you doing? Who told you to keep the spirit herb? quickly throw it out and give it to us!”</p><p>Huang Kui had been staring at Lu Ming. When he saw that Lu Ming had put away the spirit herbs, he immediately shouted.</p><p>“Idiot!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast a glance at Huang Kui and said indifferently.</p><p>“You … What did you just say? Kid, you’re looking for death, you’re dead, you know, you’re dead!”</p><p>Huang Kui shouted angrily.</p><p>Xue Feng and the others also looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Oh? Come and kill me!”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips.</p><p>“You … If you have the ability, don’t come out!”</p><p>Huang Kui looked at Lu Ming ferociously, his face flushed red. However, he did not dare to step forward.</p><p>“You cowardly rat!”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips. His figure flashed and he went to another spiritual herb. Very soon, he had also kept the other spiritual herb.</p><p>“No, he knows the Dao of inscription and can see the gaps in the formation!”</p><p>Xue Luo Zi roared as he saw through the situation.</p><p>Lu Ming’s movements were as smooth as floating clouds and flowing water. He was so fast that it did not seem like he was trying his luck. Instead, he could see the gaps.</p><p>“Hahaha, this group of idiots!”</p><p>On his shoulder, dandan laughed heartily, her eyes shining. There were so many spirit herbs here that he was almost drooling.</p><p>During this period of time, dandan had eaten a large amount of spirit herbs. He felt that he was constantly recovering. He had already recovered a little and remembered many things. When he saw the spirit herbs at this time, his eyes simply shone.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Xue Luo Zi, Huang Kui, Xue Feng, and the others gritted their teeth, wishing they could kill Lu Ming.</p><p>Those who were lucky enough to survive the formation stopped moving. They did not need to fear cold-blood Hall people in the formation anyway.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed and at least seven to eight spiritual herbs entered his pocket.</p><p>“This group of trash, they really deserve to die, use the sealing crystal!”</p><p>Xue Feng’s killing intent flashed as a white crystal appeared in his hand.</p><p>“Senior brother Xue Feng, are we going to use the sealing crystal now?”</p><p>Xue Luo Zi and the others felt their hearts ache.</p><p>In order for their disciples to enter the secret realm of the Saint mansion and obtain opportunities, the major forces had prepared many secret treasures.</p><p>The sealing crystal was an extremely rare treasure. Once it was used, it could freeze a formation, making it unable to explode.</p><p>It was the most practical way to explore some secret realms.</p><p>“Yes, that mountain is no small matter. There should be a great treasure inside!”</p><p>Xue Feng clenched his teeth and then squeezed the crystal.</p><p>Instantly, the sealing crystal shattered and turned into a layer of white light that rushed forward.</p><p>Wherever the white light passed, it was as if a layer of white frost had been laid on the ground. All the large arrays were frozen.</p><p>“It’s the sealing crystal, the formation is sealed, let’s charge!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Those who were forced by cold-blood Hall rose into the air and rushed into the depths of the mountain.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The cold-blood Hall people shouted coldly and chased after the people from the small forces.</p><p>A terrifying battle broke out in this area.</p><p>“Brat, die!”</p><p>Huang Kui was the first to charge at Lu Ming. His blood-red Claw radiance was aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>The claw ray was as sharp as a knife, aimed at Lu Ming’s heart. It wanted to devour Lu Ming’s blood and suck him dry.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming moved and slapped him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
