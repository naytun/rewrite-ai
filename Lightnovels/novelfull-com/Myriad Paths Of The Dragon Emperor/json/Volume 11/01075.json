The underground cave emitted a terrifying vibration.</p><p>The rock of this underground cave was extremely hard, probably because it had been inhabited by powerful fierce beasts all year round. If it was an ordinary cave, it would have exploded immediately. Even so, the entire underground cave was shaking violently.</p><p>Bang! Bang …</p><p>After the first move, Lu Ming’s body trembled and he took a few steps back.</p><p>he’s so strong. This monk’s strength is actually so terrifying? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely shocked.</p><p>At this moment, he had already unleashed his dragon power, but he was still forced back by his opponent. The power of that Golden Palm print was astonishing, as if it could suppress everything. It was a direct counter to the prison suppressing heavenly art.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. The unscrupulous monk was also surprised. He did not expect Lu Ming to be able to take his palm without being injured.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>The shaking here attracted the attention of the beasts on the other side. They roared loudly. Clearly, some beasts were rushing over here.</p><p>I’m a little kid. Benefactor, you’re very powerful. I’ll give this purple flame crystal to you then. Goodbye!</p><p>The monk chanted the name of Buddha and left with his sleeves fluttering.</p><p>Western Desert is truly unfathomable!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>The Western Desert had always been the territory of the Buddhist sect since ancient times. It had always been mysterious and extremely powerful. Many people said that out of the five territories of the divine wilderness continent, the Western Desert was only second to the central continent.</p><p>Roarrrr!</p><p>The roar was like thunder, and the underground cave rumbled. Lu Ming did not think much and dug out the purple flame crystal. With a move of his body, he left the place.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming walked around the underground cave for a while but did not find the third piece of purple flame crystal.</p><p>However, he encountered a few purple giant lizards that he killed.</p><p>However, it was obvious that there was a nest of giant lizards in the underground cave, some of which were very powerful. Lu Ming did not stay for long. He walked around for a while, then left the cave and flew into the distance.</p><p>hu hu …</p><p>A strong wind blew and Lu Ming smiled. He was in a good mood after obtaining two purple flame crystals.</p><p>Each of the seven main ingredients required to refine the Nirvana elixir was extremely precious and rarely appeared in the outside world. Now that he had obtained one, it could be considered an opportunity. Naturally, Lu Ming was in a good mood.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>An earth-shattering explosion rang out. In front of them, sword Qi soared into the sky, inscriptions glittered, and the space was torn apart. There was an intense battle going on.</p><p>Lu Ming flew at top speed. He cast the water concept and condensed a cloud of mist. He hid in the mist and watched.</p><p>There were a total of four people in the great battle. Lu Ming was quite familiar with a few of them.</p><p>They were goddess Tan Xiang, Kong Xin from the Tianxia Academy, Wu chengkong from the tianwu sword sect, and a brawny man in his forties. He was as strong as Wu chengkong.</p><p>The four of them were in a chaotic battle.</p><p>However, it was obvious that goddess Tan Xiang and Kong Xin were working together. They fought fiercely with Wu chengkong and the brawny man.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming noticed that there was a small lake below. The water was clear and there were three koi swimming around in the lake.</p><p>These three carps were golden and there was light emitting from their bodies. They gathered and scattered at times, and when they gathered, they looked like a real Dragon.</p><p>Dragon Carp, it’s a Dragon Carp!</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>The Dragon Carp was also a Supreme treasure. It was said to be the descendant of a true dragon. It had the true Blood of a true dragon in its body and was used to refine pills. It was a rare treasure medicine and its value was even higher than the purple flame crystal.</p><p>Coincidentally, the blood of the dragon Carp was one of the seven main ingredients to refine the Nirvana elixir.</p><p>you guys want to fight with me? you’re looking for death. The Dragon Carp is mine!</p><p>Wu chengkong shouted, full of killing intent.</p><p>Wu chengkong, don’t be too overbearing. There are three Dragon carps. How about we each get one? ”</p><p>Tan Xiang spoke.</p><p>“One rule per party, do you have the qualifications? All three of them are mine!”</p><p>Wu chengkong sneered. His sword Qi whistled and cut the space. It was terrifying.</p><p>The other brawny man didn’t say anything. His entire body was emitting white light. He waved his palm, and a huge hand appeared, tearing the sky and the earth.</p><p>this is the sky-splitting great palm imprint. This person should be an expert from the Overlord force, the Ji family!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Among the three parties, Wu chengkong had amazing combat strength, and the strong man from the Ji family had a high cultivation and was not weak either. However, when goddess Tan Xiang and Kong Xin joined forces, their combat strength was also very terrifying and not weaker than others.</p><p>It was difficult to determine the winner in a battle between three parties.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He suddenly used the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps and rushed toward the surface of the lake. In an instant, he appeared above the lake. He stretched out his hand and a huge hand made of vital essence appeared, grabbing at the three Dragon carps.</p><p>“Who is it? You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The people in the air were shocked, and Wu chengkong roared.</p><p>Just as the three Dragon carps were about to land in Lu Ming’s hands, their bodies glowed and transformed into a ray of light. In a flash, they escaped from Lu Ming’s giant primordial Qi hand.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. Just as he was about to capture it with all his might, a terrifying sword Qi appeared in the space and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming had no choice but to turn around and throw a punch.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The sword Qi was destroyed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>In a flash, Wu chengkong, the brawny man from the Ji family, goddess Tan Xiang, and Kong Xin appeared around Lu Ming. However, they did not attack immediately. Instead, they locked their auras on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kid, it’s you?”</p><p>Wu chengkong was shocked when he saw Lu Ming clearly.</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang and Kong Xin were also surprised. They recognized Lu Ming.</p><p>brat, to be able to block my sword, you must have some ability. You deliberately hid your strength before!</p><p>Wu chengkong looked at Lu Ming coldly and continued, ” “However, since you dared to capture a Dragon Carp right under my nose, you must have reached the end of your life!”</p><p>the martial saint’s Secret realm is a place for those who see it. I saw a treasure, so of course I can help!</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips slightly.</p><p>“If you make a move, you have to pay the price with your life!”</p><p>Wu chengkong’s killing intent exploded. He already had the intention to kill Lu Ming when Lu Ming refused to give him the quota for the marrow cleansing pool. Now, his killing intent was even more intense.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Wu chengkong swung his sword and a terrifying sword Qi slashed at Lu Ming. It was even more powerful than before.</p><p>Lu Ming was fearless. He activated the prison destructive heavenly art, exploded with dragon power, and threw a punch.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Heaven and earth trembled and the force surged. Water pillars rose from the lake below. The three Dragon carps flickered and dodged the force.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The sword Qi dispersed, and Lu Ming broke it with a punch. He stepped forward and said in a cold voice, ” “Just you? you’re still lacking!”</p><p>Then, he threw another punch.</p><p>Lu Ming’s fist seemed to contain the force of hundreds of millions of Jun. It was terrifying and shocking, causing the entire space to tremble.</p><p>“So strong?”</p><p>Wu chengkong was extremely shocked. Genuine vitality surged in his body. The sound of swords rang out continuously as he slashed out shocking sword Qi.</p><p>However, it was useless. Lu Ming was like an invincible God of War. He punched out with his fist force, continuously destroying the sword Qi and quickly approaching Wu chengkong.</p><p>On the side, fairy Tan Xiang, Kong Xin, and the others were also extremely shocked.</p><p>They had never expected that this young man, who was thought to have passed the tianxu cave by luck, would have such a powerful combat strength. It was too terrifying.</p><p>why does this person’s fighting style look so familiar? ”</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang said.</p><p>“I have the same feeling!”</p><p>Kong Xin said.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, the strong man from the Ji family moved and pounced at the Dragon Carp below.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
