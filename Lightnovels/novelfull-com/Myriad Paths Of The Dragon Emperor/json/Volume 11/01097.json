He planned to take action directly and kill Shi Zheng, Shi Fang and Xie Zhen together.</p><p>At this moment-</p><p>“Haha, eighth brother, what’s up? Why is it so lively?”</p><p>A loud laugh was heard, and then a rumble came from the sky, as if thousands of soldiers and horses were galloping over.</p><p>There were about a few hundred cavalrymen, each of them riding a fiery red warhorse. These warhorses were covered in fiery red scales, and there were two dragon horns on their heads. Flames were dancing all over their bodies, making them look very mighty.</p><p>This was a dragon horse, and it was said that it had the bloodline of a true dragon. A powerful dragon horse was no weaker than a flood Dragon.</p><p>There were hundreds of people, all of them riding Dragon horses.</p><p>The leader was a young man with a slender figure. He was wearing fiery red armor and fiery boots. His hair was loose and his eyes were like lightning. His aura was powerful.</p><p>“Tenth Prince!”</p><p>Many people cried out in alarm.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The Dragon horse stomped on the air and appeared above the military camp.</p><p>“Your subordinate greets the tenth Prince!”</p><p>Shi Zheng, Shi Fang, and the others quickly knelt down in the tenth Prince’s heart, their eyes filled with respect.</p><p>“Tenth brother, why have you come?”</p><p>Xie Zhen’s expression was a little ugly. As he looked at the young man before him, there was a hint of jealousy and respect in the depths of his eyes.</p><p>The tenth Prince, Xie Yan, was a peerless heaven’s favorite. Among all the children of the current Saint Emperor, he was one of the top existences. He was a second-class heaven’s favorite whose name shook the central continent. His cultivation was powerful, and he had even stepped into the spiritual God Realm. His status in the ancient Saint dynasty was not something that Xie Zhen could compare to.</p><p>In the imperial family, Xie Yan’s existence was second only to Xie nianjun.</p><p>“Eighth brother, you can come here to hunt but I can’t? What are you guys doing? It seems like he wants to attack one of your subordinates. What’s going on? You tell me!”</p><p>The tenth Prince, Xie Yan, pointed at one of the Imperial Dragon guards and ordered.</p><p>His tone was arrogant and unquestionable.</p><p>The Imperial Dragon Guard didn’t dare to show the slightest neglect, nor did he dare to hide anything. He recounted the entire matter.</p><p>haha, so that’s how it is. Eighth brother, you’re becoming more and more useless. You can’t even beat a seventh level spirit embryo vice flag. If you can’t beat it, then so be it. We agreed to fight, but if you lose, you want to kill someone else. If this matter were to spread, wouldn’t my Sage Emperor clan become a joke? ”</p><p>Xie Yan indifferently said.</p><p>haha, tenth brother, you’ve misunderstood. I didn’t mean to kill him. Just now, guard Shi Zheng saw that I was injured and was worried. That’s why he stood in front of me to protect me. It’s all a misunderstanding!</p><p>Xie Zhen’s expression changed before he revealed an ugly smile.</p><p>“Oh, really? So it was just a misunderstanding. This Deputy banner has good combat strength. He’s only one level higher than eighth brother, but he can easily crush eighth brother. He’s a talent!”</p><p>Xie Yan said with a smile.</p><p>Xie Zhen’s fists were clenched so tightly that cracking sounds could be heard. He was furious. He took a deep breath to calm himself down and smiled. not bad, this Deputy banner of the bright road has good combat power. Therefore, I plan to transfer him to the law enforcement Army. The million-year National sacrifice is about to begin. When the time comes, the holy city will be in chaos. The law enforcement Army is in need of manpower!</p><p>Hearing this, Shi Fang and Shi Zheng’s eyes lit up and they sneered.</p><p>The others looked at Lu Ming with pity.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. What did these looks mean?</p><p>haha, he’s your man, eighth brother. You can do whatever you want with him. I’m leaving!</p><p>Xie Yan smiled and led the four hundred cavalrymen towards beast cry mountain.</p><p>After Xie Yan left, Xie Zhen’s expression darkened. He coldly glanced at Lu Ming and said, vice-banner Ming, go back and wait. The order will come soon. You will go to the law enforcement Army and be a commander. With your combat strength, it’s enough!</p><p>As soon as he said that, the expressions of the people around him became even stranger. They looked at Lu Ming with even more pity.</p><p>“Also, you will be transferred to the law-enforcement Army with him.”</p><p>Then, Xie Zhen pointed at Sun Lin.</p><p>Plop!</p><p>Sun Lin’s expression changed drastically, and he immediately knelt down with a plop. He kowtowed and cried out in pain,”No, eighth prince, I’m begging you, please don’t, don’t transfer me to the law enforcement Army, I’m only living with him, I don’t know him!”</p><p>“Hmph, you want to disobey this Prince’s orders?”</p><p>Xie Zhen’s eyes turned cold.</p><p>Sun Lin’s face was pale as he stood there, stunned.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Xie Zhen rose into the air and returned to the mansion. The others quickly followed.</p><p>“AI, Minglu, I’m really going to be killed by you!”</p><p>Sun Lin let out a long sigh, his face full of dejection.</p><p>“What’s going on? Why don’t you want to join the law enforcement Army? from the name, the law enforcement Army should have a lot of power!”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>Many sects had law enforcement halls, which had great power and could enforce the law on behalf of the sect. Everyone respected them.</p><p>Why did Sun Lin seem to be very afraid of joining the law enforcement Army? moreover, when the others heard that Xie Zhen wanted to transfer Lu Ming to the law enforcement Army, they all looked at him with pity. He was somewhat baffled.</p><p>“AI! You don’t know this, but the law enforcement Army does have a lot of power, but it’s useless now.”</p><p>Sun Lin sighed and continued to explain. the law enforcement Army is the law enforcement agency of the ancient Saint dynasty. They are responsible for the law enforcement of the entire Saint City and maintaining the law and order. No matter who it is, no matter which power they are from, if they commit a crime in the Saint City, the law enforcement Army will be dispatched to enforce the law.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Wasn’t this a lot of power?</p><p>30000 years ago, when the ancient Saint dynasty ruled the world, the law-enforcement Army was indeed fearsome and powerful. Whoever dared to commit a crime would be suppressed or even killed on the spot. At that time, everyone wanted to join the law-enforcement Army. As long as you joined the Army, everyone would be afraid of you!</p><p>but now, the ancient Saint dynasty is weak, and the various emperors are all powerful. The law enforcement Army is in an awkward position.</p><p>“For example, if the disciples of the major forces commit a crime, will the law enforcement Army take action or not? If we don’t do anything, the law enforcement Army will represent the face of the ancient Saint dynasty, and the royal family might blame us for it. However, if we do, the experts from the major powers will put pressure on the royal family, and under the pressure, the royal family will hand over the law enforcement Army to appease the other party. In that case, who would be willing to go?”</p><p>Sun Lin explained.</p><p>Lu Ming was suddenly enlightened. He finally understood.</p><p>The main reason was that the ancient Saint dynasty was weak now, and they did not dare to offend those powerful forces.</p><p>If that was the case, the authority of the law enforcement Army would basically be useless. If they did not make a move, it would be equivalent to throwing the face of the ancient Saint dynasty. If they did, the people from the major powers would be powerful enough to put pressure on the law enforcement Army. If the law enforcement Army made a move, they would become the scapegoats.</p><p>No matter what he did, it would be wrong. He would be jumping into the fire pit no matter what he did. It was no wonder that the others were in such a state when they heard that Lu Ming would be transferred to the law enforcement Army.</p><p>sigh, once I’m transferred into the law enforcement Army, it’s over. Furthermore, the million-year National sacrifice is coming. When that time comes, the holy city will be in chaos, and all the major factions of the divine wilderness continent will gather. It will definitely be chaotic. It’s a dead end!”</p><p>Sun Lin sighed and rose into the air with a dejected expression.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
