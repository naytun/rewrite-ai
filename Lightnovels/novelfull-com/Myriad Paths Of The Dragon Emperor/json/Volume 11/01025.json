He stared at Lu Ming and said coldly.</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at blood Luo Zi indifferently and said, ” “This is my battle with Huang Kui and you’re telling me to stop? Who Do You Think You Are?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was heard, causing the entire place to suddenly fall silent.</p><p>Not only the inner court, but the outer court as well.</p><p>Many people widened their eyes in shock.</p><p>Who Do You Think You Are?</p><p>Lu Ming actually dared to speak to blood Luo Zi in this manner. Did he not want to live?</p><p>Chu Kuang, Zhang Wenjin, hai Ziming, and the others all gasped.</p><p>“This is terrible!”</p><p>Chu Kuang and Zhang Wenjin’s expressions changed drastically, and they looked worried.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was strong, he should not be Xue Luo’s match. After all, Xue Luo was a second-grade heaven’s favorite.</p><p>There was a huge difference in combat strength between a second-grade and third-grade heaven’s favorite.</p><p>Just like the Emperor God, if he used his full power, he could kill Blood Sword in a few moves.</p><p>As expected, blood Luo Zi’s body emitted a cold murderous intent. He stared at Lu Ming coldly and laughed out of anger.”Haha, brat, you actually dare to speak to me like this? do you really think that you’re invincible just because you have some battle power? I’ll let you know what I am now. And what are you? You will pay a heavy price for what you said!”</p><p>Then, in a flash, Xue Luo Zi appeared on the fighting ring. His terrifying killing intent filled the whole place, causing many people to shiver.</p><p>Everyone was shocked. Blood Luo Zi was going to attack Lu Ming. He had the intention to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>In the pavilion, Jing kongling frowned and said, ” Xue Luo Zi, you’ve gone too far. If you want to fight, I’ll accompany you!</p><p>After all, Lu Ming had come with Chu Kuang and Zhang Wenjin. As the number one genius of the floating mountain sect, Jing kongling could not just watch master blood Luo kill Lu Ming.</p><p>“Jing kongling, are you trying to meddle in my business?”</p><p>Xue Luo Zi said coldly.</p><p>“So what?”</p><p>The pure and ethereal spirit stood up, his body covered in mist, making him look even more ethereal.</p><p>miss Jing, there’s no need for you to take action. I’m enough to deal with a blood bat!</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was heard again, leaving the others speechless.</p><p>Lu Ming said that he would deal with the blood Luo Zi alone with a confident expression.</p><p>Where did he get his confidence from?</p><p>hehe, sister kongling, I think you don’t need to interfere. Maybe there will be a surprise? ”</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang smiled. She was even more curious about Lu Ming now.</p><p>Jing kongling’s gaze turned and he actually sat down as well, not saying anything more.</p><p>Lu Shaoqing, right? it’s good to be confident, but you’ll soon realize that your confidence is sometimes very stupid!</p><p>Seeing Jing kongling sit down, the killing intent in Xue Luo Zi’s eyes became even colder.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and kicked Huang Kui, who was still twitching, out of the fighting ring. This action made blood Luo Zi’s face darken again.</p><p>He dared to do this in front of him. This was a slap to his face.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A powerful aura burst out from Xue Luo Zi’s body, and a layer of blood-red flames danced wildly.</p><p>This kind of blood-colored flame was extremely terrifying. Compared to the Wang family’s purple Extreme Heavenly Fire, its power was even more shocking and even more bizarre.</p><p>Lu Ming’s face darkened slightly as the essential core in his body circulated crazily.</p><p>He didn’t dare to be careless in front of Xue Luo Zi. After all, Xue Luo Zi was a heaven’s favorite on the same level as an Emperor God.</p><p>“Blood Sky blade!”</p><p>The endless blood-red flames condensed into a saber. Blood Luo Zi held the saber with both hands and stomped his feet. He rushed toward Lu Ming madly and slashed down.</p><p>The terrifying power pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>The power of this strike alone had already surpassed Huang Kui’s.</p><p>The five-colored intent realm covered his entire body as he activated the prison suppressing heaven technique. Lu Ming strode forward and struck out with his palm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The saber ray and the palm collided with a terrifying boom. Lu Ming’s body swayed and he took a few steps back.</p><p>“Lu Shaoqing has retreated. He’s not his match!”</p><p>I knew it! He can’t be eldest senior brother’s match!</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming retreated, the cold-blood Hall elites began to mock him.</p><p>“It’s just the beginning, what’s the rush?”</p><p>Hai Ziming replied coldly.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, blood Luo Zi slashed at Lu Ming again.</p><p>his battle prowess is indeed powerful. Then I’ll increase the power of the prison suppressing heaven technique!</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea and he struck out with his palm again.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming did not retreat. He stabilized himself.</p><p>Blood Sky blade, nine heavenly blades!</p><p>Xue Luo Zi shouted as he slashed out his Scarlet heaven blade. Each slash was stronger than the last, and it seemed like it could destroy everything.</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar rang out as Lu Ming burst out with two streams of dragon energy. His strength increased greatly as he struck out with his palms continuously.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The fighting ring kept shaking, and the terrible force shot in all directions.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, dozens of moves had passed.</p><p>The scene was silent. Everyone’s eyes were wide open as they stared at the two people fighting on the fighting ring.</p><p>“How can he be so strong?”</p><p>The cold-blood Hall disciples were shocked.</p><p>Previously, they thought that blood Luo Zi could easily suppress Lu Ming. But now, they realized that they were wrong. Lu Ming could actually fight with blood Luo Zi to this extent.</p><p>Jing kongling, Jun Yue, and the other second-grade heaven’s favorites all had serious expressions.</p><p>Lu Ming was already qualified to be ranked as a second-grade heaven’s favorite since he could fight blood Luo Zi to this extent.</p><p>Moreover, they could tell that Lu Ming’s cultivation was at the early stage of the ninth level spirit embryo realm, while blood Luo Zi’s cultivation was at the peak of the ninth level spirit embryo realm.</p><p>It was shocking that Xue Luo Zi didn’t have the upper hand when his cultivation was stronger.</p><p>The more he fought, the more shocked Xue Luo Zi became. Lu Ming’s combat strength was beyond his expectations.</p><p>“The bloodthirsty’s world!”</p><p>Xue Luo Zi cast the bloodthirsty technique. A circle of light curtain spread out and enveloped Lu Ming. Lu Ming’s blood was almost boiling.</p><p>Blood Luo Zi was much more powerful than Huang Kui when he used the same move.</p><p>comparing devouring power is like showing off your skills in front of an expert. Devour!</p><p>Lu Ming’s left palm exploded with a terrifying devouring power, which enveloped blood Luo Zi’s entire body.</p><p>At this moment, Xue Luo Zi’s eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p>“The bloodthirsty intent … No, this power is even more terrifying than the bloodthirsty intent. It’s ten times more terrifying. My essence blood, fresh blood, Zhen Yuan, and even my intent realm are shaking. What kind of secret technique is this?”</p><p>Xue Luo Zi’s mind was racing.</p><p>Xue Luo Zi was stunned. Lu Ming would not let go of this opportunity. He arrived in an instant and slashed at Xue Luo Zi with his palm like a heavenly blade.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Xue Luo Zi hurriedly slashed his saber, clashing with Lu Ming’s. The saber Light that was shattered by Lu Ming’s palm hit Xue Luo Zi with a terrifying force. He spat out a mouthful of blood and retreated quickly.</p><p>“Bloodline fusion!”</p><p>While he was retreating, he performed bloodline fusion to unleash his strongest combat power.</p><p>“Four dragon energies!” He exclaimed.</p><p>Seeing this, Lu Ming also released four bursts of dragon power.</p><p>His skin glowed with purple light, and his power increased greatly. He charged at Xue Luo Zi.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
