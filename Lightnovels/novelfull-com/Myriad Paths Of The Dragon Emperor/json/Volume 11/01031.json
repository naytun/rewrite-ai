Now, the light pillar was also in this forest. Lu Ming had no choice but to link the two together.</p><p>...</p><p>it seems that even if there are treasures here, it won’t be easy to get them. There must be spiritual God Realm powerhouses here!</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself. However, he did not retreat just like that. Instead, he concealed his aura and flew down the mountain forest, sprinting in the direction of the light pillar.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>When he was about to reach the light pillar, he heard the sound of something breaking through the air from other directions. Lu Ming discovered three burly men and two elders. They were moving forward at high speed and rushed into a circle of light.</p><p>They were the martial artists nearby who had been attracted here.</p><p>“Hmm, what a big formation!”</p><p>As he neared the light pillar, Lu Ming could sense that there was a huge formation in front of him. On one side of the formation, there was a gap that formed a circle of light. The green light pillar had burst out from this gap.</p><p>From the gap, there was an extremely dense spiritual Qi.</p><p>It was obvious that a hole had been opened in this great array.</p><p>“Lu Ming, there’s a herb garden inside. I can smell spiritual herbs!”</p><p>Dandan twitched her nose and kept sniffing.</p><p>“A medicinal garden? Could it be Medicine King’s Valley’s medicine garden?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>The valley of the medicine Masters was not far from here. When Lu Ming heard about the herb garden, the first thing he thought of was the valley of the medicine Masters.</p><p>I don’t think so. This array is very terrifying, but it was set up a long time ago. I’m afraid it’s been more than a million years!</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>“A million years or more?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>A million years ago, wasn’t that ancient times?</p><p>This was an ancient medicine garden!</p><p>“Let’s go in and take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he rushed into the circle of light, disappearing.</p><p>The ancient herb garden was sealed by a large array. After so many years, there might be extremely precious spirit herbs. Lu Ming did not want to miss it.</p><p>Within the light circle, there were also mountains and forests. However, the heaven and earth spiritual Qi was dozens of times denser than the outside. There was another kind of energy in the spiritual Qi, the origin Qi!</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze around and realized that the flowers, grass, and trees here were more lively and were growing more luxuriantly.</p><p>Lu Ming, let’s go. I can smell the spiritual herbs!</p><p>Dandan shouted, spread her short legs, and ran forward.</p><p>Lu Ming followed dandan and walked forward. At the same time, he observed his surroundings carefully.</p><p>we’re late. Some of the spirit herbs have been dug away!</p><p>Along the way, dandan found a few pits and sighed.</p><p>Judging from the aura of the remaining spirit herbs, they were probably all level eight spirit herbs.</p><p>Level 8 spiritual herbs were dozens of times more precious than Level 7 spiritual herbs.</p><p>Clearly, there were already quite a number of people who came in before, and the spirit herbs were all dug up.</p><p>Dandan didn’t go straight forward, but continued to fly to the left.</p><p>After ten thousand miles, they finally found spiritual herbs. Two of them were level eight spiritual herbs. They dug them out and stuffed them into their mouths with joy.</p><p>They found quite a few spiritual herbs along the way. They were at least Level Seven, and many of them were level eight.</p><p>Lu Ming did not snatch it from dandan and gave it all to her.</p><p>Now that his physical body had achieved complete grade eight, Ordinary Grade eight spiritual medicine would not be of much use if he wanted to break through to grade nine. He could only do so if he obtained a grade nine spiritual medicine.</p><p>It was not easy to cultivate the ninth-grade body, because the ninth-grade body was the highest realm of the body and the foundation to break through to the Martial Emperor realm. Only by cultivating the body to the completion of the ninth-grade body could one break through to the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>However, it was very difficult for the body to break through to rank-9. It was even more difficult to complete the breakthrough.</p><p>In fact, many second-and even third-class geniuses in the central continent had cultivated their physical bodies to the peak of the eighth stage.</p><p>After all, he was a prodigy from an Overlord force. His physical body cultivation technique was definitely top-notch. It was not inferior to Lu Ming’s ten thousand spiritual combat body. It might even be better. He also had plenty of resources. Naturally, his physical body was strong.</p><p>Lu Ming needed level nine spiritual herbs.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, a deafening roar came from the front. Lu Ming’s expression changed slightly. Someone was fighting.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming grabbed dandan and walked forward.</p><p>There were two old men in front of him, attacking the other two.</p><p>The other two people were a middle-aged man and a young woman.</p><p>At this moment, the burly man and the woman were completely at a disadvantage.</p><p>The two old men were both in the great circle of the spirit embryo realm, and the burly man was also in the great circle of the spirit embryo realm. They were locked in a battle with one of the old men.</p><p>On the other hand, the young woman was only at the sixth level of the spirit embryo realm. Although she was also a heaven’s favorite with powerful combat strength, she was no match for the elder at the perfected spirit embryo realm with her sixth level spirit embryo realm cultivation. She could be killed at any time.</p><p>“Miss!”</p><p>The burly man roared and wanted to help, but he was held back by the other party and couldn’t get away.</p><p>“Hehe, die!”</p><p>An old man sneered.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had already quietly approached. He immediately relaxed when he saw that the strongest was only at the perfected spirit embryo realm.</p><p>“Eh? That’s Zhou Xin!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered as he recognized the woman.</p><p>Back in the pill city, Zhou Xin was the one who gave Lu Ming a piece of purple jade that contained the storage elemental stone. Lu Ming was still very grateful to Zhou Xin.</p><p>Now that Zhou Xin was in trouble, he naturally wouldn’t leave her in the lurch.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>His body flashed and he charged towards the old man who had attacked Zhou Xin.</p><p>Upon hearing the commotion, the few of them turned to look at Lu Ming.</p><p>“It’s you?”</p><p>Zhou Xin’s gaze flickered and she recognized Lu Ming.</p><p>a ninth level spirit embryo realm brat is courting death!</p><p>The old man grinned and revealed a ferocious expression. His claws were like blades as he clawed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and a ray of spear light pierced through the elder’s defense. It was as easy as crushing dry weeds and smashing rotten wood as it pierced towards the elder’s glabella.</p><p>“No, spare my life!”</p><p>The old man was extremely shocked. He knew that he had encountered a terrifying heaven’s favorite, but it was already too late.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The old man was pierced by the spear radiance and died.</p><p>The other old man who was fighting with the middle-aged man saw this and was scared out of his wits. He immediately ran away, but a spear light flashed and nailed the old man to the ground.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>Zhou Xin was stunned.</p><p>From the moment Lu Ming appeared, the two great circle spirit embryo experts were instantly killed by him. They did not have the slightest ability to resist.</p><p>“Miss Zhou, I didn’t expect to see you here. Do you still remember me?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>young master Lu, I didn’t expect you to be this strong.</p><p>Zhou Xin’s eyes flickered and she was a little surprised.</p><p>Zhou Xin guessed that Lu Ming was a third-grade heaven’s favorite since he was able to kill two perfected spirit embryo realm experts so easily.</p><p>“Miss!”</p><p>The burly man came to Zhou Xin’s side and called out in concern.</p><p>“Uncle Liu, I’m fine. This is young master Lu, Lu Shaoqing!”</p><p>Zhou Xin introduced.</p><p>“Thank you, young master Lu, for saving me!”</p><p>The middle-aged man cupped his fists, but there was a hint of vigilance in his eyes.</p><p>young master Lu, are you here to look for spirit herbs too? ”</p><p>Zhou Xin asked.</p><p>that’s right. I was attracted by the light pillar, so I came to take a look!</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
