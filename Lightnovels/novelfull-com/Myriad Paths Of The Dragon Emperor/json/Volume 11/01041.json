She and fairy Tan Xiang were looking at Lu Ming with strange expressions.</p><p>“Lu Shaoqing, I didn’t expect you to be such a person. You’ve taught your spiritual pet to be like this!”</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang glared at Lu Ming fiercely.</p><p>“I … I …”</p><p>The veins on Lu Ming’s face throbbed. He felt wronged.</p><p>Dandan was not taught by him. This fellow was a wily old fox.</p><p>However, the sandalwood fairy and the pristine Void Spirit clearly thought that dandan was Lu Ming’s spiritual pet. Furthermore, she looked young and must have been taught by Lu Ming. Since the spiritual pet was so perverted, the master must be the same.</p><p>Lu Ming cursed dandan hundreds of times in his heart. He was really speechless.</p><p>His reputation was going to be ruined by this guy.</p><p>“Beauty, why did you hit me? you haven’t told me how you’re going to play with me.”</p><p>Dandan ran over and shouted again.</p><p>“Get in!”</p><p>Lu Ming grabbed dandan and threw her into the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>cough, cough. Ladies, I’ll take my leave now. We’ll meet again if fate allows!</p><p>Lu Ming felt a little embarrassed. He coughed twice and cupped his fists.</p><p>“Where is young master Lu going?”</p><p>Lu Ming did not look like that turtle. That was why fairy Tan Xiang asked in a low voice.</p><p>I plan to cultivate while heading to the holy city. Goodbye!</p><p>With that, Lu Ming did not stay any longer. He turned into a ray of light and soared into the sky.</p><p>“This Lu Shaoqing is even more mysterious than I thought!”</p><p>Goddess Tan Xiang’s eyes flickered and she left with Jing kongling.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming cultivated while hurrying on his way. He did not move quickly and would stop every now and then. Sometimes, he would stop to comprehend when he had gained something. For now, his main focus was to comprehend the intent realm of heaven and earth.</p><p>As for the thirty over spirit refining fruits, he had also found a place to refine all of them. The energy of the spirit refining fruits had all seeped into his spirit embryo. When he broke through to the spirit God Realm, his spirit God would definitely be more condensed than ordinary people, and his chances of surviving the heavenly Tribulation would also be greater.</p><p>He walked and stopped. Seven days later, Lu Ming had only traveled a few million miles.</p><p>One day, Lu Ming came to the territory of a sect called the black fog sect.</p><p>Compared to the entire central continent, this was a small sect. There were only a few spirit God powerhouses in the sect, but they also had a teleportation formation. Lu Ming planned to take the teleportation formation of the black fog sect, cross the void, and head west.</p><p>After all, the central continent was too vast.</p><p>There were hundreds of big regions in the East barren, but the central continent was seven to eight times bigger than the East barren. How big could it be? If he flew to the holy city, who knew how long it would take.</p><p>“What’s happening? The teleportation array of the mysterious fog sect has been controlled by a powerful force. No one is allowed to use the teleportation array to leave!”</p><p>“What? There was such a thing? What kind of force is so overbearing?”</p><p>I heard it’s cold-blood Hall. They seem to be looking for someone and have sent a large number of experts!</p><p>“I have something urgent to attend to, so I have to leave!”</p><p>“I can only go to the other forces to take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming heard this news when he walked into a big city near the mysterious fog sect.</p><p>cold-blood Hall has actually sealed the transportation formation of black fog sect.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>He recalled that the bearded man had said that something had been stolen in the ancient herb garden. Was cold-blood Hall still chasing after the thief? What was it that could make cold-blood Hall mobilize so many people?</p><p>Lu Ming observed the area around the mysterious fog sect and saw many cold-blood Hall experts.</p><p>The next day, Lu Ming left the territory of the mysterious fog sect and headed to another force.</p><p>The divine Wind ancient nation was an ancient nation with a few spirit gods guarding it. There was also a teleportation array in the imperial capital of the divine Wind ancient nation.</p><p>A few days later, Lu Ming arrived at the divine Wind ancient country’s imperial capital. He appeared in a restaurant.</p><p>damn it, the teleportation formation in the Holy Wind ancient country is also controlled by cold-blood Hall. We can’t get out!</p><p>it’s said that all the teleportation formations of the dozen forces nearby are under cold-blood Hall’s control. No one can use them to leave!</p><p>cold-blood Hall is too overbearing!</p><p>who asked them to be the Overlord force? that’s a force with an Emperor!</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows as he heard the discussion in the restaurant.</p><p>The teleportation arrays of the dozen or so small forces were all controlled. There was no need to go to other forces.</p><p>After eating and drinking, Lu Ming found an Inn in the divine Wind imperial capital to stay in temporarily and observe the situation.</p><p>From then on, Lu Ming cultivated in the inn every day, occasionally going out to check on the situation.</p><p>Half a month passed in the blink of an eye, but cold-blood Hall still controlled all the teleportation formations. No one could get out of the formation.</p><p>Some people were anxious and had urgent matters to attend to. Therefore, many people had already gathered together and planned to leave by flying instead of using the teleportation array.</p><p>However, to go to the West, they had to cross a huge mountain range. The mountain range stretched from north to south and was tens of millions of miles long. There were countless powerful fierce beasts on it. Ordinary people would only be courting death if they flew over the mountain range.</p><p>However, to the West of the Holy Wind ancient country, there was a huge plain. It was as if someone had punched through the mountain and created a plain. This plain was much safer than the mountain, and it became a passage for many people to go west.</p><p>However, there were also many fierce beasts on the plain. Occasionally, there would be powerful fierce beasts that had evolved from the mountains on both sides. Therefore, for safety reasons, if one did not take the teleportation array and flew over, a large group of people would gather and move together.</p><p>When they entered, the divine Wind imperial capital had already organized a group of people to fly over the mountain range.</p><p>On this day, tens of thousands of people flew towards the West of the divine Wind imperial capital.</p><p>Lu Ming was one of them. He also planned to fly over the mountain range with the crowd.</p><p>The group of people moved forward, and soon, a vast mountain range appeared in front of them.</p><p>This mountain range was incomparably huge, towering into the clouds. It stretched from north to south, and there were countless ferocious beasts on it.</p><p>However, in the middle of this mountain range, there was a huge gap that formed a plain. It was at least 10000 miles wide and connected the mountain range to the other side.</p><p>It was said that a long time ago, there was no such gap here. Later on, there were two emperors fighting, and this mountain range was hit by one of the emperors. The mountain range was broken in half, forming this plain.</p><p>Lu Ming had seen an Emperor’s attack before. An Emperor’s path expert was too terrifying. One palm could definitely penetrate such a vast mountain range.</p><p>The group of people gathered together and flew towards the plain.</p><p>roar …</p><p>The roars of all kinds of fierce beasts could be heard from time to time. Some roars tore through the clouds and were extremely terrifying.</p><p>It was the roar of a spirit god level beast.</p><p>let’s pass through this mountain range as soon as possible. We’ll be in trouble if we attract a spiritual God-level ferocious beast!</p><p>Someone shouted. Everyone increased their speed and flew forward.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, a blood-red light filled the air in front of them, and the blood Qi soared to the sky, blocking everyone’s path.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>oh no, it’s the cold-blood Hall experts. They’re blocking the way.</p><p>“What? Did cold-blood Hall send experts to stop them? Detestable!”</p><p>The scene was noisy.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
