After two days, countless figures flew toward the pillar of heavens mountains.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two blended into the crowd and arrived near the pillar of heavens mountain. When they arrived, they realized that the area was already surrounded by people.</p><p>At a glance, there were no less than ten thousand people.</p><p>From this, one could see the influence of a second-grade heaven’s favorite in the central continent.</p><p>The central continent was vast, it was seven to eight times the size of the East barren. It was filled with talented people and experts.</p><p>However, in such a vast land, how many second-grade geniuses were there?</p><p>Below the five young tyrants were the second-grade heaven’s favorites. There were only twenty of them, and it was rare to see one.</p><p>In the battle of Providence, most people were not qualified to watch the battle. That was why so many people had come this time. They all wanted to see what level a second-grade heaven’s favorite had reached and what terrifying level his battle prowess had reached.</p><p>In the crowd, there were old men and a few youths in their teens.</p><p>These youths were the most excited. They were the younger generation and had missed the battle of Providence.</p><p>They wanted to see how powerful the heaven’s favorites who were half a generation older than them were. This would motivate them.</p><p>“So many experts!”</p><p>Chu Kuang’s eyes swept across the crowd. He discovered many heaven’s favorites who were on par with him. They were third-grade heaven’s favorites. There were also some who were not third-grade heaven’s favorites but were still extraordinary. For example, hai Ziming, Wu Kong, Ling yunkong and Lu Ming from the floating mountain.</p><p>There were even a few elders standing in the sky, exuding an astonishing aura. They were clearly spiritual God Realm existences.</p><p>This battle had even attracted the attention of spiritual God Realm existences.</p><p>Suddenly, demonic Qi rushed to the sky. A black-robed young man stepped through the air and attracted everyone’s attention.</p><p>Jun Yue, the Jun Yue of demon mountain!</p><p>Someone exclaimed when they saw the young man.</p><p>“Demon mountain Jun Yue is also here!”</p><p>Zhang Wenjin and Chu Kuang also exclaimed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He could not help but look at Jun Yue carefully.</p><p>During this period of travel, Lu Ming had also inquired Chu Kuang and Zhang Wenjing about many things regarding the central continent. Chu Kuang had talked the most about the heaven’s pride of the younger generation.</p><p>Lu Ming had some understanding of the heaven’s favorites of the central continent. Of course, it was mainly the top five young warriors, twenty or so second-grade heaven’s favorites, and the various overlords.</p><p>Demon mountain was also one of the overlords of central continent, and Jun Yue was one of the twenty second-grade heaven’s favorites.</p><p>he’s indeed very strong and terrifying. He’s definitely a heaven’s favorite on the level of an Emperor God!</p><p>Lu Ming sized up junyue and pondered in his heart.</p><p>Junyue gave him a very dangerous feeling.</p><p>It was obvious that the battle between Yin BUPO and blood Luo Zi had attracted the attention of heaven’s favorites of the same level.</p><p>Jun Yue stood in the air with his hands behind his back. He looked straight ahead as if no one could attract his attention. He didn’t even look at the spiritual God Realm experts as if he didn’t care at all.</p><p>Indeed, with his talent, it was only a matter of time before he broke through to the spiritual God Realm. In the future, he would definitely reach the Supreme-being realm. His goal was to become an Emperor. How could he care about ordinary spiritual gods?</p><p>The crowd continued to wait.</p><p>the pure space spirit! The pure space spirit of the floating mountain!</p><p>Suddenly, the crowd let out another cry.</p><p>“Junior Sister Kong Ling is here!”</p><p>Chu Kuang’s eyes lit up as he looked at the sky.</p><p>A young woman wearing a long, water-colored veil was stepping on the air and approaching. Her entire body was filled with water vapor.</p><p>She looked like she was in her twenties. Her beauty was unparalleled and could cause the downfall of a country. Her graceful figure was faintly discernible in the water vapor.</p><p>She was barefooted, and her two Jade-like feet were like the most beautiful piece of art in the world. With every step she took, a cloud would appear in the sky. She was walking on the cloud as she walked over.</p><p>The scene was silent, as if everyone’s eyes were attracted by this woman.</p><p>“So she’s the pure spatial spirit! As expected, she’s peerless in beauty!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but sigh in admiration.</p><p>Chu Kuang was ranked second in the floating mountain sect, while the number one heaven’s favorite of the floating mountain sect was Jing kongling.</p><p>She was a woman with terrifying talent. At the same time, she was also a second-grade heaven’s favorite. She was as famous as Jun Yue and Yin BUPO.</p><p>Furthermore, Jing kongling was one of the five great beauties of the central continent, everyone in the central continent knew her.</p><p>For the past few days, Chu Kuang and Zhang Wenjin had mentioned her to Lu Ming many times. Lu Ming had long been curious about this unparalleled beauty.</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but compare all the women he had met with the pure and ethereal spirit. He realized that only Xie nianqing could compare to the pure and ethereal spirit. The others, such as Mu Lan and Qiu Yue, were slightly inferior.</p><p>“Jing kongling, I didn’t expect you to be attracted to this battle!”</p><p>Junyue’s gaze finally moved as he looked towards Jing kongling. A fiery light flashed in the depths of his eyes.</p><p>“Didn’t you come too?”</p><p>The pure Void Spirit spoke softly. His voice was calm and when it entered one’s ears, it gave one a very comfortable feeling. It was as if it could calm one’s Restless Heart.</p><p>Just like her name, she was like an ethereal fairy, untainted by even a speck of dust.</p><p>“Brother Jun, sister Kong Ling, you’re early!”</p><p>A sweet and clear voice was heard. Not far away, another woman stepped on the air and arrived.</p><p>This woman looked younger than Jing kongling, but her looks were not any worse than Jing kongling’s.</p><p>Her little face was a little pale, but she had a kind of sickly beauty that made people want to go up and protect her.</p><p>“Medicine King’s Valley’s goddess Tan Xiang!”</p><p>Many people widened their eyes.</p><p>Another second-grade heaven’s favorite, and one of the five beauties of the central continent.</p><p>Many people felt that they were going crazy. They felt that this trip was too worth it. This time, the main characters of the two duels had yet to arrive, and there were already peerless geniuses who had arrived.</p><p>Even two of the five beauties of the central continent were here.</p><p>It’s worth it, it’s too worth it. Many people have crossed hundreds of millions of miles to see one of the five great beauties, but they can’t even get it. Today, they can see two of the five great beauties. What’s not worth it?</p><p>“Fairy Tan Xiang!”</p><p>Chu Kuang’s eyes also lit up as he stared at goddess Tan Xiang like a lecherous pervert, causing Zhang Wenjin, who was standing beside him, to feel quite displeased.</p><p>In fact, Zhang Wenjin was also a rare beauty, but compared to Jing kongling and goddess Tan Xiang, she was far behind.</p><p>“Sister Tan Xiang, why are you here?”</p><p>The pristine Void Spirit stepped forward and came to the side of goddess Tan Xiang. The two of them stood together.</p><p>Almost everyone’s eyes fell on the two women. Many people’s eyes were burning with passion, but no one dared to flirt or even hit on them.</p><p>Although the two women were beautiful, they were also heaven’s pride experts whose names shook the world. They were extremely terrifying. Whoever dared to flirt with them would die without even knowing how they died.</p><p>“Hahaha, I didn’t expect that the two fairies would come. This Yin is truly honored!”</p><p>A loud laugh was heard. In the distance, a bolt of lightning flashed. The next moment, a young man in purple feather clothes appeared on the top of Sky Pillar mountain.</p><p>This young man had cold eyes, an aquiline nose, and extremely sharp eyes that flashed with lightning.</p><p>Yin BUPO!</p><p>Someone called out the person’s name.</p><p>Finally, one of the two people in today’s battle had appeared.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
