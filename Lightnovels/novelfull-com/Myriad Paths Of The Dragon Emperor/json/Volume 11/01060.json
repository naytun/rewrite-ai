Can we even pass the Tiangang cave? ”</p><p>that’s right, this is too difficult. It can’t be that he can’t even pass the five Giants, right? ”</p><p>that’s not necessarily true. Tianxu cave doesn’t test pure combat power!</p><p>Many people around sighed. Even Wu chengkong could not pass it. It was too difficult.</p><p>Wu chengkong carried his sword and flew to the side. He sat in the air, looking calm.</p><p>“I’ll try!”</p><p>The pure spatial Spirit’s body was surrounded by clouds and mist as he stepped into the sky and entered the rising sky cave.</p><p>However, no one thought highly of the pure spirit. Even Wu chengkong failed, so no one thought that the pure spirit could pass.</p><p>However, after nearly an hour, a cry of surprise came from the exit of tianxu cave.</p><p>“It’s a success, the pure spatial spirit has succeeded!”</p><p>The exclamations rose and fell.</p><p>“What? The pure spatial spirit had succeeded? Let’s go take a look!”</p><p>Immediately, the figures flew to the other side of the mountain.</p><p>Even goddess Tan Xiang, Jun Yue, Wu chengkong, and the others could not help but fly to the other side of the mountain.</p><p>When he flew over, he saw Qing Junling standing in the air.</p><p>The pure Void Spirit had actually passed through the Tiangang cave.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this time, two beams of light flew down from the White jade Palace in the sky and turned into two white-robed elders. They were the two elders of the Tianxia Academy.</p><p>haha, miss Jing kongling, congratulations on obtaining a spot to enter the marrow cleansing pool. Here’s a token for you. The marrow cleansing pool will be opened in half a month. You can use this token to enter the pool!</p><p>An elder laughed as he took out a token and passed it to Jing kongling.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>Jing kongling thanked him and took the token.</p><p>Countless people looked at Jing kongling with envy. This was the token that allowed one to enter the marrow cleansing pool.</p><p>Yin BUPO, master Xue Luo, Jun Yue, and the others were even more envious. They were all people who had the ambition to become emperors, and the marrow cleansing pool could save them a lot of time.</p><p>Wu chengkong’s eyes were filled with fire as he looked at Jing kongling with possessiveness.</p><p>Everyone knew that Wu chengkong was a pursuer of Jing kongling, but Jing kongling did not seem to be interested in him.</p><p>“Sister Kong Ling, congratulations!”</p><p>Goddess Tan Xiang smiled and walked towards Jing kongling to congratulate him.</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang didn’t feel much about the marrow cleansing pool. She cultivated the Dao of inscriptions, so the strength of her physical body didn’t matter much.</p><p>The pure spatial spirit was also quite happy. At first, she didn’t expect to pass.</p><p>Then, everyone returned to the entrance of the tianxu cave.</p><p>A tall and straight figure stepped in.</p><p>“It’s him, di Shen!”</p><p>Many people’s eyes moved.</p><p>After defeating blood Luo Zi last time, di Shen’s fame had increased and he had attracted a lot of attention.</p><p>Many people were watching and guessing whether the Emperor God could pass through the Tiangang cave.</p><p>it shouldn’t be possible to pass. The pure spatial spirit is a special case. I really don’t know what conditions are required to pass the tianxu cave!</p><p>it’s too difficult to pass through the tianxu cave. According to this ratio, there are less than ten people in the world who can pass through it!</p><p>indeed, the Tianxia Academy had long known that not many could pass, so they opened the marrow cleansing pool. Otherwise, if anyone could pass, the Tianxia Academy would have suffered a great loss!</p><p>Some people were chatting and waiting.</p><p>Suddenly-</p><p>he passed! The Emperor God passed!</p><p>Another cry of surprise rang out.</p><p>“What? You passed?”</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>A group of people was shocked and hurriedly flew over to take a look. As expected, they saw the Emperor God’s figure at the exit of tianxu cave.</p><p>The Emperor God had really passed through the Tiangang cave.</p><p>“This Emperor God is amazing!”</p><p>Some people sighed and began to re-examine the Emperor gods.</p><p>The Emperor God had first defeated blood Luo Zi, and now he had passed through tianxu cave. It was amazing.</p><p>Naturally, many people thought of the name Lu Ming. Anyone who knew about the East barren’s proud sons of heaven knew that the number one in the East barren was Lu Ming, not the Emperor God.</p><p>Even Wu chengkong’s eyes shot out two beams of sword light as he stared at di Shen.</p><p>no wonder he’s the Emperor God, the strongest junior of Di Yi!</p><p>In the crowd, Lu Ming’s lips curled up slightly.</p><p>The Emperor God was indeed very powerful and had amazing talent. He had comprehended three kinds of intent realms and even had a terrifying intent realm like space intent realm.</p><p>In the war of Providence, Lu Ming had relied on the combination of the Dao of inscription to barely suppress the Emperor gods. In Lu Ming’s heart, he had never underestimated the Emperor gods.</p><p>Now, more than a year and a half had passed, and the Emperor God had become even more terrifying.</p><p>The two old men flew down from the White jade Palace above and looked at the Emperor God in surprise.</p><p>Another person passed, and it was indeed beyond the expectations of the Tianxia Academy.</p><p>young master di Shen, please take this token. You can enter the marrow-cleansing pool to cultivate with it!</p><p>An old man gave the Emperor God a token.</p><p>The Emperor God took it and thanked the old man.</p><p>“Yang potian has come!”</p><p>Suddenly, a cry of surprise came from the front.</p><p>“What? Yang potian, one of the five magnates, has arrived!”</p><p>The crowd exclaimed in shock.</p><p>Then, they all charged forward.</p><p>In the air, a young man stepped through the air.</p><p>This young man had his hands behind his back and his hair was loose. He was tall and burly, and his eyes were bright and full of wildness.</p><p>Step by step, he walked very slowly, but he exuded a supreme majesty. Everyone felt a huge pressure on their hearts.</p><p>Wu chengkong, Jun Yue, and the other heaven’s favorites looked serious.</p><p>The Emperor God’s eyes were filled with fighting intent.</p><p>Yang potian, like the Emperor God, had also cultivated space intent.</p><p>“So this is yang potian, one of the top five young warriors?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were bright as he stared at yang potian.</p><p>Yang potian gave him a very strong pressure. He had a feeling that this person was very strong and very dangerous.</p><p>Yang potian stepped on the air and walked into the tianxu cave without looking at the crowd. He then disappeared.</p><p>“Let’s go to the exit. Yang potian should be able to pass through the Tiangang cave!”</p><p>Many people flew towards the exit of tianxu cave.</p><p>Even the two elders from Tianxia Academy didn’t leave. Instead, they waited at the exit.</p><p>Half an hour later, a tall figure stepped out of the tianxu cave’s exit.</p><p>Yang potian!</p><p>He had indeed passed through the Tiangang cave.</p><p>amazing, amazing. The five magnates should all be able to pass through the Tiangang cave!</p><p>that’s right. The five magnates are too terrifying. In the past, they were all heaven’s favorites that only appeared once in a thousand years. But now, there are five of them in this generation.</p><p>Many people sighed. The five magnates were the pinnacle of all heaven’s favorites in the central continent. The ultimate goal of all the young people was really powerful.</p><p>It was a sure thing that they would become Supreme martial artists. In the future, it was also very likely that they would break through to the Emperor realm. It could be said that they were all young emperors.</p><p>“I should also try!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He came to the entrance and stepped in.</p><p>Lu Ming did not attract much attention when he stepped into the tianxu cave. Even if some people saw Lu Ming entering, they only regarded him as a small fry and did not take him seriously at all.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
