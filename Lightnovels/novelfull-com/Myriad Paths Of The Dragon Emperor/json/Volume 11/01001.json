And you still want to sneak away? Humph! Young master yunkong has taken a fancy to these two girls. Do you think they can escape?”</p><p>...</p><p>Ling Kai’s cold eyes swept over Xiao Zhan, ah Luo, and ah Lei.</p><p>Xiao Zhan, a ‘ke and a’ Lei’s faces turned pale. They knew that this time, they could not escape.</p><p>and you, kid, you actually dared to injure us. You simply don’t know what’s good for you. Hehe, aren’t you still in our hands? ”</p><p>Ling Kai glared at Lu Ming ferociously and licked his lips. but don’t worry. I won’t kill you so easily. I’ll make you suffer all the torture in the world and let you die in pain!</p><p>“AI!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly sighed.</p><p>“Hmph, it’s too late to sigh now!” Ling Kaisen said coldly.</p><p>I’m sighing. I was in the mood to drink, but it was interrupted by a few wild dogs. What a killjoy!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. Then, under everyone’s shocked gaze, he picked up the wine pot on the table and said,”However, the wine is indeed good wine. We can’t waste it!”</p><p>With that, Lu Ming opened his mouth and took a deep breath. The wine in the flagon turned into a water column and flew into his mouth.</p><p>Lu Ming gulped down all the water.</p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded.</p><p>“You … Not poisoned? How is that possible?”</p><p>Xiao Hongyun cried out in disbelief, thinking that he was dreaming.</p><p>He had clearly seen Lu Ming drink many glasses of wine. How could he not be poisoned? moreover, Lu Ming had finished the rest of the wine. What was going on?</p><p>Could it be that Lu Ming was not afraid of poison?</p><p>Ling Kai and the others were also dumbfounded.</p><p>They were the ones who had brought the snow heart poison. They had given Xiao Hongyun and Xiao ning the antidote in advance and then poisoned the wine and dishes. Their main target was Lu Ming.</p><p>In their eyes, Lu Ming was the most dangerous. Xiao Zhan and the others were not a threat to them.</p><p>The process was surprisingly smooth. Xiao Hongyun and his son had successfully brought Xiao Zhan and the rest here. Lu Ming and the rest had also successfully drunk and eaten. Moreover, Lu Ming had drunk the most and eaten the most. But how could Lu Ming be fine now?</p><p>Ling Kai knew better than anyone how powerful the snow heart poison was.</p><p>Xiao Zhan, a ‘ke and a’ Lei were a little dazed. Then, their eyes revealed a glimmer of hope. Lu Ming was fine.</p><p>Just now, they were already in despair, but now, Hope was born again.</p><p>“I might as well tell you that the moment I picked up the wine cup, I knew that the wine was poisoned!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Xiao Hongyun contemptuously and smiled faintly.</p><p>“You … If you know, why are you still drinking?”</p><p>Xiao Hongyun was still in disbelief.</p><p>“Because it’s good wine! How can I waste it? besides, I also want to see what kind of tricks you are playing.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and stood up. Light swirled around his body and a cold aura emanated from him.</p><p>Then, he stretched out his palm and pointed it at Xiao Zhan, a ‘Lei and a’ Luo. A huge devouring force burst out and white light flew out from the three of them. As the white light flew through the air, a layer of Crystal White frost appeared in the air.</p><p>The white light continued to fly into Lu Ming’s palm and was devoured by him. Xiao Zhan, a ‘Lei and a’ Luo’s faces also turned red. The poison in their bodies had been detoxified.</p><p>Xiao Hongyun, Xiao ning, Ling Kai, and the others all widened their eyes in shock.</p><p>They had never heard of such a method of detoxification.</p><p>“Now, it’s your turn. Since you’re here, don’t even think about leaving!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes swept across the room, and a sharp murderous intent burst out.</p><p>“Not good, retreat!”</p><p>Xiao Hongyun’s heart skipped a beat. Without hesitation, he pulled Xiao ning and quickly retreated.</p><p>They were fast but Lu Ming was faster.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved and he appeared in front of Xiao Hongyun and Xiao ning like a stream of light. He pointed two fingers and the two of them were unable to resist as their dantians were touched by Lu Ming’s finger.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Like balloons that had been burst, Xiao Hongyun and Xiao ning screamed as their bodies were sent flying and fell to the ground. Their auras were weak, and they were like ordinary people.</p><p>Their cultivation had been crippled by Lu Ming.</p><p>ah, ah, my cultivation, my cultivation!</p><p>Xiao Hongyun and Xiao ning both screamed in despair.</p><p>It’s over, it’s all over. Initially, he wanted to rely on Ling yunkong to rise up the ranks. Now, he didn’t manage to curry favor with Ling yunkong and his cultivation was crippled. He had become a cripple.</p><p>All hope was gone.</p><p>“Go, go!”</p><p>Ling Kai’s pupils contracted sharply as he screamed repeatedly. He himself was about to retreat.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly appeared in front of Ling Kai, grabbed his neck, and lifted him in the air.</p><p>“Release … Let me go, what do you want to do? I’m young master yunkong’s man!”</p><p>Ling Kai shouted and tried to threaten Lu Ming.</p><p>“Swallow!”</p><p>devour! Lu Ming spat coldly. The devouring power suddenly erupted.</p><p>Ling Kai screamed and kept struggling, but to everyone’s horror, Ling Kai’s body shriveled up like a ball and finally turned into a dry corpse.</p><p>“Bloodthirsty, this is the bloodthirsty technique of cold-blood Hall! You’re from cold-blood Hall, go, go!”</p><p>The other people from the floating mountain sect cried out in alarm and tried to escape.</p><p>“Did I let you go? All of you, stay!”</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out his palm and clenched it in the air.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying devouring power burst out and enveloped all the people of the floating mountain sect.</p><p>These people screamed in horror. Their power of blood, blood essence, blood, vital essence, and other things flew out of their bodies and were devoured by Lu Ming.</p><p>This feeling was too terrifying. He had seen himself being devoured and the people around him turning into dried corpses.</p><p>“No, no…”</p><p>They screamed in agony. However, after a short while, everyone from the floating mountain sect turned into mummies and Lu Ming devoured everything.</p><p>Almost all of these people cultivated the water concept. At this moment, Lu Ming’s water concept began to improve as it was continuously refined by the nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>Only Xiao Hongyun, Xiao ning, Xiao Zhan, a ‘ke and a’ Lei were left.</p><p>The people of the floating mountain sect had all died.</p><p>A foul stench filled the hall.</p><p>Lu Ming turned his head and saw Xiao ning. He looked at Lu Ming in horror. He was so scared that he had peed himself.</p><p>Xiao Hongyun’s face was also pale and full of despair.</p><p>Xiao Zhan and the other two also looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>Brother Lu, are you a cold-blood Hall disciple? ”</p><p>Xiao Zhan asked.</p><p>“Cold-blood Hall? I’ve never heard of it, I’m not a cold-blood Hall disciple!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head.</p><p>not a cold-blood Hall disciple!</p><p>Xiao Zhan seemed to let out a long breath. He seemed to be very afraid of cold-blood Hall.</p><p>“Senior Xiao, I’ll leave these two to you!”</p><p>Lu Ming pointed at Xiao Hongyun and Xiao ning.</p><p>Xiao Zhan’s eyes were filled with killing intent.</p><p>“Father, father, please spare my life. Please let me off this time. I was blinded by greed for a moment. I won’t dare to do it again.”</p><p>Xiao Hongyun started pleading.</p><p>you said the same thing before. You two evil creatures. If I let you live, you’ll only harm others. I’d rather kill you myself!</p><p>Xiao Zhan strode forward with killing intent.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
