With a flash of blood-red light, a young man in a blood-red robe appeared on the other side of the pillar of heavens mountain.</p><p>This young man’s face was slightly pale, but he was very handsome and gave off a feminine feeling.</p><p>Hmph, master Xue Luo, you look like you’re half dead. Are the two fairies here to see you? ”</p><p>Yin BUPO sneered.</p><p>Each of the five beauties of the central continent was not only beautiful but also talented. Naturally, they had countless suitors, including many second-grade heaven’s favorites and even the five young tycoons.</p><p>There had been rumors before that Yin BUPO and blood Luo Zi were both suitors of goddess Tan Xiang.</p><p>At this moment, the two heaven’s favorites arrived. Everyone’s eyes finally moved away from Jing kongling and goddess Tan Xiang to Yin BUPO and master Xue Luo.</p><p>Today, the two of them were about to engage in a world-shaking battle.</p><p>Lu Ming also looked at the two of them. Whether the second-grade heaven’s pride experts of the central continent were on the same level as the Emperor God would soon be known.</p><p>Hmph, Yin BUPO, you managed to escape with your life in the last battle of Providence. Today, I’ll kill you completely!</p><p>Xue Luo Zi sneered.</p><p>“Haha, just you? You’re the one who will die today!”</p><p>Yin BUPO sneered. He let out a long cry and turned into a huge godly Eagle. The godly Eagle was covered with terrifying lightning power.</p><p>Yin BUPO was not a human, but a demon.</p><p>The sky Eagle castle was the demon clan’s power. Most of them were all kinds of Eagle-type demon beasts. Of course, there were also many other bird-type demon beasts, but most of them were Eagle-type demon beasts.</p><p>It was said that the lord of the sky Eagle castle was a powerful eagle Emperor.</p><p>Yin BUPO had the bloodline of the divine beast, the mysterious Thunder sacred Eagle, and the concentration of the bloodline was extremely shocking.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Although Xue Luo Zi spoke casually, he did not dare to underestimate his opponent. His aura burst out and a blood-red light shot up into the sky.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Yin BUPO roared and flapped his wings. The terrifying power of Thunder gathered and turned into a Thunder sword, slashing at blood Luo Zi.</p><p>“Blood River Divine Blade!”</p><p>Xue Luo Zi clenched his fist in the air. Endless blood light gathered and turned into a blood-red long blade. He shouted and slashed out.</p><p>The blood-red blade light slashed down and the void rippled like water. It collided with the lightning sword.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The sword Qi and saber radiance swept in all directions. Many of the weaker cultivators were shocked and retreated.</p><p>Lu Ming, Chu Kuang, and Zhang Wenjin stood still and observed the scene carefully.</p><p>Yin BUPO and Xue Luo Zi exchanged dozens of moves in the blink of an eye.</p><p>blood Luo Zi, I haven’t seen you for more than half a year. You haven’t improved much.</p><p>Yin BUPO sneered.</p><p>“It’s more than enough to suppress you!”</p><p>Xue Luo Zi sneered.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Yin BUPO sneered. He flapped his wings and let out a long hiss. The blood in his body boiled, and the sky was filled with lightning. The endless lightning seemed to fill the sky.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Yin BUPO’s wings seemed to have turned into blades of lightning, cutting through everything and slashing towards blood Luo Zi.</p><p>“The bloodthirsty’s world!”</p><p>Xue Luo Zi let out a long cry. His blood Qi soared into the sky, and a semi-circular blood light cover spread out. A terrifying devouring power spread out. Even from a distance, many people could feel their blood stirring as if it was going to leave their bodies.</p><p>cold-blood Hall’s bloodthirsty technique!</p><p>Chu Kuang’s face was solemn.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. He felt that this bloodthirsty technique was somewhat similar to the nine Dragons ‘devouring power. However, the bloodthirsty technique only targeted blood and was far less domineering than the nine Dragons’ devouring power.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Yin BUPO’s blade of lightning slashed at the blood-colored light screen, creating a deafening sound.</p><p>However, he was also affected by the bloodthirsty technique. The blood in his body was restless, and his combat power was affected. He could not use his full strength.</p><p>‘Squeak …’</p><p>An ear-piercing sound was heard. A giant bat appeared above blood Luo Zi’s head.</p><p>This bat was blood red all over, and its eyes were extremely cold, filled with a bloodthirsty glow.</p><p>Blood-winged sky bat was an extremely terrifying godly beast. Obviously, Xue Luozi’s bloodline was a blood-winged sky bat.</p><p>Around the blood-winged sky bat, there were eight bright and dazzling chakras.</p><p>Divine level rank 8 bloodline.</p><p>The bloodline level of blood Luo Zi was the same as that of the divine Emperor.</p><p>Xue Luozi performed bloodline fusion and turned into a blood-winged bat, fighting with Yin BUPO.</p><p>A terrifying force shot out and the space kept shaking as if it would be torn apart at any time. It was completely distorted.</p><p>The terrifying force spread out for thousands of miles. Many mountains were swept by the force and turned into dust in an instant.</p><p>However, most of the energy landed on the pillar of heavens mountains. It seemed like the pillar of heavens mountains was really made from the weapons of ancient experts. The terrifying energy landed on the pillar of heavens mountains, but it was not damaged at all. At most, it only left a few marks on it.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two of them exchanged over a hundred moves, and there was still no clear winner.</p><p>heavens, so strong, too strong! Is this the combat strength of a second-grade heaven’s favorite? ”</p><p>An old man at the great circle of the spirit embryo realm gasped in shock.</p><p>He had a feeling that with his cultivation of the great circle of the spirit embryo realm, not to mention exchanging blows with the two, even if he were to charge forward and get within a hundred meters of the two, he would be ground into pieces by the terrifying energy.</p><p>A martial artist at the great circle of the spirit embryo realm would not be able to resist at all.</p><p>their cultivation should be at the peak of the ninth level of the spirit embryo realm, but their combat strength is too terrifying. They’re probably close to the spirit God Realm? ”</p><p>even if they can’t really fight with a spiritual God, they won’t be too far off. If they break through to the perfected spirit embryo realm, they might really be able to fight with a spiritual God Realm powerhouse!</p><p>terrifying. A spirit embryo that can battle a spirit God. Too terrifying!</p><p>The onlookers discussed as they watched. They were extremely shocked.</p><p>Even a few spiritual God Realm powerhouses had grave expressions.</p><p>he’s indeed powerful. He’s definitely a heaven’s favorite on the same level as an Emperor God!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart, his gaze a little solemn.</p><p>Now he was sure that the second-grade heaven’s pride experts of the central continent must be at the level of sovereign gods. It was amazing that there were more than 20 of such heaven’s pride experts.</p><p>I wonder what realm the Emperor God has reached? ”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>Half a year ago, the Emperor God’s cultivation was at the peak of the eighth level spirit embryo realm. Now that more than half a year had passed, it was normal for the Emperor God to reach the peak of the ninth level spirit embryo realm. It was even possible for him to reach the perfected spirit embryo realm. If they met, he would still be a great enemy of Lu Ming.</p><p>“With my current combat strength, am I a match for them?”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly measuring his combat strength.</p><p>In the war of Providence, Lu Ming had suppressed the Emperor God by combining the inscription Dao and the Dao of inscription. However, the Emperor God had not been defeated one-sided.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming’s refinement path and martial arts were separated, his combat power was slightly weaker.</p><p>However, as compared to the battle of Providence, Lu Ming had cultivated the water concept. The fusion of five types of concepts had an astonishing power, much stronger than four types of concepts.</p><p>Even without the Dao of inscription, Lu Ming’s combat strength was still powerful. He was confident that he could suppress his opponent in a battle of the same level.</p><p>However, they were in the central continent now. In order to prevent his identity from being exposed, Lu Ming could not use some of his techniques. He could not fully unleash his dragon power either, which greatly reduced his combat strength.</p><p>In addition, Lu Ming’s current cultivation was only at the peak of the eighth level spirit embryo realm. If he were to encounter either blood Luo Zi or Yin BUPO, he would not be a match for them.</p><p>I have to improve my cultivation as soon as possible. If I reach the ninth level of the spirit embryo realm and reach the same level as them, I won’t be afraid of them even if I can’t fight the bloodline fusion!</p><p>Lu Ming kept thinking.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
