This palm seemed to be able to suppress the heavens.</p><p>...</p><p>Before the palm reached him, Huang Kui felt as if hundreds of mountains were pressing down on him, and he couldn’t even breathe.</p><p>“No, no!”</p><p>At this moment, he was panicking, shocked, and afraid. Lu Ming’s small palm was so big that it could cover the sky and the sun in his eyes.</p><p>He wanted to scream, but he couldn’t.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm landed on his body and a terrifying force exploded. Huang Kui’s entire body exploded into pieces.</p><p>This time, everyone was shocked.</p><p>Huang Kui was the second most outstanding talent among the younger generation in cold-blood Hall, but he was killed by Lu Ming with one slap.</p><p>kid, you do have some strength. But how dare you kill the talents of cold-blood Hall? you’re courting death!</p><p>die! Xue Luo Zi roared. He stepped in the air and a blood-red light shot up into the sky. He clenched his fist in the air and a saber formed, slashing at Lu Ming.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had killed Huang Kui with a single slap, blood Luo Zi was still confident that he could kill Lu Ming.</p><p>Huang Kui was only at the great circle of the spirit embryo realm, but he was already a spirit God. He could kill Huang Kui with a snap of his fingers.</p><p>He did not believe that Lu Ming, who had suddenly appeared, could be his match.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming made his move and it was still a slap.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Blood Luo Zi’s Saber Light was shattered by Lu Ming’s palm.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and dashed toward blood Luo Zi like a stream of light.</p><p>Roar! Roar! Roar!</p><p>During this process, Dragon roars rang out from Lu Ming’s body continuously. Dragon energy burst out one after another, and soon, there were five bursts of dragon energy.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming’s physical body was complete rank-9, he was extremely powerful. Even if he used all his dragon energy, there would not be any scales on his skin. He could control everything.</p><p>Five dragon energies burst forth, and Lu Ming’s strength increased rapidly. He activated the prison-suppressing heaven technique and struck down with his palm.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>In Lu Ming’s hands, the space was torn like a rag. The terrifying power made blood Luo Zi shiver.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Xue Luo Zi was shocked. Blood vessels appeared above his head and turned into blood-winged bats. With a loud roar, the space surged toward Lu Ming like waves.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s palm slashed across and the sound wave was split in half. A terrifying force exploded and slammed heavily on the blood-winged bat.</p><p>With a shrill scream, the blood-winged bat was sent flying, and blood splattered everywhere.</p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded and in disbelief.</p><p>A second-grade heaven’s favorite, blood Luo Zi, was sent flying by Lu Ming with one move. His blood splattered across the sky. This was simply unbelievable.</p><p>Who was this person? he was too terrifying. Previously, when he saw Lu Ming participating in the selection, he thought that Lu Ming was a weakling. Now, it seemed that Lu Ming had clearly hidden his strength. His actual combat strength was simply terrifying.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step in the air and used the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps. His figure instantly appeared on top of the blood-winged bat’s head and he stomped his feet.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The terrifying power exploded and the space was destroyed. The violent power hit Xue Luo Zi and he spat out a mouthful of blood. Then, his body collapsed and he turned into a human.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming stomped hard on blood Luo Zi’s nose. His face caved in and he fell heavily to the ground, creating a huge pit. Blood spurted out of his mouth.</p><p>Currently, Lu Ming’s cultivation was at the middle stage of the first level spiritual God Realm, which was slightly higher than Xue Luo Zi’s. In addition, his five types of intent realms were almost at the fourth level lower tier. With the five bursts of dragon energy, the power was too strong.</p><p>Moreover, after Lu Ming reached the spiritual God Realm, the power of the prison-suppressing heaven technique was even more terrifying. He could completely crush the blood Luo Zi without even having to activate his Blood Meridian.</p><p>“Stop! You’re looking for death, kid!”</p><p>The cold-blood Hall members reacted and charged at Lu Ming with furious roars.</p><p>Those who dared to attack Lu Ming were all in their forties or fifties. They had cultivated for ten to twenty years more than Lu Ming and the rest, so their cultivation levels were very high.</p><p>In an instant, five experts pounced on Lu Ming. Three of them were second level spiritual God Realm, and two were third level spiritual God Realm.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted, and two more bursts of dragon power erupted.</p><p>The nine Dragon bloodline was now at divine Level 7, and there were a total of seven Dragon powers, all of which were now erupting.</p><p>Lu Ming’s strength was extremely powerful. When he struck out with his palm, the world shook and the space shattered.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming threw out five palm strikes and exchanged a palm strike with each of the five experts.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The three second level spiritual God Realm men screamed as their bodies exploded. They were killed in one move.</p><p>The two third level spiritual God Realm experts were also severely injured. They spat out large mouthfuls of blood and retreated rapidly, their eyes filled with fear.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>Around them, the eyes of the people from the small forces almost popped out.</p><p>Initially, they thought that Lu Ming was a weakling. Now, they knew that he was clearly a Demon King.</p><p>However, they were overjoyed. The stronger Lu Ming was, the more beneficial it would be for small forces like them. They would have a chance to escape from cold-blood Hall.</p><p>“Swallow!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s left palm clenched in the air and the devouring power burst forth. The blood essence and energy of the three first level spiritual God Realm experts that were killed were all devoured by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Shaoqing, you’re Lu Shaoqing!”</p><p>Blood Luo Zi was still alive and shouted.</p><p>He had fought with Lu Ming before and recognized the devouring power.</p><p>“What? He’s Lu Shaoqing?”</p><p>Those who had heard of Lu Shaoqing’s name were shocked.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped on the air and charged towards the two injured third level spiritual God Realm experts.</p><p>The two of them were frightened and retreated at top speed. However, their speed could not be compared to Lu Ming’s. Lu Ming’s body was like a stream of light, closing in on them at top speed. His palm pressed down on the void and struck at the two of them.</p><p>The two of them tried their best to block, but it was still useless. The palm force pressed down, and their arms exploded. Their chests caved in, and they spat out large mouthfuls of blood. They were barely breathing.</p><p>“Little thief, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>kill! Xue Feng roared. The other experts followed suit and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>There were a few hundred people from cold-blood Hall. Most of them were middle-aged strong men with strong cultivation and combat strength.</p><p>Xue Feng was the most terrifying. Like a ray of blood light, he appeared in front of Lu Ming in an instant. With a punch, endless blood light flashed and spread, pressing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>This attack was extremely terrifying. Lu Ming’s expression changed and he also threw a punch.</p><p>The two fists collided. Lu Ming’s body shook violently and he was blasted away like a cannonball. He retreated 10000 meters and smashed a first level spiritual God expert into pieces.</p><p>“What powerful battle strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming felt his fist go numb and the blood in his body was in turmoil. He was a little shocked.</p><p>Xue Feng’s strength was beyond his imagination.</p><p>No wonder he was the top talent of the last generation of cold-blood Hall.</p><p>how dare you kill an expert from cold-blood Hall! No one can save you today!</p><p>Xue Feng’s killing intent was like a tide as he closed in on Lu Ming. Around him, there were flashes of blood as other experts charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Die! Lu Shaoqing, die!”</p><p>At this moment, blood Luo Zi had already struggled to get up. He glared at Lu Ming, his eyes about to spew fire.</p><p>He was actually abused so badly by Lu Ming. His nose bridge was stepped on by Lu Ming and was deeply pressed down. His face was beyond recognition.</p><p>He, the blood Luo master, had never been humiliated like this. His hatred for Lu Ming could not be described with words.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
