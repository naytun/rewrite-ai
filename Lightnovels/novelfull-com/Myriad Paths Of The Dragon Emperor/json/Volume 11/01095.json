Little Qing?”</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and his eyes suddenly revealed a cold killing intent.</p><p>From what he had just said, Xie nianqing was in the demon Realm. Moreover, Xie Zhen had sent people to kill him.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming’s killing intent was extremely strong.</p><p>However, he felt as if a huge rock had been lifted off his chest. At least, Xie nianqing was fine and alive.</p><p>Humph, I really don’t know what my father is thinking. She’s an alien, a b * tch born of a lowly servant. My father didn’t kill her directly or suppress her in the demonic flames of the abyss Demon Realm, but just imprisoned her in the abyss Demon Realm and let her fight with the demonic creatures. She’s really lucky!</p><p>Xie Zhen’s face was dark and his voice was cold.</p><p>“Eighth prince, what should we do next?”</p><p>One of them asked.</p><p>this b * tch hates me to the bone. If I let her live, I’ll always feel uneasy!</p><p>Xie Zhen said with a cold face.</p><p>“Eighth prince, in my opinion, you don’t need to worry too much. His Majesty the sage Emperor didn’t kill her, most likely because of the father-daughter relationship. However, the sixteenth Princess is a rare species, after all, and is a great taboo for our Sage Emperor clan. Even if His Majesty didn’t kill her, he wouldn’t let her out of the abyss Demon Realm. She will most likely spend her life in the abyss Demon Realm!”</p><p>Below, a person said.</p><p>that may be the case, but this b * tch’s talent is really too high. As long as she’s not dead, I can’t rest at ease!</p><p>Xie Zhen said with a dark expression.</p><p>“Eighth prince, should we continue to send more people?”</p><p>let’s wait for a while. The one-million-year National sacrifice will be held in less than two months. During this period, my father has not been in secluded cultivation and is paying attention to the big and small matters. It’s not a good time to make a move. After the one-million-year National sacrifice, we’ll send experts into the demon Realm and kill him in one fell swoop!</p><p>Xie Zhen’s eyes were sinister.</p><p>Creak!</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists tightly. He almost could not control the killing intent in his body.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>However, it only leaked out a little bit and was sensed by an expert.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved and he left the place. In an instant, he appeared a hundred miles away and returned to the dormitory.</p><p>He really wanted to slap Xie Zhen to death, but he knew that it wasn’t the time yet. He had to find the entrance to the demon Realm and save Xie nianqing. If he killed Xie Zhen now, he would definitely alert the enemy.</p><p>Now, he could only let Xie Zhen live for a while longer. However, Lu Ming swore that he would kill Xie Zhen sooner or later.</p><p>From then on, Lu Ming would find time to wander around every day and try to find out more about the abyss demon territory. Unfortunately, he found nothing. It seemed that very few people knew about the abyss demon territory.</p><p>Lu Ming guessed that the Tartarean demonic realm was most likely a plane or a secret realm. The entrance was most likely somewhere in the palace.</p><p>On the other hand, other than going out to inquire, Lu Ming would be refining the spirit refinement pill and comprehending the intent realm.</p><p>The divine refinement pill could not directly increase Lu Ming’s cultivation level. However, it could make the spiritual God more condensed and the spiritual sense would become stronger.</p><p>The stronger the spiritual God was, the more beneficial it would be for his future cultivation.</p><p>Three days later, Lu Ming was cultivating when Shi Fang came again.</p><p>Lu Ming walked out of the room and looked at Shi Fang indifferently.”What’s wrong? You want to get beaten up again?”</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Shi Fang’s face turned ugly. He snorted and said, ” “I’m here to inform you that there’s a mission. The eighth prince is going to the beast mountain to hunt. We need to go together. Let’s go!”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and strode outside.</p><p>Shi Fang looked at Lu Ming’s back and a cold smile appeared at the corners of his lips.</p><p>The Imperial Dragon guards gathered and followed Xie Zhen, heading towards beast cry mountain.</p><p>Beast cry mountain was a boundless mountain range. Countless ferocious beasts lived in it. It was a hunting ground for the royal family, and it was specially used for the Xie family’s descendants to train their cultivation.</p><p>The disciples of the Xie family would often come to the beast cry mountain to hunt. In fact, they would enter the beast cry mountain to fight with ferocious beasts.</p><p>There was a huge military camp outside the beast cry mountain. There were residences and guards.</p><p>“Shi Fang, you lead the Imperial Dragon guards and follow me into the mountains, but you don’t have to protect me. You guys split up and hunt, and we’ll compete to see who can kill more and stronger fierce beasts. How about it?”</p><p>Looking at the beast cry mountain, Xie Zhen was in high spirits.</p><p>“Eighth prince, how can we be compared to you?”</p><p>Shi Fang smiled.</p><p>“It’s fine. There are also experts in the Imperial Dragon guards. Try your best to compete with the half-Prince, and I will reward those who perform well!”</p><p>Xie Zhen laughed.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll bring them along!”</p><p>Shi Fang bowed.</p><p>“Then let’s go!”</p><p>With a wave of his hand, Xie Zhen led the way and flew towards beast cry mountain.</p><p>Shi Fang and the others also flew towards beast cry mountain.</p><p>“Could it be that you want to get rid of me in beast cry mountain?”</p><p>Lu Ming thought in his heart.</p><p>He guessed that Shi Fang’s big brother might attack him at the beast cry mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. If the other party was looking for death, he did not mind giving them a ride.</p><p>After flying into beast cry mountain, the group dispersed.</p><p>Lu Ming flew towards the depths of the beast cry mountain, feeling a little bored.</p><p>The ferocious beasts in the outer area of beast cry mountain were of a very low level. When some King-level and spirit sea-level ferocious beasts saw Lu Ming, they would run away without a trace with just a glare from him.</p><p>After half an hour, no one made a move.</p><p>“Still not moving?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. He sat cross-legged on an obvious Boulder and waited.</p><p>After two hours, no one made a move on him.</p><p>it seems like I was wrong. They won’t fight here!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He was a little surprised.</p><p>forget it, I guess Xie Zhen’s hunting is about to end. I’ll just kill a few to deal with it!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he soared into the sky.</p><p>Gah! Gah!</p><p>After a while, screeches were heard and a group of Silver Eagles flew past. As soon as they saw Lu Ming, more than ten of them screeched and pounced on him.</p><p>“It’s you guys!”</p><p>Lu Ming flicked his fingers and long Spears were formed, shooting at the silver Condor.</p><p>Pfft …</p><p>Five of the silver Eagles were pierced by the spear radiance. The remaining Eagles screeched in fear and fled.</p><p>Lu Ming did not pursue them. He used his vital essence to carry the five Eagles and flew back to the military camp.</p><p>These five Eagles were equivalent to the eighth level of the spirit embryo realm, which was more or less enough.</p><p>In the military camp, Xie Zhen and the others had already returned. On the ground of the military camp, there were ferocious beasts of various shapes and sizes.</p><p>the eighth prince is really amazing. In just a few hours, you actually killed three eighth level spirit embryo realm and three seventh level spirit embryo realm beasts. The eighth prince is indeed a heaven-bestowed genius. This lowly one is impressed!</p><p>Shi Fang stood in front of Xie Zhen and flattered him.</p><p>this is nothing. You guys can cultivate well!</p><p>Xie Zhen said humbly, but the pride on his face could not be hidden.</p><p>His cultivation was at the sixth level of the spirit embryo realm, and it was a pretty good achievement to be able to hunt three eighth and seventh level spirit embryo realm beasts in less than three hours in the vast beast cry mountain.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>All of a sudden, Shi Fang’s gaze turned to the horizon and he saw Lu Ming flying back, dragging five silver Eagles behind him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
