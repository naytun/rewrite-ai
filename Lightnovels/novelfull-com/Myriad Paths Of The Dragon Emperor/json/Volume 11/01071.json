The distance was far enough and the bloodthirsty vine should not be able to catch up.</p><p>...</p><p>“Dandan, what kind of treasure is that jade talisman?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked dandan. He was very curious.</p><p>“Take it and see for yourself!”</p><p>She opened her mouth and the Jade talisman flew out. Lu Ming reached out and took it.</p><p>Dandan didn’t have much interest in things that weren’t spiritual medicine.</p><p>“Dandan, your strength has improved a lot recently!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. Previously, dandan was able to snatch the Jade talisman from the bloodthirsty vine and escape with ease, displaying her powerful abilities. Lu Ming was very curious.</p><p>of course, that’s why I asked you to give me more spirit herbs. Also, the last time you went through a tribulation, I swallowed some Thunder tribulation. That thing was very nourishing and helped me recover a lot!</p><p>Dandan said with a smug look.</p><p>“The heavenly Tribulation is a great supplement?”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. This guy was really mysterious. Back then, when the Thunder cauldron was going through its tribulation, this guy swallowed the heavenly Tribulation in one gulp. At that time, it was still an egg.</p><p>“How is it? Have you been subdued by my divine might? In the future, follow this Lord well and serve him well. You’ll have a good life!”</p><p>Dandan was smug and had already started to feel smug.</p><p>“Go in!”</p><p>Lu Ming immediately grabbed dandan and stuffed him into the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Then, he looked at the Jade talisman in his hand and scanned it with his spiritual sense.</p><p>After breaking through to the spiritual God Realm and forming a spiritual God, one would be able to form spiritual consciousness, which was more effective than the eyes and could sense everything.</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming’s face lit up.</p><p>“The nine seals of the gate of God is a sealing art, a powerful secret art!”</p><p>Lu Ming mumbled to himself and studied it carefully. The more he studied it, the more surprised he was.</p><p>The nine seals of the gate of God. After a martial artist cultivated it, he would be able to form a sealing gate that could seal his opponents. When he cultivated it to a high level, he would be able to seal the heavens, the earth, people, and everything. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>“Amazing, too amazing!”</p><p>The more he comprehended, the more amazed Lu Ming was. He discovered the formidability of the nine seals of the gate of God.</p><p>This was a terrifying secret technique. It was left behind by an Emperor in the secret realm of the Saint mansion countless years ago. It had been lost in the outside world for countless years.</p><p>Lu Ming simply found a hidden place and entered the mountain and river diagram. He sat cross-legged under the path-understanding ancient tree and studied it carefully.</p><p>Now, the path-understanding ancient tree had grown three leaves, and it was even more extraordinary. It was surrounded by the aura of the great path, and people could enter a state of emptiness if they sat on the side.</p><p>Lu Ming was fully focused on understanding the nine seals of the gate of God. Slowly, a mysterious light emanated from his body. As time passed, the light began to condense and turned into a door of light. It was like a gate of God that led to an eternal unknown place.</p><p>Time flew by and three days passed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming’s hands formed a seal at top speed. A door of light condensed and flew toward dandan in front of him. The door of light glowed and enveloped dandan in an instant.</p><p>“What are you doing, nest?”</p><p>Dandan’s four limbs danced wildly as if she was suppressed. It was not until dandan’s entire body glowed and inscribed all kinds of formations that she managed to escape.</p><p>“The effect is not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Even the vampiric vine could not stop dandan. Her escaping skills were unfathomable and she was slippery. However, even dandan was suppressed by the sealing door for a while due to her carelessness. Lu Ming was very satisfied with the power of the sealing door.</p><p>If it was anyone else, they would definitely be sealed by the sealing door.</p><p>In a battle between experts, even if one was sealed for a moment, life and death could be decided.</p><p>Moreover, the power of the sealing door would increase as Lu Ming’s cultivation level increased. It could be one of Lu Ming’s killing weapons.</p><p>In particular, Lu Ming had just started cultivating and could only cultivate one sealing door. The nine seals of the gate of God could be cultivated to the highest level and nine sealing doors could be cultivated. That would be truly terrifying.</p><p>Every time he cultivated an additional sealing door, his power would increase by several times.</p><p>we’ve already wasted three days. We can’t waste any more time. It’s rare to enter the secret realm of the Saint mansion. We can’t waste it!</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming exited the mountain and river diagram. He randomly chose a direction and flew forward.</p><p>Dandan also climbed onto Lu Ming’s shoulder and looked around to see if there were any spiritual herbs.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A giant wolf appeared on a mountain in front of them. It was as big as a mountain and its body was silver white. It howled at the sky and the entire mountain range shook violently.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed drastically. He concealed his aura and landed on a mountain range below to observe from afar.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>All of a sudden, the mountain range beneath Lu Ming’s feet moved. It shook violently before it rose into the air and flew toward the giant wolf.</p><p>“Nest!”</p><p>It was only then that Lu Ming realized that what he was standing on was not a mountain range but a giant snake.</p><p>The giant snake was as large as a mountain. Its body was covered with soil, rocks, and trees. It lay there unmoving, like a mountain range.</p><p>the Titan snake … No, even if it’s not a pure-blooded Titan snake, it’s almost there!</p><p>Lu Ming wailed and quickly flew to the side.</p><p>Fortunately, the giant snake only had eyes for the giant Silver Wolf and did not pay any attention to Lu Ming.</p><p>OWW!</p><p>The giant Silver Wolf roared and stomped its feet. The mountain under it exploded and its huge body pounced toward the giant snake.</p><p>The two behemoths fought each other. For a time, the world shook and the mountains kept shattering.</p><p>what a powerful beast! It’s definitely not from the outside world. It’s a powerful beast that grew up in the secret realm of the Saint mansion!</p><p>Lu Ming stayed far away and did not dare to approach.</p><p>These two beasts were definitely at the advanced spiritual God Realm. They were extremely terrifying.</p><p>this secret realm is very dangerous. I encountered the bloodthirsty vine before, and now I’ve encountered two powerful fierce beasts. I have to be more careful in the future!</p><p>Lu Ming concealed his aura and flew carefully.</p><p>Not long after, he saw a few saber marks on a cliff. After studying them carefully, he realized that they were left by peerless powerhouses. If a saber practitioner were to study them carefully, he would definitely gain something.</p><p>it’s rumored that 30000 years ago, a Supreme expert came here to cultivate. This blade mark is probably left behind by a Supreme expert who had comprehended something while he was cultivating!</p><p>Lu Ming made a guess.</p><p>If that was the case, there would definitely be a lot of such traces in the secret realm. If he were to encounter something suitable, it would definitely be a great opportunity.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stay there for long. He did not practice swordsmanship and the marks did not match him.</p><p>Along the way, they discovered many spiritual herbs. Lu Ming only kept a few and gave the rest to dandan.</p><p>“There’s someone in front!”</p><p>A day later, Lu Ming saw a figure flying past in front of him.</p><p>They were not from cold-blood Hall, but from other forces.</p><p>There were nine light pillars when one entered the secret realm of the Saint mansion, which led to nine different areas. However, these nine areas were all connected and were all in the same secret realm.</p><p>The major forces began to enter separately in order to avoid disputes as soon as they entered. However, as time passed, the people from the nine regions would definitely meet.</p><p>Lu Ming guessed that he had already arrived at the other areas.</p><p>Lu Ming flew forward and saw many people gathered under a stone wall, observing and comprehending in detail.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and noticed that there were strange patterns on the stone wall. Upon closer inspection, there was a mysterious aura flowing. It was obvious that this was also a place where the most powerful person cultivated.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
