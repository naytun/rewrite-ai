He had been surrounded by halos since he was a child and was the number one genius of the heavenly demon Valley. He was known to be able to compete with the Emperor gods. There were few in the younger generation in the East barren who could be on par with him.</p><p>Although he was defeated by Lu Ming in the battle of Providence, only Lu Ming and the Emperor God were above him in the entire East barren. The only people who could be on par with him were blood Sword one and Feng Xuan. He was still a peerless genius with a brilliant Halo and was high above.</p><p>However, in the central continent, a Young heaven’s favorite he met casually suppressed him and even wanted to capture him as a Mount. At this moment, his self-confidence took a heavy blow.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Beams of silver sword-light cut through the sky and slashed toward ao tu.</p><p>Even though ao tu had the bloodline of a true dragon, he was still unable to defend himself. He was completely suppressed and torn apart by the terrifying sword Qi.</p><p>surrender and be my Mount. I won’t kill you. Otherwise, you’ll die today!</p><p>Song Fei’s cold voice came from the silver sword.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>Ao tu roared. With his pride, he would rather die than be Song Fei’s Mount.</p><p>“Then go to hell!”</p><p>The silver combat sword bloomed with thousands of rays of light. Sword Qi tore through the air as it slashed toward ao tu’s head.</p><p>Ao tu retreated frantically, using all his strength to defend himself. However, he was still almost beheaded, leaving a deep wound on his neck. His body shrank rapidly, and he fled into the distance.</p><p>“You want to leave? stay!”</p><p>Song Fei obviously had no intention of letting ao Tu go. He chased after ao tu.</p><p>At this moment, the cry of a Phoenix was heard. A divine bird that looked like a phoenix flew toward Song Fei. With a flap of its wings, flames filled the sky and spread toward Song Fei. Song Fei was shocked. Sword Qi whistled and broke through the flames. However, this delay had allowed ao tu to rush into the distance and disappear without a trace.</p><p>The phoenix-like divine bird had extreme speed. It flapped its wings and turned into a beam of light, flying into the distance. Song Fei shouted and chased after it, but after a while, he couldn’t catch up.</p><p>Lu Ming could clearly see that the phoenix-like divine bird was Feng Xuan. She had the Blood of the Phoenix and was astonishingly fast.</p><p>Song Fei returned to his human form and snorted, ” what donghuang the heaven’s favorite? he’s just a piece of trash!</p><p>After saying that, he flew back into the restaurant with the other two disciples of the heavenly martial sword faction and continued to eat and drink.</p><p>In the crowd, Blood Sword and corpse warrior were also watching the battle. Their faces were ugly, but they didn’t dare to make a sound.</p><p>Song Fei’s combat strength was shocking. Blood Sword knew that he was no match for Song Fei.</p><p>I didn’t expect there to be so many geniuses in the central continent. I heard that Song Fei is only the third heaven’s favorite of the heavenly martial sword faction!</p><p>Corpse warrior sighed.</p><p>The battle just now had shocked him.</p><p>the central continent is indeed the center of the divine wilderness continent. There are so many geniuses. In the entire Eastern wilderness, only Lu Ming and the Emperor-God duo can defeat Song Fei!</p><p>Blood Sword one nodded and the two of them left.</p><p>Lu Ming did not feel anything. He was not surprised by this result.</p><p>Ao tu and Song Fei were both third-grade heaven’s favorites, but ao tu was only in the middle. Song Fei, on the other hand, was at the top of the third-grade heaven’s favorites. He was close to some weaker second-grade heaven’s favorites. Ao tu was no match for him.</p><p>Lu Ming also returned to the restaurant and continued to eat and drink. Very soon, he received some new information.</p><p>The reason why so many talents gathered in Tianxia city was that the Tianxia Academy’s Wanxiang Jade wall would open in three days.</p><p>The Tianxia Academy’s Wanxiang Jade wall was said to contain endless mysteries. If a warrior comprehended from it, he could obtain great opportunities and gain great benefits.</p><p>There were even rumors that the Wanxiang Jade wall contained a great secret, a divine treasure.</p><p>However, it had not been opened for many years.</p><p>The Tianxia Academy’s Wanxiang Jade wall had never been opened to the public before. This time, it suddenly announced to the world that it was willing to be opened to the public. All the heroes in the world could freely visit and comprehend it.</p><p>This news naturally attracted a large number of heaven’s favorites.</p><p>“Wanxiang Jade wall? Since we’re here, we can’t miss this!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to eat and drink. The news that he heard next was not too important. He heard about which prodigies they were, how powerful they were, and which beauties were more beautiful.</p><p>After finishing his meal, Lu Ming walked out of the restaurant and found an Inn to stay in.</p><p>Three days passed by quickly. Lu Ming left the Tianxia city and rushed to the Tianxia Academy.</p><p>He was not the only one. All the heaven’s favorites stepped into the air and left. There were many of them. The sky was filled with rainbow lights like a meteor shower.</p><p>Tianxia Academy was very close to Tianxia city, so they arrived not long after.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>Looking from afar, Lu Ming was a little shocked.</p><p>A Palace as white as Jade was floating in the air, emitting a brilliant light.</p><p>This Palace was extremely huge, like a city in the sky. It seemed to be completely made of fine jade.</p><p>This was the core of the Tianxia Academy. Under this Palace was a misty divine mountain. The spiritual Qi was rich, spiritual herbs were everywhere, and spiritual beasts were flying. It was a scene of a Fairyland.</p><p>The endless divine mountains below and the White jade Palace above formed the complete Tianxia Academy.</p><p>However, only the core of the Tianxia Academy could enter the White jade Palace. Naturally, Lu Ming and the rest could not enter. They landed outside the Tianxia Academy and walked along an ancient bluestone road.</p><p>Soon, they saw a huge stone tablet with four big words written on it: Tianxia Academy.</p><p>The words were bold and powerful, and at a glance, there was a terrifying Majesty.</p><p>It was said that these four words were left behind by a Saint Emperor of the ancient Saint dynasty, and they contained the will of the Saint Emperor.</p><p>Tens of thousands of years ago, before the ancient Saint dynasty had declined and ruled the world, the Tianxia Academy was the place where the ancient Saint dynasty had nurtured its heroes. For generations, countless powerful cultivators had emerged from the Tianxia Academy.</p><p>However, after the decline of the Xie clan of the ancient Saint dynasty, the Tianxia Academy became independent and became a dominant force.</p><p>Passing by the stone tablet, there was a white jade staircase. Everyone climbed up the White jade staircase and came to a huge square.</p><p>At this moment, the square was already packed with people. At a glance, there were probably more than 10000 people, all of whom were geniuses.</p><p>“Everyone, the Wanxiang Jade wall is in front. Please follow me!” He said.</p><p>A white-haired old man appeared and smiled. Then, he flew forward and everyone followed.</p><p>After flying over dozens of mountain peaks, the terrain in front of them became flat. There were no mountains, only Hills.</p><p>On top of the hill, the clouds and mist blocked their view. Even with everyone’s eyes, they could not see through it.</p><p>“A formation!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>It was said that the Tianxia Academy was a force that cultivated both inscription and martial arts. There were strong cultivators who specialized in martial arts and strong cultivators who cultivated the way of inscription.</p><p>There were even rumors that there were more than one emperor in the Tianxia Academy, but two.</p><p>One was the Emperor of martial arts, and the other was the Emperor of inscription.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>With a flash, a total of eight old men appeared. Including the one who led the way, there were nine in total.</p><p>The Nine Old Men floated in the air and began to inscribe runes. One by one, the runes seeped into the surrounding space.</p><p>hu hu …</p><p>The wind seemed to have started blowing, and the clouds and mist began to dissipate. Soon, the clouds and mist completely dissipated, and countless people looked at the scene in front of them in shock.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
