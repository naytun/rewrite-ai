His aura was violent and his eyes were burning as he stared at the sky Vermillion fruits.</p><p>...</p><p>“Red shame venerable!”</p><p>The old woman exclaimed.</p><p>The other people’s faces also changed drastically.</p><p>Even Jing kongling’s expression changed slightly and became serious.</p><p>Only a spirit God expert could be called a venerable.</p><p>This red-haired old man was a spiritual God Realm existence.</p><p>now, these Scarlet fruits are mine. Get lost!</p><p>Venerable Chi kui’s eyes swept the surroundings, filled with killing intent.</p><p>The old woman and the other three’s expressions changed, their eyes filled with respect.</p><p>Venerable Chi kui was very famous in the nearby area. He didn’t come from any major power, but was a rogue cultivator. It was not easy for a rogue cultivator to reach the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Moreover, venerable Chi kui was famous for his ruthlessness.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Even though the old woman was unwilling, the sky Vermillion fruit was not worth mentioning compared to her life. She gritted her teeth and left.</p><p>The other three also left the place.</p><p>Only Chi kui Knight and Jing kongling were left above the lake.</p><p>“Jing kongling, you’re not leaving?”</p><p>Venerable Chi kui looked at Jing kongling.</p><p>“You can’t scare me, the pure spatial spirit, with your title as a venerable!”</p><p>Jing kongling said.</p><p>“You want to fight me?”</p><p>Venerable Chi kui’s eyes flashed.</p><p>“We can try!” Qing Junling said.</p><p>haha, youngsters these days are getting bolder and bolder. With your cultivation at the peak of the ninth level spirit embryo realm, you think you’re my match? ”</p><p>Venerable Chi kui sneered.</p><p>Venerable Chi kui had lived for thousands of years and had broken through to the spiritual God Realm for thousands of years. In the past, there was no young man who dared to be impudent in front of him.</p><p>After all, the gap between the spirit embryo realm and the spiritual God Realm was extremely huge.</p><p>But now, a young man at the peak of the ninth level spirit embryo realm wanted to fight him.</p><p>there’s always been a rumor in the world that this era is the golden age, and there are as many geniuses as clouds. Each and every one of them is incomparably powerful. I don’t believe that a mere ninth level spirit embryo realm can be that powerful!</p><p>Chi kui Zun-Zhe sneered as red flames burst out of his body. His terrifying aura pressed down on Jing kongling.</p><p>Jing kongling waved her hands, and more water true dragons appeared around her, pouncing toward venerable Chi kui.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The fire and the water Dragon collided, making a sizzling sound and stirring up water vapor. The scene was suddenly filled with fog.</p><p>The pure space spiritual Jade stepped in the air. Wherever she stepped, vines appeared and wrapped around venerable Chi kui like soft whips.</p><p>“Fire demon palm!”</p><p>Venerable Chi kui clapped his hands several times, and flames burst forth. The mist that filled the air was directly burned away, and the vines were also enveloped by the flames and burned to ashes.</p><p>However, more vines appeared in the air. At the same time, the lake water below churned and turned into water swords, slashing toward venerable Chi kui.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>After exchanging a few moves with venerable Chi kui, the pure spatial spirit was not at a disadvantage.</p><p>wood mentality, water mentality, shattering mentality, and pure spatial spirit. I can’t believe he has cultivated three mentalities!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>The pure spatial spirit was extremely powerful. It was definitely not weaker than blood Luo Zi, and might even be stronger.</p><p>break! Fire demon God fist!</p><p>Venerable Chi kui’s fists continued to blast out, and the flaming Fist force swept in all directions, displaying the terrifying strength of the spiritual God Realm to the fullest.</p><p>Wherever the fist force passed by, the vines exploded and the water swords were annihilated.</p><p>At this point, the pure spatial spirit was finally at a disadvantage. A spiritual God Realm expert was too terrifying.</p><p>“Void-breaking divine palm!”</p><p>die! Jing kengling shouted as she kept striking out with her palms. The palm Power that contained three wills turned into a blue palm print and shot toward venerable chikui.</p><p>The sky continued to shake, but the pure spatial spirit was still at a disadvantage and was suppressed by the flaming Fist force.</p><p>But at this moment, honored Sir Chi kui was extremely shocked.</p><p>these prodigies are indeed terrifying. I’ve only heard of them in the past, but I didn’t expect them to be even more terrifying than I’ve heard. They’re only at the ninth level of the spirit embryo realm, but they can actually contend with me.</p><p>Venerable Chi kui was secretly shocked, and at the same time, cold killing intent flashed in his eyes.</p><p>Since he had offended such a terrifying heaven’s favorite, he had to kill him completely. Otherwise, there would be endless trouble in the future.</p><p>“Come out!”</p><p>Venerable Chi kui roared as the bloodline appeared above his head.</p><p>He was going to activate his bloodline power and kill Jing kongling.</p><p>His bloodline was a large dog with flames all over its body. This was a Hellhound.</p><p>However, there were only two golden chakras. Venerable chikui’s bloodline was only at the second level of the divine level. His combat strength was slightly weaker than that of the bald man and the bearded man who had chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>Within the spiritual God Realm, he was one of the weakest. After all, it was not easy for a second rank divine bloodline to break through to the spiritual God Realm. Venerable chikui had also broken through to the spiritual God Realm by chance. His combat strength was at the bottom of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Therefore, for so many years, he didn’t dare to provoke the other spiritual gods. He didn’t expect that even a young man would be so powerful that he could fight with him.</p><p>The pure spatial spirit frowned and a round bead appeared above his head. Water vapor swirled around the bead and eight golden chakras shone around it.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming stepped into the air.</p><p>Lu Ming walked out and immediately attracted the attention of the two people.</p><p>“Lu Shaoqing!”</p><p>At the sight of Lu Ming, the pristine Spirit’s eyes lit up.</p><p>As for venerable Chi kui, he frowned.</p><p>Seeing the two of them fighting and still daring to step out, it couldn’t be simple. He was now very afraid of these young geniuses.</p><p>“Miss Kong Ling, how about we join forces? When the time comes, we’ll split the sky Vermillion fruit equally!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The ethereal spirit agreed without any hesitation.</p><p>She was not a match for Scarlet venerable alone and would probably have to retreat in the end. With Lu Ming’s help, she might be able to fight Scarlet venerable.</p><p>Lu Ming had the same thought. He might be able to fight against venerable chikui alone, but it was almost impossible for him to win. That was why he stepped out and joined forces with the pure spatial spirit.</p><p>“If you want to join forces to deal with me, I’ll kill you first!”</p><p>Venerable Chi kui roared as he turned into a Hellhound and pounced towards Jing kongling.</p><p>The pure spatial spirit also used bloodline fusion and turned into a Pearl. The Pearl grew in size rapidly, and with the sound of waves, it shot towards Chi kui Knight.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming burst forth with four streams of dragon energy. His body was like a stream of light as he pounced towards the hellhound. He activated the prison-suppressing heavenly art and struck out with his palm.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>With two loud bangs, the three parties collided. Then, the hellhound was seen staggering backward.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>Venerable Chi kui roared. He was actually forced to retreat by two juniors, Lu Ming and Jing kongling. How was this possible?</p><p>He roared and pounced at Lu Ming and the pristine Void Spirit again!</p><p>The bead shook and the waves roared. The bead seemed to contain the water of an ocean, which was extremely terrifying and could crush everything.</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm contained the power of the prison-suppressing stele and the five-colored will. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>the explosions continued, but the final result was that the hellhound was at a disadvantage and was suppressed. This result made the hellhound extremely shocked.</p><p>Although he was the weakest in the spiritual God Realm, he was still in the spiritual God Realm. He had never thought that he would be suppressed by two youths in the ninth level of the spirit embryo realm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
