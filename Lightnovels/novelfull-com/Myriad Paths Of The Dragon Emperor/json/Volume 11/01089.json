Unfortunately, she’s still a little lacking. I’ll give her some benefits and hope that she can gain something!</p><p>...</p><p>The Saint said.</p><p>Lu Ming was happy for fairy Tan Xiang.</p><p>Although this person had already passed away, he had been a Saint when he was alive, an existence that had surpassed emperors. If he said that he had given them some benefits, it was definitely not a small matter. Even emperors would be envious.</p><p>alright, little guy, since you can come here and pass my test, I won’t let you return empty-handed. I’ll give you some benefits and then send you out!</p><p>With that, the Saint waved his hand, and those images disappeared without a trace.</p><p>“Senior, wait a moment, this junior might be able to inherit senior’s mantle!”</p><p>Lu Ming said hurriedly.</p><p>“You? Hehe, little fellow, don’t talk nonsense. I see that you don’t have any mental energy fire at all, so how can you inherit my legacy?”</p><p>The Saint smiled indifferently.</p><p>“Has senior ever heard of the Twin forbidden spell?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Twin forbidden spell?”</p><p>The Saint frowned slightly, looking confused. He had obviously never heard of it.</p><p>“Senior, the Twin forbidden art is able to cultivate a second body …”</p><p>Lu Ming then told her about the Twin forbidden technique and what he had learned.</p><p>When the Saint first heard that the Twin forbidden technique could actually cultivate a clone that was the same as the original and could be cultivated wholeheartedly, he was extremely shocked. He had never heard of such a strange technique in the world.</p><p>After hearing that Lu Ming had obtained it in the battle of Providence, he was relieved.</p><p>It wasn’t strange for one to encounter any kind of fortuitous encounter in the battle of Providence.</p><p>This was because this Saint had also participated in the battle of Providence when he was young.</p><p>there’s actually such a secret technique in the world. According to what you’ve said, not only did your second body inherit your talent, but it also has no distracting thoughts. In this case, it’s really suitable for my legacy!</p><p>The Saint sighed, his eyes bright.</p><p>Back then, due to an accident, he was heavily injured and on the verge of death. He escaped to the divine wilderness continent and searched for this Mystic realm. In order to hide from his enemies, he still died here in the end, leaving behind his Saint heart and a trace of his mark.</p><p>The mark was attached to the saint’s heart, which was why it had been preserved for so many years, but it would disappear sooner or later.</p><p>When a powerhouse was about to die, they did not wish for their lifetime of cultivation and achievements to go to waste. They all wanted to find a suitable successor to pass on their legacy. Lu Ming was undoubtedly the most suitable.</p><p>“But senior, my second body is currently trapped in a place by an enemy. I’m afraid he won’t be able to come for the time being!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>“Oh? How about this, take this formation plate. As long as you give it to your clone and have him activate the inscriptions on it, you’ll be able to directly teleport here!”</p><p>The Saint took out an array disc and handed it to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming received it in joy and thanked the Saint again.</p><p>yes, my name is Tianxuan. You can call me the Tianxuan Saint. That’s all. I’ll send you out now. There’s no need to open this secret realm in the future. I’ll seal it forever and no one will be able to enter.</p><p>The profound sky Saint was about to send Lu Ming and the rest out.</p><p>“Senior, please wait!”</p><p>Lu Ming called out hurriedly.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The profound sky Saint was stunned.</p><p>“Allow me to change my appearance, junior still has enemies outside!”</p><p>Lu Ming chuckled and his body transformed again. After a while, his body became thinner and he turned into a young man with a pale face. Even his aura had changed greatly.</p><p>No one could recognize him now.</p><p>“Alright, I’m done!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The profound sky Saint waved his hand, and the space twisted. Lu Ming felt a force pulling him, and his body instantly disappeared.</p><p>At this moment, goddess Tan Xiang, Yang potian, and the others, as well as the people outside the Saint mansion, were all enveloped by a force and disappeared.</p><p>Tianxia Academy, outside the Wanxiang Jade wall!</p><p>The nine beams of light suddenly disappeared without a trace, and the myriad elephant Jade wall returned to its calm state.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>The crowd was in an uproar, and even many Supreme martial artists ‘faces changed.</p><p>“What’s going on? Why did the nine pillars of light suddenly disappear? those who went in haven’t come out yet!”</p><p>A Supreme from a large force said with an ugly expression. Many people looked at a Supreme from the Tianxia Academy.</p><p>I don’t know either. Such a thing has never happened before!</p><p>The Tianxia Academy’s Supreme martial artist said with a heavy expression.</p><p>“Then, can you open it again?”</p><p>A Supreme martial artist asked.</p><p>The Supreme from the Tianxia Academy shook his head, which caused an uproar.</p><p>There were many people from the major powers in there. For example, the strongest inheritors of the floating mountain sect and Devil Mountain were all in there. If they were to be trapped in there, it would be a huge loss.</p><p>On the other hand, the people from the heavenly martial Sword School and cold-blood Hall were gloating.</p><p>This was because their successor had been killed by Lu Ming and had come out a long time ago. The most outstanding geniuses of the previous generation had also been killed. Even if the remaining people did not come out, they would not suffer as much as the other forces.</p><p>At this moment, the space above the myriad elephant Jade wall twisted, and several figures emerged.</p><p>“They’re out, they’re out!”</p><p>Many people were ecstatic.</p><p>In the sky, more than 10000 people appeared. Everyone saw yang potian, goddess Tan Xiang, Kong Xin, and the other heaven’s favorites.</p><p>“What’s going on? How’s the Holy Prefecture?”</p><p>One by one, the Supreme martial artists spoke out with excitement in their eyes.</p><p>They had heard about the Saint mansion from Wu chengkong when he was killed. They were all shocked, but they were also looking forward to it. They wanted to rush in themselves.</p><p>An existence that surpassed an Emperor wasn’t just for show. It was simply too alluring, especially for many Supreme-beings. They were stuck at the Supreme-being realm and had never been able to break through to the Emperor realm. If they could obtain the inheritance or comprehension of an existence that had surpassed the Emperor realm, they might be able to break through.</p><p>In a flash, goddess Tan Xiang, Kong Xin, Jun Yue, and the others flew to their respective Supremes and explained the situation of entering the Saint mansion.</p><p>“What? You’ve all failed!”</p><p>When they heard that Kong Xin and the other heaven’s pride experts didn’t pass the test, everyone sighed and felt very regretful. But then, they turned their eyes to yang potian, Tuoba Shi, and the unscrupulous monk.</p><p>These people had surpassed the second-grade heaven’s pride and were heaven’s pride experts of the big shots. Perhaps they had succeeded?</p><p>“My hair is white, my Buddha is merciful, this little monk is ashamed, my heart is not strong, I still need to train!”</p><p>The heartless monk had a solemn look on his face as he chanted the name of Buddha, his face filled with compassion.</p><p>In the crowd, Lu Ming looked down on him. If he had not seen the monk’s true face, he would have thought that this fellow was a respectable senior monk.</p><p>The unscrupulous monk’s words meant that he had also failed.</p><p>damn it, that illusionary realm was indeed powerful. Even I couldn’t pass it!</p><p>Tuoba Shi grinned.</p><p>we’re on par. Tuoba Shi, let’s fight another day!</p><p>Yang potian said coldly. Then, he strode out of the Tianxia Academy and disappeared in a flash.</p><p>No one stopped him. Not only was yang potian a peerless genius, but he also came from the heaven suppressing divine Army.</p><p>The heaven suppressing divine Army was too powerful. It was the only force that could compete with the ancient Saint dynasty among the eighteen overlords of the central continent. It was even more powerful than the heavenly martial sword faction.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
