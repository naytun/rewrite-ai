He had a feeling that Shi Fang’s words were directed at him. However, he had never met Shi Fang before. Why was he targeting him?</p><p>...</p><p>Could it be that this Ming Lu had offended Shi Fang before?</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>After Shi Fang finished speaking, he turned around and left. Then, someone arranged their accommodation.</p><p>Lu Ming was the Deputy flag bearer and he had a small courtyard. There was another person who lived in Lu Ming’s courtyard and helped him.</p><p>This person was also a newly joined Imperial Dragon Guard. He looked to be in his fifties and was quite shrewd. His name was Sun Lin.</p><p>“Lord vice-commander, you have to be careful!”</p><p>Sun Lin reminded them as they arrived at the courtyard.</p><p>“Oh? What do you mean by that?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>Deputy commander, you should be able to feel that general Shi’s words are actually meant for you.</p><p>Sun Lin said.</p><p>“Oh? Do you know why?” Lu Ming asked. He was also very curious.</p><p>“Vice-banner Lord has just arrived, so you probably don’t know the rules of the Imperial Dragon Guard. In the Imperial Dragon Guard, everything is decided by strength. Those who are strong, as long as they make a contribution, can be promoted.”</p><p>Deputy Sir, your cultivation is at the seventh level spirit embryo realm, while general Shi Fang’s cultivation is only at the sixth level spirit embryo realm. Your cultivation is higher than his.</p><p>Upon hearing this, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.”You mean, Shi Fang is worried that I will threaten his position?”</p><p>vice-commander is wise. The reason why Shi Fang was able to get the position of the chief commander was because he had an elder brother who was the personal bodyguard of His Highness, the eighth prince. That’s why he was able to get the position of the chief commander and command five hundred Imperial Dragon guards. Moreover, the highest person in this banner was only at the sixth level of the spirit embryo realm, so Shi Fang was able to hold the position of the chief commander very steadily. However, vice-commander’s cultivation is higher than his. As long as vice-commander makes some contributions, it would be very normal for him to surpass Shi Fang and even replace him. Of course, Shi Fang won’t be nice to you. He might even do something to you in secret.”</p><p>Sun Lin explained.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. So that was the case.</p><p>However, he didn’t take it to heart. Shi Fang was just a mere Shi Fang. He could suppress him with one finger. There was no need to take it to heart.</p><p>After chatting for a while, Lu Ming walked into the room and sat down cross-legged to begin comprehending the essence realm of heaven and earth.</p><p>Previously, in the secret realm of the Saint mansion, Lu Ming had devoured many intent runes of powerful cultivators. Not only had he achieved a breakthrough in his cultivation, but he had also made progress in the intent of heaven and earth.</p><p>His Thunder mentality and wind mentality had broken through to the fourth level lower tier respectively. With the addition of his fire mentality, three of his mentalities had already reached the fourth level lower tier. Now, he was fully focused on comprehending the earth mentality and the water mentality.</p><p>There was nothing much for the first two days.</p><p>The Imperial Dragon guards were usually very free when they had nothing to do.</p><p>After all, they were all martial artists. They didn’t need to patrol like ordinary people. When they had nothing to do, they just needed to cultivate in peace. They would only be dispatched when there was an emergency.</p><p>On the evening of the third day, Lu Ming heard some movements outside. He ended his cultivation, opened the door, and walked out.</p><p>In the courtyard, there were two people. One was Sun Lin, and the other was a skinny middle-aged man.</p><p>At this moment, Sun Lin took out a storage ring and handed it to the skinny middle-aged man.</p><p>The skinny monkey-like middle-aged man took the storage ring. When he saw Lu Ming, he chuckled and walked over to him.”You’re Minglu?”</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>I was just about to look for you. Since you have joined the Imperial Dragon Guard, general Shi Fang will take care of you in the future, allowing you to reap the greatest benefits and lead a good life. However, general Shi Fang can’t work for free. You have to show some appreciation, understand? ”</p><p>The skinny monkey-like middle-aged man stretched out his hand and pinched his fingers. He then chuckled.</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled up. He understood now. It turned out that this skinny monkey was sent by Shi Fang to collect benefits.</p><p>Needless to say, every new member would be patronized.</p><p>He was really greedy.</p><p>“Tell me, how much do you want?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>you’re the Deputy. You have a higher position, so of course, you have to pay more. The others are worth 50000 raw stones, so you can just give them 200000!</p><p>Skinny monkey chuckled.</p><p>“Fifty thousand? Two hundred thousand?”</p><p>The smile at the corners of Lu Ming’s mouth grew wider.</p><p>That was really ruthless. An average person would need 50000 origin stones. To an ordinary spirit embryo realm martial artist, this was definitely a huge burden.</p><p>And to him, he asked for 200000.</p><p>This was two hundred thousand raw gemstones. It was not a small amount, and it was difficult for a normal spirit embryo realm to take it out.</p><p>It was a lion’s mouth.</p><p>“Unfortunately, I don’t have that many raw gemstones. Please leave!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“No? Don’t try to fool me. You’re a seventh level spirit embryo realm martial artist. Do you really think that you don’t have 200000 Yuan in your entire fortune?”</p><p>The skinny monkey-like middle-aged man sneered.</p><p>“Oh? Even if I have 200000 Yuan, if I give it all to you, what will I use to cultivate?” Lu Ming said.</p><p>“I don’t care about this. It’s your own business. If you can’t take it out, you’d better get out of the Imperial Dragon Guard as soon as possible. Otherwise, without the protection of the chief commander, you won’t even know how you died in the future.”</p><p>The skinny monkey-like middle-aged man’s face was gloomy as he threatened.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Lu Ming was so angry that he laughed and said,’I need Shi Fang’s protection. What a joke. Alright, get lost now, or I’ll throw you out!”</p><p>how dare you laugh at the chief commander? you’re so bold! You’re looking for death!</p><p>The skinny monkey-like middle-aged man shouted.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>you’re courting death! Lu Ming bellowed and took a step forward. His terrifying aura exploded and pressed down on the skinny monkey-like middle-aged man. The skinny monkey-like middle-aged man trembled as if he had been struck by lightning. He took a few steps back and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Ming, just you wait, you’re dead!”</p><p>The skinny monkey-like middle-aged man ran out with a face full of resentment. In the blink of an eye, he had disappeared.</p><p>vice-commander, if you offend him like this, I’m afraid Shi Fang will come later. Sigh!</p><p>Sun Lin sighed, a little worried.</p><p>“He’s just a clown, what’s there to be afraid of?”</p><p>Lu Ming said casually.</p><p>“Shi Fang is fine. However, his elder brother is the eighth Prince’s personal bodyguard, a first level spiritual God Realm expert!”</p><p>Sun Lin said, a hint of fear in his eyes.</p><p>If a spiritual God Realm master wanted to kill them, it would be no different from killing an ant.</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>Oh, ” Lu Ming replied indifferently. He looked calm and sat down on a stone bench in the courtyard casually as if nothing had happened.</p><p>Sun Lin was full of worry.</p><p>After a while.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The door to the courtyard was blasted open. Shi Fang walked in with a few trusted aides, his face dark.</p><p>“Minglu, you injured the other Imperial Dragon guards for no reason. I suspect you have ulterior motives. Why aren’t you obediently kneeling down to accept your punishment!”</p><p>Shi Fang shouted loudly, directly pinning a crime on Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at Shi Fang indifferently and said, ” what an idiot. I’ll give you three breaths of time to get lost!</p><p>“How dare you! You dare to offend your superior, and your crime will be doubled. Your cultivation will be crippled, and you will be expelled from the Imperial Dragon guards!”</p><p>Shi Fang shouted.</p><p>“Hehe, Shi Fang, why don’t you try?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
