It’s that bastard Lu Shaoqing …</p><p>Wu chengkong roared like a wild beast.</p><p>“What? Lu Shaoqing again?”</p><p>Lu Shaoqing is a killer. First, he killed the cold-blood Hall disciples and many other Masters. Then, he killed Wu Cang and now, even Wu chengkong!</p><p>hehe, two heaven’s favorites from the heavenly martial sword faction died at the hands of the same person. Interesting!</p><p>Cold-blood Hall’s face darkened. Why did they have to be involved every time Lu Shaoqing was mentioned?</p><p>“Lu Shaoqing again. Why? You’re not with Wulong and the others?”</p><p>The Supreme martial artist from the heavenly martial sword faction asked.</p><p>The Wu Long he was talking about was the number one heaven’s favorite of the previous generation of the heavenly martial sword faction.</p><p>Wu Long and the others have been killed. They’re dead!</p><p>Wu chengkong said through gritted teeth.</p><p>“What? Wulong and the others were also dead. Who was it? Could it be yang potian?”</p><p>The Supreme martial artist from the heavenly martial Sword School shouted angrily, thinking that it was yang potian who had done it.</p><p>no, it’s Lu Shaoqing. It’s all his doing. Senior brothers Wu Long, Wu Kai, and Xue Feng were supposed to work together to kill Lu Shaoqing, but they were killed by him instead. It’s all his doing.</p><p>Wu chengkong’s face was twisted as he explained the situation.</p><p>The scene suddenly became quiet.</p><p>Everyone’s faces were filled with shock. Lu Shaoqing was the one who had done all of this. He had managed to achieve such a feat despite the combined efforts of three powerful experts. This was simply too shocking.</p><p>“Another big Shot!”</p><p>An old man sighed.</p><p>The people of cold-blood Hall wanted to cry. It was so sad that they had sent such a god of death with them.</p><p>The secret realm of the Saint mansion!</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the giant mountain was shaking and the light was even more dazzling. Everyone’s attention was drawn back to the giant mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes also fell on the huge mountain. He did not devour the blood essence of Xue Feng and the others because the Emperor God was here. His devouring method was too obvious and he was afraid that the Emperor God would notice something.</p><p>Now was not the time to reveal his identity.</p><p>The light from the huge mountain became more and more brilliant. In the end, nine rays of purple light shot out.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Suddenly, a token flew out from each of the purple lights.</p><p>“The token of the Saint mansion, it’s the token of the Saint mansion!”</p><p>“Snatch it!”</p><p>“There are nine pieces, this one is mine!”</p><p>Instantly, the scene was in chaos. All kinds of auras burst out and rushed toward the nine tokens.</p><p>There was no doubt that the token that rushed out of the mountain was the real token of the Saint mansion.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Yang potian shouted in anger. His momentum was astonishing. He swept out his halberd, and dozens of experts screamed as they were cut in half and died on the spot.</p><p>Yang potian grabbed a token of the Saint mansion in his hand and scanned the surroundings with lightning-like eyes.</p><p>Everyone was shocked and didn’t dare to step forward.</p><p>On the other side, Tuoba Shi waved his Mace and smashed a bunch of people into meat paste. He then grabbed a Saint mansion token.</p><p>The others sighed. Knowing these two tokens, they could forget about it.</p><p>“I’m back in this piece!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and rushed to the nearest Saint mansion token. His terrifying killing intent burst out. Many people were enveloped by his killing intent and retreated quickly, not daring to fight with Lu Ming.</p><p>The power that Lu Ming had created earlier was too strong.</p><p>Lu Ming grabbed a Holy mansion token.</p><p>Yang potian, Tuoba Shi, and Lu Ming each had a token. The others did not dare to fight with the three of them and could only target the others.</p><p>This was a bloody battle, and it was extremely intense.</p><p>The experts of the major forces went all out to fight for the tokens.</p><p>A Palace left behind by an existence above the Emperor level was too alluring and attractive. Even an Emperor would go crazy if he came, let alone them.</p><p>People were constantly killed, and corpses fell like rain.</p><p>In the end, everyone from the Ji family gathered. Under the leadership of a fourth level spiritual God Realm expert, they seized a token.</p><p>The Tianxia Academy and the valley of medicine Masters joined forces and also seized a token under the leadership of a fourth level spiritual God Realm master.</p><p>Demon mountain obtained a token.</p><p>The most surprising thing was that the Emperor God had seized a token with the help of the space intent realm. He was so fast that no one could stop him.</p><p>There was also a baby-faced monk with big fluttering sleeves who looked harmless. He killed a group of experts with a single palm strike and seized a token. It was a shocking scene.</p><p>Even yang potian and Tuoba Shi looked at this monk with a solemn expression.</p><p>“The Holy monk of the Western Desert!”</p><p>Yang potian muttered to himself.</p><p>“It’s that unscrupulous monk again!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>The last token was in the hands of the floating mountain sect.</p><p>As for cold-blood Hall, Sky Eagle Fort, and sky martial Sword School, they were very unwilling to lose their tokens because their leaders had died in battle.</p><p>Those who had obtained the tokens were divided into several areas, far away from the others. The others were helpless. Although they were burning with excitement, those who had obtained the tokens now were all very powerful.</p><p>Only the Emperor God seemed to be the weakest, but he had the space mentality, so no one could catch him.</p><p>“This is the token of the Saint mansion. With this token, you can enter the Saint mansion!”</p><p>Lu Ming sized up the token in his hand and channeled his essential core.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The token of the Saint mansion suddenly trembled and glowed. A circle of light enveloped Lu Ming. Other than that, there were three more circles of light floating around him.</p><p>“Why are there three more rings of light?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little surprised.</p><p>At this time, the others also realized the problem. As long as they injected their vital essence, four rings of light would appear on the token of the Saint mansion. One of them would cover them, and three more would appear.</p><p>I know. These three rings of light represent that I can bring three more people in!</p><p>that should be the case. I’m guessing that there’s a large array set up around the Saint mansion, and only those who are covered by this light circle can enter!</p><p>Some of them shouted, and their eyes lit up.</p><p>Wouldn’t there be 27 more spots?</p><p>Many people looked at those who had obtained tokens, especially yang potian. Emperor gods had obtained tokens by themselves, so they had extra spots.</p><p>“Brother di, I’m willing to pay a high price to buy three slots. Is that possible?”</p><p>Yin BUPO from the sky Eagle Castle looked at the divine Emperor and spoke first.</p><p>“Yin BUPO, your appetite is too big. You want to buy three spots, can you swallow it?”</p><p>Some people were unhappy and wanted to buy a quota from the Emperor God.</p><p>“Brother yang,”</p><p>Some people looked at yang potian, wanting to buy a spot from him.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Yang potian coldly spat out.</p><p>Those people could only retreat.</p><p>As for tuo BA Shi’s side, there were a few other Northern Plains heaven’s favorites who had already taken up the spots.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
