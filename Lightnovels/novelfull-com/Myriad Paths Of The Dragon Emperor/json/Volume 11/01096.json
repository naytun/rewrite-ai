Ming Ziqi is actually so powerful that he could actually hunt five silver Condors of the eighth level spirit embryo realm in less than three hours. It’s really amazing!</p><p>Lu Ming’s return caused a wave of exclamations. The Imperial Dragon guards at the scene were in a heated discussion.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had only killed five demonic beasts, they were all at the eighth level of the spirit embryo realm. In terms of value, they had already surpassed Xie Zhen.</p><p>This made Xie Zhen’s face turn gloomy.</p><p>Beside Xie Zhen, Shi Fang’s older brother sneered.</p><p>“General Shi Fang, who is this?”</p><p>Xie Zhen asked.</p><p>eighth prince, this is the new Deputy flag. He’s called Ming Lu and has a cultivation of the seventh level spirit embryo realm!</p><p>Shi Fang answered.</p><p>“Oh, so it’s the new vice flag bearer!”</p><p>Xie Zhen’s gaze shifted to Lu Ming. When he saw that Lu Ming had only casually cupped his fists at him without a trace of respect, he felt even more displeased.</p><p>Xie Zhen strode towards Lu Ming and said, sub-banner Ming’s combat power is amazing. I admire you. Half-princes like people with strong combat power. Sub-banner Ming, I’m itching to fight. How about you fight with me? ”</p><p>“A battle?”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled up slightly.</p><p>that’s right. Fight with me. Use all your strength and don’t hold back. Don’t worry, you can’t hurt me!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>As Xie Zhen spoke, he slowly walked up. His body emitted an intense golden light, and his aura grew.</p><p>He had awakened a fifth level divine level bloodline, so his combat power was very strong. Ordinary seventh level spirit embryo realm martial artists were no match for him at all, so he was full of confidence.</p><p>At the side, the others scattered far away.</p><p>Shi Fang and his brother looked at each other and sneered.</p><p>“Make your move!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Xie Zhen threw a punch at Lu Ming. A golden fist ray howled through the sky and headed straight for Lu Ming.</p><p>A long spear was condensed in Lu Ming’s hands. He came from the black spear sect and he used a long spear.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>With a shake of the spear, the tip of the spear trembled, stirring up the wind and clouds as it pierced towards Xie Zhen’s fist radiance.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Xie Zhen’s fist radiance was pierced by the spear and collapsed.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Xie Zhen’s eyes narrowed, and a hint of killing intent flashed in them.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Following that, the golden light on Xie Zhen’s body grew even more intense as he continuously punched out. Endless golden light boiled and enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s spear trembled, creating spear flowers that bloomed in the air.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>A dense collision sounded, and the fist radiance and spear flower disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Back in ninedragons, Xie Zhen’s cultivation had been at the peak of the seventh level of the spiritual ocean tier. Now that more than three years had passed, and Xie Zhen was in the ancient Saint dynasty, he definitely had a lot of resources. His cultivation had risen to the sixth level of the spirit embryo realm, and his combat strength was indeed not bad. Ordinary eighth level spirit embryo realm cultivators were no match for him and would be killed by him.</p><p>However, he was facing Lu Ming, who was trying his best to suppress his power.</p><p>After dozens of moves, he still could not take down Lu Ming. Killing intent flashed in Xie Zhen’s eyes.</p><p>A 100-meter tall burly man in golden armor appeared above his head. He held a long spear and had five golden chakras shining, making him look like a god.</p><p>Xie Zhen turned into a ray of light and entered the body of the Golden-armored man.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The burly man in golden armor bellowed. The Golden spear in his hand emitted a dazzling light as he stabbed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The huge spear whistled through the air with terrifying might.</p><p>what a strong killing intent! He wants to kill me!</p><p>A cold glint flashed across Lu Ming’s eyes. If not for the fact that he was worried about alerting the enemy, he would have killed Xie Zhen right away.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and his body soared into the sky. The Spear’s radiance that was condensed in his hand grew rapidly. It became a hundred meters long and ten meters wide. He swept the spear at the burly man in golden armor.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two spears collided, and the entire camp shook.</p><p>The burly man in golden armor trembled and was forced to retreat by Lu Ming’s spear.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming rushed over directly. The huge long spear smashed down fiercely from top to bottom with the force that could split a mountain.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The long spear hit the burly man in golden armor heavily, causing his body to shake violently and he almost fell to the ground. Then, Lu Ming changed the momentum of his spear to a horizontal sweep, which landed heavily on the burly man in golden armor.</p><p>The burly man in golden armor let out a blood-curdling screech as his body crumbled and transformed back into Xie Zhen’s appearance. He spat out a mouthful of blood and retreated.</p><p>“How dare you injure the eighth prince! You’re courting death!”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Shi Fang’s elder brother, Shi Zheng, took a step forward and appeared in front of Lu Ming. The aura of the first level of the spiritual God Realm burst out from his body. A terrifying pressure filled the air above the military camp. Many people’s faces changed drastically. The pressure of the spiritual God Realm was too strong. Many people trembled and broke out in cold sweat.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was as calm as a Buddha’s face. He did not feel anything at all. He glanced at Shi Zheng casually and said, ” “The eighth prince just told me to use my full strength. I’m just following the eighth Prince’s order!”</p><p>“You still dare to quibble? the eighth prince is a precious and Noble man, and you actually dared to injure him. You have no respect for your superiors, and you deserve to die a thousand times! I’ll cripple you now and lock you in the heavenly prison to reflect on your actions!”</p><p>Shi Zheng’s eyes were cold, and a sneer hung on the corner of his mouth.</p><p>At the side, Shi Fang was even more smug. He glared at Lu Ming fiercely.</p><p>Behind Shi Zheng, Xie Zhen’s expression was dark and ugly, but he did not stop Shi Zheng.</p><p>As Shi Zheng had said, Lu Ming actually dared to injure him. He deserved to die.</p><p>“Hahaha, this is ridiculous. The eighth prince personally ordered me to use my full strength. I was just following the order and accidentally injured the eighth prince, but you still want to attack me. Who will listen to him in the future?”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily, not feeling the slightest bit of fear.</p><p>He finally understood that this was all Shi Zheng’s scheme. Shi Zheng understood Xie Zhen very well and knew that Xie Zhen was narrow-minded. If Lu Ming were to compete with Xie Zhen and win or even injure Xie Zhen, he would definitely die.</p><p>Even if Lu Ming did not kill more ferocious beasts than Xie Zhen, Shi Zheng would still find a way to let the eighth prince spar with Lu Ming.</p><p>Today, everything was going more smoothly than Shi Zheng had expected. The number of ferocious beasts that Lu Ming had killed had actually surpassed Xie Zhen’s. This made Xie Zhen unhappy with Lu Ming and he wanted to fight Lu Ming directly. There was no better outcome than this.</p><p>Before the battle began, Xie Zhen had already harbored the intention to kill Lu Ming. If Lu Ming’s combat strength was not up to par and he was not a match for Xie Zhen, he would most likely be killed on the spot.</p><p>If Lu Ming’s cultivation level and combat strength were higher than Xie Zhen’s, then Xie Zhen’s killing intent would definitely be stronger and Lu Ming would be dead.</p><p>Therefore, regardless of whether Lu Ming won or lost, he was dead.</p><p>“Audacious! Impudent! Who Do You Think You Are? you’re insulting the eighth prince! Your entire family should be executed!”</p><p>Shi Fang shouted from the side.</p><p>As for Xie Zhen, the killing intent in his eyes became even stronger.</p><p>A lowly ant dared to speak to him like that. He should be killed ten thousand times.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Shi Zheng’s killing intent burst out. He stepped forward and the pressure of the spiritual God pressed toward Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
