His aura was like a pillar that shot up into the sky, shaking the world.</p><p>He struck out a palm as large as a mountain, blocking Lu Ming’s path of retreat. The palm landed on the nine Dragons.</p><p>Lu Ming exploded with all his strength. Seven streams of dragon energy, five types of concepts, and the prison-suppressing heaven technique were also unleashed to the extreme.</p><p>With nine consecutive steps, Lu Ming launched a peak attack.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The Zhou family elder’s giant palm started to tremble.</p><p>The Zhou family elder’s face was extremely serious, he sighed, ” a perfected spirit embryo is actually so powerful. It’s simply terrifying. Since we’ve already offended this person, we absolutely can’t let him leave!</p><p>The Zhou family head and the other elder were also shocked. The Zhou family’s elder was an existence at the fourth level of the spiritual God Realm, but he was still sighing. It was truly shocking.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Zhou family elder’s aura became stronger and his palm force exploded.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The nine Dragons continued to explode and then collapsed. Lu Ming’s figure reappeared and he fell to the ground, coughing up blood.</p><p>The Zhou family elder was too strong. Even if he used all his strength, it would still be difficult for him to escape.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Zhou family’s elder appeared in front of Lu Ming and pointed his finger at him. Lu Ming could not stop him at all.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Streams of finger force seeped into Lu Ming’s body and a majestic essential core surged in, sealing all of Lu Ming’s essential core.</p><p>Lu Ming could not mobilize any essential core.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A small Pagoda flew out from the Zhou family patriarch’s glabella. The small Pagoda expanded rapidly and floated above Lu Ming’s head. It scattered down rays of light that entered Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming felt that not only could he not circulate his essential core, but even the intent runes were sealed. He could not even use the intent.</p><p>I’ve already sealed this brat with the essence sealing Pagoda. Be it true essence, bloodline, or intent realm, he can’t use them. He can’t escape!</p><p>The Zhou family elder said. One of his hands was covered in light and was sealed inside.</p><p>“You little thieves, quickly let me go, or else I’ll make you die without a burial place in the future!”</p><p>Dandan’s four limbs were retracted into the turtle shell, and a voice came from the turtle shell.</p><p>“Little demonic beast, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>Zhou family elder scolded. He used his true energy and squeezed, wanting to crush it.</p><p>But in the next moment, Zhou family elder’s expression changed. He realized that dandan was not moving at all.</p><p>hahaha, old man, you want to kill me with your pitiable strength? keep dreaming. Let me tell you, let me go now, and let that kid go as well. Otherwise, when I show my power, you’ll be dead!</p><p>Dandan laughed and clamored.</p><p>Dandan had taken a lot of spirit herbs recently and had recovered a lot.</p><p>The Zhou family elder’s face turned red. He couldn’t even crush a little turtle, so he said coldly, ” “I’m going to refine you in a moment.”</p><p>Then, he looked at the clan leader of the Zhou clan and said, ” this kid has been suppressed. He must have a big secret. I’ll leave the rest to you!</p><p>With that, the Zhou family elder stepped into the air and left.</p><p>“Lu Shaoqing, you’re in our hands now. Hand over your Grotto-heaven treasure and your cultivation technique!” The clan leader of the Zhou clan looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Hehe, if you want to kill, then kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was extremely cold. He swept his gaze across the Zhou family head, Zhou Xin, and another elder, causing them to shiver.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>The Zhou clan’s clan master snorted coldly. He reached out and sucked the storage ring on Lu Ming’s finger into his hand. He scanned the storage ring with his mind and after a long while, his face darkened and he looked terrible.</p><p>There were many things in the storage ring, but they were not particularly valuable. There was nothing rare or valuable that could move him.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. Most of his precious treasures were stored in one of the mountain peaks in the mountain and river diagram. He had set up an illusion-reality switching formation on this mountain. No one could find it except for Lu Ming.</p><p>It was dangerous to venture outside. He was afraid that the treasure would not fall into someone else’s hands if he encountered danger one day.</p><p>“Lu Shaoqing, hand over the treasure of the grotto-heaven, or I’ll make you wish you were dead!”</p><p>The Zhou clan leader’s eyes flashed with killing intent.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered, his gaze turning colder.”If I get out of this one day, I’ll definitely exterminate the entire Zhou family!”</p><p>“You won’t have the chance!”</p><p>The clan leader of the Zhou family said coldly. His essential core spread out and formed a ribbon, carrying Lu Ming as he stepped into the air.</p><p>Zhou Xin and the other old man followed.</p><p>Very soon, the Zhou family head brought Lu Ming to a cave and walked in.</p><p>The cave slanted downwards, leading to an unknown place.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that as he went deeper and deeper, the surrounding temperature was getting higher and higher, making him feel hot all over.</p><p>The people from the Zhou family tried to use their vital essence to resist, but Lu Ming could not. The terrifying temperature affected his body directly, causing him to feel a sharp pain.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not even frown. He allowed the Zhou family’s clan leader to lead the way.</p><p>They walked for half an hour before they reached the end.</p><p>They were in a huge underground cave. They stood on a cliff and looked ahead. Below them was endless purple-red lava.</p><p>The temperature here was terrifyingly high. The surface of Lu Ming’s body was turning red and he felt a sharp pain.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s current physical strength, even if ordinary flames were to roast him, they would not be able to burn a single hair on his body. Clearly, the lava and flames here were extraordinary and the temperature was terrifyingly high.</p><p>The temperature of the lava here was more than a hundred times higher than that of ordinary lava.</p><p>Not only did Lu Ming feel pain in his body, but the blood in his body was also boiling. He felt as if his soul was being torn apart and there were waves of intense pain.</p><p>“God-Burning Earth flame!”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He recognized the flame.</p><p>“Lu Shaoqing, are you going to hand it over or not? you’re a smart person. If you hand it over, I’ll give you a quick death. Otherwise, you’ll have to enjoy the taste of this God-Burning Earth flame!”</p><p>The clan leader of the Zhou clan said coldly.</p><p>However, the only response he got was Lu Ming’s disdainful cold smile.</p><p>“If you’re so stubborn, then I’ll fulfill your wish!”</p><p>With a push of the palm force, Lu Ming’s body fell toward the lava and happened to float above the lava.</p><p>hu hu …</p><p>The terrifying purplish-red flames surged and enveloped Lu Ming. The terrifying temperature seeped into Lu Ming’s body and began to burn.</p><p>Waves of unimaginable pain drowned Lu Ming, not only in his physical body but also in his soul.</p><p>Pain, unimaginable pain. Even with Lu Ming’s wisdom, he let out a muffled groan and broke out in cold sweat. However, the cold sweat evaporated as soon as it appeared.</p><p>hu hu …</p><p>Lu Ming panted heavily, gritting his teeth and persevering.</p><p>He had once stepped on the Heavenly King stele’s staircase and suffered countless attacks. Some of them had pierced his soul and were also extremely painful.</p><p>Similarly, he had cultivated the forbidden twin technique and his soul had to be split into two. That was also an unimaginable pain. Therefore, Lu Ming’s endurance was better than ordinary people. He adjusted his breathing and calmed himself down.</p><p>The Zhou clan leader’s eyes started to turn cold, but slowly, they were filled with shock.</p><p>Lu Ming actually withstood it.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
