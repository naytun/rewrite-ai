Haha, the heavens are on my side. Die!</p><p>...</p><p>The middle-aged man in the blood-red robe stretched out his hand and clenched his fist in the air. Immediately, five blood-red ribbons spread out like five soft whips and rolled toward the three of them.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The three of them erupted at the same time. Chu Kuang slashed out two cold blade lights towards two of the blood-red ribbons.</p><p>Lu Ming cast the prison-suppressing heavenly art and struck out two palms consecutively at the two blood-colored ribbons. Zhang Wenjing, on the other hand, slashed out a sky-blue sword Qi and collided with one of the blood-colored ribbons.</p><p>Five consecutive explosions were heard. Lu Ming was forced to take more than ten steps back. Chu Kuang was in a similar state. Zhang Wenjin was in a better state. She was only forced to take seven or eight steps back. After all, she was only dealing with one ribbon.</p><p>“A spiritual God Realm master!”</p><p>The three of them had a thought at the same time, and their expressions became extremely serious.</p><p>To be able to repel the three of them with a casual attack, it was definitely an existence in the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The middle-aged man in the blood-red robe was surprised that he did not kill Lu Ming and the other two with one strike. However, he was overjoyed soon after.</p><p>haha, the three of you can be considered third-class heaven’s favorites. Your qi and blood are thick. Kill!</p><p>The middle-aged man in the blood-red robe laughed and waved his fingers. Ten blood-red ribbons wrapped around Lu Ming and the other two.</p><p>This ribbon seemed to be light, but it was terrifyingly powerful. As it streaked through the air, it let out a terrifying whistling sound.</p><p>“Let’s go, charge out!”</p><p>Chu Kuang shouted. A seventh level divine bloodline appeared above his head as he immediately executed the bloodline fusion.</p><p>He did not dare to be careless in the face of a spiritual God Realm master, as carelessness would mean death.</p><p>Zhang Wenjin also performed bloodline fusion.</p><p>Lu Ming did not use the blood Meridian fusion, but he also burst out with three bursts of dragon energy. Each attack was extremely terrifying.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The three of them joined forces and launched a powerful attack, instantly destroying the ten blood-red ribbons. The three of them were about to fly away.</p><p>“Want to leave? blood cage!”</p><p>The middle-aged man in the blood-red robe still did not get up. He sat there with his legs crossed and struck out with his hands continuously.</p><p>Immediately, countless blood-red ribbons appeared in the sky, forming a cage made of blood-red ribbons, locking the three of them inside.</p><p>The three of them fought back. The blood-red cage shook continuously, but they couldn’t break it for a while.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>The blood-robed middle-aged man shouted coldly. With a snap of his fingers, three terrifying blood-red blade lights slashed towards the three of them.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The three of them tried their best to resist the blood-red blade light, but in the end, Chu Kuang and Zhang Wenjin’s bloodlines trembled non-stop and they almost turned back into their human forms.</p><p>Lu Ming also felt a burning pain all over his body. The qi and blood in his body were in turmoil and he almost vomited blood.</p><p>Fortunately, Lu Ming’s defense was terrifying and he successfully blocked it.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to increase the power of the prison destructive heaven technique. After a few consecutive punches, the blood-red cage finally collapsed.</p><p>The three of them quickly rushed out.</p><p>“You want to leave? No way!”</p><p>The blood-robed middle-aged man suddenly stood up. His entire body was filled with blood Qi. He raised one hand and slashed out three blade auras in a row. They crossed thousands of meters in the void in an instant and slashed toward the three people.</p><p>These three blade lights were extremely terrifying, as if they could split the three of them in half.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Chu Kuang was shocked and furious.</p><p>He had a feeling that he would die under this knife.</p><p>Huala!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s glabella glowed. The mountain and river diagram flew out and surrounded the three of them. Then, it flew forward rapidly.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The three saber beams struck the mountain and river diagram but failed to tear it apart. Part of the force was blocked by the mountain and river diagram, but there was still a part of the force that passed through the mountain and river diagram and fell on Lu Ming, Chu Kuang, and Zhang Wenjin.</p><p>Chu Kuang and Zheng Wenjing turned into their human forms and spat out mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled violently. His skin was cut open, and blood flowed out.</p><p>Lu Ming endured it and flew forward with Chu Kuang and Zhang Wenjin.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The blood-robed middle-aged man growled, but he didn’t pursue. Instead, after his expression changed, he continued to sit cross-legged and absorb the blood Qi around him.</p><p>The three of them flew for more than a hundred thousand miles and landed in a Valley.</p><p>After landing, the three of them sat down cross-legged and began to heal their injuries.</p><p>In comparison, Lu Ming’s injuries were not serious. The Dragon scales hidden under his skin blocked most of the force. After two hours, Lu Ming had fully recovered and the healing ended.</p><p>He took a look and found that Chu Kuang and Zhang Wenjin were still healing.</p><p>there’s still a huge gap between me and a spiritual God Realm powerhouse!</p><p>Lu Ming was deep in thought.</p><p>The difference between the spirit embryo realm and the spiritual God Realm was too great. There was a huge chasm between these two realms. Most importantly, the conditions to break through to the spiritual God Realm were too high. Ordinary martial artists or ordinary heaven’s pride experts could not break through to the spiritual God Realm at all.</p><p>Those who were able to break through to the spiritual God Realm were all geniuses among geniuses. This caused the gap between the two realms to be even greater.</p><p>In reality, the higher the cultivation, the greater the gap between the major cultivation realms would be. It would become more and more terrifying and difficult to cross.</p><p>Lu Ming was only at the peak of the eighth level spirit embryo realm. It was too difficult and almost impossible for him to cross such a huge distance and fight with a spiritual God Realm expert.</p><p>It might be possible when he attained the great circle of the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>the middle-aged man in the blood-red robe must have been injured. He’s recuperating now!</p><p>Lu Ming secretly thought.</p><p>If the other party had not been injured, they might not have been able to rush out.</p><p>After a few more hours, Chu Kuang and Zhang Wenjin finally opened their eyes and finished their treatment.</p><p>“Thank you for your help this time, brother Lu!”</p><p>Chu Kuang stood up and expressed his gratitude to Lu Ming. If not for Lu Ming, they would not have been able to escape.</p><p>“Brother Chu is too polite!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands.</p><p>that cold-blood Hall expert should be an expert in the first level of the spiritual God Realm. For some reason, he was injured, so he massacred the town and used the blood of the entire town to heal his wounds. We happened to run into him!</p><p>Chu Kuang analyzed.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Chu Kuang had the same thoughts as him.</p><p>However, it was too cruel to kill an entire town of ordinary people to heal their injuries.</p><p>The three of them chatted for a while before leaving and heading in the direction of the pillar of heavens mountains.</p><p>The matters of spiritual God Realm powerhouses were not something they could interfere with, and they did not have the ability to do so.</p><p>After flying for another two days, a huge mountain appeared in front of them.</p><p>The pillar of heavens mountain, as its name suggested, was like a pillar that pierced through the earth, piercing through the clouds. It stood among the many peaks and could be seen with a single glance.</p><p>Legend had it that the pillar of heavens mountains was a giant mountain formed from the weapon of an ancient Supreme expert.</p><p>There were still two days before the battle between Xue Luo Zi and Yin bu po. The three of them settled down in a small city nearby.</p><p>In the small town, people came and went, and it was very lively.</p><p>“This is the first battle between second-grade geniuses after the battle of karmic luck. So many people have been attracted!”</p><p>Chu Kuang looked around and sighed.</p><p>In the small city, the people walking on the streets were all experts. Any one of them had a cultivation above the spirit embryo realm, and there were men and women of all ages.</p><p>It was obvious that they were here for the battle between the two heaven’s favorites.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
