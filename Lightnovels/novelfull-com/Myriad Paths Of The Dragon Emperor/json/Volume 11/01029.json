Endless blood-red light burned and jumped around the bald man like flames, making him look like a demon that had crawled out of hell.</p><p>Roar! Roar! Roar …</p><p>The Dragon’s Roar continued to ring out from within Lu Ming’s body. There were six consecutive Dragon roars.</p><p>Facing a spiritual God, Lu Ming did not dare to hold back at all. He immediately burst out with six streams of dragon energy. Lu Ming’s body could not withstand the power of the six streams of dragon energy at the same time. His body became even more burly, and purple-gold scales crawled out from under his skin and covered his entire body.</p><p>His claws had also become like dragon claws.</p><p>The bald youth’s pupils shrank, and then he sneered, ” “Small tricks, blood axe strike, chop!”</p><p>The bald man stepped forward. The blood light around him condensed into a blood-red battleaxe. He waved the battleaxe and slashed it at Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fist and cast the prison suppressing heavenly art. Five intents erupted at the same time, blasting toward the bald youth.</p><p>The fist and the bloody axe collided, creating a terrifying vibration. The space was distorted, and a hideous crack appeared.</p><p>After a loud noise, Lu Ming’s body trembled and he retreated rapidly. He stomped on the sky, causing loud explosions. He retreated about a hundred meters before he stopped.</p><p>However, that was all. Lu Ming was not injured.</p><p>On the other side, the bald man’s body also trembled and he took a few steps back.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>The bald man roared, his eyes full of disbelief.</p><p>The bearded man was the same. He looked at the scene in disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually repelled the bald man. How was this possible? Lu Ming was only at the early stage of the ninth level spirit embryo realm. How could he have such terrifying combat power?</p><p>did you hold back your strength in the battle with young master Xue Luo? ”</p><p>The bald burly man’s eyes were filled with shock, which then turned into cold killing intent.</p><p>“First level of spiritual God Realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. This bald burly man’s cultivation was at the first level of the spiritual God Realm. Moreover, Lu Ming estimated that the bloodline that he had awakened should not be too high.</p><p>He stared at the bald man and didn’t answer.</p><p>“Brat, don’t think that you can fight me just because you can block one of my moves. Die, die!”</p><p>The bald man flew into a rage out of humiliation. His killing intent surged like the tide as he wielded the blood ax and slashed at Lu Ming continuously.</p><p>Lu Ming activated the prison suppressing heavenly art and attacked continuously, engaging in a great battle with the bald burly man.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Terrifying explosions rang out continuously. Lu Ming circulated his five intents to the extreme and blocked the attacks crazily.</p><p>Although he was completely at a disadvantage and was suppressed by the bald man, he finally managed to resist.</p><p>After more than a dozen moves, Lu Ming was forced to retreat thousands of meters. The bearded man was always behind Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With another move, there was a huge explosion. Lu Ming retreated quickly and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>In the end, he was injured, but his eyes were still extremely bright.</p><p>hahaha, so this is the combat strength of the spiritual God Realm. It’s nothing more than this!</p><p>Lu Ming laughed and mocked him on purpose.</p><p>The bald burly man’s combat strength should be at the bottom of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>In the spiritual God Realm, even those of the same level would have a huge difference in combat strength.</p><p>For example, those who had comprehended a God-level martial technique were much stronger than those who had not. This bald man had not comprehended a God-level martial technique and was only using a high-grade demigod-level martial technique.</p><p>Also, the comprehension of intent and the level of bloodline determined the strength of one’s combat power.</p><p>This bald burly man was not very strong in all aspects. Therefore, Lu Ming was able to withstand it. If it were another first level spiritual God Realm expert who had comprehended a divine level martial technique, Lu Ming would definitely not be able to withstand it.</p><p>“Damn it, kid, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>The bald burly man bellowed in rage. He was actually looked down upon by Lu Ming, an ant in the spirit embryo realm. This made the bald burly man go crazy.</p><p>A blood-red battleaxe floated above his head, surrounded by three golden chakra.</p><p>A third level divine rank bloodline was considered a very low level bloodline among spiritual God Realm martial artists.</p><p>The bald man transformed into a blood-red battleaxe and slashed at Lu Ming. The power was even more terrifying.</p><p>“You’re the only one with a bloodline?”</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele bloodline appeared above Lu Ming’s head, and his five Meridian cycles glowed.</p><p>Lu Ming transformed into the prison-suppressing stele and activated the prison-suppressing heavenly art, crashing toward the blood-red battleaxe.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele was knocked away, and the blood-red axe was also knocked back.</p><p>“Damn it, let’s attack together and cripple him!”</p><p>The bald man roared.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>blood Lion! the bearded man shouted, and a blood Lion appeared above his head. It also had a third level divine bloodline.</p><p>He transformed into a blood Lion and pounced at Lu Ming. He clawed at the prison-suppressing stele and sent it flying. The prison-suppressing stele kept shaking.</p><p>how despicable! Two spiritual gods actually joined forces to fight me. Aren’t you afraid of being laughed at by the world if this news spreads? ”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>“As long as I kill you and you say you can know, I’ll kill you!”</p><p>The blood-red battleaxe arrived in front of the prison-suppressing stele in an instant and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Suppress!”</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele glowed. This time, Lu Ming burst out all his vital essence and used the prison-suppressing heaven technique with all his might. The vital essence in his body was completely extracted in an instant.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele and the bloody axe collided, and both of them were pushed back hundreds of meters.</p><p>There was not a drop of essential core left in Lu Ming’s body. However, the essential core from the NA Yuan stone gushed into Lu Ming’s body crazily and replenished his essential core. Lu Ming’s essential core was instantly full.</p><p>“Kill, we must kill!”</p><p>The bald burly man was extremely shocked.</p><p>Xue Luo Zi had told him that Lu Ming’s combat strength was only slightly stronger than his. However, he now realized that Lu Ming’s combat strength was not just slightly stronger than Xue Luo Zi’s. It was a whole lot stronger.</p><p>It was unbelievable that Lu Ming could block his attack and even send him flying.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The blood Lion roared and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had just retreated and had no time to counterattack. The blood lion’s claw slammed heavily on the prison-suppressing stele, and the prison-suppressing stele collapsed instantly. However, the moment the prison-suppressing stele collapsed, a Dragon’s Roar was heard, and a true dragon flew out.</p><p>No, those were not real Dragons, but nine.</p><p>“Nine … Nine Dragons?”</p><p>The blood Lion turned pale with fright. It had actually seen the form of the legendary Nine Dragons.</p><p>The moment the prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline was destroyed, Lu Ming burst out his Nine Dragons bloodline and flew out as Nine Dragons.</p><p>The nine dragon claws stepped in the air, and a terrifying power blasted toward the blood Lion.</p><p>In its alarm, the blood Lion was unable to unleash its full power, and the nine Dragons charged past it.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate to use the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps to escape the encirclement.</p><p>With his current combat strength, he was not a match for a spiritual God Realm master. He could not even defeat one, let alone two. If he continued to fight, he would only die of exhaustion.</p><p>“Damn it, chase!”</p><p>The blood-red battleaxe transformed back into the bald man and chased after Lu Ming with a furious roar.</p><p>The blood Lion also transformed into human form and chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>However, with the nine Dragons form and the nine Dragons sky-treading steps, his speed was amazing. Slowly, he pulled away from the bald man and the bald man.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
