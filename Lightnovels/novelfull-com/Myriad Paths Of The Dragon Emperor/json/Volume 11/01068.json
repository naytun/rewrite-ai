His fists were like blood diamonds, shining with a crystal-like luster. With a punch, the space was shattered, and it was extremely terrifying.</p><p>fourth level spiritual God Realm!</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was solemn. Xue Feng’s cultivation should be at the fourth level of the spiritual God Realm. He was a very powerful genius with unparalleled combat strength.</p><p>Lu Ming’s entire body was surrounded by the five-colored concept, increasing the power of the prison-suppressing heaven technique. He threw a few punches in a row.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two fists collided and the sky shook. It was as if two gods were fighting. Then, Lu Ming was once again sent flying far away.</p><p>it seems like I have to use my third bloodline!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>Xue Feng was too strong. Even if his talent was not as high as Xue Luo Zi’s, it would not be lower than Huang Kui’S. He should have awakened a seventh level divine level bloodline. When he was young, he should have been a third-grade heaven’s pride.</p><p>If they were at the same level, Lu Ming could easily kill such a prodigy. However, Xue Feng’s cultivation was too high. He was at the fourth level of the spiritual God Realm, which was three levels higher than Lu Ming.</p><p>In the spiritual God Realm, there was a huge gap between each level, which was difficult to make up for, let alone a gap of three levels. Moreover, the opponent was also a top genius.</p><p>Kill! Kill!</p><p>In the surroundings, three men in their Prime pounced over at the same time. Powerful auras filled the air. They were all third level spiritual gods. Moreover, these three people were a level higher than the two third level spiritual gods from before.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming threw out a punch and exchanged three blows with the three of them. The four of them retreated at the same time.</p><p>Behind him, Xue Feng quickly charged over.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the mountain peak in the distance trembled. A bright light spread out, shocking everyone.</p><p>“That is … A door?”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>Everyone saw a door of light appear on the peak of the mountain. It was crystal clear and resplendent, emitting a brilliant light.</p><p>treasure, it must be a peerless treasure. Let’s go!</p><p>Some of the people from the small forces exclaimed. Then, they rushed toward the mountain peak with blazing lights.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>Some cold-blood Hall people also rushed over.</p><p>“Brat, you’re lucky!”</p><p>Xue Feng glared at Lu Ming fiercely. He actually let go of Lu Ming and rushed towards the mountain peak.</p><p>Although Xue Feng’s combat strength was strong, Lu Ming’s combat strength had also exceeded his expectations. It would be very difficult for him to kill Lu Ming in a few moves. If the treasure was taken by the people from the small forces, it would not be worth it. Therefore, he also rushed over.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>The other cold-blood Hall members also rushed over.</p><p>Xue Luo Zi glared at Lu Ming coldly and followed the cold-blood Hall disciples.</p><p>“How can I leave when there’s a treasure?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and rushed over as well.</p><p>Although Xue Feng was powerful, he still had a trump card that he had not used. If he used it, he would definitely have no problem escaping. Therefore, Lu Ming was not afraid at all.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>The sound of something breaking through the air rang out. Everyone flew forward, and after flying for a while, they discovered that there was no formation in front of them.</p><p>“That can’t be a medicinal garden, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked behind him. The area that he had just passed looked like a herb garden. That was why it was protected by an inscription array.</p><p>As they continued forward, a huge group of palaces appeared in front of them.</p><p>The palace complex seemed to occupy a large area, but it was very ancient and full of the aura of time. Many places had collapsed.</p><p>The mountain was right in the middle of the palaces. It looked as if the mountain had fallen from the sky and crashed into the center of the palaces, crushing a large area.</p><p>At this moment, the door of light on the mountain was even more resplendent.</p><p>He could vaguely see a jade talisman floating in the light door. The light door was a strange phenomenon formed by the light emitted by the Jade talisman.</p><p>“Treasure, it’s definitely a treasure!”</p><p>Someone shouted greedily and rushed toward the palace.</p><p>“Get lost, you bunch of ants, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>“Die!” Xue Feng shouted in anger as he continuously punched out. His fist radiance broke through the air and instantly, more than a dozen martial artists screamed as they were killed.</p><p>The others were shocked and quickly avoided Xue Feng.</p><p>However, there were many people from the other major forces, and some of them were experts. After avoiding the blood seal, they didn’t give up and continued to rush forward.</p><p>A few hundred people rushed towards the mountain peak.</p><p>Lu Ming followed behind at a steady pace.</p><p>The palace complex was not dangerous, and there were no formations either. The group flew over smoothly and arrived in front of the mountain.</p><p>This mountain looked like a tiger lying there. It looked very life-like, as if it was carved from a huge rock.</p><p>On the peak of the mountain, there were strange lines protruding, like petrified tree roots.</p><p>What a strange shape, what a strange mountain.</p><p>However, they didn’t have much time to think about it. Everyone’s eyes were fixed on the door of light and the Jade talisman.</p><p>The Jade talisman was right on top of the Tiger’s head.</p><p>Everyone flew towards the mountain peak. An intense battle had erupted.</p><p>The cold-blood Hall’s experts were extremely domineering. They charged at the people from the small forces, killing a large number of experts and staining Tiger Mountain with blood.</p><p>No one noticed that the fresh blood that was scattered on the mountain had seeped into the mountain and disappeared, as if it had been devoured.</p><p>“This Is The Moment!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He used the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps and turned into a stream of light. He instantly surpassed the experts of cold-blood Hall and rushed toward the light door.</p><p>“Brat, you still dare to come? you’re looking for death!”</p><p>Xue Feng bellowed and continuously swung his fists at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming took a few steps and dodged the fist radiance.</p><p>“Let’s attack together and kill him!”</p><p>Blood Luo Zi shouted and ordered everyone to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill! Kill! Kill!”</p><p>Some of the cold-blood Hall disciples charged at Lu Ming, while the rest continued to rush at the light door.</p><p>At this time, dozens of people from the other small forces had been killed. The remaining people were frightened and no longer dared to fight for it. They desperately retreated.</p><p>Cold-blood Hall had complete control of the battle.</p><p>Xue Feng’s speed was the fastest. Just as he was about to rush out of the light door, his eyes revealed a burning flame.</p><p>This jade talisman was definitely a valuable treasure. It might be a powerful inheritance.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, a dark light shot out from the mountain and swept towards Xue Feng.</p><p>Xue Feng was shocked and immediately threw out a few punches to block the black light.</p><p>“A tree root, no, a vine!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. He realized that the thing that attacked Xue Feng was a vine.</p><p>“Who dares to stop me? you’re courting death!”</p><p>Xue Feng roared as he punched out with both fists, wanting to crush everything.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had already exchanged more than a dozen moves with the cold-blood Hall people.</p><p>There were more than a dozen people surrounding Lu Ming. There were a few powerful experts.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Blood light filled the air as the experts of cold-blood Hall activated their bloodlines.</p><p>Three of them had fifth level divine level bloodlines and their cultivation was at the third level of the spiritual God Realm. They were the most powerful and had astonishing combat strength. These three were the main forces to fight against Lu Ming.</p><p>Some of the others had fourth or third level divine level bloodlines and their cultivation levels were in the second or third tier of the spiritual God Realm. They were the elites of cold-blood Hall and had strong combat strength, but Lu Ming could handle them easily.</p><p>They were mainly three experts with divine level rank 5 bloodlines.</p><p>A fifth level divine level expert was already very talented and had powerful combat strength. In addition, his cultivation was two levels higher than Lu Ming’s. When the three of them joined forces, their combat strength was naturally astonishing.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
