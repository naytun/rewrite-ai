It had only been a few minutes since Lu Ming rushed out of the underground cave and started his tribulation transcendence.</p><p>no, please let them go. They are innocent!</p><p>The clan leader of the Zhou family was in Lu Ming’s hands. Even if there were lightning bolts that struck him, they were all destroyed by Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, his heart was filled with despair and incomparable regret.</p><p>He regretted it. He regretted being so greedy for Lu Ming’s treasures. He did not expect Lu Ming to be so freakish. He was suppressed in the God-burning earthly flame, but he could still break through and even attract the lightning tribulation.</p><p>This was unbelievable.</p><p>However, it was too late to regret. He only hoped that Lu Ming would let the Zhou family off.</p><p>However, at this moment, Lu Ming’s killing intent was unimaginably strong. He only wanted to destroy and kill everyone in the Zhou family to take revenge for the suffering he had suffered this year.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>There was only coldness in Lu Ming’s eyes. In his mind, there were constant roars.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and shouted. The nine Dragons ‘bloodline roared and the terrifying devouring power burst forth, enveloping all the Zhou family members.</p><p>“Ah, ah, don’t!”</p><p>“Help!”</p><p>Screams rose and fell. One by one, the essence, Qi, and spirit of the Zhou family members were devoured, turning into dried corpses.</p><p>All the blood essence, vital essence, and energy were devoured by the nine Dragon bloodlines. They were constantly refined into vital essence and poured into the spirit God.</p><p>“No, no, no!”</p><p>the Zhou family head’s eyes were dazed as he watched everything.</p><p>Almost all the disciples of the Zhou clan were dead. The Yan Gu mountain was covered with corpses.</p><p>No, there was one more person who was limply lying on a mountain peak with a dull look in her eyes. It was Zhou Xin.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s killing intent was overwhelming and he was affected by the third bloodline, he still retained a trace of rationality and deliberately made Zhou Xin stay.</p><p>He took a step forward and appeared not too far away from Zhou Xin.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At that moment, there were still lightning creatures pouncing at Lu Ming, but they could not do anything to him.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was too strong. He had cultivated five types of heaven and earth intent realms and had an outburst of dragon energy. The most terrifying thing was that the trace of energy that had surged into his third bloodline not only made Lu Ming’s killing intent surge, but his combat strength had also become more terrifying. He could easily withstand the lightning punishment.</p><p>“Do you regret this?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. His blood-red eyes were fixed on Zhou Xin.</p><p>Zhou Xin looked at the clan leader of the Zhou family in a daze and then at Lu Ming. that’s right. It’s all our fault. It’s karma. This is karma. We’ve brought this upon ourselves. We can’t live!</p><p>xiner, it’s all my fault. Lu Shaoqing, I’m begging you. I’m begging you to spare xiner. It’s all my fault!</p><p>The clan leader of the Zhou clan shouted.</p><p>“You all deserve to die!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold and he was unmoved.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, he threw the clan leader of the Zhou clan out. A bolt of lightning struck down, and the clan leader of the Zhou clan turned into ashes.</p><p>“Father!”</p><p>Zhou Xin called out.</p><p>Zhou Xin, you gave me the purple jade back then. There are spatial stones in the purple jade, which are of great use to me. However, I’ve saved your life twice after that. That’s enough to make up for the spatial stones you gave me. After that, you guys attacked me and suppressed me. Today, it’s only natural for me to kill you. Everything is your own fault. You should kill yourself!</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was cold. He had no intention of letting Zhou Xin off.</p><p>“Haha, good, then let me follow my father!”</p><p>Zhou Xin laughed bitterly. Her body suddenly moved and she charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Chi la!</p><p>The lightning struck Zhou Xin and she was reduced to ashes.</p><p>At this point, the Zhou family was almost completely dead.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The lightning tribulation was still continuing, and it was getting stronger and stronger.</p><p>Lu Ming punched continuously, blowing up a few Thunder-shaped creatures. At the same time, he refined the blood essence and primordial Qi of the Zhou family members into his own primordial Qi in his nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>Lu Ming’s spiritual God was becoming fuller and more solid.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming poured the energy of the blood essence into the third bloodline. However, he realized that the third bloodline did not absorb the energy of the blood essence at all.</p><p>what’s going on? why aren’t you absorbing it? ”</p><p>Lu Ming had initially thought that the third bloodline did not have a Meridian cycle. It was like the nine Dragons bloodline in the past, where it needed blood essence energy to level up. Now, it seemed that it was not the same at all.</p><p>The third bloodline seemed to be the same as well. It did not have a chakra.</p><p>Since the third bloodline could not be absorbed, Lu Ming transferred the energy of the blood essence to the second bloodline and let the prison-suppressing stele bloodline absorb it.</p><p>“Not enough, the energy is still not enough!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out the Zhou family patriarch’s storage ring. With a thought, a huge pile of raw gemstones appeared. There were at least a million of them. They were devoured by the nine Dragons and continued to refine.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>As time passed, the power of the lightning tribulation grew stronger and stronger. However, Lu Ming still managed to block all of them.</p><p>After 15 minutes, the dark clouds in the sky finally disappeared, and the lightning disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming had finally survived the lightning tribulation and become a spiritual God.</p><p>The lightning tribulation that was difficult for others was not difficult for Lu Ming.</p><p>Once the lightning tribulation was over, the endless spirit Qi in the world gathered toward Lu Ming. Lu Ming’s aura rose rapidly.</p><p>“Let’s leave this place!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved and he disappeared from the place.</p><p>A few hours later, Lu Ming was sitting cross-legged on a mountain peak a few million miles away.</p><p>At this moment, his aura had already stabilized, and he had officially stepped into the spiritual God Realm, first level spiritual God.</p><p>At this moment, all the blood was absorbed into Lu Ming’s body. His hair turned black once again. When he opened his eyes, he became calm, pure, and free of any killing intent.</p><p>phew, the third bloodline, so powerful!</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a long sigh of relief.</p><p>The vast and endless killing intent was too shocking. Previously, Lu Ming had almost been controlled by it.</p><p>it’s because I have a strong desire to kill the Zhou family. Otherwise, I should be able to control this power!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered secretly.</p><p>Previously, he already had a strong killing intent towards the Zhou family. With the addition of the third bloodline, he was almost overwhelmed by the killing intent, which led to him almost killing the entire Zhou family.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s original personality, he would not have gone so far. At most, he would have killed the higher-ups of the Zhou family. He would have let off those of lower cultivation levels. However, when he was faced with the tide-like killing intent earlier, he only wanted to kill. He wanted to kill everyone in the Zhou family to vent his hatred.</p><p>However, what had happened had already happened. Lu Ming would not regret it.</p><p>Since the Zhou family had treated him that way and suppressed him for a year, he had to bear the consequences.</p><p>“What exactly is this third bloodline? A drop of blood? But there’s such a vast power inside?”</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had only borrowed a trace of the power, but his strength had increased greatly. However, his will had almost been crushed by the killing intent. This made Lu Ming shiver in fear. He had to be careful when he used his third bloodline in the future.</p><p>If he were to borrow even more power, his mind would probably be drowned by boundless killing intent in an instant and he would become a puppet that only knew how to kill.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
