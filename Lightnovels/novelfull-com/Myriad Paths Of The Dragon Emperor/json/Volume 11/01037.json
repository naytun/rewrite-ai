Also, I haven’t sorted out the storage rings I obtained from the opponents I killed during this period of time. I’ll sort them out when I’m free. I hope I’ll be able to find something!</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming had to stock up some raw gemstones now. He would definitely need a huge number of them when he broke through to the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming exited the mountain and river diagram and continued to fly deeper into the herb garden.</p><p>With the increase in his cultivation level, Lu Ming was much more confident. He flew at a high speed.</p><p>Before long, he had flown a full 100000 li and had already arrived at the depths of the medicine garden.</p><p>Although this medicine garden was very large, it was only a few hundred thousand miles.</p><p>Along the way, dandan harvested a lot of spirit herbs again.</p><p>“Yi!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression suddenly changed. There was a green light spreading out in front of him.</p><p>“Lu Ming, then … There’s definitely a rare elixir. Charge, charge!”</p><p>Dandan’s eyes lit up and she shouted excitedly.</p><p>don’t worry. If there really is a rare spiritual medicine there, it will definitely attract some experts. It won’t be easy to get it!</p><p>Lu Ming said. However, he was still curious and flew in the direction of the light.</p><p>Ten thousand miles later, he saw a huge mountain, but when he arrived, the light disappeared again.</p><p>“Eh? Why isn’t there anyone here?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. This was different from what he had imagined. Since there was a light that could be seen from thousands of miles away, why did no one come?</p><p>Strange?</p><p>“What a strong medicinal fragrance!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s nose twitched and he looked at the mountains in front of him. Dandan’s eyes were shining.</p><p>Lu Ming flew over and discovered a wide Valley in the middle of a mountain range. In the valley, there were trees that were more than ten meters tall.</p><p>However, the strange thing was that these trees were bare without a single leaf. Even the branches seemed to have dried up. However, at the top of each tree, there was a fruit. A strong fragrance was emitted from the fruit.</p><p>Each tree only had one fruit. It was as if the energy essence of each tree had been used to nurture this fruit.</p><p>“This is … The spirit refining fruit!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils suddenly widened, bursting with scorching flames.</p><p>His heart began to burn with passion.</p><p>It was actually the spirit refining fruit? Lu Ming felt that his breathing had become heavy.</p><p>The spirit refining fruit was a spirit fruit that was even more precious than the sky Vermillion fruit. In a sense, it was many times more precious.</p><p>This was because the spirit refining fruit could refine a spirit God!</p><p>That’s right, when a spiritual God Realm master consumed it, it could condense the spiritual God and make it more solid.</p><p>In fact, in order to reach the spiritual God Realm, one had to comprehend the essence realm of heaven and earth, and also the process of condensing the spiritual God.</p><p>The spirit refining fruit had a Fatal Attraction to spiritual God experts.</p><p>But to a spirit embryo realm martial artist, the temptation might be even greater.</p><p>This was because when a martial artist at the great circle of the spirit embryo stage consumed the spirit refining fruit, the medicinal effects would seep into the spirit embryo. The moment they broke through to the spirit God stage, the spirit God would emerge from the spirit embryo and would be even more condensed.</p><p>To break through to the spiritual God Realm, one had to go through the heavenly Tribulation. The more solid one’s spiritual God was, the higher the chances of passing the heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>To a martial artist with a perfect spirit embryo realm, this was a Supreme treasure. It was no wonder that Lu Ming was so excited.</p><p>In the valley below, there were more than a hundred spirit refining fruit trees. This also meant that there were more than a hundred spirit refining fruits. If this news were to spread, all the martial artists at the great circle of the spirit embryo realm would go crazy.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, you’re rich with so many spirit-refining fruits!”</p><p>Dandan grinned, extremely excited.</p><p>“Why didn’t anyone come?”</p><p>Lu Ming did not completely lose his mind because of the soul-refining fruit. The light was so dazzling just now. Why was there no one around? was he the first one to arrive?</p><p>“I don’t care!”</p><p>Lu Ming planned to pick the spirit refining fruit first.</p><p>“Brother Lu, wait!”</p><p>At this moment, a familiar voice rang out.</p><p>“Pure spatial spirit!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He could tell that it was a clear and ethereal voice.</p><p>One of the mountain peaks below suddenly rippled, and two figures appeared.</p><p>There were two extremely beautiful women, the goddess of sandalwood, sandalwood, and the pure spirit.</p><p>The fluctuations just now were clearly an array set up by fairy Tan Xiang. Lu Ming did not expect to meet the two of them here.</p><p>“Brother Lu, come down for a chat!”</p><p>The pristine Void Spirit spoke and continued to transmit his voice to Lu Ming, as if he was afraid that others would hear him.</p><p>Lu Ming flew down and entered the array. It was only then that he realized that fairy Tan Xiang had set up an illusory array.</p><p>“Fairy, miss Kong Ling, what’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>From the looks of it, Tan Xiang fairy and Jing kongling should have arrived a long time ago. But why didn’t they pick the spirit refining fruit? why did they hide on this mountain and use an array to conceal themselves?</p><p>there are a lot of bloodghost spiders on the spiritual refinement fruit tree. There are even spiritual god level bloodghost spiders. Those who went in before are all dead!</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang explained.</p><p>“What? A bloodghost Spider?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>that’s right. You must have come here because you saw the light. The cold-blood Hall deliberately lured you here with the elixir. They lured people into the valley to help them deal with the blood ghost spiders. I found out early, so I hid here and waited for the opportunity …</p><p>After fairy Tan Xiang explained, Lu Ming came to a realization.</p><p>The people from cold-blood Hall must have found the spirit-refining fruit first, but they could not deal with the powerful blood ghost spiders inside, so they wanted to attract others to help them deal with the spiders, so that they could reap the benefits.</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang discovered this secret and secretly set up an array to hide here. She was also the one who called out to the pure spatial spirit.</p><p>A few groups of people had already died inside.</p><p>the people from cold-blood Hall have gone out to attract others. They’ll probably be back soon!</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang said.</p><p>As soon as fairy Tan Xiang finished speaking, the three of them looked toward the North. There, three blood-red lights flew over at an extreme speed, then landed on a mountain peak and disappeared.</p><p>“Three spiritual God Realm experts!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>The three cold-blood Hall disciples were all spiritual God Realm experts, and Lu Ming had seen two of them before.</p><p>One of them was the bearded man, and the other was the cold-blood Hall expert who was injured when Lu Ming, Chu Kuang, and Zhang Wenjin went to the pillar of heavens mountains.</p><p>The three cold-blood Hall experts were hiding in a mountain peak, concealing their auras.</p><p>Not long after, there was another flash of light and six figures flew over at high speed.</p><p>The six figures included a white-haired elder and a middle-aged burly man. However, their auras were all extremely strong. The weakest was at the ninth level of the spirit embryo realm, and there was even a perfected spirit embryo realm.</p><p>“Eh? I clearly saw a flash of light in this direction just now. How did it disappear?”</p><p>An old man muttered.</p><p>“That is … The spirit refining fruit!”</p><p>Suddenly, one of them exclaimed.</p><p>The others also looked at the valley, their eyes burning with passion.</p><p>it’s the spirit refining fruit! It’s really the spirit refining fruit! So many!</p><p>The six of them all revealed expressions of madness and greed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
