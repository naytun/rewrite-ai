No one from the southern underworld has come here!”</p><p>The crowd around them continued to discuss and guess Lu Ming’s identity. However, they could not guess that no one knew Lu Ming.</p><p>the tianxu cave is very mysterious. It doesn’t necessarily mean that only the strongest heaven’s favorites can pass through it. Some Ordinary Geniuses can pass through it if they are lucky!</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>As soon as he said this, the crowd’s eyes were filled with different expressions.</p><p>Some people looked at Lu Ming with a burning gaze.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Two white-haired elders descended from the sky. They were the two elders of the Tianxia Academy.</p><p>The two elders were also very surprised to see Lu Ming. They had thought that after Yang potian, no one would be able to clear the Tiangang cave. They did not expect that someone would be able to.</p><p>young friend, take this token. In half a month, the marrow cleansing pool will open. You can use this token to enter the pool!</p><p>An elder took out a token and passed it to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming took the token and thanked him with cupped fists.</p><p>The two old men smiled and turned to leave.</p><p>Many people looked at the token in Lu Ming’s hand with burning eyes. Among them, Wu chengkong, Xue Luo Zi, and the other second-grade geniuses were the most excited.</p><p>“Excuse me, please!”</p><p>Lu Ming put away the token and smiled. He squeezed out of the crowd and walked toward the Wanxiang Jade wall.</p><p>He was no longer interested in who would challenge the tianxu cave next.</p><p>In the crowd, blood Luo Zi’s gaze was fixed on Lu Ming’s back.</p><p>“Dandan, how’s the research going?”</p><p>When he came to the Wanxiang Jade, he found that dandan was still walking around and observing seriously.</p><p>“There’s already some progress. Little brat, don’t disturb this Lord. After a while, this Lord will definitely give you a big surprise!”</p><p>After saying that, he ignored Lu Ming and continued his research.</p><p>“This guy!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and ignored her. He looked for a suitable Jade wall and continued to comprehend.</p><p>The myriad image Jade wall was all-encompassing and could really find anything.</p><p>Before long, Lu Ming found an extremely mysterious Jade wall. In front of this Jade wall, Lu Ming could comprehend the profound principles of the concept of fire.</p><p>Lu Ming studied it carefully. With his current level of comprehension, he had gained a lot. In just a few days, Lu Ming’s concept of fire had gained a lot. He felt that he could make a breakthrough at any time and reach the lower tier of level four.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed and continued to comprehend.</p><p>After another three days, Lu Ming’s concept of fire really broke through in one go and reached level four lower tier.</p><p>This trip to the Tianxia Academy was worth it. He had gained a lot.</p><p>“Young hero, my young master would like to see you!”</p><p>At this moment, a young lady walked to Lu Ming’s side with a sweet smile.</p><p>“Who is your young master?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned slightly.</p><p>young master will know when you get there. It’s on that mountain peak not far away!</p><p>The woman pointed to a mountain peak in the East.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll go with you!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment and followed the young woman, flying toward the mountain peak.</p><p>The mountain was only a hundred miles away from the Wanxiang Jade wall.</p><p>There were two figures on the mountain peak.</p><p>One of them was actually a blood Luo master, while the other was an old man in a blood-red robe. He must be a master from cold-blood Hall.</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming, Xue Luo Zi smiled. “Haha, how should I address you, brother?”</p><p>“I’m from the mountains, so even if I tell you, brother Xue won’t know. I wonder why Brother Xue has called me here?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Oh, it’s very simple. I want to buy your token to enter the marrow cleansing pool. How many raw stones do you need? you can name a price.”</p><p>Blood Luo Zi said.</p><p>“As expected, it’s because of this matter!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered in his heart. The moment he saw blood Luo Zi, he guessed that he was looking for him because of the token in his hand.</p><p>“Brother Xue, I’m afraid you’ll be disappointed. I don’t have any plans to sell the token!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Blood Luo Zi’s face darkened at Lu Ming’s refusal. you’d better think about it. The quota for the marrow cleansing pool is of little use to you. It’ll only be a waste. Only in my hands will you be able to bring out the greatest effect! zhang xuan said.</p><p>There was a threatening tone in his voice. He looked at Lu Ming with a hint of disdain.</p><p>He meant that it was a waste for Lu Ming to have the quota for the marrow cleansing pool.</p><p>whether I waste my time or not is my own business. There’s no need for brother Xue to worry. If there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly and turned to leave.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>All of a sudden, a terrifying and powerful aura rose up and a strong pressure pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>It was Xue Luo Zi. At this moment, Xue Luo Zi’s eyes were cold as he said, ” kid, you have to give it to me even if you don’t want to. It’s a pure waste of a heavenly treasure to keep it on you. It can only display its greatest effect on me, you know? ”</p><p>“It’ll only be of the greatest use on you?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold. He looked at blood Luo Zi in disdain and said, ” “First, you were defeated by Lu Shaoqing, and then you were defeated by the divine emperors. How can a loser like you act so high and mighty? In my opinion, it’s a real waste to give you the spot.”</p><p>“How audacious!”</p><p>Xue Luo Zi roared with a cold look, ” kid, I was going to buy it from you with raw stones, but it seems like I don’t have to. Just hand it over, or you’ll know the consequences!</p><p>The old man beside blood Luo Zi also stared at Lu Ming with a cold gaze.</p><p>That old man was definitely an expert. A terrifying expert. He gave Lu Ming a very dangerous feeling.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not afraid because he was in the Tianxia Academy.</p><p>“Idiot!”</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming looked at blood Luo Zi in disdain and said, ” “You think this is cold-blood Hall? This is the Tianxia Academy, and the Emperor is in charge. I’m afraid the Emperor has seen what you’ve done. Do you still want to Rob it?”</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Xue Luo Zi gritted his teeth.</p><p>Indeed, this was the Tianxia Academy. Lu Ming had obtained the quota to enter the marrow cleansing pool through the tianxu cave. If Lu Ming gave the quota to him, the Tianxia Academy might not care. But if they wanted to snatch it, the Tianxia Academy would not sit by and do nothing.</p><p>He thought that with his status, Lu Ming, this kid who appeared out of nowhere, would definitely be scared to death. He would give him face and give him the token obediently. He did not expect Lu Ming to not give him any face at all.</p><p>kid, you can’t hide in Tianxia Academy forever. You’d better leave yourself a way out.</p><p>The old man coldly spoke, this was a blatant threat.</p><p>It meant that if Lu Ming left the Tianxia Academy, no one could protect him.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He was too lazy to say more. He ignored blood Luo Zi and the elder and turned to leave.</p><p>This made the old man and blood Luo Zi so angry that their faces turned green. They were actually ignored by Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming walked toward the Wanxiang Jade wall but was stopped by another person on the way.</p><p>Wu chengkong, from the heavenly martial sword sect.</p><p>He carried a long sword on his back, his posture as straight as a sword, and stood in front of Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
