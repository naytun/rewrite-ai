This drop of blood was definitely not the blood essence of the nine Dragons, but a Blood Meridian that had been awakened in his body.</p><p>...</p><p>Moreover, there were no chakras around the drop of blood, which was a little unbelievable.</p><p>It was exactly the same as when he had just awakened his nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>When the bloodline of the nine Dragons was first awakened, there was not a single chakra. However, it would continue to improve after devouring blood essence.</p><p>But now, was the third bloodline the same?</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind merged with the third bloodline and he sensed it carefully.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming merged with the third bloodline, a deafening roar exploded in his mind. The voice was mighty and majestic. It was filled with killing intent, and Lu Ming was instantly drowned in it.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out an explosive roar, his eyes filled with a terrifying killing intent. At this moment, his heart was filled with endless killing intent, as if he wanted to slaughter all the living creatures in the world.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming could feel an endless amount of energy in the drop of blood in his third Blood Meridian.</p><p>In Lu Ming’s eyes, the drop of blood was no longer a drop of blood. It was a sea of blood, an endless sea of blood that was filled with endless energy.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that even a martial Royal realm expert would be as insignificant as an ant in front of this energy.</p><p>At this moment, a trace of energy surged into Lu Ming’s body. This trace of energy was not even one in a billion of the entire energy in the blood sea.</p><p>But it was already extremely terrifying.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming bellowed again. His murderous intent was boundless. At this moment, a layer of blood-red light emanated from his body. The strange thing was that his hair had turned blood-red, as red as fresh blood.</p><p>Lu Ming’s blood-red hair fluttered in the wind. A terrifying energy burst out from his body.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The few iron chains that were originally hanging down from the essence sealing Pagoda instantly collapsed and turned into powder.</p><p>The light that scattered from the essence sealing Pagoda, the light that suppressed Lu Ming’s cultivation, was also crushed by this force.</p><p>Without the power to suppress it, Lu Ming’s essential core, which had been suppressed for a year, started to roar wildly. His spirit embryo was beating violently like a heart.</p><p>At the same time, the intent symbol shone and rapidly grew longer.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>A five-colored pillar of light shot up into the sky and struck the essence sealing Pagoda.</p><p>The essence sealing Pagoda shook continuously and finally exploded.</p><p>Intent. Lu Ming’s five types of intents had all broken through to the fourth level.</p><p>A terrifying energy surged, causing the lava below to roil and the cave above to shake.</p><p>At this moment, in the Zhou family, the Zhou family elder was shocked. His aura rose to the sky and his eyes were filled with shock. He shouted,”Not good, something’s happened in the underground cave!”</p><p>After saying that, he quickly rushed into the underground cave.</p><p>fourth-level intent! Fourth-level intent!</p><p>Lu Ming roared. In the end, his spirit was not crushed by the endless murderous thoughts and he still retained a part of his spiritual intelligence.</p><p>“Then I’ll break through to the spiritual God Realm!”</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The nine Dragon bloodline roared and emerged. Lu Ming waved his hand and a pile of raw gemstones appeared in the air.</p><p>There were millions of raw gemstones in this pile.</p><p>There were still about 500000 raw gemstones given to him by the nine suns Supreme Master. In addition to the raw gemstones he had obtained from killing some enemies during this period of time, he had a total of more than a million.</p><p>The nine Dragons opened their mouths and swallowed the one million raw gemstones in one go.</p><p>Thump! Thump! Thump!</p><p>In his dantian, his spirit embryo was beating rapidly, as if a living being was being born.</p><p>At this moment, the spirit embryo burst out with a strong suction force, attracting Lu Ming’s soul into the spirit embryo.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The next moment, the spirit embryo shattered, and a figure appeared in his dantian.</p><p>This figure was clearly a miniature version of Lu Ming. It looked exactly the same as Lu Ming, but it was very small and mini, only the size of a fist.</p><p>This was the spirit God, formed by gathering the essence, Qi, and spirit of a warrior.</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl, his body moved and he soared into the sky.</p><p>The rocks above the cave exploded and shattered like tofu. At this moment, the entire drum-edge mountain and the entire Zhou family started to shake violently.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Then, a blood-red light rushed out of the ground and floated in the sky.</p><p>In the blood-red light, Lu Ming stood in the air. His entire body was shrouded in blood-red light, and his killing intent was like a tide.</p><p>“Kill! Kill! Kill!”</p><p>From his third bloodline, there were constant roars and killing intent surging into Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>“You … how did you escape?”</p><p>Not far away, a voice of disbelief came. It was the Zhou family elder.</p><p>At this moment, many figures were flying over from all over the Zhou family. They were all alarmed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>One figure after another appeared.</p><p>The head of the Zhou family, the elder of the Zhou family, Zhou Xin …</p><p>“How is that possible? How did you manage to escape?”</p><p>The clan leader of the Zhou clan shouted in disbelief. His eyes were so wide that they were about to burst.</p><p>“Haha, I knew it! You guys can’t trap this kid!”</p><p>The Zhou family elder laughed heartily.</p><p>kill! So what if you come out? this time, I’ll kill you completely!</p><p>Zhou family’s elder shouted and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, the next moment, his hair stood on end as a terrifying sense of danger arose in his heart.</p><p>He subconsciously raised his head to look at the sky. His pupils suddenly contracted as he shouted, ” “Heavenly Tribulation, it’s Heavenly Tribulation, you’re going to undergo the Tribulation!”</p><p>At this moment, the wind and clouds gathered in the sky. Endless dark clouds seemed to have appeared out of thin air, covering the sky and the sun.</p><p>Endless lightning flashed in the dark clouds, exuding a terrifying power.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had not completely entered the spiritual God Realm. He still needed to undergo the spiritual God tribulation. Only after passing the spiritual God tribulation could he be considered to have truly entered the spiritual God Realm. If he could not pass it, he would be reduced to ashes.</p><p>“Not good, retreat, quickly retreat!”</p><p>The Zhou family elder roared.</p><p>If they were dragged into the heavenly Tribulation, they would have to undergo it as well. Moreover, the power of the heavenly Tribulation would change according to the cultivation of the warrior.</p><p>If they were not prepared and got involved, they would be courting death.</p><p>The Zhou family’s elder retreated quickly, wanting to stay far away. He would come and kill Lu Ming after he transcended the Tribulation.</p><p>He was confident that even if Lu Ming entered the first level of the spiritual God Realm, he would still be able to kill him.</p><p>In the spiritual God Realm, the gap between each level was extremely huge. He did not believe that Lu Ming could cross three levels and fight him while he was in the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>“Old dog, where do you think you’re going?”</p><p>Lu Ming fixed his eyes on the Zhou family patriarch. He took a step forward and used the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s Nine Dragons heaven stomping steps was several times faster than it was a year ago.</p><p>It seemed that Lu Ming’s Nine Dragons heaven-treading steps had also broken through in the past year.</p><p>His body was like a bolt of lightning as he approached the Zhou family patriarch.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At this moment, the dark clouds in the sky churned and a bolt of lightning as thick as a water tank struck down at Lu Ming.</p><p>The five wills gathered and formed a five-colored armor that covered Lu Ming’s entire body. Lu Ming did not even look at the lightning and continued to chase after the Zhou family patriarch.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The lightning drowned Lu Ming, but he charged past it and was unharmed.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>There was a deafening roar in the sky. This time, three bolts of lightning struck at Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
