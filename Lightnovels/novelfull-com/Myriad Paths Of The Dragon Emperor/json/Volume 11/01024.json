He did not have any mental energy fire, but he could move freely in the array. She was very curious about this, so she invited Lu Ming to take a seat.</p><p>She also wanted to see how strong Lu Ming’s real abilities were!</p><p>“That is … Lu Shaoqing?”</p><p>In the outer courtyard, hai Ziming, Ling yunkong, and the rest were shocked as they recognized Lu Ming.</p><p>“It’s that kid, the one who went in with Chu Kuang. Haha, a nobody actually dares to fight with senior brother Huang. I bet he’ll be completely crushed by senior brother Huang within ten moves!”</p><p>“Ten moves, I don’t think we should even take five!”</p><p>A few cold-blood Hall talents sneered.</p><p>“Don’t be too sure!”</p><p>Hai Ziming replied coldly.</p><p>He had fought with Lu Ming before. He felt that Lu Ming did not use his full strength when he fought with him. He might be able to fight Huang Kui.</p><p>“It’s not that you’re too full of yourself, but that there’s no suspense!”</p><p>Cold-blood Hall’s Paragon looked confident.</p><p>On the fighting ring, Lu Ming and Huang Kui stood opposite each other.</p><p>“Make your move!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently with a carefree look.</p><p>“Hmph, what are you pretending for? I’m going to make you reveal your true form!”</p><p>Huang Kui laughed coldly. His body flashed and a blood-red light burst forth. A blood-red Claw ray grabbed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming did not even look at it. He struck with his palm.</p><p>On his palm, a five-colored radiance flashed.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The palm and the blood claw collided, producing a cracking sound and a muffled groan. Huang Kui’s figure quickly retreated to the other side of the fighting ring with an extremely ugly expression.</p><p>One of his hands trembled slightly, and one of his fingers was deformed.</p><p>The entire place fell silent.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually forced Huang Kui back with one palm and even broke one of his fingers. How could his combat strength be so terrifying?</p><p>so you have some ability. I was just careless just now. Next, I will suppress you!</p><p>Huang Kui’s voice rang out. His deformed fingers began to twist and return to normal.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>His figure flashed and he pounced toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Blood Flame Emperor claw!”</p><p>Huang Kui clawed out hundreds of times in a row. Endless blood-colored claw radiance was aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Each claw was terrifyingly sharp and emitted a scorching aura. They had the terrifying power of burning and corroding.</p><p>“The bloodthirsty’s world!”</p><p>At the same time, Huang Kui unleashed his bloodthirsty’s world and cast many ultimate techniques at the same time. He wanted to use this move to defeat Lu Ming in one fell swoop and humiliate him to avenge his broken finger.</p><p>“Is this the bloodthirsty technique of cold-blood Hall? It’s far from the devouring power of the nine Dragons!”</p><p>Lu Ming felt the blood in his body trembling slightly and he thought to himself.</p><p>The bloodthirst art could indeed affect other people’s blood and weaken the other party’s combat strength. However, it had no effect on Lu Ming.</p><p>The devouring power was activated, and the blood calmed down.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and struck with his palm again.</p><p>The power of this palm was more than ten times stronger than the palm just now.</p><p>The space twisted and exploded. The bloodthirsty Force’s world collapsed like tofu. The claw radiance that filled the sky disappeared without a trace under Lu Ming’s palm.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Accompanied by the sound of bones breaking and a shrill scream, a figure retreated rapidly.</p><p>Huang Kui, it’s Huang Kui again.</p><p>At this moment, one of his palms was completely deformed. The bones in his fingers and palm were all broken into hundreds of pieces by the terrifying force.</p><p>Si si …</p><p>Gasps could be heard from all around. Everyone looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually beaten Huang Kui to such a state so easily. He had completely crushed Huang Kui.</p><p>Lu Ming actually had such combat ability? This was too terrifying.</p><p>“Brother Lu’s cultivation has broken through!”</p><p>Chu Kuang muttered. He felt that Lu Ming’s cultivation had broken through. Previously, he was at the eighth level of the spirit embryo realm, and now, he was at the ninth level.</p><p>When Lu Ming was still at the eighth level of the spirit embryo realm, he could already faintly suppress him. Now that his cultivation had broken through, he was indeed more powerful.</p><p>Huang Kui was also in disbelief. Lu Ming’s power was far beyond his imagination.</p><p>Lu Shaoqing, let’s call it a day. You have the upper hand. However, I’ve been exhausted from the battle with Chu Kuang. We’ll fight another day!</p><p>Huang Kui cried out. He was clearly afraid.</p><p>“You want to fight and not fight? Did you ask me?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He took a step forward and appeared in front of Huang Kui in an instant.</p><p>This Huang Kui was truly laughable. Before the battle, he claimed that he had not expended much energy and that he was more than enough to deal with Lu Ming. Now that the situation was not right, he wanted to give up the battle. He even used the excuse that he had expended some energy during the battle with Chu Kuang. It was simply laughable.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to talk nonsense with him. He struck out with his palm.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Huang Kui was frightened and used all his strength to block, but in the next moment, he was sent flying. The bone armor of the other claw was also broken.</p><p>The next moment, he activated his bloodline and turned into a blood-red Claw.</p><p>However, Lu Ming took a step forward and appeared in front of the blood-red Claw, striking it with his palm.</p><p>The palm suppressed everything and collided with the blood-red Claw with a violent boom. Then, the blood-red Claw crumbled and turned back into Huang Kui.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming used the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps and stomped toward Huang Kui.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>In the pavilion, Xue Luo Zi stood up and shouted, his blood Qi soaring into the sky.</p><p>However, Lu Ming only glanced at him casually and ignored him. He stomped on Huang Kui’s body a few times in succession. Huang Kui screamed in pain and fell heavily on the fighting ring. The fighting ring rumbled and the sound of bones breaking came from Huang Kui’s body. Then, he lay on the fighting ring like a dead fish, spitting out blood and convulsing.</p><p>Crushing, a complete crushing!</p><p>The surroundings were silent. Not a single sound could be heard.</p><p>In the sky above the outer court, the paragons who saw this scene were all dumbfounded.</p><p>The third-class prodigy, Huang Kui, was stronger than Chu Kuang in terms of combat strength. However, he was like a piece of trash in the face of Lu Ming. He was easily crushed and beaten into a dead dog.</p><p>What kind of combat strength was this? Could it be that Lu Ming was a second-grade heaven’s favorite?</p><p>Hai Ziming, Ling yunkong, and the others sucked in a breath of cold air, feeling a lingering fear.</p><p>They finally knew that Lu Ming did not use his true abilities when he fought with them back then. Otherwise, they would not have survived.</p><p>The cold-blood Hall elites were even more dumbfounded.</p><p>Previously, they had said that Huang Kui would be able to crush Lu Ming in ten or even five moves. However, the truth was the complete opposite. Lu Ming had beaten Huang Kui to a pulp in less than five moves.</p><p>“Senior brother Huang Kui, it’s probably because of the battle with Chu Kuang that he’s exhausted!”</p><p>A cold-blood Hall elite finally spoke after a long while, but he was despised by everyone.</p><p>The battle between Lu Ming and Huang Kui was not as simple as a loss of essential core. It was a complete suppression in terms of combat strength. Even if Huang Kui was at his peak, the result would be the same. Even a blind man could see it.</p><p>They were not the only ones. The geniuses of the inner court were also dumbfounded.</p><p>The third-grade heaven’s favorites were shocked. Lu Ming’s strength was way above theirs.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
