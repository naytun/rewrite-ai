He immediately felt a lingering fragrance in his mouth and could not help but praise, ” “Good wine!”</p><p>...</p><p>Chu Kuang also picked up the wine jar and took a big gulp. Then, he looked at Lu Ming and said,”Brother Lu, you didn’t use your full strength in the battle that day, did you?”</p><p>“Brother Chu, what makes you think so?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and did not give a direct reply.</p><p>“Feeling!”</p><p>Chu Kuang said, ” I have a feeling that if I continue to fight, I will definitely lose. Moreover, I will lose miserably. Therefore, I admitted defeat so as not to embarrass myself. Haha!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and did not comment.</p><p>Of course, he had not used his full strength back then.</p><p>“Brother Lu, you’re not from the central continent, are you?”</p><p>Chu Kuang suddenly said.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and his eyes flashed.”Brother Chu, what makes you think so?”</p><p>it’s just a random guess. Every time there’s a battle of Providence, all the heroes in the world will be dispatched. They won’t miss this opportunity. Brother Lu, you’re so talented, but I’ve never seen you in the battle of Providence. I’m just curious!</p><p>so I’m guessing that brother Lu might be a peerless genius from the East barren, Northern Plains, or Southern nether!</p><p>Chu Kuang laughed.</p><p>“Brother Chu, you’re thinking too much. I’ve been cultivating in the mountains all this time, so I missed the battle of Providence!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Haha, brother Lu, don’t think too much. I’m just asking. I like to make friends with all the heroes in the world, especially one like brother Lu. No matter where you’re from, I’m definitely going to make friends with you. Please!”</p><p>Chu Kuang lifted the wine jar and said.</p><p>Lu Ming also picked up the wine jar and took a big gulp.</p><p>Chu Kuang’s words didn’t seem to be false. He was just casually asking.</p><p>This was indeed the case. The battle of karmic luck had already ended, and yet such a genius had suddenly appeared. Everyone was curious.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not very worried because his second body was in the yin and yang mountain. He would appear occasionally during this period of time. Di Yi and Martial Emperor would not suspect that Lu Ming would appear in the central continent.</p><p>After all, the Twin forbidden technique was too freakish. No one would believe it if they didn’t see it with their own eyes.</p><p>Furthermore, Lu Ming did not reveal many of his signature bloodlines in the central continent, nor did he show any signs of the Dragon bloodline’s eruption. No one would suspect that he was Lu Ming from the East barren.</p><p>The two of them drank and chatted casually. Lu Ming also took the opportunity to ask Chu Kuang about the specific situation of the major forces in the central continent.</p><p>In the central continent, there were a total of 18 Overlord forces, both humans and demons.</p><p>They each occupied the vast East barren.</p><p>Each Overlord force had an Emperor in charge and was extremely powerful.</p><p>Under the 18 Overlord forces, there were many other powerful forces. Some of them were extremely powerful and had Supreme-beings as their leaders.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed to himself. The central continent was indeed powerful. The eastern barren territory could not compare to it. He wondered how powerful the ancient sacred dynasty of the central continent was when they were victorious.</p><p>“Brother Lu, in my opinion, you have a great chance of becoming a second-grade heaven’s favorite!”</p><p>Chu Kuang sighed.</p><p>“Second class heaven’s favorite?” Lu Ming was a little surprised.</p><p>“Oh? So brother Lu doesn’t know about this? In the central continent, the top heaven’s pride experts are divided into three ranks. I am a third-grade heaven’s pride expert, and in the floating mountain sect, there are only three heaven’s pride experts above the third grade. The others like Yang Cong and hai Ziming you’ve seen before are not even in the third grade!”</p><p>Chu Kuang explained.</p><p>“Brother Chu is only a third-grade heaven’s favorite?”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>Chu Kuang’s talent was definitely not inferior to that of Blood Sword one and ao tu from the East barren. However, he was only a third-grade heaven’s favorite. If he was a second-grade or even a first-grade heaven’s favorite, how terrifying would that be?</p><p>“That’s right, I’m only a third class heaven’s favorite, and in the floating mountain sect, only the first among the younger generation can be considered a second class heaven’s favorite. However, there aren’t many second class heaven’s favorites in the central continent, only about twenty of them!”</p><p>Chu Kuang said.</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>Chu Kuang was only a third-grade heaven’s favorite. A second-grade heaven’s favorite must be stronger and more talented. Lu Ming speculated that a second-grade heaven’s favorite was most likely at the level of an Emperor God.</p><p>If they were really at the level of Emperor gods, there were actually more than twenty of them, which was terrifying.</p><p>Emperor gods were said to be able to inherit the legacy of Martial Emperor Di Yi and have the potential to become emperors in the future. They were extremely rare in the entire history of the eastern barren territory.</p><p>There were more than 20 heaven’s favorites of this level in the central continent?</p><p>What about the stronger first-grade heaven’s favorites?</p><p>Chu Kuang seemed to have read Lu Ming’s mind. He continued, above second-grade heaven’s pride experts are first-grade heaven’s pride experts. However, there are only five of them, and they are known as the top five young warriors. Each of them is a figure that can suppress an era. They are incomparably terrifying, peerless, and extremely powerful!</p><p>Chu Kuang’s eyes were filled with deep respect and fear.</p><p>It was obvious that the top five young warriors held a high position in his heart.</p><p>“The top five young warriors?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes glowed with a strong fighting spirit.</p><p>Supreme talents like the Emperor God were also extremely powerful and could become emperors in the future. They were all incredible existences.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not under too much pressure because he had fought with the Emperor God. Although the Emperor God was extremely terrifying, Lu Ming was confident that he would be able to suppress the Emperor God again if he met him in the future.</p><p>However, those who surpassed the Emperor god level were terrifying. Lu Ming could not imagine how powerful they were.</p><p>However, this made Lu Ming even more excited.</p><p>Lu Ming was not afraid of having an opponent. He was afraid of not having an opponent. With an opponent, he would have pressure and motivation.</p><p>The central continent was indeed more brilliant than the East continent. The competition between geniuses was more intense.</p><p>the battle for Providence in the central continent must be extremely intense. It’s a pity that I’m not in the central continent!</p><p>Lu Ming secretly felt that it was a pity.</p><p>“Brother Lu, do you still remember that I said there would be a grand event in the near future? In ten days, the two second-class heaven’s favorites will fight at the pillar of heavens mountains. That will definitely attract a lot of attention. After the battle of Providence, many heaven’s favorites will probably go into seclusion and come out again!”</p><p>Chu Kuang said.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered with a hint of anticipation.</p><p>He speculated that a second-grade heaven’s favorite was a heaven’s favorite at the level of an Emperor God. A battle between two such heaven’s favorites was indeed a grand event. It was definitely a rare sight and Lu Ming did not want to miss it.</p><p>This was a good opportunity for him to see how strong central continent’s top heaven’s favorites were.</p><p>“Why are two such geniuses fighting?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>one of them is master blood Luo from cold-blood Hall, and the other is Yin BUPO from Sky Eagle Castle. They are the strongest experts among the younger generation in their respective forces, and they have a grudge against each other. So, it’s normal for master blood Luo and Yin BUPO to not get along!</p><p>the two of them exchanged thousands of blows in the battle of Providence, but neither of them won. They agreed to fight another day, and the date of their next battle is in ten days!</p><p>Chu Kuang explained.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. So that was the case.</p><p>“Brother Chu, when do we leave?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>we can leave immediately. But before we go to the pillar of heavens mountains, I have to go back to the floating mountain. Brother Lu, do you dare to go with me? ”</p><p>Chu Kuang said.</p><p>“Why wouldn’t I?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
