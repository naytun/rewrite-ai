Most martial artists would cultivate mental energy fire as an auxiliary martial art. However, she did not sense any mental energy fire on Lu Ming. However, Lu Ming’s eyesight was extremely terrifying. He could see through the weakness of the array at once. This was something that even she could not do better than this.</p><p>That was why she was even more curious.</p><p>you tried to hide your appearance and change your appearance at the first moment to fool me. Unfortunately, it’s not that easy to fool me.</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang pursed her lips and smiled flirtatiously.</p><p>……</p><p>Lu Ming rushed out of the canyon and heaved a long sigh of relief.</p><p>With his current combat power, he was not afraid of goddess Tan Xiang, but he was in the wrong after all. This was the city of pills, the territory of the valley of the medicine Masters. If he was discovered by a rank 8 Alchemist from the valley of the medicine Masters, he would not be able to bear the consequences.</p><p>“You Rascal, I’m not going to care about you in the future!”</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at dandan.</p><p>“Kid, what did you say? Why didn’t you say that when I found a treasure like the NA Yuan pill for you?”</p><p>Dandan glared at Lu Ming, gritting her teeth.</p><p>Lu Ming was silent and speechless.</p><p>Indeed, dandan had been of great help to Lu Ming at times. However, she was also the one who caused trouble at times.</p><p>kid, I’ll recover better with the spiritual medicine. When I’ve fully recovered, I’ll be able to dominate the world. At that time, I’ll be able to kill even stronger experts with a single slap, let alone martial emperors.</p><p>“At that time, there will be countless people who want to curry favor with me, and it won’t be your turn!”</p><p>Dandan said proudly.</p><p>“Oh? How long will it take for you to fully recover? What level of spirit medicine do you need?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“I don’t know! As for the spirit herbs? If you want me to fully recover, mere spiritual medicine is of no use. You need stronger treasures, such as Saint medicine!”</p><p>Dandan muttered.</p><p>“Go to hell!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at him with disdain. What was the use of saying so much?</p><p>Sacred medicine?</p><p>What was a sacred medicine? It was a legendary Supreme treasure medicine, an unparalleled treasure. Even if an Emperor saw it, they would be envious. In terms of level, it was an item that completely surpassed emperors.</p><p>Above level nine spirit herbs were Saint herbs.</p><p>The man and the turtle bickered as they returned to the inn. Lu Ming threw dandan into the mountain and river diagram and continued cultivating.</p><p>The next morning, Lu Ming, Chu Kuang, and Zhang Wenjin headed for the alchemy King’s Department.</p><p>The pill King institution was located on the west side of the city. It was very famous and everyone in the city knew about it.</p><p>There were people from Medicine King’s Valley standing guard at the entrance of the pill King’s Academy. However, after Chu Kuang revealed his identity, he naturally didn’t stop the three of them from entering.</p><p>The fragrance of herbs assailed the nostrils of the alchemy King’s Department. Every blade of grass, every tree, and every flower was a spirit herb.</p><p>Many of the buildings were built like pill furnaces. They were ancient and simple, filled with the aura of time.</p><p>There were butterflies and bees flying in the flowers, collecting pollen for the spiritual flowers.</p><p>These colorful butterflies and bees were not ordinary insects. They were all exotic species.</p><p>For example, each of those bees was a rank 5 demonic beast, equivalent to a King’s realm cultivator. The honey they produced in the future would be a precious medicine worth cities.</p><p>Entering the alchemy King Academy and smelling the medicinal fragrance, it made one feel refreshed and breathing smoothly.</p><p>If an ordinary person were to enter this place and live in such an environment for a few days, they would definitely not get sick and live to a hundred years old.</p><p>Lu Ming clicked his tongue in wonder. The valley of the medicine Masters was similar to the talisman Amulet sect. They were both major sects in the Dao of inscription. However, the talisman Amulet sect was more inclined towards talisman scrolls and puppets, while the valley of the medicine Masters was more inclined towards alchemy.</p><p>Their fate was very similar to that of the talisman Amulet sect. They both once had an Emperor, but now the Emperor had passed away.</p><p>In fact, the talisman Amulet sect was no longer an Overlord force, because it didn’t have an Emperor to oversee it.</p><p>Lu mingdong took a closer look and walked around the courtyard a few times. When they arrived at another courtyard, it was already full of people.</p><p>They were all young people, and there were no figures of the older generation. There were about ten tables, about eighty to ninety people, and on the side, disciples of the valley of the medicine Masters walked around, carrying pots of wine.</p><p>Some people couldn’t wait to pour out the wine, and the fragrance immediately assailed the nose and spread in all directions.</p><p>“Good wine, it’s really good wine!”</p><p>Chu Kuang’s nose twitched, and his eyes lit up.</p><p>“It’s indeed good wine!”</p><p>Lu Ming was also amazed. Even before drinking it, Lu Ming could feel that this was definitely a good wine. Furthermore, there were many kinds of spiritual herbs in the wine. It was definitely not an ordinary wine.</p><p>brother Lu, this is the outer court. Third-grade geniuses and above should be in the inner court!</p><p>Chu Kuang sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>“So that’s how it is?”</p><p>Lu Ming came to a sudden realization. No wonder he did not see any famous geniuses here, let alone second-grade geniuses like goddess Tan Xiang, Jing kongling, and Jun Yue.</p><p>It turned out that they were divided into the inner and outer courts. Clearly, only third-grade heaven’s favorites and above could enter the inner court.</p><p>Chu Kuang, Zhang Wenjin, and Lu Ming walked towards the door in front of them, attracting the attention of many people.</p><p>that’s Chu Kuang and Zhang Wenjin!</p><p>I’m so envious. A third-class heaven’s favorite or above can enter the inner court and drink and chat with peerless beauties like goddess Tan Xiang and Jing kongling.</p><p>“I heard that the fine wine in the inner court is even more precious!”</p><p>“Eh, who’s that kid? How come I’ve never seen him before? if he dares to enter the inner court, he might be kicked out.”</p><p>In the end, many people looked at Lu Ming in surprise.</p><p>This was because they felt that Lu Ming was very unfamiliar. They had never seen him before.</p><p>Only hai Ziming, Ling yunkong, and a few other heaven’s favorites from the floating mountain martial school looked normal.</p><p>They knew very well that Lu Ming was definitely a third-class prodigy.</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ming heard this as well. He ignored it and walked through the gate into the inner courtyard.</p><p>There was a small lake in the inner courtyard, and the environment was even more elegant and unique.</p><p>There was a Pavilion beside the lake. In the pavilion, there was a table, and around the table, there were only six people.</p><p>There were five of them-the sandalwood fairy, Jing kongling, Jun Yue, Yin BUPO, master blood Luo, and a young man in white. Lu Ming had not seen him before, but he was undoubtedly a second-grade heaven’s favorite. Otherwise, he would not have been qualified to sit in that position.</p><p>Under the pavilion, there were two tables, and more than a dozen young figures were sitting there.</p><p>These people were obviously third-class heaven’s favorites.</p><p>“So it’s brother Chu and miss Zhang. Please!”</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang waved her hand and chuckled. When she turned to look at Lu Ming, a look of surprise flashed across her eyes. Then, she smiled.</p><p>After all, Lu Ming had a ‘guilty conscience’. His heart skipped a beat, and he quickly concealed his aura and did not look at fairy Tan Xiang.</p><p>haha, Chu Kuang, it’s been a long time since I last saw you. I wonder if your strength has improved recently!</p><p>At this time, an arrogant voice was heard.</p><p>Lu Ming looked in the direction of the voice. The one who spoke was a young man in a blood-red robe. He was burly and had an arrogant expression on his face. He was sitting at one of the two tables.</p><p>“Huang Kui, you were lucky to win the battle of karmic luck. There’s no need to keep talking about it!”</p><p>Chu Kuang coldly said, his face somewhat unsightly.</p><p>“Luck? Hehe, you really know how to put gold on your face!”</p><p>The young man in the blood-red robe sneered. He glanced at Zhang Wenjin and Lu Ming, and finally fixed his eyes on Lu Ming. He said,”Chu Kuang, why don’t you come in by yourself? Who was this person? What right did he have to step into this place? Did he not know his identity? Is this a place that trash can enter?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
