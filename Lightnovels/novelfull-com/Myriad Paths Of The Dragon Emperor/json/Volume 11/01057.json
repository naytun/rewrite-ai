His eyes were cold and filled with disdain. He was like a young master from a big city looking at a country bumpkin from the countryside.</p><p>...</p><p>Blood Sword one’s face turned ugly.</p><p>He had his own pride. Before the battle of Providence, he was ranked second on the list of top 1000 talents, second only to the Emperor and the deity. In the East continent, who dared to talk to him like this?</p><p>In this place, Huang Kui had actually told him to get lost, saying that he didn’t have the qualifications to comprehend here. The arrogant Xue Jian Yi’s eyes were filled with flames of anger.</p><p>“What’s with that look? Country bumpkin, are you looking for death?”</p><p>Huang Kui berated.</p><p>“Let’s see if you have the ability to get this piece of Jade!”</p><p>Blood Sword one said coldly.</p><p>“What do you mean by this? Do you want to challenge me?” Huang Kui said.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>He couldn’t bear to be looked down on by someone as proud as him in the Dao of the Blood Sword. He wanted everyone to know his strength.</p><p>hahaha, since you’re asking for it, I’ll fulfill your wish. Let’s go out and fight!</p><p>Huang Kui laughed as he shot into the sky, flying out of the region of the myriad Jade wall and into the sky.</p><p>Xue Jian Yi’s figure flickered and he also rushed into the sky. He arrived in front of Huang Kui and the two of them stood in the air.</p><p>interesting! That guy seems to be from the East continent!</p><p>“There aren’t any experts in the forsaken land. This brat is just asking to be humiliated by challenging Huang Kui!”</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Many people smiled and rose into the sky, watching from a distance.</p><p>Many people raised their heads to watch from under the Wanxiang Jade wall.</p><p>the East barren has always been the weakest of the five regions. There are almost no masters. The so-called proud sons of heaven in the East barren are all snobbish. They think they are invincible because they are the best in the East barren, but they don’t know that there is always someone better!</p><p>that’s right. A while ago, there was a flood Dragon from the East continent. It was also very arrogant, but it was completely defeated by Song Fei of the heavenly martial Sword School. He was almost captured as a Mount!</p><p>“Haha, really?”</p><p>Disdainful comments were heard from all around. Ao tu, Feng Xuan, and even the divine Emperor and Dongfang Yu frowned.</p><p>At this moment, Huang Kui and Xue Jianyi’s bodies were covered in a blood-red light.</p><p>Both of them had cultivated Blood Concept.</p><p>“Blood Concept? He’s really showing off his skills before an expert!”</p><p>Huang Kui sneered.</p><p>“Blood Sword, unsheathe!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Blood Sword! Blood Sword one shouted coldly. A blood-red sword flew out from his glabella and grew to more than ten meters long. As the sword grew, it split into two, then four, and finally into sixteen huge blood-red swords, flying around Blood Sword.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Xue Jian shouted as he formed a finger with his hand. With a wave of his finger, the 16 combat swords turned into 16 blood-red sword lights and shot toward Huang Kui.</p><p>As the 16 combat swords danced in the air, they exploded with endless sword Qi.</p><p>The sixteen blood-red swords were wrapped in boundless sword Qi as they flew toward Huang Kui.</p><p>Blood Sword one’s battle power was more than ten times stronger than it had been in the battle of Providence. His cultivation had already reached the great circle of the spirit embryo realm, and his will of blood and sword had combined into one. As the sword Qi swept past, terrifying scars were left in the space.</p><p>“Blood Flame Emperor claw!”</p><p>die! Huang Kui didn’t dare to be careless. Blood-red light filled the air as he struck out with his claws. In an instant, he had struck out hundreds of times.</p><p>Huang Kui clawed out several hundred times in a row, sending endless blood-colored claw projections toward Xue Jian Yi.</p><p>Each claw ray was terrifyingly sharp and emanated a scorching aura. They had the terrifying power of burning and corrosion. Huang Kui’s cultivation was also at the great circle of the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The blood-red Claw radiance and the sword Qi that filled the sky collided with each other, causing the air to shake continuously. The blood-red light soared into the sky, and the sword Qi surged.</p><p>The blood-colored claw radiance and the blood-colored sword Qi were neutralizing each other. For a moment, they were evenly matched.</p><p>Huang Kui’s expression was unsightly and extremely dark.</p><p>He couldn’t even take down a country bumpkin from the East continent, which made him feel very embarrassed.</p><p>“Kill! The bloodthirsty’s world!”</p><p>Huang Kui roared as he unleashed his bloodthirst technique, causing a blood-red barrier to envelop Xue Jian Yi.</p><p>Blood Sword one’s expression changed when he was enveloped by the bloodthirsty technique. He felt the blood in his body boiling as if a powerful force was trying to pull his blood.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>Xue Jianyi quickly retreated, trying to escape the range of the bloodthirsty technique, but Huang Kui was holding him back so tightly that he couldn’t escape from Huang Kui’s attacks.</p><p>Helplessly, Blood Sword one could only use bloodline fusion to form a blood-red sword.</p><p>However, Huang Kui also used bloodline fusion to form a blood-red Claw.</p><p>The blood claw and the Blood Sword collided, and the Blood Sword flew back at an extreme speed. Under the influence of the bloodthirsty technique, Blood Sword was at a disadvantage. He was no match for the blood claw.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>After a series of clashes, Huang Kui gradually gained the upper hand and suppressed Blood Sword one.</p><p>After a few dozen moves, the blood-red sword collapsed. Blood Sword one spat out a mouthful of blood and his face turned pale.</p><p>Xue Jian Yi had lost. He was no match for Huang Kui.</p><p>With a flash of light, the blood claw transformed back into Huang Kui. He looked at Blood Sword Yi in disdain and sneered,”I’ve told you, a country bumpkin like you is not qualified to cultivate on the Wanxiang Jade wall!”</p><p>Xue Jian Yi’s expression was ugly, but he didn’t say anything. He had lost. What could a loser say?</p><p>I heard that you used to rank second on the list of top 1000 talents in the East barren. It seems that the East barren is really not good enough. If the second is so weak, then the first will not be any better. I heard that the first is called the Emperor God. I think he must be here today. Ask him to come out. I’ll take care of him today. Then, you people of the East barren will pack up and go back to the East barren!</p><p>Huang Kui was extremely arrogant.</p><p>Today, he was going to trample on the people of the East continent and make himself more famous.</p><p>“You’re looking for me?”</p><p>A cold voice rang out, and a figure stepped out.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. That was the Emperor God.</p><p>“You are the Emperor God?” Huang Kui looked at the Emperor God.</p><p>“Not bad!” The Emperor God nodded. His eyes were calm and his voice was cold.</p><p>you’ve come at the right time. Make your move. I’ll take care of you too!</p><p>Huang Kui sneered.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, a terrible sword power rose from the Emperor God. The sword Qi was as high as the sky and emitted Supreme pressure.</p><p>Facing this pressure, Huang Kui’s expression changed drastically as cold sweat poured down his back.</p><p>“Spiritual God, you’re in the spiritual God Realm!”</p><p>Huang Kui shouted in shock.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sword hummed as the sword Qi slashed down toward Huang Kui.</p><p>” no! Huang Kui retreated in shock and used his bloodline fusion to block with all his strength.</p><p>However, it was all for naught. The sword Qi slashed past and the blood claw exploded. Huang Kui’s body smashed into the ground like a cannonball, creating a huge crater. He lay in the crater and coughed out blood continuously.</p><p>The crowd was silent for a moment, then burst into an uproar.</p><p>this person is so strong. He defeated Huang Kui in one move. He must be a spiritual God Realm expert!</p><p>I can’t believe there’s such a genius in the East barren. His name is di Shen. Before the battle of Providence, he ranked first on the list of top 1000 talents in the East barren. Later, he was defeated by a man named Lu Ming in the battle of Providence and is now second!</p><p>“What? Is there anyone stronger than him in the East barren?”</p><p>The sound of discussion spread out, somewhat in disbelief.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
