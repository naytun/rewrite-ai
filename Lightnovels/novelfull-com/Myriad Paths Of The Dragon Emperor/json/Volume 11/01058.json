He turned around and headed for the myriad Jade wall.</p><p>...</p><p>“You want to leave after beating up my cold-blood Hall people?”</p><p>A cold voice was heard. A young man in a blood-red robe appeared in the air and blocked di Shen’s way.</p><p>“It’s blood Luo Zi!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>“Xue Luo Zi is about to attack!”</p><p>Even more people’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Some time ago, they heard that Xue Luo Zi had entered the spiritual God Realm, and so had the Supreme God Realm. The two spiritual God Realm heaven’s pride experts were about to fight, which made many people’s eyes light up.</p><p>There was no reason for this. The Emperor God was definitely a second-class heaven’s favorite since he could break through to the spiritual God Realm at this age. It was rare for two second-class heaven’s favorites to fight.</p><p>“You want to make a move? Then let’s do it, I also want to see what’s so special about the central continent’s heaven’s pride experts!”</p><p>The Emperor God said calmly, but his tone was full of confidence.</p><p>Now that he had made a major breakthrough in his space mentality, he was confident that he would not be weaker than anyone.</p><p>Even if he were to face Lu Ming again, he was 100% confident that he could defeat Lu Ming.</p><p>“Then I’ll fulfill your wish!”</p><p>Xue Luo Zi’s eyes were cold, and his body was filled with a shocking blood light.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>At this moment, many figures appeared in the sky, all of them Dragons and phoenixes among men.</p><p>Jing kongling, goddess Tan Xiang, Jun Yue, Yin BUPO, Kong Xin …</p><p>Some people recognized them. They were all second-grade heaven’s favorites, and there were more than ten of them.</p><p>This made people’s hearts tremble. Other than the battle of Providence, this was the largest gathering of second-class geniuses. Obviously, the battle between Xue Luo Zi and the Emperor God had attracted them.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Xue Luo Zi and the Emperor God released a terrifying aura at the same time.</p><p>A saber radiance shot up from Xue Luo Zi’s body, while a sword radiance shot up from the Emperor God’s body.</p><p>The saber ray and the sword ray clashed with each other, and their power was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sword ray and the saber ray met in the air, causing a deafening boom.</p><p>At this moment, Xue Luo Zi and the Emperor God moved at the same time.</p><p>“Blood Sky blade!”</p><p>“Tiangang Emperor sword!”</p><p>As soon as they made their move, the two of them used low-grade divine level martial techniques.</p><p>At their level, there was no need for any probing. The moment they made their move, they would use their killing move. They had to carry out an incomparably terrifying killing move.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The saber and the sword collided, and the saber radiance and sword Qi overflowed, cutting the space into two halves.</p><p>One side was a world of blades, and the other was a world of swords.</p><p>The two of them retreated at the same time and then clashed again.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In just a few breaths, the two of them had already exchanged dozens of moves. The sky was constantly torn apart with spatial cracks. The deep spatial cracks seemed to be able to suck people’s minds in. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Many people kept retreating, not daring to stand too close.</p><p>It was because their combat strength was too strong, far exceeding that of an ordinary first level spiritual God Realm. Even the Qi that leaked out could kill an ordinary first level spiritual God Realm expert.</p><p>One could imagine how terrifying it was.</p><p>Only a dozen or so people could stand at the front and watch the battle.</p><p>They were all heaven’s favorites on the same level as blood Luo.</p><p>Emperor God’s combat strength has made a major breakthrough. It’s even more unfathomable!</p><p>Lu Ming did not fly high into the sky. He remained seated on the Jade platform in front of the Jade wall, looking up.</p><p>He felt that the Emperor God had not used his full strength at all.</p><p>“The bloodthirsty’s world!”</p><p>Xue Luozi used the bloodthirsty world, but it was useless. The Emperor God’s sword split it.</p><p>Xue Luo Zi’s face turned serious. He had lost his confidence since the beginning of the battle.</p><p>“How can he be so strong? The Emperor God is only ranked second in the East continent. How could there be such a master in the East continent?”</p><p>Xue Luo Zi’s mind raced. In the end, he used bloodline fusion and turned into a blood-red bat.</p><p>After performing the bloodline fusion, blood Luo Zi let out a cry and released a terrifying sound wave attack. At the same time, he flapped his wings and charged at the Emperor God like a blood-red lightning.</p><p>However, the Emperor God stood there motionlessly.</p><p>“You actually didn’t Dodge, go to hell!”</p><p>Xue Luo Zi’s eyes were filled with killing intent. He rushed toward the Emperor God, but when he reached the Emperor God, he felt that something was wrong. It was just a shadow, not a real body.</p><p>At this moment, the surrounding people saw the Emperor God suddenly appear behind Xue Luo Zi and slash out with his sword.</p><p>“This is … The space mentality?”</p><p>Many people’s pupils contracted sharply, revealing a look of disbelief.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Xue Luo Zi sensed the danger and dodged it with a flap of his wings.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the Emperor God stepped in the air, his body flashing in the air. He was extremely fast and rushed toward Xue Luo Zi.</p><p>Instant step!</p><p>However, compared to the battle of Providence, the Emperor God’s instant step was much stronger and extremely fast. In a flash, he could cover several miles, which was unpredictable.</p><p>the space mentality, it really is the space mentality!</p><p>This time, even more people could see it, and some people exclaimed.</p><p>“My God, it really is the space mentality. How is it possible? I can’t believe someone in the East continent has comprehended the will of space. Unbelievable, unbelievable!”</p><p>yang potian, one of the top five young warriors, has comprehended the space mentality. I didn’t expect that someone in the East continent had also comprehended the space mentality!</p><p>Cries of disbelief came from the surroundings.</p><p>Time and space were Kings, and the concept of space was too strong. It was not just empty talk.</p><p>Even Jing kongling and the other second-grade heaven’s favorites had a serious look in their eyes.</p><p>In their hearts, they had already regarded the Emperor God as an extremely terrifying opponent.</p><p>space mentality, it’s actually the space mentality. Then I’ll break your space mentality!</p><p>Xue Luo Zi roared, and the blood-winged bat opened its mouth and whistled. A terrifying sound wave burst out.</p><p>Wherever the sound wave passed, the space would ripple like water and finally split open, forming deep spatial cracks.</p><p>The Emperor God frowned, and his aura grew stronger as he slashed out.</p><p>This sword contained three concepts.</p><p>Sword concept, golden flame concept, and space concept.</p><p>This sword moved the space and formed a huge space crack.</p><p>The sword light was unstoppable as it slashed towards Xue Luo Zi.</p><p>Xue Luo Zi shouted. Blood light filled the air. The blood-winged sky bat’s wings were like blades as it struck out with its strongest attack.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The heavens and earth trembled violently as boundless light swept through the sky. A pillar of light shot up into the sky, scattering the clouds in the sky. It was as if a hole had been punched in the sky.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A figure retreated quickly. It was the blood-winged sky bat.</p><p>As the blood-winged sky bat retreated, it transformed back into its human form. However, there was a trace of blood at the corner of its mouth.</p><p>Blood Luo Zi was injured.</p><p>“Do you still want to fight?”</p><p>The Emperor God’s long hair fluttered in the wind. He stared at blood Luo Zi with lightning-like eyes, as if he was invincible.</p><p>“Hmph, let’s stop here today. We’ll fight another day!”</p><p>Xue Luo Zi’s expression was ugly. He snorted and then flashed away.</p><p>Blood Luo Zi left just like that.</p><p>Everyone knew that blood Luo Zi had been defeated by the Emperor God.</p><p>After everyone was stunned for a moment, they burst into an uproar.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
