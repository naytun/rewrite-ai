Each Jade wall seemed to be made of polished white jade, smooth as a mirror. They were suspended vertically in the air, and there was no end to them.</p><p>This was the Wanxiang Jade wall, which was very different from what he had imagined.</p><p>In Lu Ming’s imagination, the Wanxiang Jade wall might be a huge piece of Jade wall. He did not expect there to be so many pieces.</p><p>this is the Wanxiang Jade wall. There are mysteries on it. You can study it yourself, but you can’t damage the Jade wall. Otherwise, the Tianxia Academy won’t be polite!</p><p>The old man’s last sentence caused everyone’s hearts to tremble.</p><p>Everyone nodded and answered that they didn’t dare to.</p><p>well, did you see that? in front of each Jade wall, there is one or more Jade platforms. Only by sitting cross-legged on the Jade platforms can one gain enlightenment!</p><p>The old man introduced.</p><p>“So that’s what the Jade platform is for!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>In front of each Jade wall, there was one to a few Jade platforms suspended in the air. Lu Ming had noticed this a long time ago. It turned out that they were used for comprehension.</p><p>In other words, only a few people could comprehend each piece of Jade wall at the same time because the Jade platform was very small and only one person could sit on it.</p><p>“Alright, you guys can comprehend it on your own!”</p><p>The old man nodded and left with the other eight old men.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>As soon as the old man left, some people flew forward in search of the Jade wall to comprehend.</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze and discovered many familiar faces.</p><p>Jing kongling, Chu Kuang, Zhang Wenjin, and hai Ziming of the floating mountain martial school were all present.</p><p>In addition, he also saw goddess Tan Xiang, Yin BUPO of the sky Eagle Castle, the cold-blood Hall’s master, the other Supreme talents of the cold-blood Hall, and Jun Yue of Devil Mountain.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming saw some familiar faces from the East continent. They were blood Sword one, corpse warrior, ao tu, and Feng Xuan.</p><p>“Emperor God!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s eyes moved and he saw the Emperor God. Beside the Emperor God was Dongfang Yu.</p><p>it seems that all the top heaven’s favorites from the East continent are here!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and flew forward.</p><p>He came to the first piece of Jade and examined it carefully. Suddenly, an overbearing saber intent spread out, causing Lu Ming’s expression to change slightly.</p><p>There was only a jade platform in front of the Jade wall, and a young man was already sitting cross-legged on it.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to move forward. He realized that the feeling that each piece of Jade wall gave off was different.</p><p>it’s really wonderful. There seems to be unique skills with artistic conceptions, but they’re so mysterious. If you want to gain something, it depends on your comprehension and luck!</p><p>Lu Ming strolled around casually.</p><p>Many people had already found their targets and were sitting cross-legged on the Jade stage.</p><p>“Lu Ming, the arrangement of these Jade walls is very intriguing. In my opinion, there’s a big secret!”</p><p>On his shoulder, dandan sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Big secret? what secret? What Do You See?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>There were many rumors about the Wanxiang Jade wall in the outside world. However, the most widely accepted rumor was that the Wanxiang corn was connected to a wondrous place with a divine treasure. In ancient times, the Tianxia Academy was able to open it, but later on, that method was lost and the Tianxia Academy had not opened it for many years.</p><p>It was rumored that that place was extremely wondrous. In ancient times, Supreme experts would often enter seclusion to cultivate, leaving behind many relics and cave abodes of experts.</p><p>This was very tempting, but it was a pity that they couldn’t enter the back.</p><p>“I don’t know. I can’t figure it out in a short time. I need time!”</p><p>She said darkly and jumped down from Lu Ming’s shoulder. She walked around on her own.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with him. He searched for the Jade wall alone.</p><p>Before long, Lu Ming came to a Jade wall. He suddenly heard a faint Dragon’s Roar and a true dragon pounced at him.</p><p>“This one!”</p><p>In front of this Jade wall, there was only a jade platform. No one had come yet. Lu Ming flew up and sat cross-legged on the Jade platform, closing his eyes to comprehend.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar was heard. Lu Ming seemed to see a real Dragon walking in the void. The Dragon’s might was vast and mighty for tens of thousands of miles, causing the void to collapse and the earth to sink.</p><p>“This … It seems like every move of his contains unparalleled combat power. Is this a true dragon combat technique? No, I don’t think so …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing.</p><p>He felt that the battle Dragon’s every move was like a battle technique, but it also seemed like it wasn’t. It was hard to grasp and capture.</p><p>Lu Ming tried to understand it but he gained nothing in the end.</p><p>no, why should I learn any combat skills from it? I can compare it with my Nine Dragons heaven stomping steps!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he began to comprehend.</p><p>As a result, he felt that he had gained a lot. His understanding of the nine Dragons heaven treading steps had increased rapidly, and he had made great progress.</p><p>He had already cultivated the nine Dragons heaven treading steps to the seventh step. At this step, it was even more difficult to cultivate. Every step was extremely difficult. If one did not have the right opportunity, they might not be able to cultivate it successfully in their entire lives.</p><p>Every bit of improvement was precious.</p><p>Lu Ming had been sitting cross-legged for three days. After feeling that he could not gain anything more, he got up and left in search of the next piece.</p><p>……</p><p>In the sky, in the huge white jade Palace, a few elders were discussing some matters.</p><p>“Sect master, will this really work?”</p><p>One of them asked.</p><p>that’s the only way. The Saint mansion hasn’t been opened for many years. This time, the great era is coming, and the geniuses are gathering. Everyone has great opportunities. Perhaps this is an opportunity, and someone may be able to open the secret realm of the Saint mansion!</p><p>A white-haired old man with a Sage-like appearance said.</p><p>“I hope so!”</p><p>The others sighed.</p><p>……</p><p>Lu Ming continued to look at a few more Jade walls, but none of them were suitable for him.</p><p>After looking at more than ten Jade walls, Lu Ming finally found a suitable one.</p><p>Dragon roars were still coming from this piece of Jade. Lu Ming sat cross-legged on the Jade platform. Just like the previous piece of Jade, there was a real Dragon rolling in the void.</p><p>However, the difference this time was that there were two true dragons.</p><p>The two true dragons were engaged in a fierce battle. Their roars shook the heavens, and the battle was tragic.</p><p>“This is a true dragon combat technique!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The two true dragons fought each other. Their dragon claws grabbed out and their Dragon might lashed out. The dragons soared into the sky, and each of their movements was filled with killing power. It was clearly a powerful true dragon combat technique.</p><p>this combat technique is comparable to a God-level technique. It’s very useful to me!</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a look of excitement.</p><p>After he used the bloodline fusion, he transformed into the nine Dragons. Usually, he would only use the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps and then use the prison suppressing heavenly art. Other than that, the nine Dragons would rely on brute force to fight and lacked killing techniques.</p><p>If he had this true dragon combat technique, he would definitely be stronger when he transformed into the nine Dragons.</p><p>Lu Ming carefully observed the battle between the two true dragons.</p><p>He sat there for ten days.</p><p>After watching the battle between the two true dragons at all times, Lu Ming’s understanding of true dragon combat techniques had already reached a rather high level.</p><p>“Get lost, this piece of Jade is mine!”</p><p>Suddenly, a cold shout was heard, causing many people to turn their heads to look.</p><p>“Blood Sword one, and Huang Kui!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>In front of a Jade wall, Xue Jianyi sat cross-legged on a jade platform. Huang Kui coldly looked at him. He was the one who had told Xue Jianyi to get lost.</p><p>“Brother, I came here first!” Xue Jian Yi frowned.</p><p>“So what if you came first? He’s just a country bumpkin from the East continent. What right do you have to study on the myriad form Jade wall? get out of here!”</p><p>Huang Kui coldly shouted.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
