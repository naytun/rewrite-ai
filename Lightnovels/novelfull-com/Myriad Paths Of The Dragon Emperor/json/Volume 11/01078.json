Powerful ferocious beasts flew in the direction of the Saint mansion. Along the way, they would kill any human warriors they saw.</p><p>...</p><p>There were even powerful beasts killing each other.</p><p>Gah!</p><p>With a sharp cry, the sky darkened, and a terrifying pressure suddenly pressed down.</p><p>“Not good, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed and he rushed to the side.</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang and Kong Xin’s expressions changed drastically as well. They followed Lu Ming and charged to the side.</p><p>A strong wind blew, and a Giant Eagle flew over the three people’s heads. Its eyes were as sharp as swords, and it swept a glance at the three people. With a flap of its wings, a terrifying tornado formed, rolling towards the three people.</p><p>Wherever the tornado passed, not to mention the trees, even the huge mountains were pulled up and rolled in. The scene was terrifying.</p><p>The three of them ran forward at top speed to avoid the tornado.</p><p>After the giant Eagle conjured a tornado, it ignored Lu Ming and the rest and quickly left.</p><p>The three of them didn’t dare to take it head-on and used their movement techniques to avoid it. They flew for a few thousand miles before the tornado weakened and disappeared into the air.</p><p>Hu …</p><p>The three of them let out a long breath. That Giant Eagle was definitely a ferocious beast above the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm. It was too powerful, and they were far from it.</p><p>it seems like the birth of the Saint mansion has alarmed all the powerful beasts in the secret realm!</p><p>Kong Xin said.</p><p>“What are your plans next?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>let’s meet up with the other brothers and see if we can take a gamble. With the appearance of the Saint mansion, if we can obtain even a little bit of luck, it will be extremely beneficial!</p><p>Kong Xin’s eyes were burning with passion.</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang also nodded. A group of people from the valley of the medicine Masters had also entered, and she was also looking for people from the valley of the medicine Masters.</p><p>“Fairy, how about our two families join forces? The valley of the medicine Masters is good at the Dao of inscription, and the Tianxia Academy also has its own Dao of inscription and martial arts. Only by cooperating with each other can they bring out the best in each other!”</p><p>Kong Xin said.</p><p>“Alright, it’s decided then. Brother Lu, are you coming with us?”</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“No, I still have other matters to attend to. I’ll take my leave now!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and bade farewell to the two of them, leaving.</p><p>The two of them felt that it was a pity. If Lu Ming had joined them, they would undoubtedly be more confident.</p><p>Then, the two of them left the place.</p><p>The emergence of the Saint mansion had stirred up everyone in the secret realm. Everyone in the world’s Academies knew some secrets. The rumors about those above the Emperor level had also spread. All the experts who entered the secret realm were extremely excited. The experts of all major forces gathered and headed in the direction of the Saint mansion.</p><p>As Lu Ming flew, he soon saw a few corpses of ferocious beasts that had been killed by those powerful beasts. Lu Ming landed and his devouring power burst forth, devouring the blood essence and demonic energy of the beasts.</p><p>He had left fairy Tan Xiang and Kong Xin with this thought.</p><p>Just now, the powerful beasts in the secret realm went on a rampage and killed many martial artists and weaker beasts. Lu Ming did not want to waste them. He devoured them to break through to the next realm.</p><p>Along the way, Lu Ming devoured every human warrior and beast he saw killed.</p><p>Among them, there were many existences at the spiritual god level.</p><p>The amount of energy that Lu Ming devoured grew larger and larger. After a full day, Lu Ming had devoured the energy of more than a hundred human warriors and beasts. Then, he found a hidden place and entered the mountain and river diagram to begin refining.</p><p>The energy of the blood essence was all used to improve the bloodline of the nine Dragons.</p><p>The rest of the energy was converted into true essence.</p><p>Lu Ming started to break through to the second level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>His current intent realm of heaven and earth was completely ahead of his cultivation. As long as he had energy, he could break through to the next realm.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The boundless true essence gathered into the spiritual God, making it more solid.</p><p>The spirit God sat cross-legged in his dantian. His entire body was shining, and he looked solemn.</p><p>After half a day, there was a loud boom and Lu Ming’s aura grew.</p><p>Second level of the spiritual God Realm. Lu Ming had finally broken through to the second level of the spiritual God Realm. His strength had greatly improved.</p><p>If he were to encounter Xue Feng now, Lu Ming was confident that he could kill him without the nine seals of the divine Gate.</p><p>Lu Ming stood up and stepped out, appearing outside the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>“Now, we can fight for the Saint mansion!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a confident look.</p><p>If it had been before he had broken through to the second level of the spiritual God Realm, Lu Ming might not have been able to obtain any benefits even if he had gone.</p><p>Many of the previous generation’s geniuses from the Overlord forces had entered. It was likely that every Overlord force had an expert like Xue Feng. There might even be someone stronger. Moreover, these forces had a large number of manpower. If Lu Ming was at the first level of the spiritual God Realm, he might not be a match for him even if he went.</p><p>Moreover, there was still yang potian.</p><p>The battle power of the top five young warriors was absolutely shocking and couldn’t be underestimated.</p><p>But now, Lu Ming was confident that even if he could not suppress the crowd, he would not have a problem getting a share of the loot.</p><p>Using the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps, Lu Ming turned into a stream of light and sped away.</p><p>Soon, Lu Ming had flown hundreds of thousands of miles.</p><p>“So far, where is the Saint mansion?”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He had flown for hundreds of thousands of miles, but he felt that the distance to the Saint mansion was not close at all. It was still so far away that he could only see it but not reach it.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to fly for millions of miles. Unfortunately, he still did not feel that he was close to the Holy mansion.</p><p>The Saint mansion was suspended in the air, like a Celestial Palace.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>All of a sudden, the area in front of them was in an uproar. There were experts fighting, and it was extremely intense.</p><p>The distant sky was covered by an endless light. All kinds of colors were flashing, and terrifying attacks were constantly colliding.</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly shocked. He concealed his aura and flew over.</p><p>“Fairy, brother Kong!”</p><p>Below, a few figures looked up. Fairy Tan Xiang and Kong Xin were among them. Lu Ming flew over to greet them.</p><p>“Brother Lu!”</p><p>The two of them smiled when they saw Lu Ming.</p><p>“What’s going on?” Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“They’re fighting for the Saint mansion token!”</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang said.</p><p>“What? The token of the Holy mansion has appeared?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>He didn’t expect that the battle in the sky was over the token of the Saint mansion.</p><p>High up in the sky, the light was so bright that no one could see the faces of the people inside. They could only see seven or eight figures fighting fiercely. They were all powerful and terrifying existences. Even geniuses like goddess Tan Xiang and Kong Xin could only watch from below.</p><p>There were quite a number of people watching from below. Lu Ming saw Yin BUPO from the sky Eagle Castle and a few other experts from the sky Eagle Castle.</p><p>In addition, on the demon mountain, the Ji family’s people were also there.</p><p>Everyone stared at the sky, watching the progress of the battle.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Suddenly, a huge figure was shot down and fell heavily to the ground.</p><p>It was a lightning Eagle, its body covered in lightning, but it was no longer breathing. It was already dead.</p><p>“Senior brother!”</p><p>Yin BUPO and the others roared in shock and anger. It was obvious that this lightning Eagle was an expert from the previous generation of the sky Eagle Castle.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, another figure rushed down.</p><p>It was a man in white who looked to be in his thirties. He was not dead, but he was injured. His white robe was stained with blood.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
