His name is Lu Shaoqing!</p><p>Wu chengkong said to a man in his forties.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>The man in his Prime stepped forward, his eyes cold as he stared at Lu Ming. Lu Shaoqing, how dare you touch someone from the gifted sword sect! I don’t think you’ll be able to live in this world!</p><p>The brawny man’s aura was overbearing, and his body revealed a powerful aura.</p><p>The other people on the field heard the commotion and looked over.</p><p>Lu Shaoqing?</p><p>Among them, Jing kongling, junyue, and Yin BUPO were a little surprised. They had all seen Lu Ming before and were slightly surprised when they looked at him.</p><p>“Eh? Isn’t that the trash with five combat skills?”</p><p>that’s right, it’s him. Did he offend the heavenly martial Sword School? he’s really courting death!</p><p>why do I feel like Wu chengkong lost to him? otherwise, he wouldn’t have asked the Masters of the previous generation to come out and fight him himself!</p><p>“It’s true, no way? Is that trash that powerful?”</p><p>Many people recognized Lu Ming. They were in a heated discussion and had all sorts of guesses.</p><p>Lu Ming cast a casual glance at the middle-aged man and shifted his gaze to Wu chengkong. Wu chengkong, I let you go last time. It seems that you have not learned your lesson. I will send you on your way!</p><p>Everyone was shocked. Could it be that Wu chengkong had really suffered a loss at the hands of Lu Ming?</p><p>“Lu Shaoqing, don’t be so arrogant. You’re the one who’s going to die today!”</p><p>Wu chengkong’s face was cold. He wished he could cut Lu Ming into eight pieces.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of a sword rang out. The disciples of the sky martial Sword School all emitted a strong sword Qi. Their eyes were like swords as they stared at Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Another burly man stepped out and stood with the previous man. His aura was shocking.</p><p>so there are two experts in the fourth level of the spiritual God Realm!</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a faint smile.</p><p>There were two experts in the fourth level of the spiritual God Realm in the tianwu sword faction. Judging from their auras, they were not weaker than Xue Feng and should be in the same realm as him.</p><p>oh no, it’s them. Brother Lu, these two are the two strongest heaven’s favorites from the previous generation of the heavenly martial sword faction. They have both awakened seventh level divine level bloodlines!</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang said worriedly.</p><p>heavenly martial sword faction, don’t go too far. If you want to kill brother Lu, you have to go through our Tianxia Academy first!</p><p>Kong Xin stepped forward and stared at the people from the heavenly martial Sword School.</p><p>They had seen Lu Ming’s attacks before and they were indeed powerful. He could injure Xue Feng and force him to retreat in a sorry state.</p><p>But now, there were two experts like Xue Feng in the sky martial sword faction. When Lu Ming fought Xue Feng, he had a hard time. He would definitely be no match for two of them.</p><p>Tianxia Academy, if you want to die, I’ll fulfill your wish!</p><p>A fourth level spiritual God Realm middle-aged man from the tianwu sword faction said coldly and domineeringly.</p><p>“What big words!”</p><p>From Tianxia Academy, a man in his thirties stepped out with an explosive aura.</p><p>This was the strongest person from the Tianxia Academy who had entered this time. He was also the number one genius of the previous generation and was at the same level as Xue Feng.</p><p>It had to be said that the geniuses of the previous generation were far inferior to those of the current generation. Those who had awakened to the seventh level of the divine level could be considered the number one geniuses of their respective factions.</p><p>He couldn’t be compared to this generation’s heaven’s favorites. The difference was too big.</p><p>It was as if all the transportation had been added to this generation, allowing this generation to enter a Golden Age.</p><p>“Haha, my two martial brothers, how about you count me in to kill Lu Shaoqing?”</p><p>With a sneer, a middle-aged man in a blood-red robe stepped through the air. It was Xue Feng.</p><p>When he was injured by Lu Ming, he had been waiting for an opportunity to take revenge. Now that he saw Lu Ming going up against the people from the heaven martial sword faction, how could he miss this great opportunity?</p><p>“Xue Feng, you’ve come at the right time. Let’s join forces and kill this person!”</p><p>A young man from the heavenly martial sword sect said.</p><p>At this moment, everyone’s eyes were focused on them.</p><p>This Lu Shaoqing had offended so many people. It seemed that he would die today.</p><p>At this moment, fairy Tan Xiang, Kong Xin, and the white-robed man from Tianxia Academy all had ugly expressions.</p><p>If it was only the heavenly martial sword faction, they might still be able to fight. But with Xue Feng, it would be difficult.</p><p>“You’re all here. Just in time. Let’s settle this today!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and took a step forward, causing everyone to be stunned.</p><p>What did he just say? In the face of such a situation, he actually said that he wanted to solve it all at once. Was he crazy?</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang and the others were also stunned.</p><p>“Brother Lu!”</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang called out.</p><p>“Fairy, brother Kong, just leave this place to me!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled at fairy Tan Xiang and the others, then stepped forward and faced Xue Feng and the others.</p><p>brother Wu, this kid has a secret technique that is very evil. It can seal one’s movements. Let’s work together and work together to kill him!</p><p>Xue Feng whispered to the two experts from the heavenly martial sword faction.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The two experts from the sky martial sword faction nodded. They had heard from Wu chengkong about the battle between Lu Ming and Xue Feng. They knew that Lu Ming was extraordinary and that he had a strong front. They did not dare to be careless.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two powerhouses from the sky martial sword faction, Xue Feng, and the other two, all released their powerful auras at the same time. Their shocking auras soared into the sky and pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The three of them moved and surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>“The three of them are joining forces to deal with Lu Shaoqing?”</p><p>“How could this be? Could it be that Lu Shaoqing’s true combat strength is extremely powerful? otherwise, why would Xue Feng and the others take him so seriously and need three people to work together?”</p><p>The crowd wasn’t fools. They knew that something was amiss when they saw the reactions of Xue Feng and the other two.</p><p>They were shocked by this guess.</p><p>Other than the top five young geniuses, who else was worthy of Xue Feng and the others ‘attention?</p><p>“Brat, weren’t you very arrogant? Let’s see how you’ll die!”</p><p>Xue Feng’s eyes were cold. In the next moment, he activated his Blood Meridian and used Blood Meridian fusion to pounce on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming bellowed as his third bloodline emerged. A wisp of energy surged into his body, turning his hair blood-red and his killing intent surged out like a tidal wave.</p><p>At the same time, the seven streams of dragon energy burst forth at the same time, increasing Lu Ming’s strength to a terrifying level.</p><p>The third bloodline turned into a blood-red sword in Lu Ming’s hand. He swung the sword, and a blood-red sword light cut through the void, illuminating the sky and slashing at Xue Feng.</p><p>“This strength …”</p><p>At this moment, Xue Feng’s eyes suddenly widened as he was terrified.</p><p>This power was too shocking. It was much stronger than the last time he fought with Lu Ming, much stronger.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Xue Feng’s body turned cold as he tried his best to resist.</p><p>But-</p><p>With a pfft sound, the sword light cut through and the blood leopard that Xue Feng had transformed into had one of its claws cut off and flew far away.</p><p>Xue Feng roared and quickly retreated.</p><p>At this moment, the two experts from the sky martial sword faction had also arrived. Two vast sword gleams as large as mountains were slashing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming swung his sword in reverse and destroyed the two sword gleams. He did not stop and rushed toward Xue Feng.</p><p>Xue Feng was terrified and quickly retreated.</p><p>“You can’t leave!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He formed a hand seal and a door of light appeared.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
