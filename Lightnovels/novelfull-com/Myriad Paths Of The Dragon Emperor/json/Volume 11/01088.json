I remember everything that happened to me clearly. How could I be in an illusion? senior must be joking!”</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>“What a joke. You’re Lu Ming. In the real world, your bloodline was deprived by Lu Yao. Fortunately, you got the help of the broken soul of the nine suns, merged with the blood essence of the nine Dragons, and awakened the bloodline of the nine Dragons. That’s how you rose to power. Have you forgotten?”</p><p>The little turtle called out.</p><p>“What? Yao ‘er stole my bloodline? Impossible? How is that possible? you’re spouting nonsense!”</p><p>Lu Ming had a look of disbelief on his face. However, after hearing what the little turtle said, the dream that he had in the past, the dream that was getting fainter and fainter, actually appeared again. It seemed to have become clearer.</p><p>nonsense! You won first place in the battle of Providence and became the top 1000 of the list of top 1000 talents in the eastern barren territory. You’re the zongzi of the talisman Amulet sect. Now that the talisman Amulet sect is besieged by Martial Emperor Di Yi and is in danger, are you going to just leave it be? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled slightly with every word the little turtle said. His eyes were filled with complicated emotions and he was struggling.</p><p>“The talisman Amulet sect, the list of top 1000 talents!”</p><p>Lu Ming mumbled to himself. He felt that the dream was becoming clearer and clearer, as if it was about to surface.</p><p>“You … What’s his name? I think I had a dream before, and I also had a little turtle!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were even more confused. As the dream slowly emerged, he was in the intersection of the dream and reality. He could not tell which was real and which was fake.</p><p>Perhaps, everything was just a dream?</p><p>“I … I …”</p><p>The little turtle’s eyes went wide, and he finally cried out, ” “I … It’s f * cking called dandan, and you named it, you bastard. It’s so f * cking unpleasant to hear!”</p><p>“Dandan!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered to himself and seemed to have thought of something.</p><p>“Also, are you not going to care about your little lover and wife, Xie nianqing? She was captured by her father and her life is uncertain now. You’re giving up just like that?”</p><p>Dandan shouted.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Xie nianqing’s name exploded in Lu Ming’s mind like thunder.</p><p>The figure that could not be erased, the figure that made one’s heart ache at the thought of it, suddenly became clear and vivid in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>Following that, the dream became clear in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>nianqing, nianqing, right, right, I’m now in the secret realm of the Saint mansion of the Tianxia Academy. This is an illusion!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly lit up and emitted an endless glow.</p><p>real and fake, fake and real. Everything is an illusion. My heart won’t move!</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly shouted and threw a punch.</p><p>Huala!</p><p>The surrounding scene seemed to have been shattered by Lu Ming’s punch. It began to peel away and finally disappeared completely.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that he was standing in a long corridor. Dan dan was lying on his shoulder.</p><p>“What a powerful illusion!”</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a long sigh of relief. He was extremely shocked.</p><p>That illusion was too powerful. It erased his true memories and made him fall into an eternal illusion, unable to extricate himself.</p><p>This time, it was really dangerous. If it wasn’t for the fact that he was in danger, he might really be trapped in the illusion forever. That would be equivalent to death.</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming could not help but feel a little scared. His back was drenched in cold sweat.</p><p>kid, this place is no small matter. An Emperor would definitely not be able to do it. Be careful, I’m hiding!</p><p>After saying that, dandan automatically entered the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Lu Ming scanned his surroundings. He remembered that they had been swallowed by a vortex previously. However, he was the only one around. Yang potian, Tuoba Shi, and goddess Tan Xiang were nowhere to be seen.</p><p>This was a passageway that led straight ahead. Lu Ming pondered for a moment and walked forward.</p><p>After walking through the passage, they came to a secret chamber. The secret chamber was huge. Above the secret chamber, Lu Ming saw a bead the size of a longan floating.</p><p>The moment Lu Ming stepped into the secret chamber, the bead suddenly emitted a blinding light.</p><p>In the light, a figure appeared. The figure sat cross-legged in the air, and the bead was right in the middle of the figure’s eyebrows.</p><p>The figure was not very burly, but the aura it exuded was earth-shattering. It gave Lu Ming the feeling that he was facing the heavenly Dao. The vast might of heaven filled the air.</p><p>It was irresistible and irresistible. This was Lu Ming’s intuitive feeling. When he faced this figure, it was as if he was facing the entire world.</p><p>It was not that Lu Ming had not felt the majesty of an Emperor. The pressure that an Emperor emitted was simply child’s play compared to this figure.</p><p>It was as if the Emperor was an ant in front of this figure.</p><p>Gulu!</p><p>Lu Ming swallowed his saliva and raised his head with difficulty to look at the figure.</p><p>Fortunately, the unparalleled aura was retracted as soon as it was released. The figure opened its eyes and looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming seemed to be completely seen through.</p><p>“To actually be able to pass through the illusionary realm I set up, not bad!”</p><p>The figure said.</p><p>“Junior Lu Ming pays his respects to senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming bowed. He knew that the person in front of him was most likely the legendary existence above the Emperor level in Tianxia Academy.</p><p>He was shocked. It was said that the Saint mansion’s Secret realm had existed for hundreds of thousands of years. Could this person have lived for hundreds of thousands of years? this was really unimaginable.</p><p>The figure seemed to have read Lu Ming’s mind and said, little guy, don’t think too much. I can’t live that long. What you see is just the Saint heart I left behind and a trace of my origin mark. The real me has been dead for many years!</p><p>“Saint heart?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>He had no idea what the Saint heart was.</p><p>yes, it’s normal that you don’t understand. You’re located in a remote area on a desolate Island, so it’s normal that you don’t know. Above the Emperor realm is the Saint realm, also known as the Saint realm, which condenses the Saint heart! the elder said.</p><p>The figure casually explained.</p><p>“Saint stage, Saint!”</p><p>Lu Ming mumbled to himself. He finally knew what was the realm above the Emperor realm. It was the Saint, the Saint!</p><p>The figure in front of him must be a Saint.</p><p>yes, you have great luck. Unfortunately, you are not an inscription master. I became a Saint through the Dao of inscription when I was alive. Otherwise, I could pass on my legacy to you!</p><p>The figure suddenly sighed.</p><p>“Inscriber, inheritance!” Lu Ming’s eyes were glowing.</p><p>Although he was not an inscriber, his second body was. His second body had no other thoughts and focused on the Dao of inscriber. Now, he had advanced to an extremely profound realm.</p><p>It would be great if he was here.</p><p>“Senior, did the others not pass the illusion?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>no, they all failed, but I won’t really make things difficult for them. I’ve already made them wake up. Look!</p><p>The Saint waved his hand, and images suddenly appeared in the air.</p><p>He saw yang potian, Tuoba Shi, the unscrupulous monk, Kong Xin, and the others in their respective secret rooms, looking around.</p><p>“Eh? Fairy Tan Xiang!”</p><p>Lu Ming noticed that fairy Tan Xiang was the most special. She was sitting cross-legged in a secret room, her entire body glowing, and the silver mental energy fire between her brows was dancing.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
