Lu Ming’s group of four were too powerful and were obviously stronger than them. If they went crazy and attacked them with all their might, they would be in danger.</p><p>...</p><p>At that moment, no one dared to fight with Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>However, after a flash of light in their eyes, they bypassed Lu Ming and the others and rushed into the depths of the hall. There was another door there that led inside.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming continued to attack. His third bloodline turned into a combat sword and slashed at the light shield that protected the small tower.</p><p>After dozens of attacks, he finally broke the light shield.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He grabbed the small Pagoda.</p><p>“It’s so hot!”</p><p>Lu Ming felt that his palm was about to be burnt and there was a meaty fragrance.</p><p>Lu Ming quickly sent the small tower into the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Almost at the same time, yang potian and the others also broke the formation and kept the treasures.</p><p>At the same time, the four of them spread out and rushed inside. There was another Hall inside.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>As soon as he entered the hall, he saw the few experts fighting fiercely.</p><p>There was only one thing floating in the air of the hall. It was a Jade plate. It was crystal clear and exuded a vast and endless pressure. This pressure was too shocking and surpassed everything. It was as if it was the incarnation of the entire heaven and earth. It was extremely terrifying and far exceeded the previous emperor spiritual weapon.</p><p>“What kind of treasure is this? It was too … It’s too shocking!”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little stunned.</p><p>Yang potian and the others were also stunned. Then, their eyes lit up.</p><p>Judging from its aura, it was beyond an Emperor spiritual weapon. It must be a peerless divine weapon used by someone who had surpassed a Martial Emperor. It seemed that the Tianxia Academy was right. This was indeed the mansion of someone who had surpassed a Martial Emperor.</p><p>A divine weapon used by an existence beyond the Martial Emperor realm. How terrifying was that?</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>Almost at the same time, the four of them pounced toward the Jade plate.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The attacks of these few people were blasted towards those experts. Their faces changed greatly, and they hurriedly blocked it, but retreated with injuries.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The few of them were furious and extremely aggrieved, but they were helpless.</p><p>They were truly helpless. They were all heaven’s pride experts of the previous generation. In their era, they were all all powerful figures. They were high and mighty, looking down on heaven’s pride experts of the same generation. However, after ten or twenty years, this generation had reached the golden age. Each and every heaven’s pride expert was more brilliant than them by who knew how many times. Now, even the people of the younger generation were going to berate them and crush them. This made them feel a wave of sadness.</p><p>“This treasure is mine!”</p><p>Yang potian’s eyes flashed with cold killing intent.</p><p>“Ridiculous, Who Do You Think You Are?”</p><p>Tuoba Shi shouted coldly, not giving yang potian any face at all.</p><p>“I think this treasure is fated with this poor monk. Please don’t fight with this poor monk over it!”</p><p>The unscrupulous monk still had a smile on his face, but his fiery eyes betrayed him.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to waste his breath on them. He dashed toward the Jade plate.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A Golden Palm print was aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>It was that unscrupulous monk.</p><p>“Benefactor, this treasure is really fated with this little monk. Why do you have to snatch it from this little monk?”</p><p>The monk said.</p><p>“Fate my ass! Stinky monk, get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming slashed his sword at the heartless monk and it collided with the Golden Palm print.</p><p>“Almsgiver, don’t be angry!”</p><p>The monk called out, but his palm didn’t stop. His body glowed like a Golden Buddha, and he struck out a few times with terrifying power.</p><p>“Stinky monk, don’t pretend in front of me. It was you who used a fake Saint mansion token to cause a war, right? don’t think that others don’t know. I happened to see it!”</p><p>Lu Ming said loudly.</p><p>The moment he said that, the monk’s face froze.</p><p>Yang potian and Tuoba Shi, who were in the middle of a fierce battle, both stopped and looked at the unscrupulous monk with cold eyes.</p><p>so it was you who was causing trouble. Stinky monk, hand over your life!</p><p>Yang potian roared and charged towards the monk.</p><p>Tuoba Shi also held his Mace and charged at the monk.</p><p>The two of them were filled with killing intent towards the unscrupulous monk. What kind of people were they? how could they be fooled by the unscrupulous monk? they had been trying to find the person behind the scenes.</p><p>“I … Damn it, it’s a misunderstanding, my two benefactors!”</p><p>The unscrupulous monk shouted and jumped up and down, trying his best to resist.</p><p>Lu Ming moved and pounced on the Jade plate.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>All of a sudden, the Jade plate trembled and emitted a terrifying pressure. Lu Ming felt as if he was going against the entire heaven and earth. He was crushed by the terrifying pressure and spat out a mouthful of blood as his body fell.</p><p>Weng Weng Weng!</p><p>The Jade plate trembled slightly and emitted a Supreme light. Countless inscriptions appeared in the hall and formed terrifying chain-like things that danced in the hall.</p><p>The unscrupulous monk, yang potian, and Tuoba Shi couldn’t help but stop and look around in shock.</p><p>They were also shocked by the sudden change.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>At this moment, a group of people rushed in. It was fairy Tan Xiang, Kong Xin, and the others. Among them were the divine emperors.</p><p>The people behind had already arrived. When they saw this scene, they were shocked.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>A Black Vortex suddenly appeared on the ground, erupting with a terrifying suction and devouring power.</p><p>“Ah, not good, save me!”</p><p>A few of the weaker ones screamed as they were swallowed by the vortex and disappeared.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest soared into the sky, but it was unusually strenuous. The devouring power was too strong and it was trying to pull them down.</p><p>“Save me!”</p><p>A sharp cry rang out. Yin BUPO transformed into his true form, a Giant Eagle. He flapped his wings desperately, wanting to resist, but he still couldn’t resist and was pulled down.</p><p>He roared and disappeared.</p><p>At the same time, Kong Xin’s figure was also swallowed.</p><p>A silver light shone from between fairy Tan Xiang’s brows, and medicinal pills flew out, forming a pair of wings to support her. However, she was still quickly sinking.</p><p>“Charge out!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared and flew toward fairy sandalwood. He grabbed her slender waist and wanted to bring her out of the hall. However, he could not. The devouring power was too terrifying and he could not pull her.</p><p>brother Lu, don’t worry about me. You can escape on your own!</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang pushed Lu Ming and his body fell into the vortex.</p><p>At this time, yang potian and the others tried their best to rush out of the hall, but it was useless. The devouring power was too strong, and they couldn’t get out at all.</p><p>It was the same for Lu Ming. His body was sinking.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>Lu Ming saw a few fourth level spiritual God Realm experts being devoured, including the divine Emperor and others. In the end, only Lu Ming, yang potian, the unscrupulous monk, and Tuoba Shi were still resisting with all their might.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>All of a sudden, the devouring power increased sharply and multiplied several times. Lu Ming and the other three were devoured and rushed into the vortex.</p><p>The world seemed to spin as if he had rushed into eternal darkness. Lu Ming felt his vision turn black and he could not remember anything.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
