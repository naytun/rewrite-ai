When they needed to use it, they could directly absorb the true Qi from the storage Yuan stone, because it was originally the warrior’s own true Qi, so there was no need to convert it, and it could be used directly.</p><p>This way, he didn’t have to worry about his true essence being exhausted.</p><p>The Nanyuan stone was a rare treasure for a warrior. Sometimes, it could save one’s life. Moreover, the Nanyuan stone could be used for a long time. It was rarely seen in the market, but once it appeared, its price would be terrifyingly high.</p><p>Lu Ming had never expected that there would be a Nanyuan stone in the purple jade.</p><p>“I wonder if this Yuan storing stone can withstand my true Yuan.”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>There was a limit to the amount of true essence that different energy storage stones could store.</p><p>It was impossible for an ordinary Nanyuan stone to store a King’s vital essence. If a King’s vital essence was poured in, the Nanyuan stone would probably explode.</p><p>The amount of true Yuan that different energy storage stones could store was different.</p><p>“I’ll try!”</p><p>Holding the NA Yuan stone in his hand, Lu Ming continuously transferred his essential core into the NA Yuan stone. As expected, the moment the essential core entered the NA Yuan stone, it was stored in the NA Yuan stone.</p><p>In a short while, Lu Ming’s essential core was almost completely absorbed into the Nanyuan stones.</p><p>“It’s great that he can withstand it!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>In this way, the essential core that Lu Ming could use had greatly increased.</p><p>The power of the prison-suppressing heaven technique was now equivalent to the middle level of a low-grade divine level martial arts technique. The amount of vital essence it consumed was too terrifying. Lu Ming had not dared to unleash his full power previously. Otherwise, the vital essence in his body would be drained dry in an instant.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not afraid now. Even if he was drained in one go, he could replenish his essential core in an instant with the Nanyuan stones.</p><p>In this case, Lu Ming had an additional trump card.</p><p>Now that he was using all of his strength to unleash the prison suppressing heaven technique, even though he could not unleash its full power, it was still much stronger than when he could only unleash a few levels of its power carefully.</p><p>Next, Lu Ming took out the rough stone and started to recover his essential core.</p><p>When his quintessential essence had fully recovered, Lu Ming continued to channel his quintessential essence into the NA Yuan stone.</p><p>He predicted that this energy storing stone should be able to withstand the true essence of his first level spiritual God Realm.</p><p>In other words, before Lu Ming broke through to the second level of the spiritual God Realm, this Nanyuan stone would be his trump card.</p><p>Lu Ming only stopped after he had channeled his essential core five times.</p><p>Quintessential essence of five times was equivalent to five times his quintessential essence, which was enough for the time being.</p><p>After he had recovered his essential core, Lu Ming walked out of the inn.</p><p>There was still one more day before the start of the pill Emperor’s banquet. More and more people were gathering in pill city.</p><p>Other than the people who had watched the battle between Yin BUPO and blood Luo Zi, there were also some other people who had rushed over after hearing the news.</p><p>Of course, most of them were from the younger generation.</p><p>Because the one hosting the pill King’s banquet was goddess Tan Xiang, it was only natural that the young people would be gathered here. It wasn’t good for the older generation to mix around with these young people.</p><p>Lu Ming strolled around with dandan, hoping to find something. Unfortunately, they did not find anything after a long round.</p><p>Lu Ming laughed at himself. He knew that he was too greedy. He was really lucky to have gotten the Nanyuan stones the last time. He could not help but feel apologetic towards Zhou Xin. Zhou Xin was the one who bought it first and then gave it to Lu Ming.</p><p>Gradually, Lu Ming strolled to the North of the pill city.</p><p>There were fewer and fewer buildings here, and instead, there were many Hills.</p><p>eh, I smell a fragrance. It’s a strong medicinal fragrance. There are spiritual herbs!</p><p>Dandan’s nose suddenly twitched. Then, she rushed down from Lu Ming’s shoulder and ran forward at an extremely fast speed!</p><p>“This guy!”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He chased after her.</p><p>After crossing a Hill, they came to a Canyon. Dandan slowed down a little, rushed left and right, and rushed into the valley.</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his eyebrows.</p><p>This Valley was filled with inscription formations.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming did not have mental energy fire, he could not break the array.</p><p>However, even if they could not break the formation, they might not be able to stop Lu Ming.</p><p>Although Lu Ming did not have a mental energy fire, he still had his knowledge of the inscription Dao. Moreover, he could also feel it as his second body’s understanding of the inscription Dao increased.</p><p>During this period of time, he had been cultivating at Mount Liangyi and his progress had been amazing.</p><p>The second body did not have any distracting thoughts. Coupled with the blessing of Providence, its comprehension had increased tenfold. As it focused on cultivation, its progress was much faster than Lu Ming’s main body. Its understanding of the Dao of inscription was improving every day.</p><p>Therefore, although Lu Ming did not have a mental energy fire, he still had a good eye.</p><p>Although the array in the canyon was brilliant, Lu Ming could still see the flaws in it.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Lu Ming stepped forward, suddenly forward, then backward, suddenly left, then suddenly right, and headed into the valley.</p><p>Not long after, they arrived at the depths of the valley. In the depths of the valley, Lu Ming saw an herbal field. There were many kinds of spirit herbs planted in the herbal field. The herbal fragrance was extremely rich and wafted in the valley.</p><p>these spiritual herbs are all Level Seven!</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He realized that the spiritual herbs in the herbal field were almost all Level Seven spiritual herbs and there were at least a thousand of them.</p><p>At this time, dandan was rolling around in the medicinal field, her eyes shining with excitement. Her claws were constantly grabbing the spirit herbs in the medicinal field and stuffing them into her mouth.</p><p>“Dandan, hurry up!”</p><p>Lu Ming urged.</p><p>It was impossible for this large herbal field to be ownerless in the city of pills. It must have been planted by an expert from the valley of the medicine Masters. Even Lu Ming was a little apprehensive to steal other people’s spiritual herbs in their territory.</p><p>Like a tornado sweeping away the clouds, dandan quickly stuffed hundreds of spiritual herbs into her mouth, all of which were upper Lv 7. This fellow had sharp eyes and picked the best ones.</p><p>“Where did this little thief come from, daring to steal medicine here?”</p><p>Suddenly, a delicate shout was heard and a beautiful figure rushed out of the valley. In the air, inscriptions filled the air and a great formation glowed. Rays of light entangled dandan.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Dandan was shocked. She sprinted frantically, her four limbs retracted into the turtle shell. The turtle shell danced in the air, dodging the formations one by one, and flew toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Sandalwood incense!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked to see that beautiful figure.</p><p>The beautiful figure in the valley was actually the fairy sandalwood, mu sandalwood.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body glowed and his physical body changed rapidly, turning into another appearance. He grabbed dandan and retreated quickly.</p><p>“Stay here!”</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang’s Jade-like hands danced and the mental energy fire between her brows glowed. On the ground around Lu Ming, formations kept appearing.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes glimmered. He swept his gaze across the array and took a few steps forward. Each step was very mysterious. He stepped on the weak point of the array and retreated quickly.</p><p>In a few breaths, Lu Ming retreated a thousand meters.</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>eh? ” fairy Tan Xiang stopped, a look of surprise in her beautiful eyes. She did not continue to attack or pursue.</p><p>Seizing the opportunity, Lu Ming flashed at top speed and soon left the canyon, disappearing from sight.</p><p>strange, it’s really strange. There’s clearly no trace of mental energy fire, but he can see the weakness of the array with a glance and thus avoid the attack of the array and retreat calmly. It’s really strange. This is the first time I’ve encountered such a thing!</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang whispered, her eyes filled with curiosity.</p><p>This was also the reason why she didn’t pursue him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
