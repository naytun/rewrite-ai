It expanded rapidly and surrounded Lu Ming, the sandalwood fairy, and the pure spirit.</p><p>...</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming threw more than ten punches at the blood-red Pagoda.</p><p>Qing Junling shouted and waved her hands. The two water dragons also charged towards the blood tower.</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang waved her hand, and nine pills flew toward the blood-red Tower. When they were halfway there, the nine pills glowed, and inscriptions appeared on them. They then exploded and turned into nine combat swords, slashing toward the blood-red Tower.</p><p>Refining pills into weapons!</p><p>A look of amazement flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. Fairy Tan Xiang’s alchemy skills had really reached an unfathomable level. She could actually refine pills and turn them into weapons.</p><p>A single pill was equivalent to a divine weapon, a great killing weapon with boundless power.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Their attacks collided with the blood-colored Pagoda and successfully blocked it. However, their attacks also collapsed. They only felt a powerful force surge over, and their bodies trembled slightly.</p><p>The power of the blood-red Pagoda was much stronger than that of the bearded man.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>After blocking the blood-red Pagoda, the three of them charged out. However, at this moment, the bearded man and the blood-red robed elder also attacked. Together with the blood-red Pagoda, they surrounded Lu Ming and the other two.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two could not rush out at the moment. They could only defend with all their might.</p><p>Fortunately, they had the mountain and river diagram to protect them. The three of them could reduce their defense and use more power to attack.</p><p>Lu Ming and Jing kongling were fighting the blood-colored Pagoda and the blood-robed elder. On the other hand, goddess Tan Xiang’s body was glowing. Colorful rays of light flew out continuously. It looked pretty but was filled with killing intent.</p><p>At the same time, she waved her hand, and pills flew out. They formed a strange array in the air and attacked the bearded man with terrifying power.</p><p>But even so, the three of them were still at a disadvantage.</p><p>The main reason was that the blood-red Tower was too powerful.</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing. He had no choice but to use all his strength.</p><p>He was confident that if he used all his strength, he would not be weaker than the blood-red Tower.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>However, at this moment, a deafening boom suddenly rang out between heaven and earth. The earth trembled and the sky exploded.</p><p>Everyone saw a burst of brilliant light in the sky. It was like countless brilliant fireworks exploding at the same time.</p><p>“The formation, the formation exploded, what happened?”</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang exclaimed.</p><p>Lu Ming was also stunned. He remembered that this herb garden was shrouded in a large formation. The cold-blood Hall people had only broken a corner of it, but now it seemed that the entire formation had collapsed. The entire herb garden was about to reappear in the world.</p><p>“Not good, the item has been taken by someone else!”</p><p>At this moment, a cry of surprise came from the blood-red Tower.</p><p>“What? It was taken by someone else, damn it!”</p><p>The bearded man and the blood-robed elder exclaimed in shock. They stopped attacking Lu Ming and the others and flew back. Then, they each took out a voice transmission jade talisman and looked at it. Their expressions changed drastically.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The blood-colored Pagoda shook and transformed back into the middle-aged man.</p><p>that thing is important. Let’s go and catch any suspicious person!</p><p>The middle-aged man called out.</p><p>“Brat, you’re lucky today!”</p><p>The bearded man looked at Lu Ming and the rest unwillingly. Then, the three cold-blood Hall experts left without looking back.</p><p>This made Lu Ming, goddess Tan Xiang, and Jing kongling look at each other.</p><p>cold-blood Hall opened this ancient herb garden. It seems that there is something more important or treasure, but it has been taken away by others!</p><p>Lu Ming made a guess.</p><p>It was obvious that the value of the treasure was far above these spirit refining fruits. Therefore, the bearded man and the others had no choice but to leave Lu Ming and the others behind to pursue the treasure.</p><p>This was because they were not confident that they could take down Lu Ming and the rest in a short period of time.</p><p>“Let’s go, we’ll leave this medicinal garden first!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Goddess Tan Xiang and Jing kongling nodded as well. The three of them flew towards the West.</p><p>After causing such a huge commotion, there would definitely be more and more experts. This medicinal garden was not a place to stay for long. It was better to leave first.</p><p>There were no accidents along the way. The three of them flew for hundreds of thousands of miles, and only stopped when they were far away from the medicinal garden.</p><p>“Dandan, take out all the spirit refining fruits!”</p><p>The three of them stopped on a mountain peak. Lu Ming looked at dandan.</p><p>“Why? I got this!”</p><p>Dandan turned her head and did not look at Lu Ming.</p><p>the spirit refining fruit is very useful to those at the great circle of the spirit embryo realm or the spirit God Realm. It’s not as useful to you as other spirit herbs. Isn’t it a waste to give it to you? quickly take it out. These spirit refining fruits are for fairy Tan Xiang and miss Kong Ling!</p><p>Lu Ming said, staring at dandan with an unfriendly look.</p><p>This guy wanted to keep everything for himself again.</p><p>In the end, under Lu Ming’s intimidating gaze, dandan had no choice but to spit out more than a hundred spirit refining fruits.</p><p>This was also because the spirit refining fruit was not particularly useful to dandan. Otherwise, this fellow might not have been willing to hand it over.</p><p>“Fairy, miss Kong Ling, a total of 102 pills. How about 34 each?”</p><p>Lu Ming divided the spirit-refining fruit into three portions and gave one portion to goddess Tan Xiang and one portion to Jing kongling.</p><p>This time, it was all thanks to goddess Tan Xiang and Jing kongling. If not for them, Lu Ming would have rushed into the valley and fallen into cold-blood Hall’s trap. He would not have been able to get the spirit-refining fruit.</p><p>Deity Tan Xiang and Jing kongling did not stand on ceremony and received the items one by one.</p><p>The main thing was that the spirit refining fruit was indeed very useful to them.</p><p>Even though she wasn’t a martial artist, she could still use the spirit refining fruit to refine a pill that would be of great use to her breakthrough to become a rank eight Alchemist.</p><p>kid, you’re a guy who only values his lover over his friends. You only know how to use the spiritual herbs I picked to win the hearts of beautiful women. I’m not convinced. Beautiful women, you must remember that I risked my life to pick these spirit refining fruits, not this kid.</p><p>Dandan began to shout in displeasure. Then, she looked at goddess Tan Xiang and Jing kongling with a pair of sneaky eyes.</p><p>“Hehehe, young master Lu, your spiritual pet is really strange!”</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang chuckled and looked at dandan curiously.</p><p>The pure space spirit was the same, a spiritual pet, a little turtle, to actually be able to inscribe inscriptions, how amazing.</p><p>They had never seen a demon beast that could inscribe an inscription formation.</p><p>“Haha, two beautiful ladies, I might as well tell you that I am the head of the top ten Battle Beasts. I am unparalleled in the world, invincible in the world. Wherever I go, the world will submit to me, and millions of people will follow me. I think you two are not bad. How about this, I will reluctantly accept you as my maids. What do you think?”</p><p>Dandan stood on Lu Ming’s shoulder with her two claws on her waist, looking invincible.</p><p>Lu Ming could not wait to slap this fellow to death.</p><p>Dandan’s appearance made goddess Tan Xiang laugh even more. Even Jing kongling, who was always ethereal, revealed a smile on her face.</p><p>“Young master Lu, why don’t you let me play with your spiritual pet for a few days?”</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang laughed.</p><p>“Good, good!”</p><p>Before Lu Ming could say anything, dandan immediately nodded her head and leaped into fairy Tan Xiang’s arms. Her claws grabbed onto fairy Tan Xiang’s skirt and she said, ” “Beauty, how do you want to play with me?”</p><p>As she said that, dandan had a sneaky smile on her face, not to mention how wretched she was.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
