He was actually a spiritual God Realm master.</p><p>...</p><p>There were actually spiritual God Realm experts from cold-blood Hall nearby.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. It seemed that the most powerful geniuses of the major forces had guards around them and experts following them in secret.</p><p>For example, Jing kongling, Yin BUPO, and the others might have experts following them secretly.</p><p>This kind of person was called a Guardian!</p><p>To protect the growth of these geniuses.</p><p>It was because a heaven’s favorite like blood Luo master was too rare. It was impossible for such a heaven’s favorite to appear in every generation. There would only be one in many generations. If he died in battle, it would be a great loss.</p><p>young man, don’t push your luck. Stop what you’re doing!</p><p>The blood-robed elder cast a cold glance at Lu Ming, sending chills down his spine.</p><p>This blood-robed elder was definitely terrifying. He was not someone an ordinary spiritual God Realm master could compare to.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and did not say anything.</p><p>The blood-robed elder reached out his hand and grabbed the unconscious Xue Luo Zi. His body flashed and he turned into a blood light and left.</p><p>His only mission was to ensure the safety of the blood Luo seed. He would not attack Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was so powerful. Who knew what kind of forces were behind him? whether there were experts following him or not, he did not want to get into trouble.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a sigh of relief. These geniuses of the major forces were indeed not that simple. They had such powerful people following them. The elder in the blood-red robe gave him immense pressure. If he attacked, Lu Ming had no confidence that he could escape.</p><p>Lu Ming returned to the inner courtyard after Xue Luo Zi was taken away.</p><p>brother Lu, you’re truly an unparalleled prodigy. I’m impressed!</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming returned, fairy Tan Xiang raised her glass to him with a sweet smile.</p><p>you’re too kind, fairy Tan Xiang. I only took advantage of the Nanyuan stones!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Since the others had already guessed it, he had nothing to hide.</p><p>Junyue, Yin BUPO, and the others looked at Lu Ming with grave expressions.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was already extremely powerful. He also had the Nanyuan stones. If they were to fight him, they would not be his match.</p><p>However, they were not too worried.</p><p>As long as they broke through to the spiritual God Realm, their essential core would be incomparably rich and they would be able to use divine level martial arts techniques at will. By then, they would not be afraid even if Lu Ming had the Nanyuan stones.</p><p>brother Lu’s strength is admirable. Come, let me toast to brother Lu!</p><p>Kong Xin, who was dressed in white, raised her wine cup and smiled.</p><p>“Brother Kong, please!”</p><p>Lu Ming greeted him with a smile.</p><p>Then, Jing kongling, junyue, and Yin BUPO toasted Lu Ming one by one.</p><p>Strength was everything. It was only when they saw Lu Ming’s strength that they truly regarded him as someone on the same level as them. Previously, although fairy Tan Xiang had invited Lu Ming to sit with them, they had looked down on him and did not take him seriously.</p><p>They were all heaven’s pride experts that were rarely seen in the world. They were all prideful in their hearts. If one was not on the same level as them, they would not put you in their eyes at all. Even if they were friendly on the surface, they still looked down on you in their bones.</p><p>But now, Lu Ming had won their attention.</p><p>Strength spoke for itself.</p><p>it’s really a great era now, and there are as many heaven’s favorites as there are clouds. I thought that after the battle of Providence, all the heaven’s favorites would have appeared. I didn’t expect that even after the battle of Providence, someone like brother Lu would appear. It seems that I’ve been too complacent. I should keep working hard, or I won’t be surpassed by you all!</p><p>Kong Xin was a forthright person. She drank a cup of wine and sighed.</p><p>you’re right, brother Kong. In the current era, one has to make progress or fall behind. During the battle of Providence, Long Chen entered the spiritual God Realm. He was unparalleled in the world, but I heard that Xie nianjun has also entered the spiritual God Realm not long ago!</p><p>Demon mountain junyue also sighed.</p><p>“What? Xie nianjun has also entered the spiritual God Realm?”</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang, Jing kongling, and the others were all shocked.</p><p>“This matter is absolutely true. I’ve also heard the elders mention it. Not only that, yang potian has also broken through to the spiritual God Realm!”</p><p>Kong Xin said with a serious look.</p><p>Jing kongling and the others gasped in shock.</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely shocked.</p><p>The people Kong Xin and the others were talking about were from the five Giants of central continent.</p><p>Among them, Long Chen was known as the number one and the only person in the world. He was extremely powerful and had already broken through to the spiritual God Realm during the battle of Providence. Without a doubt, he was the number one person among the younger generation in the central continent.</p><p>Xie nianjun and yang potian were also two of the five Giants of the central continent.</p><p>Now, they had all broken through to the spiritual God Realm. These big shots were not even thirty years old, but they had already reached this step. It was truly terrifying.</p><p>Especially Xie nianjun. Back in the East continent, when Lu Ming was still very weak, he had met Xie nianjun once. She was Xie nianqing’s sister.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked when he first heard Xie nianjun’s name.</p><p>Now, he was even more shocked.</p><p>He didn’t expect Xie nianjun to have already broken through to the spirit God Realm.</p><p>Xie nianjun was the number one genius of the Xie clan of the ancient Saint dynasty.</p><p>Not only was she one of the five Giants of central continent, but she was also one of the five beauties. Such a person was truly rare.</p><p>Lu Ming had always suspected that Xie nianjun had hidden his cultivation level when he first met him.</p><p>“Xie nianjun, yang potian has broken through to the spirit God Realm. I wonder how the other two are doing?”</p><p>Kengxiang sighed.</p><p>The other two she was referring to were the other two of the five magnates, who were unparalleled heroes of the monster race.</p><p>I don’t know. I didn’t receive any news, but I guess the other two are definitely not weak!</p><p>Kong Xin said.</p><p>Everyone’s faces were solemn.</p><p>The five young tycoons had entered the spiritual God Realm one after another. They understood that the younger generation of the central continent was about to step into the era of spiritual God hegemony. The figures of the younger generation had begun to catch up and even surpass the older generation, reaching the peak of the continent.</p><p>They were under immense pressure.</p><p>In the eyes of the other geniuses and heaven’s pride experts, they were all high and mighty, targets that they had to chase up to.</p><p>However, from their perspective, they were looking at heaven’s pride experts of the same level or even higher, such as the top five young warriors.</p><p>Only by competing with stronger people would one feel the pressure and motivation. Only then would one be able to constantly surpass oneself and achieve breakthroughs.</p><p>As the group drank, they chatted. Sometimes, they talked about martial arts, other times, they talked about some secrets. Lu Ming learned a lot of things that he had not heard of from them.</p><p>After three rounds of wine, everyone got up and left.</p><p>thank you, goddess Tan Xiang, for taking out so much wine. I’ll take my leave now and return to the Tianxia Academy to focus on my closed-door cultivation. Otherwise, I’ll really fall behind!</p><p>Kong Xin cupped his fists at fairy Tan Xiang.</p><p>“Brother Kong is too polite!”</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang smiled.</p><p>brother Lu, we hit it off at first sight today. If there’s a chance in the future, you can come to Tianxia Academy to find me!</p><p>Kong Xin then looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Definitely!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>Kong Xin nodded and stepped into the air to leave. After that, Yin BUPO and Jing kongling also left.</p><p>“Fairy Tan Xiang, I’ll also take my leave!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and turned to leave.</p><p>“Brother Lu, please wait a moment. How about you stay for a drink with me?”</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang said in a sweet voice.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
