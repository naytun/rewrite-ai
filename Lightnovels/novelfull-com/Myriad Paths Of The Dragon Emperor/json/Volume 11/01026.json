A terrifying invisible sound wave spread toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Enveloped by the sound waves, Lu Ming felt his eardrums ringing and his heart beating faster.</p><p>This was the blood-winged sky bat’s innate secret skill. It was extremely terrifying. Those with low cultivation would have their hearts shattered by this sound wave.</p><p>Circulating the true war Dragon technique, Lu Ming’s vital energy was like a dragon, guarding his body and blocking the external sound waves. He soared into the sky and charged towards the blood-winged sky bat.</p><p>The blood-winged sky bat screeched and pounced at Lu Ming, starting a new battle.</p><p>Energy shot out in all directions, but the two were still tied, and it was difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>a second-rate chosen! Lu Shaoqing is a second-rate chosen!</p><p>Ling yunkong mumbled to himself in the sky above the outer courtyard. His face was pale and he was filled with lingering fear.</p><p>Without a doubt, Lu Ming was a second-grade heaven’s favorite. His combat strength was terrifyingly powerful. The thought of going against Lu Ming in the past made Ling yunkong’s back wet with cold sweat. He was filled with lingering fear.</p><p>It was obvious that Lu Ming had been wary of the Xiao family and did not use his full strength. Otherwise, he would have ended up in a miserable state.</p><p>Back then, he was forced by Lu Ming to take a blood oath to never deal with the Xiao family again. He still harbored a grudge and wanted to find an opportunity to take revenge.</p><p>But now, it was as if a bucket of cold water had been poured on him, extinguishing all his thoughts.</p><p>Seek revenge on Lu Ming? What a joke. Was he courting death? if Lu Ming were to unleash his full power, he could kill him with one finger.</p><p>He secretly decided that he would find an opportunity to apologize to Lu Ming in the future and admit his mistakes. At the same time, he would comfort the Xiao family ten times more and build a good relationship with them.</p><p>Hai Ziming, Wu Kong, and the others who had dealt with Lu Ming before also smiled bitterly to themselves. They knew that Lu Ming had been merciful earlier.</p><p>The other talents of cold-blood Hall were all pale and silent.</p><p>The inner court was in a similar state. The third-grade geniuses were also silent. However, they knew that another second-grade genius had appeared.</p><p>“Brother Lu!”</p><p>Chu Kuang bitterly smiled and shook his head.</p><p>Previously, he had thought that Lu Ming might be stronger than him. However, he did not expect Lu Ming to be so much stronger than him.</p><p>“Like I said, this guy might bring me a surprise!”</p><p>In the pavilion, goddess Tan Xiang smiled.</p><p>it’s indeed a surprise. I didn’t expect that such a person would appear after the battle of Providence!</p><p>The pure spirit nodded.</p><p>Jun Yue, Yin BUPO, and the others looked even more solemn. They knew that from now on, they would have one more powerful opponent on their way forward.</p><p>In the sky, Lu Ming and blood Luo Zi had already exchanged hundreds of moves, but neither of them had a clear winner.</p><p>Blood Luo Zi was indeed very strong. He was definitely on the same level as a divine Emperor.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was different from the battle of Providence, where he had comprehended one more intent realm and his combat strength had increased greatly. Now, Lu Ming could tie with blood Luo Zi without using blood Meridian fusion. If he used Blood Meridian fusion, he would have no problem overpowering blood Luo Zi.</p><p>However, even without using the blood fusion, Lu Ming could still suppress the blood Luo Zi because he had the Nanyuan stone.</p><p>“It’s time to end this. Defeat!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl. The vital essence in his body circulated wildly as he unleashed the prison suppressing heaven technique with all his might.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a palm strike, the true essence in his body was completely absorbed.</p><p>use the divine level martial technique with all your might!</p><p>Xue Luo Zi roared and gritted his teeth. He flapped his wings like two heavenly blades.</p><p>Without a doubt, Xue Luo Zi had also comprehended a low-grade divine level bloodline martial art technique from his bloodline. However, like Lu Ming, he could not fully perform it because he did not have enough vital essence.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming had used his full strength, he could only use his full strength to resist.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two terrifying attacks collided with each other, creating an earth-shattering boom.</p><p>The space twisted rapidly. In the end, a pitch-black hole appeared, revealing a pitch-black space.</p><p>The two of them exploded with all their strength and attacked each other. They actually pierced through the space.</p><p>Being able to pierce through space was something that could only be done by someone in the spiritual God Realm. This meant that the two of them had unleashed their strongest attacks. The power that collided with each other had already reached the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>This was an extremely shocking matter.</p><p>There was a huge explosion, and the two figures retreated rapidly.</p><p>However, Lu Ming retreated a few dozen meters before he stopped and stood in the void.</p><p>The true essence in his body wasn’t exhausted, but was in a state of absolute fullness.</p><p>Just now, he had absorbed the true essence from the energy storing stone.</p><p>Xue Luozi couldn’t maintain his blood-winged sky bat form. He turned into his human form and retreated a hundred meters before he managed to stop in the air, gasping for breath.</p><p>“Don’t tell me it’ll end in a draw?”</p><p>The pristine Void Spirit muttered.</p><p>They could see that they had both used their full strength in the last attack. It was obvious that their true essence had been used up.</p><p>The two of them were probably too weak to fight.</p><p>Lu Shaoqing, I admit that you have some skills. Today is a draw. If we fight again another day, I will defeat you!</p><p>Blood Luo Zi said.</p><p>“A draw? Who said it was a draw?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“You don’t want a draw? Our true Qi is already exhausted, there’s no point in continuing this fight!”</p><p>Blood Luo Zi said.</p><p>“Who said my true essence is exhausted?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a mocking smile. The vital essence in his body circulated rapidly and a powerful aura exploded.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>At that moment, Jing kongling, Jun Yue, Kong Xin, and the rest could no longer remain calm. They stood up from their chairs and looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>Lu Ming actually still had essential core. He actually still had the strength to fight?</p><p>How was that possible?</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>Xue Luo Zi’s eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming had used all his strength and performed a divine level martial arts technique. It was impossible for him to have any more strength to fight. What was going on?</p><p>“Storage elemental stones, you have storage elemental stones?”</p><p>Xue Luo Zi’s pupils shrank and he shouted.</p><p>Only by receiving elemental stones could one instantly replenish their true elemental energy.</p><p>Otherwise, even the best Pills would require some time to recover one’s Zhenyuan.</p><p>The others came to a realization as well. They did not expect Lu Ming to have such a treasure.</p><p>Lu Ming did not deny it. He stepped forward and approached Xue Luo Zi. He sneered, ” “Our battle is not over yet!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and dashed toward blood Luo Zi like a stream of light.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Xue Luo Zi roared and used his remaining strength to retreat.</p><p>However, he had exhausted all his vital essence. How could he avoid Lu Ming’s attack? the terrifying palm force landed on blood Luo Zi’s body. Blood Luo Zi screamed in pain as countless bones in his body were broken. His body fell to the ground of the alchemy division.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Blood Luo Zi smashed a big hole in the ground, and smoke and dust filled the air.</p><p>“I’ll kill you!”</p><p>Lu Ming rushed in that direction, his eyes filled with killing intent.</p><p>The crowd was shocked. Lu Ming wanted to kill the blood-covered Prince. How audacious! If he really killed the blood-covered Prince, the senior management of the cold-blood Hall would go crazy.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>With a furious roar, a blood-red light slashed down from the sky and headed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming retreated quickly and dodged the blood light. Then, an elder in a blood-red robe stepped on the air and descended.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
