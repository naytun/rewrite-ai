Entering the secret realm of the Saint mansion and making a fortune quietly was the most important thing. If he was too dazzling, he was afraid that many people would target him.</p><p>Lu Ming deliberately used his movement technique to avoid many puppets. After dragging it out for more than ten minutes, the light on Lu Ming’s body turned yellow. At this time, he deliberately let one of the demonic beasts scratch him.</p><p>Then, a ray of light shone on Lu Ming and he was teleported out.</p><p>When Lu Ming went out, many eyes fell on him.</p><p>As Lu Ming had passed the tianxu cave previously, he naturally received a lot of attention.</p><p>However, at this moment, when they saw the glow on Lu Ming’s body, they immediately caused a commotion.</p><p>nest, it’s the kid who broke through the tianxu cave. Why did he only hold on for so long? and why is he still emitting a yellow light? ”</p><p>like I said, he’s just lucky. I guess he just happened to encounter something easy when he was challenging the tianxu cave. It’s said that in ancient times, someone passed the tianxu cave without encountering anything. He’s just lucky. He’s trash!</p><p>“That’s right, so this person is a weakling. I thought he was a rare heaven’s favorite. I’ll spit!”</p><p>All around them, pairs of disdainful eyes looked at Lu Ming and sneered at him.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. He knew very well what was going on. Why should he care about other people’s opinions?</p><p>Lu Ming walked to the side and closed his eyes to rest.</p><p>“So you’re a good-for-nothing!”</p><p>Xue Luo Zi sneered.</p><p>Wu chengkong’s eyes were cold.</p><p>The selection continued. More than 100000 people participated in the selection. In the end, 20000 people passed the selection and could enter the secret realm of the Saint mansion.</p><p>“Junyue, come up!”</p><p>“Xue Luo Zi, come up!”</p><p>“Kong Ling, come up!”</p><p>……</p><p>At this moment, the Supremes of the major forces were summoning their heaven’s favorites. Then, Jun Yue, Xue Luo Zi, Jing kongling, Wu chengkong, and the other strongest heaven’s favorites all flew up into the sky.</p><p>“What’s this for?”</p><p>Someone was surprised.</p><p>I know. It’s said that 30000 years ago, the strong people of the world’s Academies could get a rare treasure from the secret realm of the Saint mansion, called the Saint mansion life talisman. They would carry a piece of the Saint mansion life talisman with them. If they were killed in the secret realm, the life talisman would save the wearer’s life and let them resurrect outside the Saint mansion secret realm!</p><p>“What? there’s actually such a valuable treasure?”</p><p>that’s right, but there aren’t many of them left. I guess the major forces spent a lot of money to buy them from Tianxia Academy to protect the lives of their strongest geniuses!</p><p>“This is simply cheating!”</p><p>Many people sighed. They were both envious and helpless.</p><p>With such a life talisman, he could be unscrupulous in the secret realm of the Saint mansion. He didn’t have to worry about losing his life. In that case, he could go to some dangerous places without worry.</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ming heard everyone’s discussion.</p><p>He could only sigh. It was really good to have a big power as a backer.</p><p>Very quickly, the various heaven’s favorites were distributed.</p><p>everyone, I can tell you that the secret realm of the Saint mansion is divided into nine areas, so there are nine light pillars. Each light pillar will appear in a different area. Now, each of the nine forces has a light pillar. The other forces will follow the nine forces in!</p><p>let’s set off now. I’ll say it again. Those who don’t pass the screening are prohibited from entering. Otherwise, kill without mercy!</p><p>A white-haired old man from the Tianxia Academy announced the rules. His eyes were like lightning as he scanned the surroundings. He was extremely majestic.</p><p>Everyone trembled. This was a Supreme Being, and no one dared to disobey him.</p><p>They immediately flew toward the Wanxiang Jade wall.</p><p>“All of you, and all of you, follow us in!”</p><p>Some of the young men from the sky martial sword faction pointed at a group of people. These people were from the smaller forces and had to enter with the nine forces.</p><p>This time, a total of eight Overlord forces had come, in addition to the valley of the medicine Masters.</p><p>Although the valley of the medicine Masters was not an Overlord force, it had a good relationship with all the major forces and was very strong. It could be considered a major force and occupied the nine pillars of light.</p><p>The people from the small forces that were selected by the sky martial sword faction followed the people from the sky martial sword faction obediently and entered a light pillar.</p><p>As expected, those below the age of fifty were fine. With a flash of light, they disappeared.</p><p>“You guys, come with us!”</p><p>The demon mountain experts pointed at a group of people and entered a light pillar.</p><p>Each force selected a group of people and entered a pillar of light, disappearing.</p><p>“You guys, follow me!”</p><p>A brawny man from cold-blood Hall pointed at a group of people. Lu Ming was among them.</p><p>no, we’re following cold-blood Hall. Why do I have a bad feeling? ”</p><p>Someone said in a low voice. He was very afraid of cold-blood Hall.</p><p>Cold-blood Hall had always been known for their ruthlessness.</p><p>“What’s wrong? You don’t want to follow us? Then don’t go in. What are you bunch of trash going in for?”</p><p>The man from cold-blood Hall shouted coldly, his eyes cold.</p><p>Everyone’s expression turned ugly.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and stepped forward. He saw a cold gaze staring at him. It was blood Luo Zi.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. There were no senior experts in the secret realm of the Saint mansion. If these people continued to push their luck, Lu Ming would not mind killing them.</p><p>In the end, the chosen one still followed cold-blood Hall and entered the light pillar.</p><p>This was a great opportunity, who would want to miss it?</p><p>There was a flash of light. In the next moment, Lu Ming found himself on flat ground.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>This area was very flat, but there was a huge mountain standing in the distance. From the top of the mountain, a ray of light was emitted, forming a light shield that covered a huge territory.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were now in the light shield.</p><p>huh? my true essence is being suppressed. It’s hard for me to even fly!</p><p>“Me too!”</p><p>it’s that light barrier! It has a powerful suppressing effect!</p><p>At this time, a series of voices came from the surroundings.</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze across the crowd and saw many cold-blood Hall members. There were also many people who had entered the light pillar with him.</p><p>Those who entered the same pillar of light would appear together.</p><p>Lu Ming gave it a try and realized that his essential core was indeed greatly suppressed. Even if he could fly, his speed was extremely slow.</p><p>there’s a treasure on the peak of that giant mountain. Let’s go and take a look!</p><p>Many people had their eyes on the mountain and rushed forward.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Suddenly, a scream came from the front. Light flickered, and flames soared into the sky. Someone was turned into ashes in the flames.</p><p>“Formation, there’s a great formation here!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming also rushed forward and observed carefully. Indeed, the path leading to the mountain was filled with arrays and it was very dangerous.</p><p>However, this further proved that there was a treasure up ahead. Otherwise, how could there be so many formations?</p><p>“Look, there are spirit herbs in front!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>There was a small purple tree on a small hill in front of them. The small tree was crystal clear as if it was made of purple jade. One look and one could tell that it was extraordinary.</p><p>“There’s more than one!”</p><p>Someone had found another spirit herb.</p><p>On the way to the mountain, they found a lot of spirit herbs, all of which were extraordinary. Some people speculated that they were all at least level eight spirit herbs, and there might even be level nine spirit herbs. Many people’s eyes were burning.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
