You’re all peerless heaven’s favorites with deep opportunities and high positions. However, we’re not the most talented. If we want to rise, we’ll have to use some tricks. How can we compare to you? ”</p><p>Zhou Xin mumbled to herself and slowly, her eyes became determined.</p><p>……</p><p>The night passed quickly. The next afternoon, Zhou Xin’s voice could be heard from outside Lu Ming’s door.</p><p>“Young master Lu!”</p><p>Zhou Xin called out softly.</p><p>Lu Ming ended his cultivation and opened the door. He saw Zhou Xin standing at the door.</p><p>Today, Zhou Xin had dressed up and looked like a lotus flower that had emerged from the water. To be honest, Zhou Xin was a rare beauty and many men would be moved by her.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had seen too many beautiful women. Xie nianqing, Jing kongling, and goddess Tan Xiang were all devastatingly beautiful.</p><p>Qiu Yue and Mu Lan were also rare in the world. Zhou Xin could not be compared to them. Hence, Zhou Xin was very ordinary in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>“Miss Zhou!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>young master Lu, my father has prepared a banquet to thank you!</p><p>Zhou Xin smiled.</p><p>you’re too kind, clan leader Zhou. Let’s go over then!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He then followed Zhou Xin out.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at the main courtyard of the Zhou clan’s clan head residence.</p><p>hahaha, young master Lu, you’re here. Please!</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming arrived, the Zhou family’s master came forward to welcome him. There were two elders beside him.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes swept across the room and realized that the two elders had strong auras. They were both spiritual God Realm powerhouses.</p><p>However, he should not be too strong. He should be at the first level of the spiritual God Realm. The Zhou family’s master was obviously stronger. Lu Ming guessed that the Zhou family’s master might be at the second level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>“Zhou family head is too polite!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and walked into the courtyard with the Zhou family’s master and the rest.</p><p>The courtyard was already filled with fine wine and delicacies. It was extremely sumptuous.</p><p>The dishes weren’t ordinary. There were Dragon tendons, lightning bird wings, thousand-year fire lobsters, and so on. They were all rare delicacies. If eaten frequently, they would be of great benefit to a martial artist’s cultivation. They were extremely expensive, and ordinary people wouldn’t be able to see them in their entire lives.</p><p>Everyone sat down and Zhou Xin poured wine for everyone. She raised her glass and said, ” young master Lu, Zhou Xin toasts you. Thank you for saving me!</p><p>“Haha, miss Zhou, clan leader Zhou, you’re too polite!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. The father and daughter of the Zhou family were too polite. Lu Ming felt a little embarrassed.</p><p>Lu Ming picked up the glass of wine. He did not feel that anything was amiss and then drank it all in one go.</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming drink the fine wine, the Zhou family head and the two elders were overjoyed.</p><p>Zhou Xin’s eyes were filled with pity, but it was quickly replaced by determination.</p><p>“Good wine!”</p><p>Lu Ming drank it and exclaimed in admiration. He still did not seem to notice anything unusual.</p><p>haha, since young master Lu thinks it’s good wine, then drink a few more!</p><p>The clan leader of the Zhou clan laughed.</p><p>“The wine is good, but it’s a pity that it’s poisoned, so it’s no longer good!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly said.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The Zhou clan leader and the others were slightly taken aback.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly roared. His dragon power burst out and he struck a palm at one of the elders.</p><p>The elder was caught off guard by this palm. He could not defend himself in time and was hit by Lu Ming’s palm.</p><p>With a scream, the old man’s body was torn into pieces.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>you’re courting death! the clan leader of the Zhou clan bellowed. An elder in the spiritual God Realm was killed in an instant. His heart was about to bleed. There were only a few spiritual God Realm existences in the Zhou clan. They had been accumulated over thousands of years, and now one of them had died.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A violent aura burst out from the clan leader of the Zhou clan and he threw a palm at Lu Ming.</p><p>The palm was so powerful that it could topple mountains and overturn the seas. The heavens and earth shook, and the table and the dishes on it were instantly turned into fine powder. Lu Ming felt a terrifying force surging towards him.</p><p>This was the power of the second level of the spiritual God Realm!</p><p>Lu Ming took advantage of the situation and struck out with his palm, which collided with the palm of the Zhou family’s master.</p><p>An earth-shattering force gushed forth. Lu Ming’s body shook violently and he was sent flying. He took more than ten steps on the ground. With every step he took, a huge pit was blasted out and the ground shook continuously.</p><p>“What powerful strength, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate at all. He took a step forward and the entire mountain shook violently. A terrifying force exploded and the mountain was about to explode. If it were not for the fact that the main peaks of the Zhou family had people inscribing formations, they would have exploded.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body soared into the sky.</p><p>“Stay here!”</p><p>The clan leader of the Zhou clan and another old man soared into the sky. Their terrifying attacks were directed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“I’ll smash it!”</p><p>Dandan rushed out, its four limbs retracted into the turtle shell, and smashed towards the Zhou clan leader.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Zhou family’s head slammed his palm on the turtle shell, sending dandan flying.</p><p>However, with this delay, Lu Ming had already soared into the sky and was ready to use the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps to escape.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Above Lu Ming’s head, a vast, terrifying, and unstoppable force erupted and fell on Lu Ming’s body. It was as if he had been hit by an ancient divine mountain. He fell like a cannonball and smashed into the ground, creating a huge pit.</p><p>Lu Ming knelt on one knee on the ground. His face was pale and he kept coughing out blood.</p><p>In the sky, a white-haired elder appeared. The aura on his body was extremely terrifying, vast, and unfathomable!</p><p>It was this old man who had sent Lu Ming flying with a single palm.</p><p>Dandan wanted to escape, but the old man waved his hand and condensed a huge palm, covering the sky and the sun, and grabbed dandan.</p><p>“Fourth level spiritual God Realm and above!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart sank.</p><p>The elder’s cultivation must have reached the fourth level of the spiritual God Realm or even higher. He did not expect the Zhou family to have such a powerful existence.</p><p>Lu Ming then turned to look at Zhou Xin. His eyes were cold as he shouted, ” “Why?”</p><p>Lu Ming was in disbelief. He had never expected that the Zhou family would attack him.</p><p>Lu Shaoqing, hand over your Grotto-heaven treasure and the martial arts techniques you’ve cultivated. Tell me the secret of your strength. Don’t tell me it’s because of talent. If a heaven’s favorite wants to rise, talent is one aspect, but luck is another!</p><p>The clan leader of the Zhou family walked up to Lu Ming and said coldly.</p><p>“Hahaha, I see!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly laughed out loud.</p><p>He realized that the Zhou family wanted his mountain and river diagram and some other treasures.</p><p>Ingrate, the people of the Zhou family were a bunch of ingrates.</p><p>He had saved Zhou Xin twice, but the Zhou family turned on him in the blink of an eye and wanted to deal with him. How ridiculous was this?</p><p>Zhou Xin’s eyes flashed with a hint of pity, but she gritted her teeth and didn’t say anything.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar was heard and the nine Dragon bloodline emerged. Lu Ming transformed into Nine Dragons and soared into the sky.</p><p>Nine Dragons, it’s actually the bloodline of the nine Dragons? ”</p><p>The Zhou family head and the Zhou family’s elder exclaimed in unison. They were filled with shock.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
