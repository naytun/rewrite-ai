I don’t need the Holy mansion token!</p><p>Senior brother Luo sighed.</p><p>Kong Xin and fairy Tan Xiang were secretly shocked.</p><p>They knew that senior brother Luo was the number one genius of the previous generation of Tianxia Academy. He had awakened a seventh level divine level bloodline and reached the fourth level of the spiritual God Realm. He was not weaker than Xue Feng, but he was still no match for him. Those people who fought in the sky were really powerful.</p><p>The number of people had decreased, but the battle had become even more intense. The terrifying tremors spread out for thousands of miles, and the void was as fragile as paper.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Following that, more and more people were sent flying out of the battlefield.</p><p>Four people retreated from the battlefield one after another. They were severely injured and stood in the air, looking at the battlefield with fear in their eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming could see that there were only two figures left in the sky, fighting fiercely.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The sound of collisions rang out continuously, as if two gods were fighting.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>Space split open and the light receded. Two figures appeared before everyone’s eyes.</p><p>Both of them were tall and burly, and their auras were wild.</p><p>One of them was holding a heavenly halberd. His black hair was loose and his aura was extremely shocking. He was just standing there, but the space around him was like water ripples, constantly twisting and forming circles of ripples.</p><p>Yang potian!</p><p>This man was yang potian, one of the five young tyrants.</p><p>The other man was standing in front of yang potian. His body was even more burly than yang potian’S. He had two muscular arms and was holding a huge Wolf-tooth club.</p><p>This person looked very young, definitely not more than thirty years old. He was of the same generation as Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>A heaven’s pride expert of the younger generation was actually able to fight against yang potian. Who was this man?</p><p>this person is from Northern Plains, he is known as the number one genius of Northern Plains, I heard that he had a conflict with yang potian outside!</p><p>Kong Xin explained in a low voice.</p><p>Lu Ming was enlightened, so it was a Paragon of Northern Plains. He had heard before that a Paragon of Northern Plains had fought with yang potian, and neither of them won.</p><p>A purple-gold token floated between the two of them, emitting a hazy glow.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. This must be the Holy mansion token.</p><p>“Tuoba Shi, let’s decide the winner today!”</p><p>Yang potian held the heavenly halberd in his hand. With a slight movement, he cut open a crack in the space. His aura was wild, his hair was flying, and his eyes were like lightning.</p><p>“Just what I wanted!”</p><p>Tuoba Shi grinned and swung his Mace, creating a loud rumbling sound.</p><p>The Saint mansion token was sent flying into the air by the powerful Qi.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>At the same time, the two of them moved. They charged at each other and began a great battle.</p><p>Yang potian had also comprehended the space mentality, and his use of it was even more terrifying than the Emperor God’s. At the same time, with the help of other mentalities, his heavenly halberd seemed to be able to cut through the void. The power of space surrounded it, and its power was terrifying.</p><p>Tuoba Shi’s muscles bulged like an invincible warrior as he brandished his Mace, crushing everything in his path. He collided with the heavenly halberd, creating a terrifying boom.</p><p>The two of them fought intensely and attacked continuously. In the blink of an eye, dozens of moves had passed.</p><p>The others looked around with amazement in their eyes.</p><p>“Is this the strength of the five magnates? It is indeed powerful!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. At the same time, there was a strong desire to fight in his eyes.</p><p>sigh, they’re too strong. They haven’t even used their bloodline fusion and they’re already so strong. I’m still far from them!</p><p>Kong Xin sighed.</p><p>‘Could it be that their bloodlines have surpassed level 8 divine level?’</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>that’s right. The bloodlines of the five great leaders of the central continent are all at the ninth level of the divine level!</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang said.</p><p>he’s actually a level nine divine level expert!</p><p>Lu Ming was also somewhat amazed.</p><p>The ninth level of the divine level was the highest level of bloodline. Every single one of these people was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Bloodline. The higher the level, the greater the difference in talent or bloodline.</p><p>A seventh level divine level expert was much stronger than a sixth level divine level expert.</p><p>However, a level eight divine level expert was much stronger than a level Seven divine level expert, regardless of whether it was in terms of talent or the bonuses brought about by his bloodline.</p><p>As for the ninth level of the divine level, it was even more terrifying. That was because the ninth level of the divine level represented the peak and perfection. It was not something that the eighth level of the divine level could compare to. The difference was too great.</p><p>If a level eight divine level expert had the potential to become an Emperor, then a level nine divine level expert would definitely be able to break through to the Emperor level as long as they didn’t die.</p><p>In the history of the divine wilderness continent, anyone who had awakened a divine level ninth grade bloodline, as long as they did not die, would break through to the throne.</p><p>Central continent’s five Giants were equivalent to a future emperor.</p><p>No wonder yang potian was so arrogant. He always acted as if he was above everyone else. He was destined to become an Emperor. Apart from those of the same level, everyone else was just like an ant in his eyes.</p><p>Perhaps, deep in his heart, he didn’t even care about the Supreme martial artists.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The battle continued, and it became more and more intense. The two of them were really angry for the Saint mansion token.</p><p>Both of them were determined to get the Holy mansion token.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two had exchanged more than a hundred moves. The purple-gold token of the Saint mansion rolled around in their Qi.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Suddenly, the token of the Saint mansion made a crisp sound, and then shattered into pieces in front of everyone’s dumbfounded eyes.</p><p>The token of the Holy mansion was broken.</p><p>Everyone was stunned, even yang potian and Tuoba Shi were stunned. They stopped their battle and looked at each other.</p><p>No one had expected that the token of the Saint mansion would break. Wasn’t this the token to enter the Saint mansion? The master of the Holy mansion was an existence that surpassed emperors. How could the token he made be so easy to break?</p><p>impossible! The Holy mansion’s token is sturdy and immortal. It can’t be broken! This is fake! This is a fake token!</p><p>Kong Xin shouted.</p><p>A fake token?</p><p>Everyone looked at each other.</p><p>I know, someone threw out a fake token, wanting to sit on the mountain and watch the Tigers fight, and come to reap the benefits!</p><p>Someone guessed.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes flickered. They felt that it was highly possible that someone wanted to fish in troubled waters.</p><p>“Fairy, brother Kong, how did the token appear?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>I heard that before this, someone shouted that they had found the token, which caused many people to fight for it. Later on, more and more people joined in, and in the end, yang potian and Tuoba Shi were also attracted here!</p><p>Kong Xin explained.</p><p>“So, no one saw where the token appeared from?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang and Kong Xin shook their heads. Before, everyone had fought for the token like crazy when they saw it. No one would have thought that it was fake.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. It seemed that someone was really taking advantage of the situation.</p><p>“Damn it, which bastard did this? if I find out, I’ll make him wish he was dead!”</p><p>The sky Eagle castle’s yin BUPO roared angrily. Because of this, the sky Eagle castle lost a top master and suffered a great loss.</p><p>The other people also revealed a fierce look. This person who took advantage of the situation was really too hateful.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
