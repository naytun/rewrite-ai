A drop of blood appeared on top of his head. It was the third bloodline.</p><p>The third bloodline emerged and a trace of energy poured into Lu Ming’s body. Lu Ming’s body suddenly burst out with a shocking killing intent.</p><p>Lu Ming’s jet-black hair turned blood-red in an instant. His eyes were like blood-red gemstones, filled with a terrifying murderous intent.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s strength increased greatly after he borrowed a trace of the third bloodline’s energy. He struck out with his palm and the saber in the hands of a third tier spiritual God expert with a fifth level divine level bloodline was shattered. Lu Ming’s palm struck him and his body immediately exploded.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Above his head, the third bloodline twisted and turned into a blood-red sword in Lu Ming’s hand. His killing intent grew stronger and enveloped the dozen cold-blood Hall experts. They shivered from head to toe.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>With a flash of blood-red light, the blood-red sword slashed out, cutting through the void.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Four to five spiritual God Realm experts were cut into two by the sword and died one after another, including an expert in the third level of the spiritual God Realm who had awakened a fifth level divine bloodline.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The rest of the people screamed in fear and retreated frantically, distancing themselves from Lu Ming.</p><p>“Why would I?”</p><p>Not far away, Xue Feng, Xue Luo Zi, and the others widened their eyes in shock. How could Lu Ming be so terrifying? his combat strength was too shocking.</p><p>Lu Ming could even kill a third level spiritual God Realm expert in seconds.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold and his killing intent was like a tide. He held the combat sword and charged at the other cold-blood Hall members like a god of death.</p><p>He waved his sword, and a few more heads flew up.</p><p>“Swallow!”</p><p>Then, he clenched his left palm and the devouring power burst out, trying to devour the blood essence and vital essence of the cold-blood Hall experts.</p><p>This was because he discovered that there was a powerful force in the mountain that was also devouring the blood of the cold-blood Hall members. Lu Ming was a step too late and only devoured a small amount. Most of the blood was devoured by the mountain.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Before Lu Ming could react, banging sounds could be heard from the mountain.</p><p>The tree root-like protrusions that were spread on the mountain actually moved. The rocks exploded and turned into vines that whipped toward Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Shrill screams were heard. Some cold-blood Hall members were pierced by the vines and shriveled at a visible speed.</p><p>The vines wriggled like straws, absorbing the blood.</p><p>bloodthirsty vine, this is the legendary bloodthirsty vine!</p><p>Some cold-blood Hall disciples exclaimed.</p><p>“It’s actually the bloodthirsty vine!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>It turned out that the protrusion on the mountain was the bloodthirsty Vine’s vine. It was probably because too much time had passed that the vine was covered with a layer of soil. The soil had turned into rocks, so everyone thought that it was rock at first.</p><p>But it was the bloodthirsty vine.</p><p>The bloodthirsty vine was a terrifying creature. It had appeared in ancient times and was almost extinct in recent times. Every time the bloodthirsty vine appeared, it would cause a catastrophe and bring about a bloody storm.</p><p>This was because the bloodthirsty vine could constantly devour fresh blood. As long as it devoured fresh blood, the bloodthirsty Vine’s strength would continue to evolve. It was truly terrifying.</p><p>Many cold-blood Hall disciples turned pale with fear.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Some of the vines were even thicker than humans and were incomparably huge as they charged towards the crowd.</p><p>Cold-blood Hall disciples were constantly killed and their blood was sucked dry.</p><p>Among them, Xue Feng suffered the most attacks. Several thick vines surrounded him because his qi and blood were the most concentrated.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>A blood leopard with seven golden chakras appeared above Xue Feng’s head.</p><p>Xue Feng had a seventh level divine level bloodline. He had transformed into a blood leopard and had astonishing battle prowess. The blood leopard’s claws slashed out, and several spatial cracks appeared in the space, tearing apart a blood-colored vine.</p><p>The other bloodthirsty vines were also severely injured.</p><p>Lu Ming was also attacked by two vines. The blood-red sword gleam slashed and one of the vines was cut off.</p><p>this bloodthirsty vine has just woken up and its combat strength is not strong. Let’s join forces and kill it!</p><p>Xue Feng shouted.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>All the cold-blood Hall experts who had awakened their divine bloodlines activated their bloodlines and attacked the blood-red Vines together.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The energy shot out and the rumbling continued.</p><p>The blood-red Vines were blown apart and broken one by one.</p><p>Some of the energy landed on the mountain, causing it to explode and rocks to fly everywhere.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>When the rocks on the mountain exploded, everyone was shocked to find that there were hairs under the rocks. Inside were bodies of flesh and blood.</p><p>“Those are demonic beasts!”</p><p>This time, everyone was clear in their hearts.</p><p>This Tiger-shaped mountain wasn’t a huge mountain. It was clearly a huge demonic beast in the shape of a Tiger.</p><p>From the looks of it, the Tiger-shaped demonic beast and the bloodthirsty vine had a great battle, and in the end, both sides were injured. The Tiger-shaped demonic beast was killed and fell into this group of palaces, while the bloodthirsty vine was also seriously injured and dying. It wrapped itself around the Tiger-shaped demonic beast. After a long time, it had covered its body with a layer of rocks, looking like a mountain.</p><p>But now, stimulated by the fresh blood, the bloodthirsty vine woke up again.</p><p>“Hurry up and get the Jade talisman, then leave this place!”</p><p>Xue Feng roared.</p><p>This was a bloodthirsty vine that had lived for an unknown amount of time. It had been sealed for such a long time, yet it could still wake up. It was too shocking and made people’s hearts tremble.</p><p>Xue Feng had a bad premonition and didn’t dare to stay any longer. He wanted to take the Jade talisman and leave this place as soon as possible.</p><p>‘Squeak …’</p><p>At this moment, an ear-piercing sound was heard.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The mountain trembled, and at the highest point of the mountain, a huge protrusion shook and rocks exploded.</p><p>That was the main body of the bloodthirsty vine. The bloodthirsty vine was about to awaken completely. Just now, it was only the vines that had moved.</p><p>Just like an octopus, it had only moved its tentacles earlier, but now its main body was about to wake up.</p><p>Xue Feng transformed into a blood leopard and pounced forward, blocking many of the vines. The other cold-blood Hall disciples rushed toward the Jade talisman.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming swung his sword and cut off a vine. He then used the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps and charged toward the Jade talisman.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The Blood Sword slashed, and a terrifying blood-red sword mark cut through the sky, cutting more than a dozen cold-blood Hall experts in half.</p><p>“Little thief, I will kill you!”</p><p>die! Xue Feng roared. His eyes were bloodshot. So many experts had been killed by Lu Ming. He wanted to vomit blood.</p><p>Unfortunately, he was blocking a pile of vines alone and couldn’t get away at all.</p><p>cold-blood Hall will be the ones to die today!</p><p>kill! Lu Ming said coldly and charged forward, killing a few more people.</p><p>“That damned Lu Shaoqing!”</p><p>In front of him, Xue Luo Zi was terrified. He gritted his teeth and rushed toward the Jade talisman.</p><p>He was only a few dozen meters away from the Jade talisman.</p><p>But at this moment, a few vines rushed out from the ground and whipped towards him.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>He roared angrily, but he was blocked.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The rocks exploded, and more vines appeared around the Jade talisman, blocking all the cold-blood Hall experts.</p><p>“Lu Ming, leave the Jade talisman to me!”</p><p>Dandan spread rumors to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming grabbed dandan and threw her in the direction of the Jade talisman. He stared at blood Luo Zi.</p><p>He took a step forward and charged at Xue Luo Zi.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
