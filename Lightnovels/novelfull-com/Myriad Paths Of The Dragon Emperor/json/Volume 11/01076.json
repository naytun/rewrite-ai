With a wave of her hand, a few pills flew out. The pills glowed and turned into weapons that attacked the Ji family’s brawny man.</p><p>At the same time, Kong Xin also attacked the burly man from the Ji family. The three of them started a great battle.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming was brave and invincible. He stepped on the void and his fist strength was shocking.</p><p>The air kept exploding. Wu chengkong was forced to step back. He was at a complete disadvantage.</p><p>In the end, he let out a long howl and used the fusion of blood and meridians to form a combat sword. The sword Qi whistled as he fought Lu Ming.</p><p>To be honest, Wu chengkong was very powerful, much stronger than blood Luo Zi. He was indeed one of the most powerful Masters under the five magnates. He had the right to be proud.</p><p>However, his cultivation was still at the first level of the spiritual God Realm. Lu Ming had never been afraid of anyone at the same level.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>After a few consecutive punches, the combat sword was sent flying, and it kept vibrating in the air.</p><p>“Damn it, Who are you?”</p><p>impossible! Wu chengkong shouted in disbelief. He could not believe that a man who had appeared out of nowhere could have such terrifying combat power.</p><p>Not far away, Kong Xin and the others were also shocked. Wu chengkong was completely suppressed. It was too shocking. Who could do it except for the five magnates?</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Right at this moment, a terrifying explosion sounded from afar, and a blood-red light flew over at extreme speed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A burly figure appeared in the air. His eyes were like lightning, and the moment he saw Lu Ming, he burst out with a shocking killing intent.</p><p>“Lu Shaoqing, die!”</p><p>The figure let out a furious roar and threw a punch. A blood-red fist radiance pierced through the void and headed towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“Blood seal!”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. The figure was the previous top genius of cold-blood Hall, Xue Feng. He did not expect to see him here.</p><p>Lu Ming threw a backhanded punch and it collided with Xue Feng’s fist radiance. His body trembled and he retreated continuously.</p><p>Xue Feng was extremely powerful. He had a seventh level divine level bloodline and a cultivation base of the fourth level of the spiritual God Realm. His combat strength was truly terrifying.</p><p>Xue Feng stepped forward, his aura violent. His eyes were filled with killing intent as he glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, fairy Tan Xiang and Kong Xin were dumbfounded.</p><p>Lu Shaoqing?</p><p>Xue Feng had just called Lu Ming Lu Shaoqing. This dark-skinned young man was actually Lu Shaoqing?</p><p>After exchanging a blow with the Ji family’s brawny man, the two of them retreated far away and did not continue to attack.</p><p>Xue Feng’s arrival had made the situation even more complicated.</p><p>“Brother Lu, it’s you?”</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang said.</p><p>“Fairy, how have you been?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He remained calm in the face of Xue Feng.</p><p>“It’s really you!”</p><p>Kong Xin was also shocked.</p><p>At this time, Wu chengkong retreated far away and watched.</p><p>“This brat has offended Xue Feng. He’s really looking for death!”</p><p>Wu chengkong sneered.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Xue Feng roared as he stepped forward and threw a punch.</p><p>The space was shattered by the blood-red fist radiance. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>“Do you think I’m afraid of you?”</p><p>The third bloodline emerged, and a trace of energy surged into Lu Ming’s body. In an instant, Lu Ming’s body was filled with a terrifying killing intent, and his hair turned blood-red.</p><p>Then, the third bloodline turned into a combat sword. Lu Ming held it in his hand and slashed.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>A blood-red sword light flashed and split Xue Feng’s fist in half.</p><p>“Is that his bloodline? That’s strange, why is there no chakra?”</p><p>On the side, fairy Tan Xiang and the others were shocked.</p><p>First, he was shocked that Lu Ming had finally unleashed the power of his Blood Meridian. His combat strength was indeed stronger, and he had not used his full strength earlier.</p><p>Secondly, they were shocked. Lu Ming’s Blood Meridian did not have a chakra. This was unheard of.</p><p>“Damn it, this guy shouldn’t have a life talisman. I have to find a way to kill him. I’ll wait for the opportunity to attack when he fights against Xue Feng!”</p><p>Wu chengkong kept thinking.</p><p>Xue Feng was shocked to see Lu Ming break his fist radiance with one sword move. The vital essence in his body circulated crazily, and his aura became more violent.</p><p>“Blood leopard divine fist!”</p><p>Xue Feng’s fists were like blood jade as he continuously punched out with a blood-red light. In the process of flying out, he transformed into a blood leopard and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>This was a God-level martial technique that was incomparably powerful.</p><p>“Five slaughter styles!”</p><p>Lu Ming activated the five styles massacre. His blood-red sword buzzed and a sword ray slashed out, scattering the blood leopards one by one.</p><p>slaughter concept!</p><p>Xue Feng was shocked. At the same time, he was even more determined to get rid of Lu Ming. Lu Ming’s talent was too shocking. He was only at the first level of the spiritual God Realm and could fight with him.</p><p>The blood vessels appeared above his head. In the next moment, he transformed into a blood leopard and pounced at Lu Ming with a roar.</p><p>Lu Ming was fearless. He held his sword and fought Xue Feng.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was unparalleled and he was invincible among those of the same level. However, Xue Feng’s cultivation was three levels higher than Lu Ming’s. He was much more powerful. Moreover, he had also comprehended a divine level martial arts technique and was extremely powerful when he used the blood fusion.</p><p>Lu Ming exchanged dozens of moves with it and slowly fell into a disadvantage.</p><p>the difference in cultivation is too big. If I use the bloodline of the nine Dragons or the bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele, and with the power of the third bloodline, I might be able to fight this man.</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing.</p><p>However, this result had already shocked everyone else present to the point of no return.</p><p>I didn’t expect brother Lu’s combat power to be so strong. It’s amazing!</p><p>Kong Xin’s mouth was agape and tongue tied. After a while, she managed to squeeze out such a sentence.</p><p>He was also at the first level of the spiritual God Realm. However, he realized that if he were to fight with Lu Ming now, he would be killed easily.</p><p>On the other side, Wu chengkong’s sword was also shaking in fear.</p><p>If Lu Ming had used such a power just now, he would not have been able to resist at all. He was too strong.</p><p>that’s right. Even the five magnates, who are at the same level as him, might not be as strong as him!</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang sighed.</p><p>“Seal!”</p><p>In the middle of the battle, Lu Ming cast the nine seals of the divine Gate, forming a door of light. The light shone brightly and suppressed Xue Feng.</p><p>For a moment, Xue Feng was actually frozen in place.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and slashed at the blood leopard’s head.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The blood leopard roared angrily and a blood-red light exploded. With a bang, the light door was shattered at the critical moment. It continued to retreat but it was still a step too slow. A piece of its scalp was cut off. Then, Lu Ming lifted his leg and kicked the blood leopard’s stomach, sending it flying.</p><p>“What a pity!”</p><p>Lu Ming secretly felt that it was a pity.</p><p>His cultivation was still not strong enough. The sealed door he had formed had been broken by Xue Feng’s violent essential core. If Lu Ming’s cultivation was stronger or he had cultivated two sealed doors, it would not be so easy to break Xue Feng’s seal.</p><p>The sealing door was not omnipotent. If one’s cultivation level was too high, Lu Ming would naturally not be able to seal it.</p><p>Even so, Xue Feng’s body was already cold. He looked at Lu Ming with fear in his eyes.</p><p>He was almost killed by Lu Ming just now.</p><p>what kind of secret technique is this? it’s so terrifying!</p><p>He was so shocked that he did not dare to step forward and fight Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>This time, it was Lu Ming’s turn to take the initiative to kill. He stepped forward and charged at Xue ban.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Another sealing door appeared. Xue Feng was frightened and quickly retreated, not daring to let the sealing door touch him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
