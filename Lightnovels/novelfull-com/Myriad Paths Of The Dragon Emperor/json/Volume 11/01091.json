He followed the crowd and walked into the city gate.</p><p>...</p><p>There were soldiers standing guard at the city gates. Lu Ming swept his gaze across them and realized that these soldiers were all spirit embryo realm experts.</p><p>After a brief check, Lu Ming entered the holy city. At once, he was greeted with an ancient and simple aura.</p><p>In the sacred city, any Street, Palace, or house was filled with the aura of time, as if they had crossed time and space from millions of years ago.</p><p>the spiritual Qi of heaven and earth is so rich. It even contains origin Qi. Also, I can clearly sense the essence realm of heaven and earth. The entire sacred city is like a large array that continuously gathers the spiritual Qi and origin Qi of heaven and earth!</p><p>Lu Ming secretly sighed. If he cultivated here, his cultivation speed would definitely be very fast.</p><p>The holy city was divided into the outer city, the inner city, and the core of the palace.</p><p>Ordinary martial artists, small forces, and itinerant cultivators all lived in the outer city.</p><p>The inner city was occupied by some of the powerful forces in the sacred city, such as the mansions of the nobles and ministers of the ancient Saint dynasty. Of course, the other overlords of the central continent had branches in the sacred city and people were stationed there all year round.</p><p>As for the Royal Palace, it was where the core members of the Xie clan of the ancient Saint dynasty lived.</p><p>Lu Ming strolled around casually. He was in the outer city now.</p><p>He was thinking about how to sneak into the palace and find out about Xie nianqing.</p><p>After strolling around for a while, Lu Ming walked towards a restaurant. A restaurant was the best place to gather information.</p><p>After ordering a few dishes and wine, Lu Ming sat down at a table.</p><p>in another two months, the million-year National sacrifice of the ancient Saint dynasty will be here. At that time, the sacred city will be lively again!</p><p>that’s for sure, this is the million-year National sacrifice, how important is it? at that time, not only the Overlord forces of central continent, but other forces of all sizes will gather in the sacred city. Even forces from Western Desert, Northern Plains, Southern nether, and Eastern barren will send people over.</p><p>that’s really lively. It’s a rare sight. At that time, all the heaven’s favorites from all over the world will gather. This is a rare occasion!</p><p>that’s most likely the case. This generation is really full of experts. When the heaven’s favorites gather, there will inevitably be conflicts. Haha!</p><p>Lu Ming had just sat down when he heard some important news.</p><p>“A million-year National sacrifice?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>The Xie family of the ancient sacred dynasty had been established for a million years. It was truly shocking. In the entire divine wilderness, which faction could have such a long history? It was too shocking.</p><p>Even though the ancient Saint dynasty was on the decline, and the various emperors had their own territories, they still had to give the ancient Saint dynasty some respect in name. They still had to listen to the ancient Saint dynasty’s orders.</p><p>Of course, this was only in name.</p><p>Therefore, even if it was just for show, those powers still had to come to the million-year National sacrifice of the ancient Saint dynasty.</p><p>at that time, the emperors of some Overlord forces might descend. I’m really looking forward to it!</p><p>“Mm, when the time comes, the winds and clouds will definitely gather, and experts will be as numerous as clouds. I heard that the Imperial Palace has already issued an order to expand the Imperial Dragon guards to maintain order in the holy city and protect the Imperial Palace.”</p><p>“There’s such a thing? When do you want to start recruiting? I want to try!”</p><p>it has already started today. We’ve been recruiting for the past half a month, so we can give it a try. However, the Imperial Dragon Guard’s recruitment requirements are very high. Without a cultivation of the spirit embryo realm, it’s impossible to enter.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to listen and indeed, he heard a lot of news.</p><p>“The Imperial Dragon guards?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The Imperial Dragon guards were the Imperial Guards of the ancient Saint dynasty. They were responsible for guarding the palace and protecting the safety of the royal family.</p><p>Didn’t he want to sneak into the palace? Wouldn’t it be fine if he joined the Imperial Dragon guards?</p><p>However, the Imperial Dragon Guard was to guard the palace and protect the royal family. Their identities had to be thoroughly investigated before they could join. Otherwise, if anyone could join, then wouldn’t the safety of the royal family be at risk?</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze shifted. He picked up his wine glass and walked towards a table at the side.</p><p>“Two big Brothers, please. I heard you say that you wanted to join the Imperial Dragon guards, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming raised his glass and smiled.</p><p>At this table, there were two burly men. One looked to be in his forties, and the other looked to be in his thirties with a full beard.</p><p>“That’s right. What can I do for you, little brother?”</p><p>The strong man with a full beard looked at Lu Ming and asked.</p><p>“This little brother comes from a small force and has just entered the holy city. I want to find a job and join the Imperial Dragon guards. I heard the two of you talking about this matter just now. Perhaps we can work together in the future, so I wanted to make friends with you.”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>Upon hearing Lu Ming’s words, their expressions relaxed and they smiled.</p><p>“He’s the one who wants to join, so I won’t go. However, little brother, the conditions to join the Imperial Dragon guards aren’t low. You need to be at the spirit embryo realm.”</p><p>The 40-odd tough man laughed.</p><p>that’s just as well. This little brother has just broken through to the spirit embryo realm. It’s just in time to give it a try!</p><p>With that, Lu Ming’s body emitted a faint aura. It was the aura of the first level spirit embryo realm.</p><p>Not only could the illusionary breath technique change one’s aura, but it could also hide one’s cultivation.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming was hiding his cultivation to the first level of the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>When they realized that Lu Ming’s cultivation was only at the first level spirit embryo realm, the two of them were even more relieved. The burly man with a full beard said, ” little brother, you’re so young, yet you’re able to reach the first level of spirit embryo realm. You can be considered a heaven’s favorite. I’m impressed!</p><p>you’re overpraising me, Big Brothers. Come, let’s drink to our hearts ‘content!</p><p>Lu Ming said generously.</p><p>“Haha, how can I accept this!”</p><p>The man in his forties laughed.</p><p>This was the holy city. The food and wine in any restaurant were not cheap. Since Lu Ming was treating them, the two of them had a better impression of him.</p><p>The three of them continued drinking. Lu Ming was new to the holy city and did not know much about it. He asked the two of them for advice and they told him everything they knew.</p><p>Lu Ming learned that the two of them came from a small force outside the holy city called the black spear sect. They were not far from the holy city and often came to the holy city to purchase items.</p><p>The man in his forties was called Ma Wu, and the man in his thirties with a full beard was called Ming Lu.</p><p>“Minglu, what a coincidence, my name is read backwards, isn’t that Minglu?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile.</p><p>The three of them chatted and drank. After three rounds of drinking, Ma Wu and Ming Lu drank to their hearts ‘content.</p><p>“Junior Brother Ming Lu, since you want to join the Imperial Dragon Guard, then stay here and sign up with little brother Lu. I’ll return to the sect first and tell you about your matter. If you work in the Imperial Dragon Guard, it’ll be much more convenient for our black spear sect in the future!”</p><p>Ma Wu said.</p><p>alright, senior brother MA, you can go back first. I’ll go and register tomorrow!</p><p>Ming Lu nodded.</p><p>After that, Ma Wu bade farewell and left. Lu Ming and Ming Lu found an Inn nearby to stay in and planned to register the next day.</p><p>Very soon, night fell. Lu Ming concealed his aura and entered Ming Lu’s room without a sound.</p><p>“Who …”</p><p>Ming Lu had just opened his mouth when Lu Ming struck out with his palm and knocked Ming Lu out. Then, he kept Ming Lu into the mountain and river diagram and let dan dan inscribe an array, trapping him on the ground.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I’ll borrow your identity for a while. I’ll definitely compensate you in the future!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. His muscles and bones began to wriggle, transforming into Minglu’s appearance. Then, his aura changed as well, becoming very similar to Minglu’s.</p><p>“I’m still missing a beard!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and left the inn. He bought a fake beard and stuck it on his face. Instantly, he looked exactly like Ming Lu. Even if Ma Wu was by his side, he would not be able to recognize that Lu Ming was a fake.</p><p>Lu Ming had used Ming Lu’s identity to sneak into the Imperial Dragon guards, waiting for an opportunity to find out Xie nianqing’s whereabouts.</p><p>As for Minglu, he could only temporarily stay in the mountain and river diagram.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
