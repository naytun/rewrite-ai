After Nirvana, one’s bloodline would have a chance to upgrade. However, the upgrade level was not fixed. It depended on one’s potential and luck.</p><p>...</p><p>Some people could advance one level, some could advance two levels, and some could even advance higher.</p><p>Heavens! This kind of medicinal pill was seriously too heaven-defying.</p><p>It was very difficult to level up one’s bloodline after birth.</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons was a special case.</p><p>In addition, Xie nianqing’s bloodline was special. With the help of Emperor Cang, he achieved the Nirvana of his bloodline and evolved.</p><p>Throughout his journey, Lu Ming had only seen Xie nianqing’s Nirvana bloodline upgrade once. He had not seen or even heard of it.</p><p>And this Nirvana elixir was actually so heaven-defying. If this news were to spread, it would probably cause chaos in the world and set off endless waves.</p><p>Think about it, if a martial artist with a ninth level King bloodline were to take the Nirvana elixir, even if he were to advance by one level, he would most likely be promoted to a divine bloodline and have the qualification to break through to the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>For some martial artists with divine bloodlines, if they could upgrade their bloodline by one or two levels, their talent would undoubtedly be higher and they would be able to go further in the future.</p><p>This was especially so for those Supreme geniuses who had awakened divine level six, seven, or even eight. If they were to consume it, they might even be able to advance to the highest divine level, level nine. Just how alluring and heaven-defying was this?</p><p>It would be strange if people didn’t go crazy after knowing about it.</p><p>However, according to the records, every warrior only had one chance. After taking the Nirvana pill once, the second time would have no effect. It would create resistance, but it would not reduce the value of the Nirvana pill.</p><p>back then, cold-blood Hall made a big move and said that a treasure had been taken away. Zhou Xin happened to be there, could it be …</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming thought of many things.</p><p>They had met Zhou Xin in the ancient herb garden, but she did not want to work with Lu Ming. She wanted to work alone. Later on, cold-blood Hall seemed to be looking for a treasure in the ancient herb garden, but it was taken away. It led to a large-scale operation by cold-blood Hall. They blocked the teleportation array and even besieged them on the plain, demanding them to hand over their storage rings.</p><p>There, Lu Ming met Zhou Xin again and saved her.</p><p>Logically speaking, Zhou Xin’s cultivation level was not high. In such a situation, it was very likely that she would hand over her storage ring to save her life. However, Zhou Xin did not do so. She had no intention of handing over her storage ring.</p><p>At that time, Lu Ming did not think too much about it. However, when he saw the pill formula of the Nirvana elixir, he could not help but link all of these together.</p><p>Perhaps, Zhou Xin had obtained this elixir recipe from the ancient medicine garden and the reason why cold-blood Hall had mobilized so many people was most likely to find this elixir recipe.</p><p>He did not expect that it would eventually fall into Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>Although the pill formula was not of much use to Lu Ming as he had the nine Dragons bloodline and did not need the Nirvana pill to improve his bloodline, he was still very excited.</p><p>To him, although it was not of much use, he had family and friends. This kind of pill formula would be of great use to his family and friends.</p><p>“However, the spirit herbs required to refine the Nirvana pill are too rare!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed again.</p><p>Although the Nirvana elixir was heaven-defying, the materials and spiritual herbs it required were extremely rare. It required dozens of spiritual herbs and materials. Most of the supplementary materials were the top grade of level eight, and seven of the main materials were level nine.</p><p>Moreover, they were the best of level-nine materials. Lu Ming was speechless. It was extremely difficult to collect these materials.</p><p>forget it. There’s no rush. Take it slow!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He memorized the pill formula of the Nirvana elixir and kept it in the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Then, he opened the secret manual of the illusionary breath technique and started reading.</p><p>Next, Lu Ming cultivated the illusionary breath technique as he moved forward.</p><p>Time passed day by day. It had been a month since Lu Ming left the Zhou family.</p><p>One day, Lu Ming arrived at a huge city.</p><p>This city was incomparably majestic, filled with vicissitudes and a Grand and domineering aura.</p><p>On the city gate, there were three big words-world city.</p><p>“I actually came to world city.”</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly stunned.</p><p>The world city was next to the world Academy. It was one of the ten ancient cities of the central continent and had a long history.</p><p>The Tianxia Academy was located Northwest of the sky Eagle Castle. Lu Ming had unknowingly crossed the sky Eagle castle’s territory and arrived at the Tianxia Academy.</p><p>Since he was here, Lu Ming naturally had to go and take a look.</p><p>After entering world city, he realized that it was really bustling with people coming and going.</p><p>“Eh? Why are there so many Young heaven’s favorites?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little surprised. On the streets, he could see young geniuses walking by from time to time in groups of three to five. Each of them had an imposing appearance, beautiful looks, and the potential of Dragons and phoenixes.</p><p>They were definitely powerful elites. Lu Ming could sense that many of them had awakened divine bloodlines.</p><p>Although the central continent had many outstanding talents and many times more heaven’s favorites than the East continent, it was still unrealistic to meet a group of divine level heaven’s favorites in a big city.</p><p>could it be that something big has happened in Tianxia city or Tianxia Academy that has gathered so many geniuses? ”</p><p>Lu Ming made a guess.</p><p>“Eh? Who is that?”</p><p>Lu Ming was suddenly stunned. He discovered two familiar faces.</p><p>Blood Sword one and corpse battle!</p><p>The heavenly corpse sect’s Blood Sword had appeared in the central continent, in the world city, in a battle with a corpse. This surprised Lu Ming.</p><p>interesting. The most powerful sovereign of the heavenly corpse sect is here. Did the divine Emperor and the others come? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile.</p><p>Blood Sword one and corpse warrior did not notice Lu Ming. Instead, they walked into a shop.</p><p>Lu Ming came to a secret place and his body began to change. After a while, he turned into a dark-faced honest young man. Then, he activated the illusionary breath technique and his aura changed.</p><p>Now, no matter how familiar they were with Lu Ming, they would not be able to recognize him when they stood in front of him.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and strode down the street. In front of him, Xue Jian and corpse warrior walked out of the shop and walked past Lu Ming, but they did not react at all.</p><p>He completely treated Lu Ming as a stranger.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled in satisfaction and walked into a restaurant.</p><p>“Did you guys hear? A month ago, the cold-blood Hall disciple also broke through to the spiritual God Realm!”</p><p>“What? Blood Luo Zi had also broken through? Xue Luo Zi is not very strong among the second-grade heaven’s favorites, but I didn’t expect him to have a breakthrough. It seems that most of the second-grade heaven’s favorites have broken through to the spiritual God Realm!”</p><p>the top five young warriors have all broken through to the spiritual God Realm a year ago. Now, even the second-grade heaven’s favorites have broken through to the spiritual God Realm. From now on, the world will belong to the younger generation. The younger generation will be ushering in the era of spiritual gods!</p><p>in the same era, there are actually so many young geniuses who have entered the spiritual God Realm. This is unbelievable!</p><p>Lu Ming heard a discussion not long after he entered the restaurant.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded to himself. It had been more than a year since the ancient herb garden. It was normal for those second-grade geniuses to step into the spiritual God Realm one after another.</p><p>After all, those geniuses had powerful forces supporting them. They did not have to worry about resources at all. Lu Ming could not compare to them.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
