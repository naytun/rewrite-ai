He did not know where he was drifting to. Slowly, his mind became more and more confused as if his memories were fading.</p><p>...</p><p>Everything that had happened in the past seemed to have become blurry and slowly dissipated.</p><p>Slowly, Lu Ming became ignorant.</p><p>After an unknown period of time, Lu Ming suddenly sat up.</p><p>With a creak, he found that he was sitting on a bed.</p><p>“Where is this place? What’s wrong with me? I felt like I had a very long dream just now!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at his surroundings in confusion.</p><p>At this moment, the door opened and a beautiful young lady walked in. She was fourteen to fifteen years old and was very beautiful. When she saw that Lu Ming had woken up, she immediately smiled happily and cheered, ” “Brother Ming, you’re finally awake. You really scared me!”</p><p>“Yao ‘er!”</p><p>Looking at Lu Yao’s worried expression, Lu Ming’s heart felt warm. He then asked,”Yao ‘er, what happened to me? I remember I went to awaken my bloodline three days ago. What happened after that?”</p><p>brother Ming, you went to awaken your bloodline three days ago. During the process, you suddenly fainted. You have been in a coma for three days. In these three days, you have been having nightmares and calling strange names like Di Yi. Brother Ming, are you okay? ”</p><p>Lu Yao was a little worried.</p><p>“I’m fine. It’s just a nightmare!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>He really had a dream, a very, very long dream. But for some reason, the dream in his mind was getting more and more blurry, and he almost couldn’t remember it.</p><p>He only had a vague feeling that in that dream, Lu Yao left him, and he later obtained a treasure, cultivated into a strong man, and went on an adventure on the continent …</p><p>He only had a vague impression of it, but the more he thought about it, the more blurry and ethereal the dream became.</p><p>“What a strange dream!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>He, Lu Ming, was just a useless young master in fiery wind city who could not cultivate. Why would he have such a strange dream?</p><p>“Yao ‘er, did I fail in my bloodline awakening?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Brother Ming!”</p><p>Lu Yao wanted to say something but stopped.</p><p>“Tell me, I’m fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Brother Ming, it’s a failure, but it’s fine. Even if you can’t cultivate, you won’t change in Yao ‘er’s heart. My father and your mother have already discussed it. We’ll hold our wedding in half a month!”</p><p>Lu Yao blinked his eyes and said. After he finished, he was a little shy and his face was a little red.</p><p>“The wedding will be held in half a month?”</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly stunned. At that moment, he did not know why, but he felt an inexplicable pain in his heart. A figure appeared in his mind. The figure was very blurry and he could not see its face clearly. It was someone he had met in his dream.</p><p>It was a woman!</p><p>A sense of reluctance surged in Lu Ming’s heart.</p><p>This figure seemed to be very important to him.</p><p>“She … Who was it? Why do I feel my heart ache? Was it really a dream?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned and mumbled to himself.</p><p>“Brother Ming, what happened? Don’t scare Yao ‘er!”</p><p>Lu Yao called out.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He came to his senses and smiled.”I’m fine. I’m just thinking about that dream again!”</p><p>“Brother Ming, it’s just a dream. Don’t think too much and drink your medicine!”</p><p>Lu Yao picked up the medicine at the side and fed it to Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, two people walked into the room.</p><p>One was a beautiful woman, and the other was a beautiful teenage girl.</p><p>“Mother, Qiuyue!”</p><p>Lu Ming called out.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, have a good rest. You’re going to be the groom in half a month!”</p><p>Li Ping smiled slightly and revealed a doting expression.</p><p>“That’s right, young master. Qiuyue wants to congratulate you!”</p><p>The young girl at the side said in a sweet voice.</p><p>“Qiuyue!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Qiu Yue. In the dream, Qiu Yue seemed to have become a martial arts genius, but it was only a ‘seemingly’ feeling. Lu Ming felt that the dream had become more muddled and was slowly fading away as time passed.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, you’ve just woken up, so you should rest well. Don’t let your thoughts run wild!”</p><p>Li Ping said. Then, she left the room with Qiu Yue and Lu Yao.</p><p>“That dream … That’s strange. Who is that figure?”</p><p>In the room, Lu Ming was lying on the bed in a daze.</p><p>Time passed very quickly. As the days went by, Lu Ming’s body recovered quickly.</p><p>The dream in his mind was also becoming more and more blurry. As time passed, it became more and more blurry. He believed that he would completely forget it very soon.</p><p>But for some reason? Every time he thought of that dream, a figure would appear, causing Lu Ming’s heart to ache.</p><p>“Who was that figure? Why does it feel so real?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. It was a woman’s figure, which was hard to erase from his mind.</p><p>In the Lu clan’s backyard, a small stream flowed by. There was a Pavilion beside the small stream, and in the pavilion, a young man and a young woman were snuggling up to each other.</p><p>“Brother Ming, Yao ‘er is going to marry you tomorrow. I’ll never be separated from you again!”</p><p>Lu Yao said in a low voice, his eyes showing anticipation and shyness.</p><p>Lu Ming hugged Lu Yao, feeling extremely relaxed. The gentle breeze on his Buddha’s face revealed a faint floral fragrance.</p><p>“This way … That’s good!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the sky and thought of this.</p><p>If he couldn’t cultivate, then so be it. If he could live an ordinary life, wouldn’t that be good?</p><p>Lu Ming really enjoyed such a life.</p><p>That dream was a dream after all. Let it drift away with the wind!</p><p>Only that figure could not be erased. It would occasionally appear in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>“Lu Ming, wake up!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming heard a voice.</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. He turned to look around but did not see anyone. Lu Yao was still in his arms, as if he had not heard anything.</p><p>“What are you looking at? I’m here, in the stream!”</p><p>The voice rang out again. Lu Ming was shocked and quickly looked at the stream. He saw a little turtle floating in the stream, staring at him.</p><p>“You … You … You’re talking to me?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p>“What are you looking at, if it’s not this seat, who can it be?”</p><p>The little turtle berated.</p><p>“Brother Ming, what’s wrong? Who are you talking to?”</p><p>Lu Yao looked at Lu Ming in surprise.</p><p>Taking a deep breath to calm himself down, Lu Ming said, ” it’s nothing. You heard wrong. Yao ‘er, you can go back first. I’ll go and welcome you tomorrow!</p><p>“En, okay. Yao ‘er will wait for you!”</p><p>Lu Yao blinked his eyes and jogged away.</p><p>Immediately after, Lu Ming looked at the little turtle and was extremely surprised. “A turtle, no, a turtle can actually speak. Could it be the legendary King-class turtle? no, senior, senior. Junior Lu Ming greets senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming bowed to the little turtle.</p><p>In his memory, only the legendary King-level demonic beasts could speak.</p><p>He was shocked to find a King-level demonic beast in the backyard of the Lu family.</p><p>There might not even be a King-tier demonic beast in the entire blazing sun Empire.</p><p>“King-tier my ass! I’m the World Turtle, the top of the top ten war beasts. What King-tier? you’re not even fit to carry my shoes. Kid, Lu Ming, you’ve been hit by an illusion. You’re in an illusion. Why don’t you wake up? do you want to sink into it for the rest of your life?”</p><p>The little turtle shouted.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
