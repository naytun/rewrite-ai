It was extremely shocking, and even from far away, it could be seen.</p><p>...</p><p>After a long while, Western Desert’s Saint monk put away the disc, and the light pillar disappeared.</p><p>This was because there were many streaks of light flashing over from the distance. Someone had been attracted here.</p><p>“What is this guy trying to do?”</p><p>Lu Ming, who was hiding not far away, saw everything.</p><p>The Holy monk kept the disc and returned to the entrance of the dark cave. He shouted, ” “The treasure in this cave is mine!”</p><p>After shouting, his figure flashed and he quickly left the cave.</p><p>Not long after, more than ten streaks of light flew over, revealing more than ten figures.</p><p>“The treasure is in the cave, kill!”</p><p>“We can’t let anyone else get there first.”</p><p>“Get lost, it’s mine!”</p><p>More than a dozen experts directly rushed into the cave.</p><p>Roar! Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>Inside the cave, the wild roars of ferocious beasts came out. The entire ground was shaking, and an intense battle was taking place in the cave.</p><p>“This guy is killing with a borrowed knife!”</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p><p>Didn’t they say that the Holy monks of the Western Desert were all kind-hearted and would save all living beings? This guy was too unreliable. Could he be a fake?</p><p>“I have rice hair (I don’t have hair), Buddha is merciful!”</p><p>That guy chanted the name of Buddha again. His figure flashed, but he did not enter the cave. Instead, he went in another direction.</p><p>this guy is very mysterious. Let’s go and take a look!</p><p>Lu Ming quietly followed behind the Western Desert Saint monk and came to a place dozens of miles away.</p><p>There was a huge cave in this place.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming heard a deafening roar coming from the cave, which gradually faded into the distance.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded. He finally understood what this guy’s purpose was.</p><p>This cave was connected to the cave tens of li away. Western Desert’s guy had used the others in that cave to lure the beasts away, so he could easily enter from this cave and find the treasure.</p><p>How was this a merciful Saint monk? this was clearly an unscrupulous monk.</p><p>The monk sneakily looked around. Lu Ming finally saw his face.</p><p>She had a baby face, slightly chubby, and smooth skin that made women jealous. She was pink and tender, and she looked harmless.</p><p>He looked around, chanted the name of Buddha, and rushed into the cave.</p><p>“This guy is really not a good person!”</p><p>On his shoulder, dan dan looked at him with disdain.</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips and thought,’you are similar to him!’</p><p>there must be some treasure in this cave. Let’s go in and take a look!</p><p>Lu Ming also rushed into the cave carefully.</p><p>The cave was huge, and after a few thousand meters, it became even wider, like a huge underground cave.</p><p>In front of them, there were still faint rumbles. It was obvious that the battle was extremely intense.</p><p>nest, I saw a few pits. There must be spirit herbs growing there, but they were all dug out by that monk. What a pity!</p><p>Dandan sighed. The two of them moved forward and found that the underground caves were criss-crossed, and the monk’s figure had long disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming walked forward casually and suddenly stopped. A purple light attracted his attention.</p><p>On one of the walls, a hazy purple light was emitted. It was hazy and beautiful.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated his essential core and wiped off the rock on the surface. A purple crystal the size of a longan appeared.</p><p>“These are purple flame crystals.” After the initial shock, Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>The purple flame crystal was a precious material that was extremely rare.</p><p>It could be used to refine weapons and could also be used to refine pills. It was priceless.</p><p>The most important thing was that the purple flame crystal was one of the most important main ingredients in refining the Nirvana elixir. It was a level nine material.</p><p>Lu Ming did not expect to encounter a purple flame crystal here. He immediately condensed his vital essence into a knife and dug out the surrounding rocks to dig out the purple flame crystal.</p><p>“It’s so heavy!”</p><p>A purple flame crystal the size of a Dragon’s Eye, yet it weighed more than 5000 kilograms. It was truly shocking.</p><p>“I don’t know if there are any more!” After Lu Ming kept the purple flame crystal, he looked around carefully.</p><p>It would be great if he could find a few more.</p><p>Although the Nirvana elixir was not of much use to Lu Ming, it was very useful to others.</p><p>For example, if fatty Kong Jin had Nirvana pills, he could even raise his third bloodline to the ninth level of the divine level.</p><p>His parents, his disciples, Xie nianqing, and Mu Lan would all be of great use to him in the future.</p><p>If there was a chance, Lu Ming wanted to collect the materials and refine a few furnaces.</p><p>After walking around for a while, Lu Ming indeed discovered something. A purple light was emitting from a wall.</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was about to dig, a terrifying gust of wind attacked him.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He turned around and struck out a palm.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A terrifying force gushed toward Lu Ming and he could not help but take a few steps back.</p><p>“What a tyrannical power!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked. Although he did not release his dragon energy just now, his vital essence was extremely robust. In addition to the five types of concepts and the prison suppressing heaven technique, he could kill an ordinary second level spiritual God Realm martial artist with a single palm strike. However, he was now forced to retreat.</p><p>“My hair!”</p><p>A Buddhist chant was heard and a harmless face appeared in front of Lu Ming. It was the monk.</p><p>He looked very young, in his twenties. He squinted his eyes and smiled. He put his hands together and said, this benefactor, the fierce beast in this cave was lured away by a Monk’s Friend. It’s not good for you to take advantage of it like this, right? ”</p><p>Even when he spoke, the monk was still smiling.</p><p>Lu Ming and dandan looked down on them.</p><p>Those people were clearly tricked by the monk, but they became his friends in his mouth. How shameless.</p><p>“Master, everyone who saw it has a share. I saw all of your methods just now. If word gets out, I’m afraid it won’t be good for the reputation of Western Desert’s Saint monk!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>my hair is white, my Buddha is merciful. I think you have misunderstood, benefactor. A monk should be merciful …</p><p>The baby-faced monk chanted the name of Buddha.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Tyrant hadn’t finished his words when a loud roar was heard. A giant lizard with purple flames lunged at tyrant.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Tyrant’s body glowed with a golden light. He struck out a palm and a huge Golden Palm print landed on the purple Lizard’s body. With a loud bang, the lizard was smashed into pieces.</p><p>“Mercy?”</p><p>Lu Ming was tongue-tied.</p><p>“My hair is white, my Buddha is merciful!”</p><p>The monk chanted the name of Buddha again and looked at Lu Ming,”Benefactor, this little monk has taken a fancy to this purple flame crystal. Why don’t you give it to this little monk?”</p><p>“So What if I don’t?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“My hair is as white as rice, my Buddha …”</p><p>hair your head! I know you don’t have hair!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and suddenly launched an attack.</p><p>The Dragon power in his body burst out, and his strength increased greatly. He threw a punch at the unscrupulous monk.</p><p>Wuliang monk’s body shone brightly. The dazzling golden light spread out, making the unscrupulous monk look like the reincarnation of Buddha. He looked solemn.</p><p>In addition, he had a harmless face. If Lu Ming had not secretly seen him before, he would really think that he was an eminent monk.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The heartless monk struck out with his palm and the Golden Palm print collided with Lu Ming’s fist.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
