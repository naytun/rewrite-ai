This was too shocking.</p><p>However, after his cultivation broke through to the ninth level of the spirit embryo realm, Lu Ming’s combat strength had increased by a large margin. His vital essence was vast and abundant, and the prison suppressing heaven technique could be more powerful.</p><p>I wonder if I can fight Yin BUPO and blood Luo Zi with my current combat power? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Xue Luozi and Yin BUPO were both at the peak of the ninth level spirit embryo realm, while Lu Ming was at the early stage of the ninth level spirit embryo realm. This was similar to his battle with the Emperor God in the battle of Providence.</p><p>However, at that time, Lu Ming had to use all his means and the array to suppress the Emperor God.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not have the Dao of inscription, but he had integrated the concept of water. If Lu Ming could use all his skills and perform the blood Meridian fusion, he was confident that he could suppress Xue Luo Zi or Yin BUPO. However, if he could not perform the blood Meridian fusion, Lu Ming was not confident.</p><p>But at least, Lu Ming was confident that he would not lose.</p><p>“There’s still three days before the pill King banquet, let’s go to pill city first!”</p><p>Lu Ming stood up and walked out of the room. He sensed that Chu Kuang and Zhang Wenjin’s rooms were empty. They must have gone out for a walk.</p><p>The city of pills was like a huge commercial city. There were shops everywhere and there were countless types of spiritual herbs and pills. It was an eye-opener for Lu Ming.</p><p>In some shops, one could even buy level eight medicinal pills, but the price was terrifying.</p><p>In some places, stalls were set up. The stall owners would sell some strange things. Some might be rare treasures, while others might just be waste.</p><p>Such a place was called the Taobao area.</p><p>It was mainly a test of luck. If one was lucky, they might be able to buy something of high value.</p><p>Of course, one also needed to have good eyesight. This place had attracted a lot of people.</p><p>There were many people on the street. Lu Ming strolled among the crowd, looking to the east and West.</p><p>On her shoulder, dandan’s eyes were also looking around.</p><p>Upon arriving here, dandan became spirited and declared that with his eyesight, no treasure could escape his eyes.</p><p>Unfortunately, he didn’t find anything after walking around.</p><p>The things here were strange. Some of the so-called spirit herbs were just weeds on the side of the road and were used to fool people. Some of the abandoned spirit weapons were used as battle weapons from the ancient times. Some people even took a few stones and said that there were rare treasures in the stones. They were also sold at a high price.</p><p>Once this was sold, it would be a huge profit.</p><p>“That is … Lu Ming, that piece of purple jade in front, yes, the purple jade that the chick is buying. Buy it. It’s very useful!”</p><p>Lu Ming was looking around when dandan’s voice suddenly rang in his ears. She looked very excited.</p><p>Lu Ming’s spirit was lifted and he looked forward.</p><p>Two young women were standing in front of a stall. One of the young women was taking a purple jade from the stall owner.</p><p>The purple jade that dandan was talking about was this one.</p><p>that purple jade is very ordinary. Could it be a treasure? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was surprised.</p><p>“You can’t compare to my judgment. Lu Ming, you’ll definitely make a big profit if you buy it!”</p><p>Dandan shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming no longer hesitated. He strode forward to the front of the stall and pretended to take a casual glance at the purple jade in the woman’s hand. He said casually,”Eh? This piece of purple jade is not bad. I can buy it to make a jade pendant for my sister. This big brother, how much is this purple jade?”</p><p>The stall owner was a middle-aged man. He smiled and said, ” “Young master, you’re late. This purple jade has just been bought by this lady.”</p><p>“You bought it?”</p><p>Lu Ming felt that it was a pity. He then sized up the young woman.</p><p>The young woman was very beautiful. She was in her twenties and could be considered a rare beauty.</p><p>Behind her, there was another woman. From her appearance, she should be a maidservant.</p><p>“Miss, can you let me have this purple jade?”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>“Hey, my lady bought this piece of purple jade first. Why should she let you have it?”</p><p>The maidservant behind the woman called out first.</p><p>“It’s nothing. I just saw that this purple jade is quite beautiful and wanted to buy it to make a jade pendant for my younger sister. Since this young lady has bought it first, then this one will not take it from her!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled, cupped his fists, and was about to leave.</p><p>Although it was a pity to miss it, Lu Ming would not take it by force since it had already been bought.</p><p>“Young master, please wait!”</p><p>At this moment, the young woman called out and Lu Ming stopped.</p><p>actually, I only bought this purple jade because I thought it looked good. It’s not of much use to me. Since you like it so much, I’ll give it to you!</p><p>The young lady stepped forward and handed the purple jade to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was rather surprised and did not pick it up.</p><p>“Brat, quickly accept it. If you don’t, you’ll regret it!”</p><p>Dandan constantly transmitted her voice to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment and reached out to take the purple jade. I’m lu Shaoqing. Thank you for giving me this Jade. I wonder what your name is. If there’s a chance in the future, I’ll definitely repay you for this Jade!</p><p>“I am Zhou Xin. Young master Lu is too polite!”</p><p>The young woman smiled.</p><p>“So it’s miss Zhou. Miss Zhou is also here to participate in the pill King banquet?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>that’s right. It seems like young master Lu has the same purpose as me!</p><p>Zhou Xin smiled and looked around.</p><p>After that, the two of them chatted for a while before Lu Ming took his leave. This was because dandan was urging Lu Ming to go back and cut open the purple jade. There would definitely be a surprise.</p><p>“Miss, why did you give that purple jade to that kid?”</p><p>After Lu Ming left, the maidservant said unhappily.</p><p>“Silly girl, what is this place? This time, there are quite a few young talents from the pill city who have come to attend the banquet. This man looks extraordinary, so he might be a heaven’s chosen. Why not use a useless piece of purple jade to make friends with a heaven’s chosen?”</p><p>Zhou Xin smiled.</p><p>“Miss is wise!”</p><p>The servant girl flattered.</p><p>……</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming returned to the inn. After entering his room, he entered the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>His palm glowed, and the purple jade appeared in his hand.</p><p>This piece of purple jade looked very ordinary. Could it be that there was really a rare treasure in the purple jade?</p><p>“Lu Ming, cut this purple jade open. Be careful!”</p><p>Dandan instructed.</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out his finger. His essential core spread out and condensed into a sharp sword, slowly cutting toward the purple jade.</p><p>The purple jade was about the size of two fists. Lu Ming cut it carefully. When he was halfway through, a faint milky white halo spread out.</p><p>There was really something in the purple jade!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He slowly cut the purple jade around him, leaving behind a milky white jade the size of a longan in his hand.</p><p>“What kind of Jade is this?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little curious. This piece of Jade looked ordinary and did not look like a rare treasure at all.</p><p>“Brat, is the dimensional stone considered a rare treasure?”</p><p>Dandan grinned.</p><p>“What? This is a storage elemental stone?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes widened.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
