It was the third bloodline. Then, a trace of blood light surged into Lu Ming’s body. In an instant, Lu Ming’s body was covered in blood light. His long black hair turned blood red, and his eyes were like bright red rubies, emitting endless killing intent.</p><p>...</p><p>The third Blood Meridian squirmed and transformed into a combat sword that Lu Ming held in his hand.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The combat sword slashed down and the space cracked. A blood-red sword light with a hint of black cut through the sky and slashed at the three black Panthers.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>As the sword light slashed, the three black Panthers ‘attacks were destroyed. The sword light continued forward, cutting the three black Panthers in half.</p><p>The three-headed Black Panther, which was equivalent to the second level of the spiritual God Realm, was killed by Lu Ming with a single slash.</p><p>After breaking through to the spiritual God Realm, Lu Ming’s combat strength had increased too much. Just now, he had only used the power of his third bloodline.</p><p>He didn’t use his dragon power or intent.</p><p>Of course, at the spiritual God Realm, Lu Ming naturally could not kill enemies that were five to six levels higher than him like he was at the spirit embryo realm. That was unrealistic.</p><p>To be able to cross over to the spiritual God Realm, they were already the cream of the crop. When they were in the spirit embryo realm, they were already able to kill enemies that were several levels higher. When facing such a cream of the crop, Lu Ming naturally could not kill enemies that were five or six levels higher. That would be too exaggerated.</p><p>Moreover, the difference between each level of the spiritual God Realm was extremely huge.</p><p>Lu Ming was not sure how many levels he could kill if he went all out.</p><p>“When I borrow the power of the third bloodline, it actually contains a powerful slaughter domain!”</p><p>With a thought, the third bloodline entered Lu Ming’s body. His hair turned black again, the blood-red light disappeared, and so did his killing intent. He returned to his original appearance, but he was a little surprised.</p><p>The killing intent domain was an extremely terrifying intent domain. It was filled with killing intent and was extremely terrifying. This kind of intent domain was one of the most terrifying intent domains in the world. It was not weaker than the time and space intent domains.</p><p>This was not the concept that Lu Ming had personally comprehended. However, he could borrow it when he used his third Blood Meridian.</p><p>Although Lu Ming did not comprehend it himself, it could be used as his killing move. Lu Ming was very satisfied.</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons emerged, and with a palm force, he devoured the blood essence and demonic power of the three black Panthers. Then, with a flash of his body, he left the place.</p><p>Tens of thousands of miles away, Lu Ming was sitting cross-legged, refining the energy of the three black Panthers ‘blood essence.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline emerged and shook continuously. Its six golden chakras were extremely bright. Not long after, the seventh golden chakra emerged.</p><p>His prison-suppressing stele bloodline had also advanced to divine Level 7.</p><p>Along the way, Lu Ming had killed many ferocious beasts and refined their blood essence. Now, he had finally accumulated enough to advance the prison-suppressing stele bloodline to divine Level Seven, which was on par with the nine Dragons bloodline.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s cultivation did not improve much. He had only reached the middle stage of the first level spiritual God Realm.</p><p>After refining the energy of the three black Panthers, the dimensional stone appeared in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>Lu Ming continuously channeled his essential core into the NA Yuan stone. When Lu Ming’s essential core was almost completely depleted, the NA Yuan stone was full.</p><p>sure enough, it’s similar to my previous speculation. This Yuan storage stone can only store my true essence of the first level of the spiritual God Realm. If my cultivation continues to improve, this Yuan storage stone won’t be of much use!</p><p>Lu Ming kept the storage elemental stone and took out the rough stone to devour and recover.</p><p>When Lu Ming’s essential core had fully recovered, he waved his hand and a pile of storage rings appeared in the air.</p><p>Most of these storage rings came from the Zhou family, as well as some from the experts he had killed previously. Lu Ming had not been able to sort them out properly before this. Now was the perfect time to do so.</p><p>Lu Ming was already very familiar with sorting out the storage ring. He first categorized the items, separating the valuable items, rare items that Lu Ming did not recognize, and the rest.</p><p>Lu Ming spent an entire day tidying up everything.</p><p>“There are only about a million raw gemstones left!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>The Zhou family’s master, patriarch, and a few elders were all at the spiritual God Realm. There were a few million raw gemstones in total. However, Lu Ming had used more than half of them to break through to the spiritual God Realm. Now, he only had about a million left.</p><p>If Lu Ming used one million origin stones to improve his cultivation now, he was afraid that it would not even be enough to advance to the second level of the spiritual God Realm. It would not be of much use.</p><p>There were also a few other miscellaneous items that were not worth much.</p><p>“What’s in this box? They’re so heavily protected?”</p><p>Lu Ming found a box in the Zhou family head’s storage ring. He did not know what material it was made of, but it was extremely hard. It was covered with runes and arrays.</p><p>Lu Ming was interested in how well the Zhou family’s clan master had hidden it.</p><p>Lu Ming observed it carefully. Although the inscription array was advanced, Lu Ming was still able to discover its flaws and weaknesses very quickly.</p><p>“Dandan, come and break it!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not have any mental fire now and could only be called dandan.</p><p>“Simple, leave it to me!”</p><p>Dandan scuttled over and observed it for a moment. She waved her claws and runes entered the box.</p><p>The inscriptions on the box glowed, and after a while, the inscriptions on the box trembled and collapsed.</p><p>“If there are any treasures, give me a share!”</p><p>Dandan shouted, her eyes shining, and hurriedly opened the box.</p><p>After opening the box, dandan’s face sank and revealed a look of disappointment.</p><p>Because the items in the box were very simple. There were only two items, a small Jade box and a book. They were not some kind of treasure at all.</p><p>Without any natural treasures, dandan immediately lost interest and walked to the side to gnaw on spirit herbs with a bored face.</p><p>Lu Ming was somewhat interested. He picked up the book and opened it to read.</p><p>After a long while, Lu Ming revealed a look of surprise.</p><p>This book recorded a secret technique, the illusionary breath technique.</p><p>According to the records, one could change one’s aura into another aura by cultivating the illusionary aura technique.</p><p>This was completely different from the previous method of concealing one’s aura. Concealing one’s aura was just concealing one’s own aura so that others would not be able to detect it easily. However, the illusionary breath technique transformed one’s aura into another kind of aura.</p><p>This was simply an escape. A top secret art of disguise could sometimes save lives.</p><p>As long as he changed his aura and appearance, no one would be able to recognize him.</p><p>In the world of martial Dao, it was easy to change one’s appearance, but one’s aura could not be changed. Everyone’s aura was unique, so this kind of secret skill was very precious.</p><p>No wonder the Zhou clan’s clan head had such a good collection.</p><p>“If I had cultivated the illusionary breath technique, I wouldn’t have to be afraid of being recognized even if I met someone I knew!”</p><p>A smile appeared on Lu Ming’s face. He could not help but look at the jade box.</p><p>If it was placed together with the illusionary breath technique, then what was in the jade box?</p><p>Lu Ming opened the jade box expectantly. There was a Jade tablet in the box.</p><p>Lu Ming took a look and knew that it was a record Jade card.</p><p>He picked it up and scanned it with his mind. At first, Lu Ming was stunned. Then, he had a look of disbelief on his face.</p><p>“This … ‘This …’ There’s actually such a heaven-defying pill in this world?”</p><p>Lu Ming was tongue-tied and extremely shocked.</p><p>This Jade token contained a pill recipe, a heaven-defying pill’s refining method.</p><p>Nirvana pill. This was a pill formula called the Nirvana pill. However, the nature-defying function of this pill left Lu Ming dumbfounded.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
