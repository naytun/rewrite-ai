He had also failed. It seemed that no one had succeeded this time.</p><p>...</p><p>No, there was still one more person.</p><p>The crowd suddenly thought of something. Where was Lu Shaoqing, the young genius who killed the master of blood net and the experts from cold-blood Hall, Wu Cang, Xue Feng and the other fourth level spiritual God Realm experts, and Wu chengkong?</p><p>Why isn’t he here?</p><p>“Where’s Lu Shaoqing?”</p><p>The Supreme of cold-blood Hall and the heavenly martial Sword School scanned the surroundings with sharp eyes. They spread out their spiritual consciousness in search of Lu Ming.</p><p>Supreme martial artist, Lu Shaoqing is an expert in disguise. He can even change his aura. He must be in the crowd!</p><p>Xue Luo Zi shouted.</p><p>He had fought with Lu Shaoqing in the city of dan, so he was very familiar with Lu Shaoqing’s appearance and aura.</p><p>However, Lu Shaoqing’s appearance and aura in the secret realm of the Saint mansion were completely different. If he had not recognized Lu Ming’s devouring power, he would not have recognized Lu Ming.</p><p>Therefore, he knew that Lu Ming was definitely skilled in the art of disguise.</p><p>“Hmph, you think I can’t find you in a crowd? I’ll check them one by one!”</p><p>The Supreme martial artist of the heavenly martial sword faction released a terrifying aura. His spiritual sense was like a storm, enveloping Lu Ming and the others who had entered the secret realm of the Saint mansion. Many people’s faces changed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed slightly before returning to normal.</p><p>“Check them one by one, how are you going to check?”</p><p>A Supreme martial artist from another power said unhappily.</p><p>“I’ll search their souls one by one!”</p><p>The Supreme of blood Luo sect sneered.</p><p>“Haha, soul search? Who Do You Think You Are? How can my floating mountain sect’s disciples let you search their souls?”</p><p>The Supreme martial artist of the floating mountain sect laughed. His voice was ice-cold.</p><p>“That’s right, Who Do You Think You Are? How can I let you search the soul of a disciple of the sky Eagle Castle? if you want to capture Lu Shaoqing, you have to think of a way!”</p><p>The Supreme-being of the sky Eagle Castle sneered.</p><p>Some of the Supreme-beings from the Overlord forces looked coldly at the Supreme-being from cold-blood Hall and the Supreme-being from the heavenly martial Sword School. As they were all Overlord forces, they were not afraid of the two.</p><p>The heavenly martial sword faction and cold-blood Hall had suffered heavy losses because of Lu Shaoqing, and now they wanted to search their disciples ‘souls. Wasn’t that ridiculous?</p><p>The Supreme-beings of cold-blood Hall and Heavenly Sword School looked terrible.</p><p>the disciples of the Overlord forces can leave, but the other forces and itinerant cultivators have to stay. We’ll search their souls!</p><p>The Supreme martial artist from the heavenly martial sword faction muttered to himself for a moment before speaking.</p><p>“What? You want to search our souls? no, don’t be too overbearing!”</p><p>“I won’t agree to it!”</p><p>this is the Tianxia Academy, not the tianwu Sword School or cold-blood Hall!</p><p>Immediately, the people from the small forces started to shout.</p><p>Everyone had their own secrets. How could they let others search their souls?</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>The Supreme martial artist of the heavenly martial sword faction shouted as a vast sword power bloomed out, causing many people to be unable to breathe.</p><p>Overlord forces were tyrannical. Other than forces of the same level, other forces were like ants in their eyes.</p><p>In fact, this was the case. Once an Emperor appeared, no one could compete with him.</p><p>hu hu …</p><p>At this moment, clouds gathered in the sky. The endless clouds gathered to form a huge face, and an endless Imperial pressure spread out.</p><p>“The Emperor, the Emperor has appeared!”</p><p>Someone shouted, and many people’s faces changed.</p><p>“Greetings, Your Majesty!”</p><p>Everyone in the Tianxia Academy, be it ordinary disciples or Supreme martial artists, bowed respectfully.</p><p>This was because he was the Emperor of the Tianxia Academy.</p><p>The other people also saluted in a hurry. This was a sign of respect for the Emperor.</p><p>let them go. Since they are in the Tianxia Academy, the Tianxia Academy must ensure everyone’s safety!</p><p>The Emperor spoke indifferently, but his words were unquestionable.</p><p>“But …”</p><p>The Supreme martial artist from the heavenly martial sword faction wanted to say something.</p><p>“No need to say more, go!”</p><p>The king interrupted him.</p><p>The Supreme-beings of the heavenly martial Sword School and cold-blood Hall nodded. They had to respect the king’s request and finally agreed helplessly.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The Supreme martial artist from the sky martial sword faction glanced at the people from the small forces and the Rogue cultivators, then left with the people from the sky martial sword faction.</p><p>The Supreme of cold-blood Hall also left with his people.</p><p>After that, the people from the other Overlord forces also left.</p><p>With a whoosh, the giant face in the sky disappeared without a trace. The emperor’s aura also disappeared without a trace, as if it had never appeared.</p><p>However, the people from the small forces did not leave.</p><p>They planned to take the teleportation formation of the Tianxia Academy to leave because the tianwu sword sect and cold-blood Hall might intercept them outside the Tianxia Academy. It was too dangerous to go out like this.</p><p>The safest way was to leave through the teleportation array.</p><p>The Tianxia Academy had no reason to refuse, because taking the teleportation array would cost them a large amount of spiritual crystals and raw stones. They could make a lot of money.</p><p>Lu Ming was also in the crowd. He also planned to take the teleportation array and leave the Tianxia Academy.</p><p>In the air, Kong Xin and goddess Tan Xiang glanced around, presumably looking for Lu Ming. However, Lu Ming had no intention of showing himself.</p><p>He found a random mountain peak and sat cross-legged, quietly cultivating.</p><p>There were too many people now, and they would definitely have to line up at the teleportation array. It would be better to set off in a few days.</p><p>After the three of them left, Lu Ming made his move. After paying a sum of raw gemstones, Lu Ming stepped into the teleportation array.</p><p>sacred city, I’m here. Little Qing, how are you now? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>His destination was the sacred city of the central continent, the imperial capital of the ancient Saint dynasty, the largest city in the world.</p><p>The teleportation array flashed and Lu Ming’s figure disappeared.</p><p>The central continent’s sacred city was the largest city in the divine wilderness. It was the imperial capital of the ancient sacred dynasty. In the eight directions of the sacred city, there were eight satellite cities that surrounded and protected the sacred city.</p><p>These eight satellite cities all had teleportation formations. If outsiders wanted to enter the holy city, they could only teleport to the satellite city first, then fly to the holy city.</p><p>On this day, the teleportation array of a satellite city in the East flashed and Lu Ming appeared.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stay in the satellite city. He left the satellite city and soared into the sky, flying towards the sacred city.</p><p>The distance between the satellite city and the holy city was at least ten million miles. However, Lu Ming’s current speed was terrifying. He crossed the distance in no time and a huge city appeared in front of him.</p><p>The first impression Lu Ming had of the holy city was that it was ancient, weathered, and full of the traces of time.</p><p>The huge city wall was covered with sword marks, which seemed to describe the ancient history of the sacred city.</p><p>The central continent’s sacred city was huge and Grand. However, among all the big cities in the divine wilderness continent, it was definitely not the largest, nor was it considered the top. At the very least, the nine Dragons city of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace was much bigger than the sacred city.</p><p>However, the sacred city was still the number one city in the world.</p><p>The holy city had existed for far too long and had left behind countless legends. There were also countless secrets within.</p><p>Moreover, there were many entrances to secret realms in the holy city. In fact, those secret realms could be considered a part of the holy city. With those secret realms, the holy city’s scope was terrifyingly large.</p><p>No one knew how many powerful cultivators were hidden in those secret realms or how many secrets they contained. Therefore, although the ancient Saint dynasty of the central continent had declined, it was still the most powerful force in the central continent. No one dared to underestimate it.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
