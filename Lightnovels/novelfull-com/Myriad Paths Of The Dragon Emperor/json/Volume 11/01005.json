He actually used such methods to force Xiao Zhan and Lu Shaoqing to come out!</p><p>“He is indeed despicable. However, not all of the heaven’s pride experts of the floating mountain martial school are like this. Some heaven’s pride experts are very forthright. I heard that Chu Kuang, who is ranked second among the top ten heaven’s pride experts of the floating mountain martial school, is very forthright and forthright. He even married and made friends. I wonder if that’s true?”</p><p>“This is true!”</p><p>come to think of it, Ling yunkong was defeated by Lu Shaoqing the last time, and he still dares to return. Isn’t he afraid of being defeated by Lu Shaoqing again? ”</p><p>“That’s because he brought an expert with him. Do you see that young man who is sitting cross-legged on Ling yunkong’s right? That’s hai Ziming.”</p><p>“What? That’s hai Ziming, the fifth of the ten heaven’s favorites of the floating mountain sect?”</p><p>Countless people were talking about it from all directions. However, they kept their voices very low for fear that Ling yunkong would hear them. At the end of their conversation, most of their gazes fell on the young man on Ling yunkong’s right.</p><p>The young man was wearing a blue robe and had an ordinary appearance. He was the kind of person who wouldn’t be able to be found in a crowd. However, when everyone heard his name, no one dared to look down on him.</p><p>Because he was hai Ziming.</p><p>It was said that hai Ziming was the heaven’s favorite of the floating mountain sect who rose up the fastest. He was also the youngest and was not even 25 years old yet.</p><p>In the battle of Providence, he rose like a comet, shocking everyone. After the battle of Providence, he was ranked fifth among the ten heaven’s favorites of the floating mountain sect, much stronger than Ling yunkong.</p><p>He did not expect that Ling yunkong would actually invite hai Ziming over. It was obvious that he was here to deal with Lu Shaoqing.</p><p>continue to spread the news. If Lu Shaoqing and Xiao Zhan still don’t show up, I will kill a Xiao family disciple every two hours!</p><p>At this moment, Ling yunkong revealed a look of impatience as he coldly ordered an old man beside him.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The old man hurriedly nodded.</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>At this moment, hai Ziming opened his eyes. His eyes flashed and he spat out two words.</p><p>The old man’s expression immediately changed, and he stood still.</p><p>Ling yunkong frowned.</p><p>“Ling yunkong, I’m here with you to meet Lu Shaoqing. You’re too despicable!”</p><p>Hai Ziming said indifferently.</p><p>Ling yunkong frowned and a look of displeasure flashed across his eyes. He forced a smile and said, ” Junior Brother hai, Lu Shaoqing and the old man of the Xiao family are both in hiding. If we don’t use this method, how can they appear? ”</p><p>forget about killing them. Also, when they arrive, let these people go. They are all people with low cultivation. If we kill them, it will be bad for the reputation of our floating mountain!</p><p>Hai Ziming said.</p><p>“Alright, Junior Brother hai, I know what to do!”</p><p>Ling yunkong’s voice turned cold.</p><p>Hai Ziming frowned.</p><p>If it were not for the fact that Ling yunkong had helped him before he rose to power, he would never have followed Ling yunkong here to do such a thing.</p><p>“Ling yunkong, I’ve already helped you twice. This is the last time. After this, you and I don’t owe each other anything!”</p><p>Hai Ziming said indifferently.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Ling yunkong snorted but did not say anything.</p><p>After hai Ziming finished speaking, he closed his eyes again.</p><p>“Lu Shaoqing is here!”</p><p>At this moment, someone exclaimed.</p><p>“What? Where is he?”</p><p>“Over there!”</p><p>The gazes of the crowd turned to the sky in unison.</p><p>Ling yunkong’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Hai Ziming, who had his eyes closed, opened his eyes as well. Two bright spearlights shot out from his eyes.</p><p>A black-robed young man with his hands behind his back was flying in the northern sky. It was Lu Ming.</p><p>When Lu Ming arrived at Lishui City, he found out that Ling yunkong did not bring any spiritual God Realm powerhouse with him. He only invited a Young heaven’s favorite. Lu Ming did not hide and showed himself.</p><p>Thinking about it, how could a spiritual God Realm venerable be invited by Ling yunkong to do such a thing? he would probably be ridiculed by the world.</p><p>“Lu Shaoqing!”</p><p>Ling yunkong glared at Lu Ming, gritting his teeth as he spoke word by word.</p><p>“What’s wrong? You didn’t learn your lesson last time, and now you’re looking for a beating again?”</p><p>Lu Ming cast a glance at Ling yunkong and said disdainfully. This made Ling yunkong gnash his teeth in anger.</p><p>“Lu Shaoqing, where’s the old man and the two girls from the Xiao family?”</p><p>Ling yunkong asked coldly.</p><p>“You want to know? Why should I tell you?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and said, ” the heaven’s pride experts of the floating mountain martial school only know how to play such tricks. They used innocent people to lure me out. Now that I’m out, you can use whatever tricks you have.</p><p>“Hmph, if I didn’t do this, how would you have come out? Lu Shaoqing, aren’t you very strong? Today, I’ll let Junior Brother hai Ziming have a taste of your strength!”</p><p>Ling yunkong said.</p><p>“Oh? So it was a different person? However, I’m not interested in fighting with someone else. I’m more interested if you fight me yourself!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Ling yunkong’s expression turned even uglier. How would he dare to do it himself?</p><p>“Lu Shaoqing, it’s not up to you today!” Ling yunkong sneered.</p><p>“Lu Shaoqing, fight with me!”</p><p>Hai Ziming stood up, his eyes filled with a strong desire to fight.</p><p>“If you want to fight with me, sure. How about we make a bet?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“How do we bet?” Hai Ziming asked.</p><p>it’s simple. If I lose, I’ll destroy my cultivation and hand it over to you. I’ll also hand over senior Xiao Zhan, ah Luo, and ah Lei. But if you lose, you have to swear that you’ll never touch the Xiao family again, no matter what means.</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>why should I agree? you have no choice now. The lives of these Xiao family disciples are in my hands. You’d better listen to my orders!</p><p>Ling yunkong sneered and rejected him directly.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile.</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming took a step forward and used the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps to pounce on him.</p><p>In the process of pouncing, Lu Ming burst out with two streams of dragon energy.</p><p>Purple scales immediately appeared on Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>“Vanish!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and his muscles squirmed. The purple scale armor could not be seen but only covered his skin.</p><p>It made his body look like it was only suffused with a layer of purple radiance.</p><p>Lu Ming’s physical body had now reached complete rank-8 and was extremely powerful.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that when he released his dragon energy, he could control his body. He could make the scales hide under his skin instead of appearing on the surface.</p><p>In this way, the strange phenomenon would not be too obvious and would not be noticed by people with ill intentions.</p><p>Of course, this was related to the strength of his body and the explosive dragon power.</p><p>Given the strength of Lu Ming’s current physical body, he could only hide the phenomenon caused by four bursts of dragon energy at most. If he had more than four bursts of dragon energy, he would not be able to control his physical body and scales would appear.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
