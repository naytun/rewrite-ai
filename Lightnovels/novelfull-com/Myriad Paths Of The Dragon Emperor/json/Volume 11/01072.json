He was about to leave.</p><p>...</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Suddenly, a loud roar could be heard.</p><p>In the sky, a young man in white with a long sword on his back stepped through the air. A terrifying sword power emanated from his body, pressing down on everyone.</p><p>“Wu Cang!”</p><p>“Wu Cang of the heavenly martial Sword School!”</p><p>Many people’s expressions changed.</p><p>The heavenly martial sword sect was extremely prosperous. It was one of the top forces in the central continent, and few forces could compare to it.</p><p>In this generation, the heavenly martial Sword School also produced many heaven’s favorites. There were two second-grade heaven’s favorites.</p><p>Wu chengkong and Wu Cang.</p><p>Wu chengkong was the top talent of the tianwu sword sect, while Wu Cang was the second.</p><p>Don’t look at how he was ranked second. His strength wasn’t any weaker than Yin BUPO, Jun Yue, and the others.</p><p>With two heaven’s favorites in one generation, the heavenly martial sword sect’s reputation was like the sun in the sky.</p><p>“Get lost! I want this place!”</p><p>Wu Cang stood high above and looked down.</p><p>Many people gritted their teeth. This place was huge. Wu Cang could clearly choose a place to comprehend, but he wanted to chase others away.</p><p>However, he didn’t dare to voice his anger and could only leave.</p><p>Many people were just in the middle of comprehending and had no choice but to stop and leave.</p><p>“You’re still not leaving?”</p><p>Wu Cang looked at Lu Ming, his eyes sharp like lightning.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was calm. He glanced at Wu Cang and walked away.</p><p>This place was of no use to him. He had planned to leave anyway, so there was no need to fight with Wu Cang.</p><p>“The heavenly martial Sword School is really overbearing!”</p><p>keep it down. The heavenly Sword sect has sent many powerful cultivators here. The top cultivator of the previous generation is here too. He’s not as talented as Wu Cang and Wu chengkong, but he’s been cultivating for more than ten years. He’s very powerful. We’d better not offend him!</p><p>Some people discussed in low voices and left the place.</p><p>Lu Ming headed north and soon reappeared ten thousand miles away.</p><p>Gah!</p><p>A cry resounded through the sky as a Giant Eagle flew across the sky.</p><p>“What a powerful aura!”</p><p>This was also a terrifyingly powerful bird of prey, the Overlord of this secret realm.</p><p>The giant Eagle flew to a cliff in front of them and landed.</p><p>Lu Ming then realized that there was a nest on the cliff.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>From afar, Lu Ming noticed that there was a strange aura on the cliff. There were vague traces on it that seemed to be a human figure.</p><p>there are traces left behind by an omnipotent expert. I wonder if it’ll be of any use to me!</p><p>Lu Ming carefully approached the giant Eagle’s Nest and waited patiently.</p><p>This wait lasted for an entire day.</p><p>The next day, the giant Eagle let out a long cry, spread its wings, and flew away from its nest.</p><p>The giant Eagle was far away. Lu Ming rushed to the bottom of the cliff to take a closer look.</p><p>There was a figure carved on the cliff wall, and this figure seemed to be launching an attack.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>He took a closer look and saw that the figure seemed to be moving. A terrifying killing intent burst out and enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>With a loud shout, the figure’s palm struck towards Lu Ming. A terrifying killing intent enveloped Lu Ming. Lu Ming’s body turned cold, and he could not muster up any thoughts of resistance. The other party’s palm directly landed on his body.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He retreated backward, only to realize that everything was an illusion.</p><p>“Amazing!”</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a long sigh of relief. He was a little shocked but also a little excited.</p><p>This was a martial technique that was extremely powerful and contained killing intent. It could even affect one’s mind.</p><p>Lu Ming’s third Blood Meridian was able to make use of the powerful slaughter concept. This martial art technique was very useful to Lu Ming.</p><p>I’ll try to comprehend it here and see if I can comprehend this battle technique! zhang xuan said.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and took a closer look.</p><p>Lu Ming guarded his heart tightly and nothing moved.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>This time, it wasn’t a palm strike. A sword appeared in the figure’s hand and he slashed out.</p><p>Lu Ming did not move and let the sword cut through him.</p><p>Sure enough, the combat sword was like a Phantom. After a slash, it performed the next move. This time, it turned into a saber.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>This figure moved unhindered, displaying all sorts of attacks. The weapon in his hand was also unpredictable.</p><p>“What an amazing martial skill!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at it for a while and finally figured out something.</p><p>This kind of martial technique didn’t have a fixed form, or rather, the form was only on the surface. The main point was the ‘intent’. After understanding the intent of this martial technique, any weapon would be able to exert great power.</p><p>This was a killing style, specially created for killing people, and its power was extremely strong.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged in the air, comprehending and studying in detail.</p><p>In the evening, a screech resounded through the sky. The giant Eagle had returned. Lu Ming left the place and sat cross-legged not far away to continue his comprehension.</p><p>The next day, after the giant Eagle left, Lu Ming returned to the cliff to continue his comprehension.</p><p>“Brat, get lost!”</p><p>Suddenly, a loud roar interrupted Lu Ming’s comprehension.</p><p>There was a cold glint in Lu Ming’s eyes. He turned to look.</p><p>Wu Cang, this person again. Now, he had his eyes on this cliff.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly.</p><p>Wu Cang was stunned. He did not expect that Lu Ming would dare to tell him to scram.</p><p>Then, Wu Cang’s eyes were filled with killing intent. He stared at Lu Ming and said,”Kid, do you know who you’re talking to? If you say the wrong thing, you’ll have to pay with your life.”</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice turned colder as he said the second word.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>die! Wu Cang shouted coldly. His sword Qi surged and he slashed out his palm. A terrifying sword radiance slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming casually waved his hand and sent the sword gleam flying. He then stood up and walked toward Wu Cang.</p><p>“You have some ability, but you’re wrong to be arrogant in front of me!”</p><p>Wu Cang shouted as he unsheathed his sword.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The combat sword cut through the void, leaving a horrifying crack in the space.</p><p>Roar Roar Roar …</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar resounded from within Lu Ming’s body. His dragon power burst forth, and a purple light emanated from Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>With a palm strike, Wu Cang’s sword Qi was destroyed. Lu Ming did not stop and continued to move toward Wu Cang.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Wu Cang was shocked. He found it unbelievable. Lu Ming’s combat strength was far beyond his imagination.</p><p>Where did this expert come from?</p><p>Wu Cang didn’t have time to think. He quickly retreated, and a battle sword bloodline appeared above his head. It was a divine level eighth bloodline.</p><p>He performed the blood fusion and transformed into a combat sword. He slashed out a shocking sword radiance in an attempt to cut Lu Ming in half.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists and activated the prison suppressing heaven technique, striking the sword with a terrifying force.</p><p>The combat sword trembled crazily and almost fell apart, flying far away.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and threw a punch. The combat sword shook violently and was sent flying tens of thousands of meters away, cutting two mountains in half.</p><p>“Run, run!”</p><p>Wu Cang was terrified. He controlled his sword and turned to run.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped into the air and gave chase.</p><p>Wu Cang transformed into a sword beam and was extremely fast. He flew hundreds of miles in an instant. However, Lu Ming was even faster. He approached at an extreme speed and Wu Cang was almost scared out of his wits.</p><p>stop! I’m a disciple of the heavenly martial sword faction. If you dare to attack me again, you’ll be making an enemy out of the heavenly martial sword faction!</p><p>Wu Cang was afraid. He brought up the tianwu sword sect in hopes of subduing Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
