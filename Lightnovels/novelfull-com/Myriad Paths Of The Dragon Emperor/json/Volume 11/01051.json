Just like that, a year passed. In this one year, he had actually been comprehending the essence realm of heaven and earth and various martial arts techniques.</p><p>In that state, it was much faster to comprehend various concepts and martial arts techniques. In addition to Lu Ming’s current level of comprehension, his progress was naturally terrifying.</p><p>Unknowingly, his five kinds of intent realm had already broken through to the fourth level. Thus, when his third bloodline awakened and he broke through the Qi sealing Pagoda that suppressed him, his five kinds of intent realm began to improve rapidly and broke through to the fourth level. At the same time, he also began to break through to the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming could clearly sense that his five types of intents had all reached the peak of level four beginner. He was only one step away from level four lower tier.</p><p>Moreover, he had also cultivated the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps to the seventh step. Its power was equivalent to the highest level of a low-grade divine martial technique, and its power was amazing.</p><p>In the next moment, with a thought, the bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele emerged with six golden chakras.</p><p>After refining the Zhou clan’s blood essence, the prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline had also advanced by one level, reaching divine level level level 6.</p><p>my body, under the burning and tempering of the God-burning earthly flame, has also broken through and reached the ninth grade!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>in the future, I’ll have to be more careful. If I don’t trust people, I can’t easily expose a treasure like the mountain and river diagram!</p><p>This incident had taught Lu Ming a lesson.</p><p>One should not reveal one’s wealth, not to mention an important treasure like the mountain and river diagram. It was easy for others to be greedy. This time, if it were not for the Zhou family who wanted to force out his secret and force him to hand over the mountain and river diagram, he would have been dead.</p><p>If it wasn’t for the fact that he had just awakened his third bloodline, which was so powerful that he didn’t need to use his genuine Yuan, he wouldn’t have been able to escape.</p><p>He was lucky this time but Lu Ming did not want to have a second time.</p><p>“Haha, awesome!”</p><p>On the other side, dandan laughed loudly, lightning still flashing all over her body.</p><p>This fellow had absorbed a huge amount of tribulation lightning energy earlier, and he was still digesting it. What a freak!</p><p>The power of God tribulation lightning was something that even the bloodline of the nine Dragons couldn’t devour.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I didn’t misjudge you!”</p><p>Dandan flew over and laughed.</p><p>“I didn’t expect you to last a year!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Don’t you know who I am? My defense is unrivaled in the world. That guy refined me for a year, trying to refine me, but in the end, he didn’t even hurt a single hair of mine!”</p><p>Dandan said smugly.</p><p>“You have fur?”</p><p>Lu Ming was full of disdain.</p><p>pfft, it’s just a list. Your bloodline, on the other hand, is very shocking. Even I feel flustered when I look at it.</p><p>Dandan sized up Lu Ming.</p><p>“Can you tell what bloodline it is?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he asked.</p><p>I don’t know you. To be honest, I don’t even know your second bloodline. You’re a pervert. I don’t know you have two bloodlines. But your second bloodline looks familiar. I think I’ve seen it somewhere before!</p><p>She mumbled, but in the end, she still couldn’t remember anything.</p><p>“It’s as good as not saying anything!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at him in disdain. He then stood up and left in the air.</p><p>it’s been a year. I wonder what cultivation level those geniuses have reached? ”</p><p>Lu Ming yearned for it and left quickly.</p><p>Next, Lu Ming went to the savage Mountain to look for powerful demonic beasts to fight with. His main purpose was to test the power of his third bloodline.</p><p>As expected, every time Lu Ming activated his third Blood Meridian, there would be an endless surge of killing intent. Moreover, Lu Ming could sense the boundless sea of blood from that drop of blood and he could also borrow the power of the sea of blood.</p><p>However, with Lu Ming’s current cultivation, he could only borrow a trace of it. Moreover, every time he borrowed the power of the third bloodline, he was filled with killing intent, as if he wanted to kill all the living creatures in the world.</p><p>The killing intent was too shocking, and it seemed to contain boundless hatred.</p><p>“Why does he have such a strong killing intent and such a strong hatred? It’s said that any bloodline can be traced back to ancient, primordial, and immemorial creatures, divine weapons, and heaven and earth spirits. What kind of creature does this drop of blood belong to?”</p><p>Lu Ming was filled with doubts and his imagination ran wild.</p><p>As he moved forward, he cultivated and explored at the same time. Slowly, Lu Ming became more and more familiar with the use of the third bloodline. He could already maintain his calm mind and not be affected by the surging killing intent.</p><p>……</p><p>In ninedragons of the East continent, the divine Emperor, Dongfang Yu, stood respectfully in front of Martial Emperor Di Yi in a Palace. On both sides of the palace stood the family Masters of the six ancient families.</p><p>congratulations, Your Majesty. Young master di Shen has successfully broken through to the spiritual God Realm. If you see Lu Ming again, you will definitely be able to kill him easily!</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang clan congratulated him with a smile.</p><p>that’s right. With young master di Shen’s talent, once he becomes a spiritual God, he will be able to exert a terrifying power of the space mentality. It will be easy to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>The master of the Jiang family also took the opportunity to flatter him.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi nodded and said, ” Shen ‘er is indeed not bad. He is invincible in the East continent, but don’t underestimate the heroes of the world. The central continent has always been a place where geniuses are born in large numbers. In this era, there are many geniuses who are not weaker than Shen’ er. The top five young warriors are even more powerful. You can’t be complacent!</p><p>“Shen ‘er knows!”</p><p>The Emperor God bowed and said.</p><p>yes, I’ve received news that the Wanxiang Jade wall of the central continent’s Tianxia Academy will be open to the public. Heroes from all over the world can go and see it. You two can go to the central continent together and see the heroes of the world. You can also train yourself!</p><p>Said Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>Di Shen and Dong Fang Yu’s eyes lit up with anticipation.</p><p>The central continent had always been known as the center of the divine wilderness. How strong and prosperous was it, and how strong were its geniuses? They were looking forward to it.</p><p>The same thing was happening in the heavenly corpse sect and the sky demon Valley.</p><p>In a huge ancient tomb in the sky corpse sect, Blood Sword one and corpse warrior stood respectfully in front of the corpse Emperor.</p><p>now that the myriad form Jade wall of the Tianxia Academy in the central continent is open to the public, all of you can go to the central continent together and try your luck. According to my guess, the heaven’s favorites from the Northern Plains, Western Desert and Southern nether will also be heading to the central continent. The central continent will become a place where the wind and clouds will gather, you can go and experience it!</p><p>The corpse Emperor said.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Blood Sword one, corpse warrior bowed and said.</p><p>In the heavenly demon Valley, ao tu and Feng Xuan also stepped into the teleportation array to the central continent under the instructions of the demon Emperor.</p><p>……</p><p>Roar! Roar! Roar!</p><p>In a barbaric mountain range, a Black Panther with three heads roared and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>A brutal aura filled the forest. The three heads let out three loud roars. The clouds in the sky were scattered, and the mountain range rumbled.</p><p>Its three heads spewed out flames, lightning, and ice respectively. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>It was a ferocious beast in the second level of the spiritual God Realm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
