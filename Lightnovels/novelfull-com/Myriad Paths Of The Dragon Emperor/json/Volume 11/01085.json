If they continued to fight, the scene would become even more chaotic when more people appeared. Therefore, the four of them began to search for treasures on the shelves at the same time.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and a white light emanated. It enveloped the Jade bottles, Jade boxes, and metal boxes on the shelves. They were all stored into the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>He didn’t have time to see what it was, so he put it away first.</p><p>The four of them went on a frenzied raid, and in just a few breaths, the items on the shelves had been swept clean.</p><p>The unscrupulous monk, in particular, had actually forcefully kept a shelf into his storage ring, leaving everyone speechless. However, Lu Ming and the rest soon followed suit and kept the shelf.</p><p>At this moment, a few more figures rushed out of the corridor. They looked at the empty Hall on both sides and were stunned.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming and the rest had already rushed into the depths of the hall. There was a huge door there.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>The few experts behind them, including the Emperor God, rushed forward at the same time and followed closely behind Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>After rushing through the door, there was another Hall, but this one was bigger and empty.</p><p>Opposite the hall, there was another door, from which a faint light emanated.</p><p>Their eyes lit up and they quickly rushed in.</p><p>It was still a large hall, but this Hall was exceptionally wide. In the air above the hall, there were four balls of light, shining with a dazzling light.</p><p>Those were four weapons, floating in the air. They were of different colors, but they exuded a terrifying pressure.</p><p>“This is … An Emperor spiritual weapon!”</p><p>Yang potian growled and immediately rushed towards one of the treasures.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly lit up. The so-called Emperor spiritual weapon was the Emperor of spiritual weapons, just like the Martial Emperor of the martial artists, standing at the peak of many spiritual weapons.</p><p>The Emperor spiritual weapon was a top grade ninth level spiritual weapon. Even some emperors might not have one, as it had a domain that could assist them in battle.</p><p>Even emperors would be envious of this place, let alone them.</p><p>They immediately rushed toward one of the king spiritual weapons.</p><p>Lu Ming rushed towards a small fiery red Pagoda. The pagoda seemed to be cast from fire Jade and it emitted an astonishing amount of heat.</p><p>“An Emperor spiritual weapon!”</p><p>Behind them, the other experts had also arrived. When they saw the Emperor spiritual weapons, their eyes turned red with greed as they pounced on the four weapons.</p><p>One of them pounced on Lu Ming.</p><p>One of them was a brawny man in his forties with a cultivation of the fourth level of the spiritual God Realm. The other was an Emperor God.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was one step faster. His body was like a stream of light as he appeared in front of the small tower and reached out to grab it. However, just as Lu Ming was about to grab it, the small tower emitted a light circle. Lu Ming’s grab did not go in.</p><p>“Inscription formation!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. This small tower was protected by an inscription array. However, Lu Ming felt that he could break it if he spent some time.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming changed his claw to a palm and struck the circle of light.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The ring of light trembled, but it still blocked the attack.</p><p>At that moment, the Emperor God and the brawny man rushed over.</p><p>“The Emperor spiritual weapon is mine!”</p><p>The brawny man’s eyes were red as he charged at the small tower.</p><p>The Emperor God’s sword hit the ring of light, but it was still intact.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted coldly and swept his blood halberd at the burly man and the Emperor God at the same time. The two of them were shocked and tried to block it at the same time.</p><p>The blood halberd carried a terrifying killing intent that rolled like a tide and suppressed everything. It blasted toward the two of them. With a bang, their bodies shook violently and they were swept away by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming stared at the Emperor God and charged at him.</p><p>He planned to kill di Shen here. Di Shen was Di Yi’s most outstanding junior. If he killed di Shen, Di Yi would be heartbroken!</p><p>Hu!</p><p>The blood halberd pressed down and struck at the Emperor God’s head.</p><p>The Emperor God’s expression was extremely grave. The space around him trembled like water.</p><p>“Great space splitting slash!”</p><p>Lu Ming! the Emperor God said in a serious voice. He held the sword with both hands and slashed. The space rolled and a terrible crack was slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>This crack had the power to cut through space and could cut through anything.</p><p>Of course, this was relative. The blood halberd in Lu Ming’s hand transformed into the blood Sword again. The sword radiance flashed and the space was cut open, including the space crack.</p><p>This was the terrifying aspect of the five slaughter moves. No matter what weapon was used, it could display its power.</p><p>This was because the five slaughter forms were not moves, but focused on ‘intent’. Once the intent was there, any weapon could unleash its power.</p><p>The Emperor God’s expression changed drastically, and he retreated rapidly.</p><p>Kill!</p><p>Lu Ming’s blood-red hair flew in the air. His killing intent surged like a tide. He stepped forward and charged at the Emperor God.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Emperor God tried his best to resist, but he was no match for it. He spat out blood and retreated, his face pale.</p><p>Emperor God was indeed powerful. He had combined space mentality, sword mentality, and golden flame mentality. After his space mentality reached level four, it became even more mysterious and terrifying. He was even more powerful than Wu chengkong.</p><p>However, compared to Lu Ming, he was still a distance away. He was no match at all.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold as he approached the Emperor God.</p><p>The Emperor God had no choice but to use instant step, his figure flashing constantly.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming formed a seal with both hands and a sealing gate was formed. Di Shen’s expression changed drastically. He had seen Lu Ming use the sealing gate to seal Xue Feng and the others and then kill them.</p><p>“Spatial shift!”</p><p>The Emperor God roared and spat out a mouthful of blood. However, his body turned illusory. With a final bang, his body collapsed and turned into an illusion. His real body had long disappeared without a trace. No one knew where he had fled to.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the line of defense outside the hall. The Emperor God had passed through space and appeared in a Hall outside.</p><p>What a wonderful space concept!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes glinted coldly. He did not continue to pursue him. There were plenty of opportunities to kill the Emperor God.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>He turned around, and charged towards the brawny man. The brawny man was currently doing his best to break the small Pagoda’s formation.</p><p>Lu Ming charged back and struck out with his palm, causing the burly man to spit blood and fly back. He looked at Lu Ming with an extremely grave expression.</p><p>On the other side, an expert from each side rushed towards yang potian, the unscrupulous monk, and Tuoba Shi.</p><p>The experts who rushed towards the unscrupulous monk and Tuoba Shi were forced to retreat while spitting out blood. As for the experts who rushed towards yang potian, they were trapped by yang potian’s space mentality and killed in one fell swoop.</p><p>Yang potian was very unhappy today.</p><p>Originally, in the central continent, he was high and mighty. Other than the other four of the top five young warriors, no one was his match.</p><p>However, in this trip to the secret realm of the Saint mansion, Tuoba Shi had appeared first. His combat strength was not weaker than his, and he had fought with him several times.</p><p>Behind him, Lu Ming and the unscrupulous monk appeared one after another, displaying their shocking combat strength. They were not weaker than him. Moreover, he had never seen them before. This made him extremely unhappy and his heart was burning with anger.</p><p>Lu Ming took a glance and continued to crack the small Pagoda’s array.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
