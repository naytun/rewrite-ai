A long spear condensed in his hand and spun rapidly like a drill.</p><p>...</p><p>With a pfft, Lu Ming rushed into the ground. The long spear dug a hole in the ground. Lu Ming rushed in and at the same time, his essential core burst forth. The hole behind him collapsed and blocked the hole.</p><p>Lu Ming kept drilling into the ground. He only stopped after he had gone down about a hundred miles. With a thought, Lu Ming appeared in the mountain and river diagram. Deep underground, there was only one mountain and river diagram.</p><p>The moment Lu Ming entered the mountain and river diagram, he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Previously, he had been hit by the blood Lion twice in a row and had suffered quite a bit of injury.</p><p>the spiritual God Realm is really powerful. I’m not even a match for the most ordinary spiritual God Realm!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered secretly.</p><p>The bald man and the bearded man were definitely at the bottom of the spiritual God Realm. They were weak in all aspects, but Lu Ming was still not a match for them.</p><p>Previously, he had already unleashed his Strongest Battle prowess and used all of his techniques. Even so, he was still at a disadvantage when facing the bald man alone. Unless he used the prison suppressing heaven technique with all his might and unleashed his strongest attack, he would not be able to match the bald man.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s most powerful attack would exhaust his essential core with just one move. If it were not for the spatial elemental stone, he would not have dared to use it.</p><p>when I break through to the great circle of the spirit embryo realm, I won’t be afraid of the weakest spirit God. I can even suppress them!</p><p>Lu Ming summed up his own abilities.</p><p>Then, he circulated the true war Dragon technique and started to heal his injuries.</p><p>Just as Lu Ming entered the mountain and river diagram, the bald man and the bearded man appeared in the sky above the forest.</p><p>damn it! How did that kid’s aura disappear? ”</p><p>The bald man shouted angrily.</p><p>“He should be hiding. Let’s force him out!”</p><p>The bearded man’s eyes flickered with a cold light as he slammed his palm down.</p><p>A ten-mile-long blood-colored palm print covered the sky and smashed toward the ground.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The mountains exploded and the earth caved in. A ten-mile wide and ten-mile deep palm print appeared on the ground. Around the palm print were countless cracks that spread in all directions.</p><p>Countless demonic beasts were turned into ashes by this palm.</p><p>“Then force him out!”</p><p>The bald man waved his hands, and countless terrifying blood-red lights slashed toward the vast land.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Mountains exploded, ancient trees crumbled, and the earth sank. Countless living beings were turned into ashes under the attacks of the two. This place looked like it was the end of the world.</p><p>The destructive power of a spiritual God Realm master’s full-force attack was too shocking.</p><p>Not long after, the ground within a radius of a thousand miles was split open and pierced through.</p><p>All kinds of deep pits and cracks filled the area. The originally lively mountains and peaks had become deathly silent.</p><p>After more than ten minutes, the bald man and the bearded man stood in the air with ugly expressions.</p><p>There was no trace of Lu Ming. He could not sense any trace of Lu Ming either.</p><p>Lu Ming had escaped.</p><p>The two spiritual God powerhouses were supposed to be in the bag. Now that Lu Ming had escaped, they did not know how to answer to master blood Luo.</p><p>“Damn it, the next time I see him, I’ll skin him alive!”</p><p>The bald man gritted his teeth.</p><p>forget it, let’s go back. The ancient herb garden is more important. After spending so much time, it’s finally about to open!</p><p>The big bearded man said.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>The bald man nodded, and the two of them left.</p><p>A hundred miles underground, Lu Ming was healing his injuries in the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>A day later, Lu Ming’s injuries had fully recovered.</p><p>“Eh? The earth essence realm seems to have loosened!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p>After the previous battle, Lu Ming realized that the earth concept that had been stuck at a bottleneck had finally loosened up and there were signs of a breakthrough.</p><p>Lu Ming placed the path-understanding ancient tree at the side, closed his eyes, and focused on his comprehension.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, two days had passed.</p><p>Two days later, Lu Ming was surrounded by the five-colored concept. His aura was stronger than it was two days ago.</p><p>I’ve finally broken through to the great circle of level three earth concept!</p><p>Lu Ming opened his eyes and a faint smile appeared at the corners of his lips.</p><p>Now, his water concept was at the fourth level, while his wind, fire, Thunder, and earth concepts were at the third level, which was the great circle. Now that Lu Ming had unleashed all five of his concepts, the power was much stronger than it was a few days ago.</p><p>This was because the earth essence realm was only at the peak of level three upper tier.</p><p>if I were to face blood Luo Zi now, even if I don’t use the prison suppressing heavenly technique or my bloodline, I can still suppress him!</p><p>Lu Ming thought in his heart.</p><p>it’s been three days. Those two guys should have left by now. Let’s go out and take a look!</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming exited the mountain and river diagram and continued to condense the long spear. He dug through the ground and headed toward the surface.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming appeared on the ground silently. He was speechless as he looked at the desolate and desolate surroundings.</p><p>He knew very well that the bald man and the burly man must have wreaked havoc in the surroundings in order to find him.</p><p>looks like they’ve left. Hmph, master Xue Luo, I’ll have to settle this score with you sooner or later!</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes and he was about to head west.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s gaze shifted and he looked in the South direction.</p><p>In an unknown distance, a green pillar of light shot up into the sky.</p><p>“What’s that? Could it be that a treasure has appeared?”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly surprised.</p><p>“Spiritual herbs! I can sense the aura of countless spiritual herbs! Charge! Lu Ming, charge!”</p><p>Dandan appeared on Lu Ming’s shoulder, shouting and wrangling, her small eyes shining.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved and he headed in the direction of the light pillar.</p><p>At this moment, the light pillar could be seen within a radius of a hundred thousand miles.</p><p>the light pillar is soaring into the sky. There must be a treasure coming into being. Let’s go and take a look!</p><p>“Let’s go, this is my great opportunity!”</p><p>From all directions, everyone who saw the light pillar rushed towards it.</p><p>“Haha, this opportunity is mine!”</p><p>A red-haired elder with a soaring aura rushed toward the light pillar. He was a spiritual God Realm existence.</p><p>The treasure’s appearance attracted everyone’s attention.</p><p>Lu Ming soon approached the area where the light pillar was. It was a vast and endless mountain and forest.</p><p>“Eh, it’s actually here?”</p><p>Lu Ming stopped in the air, feeling a little surprised.</p><p>Lu Ming was very familiar with the forest in front of him. He had passed through this forest when he, Chu Kuang, and Zhang Wenjin were on their way to the heavenly pillar.</p><p>They also encountered a spiritual God Realm expert from cold-blood Hall who massacred an entire town to heal himself. Lu Ming and the other two even had a fierce battle with the spiritual God Realm expert.</p><p>Lu Ming was originally heading west. Previously, he had a huge battle with the bald man and the burly man. When he escaped, he chose a random direction. He did not expect to be near this place.</p><p>“Could it be that the injured spiritual God expert from cold-blood Hall was related to this light pillar? What ruins did cold-blood Hall find here?”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but let his imagination run wild.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
