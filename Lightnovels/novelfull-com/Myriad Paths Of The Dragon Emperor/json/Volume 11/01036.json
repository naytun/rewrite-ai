You don’t need to leave today!”</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold and filled with killing intent as he looked at the bald man.</p><p>It was a good time to settle the score from before.</p><p>“Brat, don’t think that you can kill me just because you have a breakthrough in your cultivation!”</p><p>The bald man’s face darkened.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to waste his breath on him. The nine Dragon bloodline emerged and Lu Ming immediately performed the bloodline fusion to transform into Nine Dragons. At the same time, the six streams of dragon energy in his body burst out.</p><p>A terrifying power surged in Lu Ming’s body. With the nine Dragons ‘step and the five-colored concept revolving around him, he clawed at the bald man with his nine claws.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>The Dragon Claw struck out, and the space was torn apart like a piece of paper, with cracks appearing.</p><p>“It’s that terrifying?”</p><p>The bald man was shocked.</p><p>To be able to tear space apart with a single claw, he had completely reached the level of a spiritual God.</p><p>The bald burly man retreated rapidly. The blood axe bloodline appeared above his head. He also used the bloodline fusion and turned into a blood axe. He hacked at the nine Dragons.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The blood-red battle-ax and the Dragon Claw collided, forming a terrifying energy storm that spread in all directions.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>A cold voice came out of Nine Dragons ‘mouth, and the blood-red axe was hit far away.</p><p>With one attack, the bald man was at a disadvantage.</p><p>“How can he be so strong?”</p><p>The bald burly man roared in disbelief.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The Dragon Claw stepped in the air, and the nine Dragons were like flowing light. They instantly rushed to the front of the blood-red battle axe and clawed again. At the same time, the nine Dragons roared, and a terrifying devouring power enveloped the blood-red battle axe.</p><p>As Lu Ming’s cultivation level increased and he entered the perfected spirit embryo realm, his essential core increased dramatically. As his essential core was rich and powerful, more essential core burst out with the prison suppressing heaven technique. The power of the prison suppressing heaven technique also increased sharply.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming’s casual move was comparable to the power of the prison destructive heaven technique when he was in the early stage of the ninth level spirit embryo realm.</p><p>If he were to break through to the spiritual God Realm and his true Yuan would become even more abundant, he would be able to use the destructive prison heaven technique at will. Only then would the power of the God tier martial skill be truly released, and it would be even more terrifying.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>Enveloped by the devouring power of the nine Dragons, the blood-red battleaxe trembled slightly, and the bald man’s frightened voice came out.</p><p>He could feel that his bloodline power was becoming unstable. After being enveloped by the devouring power, his strength was affected.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Dragon Claw grabbed the blood-red battle axe, causing it to shake violently.</p><p>After the first claw, it was followed by the second, the third …</p><p>One claw after another, it clawed at the bald man.</p><p>Lu Ming defended himself with the mountain and river diagram. He did not have to care about his own defense at all. He only attacked madly.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>In the sky, there were constant explosions and the blood-red battle axe kept shaking. The bald man was completely at a disadvantage.</p><p>“How can he be so strong? Is this still the spirit embryo realm?”</p><p>The bald man’s heart trembled, and fear appeared in his heart.</p><p>He was too powerful. As a spiritual God, he was actually suppressed by Lu Ming throughout the entire process.</p><p>“Go, I’ll retreat first!”</p><p>The bald man was afraid and had the intention to retreat.</p><p>“If you want to leave, stay here today!”</p><p>As if he had seen through the bald man’s thoughts, the nine Dragons ‘claw once again grabbed at the blood-red battleaxe.</p><p>The power of this claw was even more powerful and terrifying than the previous ones.</p><p>Lu Ming used all his strength in this claw, using the prison suppressing heaven technique.</p><p>The essential core in his body was also completely extracted. However, with Lu Ming’s current cultivation, the power of the prison suppressing heaven technique was much more terrifying than before.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The claw hit the battleaxe. The battleaxe shook and exploded. The bald man reappeared and was sent flying to the ground like a cannonball. Blood spurted out of his mouth.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The bald man heavily smashed into the ground, causing the earth to rumble violently. A powerful shock wave swept in all directions, and some mountains within a hundred miles were shattered, collapsed, and gravel flew everywhere.</p><p>The flowers, grass, and trees were all turned into ashes.</p><p>As for the bald man, he was lying on the ground with a huge pit that was dozens of miles deep.</p><p>At this moment, the bald burly man’s mouth was spurting out blood. His aura was weak and his eyes were filled with fear.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The nine Dragons took a step forward and rushed down. Their dragon claws tore at the bald man.</p><p>At that moment, essential core from the NA Yuan stone was flowing into Lu Ming’s body continuously. His essential core was full again.</p><p>However, the primeval essence stored in the NA Yuan stone had been completely used up.</p><p>After all, it was only the vital essence he had stored when he was in the early stage of the ninth level spirit embryo realm.</p><p>“No, don’t kill me!”</p><p>The bald burly man roared in fear. He wanted to resist but he was severely injured. How could he stop Lu Ming?</p><p>The claw radiance shattered all of the bald burly man’s defenses and tore him into pieces amidst his terrified screams.</p><p>“Swallow!”</p><p>The devouring power enveloped the bald man and devoured all of his blood essence, vital energy, and true essence.</p><p>The Qi, blood, and true Yuan of a spiritual God Realm master were too strong, and they surged in the bloodlines of the nine Dragons.</p><p>“Find a place to refine it!”</p><p>Lu Ming moved and left the place, flying into the distance.</p><p>Of course, he did not let go of the bald man’s storage ring either.</p><p>Tens of thousands of miles away, Lu Ming entered a secret place and entered the mountain and river diagram to begin the refinement.</p><p>His Qi, blood, and true essence were constantly being transformed into true essence. Lu Ming’s cultivation had improved again.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Finally, the nine Dragons roared and the seventh chakra emerged under the original six.</p><p>After devouring and refining a spiritual God Realm being, the nine Dragon bloodline had once again been upgraded to the seventh level divine rank bloodline.</p><p>With the upgrade of the bloodline of the nine Dragons, another dragon power was born at his spine.</p><p>There was a total of seven streams of dragon energy. If Lu Ming were to release all seven streams of dragon energy, his combat strength would undoubtedly increase.</p><p>it’s a pity that I can only release four dragon energies with my current physical body. If I release more, I won’t be able to control it and the scales will appear. This kind of phenomenon is special and I’m afraid it will be discovered by people!</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>Up until now, only two people had seen Lu Ming’s full power outburst and his prison-suppressing stele bloodline and nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>They were the bald man and the bearded man.</p><p>now the bald man is dead, and there’s still a bearded man. I hope he didn’t tell anyone!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons was too special. Since ancient times, no one had awakened it. If this news were to spread, it was very likely that the people of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace would discover it.</p><p>“It seems that I have to find an opportunity to kill that big bearded man!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>After a while, the bald man’s energy was completely refined.</p><p>Lu Ming took out the Nanyuan stone again.</p><p>Now that the energy storage stones were empty, he planned to continue to store some true essence.</p><p>With the yuan storing stones, he wouldn’t have so many scruples when he fought, and he could even burst out with his full strength from time to time.</p><p>This time, he was able to kill the bald burly man all thanks to the NA Yuan stone replenishing his true Yuan.</p><p>Holding the energy storing stone, he continuously poured his true essence into it.</p><p>When his essential core was exhausted, Lu Ming would devour the rough stones to recover.</p><p>Half a day later, Lu Ming stored several times in the NA Yuan stone, which was equivalent to several times of Lu Ming’s total essential core, before he stopped.</p><p>However, the consumption of raw gemstones was also terrifying. Tens of thousands of raw gemstones had been consumed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
