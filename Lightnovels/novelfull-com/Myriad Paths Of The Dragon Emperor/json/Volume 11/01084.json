This way, they had three more places.</p><p>In the end, the Emperor God sold the three spots. The unscrupulous monk smiled and made a huge profit, selling the three spots as well.</p><p>This way, excluding yang potian’s three spots, there were a total of thirty-three people who could enter.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the giant mountain was extremely bright. It formed a huge pillar of light that shot into the sky.</p><p>The beam of light hit the palace in the sky, giving off a deafening roar.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The palace slowly appeared. At first, it seemed real and illusionary, but it slowly became real.</p><p>After a few minutes, the palace had become completely real. It was filled with an ancient and vicissitude aura. It floated in the air like a huge city. It was extremely large and majestic.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Yang potian was the first to move. It was as if he was traveling through space. His body moved, and his figure appeared in front of the palace. Then, he stepped out and rushed in.</p><p>“Let’s go, we can’t let yang potian get there first!”</p><p>The other people who had a quota called out and rushed forward one after another, afraid that yang potian would beat them to it.</p><p>If there were treasures in the Saint mansion, the first one to enter would naturally get some benefits.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>Dozens of figures, all shrouded in a circle of light, rushed towards the palace.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were among them.</p><p>In front of the palace, there was a door that was half open. Yang potian was about to rush in.</p><p>Charge!</p><p>The rest of the people also rushed over.</p><p>Nothing happened. Dozens of people rushed into the gate one after another.</p><p>The others who didn’t have a spot looked at each other.</p><p>I don’t think there’s anything wrong with it. We don’t need the token to enter. The token was spread by Tianxia Academy, so it might not be true!</p><p>Someone said, his eyes burning with passion.</p><p>that’s right. I don’t think anyone from Tianxia Academy has ever entered it. It’s probably not true!</p><p>Some others agreed.</p><p>“Charge! I don’t believe it!”</p><p>Someone couldn’t hold it in anymore and rushed into the palace.</p><p>However, as he was flying, he suddenly let out a blood-curdling screech, and his entire body exploded just like that, turning into ashes.</p><p>The others were dumbfounded.</p><p>Gulu!</p><p>Those who had said that they didn’t believe what Tianxia Academy had said all took a deep breath and swallowed their saliva. Their faces were pale.</p><p>If they had acted rashly just now and charged forward first, they would have been the ones to die.</p><p>……</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming and the rest rushed in, they realized that they were in a huge corridor. It was very long and extended all the way to the front.</p><p>“What a strong pressure!”</p><p>As soon as they entered, everyone landed on the ground because of the powerful pressure. It was a no-fly zone, and their flight was stopped.</p><p>Moreover, not only could they not fly, but the pressure on their bodies was also extremely great, causing their speed to slow down by more than a hundred times.</p><p>“This is gravity!”</p><p>Lu Ming sensed it carefully and realized that it was gravity. The gravity was a hundred times stronger than outside.</p><p>Everyone circulated their true Yuan and stepped forward.</p><p>However, the gravity was too strong. Their speed was similar to that of an ordinary person’s running. Compared to their original speed, it was a huge difference.</p><p>And this corridor seemed to be no less than a hundred miles.</p><p>But since he had entered this place, he could only bravely move forward.</p><p>Gradually, the distance between them widened.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Yang potian walked at the forefront. His body was glowing as he strode forward.</p><p>Then, Tuoba Shi’s muscles bulged and he strode forward like a savage beast.</p><p>In addition, Lu Ming’s speed was also extremely fast, second only to Tuoba Shi. As for the unscrupulous monk, his body was covered in golden light as he walked beside Lu Ming.</p><p>The two of them had come in a little later, so they were slightly behind yang potian and his companion.</p><p>Behind them were a few burly men. They were the strongest geniuses of the previous generation in their respective forces, and their cultivation had reached the fourth level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Surprisingly, the Emperor God was also walking beside these people. He had the will of space, so he was under less pressure.</p><p>As for second-grade heaven’s favorites like fairy Tan Xiang and Kong Xin, they were slightly behind.</p><p>Everyone pushed forward with all their might. Slowly, they got used to the gravity here, and their speed became faster and faster.</p><p>This journey took two days.</p><p>Yang potian was the first to walk out of the corridor and rush out.</p><p>“Stop right there!”</p><p>Tuoba Shi hollered and followed closely behind yang potian. Following that, Lu Ming and the unscrupulous monk also stepped out and walked out of the corridor.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>As soon as they walked out of the corridor, they heard a violent roar. In front of the corridor was a large hall, where Tuoba Shi and yang potian were engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>The heaven scorcher halberd and the wolf Fang club continued to exchange blows, and the deafening rumbles were deafening.</p><p>On both sides of the hall, there were rows of shelves. On the shelves, there were some Jade bottles, Jade boxes, and boxes. It was obvious that the two of them were fighting for these items.</p><p>This was the legendary Saint mansion that surpassed the Emperor level. How precious would the things inside be?</p><p>Without a second thought, Lu Ming and the heartless monk’s eyes lit up and they rushed to the shelves on both sides.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Yang potian and Tuoba Shi roared as they charged at the two of them.</p><p>Tuoba Shi attacked the heartless monk. He waved his Mace and crushed the void like a mountain range.</p><p>“My hair is white, my Buddha is merciful!”</p><p>The heartless monk chanted the name of Buddha and his entire body emitted golden light. His appearance was solemn like the reincarnation of Buddha. He struck out a Golden Palm print and clashed with the wolf Fang club. With a boom, it actually blocked Tuoba Shi’s attack. The two of them began a great battle.</p><p>On the other side, yang potian was charging toward Lu Ming.</p><p>As the heavenly halberd slashed down, the space around it shattered. It even turned into spatial power that wrapped around the heavenly halberd, making it even more destructive.</p><p>Lu Ming’s five-colored will surrounded him and he had seven streams of dragon energy on him. His blood-red hair fluttered in the wind. The combat sword formed by his third bloodline changed and actually turned into a blood-red combat halberd.</p><p>The third bloodline was a drop of blood. It could change at will, be it a sword, a spear, a saber, a halberd, etc. It could change at will without a fixed shape.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming wielded the blood halberd and slashed down, clashing with yang potian’s heavenly halberd.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>A terrifying tremor spread out, and the two figures swayed slightly. Then, they began to fight again.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In the main hall, the four of them engaged in a peak battle. For a moment, it was difficult to determine who was superior.</p><p>peak of the second level of the spiritual God Realm!</p><p>Lu Ming discovered that yang potian’s cultivation was at the peak of the second level of the spiritual God Realm, not much higher than his. However, his combat strength was extremely terrifying.</p><p>He was the strongest young expert that Lu Ming had ever encountered.</p><p>The four of them were in a chaotic battle in the hall, and in the blink of an eye, they exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>Not far away, footsteps could be heard. It was obvious that the others were approaching.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
