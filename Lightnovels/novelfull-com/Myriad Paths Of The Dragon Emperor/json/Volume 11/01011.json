After a while, he said, ” “Stand up for them? How was that possible? For someone like Ling yunkong, if I were to see him using the name of the floating mountain martial school to commit crimes, I would immediately behead him with a single blade!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered but he did not say anything.</p><p>He had heard of the name Chu Kuang before. Chu Kuang was ranked second among the ten heaven’s pride experts of the floating mountain martial school. He was incomparably powerful and had unparalleled talent.</p><p>At the same time, this person was wild and unruly, and liked to make friends.</p><p>From the looks of it, he was indeed not someone like Ling yunkong.</p><p>I was just passing by today. I didn’t expect to encounter such an interesting thing. I like to find experts to spar with. Lu Shaoqing, fight with me. I’ll use this pristine water lotus as a bet. If you win, you can take the pristine water lotus. If I win, the pristine water lotus will belong to me. How about it? ”</p><p>Chu Kuang said as he looked at Lu Ming. He still did not look at old monster Blackwater.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and agreed without hesitation.</p><p>Chu Kuang was clearly a warmonger. Lu Ming knew that it was useless to avoid a fight against such a person. It would be better to fight him. As long as his combat strength was stronger than his opponent, his opponent would naturally be convinced.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming and Chu Kuang’s auras exploded as they faced each other from a distance.</p><p>the early stage of the ninth level spirit embryo realm is indeed powerful!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. Chu Kuang’s cultivation had already reached the early stage of the ninth level spirit embryo realm, which was even higher than the Emperor God’s in the battle of Providence. Of course, a high cultivation did not mean that his combat strength was stronger than the Emperor God’s.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Old monster Blackwater was sandwiched between the two, and his face turned ugly. These two were going to fight, and he was completely ignored.</p><p>He gritted his teeth and rushed to the side, trying to escape.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming and Chu Kuang both moved and attacked old monster Blackwater.</p><p>The terrifying Qi enveloped old monster Blackwater, and his face turned pale.</p><p>Old monster Blackwater used all his strength to attack, but the Qi from Lu Ming and Chu Kuang kept falling on his body, causing him to shake violently.</p><p>Lu Ming and Chu Kuang were crossing swords with old monster Blackwater.</p><p>No matter how powerful black water was, having awakened a third level divine level bloodline and cultivated for thousands of years, he was still in a miserable state in the battle between Lu Ming and Chu Kuang. He could not charge forward at all. Instead, he was sent flying here and there, blood spurting from his mouth.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s fists continued to bombard the air, and streams of fist radiance shot forward like meteors. Chu Kuang’s palms continued to swing out, and streams of bone-chilling saber radiance burst out.</p><p>The pitiful old monster Blackwater was stuck in the middle, desperately trying to resist. It was a tragic sight.</p><p>The surrounding onlookers looked at each other and couldn’t help but sympathize with old monster Blackwater.</p><p>“Argh, I don’t want the purified water lotus anymore. I will give it to you!”</p><p>Old monster Blackwater took out the cleansing Water lotus throne and threw it into the distance.</p><p>Lu Ming and Chu Kuang deliberately avoided the pristine water lotus Thrones. Old monster Blackwater also took the opportunity to break out of the encirclement and escaped far away. He looked at the scene with lingering fear.</p><p>haha, with one less hinderance, it’s just nice to fight with all my strength!</p><p>Chu Kuang laughed as he unsheathed the saber on his back. An even more terrifying and cold saber radiance burst out.</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with fighting spirit. He strode forward and slowly increased the power of the prison-suppressing heaven technique as he fought Chu Kuang.</p><p>As for the pristine water lotus throne, no one dared to touch it.</p><p>Everyone knew that if anyone dared to take this opportunity to seize the pristine water lotus throne, they would immediately end up like old monster Heishui. They were not sure if they could survive the battle between the two heaven’s pride level experts.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two of them had exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>Chu Kuang was very strong. His cultivation was at the early stage of the ninth level spirit embryo realm, and the bloodline he had awakened was definitely not weak. It was very likely to be a seventh level divine level bloodline.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that Chu Kuang was a heaven’s pride expert on the same level as Xue Jianyi and ao tu. If they were to fight at the same level, Chu Kuang would not be weaker than Xue Jianyi, ao tu, and the others. His combat strength was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>Chu Kuang’s saber slashed out, and a terrifying Saber Light flashed. A white ice crystal appeared in the air, and the layer of ice on the Black Lake became thicker and thicker.</p><p>he has actually cultivated the ice concept to such a level. No, there is also the water concept!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>It was obvious that Chu Kuang had merged the ice and water concepts together, and the power had increased by several times.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar resounded as two more streams of dragon energy burst out from Lu Ming’s body. With the Dragon’s Roar, Lu Ming’s strength increased greatly. He took a step forward and his fist radiance shook the sky.</p><p>The fist radiance shattered Chu Kuang’s blade light, filling the sky with ice shards.</p><p>Chu Kuang’s eyes revealed a serious look. Above his head, an Ice River actually appeared.</p><p>On the ice River, seven Meridian cycles shone. He had indeed awakened a seventh level divine level bloodline.</p><p>As soon as the ice River appeared, the air became even colder. Hundreds of miles around them were covered in the cold air. Many people retreated. If they were covered by the ice, even their Zhen Yuan would be frozen.</p><p>However, Chu Kuang’s bloodline appeared, but he did not merge his bloodline. Instead, with a flash of his eyes, his bloodline re-entered his body. He retreated quickly and dodged Lu Ming’s fist radiance. He shouted, stop, stop, I’m not fighting anymore, I’m not fighting anymore. I’ve lost this battle!</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned and stopped.</p><p>The crowd was also stunned. Chu Kuang had clearly not used his full strength yet. Why did he stop and admit defeat?</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile.</p><p>Chu Kuang was a very straightforward person. He probably felt that even if he fused with the bloodline, he wouldn’t be confident, so he simply admitted defeat.</p><p>Lu Shaoqing, I’m impressed, I’m impressed. This pristine water lotus throne is yours!</p><p>Chu Kuang sheathed his saber and grinned.</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out his hand and sucked the cleansing Water lotus throne into his palm, storing it in his storage ring.</p><p>Many people had envious looks on their faces, especially the older generation who were stuck at the perfected spirit embryo realm. They were even more envious. However, they did not dare to make a move against an expert like Lu Ming.</p><p>“Many thanks!”</p><p>Lu Ming put away the pristine water lotus throne. He was in a good mood and cupped his fists at Chu Kuang.</p><p>“Haha, no need to be so polite. I was no match for you. Of course, this Cleansing Water lotus throne is yours. Lu Shaoqing, it’s a pity that I didn’t see you in the battle of Providence. If you think highly of me, how about we be friends? I’ll treat you to a drink!”</p><p>Chu Kuang laughed. He was very forthright.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded in his heart. This Chu Kuang was indeed as the rumors said. He was bold and uninhibited and liked to make friends. He was not someone that Ling yunkong could compare to.</p><p>since brother Chu has invited me, I naturally have to give him face. Unfortunately, I need to find a place to cultivate in seclusion for a while. I’m afraid we can’t have a drink together!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Chu Kuang nodded and said, ” I understand. How about this? I’ll be in the sunset Moon City for the time being. If brother Lu ends his seclusion in 10 days, you can come to the sunset Moon City to find me. There’s going to be a grand event soon. I’ll go and take a look with brother Lu!</p><p>After saying this much, Chu Kuang turned around and stepped into the air.</p><p>Looking at Chu Kuang’s back, Lu Ming was reminded of Yan kuangtu.</p><p>Their personalities were very similar, both bold and uninhibited.</p><p>However, Yan kuangtu was even more arrogant, unruly, and audacious than Chu Kuang. He was more arrogant than Chu Kuang and didn’t give face to anyone. In comparison, he had fewer friends.</p><p>After Chu Kuang left, Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he soared into the sky, leaving the place as well.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
