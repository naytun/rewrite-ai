Only the upper echelons of the Overlord forces could see it.</p><p>...</p><p>The combat strength of these heaven’s favorites were all spread out. Few people had seen it with their own eyes. Now, they finally had a chance.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming took one step at a time in the air. With each step, Ling yunkong’s aura grew stronger.</p><p>In the end, the aura on his body was as powerful as the archaic divine mountains. The immense pressure pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Xiao Zhan and the Xiao sisters couldn’t help but retreat, their eyes filled with horror.</p><p>In front of Ling yunkong, they felt as though they were nothing more than ants. It was impossible for them to resist him.</p><p>“Big brother Lu!”</p><p>The Xiao sisters looked at Lu Ming, extremely worried.</p><p>Ling yunkong was so powerful. Could Lu Ming be his match?</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s figure was as steady as a rock. He did not move at all, not even the corner of his clothes moved.</p><p>Ling yunkong’s eyes revealed a trace of surprise.</p><p>A person who could stand still in the face of his aura was not simple.</p><p>“You’re not bad. You’re worth my time. What’s your name?”</p><p>Ling yunkong’s words surprised many people.</p><p>Ling yunkong actually said that Lu Ming was worth his time. Was the young man who was standing there without moving so strong? Worthy of Ling yunkong’s attention?</p><p>“You are not qualified to know my name!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was not loud, but it was like a storm that spread throughout the entire scene, causing everyone’s eyes to widen.</p><p>Lu Ming actually said that Ling yunkong was not qualified to know his name?</p><p>Crazy, too crazy, crazy to the point of no end.</p><p>What kind of person was Ling yunkong? He was one of the top ten heaven’s pride experts of the Overlord force, the floating mountain sect. Although he was only ranked tenth, the number of disciples of the floating mountain sect was more than ten million. There were countless geniuses and experts. To be able to stand out among the countless geniuses and be ranked tenth, it was enough to show how terrifying Ling Yun was.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was saying that Ling yunkong was not even qualified to know his name?</p><p>he’s too arrogant. I’m afraid that this young man came from the deep mountains and has not seen the world. He actually doesn’t know the immensity of heaven and earth!</p><p>in my opinion, he’s just a frog at the bottom of the well. He thinks he has some ability and doesn’t put the world’s heroes in his eyes. Just watch, he’ll be miserable later!</p><p>I think I’ve heard his name before. It’s from the Xiao family. I think he’s called Lu Shaoqing!</p><p>Lu Shaoqing? I’ve never heard of him before. The battle of Providence has just ended, and all the powerful elites are famous. I’ve never heard of this name before. Did he not participate in the battle of Providence? ”</p><p>“You see, I was right. This person must be a country bumpkin who just came out of some deep mountain!”</p><p>There was a lot of discussion near the Xiao family.</p><p>Xiao Zhan, a ‘ke and a’ Lei were also trembling with fear. Lu Ming’s words had infuriated Ling yunkong even more.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>As expected, Ling Yun laughed in his anxiety. His eyes were cold as he said, arrogant, you are really arrogant. I, Ling yunkong, have been called arrogant by others, but you are even more arrogant than me. However, you need to have the right to be arrogant. Later on, I will make sure that you can’t be arrogant at all!</p><p>you’re right. You have to have the capital to be arrogant, or you’re just looking for death!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>It was obvious that Lu Ming was referring to Ling yunkong.</p><p>“Then I’ll let you see what I have!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, Ling Yun took a step forward and waved his palm. A blue, crystal-clear blade light slashed towards Lu Ming. The terrifying aura seemed to be able to split the entire heaven and earth.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. He shook his long spear and a Dragon’s Roar was heard. A Spear’s gleam burst out and collided with the saber’s gleam.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A powerful Qi burst out and the space shook. The spear and blade light both disappeared.</p><p>Ling yunkong did not move. Lu Ming did not move either.</p><p>he blocked it. That Lu Shaoqing actually blocked Ling yunkong’s blade. Unbelievable!</p><p>“How could this be? This person actually has such powerful combat strength?”</p><p>Some people called out in disbelief.</p><p>Peak of the seventh level spirit embryo realm!</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>He already knew that Ling yunkong’s cultivation had reached the peak of the seventh level spirit embryo realm.</p><p>Half a year ago, during the war of Providence in the eastern barren territory, there would have been cultivators at the level of demonic Lord Luo Tian.</p><p>However, Lu Ming felt that Ling yunkong’s combat strength should not be as strong as Luo Tian’s. His talent should be slightly weaker than Luo Tian’s.</p><p>It had been half a year since the battle of Providence, and Ling yunkong had only reached the peak of the seventh level of the spirit embryo realm. Just from this point, he was inferior to Luo Tian.</p><p>After all, Luo Tian was ranked tenth among all the human talents in the eastern barren territory.</p><p>“Not bad. If you can take one of my attacks, then try taking another!”</p><p>“Hundred waves saber art!”</p><p>The aura on Ling yunkong’s body became even more vigorous. The blade light broke through the air, and the sound of stormy waves actually rang out in the air.</p><p>Ling yunkong’s blade gleams were like ocean waves, wave after wave, slashing towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s spear trembled. The long spear that was condensed from vital essence expanded rapidly, like a pillar that held up the sky. Five-colored rays of light curled around it.</p><p>Yes, five colors, five intents.</p><p>Earlier on, Lu Ming had devoured Ling Kai and the others ‘water concept and had been refining it. At this moment, Lu Ming’s water concept had a breakthrough and reached the lower tier of level three.</p><p>Although it wasn’t on the same level as the earth mentality, wind, fire, and Thunder mentality, the power of the five mentalities together was still very shocking.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>the massive spear pressed down with an overbearing momentum, obliterating everything in its path.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The heavens and the earth trembled continuously as Ling yunkong’s blade-light was crushed and shattered. In the end, the long spear did not stop and continued to smash towards Ling yunkong.</p><p>“Why would I?”</p><p>Ling yunkong’s pupils contracted rapidly. His eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>How could Lu Ming be so powerful? He broke his hundred waves saber art in one move and still had the remaining energy to smash at him?</p><p>All the spectators in the surroundings also widened their eyes in disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming’s spear was too amazing. It was unimaginably powerful. It actually started to suppress Ling yunkong, one of the ten proud Children of Heaven of the floating mountain sect.</p><p>Ling yunkong let out a long howl. His long hair fluttered in the wind as he continuously slashed out with the saber in his hand.</p><p>Within a short period of time, he had slashed at least a few thousand times before he managed to block Lu Ming’s long spear. However, he was forced to retreat a thousand meters, his chest heaving up and down.</p><p>“Just this bit of strength? And here I was thinking how strong he would be. It’s a miracle that you’re still alive!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>Ling yunkong’s face turned red with anger.</p><p>He was very arrogant just now and even said that one had to have the right to be arrogant. The facts had proven that he did not have the right to be arrogant in front of Lu Ming. His words were like slapping his own face.</p><p>This made him furious and furious. He wished he could kill Lu Ming.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Ling yunkong roared. At the same time, a giant elephant appeared above his head.</p><p>There were five golden chakras around the giant elephant.</p><p>As expected, a fifth-level divine bloodline was weaker than Luo Tian’s.</p><p>However, it made sense after some thought. The floating mountain sect was only on the same level as the Empyrean God Palace or the heavenly corpse sect. Ling yunkong was only ranked tenth in the floating mountain sect. If even the tenth place was as powerful as Luo Tian, wouldn’t the floating mountain sect be as powerful as the entire human race of the East barren?</p><p>This was clearly impossible.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
