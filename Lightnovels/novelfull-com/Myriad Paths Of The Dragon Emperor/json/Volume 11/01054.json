Some time ago, a heaven’s favorite from Northern Plains entered central continent and challenged one of the top five young warriors, yang potian. That battle could be said to be a peak battle, but in the end, it ended in a draw.</p><p>...</p><p>I’ve also heard about that battle, it was truly shocking, to think that Northern Plains would have a heaven’s favorite at the level of the top five young warriors!</p><p>not only Northern Plains, in this period of time, Western Desert has sent young Saint monks into central continent, displaying their unparalleled battle strength. There is also a terrifying Dark Child from Southern nether, according to reliable sources, Western Desert and Southern nether both have geniuses that are not weaker than the top five young warriors.</p><p>Upon hearing this, Lu Ming raised his eyebrows and was secretly shocked.</p><p>Who would have thought that Southern nether, Northern Plains, and Western Desert would all have heaven’s favorites at the level of the top five young warriors. The future was bound to be even more intense and brilliant.</p><p>“What about the East continent? Are there any powerful heaven’s favorites in the East continent?”</p><p>not the East barren. The reason why it has the word ‘barren’ is that it is a Savage Land. Since ancient times, it has been the weakest of the five territories. How can there be any geniuses? ”</p><p>that’s true. I heard that there are only two people in the East continent who are good. One is called Lu Ming, and the other is called di Shen. They should be second-grade geniuses. The others are not good. They are just clowns who are not worth mentioning.</p><p>that’s true. I heard that there was a great war in the east continent and Lu Ming was trapped. I guess he’s in trouble. Now, there’s only one emperor God left who can be used!</p><p>haha, what’s there to talk about in a Savage Land? let’s drink!</p><p>A burst of laughter came from the surroundings. When they talked about the eastern barren territory, their words were full of contempt.</p><p>“Hmph, a bunch of popinjays dare to talk about the world’s heroes?”</p><p>Hmph! at this time, a cold snort sounded and spread throughout the restaurant.</p><p>Everyone’s gazes turned to a corner of the restaurant.</p><p>There were two figures there, a man and a woman. The man was extremely burly and majestic, more than two meters tall, with bulging muscles.</p><p>The woman’s figure was graceful and beautiful. Her face was unparalleled, and she was devastatingly beautiful.</p><p>“Ao tu, Feng Xuan!”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. He recognized the two of them. They were the two most powerful heaven’s favorites of the heavenly demon Valley in the East barren.</p><p>“Oh? So, you’re considered a hero?”</p><p>The people they had been talking about were three young men with swords on their backs. They were all dressed in white swordsman robes and were obviously from the same force.</p><p>At this moment, one of the young men with a sword on his back looked at ao tu with a cold smile.</p><p>“I don’t know if I’m a hero or not, but I can easily suppress you!”</p><p>Ao tu laughed coldly. He was extremely confident.</p><p>In the eastern barren territory, he was second only to Lu Ming and the Emperor and deities. He was at the top and few people could defeat him. Naturally, he was confident.</p><p>Even when he came to the central continent, he was still confident that he would not be weaker than others.</p><p>“Suppress me with a single palm? Hahaha, I’ve never seen you before. Are you from the East continent?”</p><p>The young man asked.</p><p>“That’s right, ao tu from the East barren!” Ao tu said.</p><p>trash from the East continent! You’re just a bug, and you dare to say that you can defeat me? you’re really a Big Shot!</p><p>The young man with the sword on his back shouted coldly.</p><p>“What did you just say?”</p><p>Ao tu rose to his feet in a fit of rage, and a cold killing intent shot out from his eyes. A violent aura burst forth, and the entire restaurant was enveloped by a terrifying pressure.</p><p>The sword-carrying youth actually dared to call him a reptile, which made him want to kill him.</p><p>The young man sneered. He pointed his finger forward like a sword and cut through ao tu’s aura.</p><p>“Let’s go out and fight. I’ll let you know if you’re trash or not.”</p><p>The young man with the sword on his back stepped out and flew into the sky.</p><p>Ao tu also stepped out.</p><p>haha, that insect from the East continent, how dare he fight with senior brother song. He really doesn’t know what’s good for him. Let’s go out and take a look!</p><p>The other two young men laughed and followed.</p><p>Then, Feng Xuan also followed him out.</p><p>that’s the heaven’s martial sword sect’s Supreme talent. That guy just now seems to be Song Fei, the third-ranked Supreme talent of the heaven’s martial sword sect. That flood Dragon from the East continent is going to fight song Fei. Interesting, let’s go and see!</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Everyone flew out of the restaurant and stood in the air to watch.</p><p>Lu Ming followed the crowd and flew out of the restaurant.</p><p>In the sky, ao tu and Song Fei were confronting each other. The powerful aura they released attracted many people.</p><p>that’s a flood Dragon from the East continent. Do you think he can win? ”</p><p>that’s impossible! Song Fei is the third heaven’s favorite of the heavenly Sword faction. He is extremely powerful. That Dragon is no match for him!</p><p>Many people were discussing.</p><p>There were 18 Overlord forces in the central continent. Of course, there were also strong and weak Overlord forces.</p><p>The heavenly martial Sword School was one of the top forces in the central continent. It was stronger than the floating mountain, cold-blood Hall, and Sky Eagle Fort. It had many experts and geniuses. As the third heaven’s pride of the heavenly martial Sword School, it was needless to say that it was powerful.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Their auras rumbled in the sky, creating a terrifying whirlwind.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Ao tu was the first to attack. He transformed into his true form, revealing a flood Dragon that was several hundred meters long. His entire body was shimmering with a golden light as if he was made of gold.</p><p>“Golden storm splitting slash!”</p><p>Ao tu roared. He opened his mouth, and nine beams of dark golden light shot out. They cut through the air and flew toward Song Fei.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A sword cry resounded, and a sword light burst out like a bolt of lightning, tearing through the void and cutting through everything.</p><p>Wherever the sword-light passed, ao tu’s nine beams of golden light were all shattered.</p><p>However, the sword Qi also dissipated.</p><p>“Golden gilded Dragon Claw!”</p><p>Ao tu’s flood dragon claws turned pure gold. They were sparkling and resplendent, and they emitted terrifying ripples. With a single claw, space was torn apart. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Ao tu’s level had reached the great circle of the spirit embryo realm. When he went all out, he was comparable to a spirit God.</p><p>However, Song Fei’s cultivation was also at the great circle of the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>“You have some skills, take this!”</p><p>go! Song Fei shouted, and his bloodline appeared. It was a silver sword with seven golden chakras.</p><p>“World-breaking sword!”</p><p>Song Fei transformed into a combat sword. The silver-white combat sword emitted a dazzling light as it slashed down toward ao tu.</p><p>The combat sword and ao tu’s gilded Dragon Claw collided. The sky was filled with golden and silver light, so dazzling that many people could not open their eyes.</p><p>When the light dissipated, ao tu was seen retreating frantically. A deep sword wound had appeared on his Dragon Claw. His scales had been shattered, and blood was flowing out.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The silver sword slashed down again, and endless sword Qi scattered. It was extremely terrifying, and even the space was left with deep marks.</p><p>Ao tu roared and fought with all his might, but Song Fei’s sword Qi was extremely sharp and could cut through anything. It broke through ao tu’s attack and his defense, leaving sword wounds on his body.</p><p>Ao tu was completely at a disadvantage. Before long, a dozen sword wounds appeared on his body, each of which was several meters long. Blood gushed out of them, and some of them even fell to the ground.</p><p>“This blood contains the bloodline of a true dragon. Keep it!”</p><p>Someone was unkind enough to collect all the blood left by ao tu, which made ao tu roar in anger. However, he was no match for Song Fei even if he tried his best.</p><p>“Your flood Dragon is not bad. I just happen to be lacking a Mount. From now on, you will be my Mount!”</p><p>Song Fei said coldly. The sword light became even more terrifying.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
