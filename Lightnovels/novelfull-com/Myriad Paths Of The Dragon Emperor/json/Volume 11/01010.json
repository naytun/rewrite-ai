I will not fight for this lotus throne!</p><p>...</p><p>“Alright, you said it!”</p><p>Wu Kong’s eyes brightened.</p><p>Yang Cong was a formidable opponent. If they backed out now, they would have one less powerful opponent after they defeated Lu Ming.</p><p>In Wu Kong’s mind, his greatest opponent here was Lu Ming, followed by Yang Cong. As for the old monsters, Wu Kong was not afraid.</p><p>The few old monsters ‘eyes lit up and they looked at Lu Ming one after another.</p><p>Now, he only had to deal with Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>A berserk aura rose up. A bright light appeared above the heads of Wu Kong and the three old monsters. All kinds of bloodlines appeared.</p><p>Among the three old monsters, two of them had second level divine level bloodlines, while the other had first level divine level bloodlines. Each of them had a cultivation base at the peak of spirit embryo perfection.</p><p>As for Wu Kong, he had a sixth level divine level bloodline and his cultivation was at the later stage of the eighth level spirit embryo realm. However, the strength of his aura was stronger than any old monster.</p><p>Almost at the same time, the four of them combined their blood meridians and attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar came from within Lu Ming’s body. Lu Ming burst out with dragon energy, and a layer of purple light spread across the surface of his body.</p><p>His dragon power burst forth, and his strength increased greatly. Lu Ming took a step forward and threw a few punches in succession.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The space trembled, and the terrifying fist force attacked the four people.</p><p>The three old monsters were forced to retreat. Only Wu Kong was in a better state, but he was also forced to retreat.</p><p>A five-colored radiance covered both his fists as he activated the prison suppressing heavenly art. The might of this technique was incomparably terrifying.</p><p>With the improvement of the water concept, the power of the five concepts erupting at the same time was getting stronger and stronger.</p><p>The punch seemed to be able to destroy everything.</p><p>“Fight, fight!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl as his fighting spirit burst forth. The light shone brightly, making him look like a young God of War.</p><p>He moved unhindered, and his fist radiance shook the sky. With his strength alone, he suppressed the four people.</p><p>The space rumbled, and dozens of loud sounds rang out in succession.</p><p>Not far away, Yang Cong was extremely shocked. He then gave a bitter smile.</p><p>As expected of someone who could defeat hai Ziming, he was not his opponent.</p><p>Further away, the others were even more shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming actually suppressed four experts by himself.</p><p>It should be known that in the eyes of ordinary people, experts at the level of old monsters were almost invincible existences in the spirit embryo realm. They had awakened a divine bloodline but had not entered the spiritual God Realm. They had cultivated for at least a thousand years, and some had even cultivated for two to three thousand years. How terrifying was that?</p><p>Furthermore, there was also the monstrous genius Wu Kong. The four of them joined forces but they were still not Lu Ming’s match.</p><p>After dozens of moves, Wu Kong and the other three finally could not withstand it. Under the pressure of Lu Ming’s terrifying fist force, they all turned into human forms. Their bodies rose and fell, and their breathing was weak.</p><p>They were more or less injured.</p><p>At this moment, the four of them were extremely shocked. They looked at Lu Ming in disbelief.</p><p>a third-class heaven’s favorite. Lu Shaoqing’s combat strength has definitely reached the level of a third-class heaven’s favorite!</p><p>that’s right. Even some of the weaker third-grade heaven’s favorites don’t have such battle power.</p><p>a third-grade heaven’s favorite! They are the most powerful people in the central continent!</p><p>“The floating mountain sect only has three!”</p><p>Waves of discussions could be heard in the surroundings.</p><p>No one dared to step forward. Even if the cleansing Water lotus throne was right in front of them, they did not dare to step forward.</p><p>In front of Lu Ming’s combat strength, an ordinary perfected spirit embryo could be killed with a flip of his hand. Who would dare to step forward?</p><p>Lu Ming swept a glance at the crowd and then stepped forward toward the cleansing Water lotus throne.</p><p>Wu Kong and the other old monsters did not move. Although they were unwilling, they knew that this time, the cleansing Water lotus throne was Lu Ming’s. No one could compete with him.</p><p>Huala!</p><p>At this moment, the water in the lake churned and a huge creature suddenly appeared. It swallowed the pristine water lotus throne in one gulp and then went into the water.</p><p>It was a giant snake, the Blackwater mystical snake.</p><p>No, that was not the black serpent. It was even bigger than the dark water mystical snake, and its aura was even more shocking. It was the king of the dark water mystical snakes, the dark water King Snake.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly and took a few steps forward.</p><p>The nine Dragons heaven stomping steps burst out, and the terrifying power blasted into the black water lake.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The entire black water lake started to shake, and huge waves rose to the sky.</p><p>ah, this is bad. Lu Shaoqing has gone mad. Go, go!</p><p>“Quickly retreat!”</p><p>In the surroundings, the experts flew up into the sky in fear and then towards the shore.</p><p>The water in the lake churned and huge waves rose to the sky. Under the bombardment of the terrifying power, the shadow of the Blackwater kingsnake was faintly visible.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and hundreds of long Spears were condensed in the air, shooting toward the lake.</p><p>The king Black snake let out an angry hiss and rushed out of the black water lake, flying towards the shore.</p><p>“It’s not the Blackwater kingsnake, it’s a human!” He said.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold.</p><p>This Blackwater kingsnake wasn’t the real one. Someone with the Blackwater kingsnake bloodline had used a bloodline fusion.</p><p>This person was very scheming. His bloodline was the black water King Snake, so he was not afraid of the poison in the black water lake. He had already dived to the bottom of the lake, waiting for the opportunity to seize the pristine water lotus throne.</p><p>However, how could Lu Ming let this person get away so easily?</p><p>He took a step forward and chased after the Blackwater kingsnake like a stream of light.</p><p>Just as the Blackwater kingsnake was about to escape from the black water, a white blade light slashed at it. The blade light was extremely terrifying, emitting a bone-chilling cold.</p><p>The black snake King Snake was shocked. Its huge snake body curled up and turned back into its human form. This was an old man whose hair was about to fall out. His eyes were sinister. He dodged the blade light and wanted to escape from the other side.</p><p>However, at this moment, Lu Ming had already arrived. He threw a punch and the light from his fist enveloped the old man. His body trembled and was blocked.</p><p>“Blackwater old monster!”</p><p>Someone cried out in surprise, recognizing the old man.</p><p>The bloodline that this old man had awakened was actually a third level divine level. However, for some unknown reason, he had not broken through to the spiritual God Realm. However, his combat strength was extremely powerful and he was very famous in the region of the floating mountain sect.</p><p>Si la La!</p><p>At this moment, the surrounding temperature dropped sharply. Many people looked around and widened their eyes.</p><p>It turned out that the blade light did not hit old monster black water, but the black water lake. At this time, the entire black water lake was frozen, and the hundred-mile black water lake became an Ice Lake.</p><p>A tall and burly young man stepped through the air and appeared on the other side of Blackwater monster. He stood on either side of Lu Ming and surrounded Blackwater monster in the middle.</p><p>“Chu Kuang! It’s Chu Kuang!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>Chu Kuang actually came too. This is going to be interesting!</p><p>“Could it be that Chu Kuang has also taken a fancy to the cleansing Water lotus throne?”</p><p>While many people were shocked, their eyes also lit up.</p><p>Chu Kuang, who was ranked second among the top ten heaven’s pride experts of the floating mountain martial school, had appeared.</p><p>Chu Kuang had a burly figure and was dressed casually. He carried a saber on his back. His gaze passed over old monster Blackwater and landed on Lu Ming.</p><p>“You’re Lu Shaoqing?”</p><p>Chu Kuang asked.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“I heard that you defeated Ling yunkong and hai Ziming?” Chu Kuang asked again.</p><p>“That’s right. Do you want to stand up for them?” Lu Ming said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
