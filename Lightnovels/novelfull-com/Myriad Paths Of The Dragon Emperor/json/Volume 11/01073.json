This time, Wu Cang couldn’t block it anymore. The sword exploded, revealing his true body. He spat out a mouthful of blood and ran away frantically.</p><p>“Heavens, who is that? It seems to be Wu Cang!”</p><p>“Yes, it’s him. He’s actually fleeing and being hunted down. Who’s so powerful? Can you chase after Wu Cang?”</p><p>“Then … Isn’t that the loser? He’s the one who’s chasing after Wu Cang. He’s so terrifying. He just destroyed Wu Cang’s bloodline fusion with one punch.”</p><p>what trash? he’s clearly a rare heaven’s favorite with unparalleled combat strength. No wonder he could pass the Tiangang cave!</p><p>Not far away, five or six people were passing by. When they saw this scene, they were dumbfounded.</p><p>Wu Cang did not know Lu Ming because Wu Cang was not there when they went to the tianxu cave. He only arrived after the secret book of the Saint mansion was opened.</p><p>However, the few people who passed by recognized Lu Ming.</p><p>Back then, they had thought that Lu Ming had passed the tianxu cave by luck. Now, they were really shocked and thought that they were dreaming.</p><p>Lu Ming cast the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps at an astonishing speed. He caught up with Wu Cang in a few moments and threw another punch.</p><p>“Don’t!”</p><p>Wu Cang roared and tried his best to resist, but half of his body was still broken by the punch.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming stomped his foot down. Wu Cang screamed in pain and was torn into pieces.</p><p>Another second-grade heaven’s favorite was killed.</p><p>However, just like Xue Luo Zi, after Wu Cang was killed, another white light enveloped him. Not far away, his body actually condensed again. He looked at Lu Ming with hatred, then trembled and disappeared without a trace.</p><p>“Another destiny talisman!”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>These second-class geniuses all had the potential to become emperors. The major forces valued them and paid a high price to buy destiny talismans from Tianxia Academy.</p><p>Almost every second-grade heaven’s favorite had a piece.</p><p>A second-grade heaven’s favorite was too important. He had the chance to become an Emperor.</p><p>An Emperor could make a force an Overlord force and prosper for ten to twenty thousand years. His role was simply too great. He was many times more important than a Supreme-being.</p><p>Those Overlord forces hoped that they would have a successor. If there was no successor, there would be no new emperor in the future generations, and an Overlord force would quickly weaken, such as Medicine King’s Valley and the talisman sect.</p><p>In the history of the divine wilderness continent, there were countless Overlord factions. However, how many of them could continue to prosper and pass down their legacy?</p><p>Very few!</p><p>Many of the Overlord forces had been weakened because there were no emperors among the latecomers. One could imagine how much the Overlord forces valued second-grade geniuses.</p><p>In the distance, those people gasped and broke out in cold sweat. Lu Ming was too ruthless. He killed a second-grade heaven’s favorite just like that. Fortunately, he had the destiny talisman. Otherwise, the heaven martial Sword School would have gone crazy.</p><p>Lu Ming swept a glance at the few of them and ignored them. He returned to the edge of the cliff and continued to comprehend the killing move.</p><p>Tianxia Academy was still surrounded by people outside the Wanxiang Jade wall.</p><p>High up in the sky, the various Supreme martial artists were sitting cross-legged, waiting silently.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, a white light flashed and Wu Cang’s figure appeared.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes looked over in unison.</p><p>Wu Cang, it’s Wu Cang. He’s been killed. What kind of danger did he encounter? ”</p><p>it seems that the secret realm is really dangerous. I wonder how many of those who didn’t have life talismans died? ”</p><p>danger is accompanied by opportunity. If there’s something to gain, it’s worth it!</p><p>Many people looked at Wu Cang and discussed among themselves.</p><p>“Wu Cang, what’s going on?”</p><p>A Supreme martial artist from the tianwu Sword School asked.</p><p>Wu Cang didn’t dare to not answer the Supreme martial artist’s question, so he immediately began to explain.</p><p>“A dark-skinned young man with a simple and honest appearance but extremely cunning …”</p><p>Wu Cang did not know what Lu Ming’s name was, so he described his appearance.</p><p>“What? Wasn’t this the same face as Lu Shaoqing? He again!”</p><p>he’s really a god of death. First, he killed many experts from cold-blood Hall, then blood Luo, and now he killed Wu Cang. He’s really terrifying!</p><p>he killed so many heaven’s favorites. His combat strength is so shocking. I’m afraid he’s at the top even among the second-grade heaven’s favorites.</p><p>Many people exclaimed.</p><p>Cold-blood Hall’s people looked gloomy, and blood Luo Zi gritted his teeth.</p><p>If you guys are discussing, then go ahead. Why did you have to involve them?</p><p>On the cliff in the secret realm of the Saint mansion, Lu Ming was studying carefully.</p><p>Every time the giant Eagle returned, he would leave. The next day, when the giant Eagle went out to look for food, he would go and comprehend.</p><p>For five consecutive days, he had gained a lot.</p><p>The mark was not complete. It was only a kind of ‘intent’. Lu Ming comprehended five killing styles from this intent. Lu Ming named them the five killing styles.</p><p>The five slaughter forms didn’t have any specific moves. It was just a kind of slaughter concept’s usage method. In other words, without slaughter concept, it was completely useless.</p><p>However, when Lu Ming borrowed the power of the third Blood Meridian, he could borrow the slaughter concept, and the five killing styles could come in handy.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had only borrowed the power of the third bloodline. With the five techniques of massacre, it would undoubtedly be more powerful.</p><p>“It’s almost time!”</p><p>Five days later, Lu Ming got up and left.</p><p>This imprint was not complete, so even if he continued to comprehend it, he would not gain much.</p><p>Lu Ming left the place and continued to look for opportunities.</p><p>A day later, Lu Ming arrived at a lush mountain range.</p><p>nest, why have all the spirit herbs on the way been dug up? which bastard did this? ”</p><p>Dandan ran around like a gust of wind, cursing and swearing.</p><p>The spiritual Qi in this mountain range was very dense. Ancient trees towered into the sky. Along the way, they found dozens of pits, all left behind by the spiritual herbs that had been dug out.</p><p>According to dandan’s speculation, they were all left behind by level eight spirit herbs. His anger had obviously been taken by someone else.</p><p>they dug too thoroughly. Not a single hair was left!</p><p>Dandan sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming was also speechless. They had changed a few positions in this forest and it was the same.</p><p>“There’s someone in front!”</p><p>Suddenly, dandan widened her eyes and climbed onto Lu Ming’s shoulder.</p><p>Lu Ming concealed his aura and moved forward carefully.</p><p>In front of him, a figure in white clothes was Walking in the Air and flashing in the forest.</p><p>He looked very young from the back, but he was bald and had a round and smooth head.</p><p>His movement technique was extremely fast, like a gust of wind. In a moment, he appeared in front of a spiritual herb.</p><p>“I have rice hair, good, good!”</p><p>The bald man groaned and then waved his sleeve. The spiritual herb left the ground and was collected by him.</p><p>“This … Could he be a Saint monk from the Western Desert?”</p><p>Lu Ming was greatly shocked.</p><p>Legend had it that the Western Desert was different from other places. They cultivated the Dharma, and the entire Western Desert was mainly focused on the Dharma, with ancient temples everywhere.</p><p>Looking at the bald man’s clothes and the name of Buddha, he was clearly a holy monk of the Western Desert.</p><p>After the Holy monk put away the spirit herbs, he continued forward. Not long after, he came to a dark underground cave and observed it carefully.</p><p>After a while, he retreated a few miles and took out a round plate. Then, a purple light beam shot up into the sky.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
