I’m really lucky today!</p><p>...</p><p>haha, that’s right. If other people knew about this, they would be so envious!</p><p>The young men began to flatter her, hoping to gain her attention.</p><p>“Since everyone is so excited, and it’s rare for us to gather together after the battle of Providence, why don’t we use martial arts to liven things up?”</p><p>Huang Kui raised his wine cup and strode out, his voice echoing throughout the entire area.</p><p>Everyone’s hearts moved. The show was about to begin.</p><p>With so many heaven’s favorites here, drinking was just one of the reasons. Sparring was also a must. Obviously, Huang Kui was the first to suggest this.</p><p>“Using martial arts to liven things up, naturally!”</p><p>With a wave of her hands, inscriptions glowed on the ground. In an empty space not far away, light flickered, and a fighting ring appeared.</p><p>this battle platform was originally built by our sect’s seniors for sparring. It’s sturdy and immortal. Everyone, please feel free to display your skills!</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang introduced.</p><p>“Alright, thank you, fairy Tan Xiang!”</p><p>Huang Kui laughed as he stepped forward and landed on the fighting stage. His eyes swept around, finally landing on Chu Kuang as he said,”Chu Kuang, you lost to me in the battle of Providence. Half a year has passed. I wonder how much progress you’ve made. Do you dare to fight me?”</p><p>“Why wouldn’t I?”</p><p>Chu Kuang drank a cup of wine in one gulp. His body moved and he landed on the fighting stage.</p><p>“Miss Zhang, what are brother Chu’s chances of winning?”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Zhang Wenjin.</p><p>Zhang Wenjin’s expression was grave. She also sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming. it’s hard to say. Huang Kui is the second most powerful genius in cold-blood Hall. Brother Chu was defeated by him in the battle of Providence. Although brother Chu has improved in the past six months, Huang Kui will not stagnate!</p><p>it turns out that Huang Kui is also from cold-blood Hall!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. No wonder blood Luo Zi had shouted at him coldly and told him to get lost.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, the two of them had already started fighting in the fighting ring.</p><p>The two powerful auras collided with each other, creating a violent boom.</p><p>Chu Kuang and Huang Kui’s cultivation was at the early stage of the ninth level spirit embryo realm. It was clear that they had just broken through.</p><p>“Ten thousand miles of ice!”</p><p>Chu Kuang’s blade flashed, and the terrifying cold Qi seemed to be able to freeze the entire alchemy division.</p><p>“Hmph, it’s this move again, blood flame claw!”</p><p>Huang Kui’s blood Qi was boiling as he clawed out claw rays. These claw rays reeked of blood, and within them, there was a burning heat.</p><p>The blood-red flame and the ice continued to collide with each other, causing a sizzling sound to be heard on the fighting ring.</p><p>The ice was melted by the fire, and a mist filled the air.</p><p>Yin BUPO waved his hand, and the cold wind whistled, blowing away the mist.</p><p>At this moment, the paragons of the outer court had also heard the commotion. They all rose into the air and looked over.</p><p>“Chu Kuang has made a move, and his opponent is Huang Kui!”</p><p>Hai Ziming said.</p><p>“In the battle of Providence, Chu Kuang lost to senior brother Huang Kui. This time, Chu Kuang will definitely lose!”</p><p>A cold-blood Hall genius sneered.</p><p>“Times have changed, I don’t think so!”</p><p>Hai Ziming replied coldly.</p><p>“Oh, really? Just watch!”</p><p>The cold-blood Hall disciple sneered.</p><p>Cold-blood Hall was next to the floating mountain, and their relationship was not good.</p><p>In the land of central continent, the various emperors stood side by side. The various overlords and forces were divided and fought for hegemony with each other. They were not harmonious and had conflicts with each other.</p><p>For example, the sky Eagle Castle and cold-blood Hall were mortal enemies. At the same time, the relationship between cold-blood Hall and floating mountain was not good.</p><p>As the crowd discussed, the battle on the fighting ring became even more intense. The two of them had already exchanged more than a hundred moves.</p><p>“The bloodthirsty’s world!”</p><p>Huang Kui displayed a terrifying technique of the cold-blood Hall. A blood-red light curtain burst out in all directions. Chu Kuang’s expression changed drastically, and he quickly retreated as if he was very afraid.</p><p>But even though he retreated, he was still affected. The blood in his body was boiling, as if it was about to leave his body.</p><p>“Blood Flame Emperor hand!”</p><p>Huang Kui once again changed his technique, and his attacks became even more violent. Chu Kuang had no choice but to use his bloodline fusion.</p><p>But immediately after, Huang Kui also used bloodline fusion. It turned out to be a blood-red Claw. It seemed to be the claw of some kind of living creature, and its power was terrifying.</p><p>The two bloodlines clashed in the air, and a few dozen more moves quickly passed. However, it was obvious that Huang Kui was stronger, and he slowly gained the upper hand. In the end, Chu Kuang’s bloodline was torn apart by the blood claw, and he transformed back into his human form. Blood spurted out of his mouth, and his expression was extremely unsightly.</p><p>Huang Kui also transformed into his human form and laughed,”Chu Kuang, I think you’re becoming more and more useless. You’re losing even faster than the last time. You’ll never be my opponent. Hahaha!”</p><p>Huang Kui laughed arrogantly, his voice filled with contempt.</p><p>Chu Kuang’s face was gloomy, but he didn’t say anything. Since he had lost, saying that everything was in vain would only make him lose even more face.</p><p>“Ha ha, I told you, Chu Kuang will definitely lose. Your floating mountain sect, other than the Jing Kong Ling, there’s no one else you can take out!”</p><p>In the air above the outer yard, cold-blood Hall’s sovereigns sneered, while hai Ziming and the others had ugly expressions.</p><p>However, cold-blood Hall’s sovereign was right. The floating mountain sect was indeed slightly weaker than cold-blood Hall.</p><p>Even among the Overlord forces, there were strong and weak forces. The floating mountain was considered weak among the Overlord forces, while cold-blood Hall was obviously stronger.</p><p>Chu Kuang walked down from the fighting ring with an unsightly expression. He came to Wenjin Zhang’s side and sighed.</p><p>Losing to Huang Kui for the second time was a huge blow to Chu Kuang.</p><p>“Big brother Chu, it’s normal to win or lose. Winning once doesn’t mean that you’ll always win. I believe that big brother Chu will be able to defeat Huang Kui in the future!”</p><p>Zhang Wenjin comforted her.</p><p>“Wenjin, I’m fine!”</p><p>Chu Kuang smiled and quickly adjusted his state of mind.</p><p>Huang Kui was still standing on the fighting ring, feeling smug and proud. He had an invincible look on his face. Finally, his gaze landed on Lu Ming and a cold glint flashed across his eyes.</p><p>“Lu Shaoqing, do you dare to come up and fight me?”</p><p>Huang Kui shouted.</p><p>He had his eyes on Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually been invited by fairy Tan Xiang to sit with her and the rest. This made him extremely jealous.</p><p>What was Lu Ming? How could he sit with fairy Tan Xiang and the others?</p><p>How strong could a person who did not participate in the battle of Providence be?</p><p>Huang Kui was certain that Lu Ming was not strong. Perhaps he was just lucky to have met goddess Tan Xiang. Moreover, Lu Ming had come with Chu Kuang. He wanted to suppress Lu Ming in public and humiliate him. He wanted to prove that he was stronger than Lu Ming. This would also be a blow to Chu Kuang.</p><p>“You want to challenge me?”</p><p>Lu Ming cast a sidelong glance at Huang Kui and spoke indifferently.</p><p>that’s right. Do you dare to fight? if you don’t, then quickly admit defeat and get out of here!</p><p>Huang Kui laughed in disdain.</p><p>hehe, okay, I agree. However, I won’t take advantage of you. You’ve been exhausted in the battle just now. Let’s fight again after you’ve recovered!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“There’s no need for that. It’s just dealing with Chu Kuang. It won’t cost me much. And even if it does, I’m confident that it’ll be more than enough to deal with you!”</p><p>Huang Kui had a confident expression.</p><p>“Oh, really? Then do as you wish!”</p><p>Lu Ming stood up and took a step forward, appearing on the fighting ring.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were on Lu Ming.</p><p>Many people’s eyes were filled with anticipation. Lu Ming had actually been invited by fairy Tan Xiang to sit at the same table as them. Everyone was very curious. What kind of abilities did Lu Ming have?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
