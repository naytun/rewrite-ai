This is young master Lu, Lu Shaoqing. It’s all thanks to young master Lu that I’m able to come back alive to see you!</p><p>Zhou Xin pulled the middle-aged man aside and introduced him to Lu Ming.</p><p>junior Lu Shaoqing greets the Lu family head!</p><p>Lu Ming went forward and cupped his fists.</p><p>haha, young master Lu, you are too kind. You saved my daughter, so you are the benefactor of the Zhou family. Come, let us go in first. You must have had a hard time coming here. Take a rest first. Tomorrow, I will order someone to prepare a banquet to thank young master Lu!</p><p>The clan leader of the Zhou clan said courteously.</p><p>“Zhou family head is too polite!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists.</p><p>The group of them walked into the Zhou residence.</p><p>The Zhou family was huge, and there were palaces, pavilions, cultivation rooms, and training rooms built among the peaks.</p><p>The air was filled with dense fire-type spiritual Qi. It was obvious that the Zhou family was cultivating fire-type cultivation techniques.</p><p>After entering the Zhou family residence, they quickly arranged an elegant courtyard for Lu Ming to stay in.</p><p>In the room, Lu Ming sat cross-legged.</p><p>this is a good place to comprehend the fire concept!</p><p>Then, he closed his eyes and started to comprehend the intent realm.</p><p>After this period of cultivation, his mentality had all improved. However, other than the water mentality, his other mentalities had not broken through to the fourth level.</p><p>Although the wind, fire, and Thunder intents were very close to level four, they were still lacking and had not broken through.</p><p>……</p><p>In the Zhou family head’s room, Zhou Xin was standing in front of him.</p><p>At this moment, the Zhou family head’s eyes were filled with excitement. He looked at Zhou Xin and said, ” “Xin ‘er, did you really get that treasure?”</p><p>“Father, I’ve already obtained it!”</p><p>Zhou Xin was also excited. Her palm glowed and a Jade box appeared. She handed it to the Zhou family head.</p><p>The Zhou clan leader took the jade box with trembling hands. He took a deep breath and opened the jade box. There was a Jade token inside.</p><p>The Zhou clan leader took out the Jade token and scanned the contents of the Jade token with his mind. Slowly, his body began to tremble and he revealed a look of wild joy.</p><p>it’s true, it’s true. It’s a Supreme treasure, a Supreme treasure. It’s just as the ancient records say. With it, the Zhou family has hope of rising again. Haha!</p><p>The Zhou clan leader couldn’t help but laugh.</p><p>“But father, the materials on it are not easy to find!”</p><p>Zhou Xin replied.</p><p>The Zhou clan leader took a deep breath and calmed himself down. yes, it’s not easy to find the materials, but there’s always hope if we take it slow. By the way, Xin ‘er, how did you escape? I’ve received news that cold-blood Hall has mobilized a large force this time. Did you really rely on that Lu kid to save you? ”</p><p>Zhou Xin nodded. indeed, I only managed to escape because Lu Shaoqing saved me. Lu Shaoqing is a peerless heaven’s favorite. I heard that even the blood Luo disciples lost to him!</p><p>“What? Even blood Luo Zi was defeated by him!”</p><p>Lu Shaoqing? ” the head of the Zhou family was shocked and in disbelief. He had never heard of Lu Shaoqing’s name before.</p><p>The Zhou clan leader then asked,”who is this Lu Shaoqing?” Even if he’s a peerless talent, I’m afraid it’ll be difficult for him to save you from cold-blood Hall.”</p><p>“Father, it’s like this …”</p><p>Zhou Xin then told him all the information she had heard about Lu Ming and how he had saved her.</p><p>“What? A Grotto-heaven treasure? you’re saying that Lu Shaoqing has a Grotto-heaven treasure?”</p><p>After listening to Zhou Xin’s explanation, the Zhou family head’s eyes widened in shock. His eyes flashed with an incomparably hot flame.</p><p>that’s right, that must be a treasure of the heavenly abode. It’s a universe of its own, and living beings can live in it. It stretches for a hundred thousand miles, exactly the same as the legendary heavenly abode treasure!</p><p>Zhou Xin was certain.</p><p>She was shocked when Lu Ming first put her into the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>a Grotto-heaven treasure! A Grotto-heaven treasure!</p><p>The fire in the Zhou clan leader’s eyes grew more and more intense. He then asked, ” “Xiner, which Overlord force do you think Lu Shaoqing is from?”</p><p>“Yes, that’s what Lu Shaoqing said to others!”</p><p>Zhou Xin replied.</p><p>“Good, that’s good!”</p><p>A killing intent flashed in the eyes of the clan leader of the Zhou clan.</p><p>“Father, what are you doing?” Zhou Xin was shocked.</p><p>Xin ‘er, as you know, tens of thousands of years ago, our Zhou family also gave birth to a Supreme martial artist and was a powerful force second only to the overlords. However, we have not become what we are today. If this continues, we will be destroyed in the central continent sooner or later.</p><p>it’s not enough to rely on that kind of treasure alone. The materials are too difficult to find. However, Lu Shaoqing actually has a Grotto-heaven treasure. He must have encountered a great opportunity. He’s so powerful at such a young age. His cultivation techniques, martial arts techniques, secret skills, and even other treasures are absolutely amazing. If everything he has belongs to the Zhou family, with that treasure, the Zhou family will have a chance of rising!</p><p>The Zhou clan leader said coldly, his eyes filled with anticipation.</p><p>“Father, you … Do you want to kill … Lu Shaoqing?”</p><p>Zhou Xin said in a trembling voice.</p><p>no, we’ll take him down first and seal all his cultivation. Then, we’ll force him to hand over his Grotto-heaven treasure and all his treasures. He’ll tell us his secrets, and then we’ll kill him. After all, a treasure as important as the grotto-heaven treasure must have been kept in his sea of consciousness. We won’t be able to take it out if we kill him.</p><p>The Zhou clan leader’s gaze was extremely cold, and his voice was even colder.</p><p>Zhou Xin shivered and said in a trembling voice, ” but father, Lu Shaoqing has saved my life. He has saved me twice. I can’t bear to treat him like this!</p><p>“Silly!”</p><p>The clan leader of the Zhou clan waved his sleeves and berated, ” “So what if he saved you? “This world is cruel. If you’re indecisive and your methods are not ruthless enough, you won’t be able to rise. You’ll die in the hands of others sooner or later. Those who do great things don’t care about the trifles. As long as we get Lu Shaoqing’s secrets and treasures, our Zhou family will have a chance to rise. Do you want to see our Zhou family fall forever?”</p><p>there’s one more thing. You met Lu Shaoqing in the ancient herb garden, and then you were surrounded by cold-blood Hall. You risked your life and didn’t hand over your storage ring. Don’t you think Lu Shaoqing would be suspicious? If this news gets out and cold-blood Hall comes to us, the Zhou family will be destroyed. So no matter what, we can’t let Lu Shaoqing Live!”</p><p>The head of the Zhou family stared at Zhou Xin with his bright eyes. Under his gaze, Zhou Xin wavered.</p><p>“Father, Xin ‘er will listen to you!” She sighed.</p><p>hmm, that’s more like it. How about this, we’ll hold a banquet for him tomorrow. I’ll put Qingming powder in the food and wine. This medicine is colorless and tasteless. No matter how high your cultivation base is, you won’t be able to sense it. Once you take it, you won’t be able to use your true essence.</p><p>this Lu Shaoqing is so concerned about you. I guess he’s interested in you and won’t be on guard against you. When he takes the clarity powder, he’ll be at our mercy!</p><p>The Zhou clan leader had a look of confidence.</p><p>father, Lu Shaoqing is no small matter. A single type of clarity powder might not be enough to guarantee our safety. We can’t let our guard down against a prodigy like him!</p><p>Zhou Xin replied.</p><p>that’s right. You’re right. I was careless. I’ll report this to the patriarch and ask him to come out of seclusion. Even if something goes wrong, the patriarch can easily suppress Lu Shaoqing!</p><p>The clan leader of the Zhou clan nodded.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
