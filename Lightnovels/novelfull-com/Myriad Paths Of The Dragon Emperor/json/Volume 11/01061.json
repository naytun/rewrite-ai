Someone else went in. Who was it? I wanted to go in and give it a try!”</p><p>I don’t know. I don’t know him. He’s just a small fry. I think he’ll be out in less than two minutes.</p><p>what an exciting day. Three people passed the Tiangang cave in a row.</p><p>Yeah, but the strongest group of people have already entered. There shouldn’t be anyone else who will pass!</p><p>Many people were chatting casually, planning to wait for Lu Ming to fail and be teleported out.</p><p>However, one minute, two minutes, ten minutes had passed and Lu Ming still had not come out.</p><p>nest, that guy can actually hold on for so long. Strange!</p><p>“Let’s wait a little longer. Maybe he’ll come out in a while.”</p><p>However, Lu Ming still did not come out after waiting for a long time. They could not help but look at each other.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming stepped into the tianxu cave, the surrounding environment changed. He came to a platform.</p><p>“A formation!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. This Tiangang cave had an extremely powerful formation.</p><p>“Eh? No, my cultivation!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was shocked to find that his cultivation level was dropping rapidly.</p><p>From the spiritual God Realm to the spirit embryo realm, then to the spirit ocean, then to the king realm, and then to the Grandmaster realm …</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming’s cultivation level dropped to ninth grade warrior realm before it stopped.</p><p>His domain, second and third bloodlines were all sealed.</p><p>Only the bloodline of the nine Dragons had not been sealed. The combat strength he could exert was actually similar to when he was in ninth grade warrior realm.</p><p>There was a long spear stuck in the ground beside Lu Ming.</p><p>In front of the platform, a figure condensed.</p><p>It was a middle-aged man with a long sword on his back. Judging from his aura, he was at the 1-dan master realm.</p><p>that long spear is a weapon for you. If you can defeat me, you will be able to move on to the next stage!</p><p>The middle-aged man said coldly. Then, he unsheathed his sword. A sharp sword light cut through the air, making an ear-piercing whistling sound, and slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming pulled out the long spear beside him. He shook the long spear and cast the ” fire gun technique “.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The long spear turned into a rainbow light and arrived first. It pierced through the middle of the middle-aged man’s eyebrows and killed him.</p><p>The middle-aged man’s figure collapsed and disappeared without a trace.</p><p>is this a test of my combat strength when I’m in ninth grade warrior realm? ”</p><p>Lu Ming guessed in his heart.</p><p>In the next moment, three figures appeared in front of the platform. They were three middle-aged men with the same cultivation and were all at the first grade master realm.</p><p>The three of them unsheathed their swords at the same time and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>He shook his long spear and fought with the three middle-aged men. In a short while, he had killed the three men.</p><p>When Lu Ming was in the ninth grade warrior realm, it was not difficult for him to kill a first grade master realm martial artist.</p><p>After killing the three of them, the surroundings changed again. Lu Ming appeared on another platform.</p><p>“My cultivation has reached the ninth grade master realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He realized that his cultivation had reached the ninth grade master realm.</p><p>Another middle-aged man appeared in front of him. He looked the same as the previous man, but his cultivation was completely different. The aura that this middle-aged man was emitting was clearly at the first grade great Martial Master realm.</p><p>As expected, it was testing Lu Ming’s combat ability at each stage?</p><p>There was nothing much to say. The two of them started fighting and Lu Ming killed the middle-aged man in one move.</p><p>In the next moment, three first grade great Martial Master middle-aged men appeared. They were also killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming’s cultivation rose to the ninth grade Grandmaster realm, while the opponent he faced was a first grade martial arts Grandmaster.</p><p>The result was the same. Lu Ming overcame all difficulties and passed this round.</p><p>In the next round, Lu Ming’s cultivation was at the half-step King realm, and his opponent was at the first level of the martial King realm.</p><p>At this time, Lu Ming discovered that he could use the power of his second bloodline, but it could only exert the power of a half-step King.</p><p>Lu Ming spent some time in this battle.</p><p>This was because the further one advanced, the more difficult it was to cross realms and fight.</p><p>However, Lu Ming still managed to clear it.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s cultivation level rose to peak-tier King while his opponent became at the first level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>This battle took even more time, but he still made it through.</p><p>After that, it was the great circle of the spirit sea realm and the first level of the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>Also passed!</p><p>However, when Lu Ming’s cultivation level rose to the great circle of the spirit embryo realm and he fought against the first level of the spiritual God Realm, he finally met with a real challenge.</p><p>In the beginning, when he was facing a first level spiritual God, Lu Ming could still be more relaxed and kill him in the end.</p><p>However, he encountered a huge challenge when he fought against the three first level spiritual God Realm experts.</p><p>Lu Ming did his best to fight against three first level spiritual God Realm experts.</p><p>This battle lasted for half an hour. Lu Ming finally managed to kill the three first level spiritual God Realm experts with great difficulty. He was also severely injured.</p><p>“This is too difficult. If it’s this difficult, how did the pure spatial spirit pass? How did the Emperor God pass?”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless.</p><p>It was hard to say for yang potian, but Lu Ming was certain that it was impossible for the pure space spirit and the Emperor God to kill three first level spiritual God Realm experts when they were at the perfected spirit embryo realm.</p><p>everyone faces a different situation in tianxu cave. Could it be that I’m unlucky and have encountered a difficult one? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was somewhat speechless.</p><p>At this moment, the surrounding environment changed. Lu Ming discovered that there was a cave in front of him and bright light was shining from the cave.</p><p>Lu Ming had passed through the tianxu cave’s exit.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming realized that his cultivation had recovered to the first level of the spiritual God Realm and the injuries he had suffered earlier had also healed.</p><p>Without any hesitation, he took a step forward.</p><p>As soon as he went out, he saw some people outside the cave staring at him with wide eyes, their faces full of disbelief.</p><p>There were undoubtedly more people guarding the entrance of the tianxu cave, but at this time, some people were already impatient.</p><p>“Who is it? Why didn’t he come out after so long? I’ve been waiting for an hour!”</p><p>“Yeah, who went in just now? Could he be another second-grade heaven’s favorite? I didn’t see it just now.”</p><p>“No, I’ve never seen that person before. I don’t know him!”</p><p>“You don’t know him? He’s just a small fish, and he was able to go in for so long. Could it be that he’ll pass?”</p><p>“Impossible, it’s impossible to pass!”</p><p>At this moment, a cry of disbelief came from the direction of the tianxu cave’s exit.</p><p>passed! Someone else passed!</p><p>“Who is he? Why haven’t I seen him before?”</p><p>The voice was clearly transmitted over, causing the people at the entrance of tianxu cave to be dumbfounded and look at each other.</p><p>“He actually passed? who was it? Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Almost everyone flew toward the tianxu cave’s exit. They were all surprised to see Lu Ming.</p><p>This was because no one really knew who he was. They had never seen him before.</p><p>Lu Ming looked around with a bitter smile, a simple and honest smile on his tanned face.</p><p>“Are they from the East continent?”</p><p>Someone asked the divine Emperor.</p><p>“No, I’ve never seen him before!”</p><p>The Emperor God shook his head.</p><p>“He is also not from our Northern Plains!”</p><p>The ones who spoke were a few burly young men who were carrying maces and axes on their backs and seemed to be mad.</p><p>These were the heaven’s favorites from Northern Plains.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
