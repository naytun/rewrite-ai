Cold-blood Hall experts were killed one by one. Of course, not all of them were in the spiritual God Realm. Many of them were in the spirit embryo realm. They could not stop Lu Ming at all. In a flash, Lu Ming appeared in front of blood Luo.</p><p>“No! No!”</p><p>Blood Luo Zi screamed and tried to escape, but Lu Ming’s sword cut him in half.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming frowned. He saw a ball of white light wrap around blood Luo Zi’s body and fly into the sky. The next moment, blood Luo Zi’s body regrouped. He was not dead, but his eyes were filled with hatred.</p><p>Lu Shaoqing, cold-blood Hall will not let you off!</p><p>With a loud roar, Xue Luo Zi disappeared in a flash of white light.</p><p>“Life talisman!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>He had heard that the most powerful geniuses of the major forces had the life talisman of the Saint mansion. Even if they died, they could be resurrected outside. It seemed to be true.</p><p>“Amazing!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. This kind of life talisman was integrated with the heaven and earth rules of this secret realm. It was mysterious and unpredictable. As long as one wore the life talisman, one could not be killed.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that it was a pity.</p><p>However, the others from cold-blood Hall did not have this kind of treatment. If they died, they would really die.</p><p>At this time, dandan rushed toward the Jade talisman, and at least a dozen vines whipped at him. Dandan stepped in the void, and an inscription formation appeared. Its body actually flashed in the air, avoiding the vines, and rushed past, appearing in front of the Jade talisman.</p><p>He grabbed the Jade talisman with one claw and stuffed it into his mouth.</p><p>“Let’s go, we got it!”</p><p>Dandan shouted and ran forward.</p><p>Squeak …</p><p>At this time, an ear-piercing sound resounded through the world. In the sky above the mountain, the rocks exploded. The main body of the bloodthirsty vine had completely awakened and let out a furious roar.</p><p>It was a lump-like object, like a root, with countless vines extending out from it.</p><p>Countless vines danced wildly and whistled through the air. In an instant, dozens of cold-blood Hall disciples in the spirit embryo realm were killed by the vines and their blood was all devoured.</p><p>After devouring the fresh blood, the bloodthirsty Vine’s aura became stronger and more terrifying.</p><p>“Go, quickly go!”</p><p>die! Xue Feng roared. He waved his claws and broke several vines before running forward.</p><p>The remaining cold-blood Hall disciples also fled for their lives.</p><p>Dandan was extremely agile, and its inscriptions glowed. The vines actually couldn’t catch it.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped on the air and flew in the direction of dandan.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Dandan leaped onto Lu Ming’s shoulder and shouted, ” “Go, quickly go!”</p><p>It was because the bloodthirsty vine had its eyes on them and was chasing after Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming used the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps and his speed was shockingly fast. With a flash of light, his figure disappeared into the distance.</p><p>In all directions, the people from the small forces and the remaining cold-blood Hall experts took the opportunity to escape. After running for tens of thousands of miles, the cold-blood Hall people rushed out of the light shield.</p><p>Without the light barrier’s suppression, their speed skyrocketed. They turned into streaks of blood light and disappeared from this place. They only stopped after they had travelled a few hundred thousand miles.</p><p>Then, they all looked at each other.</p><p>“Lu Shaoqing, you deserve to die!”</p><p>Xue Feng almost vomited blood as he roared with red eyes.</p><p>Tragic, too tragic.</p><p>Cold-blood Hall had sent in hundreds of people, but at this time, there were less than 100 people left. At least 200 people had died.</p><p>Most of them were spirit embryo realm martial artists, but there were also quite a few who were strong practitioners of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>The most important thing was that the ten strongest people of the young generation of cold-blood Hall were almost all dead. Only two people were left, and there were only three people left, including master Xue Luo, who was still alive because of the life talisman.</p><p>It was really too tragic. The losses were incomparably heavy.</p><p>Among them, Lu Ming had killed more than ten spiritual God experts.</p><p>There were not many spiritual God experts even in the Overlord forces. Lu Ming had killed more than half of cold-blood Hall’s previous talents.</p><p>“Lu Shaoqing, if I don’t kill you, I’m not a human!”</p><p>Xue Feng roared, his voice spreading out for hundreds of miles.</p><p>Lu Ming sprinted madly. After tens of thousands of miles, he had also rushed out of the light Shield’s range. His speed increased greatly, but the bloodthirsty vine was chasing after him. Lu Ming used all his strength and flew for hundreds of thousands of miles before he managed to shake off the bloodthirsty vine.</p><p>“This guy is really hard to deal with!”</p><p>After finding a secret place, Lu Ming entered the mountain and river diagram. He heaved a long sigh and then began to refine the blood essence energy that he had devoured.</p><p>……</p><p>Tianxia Academy, outside the Wanxiang Jade wall.</p><p>Suddenly, the space trembled. With a flash of light, Xue Luo Zi’s body appeared.</p><p>Instantly, everyone’s eyes fell on Xue Luo Zi.</p><p>Xue Luo Zi was dead. Everyone knew that he had died in the battle because of the life talisman.</p><p>This was the first heaven’s favorite to die in battle with a life talisman.</p><p>“Blood Luo Zi, what’s going on?”</p><p>An elder from cold-blood Hall asked. He was a Supreme of cold-blood Hall.</p><p>The others also looked at blood Luo Zi. They were very curious about what had happened inside. Blood Luo Zi had actually died in battle.</p><p>“Lu Shaoqing, it’s Lu Shaoqing …”</p><p>Xue Luo Zi roared viciously and explained the situation briefly.</p><p>“What? It’s that trash!”</p><p>After hearing this, everyone was shocked. Many people were dumbfounded.</p><p>Lu Ming’s passing of the tianxu cave had attracted many people’s attention. However, during the screening later on, Lu Ming’s results were too poor. Many people thought that Lu Ming was a weakling who had passed the tianxu cave by luck.</p><p>However, after hearing what master Xue Luo said, many people felt a lingering fear. This wasn’t a battle trash. He was clearly a God of killing, a Shura.</p><p>“That guy is just pretending to be a pig to eat a Tiger!”</p><p>that’s right. He’s too despicable. He must have hidden his strength before!</p><p>Lu Shaoqing, I’ve heard of him. He appeared in the city of dan before. That time, he defeated blood Luo Zi. He’s a heaven’s favorite who suddenly appeared!</p><p>haha, cold-blood Hall has suffered a great loss this time. They actually chose a God of killing to go in with them!</p><p>Many people were discussing loudly. Some overlords, such as the sky Eagle Castle and the floating mountain, were not afraid of cold-blood Hall at all. They looked at cold-blood Hall with ridicule.</p><p>The cold-blood Hall members were so angry that their lungs hurt and they had the urge to vomit blood.</p><p>Especially Xue Luozi, who was so angry that his stomach hurt.</p><p>He was the one who had chosen Lu Ming to enter. Lu Ming had not given him the quota for the marrow cleansing pool and had even mocked him. He had planned to make Lu Ming regret it in the Saint mansion secret realm. He had never expected to bring a god of death in.</p><p>If it were not for Lu Ming, they would not have been so miserable even if they had to face the bloodthirsty vine.</p><p>He was completely to blame.</p><p>“I hope Xue Feng can kill that bastard!”</p><p>The cold-blood Hall members gritted their teeth, hoping that Xue Feng could kill Lu Ming.</p><p>……</p><p>In the secret realm of the Saint mansion, Lu Ming was refining the blood essence with all his might. A few hours later, the energy of the blood essence had been completely refined.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation level increased rapidly, reaching the peak of the first level of the spiritual God Realm in one go.</p><p>However, his bloodline did not improve.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming’s two types of blood vessels were at divine Level Seven, it was very, very difficult to improve them. He needed a huge amount of blood essence.</p><p>it’s a pity that a large portion of the blood essence was devoured by the bloodthirsty vine. Otherwise, if I were to devour all the energy of so many experts, it would be enough for me to break through to the second level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that it was a pity.</p><p>it’s still not safe here. The bloodthirsty vine is an ancient evil creature. Once it’s born, it’ll go crazy and kill people. Its strength will skyrocket. I’d better stay away from it first!</p><p>After exiting the mountain and river diagram, Lu Ming flew into the distance.</p><p>Lu Ming only slowed down after flying for more than a million miles.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
