When he arrived, he was shocked to see that there was already a long line at the registration area.</p><p>...</p><p>To some of the smaller powers, the Imperial Dragon guards was a good job. Joining the Imperial Dragon guards was equivalent to joining the ancient Saint dynasty, and they would be able to obtain more cultivation resources.</p><p>those below the spirit embryo realm, hurry up and leave. We don’t need those below the spirit embryo realm!</p><p>At the registration area, there were a few burly men dressed in long purple robes embroidered with flood Dragons. These were the Imperial Dragon guards.</p><p>Their auras were very strong. Lu Ming swept his gaze across them and realized that they were all at the seventh level spirit embryo realm or above.</p><p>There was also an old man sitting at the side, resting with his eyes closed. He was also wearing the clothes of the Imperial Dragon guards, but his aura was unfathomable. Of course, it could not hide from Lu Ming’s senses. Lu Ming discovered that this person was an existence at the first level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>only those at the spirit embryo realm and above can join. The requirements are too high. Let’s go!</p><p>Some people sighed, shook their heads, and walked away.</p><p>“Take out your identification and report your information. We will go and verify it. After that, there will be a test. Because there is a limit to the number of Imperial Dragon guards that can be recruited this time, there are too many people who have registered. We can’t take in all of them. Only the strong can stay. Alright, the registration begins now!”</p><p>A burly man said.</p><p>Then, they started to register one by one.</p><p>Lu Ming waited patiently for a full two hours before it was his turn.</p><p>Lu Ming moved his hand and an identity token appeared. He handed it to one of the Imperial Dragon guards.</p><p>This identity token was taken from Ming Lu, it was the identity token of the black spear sect’s disciple.</p><p>“Black spear sect, clear path!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The burly Imperial Dragon Guard checked his identity medallion and registered it. “We’ll send people to verify your identity. If there’s any falsehood in it, you’ll be killed on the spot. Do you understand?”</p><p>The brawny Imperial Dragon Guard’s eyes were cold.</p><p>“Yes, yes, I know!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded continuously.</p><p>yes, wait over there. There will be an assessment later!</p><p>The brawny Imperial Dragon Guard said.</p><p>Lu Ming walked to the side and waited patiently.</p><p>After another two hours, the registration ended. There were more than 2000 people who had signed up.</p><p>“Alright, come with me!”</p><p>At this moment, the spiritual God Realm elder stood up and said indifferently. He then strode inside with Lu Ming and the rest following behind.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at a military camp.</p><p>There was a huge stone tablet in the middle of the camp.</p><p>this stone tablet can test your cultivation. You just have to channel your true Qi into the stone tablet and we will know your cultivation. There are two thousand people who have registered this time, but we only want two hundred people. Therefore, we will only accept those whose cultivation ranks are in the top two hundred. Now, the assessment begins!</p><p>The old man announced.</p><p>After that, the applicants went up to take the test one by one.</p><p>As long as one put their true essence into the stone tablet, the stone tablet would light up. Through the light, one could tell their cultivation level.</p><p>He started testing them one by one. Lu Ming realized that many of them had a cultivation of the first level spirit embryo realm. There were a lot fewer second level spirit embryo realm cultivators and even fewer third level spirit embryo realm cultivators.</p><p>Very soon, it was Lu Ming’s turn.</p><p>“Just in case, I’d better input a little more true Qi!”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>He was only taking in two hundred people. In order to ensure that nothing went wrong, Lu Ming planned to input more essential core.</p><p>He walked to the stone tablet and pressed his hand on it. Lu Ming channeled his essential core.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The stone tablet shook, and seven silver lights flashed.</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>Lu Ming kept his essential core.</p><p>Seven silver rays of light represented the cultivation of the seventh level of the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>This way, it should be foolproof and he would definitely be accepted!</p><p>“Seventh level spirit embryo realm!”</p><p>The spiritual God Realm elder’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Those who came to sign up were usually people from small forces, and their cultivation levels were not too high. Those who had too high a cultivation level would not join the Imperial Dragon guards, and there were not many who had reached the seventh level of the spiritual embryo realm.</p><p>“Hmm, not bad!”</p><p>The spiritual God Realm elder nodded.</p><p>The test continued.</p><p>Not long after, the test was completed. Lu Ming discovered that there were only three people who had reached the seventh level spirit embryo realm and only one person who had reached the eighth level. There was no one who could go higher.</p><p>This made Lu Ming touch his nose. Was his performance too outstanding?</p><p>alright, the test is over. The top 200 will stay in the military camp for the time being and wait for our news in a few days.</p><p>The spirit God elder ordered.</p><p>Those who were not in the top 200 could only sigh and leave.</p><p>Lu Ming and the group were led to their rooms.</p><p>For the next few days, Lu Ming stayed in the military camp. He cultivated while waiting for news.</p><p>Three days later, the news came that Lu Ming had been recruited and had officially become a member of the Imperial Dragon guards.</p><p>the four of you are very good. I have temporarily arranged the positions of Deputy flag for you. If you perform well in the future, it will not be a problem for you to be promoted. Also, the positions you need to guard have been arranged. Someone will inform you in a moment!</p><p>After the spirit God elder finished his announcement, he gave each of them a token that represented the secondary flag.</p><p>The “flag” in the Imperial Dragon Guard meant an official position.</p><p>One banner had five hundred people. The main banner could command five hundred Imperial Dragon guards, and the Deputy banner was not small either.</p><p>This was because their cultivation was profound. No matter where they were, strength was everything.</p><p>Not long after, someone sent Lu Ming the Imperial Dragon Guard’s robe and the news that they would be guarding the position.</p><p>The four of them were naturally separated.</p><p>“The eighth Prince’s guards!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. His temporary duty was to be the eighth Prince’s guard.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with a strange look. From what he knew, the eighth prince was Xie Zhen.</p><p>Wasn’t Xie Zhen the one who took Xie nianqing away from ninedragons?</p><p>what a coincidence. I just happened to ask Xie Zhen about little Qing!</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile.</p><p>There were two hundred people who had joined them, but there were more than thirty people who were grouped with Lu Ming. They were all the eighth Prince’s guards.</p><p>Soon after, a skinny man in his forties came to Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>I am your commander. My name is Shi Fang. From now on, you will follow me. Now, follow me to the eighth Prince’s Mansion!</p><p>The scrawny man swept his gaze across them, especially Lu Ming, and a cold glint flashed across his eyes.</p><p>this Shi Fang seems to be hostile to me, but this is the first time I’ve seen him. Strange!</p><p>Lu Ming frowned slightly and thought to himself.</p><p>The eighth Prince’s Mansion was in the inner city. It was very wide, like a villa, and it was a hundred miles wide.</p><p>These Imperial Dragon guards couldn’t directly enter the eighth Prince’s residence, so they stayed in a military camp outside the residence.</p><p>In the military camp outside the eighth Prince’s residence, Lu Ming and the others gathered. Shi Fang stood on the platform and looked down on everyone with a cold expression.</p><p>“I’ll tell you some things right now. The first and foremost order of the Imperial Dragon Guard is to obey orders and protect the safety of the imperial family with your lives!”</p><p>“Also, let me tell you, the Imperial Dragon Guard is full of experts. Don’t be so proud of your strength. There are many more in the Imperial Dragon Guard who are stronger than you. Any one of them can easily suppress you. Do you understand?”</p><p>After saying that, Shi Fang’s gaze swept across Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
