The dark water mystical snake couldn’t resist the attacks of so many powerful warriors. Its huge body was covered with wounds. Two of them were killed, and their huge bodies floated on the lake.</p><p>...</p><p>The rest of the dark water mystical snakes sank into the lake.</p><p>“The cleansing Water lotus throne is mine!”</p><p>As the Blackwater mystical snake retreated, many people started to go crazy and rushed to the cleansing Water lotus throne.</p><p>you want to obtain the cleansing Water lotus throne? you’re courting death!</p><p>A blue-haired elder bellowed and grabbed with his fingers, tearing apart several eighth and ninth level spirit embryo realm experts and killing them.</p><p>Too powerful. This blue-haired elder’s strength was far above that of an ordinary great circle spirit embryo. He was an expert on the level of an old monster.</p><p>In other directions, there were also such experts who were rushing towards the cleansing Water lotus throne.</p><p>Among them, Yang Cong and Wu Kong were also unrivaled, not any weaker than those old monsters.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming also began to move. His figure was like a stream of light, rushing towards the cleansing Water lotus throne. His speed was extremely fast, leaving many people behind.</p><p>“Stay here!”</p><p>Suddenly, two terrifying attacks were directed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across and realized that the ones who attacked him were two elders. These two elders had the cultivation of a perfected spirit embryo, but they were just ordinary perfected spirit embryos.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted coldly. Devouring power burst out from his left palm and enveloped the two elders. He pointed out two fingers with his right palm and two spearlights appeared, pointing at the two elders.</p><p>“Not good, retreat!”</p><p>Being enveloped by the devouring power, the two old men felt that all the energy in their bodies was being devoured. They could not use their strength at all. At the same time, the two spear lights were extremely terrifying, giving them a fatal threat.</p><p>The two of them bellowed in anger, their eyes flashing with extreme fear. They knew that they had encountered a terrifying heaven’s favorite.</p><p>However, it was too late to retreat now.</p><p>The two spearlights arrived in front of the two of them in an instant.</p><p>“Spare me …”</p><p>The two of them screamed, but the next moment, the spear light pierced through their foreheads.</p><p>The devouring power burst out and devoured the essence of the two elders.</p><p>Lu Ming could kill ordinary perfected spirit embryos with a flip of his hand.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved and he rushed forward at an extremely fast speed. Very soon, he was at the forefront.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>A cold roar was heard, and the terrifying claw radiance was aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate and struck with his palm.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>His palm struck a blue claw. His body only swayed slightly, but the other party was forced to retreat.</p><p>Lu Ming took a look. It was the blue-haired elder, an expert at the level of an old monster.</p><p>At this moment, the elder looked at Lu Ming with a grave expression.</p><p>The old man had not expected a young man to be so powerful.</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at him and did not continue to attack. Instead, he rushed towards the cleansing Water lotus throne.</p><p>There were already people approaching from other directions.</p><p>The blue-haired elder’s expression changed. He didn’t continue to attack and rushed towards the cleansing Water lotus throne.</p><p>A blue Divine Eagle and a golden chakra appeared above his head. He performed the bloodline fusion and turned into a blue Divine Eagle, pouncing toward the cleansing Water lotus throne.</p><p>From all directions, a total of seven figures approached the pristine water lotus throne.</p><p>Yang Cong, Wu Kong, Lu Ming, and four other elders.</p><p>The seven of them were the fastest and approached the cleansing Water lotus throne.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>“You’re the one who’s getting lost. Die!”</p><p>The seven of them exchanged glances, and a great battle suddenly erupted. Terrifying attacks poured towards each other, and a chaotic battle broke out.</p><p>However, everyone intentionally avoided the pristine water lotus throne, and the Qi did not land on it.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The explosions continued, and all kinds of light flew around.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>A blue Divine Eagle pounced at Lu Ming with a terrifying gust of wind.</p><p>It was that blue-haired old man again.</p><p>“Old man, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold. A five-colored light burst forth as he activated the prison suppressing heaven technique and struck out with his palm.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The palm hit the blue godly Hawk and shattered its talons. The blue-haired elder’s figure reappeared. Blood spurted out of his mouth as he quickly retreated with fear in his eyes.</p><p>Then, the terrifying devouring power enveloped him. Lu Ming took a step forward and appeared in front of the blue-haired elder, striking out with his palm.</p><p>“Wait, spare me!”</p><p>The blue-haired elder screamed in horror, but Lu Ming’s palm did not stop and continued to strike.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The blue-haired elder’s body had a huge hole in it, and blood was flowing out from it. However, he was not dead yet, and he wanted to run for his life.</p><p>Now, he couldn’t care less about the cleansing Water lotus throne. All he wanted to do was to escape and escape!</p><p>However, how could Lu Ming let him escape?</p><p>Bang!</p><p>He took a step forward, and the power of the nine Dragons stepping on air exploded. The blue-haired elder screamed in pain, and his four parts were intact.</p><p>Subsequently, Lu Ming devoured all the essence of the blue-haired elder.</p><p>The blue-haired elder had only awakened a first level divine bloodline. How could he be a match for Lu Ming?</p><p>Even though his cultivation level was two levels higher than Lu Ming’s, he was still easily killed.</p><p>Behind him, the other people who were chasing after him were shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming was too terrifying. An old monster-level expert was killed just like that.</p><p>They looked at Lu Ming with fear in their eyes.</p><p>At this moment, the fight for the cleansing Water lotus throne was still going on.</p><p>Yang Cong and Wu Kong joined forces to fight against the three old monsters. They were at a disadvantage.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and approached the pristine water lotus.</p><p>“Lu Shaoqing!”</p><p>Yang Cong’s gaze swept toward Lu Ming with a hint of solemnity.</p><p>Obviously, he already knew that Lu Ming had defeated hai Ziming.</p><p>Hai Ziming’s abilities were not weaker than his. He was not confident that Lu Ming could defeat hai Ziming.</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at the crowd indifferently. He stepped forward and stretched out his palm to grab the cleansing Water lotus throne.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>Wu Kong’s eyes glinted coldly as he thrust the long spear in his hand at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming struck with his palm. Wu Kong’s body trembled and he retreated.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming threw a punch and an old monster retreated while vomiting blood.</p><p>Si si …</p><p>Many people gasped.</p><p>Lu Ming was too powerful. Wu Kong, an expert at the level of an old monster, was easily injured by Lu Ming. No one could stop him.</p><p>“You’d better not court death!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes swept across the group. The old monsters, Yang Cong, and Wu Kong all had ugly expressions on their faces.</p><p>“Lu Shaoqing, you may be strong, but there are so many of us here. We don’t have to be afraid of you!”</p><p>Wu Kong said.</p><p>At this time, many experts had appeared in all directions. However, they were watching from afar and did not dare to get close.</p><p>“You guys can try!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“Yang Cong, Wu Kong, I suggest that we join hands and defeat this man. Then, we will seize the platform with our own abilities. Otherwise, we will not get anything if this man takes the platform!”</p><p>One of the old monsters said.</p><p>“Alright, I agree!”</p><p>Wu Kong nodded.</p><p>Yang Cong frowned. He did not want to offend a prodigy like Lu Ming unless it was absolutely necessary.</p><p>“Yang Cong, what about you?”</p><p>Wu Kong looked at Yang Cong.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
