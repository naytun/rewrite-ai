Shi Fang’s elder brother was a first level spiritual God Realm expert and the eighth Prince’s personal guard. If Lu Ming dared to lay a hand on him, he would be courting death.</p><p>Moreover, he had learned a rather powerful martial arts technique from his brother. He was also quite talented. Even if Lu Ming’s cultivation was one level higher than his, he was not afraid to fight him.</p><p>Lu Ming did not answer Shi Fang. Instead, he stood up and walked toward Shi Fang. three breaths have passed. It seems like I have to do it myself and throw you out!</p><p>How dare you! You really dare to attack me! Everyone, let’s attack together and suppress this person!</p><p>die! Shi Fang shouted angrily. His aura burst out and he charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Beside Shi Fang, the other three also made their moves. Their auras erupted, and they were actually all at the sixth level spirit embryo realm.</p><p>These few people were the strongest in this banner, and they usually followed Shi Fang’s lead.</p><p>The four of them joined forces and their momentum was not weak. However, in Lu Ming’s eyes, they were no different from children playing house.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming kicked.</p><p>The moment this kick was kicked, it turned into four leg shadows.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>All the attacks of Shi Fang and the other three turned into bubbles under Lu Ming’s feet. The soles of Lu Ming’s feet were imprinted on their faces.</p><p>With four screams, Shi Fang and the other three were sent flying out of the yard like four cannonballs. Their screams echoed in the night sky, and then they flew further and further away.</p><p>There was still the skinny monkey-like middle-aged man who hadn’t left. At this moment, his eyes were almost popping out of their sockets. His entire body was trembling non-stop, and his face was pale. He was scared.</p><p>He did not expect Lu Ming to be so bold that he even dared to hit Shi Fang.</p><p>Most importantly, he did not expect that Lu Ming not only dared to fight, but his combat strength was also so strong. He sent Shi Fang and the other three flying with one kick.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s cultivation was one level higher than Shi Fang’s group of four, Shi Fang’s group had four people, yet they were unable to put up any resistance. It could be seen that Lu Ming’s combat strength was stronger than an ordinary seventh level spirit embryo realm.</p><p>At this moment, he looked at Lu Ming in fear.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming berated.</p><p>“Yes, yes, I’ll get lost now!”</p><p>The skinny monkey-like middle-aged man turned around and was about to leave.</p><p>“I told you to get lost, not to leave!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>The skinny monkey-like middle-aged man’s face was pale.</p><p>“It seems like I have to do it myself!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold.</p><p>“Don’t!”</p><p>The skinny monkey-like middle-aged man was so scared that he almost peed his pants. He could only lie on the ground in humiliation and roll out of the courtyard. Then, he got up and ran away.</p><p>“This … Vice-commander, I’m afraid he won’t let you off the hook for offending Shi Fang!”</p><p>Sun Lin was full of worry.</p><p>He was not worried about Lu Ming. He was afraid that he would be implicated by Lu Ming.</p><p>“What are you afraid of?”</p><p>Lu Ming said casually and went back to his room to cultivate.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, many bottles, Jade boxes, and iron boxes appeared in the room. There were more than a hundred of them, all of which he had obtained from the Saint mansion in the secret realm.</p><p>Lu Ming did not check it previously. Now was the perfect time to check it.</p><p>“This is a spirit refining pill!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed when he saw the Jade bottles.</p><p>Those Jade bottles were actually spirit refining pills.</p><p>The spirit refining pill was made from the main ingredients of the spirit refining fruit. If it was frequently consumed by a perfected spirit embryo, it could greatly increase the chances of breaking through to the spirit God Realm. If a spirit God powerhouse consumed it, it could condense the spirit God and strengthen their spiritual consciousness.</p><p>There were dozens of Jade bottles here, all of which were filled with spirit refining pills.</p><p>There were nine pills in each Jade bottle, and there were at least a few hundred spirit refining pills in there.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming looked at other things.</p><p>Many of the others were elixirs, very precious elixirs, and most of them were not inferior to the spirit refining elixir.</p><p>There were also various precious materials that Lu Ming could not name. He kept them away.</p><p>Finally, with a thought, a small fiery red Pagoda appeared.</p><p>An Emperor spiritual weapon!</p><p>As soon as the fiery red Tower appeared, it trembled slightly as if it was about to leave. However, Lu Ming’s essential core spread out and enveloped the small tower.</p><p>if I refine an Emperor weapon, it will definitely increase my strength. However, it won’t be that easy. With my current cultivation, even if I refine it, I won’t be able to unleash much of its power. I’ll wait until I have some free time to refine it!</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming kept the small Pagoda.</p><p>Then, he took out the spirit refinement elixir and refined it to condense his spirit soul.</p><p>Time slowly passed. Tonight, there was no movement. The next day, during the day, there was also no movement.</p><p>On the second night, Lu Ming made his move.</p><p>He asked dandan to inscribe an array that could conceal his aura for him, and his body cut through the void like a ghost, heading towards the eighth prince Xie Zhen’s mansion.</p><p>Lu Ming planned to enter Xie Zhen’s residence to see if he could find out anything about Xie nianqing.</p><p>The eighth Prince’s residence was naturally guarded by the Imperial Dragon guards. However, with Lu Ming’s current cultivation and the aura-concealing formation that he had set up, the Imperial Dragon guards could not detect him at all.</p><p>The eighth Prince’s Mansion was huge, with many palaces and pavilions.</p><p>Lu Ming spread out his spiritual sense to check his surroundings. After a while, his eyes lit up. He moved and appeared above a Palace. He scanned the area with his spiritual sense and the situation below the palace was imprinted in his mind. It was clearer than what he could see with his eyes. This was the wonder of spiritual sense.</p><p>Below, in a room, two figures were discussing something.</p><p>One of them was Shi Fang, and the other was in his 50s. He was burly and looked quite dignified.</p><p>big brother, you have to avenge me. That new Deputy is so arrogant that he even dared to hit me. He’s obviously not giving you face!</p><p>Shi Fang cried.</p><p>This burly man in his fifties was the eighth Prince’s personal bodyguard, a first level spiritual God Realm expert.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s current cultivation was at the second level of the spiritual God Realm. The spiritual God he cultivated was very powerful, and his spiritual consciousness was powerful. How could the other party discover him?</p><p>alright, I know about this. This Ming Lu is really bold. However, I’m a spiritual God Realm expert and the eighth Prince’s personal guard. If I attack him directly, I’m afraid I will be criticized by the others. How about this, I have a way to get rid of him!</p><p>Having said that, Shi Fang’s elder brother began to use voice transmission. Lu Ming could not hear the rest.</p><p>“Hehe, I’d like to see how you’re going to get rid of me.”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. Then, he left the place in search of the eighth Prince’s residence.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming finally found the eighth prince in the depths of the mansion.</p><p>The eighth prince was indeed Xie Zhen. After not seeing him for a few years, Xie Zhen had matured a little, and his cultivation had also become much stronger.</p><p>At this moment, Xie Zhen was high up in the air, sitting on top of a large hall. Below him, a few people were kneeling there, reporting to him.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Xie Zhen suddenly slammed the table and shouted coldly, ” “What? They failed again, what a bunch of trash!”</p><p>eighth prince, although the sixteenth Princess is in the abyss Demon Realm, her talent is too high, and her cultivation progress is too terrifying. All the people we sent were killed by her!</p><p>One of them answered.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
