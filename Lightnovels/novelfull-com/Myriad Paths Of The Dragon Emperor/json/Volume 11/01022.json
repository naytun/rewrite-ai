He did not say a word when he came in but Huang Kui came to him of his own accord.</p><p>“Huang Kui, brother Lu has the qualifications to enter this place!”</p><p>Chu Kuang said with a sullen face.</p><p>“Haha, qualified? Do you think I’m qualified because you said so? Then anyone can bring people in, are there still rules?” Huang Kui sneered and then looked at goddess Tan Xiang, fairy, I suggest that we drive this person out …</p><p>However, before Huang Kui could finish his sentence, goddess Tan Xiang raised her hand and interrupted him,”Brother Huang, you don’t have to say anything. I know brother Lu. He is qualified to enter this place!”</p><p>The clear voice spread throughout the entire area, causing many people’s eyes to move in surprise.</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang actually knew this young man surnamed Lu? Where did this person come from? Was he also a third-grade heaven’s favorite? Then why hadn’t he seen it in the battle of Providence?</p><p>Many questions appeared in everyone’s mind.</p><p>Huang Kui’s face froze on the spot before it turned red. He was extremely embarrassed.</p><p>Previously, he had berated Lu Ming loudly, saying that he was a piece of trash and that he was not qualified. However, the next moment, fairy Tan Xiang directly said that she knew Lu Ming and that Lu Ming was qualified. This was equivalent to slapping his face in front of everyone.</p><p>His heart was burning with anger, and he was very dissatisfied with fairy Tan Xiang, but he did not dare to show it.</p><p>“It’s all Chu Kuang’s fault, and this brat’s fault!”</p><p>Not daring to be displeased with goddess Tan Xiang, Huang Kui could only direct his anger towards Lu Ming and Chu Kuang. He picked up his wine glass and took a sip, his eyes cold.</p><p>Chu Kuang and Zhang Wenjin were also stunned. Fairy Tan Xiang knew Lu Ming? Could it be that Lu Ming and fairy Tan Xiang were old acquaintances?</p><p>Everyone had their own thoughts. Even Lu Ming’s expression changed slightly.</p><p>“Don’t tell me he recognized me!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but think.</p><p>“Brother Lu, please take a seat!”</p><p>Tan Xiang waved her hand and smiled sweetly as she pointed to their table.</p><p>This time, the scene was in an uproar, and everyone’s face changed.</p><p>“What? Fairy Tan Xiang asked this Lu guy to sit at the table above. That table is reserved for second-grade heaven’s favorites. Does this Lu guy have the right to sit there?”</p><p>“How is that possible? How many second-grade heaven’s favorites are there? I didn’t even see him in the battle of Providence, so how could he be a second-grade prodigy?”</p><p>“Then why did fairy Tan Xiang ask him to take the seat of honor?”</p><p>Many third-class heaven’s favorites were discussing in low voices.</p><p>However, everyone had a suspicious look in their eyes.</p><p>Even Jing kongling, Yin BUPO, junyue, and the others ‘expressions changed slightly as they sized Lu Ming up curiously.</p><p>Chu Kuang and Zhang Wenjin’s expressions were even more interesting.</p><p>Lu Ming himself was also a little stunned.</p><p>“Brother Lu, please!”</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang invited again.</p><p>“Alright. Lu Shaoqing thanks the fairy!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and stepped forward without hesitation.</p><p>this kid really went up. He really dares to go up? ”</p><p>does he really think he can stand shoulder to shoulder with a second-grade heaven’s pride? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s actions caused a wave of soft discussions.</p><p>“This kid …”</p><p>Huang Kui’s expression turned even uglier.</p><p>Lu Ming did not care about the gazes from the surrounding people. He stepped forward. He was now certain that sandalwood had recognized him. Since she had recognized him, he could only face it. At most, he would just compensate her with those spirit herbs.</p><p>“Brat, get down. This is not a place you can come up!”</p><p>Just as Lu Ming walked up to the pavilion, a cold voice rang in his ears. It was transmitted and no one else could hear it.</p><p>Lu Ming raised his eyebrows and looked at a person.</p><p>Blood Luo Zi!</p><p>The words just now were clearly said by blood Luo Zi.</p><p>At this moment, blood Luo Zi stared at Lu Ming with an unfriendly gaze.</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. He did not look at blood Luo Zi anymore. He continued to walk to the table in the pavilion and sat down on an empty chair.</p><p>He completely ignored Xue Luo Zi, which made Xue Luo Zi’s expression turn ugly. A wisp of killing intent flashed in his eyes.</p><p>Jing kongling, junyue, and the rest were also sizing Lu Ming up curiously.</p><p>it’s almost time. Let’s not wait any longer. Serve the wine now!</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang’s voice rang out. She then clapped her hands lightly, and a few young women brought out pots of wine.</p><p>In front of each of them was a small pot of wine.</p><p>the first wine to be served is called ‘heart-burning flame’. Everyone, please have a taste!</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang said in a sweet voice.</p><p>As soon as fairy Tan Xiang finished speaking, some people impatiently poured wine and drank it all.</p><p>Lu Ming poured himself a cup as well. When the wine was poured into the cup, a layer of flame seemed to appear on the surface of the wine and dance in the cup.</p><p>“What a wonderful wine!”</p><p>Lu Ming praised him in his heart. He then picked up the cup and drank it in one go.</p><p>When the wine entered his mouth, it was rich and sweet, but when it flowed down his throat and into his stomach, it was like a flame, burning fiercely.</p><p>In particular, there was a stream of heat flowing into his heart. Lu Ming felt as if his heart was on fire but he did not feel any pain. Instead, he felt warm and extremely comfortable.</p><p>“This wine can also burn and condense true essence!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly lit up. He realized that his essential core had become more solid.</p><p>“Good wine!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but pour himself another cup and finish it.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming poured a few glasses of wine and finished the pot of wine in no time.</p><p>Lu Ming licked his lips, looking as if he had not had enough.</p><p>It was the same for the others. Even some women who didn’t like alcohol had finished it all.</p><p>good wine, burning heart. The wine is indeed as good as its name!</p><p>A young man in white beside Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>This person was the peerless genius of Tianxia Academy, Kong Xin.</p><p>“It’s indeed good wine!”</p><p>Junyue also sighed in admiration. A demonic light flashed on his body and his aura was overbearing.</p><p>“It’s good that everyone likes it. My little sister’s efforts were not in vain. Next, I’ll invite everyone to taste the second wine!”</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang chuckled and then clapped her hands. Another young woman brought up a pot of wine, and everyone still had a pot.</p><p>“This wine is called the spirit cleansing dew!” Fairy Tan Xiang introduced.</p><p>With the intense flames burning heart wine from before, many people were no longer in a hurry and began to drink.</p><p>Lu Ming poured a cup and drank it in one go.</p><p>The feeling that this wine gave was completely different from the previous raging flames burning heart wine. As soon as this wine entered his stomach, a cold feeling spread throughout his body and finally gathered in his mind. At that moment, Lu Ming felt that his mind was extremely clear and his thoughts were active. It was several times stronger than usual.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He sensed the intent realm of the earth carefully and realized that his speed of comprehension of the intent realm had increased by several times.</p><p>This kind of wine could actually improve a warrior’s comprehension ability. Of course, this was only temporary. The wine had been mixed with elixirs. Once the medicinal effect wore off, the effect would naturally disappear.</p><p>However, it was already shocking enough. If he took it for a long time, his cultivation speed would definitely increase greatly.</p><p>One cup after another, and very quickly, another pot of wine was finished.</p><p>After that, goddess Tan Xiang ordered people to bring out a few more types of wine. Each type of wine had a different effect, and they were not simple wine. Each type of wine was refined from spirit herbs and wine. They had different flavors, and it was very satisfying.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
