The light from the door of seals also had a sealing effect, and Xue Feng had no way of escaping.</p><p>...</p><p>His body was enveloped by the light of the gate of sealing, and he could not help but freeze.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was like a flickering light and a fleeting shadow as he rushed towards Xue Feng.</p><p>The blood leopard that blood seal had transformed into roared in anger. Blood light gushed out like a volcanic eruption and attacked the sealing door.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming was even faster. The Blood Sword pierced through the air and pierced through the blood leopard’s body in an instant.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The blood leopard let out a deafening roar and destroyed the gate of seal. It clawed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. In a hurry, he struck out with his palm, clashing with the blood leopard’s claw.</p><p>With a loud boom, Lu Ming’s body was sent flying thousands of meters away. His qi and blood churned and he almost spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>The blood-sealed true essence was too strong. The moment Lu Ming stabbed him, it broke through the sealing door and launched a counterattack.</p><p>However, the blood leopard that Xuefeng had transformed into was stabbed by Lu Ming’s sword. It was definitely not in a good state. At this moment, he shouted angrily and did not dare to continue fighting. Instead, he turned around and ran.</p><p>Lu Ming did not pursue him. With his current cultivation level and the nine seals of the divine Gate, he could indeed injure Xue Feng by catching him off guard. However, it was almost impossible to kill him.</p><p>If Xue Feng risked his life, Lu Ming would not have it easy.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Xue Feng had disappeared.</p><p>As for Wu chengkong, he had already sneaked away before Xue Feng escaped.</p><p>As for the Dragon Carp, he did not dare to take it. If he continued to stay, he would definitely be killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>On the other side, the middle-aged man of the Ji family’s expression changed, but in the end, he sighed and turned to leave.</p><p>His combat ability was only on par with Wu chengkong. He would be courting death if he stayed.</p><p>In an instant, only Lu Ming, fairy Tan Xiang, and Kong Xin were left in the sky above the lake.</p><p>brother Lu, why did you change your appearance? even your aura has changed. It’s making us suffer!</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang said with a smile.</p><p>“There are some people I just don’t want to see. Fairy, please forgive me!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Lu Ming then looked at the three Dragon carps in the lake and said, ” “Do the two of you need Dragon carps too?”</p><p>“This time, it’s all thanks to brother Lu. Otherwise, when Xue Feng arrived, brother Kong and I would not have gotten anything. These three Dragon carps naturally belong to brother Lu!”</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang said.</p><p>you’re too kind, fairy. I only need two. You can take the other one!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and landed on the surface of the lake. He cast the nine seals of the gate of God and a sealing door appeared. The three Dragon carps were instantly immobilized. Then, his vital essence condensed into a huge hand and scooped the three Dragon carps up.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, two of the Dragon carps disappeared and were kept by Lu Ming into a small lake in the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>To refine the Nirvana elixir, only the true blood of the dragon Carp was needed. They did not have to kill the Dragon Carp, so two Dragon carps were enough. More would not be of much use.</p><p>There was no harm in giving the other one to fairy Tan Xiang.</p><p>“Many thanks, brother Lu!”</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang revealed a look of joy. She was an Alchemist, and this Dragon Carp was indeed of great use to her.</p><p>After putting it away, fairy Tan Xiang was about to say something when her expression suddenly froze. She revealed a look of surprise and widened her eyes as she looked ahead.</p><p>Beside him, Kong Xin was the same. She seemed to have seen something extremely shocking.</p><p>Lu Ming was a little surprised. He turned around and the next moment, his eyes widened.</p><p>In front of them, at an unknown distance away, there was a Grand Palace that appeared from the void. Clouds and mist lingered around it, making it look like a Celestial Palace.</p><p>It was extremely huge, but it was filled with the vicissitudes of life, as if it had transcended countless years.</p><p>It seemed both real and illusionary. From a distance, it didn’t look real, like an illusion.</p><p>what Palace is this? it clearly wasn’t there just now!</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. There was nothing there just now. Why did an ancient palace suddenly appear?</p><p>“The Holy mansion, it’s the Holy mansion!”</p><p>Kong Xin muttered to himself, his eyes filled with excitement.</p><p>“Holy mansion?”</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang and Lu Ming were both very surprised.</p><p>This secret realm was called the Saint mansion secret realm, but Lu Ming had never known what it meant. He did not expect that there was really a Saint mansion.</p><p>yes, according to the ancient records of our Tianxia Academy, there is a Saint mansion in this secret realm. There is a Supreme existence in it, and it is said that he has surpassed the Emperor.</p><p>Kong Xin said word by word. Her eyes were filled with excitement, as if she was a Saint.</p><p>“An existence that surpasses the Emperor level!”</p><p>Lu Ming and tan Xiang gasped in shock.</p><p>In the divine wilderness continent, emperors were the strongest.</p><p>In the eyes of all cultivators, an Emperor was already a Supreme existence. Their combat power was all over the world. With one palm, they could split the sky and crack the earth. They could penetrate the earth and pierce through the sky. It was terrifying beyond compare.</p><p>The ultimate goal of all cultivators was to become an Emperor and dominate the world.</p><p>But now, there was actually a figure who was above Emperor here? How could it not be shocking?</p><p>“Is this true or false?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>Kong Xin shook her head and said, ” I don’t know, but that’s what the ancient books said. And the ancient books said that the Saint mansion rarely appeared. Even when the emperors could enter this place freely, no one had ever seen it. It had always been a legend. Now it has really appeared. It’s incredible!</p><p>Kong Xin sighed repeatedly and was very excited. Then, she revealed many secrets.</p><p>It was said that there was an existence beyond the Emperor level living in this Saint mansion. If someone obtained the token of the Saint mansion, they could enter the Saint mansion with it and obtain great opportunities. They could even have the chance to obtain the inheritance of that existence.</p><p>The token of the Saint mansion was in the secret realm.</p><p>it’s said that the Saint mansion’s Secret realm has existed for hundreds of thousands of years. Even those who have surpassed the Emperor realm can’t live for hundreds of thousands of years, right? ”</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang asked with some doubts.</p><p>The higher one’s cultivation was, the longer one’s lifespan would be.</p><p>It was already very heaven-defying for an Emperor to live for 10000 to 20000 years. It was equivalent to a hundred lives for mortals. They could sit and watch the world change, just like a living historical record.</p><p>As for existences that surpassed emperors, no matter how powerful they were, they couldn’t possibly live for hundreds of thousands of years. That was too shocking and unbelievable.</p><p>Unless it was a God in the legends. It was said that gods could exist together with heaven and earth and would never be destroyed, but that was only a legend.</p><p>“I’m not too sure about this!”</p><p>Kong Xin shook her head.</p><p>Even so, their eyes were filled with flames.</p><p>An existence that had surpassed the Emperor realm. This was too shocking. Once one reached that realm, they would definitely be able to see through the heavens and earth. It was unimaginable. If it was true, they would be able to obtain something that would benefit them endlessly.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>Right at this moment, a series of long howls resounded through the earth. It was extremely shocking.</p><p>OWW!</p><p>The three of them saw a huge Silver Wolf appear on a mountain in the distance. It howled at the sky, and its aura was shocking like a tsunami. With one step, the mountain collapsed. The Silver Wolf broke through the sky and flew in the direction of the Saint mansion.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>In the sky, a mountain was moving. At a closer look, it was a giant snake. It slithered across the sky and headed for the Saint mansion.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The earth rumbled and trembled. A few people saw a giant ape as tall as a mountain not far away. It stomped on the ground, cracking the earth and shaking the mountains.</p><p>In front of the giant ape, a martial artist could not Dodge in time and was slapped to death by the giant ape.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
