The contents were simply too tragic to gamble. They did not look like the storage rings of martial artists at the fourth level of the spirit embryo realm and above.</p><p>...</p><p>At the sight of Lu Ming’s dumbfounded look, the Gorilla Man and the rest looked embarrassed.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, all the storage rings flew back into the hands of the black Gorilla Man and the others.</p><p>“Get up, stop pretending to be dead!”</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze across the room and said coldly.</p><p>Lu Ming had not hit them hard just now. He had only temporarily scattered their essential core. It was not a big deal.</p><p>No matter what, Lu Ming was now the commander of these people. He could not just kill them the moment he came.</p><p>Only then did the black Gorilla Man and the others get up from the ground.</p><p>“Commander’s battle prowess is profound, this subordinate is truly in admiration!”</p><p>As soon as he got up, the black Gorilla Man revealed a simple and honest smile, which was completely different from the wild and violent expression he had earlier.</p><p>that’s right, that’s right. The commander’s cultivation is unparalleled. He was able to take care of us in a few moves. This is the first time this subordinate has seen something like this in all my years of life.</p><p>The white-haired old man also flattered.</p><p>“The commander is invincible!”</p><p>“The commander is mighty!”</p><p>The other law-enforcement officers were also flattering him. Lu Ming’s eyelids were twitching. He was rather speechless. Who were these people?</p><p>Just now, she wanted to Rob him, but now she changed her face so quickly.</p><p>“Why are you so poor? There isn’t even a single raw gemstone in the storage ring?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>“AI! Our law enforcement Army is so hard!”</p><p>“Commander, it’s like this …”</p><p>The crowd chimed in and explained to Lu Ming.</p><p>After listening to the story, Lu Ming fell into deep thought.</p><p>The law enforcement Army’s days were worse than what Sun Lin had said.</p><p>The law enforcement Army had to enforce the law in the sacred city and protect the dignity of the ancient Saint dynasty.</p><p>But now that the ancient Saint dynasty was on the decline, even though it was still a dominant power, or even the strongest dominant power, it was still just a dominant power. It no longer had the strength to rule the world. Hence, when it did things, it had to be careful and maintain a good relationship with the other powers.</p><p>Therefore, when the people of the big forces committed a crime, the law-enforcement Army did not dare to really arrest and punish them, but they had to protect the face of the imperial family. What could they do?</p><p>Therefore, most of the time, the law enforcement Army could only pay out of their own pocket to give gifts to the disciples of the major forces and those who had committed crimes, asking them to do a good deed and apologize in public. In this way, the law enforcement Army would naturally protect the face of the royal family, and the people who had committed the crime would admit their mistakes. The matter would be resolved just like that.</p><p>However, they paid for it out of their own pockets. As time passed, it would be strange if the law enforcement Army was not poor. It was no wonder that they wanted to Rob Lu Ming the moment they saw him as a newcomer.</p><p>Lu Ming was really quite speechless. The law enforcement Army was too cowardly. The person who had committed the crime was fine, but they had to give the other party benefits. This was simply unheard of.</p><p>the law enforcement Army is used to enforce the law in the world on behalf of the ancient Saint dynasty. Unfortunately, the ancient Saint dynasty no longer has the power to do so. In fact, the law enforcement Army could have been disbanded a long time ago, but the royal family has kept it for the sake of their dignity. However, no one is willing to come here. Usually, only those who have offended some big shots will be sent here!</p><p>The white-haired old man sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming finally knew why Xie Zhen had transferred him to the law enforcement Army, and as a commander at that.</p><p>It was getting closer and closer to the million-year National sacrifice. People from all the major forces had gathered. It was a period of trouble. If things went wrong, Lu Ming would offend someone and he would not even know how he died.</p><p>Moreover, as a commander, the responsibility he had to bear was naturally greater.</p><p>“Xie Zhen, if you want to play, then have fun!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile. He waved his hand and a storage ring flew towards the black Gorilla Man. “Here are ten thousand orirocks, use them to buy some fine wine and delicacies. Since we’re new here, I’ll treat everyone to a good meal. As for the excess, you can each buy a spirit weapon!”</p><p>These people were so poor that they had even sold their own spirit weapons.</p><p>“Ten thousand raw gemstones?”</p><p>The black Gorilla Man received it, he was stunned at first, then he was overjoyed, saying: “Your subordinate thanks the commander.”</p><p>The others were overjoyed as well. They thanked Lu Ming and then went to buy fine wine, delicacies, and spirit weapons in joy.</p><p>The fine wine and delicacies that martial artists ate were different from ordinary people. They were all from powerful fierce beasts and demonic beasts. The wine was also spirit wine. They were all very expensive.</p><p>Half a day later, the burly black Gorilla Man and the rest brought back a large amount of fine wine and delicacies. The 80 to 90 people were divided into several tables and ate to their hearts ‘content. It had been a long time since they had such a good meal and they were quite grateful to Lu Ming.</p><p>Everyone ate and drank as they chatted.</p><p>Through the chat, Lu Ming learned that these people had offended important figures and were sent here.</p><p>They had families and friends in the holy city, but they couldn’t escape. They could only suffer in the law enforcement Army.</p><p>Everyone ate and drank for a few hours.</p><p>not good! Someone destroyed a shop on North Street and killed the shopkeeper. He’s still there!</p><p>Suddenly, a law enforcement soldier rushed in to report the news.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Who did this!”</p><p>“This is troublesome, something has happened again!”</p><p>The expressions of the black Gorilla Man and the others changed.</p><p>What they were most afraid of was something happening, because if something happened, they could deal with some unknown people and directly take them down. However, if it was some big figure, they would be in trouble.</p><p>“It’s the young master of the Huang family, Huang Ke!”</p><p>The messenger said.</p><p>“What? The Huang family is a family with many spiritual gods. What should we do?”</p><p>The expressions of the black Gorilla Man and the others changed.</p><p>They could not afford to offend any force that had a spiritual God. Otherwise, the other party’s spiritual God powerhouse could directly find their superiors and put pressure on them.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming picked up a glass of wine and finished it. He strode out.</p><p>“You, you, you, we’ll go together!”</p><p>The Gorilla Man picked more than ten people and followed Lu Ming out of the law enforcement Hall.</p><p>Their law enforcement Hall was in the northeast of the holy city. It was very close to North Street and would be there in a short while.</p><p>On the way, Lu Ming also knew what was going on!</p><p>The Huang family’s young master, Huang Ke, had his eyes on a treasure in a shop, but there were no raw gemstones. He said that he would owe the shop and take the treasure first.</p><p>Those who knew Huang Ke well knew that he had never returned anything he owed.</p><p>The shopkeeper naturally didn’t agree, so Huang Ke killed the shopkeeper, destroyed the shop, and even wanted to kill the shopkeeper’s entire family.</p><p>The moment he arrived, he heard an arrogant voice.</p><p>“F * ck, I’m giving you face, but you don’t want it. I said I’ll owe you first, so I’ll owe you first. It’s not like I won’t pay you back, so why are you still not agreeing? You’re looking for death, who can you blame?”</p><p>An arrogant voice sounded.</p><p>“Get lost! If you don’t get lost, I’ll kill you too!”</p><p>A deep voice rang out. It must have been Huang Ke’s servant.</p><p>“Move aside, move aside, the law enforcement Army is handling this matter, move aside!”</p><p>The black Gorilla Man roared and the crowd made way for Lu Ming to walk over.</p><p>A white-haired old man was lying on the ground, no longer breathing.</p><p>Beside the old man’s corpse stood a young man in luxurious clothes. His eyes were cold and his face was cold and arrogant.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
