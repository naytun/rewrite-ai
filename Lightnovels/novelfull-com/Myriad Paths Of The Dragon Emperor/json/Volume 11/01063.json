It was indeed because of the quota for the marrow cleansing pool.</p><p>These people really treated him as a soft persimmon.</p><p>Jing kongling had the floating mountain sect behind him, and yang potian was someone they didn’t dare to offend. The Emperor God had displayed great combat strength, and the Emperor heaven divine Palace was behind him. They didn’t even look for him, but instead, they looked for him.</p><p>There was no doubt that Lu Ming, this person who had suddenly appeared, had become highly sought after.</p><p>“Idiot!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not bother with Wu chengkong. He took a step forward and, like a stream of light, arrived at the nature Jade wall in an instant. He continued to look for the corresponding Jade wall to comprehend.</p><p>Wu chengkong’s eyes were sharp and cold as he looked in the direction where Lu Ming had left.</p><p>Lu Ming was very displeased. If these guys continued to pester him, Lu Ming did not mind using thunderous means to teach them a lesson.</p><p>He continued to search for jade pieces. Not long after, Lu Ming found a Jade piece with a profound Thunder concept and studied it in detail.</p><p>Time flowed like water. Half a month had passed since Lu Ming passed through the tianxu cave.</p><p>At this moment, someone came to inform Lu Ming that the marrow cleansing pool had been opened and he could enter.</p><p>Lu Ming followed the person and flew over many mountains. They came to a small hill.</p><p>When he arrived, he realized that Jing kongling, di Shen, and yang potian had already arrived.</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming, Qing Junling smiled. The divine Emperor sized Lu Ming up curiously. Yang potian, on the other hand, had his hands behind his back and did not even look at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Alright, open the marrow cleansing pool!”</p><p>There were a few white-haired old men here. The mental energy fire between their eyebrows jumped and runes appeared, entering the hill.</p><p>Ka ka!</p><p>The hill split open, revealing an ancient bluestone road that led to the front.</p><p>go, the marrow cleansing pool is just ahead. You only have three days. Once the three days are up, you must come out!</p><p>An old man reminded, and everyone nodded.</p><p>Yang potian took the lead and walked towards the ancient bluestone road.</p><p>After that, di Shen, Jing kongling, and Lu Ming stepped onto the ancient road and moved forward.</p><p>After stepping on the ancient road, a place full of spiritual Qi appeared in front of them. On the ground, there were nine pools, which were covered with a faint mist, like nine celestial pools.</p><p>This was the marrow cleansing pool. Lu Ming was secretly shocked. He did not expect that there would be nine marrow cleansing pools.</p><p>However, the area wasn’t large. Each bite was only a few meters in radius.</p><p>The four of them each chose one and walked over, stepping into the marrow cleansing pool one after another.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming stepped into the marrow cleansing pool, he immediately felt a mysterious power in the surroundings that continuously drilled into his body.</p><p>It was the pool water. It was the power transformed from the pool water.</p><p>The water in the marrow cleansing pool had a mysterious power. Of course, it was not just the water. The entire marrow cleansing pool had a field energy that aided the water to permeate every part of Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming could feel that his physical body was improving rapidly.</p><p>Initially, Lu Ming’s physical body had already reached the ninth rank. At this moment, he was constantly climbing toward the peak of the ninth rank.</p><p>“It’s so comfortable!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>Originally, cleansing one’s meridians and marrow was an extremely painful thing. However, there was no pain at all here. Instead, he felt comfortable all over.</p><p>Lu Ming could clearly feel that the impurities and dirt in his body were being cleared by a kind of wonderful energy. It made his body purer and dustless.</p><p>Time passed by quickly.</p><p>Three days passed just like that.</p><p>Huala!</p><p>Lu Ming rushed to the marrow cleansing pool with a burning gaze.</p><p>“So good!”</p><p>Lu Ming felt refreshed and his body was empty.</p><p>Right now, his body was simply perfect with perfect lines. His body seemed to be made of stainless divine gold, powerful and pure.</p><p>complete grade nine, complete complete grade. Is this the limit of the physical body? ”</p><p>Lu Ming felt it carefully and his face was filled with joy.</p><p>He had a feeling that his physical body had reached perfection and had reached a limit. It was impossible for him to improve it any further.</p><p>If it continued to rise, it would no longer be a mortal body, but a whole new level.</p><p>Jing kongling, di Shen, yang potian, and the others also came out of the marrow cleansing pool with smiles on their faces. Obviously, they had also gained a great harvest.</p><p>Yang potian was the first to step out, and then the others came out of the marrow cleansing pool one after another.</p><p>Outside, a few old men were still waiting. When they came out, the old men carved inscriptions and the hill returned to its original state.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>It was at this moment that nine pillars of light shot up into the sky in the distance. The heavens and earth shook, and it was extremely shocking.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>Everyone looked in that direction in shock, because that was where the myriad elephant Jade wall was.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>“This … Could this be the Holy mansion? The Holy mansion has opened!”</p><p>A few elders from the Tianxia Academy were excited and their voices trembled.</p><p>“Holy mansion?”</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were shocked.</p><p>It was said that the ten thousand elephant Jade wall had a great secret. It was connected to a divine Treasury and a secret realm. It was very mysterious.</p><p>Thirty thousand years ago, that divine Treasury could still be opened occasionally, and Supreme experts would enter to cultivate and comprehend the Dao. It contained great opportunities.</p><p>However, 30,000 years ago, a terrifying war broke out in the central continent. There was a rebellion in the ancient Saint dynasty. That war directly weakened the power of the ancient Saint dynasty’s Xie clan, and the central continent was split up by the various emperors.</p><p>In that battle, the world’s Academies were also seriously affected. In the end, even the method to open the divine Treasury was lost. From then on, no one had ever opened the divine Treasury and the Saint mansion.</p><p>Could it be that it had opened again?</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Without any hesitation, Lu Ming and the rest rose into the air and flew in the direction of the myriad elephant Jade wall.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming saw beams of rainbow light flying out from the huge white jade Palace in the sky.</p><p>Beams of light flew out from all the peaks of the Tianxia Academy toward the Wanxiang Jade wall.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming and the group arrived.</p><p>At this moment, all of the Wanxiang Jade walls glowed, and inscriptions emerged. They gathered into nine huge pillars of light that shot into the sky.</p><p>Outside the nine pillars of light, there were countless figures standing.</p><p>Apparently, the heroes who were meditating on the myriad elephant Jade wall had been expelled for some reason.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming arrived, a little turtle leaped onto his shoulder.</p><p>“Dandan, what’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to dandan.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, how is it? I’ve deciphered the secret of this place and activated the formation!”</p><p>Dandan sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming smugly.</p><p>“You did it?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little speechless. In fact, he had already guessed that it might be because of dandan. He did not expect that it was really dandan who did it.</p><p>“This place is connected to a secret realm. It’s amazing!”</p><p>Dandan sighed.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>at this moment, more and more people appeared in the air. Some of the elders were exuding terrifying auras.</p><p>“Supreme martial artists! There are so many Supreme martial artists!”</p><p>Lu Ming was all too familiar with this aura. It was the aura of a Supreme.</p><p>Some of them were martial arts Supreme Masters, while others were inscription Dao Supreme Masters. There were no less than ten of them.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
