The others were also surprised.</p><p>...</p><p>Some of the third-class prodigies looked at Lu Ming in surprise.</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang had actually invited Lu Ming to stay behind and have a drink with her. What was the meaning of this?</p><p>Could it be that fairy Tan Xiang had taken a fancy to Lu Ming?</p><p>At the thought of this, many young men stared at Lu Ming with burning eyes, full of envy, jealousy, and hatred.</p><p>However, Lu Ming groaned in his heart. Most likely, he would ask about the stealing of the medicine.</p><p>haha, brother Lu, Wenjin and I will take our leave!</p><p>Chu Kuang cupped his fists at Lu Ming and fairy Tan Xiang. He blinked his eyes at Lu Ming with great admiration.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He did not want to stay.</p><p>Soon, everyone had left, leaving only Lu Ming and fairy Tan Xiang.</p><p>“Brother Lu, you don’t look very willing. Is sandalwood that unattractive? Why is brother Lu in such a hurry to leave?”</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang chuckled and blinked her eyes at Lu Ming.</p><p>ahem, you’re too kind. Fairy Tan Xiang’s beauty is unparalleled in the world. It’s my honor to be able to stay and drink alone with you. I’m afraid many people would be envious of me!</p><p>Lu Ming coughed twice and smiled.</p><p>“Brother Lu, please!”</p><p>With a wave of her hand, fairy Tan Xiang and Lu Ming took their seats.</p><p>“Brother Lu, I’ve never seen you before. May I know which force you come from?”</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang poured Lu Ming a glass of wine and asked curiously.</p><p>I’m not from any major power. I’ve followed master since I was young and cultivated in the deep mountains. It wasn’t until recently that I’ve gained some cultivation, and master let me out of the mountains.</p><p>Lu Ming made up a story.</p><p>“Oh, really? Then your master must be an expert whose name is known throughout the world, or else he wouldn’t be able to teach such an outstanding disciple!”</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang asked tentatively. Then, she picked up the wine cup and took a sip. Her beautiful eyes glimmered as she looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang’s face was slightly pale, but she had a gentle beauty to her. It made people want to protect her and not lie to her. It made people have the urge to tell her all their secrets.</p><p>At this moment, they were alone. Facing such a beauty, Lu Ming could not help but feel a rush of excitement.</p><p>He secretly took a deep breath and suppressed the fluttering in his heart, calming himself down.</p><p>Central continent’s five great beauties, they truly lived up to their reputation.</p><p>“Fairy, master’s name is taboo. He told me not to tell anyone. Please forgive me. I’ll drink a cup as punishment!”</p><p>Lu Ming picked up the glass and drank it in one go.</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang chuckled and continued to pour wine for Lu Ming without asking further.</p><p>After that, fairy Tan Xiang and Lu Ming drank and chatted casually, but they did not mention anything about the herb theft that day.</p><p>After a while, Lu Ming could not help but say, fairy, the spiritual medicine incident that day was caused by my pet. It was my fault for not disciplining him well. I will definitely compensate you in full in the future!</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang smiled and said, ” it’s just some spirit herbs, not worth mentioning. Brother Lu, you can take them. There’s no need to compensate me. That’s not what I’m curious about. If I’m not wrong, brother Lu doesn’t have any mental energy fire at all, but you can move freely in my formation. I’m very curious about this. How did you do it? ”</p><p>haha, luck, that’s all luck. That day, I was just randomly walking around!</p><p>Lu Ming laughed and continued to make up nonsense.</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang seemed to be dissatisfied with Lu Ming’s answer and rolled her eyes at him. It was a coy and resentful look that made Lu Ming’s heart throb a few times.</p><p>In front of such a beauty, in front of such a gaze, how many people could remain as calm as water?</p><p>Unless he was not a man, Lu Ming was a normal man.</p><p>However, fairy Tan Xiang did not probe further. Everyone had their own secrets. Since Lu Ming did not want to talk about it, it would not be good to probe further.</p><p>The two of them chatted for a while more before Lu Ming bade farewell to fairy Tan Xiang.</p><p>“Brother Lu, if you have time, you can come to the valley of the medicine Masters to find me!”</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang said.</p><p>“Definitely!”</p><p>Lu Ming bid farewell with cupped fists and left the alchemy division.</p><p>After leaving the alchemy division, Lu Ming heaved a long sigh of relief.</p><p>Although goddess sandalwood looked weak, she gave off a lot of pressure. Lu Ming could sense that her martial arts cultivation was very low, but her mental energy fire was extremely terrifying, surging like the ocean.</p><p>The pressure that goddess Tan Xiang gave off was even stronger than that of master Xue Luo and Yin BUPO.</p><p>I’m afraid that fairy Tan Xiang has lit ten mental lamps at perfection. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have such a strong pressure!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered to himself. Although he had defeated blood Luo Zi, he did not dare to underestimate the other talents.</p><p>Those who could become second-grade geniuses all had the potential to become emperors. None of them could be underestimated.</p><p>Moreover, even if they were all second-grade heaven’s favorites, there were still some who were stronger and some who were weaker.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head to get rid of the distracting thoughts. He returned to the inn and saw Chu Kuang and Zhang Wenjin.</p><p>“Brother Lu, we plan to go back to the floating mountain to cultivate in seclusion for a while. What about you? Where do you plan to go?”</p><p>Chu Kuang asked.</p><p>I plan to travel and cultivate while heading to the ancient Saint dynasty!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>hmm, take care, brother Lu. We’ll meet again if there’s a chance!</p><p>Chu Kuang, Zheng Wenjing, and Lu Ming bade their farewells and left.</p><p>Not long after Chu Kuang and Zhang Wenjin left, Lu Ming left the city of dan and headed west.</p><p>After leaving the city of pills, Lu Ming rose into the air and left in an instant.</p><p>However, after flying for tens of thousands of miles, Lu Ming frowned and stopped.</p><p>Ever since he left the pill city, he felt that someone was following him.</p><p>“Who is it? Come out!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze turned to the back.</p><p>“Hehe, you have sharp senses!”</p><p>With a sneer, two figures stepped through the air and appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>cold-blood Hall, spiritual God expert!</p><p>Lu Ming raised his eyebrows and his eyes looked grave.</p><p>They were two middle-aged burly men. One was bald and the other had a big beard. They were dressed in blood-red robes. Most importantly, Lu Ming could not see through their auras at all. They were definitely not spirit embryo realm martial artists but spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Cold-blood Hall actually had two spiritual God Realm experts following him.</p><p>“You want to take revenge for blood Luo Zi?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked. The vital essence in his body began to circulate. He did not dare to be careless in the face of spiritual God Realm powerhouses. Moreover, there were two of them.</p><p>hehe, it’s one thing to avenge young master Xue Luo. Also, young master Xue Luo said that you’ve mastered a secret technique that has a powerful devouring power. Hand over the secret technique, and perhaps you’ll die a quick death!</p><p>The bald man sneered.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. It turned out that blood Luo Zi had taken a fancy to his devouring technique.</p><p>It was true. The bloodthirsty technique of cold-blood Hall was similar to the devouring technique of the nine Dragons, but the effect was very different. Naturally, master Xue Luo was tempted.</p><p>“It’s not that easy to kill me!”</p><p>There was a flash of madness in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>“Oh, really? You’re really confident. However, no matter how much of a genius you are, you’re only at the spirit embryo realm. Now, I’ll let you see the difference between the spirit embryo realm and the spiritual God Realm!”</p><p>The bald man’s eyes glowed with ferocity, then he said to the bearded brawny man, ” “I’ll attack, and you’ll hold the line, how about it?”</p><p>“Sure!”</p><p>With that, the bearded man’s figure flashed and he appeared behind Lu Ming, blocking Lu Ming’s retreat.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
