Buzzzzzz!</p><p>...</p><p>Around him, blood-red light flew out and floated in the air.</p><p>In a few breaths, experts in blood-red robes appeared from all directions, staring at Lu Ming and the others with cold eyes.</p><p>They were all cold-blood Hall experts, some of whom had terrifying auras.</p><p>“Experts, there are so many spiritual god level experts. Just the spiritual god level experts alone, there are more than twenty of them!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed. There were so many experts from cold-blood Hall here.</p><p>A few cold-blood Hall experts stood in the sky. They were the leaders of the cold-blood Hall.</p><p>we’ve taken control of all the teleportation formations of the surrounding forces. The person who stole the treasure must be in a hurry to leave. This is his chance. He must be among this group of people!</p><p>A white-haired old man said.</p><p>that’s right. It’s dangerous to stay in cold-blood Hall’s territory. He must be in a hurry to leave. He can’t use the teleportation formation, so he can only fly. There must be someone we’re looking for among this group of people. Check, every one of them!</p><p>A burly man said coldly. Then, he took a step forward and a terrifying aura burst out from his body, shrouding Lu Ming and the nearly ten thousand people under his aura.</p><p>Senior of cold-blood Hall, why are you stopping us? ”</p><p>Someone asked loudly.</p><p>yeah, we didn’t offend anyone from cold-blood Hall!</p><p>Another person added.</p><p>there are people among you that cold-blood Hall needs, so we can only stop you all!</p><p>The burly man said.</p><p>“Is there someone you are looking for? Do you have any special characteristics? can we help?”</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>I don’t know. We don’t know what characteristics they have, not even their gender. That’s why we’re keeping all of you here!</p><p>The burly man said.</p><p>Everyone looked at each other. They didn’t even know if it was a man or a woman, so how could they find him?</p><p>The burly man sneered, ” this man has taken an important treasure of cold-blood Hall. It’s simple. You just have to hand over all your storage rings!</p><p>“What? You want us to hand over our storage rings? no way!”</p><p>Someone refused.</p><p>If he handed over his storage ring, could he get it back?</p><p>Furthermore, which martial artist did not have secrets? There were many secrets in the storage ring, who would want to hand them over?</p><p>“Today, I have to hand it over even if I don’t want to!”</p><p>The burly man’s eyes turned cold.</p><p>cold-blood Hall is too arrogant. You are not the only Overlord force in the central continent. Don’t go too far!</p><p>Someone said coldly.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>The burly man’s eyes suddenly turned cold, and a blood-red spear appeared in his hand. The next moment, the blood-red spear pierced through the void like a blood-red lightning bolt, stabbing toward one of the old ou’s. The old ou’s face turned pale with fright, and his aura skyrocketed as he frantically retreated.</p><p>However, it was useless. The blood-red spear pierced through the old man and killed him on the plain.</p><p>Si si …</p><p>Many people gasped. Old ou’s aura was extremely terrifying. He was in the first level of the spiritual God Realm, but he was still killed by the burly man’s blood spear. It was truly terrifying.</p><p>how dare you question cold-blood Hall? you’re courting death!</p><p>The burly man coldly said.</p><p>Many people kept quiet out of fear and broke out in cold sweat.</p><p>Cold-blood Hall was too domineering. They could even kill spiritual God Realm beings. This was the Overlord force.</p><p>The spiritual gods of some small forces were like ants in their eyes. They could kill them if they wanted to.</p><p>“If you don’t hand over your storage ring, you’ll die!”</p><p>The burly man said coldly, his eyes sweeping over the person closest to him.</p><p>“I’ll pay, I’ll pay!”</p><p>Those who were scanned by the burly man’s eyes had a change in expression. They could only take off their storage rings and hand them over.</p><p>In the crowd, Lu Ming frowned. That burly man was too strong. He was definitely not at the first level of the spiritual God Realm. He was most likely at the third level or even the fourth level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>In the spiritual God Realm, the gap between each level was huge. It was not too difficult for a higher level to kill a lower level, let alone a few levels higher.</p><p>let’s go! Cold-blood Hall only has a few hundred people, but we have tens of thousands of people. Let’s go together!</p><p>“That’s right, storage rings are all we Warriors have. If we hand them over, how can we cultivate in the future? At worst, we’ll just fight!”</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>Roars suddenly came from the crowd, and some people began to charge in all directions.</p><p>With someone leading the way, the crowd instantly became chaotic and exploded. No one wanted to hand over their storage rings. Seeing others breaking out of the encirclement, many people also followed.</p><p>Tens of thousands of people broke out in all directions, and the plain was in chaos.</p><p>“Courting death, kill, kill without mercy!”</p><p>The burly man roared with a violent killing intent.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The cold-blood Hall experts released powerful auras and released beams of blood-red light.</p><p>There were more than twenty spirit God experts. The others were all at the high level of the spirit embryo realm, and there were even quite a number of old monsters.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Beams of blood-red light formed sword gleams, saber gleams, and fist forces that shot towards Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Instantly, miserable screams rang out. Hundreds of people were killed in an instant, and their corpses scattered on the ground.</p><p>A Spear’s gleam was aimed at Lu Ming. Lu Ming threw a punch and shattered the Spear’s gleam. His figure flashed and he rushed towards the mountain range on his left.</p><p>Only by rushing into the mountain range could he avoid the experts of cold-blood Hall with the help of the complicated terrain and the fierce beasts in the mountain range. If he ran to either side of the plain, he would definitely be caught and killed.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>One of the experts had his eyes on Lu Ming. Blood-red light flashed in his hands, forming a spear ray that stabbed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming used his body movement technique and dodged the Spear’s radiance. He ran at top speed.</p><p>“Aaah!”</p><p>The plains were completely drowned out by screams. A large number of corpses fell, and blood filled the air.</p><p>“Haha, devour!”</p><p>Some cold-blood Hall experts used the bloodthirsty technique to swallow the thick blood Qi.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In cold-blood Hall, there were a few extremely terrifying Masters, such as the burly man and the two elders. Their auras were explosive, and with a wave of their hands, the sky and earth shook. Under the cover of their palm prints, a large number of experts were killed.</p><p>There were a few spiritual God powerhouses in Lu Ming’s group. However, they were no match for them and they fell one by one.</p><p>“I’ll hand it over, I’ll hand over my storage ring!”</p><p>Someone was scared and shouted to hand over his storage ring.</p><p>However, there were also people who continued to attack, not wanting to hand over their storage rings.</p><p>young master Lu, save me!</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was charging forward, he suddenly heard a cry. He turned his gaze and was slightly stunned.</p><p>Zhou Xin. He saw Zhou Xin.</p><p>At this moment, Zhou Xin was in an extremely sorry state. She was also running with all her might in an attempt to escape.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming pulled Zhou Xin and they moved forward at top speed.</p><p>“Stay here!”</p><p>An old man had his eyes on the two of them. A terrifying aura erupted as he charged toward the two of them.</p><p>This elder’s aura was even stronger than an ordinary first level spiritual God Realm. He should be an expert in the second level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Lu Ming pulled Zhou Xin along and used the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps to run at high speed. His body was like a stream of light, but he was carrying someone and his speed was affected. The elder caught up with him very quickly.</p><p>The old man threw a punch and a blood-red fist force was sent flying towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Along the way, someone tried to stop him, but he was directly smashed into dust by the fist force.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
