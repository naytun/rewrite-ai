He circulated the true war Dragon technique and the majestic energy was constantly converted into Lu Ming’s essential core at an unbelievable speed. It did not require much refining.</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation level increased rapidly.</p><p>In just a few minutes, all the energy in the sky Vermillion fruit had been refined.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation had broken through to the middle stage of the ninth level spirit embryo realm in one go and was still rising. This was even more majestic and robust than the energy Lu Ming had devoured from dozens of martial artists at the perfected spirit embryo realm.</p><p>this sky Vermillion fruit is indeed wondrous. It can actually be refined so quickly!</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly amazed.</p><p>He surmised that even an ordinary martial artist would not need much time to refine the sky Vermillion fruit.</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out Another Sky Vermillion fruit and began to refine it.</p><p>His cultivation base rose like a rocket.</p><p>The sky Vermillion fruit was a rare treasure. It was too difficult to cultivate it. Its survival rate was extremely low, and the chances of it bearing fruit were also extremely low. Furthermore, a sky Vermillion fruit tree would not bear many fruits.</p><p>Therefore, the sky Vermillion fruit was almost impossible to buy and could not be seen outside.</p><p>Its effects were too good, and even if a major force nurtured it, it was simply not enough.</p><p>This ancient medicine garden had been sealed for a long time, and there was only one tree left. Now, it was destroyed.</p><p>As he continued to refine, Lu Ming’s cultivation level continued to soar.</p><p>After refining four sky Vermillion fruits, Lu Ming’s cultivation level rose to the perfected ninth level of the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>Next, he began to strive for the great circle of the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>I’m cultivating the true war Dragon technique and the Super spirit sea secret technique, so my Zhen Yuan is much stronger than ordinary people. Four sky Vermillion fruits might not be enough for me to break through to the great circle of the spirit embryo realm!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart and his eyes could not help but glance at dandan who was not far away.</p><p>Dandan was lying on a cloud with her legs crossed, nibbling on a stalk of spirit medicine while looking up at the sky. She was very relaxed and satisfied.</p><p>As if sensing something, dandan turned to look at Lu Ming. Seeing that Lu Ming was looking at him ‘greedily’, he shivered and said, ” “Kid, what are you trying to do?”</p><p>“Dandan, lend me those seven sky Vermillion fruits of yours!”</p><p>Lu Ming gave a ‘friendly’ smile.</p><p>“Lend it to you? I’m not lending it to you. If I lend it to you, can you still return it?”</p><p>Dandan shouted.</p><p>“You’re really not going to lend it to me?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s face darkened and he started to turn hostile.</p><p>“I won’t!” Dandan gritted her teeth.</p><p>alright, if we find any spiritual herbs in the future, don’t even think about getting a single one. They’ll all be mine!</p><p>Lu Ming snorted coldly.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Dandan glared angrily, her eyes rolling. Finally, she gritted her teeth and said, ” here, here, I’ll give you all of them. But I’ll definitely get more of the other spirit herbs in the future!</p><p>“Yes! Happy cooperation!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled again.</p><p>“How treacherous!”</p><p>Dandan sighed speechlessly and gave the last seven sky Vermillion fruits to Lu Ming.</p><p>There were eleven sky Vermillion fruits in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>“It should be enough!”</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The nine Dragons appeared. With a long roar, they swallowed all 11 sky Vermillion fruits and began to refine them to break through to the next realm.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The vast and surging energy surged unceasingly, rapidly transforming into essential core and began to help Lu Ming break through to the next realm.</p><p>Endless true essence gathered in the spirit embryo in his dantian and transformed into purer true essence, which gushed out of the spirit embryo. During this process, the spirit embryo became more and more solid, and its volume became smaller and smaller.</p><p>“It’s not enough, just a little more!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to refine the energy of the sky Vermillion fruit. Half an hour later, the energy of all 11 sky Vermillion fruits had been refined and transformed into a terrifying essential core that ran through Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the end, something seemed to have been broken. The aura on Lu Ming’s body suddenly soared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming opened his eyes and two beams of light shot out. They travelled hundreds of miles and pierced through a mountain.</p><p>“Great circle of spirit embryo!”</p><p>A faint smile appeared on Lu Ming’s face.</p><p>He had finally reached the great circle of the spirit embryo realm. The next step would be to prepare to break through to the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>However, it was not that easy to break through to the spiritual God Realm. It was not something that could be achieved by devouring a huge amount of energy.</p><p>Spiritual God, spiritual God, it was the spiritual God being nurtured in the spirit embryo. Not only did it require the intent to break through to the fourth level, but it also required one’s consciousness and soul to merge into the spiritual God.</p><p>In the end, the spirit embryo shattered, and the spirit God appeared.</p><p>Moreover, when the spiritual God appeared, there would be a lightning tribulation from the sky. One had to go through the terrifying lightning tribulation before they could officially step into the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>There was a Heavenly Tribulation when one broke through to the martial King realm and condensed the intent runes. There was also a Heavenly Tribulation when one broke through to the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Moreover, its power was extremely terrifying. Many people were turned into ashes by the heavenly Tribulation at this final step.</p><p>Lu Ming closed his eyes and looked into his body. He realized that the spirit embryo in his dantian was extremely solid. It was crystal clear and looked like a crystal.</p><p>It was also very small, only the size of a watermelon, and there was a vigorous life force emanating from it, as if it was giving birth to a God.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Lu Ming opened his eyes and let out a long breath.</p><p>“If I were to meet venerable chikui now, I could kill him if I used my full power!”</p><p>Feeling the vast essential core in his body, Lu Ming revealed a confident smile.</p><p>From the early stage of the ninth level spirit embryo realm to the perfected spirit embryo realm, his essential core had increased by too much. Lu Ming’s combat strength had also increased by several times.</p><p>“Haha, dandan, I’ll go out and find more spirit herbs for you!”</p><p>Lu Ming was in a good mood after the breakthrough in his cultivation. He moved and exited the mountain and river diagram. He then broke through the mountain and appeared outside the mountain peak.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming had just appeared outside the mountain peak when a terrifying pressure came from above his head. A blood-red axe crossed the distance of ten thousand meters in an instant and slashed down violently at Lu Ming.</p><p>This was a surprise attack without any warning. Lu Ming did not expect to be attacked the moment he left the mountain.</p><p>If Lu Ming had not broken through, he might have been seriously injured by this attack.</p><p>But now-</p><p>With a thought, the mountain and river diagram appeared and covered his entire body. At the same time, a vast amount of true core strength exploded and he punched upwards.</p><p>Even though he was caught off guard and used his vital essence at the last minute, the power of this punch was still extremely terrifying. It collided with the bloody axe with a huge boom. Most of the power of the bloody axe was offset, and the remaining power was blocked by the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled and he fell. Just as he was about to land on the ground, Lu Ming stepped on the branch of a big tree with the tip of his foot and soared into the sky again. He glared coldly at the person who had ambushed him.</p><p>The bald man from cold-blood Hall.</p><p>At this moment, the bald burly man was a little surprised. He did not expect that Lu Ming would be able to receive his surprise attack unscathed. His expression was a little grave.</p><p>“You … Did you make a breakthrough in your cultivation?”</p><p>The bald man’s expression changed drastically when he sensed Lu Ming’s aura.</p><p>Previously, when Lu Ming’s cultivation was at the early stage of the ninth level spirit embryo realm, his combat strength was already extremely shocking. Now that he had broken through to the perfected spirit embryo realm, how strong would Lu Ming’s combat strength be?</p><p>The bald burly man’s heart was incomparably heavy. Moreover, he was also in disbelief.</p><p>It had only been a few days. Previously, Lu Ming’s cultivation was at the early stage of the ninth level spirit embryo realm. How could he have broken through to the perfected spirit embryo realm in just a few days? this speed was too terrifying!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
