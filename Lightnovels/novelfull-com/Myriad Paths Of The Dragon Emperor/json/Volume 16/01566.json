This small mountain village actually has so much Phoenix incense wood!</p><p>Lu Ming felt rather emotional.</p><p>...</p><p>There were faint patterns on the wood. It looked like a phoenix. It was a very precious spirit wood, Phoenix incense wood.</p><p>The Phoenix incense wood would emit a faint fragrance. Martial cultivators often carried it with them. It could calm one’s heart and prevent inner demons from forming. It was very helpful for cultivation comprehension.</p><p>Although it couldn’t be compared to the path-understanding ancient tree, it was still a very precious treasure.</p><p>This small village actually had a lot of such spiritual wood. Some villagers even used it to make some furniture. It could be said to be extravagant.</p><p>As a Carpenter, Lu Ming had collected quite a lot of Phoenix incense wood. He carved them into statues, accessories, and other items, planning to give them to his friends and family in the future. They would be of great help to his cultivation.</p><p>the one year period is almost up. In a few days, I should leave and return to Dragon God Valley!</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>He liked his life in this small mountain village very much. It was a memorable day, but he had to leave in the end. He didn’t belong here.</p><p>After nearly a year, Lu Ming had completely erased the killing intent in the depths of his soul. Now, his eyes were warm and pure, like a clear spring.</p><p>In the past year, he had never deliberately cultivated.</p><p>However, his cultivation base was still slowly rising.</p><p>Now, his cultivation had reached the peak of the sixth level martial Royal realm, and his chaotic domain had also reached the peak of the sixth level.</p><p>This year, he did not deliberately try to comprehend the chaos Domain, but it was not like he did not gain anything.</p><p>He felt that he was in perfect harmony with heaven and earth.</p><p>As for the chaos realm, it was also comprehended from nature. He felt that as long as he spent some time, he would be able to upgrade the chaos realm to Level Seven. Moreover, because of his compatibility with nature, he would definitely be able to comprehend the chaos realm faster than before.</p><p>“Little brother Lu, Lingling, it’s time to eat!”</p><p>A slightly aged voice sounded.</p><p>It was the voice of the village chief, Grandpa Feng Ling.</p><p>“I’m coming, Grandpa!”</p><p>Feng Ling responded and pulled Lu Ming. big brother Lu, let’s go and eat. Grandpa has prepared a few bottles of good wine today!</p><p>Lu Ming put away Xie nianqing’s statue and followed Feng Ling into the village chief’s small courtyard.</p><p>“Little girl, you want to drink again?”</p><p>A white-haired old man in his 60s looked at Feng Ling kindly and scolded her with a smile.</p><p>“Grandpa, I’ll just drink a little, just a little!”</p><p>Feng Ling ran in front of the old man, pulled his arm, and shook it hard.</p><p>“Good, good, you little girl!”</p><p>The old man patted Feng Ling’s little head lovingly.</p><p>The three of them sat down, and the village chief poured three cups of wine for them to eat and drink.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Right at this moment, a bird’s cry rang out from the distance, reverberating through the entire world.</p><p>The three of them couldn’t help but look towards the North.</p><p>it’s calling again. The Phoenix is calling again. It’s been half a month. I’m afraid this area will not be peaceful anymore!</p><p>The village chief sighed.</p><p>“Grandpa, is there really a divine Phoenix in the heavenly wind Plains?”</p><p>Feng Ling asked curiously.</p><p>“That’s right, according to the ancient legends, there is indeed a divine Phoenix in the heavenly wind Plains!”</p><p>The village chief said.</p><p>“Grandpa, why do I hear the Phoenix cry like it’s wailing in pain and despair?”</p><p>Feng Ling said.</p><p>I feel the same way. I don’t know what happened. I hope nothing happened!</p><p>The village chief sighed, seemingly deeply worried.</p><p>“A divine bird Phoenix?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was also directed to the North. He frowned slightly.</p><p>The heavenly wind Plains was one of the six forbidden areas of the Cang region, and this small village was not far from the heavenly wind Plains. According to the village chief, the Phoenix incense wood was blown out from the heavenly wind Plains.</p><p>However, since half a month ago, the cries of phoenixes could be heard from time to time in the heavenly wind Plains. They were filled with despair and unwillingness.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the northern sky, a few rainbows flashed.</p><p>finally, a martial arts powerhouse has been attracted here!</p><p>The village chief sighed as he also saw the rainbow lights.</p><p>Soon, the three of them finished eating and drinking, and night fell.</p><p>In the night sky, Lu Ming stood in mid-air, looking into the North.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>In the northern sky, rainbow lights would flash across the sky from time to time like meteors. Each rainbow light was a martial arts master.</p><p>Lu Ming took a look and returned to the wooden house to rest.</p><p>In the next few days, the cries of phoenixes continued to ring out, and more and more experts arrived.</p><p>They could even see groups of powerhouses whistling through the sky.</p><p>The Phoenix had been chirping non-stop for half a month, so there must be something unusual. When the nearby experts heard the news, they would naturally dare to come and check.</p><p>On the morning of the third day, Lu Ming rose into the air and flew North.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming arrived at the outskirts of the breezy Plains.</p><p>It was a spectacular sight to see the heavenly wind Plains from high up in the sky.</p><p>The heavenly wind plain was filled with endless gales. Tornadoes as large as mountain ranges were howling in the heavenly wind plain, moving and breaking through the sky.</p><p>There were countless giant tornadoes in the vast skygale plain. These tornadoes were so terrifying that even a Saint would be cut into pieces if he were to enter.</p><p>There had been many saints who had wanted to go in and explore, but they had all died inside. That was why the heavenly wind Plains was known as one of the six forbidden areas of the Cang state.</p><p>However, the strange thing was that the tornadoes seemed to only move within a certain range and would not leave that range. The area outside the breezy Plains was very calm, as if they were in two different worlds.</p><p>Outside the heavenly wind plain, many people were standing in the air, looking at the plain, but no one dared to enter.</p><p>“The people from the desire poison sect and the heaven God sect!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>He discovered that among the experts who came here, the Yu Du sect and the Tian Shen sect had the most people.</p><p>This was also within reason. The Yu Du sect and the Tian Shen sect were located in the Western part of the Cang region and were the closest to this place. Naturally, the number of people who rushed here was the highest.</p><p>There were also some scattered experts from small forces.</p><p>At that moment, some uninvited guests arrived in the small mountain village.</p><p>These were a few burly men who were floating above the village chief’s wooden house. Their expressions were haughty, and their powerful auras enveloped the village chief and Feng Ling, causing their bodies to feel as if they were being pressed down by a huge mountain.</p><p>From their clothes, they were obviously from the Tian Shen sect.</p><p>“Old man, I’ll ask you a few questions. Answer me honestly!”</p><p>A middle-aged man with cold and arrogant eyes looked down at the village chief and said in a commanding tone.</p><p>“Yes, yes, milords, if there’s anything you want to ask, just ask. This old man will definitely tell you everything he knows!”</p><p>The village chief hurriedly bowed and nodded.</p><p>The village chief had lived for a long time, so he naturally knew how to deal with people. These people had strong cultivation, and they were at least at the Martial Emperor realm. Although their small village also cultivated, the village chief had the strongest cultivation, and he was only at the spiritual God Realm. In front of these emperors, the village chief naturally had to be respectful.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
