It would be perfect if Lu Ming could counterattack appropriately and injure the ancient ape God.</p><p>...</p><p>This way, he would be able to easily defeat the ancient ape God and win.</p><p>However, the ancient divine ape was not good at speed. Although its attack was strong, it could not hit Lu Ming at all.</p><p>“Don’t run!”</p><p>The ancient divine ape bellowed in rage. It kept smashing and sweeping its iron rod, but it could not hit Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming did not care and focused on devouring the refined raw stone.</p><p>“Junior Brother Lu Ming, good luck!”</p><p>In the Dragon God Valley grandstand, Tian Chui and Xue ningxin were cheering for Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming will definitely win!”</p><p>The disciples of Dragon God Valley also shouted.</p><p>Now, they were getting closer and closer to the final victory. Most of the Dragon God Valley disciples hoped that Lu Ming would win the final victory. It had been many years since the Dragon God Valley had won first place in the small treasure settlement.</p><p>Of course, there were a few people who did not wish for Lu Ming to win.</p><p>They were the people of Silver Dragon Valley and he Yu.</p><p>being smashed down by the ancient divine ape, it’s best to be smashed to death!</p><p>He Yu’s eyes widened as he stared at the fighting ring. He did not wish for Lu Ming to win. Instead, he hoped that Lu Ming would be defeated or even killed by the ancient divine ape.</p><p>The disciples of Silver Dragon Valley had the same idea.</p><p>Unfortunately, they were destined to be disappointed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s movement technique was extremely fast. The ancient giant ape was not good at speed. No matter how he attacked, Lu Ming could always Dodge.</p><p>Just like that, the fight went on for more than ten minutes.</p><p>no, this can’t go on. What’s the point of Lu Ming dodging? just declare him the loser!</p><p>“That’s right, are we going to continue like this?”</p><p>The people of the demon Castle started to shout.</p><p>Hmph, there’s no rule in the treasure auction that states that you can’t Dodge. Movement techniques are also a type of combat power!</p><p>The people of Dragon God Valley sneered in response.</p><p>“If this continues, when will it end? Three days? five days? “It’s impossible for Lu Ming to absorb the origin stone to recover his essential core during the competition. The origin Qi that he absorbs and refines is not as much as the consumption of his movement technique. If this goes on, the competition will not end even after ten days to half a month!”</p><p>The man from the demon Castle retorted.</p><p>The people from Dragon God Valley looked cold and didn’t say anything.</p><p>Indeed, if this went on, he didn’t know when it would end. Moreover, the speed of absorbing raw gemstones during the competition wouldn’t be that fast. It couldn’t go on like this.</p><p>“Who said three to five days?”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s figure stopped. His faint voice was heard. Then, a Dragon’s Roar was heard and he threw a punch.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s fist collided with the ancient divine ape’s metal rod and blocked the attack.</p><p>“You’re not running?”</p><p>Many people were stunned.</p><p>“If you don’t run, then you’ll be defeated!”</p><p>The ancient divine ape roared angrily and continued to swing its iron rod at Lu Ming. It was even more powerful than before.</p><p>“You’re the one who’s defeated!”</p><p>Lu Ming formed a seal with both hands and a huge chaos sky-turning seal appeared above the ancient divine ape’s head and pressed down on it.</p><p>“It’s that move again. How is it possible? Didn’t he use up all his true essence? How is it possible that he can use it again?”</p><p>impossible! How can he absorb the raw gemstones so quickly? ”</p><p>Many people shouted in disbelief.</p><p>How could they know the wonders of the devouring power?</p><p>The devouring power devoured and refined the rough stone at an astonishing speed. Although it had only been a short ten minutes, it was enough for Lu Ming to recover by a large margin.</p><p>It was enough to use 50 – 60% of the power of the chaos sky-turning seal a few times.</p><p>The primal Chaos sky-turning seal pressed down. That kind of pressure made the ancient divine ape’s heart palpitate.</p><p>He could not be bothered to attack Lu Ming. He swung the metal rod upwards.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The huge iron rod struck the chaos sky-turning seal, making a violent boom.</p><p>The ancient divine ape roared in anger and its huge body shook violently. It kept retreating and stomped on the ground, causing the ground to rumble.</p><p>The ancient divine ape’s arm trembled non-stop and it almost lost its grip on the metal rod. Blood flowed continuously from its mouth.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sky trembled, and another chaos sky-turning stamp was formed.</p><p>“I admit defeat!”</p><p>The ancient divine ape roared and its body shrank rapidly as it ran out of the fighting ring.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and waved his hand. The chaos sky-turning seal in the sky dissipated.</p><p>The ancient divine ape rushed down the fighting ring.</p><p>There was no need to fight anymore. Lu Ming could condense two chaos sky-turning seals in a row. He knew that he was bound to lose. Therefore, he might as well admit defeat.</p><p>Another person!</p><p>Lu Ming had lost another person. In addition to the three he had killed, there were already nine top-notch geniuses who had lost to Lu Ming.</p><p>And the last one, ten people.</p><p>“Come, let’s decide the victor!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze landed on the last person, the heaven seat’s prodigy.</p><p>The heaven seat King’s Paragon stepped onto the fighting ring and looked at Lu Ming with a grave expression.</p><p>“Lu Ming, although you’ve absorbed some raw gemstones just now, you haven’t recovered much, have you? how many more moves can you make with that kind of attack?”</p><p>The heaven seat king’s elite spoke, testing Lu Ming.</p><p>“Try it and you’ll know!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Of course we have to try!”</p><p>The eyes of the heaven seat King gleamed with battle intent as his body began to turn golden.</p><p>There was only one last battle left. It was impossible for the heaven seat’s Paragon to give up. Perhaps Lu Ming really did not have much essential core left. He only needed to withstand a few moves to defeat Lu Ming.</p><p>He had to take a gamble and fight with all his might.</p><p>“Heavenly King’s world destruction!”</p><p>The heaven seat King’s Paragon’s body turned golden, just like the young man in purple-gold armor. His body swelled up, but the color was different. A huge golden sword appeared in his hand and he charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>At that moment, a chaos sky-turning seal appeared in Lu Ming’s hand.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The primal Chaos sky-turning stamp flew out and collided with the heaven seat King’s Paragon.</p><p>Amidst the golden light, the heaven seat King’s Paragon was sent flying. The golden light around him dimmed as he spat out blood.</p><p>One move and he was injured!</p><p>However, the heaven seat King didn’t give up and continued to charge forward.</p><p>He was betting that Lu Ming’s essential core was about to be exhausted.</p><p>However, to his despair, another chaos sky-turning seal immediately appeared in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This time, the heaven seat King’s Paragon was even more injured. Many of his bones were broken, and his body shrank again. His aura was much weaker.</p><p>However, there was still a hint of stubbornness in his eyes.</p><p>He didn’t want to give up like this.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the sky, another huge chaos sky-turning stamp condensed.</p><p>“I’ve lost!”</p><p>At this moment, the heaven seat King’s Paragon spoke helplessly. He knew that he could not win. He would definitely die from Lu Ming’s move.</p><p>He struggled to get out of the fighting ring.</p><p>Lu Ming looked on indifferently. The chaos sky-turning seal did not bombard him.</p><p>After the youth from the heaven seat King rushed down the fighting ring, Lu Ming waved his hand and the chaos sky-turning seal disappeared.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a long sigh of relief. He had finally won. In fact, he did not have much vital essence left in his body.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
