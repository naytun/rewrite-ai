The earth shook, and more than 20 demons rushed out all of a sudden. They were all at the half-Saint level, and some were equivalent to the second stage of half-Saint.</p><p>...</p><p>However, regardless of whether they were at the first stage or the second stage of the half-Saint realm, they were all killed by the noble young man in one move.</p><p>This person’s battle prowess was too strong, reaching a shocking level.</p><p>With the help of the bubbles, Lu Ming dodged the attacks of the demons and continued to venture deeper into the valley.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>An earth-shaking roar was heard as a beam of demonic Qi shot up into the sky.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Heavy footsteps were heard as a huge creature walked out of the valley.</p><p>It was a demonic bear that was a hundred meters tall. It was like a small mountain, and with every step it took, the ground would rumble.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The demonic bear roared, and the wind howled. Terrifying saintly might filled the air.</p><p>Saint realm!</p><p>This demonic bear was a true Saint.</p><p>The demonic bear tried to slap Lu Ming.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming retreated frantically to one side of the valley. At the same time, he used his holy weapon Shield to block in front of him and his black wings to protect his body. Bubbles ‘space-time domain was also added to Lu Ming’s body. Lu Ming retreated as if he was traveling through space and time.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The demonic bear’s palm slammed down, and the bubble’s spacetime domain continued to collapse. Finally, with a bang, it struck the sacred Weapon Shield, which then struck the black wings.</p><p>It was as if Lu Ming had been hit by a huge mountain. His body was like a cannonball, crashing into the wall of the valley at the side. With a loud bang, he crashed into the wall, and gravel flew everywhere.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming spat out a mouthful of blood, his face pale.</p><p>The existence of the Saint realm was too terrifying. Lu Ming was far from it.</p><p>Even with the help of the bubbles, he could not avoid it. The space-time domain was directly destroyed.</p><p>However, the time and space domain had also blocked a large portion of the demonic bear’s power. After that, it was blocked by the Holy weapon Shield and the black wings. Although Lu Ming was beaten until he spat out blood, he was not seriously injured.</p><p>“Is this the power of the Saint realm? The divine Son is the number one heaven’s favorite of the Azure continent. How strong must he be after breaking through to the Saint realm?”</p><p>A thought flashed across Lu Ming’s mind. He felt great pressure.</p><p>He didn’t have much time left. There was only less than a year and a half before the next treasure sealing assembly. He had to quickly break through in this time.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>After the demonic bear slapped Lu Ming away, it was as if it had swatted away a fly. Then, it ignored Lu Ming and rushed toward the distinguished young man.</p><p>In its eyes, the noble young man was the greater threat.</p><p>The demonic bear stomped on the ground, and its mountain-like palm swept toward the noble youth.</p><p>“So what if he’s a Saint? fight!”</p><p>The noble young man roared. His battle intent was like a rainbow, and his messy hair was dancing wildly. He circulated his combat strength to the extreme. The Qi of nine Saint weapons gathered on the sword in his hand, and he slashed out a dazzling sword light.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The sword radiance and the demonic bear’s palm collided with a terrible boom. The terrifying Qi spread out and sent several half-Saint demonic creatures flying and exploding in the air.</p><p>It was so shocking that the aftermath alone could scatter half-Saint demons.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>After the boom, the noble young man’s body trembled. He stepped in the void and retreated eight or nine steps, while the demonic bear’s towering body remained as still as a mountain.</p><p>The noble young man was no match for the Saint demonic creature.</p><p>It was too difficult for a non-Saint to become a battle-Saint, and the gap was too great.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The demonic bear roared and continued to step forward, slapping toward the noble young man.</p><p>The noble young man’s aura grew stronger and stronger. Three more light spots lit up in his body, and three more holy weapons flew out.</p><p>A total of 12 Saint weapons floated around him, and the power of their battle weapon Qi was extremely strong.</p><p>In the void above the noble young man, a shadow suddenly appeared.</p><p>In the shadow, countless weapons were dancing in the air. It was extremely mysterious.</p><p>“This is … Heaven and earth phenomenon! This person is indeed a heavenly spiritual body!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>Legend had it that the heavenly spiritual body was a person favored by the heavens. It was extremely terrifying. Once one’s strength was exerted to the extreme, a heavenly phenomenon would appear in the sky. It was also known as a celestial phenomenon.</p><p>A heavenly spiritual body. No wonder his combat strength was so terrifying.</p><p>A superior-grade earth spiritual body was considered a heaven’s favorite, but compared to a heaven spiritual body, it was far worse.</p><p>The heavenly spiritual body was a body that was blessed by the heavens. As long as they didn’t die, they would have a chance to become a monarch. It was absolutely terrifying.</p><p>In the younger generation of the Azure continent, there was no one with a heaven spiritual body. Even the number one divine Son of the Azure continent only had a superior earth spiritual body.</p><p>This noble youth was a heaven’s favorite who was even more talented than the deity. It was just that his cultivation was not as strong as his body.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! the noble young man shouted. Eleven Saint weapons appeared around him and whizzed towards the demonic bear. He himself held his sword and attacked the demonic bear.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>After a few consecutive exchanges, the noble young man was still at a disadvantage, but he actually withstood the demonic bear’s attack.</p><p>For someone who was not a Saint to be able to battle a Saint, it showed how terrifying the heavenly spiritual body was.</p><p>Roar! Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>At this time, more half-Saint demons rushed out and wandered around, but they couldn’t get close to the battle.</p><p>A huge demonic Tiger charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Let’s go all out!”</p><p>This time, Lu Ming did not Dodge. Instead, he charged straight at the demonic Tiger.</p><p>The demonic Tiger opened its bloody mouth and tried to swallow Lu Ming. Its mouth was so huge that it looked like it was going to swallow an entire house.</p><p>Lu Ming didn’t Dodge or avoid it. He rushed directly into the demonic Tiger’s mouth. The moment he rushed in, Lu Ming’s body entered the mountain and river diagram. Only one mountain and river diagram appeared in the demonic Tiger’s mouth.</p><p>The mountain and river diagram was a treasure refined by an Emperor-level expert. Even if it was swallowed by the demonic Tiger, it would be fine.</p><p>Lu Ming spread his spiritual sense and paid attention to the battle outside.</p><p>At this moment, the noble young man had already exchanged more than ten moves with the demonic bear. He was gradually losing and was completely at a disadvantage.</p><p>“It was swallowed by the demonic Tiger!”</p><p>The scene of Lu Ming being swallowed by the demonic soul naturally fell into the eyes of the noble young man. A sharp glint flashed in his eyes.</p><p>He did not believe that Lu Ming would die so easily. He was probably hiding in the demonic Tiger’s body to avoid other demonic creatures.</p><p>Indeed, when Lu Ming entered the demonic Tiger’s body, all the other demonic creatures had their eyes on the distinguished young man. They surrounded him and stared at him like tigers eyeing their prey.</p><p>“Hmph, don’t think that I can’t do anything to you just because you’re hiding in the body of a demonic creature. I’ll kill you all the same!”</p><p>The noble young man’s eyes were filled with cold killing intent. He was determined to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>He raised his hand and the 12 holy weapons, a shield and a small mountain, rushed towards the demonic bear. His body flashed and he rushed towards the demonic Tiger that had swallowed Lu Ming.</p><p>The demonic bear roared and slapped out with its paw, sending the Saint Weapon Shield and the hill flying. However, this also bought time for the noble youth. His body had already appeared in front of the demonic Tiger.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
