The images of true dragons rushed out and pounced at the figure.</p><p>The figure was a middle-aged burly man with a cultivation of Lv 4 martial Royal realm. He was shocked and tried his best to resist. However, in the next moment, his defense was torn apart by the shadow of the true dragon, and his body was torn into pieces.</p><p>A martial artist at the LV 4 martial Royal realm was killed instantly. Some people gasped. It seemed that it would not be easy to enter the Dragon Palace.</p><p>the shadow of the true dragon is so powerful. It seems to be at the seventh level of the Martial Emperor realm!</p><p>that’s right. It seems that those below the seventh level of the Martial Emperor realm can’t enter at all!</p><p>Some people were discussing.</p><p>“This old man will give it a try!”</p><p>An old man stepped out and rushed toward the gate of the Dragon Palace. Similarly, when he flew to the passageway, many true dragon shadows pounced at him.</p><p>The old man exploded and sent out palm prints continuously, clashing with the true Dragon’s Shadow.</p><p>The true dragon silhouettes were sent flying, but the old man bravely advanced forward. Not long after, he passed through the passageway and arrived in front of the gate.</p><p>Seeing this, more and more people flew toward the gate of the Dragon Palace.</p><p>However, most of them were at least at the seventh level martial monarch realm. They charged forward with all their might and arrived in front of the door.</p><p>The Son of God and Wang Jian also moved. The true dragon shadows didn’t really stop them.</p><p>“Break the door!”</p><p>The divine Son was very domineering. He took a big step forward and punched the gate of the Dragon Palace.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The gate of the Dragon Palace shook violently as if it was about to be shattered.</p><p>“Everyone, what are you waiting for?”</p><p>The godchild said.</p><p>“Alright, let’s attack together!”</p><p>The others also started to move. There were about twenty of them in total. All kinds of rainbow light landed on the door. The door rumbled and finally couldn’t bear the heavy load and directly exploded.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>As soon as the gate of the Dragon Palace opened, more than 20 people rushed in and disappeared in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“Senior brother, Senior Sister, do you want to try?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Tian Chui and Xue ningxin.</p><p>“Since I’m here, I naturally have to give it a try!”</p><p>Tian Chui said, and Xue ningxin nodded her head.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go together!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The three of them immediately flew toward the gate of the Dragon Palace.</p><p>Many people looked at them in surprise.</p><p>these three people are really bold. Two of them are at the fifth level of the martial Royal realm, and one of them is at the third level. They actually want to break into the dragon Palace. They’re really looking for death!</p><p>“Young man, a newborn calf is not afraid of a Tiger!”</p><p>Someone said in disdain.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two pretended that they did not hear anything. When they were about to reach the gate, the shadows of true dragons pounced on them.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Tian Chui roared in anger as he smashed his gigantic hammer forward.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A true Dragon’s Shadow was sent flying.</p><p>Xue ningxin threw out a punch and also sent a true dragon Shadow flying.</p><p>Lu Ming held the long spear and swept it across. He hit one of the dragons. Ten layers of power burst out from the long spear and sent the true Dragon’s Shadow flying.</p><p>“What? The true Dragon’s Shadow was sent flying!”</p><p>even that third level martial Royal realm expert was able to send the true Dragon’s Shadow flying. How is that possible? ”</p><p>The people below the seventh level martial Royal realm all exclaimed in disbelief.</p><p>Roar! Roar! Roar!</p><p>Dragon roars were heard as more true dragon silhouettes pounced toward Lu Ming and the other two.</p><p>The three of them stood in a triangular formation, each in charge of one side, and continued to bombard.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The true dragon silhouettes were sent flying one after another. The three of them formed a formation that was like a sharp knife as they charged towards the gate. Soon, they broke through the obstruction of the true dragon silhouettes and successfully arrived in front of the gate.</p><p>“That true Dragon’s Shadow must have weakened!”</p><p>yes, after so many people’s attacks, the power of the true Dragon’s Shadow has weakened. Otherwise, how could a mere Lv 3 Martial Emperor realm expert break through? our chance has come!</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Immediately, a few people rushed to the gate of the Dragon Palace.</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar resounded, and the shadows of true dragons pounced at these people.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>An elder at the sixth level of the martial Royal realm tried to punch the shadow of the true dragon away. However, when his fist collided with the shadow of the true dragon, his expression changed drastically. With a cracking sound, his bones were broken. Blood spurted out of his mouth as he was sent flying. Behind him, a shadow of the true dragon flew by and tore him in half.</p><p>“Ah!” “Ah!”</p><p>At the same time, a few more people screamed and died on the spot. They were killed by the true dragon.</p><p>The rest of the people were shocked.</p><p>Some of the people who were about to rush out stopped in their tracks. They were covered in cold sweat and secretly rejoiced that their reaction was a little slow.</p><p>The true Dragon’s power did not decrease at all. It was exactly the same as before.</p><p>The three young men were actually able to rush over.</p><p>Many people looked at Lu Ming and the rest in shock.</p><p>They understood that these three people were monstrous geniuses. Their combat strength could not be measured with common sense.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming and the other two rushed into the gate of the Dragon Palace.</p><p>Behind the door was a wide hall. Behind the hall, on the left and right sides, there were two doors.</p><p>“Which way should we go?”</p><p>Tian Chui asked.</p><p>“Anything is fine, just the right side!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Tian Chui and Xue ningxin nodded. The three of them rushed towards the door on the right and found that it was a passageway. After passing through the passageway, they found several long corridors with rooms on each side.</p><p>The three of them walked into the rooms and found that they were empty.</p><p>“We’re late, everything has been taken away!”</p><p>Tian Chui said.</p><p>Because he could see that there were traces on the ground. There should have been things placed there before, but now they had been swept away.</p><p>It should have been taken away by the people who had come in before them.</p><p>“Even the tables, chairs, flower pots, and the like were taken away!” Lu Ming was somewhat speechless.</p><p>legend has it that true dragons love to collect all kinds of treasures and precious materials. Even some ordinary furniture is made of precious materials.</p><p>Tian Chui muttered as he glanced at Xue ningxin.</p><p>“Why? I’m not convinced!”</p><p>Xue ningxin glared at Tian Chui.</p><p>Tian Chui gave an innocent smile and the three of them continued on their way. When they passed by a room, they saw an old man who was currently plundering wantonly.</p><p>The tables, chairs, candle stands, flower pots, and the like were all kept away.</p><p>“WOWO, that flower pot is made from Jade essence stone. Jade essence stone can be used to forge Emperor spiritual weapons!”</p><p>also, that table is made of Dragon Fang Jade. That’s a material for making holy weapons!</p><p>Tian Chui’s eyes widened as he exclaimed.</p><p>The old man’s movements were very fast. With a wave of his hand, he moved everything in the room.</p><p>As expected, true dragons liked to collect treasures. Those ordinary tools were all precious refining materials. It would be strange if they were not taken away.</p><p>The old man glanced at them in surprise, but he ignored them. His figure flashed and he rushed to the other side.</p><p>let’s hurry up too. Otherwise, we won’t even have any soup to drink!</p><p>Tian Chui called out. The three of them displayed their figures, randomly choosing a direction and flying off.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
