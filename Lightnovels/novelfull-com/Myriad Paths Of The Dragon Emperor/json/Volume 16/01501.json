The other party was only at the fifth level of the Martial Emperor realm, yet he was able to suppress Ding Mao. Wasn’t he also a freak?</p><p>“Junior Brother Lu Ming, why don’t we have a competition and see who can step on more floating platforms and kill more beasts of the heavenly way?”</p><p>...</p><p>Tian Chui’s eyes were filled with an intense battle intent.</p><p>“I’ve long heard that this senior brother Tian Chui is fond of battle and killing. It seems that it’s true!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He then nodded and said, ” “Alright!”</p><p>“Then come!”</p><p>Tian Chui was excited.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and went to the counter to pay another two hundred thousand medium-grade raw stones.</p><p>Each time he stepped on the floating platform, he would need two hundred thousand mid-grade raw stones. It was indeed very expensive. However, the effect was also amazing. To Lu Ming, it was definitely worth it.</p><p>Of course, it was not worth it for those who were at the lower level of Domain Realm to come here. They had only stepped onto one or two floating platforms before they were blasted off. The reward might not even be worth 200000 raw gemstones.</p><p>The people who came here to cultivate were usually at least at the fourth level in terms of their domains, or they were people who had reached a bottleneck in their domains.</p><p>After Lu Ming handed in the raw gemstones, he and Tian Chui chose a row of floating platforms and stepped onto the first one.</p><p>Just like before, the two of them sat cross-legged, surrounded by inscriptions.</p><p>Lu Ming took his time to kill the beast of the heavenly way and comprehend the chaos realm.</p><p>Tian Chui was the same. The speed of the two of them was almost the same. They passed through the first floating platform at almost the same time, stepping onto the second floating platform, then the third …</p><p>One floating platform after another went up. After passing through the sixth floating platform, Lu Ming’s Chaos Domain had reached the limit of level three. He was only a step away from level four.</p><p>Next, he could start to break through to the fourth-level Domain Realm.</p><p>“The seventh floating platform, seventh level domain, how strong would it be?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered as he stood on the sixth floating platform.</p><p>“Haha, Junior Brother, I’ll go first!”</p><p>On the side, Tian Chui laughed out loud and took a step forward, stepping onto the seventh floating platform.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and stepped onto the seventh floating platform. He then sat cross-legged and covered himself with inscriptions.</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming appeared on the heavenly Dao battlefield.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A heavenly path mutant beast formed. It had seven golden marks on its forehead, and a powerful aura gushed out.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the next moment, the heavenly way strange beast rushed in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The long spear appeared and swept out, hitting the body of the beast. A fourfold force exploded.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The strange beast was sent flying and fell a few hundred meters away. However, it shook its head and stood up again, as if nothing had happened.</p><p>“So strong?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>A level Seven beast of the heavenly path was much stronger than a level six beast of the heavenly path. Even a fourfold burst of power could not kill it.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>At this moment, more heavenly path mutant beasts gathered and pounced toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The long spear trembled as Lu Ming charged into the group of mutated beasts.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The long spear swayed and formed shadows of the spear, continuously lashing at the beasts of heavenly law. The beasts of heavenly law were sent flying like sandbags, but they were fine. They shook their heads and stood up again, pouncing at Lu Ming.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The spear turned into a rainbow light, and four forces burst forth, piercing through a heavenly path mutant beast.</p><p>However, this heavenly way strange beast did not die immediately. It held onto Lu Ming tightly.</p><p>The other beasts of the heavenly way attacked and Lu Ming had no choice but to retreat. However, he was still scratched by one of the beasts, and he felt a tearing pain.</p><p>The long spear that was stabbed into the beast of the heavenly way transformed back into the chaos Domain and dissipated. Then, it condensed in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>At the same time, seven golden marks flew into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>The strange beast that had been pierced through was finally dead.</p><p>this won’t do. If I kill one, I’ll get injured. It’ll be very sad for the seventh floating platform!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>With this kind of injury-for-injury method, he would be killed before he could kill all the exotic beasts. Once he was killed here, his spirit would return to his body, which was equivalent to failure.</p><p>the power of the [ thirteen storing power strikes ] is not enough. It is only equivalent to the power of the second level. If it is equivalent to the third or fourth level, it can burst out six or eight times of attack power at once. Then it will not be a problem to cross this floating platform!</p><p>Lu Ming had many thoughts.</p><p>Lu Ming was not in a hurry to kill the beast. Instead, he used the beast’s cultivation of the thirteen charged strikes and slowly integrated the energy circulation technique of the thirteen charged strikes into the chaos realm.</p><p>One by one, the mutant beasts were sent flying before they stood up again.</p><p>The long spear was like a dragon, and the sky was filled with spear shadows. More than a hundred strange beasts pounced on him, but they could not break through Lu Ming’s defense in a short time.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>One of the beasts was swept away by Lu Ming’s spear, and half of its body exploded. It stood up and swayed a few times before falling down again. Seven golden marks flew into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>the third level, sixfold power!</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He had a breakthrough in the thirteen accumulated power strikes and its power had increased greatly.</p><p>He had originally cultivated the thirteen storing power strikes to the fifth level, which allowed him to launch ten-fold attacks. Now, he was simply integrating it into the chaos Domain, so the difficulty was much lower and the speed was much faster.</p><p>The spear swept out, and instantly, six layers of attack power were superimposed together, and the power suddenly increased by six times.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A strange beast was sent flying and exploded.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear was like a real Dragon, constantly blasting out.</p><p>As the beasts were killed, the dense golden marks flew towards Lu Ming and into his body.</p><p>Not long after, when Lu Ming stabbed the last beast with his spear, his spirit returned to his physical body.</p><p>Lu Ming opened his eyes and looked at Tian Chui. He realized that Tian Chui’s body was emitting a golden glow. He was refining the Golden mark.</p><p>Tian Chui had passed the test earlier than Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. This was normal. After all, Tian Chui’s territory had already reached level six. Moreover, Tian Chui’s territory was not to be underestimated. It was very powerful. It was normal for him to clear it before Lu Ming.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming also began to refine the heavenly Dao mark that he had obtained previously.</p><p>Half a day later, Lu Ming had refined all the heavenly Dao marks.</p><p>I still haven’t broken through. It seems that it’s not easy to break through to the fourth level!</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head.</p><p>Looking towards Tian Chui, he saw Tian Chui looking right at him.</p><p>Junior Brother is really amazing. With a third level domain, you were actually able to clear the seventh floating platform. I’m impressed!</p><p>Tian Chui said with a grin.</p><p>senior brother is the amazing one. I still lost to senior brother Guan!</p><p>Lu Ming also smiled.</p><p>“Hahaha, Junior Brother, you still want to attempt the eighth floating platform? If you want to challenge the eighth floating platform, then this senior brother here will directly admit defeat to you!”</p><p>Tian Chui laughed in a forthright manner.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head.</p><p>The beast of the heavenly path on the eighth floating platform would definitely be much stronger than the one on the seventh. Although Lu Ming’s [ storing power thirteen strikes ] still had room for improvement, he estimated that even if he cultivated it to the tenth layer, he might not be able to pass the eighth floating platform.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
