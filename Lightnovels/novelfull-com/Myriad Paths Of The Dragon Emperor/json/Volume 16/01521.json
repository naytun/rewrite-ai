He had quite a reputation, so naturally there were people who recognized him.</p><p>that Snow Dragon’s combat strength is also extremely shocking. It seems to be stronger than ordinary true dragons!</p><p>...</p><p>“Indeed, that should be a true Dragon’s prodigy.”</p><p>and that Lv 4 martial Royal realm guy has amazing combat strength!</p><p>that’s where you’re wrong. The LV 4 Martial Emperor realm expert is relying on his holy weapon. Did you see that? the wings on his back and the spear in his hand are both holy weapons. That’s why he’s so powerful. Without a holy weapon, his combat strength is just average!</p><p>“That’s true!”</p><p>Many of the major sects were watching and discussing.</p><p>In the sky, Lu Ming used his body technique and pounced on a sixth level Martial Emperor.</p><p>That person’s expression changed drastically. He did not dare to take Lu Ming’s attack head-on.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a screech was heard. A huge Golden Toad pounced at Lu Ming. It opened its mouth and a dense poisonous gas spread towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“The poison in the Saint weapon!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed slightly.</p><p>He could tell at a glance that the Golden Toad was a Saint weapon, and the poison in it was absolutely terrifying.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming retreated rapidly. He did not want to come into contact with the poisonous gas.</p><p>The young man from the Yu Du sect controlled the Golden Toad sacred weapon and chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The Golden Toad cried out like a living creature. It stomped in the air and turned into a golden light, charging toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Then, a ray of golden light burst out of the Toad’s mouth and shot toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Tongue!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. The golden light was the Toad’s tongue.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The Black Dragon Spear stabbed out like a Black bolt of lightning.</p><p>Ding! Ding!</p><p>Two rays of light, one black and one gold, collided in the air. Lu Ming’s body trembled slightly and he took two steps back. The Toad’s tongue was also sent flying.</p><p>“What a powerful force!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. His opponent’s holy weapon was indeed powerful. Not only did it have poisonous gas, but it also had a tongue attack. Without a doubt, if one was hit by the tongue, they would definitely be strangled to death.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Golden Toad cried out and spat out poisonous gas again.</p><p>“Get back!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He flapped his black wings, bringing with it a strong gust of wind that swept forward. The poisonous gas was blown away by the strong wind and instantly deviated from its course. A disciple of the Tian Yu demon sect was careless and was enveloped by the poisonous gas. He immediately let out a shrill scream and turned into a skeleton in a few breaths, falling to the ground.</p><p>What a terrifying poisonous gas. The disciple of the Tianyu demonic sect was a Lv 6 martial Royal realm martial artist with a low-class earth spiritual body, but he died in a few breaths.</p><p>The young man from the desire poison sect had a dark expression as he controlled the Golden Toad to charge at Lu Ming.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, a terrifying sharp light shot towards Lu Ming from behind.</p><p>It was a long spear, the spear of God punishment!</p><p>This spear of God punishment was too fast and too powerful.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The moment Lu Ming felt it, his body seemed to have stiffened. He was locked in place by a terrifying aura. In the next moment, the spear of divine punishment was about to pierce through his body.</p><p>It was too fast. It was so fast that Lu Ming did not even have time to react.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The spear of divine punishment pierced through Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>However, at this moment, Lu Ming’s body shattered like a mirror with a bang.</p><p>More than ten meters away, Lu Ming’s figure appeared. He could feel a thin layer of cold sweat on his back.</p><p>The attack just now was too dangerous. Lu Ming was almost killed.</p><p>Fortunately, at the critical moment, bubbles made a move and cast the space-time domain, teleporting Lu Ming more than ten meters away and avoiding the disaster.</p><p>A figure appeared at the spot where Lu Ming had been standing and said in a cold voice, ” space-time domain!</p><p>“It’s this person!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold. The person who appeared was Shi Guan, the proud Son of Heaven from the deity sect who had chased after Lu Ming previously.</p><p>This man was a heaven’s favorite at the ninth level of the martial Royal realm, and he had just launched a sneak attack.</p><p>“The spacetime domain will also die!”</p><p>Shi Guan said coldly. He swept the spear of divine punishment in his hand. The air exploded violently as the spear of divine punishment shot towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s glabella glowed and a shield appeared in front of him. At the same time, the black wings protected him.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The shield was instantly blasted away. The spear of God’s punishment smashed onto Lu Ming’s Black wings. Lu Ming’s body shook violently and he was sent flying like a cannonball.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Blood spurted out of Lu Ming’s mouth.</p><p>His opponent was too strong, and his battle prowess was shocking. Even with his Saint weapon protecting him, he was still heavily injured.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Shi Guan shouted coldly. His entire body was bathed in holy light. He took a step forward, and with a flash of holy light, he charged at Lu Ming. The spear of divine punishment stabbed out.</p><p>The spear of divine punishment, which seemed to be able to penetrate everything in the world, was aimed at the area between Lu Ming’s eyebrows.</p><p>However, at this critical moment, a cold aura spread out from below, and an icy sword stabbed towards Shi Guan at a terrifying speed.</p><p>Shi Guan’s expression changed. This ice sword posed a fatal threat to him. He could not be bothered to continue killing Lu Ming. He turned the spear of divine punishment around and struck the ice sword.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A shocking explosion was heard and a terrifying wave of fluctuation swept in all directions. With the help of this fluctuation, Lu Ming drifted back dozens of miles, his eyes cold.</p><p>Just now, he had decided to use all his means to cooperate with bubbles and fight to the death.</p><p>Even if he were to die in battle, he would not let the other party have an easy time. But now, it seemed that there was no need.</p><p>“Cold wave, it’s you!”</p><p>Shi Guan’s figure also retreated as he coldly shouted.</p><p>At this moment, a young man appeared in front of Shi Guan.</p><p>This young man was tall and handsome. He was wearing a long white robe with an Ice Dragon embroidered on it.</p><p>Dragon God Valley, Ice Dragon Valley’s disciples.</p><p>so many people from the three major sects besieged three disciples of Dragon God Valley. Now, even you, a Lv 9 martial Royal realm expert, have made a move. Hehe, how shameless!</p><p>The young man from the Ice Dragon Valley sneered.</p><p>“This Lu Ming has killed many people of my deity sect. He must die. There’s no need to resort to any means!”</p><p>Shi Guan said coldly.</p><p>“Hehe, I killed many of your heavenly God sect’s people? It’s laughable. For so many years, has your Tian Shen sect not killed enough of my Dragon God Valley’s disciples? Does that mean that I have to kill every single one of your Tian Shen sect’s people? You can use any method?”</p><p>Cold wave showed a mocking smile.</p><p>Shi Guan’s face darkened.</p><p>Indeed, the Dragon God Valley and the tianshen sect had never been on good terms. Killing each other was a common occurrence, but there were still certain rules.</p><p>For example, the Saint stage powerhouses of both sides would not attack each other’s juniors. If they did, it would be chaotic.</p><p>“Hanchao, you don’t need to say anything more. Today, these people must die!”</p><p>Shi Guan said.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, several figures flew over from all directions. There were at least a few dozen people standing behind Shi Guan.</p><p>All of them were disciples of the heavenly God sect.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>On the other side, there were also people flying out. They were either filled with demonic Qi or poisonous Qi. They were people from the Yu Du sect and the Tian Yu demon sect.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
