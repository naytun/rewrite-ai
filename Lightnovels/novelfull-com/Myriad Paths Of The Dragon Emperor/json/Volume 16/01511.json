BOOM!</p><p>In the outside world, the battle was still going on above Dragon Lake.</p><p>The divine Son, Wang Jian, and the others were still attacking the Black Dragon corpse.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The black true dragon emitted a black light all over its body, as if black flames were burning. Its combat strength was actually stronger than before.</p><p>the true Dragon’s corpse is burning the seal to increase its combat strength. But soon, the seal disappeared and the true Dragon’s corpse couldn’t resist anymore!</p><p>Xue ningxin said.</p><p>The three of them flew to the side of Dragon Lake and watched from afar.</p><p>The Son of God controlled the White jade Hall like a God’s child. He bathed in holy light and attacked the Black Dragon continuously.</p><p>As for Wang Jian, there was also a combat sword floating above his head. Its power was shocking, and it was obviously a Saint weapon as well. Rays of terrifying sword light slashed towards the Black Dragon.</p><p>As for the other experts, they could only watch from afar and could not interfere at all.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The black true dragon suddenly roared. Two dragon horns flew out of its head and rapidly grew in size. In the end, they turned into two blades that reached the sky and slashed down at the Son of God and Wang Jian.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The deity’s white jade Pagoda and Wang Jian’s combat sword were both sent flying by the Dragon’s horn. The deity and Wang Jian’s bodies trembled as they retreated.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The black true dragon roared in anger, twisted its body, and rushed into the distance.</p><p>“You want to leave? dream on!”</p><p>The Son of God shouted in anger. He controlled the White jade Pagoda and heavily struck one of the Dragon’s horns. The Dragon’s horn was sent flying, and its light dimmed. It quickly became smaller.</p><p>The Son of God rushed over and grabbed the Dragon Horn.</p><p>On the other side, Wang Jian also held a Dragon Horn in his hand. The two of them put away the Dragon Horn and turned into a rainbow light, chasing after the Black Dragon.</p><p>“There are dragon scales!”</p><p>“It’s mine!”</p><p>As soon as the Son of God and Wang Jian left, the rest of the people went into a frenzy.</p><p>In the battle just now, many dragon scales had fallen off the black Dragon’s body. If these dragon scales were refined into a defensive armor, they would definitely be a rare treasure.</p><p>The experts under him all pounced towards the five or six dragon scales. A chaotic battle broke out at the scene.</p><p>From time to time, experts would let out miserable screams as they were killed.</p><p>“Senior brother, Senior Sister, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming said to Tian Chui and Xue ningxin.</p><p>They had gained a lot from this trip. They had emptied a Saint realm true dragon’s treasure vault. This was the biggest winner. It was worth it. There was no point in staying here.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Tian Chui took out his flying shuttle, and the three of them entered it. The flying shuttle broke through the air and entered the murderous aura.</p><p>Not long after Lu Ming and the rest left, the divine Son and Wang Jian returned with cold faces.</p><p>The Son of God, in particular, exuded a cold killing intent.</p><p>It was obvious that their harvest wasn’t good, and they might have lost the true black Dragon.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The Son of God’s entire body seemed to have transformed into a long spear that pierced through the void and charged towards the powerful beings who were fighting for the Dragon’s scale.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>A Lv 9 martial Royal realm expert had been pierced through by the deity and died on the spot.</p><p>“Today, none of you shall think of leaving!”</p><p>kill! the Son of God said coldly. The spear of divine punishment pierced through the void and killed another expert.</p><p>Previously, in the Dragon Palace, he had used the God prohibited void inscription talisman scroll to imprison the black true dragon. That way, the black true dragon would not be able to escape at all. It would be destroyed by him and the true Dragon’s corpse would be in his possession.</p><p>However, at the crucial moment, he was disturbed. Someone destroyed the inscription scroll of the God prohibited void, allowing the black true dragon to escape.</p><p>The God forbidden void inscription talisman scroll was an ancient inscription talisman scroll that he had obtained by chance. It was extremely precious, but if he could get the Saint realm true Dragon’s corpse, it would also be a big profit.</p><p>But now, he didn’t get the Saint realm true Dragon’s corpse and wasted the God prohibited ancient void talisman. This made his killing intent extremely strong.</p><p>Needless to say, the person who had destroyed him was one of the people who had entered the Dragon Palace before. Therefore, the Son of God was now on a killing spree.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>One expert after another was killed by the Divine Child.</p><p>“The Son of God has gone crazy!”</p><p>“Quickly run!”</p><p>The remaining experts fled in all directions.</p><p>“Don’t even think about leaving!”</p><p>The Son of God said coldly. The White jade Pagoda flew out and turned into the size of a mountain, pressing down.</p><p>The rest of the people screamed as their bodies exploded, and their bodies and spirits were destroyed.</p><p>The dozens of experts who had entered the Dragon Palace were all killed by the divine Son in an instant, except for Wang Jian.</p><p>“Where are the three ants from Dragon God Valley?”</p><p>The divine Son swept his gaze across the room but did not see Lu Ming and the other two.</p><p>However, he didn’t care too much about it. He didn’t think that three people with the highest cultivation level of Lv 5 martial Royal realm could break his God prohibited ancient void talisman.</p><p>“Hehe, Divine Child, you’ve suffered a double loss today!”</p><p>Not far away, Wang Jian sneered.</p><p>“Hmph, you’d better shut up. Otherwise, I’ll kill you too!”</p><p>The Son of God said coldly.</p><p>“You can try!”</p><p>Wang Jian revealed his battle intent.</p><p>The remnant’s eyes flashed with an ominous glint, but he didn’t make a move. Wang Jian’s cultivation was at the same level as his, and he was also a peerless genius. It wouldn’t be easy to kill Wang Jian.</p><p>The Son of God snorted and took a step forward. He followed the hole in the Dragon Palace and rushed into it.</p><p>He was going to search for any treasures left in the Dragon Palace.</p><p>The moment he rushed in, his expression changed. He saw the moving dragon coffin and the door under it.</p><p>the vacuum Treasury! Damn it, it’s the true dragon Treasury!</p><p>The Son of God growled.</p><p>With a flash of sword light, Wang Jian appeared. He swept his gaze across the room and said in a cold voice, ” “It seems that our hard work was taken advantage of by others!”</p><p>Then, the two of them rushed into the treasure vault. Looking at the empty vault, cold killing intent emanated from their bodies.</p><p>This time, the two of them had worked so hard, but in the end, they had obtained nothing other than a Dragon Horn and a few dragon scales. Even the most important true dragon Treasury had been taken by someone else.</p><p>This was especially so for the divine Son, who had even lost an ancient talisman.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>The Son of God roared, his killing intent as cold as a knife.</p><p>Then, he flew out of the Treasury and looked at the door carefully.</p><p>true dragon’s blood! No wonder it can open the door to the treasure vault!</p><p>The Son of God sensed Xue ningxin’s blood on the door, and a cold light flickered in his eyes.</p><p>the real dragon’s blood! It’s the Dragon from Dragon God Valley! It’s the three ants!</p><p>how dare you steal the vacuum treasure house right under my nose. You’re looking for death!</p><p>After a while, the Son of God said in a cold voice.</p><p>“You’re indeed very bold!”</p><p>Wang Jian said coldly. Then, he turned into a ray of sword light and left.</p><p>Then, the Son of God stepped into the air and left, his body filled with killing intent.</p><p>After the divine Son and Wang Jian left, the remaining martial artists below the LV 7 martial Royal realm flew outside the Dragon Palace in fear. They followed the hole and flew in to search the Dragon Palace, but they did not find much.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
