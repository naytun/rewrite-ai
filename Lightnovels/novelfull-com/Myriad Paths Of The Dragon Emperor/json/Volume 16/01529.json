The other two almost rushed off the fighting stage, but they were still killed.</p><p>In this round, two people from Dragon God Valley died and two were defeated. There were seventeen people left.</p><p>No one challenged Lu Ming in this round. It seemed that they were not confident and wanted to challenge him later.</p><p>In the sixth round, although Dragon God Valley was still completely defeated, all of them managed to keep their lives. Although the three sides of the tianshen sect wanted to kill the people of Dragon God Valley, they were all pushed off the fighting stage by them.</p><p>The atmosphere in the Dragon God Valley was finally a little better.</p><p>After this round, there were only thirteen people left from Dragon God Valley.</p><p>Apart from the life-and-death Sword sect, the Dragon God Valley sect had the least number of people.</p><p>It had only been six rounds, and many of the other sects still had around thirty people left. Some even had twenty or so people, close to thirty.</p><p>As for the tianshen sect and the Tianyu demonic sect, they only had around thirty people left. Their losses were very small.</p><p>Then, two more rounds passed.</p><p>There were only five people left on the side of Dragon God Valley.</p><p>They were Lu Ming, han Xun, Tian Chui, Xue ningxin, and another person named Zi Yue.</p><p>After so many rounds, no one had challenged Tian Chui or Xue ningxin.</p><p>In the battle ten days ago, Tian Chui and Xue ningxin had revealed their terrifying combat strength. To be able to fight against heaven’s favorites like mo he and Wu Qian Du, their combat strength was undoubtedly extremely strong. It was normal that they had not been challenged before.</p><p>By now, eight rounds had passed.</p><p>From the ninth round onwards, the faces of the people from the heaven deity sect started to turn ugly.</p><p>None of the remaining five people from Dragon God Valley were weak. They did not know who to challenge.</p><p>“I’m going to kill Lu Ming!”</p><p>A young man at the sixth level of the martial Royal realm stepped out and flew up to the fighting ring.</p><p>“Lu Ming, come out!”</p><p>The young man at the peak of the sixth level martial Royal realm of the divine sky sect condensed a spear of divine punishment in his hand and pointed it at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Just what I wanted!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled coldly. He took a step forward and landed on the fighting ring.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Light curtains appeared around the Paragon of the tianshen sect, and even an Emperor spiritual weapon armor appeared.</p><p>It was obvious that this person had learned his lesson and had set up layers of defense on himself from the beginning.</p><p>“I’m a lot more careful, but I still have to die!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“You’re the one who’s going to die. Kill!”</p><p>die! the heaven God sect’s Paragon shouted. He took a step forward and turned into a beam of holy light, rushing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The spear of divine punishment streaked across the sky, making a terrifying whistling sound.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and it collided with the spear of divine punishment.</p><p>There was a huge explosion. Lu Ming did not move, but the other party retreated a few steps.</p><p>“Your combat strength is only so-so!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“I’m not done yet!”</p><p>you’re courting death! the other party shouted angrily. A milky-white Book flew out from his brow. This book was an Emperor spiritual weapon.</p><p>As the book was flipped open, rays of white light flew out and landed on the heaven God sect’s Paragon. The aura of the heaven God sect’s Paragon became stronger.</p><p>A real, milky-white spear appeared in his hand. He thrust the spear forward, and the power this time was much stronger than the last time.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a few punches in succession. The terrifying fist force traversed the void and blasted toward the other party.</p><p>His opponent’s long spear continued to thrust out, turning into terrifying Spears of divine punishment. They collided with Lu Ming’s fist force, causing a terrible boom to erupt on the fighting ring.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two of them had exchanged more than ten moves.</p><p>that Lu Ming is so powerful. He’s at the peak of the fourth level martial Royal realm, but he can fight against a heaven’s favorite at the peak of the sixth level martial Royal realm!</p><p>it’s indeed terrifying. However, Lu Ming’s cultivation is two whole levels lower. In my opinion, he’ll definitely lose.</p><p>not necessarily. The person from the deity sect has a medium-grade earth spiritual body, while Lu Ming obviously has a superior-grade earth spiritual body!</p><p>The surrounding crowd discussed.</p><p>“Die, die!”</p><p>The combat strength of The Prodigy of the tianshen sect was getting more and more violent. He kept pouring his attacks on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Has this reached your limit? Then, let’s end this!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s fist momentum seemed to be able to penetrate the void. In an instant, it shattered the spears of God’s punishment that were thrust out by the prodigies of the tianshen sect.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming took a step forward and threw a punch that destroyed everything. He landed a heavy blow on the other party’s chest. His energy surged and broke through several layers of the other party’s defense in a row. It then landed on the other party’s armor.</p><p>The armor shook and the heaven’s God sect’s Paragon was sent flying. He slid on the fighting stage for a long distance and spat out a few mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>Earlier on, Lu Ming did not use his full strength at all. At this moment, Lu Ming was using his full strength.</p><p>Although the other party’s cultivation was two levels higher than his, Lu Ming’s spirit body and Chaos Domain were much more powerful than the other party’s spirit body and Chaos Domain. He could completely make up for the gap between the two levels of cultivation.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>The heaven deity sect’s Paragon was shocked and furious. He did not expect Lu Ming to be so powerful.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and approached the other party at a high speed.</p><p>I have an Emperor spiritual weapon to protect me. You can’t kill me!</p><p>The heaven God sect’s Paragon let out a long cry and retreated rapidly.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. An Emperor spiritual weapon spear appeared in his hand.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The long spear pierced towards the other party.</p><p>[ thirteen charged strikes ]!</p><p>The terrifying spear radiance destroyed the opponent’s counterattack and stabbed into the opponent’s armor.</p><p>“It’s useless …”</p><p>The other party shouted, but in the next moment, his expression changed drastically, and there was only fear.</p><p>The tip of Lu Ming’s long spear had 13 layers of attack power. They stacked and exploded in an instant, erupting with a terrifying penetrating power.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The fearsome penetrative force pierced through the opponent’s Emperor spiritual weapon armor, and the long spear pierced through the opponent’s heart.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Then, with a shake of the spear, the land of destruction erupted. The spiritual God of the other party disappeared before it could escape.</p><p>The heaven’s God sect’s Paragon was dead!</p><p>Si si …</p><p>Gasps could be heard at the scene.</p><p>A heaven’s favorite at the peak of the sixth level martial Royal realm who had cultivated a medium-grade earth spiritual body was killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>The Prodigy of the tianshen sect wanted to kill Lu Ming, but he was killed by Lu Ming again.</p><p>This kind of heaven’s pride expert was the peak existence even among all the people who participated in this time’s treasure auction, except for those top heaven’s pride experts who cultivated superior earth spiritual bodies.</p><p>However, a superior earth spiritual body was extremely rare. There were not many of them in the entire Azure region.</p><p>Each of the thirteen top sects participating in the party had at most one or two disciples. Some of the sects didn’t even have one.</p><p>It could be said that Lu Ming’s combat strength was already at the peak among the participants of the treasure auction.</p><p>Many people were guessing whether Lu Ming could compete with those who had superior earth spiritual bodies and were at the peak of the sixth level martial Royal realm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
