They flowed into Xiangxiang Beila’s body and began to flow through her meridians.</p><p>...</p><p>Not long after, a ray of light shot into the sky.</p><p>this is the first divine Meridian. It’s so fast!</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly shocked.</p><p>But then, the second and third light beams shot out.</p><p>All three Holy pulses had been opened.</p><p>Lu Ming was already speechless. This speed was too shocking.</p><p>Back then, when Lu Ming had just stepped into martial arts, he had spent a lot of effort to open up his three divine meridians. He had even used the true war Dragon technique to open them up.</p><p>But now, it had only been a few minutes, and Xiangxiang Beila had already opened up all three divine meridians.</p><p>Once the three Holy pulses were opened, Xiangxiang Beila’s cultivation naturally entered the first realm of a martial artist, the warrior realm, and she reached the first grade warrior realm.</p><p>However, this was far from over.</p><p>Between the heaven and earth, there was a constant flow of green energy that gushed into Xiangxiang Beila’s body.</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila naturally circulated her ‘universal Scripture’ cultivation technique to absorb and refine the energy. Her petite body was completely enveloped in a ball of green light.</p><p>“You’ve already learned how to use the universal Scripture?”</p><p>Lu Ming was getting more and more surprised.</p><p>Hu hu hu …</p><p>The energy in the world was constantly being refined by Xiangxiang Beila. Her aura became stronger and stronger, and her cultivation level was also rising crazily.</p><p>First grade, second grade, third grade …</p><p>In less than half a day, Xiangxiang Beila’s cultivation had reached the ninth grade warrior realm.</p><p>Then, after a while, Xiangxiang Beila’s body let out a loud sound.</p><p>She had broken through to the first grade master realm.</p><p>Lu Ming was already numb to it.</p><p>He had just started cultivating, and in just half a day, his cultivation had already reached the 1-dan master realm. If he had not seen it with his own eyes, he would not have believed it.</p><p>Talent. This was what talent was. Lu Ming’s own talent was far inferior to Xiangxiang Beila’s.</p><p>Lu Ming’s mouth was about to split into a smile. He knew that he had picked up a treasure.</p><p>This disciple’s future achievements would most likely be extremely shocking.</p><p>At this moment, Xiangxiang Beila’s cultivation finally stopped increasing. She opened her eyes.</p><p>“Eh, is this my bloodline?”</p><p>With a thought, Xiangxiang Beila’s bloodline flew in front of her, and she started to examine it curiously.</p><p>With a thought, her bloodline would fly into her spine and hide. It would then appear and hide again. She was having a lot of fun.</p><p>Yi, how wonderful, my body!</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila took a step forward and was a few meters away. Then, green true energy spread out from her body, and grass grew under her feet.</p><p>“Xiangxiang, in the future, try not to reveal your bloodline and cultivation in front of others, understand?”</p><p>Lu Ming urged.</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila’s current cultivation was still weak, and if she revealed too much of her abilities, she would probably be targeted by people with ill intentions.</p><p>“Yes, Xiangxiang understands!”</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila nodded obediently.</p><p>For the rest of the time, Lu Ming began to impart his cultivation experience and a few martial arts techniques that were more suitable for Xiangxiang Beila to cultivate.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, seven days had passed.</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila’s progress was simply too shocking. It was practically an increase of one realm a day.</p><p>Seven days later, Xiangxiang Beila’s cultivation had already reached the seventh grade master realm.</p><p>However, as her cultivation level increased, Xiangxiang Beila’s improvement finally slowed down.</p><p>At this moment, the inscription of the secondary body array was finally completed. It was time for Lu Ming to leave.</p><p>Lu Ming took Xiangxiang and returned to the Lu clan Fort. He found Liu Wanjun and Lu Zhenghao and handed Xiangxiang to them.</p><p>“Shizun, Xiangxiang is waiting for you to come and pick me up!”</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila blinked her big black eyes and looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Of course!”</p><p>Lu Ming touched Xiangxiang Beila’s little head. He then bade farewell to Lu Zhenghao and Liu Wanjun and left the Lu clan Fort.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>As the wind blew on his face, Lu Ming turned into a ray of light and disappeared into the distance in the blink of an eye.</p><p>After passing through the mountains, they began to see cities.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body shape began to change as well. He turned into an ordinary young man with dark skin.</p><p>Now that evil spirit had set its eyes on him, he naturally had to be more careful on this trip. It was the safest to travel in disguise.</p><p>This time, he didn’t have a goal and just walked casually.</p><p>Sometimes, he would feel something and sit on the top of a mountain, watching the sun rise in the east and set in the West, watching the clouds roll and relax, and the sky filled with multicolored light.</p><p>He sat there for a month.</p><p>During this process, he didn’t cultivate. Instead, he emptied his mind and forgot everything. It was as if he was one with nature.</p><p>A month later, he left the place.</p><p>In the middle of a volcano, Lu Ming sat cross-legged at the mouth of the volcano. He let the flames engulf his body and wear down the killing intent in the depths of his heart and soul. He was like an old monk in meditation. Another month passed.</p><p>After that, he came to a land of ice and snow. He laid down on the glacier and let the snow cover his body, but he fell asleep.</p><p>This sleep lasted for another month.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming traveled all over the Cang region, appreciating the different sceneries. His mind and body were empty, and he became one with nature.</p><p>Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, a year’s time was almost up.</p><p>The Feng Family Village was a very small village with only a few dozen families. It was located in the far west of the Azure continent.</p><p>In the village, in front of a wooden house, a dark-skinned young man was holding a piece of wood in his left hand and a small knife in his right hand. He was carving seriously.</p><p>The knife flew in the young man’s hand smoothly and harmoniously, as if it was one with nature.</p><p>The wood splinters flew everywhere, and soon, a piece of wood turned into a woman, a peerless woman with the beauty to topple a country.</p><p>“Big brother Lu, is this your lover? It’s so beautiful!”</p><p>A young girl, about fifteen or sixteen years old, with slightly dark skin, but healthy and beautiful, skipped over and looked curiously at the wooden statue in the young man’s hand.</p><p>This young man was naturally Lu Ming, who had traveled all over the Azure region.</p><p>Three months ago, Lu Ming had come to this small mountain village in the far west of the Azure region.</p><p>This small mountain village was simple, natural, and sincere.</p><p>Lu Ming liked this small mountain village very much. He settled down in this small mountain village and became a Carpenter in the village.</p><p>He would help the village fix the furniture and when he had nothing to do, Lu Ming would carve some statues.</p><p>“Oh, really? The Ling girl is also very beautiful?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>The young lady in front of him was called Feng Ling. She was the granddaughter of the village chief. Lu Ming’s small wooden house was located near the village chief’s wooden house. As they went back and forth, Lu Ming, Feng Ling, and the village chief were very familiar with each other.</p><p>“Oh, really? Hehe!”</p><p>Feng Ling laughed excitedly, like a Northern Sparrow.</p><p>big brother Lu, you should also carve a statue for Feng Ling!</p><p>Feng Ling looked at Lu Ming in anticipation.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll give it to you tomorrow!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and his gaze fell on the statue that he had just carved.</p><p>The statue was Xie nianqing’s appearance.</p><p>The wooden statue gave off a faint fragrance that made one’s mind calm and enter a state of emptiness.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
