Lu Ming won!”</p><p>the Dragon God Valley won first place!</p><p>The disciples of Dragon God Valley shouted in excitement.</p><p>Some people were so excited that they were trembling and tears were welling up in their eyes.</p><p>This battle had been too difficult for Dragon God Valley.</p><p>From the very beginning, the tianshen sect, the Tianyu demonic sect, and the Yudu sect had been targeting the disciples of Dragon God Valley.</p><p>At that time, they were angry and helpless, even thinking that they might be the first to be eliminated and not be able to participate in this time’s treasure sealing assembly.</p><p>However, he didn’t expect the situation to turn around so quickly. When there were only four people left from Dragon God Valley, they began to fight back and took the initiative.</p><p>In the end, when Lu Ming was the only one left, he defeated many strong enemies with his unrivaled talent and won first place.</p><p>With such a huge contrast, the excitement of the Dragon God Valley disciples could be imagined.</p><p>Of course, he Yu and the disciples of Silver Dragon Valley all looked gloomy.</p><p>However, the disciples of the three great sects, the heavenly God sect, the heavenly universe demonic sect, and the Yu Du sect, looked even more terrible.</p><p>In this battle, the three major sects had lost everything. They had suffered a double loss.</p><p>Although they had killed many people from Dragon God Valley, they were all weak and not particularly talented. However, those who died at the hands of Lu Ming and the others were all true geniuses.</p><p>Many of them were heaven’s favorites with medium-grade earth spiritual bodies.</p><p>In particular, the three people who were killed by Lu Ming were geniuses with superior-grade earth spiritual bodies. They had suffered heavy losses.</p><p>The people from the other sects all had complicated expressions on their faces.</p><p>At this moment, everyone’s eyes fell on the fighting ring and on the handsome and tall figure.</p><p>This time’s treasure auction, in a sense, was an individual event.</p><p>That was Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming dominated the competition alone.</p><p>This had never happened since the treasure auction.</p><p>The treasure settlement party this time seemed to be held solely for Lu Ming.</p><p>“Hahaha, good, good, good!”</p><p>In the pavilion of Dragon God Valley, the elder of the Saint realm stepped out and laughed. He said ” good ” three times, which showed how excited he was.</p><p>“Now, it’s time to give the reward!”</p><p>The Saint realm elder of Dragon God Valley looked at the pavilion of the tianshen sect.</p><p>The sage realm elder of the divine sky sect flew out with an ugly expression.</p><p>He unwillingly took out a Jade bottle and said, ” the last person to remain in this small meeting will be rewarded with seven royal domain pills!</p><p>He then threw the Jade bottle to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming caught it and opened it. There were seven glittering and translucent royal domain pills inside. They were dazzling and exuded a strong medicinal fragrance.</p><p>Just a whiff of the medicinal fragrance was enough to make his entire body feel comfortable.</p><p>At the scene, countless envious and jealous gazes were cast on Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He looked at Tian Chui, Xue ningxin, and han Xun and said,”Senior Brother Han Xun, senior brother Tian Chui, Senior Sister, come to the fighting stage!”</p><p>Eh?</p><p>The few of them were stunned and stepped onto the fighting ring one after another.</p><p>“Senior Brother Han Xun, this royal domain pill is for you!”</p><p>Lu Ming poured out a royal domain pill and handed it to han Xun.</p><p>Han Xun was stunned for a moment, then he quickly declined,”I can’t accept this. The rules of the guild state that only the last person to stay will receive the reward. You are the last person, so the reward naturally belongs to you!”</p><p>Han Xun shook his head.</p><p>“There’s no need to be so polite, senior Brother Han Xun. You’ve been severely injured in your battle with Saint Yu, and you deserve this royal domain pill!”</p><p>Lu Ming said and handed the Royal pill over.</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming’s sincere attitude, han Xun hesitated for a moment before saying,”Then I’ll have to thank Junior Brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>With that, he took the Royal domain pill and revealed a look of joy.</p><p>The Royal domain elixir was also of great help to him. With the help of the Royal domain elixir, he would be able to break through to the seventh level martial Royal realm very soon. How could he not be happy?</p><p>senior brother, Senior Sister, there are six left. Let’s each take two!</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Tian Chui and Xue ningxin.</p><p>no, this battle is all thanks to you, Junior Brother. You were only able to get first place because of yourself. We didn’t help much.</p><p>Xue ningxin shook her head.</p><p>“That’s right, I can’t be at ease if you split it evenly with us!”</p><p>Tian Chui also refused.</p><p>“How about this, one for each of you?”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>Tian Chui and Xue ningxin hesitated for a moment before finally agreeing.</p><p>He gave one each to Tian Chui and Xue ningxin. Lu Ming kept the remaining four royal domain pills.</p><p>Four royal domain pills should be able to improve his cultivation.</p><p>“Wait a moment!”</p><p>At this moment, a few figures stepped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>They were he Yu, the Silver City, and several other disciples of the silver Dragon Valley.</p><p>The one who had spoken earlier was he Yu.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re just going to keep the rest of the Royal domain pills? So many of us senior and junior brothers are participating in this small meeting, do you want to enjoy it alone?”</p><p>He Yu sneered.</p><p>“Oh? What do you want?”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>“Of course we’re going to share it!”</p><p>He Yu sneered.</p><p>“Take it out to share? The rules of this meeting state that only the last person standing will receive the reward. Why should we share the Royal domain pill that Junior Brother Lu Ming obtained?”</p><p>Tian Chui unhappily berated.</p><p>Hmph, all of us have contributed to Lu Ming’s survival in the end. How can we not share the credit? ”</p><p>He Yu said.</p><p>“Contribution?”</p><p>Lu Ming said as he looked at he Yu in disdain. you’re afraid of death and didn’t respect the arrangements. You were the first to charge forward and deliberately lost. Is this your credit? ”</p><p>I did this on purpose to keep myself alive. Otherwise, I would have died in vain. Moreover, when we first faced such a situation and lost so many of our senior and junior brothers, it was all because you offended the three major sects of the tianshen sect!</p><p>He Yuyu argued and even made a countercharge in the end.</p><p>“Oh? Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently. Suddenly, Lu Ming moved. He took a step forward and slapped he Yu.</p><p>He Yu was shocked. He had never expected Lu Ming to attack him all of a sudden.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>The crisp sound of a slap rang out. Lu Ming’s palm landed directly on he Yu’s face. He Yu’s body was sent flying like a sandbag and he landed heavily on the ground below the fighting ring. Half of his face had been smashed.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to waste his breath on such a person.</p><p>If he could, he would try his best.</p><p>He Yu was completely dumbfounded. He lay on the ground, covering the half of his face that had been slapped and staring at Lu Ming in a daze.</p><p>“What right does a piece of trash like you have to split the Royal domain pill?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>At this moment, he Yu finally reacted and shouted crazily, ” “Lu Ming, you’re audacious and lawless. Do you think you can do whatever you want just because you have some strength? Fellow brothers and sisters, am I right? we all have made contributions, so why should he enjoy the rewards alone?”</p><p>He Yu’s gaze turned to the youths from Dragon God Valley who had participated in the small meeting.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
