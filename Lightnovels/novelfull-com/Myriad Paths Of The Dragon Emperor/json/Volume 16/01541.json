Take it!”</p><p>The Saint realm elder of Dragon God Valley said.</p><p>...</p><p>“Many thanks, elder!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not stand on ceremony. He put away the Holy weapon, the small tower, and of course, mo he’s storage ring. These were all his spoils of war. He took them without any hesitation.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>The elder of the Tian Yu demonic sect cast a cold glance at Lu Ming, then turned around and returned to the pavilion.</p><p>The elders of the other sects also returned to their pavilions one by one.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ve done well. You’ve made a great contribution this time. The sect will definitely reward you according to your contributions!”</p><p>The Saint realm elder of Dragon God Valley said with a smile.</p><p>This made he Yu and the others from the Silver City jealous.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and returned to the tenth platform. He sat down cross-legged and waved his hand. A large pile of raw gemstones appeared. Lu Ming devoured the raw gemstones and began to recover.</p><p>In the battle just now, Lu Ming had also consumed a lot of his essential core and he did not have much of it left.</p><p>On the stands, everyone’s gaze fell on Lu Ming with deep fear.</p><p>Three top-notch geniuses had already died at Lu Ming’s hands in this small meeting.</p><p>If mo he did not use his holy weapon, he would have been killed by Lu Ming. Therefore, it was the same as being killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>There were three top-notch heaven’s favorites. The tianshen sect, the Tianyu demonic sect, and the Yudu sect each had one.</p><p>This was truly a heavy loss.</p><p>In the past, such a situation rarely occurred.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming’s cultivation was only at the peak of the fourth level Martial Emperor realm. It was simply a miracle that he had such a battle record.</p><p>In the treasure auction, it was extremely difficult and rare to kill a sixth level martial Royal realm heaven’s pride expert. However, Lu Ming had killed three of them this time.</p><p>It should be known that the divine Son had only killed two heaven’s favorites of this level when he participated in the treasure auction.</p><p>And now, the Divine Child was the head of the ten great monsters.</p><p>Lu Ming had already broken the record of the divine Son.</p><p>The thirteen sects and forces all had different thoughts in their minds.</p><p>The challenge continued!</p><p>After Lu Ming’s challenge, it was the demon castle’s turn on platform No. 13.</p><p>This was because poyuan family on platform 11 and blood demon tower on platform 12 had already been eliminated.</p><p>After the demon Castle challenge ended, this round also ended.</p><p>Next, it was a new round, and it was the turn of the Tian Shen sect.</p><p>The people of the heavenly God sect looked at Lu Ming with deep fear. Then, they sent one person to challenge the other sects.</p><p>Next, it was the Tian Yu demon sect’s turn. Although they wanted to avenge mo he, no one dared to challenge Lu Ming. They could only challenge the other sects.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged on the platform alone, but no one dared to fight.</p><p>Soon, it was the desire poison sect’s turn.</p><p>The desire poison sect still had a top genius who had defeated Tian Chui earlier. However, when he looked at Lu Ming, his eyes were filled with fear. He did not dare to challenge Lu Ming, so he sent another person to challenge the other sects.</p><p>When it was Dragon God Valley’s turn again, no one dared to challenge Lu Ming.</p><p>When it was Lu Ming’s turn again, everyone’s eyes fell on him. They did not know who Lu Ming was going to challenge this time.</p><p>Everyone was nervous.</p><p>This was especially so for the three major sects, the deity sect, the sky demon sect, and the Yu Du sect. Anyone who was challenged by Lu Ming would be courting death.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped onto the platform. After the cultivation just now, his essential core had been fully recovered. The devouring power and the speed of devouring raw gemstones to recover his essential core was shocking. No one could compare to it.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze fell directly on the desire poison sect’s side, challenging the only remaining top-notch expert of the desire poison sect.</p><p>Just now, this person had challenged Tian Chui, so he would not let him off easily.</p><p>The Yu Du sect’s expert stepped onto the fighting stage with an ugly expression. However, the moment he stepped onto the fighting stage, he immediately rushed to the back.</p><p>He wanted to rush off the fighting ring.</p><p>Many people were speechless.</p><p>This person had a superior-grade earth spiritual body, an existence on par with mo he, Wu Qian Du, and the others. However, he didn’t even dare to fight and wanted to rush down the fighting stage.</p><p>It could be seen that this person was very afraid of Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming charged toward the person.</p><p>However, this person’s spirit body was highly toxic and his life force was extremely tenacious. Moreover, he was determined to escape and did not want to fight at all. It was very difficult for Lu Ming to kill him on this small fighting ring.</p><p>In the end, the other party successfully rushed out of the fighting ring, even though he was injured.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in pity.</p><p>As a result, the seven top experts of the three great sects, the deity sect, the sky demon sect, and the Yu Du sect, were all defeated. Some died, and some were defeated. The competition ended early.</p><p>There was not much suspense in the following matches.</p><p>Lu Ming was in charge alone and no one dared to fight.</p><p>Every time it was Lu Ming’s turn, he would choose a heaven’s God sect’s Paragon to kill.</p><p>This made the heaven’s pride experts on the platform of the tianshen sect scared to death. In the end, in order to survive, when they challenged others, they deliberately admitted defeat and rushed down the fighting stage.</p><p>They even challenged the Tianyu demonic sect and the Yudu sect in order to preserve more people’s lives.</p><p>The three great sects had actually been forced to such a state by Lu Ming alone. This was a rare sight in history. After this battle, Lu Ming’s name was destined to spread throughout the entire Azure continent.</p><p>The challenges continued.</p><p>Because the Tian Shen sect’s method was equivalent to admitting defeat, they were the first to be completely annihilated among the remaining ten sects.</p><p>this move of the heaven God sect is really beautiful. Where did you learn it? ”</p><p>Someone from the Dragon God Valley mocked.</p><p>The disciples of the heaven God sect on the grandstand all blushed, but no one refuted.</p><p>Because he really had no face to refute.</p><p>Before the treasure settling small meeting, the heavenly God sect had announced that they would win three consecutive championships. But now, it had completely become a joke.</p><p>If not for the fact that they had used the right tactics and eliminated the three weakest sects in advance, they might not even have made it into the top ten.</p><p>After the divine heaven sect was eliminated, Lu Ming set his sights on the desire poison sect.</p><p>Considering that Xie nianqing was the Holy Virgin of the Tian Yu demonic sect, Lu Ming did not continue to challenge the other disciples of the Tian Yu demonic sect after killing mo he. This made the disciples of the Tian Yu demonic sect heave a sigh of relief.</p><p>As for the Yu Du sect, they were in a miserable state. Each and every one of them was trembling with fear. In the end, they simply adopted the method of the Tian Shen sect and became the second sect to be eliminated.</p><p>As the competition went on, the number of people left from the major sects decreased.</p><p>Even the life-and-death Sword sect only had a few people left.</p><p>This battle was the same as the previous ones. Although the life and death Sword sect had fewer people, they were all elites with terrifying combat strength.</p><p>As for Luo Xiang, he had also risen in this battle. With his cultivation at the fifth level of the martial Royal realm, he had killed several sixth level martial Royal realm geniuses in a row. His combat strength was extremely shocking.</p><p>Gradually, one sect after another was completely annihilated. However, there was still one person sitting cross-legged on the tenth platform.</p><p>Lu Ming!</p><p>Long ago, Lu Ming was the only one left in Dragon God Valley. However, he was as steady as a rock and did not move.</p><p>in the end, Lu Ming won’t be the last one to let Dragon God Valley take first place, will he? ”</p><p>Someone muttered, causing many people to look at each other.</p><p>If that was the case, it would be a legend that would be passed down for hundreds of generations.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>With a flash of sword light, Luo Xiang stepped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>“Lu Ming, why don’t you and I have a spar?”</p><p>Luo Xiang looked at Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
