Similarly, when you want to put them away, you can put them away with a thought!</p><p>The young woman introduced.</p><p>...</p><p>“What an amazing pair of gloves!”</p><p>“Such a pair of gloves is a rare treasure in the world!”</p><p>On the side, many people’s eyes were burning with passion as they stared at the gloves in the young woman’s hands.</p><p>For martial artists who were good at palm, finger, and fist techniques, this kind of glove was too precious. The temptation was too great.</p><p>“Miss, I want this pair of gloves. How much are you selling it for?”</p><p>“I want one too. Miss, how many raw stones?”</p><p>Immediately, a few people spoke and stepped forward.</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his eyebrows. He was the one who asked first.</p><p>I’m sorry, the flowing essence gloves. As the materials are hard to find and the refining process is also very difficult, I only have one!</p><p>The young woman said.</p><p>“Only one? Then sell it to me!”</p><p>“Get lost, it’s mine!”</p><p>At least a dozen people spoke, and the scene was noisy.</p><p>this glove is worth 500 million medium-grade raw stones. No bargaining!</p><p>The young woman said.</p><p>“What? 500 million?”</p><p>The scene suddenly quieted down, and a series of gasps sounded.</p><p>“Five … 500 million medium-grade raw stones? Miss, a glove?”</p><p>The voice of the person who had asked to buy earlier was a little dry.</p><p>Gloves were a bit more expensive than normal Saint weapons, but they usually came in pairs. A decent pair of gloves could be worth three normal Saint weapons.</p><p>A Saint weapon was worth around 100 million mid-grade orirocks. He’d originally estimated this glove to be worth around 150 million, but now it was asking for 500 million.</p><p>The price was shockingly high.</p><p>“It’s too high, I can’t afford it at all!”</p><p>“It’s not worth it!”</p><p>Those people shook their heads and gave up on buying.</p><p>Five hundred million was too expensive.</p><p>“500 million!”</p><p>Lu Ming also took a deep breath in his heart.</p><p>Five hundred million was equivalent to five bright Saint weapons.</p><p>He had obtained four bright Saint weapons in the Dragon Palace’s Treasury, the Black Dragon Spear. Lu Ming wanted to keep it for his own use, so he only had three bright Saint weapons left. Even if he sold all three, he was still short of two hundred million mid-grade raw stones.</p><p>All the raw gemstones he had on him were not enough for 200 million. He would only have enough if he sold a lot of precious refining materials.</p><p>“Young lady, do you accept holy weapons here?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“I received it!”</p><p>The young woman smiled.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and three bright Saint weapons appeared in his hand. They were all obtained from the Dragon Palace’s treasure vault.</p><p>“Three Saint weapons!”</p><p>Many people’s eyes lit up and they stared at Lu Ming. Their eyes were shimmering with all sorts of lights, and no one knew what they were thinking.</p><p>Sir, if you want to buy flowing essence gloves, you can use bright Saint weapons as payment. These three bright Saint weapons and two hundred million orirocks will do!</p><p>The young woman said.</p><p>However, Lu Ming still looked hesitant. It was not that he did not want to pay, but he had no more.</p><p>He still had a shield and the black wings, but he wanted to keep both.</p><p>“Junior Brother, I’ll lend you two Saint weapons first!”</p><p>As if reading Lu Ming’s mind, Tian Chui waved his hand and two more holy weapons appeared.</p><p>“Senior brother, you …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>“I have enough for now!”</p><p>Tian Chui laughed.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll return it to senior as soon as possible!”</p><p>Lu Ming accepted Tian Chui’s holy weapon and said,”Miss, I’ll buy the flowing elemental gloves for five holy weapons!”</p><p>“Sure!”</p><p>The young lady took Lu Ming’s holy weapon, put the flowing essence gloves into the box, and handed it to him.</p><p>Lu Ming took it and reached out to hold the flowing elemental gloves that had turned back into a round ball.</p><p>It was warm and cool to the touch. He infused his essential core slightly and the flowing essence glove started to flow like liquid, wrapping around Lu Ming’s right palm.</p><p>“As light as nothing!”</p><p>Lu Ming sensed it carefully.</p><p>The Liuyuan gloves were as light as chiffon on his hands. He was almost weightless and as flexible as if he was empty-handed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As he poured in more vital essence, the flowing essence gloves emitted a powerful aura.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly stunned. He realized that the flowing essence gloves ‘weight had increased rapidly as he channeled his essential core into the gloves. The stronger the essential core, the heavier the gloves were.</p><p>Lu Ming was pleasantly surprised that the flowing essence gloves had such an effect.</p><p>“Are you satisfied, Sir?”</p><p>The young woman said.</p><p>“Many thanks!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not say much. With a thought, he kept the flowing elements gloves. If he wanted to use them freely, he would need to go back and refine them.</p><p>At the side, many pairs of burning eyes were staring at Lu Ming.</p><p>Some of their eyes were filled with greed.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. In the treasure Pavilion, these people did not dare to do anything to him.</p><p>Lu Ming swaggered around with Xue ningxin and the heavenly hammer.</p><p>“That is … Icy heart!”</p><p>Not long after, on a counter, Xue ningxin found a Heart of Ice.</p><p>This was a rare treasure. Xue ningxin’s original form was a Snow Dragon, so it was of great use to her.</p><p>In the end, Xue ningxin used two Saint weapons in exchange for the Heart of Ice.</p><p>“So many Saint weapons! These three guys have so many Saint weapons!”</p><p>Some people had been paying attention to Lu Ming and the other two. When they saw this scene, their eyes burned even more fervently.</p><p>In total, Lu Ming, Tian Chui, and Xue ningxin had already taken out seven Saint weapons. How shocking was this?</p><p>senior brother, Senior Sister, we’re being watched. Next, we’ll split up and mix into the crowd to divert attention!</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Tian Chui and Xue ningxin.</p><p>There were close to 200000 people on the three levels of the Supreme treasure Pavilion. At least half of them were wearing black robes and bamboo hats. As long as they mixed into the crowd and kept walking around, these people could forget about finding them.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>“Let’s do this!”</p><p>Tian Chui and Xue ningxin both nodded.</p><p>Then, the three of them split up and rushed into the crowd.</p><p>“Not good, these guys want to run, chase them!”</p><p>Someone followed Lu Ming and the rest closely.</p><p>However, Lu Ming and the other two had concealed their auras. The other party could not lock onto their auras at all. The three of them moved quickly through the crowd. They would reach the first floor, turn dozens of times, run to the second floor, and then to the third floor.</p><p>An hour later, those people had completely lost track of Lu Ming and the other two.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>“What a pity!”</p><p>Some people sighed. Lu Ming and the other two definitely had an astonishing amount of wealth on them. If they could snatch it, they would be rich. Unfortunately, Lu Ming and the other two were too cunning. They slipped away just like that, making some people very unwilling.</p><p>Two hours later, Lu Ming, Tian Chui, and Xue ningxin gathered at the main entrance through voice transmission.</p><p>They had bought what they needed and it was time to leave.</p><p>The three of them went out of the gate and flew toward the Dragon God Valley.</p><p>However, after flying for a while, the three of them suddenly stopped.</p><p>In front of them, three figures wrapped in black robes blocked their way.</p><p>“Everyone, hand over your storage rings and get lost!”</p><p>The person in the middle spoke. From his voice, he sounded very young.</p><p>“You guys are really capable!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. They were already very careful but they were still targeted.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
