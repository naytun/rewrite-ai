It was confusing.</p><p>...</p><p>However, the people of the three sects were indeed in a sorry state.</p><p>“Brat, when the sage realm expert of my tianshen sect descends, you will be dead!”</p><p>Yu Sheng roared.</p><p>that’s right. There’s also the sage realm experts of my Yu Du sect. They’ll arrive soon. Even if you hide in the hurricane, you’ll still die!</p><p>Someone from the desire poison sect also roared.</p><p>He was really furious.</p><p>Lu Ming was cheating by hiding in the tornado. He could only chase after them while they could only escape. They could not fight back. If they did, they would be courting death.</p><p>Don’t even mention how aggrieved he was.</p><p>Lu Ming did not care and focused on controlling the tornado to pursue.</p><p>However, the members of the three major sects had learned their lesson and stayed away from all the tornadoes. This way, even if Lu Ming could control the other tornadoes, he would not be able to kill the members of the three major sects.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming glared at Mo Yang and chased him around the area for more than ten rounds. His face was the color of a pig’s liver because of anger and grievance.</p><p>After chasing for a while, when he was far away, Lu Ming silently exited the tornado. Then, he changed his figure and aura and arrived not far from Tian Chui and the rest.</p><p>The tornadoes had stopped, but the people of the three sects were still cautious and stayed away from any tornadoes.</p><p>After a long while, the tornado didn’t move at all. The people of the three sects let out a long breath.</p><p>However, the eyes of the people from the three sects were burning with a terrifying fire.</p><p>They knew that they had been fooled by Lu Ming. If this matter was spread, the three major sects would lose all their face.</p><p>Mo Yang, in particular, was even more furious.</p><p>Just like that, time passed by quickly as the people of the three major sects were on high alert.</p><p>An hour later.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A white holy light flashed in the sky, and an old man in a white robe appeared.</p><p>“Elder, the sage realm elder of my heaven God sect has arrived!”</p><p>The people of the heavenly God sect were overjoyed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Following that, air-piercing sounds rang out continuously. At least seven to eight figures appeared in the sky, each of them exuding a vast pressure.</p><p>It was the might of a Saint. The people who had come were All Saints.</p><p>Some of them were wearing green robes while others were wearing white robes. They were Saint realm experts from the Yu Du sect and the Tian Shen sect. Three Saint realm experts from each of the two sects had come.</p><p>The other two saints were not from the two sects. They were probably from the small forces nearby.</p><p>Some small sects and forces also had Saint realm experts.</p><p>Some of the sects were not weak, only slightly weaker than the 13 top sects.</p><p>The eight Saints stood in the air, looking at the mountain in front of them. To be more precise, they were looking at the Phoenix shadow.</p><p>what a powerful aura! This is at least an absolute Saint weapon, or even more!</p><p>A Sage expert of the tianshen sect spoke, his eyes revealing a burning light.</p><p>The other sages were also excited.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>All of a sudden, a Saint from the tianshen sect moved. He took a step forward, and the whole world rumbled. A milky-white Saint light shot up from his body. Finally, the infinite Saint light condensed into a battle blade.</p><p>The saber was at least tens of thousands of meters long. It crossed the void and slashed at the tornadoes in front of him.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The blade of holy light struck the tornado and made an ear-piercing sound.</p><p>The terrifying wind was like an infinite blade, constantly hitting the blade of holy light. The space was shaking.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The sage of the tianshen sect roared. The aura on his body was even more terrifying. The light of his holy light battle blade shone brightly as he tried to split the tornado.</p><p>The huge blade of holy light actually cut into the tornado.</p><p>Many people held their breath and looked forward with wide eyes.</p><p>Could a Saint stage powerhouse break through the tornado?</p><p>However, when the Holy Light battle blade was cut halfway, it was finally slashed by the endless wind blades and exploded.</p><p>The sage realm expert of the heavenly God sect had failed.</p><p>In the distance, Lu Ming’s expression was still very solemn.</p><p>the strength of a Saint stage powerhouse is truly terrifying!</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>He knew very well how powerful the tornado was. If a half-Saint entered, he would die without even being able to resist. However, the Saint realm expert just now could actually split the tornado in half and almost completely split it in half. His strength was truly terrifying.</p><p>Faced with such an expert, Lu Ming would not be safe even if he used the air-frozen bead to hide in the tornado.</p><p>“The hurricane here is too strong. One person can’t break it. How about we join forces?” Jiang Chen said.</p><p>A Saint from the Yu Du sect said.</p><p>“Join forces? How will we split the treasures after we enter?”</p><p>One of the sages from the heavenly God sect said.</p><p>“After entering, of course it’ll be based on your own ability. Whoever gets it will get it!”</p><p>A Saint from the desire poison sect said.</p><p>“Alright, we agree!”</p><p>The three sages of the heavenly God sect nodded at the same time.</p><p>The other two saints from the small sects nodded in agreement.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The eight Saints released terrifying auras at the same time. Their boundless saintly might filled the air.</p><p>At the same time, a Saint weapon rushed out of each of the eight, shining with brilliant light.</p><p>The power of a Saint weapon in the hands of a Saint was completely different from that of anyone below the Saint realm. It was terrifying.</p><p>Then, all eight of them struck out at the same time. All eight of their Saint weapons struck at the tornado.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The tornado shook violently.</p><p>The tornado was powerful, but it couldn’t stop the combined attack of Eight Saints.</p><p>After a loud boom, the tornado exploded and turned into a violent wind that scattered in all directions.</p><p>One of the tornadoes was broken. Many people’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>One of the sages from the heavenly God sect said.</p><p>Then, the eight sages continued to attack. Terrifying attacks were continuously launched.</p><p>The tornadoes were destroyed by the eight people’s attacks, turning into wind energy and dissipating.</p><p>Soon, at least a dozen tornadoes were blown apart, and a huge gap appeared in the tornadoes surrounding the mountain.</p><p>Everyone could clearly see the situation inside the mountain.</p><p>At the bottom of the mountain, there was a huge cave. Bright light filled the cave.</p><p>Surprisingly, the other tornadoes around the mountain didn’t move. They didn’t fill up the gap.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, a sage realm elder of the heaven God sect turned into a ray of light and rushed toward the mountain.</p><p>In an instant, he rushed out of the hurricane’s range.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>The people from the desire poison sect roared and rushed forward as well. In the blink of an eye, the eight sages had rushed into the region enveloped by the hurricane and into the cave.</p><p>“Let’s go in and take a look!”</p><p>The others couldn’t hold it in any longer. After seeing the eight Saints rush in, some others also rushed into the cave.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
