It was almost an instant kill. This was too shocking.</p><p>he’s a heaven’s favorite, a peerless heaven’s favorite! He must be a peerless heaven’s favorite from Dragon God Valley!</p><p>...</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila’s grandfather was so excited that his entire body was trembling.</p><p>He was definitely a peerless heaven’s favorite, and an extremely terrifying one at that. To be honest, he had lived for so long, but he had never heard of such a person. What else could he be if not a peerless heaven’s favorite?</p><p>that’s amazing. Young master Lu Ming is actually so powerful? ”</p><p>Liu Wanjun was also dumbfounded.</p><p>Then, at the thought that Lu Ming had already taken Xiangxiang as his disciple, she was extremely happy.</p><p>For such a genius to take Xiangxiang as a disciple, this was Xiangxiang’s great fortune.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming reached out his palm and sucked the long spear of the LV 9 martial Royal realm elder into his hand.</p><p>“Do you all still want to continue fighting?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Zhao Tianba and the rest coldly.</p><p>Zhao Tianba and the others all shivered, their faces pale.</p><p>Fight again? How to fight?</p><p>Even the Zhao clan’s most powerful great elder, a Lv 9 martial Royal realm expert who wielded a holy weapon, was killed by Lu Ming in two moves. What could they do to fight? Are you looking for death?</p><p>if you don’t want to fight, then make a blood oath that you will never invade the Lu clan. Let me tell you, Dragon God Valley will protect the Lu clan from now on!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“You … Are you from the Dragon God Valley?”</p><p>Zhao Tianba spoke with great difficulty.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>so, it’s the pride of the Dragon God Valley. We were blind to not know that the Lu clan has a connection with the Dragon God Valley. We swear now that we will never invade the Lu clan ever again!</p><p>Zhao Tianba hurriedly said.</p><p>Upon hearing that Lu Ming was from Dragon God Valley, Zhao Tianba had completely given up on the idea of attacking the Lu clan.</p><p>Lu Ming, who was only at the sixth level of the martial Royal realm, could easily kill a ninth level martial Royal realm expert. Such a heaven’s favorite was definitely a rare one in Dragon God Valley. His status was not to be underestimated.</p><p>If they disobeyed such a person, they would not dare to invade the Lu clan’s Castle even if they were given a hundred times more guts, unless the Zhao clan wanted to be destroyed.</p><p>At once, Zhao Tianba and the higher-ups of the Zhao clan swore a blood oath that they would never invade the Lu clan’s Castle again. Then, they boarded the warship and left.</p><p>Hu …</p><p>The people from the Lu clan’s Fort heaved a long sigh of relief, knowing that they had dodged a calamity.</p><p>“I’m lu Zhenghao. Thank you for your help, young master Lu Ming!”</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila’s grandfather came to Lu Ming and gave him a fist salute.</p><p>senior, you don’t have to be so polite. I’m Xiangxiang’s master, so I naturally won’t sit idly by!</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Young master Lu Ming, please come in!”</p><p>Lu Zhenghao quickly invited Lu Ming into the Lu clan Fort.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and went into the Lu clan Fort with Lu Zhenghao and the rest.</p><p>Lu Zhenghao immediately ordered the servants to prepare a banquet to celebrate Xiangxiang’s apprenticeship.</p><p>After the banquet, Lu Ming, Lu Zhenghao, Liu Wanjun, and the higher-ups of the Lu clan sat on both sides of the hall. Of course, little Xiangxiang was beside Liu Wanjun.</p><p>The higher-ups of the Lu family were overjoyed.</p><p>Since Xiangxiang Beila was able to become Lu Ming’s disciple, she could be considered to have established a connection with the Dragon God Valley. In the future, with the Dragon God Valley as her backing, no one would dare to touch the Lu clan’s Fort in this area.</p><p>“Xiangxiang, come here!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Xiangxiang.</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila came to Lu Ming obediently.</p><p>A storage ring appeared in Lu Ming’s hand. He put it on Xiangxiang Beila and said, ” I have something to do during this period of time. I can’t bring you back to Dragon God Valley to cultivate for a while!</p><p>“There are some spirit herbs and elixirs in here that can assist you in your cultivation. There are also some spirit weapons, inscription scrolls, and so on. You can keep them for your use!”</p><p>“Thank you, master!”</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila said obediently.</p><p>yes, I will be back in a year and take you back to Dragon God Valley!</p><p>With that, Lu Ming’s body glowed and he tapped the area between Xiangxiang Beila’s eyebrows three times.”I’ve left three marks on your body. Each mark has the power of a full-force attack from me. If anyone tries to harm you, the mark will appear and kill them!”</p><p>His words made some of the Lu clan’s people’s hearts tremble.</p><p>They knew that Lu Ming’s words were meant for them. Lu Ming had just given Xiangxiang a storage ring. With his status, he would definitely not hold back. Some people would inevitably be greedy.</p><p>However, his words made some people’s greed disappear completely.</p><p>clan head Lu, I’ll be staying at the Lu clan Fort for a few days. First, I’ll bring Xiangxiang to cultivate and let her join us. Second, I know a little about the Dao of inscriptions. I’ll set up a large array around the Lu clan Fort in the next few days. Even a half-Saint won’t be able to break it in a short time!</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Lu Zhenghao.</p><p>Lu Zhenghao was overjoyed. He thanked Lu Ming repeatedly.</p><p>“Xiangxiang, follow me!”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming pulled Xiangxiang Beila, took a step forward, and disappeared.</p><p>After a while, Lu Ming brought Xiangxiang Beila and appeared on a mountain peak not far away. Then, Lu Ming’s glabella glowed, and Ming Lian walked out.</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila looked at the two identical Lu Mings in astonishment. Her dark eyes were filled with curiosity.</p><p>The second clone smiled and took a step forward. He appeared around the Lu clan’s Castle and began to inscribe a defensive formation.</p><p>He had put in so much effort because, firstly, he felt guilty towards the Lu clan. Secondly, Xiangxiang was going to stay in the Lu clan for the next year. He was also thinking about her safety.</p><p>The inscription clone began to inscribe the formation, while Lu Ming took over and taught Xiangxiang Beila how to cultivate.</p><p>Before Xiangxiang Beila started cultivating, her bloodline had yet to awaken. Now, the first step was to help her awaken her bloodline and enter the first level of martial cultivation, the connective Meridian level.</p><p>“Xiangxiang, sit properly and do as I say!”</p><p>Lu Ming instructed.</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila sat cross-legged on the ground obediently.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated his essential core and tapped a few hundred times around Xiangxiang Beila’s body. Streams of essential core flowed into her body.</p><p>After a while, Xiangxiang Beila’s body started to emit a green radiance.</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming discovered a shocking scene.</p><p>The grass around Xiangxiang Beila began to grow rapidly. In a short while, the grass had grown taller than Lu Ming and drowned him and Xiangxiang Beila.</p><p>Lu Ming’s essential core shook and the grass turned into powder.</p><p>However, there were still grass growing on the ground, and the green light on Xiangxiang Beila’s body was getting stronger.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a green ball of light flew out from Xiang Xiang’s spine.</p><p>On the green ball of light, there were nine golden chakras that were shining.</p><p>divine level ninth rank bloodline, this …</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p><p>This ball of light was, without a doubt, a bloodline. But wasn’t this the first bloodline? How could it be a level nine divine level expert?</p><p>It had directly reached the highest level. What was going on?</p><p>Lu Ming’s spiritual sense entered Xiangxiang Beila’s body and sensed it carefully.</p><p>“Amazing, it’s really amazing. It seems like there’s only one bloodline!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s current cultivation level was very high. In addition to the secret skill in the nine Dragons ‘memory that could see through one’s talent, he could naturally sense it very clearly.</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila seemed to only have one bloodline. In the future, when she cultivated, she would not be like others who would awaken a second or third bloodline. No wonder she was a level nine divine level expert the moment she appeared.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
