Bai Mo’s combat strength was absolutely amazing. With his cultivation at the peak of the sixth level martial Royal realm, he might be able to kill an expert at the eighth level.</p><p>“White God sword formation!”</p><p>...</p><p>After Bai mo rushed out of the nine seals of the gate of God, he growled. His eyes turned completely white, and there were strange lines in his eyes.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the sky, a dense pattern suddenly appeared, like a huge white array.</p><p>Following that, white lines also appeared under Lu Ming’s feet. It looked like a large array.</p><p>One from above and one from below, they surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>this isn’t a formation. It’s a secret technique that belongs to the spirit body!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Some powerful spirit bodies would develop some secret skills that belonged to the spirit body. To put it bluntly, they were brought over by the bloodline.</p><p>For example, Lu Ming’s devouring power was brought over by the nine Dragons ‘bloodline. He condensed the Dragon God’s body and still retained the devouring power.</p><p>Other bloodlines, after turning into spirit bodies, might also retain some powerful innate secret skills.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Boundless sword Qi condensed from the two images and poured toward Lu Ming.</p><p>In all directions, Lu Ming had no way to retreat.</p><p>“Wind elemental technique!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. From the air-frozen bead, a green energy gushed into Lu Ming’s body. Lu Ming cast the wind element art and his body seemed to turn into a breeze, floating in the void.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body swayed, leaving a trail of afterimages behind him. He flickered among the endless sword Qi and dodged the sword Qi.</p><p>However, there were too many sword auras. In such a narrow space, no matter how fast Lu Ming’s movement technique was, he could not completely avoid them.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>An extremely sharp sword Qi was aimed at Lu Ming’s chest.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was covered with the chaos realm. It resisted the sword Qi and there were sizzling sounds. The sword Qi actually pierced through the chaos realm and stabbed Lu Ming’s chest.</p><p>It was not that the chaos realm was not strong. First of all, this kind of sword Qi was really terrifying. Secondly, Lu Ming’s chaos realm was too low level, only level four. At least for Bai mo, his level was too low, so he could not defend against it.</p><p>If it had been a fifth-level Primal Chaos Domain, this sword Qi would definitely not have been able to break through its defense.</p><p>However, the primal Chaos Domain had also greatly weakened the sword Qi’s power.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At that moment, a Dragon’s Roar came from Lu Ming’s body, and a layer of dragon scales appeared on his body.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sword Qi slashed at the Dragon scale, causing sparks to fly in all directions. The sword Qi was shattered, and the Dragon scale on Lu Ming’s chest was slightly damaged, revealing a trace of blood.</p><p>“What a terrifying sword Qi!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>The upper and lower patterns contained boundless sword Qi. Even a Lv 8 martial Royal realm expert would be cut down by them.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>More energy poured into the air-frozen bead. Lu Ming circulated the wind element art to the extreme and his speed increased. The sky was filled with Lu Ming’s figure.</p><p>However, Lu Ming could not rush out of the range of the two diagrams, as they covered the entire fighting ring. If he did, it would mean that he had rushed out of the fighting ring and he would lose this round.</p><p>If it was anywhere else, Lu Ming would have rushed out.</p><p>“Haha, under senior brother Bai Mo’s eye technique, the White God sword formation, Lu Ming is dead!”</p><p>that’s right. Senior brother Bai Mo’s eye technique has killed many high-level martial emperors. Once you fall into it, unless your cultivation is too high, you will only die!</p><p>Hmph, this Lu Ming actually took the initiative to challenge senior brother Bai mo. He’s really looking for death!</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming was in danger, the disciples of the heavenly God sect were in a good mood. They could not help but mock and gloat at.</p><p>On the Dragon God valley side, Tian Chui and Xue ningxin were a little worried.</p><p>On the fighting ring, Bai Mo’s eyes turned completely white. There were lines on his eyes, which were exactly the same as the two patterns.</p><p>Bai mo stepped into the void and landed on the pattern above. The area on his body seemed to merge with the pattern. Suddenly, the pattern became even more terrifying. The sword Qi whistled and the speed increased greatly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, today is the day you die!”</p><p>Bai mo said indifferently.</p><p>“It’s too early for you to be happy!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s indifferent voice was heard. At the same time, he continued to form seals with his hands.</p><p>“Gate of God, nine seals!”</p><p>A deep voice was heard as six sealing gates appeared.</p><p>However, this time, the sealing door was not aimed at Bai mo, but at Lu Ming himself.</p><p>The six gates of sealing hovered around Lu Ming and shone with a brilliant light. The sword Qi that was aimed at Lu Ming was actually sealed by the power of the gates of sealing and stopped in mid-air.</p><p>Nine Dragons trampling the heavens!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took nine steps in a row. The power of the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps burst forth, dispersing the sword Qi below. With the help of this force, Lu Ming soared into the sky. The Emperor spiritual weapon spear had appeared in his hands again.</p><p>He and the spear became one, and he launched thirteen strikes. He rushed to the sky and attacked Bai mo.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>In the process of soaring into the sky, two jet-black divine swords burst out from Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>Godly sword technique!</p><p>The godly sword technique was a soul attack. It broke through the pattern that Bai mo had laid and rushed into Bai Mo’s body.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>At this moment, Bai mo let out a shrill scream, as if his soul was about to be torn apart.</p><p>As a martial monarch’s cultivation level increased, his spiritual God would become stronger. At the same time, his soul would also become stronger.</p><p>The higher the realm, the stronger the soul power.</p><p>Lu Ming’s soul had been refined by the world refining tribulation Bell. It was broken and then rebuilt. The strength of his soul was dozens of times stronger than martial artists of the same level. Moreover, he had been cultivating the divine sword technique during this period of time. His soul force had also become stronger.</p><p>If it was a martial artist of the same level as Lu Ming, Lu Ming could directly annihilate the soul of the other party with the divine sword technique.</p><p>Even a heaven’s favorite like Bai mo, whose cultivation was two levels higher than Lu Ming’s, felt as if his soul was about to split open at this time.</p><p>At this time, the two patterns under Bai Mo’s feet became dim.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming broke through the pattern directly, and the sharp spear pierced Bai Mo’s body directly.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Bai mo let out an unwilling scream, and then under Lu Ming’s destructive power, his body and spirit were destroyed.</p><p>Bai mo, die!</p><p>At this moment, the fighting ring suddenly fell silent. Almost everyone’s eyes were wide open as they stared at the fighting ring.</p><p>A moment ago, Lu Ming was completely suppressed and in danger, but the next moment, the situation was reversed. Lu Ming had killed Bai mo in one fell swoop.</p><p>This change was too fast, making everyone unable to react in time.</p><p>Bai mo was cut down, and the pattern on the fighting ring disappeared. Bai Mo’s body fell heavily on the fighting ring, which also woke everyone up.</p><p>The scene was in an uproar.</p><p>“Senior brother Bai mo!”</p><p>“Junior Brother Bai mo, ah, Lu Ming, you deserve to die!”</p><p>Furious roars rang out from the side of the heavenly Divine sect.</p><p>Bai mo had a superior-grade earth spiritual body. There were not many heaven’s favorites like him in the entire Tian Shen sect. Each one of them had the potential to become one of the top ten geniuses in the Cang region. In the future, they would be able to become martial Saints. They might even have the chance to become Supreme Saints.</p><p>To a sect, each and every one of these heaven’s favorites was an immeasurable treasure.</p><p>But now, Lu Ming had killed one of them. How could the people of the tianshen sect not be angry?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
