The three of them alighted from the spatial shuttle. After Lu Ming kept the spatial shuttle, the three of them stepped on the air and headed toward the Lu clan’s Fort.</p><p>“It’s young master Lu!”</p><p>...</p><p>The people from the Lu clan Fort immediately recognized Lu Ming and welcomed him into the Lu clan Fort.</p><p>“Junior Brother Lu Ming, I can’t believe you accepted a disciple here. I’d like to see it for myself!”</p><p>Tian Chui was extremely curious. Not only him, Xue ningxin was also the same.</p><p>They were still young. At this age, it was the golden age for cultivation. They would not usually take in disciples, because they would be distracted.</p><p>Only when they had reached a certain age, past the golden age of cultivation, would they consider taking in disciples.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming was so young and he had already accepted disciples. The disciple he accepted would definitely not be ordinary.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with anticipation.</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila’s talent was absolutely shocking. Now that they had not met for a year, what realm had Xiangxiang Beila’s cultivation base reached?</p><p>“Young master Lu!”</p><p>Lu Zhenghao came over from a distance.</p><p>patriarch Lu, these two are my senior brother and Senior Sister!</p><p>Lu Ming introduced Tian Chui and Xue ningxin to Lu Zhenghao.</p><p>Lu Zhenghao quickly saluted Tian Chui and Xue ningxin.</p><p>After that, everyone came to the main hall of the Lu family. After everyone took their seats, a maidservant naturally served them tea.</p><p>“Lu family head, where is Xiangxiang?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>Xiangxiang is cultivating in seclusion. I’ve already asked Wanjun to call her!</p><p>Lu Zhenghao said.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>“Patriarch Lu, I have a favor to ask of you!” Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>young master, please speak. As long as the Lu clan can do it, we will do our best to help!</p><p>Lu Zhenghao said.</p><p>clan head Lu, you’re being too serious. It’s not a big deal. I have some friends who would like to settle down in the Lu clan Fort. Is that possible? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Of course you can. How many people are there?”</p><p>Lu Zhenghao asked.</p><p>“A few hundred people, let’s go out and take a look!”</p><p>With that, Lu Ming walked out of the hall and into the courtyard outside the hall. Then, he waved his hand and Feng Ling and the Feng Family Village villagers all appeared in the courtyard.</p><p>As soon as Feng Ling and the others appeared, they started to look around.</p><p>“Feng Ling, village chief, it’s me!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“You are … Big brother Lu?”</p><p>Feng Ling widened her eyes and looked at Lu Ming in surprise.</p><p>Back then, Lu Ming had disguised himself. Now that he had restored his original appearance, Feng Ling, the village chief, and the rest naturally could not recognize him.</p><p>“It’s me!”</p><p>“Village chief, we’re already at the southeast of the Azure region. How about you guys stay here from now on?” Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Brother Lu, I’ll just follow your arrangements!”</p><p>The village chief said.</p><p>don’t worry, young master Lu. I’ll get someone to arrange their accommodation. I’ll definitely find a place with a good environment to settle them down!</p><p>Lu Zhenghao said. Then, he called a patriarch of the Lu family, Feng Ling, the village chief, and the others to settle down.</p><p>In this way, one of Lu Ming’s worries could be considered resolved.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>A crisp voice was heard. A figure flashed and a little girl of about seven or eight years old appeared in front of Lu Ming. It was Lu Xiangxiang.</p><p>Liu Wanjun followed behind Xiangxiang.</p><p>Xiangxiang, why aren’t you paying your respects to your master? you don’t know any manners!</p><p>Liu Wanjun scolded him.</p><p>“Disciple pays respects to master!”</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila bowed to Lu Ming obediently.</p><p>hehe, no need. Come, let me introduce you. This is my senior brother. You should call him seventh senior uncle. This is my Senior Sister. You should call him eighth senior aunt!</p><p>Lu Ming pointed at Tian Chui and Xue ningxin and started to introduce them.</p><p>“Xiangxiang greets seventh martial uncle and eighth martial aunt!”</p><p>Xiang Xiang obediently bowed to Tian Chui and Xue ningxin.</p><p>“Haha, good girl, this is a gift from eighth martial aunt!”</p><p>Xue ningxin took out a green bead and gave it to Xiangxiang. It was an Emperor spiritual weapon as a greeting gift.</p><p>“Come, come, seventh uncle also has a gift for you!”</p><p>Tian Chui grinned as he took out an Emperor spiritual weapon and gave it to Xiangxiang.</p><p>“Xiangxiang, your cultivation … You’ve reached Lv 9 martial King realm?”</p><p>At this moment, a look of surprise flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>“Mm! I’ve just broken through to Lv 9 martial King realm a few days ago!”</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila nodded.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyelids twitched. He was shocked.</p><p>One year. In just one year, Xiangxiang Beila’s cultivation had already broken through to Lv 9 martial King realm. This speed was simply too shocking.</p><p>This was in the Lu clan Fort, and they had not received the resources of a top sect to nurture them. This speed left Lu Ming dumbfounded.</p><p>it’s not bad to be able to reach Lv 9 martial King realm at this age. Xiangxiang, How long have you been cultivating? ”</p><p>Tian Chui asked.</p><p>“Xiangxiang has been cultivating for a year. A year ago, master taught me how to cultivate!”</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila said.</p><p>“Hmm, a year’s time is not bad. Wait, what? A year?”</p><p>Tian Chui started to nod his head and immediately reacted. His mouth opened wider and wider as he looked at Xiang Xiang in disbelief.</p><p>Xue ningxin was also dumbfounded.</p><p>A year ago, before he had even started cultivating, he had used only a year to reach Lv 9 martial King realm. This kind of speed had left Tian Chui and Xue ningxin flabbergasted.</p><p>Although this was the yuan continent and many heaven’s pride experts cultivated at an amazing speed, they had never heard of anyone who had only spent a year to reach the ninth level of the martial King realm.</p><p>On the side, Liu Wanjun and Lu Zhenghao were both excited and happy.</p><p>To be honest, at the beginning, Xiangxiang Beila’s cultivation speed had also shocked them. Now, it had completely turned into excitement.</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila blinked her big eyes, curiously looking at the dumbstruck Tian Chui and Xue ningxin. She really couldn’t understand why her martial aunt and martial uncle were like this.</p><p>After a long time, Tian Chui and Xue ningxin finally reacted.</p><p>“Junior Brother, I’m so envious that I can actually take in such a good disciple. If I had such a disciple, even if I don’t cultivate, I’d still give her some good guidance!”</p><p>Tian Chui looked at Lu Ming with eyes full of envy, jealousy, and hatred.</p><p>“Then, as a martial uncle, you must give me more guidance in the future!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>They chatted and when night fell, Lu Zhenghao prepared a banquet for them.</p><p>That night, Lu Ming and the few of them stayed in the Lu clan Fort.</p><p>The next morning, Lu Ming bade farewell to Lu Zhenghao and Liu Wanjun.</p><p>“Mother, grandfather, take care!”</p><p>Xiangxiang said goodbye to Lu Zhenghao and Liu Wanjun reluctantly.</p><p>“Xiangxiang, in the future, when you’re in Dragon God Valley, you must listen to master and cultivate well, understand?”</p><p>Liu Wanjun’s eyes were full of reluctance, and tears began to fall.</p><p>mother, don’t cry. Xiangxiang will find time to come and see you!</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila said obediently.</p><p>Then, Xiang Xiang said goodbye to Lu Zhenghao.</p><p>“Lu family head, young Madam, we’ll meet again!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and left with Xiangxiang, disappearing from Lu Zhenghao and the others ‘sight.</p><p>After flying for a while, Lu Ming took out the space-breaking flying shuttle. The four of them stepped into the space-breaking flying shuttle and headed for Dragon God Valley.</p><p>It was Xiangxiang Beila’s first time riding on a space-breaking flying shuttle and she had a child’s temperament. She quickly threw the sadness of separation to the back of her mind and looked around. She then pulled Lu Ming and asked him all sorts of questions. She was extremely curious.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
