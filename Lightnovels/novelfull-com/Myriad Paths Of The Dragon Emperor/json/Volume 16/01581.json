As soon as he made his move, the sky was filled with black demonic fire. Anyone who touched it was immediately burned and turned into ashes.</p><p>The half-Saints of the Yu Du sect and the Tian Shen sect were also extremely terrifying. With a wave of their hands, powerful cultivators were killed one after another.</p><p>The few of them were the fastest as they charged toward the Phoenix.</p><p>No one noticed that the blood of the people who were killed quickly seeped into the ground and disappeared after it scattered on the ground.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming also rushed out.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not charge toward the Phoenix. Instead, he charged toward the side of the altar.</p><p>There, there was a stone plate the size of a basin with a Tai Chi pattern carved on it.</p><p>When the altar was destroyed, this stone plate had flown out from the altar.</p><p>Everyone thought that the formation on the altar only had one core, which was the ancient Phoenix mirror. However, Lu Ming could tell that the formation on the altar actually had two cores.</p><p>One of them was the ancient Phoenix mirror, and the other was the stone plate.</p><p>To be able to work together with the ancient Phoenix mirror as the core of this formation, it was definitely not simple.</p><p>Lu Ming reached out and grabbed the stone tray, but it did not move at all.</p><p>“It’s that heavy?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He tried to grab it but failed. This stone plate was heavier than a mountain.</p><p>“I’ll put away the mountain and river diagram first!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyebrows glowed and shot out a beam of light that enveloped the stone plate. The stone plate was successfully kept into the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly felt a terrible sense of danger in his heart. This sense of danger made Lu Ming feel as if he was falling into an abyss.</p><p>“Not good, it’s dangerous!”</p><p>Without thinking, Lu Ming took a step forward and retreated rapidly.</p><p>At the same time, Mo Yang, who was pouncing toward the Phoenix, had a drastic change in his expression. He suddenly turned around and frantically retreated.</p><p>All heaven’s favorites have extremely sharp spiritual senses. They can sense the danger that is coming and they can overcome the obstacles to reach the peak.</p><p>Lu Ming was such a person, and Mo Yang was, without a doubt, such a person.</p><p>Just as the two of them were retreating, wisps of black smoke rose from the altar and wrapped around a group of Warriors.</p><p>“Ah, what the hell is this?”</p><p>Someone shouted in fear.</p><p>A terrifying scene happened. Anyone who was surrounded by the black smoke quickly shriveled up and turned into a dry corpse.</p><p>It was the same as being devoured by Lu Ming’s devouring power.</p><p>“Ah, get lost!”</p><p>The others screamed in fear and wanted to retreat, but it was too late. Those who were entangled by the black smoke turned into dried corpses.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Only a few half-Saints could fight back.</p><p>They took out their Saint weapons and charged forward, dispersing the black smoke.</p><p>However, after the black smoke was scattered, it gathered again and all the black smoke was surging toward one person. That person was a half-Saint of the deity sect who had once participated in besieging and killing Lu Ming.</p><p>All the black smoke gathered and increased its power. The half-saint’s Saint weapon was useless. The black smoke was like small snakes, drilling into the half-saint’s body. The half-Saint let out a desperate scream and turned into a dry corpse like the others.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The few half-Saints who had escaped were terrified. They roared and retreated quickly.</p><p>The others were also extremely frightened and retreated to the tunnel behind them.</p><p>Lu Ming, Tian Chui, and Xue ningxin blended in with the crowd and retreated toward the passage.</p><p>However, when they approached the passage, the walls on both sides exploded with a loud bang. Figures appeared in a flash and surrounded the passage.</p><p>These people were all wrapped in black robes, only revealing a pair of cold eyes.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The moment these people appeared, they charged at Lu Ming and the rest without saying a word.</p><p>Everyone was shocked. They didn’t expect that there would be people hiding on the walls.</p><p>After reaching the martial Royal realm, it would not be too difficult for a martial Royal to cut a big hole in the wall, flatten it, or even restore it to its original state as long as one had mastered the earth domain or the mountain domain.</p><p>However, everyone’s attention had been drawn to the sovereign weapon and the Phoenix. Caught off guard, a large number of experts were killed in an instant.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Sword light flickered, and blood splashed in all directions. One figure after another fell.</p><p>“Half-Saint, so many half-Saints!”</p><p>Someone shouted in fear.</p><p>There were at least seven or eight half-step Saints among the black-robed men.</p><p>The sword light flashed, and no one could block it.</p><p>The most shocking thing was that there were a few black-robed men standing on the side. They didn’t make a move, but the aura they gave off was extremely shocking.</p><p>That was the might of a Saint!</p><p>The black-robed men were All Saints.</p><p>“Who are you people? How dare you kill the people of my Tian Shen sect!”</p><p>A half-Saint of the tianshen sect roared, but he was met with a terrifying sword light.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The black-robed Saints didn’t attack them. Instead, they walked past them and appeared in front of the broken altar. They bowed and said in unison, ” “Welcome back to the world, Dharmaraja!”</p><p>“Flesh and blood, I want flesh and blood!”</p><p>Under the altar, a shriveled and unpleasant sound came out. It made people’s hair stand on end.</p><p>“Lightning King?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>These people were from evil spirit.</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing. He finally knew what had happened here.</p><p>There was actually an evil spirit Cult Master sealed in this place. Previously, the large array with the Tai Chi array disc and the ancient Phoenix mirror as the core was used to seal the evil spirit Cult Master.</p><p>However, the evil spirit cult wanted to save their Shakyamuni, so they entered the Windy Plains and severely injured the divine bird Phoenix. Then, they nailed the divine bird Phoenix to the wall and used its blood, which was filled with resentment, to break the formation.</p><p>Therefore, for the past half a month, the cries of phoenixes filled with unwillingness and despair could be heard from time to time, which attracted many experts.</p><p>By the time the eight Saint realm experts entered, the power of the formation was already very weak. In order to fight for the ancient Phoenix mirror, the eight Saint realm experts broke the formation by force and shattered the altar, allowing the ancient Phoenix mirror to escape. This was equivalent to helping evil spirit cult greatly.</p><p>Now, evil Spirit’s discipline King was about to come out of seclusion.</p><p>“Shakyamuni, we’ll help you break the last formation first!”</p><p>A black-robed Saint shouted. Then, the other black-robed Saints started to attack the ground below the altar.</p><p>There was another formation there, but it wasn’t very strong. It was on the verge of collapse under the attacks of a few Saints.</p><p>“Senior brother, Senior Sister, we’ll go through the air passage!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared.</p><p>The three of them rushed towards the tunnel that had been pierced through by the ancient Phoenix mirror.</p><p>If they waited for evil Spirit’s discipline King or a few Saints to come out, they would all die!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
