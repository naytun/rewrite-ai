His eyes were like lightning, and his killing intent was like a knife as he charged at the other young men.</p><p>...</p><p>The fist radiance seemed to be able to crush everything. The few young men were killed before they could even scream.</p><p>Then, his cold gaze swept over the few middle-aged men.</p><p>The few middle-aged men were covered in cold sweat and their faces were pale.</p><p>spare me, spare me!</p><p>The arrogant middle-aged man was the first to kneel down, his body trembling.</p><p>“I’ve said it before, if you come again, I’ll kill you. But you didn’t take my words to heart, so you’re asking for death!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly and then smacked his palm down.</p><p>The middle-aged men were only low-level martial Royal realm martial artists. How could they stop him? they were killed by a single palm.</p><p>“What a domineering method!”</p><p>Not far away, there were other people who had come to watch the show. At this time, they were also amazed.</p><p>No one had expected that a person from a small village would be so bold and powerful. He had killed the people of the heavenly God sect, including a few heaven’s pride experts, with such a crushing force.</p><p>there’s going to be a good show. There are more than a few people from the heavenly God sect. I’m afraid that many experts have gone crazy!</p><p>“That’s right. It won’t be long before the people of the heavenly God sect come to kill us!”</p><p>These people discussed and retreated.</p><p>“All … They’re all dead!”</p><p>The village chief was dumbfounded, and then he was worried.</p><p>He had killed so many people from the heavenly God sect. The heavenly God sect would definitely come for revenge.</p><p>What should he do?</p><p>Village chief was worried.</p><p>“Village chief, do you have any intention of moving to another place to live?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>This small village was too weak. In this world of martial Dao, it could be destroyed at any time.</p><p>Just like today, if it was not for Lu Ming, Feng Ling would most likely have been killed. In that case, it would be difficult for the village chief to survive. In the end, if he angered the cold and arrogant middle-aged man and the others, the entire village would also be destroyed.</p><p>This was because the village didn’t have a powerful martial force, but it had Phoenix incense wood. In the past, it hadn’t been discovered, but now that it had been discovered, it was only a matter of time before it was destroyed.</p><p>This was the sorrow of the weak!</p><p>“Grandpa, let’s leave this place!”</p><p>Feng Ling advised.</p><p>sigh, we also want to leave, but in the Cang region, there are powerful beasts everywhere. Even one emperor-level beast can easily destroy our village. But here, we are close to the heavenly wind Plains. The heavenly wind Plains has a Phoenix that can scare away all the beasts, so we are safe!</p><p>as for those big cities, we have to spend a large number of raw gemstones to live in them. We don’t have that many raw gemstones!</p><p>The village chief sighed.</p><p>It wasn’t that they didn’t want to leave, but they had nowhere to go.</p><p>“Village chief, I have a Grotto-heaven treasure. You can enter the grotto-heaven treasure first. After that, I’ll bring you to a place!” Lu Ming said after a moment of silence.</p><p>There were only a few dozen families in this village. Lu Ming planned to send them to the Lu clan’s Fort. The Lu clan’s Fort was extremely spacious. A small piece of land was enough to house a few dozen families.</p><p>“An estate-world treasure!”</p><p>The village chief revealed a shocked expression. It seemed like this little brother Lu in front of him had an astonishing background.</p><p>alright, I’ll call the villagers over. I’ll have to trouble you later, brother Lu!</p><p>The village chief bowed to Lu Ming and then hurried away to call the other villagers.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and all the villagers were kept into the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming sat there and waited quietly.</p><p>At this moment, the news of an impressive villager killing a few heaven’s pride experts of the heavenly God sect had already spread in the outskirts of the heavenly wind Plains.</p><p>the heavenly God sect will definitely take revenge on such powerful villagers. Let’s go and take a look!</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>As the rainbow light whistled, one figure after another came to the small village and stood around it.</p><p>“Eh, no one?”</p><p>“Could he have already escaped? No, there’s one person!”</p><p>Many people’s gazes swept across and finally landed on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Eh? Senior brother, Senior Sister!”</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze across the crowd and actually found someone familiar.</p><p>Tian Chui and Xue ningxin!</p><p>The Dragon God Valley was quite far from here. He didn’t expect that Tian Chui and Xue ningxin would also appear here.</p><p>Tian Chui and Xue ningxin, like the others, stood at a distance and sized Lu Ming up curiously.</p><p>“That is … Mo Yang, Mo Yang actually came!”</p><p>“What a beautiful woman. Who is that woman?”</p><p>There was a sudden commotion in the crowd, and everyone looked in one direction.</p><p>In that direction, there were about a dozen people. There were two young men and women, and a dozen old men and men. All of them had extremely powerful auras and demonic Qi.</p><p>“Nianqing!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up when he saw one of them.</p><p>The most beautiful woman among the two young men and women was actually Xie nianqing.</p><p>The other person was Mo Yang, one of the top ten geniuses of the Azure continent.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze landed on Xie nianqing, and Xie nianqing looked back at him at the same time. When their eyes met, Xie nianqing was slightly stunned. Then, a smile appeared in her eyes and she winked at Lu Ming.</p><p>He had been recognized!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>He was too familiar with Xie nianqing. No matter how much a person changed his appearance, his aura and appearance could change, but the look in his eyes would never change. Clearly, Xie nianqing recognized Lu Ming through his eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head slightly at Xie nianqing, who nodded in return.</p><p>What Lu Ming meant was not to reveal his identity for the time being. Xie nianqing naturally understood Lu Ming’s intention.</p><p>Beside Xie nianqing, Mo Yang seemed to have noticed Xie nianqing’s unusual behavior. He looked at Lu Ming with a cold and suspicious look in his eyes.</p><p>“The people of the heavenly God sect are here!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>In the distance, there were at least a few dozen figures flying over.</p><p>All of them were dressed in white robes and had powerful auras. There were young, middle-aged, and old people.</p><p>The person at the front was bathed in holy light, like a myriad of stars surrounding the moon.</p><p>Saint Yu!</p><p>Lu Ming recognized this person at one glance.</p><p>A year and a half ago, Yu Sheng had been the leader of the tianshen sect during the treasure auction. He was extremely talented and had amazing combat strength.</p><p>A year and a half later, Yu Sheng had become even stronger. His powerful aura filled the air and was extremely terrifying.</p><p>The early stage of Lv 8 martial Royal realm!</p><p>This was Yu Sheng’s cultivation base. Clearly, he had made rapid progress in the past one and a half years.</p><p>The people of the heavenly God sect stood in the sky above the village. Their eyes swept across the village and finally landed on Lu Ming.</p><p>“So you’re the one who killed the heaven’s pride expert of my heavenly God sect?”</p><p>Yu Sheng said coldly.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming replied indifferently.</p><p>you’re really audacious. You’re simply courting death. Where are the other villagers? where have you hidden them? hand them all over and die!</p><p>A middle-aged man beside Yu Sheng shouted. He exuded the aura of a peak Lv 7 martial Royal realm.</p><p>hehe, as expected of a large sect. So impressive, so domineering. A disciple of the sect came to this remote mountain village to bully ordinary villagers and even try to steal an ancestor’s memorial tablet. As expected of the ‘number one sect in the Azure region’!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>His tone was full of ridicule, especially the ‘self-address’.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
