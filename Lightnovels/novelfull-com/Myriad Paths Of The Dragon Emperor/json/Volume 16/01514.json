The Cang region’s treasure sealing assembly is held once every three years. The thirteen top sects of the Cang region and countless geniuses will gather at the Cang mountains. Some of the thirteen top sects have grudges with each other, and fights often break out. Now that they’ve gathered at the Cang mountains, it’s normal for them to start killing each other over a single disagreement!</p><p>Xue ningxin explained.</p><p>Three years ago, Xue ningxin had come to the Cang mountains, so she knew more.</p><p>the Cang Mountain is the place where Emperor Cang corroborated his Dao and became an Emperor. Therefore, there have been many experts, including great saints and absolute Saints, who came to pay their respects to the place where Emperor Cang corroborated his Dao. Therefore, there are many heavenly Dao inscriptions left by experts in the Cang Mountain, which usually attracts many people. Let’s go and take a look. Maybe we can gain some enlightenment!</p><p>Xue ningxin said.</p><p>“There’s actually such a place, of course we have to go!”</p><p>Tian Chui revealed a look of anticipation.</p><p>Then, Xue ningxin led the way, and the three of them flew towards the east side of the Cang Mountain.</p><p>The closer they got to the grey Mountain, the more they felt that it was extraordinary. It was as if there was an extremely powerful force, or as if there was a great emperor lying dormant here. They could not help but admire it.</p><p>As he flew, he could see that there were many buildings built in many parts of the Cang Mountain.</p><p>Although there were no top sects in the Cang mountains, there were still some small forces here.</p><p>Soon, the three of them landed on a small path.</p><p>there’s a Canyon in front of us. There’s a palm print left by a Supreme Saint senior. It’s very mysterious. I came here three years ago to study it, and I gained a lot!</p><p>Xue ning said in her heart. She took the lead and walked forward.</p><p>After walking for a while, a Valley entrance appeared in front of them. However, there were two young men standing guard at the entrance.</p><p>“Stop, this road is blocked!”</p><p>The two young men blocked their way. One of them said coldly.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>Xue ningxin’s eyes turned cold.</p><p>“This place has already been reserved by my Tian Shen sect. You guys can go to other places!”</p><p>A young man sneered.</p><p>“Your heaven God sect reserved it? How laughable. This place belongs to the whole world and anyone can come here. How come I don’t know that this place has become the territory of your Tian Shen sect?”</p><p>Xue ningxin sneered.</p><p>I said I’ve reserved it, so I’ve reserved it. Hurry up and get lost!</p><p>A young man from the heavenly God sect berated in an overbearing manner.</p><p>“The heaven God sect is really overbearing!”</p><p>Tian Chui’s eyes flickered with an ominous glint. If it wasn’t for the fact that he could sense many powerful auras within the valley, he would have already attacked.</p><p>“Let’s go to another place!”</p><p>A murderous glint flashed across Xue ningxin’s eyes. However, she still pulled on Tian Chui and Lu Ming and turned to leave.</p><p>“Stop! Don’t let them go!”</p><p>At this moment, a cold roar came from the valley.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>The two young men who were guarding the door moved in a flash and blocked the way of Lu Ming and the other two.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>In the canyon, the sound of the air being torn could be heard. Five young men rushed out and surrounded Lu Ming and the other two.</p><p>“Shi Tian!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a cold glint.</p><p>Among the five people who rushed out, one of them was Shi Tian, the young leader who had entered the great Emperor’s Secret realm from the heavenly God sect.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, it’s you!”</p><p>Shi Tian laughed, his face cold. He looked at Lu Ming with a cold killing intent.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you have killed so many of my Tian Shen sect’s disciples in the Emperor Cang secret realm. Today, you don’t need to leave. Just leave your life here!”</p><p>A powerful aura emanated from Shi Tian’s body as he locked onto Lu Ming.</p><p>Back in the Emperor Cang secret realm, before the secret realm collapsed, Lu Ming had gone on a killing spree and killed many disciples of the tianshen sect. This made Shi Tian hate Lu Ming to the core.</p><p>“Junior Brother Shi Tian, you don’t need to do anything to kill this man. I’ll help you kill him!”</p><p>A young man on the stone horizon said.</p><p>“No need, I’m going to kill this person myself!”</p><p>Shi Tian waved his hand and stepped forward.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The aura on his body skyrocketed and only stopped when it reached the fourth level of the martial Royal realm.</p><p>Shi Tian had obtained an inheritance in the Emperor Cang secret realm. After he returned, he was heavily nurtured by the tianshen sect. In addition to his high talent, his cultivation had advanced by leaps and bounds, breaking through to the LV 4 martial Royal realm in one go. With the inheritance, his combat strength was even more terrifying.</p><p>This time, he was confident that he could kill Lu Ming and wash away the shame.</p><p>“Lu Ming, die!”</p><p>Holy light burst out from Shi Tian’s body. A spear of divine punishment was formed, piercing through the air like a bolt of White Lightning. With an extremely sharp aura, it stabbed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>An ordinary Lv 4 or Lv 5 martial Royal realm expert would have been killed by this move.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not an ordinary martial artist.</p><p>In an instant, the spear of God’s punishment was about to Pierce Lu Ming. At this moment, Lu Ming stretched out his hand and grabbed the spear. The spear stopped in front of Lu Ming, unable to move an inch.</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>Shi Tian roared. His Zhen Yuan and realm burst out and poured into the spear of God punishment. However, the spear seemed to be fixed in place and couldn’t move.</p><p>Shi Tian’s eyes widened and the veins on his face bulged. He exerted all his strength, but Lu Ming’s hand was as solid as a rock. No matter how he roared, it was useless.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>Shi Tian roared in his heart, he couldn’t believe it.</p><p>“This is your combat strength?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. The muscles in his body trembled and a Dragon’s Roar was heard. He clenched his fist.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Shi Tian’s spear of divine punishment exploded.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming clenched his fist and threw a punch at Shi Tian.</p><p>Shi Tian subconsciously crossed his arms in front of his body.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s punch landed on Shi Tian’s arms. Both of Shi Tian’s arms exploded. He screamed in pain and flew backward, spitting out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>Although they were both at the LV 4 martial Royal realm, Shi Tian could not fight back at all and was easily crushed by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill, kill, attack together, kill them all!”</p><p>Shi Tian roared crazily. At the same time, his spiritual body glowed and quickly repaired his broken arm.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The other young men of the heavenly Divine sect roared in anger. Their auras exploded and holy light filled the air. Terrifying attacks poured down on Lu Ming.</p><p>Two of the sixth level martial emperors aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted and activated the divine sword technique. The two fifth level martial Royal realm martial artists ‘souls trembled and their vital essence became chaotic.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and struck out two palms. The two Lv 5 martial Royal realm young men were killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>“I’ll slaughter you sons of b * tches!”</p><p>On the other side, Tian Chui and Xue ningxin also made their moves.</p><p>The highest cultivation among these people was only at the sixth level of the martial Royal realm. They were no match for Tian Chui and the others at all. As soon as they exchanged blows, two of them were smashed to death by Tian Chui’s hammer and two were killed by Xue ningxin’s fists.</p><p>All of a sudden, Shi Tian was left alone.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
