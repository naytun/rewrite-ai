However, how did they find us before? They’re still ambushing us!”</p><p>Tian Chui cursed.</p><p>it must be Mo Yang. He’s in cahoots with the heaven deity sect and the desire poison sect. That’s why we’re being ambushed!</p><p>Xue ningxin said.</p><p>Senior Sister, you’re right. Mo Yang didn’t run into us by chance. He found us on purpose and then ambushed us!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Lu Ming had already thought of this when he was ambushed by the tianshen sect and the Yu Du sect. That was why he had allowed Mo Yang to take Xie nianqing away. He knew that Xie nianqing would not be in danger if Mo Yang took him away.</p><p>Mo Yang, it’s actually him! I’ll smash him to pieces sooner or later!</p><p>Tian Chui’s eyes revealed an ominous glint as he spoke.</p><p>Lu Ming also nodded. He would kill Mo Yang sooner or later.</p><p>this area is surrounded by hurricanes. There must be something abnormal. Let’s check the nearby area!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Tian Chui and Xue ningxin nodded. The three of them moved forward and began to investigate the area.</p><p>This area was quite wide, about tens of miles in length and width.</p><p>“What’s that? It seems to be a feather!”</p><p>Xue ningxin suddenly pointed to the front.</p><p>The three of them rushed over and found that the ground was full of potholes and some feathers were scattered.</p><p>“This is the Phoenix Feather!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>He had obtained a few Phoenix Feathers before, so he would definitely not be mistaken. The feathers scattered on the ground were all Phoenix Feathers.</p><p>There were more than ten of them.</p><p>“It really is a Phoenix Feather. It seems like there is a divine Phoenix in the heavenly wind Plains. I can’t be wrong!”</p><p>Tian Chui said.</p><p>senior brother, Senior Sister, the Phoenix Feather is of great use to me. I wonder if you can give it to me. I’m willing to use other treasures to offset it!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>As for the Phoenix Feather, he could let his second body refine it into a Phoenix Feather flying sword.</p><p>Previously, there were only five Phoenix Feather flying swords, and the Phoenix Feathers used in those five swords were not of very high grade. The Phoenix Feather in front of him now exuded a faint Saint might, which was obviously left behind by a Saint realm Phoenix. If it was refined into a Phoenix Feather flying sword, its power would be even stronger.</p><p>Furthermore, the more Phoenix Feather flying swords there were, the more powerful the sword formation would be.</p><p>“Junior Brother, what are you saying? if you have any use for it, just take it all. There’s no need to offset it!”</p><p>Xue ningxin said.</p><p>“That’s right. You saved our lives just now. You’re being too polite by saying that. I’m not happy about that!”</p><p>Tian Chui said with a grin.</p><p>thank you, senior brother and Senior Sister!</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and did not stand on ceremony. With a wave of his hand, the dozen or so Phoenix Feathers on the ground were all kept into the mountain and river diagram and landed on the secondary hand.</p><p>this place is full of potholes. It’s obvious that there was a huge battle here. Also, it looks like the divine bird Phoenix was severely injured. Could it be that the cry of the phoenix was made after the Phoenix was injured? ”</p><p>Xue ningxin guessed.</p><p>“It’s possible. Let’s wait and see!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and the three of them continued to check.</p><p>However, the three of them were highly focused. Even the Saint realm Phoenix was injured. It was obvious that the opponent of the Saint realm Phoenix was extremely powerful. Both humans and other divine beasts had to be careful.</p><p>Along the way, the ground was full of potholes. It could be seen how intense the battle was.</p><p>Along the way, Lu Ming and the rest discovered a small number of Phoenix Feathers. Lu Ming kept them all.</p><p>Not long after, they found a deep pit.</p><p>The crater was more than 500 meters wide and more than 1000 meters deep.</p><p>The three of them looked and guessed that there was a huge ancient tree here. Now, it had been dug away, even the roots had been dug away.</p><p>Phoenix incense wood!</p><p>The three of them looked at each other and thought of the Phoenix incense wood.</p><p>Perhaps, the divine bird Phoenix lived on the Phoenix incense wood. Now, the Phoenix was injured and its whereabouts were unknown, and the Phoenix incense wood had been dug up by someone.</p><p>“There are scattered tree roots over there!”</p><p>Tian Chui’s eyes could see tree roots within the deep hole.</p><p>The three of them flew down, and as expected, they saw a section of a tree root that was as thick as a human thigh. It was emitting a strange fragrance, and it was definitely Phoenix incense wood.</p><p>let’s look around. There might still be some scattered tree roots!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The three of them began to search, turning the soil in the deep pit over and over. As expected, they found quite a few tree roots.</p><p>The Phoenix incense tree root was even more valuable than the branch.</p><p>The three of them split it equally, and the harvest was not small.</p><p>it’s a pity that the entire piece of Phoenix incense wood was dug up by someone. Otherwise, how much would it be worth if we obtained it? ”</p><p>Tian Chui’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The Phoenix incense wood could help a martial artist calm his mind and focus his mind. As long as one was a martial arts cultivator, they would need it.</p><p>How many Warriors were there in the yuan continent? No one knew that the Phoenix-fragrance wood was definitely something that everyone was fighting for. Who knew how many raw stones a piece of Phoenix-fragrance wood could be sold for.</p><p>The three of them searched carefully again and left after finding nothing.</p><p>But soon, the three of them were shocked because they found a person.</p><p>To be precise, there was a bloody pit there, and a figure was sitting cross-legged in the pit.</p><p>“Eden!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>That figure was actually Eden from the divine Ruins continent group.</p><p>Lu Ming had a deep impression of this person. Back then, this person’s bloodline was a Phoenix zither. He could play the divine Song of the Phoenix and his combat power was very strong.</p><p>Eden was actually able to enter this place.</p><p>Eden was sitting cross-legged in the blood pit. The blood in the blood pit had actually turned into the shadow of a Phoenix and entered Eden’s body.</p><p>The blood was obviously Phoenix blood.</p><p>“Lu Ming, do you know this person?”</p><p>Tian Chui asked.</p><p>yes, I do. He came from the same group of continents as me. In our group of continents, he was a peerless heaven’s pride expert. Later on, he joined the tianshen sect!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“The people of the heavenly God sect!”</p><p>Tian Chui’s eyes were filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>But at this moment, Eden was completely oblivious to the outside world and was focused on absorbing the Phoenix blood.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A moment later, a Phoenix shadow flew out of Eden’s body. After letting out a long cry, Eden’s aura grew.</p><p>The fifth level of the Martial Emperor realm!</p><p>Obviously, Eden had made a major breakthrough in his cultivation and entered the fifth level of the martial Royal realm.</p><p>At this moment, Eden opened his eyes. When he saw Lu Ming and the other two, his pupils constricted and he retreated rapidly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s you?”</p><p>Eden immediately exclaimed in disbelief.</p><p>of course it’s me. Why? don’t you recognize me? ”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ve already withdrawn from the deity sect!” Eden muttered to himself.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Lu Ming raised his eyebrows.</p><p>This was out of Lu Ming’s expectations. Eden’s cultivation was not very high. If he left the deity sect now, it would be equivalent to losing his protection.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
