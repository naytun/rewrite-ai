Even if the attack power was too strong, the defense power was definitely not good. He would probably be killed if he was attacked once or twice.</p><p>Lu Ming was not confident that he would not be attacked by the 108 exotic beasts.</p><p>...</p><p>Unless his Chaos Domain broke through to the fourth level, he would not have the confidence to challenge the eight floating platforms.</p><p>“Senior brother, I need some time to digest this. Please continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>“Haha, go!”</p><p>Tian Chui laughed.</p><p>Lu Ming leaped off the floating platform and flew toward the snow Mountain at the side.</p><p>He had already challenged the heaven-connecting floating platform twice and absorbed and refined a large amount of heavenly Dao marks. These heavenly Dao marks were all refined in one go and he needed time to digest and polish them. Then, he would step onto the heaven-connecting floating platform and the effect would be much better.</p><p>If he kept challenging the floating platform and absorbing the marks of heaven way, the effect would not be good and there might be problems.</p><p>Therefore, many cave abodes were opened up on the snow mountains at the edge for the cultivators of Dragon God Valley to digest and Polish.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming entered an empty cave abode, closed the door, and sat cross-legged. His Chaos Domain spread out as he quietly comprehended.</p><p>After a few days, Lu Ming walked out of the cave abode and stepped onto the sky-connecting floating platform again.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a month had passed.</p><p>After a month of hard work, he had finally made a breakthrough in his Chaos Domain. He had stepped into level four in one go, and his power had increased greatly.</p><p>This made Lu Ming sigh. The difficulty of breaking through his chaos realm was indeed shocking. In a month, he had spent tens of millions of mid-grade raw stones, which was a hundred thousand contribution points in total, before he finally broke through the chaos realm.</p><p>After the breakthrough, Lu Ming did not leave but continued to cultivate on the sky-connecting floating platform.</p><p>The chaos realm had broken through to the fourth level and its power had increased greatly. Lu Ming had also perfectly integrated the thirteen charged strikes into the chaos realm. Each move and form could burst out ten times the attack power. He successfully passed through the eighth floating platform and his cultivation speed had increased a little.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another month had passed. Lu Ming’s Chaos Domain was gradually approaching the peak of level four.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had no choice but to leave.</p><p>That was because the sky-connecting floating platform was about to close.</p><p>The sky-connecting floating platforms required a huge amount of energy to operate. Moreover, they had to be shut down for maintenance every once in a while. Otherwise, the energy would run out and the sky-connecting floating platforms would have problems.</p><p>The closing time was usually two to three months.</p><p>In fact, every time the sky-connecting floating platform was open for three months, it would be closed for a few months.</p><p>“Junior Brother, let’s go back to the sky cloud Valley!”</p><p>Tian Chui walked to Lu Ming’s side.</p><p>For the past few months, Tian Chui had been cultivating on the sky-connecting floating platform. The aura on his body was getting stronger and stronger. The power of his domain was also getting more and more profound. Some time ago, he had even broken through to the seventh level in one go. Just like Lu Ming, he had also passed the eighth floating platform.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll treat you to a drink when we get back!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>The two of them flew towards Cloud Dragon Valley together.</p><p>They had just returned to sky cloud Valley when they met Xue ningxin.</p><p>“I was just about to look for you. So you two are together. Did you find a place to drink? Damn it, you didn’t even call me!”</p><p>Xue ningxin gritted her teeth and stared at the two of them.</p><p>“No, Little Junior Sister, we were just about to go for a drink. We came back to call you!”</p><p>Tian Chui quickly quibbled.</p><p>“Big hammer, don’t call me Little Junior Sister. I’m not the youngest anymore. Lu Ming is the youngest. He’s the little Junior Brother!”</p><p>Xue ningxin glanced at Tian Chui and said.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly and quickly changed the topic. “Senior Sister, you just said that you have something to tell us. What is it?”</p><p>ah, I almost forgot. I’m looking for you to go to the Cang mountains. The Cang province’s treasure fixing assembly will begin in less than two months. Right now, many of the younger generation are rushing to the Cang mountains!</p><p>Xue ningxin said.</p><p>“It’s starting so soon, I almost forgot!”</p><p>Tian Chui scratched his head and gave a silly smile.</p><p>“Azure region’s treasure sealing Convention?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s face was full of doubts.</p><p>“Little Junior Brother, you still don’t know, right? let Senior Sister tell you!”</p><p>Seeing the confusion on Lu Ming’s face, Xue ningxin’s interest was piqued. She put on the air of a Senior Sister and explained to Lu Ming.</p><p>the Azure region’s treasure sealing assembly, as its name suggests, is to decide which sect will keep the two ancient treasures. Every three years, the thirteen top sects of the Azure region will gather at the Azure Mountain and send their younger generation to participate in a series of competitions. The sect that wins in the end will continue to keep the two ancient treasures. Three years later, the treasure sealing assembly will be held again, and the decision will be made!</p><p>Xue ningxin explained.</p><p>Lu Ming came to a realization. So that was what happened. Once every three years, whoever was more powerful would be able to keep the two ancient treasures for three years.</p><p>“I wonder what kind of treasure it is that can make thirteen top sects so interested in it?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“I heard that one of them is a fragment of the prison-guarding stele …” Xue ningxin said.</p><p>“The fragment of the prison-suppressing stele?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming had never expected that one of the treasures would be the fragment of the prison defending monument.</p><p>Didn’t the tianshen sect have a fragment of the prison-suppressing stele?</p><p>Could it be that the sect that won the last time was the heavenly God sect?</p><p>“Junior Brother, you know about the fragment of the prison-guarding stele? Although the prison-guarding stele is a legendary treasure that can suppress all evil spirits, it’s broken and can’t exert much power. Legend has it that if all the pieces can be put together, there will be a big secret!”</p><p>there’s another treasure that’s the key. It’s also the focus of all the sects. It’s said that this treasure contains the secret to Dao vindication and Emperor realm!</p><p>Xue ningxin said.</p><p>“The secret of Dao vindication and Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming was even more shocked.</p><p>that’s right. It’s a pity that these two treasures have been passed around in the hands of the major sects for so many years. However, none of the sects have been able to obtain or crack this secret. However, none of the sects will give up. They all want to keep it in their hands and continue to study it. As for the heavenly God sect, they have already obtained the first place for several consecutive years and have control of two treasures.</p><p>Xue ningxin.</p><p>sure enough, it’s the heaven deity sect. Lu Ming nodded with a fiery light in his eyes.</p><p>What he was interested in was the fragment of the prison-guarding stele and the other treasure that was related to the secret of becoming a monarch. Although he was curious, he was not very interested.</p><p>All the major sects had researched for so many years without any results. He didn’t think that he would be able to discover any secrets.</p><p>“Senior Sister, so we’re going to the Cang mountains to participate in the competition?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Of course not!”</p><p>Xue ningxin shook her head and said, ” the candidates for the competition have been well learned by the major sects. They are all extremely powerful people among the younger generation. Some of them are even standing at the peak of the Martial Emperor realm. Even the weakest of them has entered the seventh level of the Martial Emperor realm. Those below the seventh level of the Martial Emperor realm are not qualified to participate. Even if they participate, it is useless!</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. It was true. With their current cultivation and combat strength, they were still far from being a match for those at the peak of the Martial Emperor realm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
