Why would the intentionless saber sect want to kill him?</p><p>Also, who were the other swordsmen?</p><p>Was it the tianshen sect, the Tianyu demonic sect, or the Yudu sect?</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was spinning with thoughts, but he did not stop his actions.</p><p>A shield appeared and expanded rapidly, floating behind Lu Ming. Then, with a flap of his black wings, Lu Ming chose a random direction and dashed off at top speed.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The Black Dragon Spear continued to thrust out, and the terrifying spear light pierced through the void and collided with the opponent.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>A deafening explosion sounded in the sky.</p><p>Lu Ming broke through the opponent’s attack and pierced the dantian of an eighth grade Martial Emperor with his spear, killing him. At the same time, his black wings were like two heavenly blades, slashing the two seventh grade martial emperors into two.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In front of him, there was a vast Saber Light that seemed to be able to split the heavens and earth as it suddenly slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>ninth level martial Royal realm!</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils contracted rapidly. He was exhausted and could not launch a counterattack. He could only hold the Black Dragon Spear horizontally in front of him.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The saber-light slashed at the Black Dragon Spear. The Black Dragon Spear vibrated with a buzzing sound and Lu Ming’s body was sent flying backward.</p><p>Behind him, there was a storm of attacks.</p><p>The sword light and the saber Light landed on the Holy weapon Shield and sent it flying.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body went slightly numb and he felt the blood in his body churning.</p><p>There were too many experts and all of them were at the high-level martial Royal realm. They had sent so many people to kill Lu Ming. This was a sure-kill, they were determined to take Lu Ming’s life.</p><p>There was nothing much to say. This was a life-and-death battle. Lu Ming let out a loud roar, and a Dragon’s Roar came from his body. Dragon scales appeared on the surface of his skin.</p><p>At the same time, his third bloodline emerged and a surge of energy surged into Lu Ming’s body, making him even stronger.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The black wings on Lu Ming’s back flapped wildly, bringing with them gusts of strong wind. In a flash, Lu Ming’s figure dashed backward.</p><p>The Black Dragon Spear swept out with the momentum of sweeping away thousands of troops.</p><p>The two seventh level martial Royal realm experts who were charging at him were killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Kill! Kill! Kill!</p><p>Lu Ming protected himself with his black wings and shield. He held the Black Dragon Spear and used all his strength to charge into the crowd.</p><p>The power of the [ thirteen storing power strikes ] was too strong. When combined with his holy weapon, an ordinary Lv 8 Martial Emperor could not withstand it at all. He would be killed in one strike, let alone a Lv 7 Martial Emperor.</p><p>The long spear swept across. Lu Ming seemed to have transformed into a killing machine, constantly harvesting lives.</p><p>Out of the dozen experts, only a few were left after being killed by him.</p><p>Of course, he had also been hit by many attacks, but with the protection of his Saint Weapon Shield and black wings, as well as his abnormal Dragon God combat body, he was not seriously injured, only his qi and blood were tumbling.</p><p>However, at this moment, in the dark night, more figures appeared.</p><p>This time, there were 20 to 30 people, all of whom were high-level martial Royal realm experts.</p><p>“So many powerhouses, they really think highly of me!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold.</p><p>It was truly shocking to mobilize such a terrifying force at once.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Six figures stepped out with terrifying auras. They were all Lv 9 martial Royal realm experts.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Below, a terrifying sword light was headed for Lu Ming. It was another person in the ninth level of the martial Royal realm.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared and used the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps. He took nine steps in a row and nine Dragons flew out, blasting toward the person below.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The sword light burst forth and collided with the nine Dragons, producing a terrifying boom.</p><p>Then, the sword gleam crushed the nine Dragons and the terrifying sword gleam continued to slash toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming moved his body to one side, but there was still a person in the ninth level of the martial Royal realm.</p><p>Lv 9 martial Royal realm experts were everywhere.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The Black Dragon Spear swept out toward the LV 9 martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>So what if he was at Lv 9 Martial Emperor realm? Kill them all the same!</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current cultivation, even without a holy weapon, he could fight with an ordinary ninth level martial Royal realm expert, or even kill them. With the addition of a holy weapon, he was even more fearless.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The Black Dragon Spear clashed with the opponent’s battle blade. The opponent’s body shook violently and was sent flying.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming had his eyes on this and continued to attack the other party.</p><p>The Black Dragon Spear expanded to a thousand meters in length and pressed down on the opponent.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The other party tried his best to block, but he was still unable to block it. He spat out a large mouthful of blood and frantically retreated.</p><p>However, Lu Ming extended the wind elemental technique and chased after the person closely.</p><p>“Let’s attack together!”</p><p>The other ninth-level martial Royal realm experts charged at Lu Ming. Their terrifying attacks sent the Holy weapon Shield flying. Some of the attacks landed on the black wings, causing Lu Ming’s body to shake.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s gaze remained firm. He stared at one person and charged at him.</p><p>Another spear shot out, and that person vomited a large mouthful of blood. His arm had been broken.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming threw out the Black Dragon Spear. The Black Dragon Spear pierced through the void like a bolt of Black Lightning. It contained the terrifying power of thirteen accumulated strikes. It suddenly burst out and pierced through the ninth level martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>The body of the LV 9 martial Royal realm expert exploded with a terrifying shock.</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly turned around and threw a punch at a Lv 9 martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>The Liuyuan glove appeared, and true essence frantically poured into it. The Liuyuan glove’s weight increased rapidly.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This punch contained the power of the primal Chaos Domain and the prison suppressing heavenly art. It was terrifyingly powerful and seemed to be able to destroy everything with ease.</p><p>The fist landed on the opponent’s sword. The Emperor spiritual weapon could not withstand the impact and exploded. The terrifying fist force hit the LV 9 martial Royal realm expert. He screamed as his body was penetrated and exploded.</p><p>In an instant, he had killed two people at the ninth level of the martial Royal realm.</p><p>“This person’s Saint weapon is too powerful!”</p><p>Some people felt their hearts tremble.</p><p>Even a Lv 9 martial Royal realm expert was killed.</p><p>“Retreat! Use your Saint weapons to kill him!”</p><p>A person in the sky said coldly.</p><p>A few of the LV 9 martial Royal realm experts retreated, but a few others stepped forward. Their auras were also at the LV 9 martial Royal realm.</p><p>There were too many experts. There were more than ten Lv 9 martial Royal realm experts.</p><p>Moreover, the few Lv 9 martial Royal realm experts who appeared later were even more terrifying, because they all had holy weapons.</p><p>One of them had a blood-red Tower floating above his head, and a terrifying aura spread out.</p><p>The other person held a battle blade, which was also a Saint weapon.</p><p>The third person was holding an iron rod, which was also a Saint weapon.</p><p>There was also a fourth person with a Stone Mountain floating above his head, which was also a Saint weapon.</p><p>The four Lv 9 martial Royal realm experts controlled the four holy weapons and sealed off the four directions.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>The person in the sky issued an order.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The man with the Holy weapon was the first to make a move. A terrifying blade light slashed towards Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
