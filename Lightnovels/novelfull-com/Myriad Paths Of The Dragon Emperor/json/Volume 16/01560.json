The third bloodline was too strange. He felt a lingering fear in his heart.</p><p>The third bloodline, the endless blood sea, and the giant face above the blood sea. What was that?</p><p>...</p><p>How could there be such a bizarre bloodline in this world? it was completely different from any other bloodline.</p><p>It was impossible for any other bloodline to possess such fearsome power. Furthermore, it seemed to have its own will.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, although I’ve sealed you in the ten-thousand-year-old ice jade and used it to erase your killing intent, some of it has already seeped into the depths of your heart and even your soul. This is also a potential danger. In the future, you might be affected by this hidden killing intent and slowly change your personality to become a bloodthirsty person!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said.</p><p>“Master, what should I do?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>go out and gain experience. Walk in the world and nature, temper your heart, and use the Qi of the world and nature to eliminate the killing intent in the depths of your soul. Only in this way can you truly get rid of the influence of the killing intent on you. It will also be of great help to your future cultivation. To become a saint, you need to master the divine law, which is also in the world and nature!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said.</p><p>“Yes, master!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>mm, go out and train for a year. A year later, you’ll return to Cloud Dragon Valley and I’ll send you to a place. That place might be of greater help to you when you defeat the Divine Child in two and a half years.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said.</p><p>Clearly, the cloud Dragon Valley master already knew that Lu Ming had challenged the divine Son.</p><p>“Master, what place is it?”</p><p>Lu Ming was curious.</p><p>“It’s a place full of endless dangers and opportunities. Before you go there, you must erase the killing intent in the depths of the spiritual God. Otherwise, you’ll probably be affected by it and become a bloodthirsty person. You’ll know when you come back in a year.”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said.</p><p>Lu Ming was helpless and could only give up.</p><p>that’s right, master. There seems to be an expert from the intentionless saber sect among the people from evil spirit!</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly said.</p><p>“The intentionless saber sect? “It seems that some sects have already been infiltrated by evil spirit. Ming ‘er, I will discuss this with the valley master and the other sect Masters. You don’t have to worry too much. Alright, go out. Seventh and eighth, we’ve been waiting for you!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master began to frown, but he soon smiled.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>This matter concerned the top sect of the Azure continent. With his current strength, he could only reveal the news. He couldn’t interfere with anything more.</p><p>He believed that the sect leaders of the top sects in the Azure continent would be more concerned about the fact that evil spirit had infiltrated them. There was no need for him to worry.</p><p>“Senior brother Tian Chui and Senior Sister Xue?”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming revealed a smile on his face.</p><p>He followed the cloud Dragon Valley master out of the ice cave and came to a Glacier Valley.</p><p>This place was still a part of Cloud Dragon Valley.</p><p>Two figures were waiting outside. They were Tian Chui and Xue ningxin.</p><p>“Little Junior Brother, you’re finally awake. It’s great that you’re fine.”</p><p>“Little Junior Brother, you’ve been sleeping for half a year!”</p><p>When Tian Chui and Xue ningxin saw Lu Ming, they smiled.</p><p>“Seventh senior brother, eighth Senior Sister, long time no see!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled as well. He then swept his gaze across the room and said, congratulations, senior brother and sister. Your cultivation has broken through to Lv 7 Martial Emperor realm!</p><p>In half a year’s time, Tian Chui and Xue ningxin’s cultivation had improved greatly. They had already reached the seventh level of the martial Royal realm and had entered the ranks of high-level martial Royal realm.</p><p>“If we don’t hurry up, Junior Brother will catch up with us!”</p><p>Tian Chui laughed.</p><p>you guys can chat first. Ming ‘er, if you go out, you don’t need to report to me. You can just come back a year later!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said. He took a step forward and disappeared.</p><p>Little Junior Brother, let’s go. We haven’t seen each other for half a year. Let’s go and have a few drinks!</p><p>Tian Chui grinned.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming readily agreed. The three of them went to Tian Chui’s cave abode. Tian Chui took out more than ten jars of fine wine. Xue ningxin was very forthright. She picked up a jar and drank it in one go.</p><p>“Junior Sister, drink slowly. I don’t have that much wine for you to drink like this!”</p><p>Tian Chui eagerly said.</p><p>“Stingy!”</p><p>Xue ningxin disdainfully glanced at Tian Chui, causing Tian Chui’s face to turn bitter.</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily and picked up a jar of fine wine. The three of them drank to their hearts ‘content.</p><p>After three rounds of drinks, Lu Ming bade farewell to Tian Chui and Xue ningxin, then strode out of Cloud Dragon Valley.</p><p>After a while, a beam of light cut through the void. Lu Ming stepped on the air and left Dragon God Valley.</p><p>Lu Ming did not take the space-breaking flying shuttle as it was meaningless.</p><p>Lu Ming did not have a goal for this trip. As the cloud Dragon Valley master had said, he wanted to walk in the natural world and borrow the Qi of nature to wear down the killing intent in the depths of his soul.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>In Lu Ming’s arms, the bubble called out. It opened its mouth and a long spear flew out from it.</p><p>“Black Dragon Spear!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Back then, when they were surrounded by many evil spirit cult experts, Lu Ming had thrown out the Black Dragon Spear and killed one of them. He did not manage to retrieve it in time and it turned out that it had been kept by Paopao.</p><p>Lu Ming grabbed the Black Dragon Spear and kept it in his sea of consciousness.</p><p>“Thank you, bubble!”</p><p>Lu Ming touched bubbles’s furry little head.</p><p>Paoba called out softly, revealing a comfortable expression. Then, she opened her mouth and five weapons flew out. All of them were Saint weapons.</p><p>A battle blade, a battle sword, an iron rod, a small mountain, and a Pagoda.</p><p>It was the Holy weapon that evil spirit had used to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>haha, bubble, you’re amazing!</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He waved his hand and put away the five holy weapons.</p><p>Following that, a few dozen more storage rings flew out from its mouth.</p><p>Needless to say, they were all storage rings left behind by the people who had besieged Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed and kept all of them.</p><p>Then, he took out all the spirit herbs and fed them to bubbles. Bubbles took a ginseng that was even bigger than his body and gnawed on it.</p><p>bubbles ‘cultivation base is also progressing very quickly!</p><p>Lu Ming sensed carefully with a smile on his face.</p><p>The Titan longhorn beetle had given bubbles a time and space spinel back then. With the help of the spinel, bubbles had improved rapidly.</p><p>Lu Ming’s flying speed was not fast. After he left the Dragon God Valley, his speed became even slower. He had no purpose and just flew as he pleased. If he sensed something or was thinking about something, he would stop.</p><p>Sometimes, when he saw the beautiful scenery, his mood was lifted. He would stop and enjoy the beautiful scenery.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming looked ahead and his expression changed.</p><p>In front of them, there was a huge fortress on a towering mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming’s thoughts could not help but go back to half a year ago. When he was drowned by the murderous intent, he had fought his way into a Castle. That castle was the one in front of him.</p><p>He didn’t expect that he would come to this place again.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
