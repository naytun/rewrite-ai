However, as long as they were strong enough, they could still destroy the opponent’s spirit body.</p><p>...</p><p>However, this monster seemed to be impossible to destroy with pure strength. Even the chaos realm had little effect on him.</p><p>no, this monster has a core. It’s in between the eyebrows!</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>When he scattered the monster again, he found that there was a black crystal in between the monster’s eyebrows. It was surrounded by demonic Qi and he had not noticed it before.</p><p>Moreover, the scattered demonic Qi had gathered there to reform the monster’s body.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and clawed at the monster’s glabella like a dragon’s claw. He grabbed a piece of crystal.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming retreated and took out the crystal.</p><p>Lu Ming took a look and saw a black crystal in his hand. There was a layer of black demonic fire on the crystal.</p><p>there’s a trace of intelligence on the crystal. Interesting. Destroy it!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. He poured his essential core into the crystal and the demonic fire on the crystal was immediately extinguished.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>When the demonic fire on the crystal was extinguished, the monster’s body exploded and turned into demonic Qi, dissipating in the air. It was impossible for it to reform.</p><p>This crystal was the core.</p><p>“This … Could it be the legendary demonic fiend crystal?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up as he sized up the crystal in his hand.</p><p>The demonic evil crystal was a very precious treasure. It could only be found in places with extremely rich demonic Qi.</p><p>The greatest function of the demonic fiend crystal was to temper the soul.</p><p>Through the refinement of the demonic fiend crystals, the soul force of a warrior would continuously increase.</p><p>“This place actually has demonic evil crystals!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were getting brighter and brighter.</p><p>Lu Ming had cultivated the divine sword technique. The demonic evil crystals were of great use to him.</p><p>Lu Ming’s soul force was dozens of times stronger than other martial artists of the same level due to the world refinement tribulation Bell.</p><p>In addition, cultivating the godly sword technique would also improve his soul force. Lu Ming’s current soul force was stronger than a peak ninth level martial Royal realm martial artist. It was even close to the soul force of a half-Saint.</p><p>With such powerful soul power, the divine sword technique could directly tear apart the soul of a martial artist of the same level and make the other party’s soul dissipate.</p><p>Even a martial artist at the peak Lv 9 martial Royal realm would be greatly affected, and his combat strength would be greatly reduced.</p><p>Even half-Saints could be affected by Lu Ming’s soul attack and their combat strength would be reduced.</p><p>If Lu Ming’s soul force continued to improve until it reached the level of a half-Saint or even stronger, he might be able to tear a half-saint’s soul apart when he used the divine sword technique. It would be a great boost to Lu Ming’s combat strength.</p><p>It was said that the more powerful a warrior was, the more emphasis they placed on their soul.</p><p>It was said that when one’s cultivation reached a certain realm, the soul was extremely important to a martial artist.</p><p>Hence, the value of demonic fiend crystals was shockingly high in the market.</p><p>“Are there still demonic evil crystals in this place?”</p><p>After Lu Ming put away the demonic fiend crystals, he dashed down the mountain peak and landed on a land with strange rocks.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming had just landed when a loud roar was heard. A huge Tiger pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>The giant Tiger was pitch-black and was emitting demonic Qi. It was also at the LV 6 martial Royal realm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and the giant Tiger exploded. Just like the human-shaped demonic creature, demonic Qi rolled and the giant Tiger’s body reappeared.</p><p>“As expected!”</p><p>With a quick glance just now, Lu Ming had indeed seen a crystal between the giant Tiger’s eyebrows.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and clawed through the space between the Tiger’s eyebrows. He took out a piece of crystal.</p><p>Demonic fiend crystal, it really was a demonic fiend crystal. There was also a layer of demonic fire on it, but it was destroyed by Lu Ming. The giant Tiger turned into demonic Qi and dissipated.</p><p>“Haha, this is really a treasure land!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. His figure flickered and he began to search for the demonic creature.</p><p>After traveling for a few miles, another demonic creature appeared. It was a giant wolf, also at the sixth level of the martial Royal realm. Lu Ming grabbed the demonic evil crystal between its eyebrows and continued to move forward.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>He did not see any demonic creatures for more than ten miles. However, after that, he heard loud roars. A total of six demonic creatures pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>One of them was at the LV 8 martial Royal realm, two were at the LV 7, and the other three were at the LV 6.</p><p>The six demons attacked at the same time, and their power was astonishing.</p><p>Lu Ming cast the wind element technique and his body flashed. He killed a sixth level martial Royal realm demonic creature in one move and took out the demonic evil crystal. At the same time, he flapped his black wings and scattered the rest of them into demonic Qi. However, the next moment, they immediately condensed again.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming continued to attack. He grabbed the demonic evil crystals of the other two Lv 6 martial Royal realm demonic creatures and kept them in the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Then, it pounced on a seventh level martial Royal realm demonic creature and clawed at it.</p><p>The demonic creature roared and twisted its head to avoid Lu Ming’s attack. Lu Ming’s claw landed on its body, causing it to explode. However, it immediately reappeared.</p><p>“You’re quite smart!”</p><p>Lu Ming mumbled and continued to grab the other two demons.</p><p>The two demonic creatures were very smart. They protected their heads well and did not let Lu Ming catch them. As for their bodies, they allowed Lu Ming to attack them as he pleased.</p><p>This kind of demonic creature was even more difficult to deal with than Warriors of the same level. They only needed to protect their heads and attack the other parts of their bodies crazily.</p><p>If not for Lu Ming’s powerful combat strength, they would have been in trouble.</p><p>“Nine seals of the divine Gate, let’s see how you can Dodge!”</p><p>Lu Ming formed a seal with both hands and seven sealing doors appeared in the sky.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming could already condense seven sealing gates.</p><p>The seven sealing gates emitted a brilliant light and instantly locked the three demons in place.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he instantly grabbed the demonic fiend crystals of the three demons. Then, he used his essential core to erase the spirituality on them.</p><p>The six demons turned into demonic Qi and disappeared.</p><p>the higher the cultivation of the demonic creature, the better the quality of the demonic evil crystal!</p><p>Lu Ming sized up the demonic evil crystal at the seventh level of the Martial Emperor realm and the eighth level of the Martial Emperor realm in his hands. He realized that the quality was indeed better than the demonic evil crystal of the sixth level Martial Emperor realm demonic creature.</p><p>After Lu Ming kept it, he continued to move forward.</p><p>There seemed to be a large number of demonic creatures in this place. As Lu Ming moved forward, he kept running into demonic creatures. He even encountered demonic creatures of the highest level, which were equivalent to the ninth level of the martial Royal realm.</p><p>The higher the level, the more powerful they were, and the harder it was to get demonic evil crystals.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had the nine seals of the divine Gate, a secret skill that could seal the other party’s movements. It was much more convenient.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming even called bubbles out to help.</p><p>With the space-time domain of the bubbles, it was even easier to seal these demons. Lu Ming was like a harvester, harvesting the demonic evil crystals.</p><p>Half a day later, Lu Ming had already obtained more than a hundred demonic fiend crystals.</p><p>There were people from the sixth level to the ninth level of the martial Royal realm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
