He’s really seeking his own death!</p><p>Yun Kai laughed sarcastically.</p><p>...</p><p>On the other side, Lu Ming suddenly stopped after flying for a distance. He turned around and looked behind him with a cold gaze.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Behind him, there was a slight fluctuation. A figure wrapped in a black robe appeared, holding a sword in his hand. It was a transparent sword as thin as a cicada’s wing.</p><p>“As an assassin, you dare to show yourself?”</p><p>Lu Ming said in a calm voice.</p><p>there’s no need to hide when dealing with a mere sixth level martial Royal realm expert like you!</p><p>The black-robed assassin said in a cold voice.</p><p>“Oh, really? Don’t you regret this!”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile.</p><p>“I’ll kill you with one sword strike!”</p><p>A cold voice rang out.</p><p>Then, the other party moved. In a flash, he crossed hundreds of meters in the air and appeared in front of Lu Ming in an instant. The long sword as thin as a cicada’s wing was aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>A holy weapon!</p><p>The sword that was as thin as a cicada’s wing was actually a holy weapon.</p><p>The terrifying sword gleam was unbelievably fast as it pierced towards Lu Ming’s throat.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar was heard from within Lu Ming’s body. Unknowingly, he had already put on the Liuyuan gloves. His essential core surged into the Liuyuan gloves madly, making them as heavy as a mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and the air was completely compressed together. It carried a terrifying force and blasted towards the other party.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The opponent’s long sword trembled non-stop. It actually broke through Lu Ming’s fist force and stabbed his fist.</p><p>With a clang, a terrifying force burst out from Lu Ming’s fist and gushed towards the other party with an earth-shattering force.</p><p>The other party’s expression changed drastically. The long sword that was as thin as a cicada’s wing trembled non-stop, and the other party’s figure was also sent flying by the terrifying power of this punch.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Blood spurted out of the other party’s mouth, wetting the black cloth around his mouth. The only eye that was exposed revealed was a look of shock.</p><p>“You … How can he be so powerful?”</p><p>The other party said in disbelief.</p><p>His cultivation was at the middle Lv 8 martial Royal realm, which was two levels higher than Lu Ming’s. He also had a superior earth spiritual body, but he was injured by Lu Ming’s punch in a head-on fight.</p><p>“You want to kill me with this little bit of power?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>Hmph, so what if you’re strong? I’m not good at strength, but assassination. Today, you’re still going to die!</p><p>The black-robed Assassin’s voice was cold. Then, he moved and disappeared.</p><p>It was as if he had disappeared into thin air.</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes and scanned his surroundings.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>All of a sudden, a ray of sword light shot toward Lu Ming from behind.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming twisted his body and threw a punch backward.</p><p>However, this punch hit nothing but air. A fist force flew out and created a huge pit on a mountain peak in the distance.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Immediately, a sword light appeared on Lu Ming’s left side and charged toward him. It was extremely fast and impossible to defend against.</p><p>Lu Ming threw another punch. Unfortunately, when he did so, the sword light disappeared again and Lu Ming landed in the air.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Then, terrifying sword gleams rang out continuously. At the same time, seven to eight sword gleams shot toward Lu Ming from all directions.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The Black Dragon Spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hands and he swept it across.</p><p>The long spear swept in all directions and all the sword hums disappeared. However, it still did not hit the other party. At the critical moment, the other party dodged Lu Ming’s attack with a terrifying movement technique.</p><p>“Let’s see how many of my moves you can Dodge. When you lose your mind, you will die!”</p><p>A cold voice rang in the air. However, it did not come from a single direction. Instead, it kept changing. It was as if the direction would change with every word that was spoken. Lu Ming could not tell where the other party was.</p><p>The other party’s assassination technique was indeed very terrifying. Those who were targeted by him had to maintain a high level of concentration at all times, because if they were not careful, the other party would seize the opportunity and kill them in one blow.</p><p>To maintain such a high level of concentration for a long time, one’s mind would be exhausted, and in that case, it would be a dead end.</p><p>Therefore, when Yun Xi, Yun Kai, and the others found out that they were assassins from the thousand-kill mansion, their faces turned ugly.</p><p>The assassins of the thousand-kill mansion were synonymous with nightmares. Once they were targeted, they would have a slim chance of survival!</p><p>Lu Ming held the long spear in his hand and stood still in the void. He spread out his spiritual sense and an inexplicable smile appeared at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming moved.</p><p>The Black Dragon Spear suddenly stabbed backward. He became one with the spear like a Black Lightning.</p><p>This spear seemed to be piercing through the air.</p><p>However, in the next moment, a scream was heard. The black-robed Assassin’s figure was revealed, and Lu Ming’s long spear had pierced through his dantian.</p><p>The black-robed Assassin’s eyes widened in disbelief. He roared, ” “How is that possible? How did you discover me?”</p><p>I’m sorry, but my soul force is many times stronger than other Warriors of the same level. You can hide your body and your aura, but it’s hard to hide your soul fluctuations!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“So that’s how it is! Haha, but if you kill me, you’ll also die!”</p><p>The black-robed assassin suddenly laughed crazily. As he laughed, he stopped breathing.</p><p>The spear attack just now had already shattered the opponent’s spiritual God.</p><p>Lu Ming pulled out his long spear and reached out to grab the other party’s storage ring.</p><p>The black-robed assassin was too confident in his concealment technique. Therefore, when Lu Ming made his move, he was completely defenseless and was easily killed by Lu Ming with one shot.</p><p>If the other party was on guard, it would not be easy for Lu Ming to kill him. The other party was also a top-notch heaven’s favorite and his movement technique was extremely strange.</p><p>Huala!</p><p>With a flap of his black wings, Lu Ming flew in the direction of Yun Xi and the others.</p><p>At this moment, Yun Xi, Yun Kai, and the other two were hiding in a Canyon, carefully defending themselves.</p><p>“We must find an opportunity to severely injure this assassin. Otherwise, when the other assassin kills Lu Ming and returns, we’ll be facing two assassins. Even if we’re in this Canyon, we’ll be in danger!”</p><p>Yun Kai said.</p><p>He felt that Lu Ming was dead for sure.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the sound of something flying through the air could be heard from afar. Lu Ming was flying over.</p><p>Yun Kai’s eyes suddenly widened as he revealed a look of disbelief. it’s Lu Ming. He’s not dead. He’s being hunted down by an assassin from the house of a thousand kills. He’s not dead? ”</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s cultivation base, he should be dead for sure if he were to face a terrifying killer from the thousand-kills mansion.</p><p>“I’m sorry to disappoint you!”</p><p>Lu Ming stood high in the sky and looked down at the clouds.</p><p>“Hmph, I was just lucky!”</p><p>Yun Kai coldly snorted.</p><p>Hu …</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly swooped down and rushed into the canyon.</p><p>However, just as they were about to reach the canyon, Lu Ming suddenly turned around and thrust his spear at a void.</p><p>Wherever the long spear passed, the air would let out a terrifying whistling sound and the space would ripple. In front of the long spear, the figure of a Man in Black was revealed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
