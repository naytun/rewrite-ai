He nodded and said, ” “Since you live here, do you know when the Phoenix’s cry in the heavenly wind Plains started?”</p><p>“About half a month ago, it was very loud, but now, it seems to be getting weaker and weaker!”</p><p>...</p><p>The village chief answered honestly.</p><p>“Oh? Half a month ago? Do you have any legends about the heavenly wind Plains in your village? tell me in detail!”</p><p>The icily arrogant middle-aged man ordered.</p><p>The village chief told him about the legend of the breezy Plains in detail.</p><p>After the village chief finished speaking, the few heaven God sect disciples frowned and pondered. Then, their eyes swept across the village chief’s courtyard, hoping to find some clues.</p><p>All of a sudden, the middle-aged man’s eyes lit up. He took a step forward and appeared in front of a chair in the courtyard. After taking a closer look, he revealed a surprised expression. Phoenix incense wood, this is actually made of Phoenix incense wood. To actually make a chair out of Phoenix incense wood, this is simply a waste of God’s gift!</p><p>With that, he waved his hand and kept the chair.</p><p>The other middle-aged men were envious as they looked around.</p><p>“That stool is also made of Phoenix incense wood!”</p><p>“And this bamboo steamer is also made of Phoenix incense wood!”</p><p>The middle-aged men’s eyes lit up, and their bodies flickered as they collected all the items.</p><p>“Haha, the bed inside too!”</p><p>The arrogant youth laughed and was about to rush into the room.</p><p>“Hey, how can you guys be like this? That’s my bed. If you take it away, where will I sleep?”</p><p>Feng Ling couldn’t help but call out.</p><p>“What did you just say?”</p><p>The icily arrogant middle-aged man turned around and a powerful aura pressed down on Feng Ling. Feng Ling’s body trembled and she retreated continuously, blood flowing out of her mouth.</p><p>However, Feng Ling was extremely stubborn and was about to speak again. The village chief quickly went forward and stopped Feng Ling. He cupped his fists towards the few burly men of the heavenly God sect and said, ” “Milords, please forgive me. My granddaughter is still young and insensible. Milords are all heroic figures, please don’t lower yourself to her level!”</p><p>“Keep her mouth shut, or she won’t even know how she died!”</p><p>The icily arrogant middle-aged man said coldly.</p><p>The village chief naturally agreed.</p><p>The icily arrogant middle-aged man walked into the room and kept Feng Ling’s bed.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>&Nbsp; at this moment, a wooden house in another part of the village collapsed, sending dust and smoke into the air. A few green-robed youths took away a wooden pillar.</p><p>Obviously, other than the few men from the heavenly God sect, there were other people who had come to the village and found the Phoenix incense wood.</p><p>there’s still more in the other houses. Let’s go. Don’t let the people from the desire poison sect finish taking them!</p><p>When the few burly men of the heaven God sect saw this, they immediately rushed to the houses of the other villagers.</p><p>In their eyes, this village was simply a treasure trove. They had to plunder it clean before anyone else discovered it.</p><p>A few burly men from the heaven deity sect rushed to the houses of the other villagers and started plundering them wantonly. Any villagers who tried to stop them would be sent flying with a slap.</p><p>“Grandpa, what kind of big sect are these disciples from? they’re like bandits!”</p><p>Feng Ling was indignant.</p><p>“Sigh, the world of martial Dao has always been the law of the jungle!”</p><p>Village chief sighed, and in the next moment, his expression suddenly changed as he shouted, ” “No, that’s the ancestral hall!”</p><p>After saying that, the village chief hurriedly rushed towards the largest stone house, and Feng Ling quickly followed.</p><p>At this moment, the few burly men of the heaven God sect and a few green-robed young men had already arrived in front of the stone house.</p><p>those memorial tablets inside are actually all Phoenix incense wood. We’re rich, we’re rich!</p><p>A burly man from the heaven God sect cried out in surprise.</p><p>“That’s ours!”</p><p>The green-robed young men’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it, we found it first!”</p><p>The cold and arrogant middle-aged man from the heavenly God sect said.</p><p>The few of them strode forward and were about to rush into the stone house.</p><p>“Milords, milords, please wait!”</p><p>The village chief rushed over and blocked the stone house. He bowed and paid his respects.</p><p>“Old man, what are you doing? Get lost!”</p><p>The cold and arrogant middle-aged man berated.</p><p>my Lords, inside are the memorial tablets of my village’s ancestors. Please don’t take them away. I’m begging you!</p><p>The village chief immediately knelt down and kowtowed repeatedly.</p><p>In the stone house, there were the memorial tablets of the village’s ancestors. Other things could be taken away, but he could not let others take away the memorial tablets.</p><p>Otherwise, how would he have the face to face his ancestors?</p><p>“You old fart, get lost!”</p><p>The icily arrogant middle-aged man kicked out and sent the village chief flying. The wall of the stone house was smashed into pieces. The village chief sprawled on the ground and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Grandpa!”</p><p>Feng Ling shouted and rushed towards the village chief to help him up. Seeing that the village chief was only injured, she was relieved. She then glared at the cold and arrogant burly man and the others, scolding, ” I can’t believe you’re the disciples of a big sect. You’re no different from bandits. No, you’re even worse than bandits. You even want to snatch the memorial tablets of other people’s ancestors!</p><p>“Little slut, what did you say? You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The icily arrogant middle-aged man’s body emitted an icy cold killing intent. He took a step forward and appeared in front of Feng Ling, sending a slap towards her.</p><p>The icily arrogant middle-aged man had already used some of his strength in this slap. With Feng Ling’s cultivation base, she would definitely die from this slap.</p><p>However, the arrogant middle-aged man’s palm was caught by a large hand halfway.</p><p>A dark-faced young man had appeared in front of Feng Ling without her noticing and grabbed the icily arrogant middle-aged man’s wrist.</p><p>The black-faced young man was Lu Ming.</p><p>Just now, he had gone to the outskirts of the Windy Plains to check out the situation. He had not found anything unusual, so he returned to the village. He did not expect to see this scene.</p><p>“Big brother Lu!”</p><p>Feng Ling called out subconsciously.</p><p>“I’m sorry I’m late!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded to Feng Ling and the village chief.</p><p>“Brat, you dare to stop me? you’re courting death!”</p><p>The arrogant middle-aged man saw that the person who was holding him was a black-faced young man who looked very ordinary. In addition to the conversation between Lu Ming and Feng Ling, he thought that Lu Ming was from this small village. He immediately roared and his killing intent burst out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The essential core in his body exploded, trying to break Lu Ming’s palm.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold. He clenched his fist and a terrifying force rushed towards the other party.</p><p>&Nbsp; Kacha Kacha …</p><p>In an instant, the icily arrogant middle-aged man’s true energy was scattered. The bones in his arm were broken inch by inch, like a piece of mud.</p><p>“Ah, ah, ah, my hand!”</p><p>The icily arrogant middle-aged man screamed in pain.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming grabbed the cold and arrogant middle-aged man’s arm, lifted him up, and threw him heavily on the ground as if he was a broken sack.</p><p>The ground trembled as the arrogant middle-aged man smashed a human-shaped hole in the ground. Lying in the hole, he coughed out a large mouthful of blood. All the bones in his body were broken, and he was like a pool of mud.</p><p>On the side, the other burly men of the heavenly God sect and the green-robed young man were stunned for a moment. Then, a few of the burly men of the heavenly God sect shouted crazily, ” “Brat, you dare to hit the people of my Tian Shen sect, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>“I’m going to skin you alive!”</p><p>“You’re too noisy!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He moved his body and then heard banging sounds and shrill screams. When Lu Ming reappeared, the people from the deity sect and the green-robed young man were all lying on the ground, wailing. They were stacked on top of each other, and it was unknown how many bones in their bodies had been broken.</p><p>Their storage rings were all in Lu Ming’s hands.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
