Yun Kai’s eyes turned red with jealousy.</p><p>He roared in anger and wanted to get the demonic fiend crystals as well. However, after fighting with a demonic creature for a long time, he only managed to get one. On the other hand, Lu Ming had nearly a hundred demonic fiend crystals in his account.</p><p>...</p><p>There were more than a hundred monsters running out of the canyon, but only a dozen were left.</p><p>At this moment, a few young men flew over from the sky.</p><p>As soon as the few young men arrived, their eyes were immediately attracted to Lu Ming.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming was casting the nine seals of the gate of God. Seven gates of sealing sealed seven demons and seized seven demonic fiend crystals.</p><p>“What a powerful sealing technique!”</p><p>One of the young men’s eyes lit up.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming also noticed that the few youths in the sky had cast the gate of seal again to seal the remaining demons and seize the demonic fiend crystals. Then, he moved his body and was about to leave the place.</p><p>However, in the sky, the few young men’s figures flashed and surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>“What business do you have here?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked coldly.</p><p>“It’s nothing. We saw that your sealing technique was not bad, so we wanted to cooperate with you!”</p><p>One of the short-haired young men said with a faint smile. The aura of a ninth level martial Royal realm expert was released from his body and locked onto Lu Ming.</p><p>“Cooperation? I’m not interested, I prefer to be alone!”</p><p>Lu Ming rejected him directly.</p><p>After being rejected by Lu Ming, the short-haired teenager’s face turned cold. He said in a threatening tone, ” brat, you’re only at the seventh level of the martial Royal realm. You’d better see the situation clearly!</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the aura on his body grew stronger, forming a terrifying pressure that pressed down on Lu Ming. The threat was self-evident.</p><p>At the same time, the other three young men also released their auras and pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>One peak Lv 9 martial Royal realm and two peak Lv 8 martial Royal realm experts!</p><p>The four experts surrounded Lu Ming with gloomy eyes.</p><p>Not far away, Yun Kai was gloating.</p><p>“Haha, who told this brat to be so arrogant? let’s see how he dies now! Yun Xi, this has nothing to do with us, so you’d better not interfere!”</p><p>Yun Kai sneered and reminded Yun Xi not to make a move.</p><p>Yun Xi frowned. However, the other party had two people in the ninth level of the martial Royal realm. Even if she wanted to help, she was afraid that she would be powerless.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold. He looked around and spat out a word coldly, ” “Get lost!”</p><p>His words made the four young men’s faces sink.</p><p>brat, if it wasn’t for the fact that you have some value, I would’ve slapped you to death right now. Now, I’ll give you two options. The first is to hand over the demonic evil crystals you have, and then obediently follow us and help us hunt for demonic evil crystals!</p><p>“The second option is death. Which one do you choose?”</p><p>The short-haired teenager said coldly.</p><p>“I’ll choose the other two paths!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Which two?”</p><p>The short-haired teenager was stunned and asked subconsciously.</p><p>the first condition is for you to get lost immediately. The second condition is for you to die!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The four young men were stunned.</p><p>“Brat, you dare to play with us? you’re looking for death!”</p><p>The short-haired teenager’s eyes were filled with cold killing intent. A lightning sword appeared in his hand and he slashed it at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and activated his divine sword technique, attacking the other party’s soul.</p><p>The short-haired teenager’s sword stopped halfway and he roared.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming held the Black Dragon Spear and pierced through the short-haired man, nailing him to the ground.</p><p>Since he was going to make a move, Lu Ming would not show any mercy. He immediately launched a thunderous attack and killed his opponent.</p><p>The other three people were stunned. They never expected Lu Ming to be so terrifying that he could kill the short-haired teenager in one move.</p><p>The short-haired teenager was a ninth level martial Royal realm expert, two levels higher than Lu Ming. Yet, he was killed in one move.</p><p>By the time the three of them reacted, it was already too late.</p><p>The seven sealing gates appeared around them, and the terrifying sealing power made it difficult for them to move.</p><p>They unleashed their full power in an attempt to destroy the sealing gate.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Then, the godly sword technique burst out and stabbed into the three people’s bodies. Their souls felt like they were about to be torn apart.</p><p>“Ah, no, spare my life …”</p><p>The three young men shouted in fear.</p><p>However, what welcomed them were Lu Ming’s three terrifying spear tips.</p><p>The spear light pierced through the three young men and they all died.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, Lu Ming kept the four young men’s storage rings, then cast a cold glance at Yun Kai.</p><p>Yun Kai’s entire body trembled in fear, his heart turning cold and his face as pale as a sheet.</p><p>Four experts, including those in the ninth level of the martial Royal realm, could not even fight back against Lu Ming. They were killed in an instant. With such combat strength, killing him was as easy as turning over his hand.</p><p>“This Lu Ming, how is he so strong? how can he be so strong?”</p><p>Yun Kai roared in his heart.</p><p>Although they both had a superior-grade earth spiritual body, Lu Ming’s combat strength was much higher than the others. It was hard for him to accept.</p><p>In fact, Lu Ming’s combat strength was not much higher than that of the short-haired teenager.</p><p>Earlier on, the few of them had underestimated Lu Ming. Lu Ming’s godly sword technique and the nine seals of the divine Gate worked together flawlessly. It was too amazing. As long as one’s combat strength did not exceed Lu Ming’s by too much, one would only be dead under Lu Ming’s attack.</p><p>If he was a half-Saint, Lu Ming’s two moves would not be of much use.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current soul force was barely close to that of a half-Saint. Although the divine sword technique could shake the soul of a half-Saint, it would not be so serious and the other party would be able to resist it.</p><p>The nine seals of the gate of God would also be defeated by the other party.</p><p>However, a ninth level martial Royal realm upper earthly spiritual body genius could not withstand two moves from Lu Ming. Lu Ming could indeed kill him easily.</p><p>Lu Ming cast a cold glance at Yun Kai. Then, he flapped his black wings and soared into the sky, leaving the place.</p><p>Hu …</p><p>After Lu Ming left, Yun Kai heaved a long sigh of relief. The pressure that Lu Ming had given him just now was too great.</p><p>“This kid!”</p><p>Yun Kai gritted his teeth.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>At this time, a few more demonic creatures rushed out of the canyon. Yun Xi and the others gathered their thoughts and began to fight the demonic creatures.</p><p>There were only a few demonic creatures, so it wasn’t difficult for them to take care of them. It didn’t take long for them to seize the demonic evil crystals.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At this time, there was another sound in the sky. Three figures appeared above them, and a terrifying pressure pressed down on the four of them.</p><p>it’s them! The WAN clan’s chosen!</p><p>Yun Kai said with a pale face.</p><p>The three people in the sky were the distinguished young man from the WAN family and the two young men in purple.</p><p>so you are from the cloud Emperor mountain. Now, hand over all the demonic evil crystals you have!</p><p>A young man in purple stepped out and said coldly.</p><p>“What? You want to Rob our demonic fiend crystals?”</p><p>Yun Xi said angrily.</p><p>if you don’t give it to us, we’ll kill you. Hurry up, we don’t have time to waste on you!</p><p>The young man in purple said.</p><p>“You guys …”</p><p>Yun Xi was furious, but she was helpless. She glanced at the noble young man with fear.</p><p>That noble young man was definitely an extremely terrifying figure. The pressure he gave her was too great.</p><p>She had a feeling that the noble young man only needed one move to kill her.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
