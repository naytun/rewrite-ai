There were all kinds of blacksmithing materials, both low-level and high-level.</p><p>Xue ningxin was in charge of picking out the shiny forging materials while Lu Ming and Tian Chui were free to do as they pleased. After Xue ningxin was done picking, the two of them divided the materials and kept them.</p><p>As for spirit weapons, Xue ningxin was the same. She specifically picked the shiny and good-looking spirit weapons. As for those night-luminescent pearls, jadeite, and other gemstones that were of no use to Lu Ming and Tian Chui, Xue ningxin’s eyes lit up as she put them away, leaving Lu Ming and Tian Chui rather speechless.</p><p>Finally, it was the Holy weapon!</p><p>There were 13 Saint weapons in total, floating in the shuttle, giving off mysterious waves.</p><p>The thirteen Saint weapons were all bright Saint weapons.</p><p>After all, great saint weapons were extremely rare in the Azure continent.</p><p>“There are thirteen Saint weapons in total. We’ll take four each, and the last one will go to eighth Senior Sister. This time, if it wasn’t for her, we wouldn’t have been able to open the door. What do you think, seventh senior brother?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Of course you can!”</p><p>Tian Chui grinned.</p><p>“I’ll take one more piece. How can I accept that?”</p><p>Xue ning said in her heart, but her eyes had long been fixed on a long sword. This long sword was inlaid with seven different colored gemstones, which were very beautiful.</p><p>“Senior Sister, you can choose first!” Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“I want this sword!”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming finished speaking, Xue ningxin grabbed the sword in her hand and could not bear to let go.</p><p>you guys can choose. I only need this sword. The rest is up to you!</p><p>Xue ningxin said.</p><p>“Then this hammer is mine!”</p><p>Tian Chui’s eyes were fixed on a large purple-gold hammer. He grabbed it in his hand and was quite satisfied.</p><p>this Hammer’s handle is too short. Looks like I’ll have to find an inscription master to reforge it!</p><p>Tian Chui took the large hammer and waved it around a few times, extremely happy.</p><p>Lu Ming reached out and grabbed a long spear.</p><p>The spear was pitch-black with a Black Dragon coiled around it. It looked mysterious and domineering.</p><p>“I’ve finally obtained a Holy Spear!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile on his face.</p><p>The power of the thirteen strikes would definitely be stronger if he used the Holy weapon spear.</p><p>Unfortunately, none of the 13 Saint weapons were gloves.</p><p>The three of them were quite happy to have obtained their own Saint weapons, so they could choose any of the remaining Saint weapons they wanted.</p><p>Lu Ming picked three more items, and so did the heavenly hammer. Xue ningxin kept the remaining four items.</p><p>This trip could be said to be a fruitful one.</p><p>Just a Saint weapon alone was worth a million contribution points. How many treasures could it be exchanged for? For example, he could probably exchange for a pile of Nirvana pills.</p><p>I’ll call this spear the Black Dragon Spear. It’ll be enough for me to use for a while. I wonder when the infinite Dragon Spear will be able to become a holy weapon!</p><p>Lu Ming mumbled in a low voice.</p><p>At that moment, Ming Lian sat cross-legged in the mountain and river diagram. The infinite Dragon Spear was suspended in his palm. Pieces of precious refining materials were wrapped in golden spiritual fire and slowly integrated into the infinite Dragon Spear.</p><p>Currently, Lu Ming had a lot of precious refining materials on hand. As long as he continuously integrated precious metal materials into the infinite Dragon Spear, it would be upgraded. Besides the inscription refinement secondary body cultivation, he would refine the infinite Dragon Spear.</p><p>this Black Dragon Spear can be refined during this period of time!</p><p>Lu Ming held the infinite Dragon Spear and was about to channel his essential core.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Right at this moment, the Black Dragon Spear began to vibrate slightly.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Following that, the Black Dragon Spear began to shake more and more violently. The spear began to glow, and the Black Dragon that was wrapped around it seemed to come alive.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Xue ningxin and Tian Chui both looked over curiously.</p><p>I don’t know. This spear suddenly started vibrating on its own!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Black Dragon Spear vibrated and floated in the air. The tip of the spear pointed in a certain direction.</p><p>“The tip of the spear is pointing in the right direction. Could it be that there’s something in that direction that’s attracting the Black Dragon Spear?”</p><p>Lu Ming made a guess.</p><p>As the shuttle flew forward, the tip of the Black Dragon Spear also turned slightly, but it always pointed in one direction.</p><p>There was definitely something in that direction that was attracting the Black Dragon Spear.</p><p>“Junior Brother, let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Xue ningxin said.</p><p>“Alright, but you can’t take the space-breaking flying shuttle!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The Black Dragon Spear belonged to the Black Dragon of the Dragon Palace. The Black Dragon Spear’s abnormality might be related to the Black Dragon. However, they had seen the divine Son and Wang Jian chasing after the Black Dragon. If the divine Son and Wang Jian were in front of them, they had to be on guard.</p><p>The three of them disembarked from the shuttle. Tian Chui kept the shuttle and the three of them concealed their auras. Following the Black Dragon Spear’s direction, they flew forward.</p><p>The more he flew, the louder and more intense the Black Dragon Spear’s buzzing sound became.</p><p>Not long after, they flew to a mountain range.</p><p>“That is … That Black Dragon’s corpse!”</p><p>Xue ningxin exclaimed.</p><p>Lu Ming and Tian Chui both looked in the same direction.</p><p>In a Mountain Valley, a huge black Dragon lay there quietly. There was no aura coming from it, and it was motionless.</p><p>the Saint realm Black Dragon’s corpse escaped. The divine Son and the others didn’t catch it!</p><p>Xue ningxin’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“The brand on its body has completely disappeared!”</p><p>Lu Ming sensed for a moment.</p><p>After the battle with the Divine Child and the others, the inextinguishable brand on the Black Dragon’s corpse had already disappeared. Now, it had truly become a dragon corpse.</p><p>The three of them flew down the hill. Lu Ming and Tian Chui exchanged a look, their eyes burning with passion.</p><p>“Eighth Junior Sister, this …”</p><p>Tian Chui hesitated, not knowing what to say for a moment.</p><p>This Dragon’s corpse was definitely priceless, but Xue ningxin was a true dragon, just like the Black Dragon. If they touched the Dragon’s corpse, who knew what Xue ningxin would think.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming and Tian Chui were a little hesitant.</p><p>“Are you guys worried about me? There’s no need for that. Whether it’s the human race or the demon race, cultivation is all about pillaging. Pillaging the original Qi of heaven and earth, pillaging the heaven and earth, pillaging others, even if we’re of the same race. Moreover, this is a Black Dragon, a different race from me!”</p><p>Xue ningxin said.</p><p>With that, a Saint weapon longsword appeared in Xue ningxin’s hand. She stabbed it into the dragon’s head and dug out a crystal.</p><p>The Dragon Crystal was condensed after the true dragon Tribe entered the Saint realm. It was like the Saint heart of human warriors.</p><p>this Dragon Crystal belongs to me now. It’ll be of great help to my cultivation!</p><p>Xue ningxin said.</p><p>alright, haha. Little Junior Brother, what do you need? ”</p><p>Tian Chui asked Lu Ming.</p><p>“I just need some dragon bones!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The effect of the Dragon bones on Lu Ming’s cultivation of the Dragon God combat body was second only to the blood essence of a true dragon.</p><p>However, this true dragon had been dead for who knew how many years, and its blood essence had long dissipated.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
