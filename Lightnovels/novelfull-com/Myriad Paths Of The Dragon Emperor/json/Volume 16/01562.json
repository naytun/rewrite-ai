You didn’t have a choice. That’s why Xiangxiang Beila isn’t afraid of big brother now. She also doesn’t hate big brother!</p><p>...</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila spoke. Her voice was very tender, but it was reasonable.</p><p>en, big brother thanks Xiang Xiang. Then, this matter will be a secret between the two of us. Xiang Xiang, don’t tell anyone, not even your mother, okay? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said gently.</p><p>“En, alright, Xiang Xiang won’t say it. If Xiang Xiang says it, mother and the others will be afraid of big brother!”</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila shook her head. Her small braids swayed, and she looked very cute.</p><p>“Good Xiang Xiang!”</p><p>“Xiangxiang, big brother will take you in as a disciple and teach you martial arts. What do you think?” Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>To be honest, Lu Ming was really tempted to take him in as a disciple.</p><p>The body of life was too shocking. If other people knew about this, countless experts would fight to take Xiangxiang as their disciple. Even some great emperors would fight to take her as their disciple.</p><p>Lu Ming did not want to miss out on such a good opportunity.</p><p>Perhaps, this was karma, fate.</p><p>“Good, good, Xiangxiang has long wanted to cultivate martial arts!”</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila happily nodded her head.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He then nodded at the young woman in the distance and the two of them flew over.</p><p>“The two of you, Lu Ming has the intention to take Xiangxiang as his disciple, and she has agreed!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Thank you, young master. Xiangxiang, why aren’t you kneeling to pay respects to master?”</p><p>The young woman was overjoyed.</p><p>“Xiangxiang Beila pays her respects to master!”</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila knelt down obediently and kowtowed to Lu Ming, acknowledging him as her master.</p><p>“En, quickly get up!”</p><p>Lu Ming hurriedly helped Xiangxiang Beila up, feeling overjoyed. Then, he stretched out his finger and touched the space between Xiangxiang Beila’s eyebrows. A ray of light flashed and disappeared.</p><p>Xiangxiang, I’ve passed on a cultivation technique to you. Your physique should be very suitable for this step of the cultivation technique. In the future, cultivate according to this cultivation technique!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The cultivation technique that he had just passed on to Xiangxiang was called the ‘universal Scripture’. It was also a cultivation technique from the nine Dragons’ memory. It was very brilliant and mysterious. However, Lu Ming’s physique did not match it and he could not cultivate it at all. However, it was the best to pass it on to Xiangxiang as a Foundation.</p><p>Lu Ming took Xiangxiang as his disciple and taught her cultivation techniques. The young woman was very happy. She felt that she had become more familiar with Lu Ming and started chatting with him.</p><p>Through their conversation, Lu Ming learned that the young woman’s name was Liu Wanjun. Xiangxiang’s mother was the young Madam of the Lu clan. Xiangxiang’s father was the young master of the Lu clan. However, he had passed away a few years ago when he was out adventuring.</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila’s grandfather was the clan head of the Lu clan Fort. Back then, when Lu Ming went berserk and attacked, Xiangxiang Beila’s grandfather was in seclusion, so he managed to escape.</p><p>Lu Ming secretly rejoiced. Fortunately, the person closest to Xiangxiang Beila did not die in his hands. Otherwise, Xiangxiang Beila might have a grudge against him.</p><p>Thump! Thump! Thump!</p><p>At that moment, a loud drum sound was heard from the Lu clan Fort. It was the sound of war drums.</p><p>“Enemy attack, enemy attack!”</p><p>“The Zhao family, it’s the Zhao family!”</p><p>An anxious shout was heard as figures rushed out of the Lu clan’s Fort. At the same time, the entire Lu clan’s Fort glowed with a brilliant light as the formation was activated.</p><p>Liu Wanjun and the middle-aged man’s expressions changed.</p><p>“The Zhao clan is here again, damn it!”</p><p>The middle-aged man was furious.</p><p>“I’m afraid that they’re not here with good intentions!”</p><p>Liu Wanjun’s expression was grave.</p><p>young Madam, you guys stay here. I’ll go take a look!</p><p>The middle-aged man flew toward the front of the castle and met up with the other people from the Lu clan.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>let’s go, ” Lu Ming said as he held Xiangxiang Beila’s hand and walked forward. Liu Wanjun quickly followed.</p><p>There were already many figures standing in front of the Lu clan’s Fort. They were all experts from the Lu clan. However, Lu Ming noticed that there were not many experts at a glance. There were pitifully few high-level martial emperors above the seventh level Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>The leader of the group was an old man with white hair and a white beard. He seemed to be at Lv 8 martial Royal realm.</p><p>“Grandpa!”</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila called out softly as she looked at the old man.</p><p>Outside the Lu clan’s Fort, there was a huge warship. The warship was towering and menacing, and a terrifying aura emanated from it.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A burly middle-aged man stepped out of the warship. His aura was violent and his cultivation was at Lv 8 martial Royal realm.</p><p>“This is Zhao Tianba, the head of the Zhao family!”</p><p>Liu Wanjun stood beside Lu Ming and whispered.</p><p>“Old Lu, I’ve given you a month’s time. Have you thought about it? Hurry up and surrender to the Zhao family!”</p><p>Zhao Tianba’s voice reverberated throughout the entire Lu clan Fort.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila’s grandfather shouted.</p><p>Zhao Tianba’s face darkened,”If you don’t surrender, I’ll kill every single one of you in the Lu clan Fort!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The aura on Zhao Tianba’s body became even more violent, and it pressed toward Xiangxiang Beila’s grandfather.</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila’s grandfather did not give in at all and used his aura to resist.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked Liu Wanjun.</p><p>half a year ago, the Lu clan encountered a great disaster. A demon descended upon us and many high-level martial Royal realm experts died in our hands. Our strength was greatly weakened. The Zhao clan took advantage of this and tried to take over the Lu clan. They came here once a month and said that they would give the Lu clan a month to consider. Otherwise, they would raze the Lu clan to the ground!</p><p>Liu Wanjun explained.</p><p>Lu Ming had a sudden realization.</p><p>In the world of martial Dao, the strong preyed on the weak. Regardless of whether it was a large sect or a small faction, it was the same. Without strength, one would be swallowed up by other factions.</p><p>Weren’t the thirteen top powers of the Azure continent the same?</p><p>If a large number of sages in Dragon God Valley died, the tianshen sect and other sects would immediately send people to Annex Dragon God Valley.</p><p>old Lu, if the Lu family is looking for death, don’t blame us. Don’t think that you can stop the Zhao family with a broken formation!</p><p>Zhao Tianba coldly said.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>One figure after another flew out of the huge warship.</p><p>The moment these figures flew onto the warship and stood in front of the Lu clan’s Fort, their powerful auras burst forth, forming a terrifying pressure.</p><p>Many of them were high-level martial Royal realm experts, above the seventh level.</p><p>The terrifying aura made the people from the Lu clan’s Fort turn pale.</p><p>so many experts. Did the Zhao clan turn out in full strength? ”</p><p>“They’re determined to get our Lu clan Fort!”</p><p>Many people from the Lu clan’s Fort spoke out, their voices trembling.</p><p>The Lu clan had suffered heavy losses, how could they fight against the Zhao clan?</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>An old man stepped out from the crowd of the Zhao clan. His terrifying aura spread out, causing the expressions of many people from the Lu clan to turn even uglier.</p><p>Lv 9 martial Royal realm!</p><p>The old man from the Zhao clan was a Lv 9 martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>In forces like the Lu clan and the Zhao clan, Lv 9 martial Royal realm was the peak of existence and dominated everything.</p><p>The Lu clan Fort had a ninth level martial Royal realm Grand Elder. Unfortunately, he was killed by the demon half a year ago.</p><p>“Lu clan, if you don’t surrender, then don’t even spare a chicken or a dog!”</p><p>The ninth-level martial Royal realm elder from the Zhao clan spoke coldly as he struck his palm toward the Lu clan’s Castle.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
