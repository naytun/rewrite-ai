Bubble’s true body had already appeared on the other side of the black-robed half-Saint. With a wave of her claws, the space-time domain enveloped the half-Saint.</p><p>...</p><p>On the other side, Lu Ming’s Black wings flapped like two blades and slashed at the black-robed half-Saint. At the same time, his vital essence Gale poured into the Liuyuan gloves and he punched the half-Saint.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The black-robed half-saint’s expression did not change in the face of Lu Ming and bubbles ‘joint attack. He released his sword radiance and slashed twice.</p><p>With one stroke, he broke the bubble’s space-time domain. With another stroke, he blocked Hei Yu Feng’s attack and slashed at Lu Ming’s fist.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s fist seemed to have collided with a terrifying force. His body shook violently and he was sent flying. At the same time, a powerful force passed through the flowing essence gloves and blasted into Lu Ming’s body, causing him to spit out blood.</p><p>The power of laws!</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. The power of the law was too strong.</p><p>Laws were the foundation of heaven and earth. A world was made up of different laws. The power of these laws far exceeded that of a domain.</p><p>No matter how mysterious Lu Ming’s Chaos Domain was, it was still a domain after all. It was difficult for it to resist the corrosion of the law power.</p><p>In the future, Lu Ming would be able to turn the chaos realm into the Laws of Chaos. That way, he would be able to suppress other laws.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>Bubbles shouted and used the spacetime domain. Its body kept flashing around the black-robed half-saint’s body. It kept attacking and was extremely agile. The black-robed half-Saint couldn’t hit it at all.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>At this point, the black-robed half-Saint seemed to be really angry with Pao Pao. With a cold shout, a terrifying aura exploded from his body.</p><p>A terrifying true essence, like black demonic fire burning, blasted in all directions.</p><p>The black-robed half-Saint exploded his extremely powerful genuine vitality and crushed in all directions.</p><p>With that, there was no way for paoba to Dodge and her body was sent flying by this surge of primeval essence.</p><p>“Suppress him!”</p><p>The black-robed half-saint’s cold voice sounded.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The 12 Men in Black controlled the array discs and suppressed the bubbles, sealing the void.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The black-robed half-Saint used his powerful vital essence to send Paopao flying into the area.</p><p>The 12 Men in Black controlled the array disc and sealed the area, trapping the bubble in the void.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>Bubbles cried out and used the spacetime domain in an attempt to rush out. However, the void seemed to have become an iron wall and was completely confined. Bubbles could not rush out at all.</p><p>“Release him!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared and flapped his black wings, charging towards the twelve Men in Black.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The black-robed half-Saint swung his sword horizontally. The sword radiance was a thousand meters long. It hit Lu Ming and sent him flying.</p><p>today, none of you can leave. This place will be your burial ground!</p><p>The black-robed half-Saint said coldly. He took a step forward and became one with his holy weapon and sword. He turned into a bright sword light and stabbed at Lu Ming’s forehead.</p><p>It was too fast. It was so fast that Lu Ming could not react in time.</p><p>Moreover, a terrifying force was locked onto Lu Ming, causing his muscles to tremble slightly.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>In an instant, the sword light approached. The terrifying sharpness pierced Lu Ming’s glabella, causing it to hurt.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this critical moment, Lu Ming shouted loudly. He stretched his right hand forward and grabbed the blade of the black-robed half-saint’s holy weapon.</p><p>Zzzzzzz …</p><p>The Holy weapon and the Liuyuan glove rubbed against each other, making an ear-piercing sound and sparks.</p><p>Although the Holy weapon sword had been caught by Lu Ming, it was still slowly moving forward.</p><p>“With your cultivation, don’t even think about catching my sword. Kill!”</p><p>The black-robed half-Saint bellowed. His vital essence exploded and the power of his holy weapon sword became stronger, pushing Lu Ming back.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>After retreating for a while, Lu Ming crashed into a mountain peak. The entire mountain peak shook violently and almost exploded.</p><p>Zzzzzzz …</p><p>The sound of friction between the combat sword and the glove grew louder. The combat sword was slowly approaching Lu Ming’s glabella.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s left hand was covered in dragon scales. It transformed into a Dragon Claw and grabbed the blade, stopping it from moving forward.</p><p>If the sword pierced through his glabella, the terrifying destructive power would explode and Lu Ming would die.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s left hand did not have the Liuyuan glove. The blade of his holy weapon sword was extremely sharp. It cut through the chaos Domain and quintessential essence that covered his palm, cutting through the Dragon scales on his hand. Blood flowed from Lu Ming’s hand, and his entire palm was almost cut off.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming did not care about the pain and tried his best to stop it.</p><p>“You can’t stop it!”</p><p>The black-robed half-Saint kept urging his power, and the power of the sword became stronger and stronger.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>On the other side, the 12 Men in Black had sealed the void, and the area of compression was getting smaller and smaller. There was no way for bubbles to escape, and she was about to be captured.</p><p>“Power, I need power, great power!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was roaring in his heart.</p><p>He was too weak.</p><p>In the vast Yuan continent, his power was too weak. Martial emperors were like ants.</p><p>He urgently needed powerful strength.</p><p>He didn’t care about the consequences and madly borrowed the power of the third bloodline.</p><p>you want power? I’ll give it to you!</p><p>At this moment, a vast, deep, and ethereal voice came from the third bloodline.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>When the voice rang out, Lu Ming felt an explosion in his head. Then, his mind seemed to have entered his third Blood Meridian.</p><p>What was reflected in his eyes was an incomparably huge and boundless blood-colored ocean.</p><p>The sea seemed to be filled with endless blood. But at this moment, the waves were rolling. A face appeared in the endless sea. It was extremely huge and boundless.</p><p>He looked at Lu Ming with a pair of cold eyes.</p><p>“Power, here you go!”</p><p>The giant face opened its mouth and said.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, endless killing intent completely drowned Lu Ming. At this moment, Lu Ming seemed to have sunk into endless darkness, and only endless power surged into his body.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s hair was growing rapidly. It was at least two meters long and was dancing in the wind.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body wriggled rapidly, and in the end, hideous bone spikes grew out.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes had turned completely blood-red and he had lost all rationality.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming let out a roar, like a wild beast.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a loud roar, and a terrifying power suddenly erupted.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The power went directly into the Holy weapon combat sword. The power went through the combat sword and into the black-robed half-saint’s arm.</p><p>The black-robed half-saint’s body trembled violently. His arm actually exploded. He spat out blood and retreated with disbelief.</p><p>“You … What kind of monster are you?”</p><p>The black-robed half-Saint shouted in shock.</p><p>He had never expected that Lu Ming’s form would suddenly change drastically, turning into the legendary devil from hell.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
