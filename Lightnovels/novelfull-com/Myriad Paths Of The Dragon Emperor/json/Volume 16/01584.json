He couldn’t resist at all. With a scream, his body was cracked and he died on the spot.</p><p>Wizard King spirit-devouring turned into a cloud of black smoke and absorbed all the blood.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The other Saints were all shocked.</p><p>Shakyamuni’s strength was already shocking enough. Now, he had absorbed the blood of another Saint. His strength must be even more terrifying.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The dozen Saints didn’t dare to continue fighting. They turned around and ran.</p><p>They came from different sects and weren’t of one mind. At this moment of life and death, they all wanted to escape and let the others block them.</p><p>“Hehehe, if you want to escape, you’ll all die!”</p><p>Master Spirit-devouring sneered and chased after the Saints with a few evil spirit Saints.</p><p>the Saint has been defeated. Run!</p><p>There were still some people watching from below. They had thought that with more than a dozen Saints working together, they would most likely be able to suppress the other party. They didn’t expect to see this scene, and they were immediately scared out of their wits and began to run wildly.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming, Tian Chui, and Xue ningxin were almost out of the Windy Plains.</p><p>They did not stop. Shakyamuni spirit Devourer was an Emperor-level powerhouse. Although there were more than a dozen Saints, Lu Ming still felt that a dozen Saints might not be of much use!</p><p>not good! The Saints have been defeated!</p><p>Tian Chui growled.</p><p>Saint might filled the air. The Saints scattered and fled in all directions.</p><p>let’s go. Shakyamuni’s target is the Saints. Our cultivation is too weak. He won’t target us now!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The three of them continued to fly at high speed, and in the blink of an eye, they were out of the heavenly wind Plains.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, a terrifying sharp light pierced through the sky and wind Plains from the distant sky.</p><p>It was a long spear, the spear of God’s punishment!</p><p>Another expert from the heavenly Divine sect had arrived.</p><p>This spear of divine punishment was extremely terrifying. It streaked across the void as if it was going to pierce through it.</p><p>“Absolute Saint!”</p><p>Shakyamuni devoured his voice and struck out with his palm, clashing with the spear of divine punishment.</p><p>An earth-shattering boom rang out, and Shakyamuni shivered and retreated dozens of miles.</p><p>In the distant void, a figure stepped on the air and arrived.</p><p>It was a middle-aged man with a slender figure. It was obvious that he had been very handsome when he was young. His expression was very calm, but he exuded a supreme majesty.</p><p>“Sect master, it’s the sect master!”</p><p>Some of the disciples of the heavenly God sect shouted when they saw this middle-aged man.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two were also shocked.</p><p>The sect master of the heavenly God sect had actually come in person.</p><p>I didn’t expect an evil Spirit’s Guardian King to be sealed here. But he looks very weak!</p><p>A cold voice rang out. The one who spoke was not the sect master of the heaven God sect, but from the other side.</p><p>A green-robed old man suddenly appeared. He was the one who had spoken.</p><p>“Sect master!”</p><p>The desire poison sect disciples cried out in shock.</p><p>The desire poison sect’s sect master had also arrived.</p><p>hehehe, two absolute Saints came. As long as I kill you, I should be able to recover 20% of my cultivation!</p><p>Shakyamuni Devourer laughed.</p><p>Shakyamuni spirit-devouring, ” ye mo said. you still want to kill us in your current state? what a joke. Just leave. Leave the Azure continent and I won’t hold you accountable for what happened today!</p><p>The heavenly God sect’s sect master calmly spoke.</p><p>a mere absolute Saint. What an arrogant tone. What if I don’t retreat? ”</p><p>Shakyamuni Devourer said coldly.</p><p>“If you don’t retreat, I’ll have to make you stay and completely destroy you!”</p><p>The sect master of the heavenly God sect spoke. After which, he turned to the sect master of the desire poison sect,”Brother Wu, how about we work together?”</p><p>“I was thinking the same thing!”</p><p>The sect master of the desire poison sect said.</p><p>“Hehehe, then let me see what you juniors can do. Kill!”</p><p>Shakyamuni spirit-devouring charged at the sect master of the heavenly God sect.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At the same time, the sect Masters of the tianshen sect and the Yudu sect both released terrifying auras and charged at Shakyamuni.</p><p>Instantly, the entire area was covered in white holy light, green poisonous gas, and black smoke. Terrifying rumbles were heard continuously.</p><p>Shakyamuni has been blocked. Let’s go!</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate at all. He took out the space-breaking flying shuttle. The three of them stepped into the space-breaking flying shuttle and flew away. In the blink of an eye, they disappeared from the place.</p><p>The speed of the space-breaking flying shuttle was very fast, but it still took a few minutes for the terrible shaking in the heavenly wind plain to completely disappear.</p><p>damn, he actually got himself a great emperor. That was close!</p><p>Tian Chui said with lingering fear in his heart.</p><p>Emperor-ranked characters were truly too terrifying.</p><p>For so many years, the Azure continent had only produced one emperor Cang. After Emperor Cang, there was no other Emperor!</p><p>I wonder if the sect Masters of the deity sect and the Yu Du sect can stop Shakyamuni? ”</p><p>Xue ningxin said.</p><p>the evil spirit cult was destroyed 80000 years ago, and discipline King Devourer was probably sealed by another great emperor 80000 years ago. He’s been extremely weak for so many years, but he’s still a great emperor. It’s hard to say if he has two absolute Saints!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>However, all of this had nothing to do with them. With their strength, there was no point in worrying. They could not interfere at all.</p><p>Ordinary saints couldn’t even interfere with that kind of expert. They would be killed if they tried.</p><p>“I wonder how little Qing is doing. I didn’t see her before.”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little worried. He took out his voice transmission jade talisman and was about to send a voice transmission to Xie nianqing. However, as soon as he took out his jade talisman, he received a voice transmission from Xie nianqing, asking him how he was. He was filled with worry.</p><p>Since Xie nianqing had sent him a voice transmission, it meant that Xie nianqing was fine. Lu Ming heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>Lu Ming then replied to Xie nianqing’s message.</p><p>Through the voice transmission jade talisman, Lu Ming knew that Xie nianqing was now outside the Tianfeng Plains. A Saint from the Tianyu demonic sect had come and she was with him.</p><p>Lu Ming adjusted his direction and the space-breaking shuttle flew rapidly toward Xie nianqing. Soon, he saw Xie nianqing.</p><p>The two of them chatted for a while before bidding each other farewell. Lu Ming, Tian Chui, and the other two stepped onto the space-breaking flying shuttle again and headed for Dragon God Valley.</p><p>The heavenly wind plain was in the West of the Cang region, while the Dragon God Valley was in the southeast of the Cang region. The distance was very far, and it would take a long time even with the help of the space-breaking shuttle.</p><p>Seven days later, they landed in a large city and asked for information.</p><p>As expected, the matter of the heavenly wind Plains had already spread throughout the Cang region.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two asked around and heard a lot of news.</p><p>In the sky wind Plains, the spirit-devouring Shakyamuni of evil spirit reappeared in the world and killed several Saints. Finally, he fought with the two sect Masters of the deity sect and the Yu Du sect.</p><p>That battle was earth-shattering.</p><p>In the end, discipline King Shiling was too weak to fight against the two absolute Saints. He was severely injured and escaped with a few of his Saint minions. The rest of the evil spirit people were killed by the other Saints.</p><p>Even so, the people of the various sects in the Azure continent were still in a state of panic.</p><p>There were rumors that evil spirit was about to rise again, and the world was about to be plunged into misery and suffering.</p><p>Now, a Guardian King had broken out of the seal. Once he recovered in the future, how could they stop him when there was no Emperor in the Azure continent?</p><p>Many people could only hope that there would be Emperor-ranked figures outside of the Azure continent who would take action to deal with evil spirit.</p><p>After Lu Ming and the other two gathered some information, they continued to board the space-breaking flying shuttle and headed for Dragon God Valley.</p><p>When he returned to the southeast of the Cang region, Lu Ming readjusted the flying shuttle and headed for the Lu clan’s Castle.</p><p>Lu Ming planned to make a trip to the Lu clan Fort first to settle Feng Ling and the other Feng villagers there. He would also bring Xiangxiang Beila back to Dragon God Valley.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
