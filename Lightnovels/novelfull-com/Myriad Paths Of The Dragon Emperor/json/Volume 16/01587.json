It was stronger than any sect in the Azure continent, or even stronger than all the sects in the Azure continent combined.</p><p>Having a great emperor in charge and not having one were two completely different things.</p><p>However, some of the books that Lu Ming had read before only introduced the Azure region. There was very little information about the regions outside the Azure region.</p><p>the yuan continent is vast and boundless. Every Emperor-level expert can occupy a territory and establish a force. That territory is a state and is called by the name of the Emperor!</p><p>the great emperor of the Cloud King Mountain is called Emperor Yun. Therefore, the region where Emperor Yun is located is called the cloud continent. Our Azure continent originated from Emperor Cang. If there is a new great emperor in the Azure continent in the future, the name might change!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master explained.</p><p>“A great emperor can build a Prefecture!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but look forward to it.</p><p>The Azure continent was so vast, yet it was only a territory that Emperor Cang occupied.</p><p>“Master, how many large provinces are there in the yuan continent?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>The valley master shook his head. the yuan continent is too big. There are countless provinces. I don’t know either!</p><p>“Countless big provinces?”</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p><p>One continent represented one emperor. Were there that many emperors in the yuan continent?</p><p>“Ming ‘er, master has a map of the regions near the Azure region. Take a good look at it on the way!”</p><p>The valley master of Cloud Dragon Valley took out a jade talisman and handed it to Lu Ming. Then, with a wave of his hand, he rose into the air with Lu Ming and appeared outside Dragon God Valley. With a wave of his hand, an air-breaking flying shuttle appeared in the sky.</p><p>The flying shuttle was purple-gold in color and had a smooth curve. There were strange patterns carved on it, which looked very beautiful.</p><p>One look and one could tell that it was much more advanced than the space-breaking flying shuttle that Lu Ming had.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, come up!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master stepped into the space-breaking flying shuttle, followed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master controlled the space-breaking flying shuttle. It turned into a beam of light and disappeared.</p><p>“What a fast speed!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked outside through the crystal glass. The mountains and rivers below passed by in the blink of an eye. The speed was unbelievable. It was at least ten times faster than his space-breaking flying shuttle.</p><p>This was definitely a top-grade flying shuttle.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at it for a while before he sat down cross-legged and took out the Jade talisman given to him by the cloud Dragon Valley master.</p><p>With a sweep of his spiritual senses, a map was reflected in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>This map was divided into different regions, and each region was a large province. There were dozens of large provinces recorded in it, all of which were large provinces near the Azure province.</p><p>The grey region was located in the southeast of the map and was close to the boundless sea. The cloud Emperor mountain was located in the cloud region and was in the Northwest of the grey region.</p><p>“That is … The DI family of the DI state!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>To the North of the Azure region was another large region, called the Emperor region. It was marked that the Emperor region was under the control of the DI family.</p><p>could it be Di Yi? di Xian’s family, the DI family, actually has a great emperor in charge!</p><p>Lu Ming frowned slightly.</p><p>I once injured di Xian in the divine wilderness continent. I’m afraid that this person will not let this matter rest so easily. In the future, I have to find an opportunity to get rid of this person to prevent any future trouble!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming imprinted the map in his heart and cultivated quietly.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master’s flying shuttle was simply too fast. In just two days, it had crossed the entire Azure region and entered the cloud region, arriving before a vast mountain.</p><p>Here, the two of them got off the space-breaking flying shuttle.</p><p>“What a majestic mountain!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but sigh as he looked at the mountain in front of him.</p><p>The grey Mountain was already majestic enough, but compared to the one in front of him, there was still a huge gap.</p><p>Was this the cloud Emperor mountain?</p><p>Looking at the mountain from afar, Lu Ming felt a supreme majesty emanating from the cloud Emperor mountain. This Majesty seemed to be standing at the peak of all living beings, and everyone had to bow down to it.</p><p>This was the majesty of a great emperor!</p><p>A great emperor was hiding in this mountain!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master took out a voice transmission jade talisman and sent out a message.</p><p>Not long after, a white-robed old man stepped out of the cloud Emperor mountain.</p><p>“Brother Yun, why are you so free today to come to my cloud Emperor mountain?”</p><p>The white-robed old man smiled.</p><p>“It’s nothing big. I just wanted to send my disciple to the hundred clan battlefield, so I came to visit your old friend!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said.</p><p>“Haha, it’s just a fake that you’ve come to see me. It’s true that you’re sending your disciple into the hundred clan battlefield!”</p><p>The white-robed elder laughed and looked at Lu Ming. Brother Yun, your disciple’s cultivation is only at the peak of the sixth level martial Royal realm. Isn’t it a little too low to enter the hundred clan battlefield? danger lurks at every step in the hundred clan battlefield!</p><p>“It’s fine. Only danger has the effect of tempering!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said.</p><p>“That’s good. Come with me. The cloud Emperor mountain will be arranging a group of Young heaven’s pride experts to enter the hundred tribe battlefield to train. You can go with them so that you can look out for each other!”</p><p>The white-robed elder said. Then, he brought Lu Ming and the cloud Dragon Valley master into the cloud Emperor mountain and arranged a courtyard for them to stay in.</p><p>“Brother Yun, you guys stay here for two days. I’ll bring this little fellow to the hundred clan battlefield in two days!”</p><p>The white-robed old man said his goodbyes and left.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, you must be very curious about what kind of place the hundred clan battlefield is, right?”</p><p>At that moment, the valley master looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He was indeed very curious.</p><p>it’s said that in the ancient times, a war of the hundred races took place in that area. That war was extremely tragic and the sky collapsed. Legend has it that many Emperor-level experts died. That was the hundred races battlefield!</p><p>in the hundred clan battlefield, too many experts have died, especially the Emperor-level experts. As a result, the laws of heaven and earth in that area have become chaotic and chaotic. The experts of the sage realm can’t enter because of their domain laws. Once they enter, they will be affected by the chaotic laws, causing their laws to become chaotic. Once, there were experts of the sage realm who entered. In the worst case, they died from the chaos of the laws, and in the worst case, their cultivation was completely crippled!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master explained.</p><p>“It’s that terrifying?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>that’s right. That’s why experts above the Saint realm don’t dare to enter the hundred clan battlefield. Only those below the Saint realm can enter. Some half-Saints have comprehended nomological laws but are not strong enough to enter!</p><p>“In addition, there are too many experts who participated in the hundred clan battlefield, and too many experts have died. There are countless treasures buried there, and it’s simply a huge treasure trove. Many Emperor-ranked powers will send their experts there, and as time passed, it became a place for geniuses to train. Now, it’s become the first choice for geniuses of the various Emperor-ranked powers to train!”</p><p>“One by one, the peerless geniuses of the Emperor-ranked powers will enter, tempering themselves in the face of life and death, seeking a breakthrough. That’s why it’s said that there’s a place where opportunity and danger co-exist. Because many geniuses enter with the purpose of tempering themselves, there’s no need for a reason to make a move there. As long as someone thinks you’re worth tempering, they’ll make a move on you!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master explained everything in detail. Then, he looked at Lu Ming with bright eyes and said,”Ming ‘er, do you dare to go to such a place?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
