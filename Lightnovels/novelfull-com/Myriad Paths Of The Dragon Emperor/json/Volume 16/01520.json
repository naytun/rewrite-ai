Venomous insects flew out from their bodies and flew towards Lu Ming and the others. At the same time, their bodies flickered and they stepped in a mysterious position. Then, their bodies collapsed one after another and turned into green poisonous gas.</p><p>...</p><p>At that moment, the poisonous gas expanded rapidly and turned into a poisonous gas that filled the sky, enveloping Lu Ming and the other two.</p><p>Lu Ming and Tian Chui removed their black robes and joined Xue ningxin. The three of them stood together.</p><p>this is a poison formation. Be careful!</p><p>Xue ningxin said. Her huge body was covered with snow-white Dragon scales, full of beauty, like the most beautiful work of art in the world.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly, and the chaos Domain spread out.</p><p>“Lightning!”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming waved his hand and the chaos Domain turned into a Thunder domain. Lightning filled the sky. It was as if countless lightning snakes were slithering between the sky and the earth. The lightning snakes were as thick as an arm and spread in all directions.</p><p>The poisonous insects were struck by the lightning snakes and fell down in large groups.</p><p>“Fire!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to speak. The chaos Domain changed again, turning into flames that filled the sky and spread in all directions.</p><p>The flames and lightning surged towards the poisonous insects and the poisonous mist.</p><p>Chi Chi Chi …</p><p>Between heaven and earth, a sizzling sound rang out, and waves of light smoke floated up.</p><p>Whoosh! Black wings appeared on Lu Ming’s back. They grew larger and were a hundred meters long when spread. The black wings were covered with a wind domain and Lu Ming began to spin rapidly.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>The black wings brought with them an endless amount of wind that spread out in all directions. The power was shocking.</p><p>Thunder, fire, and wind surged between heaven and earth, resisting the poisonous gas from all directions. For a moment, they were in a stalemate.</p><p>“Senior brother, Senior Sister, get ready to attack!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Tian Chui and Xue ningxin.</p><p>Then-</p><p>Kill!</p><p>Kill! Kill! Kill!</p><p>Lu Ming bellowed a few times in succession. Invisible soul attacks were launched at the poisonous gas.</p><p>The members of the desire poison sect cultivated the poison body. Their bodies could be dispersed, but their souls were still attached to the poisonous gas and would still be attacked by Lu Ming.</p><p>Furthermore, since the spirit body was dispersed, its defense against the soul was even weaker.</p><p>Lu Ming cast the divine sword technique and roared a few times. A few shrieks were heard from the poisonous gas. The poisonous gas twisted violently and then converged, beginning to condense into a human shape.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming, Tian Chui, and Xue ningxin shouted as they each charged towards a disciple of the desire poison sect that had formed.</p><p>The Black Dragon Spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hands. He smashed the long spear down. All of a sudden, there were ten layers of attacks that exploded. The void trembled violently.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Yu Du sect disciple screamed as his body split into pieces.</p><p>This time, it did not turn into poisonous gas. Instead, it was truly torn apart. Lu Ming’s attack had exceeded his tolerance range and he was killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>On the other side, Tian Chui and Xue ningxin also unleashed their strongest attacks, killing one person each.</p><p>After killing three people, the poison formation had broken by itself!</p><p>The remaining poisonous gas began to roll and condense into three people, who retreated at an extreme speed.</p><p>One of them was the Supreme genius of the desire poison sect.</p><p>“Today, you’re the ones who will die!”</p><p>Tian Chui roared as he raised his hammer and charged towards the Yu Du sect’s men.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xue ningxin also stepped forward.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>The surrounding spectators were confused.</p><p>Earlier, the Yu Du sect’s experts had set up a poison array that enveloped the entire space, including Lu Ming and the other two. They thought that Lu Ming and the other two were dead for sure. However, they did not expect that in the next moment, lightning, fire, and wind would flash within the poison array. Following that, a few loud shouts could be heard and the poison array collapsed. A few people from the Yu Du sect were killed in succession, leaving the remaining few at a disadvantage and retreating continuously.</p><p>They didn’t understand how the desire poison sect had lost.</p><p>The remaining few from the desire poison sect had ugly expressions.</p><p>Lu Ming’s loud shouts earlier had already injured their souls. Now, they were no match for Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>At this moment, a loud roar reverberated through the world.</p><p>At least eight or nine demonic lights tore through the void and flew toward Lu Ming and the others. In the next moment, nine figures appeared behind Lu Ming and the others, ready to attack from the back and the back.</p><p>“Mo he!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression turned cold. The nine figures were all disciples of the Tian Yu demon sect, and one of them was mo he.</p><p>Mo he’s body was filled with killing intent. His eyes were sharp as he glanced at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Brother Wu, how about we join forces and kill these three?”</p><p>Mo he looked at the heaven’s chosen from the desire poison sect and said.</p><p>“Of course you can!”</p><p>The Paragon of the desire poison sect was overjoyed and quickly agreed. A ferocious look flashed in his eyes. It seemed that Lu Ming and the other two had offended quite a number of people.</p><p>“Mo he, you’re courting death!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>Because of Xie nianqing, he didn’t want to get into a bad relationship with the Tian Yu demon sect.</p><p>However, the Tian Yu demonic sect had gone too far. Back then, mo he had led people to hunt him down. If it wasn’t for his good luck, he would have died.</p><p>Every time he met mo he in the Cang mountains, the other party wanted to kill him. Lu Ming decided that if he met the Tian Yu demonic sect again, he would not show any mercy and would kill them.</p><p>“You want to kill me?”</p><p>Mo he sneered. The demonic Qi on his body soared to the sky. He unsheathed his demonic blade and became one with it, slashing at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Brat, let me fight you!”</p><p>Tian Chui shouted, raised his giant hammer, and smashed it towards mo he.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The demonic blade and the giant hammer collided with an earth-shaking sound. Mo he and Tian Chui were both shocked and forced to retreat.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>Tian Chui’s eyes revealed a murderous intent. Like a wild dragon, the muscles on his entire body bulged and a Dragon’s Roar was emitted. He raised his giant hammer and smashed it towards mo he.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Mo he coldly shouted. His demonic blade burst forth, becoming even more terrifying as it rushed towards Tian Chui.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In an instant, the two of them exchanged more than a dozen moves, and neither of them had a clear winner.</p><p>“Do it!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming and Xue ningxin also made their moves.</p><p>Lu Ming’s Black wings flapped and he charged toward the people from the Tian Yu demon sect. He thrust his Black Dragon Spear forward, which turned into a dazzling ray of light.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>A peak Lv 5 martial Royal realm young man from the sky demon sect was killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Then, the long spear swept across and a Lv 6 martial Royal realm expert exploded.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar rang out. Xue ningxin cooperated with Lu Ming and pounced on the people from the Tian Yu demon sect. One of them was killed with a single claw.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>There was also an expert from the Tian Yu demonic sect. He was a youth at the peak of the LV 7 martial Royal realm, and he was fighting against Xue ningxin with shocking combat strength.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was unrivaled. After killing a few people in a row, the remaining people from the sky demon sect were horrified. They retreated one after another, not daring to fight Lu Ming head-on.</p><p>what a strong combat strength! That man from Dragon God Valley is so strong! He can even fight to a draw with mo he!</p><p>“That’s terrifying. Mo he is a top genius of the Tian Yu demon sect. Even in the entire Azure continent, he is a top genius. He was actually able to fight with mo he to such an extent?”</p><p>it seems to be the madman from Dragon God Valley, Tian Chui!</p><p>In the surroundings, some people were discussing and some recognized Tian Chui.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
