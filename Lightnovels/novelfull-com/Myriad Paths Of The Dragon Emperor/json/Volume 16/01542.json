He was only at the LV 4 martial Royal realm and had killed several top powerhouses with superior earth spiritual bodies. He had forced the deity sect and the Yu Du sect to challenge the other sects on purpose and lose the battle on purpose, causing them to be eliminated early.</p><p>And Luo Xiang wasn’t weak either.</p><p>Some people who knew Luo Xiang knew that he was a terrifying figure. He had stayed at the peak of the Supreme-being realm for 15 years in order to nurture his sword soul.</p><p>Now, as a fifth level martial Royal realm, he had killed a sixth level martial Royal realm genius. His combat strength was unfathomable.</p><p>Moreover, the life-death Sword Art was extremely terrifying. What kind of sparks would be created when Luo Xiang challenged Lu Ming?</p><p>Lu Ming stood up and took a step forward. He descended from the fighting ring and stood opposite Luo Xiang.</p><p>“Lu Ming, how about we decide the winner with one move?”</p><p>Luo Xiang said.</p><p>“Sure!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>To be honest, he had a good impression of Luo Xiang.</p><p>This was a true sword cultivator, sharp, decisive, but upright. He had his own bottom line.</p><p>Previously, when the tianshen sect, the Tianyu demonic sect, and the Yudu sect were hunting Dragon God Valley, Luo Xiang couldn’t stand it anymore and killed the experts of the tianshen sect.</p><p>This was a man who was born for the sword.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you have to be careful. My life-death Sword Art can determine life and death with one strike. It has the meaning of ‘I live, you die’. If you can withstand one strike of mine, you win!”</p><p>Luo Xiang reminded.</p><p>“Go all out. If I die under your sword, I can only blame my lack of skill!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. His eyes were filled with a strong desire to fight.</p><p>He also wanted to see the famous life-and-death Sword Art in Cangzhou.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As he unsheathed his sword, a terrifying sharp light shot up into the sky from Luo Xiang’s body.</p><p>At this moment, Luo Xiang seemed to have turned into a peerless divine sword.</p><p>He was no longer a human but a sword. However, it also seemed as if the sword in his hand was no longer a sword but a human.</p><p>At this moment, Luo Xiang’s sword seemed to have come alive and had a soul.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed slightly. He could feel a strong pressure from Luo Xiang.</p><p>It was extremely rare for a fifth level martial monarch to give him such a strong pressure.</p><p>Lu Ming’s vital essence began to circulate rapidly. The Emperor spiritual weapon spear appeared in his hand and the chaos Domain spread out.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming’s muscles, bones, and bones were wriggling slightly, ready to launch a terrifying attack at any time.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, Luo Xiang moved.</p><p>A ray of sword light cut through the void and stabbed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Under this sword light, the void seemed to be pierced. Everything in the world seemed to lose its color. It was as if this sword light was the only thing left in the world.</p><p>It was terrifying, sharp, and accurate!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming felt as if there was a terrifying sword aura pressing down on his body, making it difficult for him to move. In the face of this sword, it was as if he could only be killed.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, a shocking Dragon’s Roar came from Lu Ming’s body. The Dragon’s Roar was mighty and it was as if a real Dragon had soared to the nine Heavens.</p><p>His essential core boiled and Lu Ming broke through the terrifying sword force in one move. He became one with the spear and stabbed out.</p><p>The spear was used with the [ power-storing thirteen strikes ], and the body of the spear was covered with the chaos Domain.</p><p>A sword-light and a spear-light seemed to be the only things in the world at this moment.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The spear radiance and the sword radiance were like two meteors in the deep sky, colliding with each other.</p><p>A dazzling light spread out from the point of impact. It was like a sun that had suddenly exploded, and the world was covered in white.</p><p>Many people felt a piercing pain in their eyes. Those with weaker cultivation could not help but close their eyes.</p><p>how terrifying! Who won? ”</p><p>Some of the stronger cultivators poured their vital essence into their eyes and stared ahead.</p><p>The dazzling light flashed and disappeared. When the light disappeared, everyone saw a figure flying backward. When he landed on the fighting ring, he retreated more than ten steps before he stopped.</p><p>Luo Xiang, the one who retreated was Luo Xiang!</p><p>At this moment, Luo Xiang’s face was extremely pale, and the hand that was holding the sword was trembling.</p><p>Lu Ming stood still, and dense dragon scales appeared on his body.</p><p>“What a terrifying sword!”</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a long sigh of relief. There was a hint of shock in his eyes.</p><p>The moment they clashed, the chaos realm that Lu Ming covered the long spear was pierced through by Luo Xiang’s sword gleam. The terrifying sword Qi followed the long spear and broke into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Dragon scales appeared on his body to block the attack. Even so, his skin still felt like it was being torn apart. From this, one could see how terrifying Luo Xiang’s sword attack was.</p><p>Life-death Sword Art-one sword strike could determine life and death!</p><p>Every sword was a sword that could kill.</p><p>Luo Xiang was much stronger than when he was in the Emperor Cang’s Secret realm.</p><p>This kind of strength did not refer to the increase in cultivation, but the ability to fight at the same level.</p><p>At that time, Lu Ming’s spirit body was only a low-grade Earth Spirit body, but he was able to defeat Luo Xiang.</p><p>At that time, Luo Xiang was on the same level as Wang Jian and Shi Tian. But now, Luo Xiang could easily kill Wang Jian, Shi Tian, who was at the same level as him, with one sword.</p><p>spiritual body, he’s still a medium-grade earth spiritual body, but he can make such a sword attack. It’s incredible!</p><p>Lu Ming thought in his heart.</p><p>“I’ve lost!”</p><p>Luo Xiang kept his sword and cupped his fists at Lu Ming.</p><p>The sword attack just now could be said to be Luo Xiang’s most powerful attack. If he could not defeat Lu Ming with one attack, he would lose.</p><p>With that, Luo Xiang turned around and jumped off the fighting ring. Lu Ming did not pursue him.</p><p>He and Luo Xiang were originally more of sparring.</p><p>After Luo Xiang descended from the fighting ring, Lu Ming turned around and returned to the platform.</p><p>The challenge continued!</p><p>The following battles calmed down again, but undercurrents were surging. Because, more than 30 rounds had already passed, and there were very few people on the various platforms. The battles were about to end.</p><p>The rest were all powerhouses.</p><p>After a few more rounds, there were less than ten people left on the thirteen platforms.</p><p>However, the rest of them were all top experts. Most of them were heaven’s favorites at the level of Bai mo, han Xun, and Mo he.</p><p>At this moment, the people of the tianshen sect and the Tianyu demonic sect had all been eliminated. A new round had begun, and it was the heaven seat King’s turn to challenge them.</p><p>The heaven seat King was extremely powerful, not any weaker than the Tianyu demonic sect or the Yu Du sect. Right now, there were only two people left in the heaven seat King, and both of them were top experts.</p><p>There was only one person left from the evil moon sect. The leader of the evil moon sect was also a top expert.</p><p>The jiuxiao sword sect also had one person left, who was also a top-tier expert.</p><p>The Linglong Palace also had one person, a top-notch expert.</p><p>There was also the life and death Sword sect and the good Demon Castle. Each of them had one person, and they were all top-notch experts.</p><p>Including Lu Ming, there were eight people in total.</p><p>There were only eight people left. On the surface, the heaven seat King was the strongest with two people left.</p><p>However, at this moment, all the major platforms fell silent.</p><p>The two powerhouses from the heaven seat King swept their gazes across the rest of the people, but the one they looked at the most was Lu Ming.</p><p>As for the powerhouses from the other sects, most of them were looking at Lu Ming with grave expressions.</p><p>The treasure auction had reached the final moment, and the first place would be decided very soon. However, the first place would be rewarded with seven Emperor Jade pills, which everyone wanted.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
