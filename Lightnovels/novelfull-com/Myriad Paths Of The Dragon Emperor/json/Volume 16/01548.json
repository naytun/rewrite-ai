They were not so despicable as to look for Lu Ming to share the reward.</p><p>...</p><p>“You … You guys …”</p><p>He Yu was so angry that he almost vomited blood when he saw everyone’s disdainful eyes. He then looked at the Saint realm elder and said, ” “Elder, you have to uphold justice!”</p><p>“Shut up and get lost. Don’t embarrass yourself here!”</p><p>shut up! the Saint realm elder coldly rebuked and looked at he Yu in disgust, causing he Yu’s face to turn pale as he stood there, tongue-tied.</p><p>“You guys want to be slapped too?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze shifted to the few people from the silver Blizzard city.</p><p>The faces of the Silver City’s people changed. They didn’t dare to say a word and quickly left the fighting stage.</p><p>“Good, this small meeting has ended perfectly. Disciples of the seventh rank and above, go back and do your best to prepare for the treasure sealing assembly!”</p><p>The Saint realm elder of Dragon God Valley said, then turned around and left.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a terrifying wave came from the sky. A beam of holy light descended from the sky and attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>This holy light was too terrifying. It was like a divine sword, and its speed was unbelievably fast.</p><p>“Danger, danger!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming felt a fatal danger. All the muscles in his body tensed up and his hair stood on end.</p><p>His instinct told him to retreat and Dodge, but his body seemed to be fixed in place, unable to move an inch.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>The Saint realm elder of Dragon God Valley roared, but it was too late to save him.</p><p>The terrifying holy light was about to land on Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>At this moment, the space around Lu Ming rippled like water.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The sword light pierced through Lu Ming’s head. However, Lu Ming’s figure shattered like glass.</p><p>It was an afterimage!</p><p>Then, the space rippled and Lu Ming’s figure reappeared several meters away.</p><p>On Lu Ming’s shoulder, the bubble was glowing and chirping.</p><p>It seemed that Lu Ming really thought that he was going to die. It was an attack that he could not resist. Fortunately, the bubble took action in time.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the sky, the pressure became even stronger.</p><p>Lu Ming looked up and his pupils shrank.</p><p>A white figure was stepping down from the sky.</p><p>The Son of God!</p><p>He was known as the divine Son of the top ten monsters.</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>The divine Son had appeared and even attacked Lu Ming. Could it be that Lu Ming had killed so many people from the deity sect and ruined their plan to win the first place? was the divine Son so angry that he wanted to kill Lu Ming?</p><p>A terrifying pressure emanated from the divine son’s body, pressing down on Lu Ming, Tian Chui, and Xue ningxin, making them feel as if a mountain was pressing down on them.</p><p>space-time domain. It seems like you were the one who secretly sabotaged the Dragon Palace!</p><p>The divine Son said indifferently. He looked down at Lu Ming coldly, then at bubbles with a hint of surprise in his eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming did not say anything.</p><p>He understood what the Son of God was saying.</p><p>The divine Son was talking about how he had secretly destroyed his God prohibited void ancient talisman in the Dragon Palace.</p><p>The attack just now was just a test. The fact that Paopao had used the space-time domain proved that the person who had made the move was Lu Ming.</p><p>Of course, if it had not been for Lu Ming, the attack just now would have killed him. Why would the divine Son care if he had killed the wrong person?</p><p>Then, the Son of God’s gaze swept across Tian Chui and Xue ningxin, and he said coldly, ” “So, you are the ones who took the Dragon Palace’s Treasury?”</p><p>“That’s right, it’s US!”</p><p>“All treasures are based on fate and wisdom. Those who are fated will get them!” Lu Ming said.</p><p>what a joke. What fortune and wisdom? in front of absolute strength, everything is useless!</p><p>I’ll go with you, ” the Son of God said indifferently. He stood in the air, and milky-white holy light emanated from his body. He was like a god, and his tone was filled with dominance and confidence in his own strength.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered, revealing a hint of mockery.”How did that treasure end up in our hands?”</p><p>“After I kill you all today, the treasure will still be mine!”</p><p>The Son of God’s eyes were filled with killing intent.</p><p>The divine Son had obtained first place in two consecutive treasure conventions. He was the head of the ten great demon-level geniuses of the Azure region. No matter what he did, everything went smoothly. No one could compete with him for any treasure he encountered.</p><p>But last time, he had suffered losses in the Dragon Palace.</p><p>After using the forbidden ancient void talisman, Lu Ming had secretly destroyed it. Later on, they went to chase after the black true dragon corpse, but in the end, the black true dragon corpse still escaped. The Dragon Palace’s treasure vault had fallen into the hands of Lu Ming and the other two.</p><p>He seemed to have suffered a great loss in front of Lu Ming and the other two.</p><p>Therefore, he had to kill Lu Ming and the other two, especially Lu Ming.</p><p>Everyone around them had different expressions on their faces. However, they all understood that there must have been a conflict between Lu Ming and the divine Son because of an opportunity. From the looks of it, the divine Son had suffered a loss. No wonder he was so murderous.</p><p>haha, Lu Ming actually offended the divine Son. He deserves it. He deserves it!</p><p>Not far away, he Yu and a few people from the silver Blizzard city were roaring in their hearts. They were gloating over Lu Ming’s misfortune and wished that the divine Son would kill him immediately.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Son of God’s body glowed with holy light. Endless holy light condensed into a long blade that stood between heaven and earth. The vast power made many young men tremble.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The terrifying Saber Light slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>At that moment, black wings appeared on Lu Ming’s back and a shield appeared in front of him.</p><p>As for Tian Chui and Xue ningxin, both of them took out their Saint weapons.</p><p>How could they just sit and wait for death?</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>The saintess elder of the Dragon God Valley roared and stepped on the air like a real Dragon. She reached out her Dragon Claw and grabbed the blade light.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Heaven and earth rumbled as the Dragon Claw and the blade light dissipated.</p><p>“Old man, why are you interfering in the matters of the younger generation?”</p><p>From the pavilion of the tianshen sect, the sage realm elder rushed out and attacked the sage realm elder of the Dragon God Valley with his palm.</p><p>The two of them faced off against each other, and the sky trembled terrifyingly.</p><p>The two of them trembled and stood in two different directions. The vast pressure of the Saint realm spread out and the two of them were in a confrontation.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The Saint realm elder of Dragon God Valley shouted.</p><p>I’ve said it before. Why are you interfering in the matters of the younger generation? let them solve it themselves!</p><p>The sage realm elder of the heavenly God sect sneered.</p><p>that’s right. The treasure auction has already ended. Old people like us have no reason to get involved in the grudges of the young!</p><p>The Saint realm elder of the Tianyu demonic sect stepped out and said coldly.</p><p>Then, the Saint realm elder of the Yu Du sect appeared. The machine locked onto the Saint realm elder of Dragon God Valley to prevent him from interfering.</p><p>The Saint realm elder of Dragon God Valley looked terrible.</p><p>These people were determined to let Lu Ming die Here.</p><p>“Is the Tian Shen sect so sore about losing? Seeing that our Dragon God Valley has won first place, seeing that Lu Ming has won first place, you want to send people to kill Lu Ming. Don’t tell me that you are allowed to win, but no one else is allowed to win?”</p><p>On the grandstand, Qiu Ying Ying glared at the sky and shouted.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
