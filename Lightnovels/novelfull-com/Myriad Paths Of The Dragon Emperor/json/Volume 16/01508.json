They finally realized that the room had not been ransacked. The tables, chairs, and other rare refining materials were kept by the three of them.</p><p>Then, they continued to move forward. However, this time, after passing a few rooms, they found that they had all been ransacked. The room they had just been in was a fish that had escaped the net.</p><p>...</p><p>The three of them passed through a few rooms and came to a side hall. The three of them stopped there.</p><p>In front of him, a white-robed young man stood with his hands behind his back. He was currently examining a painting on the wall of the hall. On this painting, there were a few true dragons flying in the air. It was extremely life-like, as if a few true dragons were about to leap out of the painting.</p><p>“Divine Child!”</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>This young man was the monstrous genius of the heavenly God sect, the divine Son.</p><p>Upon hearing the commotion, the divine Son turned around and looked at Lu Ming and the other two with a cold gaze.</p><p>a disciple of the Dragon God Valley. No wonder you can make it here. Get lost!</p><p>scram! the Divine Child said coldly. The last word was like a god’s angry roar. Holy light burst forth, and a terrifying wind swept toward Lu Ming and the other two.</p><p>The three men’s expressions changed drastically. They released their true Yuan and domains to resist, but the wind was too violent. It kept bombarding their bodies, and the three of them felt as if they had been struck by lightning. Their bodies trembled and they were forced to retreat. They felt their qi and blood churning, and they almost spat out blood.</p><p>The divine Son cast a cold glance at the three of them again. With a wave of his hand, he kept the scroll, as if he could not be bothered to attack Lu Ming and the other two. With a flash of his body, he left through a passageway.</p><p>he’s just scolding me for having a higher cultivation base. He’s acting all high and mighty!</p><p>Tian Chui unhappily cursed.</p><p>Lu Ming did not make a sound.</p><p>The world of martial Dao was like this. With strength, one could do whatever they wanted. Without strength, there was no point in talking.</p><p>The three of them chose another direction to go.</p><p>Not long after, they passed by a large hall. On the wall of the hall, there were many fist-sized luminous pearls embedded.</p><p>Xue ningxin’s eyes lit up. She pulled out the night-luminescent pearls one by one and kept them excitedly.</p><p>Lu Ming and Tian Chui looked at each other.</p><p>The luminous pearl was a treasure to ordinary people, but to martial cultivators like them, it was no different from a useless stone.</p><p>“It’s said that true dragons like to collect treasures, especially shiny ones. It’s true!”</p><p>Tian Chui muttered.</p><p>“Hmph, what do you know?”</p><p>Xue ningxin glanced at Tian Chui, her eyes filled with disdain.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At this time, the three of them were startled because they heard a violent explosion in front of them.</p><p>“Is there. great battle, or …”</p><p>Tian Chui’s brows twitched.</p><p>“Let’s go take a look. Be careful!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The three of them concealed their auras and headed in the direction of the sound.</p><p>Not long after, the three of them walked out of a large door and came to a huge Hall.</p><p>The hall was extremely spacious and could probably hold hundreds of thousands of people. In the middle of the hall was a huge metal coffin.</p><p>The coffin was carved with a true dragon, and there were layers of inscriptions on it.</p><p>The Dragon coffin!</p><p>The three of them were shocked. This was clearly a Dragon coffin.</p><p>At this moment, a few experts were attacking the Dragon coffin. However, the inscriptions on the Dragon light appeared and formed a light screen that blocked the Dragon coffin.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The experts were all above the seventh level of the martial Royal realm. One of them was even at the ninth level of the martial Royal realm. A brilliant light burst out from his hands and bombarded the light curtain of the Dragon coffin. The light curtain trembled, but it could not be broken at the moment.</p><p>The arrival of Lu Ming’s group of three caused the few of them to turn around and look at them. When they saw that the strongest of the three was only at the fifth level of the Martial Emperor realm, a look of disdain flashed across their faces. However, they ignored them immediately.</p><p>“A Dragon coffin!”</p><p>At this moment, a voice was heard. An eighth level martial Royal realm expert had arrived and joined the others in attacking the Dragon coffin.</p><p>The loud explosions continuously attracted experts over. Slowly, more and more experts appeared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A young man stepped out from a direction, his body filled with sword Qi.</p><p>He was the genius of jiuxiao sword sect, Wang Jian.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In another direction, holy light filled the air as the Son of God stepped out.</p><p>The two demon-level geniuses of the Azure state had arrived at the same time.</p><p>“A Dragon coffin!”</p><p>The Son of God’s eyes were bright.</p><p>“Get lost, you bunch of trash!”</p><p>The Son of God shouted coldly. He took a step forward and appeared in front of the Dragon coffin. Holy light exploded from his body. Two masters were sent flying by the Son of God’s holy light.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>The two experts roared in their hearts, but they didn’t dare to say anything.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Son of God’s palm struck the light screen of the coffin. The light screen above the Dragon coffin trembled violently as if it would collapse at any moment, but it managed to hold on.</p><p>haha, Son of God, it seems like you can’t do it. Let me help you!</p><p>Wang Jian sneered. Sword light burst forth, and a terrifying sword light slashed at the light curtain. The light curtain also trembled violently, but it was not broken.</p><p>“Let’s attack together!”</p><p>The Son of God looked at the others coldly.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Then, the Son of God took a step forward. The brilliant holy light turned into a Divine Blade and slashed at the light screen above the Dragon coffin. At the same time, Wang Jian also slashed out.</p><p>The others gritted their teeth and made their moves.</p><p>With so many people attacking together, the power was incomparably terrifying. They all struck the light screen together, causing it to shake madly.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>A cracking sound came from the light curtain, and a crack appeared.</p><p>The light screen cracked open. Everyone was excited and continued to attack.</p><p>Finally, the light curtain exploded with a bang, and the inscriptions on the huge Dragon coffin dimmed and disappeared.</p><p>At this time, everyone’s eyes fell on the Dragon coffin.</p><p>What was inside the Dragon coffin? Could it be that a true dragon was really buried here?</p><p>“Open!”</p><p>The Son of God was bathed in holy light. A giant palm formed in the air and hit the Dragon coffin heavily.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The lid of the Dragon coffin was opened.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At this moment, everyone rose into the air and looked into the dragon coffin.</p><p>A Dragon!</p><p>A true dragon. A true dragon was lying in the Dragon coffin.</p><p>The true Dragon’s entire body was pitch-black, and its black scales revealed a crystalline luster. There were two dragon horns on its head, and five dragon claws on its abdomen.</p><p>It was a Black Dragon, and a mysterious aura emanated from its body.</p><p>The Saint realm. This true dragon had definitely reached the Saint realm when it was alive. A true dragon of the Saint realm was full of treasures.</p><p>Back then, Lu Ming had spent two million contribution points to exchange for 15 kilograms of sage realm dragon bones with complete spirituality. It was evident how precious they were.</p><p>This true Dragon’s corpse, even if it had lost some of its spirituality, was still priceless.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, someone moved and pounced towards the true Dragon’s corpse at extreme speed.</p><p>you’re looking for death. How dare you touch my true dragon? kill!</p><p>die! the Son of God shouted coldly. Holy light burst forth, turning into a Divine Blade that slashed down.</p><p>Two shrieks rang out as the two people who had pounced on the true dragon were cut in half by the divine Blade and died on the spot.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
