The tree was growing very well. It was now two meters tall, and the trunk was as thick as an arm. The branches and leaves were luxuriant, and wisps of heavenly aura lingered between the branches and leaves.</p><p>...</p><p>Cultivators sat cross-legged under the path-understanding ancient tree. Their hearts were calm, their minds were empty, and their thoughts were active. The speed of their comprehension could be increased by many times.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming took out a heavenly Dao stone. The heavenly Dao aura that the heavenly Dao stone emitted increased the speed at which Lu Ming comprehended the chaos Domain.</p><p>Lu Ming closed his eyes and started to comprehend quietly.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming traveled the world for a whole year and integrated with nature.</p><p>That year, although Lu Ming’s cultivation had progressed very slowly, his Chaos Domain had already reached the limit of level six. He could break through at any time.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming was more in tune with nature, so he could comprehend it faster.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, three days had passed. The chaos Domain on Lu Ming’s body suddenly trembled and became more robust and condensed.</p><p>His Chaos Domain had broken through and reached Level Seven.</p><p>A seventh level territory was already considered a territory that a high-level Martial Emperor could master.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not stop. His previous accumulation was too strong. It was like a flood that had been released after the floodgates were opened. The chaos realm was improving rapidly.</p><p>As for the heavenly Dao stones, Lu Ming took them out one after another.</p><p>After another two days, Lu Ming’s Chaos Domain had reached the peak of Level Seven.</p><p>With this breakthrough, the chaos Domain had been upgraded by an entire level. The speed was astonishing.</p><p>Of course, this was due to Lu Ming’s accumulation for the past year. Now that he had accumulated for a year, the speed of his progress was shocking.</p><p>Later on, after the outburst, the cultivation speed would return to normal.</p><p>After the breakthrough in the chaos Domain, it was time to break through in cultivation.</p><p>Lu Ming took out a large number of medium-grade raw gemstones and burst out with devouring power to devour and refine them.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another three days passed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation level increased rapidly until it reached the peak of the seventh level Martial Emperor realm, which was the same level as the chaos Domain.</p><p>At the seventh level of the Martial Emperor realm, Lu Ming had officially stepped into the ranks of the high-level Martial Emperor realm. His combat strength had increased greatly.</p><p>The improvement in Lu Ming’s cultivation level brought about an all-round improvement in his combat strength.</p><p>His true essence would skyrocket, his spirit body would be condensed and become stronger, and his soul power would also become stronger as his cultivation level increased.</p><p>Because it was too difficult to level up the chaotic domain, its power would increase with each level up. At the same time, the increase in cultivation would allow the Saint weapon to be more powerful.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming’s cultivation level had increased by one level and his combat strength had increased by a lot.</p><p>Now, if Lu Ming were to fight Yun Kai, a genius at the peak of the eighth level martial Royal realm, he was confident that he would be able to kill him in seconds.</p><p>“It’s time to go out and find experts to fight. Only then can I break through faster. If I keep going into seclusion, I’ll lose the point of coming to the hundred clan battlefield!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered. Then, he exited the mountain and river diagram and transformed the chaos realm into the earth realm. He rushed out of the mountains and flew toward the depths of the hundred clan battlefield.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming had not flown far when he saw a few figures cutting through the void and flying in one direction.</p><p>Someone cast an indifferent glance at Lu Ming from afar and ignored him.</p><p>they’re all experts. They’re all Lv 9 martial Royal realm experts!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and then continued to move forward.</p><p>However, Lu Ming encountered several groups of people in succession and they were all flying in the same direction.</p><p>“Isn’t it too much of a coincidence for so many people to go in the same direction? Or is there something in that direction that is attracting these people?”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming saw three more figures flying in that direction.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming immediately concealed his aura and landed on the ground below. He used the trees to cover the mountain and followed the group from a distance.</p><p>An hour later, they arrived at a vast mountain range.</p><p>The three figures suddenly stopped and nodded to each other. They descended and disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure soared into the sky and appeared in the sky above where the few people had been standing earlier. He looked down.</p><p>Below him was a large piece of rock, but there was a crack in the rock. It was very hidden, and if one didn’t look closely, they wouldn’t be able to see it clearly.</p><p>At this moment, those figures had already disappeared.</p><p>Could it be that those few people had entered this crack?</p><p>With a single thought, black wings appeared on Lu Ming’s back. Then, the chaos Domain covered his entire body and he descended toward the crack.</p><p>The crack kept going down and it was pitch black. However, as Lu Ming continued to descend, the crack grew bigger and wider.</p><p>there’s a world inside this crack? ”</p><p>Lu Ming stood high in the sky and looked down.</p><p>Below him was a boundless land. With the help of the dim light, he could barely see the mountains and rivers.</p><p>Lu Ming landed on a mountain peak casually and looked around.</p><p>What came into view were mountains, but there was no vegetation, only black rocks and soil.</p><p>“Could it be that those people he saw before are all here?”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>The hundred clan battlefield took place during the ancient times. Countless experts participated in the battle and countless experts died in battle, forming many strange places. Those strange places often contained great opportunities, but they were also accompanied by risks.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>All of a sudden, a strong gust of wind came from behind Lu Ming and attacked him.</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate. He dodged the attack and turned around to look.</p><p>“What is this? What a heavy demonic Qi!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p>The one who attacked him was a tall and burly monster with black bone spikes all over its body. It was in the form of an adult and held a battle axe in its hand. Its body was filled with thick demonic Qi.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The monster spoke in the human language. It roared and pounced at Lu Ming again.</p><p>Lv 6 Martial Emperor realm, die!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and the power of the prison-suppressing heavenly art was unleashed.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>This monster, which was equivalent to a sixth-level Martial Emperor, was directly hit by Lu Ming’s punch and its body exploded.</p><p>However, the monster was not made of flesh and blood. After its body exploded, it turned into a cloud of demonic Qi, rolling in the air and then condensing into the monster again. It roared and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>“If it’s completely condensed from demonic Qi, then I’ll obliterate your demonic Qi!”</p><p>Lu Ming immediately activated his Chaos Domain and blasted it out. The monster’s body was once again shattered and turned into billowing demonic Qi.</p><p>However, in the next moment, the demonic Qi condensed again and turned into a monster. Its aura was only slightly weakened.</p><p>what kind of monster is this? even the chaos realm can only obliterate it a little. It can’t be killed!</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a look of surprise.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming attacked a few times in a row. Each time, the monster would explode. However, every time, the monster would turn into demonic Qi and then condense again. It seemed to be completely immortal.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
