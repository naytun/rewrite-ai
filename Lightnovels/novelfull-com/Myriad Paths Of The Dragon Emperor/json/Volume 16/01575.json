He looked at Mo Yang and said, ” Mo Yang, you’re really despicable. You actually colluded with the heaven deity sect and the Yu Du sect to harm Lu Ming. You’re truly worthy of being one of the top ten monstrous talents of the Azure region!</p><p>His words were filled with mockery.</p><p>...</p><p>“Junior Sister, what did you say?”</p><p>Mo Yang’s expression changed slightly, and he revealed an ugly smile.</p><p>“Say what? Did he not dare to admit what he had done? How did the heaven God sect and the desire poison sect know where we are? To be able to set up an ambush here so accurately, if it wasn’t someone who leaked the information, what could it be?”</p><p>you intentionally looked for us and then came with us just to tip us off!</p><p>Xie nianqing said coldly.</p><p>She was extremely intelligent. Previously, she had thought that meeting Mo Yang was purely a coincidence. But now that she thought about it, she realized that everything had been arranged by Mo Yang.</p><p>“Junior Sister, don’t slander me!”</p><p>Mo Yang’s face was cold.</p><p>“Hmph, you know best whether you did it or not. I’m warning you, don’t follow me anymore, or I’ll kill you!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said coldly. Then, he moved and flew toward the tornado that Lu Ming and the others were in.</p><p>“B * tch, b * tch, sooner or later, I’ll make you beg for mercy in front of me!”</p><p>As he watched Xie nianqing leave, Mo Yang’s eyes were filled with ferocity and the fire of evil desire.</p><p>Xie nianqing came to the tornado that Lu Ming had entered and observed from afar.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>The tornado whistled and slowly moved towards the heavenly wind plain.</p><p>Xie nianqing followed the tornado and moved deeper into the cave.</p><p>Half a day later, Xie nianqing’s expression changed. In front of him, there were many tornadoes. This one was actually gathering with the other tornadoes. There were many tornadoes there, blocking Xie nianqing’s way.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you have the mountain and river diagram. The mountain and river diagram is an item that can only be refined by monarch-level experts. It should be able to withstand the power of the tornado, right?”</p><p>Xie nianqing murmured, but even so, her eyes were still full of worry.</p><p>She stood there for a long time and only left when Lu Ming’s tornado was completely out of sight.</p><p>……</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming and the rest were blown into the tornado, the terrifying wind whistled and spun, cutting at the poison ivy on the outside.</p><p>The poisonous vines were formed from the power of the laws and were extremely tough. However, in the midst of the violent wind, they were quickly cut apart and turned into ashes.</p><p>??…</p><p>The wind cut at the black wings, and sparks flew in all directions. It made an ear-piercing sound, and the black wings were constantly shaking.</p><p>“Damn it, we’ve been blown into a tornado!”</p><p>Tian Chui roared.</p><p>“What do we do? The tornado is too strong, we can’t get out of it!”</p><p>Xue ningxin frowned.</p><p>Thump thump thump …</p><p>After a while, the flapping of the black wings became more and more intense. The chaos Domain that Lu Ming had covered the black wings with could not withstand the cutting of the strong wind at all. In a short while, the chaos Domain was cut open.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled. A terrifying force passed through the black wings and surged into his body.</p><p>“Senior brother, Senior Sister, let’s enter the mountain and river diagram!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The mountain and river diagram was a treasure that could only be refined by Emperor-level experts. It should be able to withstand the cutting of the wind. As for how to get out, he could only think of a way later.</p><p>The wind here was too strong, so strong that even with bubbles ‘cultivation realm, she could not open a spacetime tunnel to rush out. This was because the moment the spacetime tunnel was opened, it would be destroyed by the wind.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s glabella glowed and he kept Tian Chui and Xue ningxin into the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Just as he was about to enter the mountain and river diagram, his expression suddenly changed.</p><p>Because at this time, he felt that the air-frozen bead in his sea of consciousness was shaking slightly.</p><p>the air-frozen bead is a treasure of the wind attribute. It might be able to restrain the wind!</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. With a single thought, the air-frozen bead flew out from between his eyebrows and hovered above his head.</p><p>The air-frozen bead vibrated slightly and a ray of green light shone down, shrouding Lu Ming. At this moment, the vibration on the black wings disappeared. Lu Ming felt that the strong wind had automatically detoured after meeting the energy emitted by the air-frozen bead.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. The air-frozen bead was indeed useful.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming kept his black wings and a green halo enveloped him. No matter how strong the wind was, it would avoid the green halo when it came into contact with it.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, a ray of green light flew from below the tornado. It was a green crystal the size of a fist.</p><p>“It’s the wind Crystal!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He recognized this type of crystal.</p><p>The wind Crystal stone was a type of crystal stone that could only be formed in places with an extremely high concentration of wind elements after a long period of time. It was a wind-attribute treasure and was extremely precious.</p><p>The wind Crystal flew directly to the air-frozen bead, entered it, and disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that the radiance on the air-frozen bead seemed to be more intense.</p><p>With a cry, a bird flew out from the air-frozen bead and circled around it, as if it was cheering.</p><p>The air-frozen bead was absorbing the energy of the wind Crystal.</p><p>Lu Ming looked in all directions. The strong wind blocked his vision and he could not see what was happening outside. However, Lu Ming had a feeling that the tornado was constantly moving.</p><p>After a long time, suddenly, another Wind Crystal flew up from below and integrated into the air-frozen bead. The light emitted by the air-frozen bead became brighter.</p><p>At the sight of this, Lu Ming was in no hurry to go out. He entered the mountain and river diagram and Tian Chui. Xue ningxin and Lu Ming said something and then came out again. They let the air-frozen bead float and waited quietly.</p><p>After about half a day, the air-frozen bead had absorbed five wind crystals in total.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Outside the tornado, there were tremors.</p><p>“Could it be that it has merged with the other tornadoes?”</p><p>Lu Ming made a guess.</p><p>At this time, the bird on the air-frozen bead chirped, flapped its wings, and flew to the side.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He controlled the air-frozen bead and flew it to the side of the tornado. The tornado did not hinder them at all. Lu Ming passed through the tornado directly and saw that there was another tornado next to the tornado.</p><p>The moment Lu Ming came out, he entered another tornado.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>As soon as they entered the tornado, a Wind Crystal flew into the air-frozen bead.</p><p>haha, it turns out that the air-frozen bead wants to absorb the wind crystals. Then, I will absorb as much as I want!</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily in his heart. He controlled the air-frozen bead and flew toward the bottom of the tornado. Soon, it absorbed another five wind crystals.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming controlled the air-frozen bead and rushed out of the tornado.</p><p>Lu Ming discovered that there were many tornadoes gathered and they were close to each other.</p><p>Lu Ming did not take a second look and continued to rush into the next tornado.</p><p>Just like that, after an unknown period of time, Lu Ming had entered more than ten tornadoes. The air-frozen bead had absorbed dozens of wind crystals. The green radiance on the air-frozen bead was extremely rich and dazzling.</p><p>I’ve absorbed enough. Let’s go out and see what’s going on!</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself. He then controlled the air-frozen bead and left the tornado. There was an empty space outside.</p><p>Lu Ming looked around and realized that the empty space was surrounded by tornadoes. They were close to each other and surrounded the empty space!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
