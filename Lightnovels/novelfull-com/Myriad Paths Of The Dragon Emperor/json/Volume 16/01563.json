The defensive formation shook violently and only stabilized after a long time.</p><p>“It’s blocked, it’s blocked!”</p><p>Many people from the Lu clan Fort were overjoyed.</p><p>Their defensive formation had blocked the other’s attack.</p><p>“Hmph, how can a broken formation stop me!”</p><p>The ninth level martial Royal realm elder from the Zhao clan said coldly. His palm glowed, and a spear appeared in his hand, emitting a terrifying sharp Qi.</p><p>“A Saint weapon? you have a Saint weapon?”</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila’s grandfather shouted in shock.</p><p>haha, it’s an honor for your Lu clan to be destroyed by my holy weapon!</p><p>The LV 9 martial Royal realm elder from the Zhao clan laughed out loud. His vital essence burst out as he thrust his long spear toward the Lu clan’s Castle.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The Holy weapon spear seemed to grow in size rapidly. Like a pillar that reached the sky, it stabbed heavily into the defensive formation of the Lu clan’s Castle.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The defensive formation of the Lu clan’s Fort began to shake violently.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>In the end, a crack appeared on the defensive formation of the Lu clan’s Fort.

Kill!”</p><p>The elder at the LV 9 martial Royal realm from the Zhao clan broke the Lu clan’s defensive formation with a single spear strike. He was overbearing and arrogant.</p><p>He wielded his Holy Spear like a god, ready to take the lives of the Lu family members. His spear was about to strike the Lu Castle.</p><p>The terrifying aura made Xiangxiang Beila’s grandfather, who was at the LV 8 martial Royal realm, feel desperate.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, a stone the size of a water tank flew out of the Lu clan’s Fort.

He turned his Saint weapon spear around and stabbed it at the rock.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The rock exploded, but the elder’s body shook and he couldn’t help but retreat three steps.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>The LV 9 martial Royal realm elder from the Zhao clan shouted with an unsightly expression.</p><p>He was actually forced to take three steps back by a rock.</p><p>“Me!”</p><p>A clear voice rang out. Lu Ming rose into the air and stomped toward the ninth level martial Royal realm expert from the Zhao clan.</p><p>Lu Ming had casually grabbed a stone from the side and threw it out. Although it was just an ordinary stone, it contained Lu Ming’s quintessential essence and Chaos Domain. It was as heavy as a mountain and forced the other party to take three steps back.</p><p>“Young master Lu Ming!”</p><p>Liu Wanjun’s face turned pale. However, on second thought, Lu Ming was a disciple of the Dragon God Valley. The Zhao family would not dare to touch him.</p><p>“Kid, Who are you?”</p><p>The ninth level martial Royal realm old man from the Zhao clan said coldly.</p><p>you have no right to know who I am. Now, I’ll give the Zhao clan a chance. If you realize the blood oath, you will never invade the Lu clan Fort again. Then, get lost immediately!</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Not only did his words make the 9th level martial Royal realm experts from the Zhao clan laugh, but even Zhao Tianba and the other members of the Zhao clan laughed.</p><p>“Who is this kid? What a big tone, you actually want us to take a blood oath and then get lost?”</p><p>“I’m afraid this kid has gone mad!”</p><p>what a joke. Leave this kid to me.

He is a disciple of Dragon God Valley. He has even taken Xiangxiang as his disciple!</p><p>The middle-aged man who had led the way for Lu Ming came to Xiangxiang Beila’s grandfather and reported in a low voice.</p><p>disciples of Dragon God Valley!</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila’s grandfather’s eyes lit up. Then, he sighed and said, ” it’s a pity that his cultivation is too weak. He’s only at the sixth level of the martial Royal realm. However, he’s a disciple of the Dragon God Valley. I don’t think the Zhao family would dare to touch him. If there’s a big battle later, let him take Xiangxiang away!</p><p>He had the same thought as Liu Wanjun, which was to leave with Xiangxiang.</p><p>The sixth level Martial Emperor realm was too weak to turn the tide.</p><p>“It seems like you guys aren’t leaving?” Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>nonsense. Today, we’ll make sure not a single chicken or dog is left in the Lu clan Fort. No, we’ll leave the young woman behind!</p><p>The ninth level martial Royal realm expert from the Zhao clan said coldly.</p><p>sigh, I didn’t want to kill anyone during this period of time, but you guys just have to send yourselves to death!</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly heaved a long sigh.</p><p>During this period of time, he really didn’t want to kill anyone, because if he wanted to kill someone, he had to be filled with killing intent.</p><p>His killing intent would grow stronger if he used his killing intent. His main goal now was to obliterate the killing intent in the depths of his soul.</p><p>But now, it seemed like he had no choice but to kill.</p><p>“Big words, I’ll kill you first!”</p><p>die! the LV 9 martial Royal realm expert from the Zhao family shouted coldly. He wielded his Holy Spear and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila’s grandfather, Liu Wanjun, and the others couldn’t help but shout.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the Black Dragon Spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hands. A Dragon’s Roar was heard as the Black Dragon Spear burst out.</p><p>A spear radiance clashed with the opponent’s long spear.</p><p>At the moment of collision, Lu Ming cast [ storing power thirteen strikes ]. The thirteen attacks overlapped and exploded.</p><p>The terrifying power passed through the spear and entered the man’s body. The man screamed and was pushed back. He spat out a mouthful of blood. The hand that was holding the spear exploded because of the power.</p><p>Now, with Lu Ming’s cultivation at the sixth level of the Martial Emperor realm, it was very easy for him to deal with an ordinary ninth level Martial Emperor.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted. A terrifying killing intent enveloped the other party. At the same time, he activated the divine sword technique and stabbed into the other party’s spiritual God.</p><p>arghh! the other party screamed as he felt like his soul was about to be torn apart.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The spear radiance pierced through the void like a rainbow and pierced through the dantian of the LV 9 martial Royal realm elder from the Zhao clan, destroying his spiritual spirit in one fell swoop.</p><p>ah! the other party screamed and stopped breathing, his corpse falling to the ground.</p><p>He was dead!</p><p>A Lv 9 martial Royal realm expert with a holy weapon was killed by Lu Ming in two moves.</p><p>The entire place fell silent.</p><p>Whether it was the people from the Zhao clan or the Lu clan, they were all dumbfounded.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
