The two blue deep water snakes were no match for him and were completely crushed.</p><p>so powerful! Is this the combat strength of the top ten demon-level geniuses of the Azure continent? ”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered, looking a little solemn.</p><p>The deity and Wang Jian probably hadn’t entered the Saint realm yet, but their battle power was extremely shocking. The two half-Saint blue deep water snakes weren’t their match at all.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>After a few moves, Wang Jian shouted and unsheathed the long sword on his back. A terrifying sword light cut through the void.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere as the Cang Ming water snake’s head was cut off by the sword light. Its huge body fell onto the lake and it was dead.</p><p>On the other side, the godchild’s holy light condensed into a Divine Blade and split the blue deep water snake in half.</p><p>The two of them had killed two blue deep water snakes at the same time.</p><p>Many people gasped at the sight.</p><p>He was too strong!</p><p>The half-Saint blue deep water snake was no match for it. It was killed in a few moves.</p><p>“Can you kill a Saint if you’re not a Saint?”</p><p>Someone muttered.</p><p>that’s impossible. The Saint realm is too powerful. It’s only a legend that one can kill a Saint without entering the Saint realm. Although the top ten geniuses are powerful, they can’t be a match for a Saint realm expert!</p><p>Someone analyzed in a low voice.</p><p>“Son of God, it seems like we’re evenly matched!”</p><p>Wang Jian looked at the Son of God, his eyes filled with fighting intent.</p><p>these two blue deep water snakes are too weak. There’s no point in competing!</p><p>The Son of God said casually.</p><p>“Divine Son, I will definitely defeat you in this time’s fixed treasure meet!”</p><p>Wang Jian’s eyes glowed like two divine swords.</p><p>three years ago, you weren’t my match. Now, you’re even less of a match for me!</p><p>The Son of God placed his hands behind his back and spoke indifferently. He was filled with confidence.</p><p>“Hmph, we’ll know who wins and who loses when the time comes. For now, let’s deal with these demonic beasts!”</p><p>Hmph! Wang Jian snorted coldly. His combat sword cut through the void, and rays of sword light scattered down, killing the demonic beasts one after another.</p><p>The Son of God smiled indifferently and stepped into the air. With a burst of holy light, the demonic beasts were also killed.</p><p>With Wang Jian and the divine Son taking action, it was a complete suppression. A large number of demonic beasts were harvested, and there was no room for others to intervene.</p><p>in every fixed treasure meet, the top ten monsters are the main force. Three years ago, I went to see them once, and their combat strength was amazing. Now that three years have passed, the top ten monsters ‘combat strength must be even more terrifying!</p><p>Xue ningxin said in a low voice.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. It was no wonder that they did not get any points in the treasure sealing assembly. Those below the seventh level Martial Emperor realm were not even qualified to participate. Lu Ming and the others were too weak to face such a monstrous talent. They did not even have the right to fight him and would be killed in a second.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not discouraged. These people were in the yuan continent and the cultivation environment was too good. In addition, they had amazing talent. Naturally, their cultivation was high.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was confident that he would be able to catch up to these people in a few years ‘time. He would be able to compete with them and even surpass them.</p><p>“Will I be able to participate in the next three years?”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a look of anticipation.</p><p>One of the two treasures of the treasure auction was the fragment of the prison-suppressing stele.</p><p>If he could help Dragon God Valley win first place and get the right to study two treasures for three years, could he get the fragment of the prison-suppressing stele?</p><p>Many thoughts flashed through Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere as a large number of demonic beasts were killed. Not long after, almost all the demonic beasts in Dragon Lake were slaughtered. Some of the weaker ones were so scared that they hid in the lake. The surface of the lake became quiet.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, a Dragon’s Roar came from under the lake.</p><p>However, after the Dragon’s Roar, the surface of the lake remained calm, and nothing else happened.</p><p>there must be something unusual at the bottom of the lake. Otherwise, how could there be two half-Saint blue deep water snakes in a small lake? ”</p><p>Wang Jian’s eyes were like two divine swords. He looked at the lake as if he was going to pierce through it.</p><p>“We’ll know once we break it open and take a look!”</p><p>The Son of God was extremely domineering. He was bathed in holy light like the son of a God. He took a step forward, shaking the world. Then, he extended a hand and clenched it. A powerful suction force burst out.</p><p>The lake water below was sucked up into a funnel. Then, the Divine Child pressed down with his palm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The lake water rushed down once more.</p><p>The surface of the lake trembled, and the water in the center of the lake was pushed away. The water surged in all directions, and a dry area appeared.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>The Son of God said softly. A beam of holy light flew out like a heavenly blade and slashed at the bottom of the lake.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The bottom of the lake was split open, and a huge crack appeared.</p><p>However, the bottom of the lake was empty.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The Son of God frowned.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Below him, the lake water rolled backward, causing huge waves.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, another Dragon’s Roar was heard.</p><p>“Over there!”</p><p>Wang Jian’s eyes turned. He took a step forward and appeared dozens of miles away. A shocking sword light bloomed from his hand and slashed at the lake.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A hundred-mile long sword mark appeared on the surface of the lake. The lake water was split open, and a deep crack appeared at the bottom of the lake.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar was heard from the crack. Then, a Dragon’s Shadow rushed out of the crack.</p><p>This was not a real Dragon, but a Phantom. After it rushed into the sky, it automatically dissipated.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Then, a violent roar came from the bottom of the lake, and wisps of golden light spread out.</p><p>there’s something! There’s really something under the lake!</p><p>Many people’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The water in the lake was boiling and constantly rolling. The bottom of the lake was shaking as if there was a huge creature that was trying to break free from the bottom of the lake.</p><p>The ground cracked open and endless lake water poured in. The rumbling sounds continued. Then, a huge object appeared.</p><p>This was a huge Palace that glowed with a golden light. On the walls and pillars, there were lifelike carvings of true dragons.</p><p>Dragon Palace! This is a Dragon Palace!</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>it’s said that a powerful true dragon lived in Dragon Lake in ancient times. It’s true!</p><p>this Dragon Palace is so magnificent. The true dragon living in it must be a true dragon of the Saint realm!</p><p>Many people’s eyes lit up.</p><p>There were legends in the distant past. It had been many years since then. Even if there were true dragons in the Saint realm, they would have fallen. So, after the true dragon fell, was it in this Dragon Palace?</p><p>How many treasures were there in the Dragon Palace?</p><p>No wonder there were so many powerful aquatic demonic beasts in this Lake. It turned out that there was a Dragon Palace at the bottom of the lake.</p><p>The ground caved in, and the lake water was swept away. Soon, the entire Dragon Palace appeared in front of everyone.</p><p>In front of the Dragon Palace, there was a wide passage that led to the gate of the Dragon Palace.</p><p>It could be seen that the door was tightly shut.</p><p>On both sides of the passage, there were statues of true dragons. They seemed to be made of bronze and were very lifelike, looking very mighty.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
