A space-time domain spread out from the pagoda. A transparent bubble suddenly formed and trapped a ninth level Martial Emperor demonic creature. Lu Ming grabbed the demonic evil crystal from the demonic creature.</p><p>“It’s so convenient with bubbles ‘help!”</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming’s face was full of smiles.</p><p>Bubbles was hiding in that Pagoda.</p><p>As Lu Ming’s cultivation level grew higher, the people he came into contact with also became more powerful. Many people would be able to recognize bubbles at a glance.</p><p>An infant space-time spirit mouse was priceless and its temptation was terrifying. Lu Ming would be in danger if some powerful beings were interested in it.</p><p>Therefore, when Lu Ming wanted bubbles to come out and help, he would let bubbles enter the pagoda.</p><p>This way, many people would think that this Pagoda only had the effects of the time and space domain.</p><p>A Pagoda with a time domain was precious, but it had some functions. Because it couldn’t be upgraded, some powerful existences didn’t want it.</p><p>However, if it was a space-time spirit mouse, it would be completely different. If it was raised, it would be able to defy the heavens in the future.</p><p>This was a true top ten Warbeast!</p><p>Lu Ming naturally had to be more careful.</p><p>After getting the demonic fiend crystal, Lu Ming left the cave and continued to move forward.</p><p>This area was very vast. Until now, Lu Ming had not met anyone else.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming obtained dozens of demonic evil crystals.</p><p>Roar! Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming heard a series of roars coming from the front. They were all the roars of demons. Judging from the sounds, there were many of them.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he rushed toward the source of the sound.</p><p>After bypassing two mountains, Lu Ming saw a large group of demons besieging four young men.</p><p>“It’s them. What a coincidence!”</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes slightly.</p><p>The four young men were actually Yun Xi, Yun Kai, and the others.</p><p>They must have seen the others coming over, so they followed them.</p><p>There were at least a hundred demonic creatures besieging Yun Xi and the other three.</p><p>With Yun Xi’s combat strength, it was easy for her to fight above her level, so she was not afraid of these demonic creatures. However, it was not easy to get the demonic evil crystals with so many demonic creatures.</p><p>damn it, these demonic creatures are too cunning. They always avoid the heads, so we can’t get the demonic evil crystals at all!</p><p>Yun Kai cursed.</p><p>If there were only a few demonic creatures, they could have besieged them to get the demonic evil crystals. However, there were too many demonic creatures on the scene.</p><p>Moreover, you can’t directly break the head of the demonic creature. If you do that, the demonic evil crystals inside will also be broken, which will be a waste.</p><p>Yun Xi and the other three kept attacking, and the demonic creatures ‘bodies were destroyed one after another. However, as soon as these demonic creatures were destroyed, other demonic creatures rushed over and attacked Yun Xi and the others, making them unable to pursue and seize the demonic evil crystals.</p><p>After fighting for a while, they didn’t even get a single demonic fiend crystal.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming took a step forward and walked out.</p><p>“It’s you, Lu Ming?”</p><p>When Lu Ming walked out, Yun Xi, Yun Kai, and the others were very surprised.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re still alive. You’re lucky that no one from the thousand-kill mansion has come to find you!”</p><p>Yun Kai sneered.</p><p>Lu Ming cast an indifferent glance at Yun Kai. He simply ignored such people.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming appeared, the group of demons changed their direction and charged at him.</p><p>Almost all of them were at the sixth or seventh level of the martial Royal realm.</p><p>“The nine seals of the gate of God!”</p><p>Lu Ming conjured a series of hand seals and seven sealing gates appeared, sealing the seven demonic creatures. Then, in a flash, seven demonic fiend crystals appeared in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>“It’s that easy?”</p><p>Yun Xi, Yun Kai, and the others were dumbfounded.</p><p>Yun Kai, in particular, revealed a look of jealousy.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>More demons charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming condensed the sealing door again. This time, bubbles assisted him. A large number of demons were fixed in place and could not move.</p><p>Lu Ming looked as if he was taking a stroll in the courtyard, as if he was picking fruits from his backyard. He reached out with his claws and took out demonic evil crystals one after another. The demonic creatures turned into demonic Qi and dissipated.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming rushed to the demons that were besieging Yun Xi and the others. He used the same old plan again. Not long after, more than a Hundred Demons turned into demonic Qi and dissipated. The demonic evil crystals all entered Lu Ming’s mountain and river diagram.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>Yun Xi and the others were stunned.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Yun Kai’s eyes were filled with flames of jealousy.</p><p>It was not easy for them to obtain a single demonic fiend crystal, but Lu Ming had easily obtained more than a hundred of them.</p><p>His speed was many times faster than theirs.</p><p>“Lu Ming, we’re the ones who lured these demonic creatures here. It’s too unkind of you to attack them halfway. Aren’t you going to give us some demonic fiend crystals?”</p><p>Yun Kai’s eyes turned and he sneered.</p><p>“You lured him here? What a joke, this area is full of demonic creatures, how could you say that you attracted them here? I even saved you, but you don’t even thank me for saving you, and you want me to share the demonic evil crystals with you? you are really thick-skinned!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Yun Kai snorted coldly, his expression somewhat unsightly. Then, his eyes flickered, and he revealed a fake smile, ” “Lu Ming, you came in from the cloud Emperor mountain and are part of our team. How about you return to the team now? We’ll get the crystals together and then split them equally, how about it?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and looked at Yun Kai as if he was an idiot.</p><p>This Yun Kai was not only thick-skinned, he was also shameless.</p><p>Previously, he was afraid of being hunted down by the thousand kills house and chased Lu Ming away. Now, after seeing Lu Ming’s amazing efficiency in snatching the demonic evil crystals, he wanted Lu Ming to return to the team. He even proposed to split the demonic evil crystals equally. How ridiculous was that?</p><p>A mocking smile hung on the corner of Lu Ming’s lips.”Sure, but after we get out of this place, we’ll still be a team and we’ll have to explore together. How about it?”</p><p>“This …”</p><p>Yun Kai immediately stiffened.</p><p>What a joke. After they left this place, Lu Ming would continue to stay with them. If the assassins from the thousand-kill mansion came, they would have to die with Lu Ming. How could that be?</p><p>Yun Kai’s eyes turned again,”alright, sure!”</p><p>Although he said that, he was thinking that he should calm Lu Ming down first. After he obtained a large number of demonic fiend crystals and left this place, he would kick Lu Ming away.</p><p>haha, I was just joking with you. You actually believed that? ”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed out loud, his mocking intent growing stronger.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you …”</p><p>Yun Kai was furious. He knew that he had been fooled by Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming had no intention of returning to the team.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>At this time, roars came from a nearby Valley. The ground was shaking as a group of demonic creatures charged over.</p><p>“There are so many demonic creatures here!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and a sealing gate was formed, locking the seven demons in place. The next moment, Lu Ming had seven more demonic brake stones.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
