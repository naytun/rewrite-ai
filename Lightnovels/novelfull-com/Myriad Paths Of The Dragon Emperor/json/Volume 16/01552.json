I already have a space-breaking flying shuttle. Mo he and the others have contributed a lot of good things!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled, took out two holy weapons, and returned them to Tian Chui.</p><p>“Say goodbye to eighth Senior Sister for me!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists, then rose into the air and flew out of the grey Mountain.</p><p>Once he was out of the range of the grey Mountains, Lu Ming waved his hand and the space-breaking flying shuttle appeared. It rapidly grew to a hundred meters in size. The door opened and Lu Ming entered the space-breaking flying shuttle.</p><p>This flying shuttle was extremely similar to Tian Chui’s, and their grades were also similar, both being low grade flying shuttles.</p><p>The higher grade of the space-breaking flying shuttle was faster, but the price was also astonishingly high. Ordinary people simply couldn’t afford it.</p><p>After Lu Ming placed the rough stone, he set the location of Dragon God Valley and activated the space-breaking shuttle.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The flying shuttle turned into a ray of light and disappeared. It flew in the direction of Dragon God Valley at an extreme speed.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he sat cross-legged in the space-breaking flying shuttle and took out a Jade bottle.</p><p>Inside the Jade bottle was the reward for this treasure auction-four royal domain pills.</p><p>It would take about half a month to return to Dragon God Valley from here, even if he took the space-breaking shuttle. He could use this time to cultivate and refine the four Royal pills.</p><p>Lu Ming poured out a royal domain pill and swallowed it.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>After the Royal pill entered his stomach, it immediately turned into rolling energy.</p><p>such powerful energy. It’s more than ten times stronger than the Royal fruit!</p><p>Lu Ming was not shocked. Instead, he was happy.</p><p>The Royal domain pill was indeed a pill that could directly increase the cultivation of a mid-stage martial Royal realm by one level. It was made with nine royal domain fruits and other precious herbs.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming held his breath and concentrated, starting to refine the medicinal effects.</p><p>Time passed quickly. In the blink of an eye, seven days had passed.</p><p>In seven days, Lu Ming had refined all four royal domain pills.</p><p>peak of the fifth level martial monarch realm!</p><p>Lu Ming opened his eyes and felt the vast and majestic energy in his body. He was elated.</p><p>In seven days, he had refined all four Royal pills. Lu Ming’s cultivation had increased by one level, reaching the peak of the fifth level martial Royal realm.</p><p>What others could achieve with one royal domain pill, Lu Ming had used four of them, but he was still very satisfied.</p><p>His cultivation level had increased by one level. He did not know how much time he had saved.</p><p>This would increase both his true Yuan and domain.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming’s Chaos Domain had also reached the peak of level five.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s current cultivation level, he could easily defeat a prodigy like mo he if he participated in the treasure auction. There was no need for him to use the chaos sky-turning seal.</p><p>“Now, has the treasure sealing assembly already started?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He then shook his head and smiled. He closed his eyes again to consolidate his cultivation.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another day passed.</p><p>Late at night, in the vast mountains, Lu Ming’s sky-breaking flying shuttle flashed across the sky like a meteor.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming was cultivating when the space-breaking flying shuttle suddenly shook violently.</p><p>“Someone is attacking the shuttle!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly opened his eyes and looked outside through the crystal glass of the space-breaking flying shuttle.</p><p>Above the dark clouds, several big hands stretched out and fell from the sky, heavily bombarding the space-breaking flying shuttle.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The space-breaking flying shuttle shook violently as if it was about to explode.</p><p>Then, a huge hand grabbed the 100-meter-long shuttle and smashed it toward a nearby mountain.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The peak of the mountain trembled, and the tip of the mountain crumbled, sending gravel flying everywhere.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold. He moved and rushed out of the space-breaking flying shuttle. The space-breaking flying shuttle shrank rapidly and was put away by Lu Ming.</p><p>In the pitch-black night sky, more than ten black shadows appeared and surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Without any unnecessary words, one of them coldly spoke.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>More than a dozen terrifying sword gleams shot toward Lu Ming at an astonishing speed.</p><p>the seventh level of the Martial Emperor realm. They are all experts above the seventh level. There are even some at the eighth level!</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils constricted.</p><p>Those who had besieged him were all experts. None of them were below the seventh level Martial Emperor realm. They were all high-level martial emperors.</p><p>Without any hesitation, the black wings appeared. With a flap, Lu Ming soared into the sky.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>A few terrifying sword lights suddenly appeared above his head.</p><p>Lv 8 martial Royal realm!</p><p>The people who appeared above him were all at Lv 8 martial Royal realm.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Lu Ming had countless thoughts in his mind.</p><p>Who was it that wanted to kill him?</p><p>He had only told Tian Chui that he was coming out, but Tian Chui would never sell him out. It was very likely that someone had been keeping a close eye on Lu Ming. The moment Lu Ming left the Cang mountains, he had been targeted.</p><p>The reason why he only took action now was most likely to wait for Lu Ming to let his guard down and to make sure that there were no experts following Lu Ming. He only took action after he was certain that Lu Ming was alone.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming roared. The divine sword technique burst out and formed a terrifying soul attack, attacking the few people above him.</p><p>However, the other party’s body only trembled slightly, as if nothing had happened. The sword light did not stop and continued to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>“The godly sword technique is useless!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. At the same time, the Black Dragon Spear appeared in his hands and he thrust it forward.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A spear radiance destroyed a sword radiance and pierced through a black-robed figure. The destructive power obliterated all of the person’s life force.</p><p>Lu Ming had killed an eighth level martial monarch.</p><p>However, the other sword gleams were already approaching Lu Ming.</p><p>The black wings flapped out and blocked Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The sword light stabbed Lu Ming’s body. Lu Ming’s body trembled and he was sent flying.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Borrowing this force, Lu Ming cast the wind elemental technique. He flapped his black wings again and rushed forward.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Black Dragon Spear swept out and turned into a thousand-meter long spear radiance that swept forward.</p><p>A Lv 7 martial Royal realm expert was hit. 13 forces overlapped and exploded. That person’s body exploded directly. The terrifying power swept towards the second Lv 8 martial Royal realm expert. The second expert screamed and was killed as well.</p><p>With the Black Dragon Spear in his hand, Lu Ming’s attack was even more powerful.</p><p>Even without a holy weapon, it would not be too difficult for Lu Ming to kill an ordinary Lv 8 Martial Emperor with his current cultivation at the peak of the fifth level.</p><p>With his holy weapon, he could easily kill an ordinary Lv 8 martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>Lu Ming had killed two people in a row, but the other sword gleams had all landed on him.</p><p>Lu Ming blocked the attack with his black wings, but his body was still sent flying.</p><p>After all, their opponents were both seventh or eighth grade martial emperors. Although Lu Ming could kill those of a higher grade, he could not deny the strength of their attacks. They were both high-level martial emperors and their attacks were definitely terrifying.</p><p>If it landed on Lu Ming, he would be injured even if he did not die.</p><p>“Full attack!”</p><p>A voice was heard.</p><p>“Kill, kill!”</p><p>The sword light continued to stab at Lu Ming, but some of them changed their long swords to sabers. With a loud shout, the terrifying Saber Light cut through the void and lit up the dark night as it slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“This is … Intentionless blade technique?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
