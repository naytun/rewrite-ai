Lu Ming, I know you’re quite powerful, but you’re mostly relying on your holy weapon. Now that you can’t use your holy weapon, how much power can you unleash? I’m a Lv 6 Martial Emperor, so killing you will be as easy as turning my hand!”</p><p>The young man from the heavenly God sect laughed out loud. The aura on his body was getting stronger and stronger, more and more shocking.</p><p>Without a doubt, this young man from the tianshen sect was definitely a powerful heaven’s pride expert. He had cultivated a medium-grade earth spiritual body and was extremely powerful. Among the many heaven’s pride experts in the tianshen sect, he was also at the top. His talent was not inferior to Shi Tian.</p><p>With his combat strength, it was a piece of cake for him to fight someone of a higher level. Moreover, Lu Ming was only at the fourth level of the Martial Emperor realm. He was 120% confident that he could kill Lu Ming without using his holy weapon.</p><p>nonsense! Attack! Use your full strength!</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“Since you’re in a hurry to die, I’ll send you on your way. Kill!”</p><p>The Paragon of the tianshen sect burst out with dazzling holy light. A spear of divine punishment condensed in his palm. The spear of divine punishment pierced through the void and stabbed toward Lu Ming. The terrifying sharpness whistled between heaven and earth, as if it could penetrate everything in the world.</p><p>The Paragon of the tianshen sect had used a killing move as soon as he made his move. He wanted to kill Lu Ming in one move.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar came from Lu Ming’s body. Then, he wrapped his fist in the chaos Domain and threw a punch.</p><p>The prison suppressing heavenly art was unleashed.</p><p>This punch was aimed at the opponent’s spear of God punishment.</p><p>how dare you use your fist against my spear of God’s punishment! You’re courting death! Break!</p><p>The heaven deity sect’s Paragon shouted coldly.</p><p>On the platform, many of the people from the heavenly God sect sneered.</p><p>However, the next moment, their sneers froze on their faces.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s fist landed on the spear of God’s punishment, which exploded instantly. Lu Ming’s fist, like a piece of rotten wood, smashed towards his opponent.</p><p>“No, no…”</p><p>The other party’s pupils enlarged and he shouted in fear.</p><p>He had thought that he could kill Lu Ming in one move and had not even set up any defense. It was too late to do so now.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s fist landed on the young man from the deity sect. His body exploded into pieces.</p><p>He was dead. The heaven’s pride of the tianshen sect, a Lv 6 martial Royal realm expert, was killed by Lu Ming with one punch.</p><p>“You’re just a piece of trash!”</p><p>Lu Ming said disdainfully. He stretched out his hand and sucked the storage ring of the genius of the deity sect into his hand.</p><p>“Good kill!”</p><p>Tian Chui excitedly shouted.</p><p>“Good, good, kill, you should be killed!”</p><p>The other disciples of Dragon God Valley shouted one after another. Their faces were red with excitement. The anger in their chest was finally relieved.</p><p>After the challenge, they had finally killed a person from the Tian Shen sect. Moreover, he was a sixth level martial Royal realm expert who had cultivated a Medium Earth spiritual body. They had finally vented their anger.</p><p>“Damn it, it’s this Lu Ming again!”</p><p>On the side of the heavenly Divine sect, many people were furious.</p><p>leave this Lu Ming to me. I want him to die an ugly death!</p><p>“Liu Quan was just careless just now. Leave Lu Ming to me!”</p><p>The other heaven’s favorites from the heavenly God sect roared.</p><p>alright, I’ll be waiting. All of you, come and challenge me!</p><p>Lu Ming looked in the direction of the heaven deity sect with an extremely cold gaze. Then, he swept his gaze over the Tian Yu demon sect and the Yu Du sect.</p><p>Let’s just wait and see. The counterattack of Dragon God Valley was about to begin.</p><p>Lu Ming moved and returned to the fighting ring.</p><p>“Let’s continue!”</p><p>The leader of the tianshen sect shouted as he looked at the Tianyu demonic sect.</p><p>don’t worry. The outcome of Dragon God Valley is already decided!</p><p>The leader of the Tianyu demonic sect sneered and sent an expert to challenge a Lv 5 martial Royal realm expert from Dragon God Valley.</p><p>The fifth-level martial Royal realm heaven’s favorite of Dragon God Valley was also very powerful. He tried his best to rush down the fighting ring, but he was almost killed by his opponent at the edge of the fighting ring.</p><p>Then, it was the Yu Du sect’s turn. Dragon God Valley had another person killed.</p><p>One by one, the sects took their turn. On the eighth platform, the life-and-death Sword sect issued a challenge.</p><p>Until now, the life-and-death Sword sect had not lost a single person.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A sword light flashed, and a figure appeared on the fighting ring.</p><p>This person was someone Lu Ming had met in the Emperor Cang secret realm, Luo Xiang.</p><p>Luo Xiang’s eyes turned and finally landed on the platform of the Tian Shen sect. He looked at a man at the sixth level of the martial Royal realm and said, ” “You, fight me!”</p><p>Many people’s hearts moved. The life-and-death Sword sect was actually challenging the heavenly Divine sect.</p><p>The heaven’s pride expert of the heaven God sect who was challenged stepped onto the fighting ring with a slightly gloomy face.</p><p>“Make your move!” He sized up Luo Xiang and said.</p><p>“You attack first, or you won’t have a chance!”</p><p>Luo Xiang said indifferently.</p><p>“Arrogant, let’s see what you can do!”</p><p>die! the heaven God sect’s Paragon shouted coldly. The spear of divine punishment appeared and pierced towards Luo Xiang.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A sword light flashed from Luo Xiang’s hand.</p><p>Fast, it was too fast. Almost no one could see how Luo Xiang had attacked. The sword light flashed in the void.</p><p>In the next moment, Luo Xiang’s sword returned to its sheath.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>The heaven’s pride expert of the heavenly God sect widened his eyes and stared at Luo Xiang unwillingly. Then, his body was split into two.</p><p>He was dead!</p><p>A sixth level martial Royal realm heaven’s favorite of the heavenly God sect had been killed by Luo Xiang with a single sword strike.</p><p>so powerful! Is this the sword technique of the life-and-death Sword sect? it’s so terrifying! That Luo Xiang is only at Lv 5 Martial Emperor realm!</p><p>Many people exclaimed in admiration, and even more people felt chills all over their bodies.</p><p>How could he Dodge such a sword?</p><p>“This Luo Xiang is indeed not simple!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with surprise.</p><p>He had heard that Luo Xiang had been cultivating his swordsoul for 15 years at zhizun realm pinnacle, but he hadn’t made a breakthrough.</p><p>Such a person was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Now, Luo Xiang had made a breakthrough and obtained the inheritance of sword principle in the great emperor secret realm. He had truly soared to the sky.</p><p>In a short period of time, his cultivation had soared to the LV 5 martial Royal realm and he had even killed a heaven’s favorite of the tianshen sect with one strike.</p><p>Such a person would become more and more terrifying the longer it took him to break through to the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>Back in Emperor Cang’s Secret realm, Luo Xiang had just broken through to the martial Royal realm and his potential had yet to be unleashed. Now, he was truly terrifying.</p><p>“Luo Xiang, my heavenly God sect has never offended your life-and-death Sword sect. Why did you kill my people?”</p><p>The leader of the heavenly God sect asked with a cold face.</p><p>“It’s simple, I don’t like the sight of you guys!”</p><p>Luo Xiang said indifferently, then stepped out and returned to the platform of the life-and-death Sword sect.</p><p>“Good kill, good kill, I’m starting to like this Luo Xiang!”</p><p>Tian Chui grinned.</p><p>The competition continued, and when it was Dragon God Valley’s turn, han Xun sent out the person with the lowest cultivation to challenge the other sect’s geniuses, and was defeated.</p><p>Soon, the fourth round was over.</p><p>In this round, Dragon God Valley had two deaths, one defeat, and one victory. There were still twenty-one people left.</p><p>However, the people from Dragon God Valley were getting stronger and stronger.</p><p>As expected, from the fifth round onwards, Dragon God Valley was no longer being killed blindly. They had the power to resist.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
