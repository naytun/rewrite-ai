Next, it was Xie Sha’s turn to challenge the evil moon sect.</p><p>Xie Sha’s expression was extremely unsightly.</p><p>...</p><p>The young man in purple gold armor was defeated after blocking one move from Lu Ming. He did not know how much essential core Lu Ming had used up.</p><p>He had no confidence in challenging Lu Ming now.</p><p>However, he could not possibly go back on his promise with the young man in purple gold armor and the rest and give up on challenging Lu Ming.</p><p>If he did not challenge Lu Ming, he would challenge someone else. However, there were no weaklings among those who remained. Even if he could win, he would definitely be injured. Then, the next person to challenge would definitely challenge him and he would definitely lose.</p><p>“Let’s go all out!”</p><p>Xie Sha gritted his teeth.</p><p>He knew that it would most likely be difficult for him to make it to the end. He might as well challenge Lu Ming and leave a good reputation.</p><p>Xie Sha landed on the fighting ring and looked at Lu Ming. “Lu Ming, how about a battle between us?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. He took a step forward and stepped into the fighting ring again.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming did not waste any time. As soon as he stepped onto the fighting ring, he made a hand seal and a chaos sky-turning seal appeared in his hands.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw the chaos sky-turning seal at Xie Sha.</p><p>Xie Sha’s expression changed drastically. His body was filled with evil Qi. A blood-red moon appeared in his hand and he threw it at the chaos sky-turning seal.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a deafening sound, the blood-red moon and the chaos sky-turning seal collided. It only lasted for a few breaths before it collapsed. Xie Sha himself was sent flying, spitting out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>He looked at Lu Ming in shock. He only understood how terrifying Lu Ming’s chaos sky-turning seal was after personally witnessing it.</p><p>what kind of attack is this? how can it be so terrifying? ”</p><p>Xie Sha thought.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and walked towards Xie Sha.</p><p>“I’ve lost this battle!”</p><p>Xie Sha shouted and rushed down the fighting ring.</p><p>Just like the youth in purple gold armor, he admitted defeat.</p><p>These people had their own selfish motives. After taking one move, they understood that they were no match for Lu Ming. Otherwise, with their abilities, they could have taken the second move of the chaos sky-turning seal. However, they would be severely injured.</p><p>It was the same as the purple gold armored youth. He was going to lose anyway, so why did he have to risk his life? if he was too injured, it would affect his cultivation. It was better to leave it to the people behind.</p><p>So, just like the youth in purple gold armor, Xie Sha admitted defeat after taking a hit.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming decided not to return to the platform. His gaze fell on the jiuxiao sword sect’s expert.”Next, you should be challenging me, right? Come down!”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>With a flash of sword light, the Paragon of the jiuxiao sword sect stepped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>“Just like before, let’s have a spar. Let’s not fight to the death!”</p><p>The jiuxiao sword sect disciple said.</p><p>“Sure!”</p><p>A chaos sky-turning seal appeared in Lu Ming’s hand as he spoke. He did not bother to waste time and threw the seal at the jiuxiao sword sect experts.</p><p>The huge Primal Chaos sky-turning seal was like a mountain, completely enveloping the opponent. On such a fighting stage, it was difficult for the opponent to avoid it. He could only take it head-on.</p><p>A sword cry was heard, and a brilliant sword light shot up into the sky, slashing at the chaos sky-turning seal.</p><p>In the next moment, the sword radiance shattered and the primal Chaos sky-turning seal came crashing down, causing the young man from jiuxiao sword sect to spit out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>His eyes revealed a look of unwillingness.</p><p>He did not want to be defeated like this. However, given the current situation, he did not know how many more of such attacks Lu Ming could release.</p><p>“Let’s go all out!”</p><p>The jiuxiao sword sect disciple’s eyes gleamed with hatred. He became one with his sword and turned into a dazzling sword radiance, slashing at Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s entire body was covered in the chaos Domain. Another chaos sky-turning stamp appeared in his palm and he threw it at the Paragon of the jiuxiao sword sect.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The heaven’s favorite from the jiuxiao sword sect was shocked and quickly retreated. He wanted to avoid it, but under the pressure of the chaos heaven flipping seal, he could not escape.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The Paragon of jiuxiao sword sect slashed out hundreds of times in a row. The dazzling sword radiance collided with the chaos Empyrean seal, causing sparks to fly. Then, the sword Qi collapsed. The Paragon of jiuxiao sword sect groaned as he was blasted off the battle platform by the chaos Empyrean seal. His clothes were dyed red with blood, and his face was as pale as a sheet.</p><p>After taking two consecutive blows from the chaos sky-turning stamp, his injuries were more serious than the previous two.</p><p>“Why is Lu Ming’s move so powerful?”</p><p>indeed, the power is too terrifying. I can’t match it at all. The key is, how many times can he use this kind of attack? he has already used it four times in a row!</p><p>“I should be reaching my limit soon!”</p><p>On the fighting ring, Lu Ming’s gaze fell on the sovereign of the Linglong Palace.</p><p>The sovereign of the Linglong Palace was an extremely beautiful woman.</p><p>In fact, the disciples of the Linglong Palace were all women. Each and every one of them was a beautiful woman.</p><p>The sovereign of the Linglong Palace stepped forward with a beautiful smile on her face and said, ” “Young master Lu Ming, please show mercy!”</p><p>The fragrance was soft and tender, making people unable to bear to make a move.</p><p>However, Lu Ming immediately condensed a chaos sky-turning stamp and threw it at the other party.</p><p>The absolute Beauty’s expression changed. With a wave of her hand, countless flower petals appeared. The countless flower petals formed a huge hand and dragged toward the chaos sky-turning seal.</p><p>However, the result was the same. The giant hand collapsed, and the beautiful woman slid a hundred meters away on the fighting ring, blood flowing from the corner of her mouth.</p><p>“Young master Lu Ming, you don’t know how to be tender to women at all!”</p><p>The absolute beauty wiped the blood from the corner of her mouth and glared at Lu Ming in a coquettish manner.</p><p>fairy’s combat power is amazing. If I had been gentlemanly, I’m afraid I would have been the one who lost!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward. The air of chaos in his palm was thick and rolling.</p><p>This absolute Beauty’s combat strength was absolutely astonishing. After receiving his Primal Chaos sky-turning seal, her injuries were the lightest.</p><p>“Young master Lu Ming, I wonder how many more moves you can use against such a powerful ultimate move?”</p><p>The absolute beauty said with a smile.</p><p>“Won’t you know if you try, fairy?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. Another chaos sky-turning seal was formed in his hand.</p><p>The absolute Beauty’s expression was solemn as countless flower petals flew around her.</p><p>The countless petals formed a seven-colored pattern, making the beautiful woman look like a goddess.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming launched his second attack, the second chaos sky-turning seal.</p><p>This time, the flower petals around the absolute beauty formed a shield in front of her.</p><p>The primal Chaos sky-turning stamp crashed down, shattering the shield. The beautiful woman was forced to retreat to the edge of the fighting ring. Her body trembled and she spat out a mouthful of blood. It was a pitiful sight.</p><p>“Fairy, do you still want to try?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The beautiful woman’s expression changed. In the end, she sighed, turned around, and left the fighting ring.</p><p>Lu Ming had defeated another person.</p><p>At this moment, the entire place was silent.</p><p>Lu Ming had defeated four people in a row. Each of them was a top-notch heaven’s pride expert who had taken part in the party this time. However, Lu Ming had defeated four people in a row.</p><p>In addition to the three people who were killed by Lu Ming previously, Lu Ming had defeated seven such top-notch geniuses by himself this time.</p><p>This was definitely the first time in ten thousand years.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
