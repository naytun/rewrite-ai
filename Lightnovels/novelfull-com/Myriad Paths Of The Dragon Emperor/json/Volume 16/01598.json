Do you want to die?”</p><p>no, it’s my honor to present my demonic evil crystals to you. I have an important piece of news to tell you. There’s a person who has at least hundreds of demonic evil crystals, or even more!</p><p>Yun Kai hurriedly said.</p><p>“A few hundred?”</p><p>The noble youth’s eyes were burning with passion.</p><p>“Kid, who has the ability to get a few hundred demonic evil crystals? if you lie, you’re asking for death, you know?”</p><p>A young man in purple shouted coldly.</p><p>I’m not lying. We can all testify that the man has mastered a sealing technique that can quickly seal the demonic creatures and then seize the demonic evil crystals. This place is filled with dense demonic Qi, which has not dissipated yet. It’s caused by the man just now!</p><p>Yun Kai said.</p><p>“Yunkai, you …”</p><p>Yun Xi scolded.</p><p>She did not expect Yun Kai to be so despicable that he wanted to push Lu Ming out.</p><p>Yun Kai’s eyes flickered with a ruthless light, and he didn’t look at Yun Xi.</p><p>that’s right. The demonic Qi here is indeed very dense. Who is that person? ”</p><p>The noble youth said.</p><p>you’ve all seen that person. The kid who was with us previously even defeated one of you by luck. His name is Lu Ming!</p><p>Yun Kai hurriedly said.</p><p>“So it’s him!”</p><p>The noble young man’s eyes flashed with a sharp light and said, ” you’d better not let me find out. You’re lying to me. Tell me, which direction did he go? ”</p><p>“That direction!”</p><p>Yun Kai pointed in the direction where Lu Ming had left.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The distinguished young man said. He led the two young men in purple in the direction that Lu Ming had left and disappeared in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“Yun Kai, you’ve gone too far. Lu Ming has no grudges with us. We came in together and let him leave alone. That’s too much!”</p><p>Yun Xi looked at Yun Kai with a disappointed expression.</p><p>“Hmph, why are you in such a hurry? Don’t tell me you’ve taken a fancy to that kid?”</p><p>Yun Kai sneered.</p><p>“You … Don’t spout nonsense!”</p><p>Yun Xi said, blushing.</p><p>“Hmph, that brat doesn’t know what’s good for him. He’s so arrogant. I don’t like him. He’s just from the Azure continent. He has to be respectful in front of my cloud Emperor mountain. Otherwise, he’ll die!”</p><p>Yun Kai said coldly, his eyes filled with jealousy.</p><p>Yun Xi sighed, filled with loathing for Yun Kai.</p><p>Yun Kai was too narrow-minded.</p><p>……</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming did not know that the WAN family’s Paragon was already looking for him. He continued to search for demonic creatures and seize demonic fiend crystals.</p><p>Along the way, he seized dozens of demonic evil crystals.</p><p>He already had nearly three hundred demonic fiend crystals on him.</p><p>Of course, most of them were at Lv 6 martial Royal realm. There were even some at Lv 5, Lv 8, and Lv 9. Although there were few of them, they were still a huge fortune.</p><p>If he were to refine it, his soul power would definitely increase greatly.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A demonic leopard with amazing speed actually ran away when it saw that it was no match for the opponent.</p><p>This was a demonic creature at the peak of the ninth level martial Royal realm. Lu Ming would not let it escape.</p><p>“Where do you think you’re going!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast the wind elemental technique, coupled with the black wings, and chased after the demonic leopard at top speed.</p><p>However, when the demonic leopard ran, it was like a bolt of Black Lightning. Lu Ming could not catch up with it for a while.</p><p>it seems like I have to find some time to cultivate a movement technique domain martial technique. The wind element technique can’t keep up!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>As his cultivation level increased, the wind elemental technique was gradually becoming insufficient. He had to cultivate stronger martial arts techniques.</p><p>“Bubble!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to bubbles.</p><p>The pagoda floating above his head emitted the sound of a bubble. Then, a transparent bubble suddenly appeared and enveloped the demonic leopard.</p><p>The demonic leopard was frozen in place.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming rushed over. His hand was like a dragon’s claw as he grabbed the demonic leopard’s head and pulled out a demonic fiend crystal.</p><p>Zhen Yuan poured in and obliterated the spirit of the demonic fiend crystal.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming looked behind him.</p><p>The sound of something breaking through the air was heard. Three figures came at top speed and appeared in Lu Ming’s line of sight.</p><p>“It’s them!”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned slightly. The three people who had appeared were the three from the WAN family.</p><p>“I’ve finally found this guy!”</p><p>A young man in purple laughed.</p><p>After a few breaths, the three people from the WAN family appeared in front of Lu Ming. Two of them, who were young men in purple, surrounded Lu Ming in a flash.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Back then, one of them was defeated, and now it’s time for another to fight?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and said coldly.</p><p>“Brat, you only won against me because I was careless!”</p><p>The young man in purple who was defeated by Lu Ming earlier said with a gloomy expression, ” boy, I heard that you have a large number of demonic evil crystals and know a sealing technique. Now, hand over all your demonic evil crystals and follow us to hunt for them. If you do that, I will spare your life!</p><p>they’re after my demonic fiend crystals and the sealing technique again. But how did they know I have a large number of demonic fiend crystals? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold.</p><p>These people didn’t see him hunting a large number of demons.</p><p>I think you’ve made a mistake. I’m alone, so how can I have a large number of demonic evil crystals? since I entered here, I’ve only obtained a few demonic evil crystals. If you want them, I’ll give them to you. Besides, I don’t know any sealing techniques!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Brat, don’t try to quibble. It was said by a brat who was with you before. It’s said by your own people, how can it be wrong?”</p><p>A young man in purple sneered.</p><p>“One of our own? Open the clouds!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He guessed that Yun Kai must have told him.</p><p>A cold killing intent flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. Yun Kai was always at odds with him. It seemed like he would kill him if he had the chance.</p><p>Previously, he came here by taking the teleportation formation of the cloud Emperor mountain. In the future, he would have to pass by the cloud Emperor mountain when he left. That was why he kept showing mercy to Yun Kai. However, it seemed that it was useless to show mercy now. The other party would only become more aggressive. If there was a chance, Lu Ming would kill him.</p><p>“Kid, you have nothing to say now, right? hurry up and hand it over. Come with us and help us seal the demonic creature!”</p><p>A young man in purple berated.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll pay!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>With that, a storage ring appeared in Lu Ming’s hand and he threw it at the distinguished young man.</p><p>The distinguished young man subconsciously blocked it. At this moment, Lu Ming made his move.</p><p>He charged at the youth in purple, who was at the peak of Lv 8 Martial Emperor realm. He activated his prison suppressing heaven technique and punched him.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>The young man did not expect Lu Ming to suddenly attack him. He roared and resisted with all his might.</p><p>However, in his haste, he could only use less than half of his strength. How could he block Lu Ming? Lu Ming’s fist force pressed down and the young man in purple was torn to pieces.</p><p>“How dare you! You’re looking for death!”</p><p>At this moment, the noble young man finally reacted. He let out a loud roar, and a terrifying Qi of a combat weapon emanated from his body. He swung his palm at Lu Ming with terrifying power.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
