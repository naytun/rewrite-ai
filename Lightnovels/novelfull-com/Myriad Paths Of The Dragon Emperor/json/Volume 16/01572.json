The surrounding people all flew towards the sky wind Plains.</p><p>“Is there a change in the heavenly wind Plains?”</p><p>The expressions of Lu Ming and the other three changed.</p><p>“Junior Brother, how about we go and take a look?”</p><p>Tian Chui said.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go!”</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, Tian Chui, and Xue ningxin flew towards the Windy Plains.</p><p>Bzzzz …</p><p>At this moment, another cry of a Phoenix could be heard from the heavenly wind Plains. The cry was filled with despair and unwillingness.</p><p>“The Phoenix’s cry is getting softer and softer. It seems to be getting weaker and weaker!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>could it be that the divine bird Phoenix is about to fall, so it keeps chirping? ”</p><p>Xie nianqing guessed.</p><p>“It’s not impossible!” Lu Ming said.</p><p>Very quickly, the four of them arrived at the outskirts of the heavenly wind Plains.</p><p>The heavenly wind Plains was extremely vast. Many people were standing in the air outside the plains.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other three stood at the back, not at all eye-catching.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>In the sky and wind plain, the wind was howling. Giant tornadoes swept across the sky and the earth. There were many of them, and they were densely packed. From a distance, it was a spectacular sight.</p><p>No one knew how these tornadoes were formed.</p><p>It seemed to have suddenly appeared 80000 years ago. Some people guessed that there had been a terrifying battle between experts here, and it was formed by the power of laws. Some people also guessed that it was formed because a large array had been set up inside.</p><p>There were many different opinions, and no one agreed on the answer.</p><p>But now, some of the tornadoes were actually moving, slowly moving towards the depths of the plains.</p><p>And as time passed, more and more tornadoes were moving in the same direction, towards the depths of the breezy Plains.</p><p>Slowly, the tornadoes on the heavenwind plain became less and less violent.</p><p>At this time, the cry of a Phoenix was heard again, and it seemed to be more clear.</p><p>“The heavenly wind has retreated, so something must have happened inside. There must be a treasure inside!”</p><p>in any forbidden land, opportunities and dangers co-exist. Now that the heavenly wind has retreated, it’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!</p><p>Many people were moved, revealing a fiery gaze.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Suddenly, someone moved. He rushed into the heavenly wind plain. He avoided the remaining tornadoes and quickly rushed into the depths of the heavenly wind plain.</p><p>Seeing that the man was fine, more and more people started to move. They kept rushing towards the Windy Plains and disappeared from everyone’s sight.</p><p>“Let’s go in and take a look!”</p><p>“If there’s any danger, it won’t be too late to retreat!”</p><p>More and more people rushed towards the sky and wind Plains.</p><p>Riches and honor were obtained from danger, and it was even more so for martial cultivators. One had to rely on themselves to grab opportunities.</p><p>As the rainbow light flickered, countless figures rushed into the sky wind Plains and disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming saw the people from the Yu Du sect, Yu Sheng from the deity sect, Mo Yang, and the others also rushing into the sky wind Plains.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Just what I wanted!”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Tian Chui and the rest also nodded their heads. They then stepped forward and rushed into the sky wind Plains.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>As soon as they rushed into the sky wind Plains, they felt the wind whistling like blades. They used their Zhen Yuan to protect themselves from the wind.</p><p>The four of them carefully avoided the tornadoes and rushed inside.</p><p>There were still many tornadoes left, and they were constantly moving, but they were not fast. There were many gaps, enough for them to pass through easily.</p><p>Very quickly, the three of them had flown over a thousand miles.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Not far away, there were people fighting. One of them was blown away and caught in a tornado. He let out a shrill scream. In the eyes of Lu Ming and the others, the man was crushed into pieces by the tornado.</p><p>“What a terrifying power!”</p><p>Tian Chui said as he licked his lips.</p><p>Lu Ming took out a ninth-level spiritual weapon and threw it at a tornado nearby. After the ninth-level spiritual weapon was sucked into the tornado, it was shattered into pieces within a few breaths by the terrifying wind.</p><p>The four of them became serious. The power of the tornado was terrifying. No wonder it was said that even Saints would be killed if they were caught in it.</p><p>The four of them continued to move forward. Along the way, they saw that the ground was flat and barren.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, he saw a branch being thrown out of a tornado.</p><p>“It’s Phoenix incense wood!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Their eyesight was extremely good. Even though they were still a distance away, they could clearly see that there was a Phoenix mark on the branch, which was the characteristic of the Phoenix-fragrance wood.</p><p>According to the villagers, the Phoenix-incense wood they had obtained was also blown from the heavenly wind Plains.</p><p>The four of them hurriedly rushed towards the Phoenix incense wood.</p><p>This section of Phoenix incense wood was three meters long and as thick as a human waist. It looked like a branch of a huge ancient tree.</p><p>haha, such a big piece. How many raw gemstones would it be worth? ”</p><p>Tian Chui laughed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Right at this moment, the sound of something breaking through the air was heard. Seven to eight figures appeared and surrounded the four of them.</p><p>“Put down the Phoenix-incense wood, and then get lost!”</p><p>A black-robed old man coldly shouted.</p><p>All of them were middle-aged or old men. They all had strong auras, and even the weakest of them was at Lv 8 Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>A few of them had even reached Lv 9 martial Royal realm!</p><p>“You’re telling us to scram? You’re the ones who should get lost. If you want to die, then come and try!”</p><p>A giant hammer appeared in Tian Chui’s hand as his eyes revealed a malevolent look.</p><p>“Stubborn! Kill!”</p><p>One of the black-robed men roared and took the lead, charging towards Tian Chui. A long spear pierced out, filling the sky with spear shadows that enveloped Tian Chui.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Tian Chui let out a loud roar as his giant hammer smashed towards his opponent.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The spear shadows that filled the sky disappeared, and the giant hammer directly struck the opponent’s body. With a loud bang, the opponent’s body was smashed flat, flying a few hundred meters away, without a trace of life.</p><p>He was killed in one move!</p><p>“Let’s join hands!”</p><p>The black-robed elder roared in anger. The aura of a peak Lv 9 martial Royal realm expert burst out, and a terrifying saber radiance slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>These people were obviously not present when Lu Ming and the rest fought with the heaven deity sect. They did not know Lu Ming and the rest. If they had seen that battle, they would not have attacked Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. His essential core surged into the flowing elemental gloves and he threw a punch.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The flowing essence gloves ‘weight had become shocking. Coupled with the chaos Domain and the prison suppressing heavenly art, its power was extremely terrifying. With a single punch, the other party’s blade light immediately dispersed. The fist momentum did not stop as it continued to punch towards the black-robed elder.</p><p>The black-robed old man’s expression changed drastically, and he used his saber to block in front of him.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s fist landed on the saber, causing it to explode. His fist did not stop and continued to land on the black-robed elder. The black-robed elder let out an indignant roar and his body exploded like his saber.</p><p>he’s only at the ninth level of the martial Royal realm, but he doesn’t even have a holy weapon. He’s so weak!</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
