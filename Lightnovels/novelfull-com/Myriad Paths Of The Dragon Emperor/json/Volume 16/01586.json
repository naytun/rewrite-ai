They arrived not long after they took the space-breaking shuttle.</p><p>As they approached Dragon God Valley, everyone got off the space-breaking shuttle and stepped into the dragon God Valley, heading towards Cloud Dragon Valley.</p><p>...</p><p>“Xiang Xiang, are you cold?”</p><p>Lu Ming turned to look at Xiangxiang. The little girl’s face was red from the cold.</p><p>“I’m not!”</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila shook her head. A layer of green radiance emanated from her body to resist the cold air outside.</p><p>Below them, the snow Mountain passed by their feet. Soon, they arrived at Cloud Dragon Valley.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, come to My Immortal’s cave!”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming and the rest stepped into Cloud Dragon Valley, the valley Master’s Voice rang in Lu Ming’s ears.</p><p>With the cloud Dragon Valley master’s realm, his spiritual sense covered the entire Cloud Dragon Valley. It wasn’t difficult for him to know that they had returned.</p><p>senior brother, Senior Sister, master is looking for me. I’ll go to master’s cave first!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>alright, then Junior Brother should go quickly. Let’s return to the cave dwelling first!</p><p>Xue ningxin said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He brought Xiangxiang Beila and headed towards the depths of Cloud Dragon Valley.</p><p>Soon, Lu Ming arrived at the cave abode of the cloud Dragon Valley master. The cloud Dragon Valley master was sitting cross-legged on a futon in the cave abode.</p><p>“Disciple Lu Ming greets master!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and bowed to the cloud Dragon Valley master.</p><p>“Grand-disciple Lu Xiangxiang pays her respects to grand-master!”</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang was very obedient. When she saw Lu Ming bow, she quickly followed suit.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master was slightly taken aback. He looked at Xiangxiang Beila and said, ” “Ming ‘er, is this your disciple?”</p><p>yes, this is the disciple I took in a year ago. I’ll need more guidance from master in the future!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master carefully sized up Xiangxiang Beila. Then, his eyes flickered, revealing a look of surprise.</p><p>Following that, the cloud Dragon Valley master’s eyes seemed to flash as he carefully stared at Xiangxiang Beila. The more he looked, the stronger the light in his eyes became. Finally, a look of shock flashed across his face.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, your disciple is amazing!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master exclaimed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He knew that the cloud Dragon Valley master could tell that Xiangxiang Beila was extraordinary.</p><p>“Little girl, come here and let Grandmaster take a good look!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said gently.</p><p>“Yes, master!”</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila walked over obediently to the side of the cloud Dragon Valley master.</p><p>hahaha, what a sensible girl. Well, little girl, your master may not have so much time to guide you. In the future, Grandmaster will guide you in your cultivation!</p><p>Cloud Dragon Valley rubbed Xiangxiang Beila’s little head and laughed.</p><p>“Many thanks, master!”</p><p>Lu Ming was also overjoyed. The cloud Dragon Valley master’s cultivation was much higher than his. It was unfathomable. Xiangxiang Beila’s guidance from him would be much better than his.</p><p>“Yes, Ming ‘er. You’ve been away for a year. How’s the removal of the killing intent in the depths of your soul?”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master’s tone changed.</p><p>“It’s already been cleaned up!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“That’s good. Ming ‘er, I have bad news for you. A few days ago, I received news that the deity of the Tian Shen sect has broken through to the sage realm!”</p><p>Cloud Dragon Valley said with a serious expression.</p><p>did the divine Son break through to the Saint realm? ”</p><p>Lu Ming raised his eyebrows.</p><p>Ming ‘er, there’s still a year and a half before the next treasure sealing assembly. In this year and a half, even if you cultivate with all your might, I’m afraid it’ll be difficult for you to catch up to the Divine Child. So, master will send you to a place where you might have a chance to fight for it!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said.</p><p>“Master, what is that place?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master had said a year ago that he would send him to a place and ask him to come back a year later. Lu Ming had always been very curious.</p><p>“That place is called the hundred tribe battlefield. It’s an extremely dangerous place, but it’s also a place filled with endless opportunities. Only by going there will you have a chance of fighting the divine Son in the next treasure fixing assembly. I’ll tell you the details when we arrive at the starting point.”</p><p>alright, take Xiangxiang out. Arrange her residence and show her around Cloud Dragon Valley. We’ll set off in three days!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and bade farewell to the cloud Dragon Valley master. He left the cave abode with Xiangxiang Beila.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming picked a cave abode near his and let Xiangxiang Beila stay in it.</p><p>Cloud Dragon Valley was huge and had many cave abodes. However, there were only about 100 people in the cave abode, so most of the cave abodes were empty.</p><p>Xiangxiang, if you have any questions about your cultivation during this period of time, you can ask me!</p><p>Lu Ming said to Xiangxiang.</p><p>“Yes, master, I have some questions to ask!”</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila nodded and began to ask all the questions that she had encountered during this period of time. Lu Ming patiently answered them one by one.</p><p>Half a day later, Xiangxiang Beila returned to her cave dwelling to cultivate in satisfaction.</p><p>Lu Ming appeared in the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>He was refining his second body and sitting cross-legged on a mountain peak in the mountain and river diagram. A stone plate was suspended above his head, emitting a vast and terrifying aura.</p><p>This stone plate was the Tai Chi stone plate that he had obtained from the heavenly wind Plains.</p><p>During this period of time, he had been studying the inscription secondary body.</p><p>In the end, he concluded that this was a formation disk, a terrifying formation disk. With the help of this formation disk, the Ming Lian secondary body had lit up two mental lamps in a short time.</p><p>Now, he had already lit up eight spirit lamps.</p><p>In the past year, his second body had been cultivating and had made great progress.</p><p>With the second body’s current cultivation, it was completely enough to communicate with the laws through inscriptions and try to use the power of the laws to enter the half-Saint realm.</p><p>However, Lu Ming would not do that now. Eight spirit lamps were too few. He needed to light ten spirit lamps before he would consider entering the half-Saint realm.</p><p>Lu Ming called this array disc the Tai Chi array disc.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>With a thought, golden mental energy fire spread out between the eyebrows of the minglian clone and poured into the Tai Chi formation disk. Instantly, the Tai Chi formation disk lit up, and a Tai Chi yin-yang diagram appeared, emitting a terrifying pressure.</p><p>The yin-yang Taiji diagram seemed to contain a terrifying power of killing and sealing.</p><p>It was very likely that this was a monarch weapon on the same level as the ancient Phoenix mirror. With the cultivation of the inscription secondary body, it was difficult for it to unleash even one ten-thousandth of the power of the Tai Chi formation disk.</p><p>Even so, Lu Ming felt that Ming Lian’s clone could easily kill a Lv 9 martial Royal realm expert or even an ordinary half-Saint by controlling the Tai Chi disk array.</p><p>Lu Ming’s face revealed a satisfied smile.</p><p>He had gained a lot from this trip to the Windy Plains.</p><p>Just this Tai Chi formation plate alone was a priceless treasure.</p><p>It would greatly increase Lu Ming’s combat strength and refine his second body, which would become Lu Ming’s strongest trump card.</p><p>After looking at it for a while, Lu Ming exited the mountain and river diagram and closed his eyes to cultivate.</p><p>Three days passed in the blink of an eye. Lu Ming told Xiangxiang to stay in Cloud Dragon Valley at ease while he went to the cave abode of the cloud Dragon Valley master once again.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, I will take you to the cloud Emperor mountain first. If you want to go to the hundred tribe battlefield, you must go from the cloud Emperor mountain!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master explained.</p><p>“Cloud Emperor mountain?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled. He had never heard of such a place in the Azure region.</p><p>the Cloud King Mountain is not located in the Azure continent. It is located in another continent near the Azure continent, called the cloud continent. The Cloud King Mountain is the most powerful force in the cloud continent, and it is guarded by a monarch level expert!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master continued to explain.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
