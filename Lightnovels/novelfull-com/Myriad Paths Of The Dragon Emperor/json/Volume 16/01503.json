After all, this is a grand event that happens once every three years in the Azure continent. At that time, some of the top geniuses of the Azure continent will appear. To be able to see these people fight will be very helpful to one’s own cultivation.</p><p>“And the top ten geniuses of the Azure continent’s younger generation will all be gathered here!”</p><p>...</p><p>Xue ning said in her heart. At the end of her sentence, her eyes revealed a look of yearning.</p><p>“The top ten demon-level geniuses of the Azure continent?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>The top ten geniuses of the Azure continent were the top ten geniuses among the younger generation of the Azure continent. It was said that each of them had reached the peak of the Martial Emperor realm, and their combat strength was astonishing.</p><p>It was said that the number one person among the younger generation in Dragon God Valley was one of the top ten geniuses.</p><p>then let’s go. I want to see it too. Three years ago, I missed it because of my cultivation. This time, I can’t miss it!</p><p>Tian Chui said.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Xue ningxin both nodded.</p><p>The three of them flew out of the cloud Dragon Valley. When they were out of the Dragon God Valley, Tian Chui waved his hand and a flying shuttle appeared. It grew in the wind and became dozens of meters long.</p><p>The journey to the Cang mountains was quite far, and it was best to take the space-breaking flying shuttle.</p><p>The three of them entered the shuttle.</p><p>The interior of the flying shuttle was very spacious and there were inscriptions on it. There was also a piece of crystal glass in front that could reflect the scene outside.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Tian Chui lightly shouted, activating the space-breaking shuttle.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The flying shuttle broke through the air at an astonishing speed. Looking out through the crystal glass, one could see Endless mountains and rivers passing behind.</p><p>“It’s really comfortable to have a space-breaking flying shuttle!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart.</p><p>As long as he activated the space-breaking flying shuttle with a rough stone, he could ignore it. However, it was very convenient to cultivate while traveling.</p><p>Lu Ming had long wanted to buy one but the price of the space-breaking flying shuttle was extremely high. He could not even afford the lowest-grade space-breaking flying shuttle now.</p><p>Little Junior Brother, this trip to the Cang mountains will take more than half a month, even if you take the space-breaking flying shuttle. You can cultivate here!</p><p>Tian Chui said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. The three of them each chose a seat and sat cross-legged.</p><p>Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, seven days had passed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, the space-breaking flying shuttle started to shake violently, and it stopped.</p><p>Someone was attacking the shuttle!</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two were shocked. They quickly ended their cultivation and looked out through the crystal glass.</p><p>There were more than a dozen figures standing in front of them, looking at them with cold eyes.</p><p>There were more than a dozen figures, including an old man and a middle-aged man. They were all wearing black robes and had fierce expressions.</p><p>“Damn it, you dare to attack my space-breaking flying shuttle, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>Tian Chui roared as he opened the door of the flying shuttle and rushed out.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xue ningxin quickly followed him out.</p><p>“Who is attacking my space-breaking flying shuttle? you’re looking for death!”</p><p>Tian Chui furiously roared as his Savage gaze swept across the dozen over people.</p><p>“So it’s just a few little kids and girls. Haha, our luck is pretty good. Now, hand over the space-breaking flying shuttle and get lost!”</p><p>One of the burly men shouted.</p><p>So it was to snatch the space-breaking flying shuttle.</p><p>“You want to steal my space-breaking flying shuttle?”</p><p>Tian Chui’s eyes were cold as he stared at the large man.</p><p>“Nonsense, didn’t you hear what I said? Get out of here and leave your storage rings behind. Otherwise, I’ll take your lives here!”</p><p>The burly man shouted coldly, and a powerful aura emanated from his body.</p><p>Seventh level Martial Emperor realm!</p><p>This burly man was a Lv 7 martial Royal realm expert. No wonder he didn’t take them seriously.</p><p>The dozen or so people behind the burly man were not weak either. They were all at least at the LV 4 martial Royal realm.</p><p>“Boss, why are you talking to them? just kill her. That girl is not bad. Let us enjoy her!”</p><p>Behind the burly man, a thin middle-aged man’s eyes were filled with killing intent. He ruthlessly looked at Xue ningxin.</p><p>you’re looking for death. Junior Brother and Junior Sister, leave this guy to me and leave the rest to you!</p><p>Tian Chui said. With that, a huge hammer appeared in his hand as he walked towards the large man with a ferocious look.</p><p>you’re only at the fifth level of the martial Royal realm. If you want to die, I’ll grant you your wish!</p><p>A large blade appeared in the man’s hand, and he took a step forward, appearing above Tian Chui’s head, and swung his blade at Tian Chui.</p><p>“You’re the one who’s going to die!”</p><p>Tian Chui roared in anger, his giant hammer smashing towards his opponent.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The giant hammer and the saber collided with a huge boom. The burly man’s body shook violently. With a muffled groan, his body was sent flying and slid in the air for hundreds of meters.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>The burly man roared in disbelief.</p><p>The other party was only at the LV 5 martial Royal realm, but he was able to send him flying with just one hammer strike. He even felt his arm tremble and almost spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Two months ago, Tian Chui was already able to suppress Mao ding on the floating platform, and even though they were both at the 7th level of the Martial Emperor realm, Mao ding was clearly stronger than this burly man. Furthermore, Tian Chui’s domain had broken through to the 7th level, so he was much stronger than this burly man.</p><p>this is all you’ve got? I haven’t even used half of my strength. Die!</p><p>Tian Chui carried his huge hammer and charged towards the large man.</p><p>“Let’s go together!”</p><p>The burly man roared.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Immediately, the other dozen or so people also exploded with energy and charged at Tian Chui.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Xue ningxin took a step forward and appeared in front of a Lv 6 martial Royal realm expert. She threw out a punch. The delicate fist destroyed all defenses as if it was a piece of rotten wood. The expert was directly blown apart.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming also rushed out.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>A long spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hand. With a shake of the spear, seven to eight spearlights were shot out. Each spearlight had the explosive power of ten different attacks.</p><p>It was unstoppable, unstoppable!</p><p>Seven to eight powerhouses, no matter if they were at the fourth, fifth, or sixth level martial Royal realm, were all pierced by Lu Ming’s spear ray and died in the air.</p><p>“Devour!”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s left palm clenched into a fist in the air. A terrifying devouring force erupted and enveloped the corpses. Their blood, true vitality, and other things were all devoured by Lu Ming, turning them into mummies that fell to the ground.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s current cultivation was still at the third level Martial Emperor realm, his domain had broken through to the fourth level. In addition to the astonishing attack power of the thirteen storing power strikes, it was easy for him to kill an ordinary sixth level Martial Emperor.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the devouring power and continued to refine the energy in his body. His cultivation level was rapidly increasing.</p><p>During this period of time, he had been focused on cultivating the chaos Domain and was about to reach the peak of level four. Thus, there was no resistance in increasing his cultivation.</p><p>While Lu Ming was refining, Xue ningxin had also finished her battle. The rest of the people were killed by Xue ningxin.</p><p>“What powerful battle strength!”</p><p>Xue ningxin’s cultivation was also at the peak of the LV 5 martial Royal realm, but her combat strength was so amazing that she could kill an ordinary Lv 6 martial Royal realm expert as easily as cutting vegetables.</p><p>“I can’t waste it!”</p><p>Lu Ming unleashed his devouring power and devoured all the blood essence of the people Xue ningxin had killed.</p><p>Xue ningxin glanced at Lu Ming, surprised by the overbearing power of his devouring power.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
