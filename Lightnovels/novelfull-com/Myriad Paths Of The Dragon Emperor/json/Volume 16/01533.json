Isn’t the heavenly God sect very arrogant? This is how you kill!”</p><p>...</p><p>“Lu Ming is invincible!”</p><p>Many people shouted.</p><p>Especially Qiu Ying Ying, Qiu Hao, and those who were close to Lu Ming, they were so excited that their faces turned red.</p><p>Previously, so many people of Dragon God Valley had been killed. The disciples of Dragon God Valley were furious and aggrieved. They had nowhere to vent their anger.</p><p>Now, he had completely vented it out.</p><p>A heaven’s favorite with an upper-class earth spiritual body was worth more than all the disciples of Dragon God Valley who had been killed.</p><p>There were only three heaven’s pride experts from the heavenly God sect who had participated in this small meeting. One of them had died all of a sudden, which was a heavy loss.</p><p>“You’re just a piece of trash!”</p><p>let’s go! Lu Ming said coldly in the fighting ring. He put Bai Mo’s storage ring away.</p><p>“Ah, Lu Ming, I’ll kill you!”</p><p>“You’re dead!”</p><p>Some of the heaven’s pride experts of the heavenly God sect, who were at the LV 7 martial Royal realm and above, roared in anger.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Disciples below the seventh rank can’t do it. Do you want to make a move?”</p><p>On the grandstand of Dragon God Valley, the disciples of the seventh rank and above said coldly, which made the faces of the disciples of the tianshen sect even more unsightly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, your combat strength has already reached this level?”</p><p>In the stands of the heavenly God sect, Zi Wuji spoke as he clenched his fists tightly.</p><p>Ji hongchen of Eden was sitting beside him.</p><p>They were all from the divine Ruins ‘continent group. A few years ago, they had even competed with Lu Ming, but now, Lu Ming had completely surpassed them.</p><p>Eden was the strongest among them, but he was only at Lv 2 martial Royal realm.</p><p>As for Zi Wuji and Ji hongchen, they were still stuck at the peak of the first level Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>In Eden, Ji hongchen’s face was also filled with complicated emotions.</p><p>“Zi Wuji, Ji hongchen, after this competition ends, I plan to leave the heaven deity sect and go out to temper myself. What about you two?”</p><p>Eden transmitted his voice to Zi Wuji and Ji hongchen.</p><p>In the past, the three of them did not have a good relationship in the continent of the divine Ruins. They were even competitors. However, after coming to the yuan continent, the three of them became very close. After all, they came from the same place.</p><p>“You want to leave the Tian Shen sect? With your current cultivation, it’s very dangerous for you to leave the sect and go out!”</p><p>Zi Wuji’s expression changed.</p><p>“Only danger has the value of training. If I die on the path of training, I can only blame myself for not being skilled enough. However, if we stay in the deity sect, outsiders like us will not be able to receive any good training. We are no different from handymen. We will never be able to catch up to Lu Ming’s footsteps!”</p><p>Yidian said, as if he had made a decision.</p><p>“I’ll go with you!”</p><p>Ji Hong Chen said after a moment of silence.</p><p>After Zi Wuji’s expression changed for a while, he gritted his teeth and said, ” “I’ll continue to stay in the Tian Shen sect!”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Eden nodded. Everyone had their own ambitions, and he would not force them.</p><p>On the fighting ring, Lu Ming kept the storage ring and returned to the tenth platform in a flash.</p><p>“Lu Ming, well done! Haha!”</p><p>Tian Chui laughed.</p><p>Xue ningxin and han Xun also smiled.</p><p>The disciples of the tianshen sect flew down from the fighting ring and collected Bai Mo’s body. The competition continued.</p><p>Soon, this round was over, and a new round began.</p><p>It was the turn of the Tian Shen sect to challenge again. The leader of the Tian Shen sect cast a cold glance at Lu Ming and the rest. However, in the end, he still sent people to continue challenging the poyuan family.</p><p>Now, they could only endure.</p><p>Now, they had already lost a top-notch powerhouse and their strength had been greatly reduced. They did not dare to fight with Dragon God Valley now. They were afraid that they would not be able to make it into the top ten.</p><p>After the deity sect, the Tianyu demon sect and the Yudu sect followed the deity sect’s footsteps and dealt with the poyuan family.</p><p>When it was Dragon God Valley’s turn, Tian Chui challenged them and killed a sixth-level fighter.</p><p>Just like that, a few rounds passed.</p><p>The first sect to be eliminated had finally emerged.</p><p>The poyuan family had been eliminated in advance by the combined forces of the deity sect, the Tianyu demonic sect, and the Yu Du sect.</p><p>Now, there were only twelve sects left.</p><p>The competition continued. It was Lu Ming’s turn to challenge someone. This time, he did not challenge the opponent’s top powerhouse. Instead, he chose a weaker opponent.</p><p>The competition went on round by round.</p><p>The atmosphere was getting more and more depressing.</p><p>The faces of everyone in the heavenly God sect also became uglier and uglier.</p><p>Every round, they would lose one of their heaven’s favorites to Dragon God Valley.</p><p>Those who were selected to participate in the small meeting were all top heaven’s pride experts. The loss of each of them would make the Tian Shen sect feel heartache. But now, they were being killed one after another.</p><p>When the nineteenth round ended, the Tian Shen sect only had sixteen people left. The losses were beyond imagination.</p><p>There were still four people from Dragon God Valley.</p><p>At this moment, another two weaker sects were eliminated. Finally, there were only ten sects left on the scene.</p><p>These ten sects were equivalent to obtaining the qualifications for the treasure fixing assembly.</p><p>The twentieth round began and it was the tianshen sect’s turn to challenge.</p><p>“Brother Wu, brother mo, it’s time to eliminate Dragon God Valley!”</p><p>The leader of the heavenly God sect’s team had a very cold look in his eyes. His tone was filled with endless coldness.</p><p>“Good, just what I want!”</p><p>In the Tian Yu demon sect, the cold light in mo he’s eyes was especially intense.</p><p>“I’ve been waiting for this moment!”</p><p>From the Yu Du sect, Wu Qian DU’s eyes were filled with cold killing intent. Poisonous insects crawled out of his body and swam around him.</p><p>“Brother Wang, how about we work together and eliminate Dragon God Valley?”</p><p>The leader of the heavenly God sect team looked at the leader of the jiuxiao sword sect.</p><p>Jiuxiao sword sect had a good relationship with tianshen sect. On the contrary, they were not on good terms with Dragon God Valley. He wanted to get jiuxiao sword sect to deal with Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>The jiuxiao sword sect leader’s eyes flickered as he looked in the direction of Dragon God Valley with a hint of fear. “I won’t get involved in your business!”</p><p>He didn’t want to get involved in the conflict between the tianshen sect, the Tianyu demonic sect, and the Yudu sect. Moreover, Dragon God Valley wasn’t an easy bone to chew.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Jiuxiao sword sect’s refusal made the leader of the heavenly God sect’s face darken.</p><p>hey, are you guys going to challenge me or not? don’t waste time!</p><p>Tian Chui carried his huge hammer on his shoulder as he looked towards the direction of the Tian Shen sect and berated.</p><p>since you’re so eager to die, I’ll fulfill your wish. Luan Ying, you’re up for this round!</p><p>The leader of the heavenly God sect said to a figure who was wrapped in a black robe.</p><p>“I’ve been waiting for this moment!”</p><p>The black-robed figure spoke coldly, causing the hearts of many disciples of the heavenly God sect to tremble.</p><p>They knew very well how terrifying these black-robed figures and Luan Ying were.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A shadow flickered, and Luan Ying appeared on the fighting ring. Many of those with weaker cultivation didn’t even see how he had appeared on the fighting ring.</p><p>“You, come down!”</p><p>Within the black robes, a pair of cold eyes stared at Tian Chui as a cold voice sounded out.</p><p>“Haha, it’s finally my turn!”</p><p>Tian Chui grinned and laughed.</p><p>“Tian Chui, you have to be careful. This person is one of the three high rank earth spiritual bodies in the Tian Shen sect, and he is good at assassination!”</p><p>Han Xun warned with a serious expression.</p><p>don’t worry. No matter what he’s good at, I’ll smash him to pieces with my hammer!</p><p>Tian Chui grinned.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
