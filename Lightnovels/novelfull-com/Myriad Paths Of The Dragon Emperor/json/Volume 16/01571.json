Are you trying to go against my desire poison sect?”</p><p>The members of the desire poison sect all roared in anger.</p><p>However, Xie nianqing’s face was cold. A Black Lotus floated above his head and pressed down. Some of the Yu Du sect’s powerhouses spat out blood and retreated.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s cultivation had already reached the peak of Lv 7 martial Royal realm. His progress was amazing.</p><p>The Black Lotus was clearly a holy weapon.</p><p>Although the other members of the Tian Yu demonic sect didn’t want to attack, they could only obey the saint’s orders.</p><p>Mo Yang stood not far away, his face cold. He did not make a move, but the experts from the desire poison sect were terrified.</p><p>Mo Yang was one of the top ten geniuses of the Cang Prefecture. His cultivation had long broken through to the half-Saint realm. If he were to attack, they would be in danger.</p><p>“Retreat, retreat first!”</p><p>The Yu Du sect’s expert roared. He began to defend while retreating, no longer having the heart to fight.</p><p>Meanwhile, Lu Ming had already unleashed his black wings and charged towards the tianshen sect. His Black Dragon Spear had grown to a thousand meters long. He struck out with the spear and sent a holy weapon flying. At the same time, the Black Dragon Spear stabbed out like lightning, killing an expert at the peak of the eighth level martial Royal realm.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Then, the black wings slashed out like blades, killing a Lv 7 martial Royal realm and a Lv 8 martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>As for Tian Chui and Xue ningxin, they also displayed their godly might.</p><p>Tian Chui’s giant hammer was now a Saint weapon, and every swing of his hammer was extremely powerful. Even a Saint weapon would be knocked away by his hammer, and with a single swing, it would be either dead or injured.</p><p>Xue ningxin, on the other hand, was controlling a seven-colored holy weapon, which was also very powerful.</p><p>Although there were only three of them, Lu Ming and the rest had suppressed the many experts of the heavenly God sect. People were being killed continuously.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>In the end, Yu Sheng let out a loud roar and took the rest of the people with him. They turned around and fled at top speed, leaving more than 20 corpses behind.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two didn’t pursue them. The remaining people were at the ninth level of the martial Royal realm and had holy weapons. They were determined to escape, so it wouldn’t be easy to kill them.</p><p>hahaha, Junior Brother, so you’re here. You’ve disappeared without a trace this year, and I haven’t heard any news about you!</p><p>Tian Chui put away his giant hammer and gave Lu Ming a heavy Pat, laughing out loud.</p><p>I was about to return to Dragon God Valley. I didn’t expect to meet my senior brothers and sisters here!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled as well. His body changed into his original appearance.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s cold voice was heard as he stepped into the air. Like a demoness, he attracted everyone’s attention.</p><p>she’s so beautiful. Is she the Saint of the Tianyu demonic sect? ”</p><p>I think so. I heard that the sect master of the Tian Yu demon sect took in a new saintess as a disciple and trained her with all his might!</p><p>Some people were discussing.</p><p>“Little Qing!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. The two of them looked at each other affectionately. Everything was conveyed without words.</p><p>Tian Chui’s gaze fell on Lu Ming and Xie nianqing. He grinned. haha, Junior Brother, this must be your sister-in-law. She’s really beautiful. She’s the golden boy and Jade girl with you, a match made in heaven!</p><p>Junior brother, sister-in-law is so beautiful. Why didn’t you introduce her to us? you must be punished!</p><p>Xue ningxin also joked.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and began to introduce them. Xie nianqing also politely bowed to Tian Chui and Xue ningxin, making them extremely happy.</p><p>“Junior Sister, let’s leave this place first. They have killed so many people of the heavenly God sect. The heavenly God sect will not let this matter rest. We must not get involved!”</p><p>At this moment, a discordant voice was heard. Mo Yang walked over with a cold expression. When he looked at Lu Ming, a hint of killing intent flashed in his eyes.</p><p>you guys can leave first. I want to be with Lu Ming!</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“Junior Sister, you …”</p><p>Mo Yang’s expression turned even colder. He looked at Lu Ming with intense jealousy, and the killing intent in the depths of his eyes turned even colder.</p><p>When Xie nianqing first joined the Tianyu demon sect, Mo Yang had been in seclusion. He only came out when the treasure auction was about to begin. When he saw Xie nianqing, he was instantly shocked. She was his Junior Sister, and in his heart, Xie nianqing was already his woman.</p><p>When he heard that Xie nianqing had a boyfriend, he was filled with jealousy and killing intent.</p><p>Therefore, back then at Cang Mountain, that was why he would make a move to stop Zi Feng.</p><p>“Junior Sister, this place is not safe. It’s more suitable for me to stay with you!”</p><p>Mo Yang’s eyes flickered as he spoke.</p><p>This made Xie nianqing frown.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with killing intent.</p><p>How could Lu Ming not see through Mo Yang’s thoughts?</p><p>sister-in-law has already let some people go. Some people are really thick-skinned and insist on following her shamelessly. Aren’t they ashamed? ”</p><p>Tian Chui sneered.</p><p>“What did you just say?”</p><p>Mo Yang said with a dark expression.</p><p>“What did I say? someone knows what I’m talking about!”</p><p>Tian Chui curled his lips.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Mo Yang snorted coldly. He looked at Xie nianqing and said, ” Junior Sister, you have to think this through. Our Tianyu demon sect and Dragon God Valley are, after all, different sects. Moreover, Lu Ming has challenged the divine Son. In a year and a half, he will definitely be killed by the divine Son. He won’t live for long. It’s not too late for you to leave him now!</p><p>“Mo Yang!”</p><p>Xie nianqing snorted coldly, his face was unusually cold, ” “Let me tell you, one and a half years later, Lu Ming won’t die. The one who will die will be the divine Son. Also, I only respect you because you’re my senior brother. If anyone else had said such words, I would have already taken action. Now, please leave. Otherwise, don’t blame me for falling out with you!”</p><p>“Junior Sister, you …”</p><p>Mo Yang’s expression was extremely unsightly. In the end, he gave Lu Ming a cold and gloomy look, then turned around and left.</p><p>The other members of the Tian Yu demonic sect also left with Mo Yang.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m sorry!”</p><p>Xie nianqing looked at Lu Ming apologetically.</p><p>haha, you and I don’t need to say such things. Besides, this shows that you are very charming. If such a charming beauty likes me, I will have a greater sense of achievement!</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“You’re so smug!”</p><p>Xie nianqing also smiled.</p><p>“Oh right, little Qing, why are you here?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>The Tian Yu demonic sect and the Dragon God Valley were neighbors, but they were far from the Western part of the Azure continent. Why would Xie nianqing and the others be here? Even if they had heard the news and wanted to rush over, they wouldn’t have been able to do it so quickly.</p><p>Mo Yang and I, as well as other people from the Tian Yu demonic sect, were hunting down a traitor of the Tian Yu demonic sect. We happened to be in the vicinity, and we heard the news, so we rushed over to take a look!</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming went to ask the sky hammer and Xue ningxin. It turned out that the two of them were adventuring outside and had just arrived in the West of Cangzhou. After hearing the news, they had rushed over to watch.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
