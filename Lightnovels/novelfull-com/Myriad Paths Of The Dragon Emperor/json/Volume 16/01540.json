Mo he felt that the demonic Qi in his body was constantly being devoured by Lu Ming, causing his demonic Qi to be even more unsustainable.</p><p>“Seal!”</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming cast the sealing gates again. The six sealing gates glowed and suppressed the demonic god. This time, the demonic god finally could not break through the sealing gates in a short time and its movements became stiff.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming seized the opportunity. His long spear turned into a huge spearlight and smashed heavily on the Asmodian Lord’s head. Thirteen forces instantly stacked and exploded.</p><p>die! mo he roared. The demon God’s head exploded, and then his body exploded.</p><p>In an instant, the demon God exploded.</p><p>Mo he’s body trembled and he spat out a mouthful of blood. His face was pale.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>Mo he gritted his teeth and flew backward. He knew that he had lost today. He was no match for Lu Ming. Now, he had to rush down the fighting ring.</p><p>“You can’t escape, Feng!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. Six sealing gates appeared in front of mo he, blocking his way.</p><p>Mo he’s demonic blade slashed out continuously, but it couldn’t break the barrier of the door seal.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had already put away his spear. He was holding a huge seal in one of his palms.</p><p>Primal Chaos sky-turning seal!</p><p>Now, the chaos sky-turning seal had been cultivated by Lu Ming to the peak of the third level. While its power was getting stronger, he was also getting more skilled in using it.</p><p>When he used the chaos sky-turning seal, he didn’t need to use it all at once to the maximum, as it would consume a terrifying amount of true essence.</p><p>Now, he could control the power of the chaos sky-turning seal. By reducing the power of the chaos sky-turning seal, he could save a lot of genuine Yuan and control it more easily.</p><p>For example, the seal in Lu Ming’s hand was the chaos sky-turning seal that he had condensed. It was about 50% of its power when Lu Ming used his full strength. However, if Lu Ming used his full strength, it was impossible for him to hold it in his palm and control it to such an extent.</p><p>It was much more convenient for Lu Ming to control 50% of its power.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and the chaos sky-turning seal smashed at mo he.</p><p>The attack power of 50% of the full power was also terrifyingly powerful. It exceeded the power of Lu Ming’s [ storing power thirteen strikes ].</p><p>The primal Chaos sky-turning seal smashed towards mo he like an ancient divine mountain. Its vast power and astonishing aura made mo he’s expression change drastically.</p><p>Mo he roared and turned around to block. He kept slashing out with his demonic blade, hoping to block it.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>When the splitting devil saber slashed on the chaos sky-turning seal, not only did it not split the chaos sky-turning seal, but the devil saber itself was directly crushed by the chaos sky-turning seal.</p><p>The primal Chaos sky-turning seal continued to descend.</p><p>In the end, mo he used his demonic blade to block in front of him. An Emperor-level spiritual weapon armor appeared on his body, and together with his territory, he blocked in front of him.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The primal Chaos sky-turning seal struck down heavily.</p><p>Mo he’s body trembled violently and he retreated frantically. His face was pale and he spat out a large mouthful of blood. His hands that were holding the blade were trembling non-stop. The bone armor on his wrist was broken.</p><p>Only by paying such a heavy price could it block the chaos sky-turning seal.</p><p>However, a loud rumbling sound came from above, and another chaos sky-turning stamp came crashing down.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Mo he roared and exerted all his strength to defend with all his might.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>This time, mo he knelt on the ground and spurted blood. His arms exploded and his demonic blade flew far away.</p><p>Even with the protection of the Emperor spiritual weapon, his body couldn’t withstand all the power. The terrifying power shattered many of mo he’s bones.</p><p>However, to mo he’s despair, the third chaos sky-turning seal pressed down on him with a loud rumble in the sky.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>This time, mo he let out a desperate roar.</p><p>This time, he definitely couldn’t resist it. If he couldn’t resist it, he would die!</p><p>“Come out!”</p><p>die! mo he roared. A small black Pagoda flew out from his brow, and a vast aura spread out.</p><p>A holy weapon!</p><p>This small Pagoda was a holy weapon.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Saint weapon expanded rapidly and collided with the chaotic sky-turning stamp.</p><p>The small black Tower was sent flying. Mo he spat out blood again and rolled on the fighting ring, leaving a pool of blood on the ground.</p><p>“He’s breaking the rules! He’s breaking the rules! He’s using a holy weapon!”</p><p>“Use your Saint weapon and kill without mercy!”</p><p>The disciples of Dragon God Valley roared in anger.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the pavilion behind Dragon God Valley, the elder of Dragon God Valley stepped out in the air. His eyes were cold as he said, ” “Those who use Saint weapons without permission on the stage will be killed without mercy!”</p><p>The Saint realm elder struck out with his palm, and a huge palm print pressed toward mo he.</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>An elder rushed out of the pavilion behind the Tianyu demon sect. He struck out with his palm, and a blade light slashed out, shattering the palm print of the Saint realm elder of Dragon God Valley.</p><p>The Saint realm elder of Dragon God Valley looked coldly at the Saint realm elder of the Tianyu demon sect and said, ” “Before the battle began, I already announced that anyone who uses a Saint weapon on the stage will be killed without mercy. You want to stop me?”</p><p>“Elder, elder, save me!”</p><p>Mo he shouted in fear.</p><p>The Saint realm elder of the Tian Yu demon sect frowned and said, ” “How about we let him off this time?”</p><p>“Spare him? You can ask the fellow Daoists from the other sects if they agree!”</p><p>The Saint realm elder of Dragon God Valley sneered.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Figures stepped out of the buildings. They were the Saint realm elders of the 13 sects.</p><p>the rules that have been passed down for tens of thousands of years must not be broken. Since you have violated them, kill!</p><p>The elder of the life-and-death Sword sect was the first to speak, his killing intent cold.</p><p>“That’s right. If everyone uses their Saint weapons, what’s the point? How could one tell the strength of the younger generation? wouldn’t it just be a matter of how many Saint weapons one had? Therefore, he must be killed!”</p><p>The elder of the demon Castle continued.</p><p>“I agree. We must kill him. If he didn’t use his Saint weapon, he would have already been killed.”</p><p>“I agree!”</p><p>The elders of the other sects chimed in one after another, causing mo he to be filled with despair.</p><p>Only the elders of the heavenly God sect and the Yu Du sect did not speak. Their expressions were rather unsightly.</p><p>“No, I don’t want to die!”</p><p>Mo he roared and turned into a ray of demonic light, rushing into the distance.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The Saint realm elder of Dragon God Valley roared, and a terrible sound wave rushed toward mo he. Mo he’s body exploded in the air, and even the small Saint weapon tower had no effect.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled. Was this the combat strength of a sage realm elder? he didn’t even make a move. He only shouted and killed mo he.</p><p>After killing mo he, the elder of the Dragon God Valley reached out and grabbed mo he’s holy weapon Pagoda. Then, he waved his hand and the Holy weapon Pagoda flew toward Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
