Her big eyes were filled with fear but were also filled with innocence as she looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>...</p><p>At the sight of this pair of eyes, Lu Ming suddenly stopped.</p><p>This pair of frightened and innocent eyes seemed to have touched Lu Ming’s heartstrings. Lu Ming’s rationality, which had been completely drowned by the murderous intent, recovered a little.</p><p>“No, no, I can’t kill innocent people!”</p><p>The little bit of rationality he had left roared.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>There was even more boundless killing intent. Loud roars rang in Lu Ming’s mind, urging him to slaughter the world.</p><p>“Don’t kill my mother!”</p><p>The little girl was very scared. She hugged the young girl tightly and looked at Lu Ming with her big eyes. She spoke in a trembling voice.</p><p>“No, I can’t kill him! I can’t kill him!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared in his heart. His face turned extremely ferocious.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming let out a terrifying howl and his figure soared into the sky. He flew frantically into the distance and disappeared without a trace in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“Xiangxiang …”</p><p>The young woman hugged the young girl, her tears falling like rain, her whole body trembling in fear.</p><p>Lu Ming roared as he flapped his black wings frantically. At this moment, the only trace of rationality left in his heart was engaged in an intense battle with the endless killing intent.</p><p>Not far away, a white light flashed and bubbles appeared. They looked at Lu Ming worriedly.</p><p>“Bubbles … Leave, quickly leave!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared. He was afraid that if he lost control, he would even kill bubbles.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>Bubbles shook her head and looked at Lu Ming from afar.</p><p>Lu Ming roared and continued to fly forward.</p><p>He felt that he couldn’t control himself anymore. The endless killing intent was about to drown his rationality again. He was about to turn back into a killing machine.</p><p>He was unwilling, but the endless killing intent was too strong, and it kept attacking his rationality.</p><p>At this moment, he only wanted to kill, kill all the living beings in the world.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming was like a black lightning bolt, flying across the sky.</p><p>After flying for an unknown distance, a huge forest appeared before Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>In the forest, the ferocious beasts roared and were full of vitality.</p><p>Kill!</p><p>Lu Ming could no longer control himself. He rushed into the forest and tore a seventh grade Emperor Tiger into two.</p><p>Lu Ming’s killing intent grew even stronger as he bathed in blood. His last shred of rationality was once again drowned by the killing intent. All that was left was to kill.</p><p>Lu Ming was hunting the ferocious beasts in the forest crazily.</p><p>One by one, the powerful beasts died at Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A half-Saint giant bear tried to slap Lu Ming. However, Lu Ming punched through the bear’s palm and cut off its head with his black wings.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s strength was so powerful that he could kill a half-Saint instantly.</p><p>One by one, the ferocious beasts in this huge forest fell to the ground.</p><p>Lu Ming was bathed in blood and had killed countless ferocious beasts.</p><p>At this moment, a gentle-looking elder suddenly appeared in the sky above the forest.</p><p>This elder was actually Lu Ming’s master, the cloud Dragon Valley master.</p><p>“Ming ‘er!”</p><p>Even the cloud Dragon Valley master’s eyes flashed with shock when he saw Lu Ming.</p><p>“What kind of power is this? Bloodline?”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master frowned.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>At that moment, bubbles appeared not far from the cloud Dragon Valley master. He waved his little claws, cried out, and gestured non-stop.</p><p>“Space-time spirit mouse!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master’s eyes revealed a hint of shock as he muttered, ” Ming ‘er is really lucky. Even the space-time spirit mouse is with him. But sometimes, the more lucky you are, the deeper your tribulation will be. It’s really difficult!</p><p>With that, the cloud Dragon Valley master turned to bubbles and said, ” “Don’t worry, I won’t let anything happen to Ming ‘er!”</p><p>With that, he took a step forward and walked toward Lu Ming.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming had also discovered the cloud Dragon Valley master. His eyes burst with a shocking killing intent. With a loud roar, he charged at the cloud Dragon Valley master.</p><p>With a flap of his black wings, he brought with him a violent gust of wind as he slashed at the cloud Dragon Valley master.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master’s expression was gentle. He pointed his finger like a sword and sliced it slightly. A beam of sword Qi appeared and slashed at the black wings. The black wings were blocked, but Lu Ming roared and punched at the cloud Dragon Valley master.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, wake up!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master shouted, and the sound waves surged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming felt as if he had been struck by lightning. His body was sent flying and his head was buzzing.</p><p>“I’ll give you strength!”</p><p>At this moment, the voice from the third bloodline rang out in Lu Ming’s mind again. An even stronger force surged into Lu Ming’s body, making him look even more ferocious and full of killing intent.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step in the void and charged madly at the cloud Dragon Valley master.</p><p>the power of the bloodline. What kind of bloodline is this? it’s so strange.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master frowned. With a wave of his hand, a huge palm appeared in the air and pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long hiss. A blood-red light burst forth from his body and rushed toward the large hand.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming was crushed by the huge hand and his body was sent flying. He crashed into the ground and created a huge pit.</p><p>The giant hand trembled and then cracked.</p><p>“What powerful strength!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master murmured as his vital essence surged. A mysterious force was controlled by the cloud Dragon Valley master, forming a huge claw that grabbed at Lu Ming.</p><p>That was the power of the laws!</p><p>This time, the huge claw contained the power of laws.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming roared and rushed out of the crater. The blood-red light around him almost materialized and blasted towards the cloud Dragon Valley master’s hand.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Heaven and earth trembled and invisible waves of air swept in all directions. The giant trees within hundreds of miles were swept away and exploded.</p><p>This level of destructive power was already extremely shocking. One had to know that this was the yuan continent, not the divine wilderness.</p><p>If this was in the divine wilderness continent, this power would have caused the ground to crack and split open for millions of miles.</p><p>Lu Ming was sent flying once again. The huge hand only trembled a little but did not dissipate. It continued to move toward Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming rushed forward again. His body had cracked due to the influx of too much power into his third Blood Meridian, and blood was flowing out continuously.</p><p>After all, there was a limit to the strength of Lu Ming’s body. He had already endured too much power and could not channel more power. Otherwise, his body would collapse.</p><p>Lu Ming threw another punch at the giant palm. He was sent flying again, but this time, a second palm formed behind him and grabbed him.</p><p>Lu Ming roared and struggled with all his might, trying to break free from the palm.</p><p>“Suppress!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master murmured. He clenched his fist in the air and burst with power, grabbing Lu Ming tightly. No matter how Lu Ming struggled, he could not break free.</p><p>His cultivation was far inferior to the cloud Dragon Valley master’s.</p><p>“Ice seal!” The cloud Dragon Valley master continued to speak. A terrifying cold air emanated from his palm, and Lu Ming’s body was immediately covered in a layer of ice.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
