Lu Ming had killed two and Luo Xiang had killed one.</p><p>“Damn it, this Lu Ming, damn it!”</p><p>Someone in the heavenly Divine sect shouted angrily.</p><p>There were not many heaven’s favorites with medium-grade earth spiritual body in the tianshen sect. Now, Lu Ming had killed several of them. It was a great loss.</p><p>Lu Ming kept his spoils of war and returned to the platform.</p><p>Next, it was the Tianyu demonic sect’s turn to challenge.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>A person from the Tian Yu demonic sect stepped out.</p><p>“It’s him, mo he!”</p><p>“Mo he is going to personally take action.”</p><p>“Who will he challenge?”</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>Mo he was the top genius of the Tianyu demon sect. He had an upper-class earth spiritual body and was at the peak of Lv 6 martial Royal realm. He had the potential to become one of the top ten geniuses of the Azure continent. He was definitely powerful.</p><p>The top ten geniuses of the Azure region all had superior earth spiritual bodies. In theory, as long as one successfully cultivated a superior earth spiritual body, they all had the hope of breaking through to the top ten geniuses.</p><p>Of course, there was only hope.</p><p>Even if they had the same high grade earth spiritual body, their combat strength would still be different.</p><p>For example, the strength of a domain, the strength of a domain martial technique, one’s own battle consciousness, various secret skills, and so on all determined the strength of one’s combat power.</p><p>Mo he’s eyes fell directly on the five people of Dragon God Valley. He glanced at them and finally stopped at Zi Yue.</p><p>I knew it! He wants to challenge me!</p><p>Zi Yue laughed.</p><p>“Zi Yue, if you can’t defeat him, get off the fighting stage. It’s more important to save your life!”</p><p>Han Xun warned.</p><p>Although Zi Yue’s combat strength was very strong, he did not have a superior earth spiritual body. He was probably not mo he’s match.</p><p>“I know, don’t worry!”</p><p>Zi Yue stepped onto the battle stage.</p><p>Without any unnecessary words, a great battle erupted.</p><p>Zi Yue was a heaven’s favorite of the purple dragon Valley. He had cultivated the purple dragon combat body, which was a medium-grade earth spiritual body. His territory had reached the peak of Level Seven, and his territory martial technique had been perfected. His combat power was extremely amazing.</p><p>Although his spiritual body was not as good as mo he’s, his combat strength was not much different. It was impossible for mo he to kill Zi Yue in a short period of time.</p><p>The two of them exchanged nearly a hundred moves. In the end, Zi Yue was no match for him and was thrown off the fighting ring.</p><p>Zi Yue had failed, and there were only four people left from Dragon God Valley.</p><p>The challenges continued, and soon it was the Yu Du sect’s turn.</p><p>The leader of the Yu Du sect looked at the four people from Dragon God Valley and hesitated.</p><p>None of the four remaining people from Dragon God Valley were simple.</p><p>If they wanted to send someone to fight, they could only send someone with a superior earth spiritual body, who was at the peak of the sixth level martial Royal realm. Moreover, they would not be able to kill Lu Ming and the others. Even if they could defeat one of them, they might be injured, which would be disadvantageous for the subsequent battles.</p><p>In the end, the Yu Du sect’s team leader sent out a weakling. For the first time, he did not challenge Dragon God Valley, but other sects.</p><p>The leader of the heavenly God sect’s team had a gloomy expression.</p><p>However, he also understood that the tianshen sect, the Tianyu demonic sect, and the Yudu sect had joined forces to deal with Dragon God Valley. However, all three sects wanted the final victory. If they sent their top heaven’s pride experts now, it would only cause heavy losses to both sides, which would be extremely disadvantageous for the future battles.</p><p>After the Yudu sect, the jiuxiao sword sect went up to challenge. Just like that, it was Dragon God Valley’s turn.</p><p>Cold killing intent flashed through han Xun’s eyes.”Now, the counterattack begins. Tian Chui, you go!”</p><p>“Good, haha, it’s finally my turn!”</p><p>Tian Chui laughed out loud. He was already on the verge of exploding from holding back his laughter. Now, it was finally his turn.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Tian Chui landed directly on the fighting ring. His eyes fell on a sixth level martial Royal realm young man from the deity sect and he shouted, ” “You, come down and accept your death!”</p><p>“I’m not afraid of you!”</p><p>The young man from the heavenly God sect jumped onto the fighting stage. As soon as he stepped onto the fighting stage, he immediately launched an attack at Tian Chui.</p><p>“Go to hell!”</p><p>Tian Chui roared like a mad tyrant Dragon. He raised his giant hammer and smashed it towards his opponent, completely ignoring his opponent’s attack and defense.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a violent tremor, the young man from the heaven God sect screamed and was smashed into a pile of meat paste by Tian Chui.</p><p>“Die, die!”</p><p>Tian Chui roared. His water-tank-like hammer danced in the air, causing the void to rumble. His eyes were filled with malevolent killing intent.</p><p>“Good, good kill!”</p><p>The disciples of Dragon God Valley shouted in joy.</p><p>Han Xun and Lu Ming both sneered.</p><p>The counterattack of the Dragon God Valley was finally about to begin.</p><p>This was Lu Ming’s plan.</p><p>First, protect the people, then counterattack. This way, the lives of the disciples of Dragon God Valley could be preserved as much as possible, and the most powerful one would be left.</p><p>In the beginning, many people were killed because there was no other way. If they didn’t do this, those disciples with weak cultivation would all die. Not a single one would be left alive.</p><p>To save the counterattack for the last time, he could try to preserve the lives of the Dragon God Valley disciples.</p><p>The disciples of the heavenly God sect gritted their teeth and were furious.</p><p>The people from the other sects seemed to have thought of something.</p><p>Tian Chui returned to the platform. After that, he continued with three more rounds. With this round over, the tenth round began.</p><p>It was the turn of the Tian Shen sect to challenge again.</p><p>At this moment, everyone’s eyes were fixed on the Tian Shen sect.</p><p>How would the heavenly Divine sect fight? Should he continue to challenge Dragon God Valley? Who would they send?</p><p>At this moment, the leader of the heavenly God sect looked gloomy and hesitant.</p><p>He had encountered a difficult problem.</p><p>The remaining four people of Dragon God Valley had terrifying combat strength. If he were to send someone to challenge them, he would definitely send the most powerful heaven’s pride expert. Sending the others would only be sending them to their deaths. Moreover, it would not be easy to defeat Lu Ming, Tian Chui, and the others. Even if he could win, he would definitely be injured and his combat strength would be greatly reduced.</p><p>If a few of the top experts of the Tian Shen sect were injured, the top experts of the other sects would definitely not let go of this opportunity and would challenge the top experts of the Tian Shen sect.</p><p>In this way, the top experts of the tianshen sect would most likely be eliminated. Without a top expert, the tianshen sect might not even be able to enter the top ten.</p><p>The heavenly Divine sect had now fallen into a passive position.</p><p>The paragons of the other sects had obviously thought of this as well, and they all revealed looks of anticipation.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>The leader of the heavenly God sect clenched his fists tightly.</p><p>Similarly, the team leaders of the sky demon sect and the desire poison sect were similar.</p><p>“Hey, are you guys going to challenge me or not? Don’t dawdle and waste other people’s time!”</p><p>Said Lu Ming. He was calm and unruffled, as if he was waiting for the challenge from the deity sect.</p><p>“Lu Ming …”</p><p>Many disciples of the heavenly God sect gritted their teeth and glared at Lu Ming with hatred.</p><p>However, they definitely did not dare to challenge Lu Ming. They were just courting death.</p><p>“Brother Wu, brother mo!”</p><p>At this moment, the leader of the heaven God sect transmitted a message to the leaders of the sky demon sect and the desire poison sect, ” let’s put Dragon God Valley aside and eliminate the weakest sects first. Then, we’ll concentrate our forces on dealing with Dragon God Valley. What do you think? ”</p><p>“Alright, I agree!”</p><p>The leader of the Tian Yu demonic sect replied, and the leader of the Yu Du sect nodded.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
