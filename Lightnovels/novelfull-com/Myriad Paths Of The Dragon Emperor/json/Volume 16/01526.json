This was just the beginning, and two people had already been killed.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Many young men from Dragon God Valley growled and clenched their hands. Then, someone went up and carried the body of the young man from Dragon God Valley.</p><p>The young man from the Tian Yu demonic sect left the fighting ring.</p><p>Next, it was the third platform’s turn. The heaven seat King issued a challenge.</p><p>The heaven seat King sent out a fourth level martial Royal realm heaven’s favorite to challenge a fourth level martial Royal realm heaven’s favorite from the intentionless saber sect. The two of them were evenly matched. After exchanging more than 100 moves, the heaven seat King’s heaven’s favorite was slightly better and blasted the intentionless saber sect’s heaven’s favorite off the fighting ring.</p><p>Next, the fourth platform, the evil moon sect, began their challenge.</p><p>The evil moon sect had directly sent a fifth level Martial Emperor to challenge a fourth level Martial Emperor from the poyuan family and killed him.</p><p>These two forces originally had enmity, and now both sides were truly angered.</p><p>Following that, it was the fifth platform, where the Yu Du sect issued a challenge.</p><p>A young man from the Yu Du sect leaped onto the fighting stage and his gaze fell directly on the Dragon God valley side.</p><p>“You, come down!”</p><p>The young man from the Yu Du sect pointed at a youth from the Dragon God Valley who was at the LV 4 Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>Many people in the Dragon God Valley looked terrible.</p><p>Then, he challenged Dragon God Valley.</p><p>The young man from Dragon God Valley went up to the fighting ring with an ugly expression, then quickly retreated.</p><p>The other party was also a Lv 5 martial Royal realm expert. The young man from Dragon God Valley knew that he was no match for him, so he could only escape first.</p><p>Unfortunately, the young man from the Yu Du sect was very powerful. He had shrouded the fighting ring with poisonous gas and poisoned the young man from Dragon God Valley to death.</p><p>Another person died in Dragon God Valley.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Sneers could be heard coming from the heavenly God sect.</p><p>Many young men from the tianshen sect, the Tianyu demonic sect, and the Yudu sect looked at the Dragon God Valley sect with hostility.</p><p>Dragon God Valley is in trouble. Obviously, the tianshen sect, the Tianyu demon sect, and the Yu Du sect are joining forces to deal with Dragon God Valley!</p><p>that’s right. If the three clans join forces to challenge one clan, Dragon God Valley will most likely be in trouble. I’m afraid it will be difficult for them to enter the top ten. Moreover, I don’t know how many people will be killed!</p><p>at this rate, not many people from Dragon God Valley will survive!</p><p>Many people from the various sects were discussing.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Many of the young men from Dragon God Valley roared in anger. There were even Dragon roars, and their bodies were full of murderous intent.</p><p>The Dragon God Valley disciples on the platform and in the stands behind were all furious.</p><p>This is too much!</p><p>counterattack! We must counterattack!</p><p>“When it’s our turn, we must fight back!”</p><p>Many people’s true Yuan burst out, revealing cold killing intent.</p><p>Hmph, it’s all because of Lu Ming and the others. They’re the ones who provoked the three major sects, the deity sect, the Tian Yu demon sect, and the Yu Du sect. Otherwise, how could our Dragon God Valley be targeted? ”</p><p>A cold voice was heard among the people of Dragon God Valley.</p><p>He Yu!</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze turned slightly cold.</p><p>that’s right. It’s all because of Lu Ming and the others that our Dragon God Valley has fallen into such a desperate situation. Lu Ming and the other two have to take full responsibility. Such people should have been driven out of Dragon God Valley a long time ago. Otherwise, how could today’s matter have happened? ”</p><p>Blizzard Silver City also coldly spoke.</p><p>shut up! We should be thinking of a way to fight back, not an internal conflict!</p><p>Han Xun coldly rebuked.</p><p>He Yu and Yincheng were afraid of han Xun, so they just sneered but didn’t say anything.</p><p>this won’t do. If this goes on, I might be in danger too. I must think of a way to save myself!</p><p>He Yu’s eyes turned as thoughts ran through his mind.</p><p>The competition continued.</p><p>The sixth platform, jiuxiao sword sect.</p><p>The swordsman of jiuxiao sword sect glanced at Dragon God Valley. In the end, he did not challenge Dragon God Valley, but chose the blood demon tower.</p><p>The seventh platform, the eighth platform …</p><p>One by one.</p><p>Soon, it was the tenth platform’s turn for the Dragon God Valley challenge.</p><p>The Dragon God Valley could finally launch a counterattack. Han Xun was preparing to send an expert to kill one of the disciples of the tianshen sect to restore some morale.</p><p>However, at that moment, a figure suddenly rushed out and landed on the platform. It was he Yu.</p><p>“He Yu, what are you doing?”</p><p>Han Xun roared.</p><p>Before he could make any arrangements, he Yu had already rushed out. Moreover, he Yu was only at Lv 4 Martial Emperor realm. What was the point of rushing out?</p><p>He Yu sneered but did not say anything.</p><p>He didn’t want to sit and wait for his death. He was a Lv 4 martial Royal realm martial artist. If he stayed on the platform, he would most likely be chosen by the deity sect, the sky demon sect, and the Yu Du sect in the next round of challenges. He didn’t want to die.</p><p>He Yu’s gaze shifted and landed on the 13th platform, where the demon Castle was.</p><p>“Brother, how about we have a spar?”</p><p>He Yu looked at a young man from the monster Castle.</p><p>“Damn it, why did he Yu challenge the monster Castle?”</p><p>“The demon Castle has a good relationship with Dragon God Valley!”</p><p>Some disciples of Dragon God Valley growled.</p><p>The young man from Demon Castle was also slightly stunned. He didn’t expect he Yu to challenge him. Everyone thought that Dragon God Valley would fight back and send experts to challenge the people of deity sect, sky demon sect, or Yu Du sect!</p><p>The young man from the demon Castle stepped onto the fighting ring and began his battle with he Yu.</p><p>The young man from the demon Fort had a similar combat strength to he Yu. After dozens of moves, he Yu was at a disadvantage and was blasted off the fighting ring.</p><p>“Hehe, you’re afraid of death!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>The other people of Dragon God Valley also looked angry.</p><p>Everyone could tell that he Yu was afraid of death. He was afraid of being challenged by the three sects if he stayed on the platform. Therefore, he went up to challenge the demon Castle, which had a good relationship with Dragon God Valley.</p><p>Moreover, in a situation where the two of them were about the same strength, he Yu was defeated after dozens of moves. It was obvious that he had lost on purpose.</p><p>In this way, he, who had lost, would be considered eliminated. Naturally, he would not be challenged by the other sects.</p><p>I think Junior Brother he Yu is right. Why should he be responsible for the mistakes of others? ”</p><p>Blizzard Silver City said coldly. He even cast a cold glance at Lu Ming.</p><p>His words made the eyes of some of the Dragon God Valley disciples light up.</p><p>“Alright, all of you shut up!”</p><p>Han Xun shouted coldly. He was extremely angry.</p><p>As the leader of the Dragon God Valley team, he felt helpless in such a situation.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming stepped forward and stood in front of han Xun.</p><p>“Senior Brother Han Xun, Lu Ming has a plan to avenge Dragon God Valley!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>“What’s your plan?”</p><p>Han Xun’s eyes lit up.</p><p>On the side, the other people of Dragon God Valley also looked over curiously.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming transmitted his voice to han Xun and told him about his plan.</p><p>“Junior Brother Lu, are you confident?”</p><p>Han Xun said with a serious expression.</p><p>I’m sure. This is the only way for Dragon God Valley to counterattack. It’s the only way to minimize our losses!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
