That’s just what I want!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with anticipation and a strong desire to fight.</p><p>...</p><p>The battlefield of the hundred races was actually a training ground for the geniuses of the various Emperor-ranked powers. How many geniuses would be gathered there?</p><p>Lu Ming could feel the blood in his body starting to boil. It was only interesting this way. He could only force Lu Ming to advance quickly by clashing with the other prodigies.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, I didn’t misjudge you!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master smiled, but in the next moment, his smile disappeared. His face turned serious as he said, ” cultivators, especially geniuses, can often develop their potential and break through the shackles to surpass themselves when faced with a life-and-death crisis. Therefore, anyone who dares to enter the hundred clan battlefield is a genius among geniuses. They are also mentally tough and have terrifying combat abilities. This is because ordinary people don’t dare to enter. Life-and-death battles are too common in the hundred clan battlefield. So, Ming ‘er, you must be careful. You can’t let your guard down!</p><p>“Your disciple understands!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>yes, I have an introduction to the hundred clan battlefield here. Take a look. It’ll be of some help to you!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master took out another jade talisman and handed it to Lu Ming.</p><p>Then, the two of them returned to their respective rooms. Lu Ming took out the Jade talisman and started to read it.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, two days had passed.</p><p>Two days later, the white-robed old man came to the courtyard.</p><p>“Little guy, come with me!”</p><p>The white-robed old man smiled.</p><p>“Master, disciple will take his leave!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists at the cloud Dragon Valley master.</p><p>“Go, master believes in you. In the next treasure auction, you will definitely be able to defeat a strong enemy. At that time, you will be able to look down on the Azure region’s younger generation!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said.</p><p>“Haha, Brother Yun, you’re quite confident in your disciple!”</p><p>The white-robed elder smiled and waved his hand. A wave of energy enveloped Lu Ming and took him into the sky.</p><p>After a while, the white-robed elder brought Lu Ming to a Canyon. In the canyon, there was a huge altar that was engraved with inscriptions.</p><p>“Teleportation altar!”</p><p>Lu Ming could tell that it was a teleportation altar.</p><p>This was the first time he had seen a teleportation altar in the yuan continent.</p><p>The space of the yuan continent was too stable. If one wanted to set up a teleportation altar and teleport across regions, the price would be extremely high and the amount of resources needed would also be shocking.</p><p>In the Dragon God Valley, there were only teleportation altars to the ocean. There were no other teleportation altars to the other parts of the yuan continent. Perhaps only Emperor-level forces had them.</p><p>There were four young men beside the altar.</p><p>One woman and three men.</p><p>The woman was tall and wore a silver armor, but it still couldn’t hide her hot figure. She looked very heroic.</p><p>The other three young men were all wearing white robes with clouds embroidered on them.</p><p>When the white-robed elder arrived with Lu Ming, the four young men looked at Lu Ming curiously.</p><p>“Let me introduce him to you. His name is Lu Ming, and he will be going to the hundred clan battlefield with you!”</p><p>The white-robed old man gave a simple introduction.</p><p>“Lu Ming? I’ve never heard of this name before.”</p><p>One of the young men asked with a puzzled expression. This person had a head full of dark green hair and looked very conspicuous.</p><p>“He’s not from the cloud Emperor mountain, he’s from the Azure continent!”</p><p>The white-robed old man introduced.</p><p>“The Azure continent?”</p><p>Hearing that Lu Ming came from the Azure continent, the green-haired youth’s eyes revealed a hint of contempt. He studied Lu Ming for a moment and said, you’re only at the sixth level of the martial Royal realm, yet you want to enter the hundred clan battlefield. You’re simply courting death!</p><p>“I’ll be careful when we enter the hundred clan battlefield!” Lu Ming furrowed his brows.</p><p>“Be careful? Don’t tell me you’re thinking of relying on us? I’m telling you, we won’t save you if you run into danger in the hundred clan battlefield!”</p><p>The green-haired youth sneered, and his contempt grew.</p><p>I will be responsible for my own life. If I am killed in any danger, it can only be considered that I am not skilled enough!</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice turned cold.</p><p>The green-haired youth’s tone made him very unhappy.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming actually dared to talk to him with a cold face, the green-haired young man snorted coldly. A sharp glint flashed in his eyes as he said,”Trash from the Azure continent, let’s see how you die!”</p><p>“Yunkai, enough!”</p><p>At this time, the silver-armored woman berated. The green-haired young man seemed to be very afraid of the silver-armored woman. He sneered and didn’t say anything more.</p><p>“Lu Ming, my name is Yun Xi!”</p><p>The silver-armored woman introduced herself.</p><p>“Hello!” Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you don’t have to take Yun Kai’s words to heart. Since you’re entering the hundred clan battlefield with us, we’ll naturally take care of each other when the time comes!”</p><p>Yun Xi said.</p><p>In other words, if they were to encounter any danger, they would take care of Lu Ming to the best of their abilities.</p><p>These geniuses of Emperor-ranked powers had a sense of superiority that came from their bones when they faced people who weren’t from Emperor-ranked powers.</p><p>Although Yun Xi was friendly, she still had a faint sense of superiority.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. He did not comment nor explain.</p><p>“Lu Ming, the two of them are called Yun Feng and Yun que!”</p><p>Then, Yun Xi introduced the other two young men to Lu Ming.</p><p>The other two young men nodded at Lu Ming indifferently.</p><p>alright, now that you know each other, let’s go!</p><p>The white-robed old man said.</p><p>Everyone nodded and stepped onto the teleportation altar.</p><p>The white-robed elder waved his hand and the altar began to glow. A space door was formed and Lu Ming and the five of them stepped into it.</p><p>The world spun and Lu Ming felt his vision go dark.</p><p>“What a powerful spatial rotation!”</p><p>Lu Ming had a thought in his mind.</p><p>The more stable the space was, the stronger the spinning force would be during the teleportation.</p><p>The next moment, the spinning force disappeared and Lu Ming found himself on a huge platform.</p><p>The platform should be located on the peak of a mountain. Looking into the distance, what came into view was a hilly area with no end in sight.</p><p>“The hundred clan battlefield is up ahead. We’re outside the hundred clan battlefield right now!”</p><p>Yun Xi said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He had read the introduction of the hundred clan battlefield given to him by the cloud Dragon Valley master. Any Emperor-level forces who wanted to enter the hundred clan battlefield could only be teleported outside. Teleportation formations could not be built in the hundred clan battlefield as the laws were too chaotic.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Yun Xi said and flew forward first.</p><p>This team was led by Yun Xi. Her cultivation was the highest, reaching the LV 9 martial Royal realm. The other three were all at the LV 8 martial Royal realm.</p><p>Moreover, those who dared to enter the hundred clan battlefield to train were all very powerful. Lu Ming estimated that Yun Xi and the other three had superior-grade earth spiritual bodies.</p><p>The five of them flew forward, and not long after, a deep ditch appeared in front of them.</p><p>“This ravine was created by later generations. It’s a sign that the area in front of the ravine is the official entrance to the hundred clan battlefield!”</p><p>Yun Xi said.</p><p>The five of them flew over the deep trench.</p><p>As soon as they flew past the deep trench, Lu Ming felt that something was not right. He extended his spiritual senses and discovered that the laws of heaven and earth were indeed in a mess.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
