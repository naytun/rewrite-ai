He groaned and was sent flying, spitting out blood.</p><p>...</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Tian Chui roared. He threw the giant hammer in his hand like a meteorite, hitting Luan Ying who was still in the air.</p><p>ah! Luan Ying screamed as his body was sent flying. The giant hammer carried him out of the fighting ring and landed heavily on the ground.</p><p>Luan Ying spat out a mouthful of blood, his face as pale as a sheet.</p><p>Luan Ying was defeated, because Tian Chui was still on the fighting ring.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The giant hammer flew back into the fighting ring and landed in Tian Chui’s hands.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Tian Chui’s body trembled as he spat out a mouthful of blood. His face was extremely pale.</p><p>Although he had defeated Luan Ying, he had also been severely injured.</p><p>“Senior brother Tian Chui, quickly come up and heal!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>Circulating his true Qi, Tian Chui rushed up to the platform and sat down cross-legged, focusing all his energy on healing.</p><p>Just now, he had been wounded by Luan Ying’s sword many times, and his heart had even been pierced by the longsword. The terrifying destructive sword Qi had continuously destroyed Tian Chui’s spiritual body. Tian Chui had to first destroy these destructive sword Qi before he could recover.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>On the platform of the heavenly God sect, the leader of the heavenly God sect shouted angrily.</p><p>Originally, he had thought that with Luan Ying’s combat strength, as well as the fact that he just happened to be able to restrain Tian Chui, he should be able to take him down. Although he might not be able to kill Tian Chui, he should be able to defeat him without any problem.</p><p>He didn’t expect that Tian Chui would defeat Luan Ying in the end with both of them suffering great losses, causing his plan to fail.</p><p>In this way, two of the three top experts of the heavenly God sect had been defeated, leaving only the leader. This made everyone in the heavenly God sect look very ugly.</p><p>Before this, the God of heaven sect had already announced that they would also take the first place in this time’s fixed treasure little meeting and achieve three consecutive championships.</p><p>But now, the leader was the only top-notch expert. Most of the other sixth-ranked experts had been killed. It was impossible for him to obtain first place.</p><p>All of this was because of Dragon God Valley.</p><p>Previously, they had wanted to deal with Dragon God Valley, but in the end, they had gotten themselves into trouble. Before the competition began, the people of the tianshen sect probably never dreamed that this would happen.</p><p>“I’ll leave the rest to you!”</p><p>The leader of the heavenly God sect team looked at the Tian Yu demon sect.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A figure with a demonic blade on his back rushed out of the Tianyu demonic sect, and his demonic Qi soared into the sky.</p><p>“It’s a demon manifestation!”</p><p>Someone recognized this person.</p><p>There were two people from the Tian Yu demon sect who had upper-class earth spiritual bodies and had reached the peak of Lv 6 martial Royal realm.</p><p>One of them was mo he, and the other was mo Xian.</p><p>Mo Xian’s gaze fell directly on Xue ningxin, and he said, ” “I challenge you!”</p><p>Many people were shocked. Sure enough, the tianshen sect, the Tianyu demon sect, and the Yudu sect had begun to dispatch their strongest combat forces to deal with Dragon God Valley.</p><p>Xue ningxin took a step forward and stepped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The demonic blade was unsheathed, and demonic Qi soared into the sky.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>As the Dragon’s Roar rumbled, Xue ningxin revealed her true form, turning into a Snow Dragon.</p><p>The two sides engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>This battle was different from Tian Chui’s and Luan Ying’s. This battle was a head-on clash, and it was particularly fierce.</p><p>Xue ningxin was a pure-blooded true dragon. Even among the true dragons, she was considered a genius. Her dragon body was strong, not weaker than a superior earth spiritual body. She was on par with mo Xian.</p><p>The two sides fought for more than two hundred moves. In the end, Xue ningxin won by a slight margin and knocked mo Xian off the fighting stage, while Xue ningxin herself was seriously injured. Her injuries were even worse than Tian Chui’s.</p><p>Xue ningxin dragged her heavily injured body back to the platform and began to heal.</p><p>Dragon God Valley had won another battle and defeated a top expert of the Tianyu demon sect.</p><p>Could it be that Dragon God Valley would be the last one?</p><p>Some people had such thoughts.</p><p>The challenge continued, and soon it was the desire poison sect’s turn.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Wu Qian Du of the desire poison sect stood up and stepped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>The desire poison sect also had two top experts. Wu Qian Du was the leader of the desire poison sect. This time, he was personally taking action.</p><p>Wu Qian DU’s gaze shifted between han Xun and Lu Ming.</p><p>According to the rules, Tian Chui and Xue ningxin had just fought. Now, they could not challenge them. They could only challenge Lu Ming and han Xun before they could challenge Tian Chui and Xue ningxin.</p><p>Finally, Wu Qian DU’s gaze fell on Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming, you managed to escape with your Saint weapon the last time. Now, come down and face your death!</p><p>Wu Qian Du said coldly.</p><p>Last time, Lu Ming had used the black wings to create a strong wind that rendered his poison gas useless. Now that he could not use his holy weapon, he would like to see how Lu Ming would defend against his poison gas.</p><p>“Another one is here to die!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled indifferently. He took a step forward and landed on the fighting ring.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming’s feet landed on the ground, Wu Qian Du made his move. A dense swarm of venomous insects swarmed toward Lu Ming, covering the sky and the sun like a dark cloud.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s Chaos Domain spread out and enveloped the countless poisonous insects.</p><p>“Fire!”</p><p>Lu Ming said softly. The chaos realm turned into a flame realm in an instant.</p><p>The flames enveloped the venomous insects, and with a sizzling sound, the venomous insects were burned to ashes by the flames.</p><p>However, at this moment, with a wave of Wu Qian DU’s hand, toads appeared one after another. Each Toad was covered in pustules and emitted a foul stench as they pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>In mid-air, the toads spat out streams of poisonous water from their mouths, which enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>When the poisonous water fell on the chaos Domain, there was actually a sizzling sound of corrosion.</p><p>Kill!</p><p>At the same time, Wu Qian Du charged towards Lu Ming. A soft whip appeared in his hand. The soft whip was covered with poisonous thorns and was rolling towards Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming cast the prison-suppressing heavenly art and punched the toads and whips one after another.</p><p>However, the toads exploded in the process of Lu Ming’s fist force. They turned into a pool of thick water and gushed toward Lu Ming, emitting a disgusting smell. Lu Ming felt a little dizzy when he smelled the stench.</p><p>He circulated his true Qi and regained his consciousness.</p><p>“What a terrifying poison!”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Venomous insects kept swarming out of Wu qiandu’s body. Then, toads, venomous snakes, and other things attacked Lu Ming. He controlled the soft whip and lashed it at Lu Ming with great agility.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming suddenly shouted and extended his divine sword technique. Two black sword lights burst out from Lu Ming’s eyes and rushed toward Wu qiandu.</p><p>But at this moment, a shield made of venomous insects appeared on the surface of Wu Qian DU’s body. When the divine sword technique hit the venomous insects, a large number of them were killed, but Wu Qian Du was safe and sound.</p><p>soul attacks can ignore ordinary defenses and attack the soul. However, these bugs of mine have a spirit. Your soul attack can’t penetrate anything with a spirit. You used it once last time, so I’m prepared this time. Hehe!</p><p>Wu Qian Du sneered.</p><p>it seems like soul attacks aren’t omnipotent. They still have their weaknesses!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
