Lu Ming did not dare to take it head-on. He moved his body and continued to avoid the blade light.</p><p>“Light splitting with a thought!”</p><p>...</p><p>The man spat out coldly. The saber-light suddenly split apart and bit Lu Ming’s body tightly. No matter how fast Lu Ming was, he could not avoid the saber-light.</p><p>it’s really the intentionless saber art! You’re from the intentionless saber sect!</p><p>Lu Ming roared angrily.</p><p>At the treasure auction, he had seen The Prodigy of the intentionless saber sect use the intentionless saber technique, so he was definitely not wrong.</p><p>The other party’s eyes were cold, revealing a strong killing intent, and the saber Light did not stop.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming blocked it with his holy weapon Shield and black wings. However, after being hit by the saber radiance, his body trembled violently and he was sent flying like a cannonball.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming spat out a mouthful of blood as he was sent flying.</p><p>The power of a ninth-tier martial Royal realm expert controlling a holy weapon was truly astonishing. Even with the protection of the Holy weapon, Lu Ming was still injured.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Above his head, the wind whistled, and a terrifying pressure pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>A huge black Mountain came crashing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>The other expert made his move and also attacked Lu Ming with his holy weapon.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>His essential core surged into the flowing essence gloves. Lu Ming activated the prison-suppressing heaven technique and threw a punch at the hill.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With an earth-shattering boom, the small mountain was sent flying by Lu Ming. However, Lu Ming’s body was like a meteorite, falling to the ground.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming spat out another mouthful of blood and felt his arm trembling slightly.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A metal rod that was thousands of meters long swept toward Lu Ming like a pillar that held up the sky.</p><p>Lu Ming used the black wings to protect himself. With a thump, he was sent flying and crashed into a mountain, cracking it.</p><p>The ninth level of the martial Royal realm was already at the peak of the martial Royal realm. Lu Ming had relied on his holy weapon to kill two people with lightning speed. However, this did not mean that the ninth level of the martial Royal realm was weak.</p><p>In addition, there were four ninth level martial Royal realm experts controlling the Holy weapons. When they worked together, the power was even more terrifying. Lu Ming was completely no match for them. He could not even resist.</p><p>“Bubble, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming called out bubbles.</p><p>Under such circumstances, he could only retreat. It was not wise to fight head-on.</p><p>As for the inscription refining secondary body, Lu Ming had no intention of calling it out.</p><p>With Ming Lian’s cultivation, he didn’t have a holy weapon to protect himself. If he called out, he would only be killed.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>Pao Pao cried out and opened a space-time Tunnel. Lu Ming and Lin fan rushed in.</p><p>However, at the next moment, Lu Ming seemed to have hit a wall and his body was blocked.</p><p>The space-time Tunnel had failed.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>Inscriptions appeared in all directions. Dozens of Men in Black stood in all directions. Each of them had an array disk floating above their heads, sealing the space.</p><p>“What a well-thought out plan!”</p><p>Lu Ming felt a slight chill in his heart.</p><p>It was obvious that the other party was really determined to kill him. They had taken into account all of Lu Ming’s trump cards and knew that Lu Ming had bubbles on him that could use the space-time Tunnel to escape.</p><p>The other party had already set up a space-sealing formation here to seal the space. Even the bubbles could not break out.</p><p>It wasn’t that bubbles ‘spacetime domain wasn’t wondrous enough, but that bubbles’ cultivation was still low. On the other hand, the opponent’s cultivation was much higher. Combined with the array, bubbles couldn’t be broken at all.</p><p>you guys, take down that space-time spirit mouse!</p><p>The black-robed man in the sky spoke again.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Twelve Men in Black stepped out with formation disks floating above their heads. They sealed the space and flew towards the bubble.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, a huge tower came crashing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>The attacks of the four experts had arrived again.</p><p>With a flap of his black wings, Lu Ming dashed forward at top speed, avoiding direct confrontation with the giant Pagoda.</p><p>However, what greeted him in front of him was a terrifying Saber Light.</p><p>The four experts controlled their holy weapons and attacked together, not giving Lu Ming any chance to catch his breath.</p><p>He could not avoid it!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and a faint shadow of the prison-suppressing stele appeared.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The fist collided with the saber beam. Lu Ming destroyed the saber beam, but his body was also sent flying.</p><p>The 12 Men in Black sealed the space and flew toward Lu Ming, trying to suppress him in the space.</p><p>“Let’s go all out!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with ferocity. A steady stream of energy from his third bloodline gushed into his body.</p><p>not enough, not enough. Again, again!</p><p>Lu Ming roared in his heart as he frantically borrowed the power of his third bloodline. The power in his third bloodline seemed to be endless. As the power gushed into his body, a terrifying killing intent erupted from Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned blood-red, and so did his hair. It was like blood.</p><p>At this moment, the giant Pagoda was pressing down from above.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>A terrifying sound was heard and the sky trembled. The giant Pagoda was blown away by Lu Ming. Lu Ming’s body trembled and he stepped in the air, retreating a dozen steps. However, he managed to block the attack, unlike before when he was sent flying and spat out blood.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A huge metal rod swept toward Lu Ming from the side, accompanied by a loud rumbling sound. Everything in its way was about to be smashed into pieces.</p><p>Lu Ming threw another punch and it collided with the huge rod.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The giant staff shook continuously and was sent flying by the terrifying force. However, Lu Ming suffered the same fate. He was sent flying a thousand meters, creating a path of air waves in the sky.</p><p>But then, a small mountain in the sky came crashing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>The four of them joined forces and their attacks seemed endless.</p><p>not enough, it’s still not enough. Again, again!</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl. He was going all out. The power of his third bloodline gushed into his body continuously. His body swelled up because of the terrifying power. His hair was blood red, and his eyes were like those of a demon who had walked out of the abyss of hell.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>kill! Lu Ming roared. His boundless killing intent, combined with the divine sword technique, spread in all directions.</p><p>Even though these people had long made defensive preparations against the godly sword technique, the endless killing intent still made them shiver and their hearts tremble.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming punched the hill above his head and sent it flying. This time, Lu Ming’s body did not move an inch.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming stomped on the ground and rushed out with a whoosh toward the person who was controlling the Holy weapon.</p><p>His opponent’s true essence boiled as he slashed out a terrifying blade light.</p><p>Lu Ming’s punch directly shattered the saber Light and he charged at his opponent at top speed.</p><p>A terrifying killing intent enveloped the other party, causing his face to turn pale.</p><p>“Splitting light with a thought, the blade breaks the firmament!”</p><p>The Saint blade trembled and slashed at least hundreds of times in an instant. However, the hundreds of blade gleams condensed into nine. The nine blade gleams were connected from head to tail and slashed at Lu Ming continuously.</p><p>The terrifying saber intent kept cutting at Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>However, they were blocked by a layer of terrifying energy on Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming swung his fists continuously, shattering the man’s Saber Light. He dashed forward and appeared in front of the man.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
