The Dragon God Valley could not avenge them.</p><p>...</p><p>It was normal to die in the forbidden area.</p><p>the two of you from the Tian Yu demon sect, this matter has nothing to do with you. You can leave now!</p><p>The white-haired elder of the tianshen sect looked at Mo Yang and Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Alright, we’ll leave immediately!”</p><p>Mo Yang hurriedly said.</p><p>“No, I won’t leave!”</p><p>Xie nianqing shook his head. He stood beside Lu Ming with a determined look in his eyes.</p><p>“Junior Sister, what are you doing? Lu Ming is extremely audacious to have offended the deity sect and the desire poison sect. He’s the one who’s courting death. Why do you have to accompany him?”</p><p>Mo Yang roared, extremely jealous.</p><p>“If you want to go, go by yourself. It’s my own life, I choose!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said coldly.</p><p>no, you’re my Junior Sister, the Holy Virgin of my Tian Yu demonic sect. If something happens to you, how am I going to explain it to my master and the entire Tian Yu demonic sect? I must take you away!</p><p>Mo Yang said firmly.</p><p>“Little Qing, you go!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming spoke.</p><p>“No, I want to stay with you!”</p><p>Xie nianqing shook his head. His gaze was firm. He knew that Lu Ming was doing this for her own good, but she would not leave!</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Right at this moment, Mo Yang made his move. He grabbed Xie nianqing’s shoulder and poured in his nomological law power, sealing Xie nianqing’s cultivation. Then, he grabbed Xie nianqing and retreated at top speed.</p><p>“Mo Yang, let me go!”</p><p>Xie nianqing roared.</p><p>I won’t let you go. I won’t let you die with Lu Ming!</p><p>Mo Yang said coldly. He grabbed Xie nianqing and left the encirclement.</p><p>“Do it!”</p><p>As Mo Yang and Xie nianqing retreated, the white-haired elder from the tianshen sect roared. A long spear appeared in his hand. It exuded a terrifyingly sharp aura as he stabbed it at Lu Ming.</p><p>Without a doubt, this was a holy weapon!</p><p>Huala!</p><p>Black wings appeared on Lu Ming’s back. At the same time, the Holy weapon Shield appeared in front of him.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The long spear struck the Holy Shield and sent it flying. The long spear did not stop and continued to stab the black wings. Lu Ming felt his body tremble as he was sent flying by a terrifying force.</p><p>On the other side, Tian Chui and Xue ningxin used their Saint weapons at the same time. However, the opponent’s half-Saint had also made his move. He was also controlling his Saint weapon, and the power was shocking. Tian Chui and Xue ningxin were no match for him. They were sent flying like Lu Ming. Their blood and Qi were in turmoil, and they almost vomited blood.</p><p>“Don’t linger in battle, let’s go first!”</p><p>With a flap of his black wings, Lu Ming appeared beside Tian Chui and Xue ningxin.</p><p>This time, the heaven deity sect and the Yu Du sect were well prepared. Three half-Saints wielded holy weapons, and even a few ninth level martial Royal realm experts wielded holy weapons. Their combat strength was extremely strong, far beyond their current strength.</p><p>“Bubble!”</p><p>Lu Ming called out.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>Bubbles waved her little claws and a space-time Tunnel appeared.</p><p>The three of them were about to cross the spacetime tunnel and leave this place.</p><p>“You want to leave? dream on!”</p><p>Another half-Saint of the tianshen sect shouted coldly and waved his hand. A huge cauldron the size of a mountain crushed over and suppressed the entrance of the spacetime tunnel, blocking the way of the three.</p><p>“Charge out, in the direction of the Yu Du sect!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Tian Chui and Xue ningxin.</p><p>Although the Yu Du sect’s poison Qi was very powerful and could kill without a trace, its frontal attack power was far inferior to that of the Tian Shen sect. Since the spacetime tunnel was blocked, they would forcibly charge out from the Yu Du sect’s direction.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Tian Chui roared. The three of them gathered together and controlled their Saint weapons, madly charging in the direction of the Yu Du sect.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>At the side, all sorts of attacks were launched at the three of them. Lu Ming controlled the Holy weapon Shield and the black wings to defend with all his might, enveloping the three of them.</p><p>Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>All sorts of attacks landed on Lu Ming’s shield and black wings, creating a loud boom. Lu Ming’s body trembled as his qi and blood churned and blood seeped out of the corners of his mouth.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>Tian Chui roared madly while Xue ningxin roared like a dragon. The two of them combined their strength and continued to charge forward.</p><p>The two’s combat strength was indeed astonishing. No one could stop them unless they were at the half-Saint level. A few of the Yu Du sect’s experts were blasted apart by Tian Chui’s giant hammer, turning into poisonous gas and retreating.</p><p>The three of them cooperated and charged in that direction. They were about to break out of the encirclement.</p><p>“Poison Ivy’s law, go around!”</p><p>The half-Saint of the desire poison sect was seething with poisonous gas. He shouted and pressed his hands in the air. Whoosh! Countless poisonous vines suddenly appeared in the air. Each poisonous vine was full of thorns. They covered the sky and covered the sun, shrouding Lu Ming and the other two.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>This kind of poisonous Ivy was formed from the law of poisonous Ivy. It was filled with poison and was extremely tough.</p><p>Tian Chui and Xue ningxin’s attacks landed on the poison ivy, but they were unable to break through it.</p><p>The poison ivy surrounded the three of them from all directions and quickly closed up.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The black wings enlarged and wrapped around the three of them, forming a round ball.</p><p>In the next moment, the poison Ivy’s law arrived, and wrapped around the round ball formed by black feather wing.</p><p>Zzzzzzz …</p><p>The poisonous vines wrapped around the black wings, making an ear-piercing sound, but the black wings were Saint weapons, after all, and the poisonous vines couldn’t break them.</p><p>Even the lowest level bright Saint weapon couldn’t be broken by a half-Saint expert. Only a Saint realm expert could break a Saint weapon by force.</p><p>“Hmph! What’s the point of hiding in your turtle shell? let’s see if your Saint weapon can protect you in that tornado!”</p><p>The half-Saint of the Yu Du sect said coldly. He controlled the poisonous vine and it flew towards a tornado. When it approached one of the tornadoes, the half-Saint of the Yu Du sect threw out a palm and the poisonous vine that had wrapped around Lu Ming and the others flew directly into one of the tornadoes.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>In the distance, Xie nianqing roared and struggled madly. However, Mo Yang held him tightly and he could not move.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, no matter how strong you are, you’ll still die if you go against the tianshen sect!”</p><p>Yu Sheng laughed.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>The tornado whistled through the air in a terrifying manner. It was slowly moving towards the depths of the heavenly wind Plains.</p><p>Those from the heaven deity sect and the Yu Du sect watched from the outside for a while. Seeing that there was no movement, they left one after another.</p><p>“Mo Yang, let me go!”</p><p>Xie nianqing roared. His beautiful eyes were filled with a trace of blood and cold killing intent.</p><p>“Junior Sister, what are you doing? Lu Ming and the rest were sent into the tornado and they’re dead for sure. They deserve this. Who asked them to offend the deity sect and the desire poison sect!”</p><p>Mo Yang laughed coldly, but his heart was filled with joy.</p><p>Lu Ming was finally dead. Xie nianqing should have given up by now!</p><p>Mo Yang, let me go. Otherwise, I’ll fight you to the death!</p><p>At this moment, Xie nianqing had actually calmed down. However, his body was filled with a bone-chilling killing intent, causing Mo Yang to feel a chill in his heart.</p><p>Hmph, b * tch. Anyway, Lu Ming is already dead. In the future, I will definitely make you fall head over heels for me!</p><p>Mo Yang gritted his teeth as he let go of Xie nianqing.</p><p>As soon as he let go of Xie nianqing, Xie nianqing’s demonic Qi exploded and his cultivation recovered.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
