They would first eliminate the weakest sects, then join forces to deal with Lu Ming and the others from the Dragon God Valley.</p><p>They had no other choice. If they went all out to deal with Lu Ming and the others now, the other sects would likely take advantage of them. In that case, they might not even be able to enter the top ten and could not participate in this time’s treasure fixing assembly.</p><p>...</p><p>This was something that they could not accept no matter what.</p><p>Eliminating the other weakest sects would at least guarantee that they would enter the top ten and be able to participate in the future treasure sealing assembly.</p><p>He would deal with Lu Ming and the rest after he was in the top ten.</p><p>This was their plan.</p><p>As expected, the God of heaven sent a fifth level Martial Emperor to challenge a fourth level Martial Emperor from the poyuan family.</p><p>The poyuan family was one of the weakest forces.</p><p>“Hehe, it seems that the tianshen sect is afraid. Why don’t you dare to challenge my junior brothers of the Dragon God Valley?”</p><p>On the grandstand, a seventh level martial Royal realm heaven’s favorite from Dragon God Valley spoke. He looked at the grandstand of tianshen sect with disdain.</p><p>Previously, they were repeatedly ridiculed by the people of the Tian Shen sect, saying that they would definitely not be able to participate in this time’s treasure fixing assembly, which made them extremely sullen. Now, they could finally fight back.</p><p>“Hmph, what’s the rush?”</p><p>“That’s right, the good show is yet to come!”</p><p>The heaven’s pride experts of the heavenly God sect who were at the seventh level martial Royal realm and above snorted coldly.</p><p>“Han Xun, this is a good plan!”</p><p>An old voice came from a Pavilion. It was the Saint realm elder of Dragon God Valley.</p><p>“Elder, this is Junior Brother Lu Ming’s idea!”</p><p>Han Xun said as he bowed towards the pavilion.</p><p>hmm, not bad. Keep up the good work. We must make some sects pay a price. Otherwise, do you really think that Dragon God Valley is easy to bully? ”</p><p>The Saint realm elder of Dragon God Valley continued.</p><p>“Elder, don’t worry. I guarantee that you’ll be satisfied!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>At that moment, the battle had already begun.</p><p>The heaven’s pride expert of the tianshen sect had easily defeated the heaven’s pride expert of the poyuan family.</p><p>Next, it was the Tianyu demonic sect’s turn. The Tianyu demonic sect also sent out an expert to challenge the poyuan family and easily defeated the poyuan family.</p><p>When it was the Yu Du sect’s turn, they would also challenge the poyuan family.</p><p>Everyone understood that the three major sects of the heavenly God sect were going to join forces to eliminate the weaker sects.</p><p>The poyuan family was helpless. They couldn’t even resist.</p><p>This year, there was a gap in the talents of the poyuan family. They did not even have one upper-class earth spiritual body who had reached the peak of the sixth level martial Royal realm. They only had one upper-class earth spiritual body, who was at the fourth level martial Royal realm. They could only be targeted and could not fight back.</p><p>Soon, it was Dragon God Valley’s turn.</p><p>This time, Xue ningxin had challenged the deity sect and killed a sixth level martial Royal realm heaven’s favorite. This made the faces of the people from the deity sect turn even uglier.</p><p>Previously, they had killed the disciples of Dragon God Valley arrogantly, and Dragon God Valley could not fight back.</p><p>But now, the people of the Dragon God Valley were hunting their Tian Shen sect. It was difficult for them to fight back. They couldn’t say anything and were extremely depressed.</p><p>In the eleventh round, the tianshen sect, the Tianyu demonic sect, and the Yudu sect would continue to challenge the poyuan family.</p><p>When it was Dragon God Valley’s turn, it was finally han Xun’s turn.</p><p>Han Xun also challenged a Lv 6 martial Royal realm expert from the heavenly God sect.</p><p>Han Xun had an upper-class earth spiritual body and his cultivation was at the peak of Lv 6 martial Royal realm. He was absolutely powerful. His opponent could not even get off the fighting ring and was easily killed by han Xun.</p><p>The tianshen sect could only endure. They had to endure until three sects were eliminated. At that time, they would launch a counterattack.</p><p>In the twelfth round, the three great sects of the tianshen sect would continue to challenge the poyuan family.</p><p>This was because there were still other sects challenging the poyuan family. The poyuan family’s number of people was also reduced to a single digit. They were already destined to be eliminated.</p><p>This round, it was finally Lu Ming’s turn to challenge.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and appeared on the fighting ring. His gaze fell directly on the side of the tianshen sect.</p><p>No one was surprised. Now, Dragon God Valley would naturally take revenge and kill the people of the tianshen sect.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the remaining heaven’s God sect’s geniuses. Their expressions changed drastically, especially a few sixth level martial Royal realm heaven’s geniuses. Their faces turned pale.</p><p>Finally, Lu Ming’s gaze fell on a white-haired young man.</p><p>“You, come down and die!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“What? Lu Ming wants to challenge Bai mo!”</p><p>The hearts of the surrounding people trembled.</p><p>there’s a good show to watch. Let’s bring it up in advance!</p><p>indeed, I never expected that Lu Ming would challenge Bai mo now. In recent years, the deity sect has produced many geniuses and strong people. It is said that there are three upper-class earth spiritual bodies who have reached the peak of the sixth level of the martial Royal realm participating in the treasure settling small meeting. This Bai mo is one of them!</p><p>that’s right, Bai mo, he is one of the top experts in this time’s treasure auction!</p><p>Many people were excited.</p><p>The battle of the peak was about to begin.</p><p>“Junior Brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>Han Xun’s eyes flickered as well. Lu Ming’s move had exceeded his expectations. He had thought that Lu Ming would challenge an ordinary sixth level Martial Emperor.</p><p>“You want to challenge me?”</p><p>Bai Mo’s body gushed out cold killing intent and he said indifferently.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright, I wanted to kill you later, but since you’re in a hurry to die, I’ll send you on your way first!”</p><p>Bai mo said coldly. He moved and appeared on the fighting ring, standing opposite Lu Ming.</p><p>“Oh, really? If I kill you, the Tian Shen sect will be heartbroken!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile.</p><p>“White Essence slash!”</p><p>At this time, Bai mo moved. A snow-white sword light slashed toward Lu Ming at an amazing speed. Before the sword reached him, the sharp intent pierced the air and made a whistling sound.</p><p>Not everyone in the Tian Shen sect cultivated Sacred Arts. Many people cultivated other Arts.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Emperor spiritual weapon spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hands. With a shake of the spear, it turned into a spear ray and pierced through the air.</p><p>The spear radiance and the sword radiance collided, and the dense energy spread in all directions.</p><p>Lu Ming and Bai mo were already engaged in a fierce battle.</p><p>Bai Mo’s realm was very special. It was white, and every wisp of white light was a sword Qi. With Bai Mo’s realm martial technique, the power was very terrifying.</p><p>The dense sword gleam was aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming used thirteen accumulated power strikes to fight his opponent. His long spear was like a dragon, sweeping across the void. Each spear contained thirteen attacks. The endless sword gleams were crushed by the long spear and dissipated in the air.</p><p>The two figures crossed each other on the fighting ring, occasionally colliding with each other, making a shocking roar.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two of them had exchanged more than fifty moves.</p><p>“Gate of God, seal!”</p><p>In the process of the battle, Lu Ming cast the nine seals of the gate of God. Six sealing gates appeared at once, emitting thousands of rays of light, trying to seal Bai mo.</p><p>Bai Mo’s pupils shrank and he growled, ” “White God, sword shadow!”</p><p>Bai Mo’s body emitted a white light like a sword. In a flash, he rushed out of the nine seals of the gate of God.</p><p>“What a wondrous spirit body!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Bai Mo’s spirit body should be a kind of sword body, which was extremely mysterious.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
