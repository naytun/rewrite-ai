He did not expect that Lu Ming would be able to discover him.</p><p>At the crucial moment, he used the long sword in his hand to block in front of him.</p><p>...</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The long spear stabbed into the opponent’s long sword. The long sword bent into an arc and hit the black-clothed man’s body. The black-clothed man’s body trembled and was directly sent flying, creating a ravine that was a few hundred meters long on the ground.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure did not stop as he charged toward the Man in Black.</p><p>“Lu Ming, wait a moment!”</p><p>At this moment, Yun Xi exclaimed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he landed beside the Man in Black. He pointed his long spear and sealed the man’s vital essence.</p><p>“Why did you stop me?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze turned to Yun Xi.</p><p>At this moment, Yun Xi, Yun Kai, and the other two were all dumbfounded.</p><p>To them, the assassins from the residence of a thousand kills were extremely difficult to deal with. However, Lu Ming had dealt with them easily.</p><p>Lu Ming, once an assassin from the thousand-kills mansion is killed, a killing mark will be left on the person who killed them. It’s almost impossible to erase it. Other assassins from the thousand-kills mansion will find the murderer based on this killing mark and will fight until the other party is killed. So, you can’t kill this assassin from the thousand-kills mansion!</p><p>Yun Xi took a deep breath to calm herself down and explained.</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and he said helplessly, ” “It’s a pity, it’s too late!”</p><p>“Too late?”</p><p>Yun Xi was stunned, and then her beautiful eyes widened. “Could it be that you’ve already killed someone?”</p><p>that’s right. I’ve already killed the assassin from the mansion of a thousand kills who was chasing me just now. So, I don’t mind killing one more person!</p><p>With that, Lu Ming thrust his long spear forward and killed the assassin in black.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, he took the other party’s storage ring and sword.</p><p>Yun Xi, Yun Kai, and the others walked out of the canyon, their faces pale.</p><p>“Lu Ming, how did you discover the other party’s hiding place?”</p><p>Yun Xi asked.</p><p>“My soul force is relatively strong, so I can sense the other party’s soul fluctuations!”</p><p>Lu Ming explained. He had nothing to hide.</p><p>It was normal for some people to be gifted and have powerful souls.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ve killed two assassins from the house of thousand kills. Please leave now!”</p><p>Yun Kai said coldly.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Yun Kai.</p><p>you don’t have to be so reluctant. You already have the killing mark of the thousand-kill mansion on you. The assassins of the thousand-kill mansion in the hundred clan battlefield will keep looking for you. I don’t want to be implicated by you!</p><p>Yun Kai said coldly.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Lu Ming chuckled, his laughter filled with contempt.</p><p>If it had not been for Lu Ming’s help, Yun Kai and the others would most likely have been killed by the two assassins from the house of thousand kills. Now that the assassins from the house of thousand kills had been killed by Lu Ming, Yun Kai wanted to ask Lu Ming to leave immediately so that he would not be implicated. What a joke.</p><p>“What are you laughing at? You must leave today!”</p><p>Yun Kai said coldly.</p><p>I will leave without you telling me. It’s even more dangerous for me to stay with trash like you!</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“What did you just say? You dare to call me a trash, a mere sixth level Martial Emperor …”</p><p>Yun Kai was furious, pointing at Lu Ming and berating him loudly.</p><p>you’re only at the sixth level of the Martial Emperor realm, but you killed two assassins from the mansion of thousand kills. What were you doing just now? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said disdainfully, causing Yun Kai’s face to turn red.</p><p>“It’s just that my soul force is a bit stronger!”</p><p>Yun Kai was stubborn.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with Yun Kai. He looked at Yun Feng, Yun que, and Yun Xi and said, ” “Is this also what you want?”</p><p>Yun Feng and Yun que looked embarrassed. They did not dare to meet Lu Ming’s eyes and turned their gazes in other directions.</p><p>Their intentions were the same as Yun Kai’s.</p><p>If Lu Ming continued to stay with them, they would all die when the experts from the thousand kills mansion arrived!</p><p>“Lu Ming, I …”</p><p>Yun Xi said, but she couldn’t continue halfway, and a look of guilt appeared on her face.</p><p>Logically, she wanted to keep Lu Ming. However, her rationality told her that if she kept Lu Ming, they would all die.</p><p>The assassins of the thousand-kill mansion were too terrifying.</p><p>Furthermore, the hundred clan battlefield was simply the Holy Land of the thousand-kill mansion. Countless geniuses gathered there. Every year, the thousand-kill mansion would send a large number of geniuses into the hundred clan battlefield to train their assassination skills.</p><p>Therefore, many paragons in the hundred clan battlefield were shocked when they heard about the thousand-kill mansion.</p><p>Very few people targeted by the thousand kills Manor could survive.</p><p>there’s no need to say anymore. I understand. Lu Ming will take his leave now!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly and turned to leave. However, at this moment, Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and he looked in one direction.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>There were three figures flying over from that direction.</p><p>The man in the middle was wearing a purple-gold robe. He was tall and handsome, and there was a purple sword-shaped mark between his eyebrows. His entire person was filled with a noble aura.</p><p>Beside him, there were two other young men in purple robes. They also looked extraordinary.</p><p>The three of them stopped above Lu Ming and the rest, looking down at them from above.</p><p>One of the young men’s eyes fell on Yun Xi, and a hint of battle intent appeared in his eyes. Lv 9 martial Royal realm, the same level as me. Young master, how about I go and practice? ”</p><p>“Sure, go!”</p><p>The noble young man in the middle nodded.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The young man stepped forward, and the aura of a Lv 9 martial Royal realm expert emanated from his body. He pressed down on Yun Xi and said, ” “Fight me!”</p><p>This was the hundred clan battlefield. There was no reason to attack. There were no rules here.</p><p>All of the young heaven’s favorites came here for two reasons. First, to train themselves. Second, to find opportunities.</p><p>Only through great battles and killing could one temper themselves.</p><p>In this place, it was very normal for people to attack without any reason when they encountered people of similar cultivation.</p><p>On the other hand, those with high cultivation would usually not attack those with low cultivation, because there was no value in tempering them, unless the other party had a treasure on him.</p><p>He could either challenge someone stronger, or someone at the same level as him, and break through in a life-or-death situation.</p><p>“A battle it shall be!”</p><p>Yun Xi held the long spear in her hand and stepped into the air, standing opposite the purple-robed youth.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Without saying anything else, the young man in purple attacked. A light spot lit up between his eyebrows, and then a combat sword flew out. He held it in his hand and slashed it at Yun Xiao.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Yun Xi thrust her spear forward like a silver bolt of lightning.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The long spear and the combat sword collided, and the sword Qi and spear light scattered in all directions. The two of them trembled slightly and took a few steps back at the same time.</p><p>Without a doubt, the other party was also a heaven’s favorite with a superior earth spiritual body, and his combat strength was amazing.</p><p>“You have some strength, but this is far from enough!”</p><p>The young man in purple shouted. A light spot also lit up on his arm. From the light spot, a battle-ax flew out and floated above his head. The battle-ax seemed to be connected to the Battle Sword in his hand, making the power of the Battle Sword in his hand stronger.</p><p>“Ten thousand soldiers scroll, you’re from the WAN family!”</p><p>Yun Xi’s expression changed drastically, and she cried out in alarm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
