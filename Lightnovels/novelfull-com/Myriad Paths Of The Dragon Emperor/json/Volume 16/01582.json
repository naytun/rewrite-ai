They also rushed toward the passage above their heads.</p><p>...</p><p>There were at least a hundred people rushing towards the tunnel above them, and a portion of them were rushing towards the tunnel they had entered earlier.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The black-robed men hunted with all their might, leaving behind a large number of corpses in the underground cave.</p><p>However, there were many of them who had entered this time. Although a large number of them had been killed, there were still a few hundred of them who charged towards the two passages.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, the underground cave shook violently.</p><p>The formation was broken, and gravel flew everywhere. A dark cave appeared below, and a skeleton-like old man floated out of the cave.</p><p>“Flesh and blood, flesh and blood!”</p><p>The skeleton-like old man’s hoarse voice rang out. After which, he pounced towards the corpses that had been killed. Wisps of black smoke seeped out from the old man’s body and enveloped the corpses.</p><p>Immediately, the corpses quickly shriveled up. Even the blood on the ground was absorbed by the black mist. The skeleton-like old man’s body also became plumper and had more luster.</p><p>haha, I, Shakyamuni Devourer, am finally out!</p><p>The old man laughed, and his eyes were filled with a shocking blood-red light.</p><p>“Welcome back to the world, Dharmaraja!”</p><p>The black-robed Saints bowed.</p><p>“Hmm, you guys are not bad!”</p><p>Shakyamuni spirit-devouring nodded. He then looked at the passage above and said, ” “I need more flesh and blood, kill!”</p><p>Then, Shakyamuni spirit-devouring flew into the sky and chased after the passage above, followed by several Saints.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming and the rest had already rushed out of the passageway.</p><p>As soon as he rushed out of the passage, he realized that the tornadoes that had been surrounding him had all disappeared.</p><p>Even the tornadoes on the plain had disappeared. The plain had become an ordinary plain.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In the sky, there were constant rumbles. Poisonous gas and holy light filled the world.</p><p>At the same time, the cry of a Phoenix could be heard.</p><p>Eight Saints were fighting in the sky for the Phoenix mirror.</p><p>No, not just eight people!</p><p>Lu Ming looked up and saw more than a dozen figures fighting in the sky. The entire sky was about to explode.</p><p>The dozen of them were all sages.</p><p>It was obvious that while they were in, another Saint had arrived to take part in the fight for the Phoenix mirror.</p><p>The ancient Phoenix mirror was surrounded by many saints. More than a dozen Saints fought with each other, and no one could get the ancient Phoenix mirror.</p><p>Bang! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the sky, a figure was sent flying, spitting out blood.</p><p>A Saint was injured. He was a Saint from the heaven God sect.</p><p>There were strong and weak Saints as well. Obviously, this person was one of the weaker ones in the Saint realm.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming and the rest rushed out of the passage, they did not stop at all. They ran wildly out of the Windy Plains.</p><p>Behind them, the evil spirit people gave chase.</p><p>“Elder, save me!”</p><p>Some people from the heavenly God sect and the Yu Du sect shouted loudly, seeking help from the Saint realm experts.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The injured Saint took a step forward and appeared above the crowd. He said, ” “What’s going on?”</p><p>“There’s an ambush in that cave. Many of us were killed by them!”</p><p>A disciple of the heavenly God sect quickly replied. They let out a long breath when they saw the half-Saint of the heavenly God sect.</p><p>“Such great courage!”</p><p>A cold killing intent flashed in the eyes of the heavenly God sect’s Saint realm expert. Just now, he was the first one to be injured in the fight for the ancient Phoenix mirror. He had been suppressing his anger in his heart and had no place to vent it. Now, he turned his target to the evil spirit cult.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The Saint from the tianshen sect took a step forward. The sky was filled with Saint light, forming a terrifying sword Qi that charged towards the evil spirit cult.</p><p>In an instant, more than a dozen evil spirit powerhouses were killed, including two half-Saints.</p><p>A Saint stage expert could condense Saint power. Once the Saint power was released, the true origin could not resist it at all and was instantly pierced through.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>The rest of the evil spirit cultists retreated.</p><p>However, Lu Ming, Tian Chui, and Xue ningxin did not stop at all. They continued to rush out.</p><p>There was actually a Guardian King level figure sealed here. Evil Spirit’s Guardian Kings were all Emperor-level powerhouses. Even if they had been sealed for many years, they were still absolutely terrifying. It was better to leave now.</p><p>The tianshen sect Saint naturally didn’t know any of this. Saint light burst out from his body, and with a spirit that cared about the world, he stepped towards the people from evil spirit.</p><p>how dare you kill the people of my Tian Shen sect! Leave no one alive!</p><p>The Saint of the heavenly God sect coldly spoke.</p><p>“Oh, really? Let’s see how you’re going to kill him! Hehehe!”</p><p>At this time, a sneer was heard. Shakyamuni spirit-devouring flew out of the tunnel in the mountain. His body was covered in black smoke as he flew over.</p><p>The Saint realm expert of the tianshen sect looked at Shakyamuni Shiling and frowned.</p><p>He realized that he couldn’t see through the other party and didn’t know his cultivation realm. However, he could feel that the other party seemed to be very weak, his qi and blood extremely weak.</p><p>Hmph, the old man whose qi and blood are about to be exhausted has also come to die. Kill!</p><p>The Saint of the tianshen sect shouted coldly as he condensed a spear of divine punishment in his hand.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>As the spear of divine punishment struck out, a terrifying whistling sound resounded in the sky. Even the space started to ripple.</p><p>The spear of God’s punishment used by a Saint was too terrifying. It was completely condensed from Saint power and carried the power of laws. Lu Ming felt that even if he blocked it with a Saint weapon, he would be pierced.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The spear of divine punishment accurately hit Shakyamuni Devourer, who exploded.</p><p>“Hmph, you can’t even withstand a single blow!”</p><p>The heaven God sect’s Saint sneered in disdain.</p><p>“Is that so? gah gah gah!”</p><p>With a sneer, Shakyamuni Shiling turned into wisps of black smoke and wrapped around the Saint of the heaven God sect.</p><p>“How is that possible? Under the power of my laws, even a natural-type spirit body would be seriously injured!”</p><p>The heaven God sect’s Saint roared in disbelief.</p><p>Some nature-type spirit bodies, such as fire and lightning, had strong vitality. When their bodies collapsed, they could greatly reduce the damage.</p><p>However, the power of the law was extremely harmful to this kind of spiritual body. The spear attack of the Saint of the tianshen sect could definitely injure the opponent, but it seemed that the opponent was not hurt at all.</p><p>In the next moment, his expression changed drastically because he felt the blood in his body boiling as if it was going to be swallowed by the black smoke around him.</p><p>“Explode!”</p><p>break! the Saint of the tianshen sect roared, and his Saint power burst out, trying to destroy the black smoke of discipline King Shiling.</p><p>However, it was of no use. The black smoke dissipated and once again condensed into small snakes, drilling into the body of the heaven God sect’s Saint.</p><p>“This is the soul devouring technique. Who are you?”</p><p>The heaven God sect’s Saint cried out in fear.</p><p>hehe, you’re quite knowledgeable. You know about the soul-devouring technique. I’m the soul-devouring Shakyamuni!</p><p>A cold laugh came from the black smoke.</p><p>“Shakyamuni spirit Devourer? You’re the spirit Devourer of evil spirit!”</p><p>The eyes of the Saint from the tianshen sect widened, and he looked extremely frightened.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
