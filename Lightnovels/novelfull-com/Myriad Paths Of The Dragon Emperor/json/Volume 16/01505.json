It pierced through a human warrior and his blood spilled on the spot.</p><p>...</p><p>Everyone saw that it was a silver swordfish that looked like a silver divine sword.</p><p>The swordfish killed one person and fell into the lake, disappearing.</p><p>“Ah!” “Ah!”</p><p>At the same time, a few more blood-curdling screeches were heard. A few aquatic demonic beasts rushed out of the lake and killed a few people.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Many people’s expressions changed.</p><p>Just now, the surface of the lake had been calm, and they thought that there were no living creatures under the lake. They didn’t expect that so many aquatic demonic beasts would suddenly attack them.</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>The surface of the lake churned. This time, countless aquatic demonic beasts rushed out of the lake and attacked the group.</p><p>Some of them were not strong, but some of them were extremely terrifying.</p><p>“Kill, kill these demonic beasts!”</p><p>Someone roared and launched an attack on the demonic beasts in the water.</p><p>A chaotic battle instantly erupted.</p><p>The demonic beasts in the water were constantly being killed.</p><p>None of the human cultivators who could enter this place were weak. Just now, a few of them had been killed due to a moment of carelessness. Now that they were fighting back with all their might, large numbers of water demonic beasts were killed.</p><p>“Human warriors, get out of here!”</p><p>A giant octopus flew into the sky and roared like thunder.</p><p>The eight huge tentacles waved out and wrapped around a Lv 7 Martial Emperor. With a shake, the LV 7 Martial Emperor was killed.</p><p>Then, it swung its tentacle and killed the two sixth level martial Royal realm martial artists.</p><p>Strong!</p><p>This octopus was actually at the ninth level of the martial Royal realm.</p><p>“Evil creature, I’ll kill you!”</p><p>An old voice rang out. An old man stepped into the air and attacked the octopus. The two of them were engaged in a fierce battle.</p><p>Lu Ming, Tian Chui, and Xue ningxin were also under attack.</p><p>A group of lobsters charged toward the three of them.</p><p>These lobsters were covered in iron armor and were impervious to swords and Spears. Their defense was amazing.</p><p>The one in the lead was a seventh level martial monarch.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming’s spear pierced through a fifth level Martial Emperor lobster.</p><p>“It’s so hard!”</p><p>Lu Ming felt that the defense of this fifth level martial Royal realm lobster was stronger than many sixth level martial Royal realm martial artists. It was even harder to kill.</p><p>there are so many powerful aquatic demonic beasts in a Lake. It’s not simple!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>Demonic beasts were generally divided into two types as their cultivation level increased.</p><p>The first was to take human form and form a force. One could even join a human sect to comprehend the great Dao of heaven and earth and cultivate the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p>This type of cultivation path was very similar to that of humans. They were called demonic cultivators!</p><p>The other type didn’t take a human form and kept their beast form. They lived in the deep mountains and lakes and continued to cultivate according to their beast nature. They developed their beast body and kept their beast nature. These types were generally called vicious beasts and savage beasts.</p><p>This kind of fierce and savage beast would be even more ferocious and have some shocking combat strength.</p><p>Obviously, the demonic beasts in the lake belonged to the category of ferocious beasts.</p><p>Both sides were fighting fiercely. However, there were more experts on the human side. There were even quite a few experts at Lv 8 and Lv 9 martial Royal realm. They were all experts from small forces near the Dragon Lake.</p><p>Slowly, the humans gained the upper hand. Demonic beasts were killed one after another, and the lake was dyed red with blood.</p><p>Si si …</p><p>Suddenly, the water in the lake churned and a huge black shadow emerged from the lake. It swallowed a Lv 8 martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>It was a pitch-black giant snake that was a thousand meters long. Its aura was violent and extremely terrifying.</p><p>It swallowed a Lv 8 martial Royal realm expert in one gulp. It was too shocking.</p><p>not good! A peak Martial Emperor and a half-Saint blue deep water snake!</p><p>Someone shouted in fear.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two were greatly shocked.</p><p>The peak of the Martial Emperor realm was also known as the half-Saint realm. It was one step into the Saint realm and was extremely powerful. There was actually such a terrifying giant snake here.</p><p>However, there was an even more shocking scene.</p><p>Another Cang Ming water snake appeared on the other side of the lake. Its aura was no weaker than the previous one. With a swing of its tail, it sent a Lv 9 martial Royal realm expert flying, causing him to spit out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Two blue abyss water snakes. There were actually two such terrifying blue abyss water snakes in the Dragon Lake.</p><p>“Outsiders, get out of here. Otherwise, I’ll kill you without mercy!”</p><p>A Cang Ming water snake let out a long hiss and rose into the air like a real Dragon.</p><p>It rolled its huge body and charged toward a Lv 9 martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>The LV 9 martial Royal realm expert was shocked.</p><p>The ninth level of the Martial Emperor realm was basically the peak of the Martial Emperor realm. However, compared to the existence of the half-Saint realm, he was still far from it.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The LV 9 martial Royal realm expert was sent flying by the attack. He spat out a mouthful of blood and his face turned pale.</p><p>“If you’re still not leaving, then kill without mercy!”</p><p>The other Cang Ming water snake said coldly.</p><p>“What big words. Let’s see who you can kill.”</p><p>At this moment, a cold voice came from the sky. Then, a beam of milky white holy light descended from the sky and struck one of the blue deep water snakes.</p><p>Si si …</p><p>The Cang Ming water snake opened its mouth and spat out a black stream of water towards the milky-white holy light. However, as soon as the stream of water came into contact with the Holy Light, it was pierced through.</p><p>The Holy Light landed on the blue deep water snake’s body and it let out a blood-curdling screech. A large portion of its scales were knocked off and it started bleeding.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>Everyone’s hearts trembled. A Sage had injured the half-Saint blue deep water snake with one move?</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A powerful pressure spread down from the sky. Everyone looked up and saw a young man in a white robe. Even his shoes were white. He walked in the air step by step, emitting a milky-white holy light, like a god.</p><p>“Deity sect, deity!”</p><p>When Xue ningxin saw this person, she exclaimed in a low voice, and her pupils shrank.</p><p>“What? This person is the Divine Child!”</p><p>Tian Chui also cried out in shock, and his eyes were filled with a strong desire to fight.</p><p>In the heavenly God sect, there were holy virgins and Holy Sons. However, there was only one person who was called the divine Son. He was one of the ten monstrous talents of the Azure continent, the number one heaven’s chosen of the heavenly God sect.</p><p>The Son of God stepped through the air and locked onto the Cang Ming water snake with his powerful aura. He looked in the other direction and said, ” “Wang Jian, since you’re here, why aren’t you attacking?”</p><p>hahaha, I wanted to watch the fun, but since that’s the case, leave the other blue deep water snake to me!</p><p>In the sky, a sword light flashed, and a young man carrying a long sword appeared.</p><p>Wang Jian, the peerless heaven’s favorite of the jiuxiao sword sect, one of the top ten geniuses of the Azure continent!</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>Two of the top ten geniuses of the Azure state had actually come.</p><p>“Get lost! Who are you? get lost!”</p><p>A Cang Ming water snake roared and charged towards Wang Jian.</p><p>“Divine Child, let’s compete to see who can kill the blue deep water snake faster. How about it?”</p><p>Wang Jian laughed as he pointed his finger out like a sword. A ray of sword radiance shot out towards the blue profound water snake.</p><p>A deep gash was left on the blue deep water snake’s body.</p><p>“That’s exactly what I wanted. It’s been three years since we last met. Wang Jian, let’s see if you’ve made any progress!”</p><p>The Son of God spoke softly. He took a step forward and a beam of divine light shot towards one of the blue deep water snakes.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
