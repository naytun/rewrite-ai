He glared at Lu Ming and the other two and roared, ” “After killing the disciples of my heavenly God sect, you still want to escape? Kill!”</p><p>The young man turned into a ray of holy light and chased after Lu Ming and the rest at an alarming speed.</p><p>“So fast!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. The other party’s speed was too fast. He was approaching them at an extreme speed.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The other party waved his hand and slashed out a ray of holy light.

Lu Ming’s body was sent flying like a cannonball.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming felt his qi and blood surging in his body, and a stream of blood spilled from his mouth.</p><p>Even with the black wings to block, he was still blasted to the point of spitting blood. It was clear how strong the other party’s attack was.</p><p>Lv 9 martial Royal realm!</p><p>Furthermore, he was a top heaven’s favorite with shocking battle prowess.</p><p>“Junior Brother, how are you?”</p><p>Xue Xin called out in concern.</p><p>“I’m fine. We can’t go on like this. They’ll catch up to us sooner or later. Senior brothers and sisters, let go of your bodies and minds. Don’t resist!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Tian Chui and Xue ningxin subconsciously nodded.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and the mountain and river diagram appeared. He kept Tian Chui and Xue ningxin into the mountain and river diagram. Then, he activated the wind element technique. With a flap of his black wings, his figure was like a Black Lightning, rushing forward at an extreme speed. His speed was not slower than the divine sky sect’s paragons behind him.</p><p>The heaven’s God sect’s Paragon’s expression changed. The killing intent on his face grew stronger as he glared at Lu Ming. The Holy Light on his body burned like a ball of white flames. He sped up and followed closely behind Lu Ming.</p><p>“Who is that?”</p><p>“What a shocking fluctuation.

That pair of wings is a holy weapon!</p><p>The two of them, one chasing and one escaping, also attracted the attention of others.</p><p>“Eh? It’s that guy, Lu Ming!”</p><p>In front of Lu Ming, there were a few black-robed young men. They heard the commotion and looked over. When one of them saw Lu Ming, his eyes flashed with killing intent.</p><p>These people were the disciples of the Tian Yu demon sect. The person who had spoken was mo he.</p><p>he’s being chased by the stone crown. Let’s stop that Lu Ming!</p><p>Mo he said coldly.

He stood in front of Lu Ming, his demonic Qi soaring to the sky.</p><p>Back then, he was ordered to kill Lu Ming. In the end, not only did he fail to kill Lu Ming, but the five seventh level martial emperors who followed him all died. Even he himself was tricked by Lu Ming’s formation. He lost an arm and even his storage ring.</p><p>During this period of time, he had been thinking about revenge at all times.</p><p>He did not expect to meet Lu Ming here. Moreover, Lu Ming was being hunted down by the experts of the heaven deity sect.

Their combat strength was not weak.</p><p>At the same time, the stone crown behind him was already approaching.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming roared. Two rays of black light flashed in his eyes and he charged at the two disciples of the sky demon sect.</p><p>The two of them shuddered.

It turned into two spearlights and stabbed at the two disciples of the sky demon sect.</p><p>The spear radiance contained the technique of thirteen accumulated strikes. Ten bursts of power burst out and pierced through the two people’s attacks and defenses.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>The two disciples of the Tian Yu demonic sect were dead.</p><p>Die!</p><p>At this moment, Shi Guan arrived.
