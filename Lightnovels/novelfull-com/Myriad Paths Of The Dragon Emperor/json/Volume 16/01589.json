In fact, if one’s cultivation was too low, one would not even be able to sense it. Only when one reached a certain realm would one be able to sense it.</p><p>However, they were not Saints, so the chaotic laws did not affect them much.</p><p>...</p><p>The hundred tribe battlefield had taken place in ancient times, and it had happened a long time ago. The earth was reinvigorated, just like the outside world, except for the chaotic laws of the world.</p><p>At this point, the five of them concealed their auras and became more careful.</p><p>“The closer we get to the center of the hundred clan battlefield, the more experts there will be. We should be fine if we’re careful on the periphery!”</p><p>Yun Xi said in a low voice.</p><p>The few of them nodded.</p><p>In the hundred tribe battlefield, the closer to the center of the hundred tribe war, the more powerful the participants were. Naturally, many treasures were left behind.</p><p>Therefore, the more powerful the heaven’s favorites are, the more they would gather in the center to search for opportunities. At the same time, they would find opponents to train themselves.</p><p>On the outside, some of the weaker heaven’s favorites were active.</p><p>The five of them ran forward and did not encounter any danger. Occasionally, they would encounter some demonic beasts, but most of them were not of a high level.</p><p>The hundred clan battlefield was extremely huge. They soon covered tens of thousands of miles.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Right at this moment, an extremely soft sound was heard. Yun Feng let out a blood-curdling screech as one of his arms flew off, blood splattering everywhere.</p><p>“Not good, someone’s ambushing us!”</p><p>The expressions of Yun Xi and the others changed drastically.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The faint sound of something breaking through the air rang out again.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>Yun Xi shouted and quickly retreated.</p><p>The others followed suit.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>They had retreated fast enough, but Yun que was still hit. A deep sword wound appeared on his chest and blood flowed out. His spiritual body squirmed wildly, wanting to recover, but it seemed to be blocked by a terrifying killing intent that was constantly destroying his spiritual body, making his wound difficult to recover in a short time.</p><p>It was the same for Yun Feng. One of his arms had been cut off. He wanted to regrow it, but a terrifying killing intent prevented his spirit body from regrowing.</p><p>thousand-kill swordsmanship! They’re from thousand-kill mansion!</p><p>Yun Kai roared, his face filled with fear.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, another faint sound rang out. It was as if a sword light was heading towards Yun Kai.</p><p>He could only feel a faint fluctuation, but he couldn’t see the attacker. He couldn’t even see the sword light. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>A silver spear appeared in Yun Xi’s hand, and she swept it out.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Yun Xi’s long spear seemed to have collided with a combat sword. With a loud boom, she blocked the sword.</p><p>Yun Kai was so frightened that his cold body began to flow. A battle sword appeared in his hand, exuding a terrifying aura.</p><p>It was obviously a holy weapon.</p><p>At the same time, Yun que and Yun Feng both took out their Saint weapons.</p><p>The geniuses of Emperor-ranked forces naturally didn’t lack Saint weapons.</p><p>it’s the hiding technique and Shadowless Sword of thousand kills mansion. Let’s surround him and prevent him from launching a sneak attack!</p><p>Yun Xi shouted.</p><p>The five of them immediately formed a circle and looked around nervously.</p><p>f * ck! How unlucky! We’ve just entered the hundred clan battlefield, and we’ve already encountered assassins from the thousand-kill mansion!</p><p>Yun que angrily shouted. Now, he had finally obliterated that terrifying killing intent and the wound on his chest began to recover.</p><p>As for Yun Feng, his arm started to regrow.</p><p>“Lu Ming, guard your direction well. If you can’t, get lost quickly so you don’t get us involved!”</p><p>Yun Kai coldly said.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, a soft sound was heard again. This time, it was aimed at Yun Xi.</p><p>Yun Xiao’s pupils rapidly contracted, and he swept his long spear horizontally. However, when he swept it out, he realized that he had missed. The spear swept through the air, and with a swish, the sword light pierced toward Yun Kai!</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>die! Yun Kai roared as he slashed out with his sword. The power was terrifying.</p><p>Yun Kai’s cultivation was at the peak of the LV 8 martial Royal realm. It was obvious that he had an upper-class earth spiritual body. He could easily kill a peak Lv 9 martial Royal realm expert with a full-force slash by controlling his holy weapon.</p><p>However, the sword still missed. The sword Qi landed on the ground and left a sword mark that was several miles long and dozens of meters deep. It split a Hill in half.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The sound of the sword breaking through the air rang out continuously. The terrifying sword light was constantly thrust out. It would not stab toward Yun Xi, but at Yun Kai and Lu Ming …</p><p>Only the sound of the sword could be heard, but no one could see the person who attacked or the sword that was used to assassinate.</p><p>Moreover, the sword light was extremely fast, powerful, and accurate.</p><p>They were completely passive. After a while, another sword wound appeared on Yun Feng’s body.</p><p>“What a terrifying assassination technique!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyebrows furrowed slightly.</p><p>The other party’s concealment technique was too powerful. He had completely concealed his body, and not even a trace of his aura could be sensed. They were completely passive and could only be continuously assassinated without being able to counterattack.</p><p>the opponent’s cultivation should be at Lv 8 martial Royal realm!</p><p>Yun Xi said.</p><p>what should we do? we can’t go on like this. We’re too passive!</p><p>Yun Kai said.</p><p>let’s go there. There’s a Canyon there. As long as we enter the canyon, it’ll be advantageous to us!</p><p>Yun Xi called out.</p><p>The other party’s movement technique was too fast. The terrain was open and the other party could move freely. Their counterattacks couldn’t hit the other party. If they entered the canyon, they would greatly limit the other party’s movements.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The long spear in Yun Xi’s hand expanded and turned into a thousand-meter long spear radiance. It swept in all directions with the power to sweep away thousands of troops.</p><p>But unfortunately, he still didn’t hit the other party.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>At this time, Yun Yan shouted and flew toward the canyon in front of her.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other three followed Yun Xi and ran in that direction.</p><p>However, before she could run halfway, a terrifying sword light stabbed toward Yun Xi’s head. Yun Xi’s pupils shrank, and she suddenly stopped. She swept her long spear up and blocked the sword with a clang.</p><p>But at the same time, there was a sword radiance that was aimed at Yun Feng from behind.</p><p>Yun Feng roared and slashed his sword backward. With a clang, he blocked the attack.</p><p>However, their expressions became even uglier.</p><p>“Two, there are two assassins from the thousand-kill mansion!”</p><p>Yun Kai shouted, his face pale.</p><p>One assassin was already very difficult to deal with, but now, there were two of them.</p><p>Huala!</p><p>At this moment, black wings spread open on Lu Ming’s back. With a flap, Lu Ming soared into the sky and left Yun Xi and the others, flying into the distance.</p><p>“Damn it, this bastard is so afraid of death that he wants to escape alone!”</p><p>Yun Kai roared.</p><p>Lu Ming’s face was cold. Without saying a word, he flapped his black wings rapidly and flew forward at top speed. In the blink of an eye, he disappeared from the sight of Yun Xi, Yun Kai, and the others.</p><p>“He’s a coward. If I knew this would happen, I wouldn’t have brought him along!”</p><p>Yun Kai said.</p><p>Yun Feng’s and Yun que’s expressions were also rather unsightly.</p><p>“There’s one less assassin. One of them has been lured away by Lu Ming!”</p><p>At this moment, Yun Xi spoke.</p><p>Indeed, the assassin at the back seemed to have disappeared. Only the assassin in front was still trying to kill them.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
