Behind him, the demonic blade automatically unsheathed, and the terrifying blade light slashed towards Xue ningxin.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Xue ningxin roared and transformed into her true form. She opened her mouth and spat out a stream of ice and snow, which rushed toward the saber Light.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>An intense collision occurred, and Xue ningxin’s slender body trembled as she retreated.</p><p>Xue ningxin had been seriously injured in the last battle. It was impossible for her to recover in such a short time. With her injured body, she was at a disadvantage from the beginning of the fight with mo he.</p><p>“Splitting devil blade!”</p><p>The demonic blade in mo he’s hand merged with the domain all over his body and he slashed out again.</p><p>The splitting demonic blade was the ultimate technique of the Tian Yu demonic sect. It was said to be able to split all things with one blade. It was extremely terrifying. Anything would be split apart by the splitting demonic blade.</p><p>Snowflakes were condensed around Xue ningxin. The snowflakes danced in the air and were extremely sharp. They cut through the air and made a terrible whistling sound as they flew toward the splitting Demon Blade.</p><p>However, when the snowflakes came into contact with the splitting demonic blade, they seemed to have received a terrifying shock and exploded.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The endless snowflakes collided with the demonic blade, creating a metallic sound. The snowflakes crumbled, but the demonic blade’s power also weakened rapidly.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>However, mo he’s demonic Qi was boiling, and he slashed again.</p><p>Then, he slashed again.</p><p>One slash after another, each slash was extremely terrifying, as if it was going to split the sky.</p><p>Xue ningxin’s Dragon Claw stepped in the air and pounced forward, engaging in a fierce confrontation with mo he.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Terrifying rumbles continued to be heard as the two of them exchanged dozens of blows.</p><p>Gradually, Xue ningxin was no match for him. Her injuries flared up, and it was difficult for her to use her full combat strength.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The Dragon scales were cut open and fell everywhere. On Xue ningxin’s body, there were many deep and long wounds, and her white body was stained with blood.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Mo he’s demonic blade pierced through Xue ningxin’s attack and went for her head, trying to cut her head off.</p><p>Xue ningxin quickly retreated, but she was still a step too late. A wound was left on her forehead.</p><p>Xue ningxin was already seriously injured, and now she was even more injured. Her combat power was getting weaker and weaker, and she was no match for mo he at all.</p><p>“Senior Sister, step down from the fighting ring!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Xue ningxin.</p><p>If this continued, Xue ningxin would be in danger.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Xue ningxin roared loudly. She was a little unwilling. After exchanging another blow with mo he, she turned around and left.</p><p>“If you want to leave, then stay!”</p><p>Mo he said coldly. The demonic Qi from her body was even more terrifying. She shot up into the sky and slashed out with her demonic blade. Eight blade lights slashed down, blocking Xue ningxin’s path.</p><p>Xue ningxin’s dragon claws stepped on the ground, and the ground was suddenly covered with a layer of ice and snow. Ice swords rushed out one after another, rushing toward the demonic blades.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The sound of a collision rang out. Unfortunately, Xue ningxin’s combat strength had declined. For a moment, she could not break the demonic blade at all. Instead, the demonic blade left a deep wound on her body, almost cutting off one of the Dragon claws.</p><p>“You won’t be able to escape. You’ll definitely die today. Devil Dragon Seal!”</p><p>die! mo he said coldly. He formed a seal with his hands, and a black demonic Dragon flew out with a roar, charging at Xue ningxin.</p><p>Two dragons, one black and one white, were fighting on the fighting ring. Then, mo he attacked Xue ningxin with the splitting demonic blade. After a few moves, Xue ningxin’s injuries became even more serious.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>In the end, Xue ningxin let out a loud roar, and her true dragon body rapidly shrank. Then, a layer of ice crystals covered her body, making her look like an ice sword.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The ‘ice sword’ continued to attack, clashing with mo he’s demonic blade. Finally, it rushed out of the range of the demonic blade and rushed to the edge of the fighting ring. At this time, the ice crystals covering Xue ningxin’s body also collapsed.</p><p>Xue ningxin’s breath became even weaker. With a step of her Dragon Claw, her body rushed out of the fighting ring and fell down.</p><p>At this moment, she heaved a sigh of relief and quickly restrained her aura.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>However, at this moment, mo he roared and stood at the edge of the fighting ring. His eyes were ferocious and full of cold killing intent. He slashed out a demonic blade towards Xue ningxin’s head.</p><p>When Xue ningxin fell off the fighting ring, it meant that the battle was over. Therefore, she had completely let down her guard and retracted her Zhen Yuan. However, she did not expect that mo he would be so despicable that he would attack again and make a fatal move on Xue ningxin.</p><p>Xue ningxin had no time to dodge this move.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>On the platform, Lu Ming let out a loud roar. The vital essence in his body was boiling, and the black wings on his back suddenly stretched out. With a flap, he appeared beside Xue ningxin. He flapped his black wings and destroyed the demonic blade.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what are you doing? Interfering in the middle, using a holy weapon, and breaking the rules!”</p><p>Seeing that his saber was blocked by Lu Ming, mo he’s eyes flashed with dissatisfaction and he shouted angrily.</p><p>“Shut up. Who is the one who broke the rules? My Senior Sister has already rushed out of the fighting stage and her feet have already touched the ground, which means that she has lost. This battle has already ended, but you still continue to kill her. Is it you who has broken the rules, or am I the one who has?”</p><p>Lu Ming stared at mo he, his eyes very cold.</p><p>Just now, if he hadn’t been staring at the fighting ring and noticed that something was wrong, he would have immediately used his Saint weapon and rushed out. Xue ningxin would have been in real danger.</p><p>“Oh? Had she already landed on the ground? I didn’t see it just now!”</p><p>Mo he quibbled.</p><p>Lu Ming did not say anything. He just stared at mo he, his eyes revealing an extremely cold killing intent.</p><p>He must kill this mo he!</p><p>“Senior Sister, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming helped Xue ningxin to the stands.</p><p>“Junior Brother, thank you for earlier!”</p><p>At this moment, Xue ningxin had already returned to her human form, her face a little pale.</p><p>“Senior Sister, you don’t have to be so polite. I will kill mo he and avenge you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“I believe in you, Junior Brother!”</p><p>Xue ningxin smiled and swallowed a healing pill to begin healing her injuries. Lu Ming, on the other hand, returned to the platform.</p><p>The challenge continued.</p><p>As expected, when it was the desire poison sect’s turn, one of their experts challenged Tian Chui.</p><p>The desire poison sect, like the sky demon sect, also had two top experts.</p><p>Previously, Wu Qian Du had been killed by Lu Ming, and there was only one left. The desire poison sect clearly hated Lu Ming to the core and wanted to kill Tian Chui to avenge Wu Qian Du.</p><p>However, Tian Chui’s injuries were slightly better than Xue ningxin’s. Furthermore, Tian Chui cultivated the berserk dragon body, which had a strong defense. The opponent did not cause too much damage to Tian Chui.</p><p>However, Tian Chui was still injured and was no match for his opponent. After exchanging more than a hundred moves, he was knocked down from the fighting ring.</p><p>With Tian Chui’s defeat, Lu Ming was the only one left in Dragon God Valley.</p><p>Countless gazes fell on the platform of Dragon God Valley, on Lu Ming alone.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming was the only one left in Dragon God Valley. How would he fight?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
