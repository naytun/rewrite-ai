The sense of danger that the stone crown gave him was too strong.</p><p>...</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>With a single thought, the Holy weapon Shield flew out again and blocked in front of him.</p><p>At the same time, he continued to fly forward.</p><p>“Stay here!”</p><p>Mo he roared with anger.</p><p>He did not expect that he would kill two Tian Yu demon sect disciples after intercepting Lu Ming. His killing intent towards Lu Ming grew even stronger.</p><p>The demonic blade burst forth and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes as he covered his body with the black wings.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Shi Guan’s spear of divine punishment struck the shield and sent it flying. It then continued to strike the black wings. Lu Ming’s body trembled and he was sent flying. Blood trickled from his mouth.</p><p>The stone Crown’s attack was simply too powerful. If he didn’t have two Saint weapons protecting him, he wouldn’t have been able to block it.</p><p>“So many Saint weapons! Who’s that guy? he has so many Saint weapons!”</p><p>In the distance, there were some onlookers who were staring at Lu Ming with burning eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming had too many holy weapons on him. He took out three in a row.</p><p>“Can you avoid death by using a Saint weapon? Today, you’ll still die. Kill!”</p><p>Shi Guan shouted. He was bathed in holy light and charged at Lu Ming with the spear of divine punishment in his hand. He was like a god.</p><p>Shi Guan was definitely a rare heaven’s favorite of the Tian Shen sect. Although he was far from being a deity, he was still very terrifying.</p><p>At this rate, even if Lu Ming had the protection of his holy weapon, he would not be able to withstand more than a few attacks.</p><p>“Chirp, chirp …”</p><p>Unknowingly, the bubble appeared on Lu Ming’s shoulder. It waved its small claws and opened a space-time Tunnel. Lu Ming rushed in without hesitation. The next moment, he was thousands of miles away.</p><p>Then, with a flap of his black wings, Lu Ming flew away at top speed.</p><p>the space-time domain, damn it!</p><p>The stone crown roared in anger and chased after Lu Ming at high speed.</p><p>However, in front of them, Lu Ming made the bubble open another space-time Tunnel. This time, Lu Ming entered and his figure disappeared.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Shi Guan went mad. His anger soared to the sky, and his killing intent was as cold as the winter snow.</p><p>“This kid escaped again!”</p><p>Mo he’s eyes were also very cold.</p><p>“Shi Guan, this man is from the Dragon God Valley!”</p><p>Mo he’s voice sounded.</p><p>“Dragon God Valley? Hmph, we must kill all the people of Dragon God Valley in this conference!”</p><p>Shi Guan said coldly. He turned into a ray of light and left.</p><p>“Lu Ming!</p><p>Mo he gritted his teeth. His eyes were as cold as a poisonous snake’s. Then, he left.</p><p>Lu Ming was running wildly in the grey Mountains.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had asked bubbles to open a space-time Tunnel and they appeared in the Cang mountains.</p><p>The Cang mountains ‘terrain was complex and the ancient trees towered into the sky. Naturally, the stone crown lost track of Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming ran for a while in the grey Mountains before he found a remote place and released Tian Chui and Xue ningxin.</p><p>“Ninth Junior Brother, are you alright?”</p><p>Tian Chui and Xue ningxin looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“I’m fine. I’ve already shaken them off!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>f * ck, a Lv 9 martial Royal realm expert is chasing us. If I increase my cultivation by another two levels, I’ll definitely kill him with my hammer!</p><p>Tian Chui unhappily said.</p><p>“Ninth Junior Brother, it’s all thanks to you this time!”</p><p>Xue ningxin said.</p><p>She and Tian Chui were not adept at speed. If not for Lu Ming’s Grotto-heaven treasure, they would not have been able to escape.</p><p>I didn’t expect ninth Junior Brother to even have a Grotto-heaven treasure!</p><p>Tian Chui grinned.</p><p>“Are Grotto-heaven treasures very rare?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>of course it’s rare. A Grotto-heaven treasure is like a small world of its own. Only a great emperor can make it, and it also requires rare materials!</p><p>Tian Chui said.</p><p>“Only great emperors can refine it?”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>He had originally thought that Grotto-heaven treasures were not rare in the yuan continent. It seemed that treasures obtained from the battle of Providence were all extremely rare.</p><p>“Let’s take a rest here!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Before this, they had all suffered some injuries. Although they were not serious, they still needed to recover.</p><p>Tian Chui and Xue ningxin both nodded.</p><p>The three of them sat cross-legged and meditated. An hour later, Lu Ming had fully recovered from the minor injuries he had suffered earlier.</p><p>“Where are we going now?”</p><p>Tian Chui asked.</p><p>let’s go to the Dragon God valley station. Every sect has a station in the Cang Mountain for their disciples to stay in. There are sage realm elders there. The people of the tianshen sect will not dare to be arrogant at the Dragon God valley station!</p><p>Xue ningxin said.</p><p>Lu Ming and Tian Chui naturally had no objections.</p><p>Then, Xue ningxin led the way, and the three of them went to the Dragon God Valley’s station.</p><p>Very quickly, a large building appeared in front of them. There were many palaces built on the mountainside, looking very majestic.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two took out their Dragon God Valley disciples ‘tokens, and they were naturally unimpeded.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>A crisp sound was heard. Lu Ming looked in the direction of the sound and a smile appeared on his face.</p><p>“Ying Ying, brother Qiu!”</p><p>Lu Ming called out.</p><p>It was Qiu Ying Ying and Qiu Hao. The two of them walked towards Lu Ming with smiles on their faces.</p><p>“Yingying, I haven’t seen you for a while. Your cultivation has improved a lot!”</p><p>Lu Ming sized up Qiu Ying Ying and smiled.</p><p>After not seeing her for a while, Qiu Ying Ying’s cultivation had already reached the third level of the martial Royal realm. This was beyond Lu Ming’s expectations.</p><p>Qiu Hao, on the other hand, seemed to have just broken through to Lv 2 martial Royal realm.</p><p>in the Emperor Cang Mystic realm, I obtained an inheritance and joined the Ice Dragon Valley. I was chosen by an elder of the Ice Dragon Valley and was accepted as a disciple. That’s why my cultivation level has improved so quickly!</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying explained.</p><p>“Congratulations!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled, feeling happy for Qiu Yingying.</p><p>They were friends, and since Qiu Ying Ying had a good encounter, he was naturally happy.</p><p>“Who are these two?”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying looked at Tian Chui and Xue ningxin.</p><p>this is my senior brother and Senior Sister from Cloud Dragon Valley!</p><p>Lu Ming introduced them to Qiu Yingying.</p><p>Both parties greeted each other.</p><p>“Yingying, when did you guys arrive?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>we’ve been here for ten days. Big brother and I wanted to find you to come with us, but we heard that you left long ago when we arrived at Cloud Dragon Valley. Why are you only here now? ”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying asked curiously.</p><p>“I was delayed on the way!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and did not explain further.</p><p>“I’ll take you to get a house. You just need to register.”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying said. She seemed very happy to see Lu Ming.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming and the other two each received a room and went back to their own rooms. Qiu Ying Ying and the others also bade farewell and left.</p><p>Lu Ming returned to his room and continued to channel and regulate his breathing.</p><p>Right now, there were still twenty days before the start of the treasure sealing assembly, so it was still early.</p><p>In the next few days, Lu Ming and the others were cultivating. Shi Guan did not find the heavenly God sect’s encampment.</p><p>Three days later, Xue ningxin and Tian Chui came to look for Lu Ming together.</p><p>“To buy something?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little surprised.</p><p>Xue ningxin and Tian Chui had come to find him with the purpose of going shopping together.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
