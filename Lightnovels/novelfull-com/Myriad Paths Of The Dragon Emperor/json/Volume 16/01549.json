The Tian Shen sect can’t afford to lose. If you had said so earlier, we wouldn’t have fought with you and would have given the first place to you!</p><p>that’s right. Why don’t the other sects just not participate and announce to the world that your tianshen sect will be the number one sect in the world!</p><p>The other disciples of Dragon God Valley also shouted and glared at the deity and the sage realm elder of the deity sect.</p><p>They had directly assumed that the divine Son wanted to kill Lu Ming because he had won first place in the small meeting, so the deity sect wanted to kill him.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>The Son of God’s face was cold as he shouted. His voice was like thunder, and his terrifying aura pressed down on the disciples of Dragon God Valley. The disciples ‘faces changed, and they felt as if a mountain was pressing on their bodies, making it difficult to breathe.</p><p>I, the Son of God, never need a reason to kill. But today, I’ll give you a reason!</p><p>it’s because they did something they shouldn’t have done, ” the Son of God said indifferently. as such, they must be killed. Even without today’s small meeting, they would still be dead!</p><p>“Hehe, What do you mean you shouldn’t have done? didn’t you just let a few people whose cultivation levels were far lower than yours take away your treasures? Son of God, you still have the face to come and kill!”</p><p>A deep voice rang out. In the void, a purple light flashed, and a figure appeared in the sky.</p><p>Zi Feng!</p><p>The demon of Dragon God Valley, Zi Feng!</p><p>“You want to stop me?”</p><p>The Son of God looked at Zi Feng coldly.</p><p>if you want to kill the people of Dragon God Valley, you have to fight!</p><p>Zi Feng replied.</p><p>“You’re not my match!”</p><p>The Son of God said coldly.</p><p>“It’s been three years since we last fought.”</p><p>Zi Feng opened his mouth, his eyes revealing an intense battle intent.</p><p>“Oh, really? Then I’ll deal with you first!”</p><p>The Son of God was very powerful. He took a step forward, and the world rumbled. Terrifying Saint light soared into the sky, turning into a snow-white Saint blade, slashing toward Zi Feng.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Zi Feng gave a loud roar, and the Dragon’s roars reverberated. On his body, purple light flourished. On his skin, dense purple dragon scales appeared. On his forehead, two dragon horns actually emerged.</p><p>And Zi Feng’s hands even transformed into dragon claws.</p><p>With a furious roar, Zi Feng rushed toward the Son of God, his claws continuously grabbing out, forcefully shattering the Son of God’s Saint blade.</p><p>“Holy light slash!”</p><p>The Son of God’s expression was still calm. He clenched his fist in the air, and the Holy Light condensed into a Holy blade again, slashing toward Zi Feng.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two geniuses continued to fight in the sky, exchanging more than ten moves.</p><p>The sky seemed to be divided into white and purple, and the heavy pressure made it hard for people to breathe.</p><p>how terrifying! Is this the combat strength of the top ten geniuses? ”</p><p>it’s too shocking. I’ve seen half-Saints fight before, but they’re not this strong. This kind of combat power can easily kill ordinary half-Saints, right? ”</p><p>how terrifying! How can anyone below the Saint realm be so powerful? ”</p><p>Many people exclaimed in shock.</p><p>Even the elders of the Saint realm looked serious.</p><p>Obviously, even the Saint stage powerhouses had to take him seriously.</p><p>The sky was completely covered by white and purple light. Two figures were crisscrossing, and Dragon roars could be heard from time to time.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>All of a sudden, there was a terrible vibration in the sky. A figure retreated dozens of steps in the void before coming to a stop.</p><p>It was Zi Feng!</p><p>At this time, a deep blade mark appeared on Zi Feng’s body, straight through his bones. There was a terrifying power of holy light that was corroding Zi Feng’s body unceasingly.</p><p>A trace of fresh blood seeped out from the corner of Zi Feng’s mouth, his breathing somewhat weak.</p><p>Could it be that Zi Feng lost?</p><p>High in the sky, the divine Son strolled out. His clothes were clean and his aura was steady. He didn’t seem to have experienced a great battle.</p><p>Everyone’s hearts trembled. It seemed like the Divine Child had won, and it didn’t seem like it was a difficult win.</p><p>The divine Son was worthy of being the head of the Azure state’s ten great monstrous talents. Similarly being one of the ten great monstrous talents, Zi Feng did not look like he was the divine son’s match at all.</p><p>“I’ve said it before, you’re no match for me. Today, I’m going to kill the three of them, and no one can save them!”</p><p>The Son of God spoke with great confidence.</p><p>No one could save whoever he wanted to kill!</p><p>This was the domineering nature of the Son of God.</p><p>Initially, if he wanted to kill Lu Ming and the other two, he could have chosen to do it somewhere else. That way, there would be less resistance and it would be easier.</p><p>However, he had chosen this place because he was so overbearing. He wanted to kill Lu Ming and the other two in front of everyone to build his reputation.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming burst out laughing. His laughter was filled with mockery.</p><p>“What are you laughing at?”</p><p>The Son of God said coldly.</p><p>I’m laughing at you, Son of God. You want to kill me because you’re afraid. Why do you have to find so many reasons to make me look good? ”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed out loud.</p><p>I’m scared. What a joke. What do you have that I’m scared of? ”</p><p>The godchild said.</p><p>“Because of my potential. Today, you saw my potential and are afraid that I will catch up to you in the future. You are afraid that I will take first place in the treasure fixing assembly three years later, so you are afraid. You are afraid of my potential, so today, you want to kill me to avoid future trouble!”</p><p>Lu Ming said loudly.</p><p>These words made many people’s hearts tremble.</p><p>The potential that Lu Ming had displayed this time was indeed shocking.</p><p>With a cultivation of Lv 4 Martial Emperor realm, he had defeated and killed 10 top-notch experts in a row and won first place in the treasure auction. In the history of the Azure region, there had never been such a shocking move since the treasure auction.</p><p>Lu Ming indeed had the potential to threaten the divine Son.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s cultivation level was still low, would he be able to become the divine son’s opponent in another six or nine years?</p><p>Could it be that the Son of God was not afraid at all?</p><p>Many people had such thoughts.</p><p>The Son of God’s face was cold. “You’ll never be a match for me. In the Azure continent, I have no one who can match me. My enemies are outside of the Azure continent!”</p><p>Said the Son of God, still filled with confidence.</p><p>In the Azure continent, there was no one in the same generation as him that was worthy of his attention. He had already set his sights outside of the Azure continent and was contending with those Supreme geniuses. In fact, only those terrifying geniuses from Emperor-ranked powers were his opponents.</p><p>“Since you’re so confident, then fine, I’ll challenge you now. Three years later, at the treasure sealing assembly, you and I will fight to the death, until one of us is dead. Do you dare!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted loudly, his voice spreading throughout the entire venue.</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was also filled with strong confidence.</p><p>He had also stepped on the corpses of countless geniuses to get to where he was. He also had the confidence of being invincible.</p><p>The divine Son came from a better background. He had been cultivating in the heavenly God sect, a big sect in the yuan continent, since he was young. The cultivation environment was much better than Lu Ming’s. Moreover, the divine Son was at least seven to eight years older than Lu Ming.</p><p>Now, the Son of God’s cultivation was much higher than his, which was why he could look down on him from high above.</p><p>However, he was confident that in a few years, he would be able to catch up to the Son of God and stand on equal footing with him. He would not be looked down upon by him like he was now.</p><p>“Goading is useless Against Me!” The Son of God said coldly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
