Tian Chui’s attack was like a madman, and the burly man was completely unable to resist. He was bombarded by Tian Chui until his mouth was full of blood. Finally, Tian Chui’s hammer smashed him to the ground, causing a huge pit to appear.</p><p>...</p><p>spare me, spare me!</p><p>The burly man’s eyes swept over the crowd and realized that all the people he had brought with him had been killed. He screamed in fear.</p><p>He knew that he had kicked an iron plate. These people were all monsters.</p><p>“Just now, you wanted to take my space-breaking flying shuttle and kill us. Now, you want me to let you go? What a joke!”</p><p>Tian Chui revealed a sinister smile.</p><p>The burly man’s heart turned cold. He shouted, ” I want to take your space-breaking flying shuttle for a reason. It’s because we found a place where a precious treasure has appeared. However, only the space-breaking flying shuttle can enter!</p><p>“The birth of a great treasure?”</p><p>Tian Chui, Xue ningxin, and Lu Ming were stunned.</p><p>“That’s right. As long as you promise to let me go, I’ll tell you the location of the treasure!”</p><p>The burly man shouted.</p><p>“Oh? Really, don’t lie to me!”</p><p>Tian Chui’s eyes gleamed with a sharp glint.</p><p>“I can swear that I won’t lie to you, but you have to promise not to kill me!”</p><p>The burly man said.</p><p>“Alright, I promise not to kill you. I swear!”</p><p>Immediately, Tian Chui swore that if the burly man told him, he would not kill him.</p><p>about half a day’s journey from here, there’s a Lake called Dragon Lake. It’s said that powerful true dragons live there. Some time ago, a Dragon’s Roar came from the Dragon Lake, and it was deafening!</p><p>The burly man said.</p><p>“There’s a powerful true dragon living there?”</p><p>The three of them were surprised and curious.</p><p>One had to know that one of the three of them was a pure-blooded true dragon.</p><p>“What’s the relationship between the Dragon roar of Dragon Lake and the space-breaking flying shuttle?”</p><p>Tian Chui asked.</p><p>because there’s a strong murderous aura around the Dragon Lake. It’s hard to get in without a strong defensive treasure. The sky breaking shuttle has amazing defensive power and is fast. It can definitely get in safely.</p><p>The burly man said.</p><p>“Now, I’ve told you everything I know. Can you let me go?”</p><p>The burly man said.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>As soon as the burly man finished speaking, a fist struck his dantian, penetrating it and shattering his spiritual spirit.</p><p>It was Xue ningxin!</p><p>“You guys, don’t keep your word!”</p><p>The burly man roared, his voice filled with unwillingness.</p><p>“I promised not to kill you, but my Junior Sister didn’t!”</p><p>Tian Chui laughed maliciously.</p><p>The burly man’s life force dissipated unwillingly.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled slightly and did not mind. In the world of martial arts, the weak were prey to the strong, especially in yuanlu. A soft-hearted person would not go far.</p><p>The devouring power burst forth and directly devoured the burly man’s blood essence.</p><p>“Devouring power, what a powerful secret skill!”</p><p>Tian Chui cast a glance at Lu Ming.</p><p>He thought that Lu Ming was using a secret skill. Lu Ming smiled and did not explain.</p><p>there’s a Dragon’s Roar coming from Dragon Lake. Junior Brother and Junior Sister, do you want to go and take a look? ”</p><p>Tian Chui asked.</p><p>“I was thinking the same thing!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Of course I’m going to take a look!” Xue ningxin said.</p><p>“Alright, haha, then let’s go!”</p><p>Tian Chui laughed.</p><p>The three of them boarded the space-breaking flying shuttle, which then flew North at high speed.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged at the side, refining the energy in his body.</p><p>More than a dozen experts at the fourth level Martial Emperor realm and above, including one at the seventh level Martial Emperor realm, had rich energy that continuously transformed into Lu Ming’s vital essence. Lu Ming’s vital essence continued to become more and more powerful.</p><p>Not long after, when the energy was refined, Lu Ming’s cultivation level increased and he reached the later stage of the third level Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>At the same time, they had arrived at their destination, Dragon Lake.</p><p>In front of him, the world was filled with a thick black mist. This mist was the evil Qi.</p><p>If a martial artist entered, he would be corroded by the murderous aura. At best, he would go crazy. At worst, his soul would be obliterated and he would die on the spot. It was extremely powerful.</p><p>“Look, there are other people!”</p><p>Through the crystal glass, they saw some figures standing outside the murderous aura and watching from a distance.</p><p>Some people’s gazes turned to them, flashing with greed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A few figures streaked across the sky and flew towards them.</p><p>One of them was even more overbearing. He waved his hand, forming a huge palm that grabbed at the shuttle.</p><p>It was clear that they were the same as the people they had met before, wanting to seize their space-breaking flying shuttle.</p><p>“Hmph, I’m too lazy to play with you guys!”</p><p>Tian Chui coldly snorted, urging his flying shuttle forward. With a “Chi” sound, the flying shuttle rushed forward, destroying the palm and directly rushing into the evil Qi.</p><p>The few of them stopped unwillingly.</p><p>The space-breaking shuttle flew into the area of evil Qi and rushed straight forward.</p><p>“Look, there are other space-breaking flying shuttles!”</p><p>Xue ningxin said as she looked outside.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest saw it too. Not far away from them, there was also a space-breaking flying shuttle flying forward.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this time, a Dragon’s Roar came from the front, even passing through the space-breaking flying shuttle.</p><p>The roar of a Dragon!</p><p>what a domineering Dragon’s Roar. However, this sound doesn’t seem to be made by a living true dragon!</p><p>Xue ningxin said as she separated them seriously.</p><p>“It’s not the sound of a living true dragon?”</p><p>Tian Chui and Lu Ming raised their eyebrows.</p><p>They knew that some true dragons would leave their imprints after death and let out Dragon roars. They, for example, could also let out Dragon roars when they awakened the true dragon bloodline and condensed the true dragon combat body.</p><p>Ordinary people wouldn’t be able to tell the difference, but Xue ningxin was a true dragon, so it wasn’t strange for her to be able to tell.</p><p>“Could this be a cave abode left behind by a true dragon after it died?”</p><p>The three of them guessed as they controlled the flying shuttle to continue forward.</p><p>After a while, they finally flew out of the place filled with murderous aura. In front of them, a huge Lake appeared. At first glance, it was like a vast ocean with no end in sight.</p><p>Moreover, there was no murderous aura here.</p><p>“So many people!”</p><p>Through the crystal glass, they looked outside and saw many figures on the lake.</p><p>Some people were flying above the lake, as if they were looking for something.</p><p>It seemed that many people had heard of this news. Some of them were very young and were likely geniuses of the top sects.</p><p>The three of them left the space-breaking flying shuttle. The space-breaking flying shuttle shrank and was put away by Tian Chui.</p><p>He looked around and saw no less than a hundred people.</p><p>Some people glanced at them and then ignored them.</p><p>“There doesn’t seem to be anything here!”</p><p>Tian Chui said.</p><p>The three of them flew over the lake, looking at the calm surface of the lake as if there was nothing there.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Someone launched an attack into the lake, stirring up thousands of waves.</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>Suddenly, a huge pincer stretched out from the waves and clamped at the man. The man screamed as his body was cut in two. His blood splattered on the lake, dyeing it red.</p><p>The waves churned, and everyone could see that it was a giant lobster. Its entire body was fiery red, and its aura was powerful.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
