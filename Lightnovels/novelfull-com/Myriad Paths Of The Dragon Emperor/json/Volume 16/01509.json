Do you want to monopolize it? ”</p><p>A Lv 9 martial Royal realm elder shouted angrily.</p><p>...</p><p>“Get lost! If you don’t get lost, die!”</p><p>The Son of God said coldly, his voice abnormally overbearing.</p><p>“Hehe, Divine Child, it won’t be that easy for you to take over this true dragon for yourself!”</p><p>Wang Jian sneered.</p><p>The Son of God took a look, his eyes cold, but he didn’t say anything.</p><p>Strength spoke for itself, and he could not ignore Wang Jian’s strength.</p><p>The others ‘expressions were ugly. It was difficult for them to fight against the two monstrous figures, Wang Jian and the divine Son.</p><p>everyone, a Saint realm Dragon corpse is extremely rare. Since we’ve seen it, how can we not take a share? How about we join forces? ”</p><p>The LV 9 Martial Emperor realm old man said.</p><p>“Alright, I agree!”</p><p>“I also agree!”</p><p>The others voiced their opinions.</p><p>More than a dozen experts flashed and gathered together to fight against the divine Son and Wang Jian.</p><p>“A bunch of motley crew, overestimating their own abilities!”</p><p>The Son of God said coldly and stepped toward the true Dragon’s corpse.</p><p>He wanted to put away the divine Dragon’s corpse directly. As long as he put away the true Dragon’s corpse, no one would be able to compete with him.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of a sword rang out, and Wang Jian also moved. How could he let the divine Son monopolize it?</p><p>“Do it!”</p><p>The other experts also moved. There were 13 of them in total. Three of them were at the ninth level of the martial Royal realm, while the rest were at the seventh or eighth level. Even a half-Saint expert couldn’t ignore them.</p><p>The three parties pounced at the true dragon at the same time.</p><p>As for Lu Ming and the other two, one of them stood at the side of the hall and watched coldly.</p><p>With their strength, they couldn’t do anything at all, and the Divine Child and the others had directly ignored them.</p><p>“Get lost! Get lost!”</p><p>The Son of God shouted a few times, and the Holy Light condensed into a Divine Blade. He instantly slashed out a dozen blades, aiming at Wang Jian and the dozen people.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sword light exploded and clashed with the divine knife. The space was filled with the sound of fierce confrontation, and the sword Qi and knife light were unrestrained.</p><p>The dozen or so experts were also doing their best to block the divine son’s blade light.</p><p>The divine Son seized the opportunity to grab the true Dragon’s corpse, trying to put it into his storage ring.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>At the same time, Wang Jian also grabbed a big hand and collided with the Son of God’s big hand.</p><p>“It’s ours!”</p><p>The dozen or so people charged forward with all their might and clawed at the Dragon corpse.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, an earth-shattering dragon roar burst out from the Dragon Hall, forming a terrifying sound wave that rolled out in all directions.</p><p>The Son of God and Wang Jian’s expressions changed slightly. They each slashed out a blade light and sword Qi, breaking the sound waves.</p><p>Other than the two Lv 9 martial Royal realm experts who were able to withstand the sound wave, the rest of the people were forced to retreat. Some of them even spat out blood.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two also tried their best to block it. However, they were far away and the power of the sound waves was greatly reduced. They blocked it more easily.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Everyone present was shocked.</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar came from the Dragon coffin. Could it be that the true dragon was not dead?</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Then, another Dragon’s Roar came from the Dragon coffin.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Then, a banging sound came from the Dragon coffin. The Black Dragon actually stood up and roared. It looked around, and its huge dragon eyes revealed a ferocious light.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>“The Saint realm true dragon didn’t die?”</p><p>no, the Saint realm true dragon is dead. This is just the inextinguishable mark of a Saint realm true dragon!</p><p>Many people spoke out one after another. The last voice made everyone’s heart tremble. They sensed carefully and found that there was no life aura on the true dragon. It had indeed died many years ago.</p><p>The true dragon could move only because of a trace of an inextinguishable brand.</p><p>“What’s the point of resisting when you’re already dead? It’s destined to be mine today!”</p><p>The Son of God said coldly. The Holy Light on his body became even more dazzling. He clenched his fist in the air and a long spear appeared in his hand.</p><p>Many people were shocked. This was the secret art of the divine sect, the spear of divine punishment.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The Son of God shouted, and the spear of divine punishment pierced through the void toward the true Dragon’s corpse.</p><p>As long as the immortal mark of the Saint realm true dragon was destroyed, the Saint realm true dragon would be completely dead.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The black true dragon roared in anger and struck out with its claw.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Dragon Claw and the Son of God’s spear of divine punishment collided with a violent boom. The Black Dragon trembled, and the Son of God was forced to take two steps back.</p><p>After all, a Saint realm true dragon had been dead for many years, and a trace of its mark couldn’t have the battle-power it had when it was alive.</p><p>On the other side, sword light burst out and Wang Jian also appeared.</p><p>The black true dragon wagged its tail and blocked Wang Jian’s sword light.</p><p>Then, the Dragon’s horns glowed, and two black rays of light burst out, slashing toward the divine Son and Wang Jian.</p><p>The Son of God’s spear of divine punishment struck again, destroying the black light.</p><p>On the other side, Wang Jian had also destroyed the black light of the true dragon.</p><p>you’ve been dead for so many years, yet you still want to resist. Today, I’ll make you disappear completely!</p><p>The Son of God opened his mouth, and the space between his brows lit up. A small Pagoda flew out.</p><p>It was a small white jade Pagoda. As soon as it flew out, it expanded rapidly, emitting milky white holy light.</p><p>“Holy weapon!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The divine Son wielded his holy weapon, and with his cultivation base, he was able to control it with shocking power. The White jade Pagoda crushed down toward the Black Dragon.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The black true dragon roared angrily, and its Dragon Claw struck the small white jade Tower heavily, making an extremely violent roar.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The White jade Pagoda trembled, but the true Dragon’s corpse also trembled and retreated.</p><p>Then, the White jade Pagoda came crashing down again. Even though the true dragon roared repeatedly, it was still suppressed.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The black true dragon roared and actually abandoned the divine Son. It twisted its body and rushed into the sky above the hall.</p><p>It actually wanted to escape.</p><p>“You won’t be able to escape today!”</p><p>The Son of God waved his hand, and an inscription scroll appeared.</p><p>When the scroll was opened, the inscriptions on it glowed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A huge array appeared and suppressed the void.</p><p>“What a wonderful inscription scroll, it can actually stop the void!”</p><p>At the side of the hall, Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>The Divine Child’s inscription scroll was extremely wondrous. It could cut off the void and seal it. This way, the Black Dragon would have difficulty escaping.</p><p>Divine Son, you’re really generous. You’re even willing to take out an ancient inscription talisman scroll like the God prohibited void!</p><p>Wang Jian said.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>The Son of God snorted coldly and took a step forward. He appeared above the Black Dragon. The White jade Pagoda was about to press down again and completely destroy the mark of the Black Dragon.</p><p>“Bubble …”</p><p>At this moment, no one noticed that Lu Ming had sent a voice transmission to the bubble on his shoulder.</p><p>Then, the bubble opened its mouth and waved its little claws forward.</p><p>Kachaa! Kachaa!</p><p>Above the hall, the space that was sealed by the God prohibited void space inscription scroll started to shake like water. Then, it shattered like glass.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
