It was extremely precious, and very few people below the Saint realm had it.</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming had only encountered top geniuses who had holy weapons because they were heavily nurtured by their respective sects. Some of the smaller sects did not even have holy weapons. Even if some of them had holy weapons, they would be considered the sect’s most prized treasures.</p><p>Even in the 13 top sects of the Azure continent, most Lv 8 and Lv 9 martial emperors used King spiritual weapons. Many half-Saints even used King spiritual weapons instead of holy weapons.</p><p>“Myriad devil domain!”</p><p>On the other side, Xie nianqing shouted and spread out his domain. In his domain, there was a beautiful demoness sitting cross-legged, suppressing the surroundings.</p><p>An old man in the LV 9 Martial Emperor realm was enveloped by Xie nianqing’s all demons domain. He roared madly and was killed by Xie nianqing’s palm.</p><p>“Myriad devil domain? It seems that little official’s battle strength has become even more powerful after becoming a Martial Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He was happy for Xie nianqing.</p><p>No wonder he was accepted as a direct disciple by the sect master of the Tian Yu demon sect and became the saintess of the sect. Xie nianqing’s astral body was definitely a superior one. Lu Ming could even vaguely sense that there was a terrifying power hidden in Xie nianqing’s body.</p><p>While Lu Ming was thinking about this, Tian Chui and Xue ningxin had also killed one person each.</p><p>Of the seven to eight experts, only three remained.</p><p>“Go, go!”</p><p>The remaining three people were almost scared to death as they fled frantically.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two could not be bothered to chase after them. These people were obviously from small sects, so they did not take them to heart.</p><p>“We’ll split this section of Phoenix incense wood equally!”</p><p>Lu Ming grabbed the Phoenix-incense wood and condensed his vital essence into a blade. He divided the Phoenix-incense wood into four portions, one for each of them, and put it away.</p><p>“Could there be a huge Phoenix incense tree in the heavenly wind Plains?”</p><p>Tian Chui licked his lips, revealing a fiery light.</p><p>That section was obviously just a branch. If the branch was so big, how huge was the trunk?</p><p>the divine bird Phoenix lives in the heavenly wind Plains. Perhaps, it lives on the main branch of the Phoenix incense wood!</p><p>Lu Ming speculated.</p><p>Then, the four of them continued forward.</p><p>“Junior Sister!”</p><p>Not long after, a voice rang out, and Mo Yang flew over from the side.</p><p>Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, Tian Chui, and Xue ningxin all frowned. They had not expected to meet Mo Yang here.</p><p>“Junior Sister, I’ve finally found you!”</p><p>Mo Yang had a smile on his face as he flew over and looked at Xie nianqing with concern.</p><p>someone really doesn’t know what’s going on. Sister-in-law already told you to leave, so why did you still come here? ”</p><p>Tian Chui disdainfully said.</p><p>Mo Yang glanced at Tian Chui, a sharp glint in his eyes. If Xie nianqing had not been here, he would have already killed Tian Chui, Lu Ming, and the other two.</p><p>my Junior Sister is the saintess of the Tianyu demonic sect. I’ve been ordered to protect her. I must stay by her side!</p><p>Mo Yang said.</p><p>“Mo Yang, I don’t need your protection. Lu Ming will naturally protect me!” Xie nianqing frowned.</p><p>Junior Sister, I’m following master’s orders. I don’t dare to disobey. Otherwise, I’ll be punished when I go back. So, even if you drive me away, I’ll follow you!</p><p>Mo Yang said.</p><p>“F * ck, some people’s skin is even thicker than an elephant’s!”</p><p>Tian Chui unhappily said.</p><p>it’s not just an elephant. It’s even thicker than the city wall. I’ve seen shameless people, but I’ve never seen someone as shameless as him!</p><p>Xue ningxin followed.</p><p>“Shut up! If you dare to insult me again, I’ll kill you all!”</p><p>die! Mo Yang shouted. A violent aura spread out from his body, and the demonic Qi soared into the sky. The dense demonic Qi was like a burning flame.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Tian Chui and Xue ningxin were suppressed by this aura, and couldn’t help but take a few steps back.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming appeared in front of Tian Chui and Xue ningxin. He spread his black wings to resist Mo Yang’s aura.</p><p>Mo Yang was one of the top ten geniuses of the Azure region. His cultivation had long reached the half-Saint realm, and he was definitely not someone they could defeat.</p><p>Mo Yang, they’re my friends. If you want to touch them, you’ll have to do it over my dead body!</p><p>Xie nianqing appeared beside Lu Ming and glared at Mo Yang.</p><p>Mo Yang’s eyes were filled with flames of jealousy, as if they were about to burn.</p><p>His eyes flashed with a fierce light. He suddenly smiled and said,”Junior Sister is overthinking. They are your friends, why would I do anything to them? Let’s go, I’ll go with you. There might be some great treasures in the heavenly wind Plains!”</p><p>Xie nianqing looked at Mo Yang coldly. She was helpless. Mo Yang had insisted on following her.</p><p>With no one else in the group, they continued forward.</p><p>The heavenly wind plain was huge. They continued to travel for thousands of miles, passing through many huge tornadoes, and slowly entered the heavenly wind plain.</p><p>On the way, she heard the Phoenix cry a few more times, but it felt like the sound was getting softer and softer.</p><p>“Yi, look over there, there seems to be a piece of Phoenix incense wood!”</p><p>Suddenly, Mo Yang pointed in a direction.</p><p>Everyone looked over, and indeed, on the left, they saw a section of Phoenix incense wood.</p><p>There, there were huge, exposed boulders. The boulders were very smooth, probably because they had been worn out by the wind.</p><p>The Phoenix incense wood was right between the huge rocks.</p><p>Everyone rushed over. No one noticed the smug sneer in Mo Yang’s eyes, as well as the cold killing intent.</p><p>“Not good, there’s an ambush. Retreat!”</p><p>As they neared the Phoenix-incense wood, Lu Ming felt an inexplicable sense of danger. He roared and tried to pull Xie nianqing and the rest back.</p><p>But it was too late.</p><p>In a flash, at least a dozen figures rushed out from behind the boulders and surrounded Lu Ming and the five of them.</p><p>“Yu Sheng, the heaven deity sect, and the desire poison sect!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes swept across the room and he noticed that one of them was Yu Sheng.</p><p>As for the others, they weren’t young anymore. From their clothes, there were people from the heaven God sect and the desire poison sect.</p><p>“Lu Ming, this time, I’ll see how you die!”</p><p>Yu Sheng’s eyes were cold.</p><p>this brat killed so many of our people. He’s really seeking his own death!</p><p>A white-haired old man from the heavenly God sect coldly spoke. An extremely shocking aura erupted from his body.</p><p>Half-Saint!</p><p>Lu Ming, Tian Chui, Xue ningxin, and Xie nianqing’s expressions changed drastically.</p><p>The other party had dispatched a half-Saint expert.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Following that, a few more terrifying auras burst out. The terrifying pressure pressed down on Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Half-Saint, half-Saint again!</p><p>The deity sect and the Yu Du sect both had half-Saints!</p><p>There were three half-Saints in total!</p><p>Although the ninth level of the martial Royal realm was one level away from the half-Saint realm, the difference was huge. It was not as simple as one level.</p><p>Tian Chui and Xue ningxin, who were at the early stage of the LV 8 martial Royal realm, could even kill an ordinary peak Lv 9 martial Royal realm expert. However, they were no match for a half-Saint.</p><p>Not to mention, there were three half-Saints!</p><p>A year and a half ago, when Lu Ming returned to Dragon God Valley from the Cang mountains, he was besieged by evil spirit. Just a half-Saint had almost forced Lu Ming into a dead end.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
