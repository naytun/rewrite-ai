This time, there were ten light spots and ten King spiritual weapons.</p><p>The 17 Emperor spiritual weapons floated in the air, and the battle weapon Qi was extremely dense. It gathered on the battle axe, making the purple-shirted young man’s momentum extremely strong.</p><p>...</p><p>Kill! Kill! Kill!</p><p>The young man in purple shouted, his eyes filled with cold killing intent. He wanted to kill Lu Ming to save his face.</p><p>He took a step forward, and his spirit weapons circled around him. He swung his giant axe as if he could split the sky.</p><p>“You want to kill me?”</p><p>A sharp glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. More essential core surged into the flowing essence gloves. The flowing essence gloves glowed like a small sun.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A single punch could crush everything.</p><p>Thump! Thump! Thump!</p><p>Lu Ming and the other party exchanged three moves in a row. After each move, the other party had to take three steps back.</p><p>After three moves, the other party retreated nine steps.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming shouted and the power of the divine sword technique exploded. Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and two black swords shot out of his eyes and into the body of the young man in purple.</p><p>The other party’s body trembled, and his eyes lost focus for a moment.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming threw another punch.</p><p>This punch was as destructive as crushing dry weeds and smashing rotten wood. At the critical moment, although the other party used his battle axe to block, the strength he could muster was limited. Lu Ming’s punch sent his battle axe flying. He retreated rapidly and spat out large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming strode forward, wanting to defeat his opponent in one fell swoop.</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>The noble youth frowned and stepped forward with a cold light in his eyes.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This step seemed to shake the earth and the sky. A terrifying force rushed towards Lu Ming. Lu Ming’s expression changed and he threw a punch, but it was useless. It could not break through the force. When the force surged over, Lu Ming’s body slid back for thousands of meters.</p><p>“What’s wrong? A tag-team battle? If one doesn’t work, then two?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“A tag-team battle? Hehe, what a joke!”</p><p>The noble young man stood in the void with his hands behind his back. A terrifying pressure emanated from his body and pressed toward Lu Ming like a divine weapon that was about to break the sky and cut the world.</p><p>Lu Ming covered his entire body with the chaos Domain and resisted the pressure with all his might.</p><p>your combat strength is not bad, but you’re only at the sixth level of the martial Royal realm. You’re not worthy to fight me!</p><p>The distinguished young man said indifferently. His tone was filled with confidence and contempt for Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was not worthy to fight with him!</p><p>The Honorable young man then looked at the young man who was injured by Lu Ming and said, ” in the future, cultivate well and strive to break through. The next time you see this person, you will kill him with your own hands, understand? ”</p><p>“Understood, young master!”</p><p>The young man in purple bowed in response, his eyes filled with cold killing intent as he looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The noble young man retracted his aura and left.</p><p>Yes, as he had said, Lu Ming’s cultivation level was too low and he was not worthy of fighting with him. He was not even interested in fighting.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the noble young man and the two young men in purple disappeared from everyone’s sight.</p><p>At that moment, Yun Kai, Yun Feng, and the others looked at Lu Ming with fear in their eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming could actually defeat the eighth level martial Royal realm genius of the WAN family. His combat strength had exceeded their expectations.</p><p>For example, Yun Kai, whose cultivation was at the peak of the eighth level martial Royal realm, believed that he would not be able to defeat the geniuses of the WAN family who were at the same level as him. However, Lu Ming was able to defeat him, which meant that Lu Ming’s combat strength was above his.</p><p>Yun Xi looked at Lu Ming with a complicated gaze.</p><p>In a battle of the same level, he was no match for the WAN family’s geniuses, but Lu Ming could cross two levels and defeat the WAN family’s geniuses. His combat strength was truly unbelievable.</p><p>“Farewell!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming looked at Yun Xi and cupped his fists slightly, planning to leave alone.</p><p>It was more convenient for him to act alone.</p><p>“Lu Ming, the thousand-kill mansion was created by the thousand-kill Martial Emperor. It’s extremely powerful and has many experts. There’ll definitely be a lot of people from the thousand-kill mansion in the hundred clan battlefield. You have to be careful!”</p><p>In the end, Yun Xi could not bear it and reminded Lu Ming.</p><p>“Many thanks, I will be careful!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Lu Ming, there are cities built by the locals in the hundred clan battlefield. If you enter the city, the people from the thousand-kill mansion will be more or less apprehensive and won’t dare to go too far!</p><p>Yun Xi reminded him.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Not all of the hundred clan battlefield was filled with outsiders like them. There were some natives.</p><p>In reality, the natives weren’t pure natives. They were all people who had entered the hundred clan battlefield in the distant past. Some of them had stayed there forever and had never left. They had taken root in the hundred clan battlefield and reproduced.</p><p>As time passed, more and more people arrived at the hundred clan battlefield. These people were called the natives.</p><p>Moreover, the natives had grown up in the hundred clan battlefield. They were used to the chaotic laws in the world and could adapt to them. Therefore, some of the talented natives could break through to the Saint realm in the hundred clan battlefield without dying or going crazy because of the chaotic laws.</p><p>However, the hundred clan battlefield was very restrictive. That was why the strongest of the natives could only reach the bright Saint realm. It was almost impossible for them to reach the Supreme Saint realm.</p><p>These native Saints would build cities and forces in the hundred clan battlefield.</p><p>In these cities, it was forbidden to fight and kill. Therefore, if they violated this rule, the Saints of the local people might kill them.</p><p>Therefore, although there were no rules in the hundred clan battlefield, there were still some rules in the cities.</p><p>Of course, things weren’t absolute. If one was strong enough, they could kill someone in the city and then escape quickly. Even the Saints couldn’t do anything.</p><p>However, at least it was much safer than outside the city. That was why Yun Xi suggested that Lu Ming go to the city.</p><p>Lu Ming did not say much. He turned and stepped into the air, disappearing from the place in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Humph, with the mark of slaughter on his body, he will never be able to get to the nearest city. He will definitely be found and killed by the thousand kills Prefecture!</p><p>Yun Kai sneered.</p><p>Yun Xi glanced at Yun Kai with some disgust, then turned around and left.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the black wings and flew forward at an extremely fast speed. Soon, they had flown tens of thousands of miles.</p><p>the hundred clan battlefield has gathered many sovereign-level forces ‘prodigies. Almost all of them have superior-grade earth spiritual bodies. In the depths of the hundred clan battlefield, there are even prodigies who have heaven spiritual bodies. There are too many prodigies. My cultivation is too weak. I must break through as soon as possible!</p><p>Lu Ming had many thoughts in his mind.</p><p>Lu Ming’s weakness had always been his cultivation level. He came from a remote island and the cultivation environment in the past was not good. Compared to the geniuses of the yuanlu continent, his cultivation level was much weaker.</p><p>He had comprehended the primal Chaos Domain. He was not afraid of anyone at the same level.</p><p>“It’s time to find a place to break through!”</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze around.</p><p>After flying for another tens of thousands of miles, Lu Ming flew towards a mountain. Then, the chaos Domain transformed into the earth domain. Lu Ming rushed into the mountain directly, as if he was using an underground escape technique. However, there was no change on the surface of the mountain.</p><p>After entering the center of the mountain, Lu Ming opened up a simple cave abode in the middle of the mountain and entered the mountain and river diagram.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
