There was actually a Guardian King here?</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>...</p><p>At this moment, Shakyamuni Devourer condensed his body again, and his palm pierced out like a knife.</p><p>The Saint of the tianshen sect was so shocked that he forgot to retreat. His heart was pierced by Shakyamuni’s palm. The terrifying soul-devouring force was crazily devouring the blood of the Saint.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>The tianshen sect Saint struggled madly, but it was useless. The terrifying power of discipline King Shiling poured into his body and exploded. His Saint heart was shattered.</p><p>The heaven God sect’s Saint was dead!</p><p>A Saint was killed just like that, and it was only because discipline King spirit-devouring had been sealed for many years and his strength had been greatly reduced. Otherwise, an Emperor-level expert could kill a Saint of the tianshen sect with a snap of his fingers.</p><p>“Go, quickly go!”</p><p>the other party is evil Spirit’s discipline King, a great emperor expert!</p><p>At the scene, everyone was panicking and running away from the Windy Plains in a frenzy.</p><p>As for Shakyamuni Shiling, he had absorbed the blood of a Saint. His body was covered in blood light, and his aura was much stronger.</p><p>hehehe, the blood of a Saint is indeed wonderful. There’s still a lot of it here!</p><p>Shakyamuni spirit-devouring looked up into the sky, where there were still more than a dozen Saints.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Shakyamuni spirit-devouring stepped into the air and ascended.</p><p>The dozen Saints ‘pupils contracted.</p><p>Just now, the Saint of the tianshen sect had been killed, and he had shouted loudly. They had naturally heard and seen it. Now that Shakyamuni Shi Ling was walking over, they were all shocked.</p><p>everyone, the other party is a great emperor expert. Even though he has been sealed for many years, he is still terrifying. We’d better join forces!</p><p>A Saint from the Yu Du sect was the first to speak.</p><p>“Alright, I agree!”</p><p>“I also agree!”</p><p>They could only join forces against Shakyamuni spirit Devourer. Otherwise, they would die.</p><p>Bzzzz …</p><p>At this moment, the ancient Phoenix mirror let out a loud cry. It shone brightly and seemed to have turned into a Phoenix, breaking out of the encirclement.</p><p>“You want to leave after sealing me for so many years?”</p><p>you’re courting death! discipline King spirit-devouring said coldly. He waved his palm, and a giant palm condensed and grabbed at the Phoenix ancient mirror.</p><p>The Phoenix spread its wings, and a dazzling ray of light shot out. It pierced through the huge hand condensed by discipline King spirit-Devourer and rushed into the distance.</p><p>Discipline King Soul-devouring frowned and didn’t pursue. The dozen Saints were afraid of him, so they didn’t dare to pursue.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the ancient Phoenix mirror disappeared from everyone’s sight.</p><p>On the heavenly wind Plains, a young man was running wildly towards the outside of the heavenly wind Plains.</p><p>This person was Eden.</p><p>He didn’t enter the mountain but stayed outside. Then he saw the ancient Phoenix mirror fly out and more than a dozen Saints participate in the battle. He knew that there was no point in staying. It was extremely dangerous. If he was swept by the aftermath of the battle between Saints, he would die.</p><p>Therefore, he decided to leave the breezy Plains and observe in the dark.</p><p>While he was running, a Phoenix’s cry rang out. Then, a rainbow light shot towards his body, entered it, and disappeared.</p><p>Eden’s expression changed drastically. He carefully sensed for a moment and revealed a look of ecstasy.</p><p>monarch weapon, ancient Phoenix mirror!</p><p>Eden murmured in a low voice. Then, he used his movement technique and flew out at an extreme speed, disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p><p>On the other side, discipline King spirit-devouring looked at the dozen Saints with a burning gaze.</p><p>It was as if in his eyes, a Saint realm expert was more attractive than an Emperor weapon.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Suddenly, Shakyamuni spirit-devouring moved and attacked one of them.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>More than a dozen Saints attacked at the same time. Terrifying attacks gathered and bombarded Shakyamuni Shiling. However, Shakyamuni Shiling’s body was as light as a feather. He dodged the attacks with a slight flash and continued to attack one of them.</p><p>“Help Dharmaraja!”</p><p>At this moment, a few black-robed men stepped into the sky and joined the battle.</p><p>They were a few Saints from evil spirit.</p><p>They attacked and helped discipline King spirit-devouring restrain his opponent, making him even more comfortable.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Shakyamuni shivered and struck out with his palm. Wisps of black smoke spread out and rushed toward the Saints.</p><p>Shakyamuni devoured the previous Saint, so he was obviously stronger.</p><p>The Saints seemed to be very afraid of the black smoke. They didn’t dare to touch it. They kept attacking to disperse the black smoke.</p><p>Some other attacks were aimed at Shakyamuni Shiling, but they seemed to be useless against him. His body collapsed and turned into wisps of black smoke.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Shakyamuni spirit-devouring stared at one of the Saints and kept attacking.</p><p>That Saint was from a small sect and was relatively weak.</p><p>The saint’s expression was ugly as he kept retreating.</p><p>“Lingyan steps!”</p><p>An ear-piercing sound came out of Shakyamuni Devourer’s mouth. His body flickered and suddenly disappeared without a trace.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The Saint was shocked. He exploded his Saint power and controlled the law to attack in all directions.</p><p>But …</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Shakyamuni devouring spirit had already appeared in front of him. His palm pierced through the saint’s heart, and the terrifying power destroyed his Saint heart.</p><p>Then, it began to absorb the blood of the other party.</p><p>“Stop him! We can’t let him continue to absorb blood!”</p><p>A Saint from the Yudu sect roared and attacked Shakyamuni Shiling. The other Saints also attacked him.</p><p>Shakyamuni had been sealed for many years. His vitality was weak, so his strength was low.</p><p>However, if the other party absorbed his blood, his strength would probably skyrocket.</p><p>The terrifying attacks landed on Shakyamuni Shiling. His body exploded, turning into wisps of black smoke and entering the body of the Saint he had killed.</p><p>“Hehehe, you can’t stop me!”</p><p>An evil voice came from the saint’s body. His body shriveled up at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p><p>“Destroy his corpse!”</p><p>die! someone shouted. The terrifying attack landed on the saint’s body and instantly cracked it. However, only a small amount of blood scattered and was rolled up by a cloud of black smoke. The blood was then sucked into the black smoke.</p><p>“Gah gah gah!”</p><p>As he laughed, Shakyamuni devoured his human form again. However, his body was plumper, and his aura was stronger.</p><p>“Spirit-destroying palm, kill!”</p><p>attack! Shakyamuni Devourer shouted. This time, he directly attacked.</p><p>He had absorbed the blood of two saints in a row, and his strength had increased greatly. He could now use some terrifying means.</p><p>A terrifying palm print was formed, and it attacked one of the Saints.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Saint exploded and struck the palm print, but the result was that the saint’s body shook violently and he retreated while spitting blood.</p><p>Hu hu hu …</p><p>Shakyamuni spirit-devouring struck out more than a dozen palm prints. They covered the sky and attacked the Saints.</p><p>More than a dozen Saints roared and attacked to block, but in the end, they were all forced to retreat while spitting blood.</p><p>Emperor-level experts were too powerful. As long as they recovered some of their strength, these ordinary saints wouldn’t be able to resist them.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
