The other party’s expression changed drastically, and he blocked it with his Saint blade.</p><p>...</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The other party was sent flying and crashed into a mountain peak, spitting out large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward, wanting to rush forward and kill this person.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Suddenly, a loud shout came from the sky. A black light flashed and an invisible force bombarded Lu Ming’s spiritual God. The spiritual God’s defensive armor glowed and blocked the attack, but it kept shaking.</p><p>“Soul attack technique!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>At this moment-</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At least a dozen people in the surroundings attacked at the same time, using soul attack techniques to attack Lu Ming. Lu Ming’s spiritual God was shocked.</p><p>These people were all high-level martial Royal realm experts. One of them was a soul attack technique that belonged to the person who gave the order. It was terrifyingly powerful.</p><p>If not for Lu Ming’s powerful soul power and the spiritual God defensive treasure, his soul would have been obliterated.</p><p>this is the godly sword technique. You’re from evil spirit!</p><p>Lu Ming roared angrily. He finally knew who the other party was.</p><p>Evil spirit. The other party was definitely from evil spirit.</p><p>It was not the deity sect, the Tianyu demonic sect, or the desire poison sect, but the evil spirit sect.</p><p>Evil spirit had its eyes on him.</p><p>More than a dozen experts were attacking Lu Ming with soul attacks. At this moment, the pagoda, the hill, and the giant staff had also arrived.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming roared like a wild beast. More energy gushed into his third bloodline, filling his heart with endless killing intent. His mind was almost drowned by the endless killing intent.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>After sending the giant iron rod flying with a punch, the black wings flickered wildly and bombarded the small mountain and the pagoda, sending them flying.</p><p>Then, he took a step forward and charged at the powerhouse who was controlling the saber.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The expert was shocked and wanted to escape. However, he was enveloped by Lu Ming’s terrifying killing intent and his body stiffened.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming flew past him, his black wings like blades, and killed the man.</p><p>Lu Ming grabbed the Holy weapon saber. With a flash of his black wings, he charged toward the powerhouse who was controlling the small mountain.</p><p>From all around, soul attacks were continuously launched at Lu Ming. Lu Ming withstood the soul attacks and charged forward.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The Saint blade slashed at the other party. The other party blocked it with a small mountain, but the small mountain was sent flying.</p><p>The other party’s face was pale as he quickly retreated.</p><p>On the other side, the huge Pagoda charged toward Lu Ming in an attempt to Save the Powerhouse who was controlling the small mountain.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming threw the Saint Sword in his hand to block the pagoda, but he did not stop and continued to attack the other party.</p><p>The other party did not have time to recall the small mountain and could only block it with his own strength.</p><p>However, in Lu Ming’s current state, his strength was shocking. His opponent’s King spiritual weapon was torn apart by Lu Ming’s punch. The terrifying fist force killed his opponent in the air.</p><p>“Retreat, retreat!”</p><p>The other two were shocked. They did not dare to approach Lu Ming and retreated frantically.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current state was too terrifying. He was like a legendary bloodthirsty demon. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>At this moment, the black-robed man who had given the order in the sky moved. He took a step forward and unsheathed his combat sword. A beam of sword light instantly crossed the void of ten thousand meters and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>It was fast, extremely fast. Moreover, the terrifying pressure made Lu Ming feel frightened even though he was almost drowned by the endless killing intent.</p><p>The sword light reached Lu Ming’s throat in an instant, about to cut off his head.</p><p>This was a half-Saint, a half-Saint who was half a step into the Saint realm.</p><p>The half-Saint realm and the ninth level of the martial Royal realm seemed to be only one level apart, but the battle strength of a half-Saint was much stronger than that of a ninth level martial Royal realm. It was not as simple as one level.</p><p>A half-Saint could easily kill a Lv 9 martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming roared and shifted to the side at the last moment.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming’s chest was still hit by the sword light. The vital essence, Chaos Domain, and the Dragon scales on his skin were split open, revealing a deep sword wound. Even his bones were broken and blood was flowing.</p><p>At the same time, the terrifying sword Qi continued to drill into Lu Ming’s body, trying to destroy his body.</p><p>Without a doubt, the weapon used by the other party was also a holy weapon. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have such terrifying power.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The sword did not kill Lu Ming. The other party’s sword-light changed direction again and slashed at Lu Ming’s waist.</p><p>It flapped its black wings and swept them towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The sword radiance slashed at the black wings. The wings trembled violently, and a terrifying force blasted toward Lu Ming. Lu Ming was sent flying backward and smashed into a mountain, breaking it apart.</p><p>There was a loud explosion. In the next moment, Lu Ming’s body flew out from the rubble.</p><p>a Lv 5 martial Royal realm expert actually has such a strong vitality. No wonder the elder ordered us to dispatch so many forces. This person must be eliminated as soon as possible!</p><p>Lu Ming’s stubbornness made the black-robed half-saint’s heart sink.</p><p>He took a step forward and turned into a ray of sword light, charging toward Lu Ming. The terrifying sword power made Lu Ming’s hair stand on end and his muscles tense up even from a distance.</p><p>“It’s the power of the laws!”</p><p>Lu Ming growled in a low voice.</p><p>The other party was obviously a half-Saint who had mastered the laws of nature and was extremely powerful.</p><p>There were strong and weak half-Saints. Half-Saints who had mastered the power of laws were absolutely terrifying.</p><p>The sword gleam neared Lu Ming in an instant.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>Bubbles shouted and waved its claws. A transparent bubble suddenly appeared on the black-robed half-saint’s body and covered him.</p><p>However, the other party’s body was almost unaffected. Sword light burst forth and directly broke the transparent bubble.</p><p>the space-time spirit mouse can control space-time. It’s indeed very mysterious. Unfortunately, it’s too weak!</p><p>The black-robed half-Saint said in a hoarse voice. Two rays of black light shot out of his eyes and pierced Lu Ming.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes also shot out two rays of black light.</p><p>The two of them used the divine sword technique at the same time. After the black light collided, the other party immediately destroyed Lu Ming’s Black light. The sword light did not stop and continued to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>The other party was a half-Saint who also cultivated the divine sword technique. His soul force was stronger than that of an ordinary half-Saint. Even if Lu Ming’s soul force was dozens of times stronger than that of martial artists of the same level, he was still inferior to the other party.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>The bubble cried out and pounced from Lu Ming’s shoulder. Wherever the bubble flew, the void rippled like waves.</p><p>With a wave of its claws, terrifying spatial blades shot towards the other party.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The opponent slashed out with his sword, shattering the spatial blade. Then, the sword light slashed at the bubble.</p><p>Bubble’s body emitted a rich milky white light. With a wave of her claws, the opponent’s sword light, which was originally moving at an astonishing speed, actually slowed down.</p><p>It was not that his opponent had slowed down, but that the bubble had affected time and used time deceleration to slow down his opponent’s sword light.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The black-robed half-Saint yelled. The sword light suddenly expanded and broke the bubble’s time deceleration. The terrifying sword light crossed the space and slashed at the bubble.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
