It could be said that this was the biggest event in the Azure continent in three years.</p><p>Such a grand event naturally attracted many large Chambers of Commerce to gather at the Cang Mountain.</p><p>In fact, there were even large Chambers of Commerce from outside of the Azure region. Here, they brought with them many rare treasures and treasures that the Azure region didn’t have.</p><p>Among them, the most famous one was the Supreme treasure Pavilion.</p><p>I heard that the Supreme treasure Pavilion is an extremely large Chamber of Commerce outside of the Azure continent. Their power is unparalleled. I’m afraid that even the thirteen top sects in the Azure continent combined might not be as powerful as the Supreme treasure Pavilion.</p><p>Xue ningxin explained.</p><p>“So strong?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>of course, it’s strong. That’s because the pavilion of Supreme treasures is an Emperor-level force!</p><p>Xue ningxin said.</p><p>“An Emperor-ranked power!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils constricted.</p><p>As the name suggested, an Emperor-ranked force was a force with a great emperor in charge.</p><p>Of the thirteen top powers in the Azure continent, not a single one had a great emperor in charge. Their strength couldn’t be compared to an Emperor-ranked power. The difference was too great.</p><p>every time the Supreme treasure Pavilion comes, it brings with it many rare and even non-existent treasures. Today is the opening day of the Supreme treasure Pavilion, and it will attract countless people. Let’s go and see if we can buy anything useful!</p><p>Xue ningxin said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and immediately became interested.</p><p>Not long after, the three of them had changed into black robes and put on black bamboo hats, which covered their entire bodies.</p><p>At the same time, the three of them concealed their auras. Even if there were acquaintances, they wouldn’t be able to recognize them.</p><p>According to Xue ningxin, when the Supreme treasure Pavilion opened today, many people from all the major forces would go there. There were many grudges between these forces, and once they went, wouldn’t it be easy to start a fight?</p><p>Therefore, many people would wear black robes and bamboo hats to avoid being recognized.</p><p>In addition, even if he bought some precious items, he could also prevent others from thinking about it.</p><p>The three of them flew toward the middle of a mountain, and a vast Palace soon appeared in front of the three-eyed man.</p><p>Above the palace, three big words were written: The Supreme treasure Pavilion!</p><p>The door of the Supreme treasure Pavilion had already opened, and one figure after another flew into the door.</p><p>Most of them were like Lu Ming and the other two, wearing black robes and bamboo hats. Even if they were not wearing them, they had disguised themselves.</p><p>The three of them walked through the door, and they immediately saw huge counters. Behind the counters were all kinds of treasures.</p><p>The hall was extremely spacious. There were counters lined up in an orderly manner, and there were people in front of the counters to greet everyone.</p><p>Countless people strolled around in the palace. At a glance, there were no less than 100000 people, but it did not seem crowded, which showed how big the palace was.</p><p>Moreover, no one would dare to snatch the treasures here.</p><p>This was because this was the Supreme treasure Pavilion.</p><p>It was said that many years ago, when the Supreme treasure Pavilion first came to the Cang state, there was a Saint who wanted to take the treasures of the Supreme treasure Pavilion. In the end, a Supreme Saint appeared from the Supreme treasure Pavilion and killed the Saint with a single slap.</p><p>After that, no one dared to covet the treasures of the Supreme treasure Pavilion.</p><p>“So many precious materials!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes swept around and he was dazzled.</p><p>However, the materials, spirit weapons, and pills here were all of a low grade and weren’t of much use to the three of them.</p><p>let’s go upstairs. The treasures on the second floor are of a higher grade!</p><p>Xue ningxin said.</p><p>There were three levels here, and the treasures on each level would be of a higher grade and more precious.</p><p>The three of them walked up the stairs to the second floor.</p><p>The treasures on the second floor were indeed of a higher grade and more precious.</p><p>this is the myriad existences liquid. It’s a spiritual liquid that’s even more precious than the myriad spirit liquid!</p><p>Lu Ming saw a type of all creation liquid and bought ten catties on the spot. Of course, the price was that he had to give up more than half of the mid-grade raw stones he had.</p><p>Lu Ming kept the myriad creation liquid in the mountain and river diagram. He then watered the path-understanding ancient tree with the myriad creation liquid.</p><p>Now, the path-understanding ancient tree was growing better and better. It was getting thicker and thicker, and it had more leaves.</p><p>The three of them strolled around, and Tian Chui and Xue ningxin bought some items.</p><p>“Let’s go to the third floor!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Then, the three of them went up to the third floor.</p><p>There were also many people on the third floor, no less than tens of thousands.</p><p>Of course, many of the treasures on the third floor had reached the Saint realm, such as Saint medicine and Saint weapons. They were very precious, and many people couldn’t afford them. They were just here to broaden their horizons.</p><p>“So many Saint weapons!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at a counter.</p><p>There were Saint weapons on the counter. At a glance, there were no less than a hundred.</p><p>No less than a hundred Saint weapons. How shocking was that?</p><p>Each Saint weapon gave off a mysterious aura and all kinds of light.</p><p>There were only two young and beautiful women standing on the counter. It seemed that they were only at the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>In front of the counter, many people stopped to look. They all stared at the Saint weapons with a burning light, as if they wanted to swallow them up.</p><p>If it were anywhere else, hundreds of Saint weapons guarded by only two young women at the Martial Emperor realm would have been taken away long ago.</p><p>However, no one dared to make a move here.</p><p>If anyone dared to make a move, the person standing in front of him would most likely be an absolute Saint.</p><p>The three of them came to the counter.</p><p>“Ladies, do you have any holy weapon gloves for sale?”</p><p>Lu Ming said in a low voice.</p><p>“Of course. Do you want to buy it?”</p><p>A young woman said with a smile.</p><p>“That’s right, can you let me take a look first?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>One of the women nodded and took out a box. She opened the box and revealed a dark red ball the size of a longan.</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little dumbfounded. Wasn’t he supposed to give him a glove-type holy weapon? Why did he take out a round ball?</p><p>Sir, this is a pair of Saint weapon gloves specially made by my treasure Pavilion. It’s very mysterious. Let me try it on for you!</p><p>A young woman smiled as she picked up the ball and placed it in her palm.</p><p>A shocking scene appeared. The ball actually softened like a pool of liquid and wrapped the young woman’s palm inside, forming a glove.</p><p>The young woman’s palm seemed to be covered with a layer of black gauze.</p><p>Then, the young woman injected her vital essence.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The glove exuded a powerful aura, the aura of a holy weapon.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>He had fallen in love with the Holy weapon gloves at first sight.</p><p>Sir, these holy weapon gloves are called the flowing essence gloves. They are made of flowing essence gold and other precious materials. They contain the laws of nature and are true holy weapons. They are extremely hard, and holy weapons of the same level can’t break the gloves at all. Moreover, they are easy to use. Please have a look, Sir!</p><p>As soon as the young woman finished speaking, the flowing essence glove shrank in her palm and disappeared into it as if it were alive. The next moment, it came out again and covered her palm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
