Let’s see how many of my weapons you can take!”</p><p>The young man in purple stepped forward and slashed out with his sword.</p><p>...</p><p>The sword light cut through the void, and its power was much stronger than the previous one.</p><p>“Flying Cloud spear art!”</p><p>die! Yun Yan shouted. Her long spear was like a dragon as it shot out beams of dazzling spear light toward the young man in purple.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>The two of them collided continuously, but they were still evenly matched.</p><p>However, what was shocking was that there were bright spots shining on the young man’s body. From each bright spot, a weapon flew out. These weapons floated around the young man’s body. These weapons seemed to be connected with each other. All the Qi of combat weapons gathered on the combat sword in the young man’s hand, making the power of his combat sword more and more terrifying.</p><p>The weapon in the purple-shirted young man’s hand was only an Emperor spiritual weapon, but it could borrow the Qi of other spiritual weapons and merge them together. Its power was even stronger than Yun Xi’s Saint weapon.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The more the young man fought, the more courageous he became. He held a sword in his right hand and grabbed a battle axe with his left hand. He attacked Yun Xiao from both sides.</p><p>Yun Xi was slowly being suppressed.</p><p>“What a marvelous domain, what a marvelous combat technique!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with amazement.</p><p>His opponent’s domain allowed him to use different weapons at the same time. When he used a sword, it could transform into a sword domain. When he used an axe, it could transform into an axe domain.</p><p>It seemed to be the same as his Chaos Domain.</p><p>However, it was impossible for the other party to cultivate the chaos Domain.</p><p>Ten thousand soldier domain!</p><p>An extremely rare domain appeared in Lu Ming’s mind. It was the ten thousand soldier domain.</p><p>It was said that one could control all the weapons in the world by cultivating the 10000 soldier realm. No matter what weapon one used, it would be transformed into a corresponding weapon realm.</p><p>Of course, it was only limited to weapons. It could not be transformed into a domain of fire, a domain of water, and the like. Those were the specialties of the chaos Domain.</p><p>But it was still very shocking.</p><p>“Out!”</p><p>In the end, the young man in purple shouted. Bright spots lit up on his body again, and weapons flew out.</p><p>There were 18 different weapons floating around the young man in purple. All of them were King spiritual weapons. The combat weapon Qi of the 18 King spiritual weapons was extremely powerful.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Yun Xi was sent flying by the sword. She spat out a mouthful of blood, and her face turned pale.</p><p>Yun Xiao had lost. He was no match for her in a battle of the same level.</p><p>“Looking at your cultivation technique, you must be from the cloud Emperor mountain. Hehe, the cloud Emperor mountain is nothing more than this!”</p><p>The young man in purple sneered and didn’t continue to attack. He returned to the noble young man’s side, and the 18 different Emperor spiritual weapons flew into his body and disappeared.</p><p>Yun Xi’s expression was a little ugly, but the ten thousand soldiers scroll cultivated by the WAN family was really powerful.</p><p>“There are so many geniuses here. Are these all geniuses from Emperor-ranked powers?”</p><p>Lu Ming had a thought in his mind.</p><p>He had only been in the hundred clan battlefield for a short time. Before, he had met the geniuses of the thousand kills Prefecture, and now, he had met the people of the WAN family. They were all geniuses with superior earth spiritual bodies, and their cultivation methods and combat skills were all stronger than the last.</p><p>If these geniuses were placed in Cangzhou, they would all have the chance to compete for the top ten geniuses.</p><p>This made his blood boil.</p><p>Only in such an environment would he be able to improve faster.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>At this time, the noble young man in the middle looked at the body of the assassin from the thousand-kill mansion. His eyes flickered and he said in surprise, ” were you the ones who killed the assassins of the thousand-kill mansion? ”</p><p>Although he used the word ‘you’, his eyes were on Yun Xi.</p><p>In his opinion, only Yun Xi’s strength was worth mentioning. The others were not worth mentioning.</p><p>Among them, there was actually a sixth level Martial Emperor. He really didn’t know what was good for him.</p><p>“I didn’t kill him!”</p><p>Yun Xi shook her head.</p><p>“Not you?”</p><p>The Honorable young man was slightly stunned.</p><p>“It’s him, he killed her!”</p><p>At this moment, Yun Kai pointed at Lu Ming and shouted.</p><p>The distinguished young man was stunned. He turned to look at Lu Ming and asked in surprise,”It’s you? How could a mere Lv 6 Martial Emperor kill an assassin of the thousand-kill mansion? Interesting!”</p><p>it’s indeed interesting that a Lv 6 martial Royal realm expert can kill an assassin of the thousand kills mansion. Young master, let me test him and see what he’s capable of.</p><p>Another young man in purple said.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>The young man nodded.</p><p>The young man in purple stepped forward, and a powerful aura burst out.</p><p>Peak Lv 8 martial Royal realm!</p><p>This young man in purple was slightly weaker than the one who had fought with Yun Xi.</p><p>kid, come up and fight me. I want to see what kind of special ability you have!</p><p>The young man in purple looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped into the air, his body exuding a powerful fighting spirit. He wanted to see how powerful the secret skill of the WAN family was.</p><p>kid, you go first. Use your full strength at the end. Otherwise, you won’t have a chance!</p><p>The young man in purple said indifferently, revealing a look of contempt.</p><p>He did not care about a sixth level Martial Emperor at all. He was just curious about how Lu Ming could kill the assassins of the thousand kills mansion. Otherwise, with his cultivation, he would not have challenged a sixth level Martial Emperor at all, because it would not be effective for him to train.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to waste his breath. Since the other party had asked him to make the first move, he made his move immediately. He used the prison suppressing heaven technique and threw a punch at the youth in purple.</p><p>The air trembled, and the terrifying fist force pressed down on the air, forming a terrifying air wave that surged toward the other party.</p><p>The young man in Purple’s expression changed. The power of Lu Ming’s punch had completely exceeded his imagination.</p><p>A light spot appeared between his eyebrows and a huge axe flew out. He swung the axe at Lu Ming.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The fist and the axe collided. The young man in purple trembled and took a few steps back.</p><p>“So this is all you’ve got?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The young man in purple roared and six spots on his body lit up. Six spirit weapons of different colors appeared.</p><p>In addition to the battle-axe from before, there were a total of seven spirit weapons, all of which were Emperor-level spirit weapons.</p><p>The seven Emperor spiritual weapons floated around the young man in purple. The Qi of the weapons merged with each other and gathered on the battle-ax.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The young man in purple bellowed and swung his battle axe at Lu Ming. The power of the axe was much stronger than before.</p><p>The flowing essence gloves covered his palm. Quintessential essence surged into them crazily, making them as heavy as mountains.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Once again, Lu Ming threw a punch.</p><p>This time, the other party retreated again and was suppressed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Although the other party’s cultivation was two levels higher than Lu Ming’s and the combat techniques that he cultivated were very powerful, his spirit body was still a superior-grade spirit body.</p><p>Back in the treasure auction, Lu Ming could defeat or even kill such a prodigy. Now that Lu Ming had used his Saint weapon, he could easily suppress his opponent.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The young man in purple roared madly. He couldn’t accept the fact that he had been suppressed after two moves.</p><p>Before he made his move, he had been acting all high and mighty as if he could easily crush Lu Ming. However, now that he was being suppressed by Lu Ming, he felt that he had lost all his face. He was filled with a terrifying killing intent towards Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
