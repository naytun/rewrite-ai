The storm was over.</p><p>“Lu Ming, thank you for your help, senior brother Zifeng and senior brother frost tide!”</p><p>“Xue ningxin, thank you …”</p><p>Lu Ming, Tian Chui, and Xue ningxin cupped their fists at Zi Feng and Han Chao to express their gratitude.</p><p>en, no need to be so polite. The three of you are not bad. The three of you can participate in this time’s treasure auction!</p><p>Zi Feng nodded his head.</p><p>“Treasure auction?”</p><p>Lu Ming was still in a daze.</p><p>Wasn’t it the treasure sealing assembly? Why was there an additional treasure locking little meeting?</p><p>“Don’t worry, senior brother. I was just about to participate. I’ll definitely kill the three great sects to my heart’s content!”</p><p>Tian Chui grinned, his eyes filled with malevolence.</p><p>Xue ningxin also nodded in agreement.</p><p>“Mm, let’s return to the base first!”</p><p>Zi Feng nodded his head and left, disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Then, the other disciples of the Dragon God Valley flew toward the Dragon God Valley.</p><p>“Senior brother, Senior Sister, what’s going on with the treasure-setting party?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously on the way.</p><p>the treasure auction is a sparring session between the 13 top sects before the start of the auction. The participants must be under Lv 7 Martial Emperor realm and below the age of 50!</p><p>Tian Chui explained.</p><p>In the yuan continent, the nature of a youth was different from that of the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>In the divine wilderness continent, those below the age of 30 were the younger generation. They were the golden years of cultivation.</p><p>However, in yuanlu, those below 50 were the younger generation.</p><p>Because the cultivation environment in the yuan continent was too good, many people could break through to the martial Royal realm at a young age. Their lifespans reached 10000 to 20000 years, and their vitality was extremely vigorous.</p><p>In comparison to ten to twenty thousand years, fifty years old was still the golden age of youth, the age of endless potential.</p><p>in fact, those below the seventh level of the martial Royal realm are considered the reserve forces of their respective sects. They will all participate in the treasure fixing assembly in three or six years. This can be considered as an observation. We can roughly see the situation of the future treasure fixing assembly and the future strength of each major sect!</p><p>The snow Dragon explained.</p><p>Lu Ming came to a realization. This could be considered a small-scale treasure fixing assembly. Hence, it was called the treasure fixing assembly.</p><p>the thirteen sects also attach great importance to the treasure settlement ceremony. The sects ranked in the last three are not qualified to participate in this year’s treasure settlement ceremony. It’s equivalent to being eliminated in advance. Therefore, each treasure settlement ceremony is also unusually tragic!</p><p>Xue ningxin continued to explain.</p><p>“It’s actually like this?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. The treasure auction was directly linked to the treasure auction. Those ranked in the last three would not be qualified to participate in the treasure auction. This meant that only ten sects would participate in the treasure auction at a time.</p><p>each sect will send 36 fourth to sixth level martial emperors to participate. There are still 10 days left. Let’s go back and cultivate. At that time, we’ll kill to our heart’s content!</p><p>Tian Chui said.</p><p>This time, he felt really aggrieved.</p><p>It wasn’t that he wasn’t strong enough, but that the other party’s opponents were all experts of a higher cultivation level, using their cultivation level to suppress others.</p><p>However, there wouldn’t be any experts above the sixth level martial Royal realm in the treasure auction.</p><p>all of you must be well prepared. This time’s treasure auction may be very dangerous. The deity sect, the Tianyu demon sect, and the Yu Du sect may join forces to deal with our Dragon God Valley. All of you must be well prepared!</p><p>Cold wave said.</p><p>“Senior brother, don’t worry. I’ll kill anyone I see!”</p><p>Tian Chui grinned, revealing his ferocity.</p><p>although your combat strength is strong, you can’t underestimate your enemy. As far as I know, every sect has a heaven’s favorite with an upper-class earth spiritual body, and many of them have reached the peak of the sixth level martial Royal realm. Especially the tianshen sect, they have produced many heaven’s favorites over the years and are known as the number one sect in the Azure region. They can’t be underestimated!</p><p>Frost tide said.</p><p>Although Han Chao cultivated the Ice Dragon combat body, the scholar was very easy-going. He chatted with everyone along the way. Soon, they returned to the Dragon God Valley base.</p><p>As soon as they returned to the encampment, Lu Ming, Tian Chui, Xue ningxin, and the others returned to their rooms and went into seclusion to cultivate.</p><p>There were still ten days left before the treasure auction. The true dragon meat that Tian Chui had obtained back then had not been completely used up yet. During this period of time, he could increase his strength a little more.</p><p>Xue ningxin’s Dragon Crystal had not been fully digested yet, so her strength could also be improved.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he entered the mountain and river diagram after entering the room and sat cross-legged under the path-understanding ancient tree.</p><p>&Nbsp; previously, the stone Crown’s sneak attack had placed him in a life-and-death situation. At that critical moment, his potential had exploded, and his Chaos Domain had reached the peak of level four, only a step away from level five.</p><p>Now, he had to continue to improve his cultivation.</p><p>His cultivation was at the early stage of the fourth level Martial Emperor realm. Now, he was going to raise it to the peak of the fourth level Martial Emperor realm, which was the same as the territory.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, a pile of raw gemstones appeared. Lu Ming began to devour and refine the raw gemstones.</p><p>His cultivation base began to rise rapidly.</p><p>Five days later, Lu Ming’s cultivation had successfully reached the peak of the fourth level martial Royal realm.</p><p>Lu Ming spent the rest of the time cultivating the thirteen accumulated strikes under the path-understanding ancient tree.</p><p>Perhaps it was because of the pressure, before the treasure auction, he had accumulated power for thirteen strikes and cultivated it to the sixth level, the perfected level, which greatly increased its power.</p><p>At this moment, the time for the treasure auction had arrived.</p><p>There were 36 young men standing in a huge courtyard at the Dragon God Valley’s encampment. They were all at the fourth to sixth level martial Royal realm and were all geniuses. Most of them had inferior earth spiritual bodies.</p><p>Ordinary people with spirit bodies were not qualified to participate at all.</p><p>Lu Ming, Tian Chui, and Xue ningxin were also among them.</p><p>In addition, Lu Ming also discovered a few familiar faces.</p><p>He Yu, Blood Dragon Valley.</p><p>After this period of cultivation, Silver city’s cultivation had advanced to the sixth level of the martial Royal realm.</p><p>He Yu and Blizzard Silver City stood together and mumbled softly, casting cold glances at Lu Ming from time to time.</p><p>At this moment, an elder of the Saint realm appeared in front of everyone.</p><p>this time, the treasure auction is of great importance. I hope you will do your best to protect the honor of Dragon God Valley!</p><p>The Saint realm elder said.</p><p>“This disciple will definitely die without hesitation!”</p><p>The 36 young men and women shouted.</p><p>“Alright, let’s have a little treasure hunt. Holy weapons can’t be used. At the very best, you can only use King weapons. You should know that, right?”</p><p>The Saint realm elder said.</p><p>“I know!”</p><p>Everyone replied.</p><p>“Good. This time, the leader of the thirty-six of you will be han Xun. You will have to listen to his arrangements in the treasure auction, understand?”</p><p>The Saint realm elder said.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Everyone nodded.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze shifted to a young man in a white robe.</p><p>This person was somewhat similar to Han Chao. He was Han Chao’s younger brother. He was extremely talented, even more so than Han Chao. He had a superior earth spiritual body and his cultivation had reached the peak of the sixth level Martial Emperor realm. He was considered the strongest person below the seventh level Martial Emperor realm in Dragon God Valley.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
