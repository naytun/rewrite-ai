Junior Brother, the Dragon bones are yours and the Dragon meat is mine. I have the Barbarian dragon combat body. By devouring vacuum flesh and blood, I can slowly increase the level of my spirit body!</p><p>Tian Chui grinned.</p><p>...</p><p>it can increase the level of the spirit body? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He was secretly shocked.</p><p>This seventh senior brother was really not simple.</p><p>Naturally, he didn’t believe that Tian Chui’s “increase in spirit body grade” was an increase in quantity. It was most likely an increase in the essence of the spirit body.</p><p>His Dragon God combat body was condensed from the bloodline of the nine Dragons. Refining the Dragon bones and dragon blood could increase the level of the Dragon body. He didn’t expect Tian Chui to be able to do the same.</p><p>It seemed that he was not the only one in the world who had a strange physique that could increase the level of a spirit body.</p><p>He just didn’t know if Tian Chui’s speed of improvement was as fast as his.</p><p>At once, Lu Ming and Tian Chui separated the Black Dragon’s flesh and bones. Tian Chui kept the true Dragon’s flesh and Lu Ming kept the Dragon’s bones.</p><p>As for the Dragon skin and scales, they were all rare treasures. They could be used to make leather armors and battle armors with amazing defensive power, so the three of them split them equally.</p><p>“Eighth Junior Sister, ninth Junior Brother, let’s find a place to cultivate!”</p><p>Tian Chui was somewhat eager to try.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He had the same intention.</p><p>Xue ningxin was the same.</p><p>The three of them rose into the air and left. Not long after, the three of them came to a huge mountain range a million miles away. They each opened up a cave dwelling in the mountain range and entered the cave dwelling to begin cultivating.</p><p>After Lu Ming entered the cave abode, he entered the mountain and river diagram and took out the Dragon Bone.</p><p>The weight of the entire Dragon Bone was extremely shocking. However, because this true dragon had been dead for many years, it had lost a lot of its spiritual essence.</p><p>All in all, it was still many times more precious than the piece of Dragon Bone that Lu Ming had bought in the Dragon God Valley.</p><p>“Devour!”</p><p>A powerful devouring force burst out from Lu Ming’s body and enveloped the entire Dragon Bone. The spiritual essence of the true dragon was constantly being devoured and absorbed by Lu Ming. It fused with his body and transformed it, making it stronger.</p><p>This cultivation lasted for half a month.</p><p>Within half a month, Lu Ming had completely refined the entire day’s worth of dragon bones. Only some impurities were left, which had turned into ashes and scattered all over the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>There seemed to be Nine Dragons in Lu Ming’s body. At this moment, a Dragon’s Roar was heard. Then, the shadow of the nine Dragons rushed out of Lu Ming’s body, and a powerful pressure filled the air.</p><p>The muscles on Lu Ming’s body squirmed slightly and calmed down after a while. His body was Holy and pure, full of power.</p><p>“A superior earth spiritual body!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a bright light.</p><p>Although this Dragon Bone had been dead for many years and had lost a lot of its spiritual essence, it was still too complete. The energy added together still allowed Lu Ming’s spirit body to complete the transformation and achieve evolution, entering a superior-grade spirit body.</p><p>“What powerful strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming felt that he was full of energy. His every move was earth-shattering.</p><p>it’s much stronger than a medium-grade earth spiritual body!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his palm casually. The void rumbled and a terrifying Sonic Boom was heard.</p><p>Although his current cultivation was still at the third level of the martial Royal realm, his combat strength was much stronger than before.</p><p>No wonder a superior-grade earth spiritual body was considered one of the top physiques in the Azure region. In the vast Cang region, there were only a limited number of people with superior-grade earth spiritual bodies. Every single one of them was a terrifying heaven’s favorite.</p><p>It was said that the top ten geniuses of the Azure region all had superior earth spiritual bodies.</p><p>“I wonder if seventh senior brother and eighth Senior Sister have finished their cultivation?”</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming exited the mountain and river diagram and flew out of the cave abode. He sensed that Tian Chui and Xue ningxin were still cultivating.</p><p>Lu Ming returned to the cave abode. This time, he did not enter the mountain and river diagram. Instead, he cultivated in the cave abode that he had opened up temporarily.</p><p>Lu Ming took out a large pile of raw gemstones and prepared to refine them to improve his cultivation.</p><p>His Primal Chaos Domain was about to reach the peak of level four, and his cultivation would naturally increase as well.</p><p>Five days passed in the blink of an eye as the large pile of raw gemstones was refined.</p><p>For the past five days, Lu Ming did not stop for a moment. He devoured and refined raw gemstones madly. Even he himself did not know how many raw gemstones he had devoured and refined.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A powerful aura burst out from Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>This was the aura that belonged to a fourth level Martial Emperor. Lu Ming had finally broken through the fourth level and entered the ranks of the middle-stage martial emperors.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength had undoubtedly exploded once again after he had stepped into the fourth level Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current combat strength was at least several times stronger than when he was in the Dragon Palace.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming also felt two powerful fluctuations nearby. They only quieted down after a long while.</p><p>“Senior brother Tian Chui and Senior Sister Xue have also broken through!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred and he rushed out of the cave abode.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming came out, Tian Chui and Xue ningxin rushed out as well. The aura on their bodies was shocking.</p><p>“Senior brother, Senior Sister, you’ve broken through?”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>haha, I’ve eaten a lot of true dragon meat. I didn’t expect my cultivation to break through to Lv 6 Martial Emperor realm in one go!</p><p>Tian Chui laughed.</p><p>However, Lu Ming sensed that Tian Chui’s spirit body had improved, but it was not particularly significant and could not be compared with his improvement.</p><p>This was not surprising. After all, his spiritual body was condensed from the bloodline of the nine Dragons. Few in the world could compare to his Dragon God combat body.</p><p>For Tian Chui’s spiritual body to be able to slowly increase in strength was already extremely shocking.</p><p>“I’ve refined the Dragon Crystal and my cultivation has broken through to the 6th rank!”</p><p>Xue ningxin said.</p><p>This time, the three of them had gained a lot, and their strength had skyrocketed.</p><p>Tian Chui and Xue ningxin already had amazing battle strength. Now that they had reached the LV 6 martial Royal realm, they were even more terrifying.</p><p>we’ll be in closed-door cultivation here for twenty days. There’s still a month before the treasure sealing assembly. Let’s hurry to the Cang mountains!</p><p>Xue ningxin said.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Tian Chui took out his flying shuttle, and the three of them entered it, quickly flying towards the Cang mountains.</p><p>Seven days later, they finally neared the Cang mountains.</p><p>During these seven days, they didn’t idle around and refined the appropriate holy weapons they obtained.</p><p>In front of them, a majestic mountain appeared.</p><p>The three of them left the shuttle and looked into the distance.</p><p>The Cang Mountain was too majestic and vast. It stood between heaven and earth, its peak piercing through the clouds like a pillar of the world.</p><p>With Lu Ming and the rest’s current cultivation, as long as there were no obstacles blocking their vision, they could see the scene tens of thousands of miles away clearly from them. However, they could not see the edge of the grey Mountain at all, which showed how big it was.</p><p>The three of them flew toward the grey Mountain.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, there was a roar in front of them. Then, they saw two figures cross each other, and a blade light burst out.</p><p>With a scream, a figure was cut in half, and blood splattered on the spot.</p><p>A young man with a saber on his back appeared. He absorbed his essential core and put away the storage Ring of the Dead man. He glanced at Lu Ming and the others with a lightning-like gaze before he flew away.</p><p>“The people from the intentionless saber sect!”</p><p>Tian Chui said with a grin.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
