By now, the competition was already in the latter half. The weak had been eliminated, and the remaining ones were all very strong. The battle was very intense.</p><p>One match after another, it was finally Dragon God Valley’s turn.</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and landed on the fighting ring.</p><p>“Mo he, come down and accept your death!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was heard by everyone.</p><p>“As expected, Lu Ming wants to challenge mo he!”</p><p>Many people thought that mo he had broken the rules and almost killed Xue ningxin. Many people guessed that Lu Ming would definitely challenge mo he.</p><p>Mo he carried the devil saber on his back and stepped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>you’ve managed to escape twice. Today, I’ll finish you off!</p><p>Mo he said. Even though Lu Ming had already killed two top-notch experts, he was still very strong.</p><p>you won’t have any chance today. You’ll definitely die!</p><p>Lu Ming spoke in an equally domineering manner.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The two of them stood facing each other, and their domains burst out at the same time, surging toward each other.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two’s domains clashed together, creating a loud boom as they fought fiercely.</p><p>Mo he’s territory was a demonic Dao territory and was at the peak of the seventh-level while Lu Ming’s territory was only at the peak of the fourth-level. However, in the clash of territories, Lu Ming’s territory was not at a disadvantage at all.</p><p>The two domains clashed and intertwined, creating a terrifying storm of energy.</p><p>“Kill! Splitting devil blade!”</p><p>die! mo he shouted and unsheathed his demonic saber. A shocking saber radiance broke through the sky and slashed down at Lu Ming.</p><p>The Emperor spiritual weapon spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hands. He cast [ storing power for thirteen strikes ] and a spear ray burst out, colliding with the demonic blade.</p><p>Within the spearlight, thirteen forces overlapped and exploded, erupting with a terrifying penetrating power.</p><p>However, there was a terrifying splitting force within the demonic blade that was rapidly splitting the spear radiance’s power. In the end, the two of them dissipated.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered slightly. The sky demon sect’s splitting demonic blade indeed lived up to its reputation.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Then, the two of them charged forward like two bolts of lightning and struck each other.</p><p>The demonic blade and the long spear clashed together, creating a terrifying boom.</p><p>Every time the two of them collided, a terrifying shockwave would burst out. The force was wanton and swept in all directions.</p><p>There was a layer of transparent light screen around the fighting stage, which blocked the overflowing Qi. Otherwise, some of the weaker people in the stands would have been injured.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>After exchanging several moves, Lu Ming shouted. Two divine swords shot out from his eyes and shot toward mo he.</p><p>Lu Ming cast the divine sword technique. Two jet-black divine swords rushed into mo he’s body and bombarded his spiritual God.</p><p>However, mo he’s body only trembled slightly and he was fine.</p><p>“Spiritual God defensive treasure!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p>“Your soul attack is useless Against Me!”</p><p>Mo he sneered. His demonic blade swept across and he took the opportunity to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear shook and blocked the demonic blade’s attack.</p><p>Then, the two of them fought again and exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>To be honest, mo he was indeed very strong. He was even stronger than Bai mo and Wu qiandu, whom Lu Ming had just killed. He should be on par with han Xun and the team leader of the divine God sect.</p><p>Lu Ming’s spirit body and chaos realm had some advantages. However, his opponent’s cultivation was two levels higher than Lu Ming’s. The two of them fought intensely and it was difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>“The third bloodline!”</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming’s third bloodline emerged. A wisp of energy surged into Lu Ming’s body, making his combat strength even stronger.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear swept out. Mo he’s body trembled and he was sent flying. He slid along the fighting ring for a long distance.</p><p>“Gate of God, nine seals!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s hands rapidly formed seals. Six sealing gates appeared around mo he, trying to seal him.</p><p>“Demonic god, descend!”</p><p>demonic god! mo he roared, and demonic Qi surged. A giant demonic god with three heads and six arms condensed around him, emitting vast demonic might.</p><p>This was a secret skill, or it was a secret skill brought by the demonic spirit body. It was very similar to Bai Mo’s sword array, which was a secret skill brought by the spirit body.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The three-headed and six-armed fiendcelestial struck out six palms in a row, hitting the six sealing gates.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The six gates of sealing trembled and exploded.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s attack had already arrived.</p><p>The long spear smashed down on mo he like Mount Tai.</p><p>&Nbsp; Boom Boom …</p><p>The three-headed and six-armed fiendcelestial’s six huge demonic palms slammed down on Lu Ming. Two of them blocked Lu Ming’s long spear, while the other four were like four huge mountains that pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear trembled and turned into a heavy spear shadow, blasting out.</p><p>The long spear collided with the demonic palm continuously. Lu Ming and Mo he were forced to retreat in the midst of the violent rumbles.</p><p>this brat has such combat strength in such a short time. He must be eliminated!</p><p>Mo he was extremely shocked.</p><p>Back then, when he led his men to hunt down Lu Ming, Lu Ming could not put up much of a resistance in front of him. However, now, Lu Ming could fight him head-on. The battle was difficult to determine.</p><p>Then, after a period of time, what realm would Lu Ming reach? would he surpass him in all aspects?</p><p>His heart turned cold at the thought of this.</p><p>He and Lu Ming were already mortal enemies. They would not rest until one of them was dead. If they met in the future, there would definitely be a tragic battle. One of them had to die.</p><p>However, after a while, he was afraid that he would be the one to die if he encountered Lu Ming. Therefore, he had to kill Lu Ming now.</p><p>“Kill, kill!”</p><p>die! mo he roared. His demonic Qi seemed to be on fire. The huge demonic god seemed to have become real. What was shocking was that six huge demonic blades appeared on the six arms of the demonic god.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Mo he stepped forward and charged at Lu Ming. The huge demonic god waved his huge demonic blade and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. The power of the third bloodline gushed into Lu Ming’s body continuously, making his killing intent even more intense.</p><p>At the same time, the devouring power burst out and enveloped mo he, causing the demonic Qi in mo he’s body to become unstable. The demonic God’s aura also weakened.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and his body soared into the sky. His long spear turned into a thousand-meter long spear ray and smashed wildly at mo he.</p><p>Mo he’s eyes were ferocious. He exerted all his strength. The huge demonic god and the six demonic blades slashed at Lu Ming continuously.</p><p>The two of them collided intensely, and the spear radiance and the saber radiance soared into the sky.</p><p>All around, whether it was on the platform or the grandstand, everyone held their breath and stared at the fighting ring. They were afraid of missing out on the exciting scene.</p><p>what a powerful combat strength! He is below the seventh level of the martial Royal realm, but he can still exert such a terrifying combat strength. I’m afraid that even a Lv 8 martial Royal realm expert would be killed by him!</p><p>A heaven’s favorite above the seventh level of the martial Royal realm spoke with a serious look in his eyes.</p><p>“They are all peerless heaven’s favorites. In the future, they have great hopes of becoming one of the top ten demon-level geniuses of the Azure continent!”</p><p>“That’s right. I wonder what the outcome of this battle is?”</p><p>Some people were discussing in low voices, but their eyes were still fixed on the fighting ring.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
