At this moment, he had completely lost his mind. There was only one thing in his mind, and that was to kill. Kill everyone, kill all the living creatures in the world.</p><p>...</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming threw the Holy weapon in his hand. The Holy weapon whistled and cut through the void. It was extremely fast. An eighth level Martial Emperor was pierced by the sword and died on the spot.</p><p>Huala!</p><p>The black wings were covered with a layer of blood-red light, which made them more powerful. With a flap, Lu Ming appeared in front of the black-robed half-Saint and clawed at him.</p><p>The half-saint’s pupils shrank and he retreated quickly.</p><p>However, he immediately realized that it was useless. Lu Ming’s claw was faster than his retreat. Lu Ming’s claw grabbed his body.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming’s other claw landed on his body. The emperor’s spiritual weapon and armor on his body were like paper, unable to withstand a single blow.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>The black-robed half-Saint shouted in fear.</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming howled and tore the half-saint’s body into pieces. His spiritual God flew out in shock and was crushed by Lu Ming.</p><p>A half-Saint who had comprehended the laws of nature was torn apart and killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill, kill …”</p><p>Lu Ming roared. After killing one person, Lu Ming’s killing intent grew stronger.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>With a flap of his black wings, Lu Ming was the first to charge at the twelve Men in Black who were imprisoning the bubbles.</p><p>“Imprison him!”</p><p>One of them roared and controlled the array disc, trying to seal the void and Lu Ming.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>Lu Ming’s claws tore and it was as if the space was about to be torn apart. The space trembled but it could not imprison Lu Ming at all. In a flash, one of the men in Black was killed.</p><p>With one person killed, the spatial sealing formation broke apart. The bubble seized the opportunity and flew out.</p><p>“Kill, kill …”</p><p>Lu Ming kept on shouting and flapping his black wings. PU, PU, PU. The other Men in Black were killed by Lu Ming one after another. They did not even have the chance to escape.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>The bubble flew towards Lu Ming but Lu Ming did not seem to recognize it. He clawed at the bubble. The bubble immediately cast the space-time domain and retreated, avoiding Lu Ming’s attack.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>Bubbles looked at Lu Ming from afar, her big black eyes filled with anxiety.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming let out a beast-like roar and charged at the others.</p><p>“Not good, let’s go!”</p><p>Seeing that a half-Saint was easily killed by Lu Ming, the others did not dare to fight back. They all ran away frantically.</p><p>However, at this moment, Lu Ming’s entire body was filled with boundless energy. The black wings were boosted by this energy, and the power of a holy weapon seemed to be fully activated. His speed was terrifyingly fast.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body flashed and he appeared behind the ninth level martial Royal realm expert who was controlling the Holy weapon.</p><p>“Go to hell!”</p><p>The man was terrified. He waved the iron rod in his hand and swept it at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and the Holy weapon, the iron rod, was sent flying. The terrifying power flowed through the iron rod and into the opponent’s hand, causing it to explode.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s figure flashed. The man could not fight back at all and was torn apart by Lu Ming.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he charged at another person. With a wave of his hand, that person was killed.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming’s body flashed and hunted non-stop in the void.</p><p>Lu Ming was unrivaled. One by one, Lu Ming took down one of them. Their screams echoed in the night sky.</p><p>There were dozens of experts, all of whom were at the seventh level Martial Emperor realm and above. They scattered in all directions. Lu Ming was like a demon, chasing and killing them everywhere.</p><p>Half an hour later, Lu Ming caught up to the last person hundreds of thousands of miles away and killed him.</p><p>This time, all the experts who had come to besiege Lu Ming were annihilated.</p><p>After killing so many experts, Lu Ming’s killing intent did not weaken in the slightest. Instead, it became stronger.</p><p>The ice-cold killing intent made people shiver.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared. His heart was filled with endless killing intent. He wanted to kill everyone in the world.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>Bubbles appeared not far away. They looked at Lu Ming worriedly and fearfully, not daring to approach him.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly looked at bubbles. He flapped his black wings and charged towards bubbles.</p><p>Bubbles was alarmed and hurriedly cast her spacetime domain to retreat rapidly.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to chase after the bubbles. However, after a while, he realized that he could not catch up to the bubbles. He roared and flew into the distance.</p><p>Bubbles ‘body flickered and swallowed the black-robed men’s holy weapons and storage rings one by one. Then, she followed Lu Ming from a distance, worried beyond measure.</p><p>Beneath his feet was a boundless mountain. Lu Ming flew at high speed, like a demon tearing through the night sky.</p><p>In the forest below, some wild beasts and demonic beasts were swept by Lu Ming’s killing intent. They instantly trembled and hid in their respective cave abodes in fear.</p><p>Lu Ming’s blood-red eyes swept across the mountain forest below. He did not stop and continued flying.</p><p>It seemed that the level of the wild beasts and demonic beasts below were too low and not worth his time to kill.</p><p>The boundless mountain continued to pass under his feet.</p><p>A huge castle appeared in front of them, built on a towering mountain.</p><p>There were guards around the castle.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At the sight of the castle, Lu Ming let out a loud roar that echoed in the night sky.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>The guards of the castle discovered Lu Ming instantly.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared loudly. He flapped his black wings and rushed towards the castle.</p><p>“This is the Lu clan’s Castle. Stop right there … Ah!”</p><p>The guard shouted but at the next moment, he screamed in pain as he was killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming dashed past them and more than ten corpses fell to the ground.</p><p>“Enemy attack!”</p><p>The entire castle was alarmed. The war drums sounded, and experts flew out of the castle one after another.</p><p>The fourth, fifth, sixth, and all the way to the eighth level of the martial Royal realm.</p><p>These people flew out and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming roared and rushed into the crowd. A moment later, these experts were all dead.</p><p>“Demon!”</p><p>Someone shouted in fear and retreated frantically.</p><p>“Close the gate and activate the formation!”</p><p>Someone shouted in the castle. Then, the gate of the castle closed and a large formation rose.</p><p>Kill!</p><p>Lu Ming dashed toward the castle and punched the array.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The array shattered immediately. Lu Ming dashed past it and the gate of the castle exploded.</p><p>Lu Ming rushed into the castle and started a massacre.</p><p>“A demon!”</p><p>“Run, quickly run!”</p><p>The entire castle was in chaos. Countless people rushed out in all directions.</p><p>“Demon, I’m going to kill you!”</p><p>An elder at the ninth level of the martial Royal realm charged at Lu Ming and was killed in one move.</p><p>It seemed that the LV 9 martial Royal realm was the strongest in this Castle. The others were all below Lv 9 martial Royal realm.</p><p>“Mother, mother, I’m scared!”</p><p>Not far away, a tender cry was heard.</p><p>It was a six or seven-year-old girl who looked extremely cute. Her small face was flushed red and she was extremely frightened at this moment. She was tightly hugging a young woman beside her.</p><p>“Xiangxiang …”</p><p>The young woman hugged the little girl tightly and looked at Lu Ming in horror, wanting to retreat.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>die! Lu Ming roared. His figure was like the wind as he rushed toward the little girl and the young woman. He clawed the little girl.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
