Eden shook his head. the ideas and actions of the tianshen sect are really inconsistent with my martial arts. If I continue to stay, the progress of my cultivation may be even slower!</p><p>haha, kid, you have good eyes. It’s good that you’re leaving. The tianshen sect will be destroyed by my Dragon God Valley sooner or later!</p><p>...</p><p>Tian Chui laughed out loud. As long as he heard someone belittling the heavenly God sect, he would be happy.</p><p>“You’re leaving alone?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Ji hongchen was there as well. However, after she left with me, she headed west, out of the Azure continent. I don’t even know where she is now!”</p><p>Yidian said.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred. It was good that a few acquaintances had left. It would be difficult to deal with acquaintances when they attacked the divine heavens sect in the future.</p><p>“How did you get in here? What happened here?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again. Eden had entered this place earlier than them and might know something.</p><p>“I followed the crowd into the heavenly wind plain. Not long after, I sensed something and followed it to this place. When I arrived, this place looked exactly like this. However, the hurricane didn’t surround it!”</p><p>Eden looked around and frowned when he saw the hurricane.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. It seemed that Eden had only entered this place a little earlier than them.</p><p>“Now, it seems that we can only leave this place after the hurricane has moved!”</p><p>Eden said as he looked around.</p><p>“That might not be the case!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly, causing Eden’s eyes to light up.</p><p>Then, the few of them checked the area again, but they did not find anything.</p><p>“Eden, are you going to leave here? I’ll take you with me!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“You can break through the obstruction of the wind?”</p><p>Yidian said.</p><p>“Naturally, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. The four of them randomly chose a direction and rushed over. When they were close to the hurricane, the air-frozen bead appeared between Lu Ming’s eyebrows, scattering rays of green light.</p><p>With a single thought, the green light turned into a green light screen and enveloped the four of them.</p><p>Enveloped by the green light curtain, the four of them could not feel the wind outside at all.</p><p>The four of them moved forward, and when they walked into the hurricane, they were not affected at all.</p><p>This greatly surprised Eden.</p><p>The four of them walked through the hurricane as if they were walking on flat ground.</p><p>After a while, the four of them passed through the hurricane and came outside.</p><p>The moment they came outside, the four people’s eyes all focused.</p><p>This was because they found that the area was filled with hurricanes. Tornadoes that were as high as the sky surrounded a huge mountain in the middle.</p><p>The void outside the hurricane was filled with people, looking at the mountain peak in the distance.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other three immediately restrained their auras and hid behind them.</p><p>“People from the Yu Du sect and the Tian Shen sect!”</p><p>They looked forward and saw the most people from the Yu Du sect and the Tian Shen sect.</p><p>After all, the desire poison sect and the heaven deity sect were the closest to this place. Naturally, the number of people who came here was the highest.</p><p>Other than the desire poison sect and the heaven deity sect, the others were all cultivators from some small sects and powers. Naturally, there were also some people from the other eleven peak-level sects of the Azure continent present. Of course, the number of people present was relatively small.</p><p>“The Tian Yu demon sect!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze turned cold. He saw the people from the Tian Yu demon sect and Mo Yang, but he did not see Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Where did little Qing go? Are you looking for me?”</p><p>Lu Ming made a guess and he was a little worried.</p><p>Bzzzz …</p><p>The cry of a Phoenix resounded through the world.</p><p>This Phoenix cry was loud and clear, filled with the domineering aura of the king of birds. It was completely different from the cry of despair and unwillingness before.</p><p>The cry came from the mountain peak.</p><p>this cry is completely different from the previous Phoenix’s cry. Strange, could there be two phoenixes here? ”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered in his heart.</p><p>Following that, another cry rang out, reverberating through the heavens and earth.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were on the mountain surrounded by the hurricane.</p><p>Was there really a Phoenix in the mountains?</p><p>At this moment, the mountain glowed, and everyone saw a phoenix soaring into the sky. It circled above the mountain, emitting a vast and terrifying aura.</p><p>Everyone took a closer look and realized that it was not a real phoenix, but a Phantom made of energy.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Then, a beam of light shot out from the mountain. The cry of the phoenix became even more intense.</p><p>The aura was even more terrifying as it filled the air. Under this aura, everyone had the urge to kneel down and worship.</p><p>“This … What kind of aura is this? it’s so terrifying!”</p><p>this seems to be the aura of a weapon. It’s not a living creature, but its aura is too terrifying. It’s many times stronger than ordinary holy weapons!</p><p>could it be that there’s an absolute Saint weapon inside? or could it be …</p><p>He didn’t finish his sentence, but everyone was shocked.</p><p>Everyone knew what that person wanted to say.</p><p>Or could it be … A monarch weapon!</p><p>Sovereign weapon, the exclusive weapon of sovereign-level experts. Many people’s breathing became heavy at the thought of this.</p><p>There was actually a monarch weapon hidden in the heavenly wind Plains?</p><p>This was especially true for the people from the heaven deity sect and the desire poison sect.</p><p>If a peak grade sect could obtain an Emperor weapon, as long as they could activate a trace of its power, they would be able to dominate the Azure continent.</p><p>Even if it wasn’t a sovereign weapon, but an absolute Saint weapon, its value would still be shocking.</p><p>If not for the hurricane in front of them, many people would have rushed in directly.</p><p>Above the mountain, a Phoenix’s shadow circled, its cry getting louder and louder.</p><p>send a message back. Ask the Experts of the Saint realm to come here!</p><p>Someone from the heavenly Divine sect instructed.</p><p>At the same time, the people from the desire poison sect also ordered.</p><p>As for the other top sects, as long as they had people here, they would think of ways to send a message back and invite their Saint realm experts.</p><p>It was suspected that an Emperor-ranked weapon had appeared here. This was definitely a major event that would shake the entire Azure continent. As long as the major sects received the news, they would definitely send their experts over.</p><p>After the news spread, everyone waited.</p><p>it’s a pity that our Dragon God Valley is too far away from here. Even if we send back the news, it will be too late!</p><p>Tian Chui sighed.</p><p>“Senior brother, Senior Sister, wait for me here!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly spoke.</p><p>“Junior Brother, what are you doing? Do you want to go in alone?”</p><p>Xue ningxin said.</p><p>“Senior Sister, don’t worry. I won’t go in alone!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Lu Ming had the air-frozen bead and the Hurricanes could not stop him.</p><p>However, Lu Ming would not go in. With his cultivation level, even if he went in and obtained the sovereign weapon, he would not be able to leave. There were so many people watching.</p><p>Also, this matter is not simple. There seems to be another force in the dark.</p><p>That force had injured the divine Phoenix and dug out the Phoenix incense wood. Perhaps the changes in the entire heavenly wind Plains were caused by this. However, that force had not shown itself yet. Lu Ming would not risk it alone.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming retracted his aura and transformed into a young man with a sallow face. The aura on his body also changed into another kind of aura and then he rushed forward.</p><p>In that direction, there were many experts of the tianshen sect standing there. Among them were Yu Sheng and a few half-Saint experts. They were the ones who had ambushed them before.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
