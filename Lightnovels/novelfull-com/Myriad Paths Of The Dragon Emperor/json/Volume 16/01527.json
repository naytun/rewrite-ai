If anyone acts like he Yu and makes decisions on their own, they will be punished according to the sect rules. Don’t blame me for not showing any mercy!”</p><p>...</p><p>“Yes, senior brother!”</p><p>Many people’s hearts trembled, and they nodded in agreement.</p><p>“Senior brother, what is the plan? why don’t you tell us!”</p><p>Blizzard Silver City coldly said.</p><p>you’ll know when the time comes. Now, you just have to follow the arrangements!</p><p>Han Xun’s eyes swept across the silver Blizzard city with a trace of coldness.</p><p>Blizzard Silver city’s face slightly sank, but he didn’t say anything.</p><p>He Yu lost. Instead of returning to the platform, he went to the stands behind the platform and the competition continued.</p><p>Platform number 11, platform number 12, platform number 13.</p><p>When the demon Castle challenge on platform No. 13 ended, the first round of challenges officially ended.</p><p>In the first round, the true experts did not make a move. Most of the people sent out were not very strong.</p><p>Only Dragon God Valley suffered heavy losses as they were targeted by the three major sects. In one round, three died and one was defeated, losing four people.</p><p>As for the heaven God sect and the life-and-death Sword sect, no one had challenged them.</p><p>Currently, in the Cang region, the tianshen sect had a faint trend of being the number one. Their strength was formidable, and the other sects had some apprehensions.</p><p>Although the life-and-death Sword sect had a small number of people, their individual strength was extremely shocking. Every disciple of the life-and-death Sword sect could not be underestimated.</p><p>Moreover, the life-and-death Sword sect’s life-and-death Sword Art would decide life and death every time it was used. It was a killing technique, and no one would not be afraid of it.</p><p>After the first round, there were a few sects that did not suffer any losses, such as the deity sect, the sky demon sect, the desire poison sect, and the life-and-death Sword sect.</p><p>The first round had ended, and the second round was coming up.</p><p>In the second round, the first platform was once again used. The heaven God sect began to send people to challenge.</p><p>There was no doubt that the tianshen sect had sent another expert to challenge a weaker disciple of the Dragon God Valley and killed him in the fighting ring.</p><p>Then, the Tianyu demonic sect used the same trick and killed another person from Dragon God Valley.</p><p>When it was the Yu Du sect’s turn, he would kill one person from Dragon God Valley.</p><p>The atmosphere in the Dragon God Valley was getting more and more depressing.</p><p>it seems that Dragon God Valley will be the first one to be eliminated!</p><p>that’s right, and many of them will be killed. Many of the heaven’s pride experts in this batch will die. It’s a great loss!</p><p>The surrounding cultivators from the other sects began to shake their heads and sigh.</p><p>The challenges continued. One by one, it was Dragon God Valley’s turn.</p><p>Wang Fei, you go. Don’t challenge the deity sect, the sky demon sect, or the desire poison sect. You can choose any of the other sects. Pick one that’s about as strong as you. Treat it as training!</p><p>Han Xun pointed at a young man.</p><p>“Choose Wang Fei?”</p><p>The other people of Dragon God Valley looked at han Xun in surprise.</p><p>Now, wasn’t it their turn to counterattack? shouldn’t they send out an expert to kill one of the experts from the heavenly Divine sect? Why did they send Wang Fei?</p><p>Wang Fei’s cultivation was only at the fourth level of the martial Royal realm. He was considered weak among the remaining people of Dragon God Valley.</p><p>Moreover, he was not allowed to challenge the three major sects of the tianshen sect. The others were very surprised.</p><p>Wang Fei himself was also stunned.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Han Xun spoke again.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Wang Fei nodded and flew up to the fighting ring. He chose someone from the intentionless saber sect whose cultivation was similar to Wang Fei’s. The two of them fought intensely. After exchanging more than a hundred moves, Wang Fei was thrown off the fighting ring.</p><p>Dragon God Valley? what does that mean? ”</p><p>I don’t understand. It’s finally my turn, but instead of sending an expert to fight back, they sent a weakling to challenge the other sects. I really don’t understand what Dragon God Valley is trying to do.</p><p>it’s simple. Dragon God Valley was forced to give up the opportunity to fight back and protect the weaker disciples. Otherwise, they would be killed by the three major sects!</p><p>“Yes, that’s true!”</p><p>Many people discussed and understood Dragon God Valley’s approach. In this way, at least some people in Dragon God Valley could be saved.</p><p>Hmph, it’s really sad to use this method. Then we’ll eliminate Dragon God Valley First, so that they can’t even participate in the treasure fixing assembly.</p><p>The leader of the heavenly God sect sneered.</p><p>haha, that’s right. This time, I heard that Dragon God Valley is well-prepared and wants to win first place in the treasure fixing assembly. I wonder what kind of scene it will be if they can’t even participate in the treasure fixing assembly? ”</p><p>On the grandstand, some of the heaven’s pride experts of the tianshen sect who were at the LV 7 martial Royal realm and above laughed mockingly.</p><p>On the grandstand of Dragon God Valley, some geniuses above the seventh level of the martial Royal realm looked gloomy and ugly.</p><p>On the tenth platform, Lu Ming was the only one with a calm expression.</p><p>“Just wait, the counterattack will begin soon!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered in his heart.</p><p>The competition continued, and soon, the second round was over.</p><p>Dragon God Valley was still the most miserable sect, with three deaths and one defeat.</p><p>After two rounds, six people had died and two had failed.</p><p>Of the 36 people, only 28 remained.</p><p>The third round began.</p><p>Just like the last time, the tianshen sect, the Tianyu demon sect, and the Yudu sect all sent their experts to challenge the weak ones of the Dragon God Valley. They came prepared. Although the youth of the Dragon God Valley rushed down from the fighting stage the moment he made his move, the person sent by his opponent was much stronger than them. With a killing intent, he killed three more people from the Dragon God Valley.</p><p>When it was Dragon God Valley’s turn, han Xun sent a weak disciple to challenge other sects. He was defeated after a few rounds, but he managed to survive.</p><p>Soon, the third round was over.</p><p>In Dragon God Valley, nine people were killed and three were defeated. A total of 12 people were eliminated.</p><p>At this point, the fourth level martial emperors of Dragon God Valley were either dead or defeated. Lu Ming was the only one who was still at the fourth level.</p><p>Everyone in the Dragon God Valley looked terrible and the atmosphere was heavy.</p><p>“Argh! Damn it, damn it, han Xun, why didn’t we send out experts to counterattack? next round, send me! I want to kill, kill these sons of b * tches!”</p><p>Tian Chui brandished his huge hammer, constantly roaring in anger, extremely anxious.</p><p>Lu Ming and han Xun’s faces were cold and they did not say a word.</p><p>Xue ningxin cast a glance at Lu Ming, deep in thought.</p><p>Next, the fourth round began. It was still the tianshen sect’s turn to issue a challenge.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>On the first platform, a figure leaped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A powerful aura burst out from this person.</p><p>Sixth level Martial Emperor realm!</p><p>The tianshen sect began to send out their Lv 6 martial Royal realm experts because almost all the remaining people in Dragon God Valley were above the LV 5 martial Royal realm.</p><p>The man had an arrogant look on his face. He swept his gaze across the room and eventually fixed it on Lu Ming. He sneered,”Lu Ming, get down here and accept your death!”</p><p>“You’re challenging me?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“Lu Ming, kill! Kill this b * stard!”</p><p>Tian Chui roared.</p><p>“Don’t worry!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. He took a step forward and appeared on the fighting ring.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re really audacious. You’ve killed the people of my tianshen sect time and time again!”</p><p>The young man from the heavenly God sect glared at Lu Ming coldly. He did not even bother to hide his cold killing intent.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
