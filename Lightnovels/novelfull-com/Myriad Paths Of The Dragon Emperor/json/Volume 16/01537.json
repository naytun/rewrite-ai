Don’t go too far!</p><p>At this moment, an old voice came from one of the buildings.</p><p>...</p><p>From the direction of the voice, it should be the Saint realm elder of the Yu Du sect.</p><p>“Hehe, are you heartbroken? Why didn’t you think about that when you killed the disciples of Dragon God Valley? Lu Ming, you don’t have to care about this old man!”</p><p>The voice of the Dragon God Valley’s Saint realm elder came from the pavilion behind the dragon God Valley.</p><p>young man, you’d better think about it. After all, you’ll have to travel outside in the future. It’s not good to go too far!</p><p>The Saint realm elder of the Yu Du sect continued.</p><p>you’re despicable! You’re threatening a disciple of Dragon God Valley!</p><p>The Saint realm elder of Dragon God Valley said.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>The Saint realm elder of the Yu Du sect sneered.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s reply was only one word,’kill’. Two more beams of sword light shot out from Lu Ming’s eyes and pierced into the poisonous gas. Wu qiandu screamed in pain as the cloud of poisonous gas collapsed completely, without a trace of life.</p><p>Wu Qian Du, dead!</p><p>This was Lu Ming’s response to the Yu Du sect’s sage realm elder. He was domineering and merciless.</p><p>At this moment, there was no sound from the pavilion behind the desire poison sect. However, a cold killing intent spread out.</p><p>Of course, in such an environment, the elders of the Saint realm were not allowed to interfere. Otherwise, the other sects would gang up on them.</p><p>He was dead!</p><p>Wu Qian was poisoned to death!</p><p>Most of the people present felt their hearts trembling.</p><p>Another top heaven’s pride expert was killed by Lu Ming. Including Bai mo, there were two top heaven’s pride experts who had died at the hands of Lu Ming.</p><p>It was too tragic.</p><p>In the previous treasure auction, very few upper grade earth spiritual bodies were killed. Geniuses of this level, even if there was a gap in combat strength, it wouldn’t be too big. It was possible to defeat them, but it was very difficult to kill them.</p><p>This time, it was only the 20th round, and two heaven’s favorites of this level had already died. There were also many who were seriously injured.</p><p>Because of Lu Ming, the small meeting this time was many times more tragic than before.</p><p>Lu Ming put away Wu qiandu’s storage ring and returned to the platform.</p><p>Then, someone went up to the fighting ring and cleaned it.</p><p>After all, Wu qiandu had released so many poisonous insects, snakes, and the like. The fighting ring was filled with poisonous substances.</p><p>On the platform of the heavenly God sect, the heavenly God sect’s team leader’s eyes were incomparably cold. His gaze swept over Tian Chui and Xue ningxin, who were currently recuperating, and his killing intent was faintly visible.</p><p>“This guy wants to challenge Tian Chui and Xue ningxin in the next round!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Now, Tian Chui and Xue ningxin were seriously injured. If they were to be challenged by the heavenly God sect’s team leader, it would be extremely dangerous. The heavenly God sect’s team leader obviously wanted to take this opportunity to kill Tian Chui and Xue ningxin.</p><p>“I won’t let him succeed!”</p><p>Han Xun said, his killing intent cold.</p><p>After cleaning up, the competition continued.</p><p>It was unknown if the atmosphere had been incited, but when it was the other sects ‘turn, it became even more intense and explosive.</p><p>The other sects that had grudges with each other also began to send out their top experts to challenge the top experts of the sects that had grudges with each other.</p><p>After Lu Ming and Wu Qian Du, there were two more clashes between the top powerhouses. The battle was extremely intense. In the end, the top geniuses of the intentionless saber sect and the demon Castle were both injured and fell off the fighting ring.</p><p>The top-tier expert of the Linglong Palace had defeated his opponent with a serious injury and won.</p><p>Soon, it was Dragon God Valley’s turn to challenge.</p><p>Han Xun stood up, took a step forward, and appeared on the fighting ring.</p><p>“Yu Sheng, come down!”</p><p>Han Xun coldly said.</p><p>Yu Sheng was the name of the team leader of the heavenly God sect.</p><p>Everyone was shocked. Han Xun was challenging Yu Sheng. The leaders of the two sects were about to clash.</p><p>Yu Sheng’s eyes turned cold. His original plan was to wait for the next round. When it was the time for the heavenly God sect to challenge him, he would personally take action to kill Tian Chui or Xue ningxin. Obviously, han Xun had seen through his plan and directly challenged him.</p><p>Yu Sheng stepped out and landed on the fighting ring.</p><p>“It’s the same if I kill you first!”</p><p>Yu Sheng said coldly. Brilliant holy light burst out of his body. He was bathed in the Holy Light, and there was no dust or dirt on him.</p><p>Yu Sheng was a direct descendant of the tianshen sect, and he cultivated the pure techniques of the tianshen sect.</p><p>“What big words!”</p><p>Han Xun sneered. A terrifying cold Qi burst out from his body, spreading in all directions. Half of the fighting ring was covered with white frost.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Yu Sheng and han Xun charged at each other at the same time and started an intense battle.</p><p>The two figures kept clashing on the fighting ring at an increasingly fast speed. Some of the weaker cultivators could no longer see the two figures clearly.</p><p>They could only see the endless holy light and the terrible cold current clashing on the battle platform, forming a pillar of Qi that shot into the sky.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Yu Sheng was bathed in holy light, holding the spear of God’s punishment. He was like a god descending to the world, ready to punish the world.</p><p>White Dragon scales emerged on han Xun’s body, and he was covered in a layer of Ice Armor. His arms had turned into dragon claws, which were so terrifying that they seemed to be able to tear apart everything.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Dragon Claw and the spear of God’s punishment collided fiercely.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Han Xun’s shoulder was pierced by the spear of God’s punishment, but his other Dragon Claw was still on Yu Sheng’s chest, almost ripping his heart out.</p><p>The two of them were injured at the same time, and their clothes were stained red with blood.</p><p>However, the battle continued.</p><p>To be honest, han Xun and Yu Sheng’s combat power was very terrifying, even stronger than Bai Mo’s. It could be said that in the future, they were very likely to be among the top ten geniuses of the Azure continent.</p><p>After all, the top ten geniuses were selected by the younger generation below the Saint realm. Once the current top ten geniuses entered the Saint realm, they would automatically be removed from the top ten geniuses and replaced by new heaven’s favorites.</p><p>It could be said that these two future freaks were going to fight in advance.</p><p>This battle lasted for more than 300 moves. The two’s true essence and physical strength gradually ran out. In the end, it became a hand-to-hand fight. The two were entangled, and their blood stained the fighting ring.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In the end, the two of them rolled off the fighting ring at the same time, ending the battle.</p><p>Lu Ming moved and appeared beside han Xun. He poured his essential core into han Xun’s body and said,”Senior Brother Han Xun, are you alright?”</p><p>“Don’t worry, it’s fine. That guy is even worse off!”</p><p>Han Xun said with a smile.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Yu Sheng snorted coldly. With the help of the disciples of the heaven God sect, he landed on the stands, took a healing pill, and began to heal his injuries.</p><p>Lu Ming supported han Xun to the stand behind the platform. Then, they returned to the platform.</p><p>In this way, there were only three people left in the Dragon God Valley.</p><p>However, the people of the heavenly God sect all had gloomy faces.</p><p>After Yu Sheng stepped down, there were no more top experts in the Tian Shen sect. It was a complete joke to win the first place.</p><p>The competition continued, and soon, this round was announced to be over. It was time for the twenty-second round.</p><p>In this round, the remaining disciples of the tianshen sect had completely lost their morale. They randomly sent out one person to challenge the other sects.</p><p>It was the Tianyu demonic sect’s turn.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>In the Tianyu demonic sect, mo he carried the demonic blade on his back and stepped out. He landed on the battle platform and looked directly at Dragon God Valley.</p><p>His eyes swept across Tian Chui and Xue ningxin.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart sank.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
