If he encountered danger, he would drag Lu Ming and the rest down.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and did not say anything else. He, Tian Chui, and Xue ningxin rushed toward the cave.</p><p>The cave was huge, and there was a downward passage.</p><p>At this moment, another Phoenix’s cry was heard. It came from the bottom of the cave, but the voice was low, weak, and full of despair.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Following that, a terrifying boom came from below.</p><p>“Could it be that there’s a great battle below?”</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two’s expressions changed, and they became even more careful. They completely concealed their auras and drew their Saint weapons at any time. At the same time, Lu Ming was ready to bring Tian Chui and Xue ningxin into the mountain and river diagram at any time.</p><p>The passage was not long, and the three of them soon reached the end.</p><p>At the end of the passage was a huge and wide underground cave. It seemed to be man-made.</p><p>The moment Lu Ming and the other two entered the underground cave, they were stunned. They looked ahead in shock.</p><p>There was a huge wall in front of the underground cave, and a Phoenix was nailed to the wall.</p><p>That’s right, a divine bird Phoenix was nailed to the wall. Its wings and legs were pierced through and nailed to the wall. Its neck was also locked to the wall.</p><p>Fresh blood flowed from his wings, feet, and along the wall.</p><p>At this moment, the Phoenix was already very weak, and its breath was hanging by a thread.</p><p>Bzzzz …</p><p>It let out a wail, its voice filled with despair.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled. It seemed that the Phoenix’s cry that had resounded throughout the Skywind Plains was made by this Phoenix. It was filled with despair and unwillingness.</p><p>A divine bird Phoenix was nailed to the wall and could only watch as it bled to death. How unwilling was this?</p><p>Who did this?</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>A violent boom interrupted Lu Ming’s thoughts and he shifted his gaze away from the Phoenix.</p><p>Below the wall was an ancient altar.</p><p>The Phoenix blood flowed along the wall and onto the altar, seeping into it.</p><p>A mirror was floating above the altar.</p><p>This mirror was carved with a Phoenix pattern. Moreover, there was an illusionary image of a Phoenix flying around the mirror. The bright light was emitted from this mirror.</p><p>Bzzzz …</p><p>The cry of a Phoenix rang out. It was intense, high-pitched, and filled with the domineering aura of the king of birds.</p><p>Lu Ming finally knew that The Phantom of the Phoenix that had appeared on the mountain and the high-pitched cry had come from this mirror.</p><p>There were indeed two different Phoenix cries. One belonged to the Phoenix, and the other belonged to the mirror.</p><p>This mirror was covered in a Halo, giving off a terrifying pressure. The eight Saints were all attacking the Halo on the mirror.</p><p>“This kind of pressure … It seems to be the pressure of a great emperor?”</p><p>Lu Ming felt the mirror’s pressure and he was shocked.</p><p>He had felt the pressure from Emperor Cang and Shakyamuni annihilating soul before. They were extremely similar to this ancient mirror. They were existences on the same level.</p><p>A monarch weapon!</p><p>A word flashed in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>There was really a monarch weapon here!</p><p>“This is a formation!”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>He could see that the entire altar, as well as the ground around it, was covered with veined patterns that formed a Grand formation.</p><p>this is the Grand sealing formation. The monarch weapon is the core. The Phoenix nailed to the wall is the key to breaking the formation. The blood that it shed can break the formation!</p><p>At this moment, many thoughts flashed through Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>Someone had injured the Phoenix and nailed her here, using her blood that was filled with resentment to break the formation.</p><p>But now, they had barged in and the eight sages were obviously attracted by the monarch weapon. They attacked the light ring with all their might, trying to get the monarch weapon.</p><p>This way, it would be equivalent to helping to crack the formation.</p><p>Lu Ming could see all of this. The eight sages must have thought of this as well. However, they did not think about anything else now. The only thing in their eyes was the sovereign weapon.</p><p>As long as he could get the monarch weapon, he didn’t care what formation he broke.</p><p>The eight sages kept bombarding the light screen, and the underground cave kept shaking.</p><p>The others watched from afar, unable to interfere at all.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>After a while, the light curtain finally couldn’t take it anymore. A crack appeared on the light curtain. Then, the cracks increased and finally, the light curtain exploded with a bang.</p><p>The light barrier shattered, and the cry of a Phoenix resounded through the cave.</p><p>“The monarch weapon is mine!”</p><p>A Sage expert of the heavenly God sect roared.</p><p>“Dream on, you want a monarch weapon? let’s see if you have the ability!”</p><p>The Saint of the Yu Du sect also roared. His body was covered in poisonous gas as he rushed toward the Saint of the tianshen sect. At the same time, he formed a giant hand and grabbed at the ancient Phoenix mirror.</p><p>“Get lost! Anyone who blocks me will die!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Chaos, complete chaos.</p><p>The formation’s light screen shattered, and the eight sages were thrown into chaos. They all rushed toward the ancient Phoenix mirror and fought each other.</p><p>The value of a monarch weapon was simply too high to imagine.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>A giant hand formed from poisonous gas grabbed onto the ancient Phoenix mirror, but the mirror trembled and a Phoenix cried out. A pillar of light shot out from the mirror and destroyed the giant hand.</p><p>But then, a giant hand made entirely of holy light also grabbed at the ancient Phoenix mirror.</p><p>Bzzzz …</p><p>The ancient Phoenix mirror let out a Phoenix cry, and then a Phoenix Phantom rushed out, crushing the giant hand of holy light. Then the ancient Phoenix mirror trembled and flew directly above.</p><p>A huge cauldron, a Saint weapon, came crashing down. It was meant to suppress the ancient Phoenix mirror, but the mirror dodged the cauldron’s attack with a flash.</p><p>The cauldron failed to suppress the ancient Phoenix mirror. The terrifying power hit the altar below, shattering it and sending rocks flying.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>On the other side, the ancient Phoenix mirror hit the wall above him, sending gravel flying. The ancient Phoenix mirror directly pierced through the mountain, creating a passage, and the ancient Phoenix mirror flew out along the passage.</p><p>“Where are you going?”</p><p>“Chase!”</p><p>The eight Saints rose into the sky and followed the tunnel created by the Phoenix mirror. In the blink of an eye, all the Saints had left the underground cave.</p><p>At that moment, everyone’s eyes were on Phoenix, who was pinned to the wall.</p><p>It was obvious that this was a Saint-level Phoenix, and its entire body was full of treasures.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
