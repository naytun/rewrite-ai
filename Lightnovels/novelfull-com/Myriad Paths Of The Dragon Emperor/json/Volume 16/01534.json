Like an iron tower, he landed on the fighting ring, causing it to rumble.</p><p>...</p><p>“Shorty, let Grandpa Tian Chui’s hammer Scout you!”</p><p>Tian Chui brandished his water-tank-like hammer, revealing a malevolent killing intent.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Right at this moment, Luan Ying moved. His body was like a shadow, suddenly appearing in front of Tian Chui, and a thin and long sword was thrust towards Tian Chui’s heart.</p><p>Fast, accurate, and ruthless!</p><p>He was like a well-trained killer.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Tian Chui’s feet suddenly stomped on the ground as his figure rapidly retreated. Then, the giant hammer appeared in front of him.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The opponent’s long sword was deflected when it struck Tian Chui’s hammer.</p><p>Luan Ying made use of the rebound force, and his body flickered, reappearing above Tian Chui’s head, and the terrifying sword light pierced towards Tian Chui’s head.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Tian Chui roared in anger, and the giant hammer exploded above his head.</p><p>The giant hammer struck, bringing with it a terrifying wind that caused the sky to rumble.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The giant hammer hit the opponent’s sword again.</p><p>However, Luan Ying’s body seemed to be weightless, and he could appear wherever he wanted.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the next moment, Luan Ying appeared behind Tian Chui again and thrust his long sword.</p><p>Tian Chui used his giant hammer to sweep across, forming an impenetrable defense.</p><p>However, Luan Ying’s movement technique was truly too fast. He constantly slithered around Tian Chui’s body, and his long sword was like a poisonous snake, aiming at Tian Chui’s vital points every time.</p><p>“Shadow domain!”</p><p>On the platform, Lu Ming furrowed his eyebrows slightly.</p><p>Luan Ying had comprehended the shadow domain, which allowed him to follow like a shadow. He cultivated the sword Dao of assassination, and when they worked together perfectly, their power was astonishing.</p><p>Martial artists of a higher realm than him could usually kill with one strike.</p><p>It was obvious that the other side had arranged for Luan Ying to challenge Tian Chui, which just happened to be able to restrain Tian Chui, making him unable to use his full strength.</p><p>“Get lost, get lost, get lost!”</p><p>Tian Chui became more and more furious as he continuously struck out with his giant hammer. The sky exploded, bringing with it a terrifying Gale that swept out in all directions.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>All of a sudden, a sword light shot out from beneath Tian Chui’s feet, piercing towards him.</p><p>This sword strike came without any warning and was unbelievably fast.</p><p>This sword strike was actually from Tian Chui’s own shadow. This sword strike had exceeded everyone’s expectations.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Han Xun and Xue ningxin exclaimed in shock.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Tian Chui seemed to have sensed the danger. With a roar, his muscles squirmed and a layer of dragon scales appeared on his skin.</p><p>At the same time, Tian Chui’s figure retreated explosively, avoiding this sword.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The sword light still hit Tian Chui’s leg, and the Dragon scales were cut open, revealing a deep wound.</p><p>If not for Tian Chui’s timely reaction, one of his legs would have been chopped off.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>However, at this moment, his own shadow shot out another sword light from Tian Chui’s feet.</p><p>What a strange attack.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Tian Chui roared as the giant hammer in his hand heavily smashed down on his own shadow.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The giant hammer smashed the sword light directly and smashed into the shadow on the fighting ring.</p><p>The entire fighting ring started to shake.</p><p>Not far away, Luan Ying’s body trembled, and he retreated a few steps. It seemed that Tian Chui’s attack had indirectly injured him.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Then, with a flash, Luan Ying disappeared. At this moment, eight more shadows appeared around Tian Chui. Each of the shadows would shoot out a sword light, stabbing towards Tian Chui.</p><p>Tian Chui used his giant hammer to sweep across, blocking the enemy’s attacks.</p><p>However, the attacks from all four directions were too fast, and Tian Chui found it difficult to completely block them.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>After a while, Tian Chui’s body was covered with several wounds, so deep that his bones could be seen, and blood was flowing out.</p><p>“Hehe, senior brother Luan Ying, you’re going to win!”</p><p>On the side of the heavenly God sect, some disciples sneered.</p><p>On the side of the Dragon God Valley, everyone was watching carefully with a sullen face.</p><p>“Torvosaurus strike!”</p><p>All of a sudden, Tian Chui let out a loud roar. He grabbed the handle of his giant hammer with both hands, lifted it up, and began to spin at an extreme speed.</p><p>The handle of Tian Chui’s hammer was exceptionally long. When it was swung, it was like a hurricane sweeping in all directions.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The eight shadows couldn’t Dodge at all. They were hit and collapsed.</p><p>The eight shadows crumbled and condensed back into one shadow, which turned into Luan Ying’s figure.</p><p>At this moment, the black robe on Luan Ying’s head had been blown to pieces, revealing a dark and gloomy face.</p><p>There was a trace of blood at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>Clearly, he had also been injured by Tian Chui’s attack.</p><p>“Shadow Sword, kill!”</p><p>A deep voice came out of Luan Ying’s mouth. His body slowly became blurry, turned into a shadow, and finally disappeared.</p><p>Luan Ying seemed to have completely disappeared from the fighting ring, and even his aura could not be sensed.</p><p>“Shadow-type spirit body!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, a sword light shot out from the top of Tian Chui’s head, aiming for him.</p><p>The heavenly hammer struck upwards.</p><p>But at the same time, a sword-light appeared beneath Tian Chui’s feet, on his left and right, and stabbed towards him.</p><p>Tian Chui roared in anger, his figure rapidly retreating, avoiding the sword light attack.</p><p>However, there was still a ray of sword light that managed to leave a wound on Tian Chui’s body.</p><p>Around the heavenly hammer, sword-lights constantly appeared, without a sound or sign.</p><p>“Torvosaurus strike!”</p><p>Tian Chui roared loudly and once again used the same move as before. He raised the giant hammer and madly spun it.</p><p>However, this time, the sword-light did not collapse. Instead, it passed through the heavenly Hammer’s attack and continued to stab towards it.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>A few more wounds appeared on Tian Chui’s body.</p><p>“What’s going on? Why can’t I attack him?”</p><p>Some disciples of Dragon God Valley said anxiously.</p><p>The opponent was too strange. Tian Chui’s attack was actually unable to hit him.</p><p>“It’s not that the attack can’t hit him, but that the opponent’s shadow can greatly reduce the damage. When Tian Chui’s attack lands on the opponent’s body, the damage is reduced. At the same time, the opponent’s speed is too fast, and most of the attacks have been dodged by him!”</p><p>A ninth level martial Royal realm heaven’s favorite explained in the stands.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar came out of Tian Chui’s mouth. He took a step forward and madly rushed to the side of the fighting stage.</p><p>It looked like he was about to rush off the fighting ring.</p><p>you want to rush to the fighting ring? stay!</p><p>In the air, Luan Ying’s cold voice came.</p><p>Tian Chui acted as if he didn’t hear anything and continued to rush forward.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A terrifying sword light pierced towards the heavenly hammer from behind.</p><p>Tian Chui, who had been charging forward, suddenly stopped and turned around.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>This sword light pierced through Tian Chui’s chest, causing blood to splatter everywhere.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>A cold voice rang out as Luan Ying’s figure appeared in front of Tian Chui.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, Tian Chui let out an earth-shaking dragon roar. A huge Phantom of a barbaric Dragon appeared on his body, and it clawed at Luan Ying.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Luan Ying’s expression changed drastically, but it was too late for him to Dodge at such a close distance.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
