Tian Chui came to Lu Ming’s side.</p><p>...</p><p>Xue ningxin stopped as well. She came to Lu Ming’s side and looked around with a grave expression.</p><p>At this moment, there were at least a hundred people from the deity sect, the Tianyu demonic sect, and the Yudu sect. Their vast auras rose and pressed down on Lu Ming and the others. Cold killing intent filled the void.</p><p>“Now, I don’t even need to make a move. They’re all dead!”</p><p>Shi Guan sneered.</p><p>“Do you really think there’s no one in Dragon God Valley? Where are the disciples of Dragon God Valley?”</p><p>The cold wave shouted, its voice spreading far and wide.</p><p>“Senior brother, let me help you!”</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>One voice after another was heard. Then, one figure after another cut through the void and landed behind the cold wave. They were the disciples of Dragon God Valley.</p><p>Disciples of Dragon God Valley rushed out of the crowd.</p><p>everyone, this matter was caused by the three people from Cloud Dragon Valley. Why should we get involved in this? ”</p><p>Among the crowd, he Yu stood in front of a few Dragon God Valley disciples and said.</p><p>Lu Ming being surrounded by the three sects was exactly what he wanted. He could not wait for Lu Ming to be killed. Naturally, he did not want others to help him.</p><p>although we, the Seven Valleys of the Dragon God, have some competition with each other, we must be of the same breath and branch when facing outsiders. If you’re not going to make a move, get out of my way!</p><p>let’s go! a disciple of the Black Dragon Valley shouted coldly and flew toward the battlefield.</p><p>The other people of Dragon God Valley also flew to the battlefield.</p><p>Hmph! he Yu’s expression was unsightly as he snorted coldly and blended into the crowd.</p><p>How could he make a move?</p><p>Behind the cold wave, more than forty Dragon God Valley disciples gathered. The aura of both sides burst out. The space was full of solemnity and the atmosphere was extremely oppressive.</p><p>frostwave, how naive you are to think that your Dragon God Valley sect can compete with our three sects. Well then, I’ll make you all stay here today!</p><p>Shi Guan’s eyes revealed a cold killing intent.</p><p>At the scene, the three sects had an absolute advantage. They could take this opportunity to kill a group of Dragon God Valley’s elites and weaken the strength of Dragon God Valley.</p><p>“Who do you want to keep?”</p><p>A faint voice came from the sky.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Then, a terrifying aura came from the sky and pressed down on Shi Guan.</p><p>Shi Guan’s expression changed greatly. He roared and the Holy Light on his body burst out with all its strength to resist this aura. However, the Holy Light on his body trembled rapidly, and his body could not help but retreat a few steps. He looked at the sky with an ugly expression.</p><p>“Zifeng!”</p><p>Shi Guan roared in anger, his eyes revealing a serious expression.</p><p>At this moment, everyone’s eyes were also looking up at the sky.</p><p>In the sky, a purple-robed young man stood with his hands behind his back. His indifferent gaze swept across the three sects.</p><p>Zi Feng, the number one genius of Dragon God Valley, one of the top ten geniuses of the Azure region.</p><p>A message appeared in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>“Senior brother Zi Feng!”</p><p>“It’s senior brother Zi Feng!”</p><p>The other disciples of Dragon God Valley were overjoyed.</p><p>Zi Feng arrived. They knew that even if they fought today, they would not lose either.</p><p>“Zi Feng, you want to interfere?”</p><p>Shi Guan looked at Zi Feng with an unsightly expression as he said.</p><p>Although his battle prowess was strong, when facing Zi Feng, this kind of monster-level genius from the Azure state, it was simply not enough to look at. He would most likely be able to kill him in one move.</p><p>you three sects are ganging up to bully my Dragon God Valley. What’s wrong with me interfering? ”</p><p>Zi Feng spoke indifferently, taking a step forward.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar came from his body and the shadow of a purple dragon soared into the sky. A terrifying pressure pressed down on the disciples of the deity sect, sky demon sect, and Yu Du sect.</p><p>The expressions of the disciples from the three factions changed drastically. They felt as if a huge rock was pressing down on their bodies, and even their breathing became difficult.</p><p>“This kind of pressure? So strong, is this the combat strength of a heaven’s favorite?”</p><p>I can’t fight back at all. It’s like I’m facing a Saint realm expert!</p><p>The disciples of the three sects were all terrified.</p><p>Their combat strength was too different from Zi Feng’s. If they attacked, they could only be slaughtered.</p><p>“Zi Feng, as one of the Azure continent’s top ten monstrous talents, you actually want to make a move against these ordinary disciples. Aren’t you afraid of being laughed at by others?”</p><p>At this moment, a domineering voice sounded.</p><p>A burly figure stepped through the air and stood not far away from Zi Feng. The demonic Qi on his body soared to the sky. A powerful aura rushed out and crushed the aura emitted by Zi Feng. The disciples of the three sects felt their bodies become lighter.</p><p>“Senior brother Mo Yang!”</p><p>The disciples of the Tian Yu demonic sect cried out in surprise.</p><p>Mo Yang, one of the ten great monstrous geniuses, is also here!</p><p>Some of the spectators gasped in shock and excitement.</p><p>Two of the top ten demon-level geniuses of the Azure region had arrived. Could it be that the top ten demon-level geniuses were going to make their move earlier today?</p><p>The ten great demon-level geniuses of the Azure region, aside from the time they had fought in the Azure region’s treasure sealing assembly three years ago, each and every one of them had been cultivating in seclusion in order to suppress everyone else in this time’s treasure sealing assembly. It had already been three years since they had fought.</p><p>Everyone was very curious. After three years, how powerful had the top ten geniuses become?</p><p>“Laughed at? Don’t you think that the three great sects, the heavenly God sect, the heavenly universe demonic sect, and the Yu Du sect, are the real jokes?”</p><p>generally speaking, those at the seventh level martial Royal realm and above are preparing for the treasure fixing assembly and will not easily take action. The period before the assembly is the stage for the geniuses below the seventh level martial Royal realm. They will clash again and again. Those above the seventh level are generally not allowed to interfere. But what about you? ”</p><p>Speaking up to here, Zi Feng’s gaze swept across the heaven God sect’s three great sect’s disciples.</p><p>Among these people, at least one-third of them were youths at the seventh rank or above.</p><p>that’s right. The tianshen sect, the Tianyu demonic sect, and the Yudu sect took the lead to besiege us. They surrounded and killed two disciples at the sixth level and one at the fourth level of the Martial Emperor realm. However, they were no match for our disciples. In the end, even Shi Guan made a move and it was a sneak attack. What a joke!</p><p>The cold wave also spoke coldly, full of ridicule.</p><p>Shi Guan’s expression was extremely ugly.</p><p>Zi Feng and Han Chao were right. Before the treasure sealing assembly, it was a battle between disciples below the 7th level Martial Emperor realm. Those above the 7th level would not interfere.</p><p>Previously, if he had killed Lu Ming and the other two quickly and left, it would have been fine. However, now that he had done this, he would definitely be criticized and dissatisfied by the other sects.</p><p>There were thirteen top sects in the Azure continent, and they were not the only ones.</p><p>This was the unspoken rule of the thirteen sects.</p><p>alright, in that case, I’ll see you at the treasure auction in ten days. Let’s see how strong the reserve forces of Dragon God Valley are!</p><p>Mo Yang said in a domineering manner.</p><p>“That’s right. The treasure auction will be held in 10 days. Unless Dragon God Valley retreats, I’ll see how you die. Unless the Dragon God Valley doesn’t participate. Hehe, if that’s the case, then the Dragon God Valley’s treasure determining assembly can end in advance!”</p><p>Shi Guan coldly spoke.</p><p>He knew that with the arrival of Zi Feng and Mo Yang, these two monstrous geniuses, the battle today would definitely not happen.</p><p>Because they had broken the rules first, if they really wanted to attack, other top sects would probably interfere, and even Saint realm elders would come.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
