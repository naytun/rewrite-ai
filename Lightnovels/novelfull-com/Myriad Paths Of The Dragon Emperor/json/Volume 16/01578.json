They thought that Lu Ming had seen the treasure eye open and wanted to rush over but was afraid at the last minute.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. His glabella glowed and the air-frozen bead appeared in his palm.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming dashed into a tornado.</p><p>Everyone present was stunned.</p><p>He did not expect that Lu Ming would really rush into the hurricane.</p><p>that kid has a rare treasure. He’s not afraid of the hurricane!</p><p>Someone reacted.</p><p>“It’s that bead. Who’s that kid? We must take him down!”</p><p>A half-Saint expert of the tianshen sect shouted coldly with a burning light in his eyes.</p><p>There was actually someone who had a rare treasure and was unafraid of the hurricane. If they obtained it, wouldn’t they be able to enter the mountains directly?</p><p>“Damn it, that guy, could he have entered the mountain alone?”</p><p>When the others spoke, it immediately caused the people from the heaven deity sect and the Yu Du sect to be incomparably furious.</p><p>They had already sent back the news that the Saint realm experts would arrive soon. However, someone had actually rushed into the mountain first with a rare treasure.</p><p>“If we surround this place, even if that brat gets some treasure, he won’t be able to escape. Once he comes out, we’ll kill him!”</p><p>The half-Saint expert of the tianshen sect said indifferently.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At this moment, the tornado that Lu Ming had entered actually moved. It moved in the direction of the people from the heavenly God sect.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Everyone from the heaven God sect was shocked and quickly retreated.</p><p>that kid’s treasure can actually control hurricanes!</p><p>The half-Saint of the tianshen sect roared, and the fiery light in his eyes became stronger.</p><p>He was right. The air-frozen bead could indeed control hurricanes.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming was using the air-frozen bead to control the hurricane!</p><p>Lu Ming had discovered this when he was in the hurricane. After the air-frozen bead absorbed dozens of wind crystals, it gained the ability to control the hurricane.</p><p>Lu Ming was in the middle of the hurricane. He controlled the hurricane and swept it towards the people of the tianshen sect. The speed of the hurricane became faster and faster.</p><p>“Damn it, retreat, retreat!”</p><p>The people of the heavenly God sect shouted and quickly retreated.</p><p>Even a Saint would die if he entered the hurricane, let alone them.</p><p>Not far away, Tian Chui and the other two were dumbstruck when they saw this.</p><p>haha, as expected of Junior Brother Lu Ming. Amazing!</p><p>After being stunned for a while, Tian Chui joyfully said.</p><p>The people of the heavenly God sect retreated quickly. The speed at which Lu Ming controlled the hurricane became faster and faster. It was many times faster than when he moved naturally previously. He was closely following the people of the heavenly God sect.</p><p>The others were shocked.</p><p>To be able to control a hurricane, he was simply undefeatable in this place.</p><p>“Damn it, who is that kid? They dare to oppose our Tian Shen sect. Investigate, we must investigate!”</p><p>A half-Saint of the heavenly God sect roared.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>At this moment, a hurricane suddenly moved from the side and rushed towards the people of the heaven God sect.</p><p>In the heavenly wind plain, there were some hurricanes surrounding the mountain, but there were still many hurricanes that stopped in various parts of the heavenly wind plain.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was controlling a hurricane from a long distance and it rushed towards the people of the heavenly God sect.</p><p>Of course, there was a limit to such long-distance control. If it was too far away, it could not be controlled.</p><p>This time, dozens of people from the tianshen sect were caught off guard and were swept into the hurricane, including a half-Saint expert.</p><p>A series of screams rang out. Those below the half-Saint realm were instantly cut into pieces by the hurricane. Only the half-Saint expert was still holding on.</p><p>A holy weapon appeared on his body and blocked the wind around him.</p><p>“No, quickly let me out!”</p><p>The half-Saint expert shouted in fear.</p><p>He wanted to charge forward with all his might, but with his cultivation, he couldn’t get out of the tornado at all. The terrifying wind kept bombarding his Saint weapon, making it tremble. It didn’t look like it could last much longer.</p><p>“Ah, let me out quickly. Brat, you dare to offend my Tian Shen sect? you’re courting death …”</p><p>The half-Saint was still shouting and threatening Lu Ming to let him go.</p><p>how sad. Rest in peace!</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold voice was heard.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming’s voice had also been deliberately changed. No one could tell that he was Lu Ming.</p><p>Then, he controlled the tornado and swept it towards the other people of the Tian Shen sect.</p><p>“Split up and run, split up and run!”</p><p>Some of the remaining experts of the heavenly Divine sect shouted.</p><p>Then, the people of the heavenly God sect scattered and fled in all directions.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in pity. The speed of the tornado was still too slow. It could not catch up with those experts at all. Just now, they were caught off guard and only swept dozens of people from the tianshen sect into the tornado.</p><p>At this moment, the half-Saint expert who had been sucked into the tornado could no longer hold on.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Cracks appeared on his Saint weapon, and then it exploded with a bang.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>The half-Saint screamed in fear and then turned into ashes in the endless terrible wind.</p><p>Everyone was shocked. A half-Saint had been tricked and died just like that.</p><p>Lu Ming walked out of the tornado and the air-frozen bead’s Green light enveloped him.</p><p>The people of the heavenly God sect fixed their eyes on Lu Ming. If looks could kill, Lu Ming would have been riddled with holes.</p><p>“Brat, Who are you? how dare you kill the experts of my heaven God sect?”</p><p>In the distance, Yu Sheng glared at Lu Ming and roared.</p><p>“Those who commit injustice are doomed to destruction. I just don’t like your Tian Shen sect!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“You’re seeking your own death!”</p><p>Yu Sheng roared.</p><p>“Oh, then come and kill me!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Yu Sheng’s expression was ugly.</p><p>What a joke. Asking him to kill Lu Ming now was courting death!</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>A half-Saint of the tianshen sect slashed out a ray of holy light toward Lu Ming. Lu Ming smiled disdainfully and entered the tornado in a flash. The divine light was destroyed by the power of the tornado when it hit.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming controlled the tornado, which continued to stare at the half-Saint and rushed toward him. The half-saint’s expression changed drastically, and he hurriedly turned around and fled.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>The tornado suddenly changed its direction and charged toward the people from the sky demon sect.</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>run! Mo Yang roared as he fled. The other people from the Tian Yu demonic sect also fled.</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the tornado and gave chase. The people of the Tian Yu demon sect and the heavenly God sect were in a state of panic.</p><p>Lu Ming ‘took special care’ of Mo Yang and chased after him, causing Mo Yang to be in a sorry state.</p><p>He was furious. As one of the top ten geniuses of the Azure continent, he was being chased around in public. He had lost all his face.</p><p>As Lu Ming chased after them, he suddenly changed the direction of the wind and rushed towards the people from the desire poison sect.</p><p>It caused the people from the desire poison sect to flee for their lives.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
