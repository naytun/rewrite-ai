When you bought the Liuyuan gloves, I put a kind of powder on you. It’s colorless, odorless, shapeless, and shapeless. No matter where you go or how you mix into the crowd, you won’t be able to escape my tracking!</p><p>The man in the middle explained, ” “Hurry up and hand over your storage ring, or else, die!”</p><p>“If you have the ability, you can try!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>two sixth level martial emperors and one fourth level Martial Emperor. You’re quite arrogant. It’ll be easy for me to kill you!</p><p>The black-robed man in the middle stepped forward. However, his cultivation was also at the sixth level of the martial Royal realm.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The other party waved his hand, and a dense black cloud instantly enveloped the three of them.</p><p>Poisonous insects!</p><p>They were densely packed poisonous insects.</p><p>“So it’s the people from the desire poison sect, I’ll do it!”</p><p>Xue ningxin stepped out, her whole body exuding a cold aura, and struck out a palm.</p><p>The palm Power formed a terrifying cold wave that spread towards the poisonous insect.</p><p>Immediately, the densely packed poisonous insects were frozen. Xue ningxin then shook her palm, and those poisonous insects turned into ice fragments and disappeared.</p><p>“You have some ability, come again!”</p><p>A green mist burst out from the other party’s body, emitting a disgusting stench, and rushed towards Xue ningxin.</p><p>Xue ningxin stepped forward and punched out with both fists.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Each punch sent out a terrifying cold wave that froze the void and the poisonous mist.</p><p>you want to freeze my poisonous gas? in your dreams! Corrode it!</p><p>break! the other party shouted in a low voice, and the mist actually formed into small worms that corroded the ice.</p><p>Then, the poisonous gas rushed towards Xue ningxin.</p><p>“What a terrifying poisonous gas!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>He was well aware of Xue ningxin’s combat power and how terrifying her cold wave was. It could freeze everything, even Zhen Yuan. However, it was corroded by the poison, which showed how terrifying the poison was.</p><p>This person was definitely a peerless genius of the Yu Du sect. No wonder he was so arrogant.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Xue ningxin let out a Dragon’s Roar, and the cold air on her body became even more intense. She kept punching with both fists, and the fist force formed into snow-white true dragons that flew out.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>These true dragons were powerful, and they charged through the mist toward the Yu Du sect’s chosen.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Yu Du sect’s Paragon’s body actually exploded, turning into a cloud of poisonous gas that enveloped Xue ningxin.</p><p>hahaha, my Constitution is the superior earth spiritual body, the thousand desires poisonous body. You can’t hurt me at all!</p><p>The other party’s cold voice came from within the poisonous gas.</p><p>Xue ningxin’s fists continued to bombard, but the poisonous gas rolled, as if it could not hurt her opponent at all. Endless poisonous gas enveloped Xue ningxin.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Dragon’s Roar came from Xue ningxin’s mouth again. Her body began to change rapidly. The black robe on her body burst apart, and in the next moment, a huge Snow Dragon appeared in the sky.</p><p>it’s a real Dragon. You are from Dragon God Valley!</p><p>The voice of the Yu Du sect’s Paragon rang out from within the poisonous gas.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Xue ningxin turned into her true dragon form and let out a long roar. She opened her mouth and spat out a terrifying wave of cold air, which covered the surrounding ten miles of land, turning it into a frozen land.</p><p>This time, some of the poisonous gas was also sealed in ice.</p><p>However, there was still a lot of poisonous gas left. At this time, it actually turned into weapons and attacked Xue ningxin.</p><p>Xue ningxin stepped out with her Dragon Claw and clashed with the weapons.</p><p>The two of them exchanged blows, and it was difficult to determine the winner in a short time.</p><p>that’s a true dragon! Its strength is so terrifying!</p><p>“And the people from the desire poison sect!”</p><p>The battle here was so shocking that many people in the distance were alarmed and flew over.</p><p>There were even people in the Supreme treasure Pavilion who were alarmed and flew over to take a look.</p><p>For a time, the battlefield was surrounded by people.</p><p>what a terrifying combat strength! A Lv 6 martial Royal realm expert has such a strong combat strength!</p><p>they’re definitely top-notch heaven’s favorites with superior earth spiritual body!</p><p>Many people voiced out.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Xue ningxin and the other party had exchanged dozens of moves, and neither of them had won.</p><p>The more the desire poison sect’s chosen fought, the more shocked and impatient he became.</p><p>Initially, he thought that his combat strength was more than enough to take down Lu Ming and the others. Not to mention a sixth level Martial Emperor, he could even easily kill a seventh level Martial Emperor. Even an ordinary eighth level Martial Emperor would be poisoned to death if he was not careful.</p><p>Now, a person of the same level had actually fought him to a draw. He knew that he had encountered a heaven’s favorite of the same level.</p><p>“You guys, quickly attack and kill those two brats!”</p><p>The Paragon of the desire poison sect roared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The other two from the Yu Du sect charged towards Lu Ming and Tian Chui. The aura they revealed was at the peak of the seventh level martial Royal realm.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As soon as the two of them attacked, a dense swarm of poisonous insects pounced on Lu Ming and Tian Chui.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Tian Chui roared in anger as he swung his giant hammer and struck out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The sky trembled violently as the giant hammer struck, bringing with it a terrifying vibration wave. Those poisonous insects exploded one after another and turned into ashes.</p><p>Not only that, the vibration waves did not stop, directly bombarding the bodies of the two Yu Du sect members.</p><p>The bodies of the two Yu Du sect members exploded, turning into green poisonous gas that rolled back and then condensed again.</p><p>It was two young men, currently looking at Tian Chui in shock.</p><p>Although they had a body of poison and could turn into poisonous gas to offset the power of the attack, there was a limit. If the power was too strong, they could still be injured or even killed.</p><p>Tian Chui’s earlier strength had already injured them.</p><p>“Kill! I don’t care what kind of poison body you have, I’ll crush you all!”</p><p>Tian Chui raised his giant hammer and charged at the two Yu Du sect youths. Lu Ming did not even need to do anything.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The two young men from the desire poison sect were shocked. They used their poisonous insects to form a shield to block in front of them, but under the hammer, they all collapsed. The two young men’s bodies were scattered once more and then reformed in the distance. Their faces were pale and blood was flowing out of their mouths.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Tian Chui stepped forward.</p><p>How dare you! Don’t even think about killing my Yu Du sect’s people!</p><p>A few figures flew over from the distance. Before they even arrived, a disgusting poisonous gas was already spreading towards Tian Chui.</p><p>Some from the desire poison sect saw this and joined the battle.</p><p>“Many people?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He took a step forward and appeared in front of the few Yu Du sect members behind him. The devouring power in his palm burst out and enveloped the poisonous gas.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>The poisonous gas was completely devoured by Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming stepped into the void and a nine-Dragon rushed out toward a few of the Yu Du sect’s people, sending them flying.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>On the other side, the person who had been fighting with Xue ningxin turned into a cloud of poisonous gas and retreated quickly, then condensed into a human form.</p><p>It was a pale and cold young man.</p><p>“Set up the poison formation!”</p><p>The cold-faced young man said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
