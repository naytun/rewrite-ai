Many other disciples would also go to watch.</p><p>...</p><p>The location of the treasure settlement party was in a huge building halfway up the Cang mountains.</p><p>The building was circular and empty.</p><p>When Lu Ming and the group arrived, they saw a huge fighting ring in the middle of the building.</p><p>Around the fighting ring, there were 13 huge cylindrical platforms. They were slightly higher than the fighting ring and surrounded it in the middle.</p><p>Looking down from the sky, there was a number on each of the cylindrical platforms. From one to thirteen, they were arranged counterclockwise in order.</p><p>On the outer side of the cylindrical platform were rows of grandstands. The terrain was slightly higher than the cylindrical platform, so those sitting on the grandstands could clearly see the situation on the fighting stage.</p><p>Further out of the grandstand, there were many pavilions built at an even higher location.</p><p>we participants will land on those platforms. Let’s go down!</p><p>Han Xun said as he descended.</p><p>They didn’t deliberately pick a platform and landed on the tenth platform.</p><p>The Saint realm elder flew into a Pavilion.</p><p>The other Dragon God Valley disciples who had come with Lu Ming and the others landed on the stands behind the tenth platform.</p><p>“Your Dragon God Valley sect is early!”</p><p>A cold voice rang out. In the sky, holy light filled the air. The people of the tianshen sect had arrived.</p><p>The people of the heavenly God sect did not hold back and directly landed on the first platform.</p><p>As for the disciples of the heavenly God sect who were not participating, they landed on the grandstand behind the first platform.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At this time, the sound of the air being torn could be heard. In the sky, dense crowds of people were flying over.</p><p>The thirteen top sects arrived one after another. Each sect had thirty-six participating disciples who landed on the platform.</p><p>The other disciples landed on the grandstand.</p><p>The Tianyu demonic sect landed on the second platform.</p><p>Heaven seat King, platform number three.</p><p>Evil moon sect, platform number four.</p><p>Desire poison sect, platform No. 5.</p><p>Jiuxiao sword sect, platform number six.</p><p>Linglong Palace, platform No. 7.</p><p>Platform number eight was empty, and there were still sects that had not arrived.</p><p>Intentionless saber sect, platform No. 9.</p><p>The tenth platform was Dragon God Valley, and the eleventh platform was poyuan family.</p><p>Platform number twelve was the blood demon tower.</p><p>Platform number 13 was the demon Castle.</p><p>Of the thirteen top sects, there was still one sect that had not come. It was the most mysterious life-and-death Sword sect.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>At this time, sword lights broke through the air. The people of the life-and-death Sword sect had arrived.</p><p>“So few people?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked over and could not help being stunned.</p><p>The life-and-death Sword sect had sent a total of thirteen people.</p><p>Excluding the old man who was leading the group, there were only twelve people in the younger generation.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The twelve youths of the life and death Sword sect landed on the eighth platform. All thirteen sects had arrived.</p><p>Lu Ming, the life-and-death Sword sect. Due to its strict requirements for accepting disciples, it has the least number of people. Every time they participate in the treasure auction, there are always twelve people. Sometimes, they might not even be able to gather enough people. Although they are at a disadvantage with fewer people, no one dares to look down on them. This is because every member of the life-and-death Sword sect is a genius. They cultivate the life-and-death Sword technique and are extremely powerful!</p><p>Xue ningxin explained softly.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He saw a familiar face in the life and death Sword sect, Luo Xiang.</p><p>He had a deep impression of this person. He had stayed at the peak of the Supreme-being realm and had nurtured his sword soul for 15 years. This was an extremely terrifying person.</p><p>hehe, Dragon God Valley, you really dare to come!</p><p>In the Tian Yu demon sect, mo he’s cold gaze fell on Dragon God Valley and Lu Ming.</p><p>isn’t it better that they’re here? this time, let’s make everyone from Dragon God Valley stay here!</p><p>One of the heaven’s pride experts of the tianshen sect said coldly. Holy light was faintly visible on his body, and his eyes were filled with killing intent.</p><p>“That’s right, it’s best not to leave a single one alive!”</p><p>In the desire poison sect, the young man who had intercepted Lu Ming’s group earlier spoke coldly, his eyes glaring fiercely at Lu Ming’s group.</p><p>strength is not something that can be determined by words. We’ll know who lives and who dies later!</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently, his fists clenched slightly.</p><p>This time, he would kill to his heart’s content!</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m going to take your life!”</p><p>Mo he pointed at Lu Ming and a ray of Saber Light condensed.</p><p>“I’m going to take your life too!”</p><p>Lu Ming responded indifferently.</p><p>The Dragon God Valley, the Tianyu demon sect, the Yudu sect, and the tianshen sect were already filled with the smell of gunpowder even before the battle started.</p><p>Not only them.</p><p>The other sects also had their own conflicts. At this moment, they were also looking at each other with killing intent, filling the scene with a solemn atmosphere.</p><p>At this time, in a courtyard of the Tian Shen sect, the Son of God stood with his hands behind his back. Shi Guan stood respectfully behind the Son of God and reported the situation.</p><p>I didn’t expect that so many things would happen when I arrived a few days late. The people of Dragon God Valley are getting bolder and bolder. You are also useless. You can’t even kill a few people who are below the seventh level of the martial Royal realm!</p><p>The Divine Child said coldly, his voice cold.</p><p>if it wasn’t for that kid’s strangeness and his pet that can affect time and space, I would’ve killed him long ago!</p><p>Shi Guan said.</p><p>The space-time spirit rat was a legendary creature, and not everyone knew it. Even Shi Guan did not recognize it as a space-time spirit rat.</p><p>“A pet that can affect time and space!”</p><p>The Son of God’s eyes suddenly turned cold, and a cold killing intent burst out of his body.</p><p>“Tell me, what does that kid look like? and what do his two companions look like? Is there a true dragon among them?”</p><p>The Son of God asked a few questions.</p><p>“There is indeed a true dragon, a Snow Dragon, and …”</p><p>Then, the stone crown described the image and appearance of Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>it’s really these kids. They dared to trick me in the Dragon Palace!</p><p>The Son of God’s eyes were cold.</p><p>Back then, in the Dragon Palace, he had used an ancient void-sealing God talisman to suppress the Black Dragon’s corpse. However, someone had sabotaged the ancient talisman and allowed the Black Dragon to escape. All his efforts were in vain.</p><p>He had always wanted to find out who the person who secretly did it was. Now, he knew that it was Lu Ming.</p><p>If it was not Lu Ming, who else could it be that could affect time and space?</p><p>you reckless fool! Where is he now? I’ll go and kill him!</p><p>The Son of God’s body emitted a cold killing intent.</p><p>Divine Son, that Lu Ming should be participating in the treasure auction. The 13 top sects are gathered here. If we attack now, I’m afraid it will incur the wrath of the other sects!</p><p>Shi Guan hurriedly said.</p><p>“Then, it won’t be too late to kill him after the treasure auction!”</p><p>After saying that, the Son of God took a step forward and disappeared.</p><p>At the venue of the treasure auction, the smell of gunpowder was getting stronger and stronger.</p><p>At that moment, an old man appeared in the fighting ring.</p><p>This old man was dressed in white. He was a Saint realm elder of the divine sky sect.</p><p>In the past few years, the strength of the Tian Shen sect had become stronger and stronger. They had already won first place in two consecutive treasure fixing conventions. Even in the small treasure fixing conventions, the Tian Shen sect had won first place twice.</p><p>The tianshen sect had already announced that they wanted to win three consecutive championships. Regardless of whether it was the General Assembly or the small assembly, they wanted to obtain first place.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
