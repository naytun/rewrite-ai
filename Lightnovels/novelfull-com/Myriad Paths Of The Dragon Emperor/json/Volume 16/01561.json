He had lost all sense of self-awareness and had fallen into a frenzy of killing.</p><p>Later, because of a little girl, he became a little more clear-headed and stopped killing. But it was too late. By that time, many people in this Castle had already died in his hands.</p><p>...</p><p>It was also because he had recovered a bit of his consciousness that he had some impression of this Castle.</p><p>“Since you’re here, let’s go pay our respects!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed slightly.</p><p>The people in this Castle could be said to have no grudges with him, but he had killed many of them. Lu Ming felt guilty.</p><p>Lu Ming had always been a person who drew a clear line between gratitude and grudges. He would take revenge for grudges and repay kindness for kindness. He would never kill the innocent.</p><p>The people he had killed were all people who had enmity with him or wanted to kill him.</p><p>Lu Ming would never have done that if he had not been influenced by his endless killing intent.</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming stepped forward.</p><p>“Who’s there? This is the Lu clan’s Castle, stop!”</p><p>As they neared the castle, a few burly men flew out and stood in front of Lu Ming, looking at him warily.</p><p>“The Lu clan? You have the same surname as me!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He cupped his fists and said, I’m lu Ming, a disciple of the Dragon God Valley. I heard that the Lu clan Fort was attacked half a year ago, and many people were killed or injured. I’m here to pay my respects!</p><p>Are you a disciple of the Dragon God Valley? ”</p><p>The few burly men’s expressions changed.</p><p>“That’s right, this is my identity token!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out the Dragon God Valley identity token and handed it to the other party.</p><p>The other party took a look, and his expression eased a lot. He said, ” so it’s the disciple of Dragon God Valley. I’ve been disrespectful!</p><p>This place was not very far from Dragon God Valley. Small forces like them were still in awe of a big sect like Dragon God Valley.</p><p>my ancestors used to be friends with the Lu clan. I’m here to pay my respects when I heard the bad news about the Lu clan!</p><p>Lu Ming repeated.</p><p>yes. Half a year ago, the Lu clan was suddenly attacked by a demon and suffered heavy casualties. I wonder if the demon was sent by our enemy. Young master, please follow me!</p><p>One of the burly men sighed, then made a ‘please’ gesture and walked forward.</p><p>Lu Ming felt helpless. The devil that the other party was referring to was naturally him.</p><p>He followed the burly man and flew for a while before arriving at the back of the castle.</p><p>There were many tombstones here.</p><p>“Half a year ago, more than 100 people died and were all buried here!”</p><p>The burly man said.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the tombstones, then cupped his fists and bowed deeply.</p><p>“Although Lu Ming had no choice that day, it was still his fault. From now on, the Lu clan’s Fort’s matters are Lu Ming’s matters!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered in his heart.</p><p>“Big brother, it’s you?”</p><p>Suddenly, a crisp and tender voice sounded.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and was shocked.</p><p>A young woman and a little girl of six or seven years old were standing not far away.</p><p>The little girl was looking at Lu Ming with her big, black eyes.</p><p>This little girl was the one who helped Lu Ming regain his consciousness during the massacre. The young woman was the little girl’s mother.</p><p>“Big brother!”</p><p>The little girl called out again. In her large eyes, there was a hint of fear, but there was more curiosity.</p><p>“This little girl recognized me!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled. He felt that it was somewhat unbelievable.</p><p>Half a year ago, when the power of the third bloodline surged in, Lu Ming’s appearance was completely different from now. Back then, his eyes and hair were blood-red, and his body was covered with bone spikes. He looked like a demon. Even his aura was completely different.</p><p>Even a martial arts powerhouse would not be able to recognize Lu Ming. This little girl did not seem to have started cultivating. How could she recognize him?</p><p>“Xiang Xiang, do you know this big brother?”</p><p>The little girl’s mother asked.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>The little girl nodded and didn’t say much.</p><p>young Madam, this is an expert from the Dragon God Valley. His ancestors used to be friends with the Lu clan. He has heard of the bad news and is here to pay his respects!</p><p>The burly man explained.</p><p>so you’re a disciple of the Dragon God Valley. Thank you for coming to pay your respects!</p><p>The young woman bowed to Lu Ming.</p><p>“You’re welcome!”</p><p>Lu Ming returned the salute with cupped fists. He then looked at the little girl and said,”What’s your name?”</p><p>“My name is Xiangxiang, Lu Xiangxiang!”</p><p>The trace of fear in the little girl’s eyes slowly faded. She looked at Lu Ming curiously.</p><p>“Xiangxiang, good name!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. At this moment, his eyes emitted a strange glow as he sized up the little girl.</p><p>He was very curious about this little girl.</p><p>How did the other party recognize him?</p><p>Moreover, this little girl was able to make him recover from the killing. It was definitely not because of her young age that Lu Ming felt compassion for her.</p><p>Back then, he had completely lost his mind and had no compassion. All he had was to kill!</p><p>There must be another reason.</p><p>Lu Ming was now casting a secret skill.</p><p>This secret skill was obtained from the memory fragments of the nine Dragons. When this secret skill was used, it could roughly see a person’s physique and check a person’s talent.</p><p>Of course, this was under the condition that the other party didn’t resist with true essence at all.</p><p>In Lu Ming’s eyes, Lu Xiangxiang had changed. She seemed to have turned into a ball of light, a ball of dazzling radiance, filled with endless vitality.</p><p>what a strange physique! What an amazing physique!</p><p>After a long while, Lu Ming removed the secret skill and his eyes were filled with surprise.</p><p>A peerless genius!</p><p>This little girl was simply a peerless genius. She was more talented than any other geniuses that Lu Ming had met.</p><p>She was like a piece of unpolished jade that had not been carved.</p><p>Even Lu Ming was shocked by the vast vitality hidden deep in his body.</p><p>“Could it be the legendary body of life?”</p><p>Lu Ming thought of a legend and he was shocked.</p><p>In this world, there were some terrifying physiques that were born from birth. It was difficult to discover them unless one had special means. However, they were universally shocking. The body of life was one of them.</p><p>if it’s a living body, then it can explain why the other party was able to make me regain a trace of consciousness. It can also explain why the other party was able to recognize me!</p><p>Lu Ming’s thoughts were flying.</p><p>The body of life was astonishingly sensitive to all kinds of living creatures. As long as he could recognize a person through their life characteristics, this was a talent that outsiders could not learn.</p><p>“The two of you, Lu Ming has something to do and would like to have a private chat with Xiangxiang. Is that alright?”</p><p>Lu Ming said to the young woman and the middle-aged man.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>The young woman was a little hesitant.</p><p>don’t worry. I can see that Xiangxiang is very talented and have the intention to take her as my disciple. So, I have a few questions to ask!</p><p>Lu Ming explained.</p><p>“Take Xiangxiang as a disciple?”</p><p>The young woman’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Lu Ming was an outstanding disciple of Dragon God Valley. If Xiangxiang Beila could be her disciple, she would naturally be happy.</p><p>“Alright, young master, please ask!”</p><p>The young woman hurriedly said before leaving with the large man, standing in the distance and looking over.</p><p>Only Lu Ming and Xiangxiang remained at the scene.</p><p>“Xiang Xiang, since you know who I am, aren’t you afraid of me? Don’t you hate me?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Xiangxiang Beila and asked.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
