The inscription scroll automatically burned and turned into ashes.</p><p>...</p><p>Inscription scrolls were usually disposable.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The imprisonment of the void failed. The Black Dragon let out a long roar, and its Dragon might was vast and mighty. Its entire body burst out with black light.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The black true dragon struck out with its claws and heavily hit the White jade Pagoda, sending it flying.</p><p>Then, the black true dragon let out a long roar and soared into the sky. It directly smashed a big hole in the ceiling of the hall and flew out.</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>Debris flew everywhere. A huge hole appeared above the Dragon Palace, and a black true dragon was about to fly out.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>The Son of God roared as he scanned the surroundings, exuding an extremely cold killing intent.</p><p>Just now, someone had secretly tampered with it and broke his God prohibited void, allowing the black true dragon to escape.</p><p>The godchild’s killing intent had reached its peak after losing such a great opportunity and an ancient God-forbidden scroll.</p><p>No one made a sound!</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>With a flash of sword light, the king Sword soared into the sky and chased after the Black Dragon.</p><p>The Son of God let out an angry roar and also rose into the sky, chasing after the black true dragon.</p><p>“Let’s go take a look!”</p><p>“That’s right, we should at least get a share of the loot!”</p><p>The other experts all rushed into the sky and rushed towards the hole above their heads.</p><p>Light scattered from above. The black true dragon had just pierced through the roof of the Dragon Palace and rushed out of it.</p><p>“That’s a true dragon? No, a true Dragon’s corpse?”</p><p>“Let’s go take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest could still hear the sounds coming from outside.</p><p>It was obvious that the people who couldn’t Enter the Dragon Palace were all shocked when they saw the Black Dragon fly out.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Following that, a Dragon’s Roar rang out. It was clear that the black true dragon had been caught up and was about to engage in another great battle with the divine Son and the others.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>On Lu Ming’s shoulder, bubbles were calling. Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Just now, Lu Ming had made bubbles destroy the divine son’s God-forbidden void.</p><p>Bubbles was a space-time spirit mouse and could control time and space. It was easy for her to destroy space in secret without anyone noticing.</p><p>“What should we do? Are you going out to watch the show?”</p><p>Said Tian Chui, feeling somewhat depressed.</p><p>They had obtained nothing from the Dragon Palace except for some refining materials.</p><p>As for the true Dragon’s corpse, he could only look on helplessly. How could he not be depressed when he couldn’t fight for it?</p><p>all true dragons like to build a treasure vault. It’s very secretive, and I’m guessing that it hasn’t been discovered yet!</p><p>At this moment, Xue ningxin spoke.</p><p>“Treasury?”</p><p>Tian Chui’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Xue ningxin was a genuine true dragon, so she naturally understood the habits of true dragons the best.</p><p>that’s right! Xue ningxin nodded and said, ” and that Treasury is extremely well hidden. It’s most likely not far from the true Dragon’s corpse!</p><p>it’s not far. It’s very likely that it’s in this Hall!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Not bad!” Xue Xin nodded.</p><p>then let’s hurry up and look for it. When those guys come back, we won’t have anything to do with it!</p><p>Tian Chui said. He then rushed out and looked around, searching for any hidden doors.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xue ningxin also looked around.</p><p>However, after carefully looking around the hall, they did not discover anything.</p><p>“Don’t tell me it’s under the Dragon coffin!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming shifted his gaze to the Dragon coffin.</p><p>“It’s possible!” Xue ningxin’s eyes lit up.</p><p>If it was under the Dragon coffin, wouldn’t it be the closest to the Black Dragon?</p><p>“Haha, hurry up!”</p><p>Tian Chui hurriedly rushed over, his two palms pressing on the Dragon coffin. His muscles bulged, and he pushed it with great force.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The huge Dragon coffin was pushed up by Tian Chui.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xue ningxin also went to help. The three of them worked together and moved the Dragon coffin.</p><p>“There’s a door!”</p><p>As the Dragon coffin was moved away, the eyes of the three people lit up.</p><p>There was obviously a door at the bottom of the Dragon coffin. From the appearance of the door, the true dragon Treasury was most likely below.</p><p>“Break this door!”</p><p>A giant hammer appeared in Tian Chui’s hands.</p><p>“Wait a moment!”</p><p>Lu Ming cried out. Then, the space between his brows glowed. Dense inscriptions appeared in the void, forming a large array. This large array could isolate sound.</p><p>This was the inscription of the secondary body. Through Lu Ming, he was inscribing the array.</p><p>“Junior Brother is so thoughtful!”</p><p>Tian Chui’s lips curled into a smile as he lifted up his giant hammer and heavily smashed it against the door.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The giant hammer smashed down with a violent boom. If it wasn’t for the sound-isolating formation, it would have definitely alerted the people outside.</p><p>However, the door on the ground was completely fine after the hammer hit it. It only left a faint mark.</p><p>it’s so hard. I don’t believe it. Again!</p><p>Tian Chui continued to lift up his giant hammer and smashed it down once more.</p><p>But it was useless, it did not move at all.</p><p>The heavenly hammer struck seven or eight times in a row, but the result was the same.</p><p>“No, it can’t be opened!”</p><p>Tian Chui helplessly said.</p><p>this door can only be opened with a special method. Brute force is useless!</p><p>Lu Ming observed carefully.</p><p>I’ve heard that some true dragons use their own blood as a key to seal the door to the treasure vault and test my blood!</p><p>Xue ningxin said after thinking for a moment.</p><p>Then, with a wave of her hand, Xue ningxin made a cut on her Jade-like arm. Crystal-like blood dripped onto the ground.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The ground suddenly trembled and rumbled. Then, the door on the ground split open, revealing an underground secret room.</p><p>As soon as the door opened, a bright light spread out from below.</p><p>“It’s open, let’s go down!”</p><p>Their eyes lit up and they flew down.</p><p>Below them was a secret room. The moment they went down, the three of them were stunned.</p><p>Treasures, they were all treasures.</p><p>At a glance, it was all treasures, piled up like a mountain.</p><p>There were all sorts of sparkling materials, some for spirit weapons and some for Saint weapons, but they all had one thing in common, which was that they were all sparkling and sparkling.</p><p>There were also all sorts of spirit weapons.</p><p>Lu Ming took a glance and discovered that there were spiritual weapons of various levels. There were even low-level spiritual weapons. They were all sparkling and resplendent. Some spiritual treasures were even embedded with gems.</p><p>He even saw piles of night pearls.</p><p>Of course, there were also piles of raw gemstones.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s gaze was fixed on the dozen or so balls of light floating in the air.</p><p>A holy weapon!</p><p>The dozen or so balls of light were all holy weapons.</p><p>More than ten holy weapons. Lu Ming’s heart started to race.</p><p>“Put it away, let’s quickly put it away!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>If they were discovered by the Son of God and the others, they wouldn’t have a share.</p><p>yes, quickly put it away. We’ll tidy it up after we get out!</p><p>Tian Chui said.</p><p>The three of them took out their interspatial rings and each of them took a few Saint weapons. Then, they placed the forging materials, spirit weapons, orirocks, and other items into their interspatial rings.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
