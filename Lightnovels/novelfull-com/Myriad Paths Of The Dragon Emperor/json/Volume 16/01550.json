He did not change his mind at all because of Lu Ming’s words. The killing intent in his eyes was as cold as a knife.</p><p>“Hehe, what a joke, what goading? It’s obvious that you’re afraid, or rather, the tianshen sect is afraid. They’re afraid that I’ll grow up, so they sent you here to find a random reason to kill me. Otherwise, why would you not even dare to accept the challenge?”</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“No matter how glib your tongue is, you will still die today!”</p><p>die! the Son of God shouted coldly. Holy light burst forth, forming a blade of holy light that illuminated the world.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar erupted from Zi Feng’s mouth, pressing towards the divine Son.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The sage realm elder of Dragon God Valley shouted. He wanted to rush over to help, but he was blocked by the sage realm elder of the tianshen sect. In addition, the elder of the Yu Du sect was watching him like a tiger watching its prey. He could not rush over at all.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Tian Chui and Xue ningxin, preparing to leave.</p><p>However, at this moment, the wind and clouds in the sky stirred, and a foot appeared in the void.</p><p>This foot was like a giant’s foot. It was incomparably huge. It descended from the sky and stomped down on the Son of God.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>The Son of God let out a long cry, and holy light burst forth. He struck out with his palm toward the sky, forming a huge palm print of holy light that blasted toward the giant foot.</p><p>However, when the palm print came into contact with the giant foot, the palm print immediately collapsed. The giant foot did not stop and continued to step on the Son of God.</p><p>The Son of God roared, and a white jade Pagoda appeared on his body. The White jade Pagoda enlarged, and a vast Saint might burst out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The giant foot stepped on the White jade Pagoda, causing it to shake madly. The light screen on the pagoda immediately collapsed.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Son of God’s body fell down like a meteorite, crashing into the fighting ring.</p><p>The fighting stage let out a terrible roar and cracks appeared on it. It should be known that the fighting stage was very hard. Lu Ming and the others had fought all the way here but could not leave a mark on the fighting stage. But now, the fighting stage was cracked.</p><p>The Son of God’s face was pale and he spat out a mouthful of blood. He struggled to get up, his hair flying in the wind. He was filled with killing intent as he stared at the sky.</p><p>A burly figure appeared in the sky and descended.</p><p>This figure looked to be in his thirties. He had a burly figure and exuded a vast aura.</p><p>“Third senior brother, it’s third senior brother!”</p><p>“Third senior brother is here, that’s great!”</p><p>When Tian Chui and Xue ningxin saw this man, they both cried out in excitement.</p><p>“Third senior?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>His master, the valley master of Cloud Dragon Valley, had accepted a total of nine legacy disciples. However, Lu Ming had only seen his second senior brother Longyuan Shan, Tian Chui, and Xue ningxin. He had never seen any of his other senior brothers and sisters.</p><p>However, he had heard that his third senior brother, yang tianzong, had made a breakthrough to sage realm more than ten years ago, and he often went out to train. He didn’t expect to see him here.</p><p>“Seventh Junior Brother, eighth Junior Sister, long time no see!”</p><p>Yang Tiancheng and Xue ningxin nodded. They then looked at Lu Ming and said, this must be Little Junior Brother. He’s indeed a Dragon among men!</p><p>“Lu Ming greets third senior brother!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists at yang tianzong.</p><p>hahaha, no need to be so polite. We’ll talk after we’ve settled the matter here!</p><p>Yang tianzong laughed and looked at the Son of God. He sneered, ” “You’re very arrogant. Come, let me see what you’re capable of.”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Yang tianzong took a step forward and a terrifying aura emanated from his body.</p><p>That was the might of a Saint, the aura of a Saint.</p><p>The terrifying aura of a Saint pressed towards the Son of God. At the same time, yang tianzong extended his hand and a huge Dragon Claw formed, grabbing towards the Son of God.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>From the side, a terrifying demonic blade slashed over, and a combat sword condensed from poisonous gas pierced through the void and collided with the Dragon Claw, blocking it.</p><p>At the same time, two old men appeared in front of yang tianzong.</p><p>They were the two Saint realm elders from the Yu Du sect and the Tian Yu demon sect.</p><p>“This is a matter of the younger generation. Why do you, a Sage, have to interfere? Let them deal with it themselves. If you want to fight, this old man will accompany you!”</p><p>The elder of the Tian Yu demonic sect said coldly.</p><p>The Yu Du sect’s elder didn’t say anything, but his attitude spoke for itself. His entire body was suffused with a highly toxic aura that was constantly rolling about.</p><p>“You two old fogeys, I’ll deal with you first!”</p><p>Yang tianzong’s gaze turned cold and he roared. His roar was like a Dragon’s Roar and dragon scales appeared on his arm. He took a step and charged towards the two elders of the Yu Du sect and the Tian Yu demon sect.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The elders of the Yu Du sect and the Tian Yu demon sect shouted as they charged towards yang tianzong with a terrifying aura.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Five to six consecutive explosions resounded in the sky. Then, everyone saw two figures retreating frantically. Their bodies were trembling, and a claw mark appeared on each of their bodies. They had almost scratched through their bodies, and their bodies were covered with blood.</p><p>He was defeated!</p><p>The two Saint realm elders of the Yu Du sect and the Tian Yu demon sect attacked together, but they were defeated in five or six moves. They were injured by yang tianzong, and their clothes were stained with blood.</p><p>The difference in combat strength was too great.</p><p>“I’ll spare your lives this time. Next time, I’ll kill you!”</p><p>Yang tianzong said coldly, causing the two elders of the Yu Du sect and Tian Yu demon sect to have extremely ugly expressions. However, their eyes were filled with deep fear.</p><p>also, let me correct you. I’m still a few years away from reaching 50, so I’m still a member of the younger generation. As for cultivation, this kid is only a half-Saint, seven or eight years older than my Junior Brother. If he can attack my Junior Brother, why can’t I attack him? ”</p><p>After saying that, yang tianzong turned to look at the Son of God again.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Yang tianzong suddenly took a step forward. In the sky, a giant foot that was exactly the same as yang tianzong appeared and stepped down on the Son of God.</p><p>The Son of God roared and used his Saint weapon to block, but the result was that he was almost trampled flat. He half-knelt on the ground and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Don’t you think you’re very strong? In front of me, you’re still trash.”</p><p>Yang tianzong mocked.</p><p>you’ve only cultivated ten years more than me. If you give me another ten years, no, five years, I’ll definitely be able to trample you under my feet!</p><p>The Son of God roared, his eyes red like blood.</p><p>He was the divine Son, a heavenly talent. Ever since he rose to power, he had been like the moon surrounded by the stars. He had never been humiliated like this.</p><p>He actually half-knelt on the ground in front of everyone.</p><p>At this moment, he was so furious that he wanted to kill yang tianzong and everyone who had witnessed this.</p><p>you’re not qualified to challenge me. If you want to challenge me, you’ll have to defeat my Junior Brother in three years. If you can defeat him, I’ll give you a chance to challenge him!</p><p>Yang tianzong laughed coldly.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The divine Son roared and looked at Lu Ming.”Lu Ming, I accept your challenge. Three years from now, we’ll have a battle at the treasure sealing assembly!”</p><p>“I’ll take your dog life three years later!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>hahaha, how arrogant. But let me tell you, within three years, I’ll definitely break through to the sage realm. At that time, if you want to challenge me, you’ll have to defeat my Junior Brother first and pass the test of the treasure fixing assembly. Only then will you be qualified to challenge me!</p><p>The Son of God said coldly. His eyes were filled with confidence again.</p><p>He firmly believed that he would not lose.</p><p>He had been suppressed by yang tianzong today only because the other party was older than him and had a higher cultivation level than him. He believed that yang tianzong would definitely be killed five years later.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
