The divine Son had been in the half-Saint realm for almost ten years. With his talent, it would not be difficult for him to break through to the Saint realm.</p><p>Once he broke through to the Saint realm, his status would be completely different. He would truly enter the upper echelons of the Azure continent.</p><p>At the same time, he could no longer continue to participate in the treasure fixing assembly.</p><p>If a Saint realm participated in the treasure fixing assembly, other people would have no chance at all.</p><p>In other words, if Lu Ming wanted to challenge the divine Son, he would have to pass the auction.</p><p>If he was killed in the treasure fixing assembly, then the matter of the challenge would be impossible to talk about.</p><p>three years later, Lu Ming will not have any hope!</p><p>Someone shook his head and sighed.</p><p>“That’s right, there’s no hope.”</p><p>The others shook their heads.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current cultivation was only at the fourth level Martial Emperor realm. Three years later, no matter how fast Lu Ming’s progress was, it would be extremely fast if he could reach the eighth or even ninth level Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>However, what was the use of Lv 8 or even Lv 9 martial Royal realm? How could he fight against the Son of God?</p><p>Even if the divine Son remained at the half-Saint realm, Lu Ming would not be a match for him. Once the divine Son broke through to the Saint realm, Lu Ming would not stand a chance.</p><p>It wasn’t impossible to become a battle Saint before breaking through to the Saint realm. There weren’t many people who had been able to do it since ancient times.</p><p>Each and every one of those people was a terrifying monster whose name shook the world.</p><p>“Then I’ll let you live for another three years!”</p><p>The Son of God said coldly. He didn’t say anything else. He turned and left, turning into a beam of holy light and disappearing.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The sage realm elder of the heavenly God sect let out a loud shout and also stepped into the air to leave. The disciples of the heavenly God sect also followed him and left the place.</p><p>After the people from the Tian Shen sect left, the people from the Tian Yu demon sect and Yu Du sect also left.</p><p>Following that, the people from the other sects also left.</p><p>“Lu Ming, if there’s a chance in the future, let’s fight again!”</p><p>From the life and death Sword sect, Luo Xiang stepped in the air and said loudly.</p><p>“Alright, we’ll fight another day!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Farewell!”</p><p>Luo Xiang cupped his fists and left.</p><p>“Thank you for your help, third senior!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming, Tian Chui and Xue ningxin cupped their fists and thanked yang tianzong.</p><p>haha, you and I are brothers, there’s no need to be so polite. I just happened to pass by the Cang mountains this time, so I wanted to take a look. I didn’t expect to encounter such a thing!</p><p>Yang tianzong laughed heartily.</p><p>third senior brother, Little Junior Brother defeated and killed ten heaven’s favorites with upper-class earth spiritual body by himself. He won first place in the treasure auction!</p><p>Xue ningxin said.</p><p>“Oh? Amazing, amazing, Little Junior Brother is really a genius, master has good eyes!”</p><p>Yang tianzong’s eyes lit up.</p><p>He had just arrived and did not know that Lu Ming had actually won first place in the treasure auction.</p><p>“Senior brother is too kind!”</p><p>Then, they chatted as they flew toward the Dragon God Valley.</p><p>Among the people of Dragon God Valley, he Yu and the people from Silver City showed strong unwillingness in their eyes.</p><p>damn it. In such a situation, Lu Ming still managed to escape!</p><p>He Yu’s heart was filled with hatred.</p><p>Soon, they returned to the Dragon God Valley base.</p><p>“Junior Brother, Junior Sister, you’ve just had a big fight, so you should go back to your room and recuperate!”</p><p>Yang tianzong said.</p><p>Tian Chui and Xue ningxin nodded. They had been seriously injured in the previous battle and were still far from recovering.</p><p>Many of the other disciples of Dragon God Valley were also injured. They had all returned to their rooms to recuperate.</p><p>Everyone returned to their rooms. Lu Ming took out a pile of rough stones and devoured them to recover his essential core.</p><p>After half a day, Lu Ming had fully recovered.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming waved his hand and a few storage rings appeared in his hand.</p><p>They were all obtained from killing opponents during the treasure auction.</p><p>Lu Ming started to count.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed after he finished counting.</p><p>This time, he had gained a lot.</p><p>One had to know that the people he had killed were all heaven’s favorites and were extremely wealthy.</p><p>There was no need to mention the raw stones, they added up to a few hundred million.</p><p>There were also dozens of Emperor spiritual weapons.</p><p>There were even six holy weapons.</p><p>In particular, there were three space-breaking flying shuttles.</p><p>The three space-breaking flying shuttles were all found in the storage rings of mo he and Wu Qian Du, the three top heaven’s favorites.</p><p>He had really worn out his iron shoes and searched high and low for it, only to find it in the end. Lu Ming had always wanted to buy a space-breaking flying shuttle. He did not expect to get three at once.</p><p>Lu Ming picked one, erased the mark of the original owner on it, and began to refine it.</p><p>It was very easy to refine the space-breaking flying shuttle. It was refined by Lu Ming in less than a day.</p><p>The space-breaking flying shuttle hovered above Lu Ming’s palm. It grew and shrank according to Lu Ming’s thoughts, changing its shape as he wished.</p><p>After fiddling with it for a while, Lu Ming put the space-breaking flying shuttle away. Then, he took out the flowing essence gloves and started to refine them.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another three days passed.</p><p>In the past few days, the news of what had happened at the treasure auction had quickly spread throughout the Cang mountains and the entire Cang region.</p><p>Lu Ming’s name shook everyone’s hearts.</p><p>In this competition, Lu Ming’s name was the most widely spread.</p><p>He had defeated and killed ten top-notch heaven’s favorites all by himself and won first place.</p><p>In the end, he even challenged the Son of God to a life-and-death battle three years later.</p><p>Although no one was optimistic about Lu Ming’s chances, thinking that he would most likely be killed if he could fight the divine Son in three years, many people remembered one name: Lu Ming!</p><p>Three days later, Lu Ming refined the flowing essence gloves.</p><p>With a single thought, the flowing essence transformed into liquid and wrapped around Lu Ming’s right palm. It was as light as a chiffon. As Lu Ming injected his essential core, the flowing essence glove became heavier.</p><p>In the end, even Lu Ming’s arm started to tremble slightly.</p><p>“So heavy, so heavy. With the addition of the primal Chaos Domain and the prison suppressing heavenly art, how terrifying would this punch be?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with anticipation. He could not wait to find an expert to test it out.</p><p>With a single thought, the flowing essence gloves seemed to come alive. It burrowed into Lu Ming’s skin and disappeared.</p><p>With a thought, it would appear again. It was very convenient to use.</p><p>“It’s time to leave!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>There were still about five days before the start of the treasure sealing Convention. However, Lu Ming planned to leave and return to Dragon God Valley to cultivate in seclusion.</p><p>In any case, he had a preliminary understanding of the battle prowess of the divine Son, Zi Feng, Wang Jian, and the other top ten monstrous geniuses of the Azure region. There was no point in staying here and watching the treasure sealing assembly.</p><p>He might as well make the best use of his time and cultivate.</p><p>To Lu Ming, time was the most important thing.</p><p>Lu Ming stood up and walked outside. He then found Tian Chui.</p><p>“Little Junior Brother, you’re leaving?”</p><p>Tian Chui asked in surprise.</p><p>yes, I came to the treasure sealing assembly to witness the combat power of the top ten geniuses of the Cang Prefecture. Now that I’ve seen it, there’s no point in staying. So, I plan to return to Dragon God Valley First!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
