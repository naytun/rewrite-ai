Next time, I’ll definitely kill you!</p><p>Lu Ming spoke with a cold killing intent. Then, he kicked out. The five or six people from the deity sect and the desire poison sect were sent flying like a ball. They disappeared into the sky and flew for an unknown distance.</p><p>...</p><p>If not for the small village, Lu Ming would have already killed these people.</p><p>At the side, the village chief and Feng Ling were dumbfounded. It was only then that they realized that Lu Ming, who had lived with them for three months, was also an unfathomable expert.</p><p>“Village chief, are you alright?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“It’s nothing serious. Sigh, I’m just afraid that these people will come back!”</p><p>The village chief sighed.</p><p>“If they come again, I’ll kill them one by one!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a sharp glint.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming passed the storage rings that he had obtained from the heavengod sect and the Yu Du sect to the village chief. However, the village chief did not dare to take out the villagers ‘furniture for fear that other experts would see them and bring trouble to himself.</p><p>The village chief even walked into the ancestral hall and put away those memorial tablets.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he sat down on a chair in the village chief’s courtyard and waited quietly.</p><p>……</p><p>There was a small mountain peak outside the sky and wind Plains. A few young men in white robes stood with their hands behind their backs and looked into the distance.</p><p>those guys are getting more and more daring. I told them to go to the small village to inquire about the situation, but they haven’t returned yet!</p><p>One of the young men said coldly.</p><p>“Wait for a while more. If he hasn’t returned, you guys go and check!”</p><p>The young man in the middle seemed to be the leader of the group.</p><p>Soon, a few hours had passed, and a few middle-aged men were flying towards the mountain peak in a hurry.</p><p>These middle-aged men were the people who had gone to the small mountain village just now.</p><p>Although they had all their bones broken by Lu Ming, they were all martial emperors and had extremely strong vitality. They had recovered a little by now and had rushed over.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>The young man in the lead swept his gaze around and discovered that a few of the burly men were injured. A sharp glint flashed through his eyes.</p><p>young master Luo, you have to seek justice for us. We found the Phoenix incense wood in that small village. We wanted to bring it to show our respect to young master Luo, but there was an expert in that small village. Not only did he refuse to give it to us, but he also beat us up. He was so arrogant that he didn’t even put our Tian Shen sect in his eyes!</p><p>The cold and arrogant middle-aged man shouted.</p><p>“Phoenix incense wood? That small village has Phoenix incense wood?”</p><p>The eyes of young master Luo and the other young men lit up.</p><p>“That’s right, there’s indeed Phoenix incense wood, and there’s quite a lot of it!”</p><p>The arrogant middle-aged man said.</p><p>“Hmph, people from a small village actually dare to hit the people of my Tian Shen sect. You’re really looking for death. Let’s go!”</p><p>Young master Luo shouted coldly, and with a few other young men and middle-aged men, he flew towards the small village in an aggressive manner.</p><p>Nearby, the others saw this and revealed curious expressions.</p><p>“The people of the heavenly God sect are so aggressive. What do they want to do? Could it be that someone has offended the Tian Shen sect?”</p><p>look at the direction they’re heading. It seems to be that small village. Interesting, let’s go and take a look!</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>There were quite a few people in the vicinity, and they followed young master Luo and the others towards the small village.</p><p>In the small village, in the village chief’s courtyard, Lu Ming was sitting on a chair, resting with his eyes closed. The village chief and Feng Ling, on the other hand, seemed rather anxious.</p><p>They were afraid of the revenge of the Tian Shen sect.</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming opened his eyes and said coldly, ” “They’re here!”</p><p>The village chief’s face paled.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>From the North, young master Luo and the others stepped on the air and arrived above the village chief’s courtyard. They looked down at Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“You are the one who injured the people of my heavenly God sect?”</p><p>Young master Luo glared at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming replied indifferently.</p><p>“It’s fine if it’s you. Take your own life so that I don’t have to do it!”</p><p>Young master Luo said coldly.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>He sneered and was too lazy to answer young master Luo’s question. Instead, he looked at the middle-aged men behind young master Luo and said, ” “I just said that if you come again, I’ll kill you. It seems that you didn’t take my words seriously!”</p><p>“Hmph, brat, don’t be so arrogant. You’re the one who’s going to die today!”</p><p>The arrogant middle-aged man shouted.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes glowed even more sharply.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>kill! young master Luo said in a cold voice. A cold killing intent burst out from his body. His powerful aura burst out and enveloped the entire village.</p><p>Lu Ming actually dared to ignore him. A lowly ant from a small village actually dared to ignore him.</p><p>He was a heaven’s favorite of the divine sky sect, with a cultivation at the peak of the sixth level of the martial Royal realm.</p><p>The aura of the peak Lv 6 Martial Emperor realm enveloped the entire village. The huge pressure even made some villagers kneel down in fear.</p><p>I’m telling you, I’m not from this village. If you need anything, just look for me. It has nothing to do with the villagers!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“Unrelated? I’m telling you, not only will you die today, but all these lowly ants will die!”</p><p>Young master Luo said coldly.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A huge palm condensed and descended from the sky. It was as if it covered the sky and the sun, enveloping the entire village.</p><p>He wanted to flatten this village with a single palm strike.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was furious. He was completely furious. An extremely cold killing intent burst out.</p><p>He had been tolerating them because he was worried about the villagers. Previously, he had not killed those middle-aged men because he was worried about the villagers.</p><p>But now it seemed that for a sect like the tianshen sect, it was useless to be patient. They could only kill. Kill until the other party was afraid, and then they would naturally retreat.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and a fist force soared into the sky, shattering the huge palm print.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped into the air and charged towards young master Luo and the rest. His powerful aura pressed down on the other party.</p><p>I’ve already given you a chance. You’re the ones who are seeking death!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>peak Lv 6 martial Royal realm? Hmph, no wonder you’re so arrogant. But let me tell you, there’s a world of difference in combat strength between the same level of cultivation!</p><p>Young master Luo said. A spear of divine punishment appeared in his hand. He took a step forward and thrust the spear at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, he was met with Lu Ming’s punch.</p><p>The punch was destructive. When it hit the spear of God punishment, the spear of God punishment was shattered. The terrifying fist force broke young master Luo’s defense and hit his dantian, penetrating it.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Young master Luo’s eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p>He couldn’t understand how an ordinary young man he met in a small village could be so terrifying. He was at the same level as him, but he killed him in one move.</p><p>He was a heaven’s chosen of the tianshen sect.</p><p>“You … How dare you!”</p><p>The other young men and the middle-aged men were so scared that their faces turned pale and they stuttered.</p><p>This dark-skinned young man had killed young master Luo with one punch?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
