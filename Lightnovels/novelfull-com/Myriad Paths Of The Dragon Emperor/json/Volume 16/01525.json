He looked around and said,”I believe that most of you already know the rules of the competition, but I’d like to repeat them again!”</p><p>...</p><p>you are divided into thirteen platforms. Except for the life and death Sword sect, each sect has thirty-six people. The rules of the competition are very simple. First, the deity sect on the first platform will send one person to the fighting stage. He can challenge anyone from any sect. The competition will end when one of them is killed or thrown off the fighting stage. The winner will return to the platform and wait for others to challenge him!</p><p>after the first platform, it’s the second platform’s sect’s turn to send out a challenger. They can also challenge anyone from any sect until one person is defeated. Just like that, it’s the third platform’s turn to send someone to challenge, followed by the fourth platform, all the way to the thirteenth platform. That’s one round!</p><p>at least 13 people will be eliminated in one round. In theory, there will be a total of 36 rounds. Do you understand? ”</p><p>The sage realm elder of the heavenly God sect shouted.</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>Everyone responded.</p><p>remember, you are not allowed to admit defeat during the challenge. You can only fall off the battle stage or be killed for the competition to end. This will continue until the last person from a sect is eliminated. The first three sects to be eliminated will be the last three and will not have the chance to participate in this year’s treasure fixing assembly!</p><p>The Saint realm elder explained again, making many people clench their fists.</p><p>No matter what, they couldn’t become the last three, otherwise, their own sect wouldn’t even have the qualifications to participate in the treasure fixing assembly, how shameful would that be?</p><p>in the end, there will only be one sect left with people. The sect that perseveres to the end will receive a reward. The reward this time is the Royal domain pill, seven royal domain pills!</p><p>As soon as he said that, the scene was in an uproar.</p><p>“What? The reward this time is so generous?”</p><p>it’s actually the Royal domain pill, and there are seven of them. What a great deal!</p><p>Many people exclaimed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were burning with passion.</p><p>As the name suggested, the Royal domain pill was made with the Royal domain fruit as the main ingredient.</p><p>It was said that one royal domain pill required nine royal domain fruits in addition to other precious materials.</p><p>A Royal fruit could help a low-level Royal break through one level of cultivation.</p><p>A royal domain pill could allow a mid-tier or even a high-tier Royal to break through one level of cultivation. How precious was this?</p><p>To mid-rank Emperor level experts like them, it was a Fatal Attraction.</p><p>This was especially so for Lu Ming. It was too difficult for him to improve his Chaos Domain. However, if he had the Royal domain pill, it would greatly reduce the time he needed to break through.</p><p>“The most important thing is that Saint weapons are not allowed in this competition. Anyone who uses a Saint weapon will be killed without mercy. Alright, that’s all for the rules. Let’s begin!”</p><p>The sage realm elder of the heavenly God sect announced. Then, he turned around and returned to a Pavilion.</p><p>alright, since my deity sect is standing on the first platform, then my deity sect will be the first to send out a person to fight. We’ll use the brick to lead the Jade!</p><p>On the first platform, a white-robed young man spoke.</p><p>Obviously, this person was the leader of the heavenly God sect.</p><p>Every sect would arrange a team leader to be in charge of adjusting the tactics at any time.</p><p>The white-robed young man then pointed to a young man and said, ” “You can go up and act according to the plan!”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The young man nodded, and a cold light flashed in his eyes. He took a step forward and appeared on the fighting ring.</p><p>The man looked around and finally fixed his eyes on the tenth platform and the people of Dragon God Valley.</p><p>“You, come down and accept your death!”</p><p>The young man from the tianshen sect pointed at a young man in the LV 4 martial Royal realm from the Dragon God Valley.</p><p>He was indeed challenging Dragon God Valley!</p><p>Everyone’s heart moved.</p><p>Dragon God Valley and tianshen sect had always been at odds with each other. In addition to the incident with Lu Ming and the others, it was inevitable that tianshen sect would target Dragon God Valley.</p><p>“I’m not afraid of you!”</p><p>let’s go! the young man from the Dragon God Valley said. He took a step forward and rushed to the fighting ring. The two of them stood opposite each other.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Almost at the same time, the two of them charged at each other and their palms slammed together.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The young man from the Dragon God Valley was shocked. He retreated and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>not good! The opponent is at the peak of the fifth level martial monarch realm!</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Someone from the Dragon God Valley roared.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The young man from the tianshen sect gained the upper hand in one move. He took a step forward and rushed toward the young man from the Dragon God Valley like a White Lightning. A spear of divine punishment appeared and stabbed toward the young man from the Dragon God Valley at an amazing speed.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>The young man from Dragon God Valley retreated. He had realized that he was no match for the young man. He could only save his life by retreating from the fighting ring.</p><p>“You can’t escape, die!”</p><p>The young man from the heaven God sect had a cold look in his eyes. Holy light burst out from his body, and the speed of the spear of divine punishment suddenly increased.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The spear of divine punishment pierced through the youth’s dantian and nailed him to the fighting ring. Then, the spear flicked the body of the youth from Dragon God Valley off the fighting ring. His storage ring had been taken away by his opponent.</p><p>“You’re really a piece of trash!”</p><p>The young man from the heavenly God sect sneered and returned to the first platform.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Someone from Dragon God Valley growled. Immediately, someone went down and carried the body of the youth from Dragon God Valley away.</p><p>Dragon God Valley, this is just the beginning. Next, you will all die on this fighting stage!</p><p>The leader of the heavenly God sect said coldly.</p><p>“Hmph! Just wait and see!”</p><p>Han Xun’s eyes were cold as he snorted.</p><p>On the first platform, Tian Shen sect’s challenge had ended. Next up was the second platform’s Tian Yu demon sect.</p><p>A young man from the Tianyu demonic sect stepped onto the fighting ring. His cold eyes fell on the disciples of Dragon God Valley.</p><p>“You, get down here!”</p><p>The young man from the Tianyu demonic sect pointed at a Lv 4 Martial Emperor realm young man from Dragon God Valley.</p><p>the Tian Yu demon sect is challenging us too? ”</p><p>it seems that the tianshen sect and the Tianyu demon sect have joined forces to deliberately target our Dragon God Valley!</p><p>this guy’s cultivation is also at the fifth level of the martial Royal realm, but he’s challenging us, who are at the fourth level!</p><p>Someone in the Dragon God Valley said in a serious voice.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The young man from Dragon God Valley jumped onto the fighting ring and stared at his opponent with a serious look.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The young man from the Tianyu demon sect shouted and rushed toward the young man from the Dragon God Valley. The aura of the peak Lv 5 martial Royal realm exploded.</p><p>The young man from Dragon God Valley didn’t dare to take it head-on, so he rushed to the side.</p><p>“You can’t escape, Phantom steps!”</p><p>The young man from the Tian Yu demonic sect appeared in front of the young man from the Dragon God Valley in the next moment. He unsheathed his demonic saber, and demonic Qi filled the air.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The young man from Dragon God Valley let out an angry roar and used all his strength to attack his opponent.</p><p>However, the difference in cultivation was too great. It was an entire level.</p><p>Moreover, it was obvious that the other party had planned this. The young men they sent out were all very powerful.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
