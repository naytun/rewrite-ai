Blood-red light burst forth and shattered the ice, but more ice covered Lu Ming’s body. Gradually, the ice on Lu Ming’s body grew thicker and thicker. In the end, it turned into a huge ice block, sealing Lu Ming inside.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was frozen and he could not move at all. The terrifying cold air seeped into his body and mind, as if it was going to freeze his killing intent.</p><p>...</p><p>Then, the cloud Dragon Valley master waved his hand and a round pearl flew out. It floated above Lu Ming’s head and endless cold air continuously poured in, solidifying the ice.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>Bubbles cried out and flew near the ice block, her face filled with worry and concern.</p><p>alright, I’ll suppress Ming ‘er’s killing intent with my Saint weapon. I’ll take him back to Dragon God Valley and put him in the ten-thousand-year-old ice jade. I’ll use the ice Jade’s cold air to erase Ming’ er’s killing intent. Little guy, come back to Dragon God Valley with me!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said.</p><p>alright! Paopao nodded and landed on the cloud Dragon Valley master’s shoulder.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master waved his hand and kept the ice block that sealed Lu Ming. He took a step forward and left the place.</p><p>Not long after, the valley master of Cloud Dragon Valley returned to Dragon God Valley and placed Lu Ming in the ten-thousand-year ice jade. He used the cold air of the ice jade to erase the cold air on Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Time flew by, and the days went by.</p><p>Not long after, the treasure sealing assembly ended, and the news of the event also spread throughout the Azure region.</p><p>This time, it was still the tianshen sect that suppressed everyone and seized the throne of the first place. The two ancient treasures continued to be kept by the tianshen sect.</p><p>In this time’s treasure auction, the Tian Shen sect had displayed an even more terrifying strength.</p><p>The Divine Child, number one of the ten demon-level geniuses, lived up to his name. He continued to take first place, suppressing all the other demon-level geniuses, and stood at the peak of the Azure region’s younger generation. No one could match him.</p><p>The most shocking thing was that a new heaven’s favorite had appeared in the Tian Shen sect. His strength was terrifying, second only to the deity, and he had obtained the second place in this competition.</p><p>From then on, the top ten geniuses of the Azure continent were reshuffled, and the tianshen sect occupied the first two places. It could be said that their limelight was unparalleled.</p><p>The matter of Lu Ming challenging the divine Son in three years was pushed to the forefront of the news.</p><p>There was news that the divine Son had returned to the Tian Shen sect after the end of the treasure auction and was preparing to enter seclusion to break through to the Saint realm.</p><p>With the deity’s talent and his many years of cultivation in the half-Saint realm, it wouldn’t be too difficult for him to break through to the Saint realm.</p><p>Three years later, what would Lu Ming have to compete with the divine Son who had reached the Saint realm?</p><p>Many people even said that it was impossible for Lu Ming to have a chance to compete with the divine Son. If he participated in the treasure fixing assembly, he would most likely be killed by the demon who was ranked second in the divine God sect.</p><p>In this time’s treasure auction, Dragon God Valley had suffered heavy losses. Many powerful heaven’s favorites were killed by the tianshen sect. Even Zi Feng, one of the top ten monstrous talents, returned with serious injuries.</p><p>In the Azure region, almost every place was talking about what had happened in this year’s treasure sealing assembly. It was only after several months that the storm slowly calmed down.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming did not know about all this.</p><p>Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, half a year passed.</p><p>Lu Ming had been frozen in the ten-thousand-year ice jade for half a year.</p><p>On this day, a cracking sound came from the ten-thousand-year ice jade. Finally, it completely cracked. Lu Ming’s eyes, which had been closed for half a year, opened.</p><p>There was still a faint trace of killing intent in his eyes, but it disappeared in a flash and was concealed by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Where am I?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked around and realized that he was in an underground ice cellar. There were cold ice blocks everywhere.</p><p>His eyes revealed a trace of confusion.</p><p>He only remembered that when he was besieged by evil spirit, he had no choice but to borrow the power of the third bloodline. In the end, he was drowned by the endless killing intent and completely lost his mind.</p><p>Later on, because of a little girl, he regained some of his rationality and rushed into a forest. He could not remember what happened after that.</p><p>What happened after that?</p><p>“Ming ‘er, you’re awake!”</p><p>At this moment, a gentle voice sounded. An old man walked over.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The old man was his master, the cloud Dragon Valley master.</p><p>“Master, did you save me?”</p><p>Lu Ming stood up and bowed to the cloud Dragon Valley master as he asked curiously.</p><p>“Eh? I have left a mark on you and your fellow disciples. Within a certain range, I can sense it. Fortunately, you were not too far from Dragon God Valley, so I sensed it and rushed over immediately. If you were too far away, the consequences would be unimaginable!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said.</p><p>Lu Ming felt a lingering fear. It was true. If the cloud Dragon Valley master had not saved him, he would have been reduced to a killing machine. The final result would have been to be besieged and killed by other experts.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>At that moment, a screech was heard. A white light shot out from the cloud Dragon Valley master’s shoulder and flew into Lu Ming’s arms.</p><p>It was bubbles. At this moment, bubbles was curled up in Lu Ming’s arms. Its furry body rubbed against Lu Ming’s body with all its might.</p><p>“Bubble!”</p><p>Lu Ming stroked bubbles ‘soft fur and felt very sorry. He must have hit bubbles back then.</p><p>“Master, how long have I been asleep?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“It’s been half a year!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said.</p><p>“Half a year!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He did not expect that he would sleep for half a year.</p><p>“Eh? My cultivation!”</p><p>Lu Ming sensed his cultivation and realized that he had a breakthrough.</p><p>He was at the peak of the fifth level Martial Emperor realm back then. Now, he had actually broken through to the early stage of the sixth level Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>He had probably digested a little of the endless energy in the bloodline. The energy in the ten-thousand-year ice jade had also surged into his body, pushing his cultivation to break through in the past half a year.</p><p>my Chaos Domain has also reached level six!</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, what happened to you back then? Why did he completely enter the slaughter status?”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master asked.</p><p>master, on my way back from the Cang mountains, I was ambushed by evil spirit cult …</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming told him everything that had happened in the past.</p><p>evil spirit, it’s actually evil spirit. It seems like evil spirit has really revived. Ming ‘er, perhaps it’s because of your performance in the Cang mountains that evil spirit has set their eyes on you!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master’s eyes turned solemn.</p><p>“I’m being targeted by evil spirit?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>the evil spirit cult specializes in hunting people with the potential to become emperors, or even great emperors. Perhaps they think you have the potential to become an Emperor, so they sent people to kill you!</p><p>Cloud Dragon Valley guessed.</p><p>“Maybe!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. However, he felt that it was not that simple.</p><p>Perhaps it had something to do with the bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele.</p><p>Back then, he had used the bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele to destroy elder mo Hun’s physical body. Elder mo hun might not have died.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, so you’re saying that the reason you entered that slaughter status was entirely because of your bloodline?”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said.</p><p>“Yes, I am!” Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“I’ve never heard of such a bloodline! There’s actually such a strange bloodline in this world. Ming ‘er, in the future, try not to use this bloodline as much as possible. In fact, you might even not use it!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
