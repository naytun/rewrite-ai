There were still three more people behind. Would Lu Ming continue to create miracles?</p><p>Could these people witness the birth of a miracle?</p><p>...</p><p>After the beauty of the Linglong Palace, it was the turn of the strongest heaven’s favorite of the life and death Sword sect.</p><p>It was a cold-faced young man dressed in a black robe. Just by standing there casually, it was as if wisps of sword Qi were bursting forth from him.</p><p>He took a step forward and landed in front of Lu Ming. A powerful sword Qi whizzed out and filled the fighting ring.</p><p>“Make your move!”</p><p>The Paragon of the life-and-death Sword sect spoke indifferently. He was not like the others who had agreed with Lu Ming that there would be no life-and-death battles, only sparring.</p><p>For the life-and-death Sword sect, there was no such thing.</p><p>Their swords were too dangerous. Once they struck, life and death would be decided.</p><p>Lu Ming did not dare to be careless in the face of the life-and-death Sword sect’s prodigy.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A chaos sky-turning stamp appeared in Lu Ming’s hand and he threw it at his opponent.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The combat sword was unsheathed, and a terrifying sword light cut through the void and slashed toward the chaos sky-turning seal.</p><p>The dazzling sword radiance slashed at the chaos sky-turning seal, producing an ear-piercing sound.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In the end, in the end, the terrifying sword light and the primal Chaos sky-turning seal collapsed at the same time and dissipated into the air.</p><p>Lu Ming and the Paragon of the life-and-death Sword sect did not move.</p><p>he blocked it! The heaven’s favorite of the life-and-death Sword sect blocked Lu Ming’s attack!</p><p>so terrifying. The life-and-death Sword sect is indeed the life-and-death Sword sect. Such terrifying combat strength. He can actually withstand Lu Ming’s attack head-on!</p><p>terrifying! The others are no match for them at all! They’re not their match!</p><p>I just don’t know how many more of those attacks Lu Ming can release. This time, it’s going to be interesting!</p><p>The fact that the heaven’s favorite of the life-and-death Sword sect was able to block Lu Ming’s attack caused a lot of discussion. At the same time, many people were in high spirits, guessing who would win.</p><p>Lu Ming was at a disadvantage because he had already fought a few people in front of him. That kind of terrifying attack had already erupted seven times.</p><p>Could Lu Ming’s essential core withstand it?</p><p>On the platform, the only remaining Paragon from the demon Castle and another Paragon from the heaven seat had grave expressions.</p><p>The Paragon of the life-and-death Sword sect and Lu Ming were too powerful. With these two people around, they had no hope of making it to the end.</p><p>“I hope that both of them will be heavily injured!”</p><p>The heaven’s favorite from the heaven seat King thought to himself.</p><p>Not only him, but the young man from the demon Castle also thought so.</p><p>If Lu Ming and the youth from the life-and-death Sword sect were both injured, they would have a chance.</p><p>On the fighting ring, Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>The other party was actually able to block his chaos sky-turning seal unscathed. His combat strength was truly terrifying.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>The eyes of the heaven’s favorite of the life-and-death Sword sect were filled with a strong desire to fight. He swung his combat sword and another terrifying sword light was aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming condensed the chaos sky-turning stamp again and clashed with his opponent.</p><p>This time, it was still a draw.</p><p>what a powerful sword technique. I can only increase the power of the chaos sky-turning seal!</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea.</p><p>He formed a seal with his hands, and another chaos sky-turning seal was formed.</p><p>However, the power of the chaos sky-turning seal was 70% of Lu Ming’s full power.</p><p>A terrifying pressure spread out, and everyone was shocked.</p><p>“How is that possible? Lu Ming’s attack seems to be stronger!”</p><p>this is unbelievable. He didn’t use his full strength just now? ”</p><p>The scene was in an uproar, and everyone was shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming had used such a terrifying move but he had not used his full strength. At this moment, he had increased the power.</p><p>What was Lu Ming’s limit?</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Seventy percent of the power of the primal Chaos sky-turning seal was blasted toward the heaven’s favorite of the life-and-death Sword sect.</p><p>“A thought of life and death!”</p><p>The heaven’s favorite of the life-and-death Sword sect uttered a cold voice. Then, sword light burst forth. He and his sword became one. A terrifying sword light slashed toward the primal Chaos sky-turning seal.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>An earth-shattering boom was heard.</p><p>The sword light and the chaos sky-turning stamp disappeared. A figure retreated to the edge of the fighting ring before he could stand still. It was the heaven’s favorite of the life and death Sword sect.</p><p>At this moment, the heaven’s favorite of the life-and-death Sword sect had blood flowing out of the corner of his mouth.</p><p>“I’ve lost!”</p><p>After a moment of silence, the heaven’s favorite of the life and death Sword sect spoke. He took a step forward and rushed down the stage, landing in the stands.</p><p>Hu …</p><p>Secretly, Lu Ming heaved a long sigh of relief, secretly thinking that he was lucky.</p><p>The heaven’s favorite of the life-and-death Sword sect was not severely injured. If he continued to fight, he would be in trouble.</p><p>That was because his true essence was really running out.</p><p>He had used the chaos sky-turning stamp so many times in a row. Although he had not used his full strength, the consumption of his real essence was also amazing. After so many times, his real essence had been seriously consumed and was about to reach the bottom.</p><p>With the defeat of the life and death Sword sect’s heaven’s favorite, only two people remained on the platform.</p><p>Next, it was the turn of the young man from the demon Castle.</p><p>do you want to continue challenging me? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze shifted to the youth from the demon fortress.</p><p>The young man’s expression turned ugly, but at this point, he had no choice but to fight.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The young man from the demon Castle landed on the fighting ring, causing it to rumble.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I don’t believe that your essential core is endless!”</p><p>The young man from the demon Castle let out an explosive roar as his body expanded rapidly, turning into a giant ape that was dozens of meters tall.</p><p>The ancient divine ape was a terrifying divine beast.</p><p>Without a doubt, the true form of the young man from Demon Castle was an ancient divine ape. Moreover, it was a pure-blooded ancient divine ape, a true divine beast.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The ancient divine ape let out a roar. A huge metal rod appeared in its hand and it swung it at Lu Ming.</p><p>Wind elemental technique!</p><p>This time, Lu Ming did not use the chaos sky-turning stamp. Instead, he used the wind element technique. With a sway of his body, he dodged the ancient divine ape’s attack.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>Many people were stunned. Why did Lu Ming stop attacking? although this ancient divine ape was powerful, it was at most on the same level as mo he. It was not even as powerful as the heaven’s favorite of the life-and-death Sword sect. Why didn’t lu Ming defeat it directly?</p><p>The next moment, they all knew the answer.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and a pile of raw gemstones appeared. The devouring power burst out from Lu Ming’s palm and began to devour the raw gemstones.</p><p>he’s absorbing raw gemstones to recover!</p><p>“His true Qi can’t continue, it’s exhausted!”</p><p>Many people shouted.</p><p>The eyes of the people from the heaven seat King and the demon Castle lit up.</p><p>Had Lu Ming’s essential core finally been exhausted?</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The ancient giant ape was even more excited. The metal rod in its hand smashed towards Lu Ming like a storm.</p><p>If he did not take this opportunity to defeat Lu Ming, he would really have no more chances.</p><p>Lu Ming cast the wind element technique and his body flashed to avoid the ancient divine ape’s attack. At the same time, he devoured the origin Energy of the origin stone and refined it at an extreme speed.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The shadows of the cudgel hit the fighting ring one after another, and the fighting ring kept roaring.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flickered and shuttled through the many staff shadows, avoiding them one after another.</p><p>the ancient giant ape is not good at speed. Damn it!</p><p>The youth at the end of the heaven seat King roared in his heart.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
