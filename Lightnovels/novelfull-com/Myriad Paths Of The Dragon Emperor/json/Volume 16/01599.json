She wrapped Lu Ming in the space-time domain. Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he dodged the noble young man’s attack.</p><p>At this moment, the distinguished young man scanned the storage ring that Lu Ming threw to him with his spiritual sense and found that it was empty. He knew that Lu Ming had fooled him.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>A light spot lit up in the palm of the noble young man. A combat sword flew out and slashed at Lu Ming. The power of the sword was extremely terrifying. Facing this sword, Lu Ming only had one thought, and that was that he could not be defeated!</p><p>This noble young man was definitely a half-Saint, and an extremely terrifying one at that.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The black wings appeared and flashed rapidly. Lu Ming rushed to the right with a swish, avoiding the sword light of the noble youth.</p><p>“You can’t escape!”</p><p>The noble young man’s eyes were as cold as a knife.</p><p>Lu Ming, a mere seventh level Martial Emperor, had dared to trick him and even killed a member of the WAN family in front of him. In his heart, he had already sentenced Lu Ming to death.</p><p>His body seemed to have turned into a divine weapon as he chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the pagoda above Lu Ming’s head emitted a mysterious fluctuation and a space-time Tunnel was formed.</p><p>This spacetime tunnel did not lead to the front, but to the back where another purple-robed youth was.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step in and appeared not far away from another young man in purple.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted. The divine sword technique burst out and rushed into the other party’s soul.</p><p>The other party screamed in pain. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Lu Ming rushed over and killed the purple-robed young man with a punch. He then seized the other party’s storage ring.</p><p>Since there was already enmity between them, Lu Ming would not show any mercy.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming had killed another purple-shirted young man, the distinguished young man was furious and his killing intent was extremely strong.</p><p>All of a sudden, eight light spots lit up on his body. Eight weapons flew out from the eight light spots, and the terrifying battle weapon Qi wreaked havoc in the air.</p><p>Holy weapons, all of them were holy weapons.</p><p>In addition to the sword, all nine weapons were holy weapons.</p><p>The fusion of the nine holy weapons ‘battle weapon Qis was unimaginably powerful. Lu Ming’s body was covered in cold air as he felt a fatal threat.</p><p>“Bubble, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s Black wings flickered as he retreated frantically.</p><p>Then, bubbles made a move and a space-time Tunnel was formed. Lu Ming rushed in directly.</p><p>“Stay here and kill!”</p><p>The noble youth roared as he slashed his sword, causing terrifying ripples to appear in the air.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The terrifying sword radiance slashed at the spacetime tunnel, destroying the spacetime and everything. The spacetime tunnel trembled violently and then collapsed.</p><p>Lu Ming was blasted out of the space-time Tunnel just as he was halfway through the journey.</p><p>what terrifying battle-power! He can even destroy the spacetime tunnel! Let’s go!</p><p>Lu Ming cast the wind elemental art. Energy kept flowing into the air-frozen bead. His black wings flapped wildly. Lu Ming turned into a stream of light and flew forward at top speed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Behind him, his Saint weapon trembled. The noble youth turned into a sword light, chasing after Lu Ming at an extreme speed. He was so fast that he surpassed Lu Ming’s speed, and the distance between the two of them was rapidly closing.</p><p>what an amazing speed. I’ll take you to a place then!</p><p>There was a cold glint in Lu Ming’s eyes. He slowly changed his direction and flew towards a mountain.</p><p>The young man chased after him and in the blink of an eye, he had crossed a long distance.</p><p>The distance between Lu Ming and the distinguished young man was getting closer and closer.</p><p>“You will die today!”</p><p>The noble youth’s cold voice came from behind.</p><p>“You sound very confident, but how did I kill your two subordinates?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mocking voice was heard, causing the noble youth’s killing intent to grow even stronger.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>A terrifying roar came from the front, and demonic Qi soared into the sky.</p><p>“We’re here!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>When he had been hunting demonic creatures, he had passed by this place and found that there were terrible demonic creatures gathering here. He had seen a few of them at random, and they were all at the half-Saint level, so he had bypassed them.</p><p>Now, he could use these demonic creatures to stop the noble young man.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming flew straight towards the source of the roar. In the next moment, a huge Valley appeared before his eyes.</p><p>In the valley, many terrifying demonic creatures were wandering around, roaring from time to time. Their power was shocking, and there was a faint Saint might permeating the air.</p><p>At a glance, there were at least a dozen demons, all of which were at the half-Saint level.</p><p>Lu Ming dashed into the valley without any hesitation.</p><p>Roar! Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>At once, the demonic creatures went berserk. Demonic Qi surged and they roared like thunder as they charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A demonic creature that looked like a giant wolf smacked Lu Ming with its claws. Lu Ming’s body shattered like glass.</p><p>It was a shadow, but Lu Ming’s body had already appeared on the other side.</p><p>The bubble wrapped Lu Ming in the space-time domain. Lu Ming’s body flashed rapidly as if he was shuttling through space-time. He avoided the attacks of the half-Saint demons and continued to venture deeper into the valley.</p><p>“You think you can stop me with these demons? Ridiculous, kill!”</p><p>The noble young man’s cold voice sounded and he also rushed into the valley.</p><p>His nine Saint weapons circled around him, and a terrible Qi of battle weapons gathered. A sword light cut through, and a half-Saint demonic creature’s body was directly blown apart, turning into a rolling mass of demonic Qi.</p><p>Then, the noble young man punched with his other hand.</p><p>The Honorable young man’s fist seemed to have turned into a divine weapon that could break anything.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A half-Saint demonic creature was smashed by a punch. He reached out and grabbed a demonic evil crystal.</p><p>“What powerful strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>The noble young man’s strength was beyond his imagination. They were all half-Saints, but the demons were killed by the noble young man in one move.</p><p>The noble young man’s every move contained the power of the laws. It was obvious that he had already comprehended the laws.</p><p>There were strong and weak half-Saints.</p><p>Half-Saints were divided into three stages according to their realms.</p><p>In the first stage, one would comprehend the ultimate domain and become a half-Saint.</p><p>The domain above the ninth level was the ultimate domain. As long as one comprehended the ultimate domain, they would be a half-Saint.</p><p>The second stage was to comprehend the power of the laws.</p><p>After comprehending the laws, he was much more powerful than a half-Saint in the first stage.</p><p>As for the third stage, it was the body of the laws.</p><p>He was only half a step away from the Saint realm.</p><p>As long as he condensed his Saint heart and transformed his true essence into Saint power, he would be in the Saint realm.</p><p>When the law was used, the power of the Spirit body would reach a terrifying level, far beyond the second stage.</p><p>The noble young man should be in the second stage of half-Saint.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>One by one, the half-Saint demons were crushed by the noble young man. They turned into demonic Qi and then condensed again.</p><p>He did not linger in the battle. He dashed past and charged toward Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
