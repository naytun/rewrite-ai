He actually stole someone else’s tablet? You are indeed a disciple of the tianshen sect. It’s so embarrassing. Such a sect can actually be as famous as my Dragon God Valley. I spit!”</p><p>...</p><p>A deep voice resounded. It was Tian Chui.</p><p>Since the last treasure auction, the relationship between Dragon God Valley and tianshen sect had worsened. Now that he had the opportunity, Tian Chui naturally wanted to ridicule them.</p><p>nonsense! Brat, you dare to slander my Tian Shen sect. Today, I will make you beg for death!</p><p>The burly man at the peak of the seventh level Martial Emperor realm roared and stepped forward. He clawed with his hand and a huge khaki hand formed in the sky, grabbing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>A small knife appeared in Lu Ming’s hand. It was the knife he used to carve the statue.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming threw the knife.</p><p>The small knife seemed to have turned into a bolt of lightning, piercing through the big yellow hand and then continued to rush towards the big man.</p><p>The big man’s face changed. A giant axe appeared in his hand and he chopped at the small knife.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The huge axe hit the small knife and the knife was sent flying. It returned to Lu Ming’s hand. The burly man’s body shook violently and he took five to six steps back. He spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Many onlookers ‘expressions changed drastically as they looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>They could clearly see that the small knife that Lu Ming had thrown out was definitely an ordinary small knife, an extremely ordinary spirit weapon. However, such a small knife that was casually thrown out had actually forced a seventh level peak Martial Emperor back and made him spit out blood.</p><p>This kind of power was too terrifying.</p><p>They did not know that Lu Ming’s attack was covered by a level six Chaos Domain. It was as heavy as a mountain. How difficult would it be to injure an ordinary seventh level Martial Emperor?</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Yu Sheng said with a serious expression.</p><p>He didn’t believe that a small village on the border would have such an expert.</p><p>“He’s just a Carpenter from a small village!”</p><p>Lu Ming replied indifferently.</p><p>Everyone looked at each other. A Carpenter? It was actually so powerful?</p><p>Hmph, you’re just pretending. Let’s see how long you can keep up this act. Kill!</p><p>An elder stepped out with a spear of divine punishment in his hand and stabbed it at Lu Ming.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The other expert made his move as well. A terrifying sword light was aimed at Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>The two of them were both at the LV 8 martial Royal realm. They were working together to kill Lu Ming in one move.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. He took a heavy step and soared into the sky, avoiding the sword light and throwing a punch.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>&Nbsp; the spear of God punishment from the old man shattered, but the fist energy didn’t stop and continued to bombard the old man. The old man screamed as his body was torn apart.</p><p>A Lv 8 martial Royal realm expert was killed by Lu Ming in one move.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming flipped his hand and threw the knife in his hand at another person who attacked.</p><p>The man was shocked and tried to block the attack with his sword. However, the powerful force on the knife numbed his arm. At this moment, Lu Ming was already charging at him.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a single punch, heaven and earth trembled. The man’s body was directly penetrated, and his body flew a few thousand meters away. He fell heavily on the ground, and no longer had any breath.</p><p>Many people gasped at the sight of him killing two Lv 8 martial Royal realm experts in an instant.</p><p>he’s so powerful. His cultivation is only at the peak of the sixth level martial Royal realm, but he has such powerful combat strength. He killed two Lv 8 martial Royal realm experts in an instant. He’s comparable to a top heaven’s favorite!</p><p>could this person be a top-notch heaven’s favorite? ”</p><p>The people in the surroundings were discussing and speculating.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Yu Sheng’s eyes were extremely cold. He stepped out, and holy light filled the air. A terrible pressure pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>Many people thought that Yu Sheng was going to make a move.</p><p>Yu Sheng was a heaven’s favorite with a superior-grade earth spiritual body. His combat strength was terrifying. Although he was also at Lv 8 martial Royal realm, his combat strength was many times stronger than the previous two.</p><p>Yu Sheng would probably be able to kill the two of them in one move.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Yu Sheng shouted coldly. He also condensed a spear of divine punishment in his hand and stabbed it at Lu Ming.</p><p>The spear of divine punishment was incomparably sharp and powerful. It was far from what that person had been able to compare with.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s method of fighting was still very simple. He simply threw a punch.</p><p>A terrifying vibration was heard. The spear of God’s punishment in Yu Sheng’s hand was shaking violently as if it would collapse at any moment.</p><p>The terrifying power continued to rush toward Yu Sheng, causing his expression to change.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming’s other hand also punched out.</p><p>Yu Sheng’s expression changed. He struck out with his other palm and collided with Lu Ming’s fist. There was another loud boom. Yu Sheng’s face turned pale and he retreated quickly.</p><p>In a head-on confrontation, he was actually suppressed by Lu Ming.</p><p>A year and a half ago, Lu Ming was able to kill a genius like Yu Sheng even though his cultivation was two levels lower than Yu Sheng’s. Now, Lu Ming’s cultivation was at the peak of the sixth level Martial Emperor realm, while Yu Sheng was at the early stage of the eighth level Martial Emperor realm. The difference was less than two levels.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted as his fists flew towards Yu Sheng.</p><p>Yu Sheng let out a long roar and burst out with holy light. He used all his strength to fight Lu Ming.</p><p>The two of them exchanged more than a dozen moves, and Yu Sheng was forced to retreat.</p><p>“Let’s attack together!”</p><p>“Let’s join forces and kill this person!”</p><p>The rest of the people from the heavenly God sect shouted and rushed forward to surround Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long roar. A Dragon’s Roar sounded from within his body. With a loud shout, the divine sword technique burst out.</p><p>The people who were charging at Lu Ming screamed in pain as if their souls were being torn apart.</p><p>The Black Dragon Spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hand. With a shake of the spear, rays of spear radiance shot out like lightning.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>More than ten powerhouses of the tianshen sect were killed by Lu Ming in an instant.</p><p>“Lu Ming, he’s Lu Ming!”</p><p>Yu Sheng’s eyes widened as he roared.</p><p>“What? he’s Lu Ming? kill him!”</p><p>“Use your Saint weapon!”</p><p>The remaining people of the heavenly God sect shouted.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>A few of them exuded a powerful aura, and a few Saint weapons appeared, shining with terrifying light.</p><p>it’s actually Lu Ming. Kill him!</p><p>Not far away, some of the Yu Du sect’s powerhouses had also taken out their holy weapons and were charging at Lu Ming.</p><p>&Nbsp; at this moment, the nearby spectators were stunned.</p><p>Lu Ming?</p><p>This person was Lu Ming? The Lu Ming whose name had spread throughout the Azure region a year and a half ago, the Lu Ming who wanted to challenge the divine Son in the next treasure fixing assembly?</p><p>He was actually hiding here, in a small mountain village on the border.</p><p>it’s junior Brother Lu Ming. Attack!</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Tian Chui and Xue ningxin were stunned for a moment before they roared and charged forward. Their Saint weapons also flew out from their hands.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>A few experts of the heavenly God sect were directly killed.</p><p>Tian Chui and Xue ningxin’s cultivation had also progressed very quickly. They had both stepped into the LV 8 martial Royal realm, which was the early stage of the LV 8, just like Yu Sheng.</p><p>With their cultivation, how powerful would they be when they controlled holy weapons?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
