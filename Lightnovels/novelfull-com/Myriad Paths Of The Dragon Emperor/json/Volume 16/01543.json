Who would not want it?</p><p>However, if he wanted to get the Royal domain pill, he would have to defeat the others.</p><p>...</p><p>Among the eight people present, Lu Ming was undoubtedly a huge mountain that everyone had to cross if they wanted to get first place.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had already displayed his terrifying combat strength and could kill a top-tier powerhouse. The other seven people were all afraid of him.</p><p>No one had the confidence to fight Lu Ming alone. There was a high possibility that they would lose.</p><p>Therefore, they were extremely cautious when they challenged him now.</p><p>“Heaven seat King, it’s your turn. Hurry up and challenge them!”</p><p>The remaining paragons of the demon Castle spoke.</p><p>“What’s the hurry?”</p><p>One of the heaven seat King’s people coldly said.</p><p>“Everyone, you all want to get first place, right?”</p><p>A young man in purple-gold armor from the heaven seat King spoke.</p><p>“That’s nonsense!”</p><p>The genius from the demon Castle said.</p><p>that’s only natural. Who here doesn’t want to get first place? that’s seven royal domain pills. Not only that, but it’ll also make your name known throughout the Azure continent!</p><p>The jiuxiao sword sect leader said.</p><p>The others nodded in agreement.</p><p>that’s right. We all want to be number one. But to be honest, with Lu Ming around, none of us can even dream of being number one!</p><p>The violet-gold-armored youth from the heaven seat King spoke.</p><p>The others were silent. It was clear that they had tacitly agreed.</p><p>“Then what do you want to do?”</p><p>The Paragon of the demon Castle asked.</p><p>let’s join forces and take turns to defeat Lu Ming first. Then, we’ll decide the winner!</p><p>The purple gold armored youth from the heaven seat King said.</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at the two people from the heaven seat King indifferently. He was not too surprised.</p><p>With the battle prowess he had displayed earlier, he had long expected that he would definitely suffer a tag-team battle from the other sects in the end.</p><p>Just like what the purple-golden-armored youth had said, if they didn’t defeat him, no one else would be able to get first place.</p><p>However, would it be that easy to defeat him?</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into an inexplicable smile.</p><p>“I don’t agree. There are two people in the heaven seat King. It’s advantageous to you if you take turns to fight!”</p><p>On the fourth platform, the evil moon sect’s heaven’s pride expert sneered.</p><p>“Xie Sha, this is the only way. If we don’t do this, I’ll challenge you now. Are you sure you can win? Even if you defeat me, how much combat power will you have left? Even if I don’t challenge you now, you’ll still challenge someone else later. Who do you think you can challenge?”</p><p>The purple gold armored youth from the heaven seat King asked a few questions, causing the others to fall silent once more.</p><p>That was indeed the case. Every battle that followed would be a battle of the pinnacle. No one had the confidence that they would not be injured after defeating their opponent. If that happened, wouldn’t it be advantageous for those who came after them?</p><p>In the end, no one was Lu Ming’s match.</p><p>They had no other choice.</p><p>“I agree!”</p><p>The paragons of the demon Fort were the first to agree.</p><p>He was in the best position. He would take turns to fight Lu Ming. After all, he was the last one to fight. After so many rounds, Lu Ming would most likely be defeated. He could still conserve his strength at the back.</p><p>“I also agree!”</p><p>The sovereign of the Linglong Palace also spoke. The Linglong Palace’s seat was also relatively at the back.</p><p>In the end, jiuxiao sword sect nodded in agreement.</p><p>In the end, only Xie Sha of the evil moon sect was left with an unsightly expression.</p><p>His position was merely behind the heaven seat King. After the heaven seat King’s challenge, it would be his turn.</p><p>I will be the first one to challenge!</p><p>The purple gold armored youth from the heaven seat King said.</p><p>“Alright, I agree!”</p><p>In the end, Xie Sha also nodded in agreement.</p><p>At this point, he had no other choice.</p><p>Fortunately, the youth in purple gold armor was the first to challenge Lu Ming. He should be able to deplete some of Lu Ming’s combat strength. He might have a chance if he went up.</p><p>After Xie Sha agreed, the young man in purple gold armor from the heaven seat King stepped onto the fighting ring. He looked at Lu Ming and said,”Lu Ming, how about you fight me?”</p><p>“As you wish!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and landed on the fighting ring.</p><p>The youth in purple gold armor looked serious and said, ” “Lu Ming, let’s spar and not kill each other. What do you think?” he asked.</p><p>“Sure!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>He had already offended the tianshen sect, the Tianyu demonic sect, and the Yu Du sect. He did not want to offend any more sects.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming had agreed, the young man in purple gold armor heaved a sigh of relief. To be honest, he was not afraid of Lu Ming.</p><p>After all, he was the one who suggested a tag-team battle with Lu Ming. He was really afraid that Lu Ming would kill him in a fit of anger. He was not fully confident that he would be able to charge off the fighting ring successfully.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>The young man in purple-gold armor glowed with purple-gold light, and even his skin turned purple-gold, like a Heavenly King.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The young man in purple-gold armor stepped onto the fighting ring, causing it to rumble. He charged at Lu Ming like a giant beast and threw a punch. The air rumbled as his purple-gold fist landed on Lu Ming. It was extremely powerful.</p><p>Without a doubt, this was a heaven’s pride expert on the same level as han Xun and Mo he. If it was a normal battle, even Lu Ming would have to put in some effort.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had no intention of fighting a normal battle with the other party.</p><p>Lu Ming’s hands moved rapidly, like a Phantom.</p><p>A huge chaos sky-turning seal appeared in Lu Ming’s hand.</p><p>This chaos sky-turning seal was not at its full power. Just like the battle with mo he, it was only at 50% of its power.</p><p>50% of the power was enough!</p><p>Lu Ming held the chaos sky-turning seal and threw it at the youth in purple gold armor.</p><p>The young man in purple gold armor had a drastic change of expression. Lu Ming had used this move in his previous battle with mo he. He had witnessed the terrifying power.</p><p>“Heavenly King supporting the pagoda!”</p><p>The young man in purple-gold armor roared, and his purple-gold body swelled up. He became a lot taller and bigger. The purple-gold light on his body brightened, and he struck out his palms toward the chaos sky-turning seal.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The palms of the youth in purple-gold armor struck the chaos sky-turning seal. His burly figure shook violently, and the purple-gold light around his body swayed and exploded continuously.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The young man in purple-gold armor couldn’t even stand straight. His bones creaked as he knelt down and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming began to condense the chaos sky-turning seal again.</p><p>“Wait, I’m not fighting anymore!”</p><p>The young man in purple gold armor shouted. Then, he rushed to one side of the fighting stage and rushed down the fighting stage. He then flew to the grandstand behind the heaven seat and began to heal his injuries.</p><p>Lu Ming did not chase after him. This would save his essential core.</p><p>The half-condensed chaos sky-turning seal dissipated.</p><p>The other people at the scene also looked at each other.</p><p>The young man in purple gold armor was defeated by Lu Ming in one move and he rushed down the fighting ring.</p><p>Was the difference in combat strength that great?</p><p>the difference is not that big. Lu Ming’s move should be his strongest move with shocking power. However, such a move usually consumes a terrifying amount of essential core!</p><p>that’s right. I believe that Lu Ming can only use a few of such unique moves!</p><p>In the stands, some people were discussing and guessing that Lu Ming should be using his strongest move.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
