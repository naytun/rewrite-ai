They could directly penetrate through.</p><p>Back then, when they were facing the evil spirit cult’s elder mo hun, Lu Ming’s Chaos Domain and bubbles ‘space-time domain could only weaken a portion of the attack. They could not completely defend against it.</p><p>...</p><p>It was obvious that ordinary defense was useless.</p><p>However, soul attacks also had their weaknesses. If a living being was in front of them, the soul attack would not be able to pass through.</p><p>For example, Wu Qian Du used his poisonous insects to block in front of him.</p><p>Although the poisonous insects were small, they still had a spirit and a soul.</p><p>The soul attack would attack the venomous insects, and Wu Qian Du, who was behind the venomous insects, was naturally safe and sound.</p><p>Since he dared to challenge Lu Ming, he naturally had a foolproof plan.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s expression remained calm.</p><p>If the soul attack technique was useless, could Lu Ming not do anything to Wu Qian Du?</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming covered his entire body with the chaos Domain and soared into the sky.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming looked down from above and continued to bombard with his fists.</p><p>Terrifying fist forces shot towards Wu qiandu, the poisonous insects, and the snakes like meteors.</p><p>A large number of poisonous insects and toads were killed.</p><p>On the fighting ring, there were dead insects, toads, and Vipers everywhere. Pools of venom filled the fighting ring, giving off a disgusting smell.</p><p>Wisps of poisonous gas filled the fighting ring.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, thank you for your cooperation. The poison gas formation has been set up. You can die now!”</p><p>In the fighting ring, Wu Qian Du revealed a cold smile.</p><p>A cloud of green poisonous gas gushed out from his body and merged with the poisonous gas on the fighting ring. The entire fighting ring was shrouded in the poisonous gas.</p><p>“Thousand poisonous hands!”</p><p>Wu Qian Du said coldly. The poisonous gas rolled and turned into poisonous palms, blasting toward Lu Ming in the sky.</p><p>Lu Ming cast the wind elemental technique and dodged the poisonous palms.</p><p>“Since that’s the case, I’ll kill you first!”</p><p>An Emperor spiritual weapon spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hand. He became one with the spear and swooped down, charging into the poison gas formation and killing Wu qiandu.</p><p>“You can’t kill me!”</p><p>Wu qiandu sneered. With a bang, his body exploded and turned into clouds of poisonous gas, which then merged with the poisonous gas of the formation.</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear swept across and the poisonous gas rolled around.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and an invisible soul attack burst out.</p><p>However, there were countless poisonous insects flying in the poisonous gas. Lu Ming shouted and a group of poisonous insects fell.</p><p>“Hehe, Lu Ming, you can’t hurt me at all. You can only let me kill you!”</p><p>Wu Qian DU’s smug voice rang out.</p><p>The poison gas formation rolled and surged towards Lu Ming continuously. The terrifying poison gas enveloped Lu Ming as if it was going to corrode the chaos realm and turn Lu Ming into ashes.</p><p>Moreover, the poisonous gas would condense into attacks that were aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>The long spear vibrated and destroyed the attacks one by one.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you can rush down the Coliseum yourself. Otherwise, I’ll kill you!”</p><p>Wu Qian DU’s cold voice sounded.</p><p>“You think too highly of yourself!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>If he wanted to kill Wu qiandu, Lu Ming could do it now. As long as he cast the chaos sky-turning seal, the terrifying power of the chaos sky-turning seal would directly cover the entire fighting ring. He could easily destroy this large array and even kill Wu qiandu.</p><p>But now was not the time to use the chaos sky-turning seal.</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to keep the chaos Empyrean seal to deal with the leader of the divine realm sect or mo he.</p><p>He would not use the chaos sky-turning seal for the time being, so he could only use other methods.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s Chaos Domain suddenly spread out, enveloping the entire fighting ring.</p><p>Then, endless thunder and lightning appeared and filled the fighting ring, followed by flames.</p><p>The entire fighting ring was enveloped by the power of Thunder and fire.</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>The poisonous insects were burned to death one by one.</p><p>“Kill! Kill!”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming kept shouting and casting the divine sword technique. It formed invisible waves that rushed in all directions. A large number of poisonous insects were killed and turned into ashes in the Thunder and fire.</p><p>“I don’t believe that your soul force can keep on exploding!”</p><p>Wu Qian DU’s voice sounded.</p><p>A person’s soul power is limited. Using it continuously will consume a lot of soul power.</p><p>However, after a while, Wu Qian Du started to get nervous. Lu Ming did not stop. His soul attacks continued to erupt, and the poisonous insects were almost all killed.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming bellowed. The poisonous gas rolled and Wu qiandu’s agonized cries rang out.</p><p>A cloud of mist gathered and rolled, as if it was about to condense into a human figure.</p><p>“Devour!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and pressed his left palm in the air. The devouring power burst forth and enveloped the cloud of poisonous gas. Wisps of poisonous gas were devoured and began to be refined by Lu Ming.</p><p>The poisonous gas was very terrifying. However, Lu Ming’s spirit body had reached the superior-grade Earth Spirit body. Moreover, his spirit body contained traces of chaotic Qi, which was stronger than ordinary superior-grade Earth Spirit bodies. He was not afraid of the poisonous gas.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A faint Dragon’s Roar could be heard coming from Lu Ming’s body. The poisonous gas that Wu qiandu had turned into was being refined continuously.</p><p>“Ah, ah, how could this be? My spirit body is invincible. How did you refine it?”</p><p>Within the poisonous gas, Wu Qian DU’s terrified cry rang out as he desperately resisted.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted. Two beams of sword light shot out of his eyes and pierced into the poisonous gas. Wu qiandu screamed in pain as his resistance was instantly weakened.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to release his devouring power, devouring and refining the poisonous gas that Wu qiandu had turned into.</p><p>As he screamed, the cloud of poisonous gas that Wu Qian Du had turned into became smaller and smaller.</p><p>He wanted to reform his body, but Lu Ming attacked him directly. With a punch, he turned into poisonous gas again and was devoured and refined by Lu Ming.</p><p>Very quickly, the poisonous gas that Wu Qian Du had turned into was reduced by more than half.</p><p>“Spare me, please spare me!”</p><p>Wu Qian Du was finally scared and started to beg for mercy.</p><p>The feeling of watching himself being refined made him extremely frightened.</p><p>Moreover, he didn’t want to die. He had a bright future ahead of him. With his talent, he was very confident that he could break through to the Saint realm in the future.</p><p>How carefree was a Saint realm expert with a lifespan of more than 100000 years?</p><p>&Nbsp; the spectators from the thirteen sects were all stunned.</p><p>Wu Qian Du had actually been forced to this extent by Lu Ming?</p><p>In the eyes of these heaven’s favorites, Wu Qian Du was a terrifying existence. With his thousand-bath poison body and his deadly poison, no one wouldn’t be afraid of him. Even those heaven’s favorites at his level would be afraid of him.</p><p>But now, he was begging for mercy in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>“Spare my life? Previously, you sent people from the Yu Du sect to kill our Dragon God Valley disciples. Why didn’t you spare them? why didn’t you think about the current situation?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. The devouring power continued to devour.</p><p>Wu Qian Du cried out in pain, and the poisonous gas continued to roll.</p><p>Before the battle with Lu Ming, he would not have thought of such an outcome. All he could think of was how to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>Wisps of poisonous gas were devoured by Lu Ming and then refined. The poisonous gas that Wu qiandu had turned into was getting smaller and smaller.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
