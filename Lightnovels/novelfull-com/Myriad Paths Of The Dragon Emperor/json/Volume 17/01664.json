A true Dragon’s Shadow appeared on su Lei’s body, emitting a shocking cold air.</p><p>“Mysterious Yin dragon body!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>At this moment, a Dragon’s Roar was heard from the brilliant light. Then, the light flew directly towards su Lei and enveloped her.</p><p>Slowly, the ball of light turned into a true dragon. The appearance of this true dragon was extremely similar to the vacuum that appeared on su Lei’s body.</p><p>The mysterious Yin Dragon!</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The true dragon formed by the light wrapped around su Lei. Su Lei seemed to have sensed something. She sat down cross-legged and closed her eyes. She looked solemn.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>In front of her, a bracelet flew over and floated above su Lei’s head.</p><p>“Inheritance, storage bracelet!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and a smile appeared on his face.</p><p>Then, he took a step forward and appeared where the ball of light had been. There, a snow-white jade-like bone Chi was lying on the ground.</p><p>True dragon Bone Gu!</p><p>“As expected!”</p><p>The smile on Lu Ming’s face grew wider.</p><p>It turned out that a powerful true dragon had fallen in the so-called ancestral land. Although the true dragon had fallen, its soul was not destroyed. Therefore, every time the SU family’s disciples came, the true dragon’s soul would give them a treasure.</p><p>The bracelet floating above su Lei’s head was the storage bracelet of the true dragon.</p><p>The function of a storage bracelet was the same as a storage ring. It contained space and was a treasure for storing items.</p><p>Moreover, this true dragon was the mysterious Yin Dragon, which was a perfect match for su Lei’s physique. Therefore, when su Lei came in this time, the soul of the true dragon wanted to pass the inheritance to her.</p><p>From now on, the descendants of the four great families would not be able to obtain any benefits when they entered.</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind turned and he understood everything clearly.</p><p>This was su Lei’s chance.</p><p>However, this Dragon’s bone was of great use to Lu Ming. When this mysterious Yin Dragon was alive, it was definitely not just at the bright Saint stage. It was at least above the great saint stage. Since Lu Ming had come across it, he would not miss it.</p><p>He waved his hand and kept the Dragon Bone. Then, he sat cross-legged not far from su Lei and waited.</p><p>From the looks of it, the inheritance wouldn’t end any time soon.</p><p>The figure of the mysterious Yin Dragon wrapped around su Lei’s body, and the light continuously seeped into su Lei’s body.</p><p>Time passed day by day.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed.</p><p>At this moment, the true dragon that was coiling around su Lei’s body had completely disappeared. A terrifying cold Qi spread out from su Lei’s body, and a River of profound Yin Water curled around her body.</p><p>my body constitution has actually evolved into a superior earth spiritual body and is infinitely close to a heaven spiritual body. My cultivation has also reached the peak of the LV 6 martial Royal realm!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>Su Lei’s physique was originally a medium-grade earth spiritual body, but now it had reached a superior-grade earth spiritual body, which was infinitely close to a heaven spiritual body. The power of the mysterious Yin River was absolutely terrifying. An ordinary sixth or even seventh level Martial Emperor would be frozen to death in an instant.</p><p>Su Lei’s cultivation had previously been at the early stage of the sixth level Martial Emperor realm. Now, it had advanced to the peak of the sixth level Martial Emperor realm. Although the improvement was not much, su Lei’s cultivation speed would be astonishing and she would advance by leaps and bounds in the future.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He was happy for this kind young lady.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar resounded. A light pillar rushed out of su Lei’s body and went straight into the sky. The entire area was shaking violently.</p><p>Lu Ming knew that the legacy had entered its final stage. The soul of the mysterious Yin Dragon would soon be annihilated.</p><p>However, this was his own choice.</p><p>Outside the ancestral land, the four family patriarchs and the others were waiting.</p><p>“What’s going on? It’s already been half a month since we entered the ancestral land!”</p><p>in the past, when others entered the ancestral land, it would take no more than three days before they came out. Why is it half a month this time? ”</p><p>“Don’t tell me they all died inside!”</p><p>Many people were making guesses.</p><p>The patriarchs of the four great families also had unsightly expressions.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>All of a sudden, a Dragon’s Roar came from the ancestral land. Then, the vortex on the stone wall burst out with a bright light. The stone wall shook violently and exploded with a bang.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>“What happened inside?”</p><p>The family patriarchs of the big families started to shout.</p><p>At that moment, an extremely terrifying aura burst out from the four directions of Gusu city. The vast pressure enveloped the entire city.</p><p>Then, four figures appeared in the air.</p><p>Each figure was shrouded in brilliant holy light, and their Holy might bloomed.</p><p>Saint, the Saint realm patriarchs of the four families have been alerted.</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>The four Saint realm patriarchs of the four great families descended at the entrance of the ancestral land.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Old ancestor su spoke.</p><p>patriarch, I don’t know what happened. Su Lei and the others have been in there for half a month and haven’t come out yet. Now, such a shocking change suddenly happened!</p><p>The head of the SU family said.</p><p>“The ancestral land has changed, let’s go in and take a look!”</p><p>“Let’s go in!”</p><p>The Saint realm patriarchs of the other families said one after another. Then, they stepped into the vortex and disappeared.</p><p>The patriarchs of the big families also followed their patriarchs into the ancestral land.</p><p>“Let’s go in too!”</p><p>&Nbsp; old ancestor su said to the SU family head and then the two of them charged into the ancestral land.</p><p>The Saint realm patriarchs and clan leaders of the four families saw Lu Ming and su Lei sitting cross-legged as soon as they entered the ancestral land.</p><p>But everyone’s eyes were on su Lei.</p><p>the inheritance! The inheritance has been taken by her!</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>The Saint realm patriarchs of the other three families growled, and their eyes were full of killing intent.</p><p>“What do you want? This is the opportunity of my su family’s disciples. Do you want to interfere?”</p><p>The SU family’s Saint realm ancestor said.</p><p>“What opportunity? This place originally belonged to our four great clans. Now that she has completely obtained the inheritance, the future generation of disciples who come here will not be able to obtain anything!”</p><p>that’s right. That storage bracelet should have been left behind by the ancestral land. We must get it and split the treasures inside equally!</p><p>The Saint realm patriarchs spoke one after another.</p><p>Old ancestor su and the head of the SU family had ugly expressions.</p><p>These people were too overbearing.</p><p>According to the rules of the four great families, when the younger generation entered this place, no matter what kind of opportunities they obtained, they would all belong to them. Of course, this included all the inheritances.</p><p>But now, the patriarchs of the other families were obviously envious and unwilling to give up. They wanted to split it equally.</p><p>The Saint realm patriarchs naturally knew about the ancestral land.</p><p>But in the past, when the mysterious Yin Dragon’s Dragon Soul was still around, even they didn’t dare to have any ideas. This was because there had been sage realm powerhouses who had thought of getting their hands on the mysterious Yin Dragon’s Dragon Soul in the past and had been killed here.</p><p>But now, they no longer had such concerns.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
