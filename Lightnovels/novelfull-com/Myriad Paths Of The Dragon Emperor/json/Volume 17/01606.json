Then, the black wings flew out. Lu Ming circulated the ten thousand soldiers art, and a light spot lit up on his spine. Lu Ming sealed the black wings into this acupoint.</p><p>After sealing the two Saint weapons, the two acupoints seemed to be connected through meridians. A wisp of battle weapon Qi flowed through the meridians and gathered.</p><p>...</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took out a combat sword. This combat sword was also a holy weapon. He sealed it in the acupoint of his left palm.</p><p>The three acupoints were connected through the meridians.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming began to seal the fourth holy weapon.</p><p>As more and more holy weapons were sealed, the battle weapon Qi grew stronger and stronger. The pressure on Lu Ming’s acupoints also grew stronger. With every holy weapon sealed, Lu Ming’s acupoints felt like they were about to be torn apart. It was extremely painful.</p><p>However, Lu Ming gritted his teeth and endured all of them.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming sealed ten holy weapons in one go.</p><p>The ten holy weapons were sealed in ten acupoints, connecting with each other through the meridians. The battle weapon Qi was extremely strong.</p><p>He had finally reached his limit. Lu Ming felt that if he continued to seal, his body would not be able to withstand it and would be torn apart by the combat weapon Qi.</p><p>If he wanted to seal more holy weapons, he would have to wait for his cultivation to increase or for his spirit body to evolve again.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming soared into the sky. With a single thought, ten light spots lit up on his body. Ten holy weapons appeared and floated around him. Lu Ming held the Black Dragon Spear and thrust it out. A terrifying spear light pierced thousands of miles away before it disappeared.</p><p>the power is really shocking. This ten thousand weapons scroll is called ten thousand weapons. If it can really seal ten thousand Saint weapons, its power will probably be earth-shattering, and even stronger Saint weapons, such as great saint weapons, extreme Saint weapons, and even sovereign weapons. How terrifying will that be? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s face was filled with surprise.</p><p>The ten thousand soldiers scroll was a secret skill, a terrifying secret skill.</p><p>If he cultivated the 10000 soldier domain to the 10000 soldier law, this secret skill would turn into a terrifying divine power.</p><p>With another thought, the ten Saint weapons flew back into his body and disappeared.</p><p>the thousand-kill mansion has left a slaughter mark on my main body. If they can find me based on the mark, I’ll let my second body move around outside and find a city. My main body will refine the demon killing crystals in the mountain and river diagram and improve its soul strength. It’s killing two birds with one stone!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>His main body was in the mountain and river diagram, and he didn’t believe that the other party could still sense the slaughter mark.</p><p>With this in mind, he left the mountain and river diagram, and then the mountain, heading toward the depths of the hundred clan battlefield.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he took out a demonic evil crystal at Lv 6 martial Royal realm from the mountain and river diagram and started refining it.</p><p>After the energy of the demonic fiend crystal surged into his body, it would turn into a ball of demonic Qi and surge into his dantian, enveloping his spiritual God. Lu Ming felt a numbing itch in his soul and a tearing pain.</p><p>This was the energy of the demonic fiend crystal, which was tempering the soul and making it stronger and stronger.</p><p>A few hours later, a Lv 6 martial Royal realm demonic fiend crystal was completely refined. Lu Ming’s soul had improved a little. Although it was only a little, it was already many times faster than when Lu Ming cultivated the divine sword technique to increase his soul force.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took out another demonic evil crystal at Lv 6 martial Royal realm and continued to refine it.</p><p>The second body concealed its aura and entered deep into the hundred clan battlefield.</p><p>Along the way, he saw many battles between heaven’s favorites. Each time, both sides would be heavily injured or one of them would die.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had no intention of fighting them now. When he saw these paragons, he would take a long detour. He planned to find a city first before making any plans.</p><p>Sure enough, after the main body stayed in the mountain and river diagram, the assassins from the thousand-kill mansion never came again.</p><p>After a few days, a huge city appeared in front of them.</p><p>The city was huge and magnificent. The city walls were hundreds of meters high and the city gate was heavily guarded.</p><p>These people were all native and had grown up in the hundred clan battlefield.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped into the city and realized that it was very lively. People came and went, and there were many shops.</p><p>On the streets, he could see young experts with strong auras. Lu Ming glanced around and found that most of them were at the eighth or ninth level of the martial Royal realm. Sometimes, he could even see the existence of the half-Saint realm.</p><p>Most of these youths were like Lu Ming. They had been trained in the hundred clan battlefield.</p><p>However, these people would enter the city once in a while to rest and reorganize.</p><p>After all, there were local saints in the city. They were not allowed to kill in the city, so they could relax and adjust their conditions. There was also a special market in the city where many elites would exchange for treasures.</p><p>The hundred clan battlefield was filled with danger but also with opportunities. Countless treasures had been left behind from the ancient war. Some people had taken the risk and obtained some treasures.</p><p>Lu Ming walked around and found an Inn. He booked a room.</p><p>After entering the room, the second body sat cross-legged and began to cultivate.</p><p>In the next few days, Lu Ming’s main body was refining the demonic fiend crystals in the mountain and river diagram. His soul was getting stronger and stronger. Now, his soul force had completely reached the first stage of the half-Saint realm and was close to the second stage.</p><p>However, it was not enough. Lu Ming was still refining the demonic fiend crystals.</p><p>Ten days after Lu Ming entered the city, his soul power finally made another breakthrough and reached the second stage of the half lifetime.</p><p>With his soul power at this level, Lu Ming could use the divine sword technique to shake the soul of a second stage half-Saint expert. He would be greatly affected.</p><p>Lu Ming only stopped cultivating the demonic fiend crystals for the time being.</p><p>“Let’s go to the Asura stage!”</p><p>With a thought, his secondary body entered the mountain and river diagram, while his main body exited the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>During this period of time, the second body would occasionally go out to inquire about news and had learned a lot of information about the city.</p><p>The Asura arena was a battle platform. It was the only place in the city where one could fight.</p><p>Many heaven’s favorites from the outside world would go up to the Asura stage to find opponents and engage in a life-and-death battle. They would walk on the edge of life and death to stimulate their potential and make a leap.</p><p>Lu Ming also wanted to stay in the Asura arena and find opponents to fight against. He wanted to temper himself and improve his cultivation.</p><p>Not long after, a building appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>The building was not big. Lu Ming walked in and realized that there was a fighting ring in the building. There were no seats around the fighting ring. Some young people were standing around and watching.</p><p>There were about a few hundred people.</p><p>On the fighting ring, there were two young men engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>The two young men were both at the peak Lv 8 martial Royal realm. They both had superior earth spiritual bodies, and their combat strength was not very different. They fought fiercely for hundreds of moves, and it was difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>Hu! Hu!</p><p>The two of them stood on both sides of the fighting ring with many wounds on their bodies. Both of them were injured.</p><p>However, the two of them did not step down from the fighting ring. There was a light screen covering the fighting ring, making it difficult for them to get down.</p><p>Lu Ming had already known that the fighting stage was called the Asura arena. Once one stepped into it, a light screen would rise around the fighting stage and cover it. Then, there were only two paths.</p><p>One was to kill the opponent and end the battle.</p><p>The second was to hold on for half an hour. Only after half an hour would the light screen disappear and he could leave the fighting ring.</p><p>One couldn’t admit defeat on the Asura arena.</p><p>Therefore, once one set foot on the Asura arena and encountered an opponent whose strength was much higher than one’s own, only death awaited them.</p><p>Therefore, many people would choose opponents of similar cultivation or slightly higher cultivation to fight to the death to temper themselves.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
