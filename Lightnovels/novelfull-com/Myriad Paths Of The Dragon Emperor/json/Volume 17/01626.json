They did not expect Lu Ming, who was only at the ninth level of the martial Royal realm, to have a map. It was obvious that it was a set with the key in Huang Ling’s hand.</p><p>However, with Huang Ling’s abilities, why didn’t she snatch the map from Lu Ming’s hands? Wouldn’t it be better to combine the map and the key? why did they have to control one each?</p><p>...</p><p>“He’s from your Phoenix Palace?”</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince asked curiously.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Huang Ling shook her head.</p><p>“Not from the Phoenix Palace?”</p><p>Many people’s eyes lit up.</p><p>a mere Lv 9 martial Royal realm expert is not qualified to control the map of the tomb of the Samsara King. Just give it to me!</p><p>A cold voice was heard. A figure stepped out and a powerful aura enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>“Blood prison’s young master!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with a cold light.</p><p>boy, give me the map of the tomb of the reincarnation King. You don’t deserve it!</p><p>The young master of blood prison said coldly. His eyes were filled with greed.</p><p>With his strength, he didn’t even get a key or map to the tomb of the reincarnation King, which made him jealous.</p><p>None of the others were weaker than him, so he naturally did not dare to make a move. However, Lu Ming was merely at the ninth level of the martial Royal realm and he did not take him seriously at all.</p><p>On the side, the tenth golden Crow Prince, ye Dongfang, and the others just looked on indifferently. They didn’t say anything and didn’t stop him.</p><p>Having the map or the key meant that they were qualified to open the tomb of the reincarnation King with them.</p><p>However, those who had the map and the key were all extremely talented and powerful. Lu Ming was only at the ninth level of the martial Royal realm. How could he be qualified to be with them?</p><p>“I’m not qualified? Do you have one?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“I didn’t? Then I’ll let you know if I have it or not.”</p><p>Young master of blood prison’s eyes were cold. A blood-red light condensed on his body, and his powerful aura pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Suddenly, the cry of a Phoenix was heard. A powerful aura burst out from Huang Ling’s body and she stood in front of Lu Ming. She stared at young master of blood prison and said coldly, ” “Blood prison, Lu Ming is with me. If you want to attack him, let’s see if you can defeat me!”</p><p>“Feng Ling, what are you doing? Do you really want to cooperate with a Lv 9 martial Royal realm expert? I’m afraid that he will be a burden to you when we enter the tomb of the reincarnation King. Give me the map and work with me. That’s the way to go!”</p><p>The blood prison young master said, trying to persuade Feng Ling.</p><p>“Get lost, or we’ll fight!”</p><p>shut up! Huang Ling scolded coldly.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>The young master of blood prison was furious, but he was afraid of Huang Ling.</p><p>Although Huang Ling was a heaven’s favorite on the same level as him, she had the undying Heavenly Phoenix body and her life force was too strong. In battle, she was not afraid of death. She used her strong life force to exhaust her opponents to death.</p><p>Among the heaven’s favorites of the same level, Feng Ling was the most difficult to deal with.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Young master of blood prison roared in his heart. What was wrong with this Huang Ling? was she out of her mind? she would rather work with Lu Ming than him. What was the difference between bringing Lu Ming along and bringing a burden?</p><p>“Could this kid be Feng Ling’s lover?”</p><p>‘Young master of blood prison’ thought.</p><p>He was not the only one. Many people around the square had the same thought.</p><p>kid, with your cultivation, you won’t get any treasure even if you enter the tomb of the reincarnation King. You’ll only waste the map. I’ll give you a chance now. How about you sell the map to me? ”</p><p>The young master of blood prison still didn’t give up.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s answer was very simple. It was only one word.</p><p>“What did you just say?”</p><p>The killing intent of the young master of blood prison grew. He glared at Lu Ming and said, kid, don’t think that you can be so arrogant just because you have Huang Ling’s support. You’re just a piece of trash who only knows how to hide behind a woman. Let’s see if you can keep the map of the tomb of the reincarnation King!</p><p>After saying that, the young master of blood prison snorted coldly and left the square.</p><p>In the crowd, two people looked at Lu Ming with fear. They were Zhao Kuang and Sima Liang. The two of them had also come to Darkwater city. They knew Lu Ming’s combat strength very well. Even Wan Tiancheng had been killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Of course, they would not remind the young master of blood prison about Lu Ming’s combat strength. Wouldn’t it be better if Lu Ming made enemies? He could borrow the hands of others to deal with Lu Ming.</p><p>“Does anyone else have the map and key to the tomb of the reincarnation King?”</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince’s voice rang out again.</p><p>The crowd around the square looked at each other. This time, no one stepped out.</p><p>After that, the tenth golden Crow Prince asked a few more questions, but no one came out.</p><p>Obviously, there was no more.</p><p>“Everyone, we have seven sets here. Let’s take a look and see if they’re all here. What do you think?”</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince suggested.</p><p>“Good, just what I want!”</p><p>Ye Dongfang was the first to speak, followed by the others.</p><p>“Let’s activate the pattern on the map and put it together to take a look!”</p><p>The Golden Crow tenth Prince said. With a wave of his hand, a Golden Screen of light enveloped them, making it impossible for anyone else to see them.</p><p>Many sighed. They had originally wanted to peek at the map, but it seemed like they had no chance.</p><p>Within the golden light screen, the tenth golden Crow Prince took out two Jade talismans. He poured energy into them, and the two Jade talismans lit up. In the air, two maps appeared.</p><p>Then, ye Dongfang also injected his ethereal force into the Jade talisman, and another map appeared.</p><p>The three pieces of the map pieced together in the air to form an even larger map, but it was obvious that it was incomplete.</p><p>Following that, the rest of them channeled their vital essence into their Jade talismans and incomplete maps appeared one after another. Lu Ming did the same and the Jade talisman in his hand also appeared.</p><p>A total of seven maps were pieced together.</p><p>“It’s still incomplete!”</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince’s face darkened.</p><p>It was obvious that the seven pieces of the map were pieced together to form a larger map, but it was still missing something.</p><p>There was a missing piece in the middle and a missing corner on both sides. According to the size, there should be three missing pieces.</p><p>There should be ten maps and Ten Keys in total.</p><p>it’s indeed incomplete. There’s no specific location on the map. It seems that only when all ten maps are complete will the specific location be shown!</p><p>Ye Dongfang said.</p><p>perhaps the person who obtained the remaining map and keys of the tomb of the Samsara King is not in Darkwater city but in the other three cities!</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>In the center of the hundred tribes battlefield, there were four major cities where a large number of geniuses had gathered. The remaining maps were likely to be in other cities.</p><p>it’s possible. I’ll send people to the other three cities to spread the news. It’s best for us to stay in Darkwater city for the time being. When the map and key are ready, we’ll set off for the tomb of the reincarnation Emperor!</p><p>The Golden Crow tenth Prince said.</p><p>The others nodded and put away the map.</p><p>Some of them glanced at Lu Ming coldly and a strange light flashed in their eyes. However, after they glanced at Huang Ling, they all looked fearful.</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince waved his hand, and the light barrier disappeared.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were on them, wondering if they knew where the tomb of the reincarnation Emperor was.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
