BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In front of him, there were a total of ten auras, like smoke signals, extremely terrifying.</p><p>...</p><p>The most shocking thing was that four of the auras were no weaker than the black-robed elder. They were not ordinary saints, but perfected bright Saints.</p><p>One of them even had a world-shaking aura, much stronger than a great bright Saint.</p><p>A peak bright Saint!</p><p>Many people’s faces turned pale.</p><p>This time, the other party had sent a peak bright Saint, four in the upper tier of the bright Saint realm, and more than ten in the lower tier.</p><p>Such a lineup was too terrifying. If they were surrounded, they would only have a path of death. They would not have any chance.</p><p>“All of you, enter my mountain and river diagram!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared and summoned the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>With so many people, they would definitely not be able to rush out. If Lu Ming was alone, it might be possible.</p><p>The others did not resist. Lu Ming’s combat strength surpassed theirs. If Lu Ming could not break out, they would not be able to either.</p><p>In an instant, everyone was kept into the mountain and river diagram by Lu Ming.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming used the thundering wind steps, changed his direction, and dashed out like a bolt of lightning.</p><p>this kid has a Grotto-heaven treasure. Don’t let him escape!</p><p>A furious roar rang out.</p><p>More than 20 sages chased after Lu Ming frantically.</p><p>Among them, the powerhouse at the peak of the bright Saint realm was the fastest. He took the lead and quickly chased after Lu Ming. Behind him, the four great perfected bright Saints, including the black-robed elder, followed closely.</p><p>No matter how amazing the thundering wind steps was and how fast he was, Lu Ming’s cultivation was only at the first stage of the half-Saint realm. He was still far behind the mastery of the bright Saint realm or even the peak of the bright Saint realm. Hence, he was still slower.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The powerhouse at the peak of the bright Saint realm was approaching Lu Ming at an alarming speed.</p><p>A terrifying Saber Light slashed out from this person’s hand, aiming at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. He was definitely not a match for a peak bright Saint.</p><p>At this moment, the bubbles opened a space-time Tunnel. Lu Ming rushed into the space-time Tunnel and appeared thousands of miles away.</p><p>space-time domain, damn it!</p><p>The powerhouse at the peak of the bright Saint stage roared. The aura on his body rumbled and his speed suddenly increased. He turned into a stream of light and rushed toward Lu Ming, traveling thousands of miles in an instant.</p><p>“So fast?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed drastically. He flew at high speed, but not long after, the other party closed the distance between them.</p><p>Lu Ming had no choice but to let bubbles open the space-time Tunnel again.</p><p>Just like that, after a few more times, the other Saints had already left him in the dust. However, the peak bright Saint was still following closely behind.</p><p>“We can’t continue like this!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind kept spinning.</p><p>It consumed a lot of energy for bubbles to open the space-time Tunnel. It was impossible for them to open it continuously. At most, they could open it for more than ten times before their energy was exhausted.</p><p>The spacetime tunnel could only be used to save one’s life at a critical moment, but it was unrealistic to use it to travel.</p><p>At this rate, the other party would catch up to Lu Ming before he could rush out of the hundred clan battlefield.</p><p>“Let’s go to the tomb of the reincarnation King!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He had no choice but to go to the tomb of the reincarnation Emperor and try his best.</p><p>If it did not work, Lu Ming could only use the reincarnation halberd.</p><p>However, the reincarnation halberd only had two streams of energy. If it was used at full force, it could kill anyone below the Emperor realm. It was too precious. It was a waste to use it on a person at the peak of the bright Saint realm.</p><p>Lu Ming was definitely not willing to use it unless he had no other choice.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately changed his direction and flew towards the tomb of the reincarnation King.</p><p>Fortunately, they were not too far away from the tomb of the Samsara Emperor. Every time Lu Ming was almost caught up by the other party, he would ask bubbles to open the space-time Tunnel and increase the distance between them. Then, he would fly on his own to give bubbles time to recover.</p><p>When the other party approached, he would open a spacetime tunnel and increase the distance.</p><p>Just like that, one chased and the other chased, boundless mountains and rivers flitted past under their feet.</p><p>After an unknown period of time, just as the bubble’s energy was about to be exhausted, a huge mountain that had been split into two appeared in front of them.</p><p>They had arrived at the tomb of the reincarnation King!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes brightened and he rushed straight into the passage. A strong pressure pressed down on him and he strode forward.</p><p>It didn’t take long for the peak bright Saint to arrive and rush into the passage.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>He was caught off guard as the terrifying pressure pressed down on him. Even with his cultivation at the peak of a bright Saint, he fell directly to the ground and almost fell flat on his face.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The expert at the peak of the bright Saint stage was boiling with Saint power. He wanted to break through the pressure and catch up with Lu Ming, but it was of no use. It seemed that the stronger his cultivation was, the stronger the pressure he faced. In the end, his face was flushed red, and he could only step forward and chase after Lu Ming.</p><p>Just like that, the two of them advanced through the passageway. Very quickly, a day had passed.</p><p>A day had passed, but the passage was still boundless.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred. When they came out, they had completed this passageway in a day. However, a day had passed and the road ahead was still long.</p><p>Could it be that it took half a month to go in, but only a day to come out?</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming’s guess was confirmed.</p><p>Time passed day by day, and they still hadn’t reached the end of the passage.</p><p>The peak bright Saint was a thin middle-aged man. His expression was extremely gloomy, but he was an old monster who had lived for a long time and was naturally very patient.</p><p>Time flew by, and half a month had passed. They had finally reached the end of the passage.</p><p>Lu Ming crossed the passage and entered the graveyard. The graveyard glowed instantly and shadows appeared, attacking Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a few punches in succession, crushing a few shadows before he dashed forward quickly.</p><p>Not long after, a peak bright Saint also rushed through the passage and entered the graveyard.</p><p>However, just as the peak bright Saints stepped into the area of the graves, the graves began to glow with a brilliant light. The power of laws surged and the shadows almost materialized.</p><p>“Saint realm, die!”</p><p>The illusionary image of a fire bull let out a long roar and stomped down with blazing flames.</p><p>The face of the expert at the peak of the bright Saint realm changed drastically. He struck out with his blade, but the blade light shattered. The fire bull stepped on his chest, and the expert at the peak of the bright Saint realm screamed in pain. His body flew far away, and blood spurted out of his mouth. His chest had been blown apart. If it weren’t for his profound cultivation and strong vitality, he would have died.</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p><p>When the other party had charged in, why did the laws on the tombs suddenly go berserk? they had unleashed a terrifying attack that had severely injured a peak bright Saint.</p><p>could it be that we can’t enter the Saint realm here? once someone enters the Saint realm, it will trigger the law above the tomb? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s imagination ran wild.</p><p>This was truly a pleasant surprise. He had originally wanted to enter the land of reincarnation to avoid the other party’s pursuit, but now it seemed that there was no need.</p><p>“Haha, old man, if you have the ability, then come and chase me!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but burst out laughing.</p><p>“Little bastard, just you wait! Unless you hide in there forever!”</p><p>The peak bright sage glared at Lu Ming angrily and looked at the graves with fear. Then, he turned around and left for the passage.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
