The heavenly God sect will not let you off no matter where you go!</p><p>The master of the SU family bellowed. The aura of a third stage half-Saint surged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>...</p><p>However, Lu Ming stood there calmly, not even the corner of his clothes fluttered.</p><p>“Damn it, you deserve to die. How dare you kill the senior brother of the heavenly God sect!”</p><p>no! Su Qin also roared madly. Her plan this time, her painstaking planning, was completely destroyed.</p><p>don’t forget that the heaven’s pride expert of the tianshen sect died in your su family. If the people of the tianshen sect knew about this, who knows what they would think? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>Su Qin, the head of the SU family, and the other members of the SU family were shocked.</p><p>That’s right. The heaven’s pride of the heavenly God sect had died in the SU family. If the heavenly God sect knew about this, who knew if it would implicate the SU family? at that time, the heavenly God sect would be enraged and the SU family would definitely be destroyed.</p><p>“Damn it …”</p><p>The head of the SU family, Su Qin, and the others were so angry that they wanted to vomit blood.</p><p>Not only could they not tell anyone about this matter, but they had to hide it and help Lu Ming hide it.</p><p>“For this matter, you have to pay with your lives. You all have to die!”</p><p>Su Qin screamed hysterically.</p><p>She had paid an important price to invite the help of the three heaven’s pride experts of the tianshen sect. Her purpose was to help the SU family win so that she could enter the ancestral land and obtain opportunities.</p><p>But now, all of it was ruined by Lu Ming.</p><p>She hated. She hated su Lei for not agreeing obediently. She hated Lu Ming for interfering.</p><p>“Kill, kill them all!”</p><p>Su Qin shouted and gave the order.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The SU family experts around the courtyard pounced on Lu Ming, su Lei, and the rest.</p><p>These su family experts were all high-level martial Royal realm experts, and some of them were even half-Saints.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were sharp as he shouted.</p><p>Not only did Lu Ming use the divine sword technique, but the sound waves also contained a terrifying amount of vital essence.</p><p>The SU family’s experts who were pouncing on Lu Ming and the rest screamed in pain. Then, their bodies seemed to have been hit by a sledgehammer. They retreated at a speed faster than when they had pounced forward, blood spurting out of their mouths.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>Su Qin and a few others who had not made a move widened their eyes in disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming was too terrifying. With one shout, dozens of su family’s experts, including a few half-step Saint experts, vomited blood and fell back. What cultivation was that? What kind of combat strength?</p><p>Su Lei, su Cha, and su Lei’s mother were also dumbfounded.</p><p>“Senior brother Lu Ming has become stronger again!”</p><p>Su Lei muttered.</p><p>A year and a half ago, although Lu Ming’s cultivation was strong, it was not as exaggerated. Now, his cultivation was simply unfathomable.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were like lightning. He looked at Su Qin and clenched his fist. Su Qin screamed and her body flew towards Lu Ming involuntarily. Lu Ming grabbed her neck and lifted her in the air.</p><p>“Father, father, save me!”</p><p>Su Qin screamed in fear.</p><p>“Release her!”</p><p>The master of the SU family bellowed. He unleashed his cultivation with all his might. The law of wind condensed and enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>“Have you thought it through? Do you really want to fight me?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the master of the SU family.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Then, a terrifying aura burst out from Lu Ming’s body. The terrifying Laws of Chaos filled the air and pressed down on the master of the SU family.</p><p>&Nbsp; the SU family head felt like he was struck by lightning. His body trembled and he couldn’t help but retreat, almost spurting out blood.</p><p>The difference was too great. In the eyes of the SU family’s master, Lu Ming seemed to have transformed into a primordial beast that was undefeatable.</p><p>The master of the SU family was shocked. His mind whirred. Suddenly, he retracted his aura and actually cupped his fists at Lu Ming.”This young master is truly a peerless genius. I was blind before, please forgive me!”</p><p>This action stunned even Lu Ming.</p><p>The head of the SU family was indeed the head of a family, he knew the principle of judging the situation.</p><p>“Today’s matter has never happened. These three people from the heavenly God sect have never appeared in the SU family. Su Lei’s position in the SU family will be like Qin ‘er’s!”</p><p>The master of the SU family continued to speak. He wanted to ease the tension between him and Lu Ming and su Lei.</p><p>hehe, you change your attitude pretty quickly. Get lost!</p><p>Lu Ming slapped Su Qin’s face and sent her flying.</p><p>“Ah, you dare to hit me! Father, kill them, kill them!”</p><p>Su Qin screamed hysterically.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>shut up! the head of the SU family chided Su Qin, shutting her up.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. If they were outside, she would have slapped Su Qin to death.</p><p>However, this was su Lei’s family after all. She still had other family members in the SU family. He could not go too far. He only needed to establish his authority.</p><p>“Young master, how should I address you?”</p><p>The SU family head smiled and cupped his fists.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the master of the SU family and said indifferently, ” “Lu Ming!”</p><p>“Oh, it’s brother Lu … Wait … You … Your name is Lu Ming? Lu Ming of the Dragon God Valley?”</p><p>what? ” the SU family head cried out in shock.</p><p>Three years ago, news of Lu Ming’s battle with the divine Son had spread throughout the Azure region. Even some of the bigger forces had heard of Lu Ming’s name.</p><p>Su Qin and the other experts of the SU family widened their eyes in shock.</p><p>It turned out that this person was Lu Ming. Had Lu Ming become so powerful?</p><p>if there’s no other Lu Ming in Dragon God Valley, it’ll be me!</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“So it’s brother Lu Ming. I must have been blind to not recognize the true dragon right before my eyes. Brother Lu Ming, I have a presumptuous request!”</p><p>The family head of the SU family smiled and immediately addressed Lu Ming as his brother. He did not look like he was at daggers drawn with Lu Ming just now.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“I would like to invite brother Lu Ming to represent the SU family in the competition between the four great families. As long as brother Lu Ming agrees to it, I’m willing to state any conditions!”</p><p>The head of the SU family said.</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. He did not expect the SU family’s head to ask him to fight for the SU family. It was beyond his expectations.</p><p>Su Qin’s eyes lit up. If Lu Ming made a move, the SU family would definitely win.</p><p>“It’s not that I can’t take action, but I have two conditions!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, please tell me!”</p><p>The SU family head was delighted and quickly said.</p><p>first, in the future, su Lei and her family will stay in the SU family. I don’t want to hear anyone bullying them!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>don’t worry about this. In the future, if su Lei, her family, and her clansmen dare to bully them in the SU family, I will not let them off easily, no matter who it is.</p><p>yes! the head of the SU family agreed readily.</p><p>the second condition is that if I help the SU family get first place, the person who enters the ancestral land must be su Lei!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>impossible! This is impossible!</p><p>Su Qin yelled.</p><p>Letting su Lei enter the ancestral land would have nothing to do with her, so she naturally wouldn’t agree.</p><p>The master of the SU family furrowed his brows. He wanted Lu Ming’s help more for Su Qin.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
