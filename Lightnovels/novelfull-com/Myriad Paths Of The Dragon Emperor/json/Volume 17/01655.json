He then let out a furious roar.</p><p>When he found out that Lu Ming had killed an initial bright Saint and an expert in the advanced bright Saint realm, he almost vomited blood.</p><p>...</p><p>This time, they had failed to capture Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Half a year ago, he was not the only one who was injured. This time, he had even lost two experts.</p><p>After waiting here for half a year, the other party didn’t even leave a single hair behind. Their depression could be imagined.</p><p>“Inform all the races to pursue any outsiders in the hundred clan battlefield. In the future, kill any outsiders you see without mercy!”</p><p>The powerhouse at the peak of the bright Saint stage roared, his killing intent extremely strong.</p><p>……</p><p>After passing through a few space-time passageways, Lu Ming changed his direction and flew toward the periphery of the hundred clan battlefield.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current speed was extremely fast. He flew across the sky like a ray of light. Half a day later, Lu Ming had already arrived at the periphery of the hundred clan battlefield.</p><p>MMH!</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He heard a violent boom in front of him. It was the sound of a battle.</p><p>Lu Ming flew forward.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming saw four young people being chased by a group of exotic beasts.</p><p>“It’s them. What a coincidence!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into an inexplicable smile.</p><p>The four young men were actually Yun Xi and Yun Kai.</p><p>After more than a year, the cultivation of the four of them had also improved greatly.</p><p>Yunxi’s cultivation had reached the peak of the ninth level martial Royal realm when she first entered the hundred clan battlefield. Now, she had reached the second level of the half-Saint realm, which was the same as Lu Ming’s.</p><p>Yun Kai and the other two had also reached the first stage of the half-Saint realm.</p><p>But now, they were in great danger, being chased by a group of strange beasts.</p><p>Yun Xi, Yun Kai, and the other two were very depressed.</p><p>They had been moving around the outskirts of the hundred clan battlefield during this period of time. They trained in some of the cities on the outskirts, and their cultivation levels had steadily increased.</p><p>However, more than half a year ago, the natives of the hundred clan battlefield had gone crazy and started hunting down foreign prodigies.</p><p>They were lucky to have escaped the disaster and found a safe place to hide.</p><p>They had been hiding for more than half a year. Recently, they had all broken through in their cultivation and wanted to rush out of the hundred clan battlefield and return to the cloud Emperor mountain.</p><p>However, not long after he came out, he was chased by a group of exotic beasts.</p><p>The combined combat power of this group of Ultra Beasts was twice as strong as them. They were no match for them at all.</p><p>“Charge, charge out!”</p><p>Yunxi shouted. Her long spear danced like a dragon and blocked the three strange beasts of the second stage of the half-Saint realm.</p><p>They wanted to rush out, but the beasts were holding them back.</p><p>“Ah, Yunkai, what are you doing?”</p><p>Suddenly, an angry roar was heard.</p><p>It turned out that Yun Kai had suddenly made a move, sending Yun que flying with a palm strike. Many strange beasts immediately pounced towards Yun que.</p><p>Yun que let out an angry roar and exploded with all his strength to resist.</p><p>“Yunkai, you …”</p><p>Yun Xi was also furious.</p><p>using his life to exchange for the lives of the three of us. It’s worth it. Charge Now!</p><p>Yun Kai shouted, his eyes flashing with a cold light.</p><p>Yun que fought with all his might and attracted a group of strange beasts. Naturally, there was an opening, and Yun Kai quickly rushed out from that opening.</p><p>“Ah, Yunkai, you’ll die a horrible death!”</p><p>Yun que roared madly.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>His arm had been torn off by a strange beast.</p><p>“Hold on!”</p><p>Yun Xi called out, and with all her might, she charged towards Yun que, sweeping away a strange beast and saving Yun que by a hair’s breadth.</p><p>Hmph, how foolish. If you don’t rush out with such a good opportunity, then you can all die!</p><p>Yun Kai sneered in his heart.</p><p>“Don’t let him get away!”</p><p>A mutated beast spoke the human language. Immediately, a few powerful mutated beasts, including two beasts at the second stage of half-Saint, chased after Yun Kai.</p><p>Yun Kai’s expression changed as he pushed his movement technique to the extreme and flew at top speed.</p><p>In the next moment, his expression changed because he saw a person in front of him.</p><p>This person was naturally Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s you. You’ve come at the right time. Come and help us fend off the exotic beasts!”</p><p>Yun Kai shouted coldly. A cold glint flashed in his eyes as he flew towards Lu Ming at top speed.</p><p>It was obvious that he wanted to drag Lu Ming into the water to help him fend off the ultra Beasts so that he could escape. He had sinister intentions.</p><p>There was a faint smile on Lu Ming’s face. He was motionless.</p><p>Yun Kai’s face turned ferocious as he charged at Lu Ming at top speed.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>This voice contained the power of the godly sword technique. Yun Kai let out a blood-curdling screech and his body stopped in the air.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and passed Yun Kai, appearing at Yun Xi and the rest.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted again. The divine sword technique was blasted out along with the power of the sound waves, bombarding the exotic beasts.</p><p>Plop! Plop!</p><p>A large group of mutated beasts fell to the ground, their lives completely extinguished.</p><p>Lu Ming’s shout had destroyed the souls of those exotic beasts, including a few of the beasts at the second stage of the half-Saint realm.</p><p>Yun Xi and the other two were dumbfounded.</p><p>To them, the ultra Beasts that could take their lives had been killed by Lu Ming’s shout. It was like a dream.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming clenched his fist in the air and formed three essential core ribbons. They wrapped around Yun Xi and the other two and retreated rapidly.</p><p>The strange beasts looked at Lu Ming in fear and did not dare to pursue him.</p><p>“Ah, save me, save me!”</p><p>At that moment, Yun Kai let out a heart-wrenching cry.</p><p>Lu Ming’s shout at Yun Kai just now did not kill him. In fact, it did not even injure him. It only caused him to feel pain and stop in his tracks. Now, he was surrounded by those exotic beasts.</p><p>How could he be a match for those exotic beasts by himself? a few more wounds instantly appeared on his body.</p><p>Lu Ming, Yun Xi, and the rest looked on coldly.</p><p>When the strange beasts that had surrounded Yun Xi and the others saw this scene, they immediately roared and rushed towards Yun Kai.</p><p>Yun Kai felt even more despair as he roared, ” “Lu Ming, save me, save me. I’m a disciple of the cloud Emperor mountain. You can’t just leave me in the lurch!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head. Yun Kai was really stupid to threaten him with the Cloud King Mountain at this time.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>One of Yun Kai’s legs was torn off by a strange beast. He let out a shrill cry and cried out, ” “Lu Ming, Yunxi, I was wrong. I was wrong. Save me, save me …”</p><p>However, the next moment, a strange beast at the second stage of the half-Saint realm bit off his head, and Yun Kai died unwillingly.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>Those strange beasts cast a grave look at Lu Ming, then ran away, not daring to make a move.</p><p>“Yunkai, you really deserve to die!”</p><p>Yun que said hatefully.</p><p>Previously, in order to survive, Yun Kai had actually plotted against him and used his life to block the attack. They did not have the slightest bit of sympathy for him.</p><p>“He indeed deserved to die!”</p><p>Yun Xi said coldly. She then looked at Lu Ming and cupped her fists.”Lu Ming, thank you for saving me!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
