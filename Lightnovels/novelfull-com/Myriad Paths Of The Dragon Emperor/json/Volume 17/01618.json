He had achieved a major breakthrough. As long as he found a place to cultivate in seclusion for a month, he would be able to break through to the third stage of the half-Saint realm.</p><p>The premise was that he had to survive.</p><p>...</p><p>block it! I must block it! As long as I can hold on for a little longer, Zhao Kuang and Sima Liang will be able to break through the tight encirclement. I won’t die. As long as I break through the third stage of the half-Saint realm, the laws will be activated and my strength will skyrocket. At that time, it will be their time of death!</p><p>Wan Tiancheng roared in his heart. The 14 Saint weapons glowed as if they had fused together, forming a powerful defense.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The chaos sky-turning stamp at its full power pressed down and bombarded Wan Tiancheng’s defense. The rocks under Wan Tiancheng’s feet directly exploded, and the ground cracked, leaving a huge pit.</p><p>As for the Saint weapons around Wan Tiancheng’s body, one by one, they were blown away. In the end, only a few were left floating around him.</p><p>Wan Tiancheng’s face turned pale and he vomited blood.</p><p>At this time, the Tai Chi formation plate above the second body’s head glowed and another Tai Chi pattern floated. This time, the Tai Chi pattern suddenly changed. The Yin Yang fish actually split apart and turned into two swords, one black and one white. The two Yin Yang fish swords emitted a terrifying wave and slashed towards Wan Tiancheng.</p><p>The two Yin Yang fish swords were extremely powerful. Wan Tiancheng’s eyes revealed a look of despair.</p><p>He tried to use his remaining power to control the remaining Saint weapons around him to block, but they were all knocked away by the Yin Yang fish sword.</p><p>The Yin Yang fish sword continued to slash towards Wan Tiancheng.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Wan Tiancheng shouted in despair.</p><p>He had just achieved a major breakthrough. After a while, he would be able to break through the law tank. At that time, he would be the king of the hundred clan battlefield. He would not even fear a Saint.</p><p>But now, he was in a desperate situation. How unwilling was he?</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>The Yin Yang fish sword slashed across. One of them chopped off Wan Tiancheng’s head, while the other pierced through his dantian, destroying his spirit.</p><p>Wan Tiancheng, dead!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, a loud explosion was heard. Huang Ling’s immortal cage was broken. She was forced to retreat. Her face was pale and there was blood at the corner of her mouth.</p><p>It was obvious that Huang Ling had paid a huge price to trap Zhao Kuang and Sima Liang.</p><p>Zhao Kuang and Sima Liang rushed out of the flame cage. However, they retreated at the same time and looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually killed Wan Tiancheng.</p><p>How could a Lv 9 martial Royal realm expert kill Wan Tiancheng, a peerless heaven’s favorite who had entered the second stage of the half-Saint realm?</p><p>This had far exceeded Zhao Kuang and Sima Liang’s expectations.</p><p>The two of them looked extremely solemn. Since Lu Ming could kill Wan Tiancheng, it meant that he could kill the two of them.</p><p>At the side, Huang Ling’s gaze at Lu Ming was also filled with shock and complicated feelings.</p><p>Previously, when Lu Ming said that he wanted to kill Wan Tiancheng, she was completely skeptical. She was taking a gamble. If they could not kill Wan Tiancheng, they could only break out of the encirclement with all their might.</p><p>He did not expect that Lu Ming could really kill Wan Tiancheng. Furthermore, it happened within a few minutes.</p><p>“Now, it’s your turn!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold eyes looked at Zhao Kuang and Sima Liang.</p><p>The two of them had a drastic change in expression.</p><p>“Let’s go, we’ll leave this place first!”</p><p>Sima Liang shouted in anger as he rushed out of the valley. Zhao Kuang followed after him.</p><p>Although they were unwilling, they had no choice but to give up. Now, there were only the two of them left, and so were Lu Ming and Huang Ling.</p><p>Although Huang Ling was injured, it would be easy for her to stop one of them. Since Lu Ming was dealing with the other person, they would be in danger. In such a situation, they could only escape.</p><p>Only Huang Ling and Lu Ming were left in the valley.</p><p>Huang Ling looked at Lu Ming warily and said, ” “Lu Ming, your combat strength is really amazing. You can even kill Wan Tiancheng. You won’t attack me, will you?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was too shocking. She could not help but overthink.</p><p>If Lu Ming attacked and killed her, he would be able to control the map and key of the tomb of the Samsara King.</p><p>Although her undying celestial phoenix body had a strong vitality, she could not tell if Lu Ming had any more trump cards.</p><p>“What do you think?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Huang Ling with a half-smile, causing her expression to change slightly. She could not help but take a step back.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily. don’t worry. You didn’t attack me before I made a breakthrough. Why would I attack you now? I’m not that kind of person. You’re injured. You should recuperate first. I need to recover too!</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged at the side after he finished speaking. He took out a large pile of raw gemstones and began to devour them to recover.</p><p>It was undeniable that Wan Tiancheng was indeed powerful and extremely difficult to kill. Just now, in order to kill Wan Tiancheng, Lu Ming had already used all his trump cards. His main body and secondary body cooperated with each other, and with the help of bubbles, he was able to kill Wan Tiancheng.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming had consumed a lot of his essential core in this battle. He had less than half of it left.</p><p>Ming Lian’s secondary body kept Wan Tiancheng’s Saint weapon and storage ring. Then, he took a step forward and entered his main body, disappearing.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming was recovering at the side, Huang Ling secretly heaved a sigh of relief. She patted her chest and then sat down cross-legged as well. Her body was filled with the undying flames as she began to heal.</p><p>About half an hour later, the two of them got up at the same time.</p><p>“Let’s leave this place first!”</p><p>yes, ” Lu Ming said. He then headed out with Huang Ling following closely behind him.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>When Lu Ming and the rest arrived at the land of white bones, a half-Saint demonic creature roared and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>“The nine seals of the gate of God!”</p><p>Lu Ming moved his hands and eight sealing gates appeared, sealing the half-Saint demonic creature.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming moved his body and grabbed the demonic evil crystal of the half-Saint demonic creature with one claw.</p><p>Now, such an ordinary first stage half-Saint demonic creature was no match for Lu Ming at all. Lu Ming could kill it at will.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>Then, two more half-Saint demons pounced at him. One of them had reached the second stage of the half-Saint realm, the stage of comprehending the laws of nature.</p><p>Lu Ming called bubbles to help and trapped the other party with the space-time domain. He then easily obtained the demonic fiend crystals.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A deafening roar was heard. A huge demonic creature, emitting a terrifying aura, pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>A vast saintly might hit him in the face. It was a Saint-level demonic creature!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. A Saint-level demonic creature was definitely not something he could defeat now. Even if he joined forces with his second body and bubbles, they would not be a match for the Saint-level demonic creature.</p><p>Behind him, the prison-suppressing stele appeared and expanded rapidly.</p><p>The Saint demonic creature roared in fear and turned to run.</p><p>However, the other half-Saint demons also ran away and disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming was rather speechless.</p><p>After using the prison-suppressing stele, not only did the Saint demonic creature run away, but even the half-Saint demonic creature also ran away.</p><p>However, if he put away the prison-suppressing stele, the Saint demonic creature would come again, which would ruin his plan of hunting for some half-Saint demonic fiend crystals.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
