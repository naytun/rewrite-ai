Neither of them could do anything to the other, so they could only wait.</p><p>After a while, the light screen around the fighting ring disappeared. The two young men jumped down from the fighting ring and disappeared.</p><p>...</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A young man in a red robe jumped onto the fighting ring. He did not hide his aura at all.</p><p>Middle Lv 9 martial Royal realm!</p><p>“Who wants to fight me?”</p><p>The red-robed young man said as he looked around.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>A voice was heard as a young man leaped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>The man’s aura was at the early stage of the LV 9 martial Royal realm.</p><p>On the Asura arena, those with cultivation much higher than their opponents wouldn’t challenge them, because there was no meaning in tempering themselves.</p><p>These people came here to find the strong and train themselves. What’s the point of challenging a weakling?</p><p>Unless they had enmity with each other, they could go up and kill the enemy.</p><p>you’re not my match at the early stage of Lv 9 martial Royal realm!</p><p>The red-robed youth said coldly.</p><p>“Not necessarily!”</p><p>The young man at the early Lv 9 martial Royal realm had a strong desire to fight in his eyes.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the light screen on the fighting ring rose again.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The young man at the early Lv 9 martial Royal realm took the lead in attacking. A long spear appeared in his hand, and he thrust it at the red-robed young man like lightning.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A fire domain spread out from the red-robed young man’s body, enveloping his opponent. At the same time, he pounced at his opponent with a flaming saber in his hand, slashing at his opponent.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>With two fierce collisions, the early Lv 9 martial Royal realm youth was forced to retreat with a trace of shock in his eyes.</p><p>He was actually at a complete disadvantage.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The red-robed young man charged forward with his flaming saber, launching a storm of attacks.</p><p>The young man at the early stage of Lv 9 martial Royal realm roared and exerted all his strength to fight the red-robed young man.</p><p>The red-robed young man’s combat strength had exceeded his expectations. He was much stronger than him. He had to give it his all. This battle was also an opportunity for him.</p><p>If he could survive the red-robed young man’s attack for half an hour, he would definitely gain a lot.</p><p>Unfortunately, the red-robed young man was much stronger than him. In just a dozen moves, the flaming saber crushed down and cut the early Lv 9 martial Royal realm young man in half. The terrifying flames turned his body into ashes.</p><p>A powerful heaven’s favorite had been killed just like that.</p><p>As long as one person was killed, the light screen at the edge of the fighting ring would be retracted.</p><p>Without a doubt, these heaven’s favorites were all upper-class earth spiritual bodies. The weaker ones, unless their cultivation was very high, would only be courting death in the hundred clan battlefield.</p><p>Unfortunately, even among the superior earth spiritual bodies, there were strong and weak ones. The red-robed young man’s combat power was very strong.</p><p>The red-robed youth took the storage ring and said coldly, ” “You want to use me as your Whetstone? you’re looking for death!”</p><p>The hundred clan battlefield and the Asura arena were cruel like this. If one wanted to use the other party as a Whetstone to train themselves, it was very likely that they would lose their lives.</p><p>who else wants to come up for a fight? anyone in the ninth level of the martial Royal realm is fine!</p><p>The red-robed young man spoke again, his eyes filled with a strong desire to fight.</p><p>Obviously, the red-robed youth was very confident in himself. He also wanted to find experts to train himself.</p><p>“I’ll fight you!”</p><p>A bald young man leaped onto the fighting ring, his aura spreading out.</p><p>His cultivation was slightly higher than the red-robed young man’s.</p><p>Battle!</p><p>Without any unnecessary words, the two of them started fighting.</p><p>On the fighting ring, the confrontation was extremely intense. The two of them were fighting with all their might, forcing themselves to the extreme.</p><p>Below the battle stage, many young people were watching seriously.</p><p>Watching other people’s battles would sometimes give him inspiration.</p><p>The battle between the two was very intense and lasted for a hundred moves. In the end, the red-robed young man was stronger and killed his opponent with one strike while he was severely injured.</p><p>The red-robed young man seemed to have gained something from the life-and-death battle. He left the fighting ring and disappeared, probably to find a place to cultivate in seclusion.</p><p>Following that, a few more life-and-death battles took place. Some were killed, and some were mutually wounded.</p><p>only in such an environment can I really improve quickly!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered to himself. Then, he took a step forward and appeared on the fighting ring.</p><p>“Who wants to fight me?”</p><p>Lu Ming scanned his surroundings and added, ” it’s best if it’s a half-Saint. Those below the half-Saint realm don’t need to come and die!</p><p>His words silenced the crowd, followed by a burst of discussion.</p><p>this man is so arrogant. He’s only at the early stage of the LV 8 Martial Emperor realm, yet he wants to challenge a half-Saint!</p><p>he even said that anyone below the half-Saint realm would die. He’s too arrogant!</p><p>“I’ll go and meet him!”</p><p>A young man rushed into the fighting ring. His aura was at the peak of Lv 8 martial Royal realm.</p><p>peak Lv 8 martial Royal realm. Why do you have to come here and court death? ”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head slightly, feeling a little disappointed.</p><p>“Arrogant! Let’s see how you’re going to kill me!”</p><p>The young man shouted coldly and stepped forward. His hand was like an eagle’s claw, and he clawed at Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and the terrifying fist force crushed the opponent’s claw. The fist force did not stop and bombarded the opponent’s dantian. The fist force penetrated the opponent’s dantian.</p><p>One punch, killed!</p><p>Lu Ming did not show any mercy. There was no such thing as mercy on the Asura stage. Anyone who stepped onto the Asura stage had to be prepared to be killed.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming had already reminded him.</p><p>I’ve said it before. Those below the half-Saint realm don’t need to come here to die!</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>Below the fighting ring, the other young men’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>A young man at the LV 8 martial Royal realm was able to kill a person at the peak of the LV 8 martial Royal realm with one punch. His combat strength was absolutely amazing.</p><p>this person’s combat strength is indeed shocking. He’ll be a perfect Whetstone for me!</p><p>A strong young man with strong fighting intent in his eyes rushed up to the fighting ring. His terrifying aura spread out. He was at the peak of Lv 9 martial Royal realm.</p><p>“It’s him, Kuang Kong!”</p><p>Kuang Kong’s cultivation is at the peak of the ninth level martial Royal realm, but his combat strength is extremely terrifying. He has killed several geniuses at the peak of the ninth level martial Royal realm in a row. Once, he challenged a first stage half-Saint. Although he was no match for the half-Saint, he survived half an hour of the half-saint’s attack!</p><p>he’s been looking for a strong opponent to challenge recently. He wants to break through his limits, comprehend the ultimate domain, and step into the half-Saint realm!</p><p>The vigorous young man went on stage and caused a wave of discussion.</p><p>However, Lu Ming still shook his head and said,”Another one who’s going to die, why bother?”</p><p>Lu Ming was speaking from the bottom of his heart. He came here to find strong people to train himself. If the weak ones were of no use to him, what was the point? However, his words sounded arrogant to the others.</p><p>Lv 8 martial Royal realm. You’re talking big. Kill!</p><p>Kuang Kong’s figure was like a hurricane as he charged towards Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
