It was all because of Lu Ming.</p><p>How many more secrets were Lu Ming hiding?</p><p>Huang Ling realized that she could not see through Lu Ming at all.</p><p>Lu Ming took out the prison-suppressing stele and the two of them passed through the valley easily. When they were close to the valley, Lu Ming put the prison-suppressing stele away.</p><p>More than half a month had passed and there were still a few people loitering outside the valley. When they saw Huang Ling and Lu Ming, their eyes lit up.</p><p>However, they looked at Huang Ling with a serious expression.</p><p>Obviously, Zhao Kuang and Sima Liang had said something after they came out. These people should know that Huang Ling and Lu Ming had obtained the map and key to the tomb of the Samsara King.</p><p>“Get lost, or die!”</p><p>kill! Huang Ling shouted coldly, her body exuding a cold killing intent.</p><p>Those people’s expressions changed drastically, and then they turned around and left.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and flew towards the exit with Feng Ling at top speed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m really curious. Which Emperor-level force are you from?”</p><p>Flying in the air, Huang Ling asked curiously.</p><p>“I’m not from an Emperor-ranked power!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Not from an Emperor-ranked power? How is that possible?”</p><p>Huang Ling was extremely shocked.</p><p>He wasn’t from an Emperor-ranked power, yet he had such battle prowess. How was this possible?</p><p>Huang Ling initially thought that Lu Ming was a genius disciple from some old sect!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and did not explain further.</p><p>Soon, the two of them arrived at the crack and flew out of it. Not long after, the two of them arrived at the top of a mountain.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what do you think of the map? Let’s see where the tomb of the reincarnation King is. We can go there now!”</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and took out the Jade card. He sank his spiritual senses into it and his expression changed after a quick scan.</p><p>“How is it?”</p><p>Seeing the change in Lu Ming’s expression, Huang Ling quickly asked.</p><p>“I’m afraid we can’t find the tomb of the reincarnation King!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“I can’t find him. What’s going on? Could this map be fake?”</p><p>They had spent so much effort to get the map and key to the tomb of the reincarnation King. If it was fake, it would be a huge blow to them.</p><p>“Fake might not be fake, see for yourself!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. Then, he channeled his vital essence into the Jade card and a picture appeared in the air.</p><p>There were mountains and lakes in the pattern. It was obviously a map.</p><p>However, this map was incomplete. It was easy to tell that this was a corner of a complete map.</p><p>“Why is there only one corner?”</p><p>Huang Ling’s expression turned ugly.</p><p>“Take a look at your key, is there anything unusual?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Huang Ling quickly took out the key and examined it carefully. Indeed, they found a number on the key, three!</p><p>“Three? This must be a number. It seems that the key and the map of the tomb of the reincarnation King are not a set, but divided into several parts. Only by getting all these parts can we find the tomb of the reincarnation King and open it!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>It was obvious that the map they had obtained was incomplete, and there was no way that there was only one key.</p><p>“What a pity!”</p><p>Huang Ling sighed.</p><p>Only a part of it was useless. Where were they supposed to find the rest?</p><p>I have a question. How did you know that the map and key of the tomb of the reincarnation King were nearby? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>when I was traveling, I was ambushed by the natives, but they were killed by me instead. I learned about it from the natives who ambushed me!</p><p>Huang Ling explained.</p><p>“A native?”</p><p>“It’s obvious that Zhao Kuang, Sima Liang, Wan Tiancheng, and the others have also received the news. That’s why they’re here!” Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>“Most likely so!”</p><p>Huang Ling nodded.</p><p>if that’s the case, more people might know about it. So I guess that there might be other maps and keys in other places. I’m afraid we have to cooperate with those who have the maps and keys to open the tomb of the reincarnation King!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment and said.</p><p>it’s very likely. It’s said that when the thousand kill Martial Emperor obtained the tomb of the Slayer Emperor, there were many keys to open it. It’s most likely the same this time!</p><p>Huang Ling’s eyes lit up. She then looked at Lu Ming and said,”Lu Ming, let’s go to Darkwater city. Perhaps we can get some information there!”</p><p>dark water city? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>I don’t think you’ve entered the depths of the hundred clan battlefield yet. The natives have built four huge cities in the depths of the battlefield. Darkwater city is one of them. It can be said to be one of the largest cities in the hundred clan battlefield. Almost all of the strongest heaven’s favorites from the major forces have gathered near these four cities!</p><p>he must be quite powerful to have the map and key to the tomb of the Samsara King. Therefore, we might be able to get some useful information from the dark water city!</p><p>Huang Ling explained.</p><p>the gathering place of the most powerful heaven’s favorites. Alright, let’s go to dark water city!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he agreed readily.</p><p>With his current cultivation, there was no longer any value in training in the periphery of the hundred clan battlefield. He could only encounter stronger opponents in the depths of the hundred clan battlefield.</p><p>After their discussion, the two of them flew toward the depths of the hundred clan battlefield.</p><p>Along the way, they met some Young heaven’s favorites. However, when Huang Ling’s aura was released, the heaven’s favorites ‘expressions changed. None of them dared to challenge them.</p><p>The two of them hurried on at full speed. Their speed was astonishing, and in just two days, a huge city appeared in front of them.</p><p>From a distance, this city was vast and majestic, like a giant beast crouching in front of it.</p><p>This was the Darkwater city!</p><p>In front of the gate of Darkwater city, there was a huge Lake. The strange thing was that the water in the lake was dark and looked pitch black.</p><p>There were many figures standing in the air above the lake.</p><p>At a glance, all of them were young people, both men and women, but all of them had powerful auras.</p><p>Half-Saint? Lu Ming glanced over. Most of these young people were half-Saints. Some of them even exuded a faint power of law. They were obviously in the second stage of half-Saint.</p><p>Only a few of them were below the half-Saint level.</p><p>“So many experts. As expected of one of the four largest cities in the depths of the hundred clan battlefield!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>At a glance, they were all half-Saints and all geniuses. It was a magnificent sight.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>On the surface of the lake, there were continuous rumbles. The two figures were fighting fiercely. The lake water rolled under the terrifying force, causing thousands of waves.</p><p>A red figure and a blue figure were surrounded by laws. The power of the laws kept clashing.</p><p>They were two experts at the second stage of the semi-sage realm.</p><p>The others were all watching the battle between the two.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming had some doubts.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
