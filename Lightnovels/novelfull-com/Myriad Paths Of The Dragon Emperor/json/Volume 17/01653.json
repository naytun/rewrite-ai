The next step would be to reach the third stage of the half-Saint realm. At that time, he could start to break through to the Saint realm.</p><p>The breakthrough of the inscription refined secondary body had undoubtedly made Lu Ming’s strength increase greatly. However, this was not enough. Lu Ming’s main body had yet to break through.</p><p>Next, he continued to cultivate the inscription secondary body and familiarized himself with the use of the array Dao laws.</p><p>Time flew by, and days went by.</p><p>Many people had made breakthroughs during this period of time.</p><p>Many heaven’s favorites with superior earth spiritual bodies who used to be at the first stage of the half-Saint realm had broken through a level and entered the second stage of the half-Saint realm. Many of those who were originally at the second stage of the half-Saint realm had entered the third stage of the half-Saint realm.</p><p>Most importantly, Xia ding and the other heaven spiritual body prodigies, who were originally in the second stage of the half-Saint realm, had also broken through and reached the third stage of the half-Saint realm, the realm where the laws could be infused into the body.</p><p>In this way, their combat strength increased greatly and they were no weaker than Huang Ling, ye Dongfang, and the others.</p><p>Ye Dongfang and the others were already in the third stage of the half-Saint realm. They had reached the limit of the half-Saint realm during this period of time. If they were outside the hundred tribe battlefield, they could have made a breakthrough to the Saint realm.</p><p>All in all, their strength had increased by a large margin.</p><p>They were waiting for Lu Ming to come out of seclusion. As long as Lu Ming came out of seclusion, they would be able to rush out together.</p><p>About a month after his second body’s breakthrough, bubbles had also broken through. Her spacetime domain had transformed into spacetime law.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had asked Huang Ling and the others about the ten strongest laws in the world.</p><p>The law of chaos was known as the Emperor of the myriad laws, so it was naturally one of the ten strongest laws.</p><p>The law of reincarnation was also one of the ten strongest laws in the world.</p><p>&Nbsp; the spacetime law controlled time and space, and was also one of the ten strongest laws.</p><p>Therefore, it was extremely difficult to cultivate the space-time laws. Even bubbles, who was born with the ability to control space-time and had the space-time spinel given by the Titan longhorn beetle, had taken a long time to successfully cultivate it, comprehend the space-time laws, and enter the second stage of the half-Saint realm.</p><p>At this stage, bubble’s combat power had undergone a qualitative change and reached a terrifying level.</p><p>Lu Ming was still cultivating under the path-understanding ancient tree.</p><p>The step from the chaos Domain to the chaos laws was extremely difficult to cross.</p><p>Back then, the reincarnation Emperor had given Lu Ming a wisp of true Qi of chaos. After Lu Ming refined it, not only did it greatly strengthen his spirit body, but it also allowed him to truly experience chaos. It would be of great help to his comprehension of the Laws of Chaos.</p><p>However, even so, Lu Ming had not broken through after such a long time.</p><p>A month after bubbles ‘breakthrough, half a year after they entered the tomb of the reincarnation King.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The chaos Domain that surrounded his body finally changed.</p><p>The thick Chaos Domain disappeared without a trace. At that moment, Lu Ming had an epiphany.</p><p>He opened his eyes and a smile appeared on his face.</p><p>With a single thought, an invisible fluctuation spread between heaven and earth. Then, a wisp of chaotic air current swirled around Lu Ming’s fingers.</p><p>“The Laws of Chaos!”</p><p>A strange light flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes, as if the air of chaos was flowing.</p><p>After half a year of hard work, Lu Ming had finally mastered the chaos laws and entered the second stage of the half-Saint realm. His strength had skyrocketed.</p><p>Lu Ming did not know how powerful the Laws of Chaos were.</p><p>“Time to go out!”</p><p>Lu Ming stood up and took a step forward, appearing outside the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>After stepping over the bridge of helplessness, he realized that many people were gathered in a circle, as if they were paying attention to something.</p><p>Lu Ming walked over to ye Dongfang.</p><p>“Brother Lu, you’ve broken through?”</p><p>Ye Dongfang’s eyes lit up when he sensed Lu Ming’s aura.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was already extremely shocking. If he were to break through, he would be even more terrifying. They would be more confident in charging out.</p><p>“Yes, I broke through by luck!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Bzzzz …</p><p>The cry of a Phoenix rang out.</p><p>“Phoenix spirit!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>It turned out that there was a ball of fire burning where everyone was watching. A Phoenix was flying in the fire, but Huang Ling was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>it seems like Huang Ling is going to be reborn. Once she succeeds, I’m afraid I’ll no longer be her match!</p><p>Ye Dongfang sighed.</p><p>“Phoenix’s Nirvana?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>that’s right. The bloodline that Huang Ling awakened in the past was the undying celestial Phoenix, one of the top ten war beasts. It’s no small matter. After she cultivated into a spiritual body, she started with a low-tier earth spiritual body. However, the undying celestial phoenix body has a special characteristic. She can continuously be reborn. Every time she reincarnated, her spiritual body will rise by a level. It’s extremely shocking. After this successful rebirth, her spiritual body will probably reach the stage of a medium-tier earth spiritual body!</p><p>Ye Dongfang explained, his eyes filled with envy.</p><p>“This is very similar to my nine Dragon bloodline!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>When the bloodline of the nine Dragons first condensed a spiritual body, it was also a low-grade earthly spiritual body. It needed to swallow the spiritual essence of the refined true dragon to be able to advance.</p><p>However, the undying Heavenly Phoenix body could achieve evolution through Nirvana rebirth.</p><p>Perhaps, those who had awakened the bloodlines of the top ten Battle Beasts were not simple!</p><p>In addition, in the endless years between heaven and earth, there were some who could stand shoulder to shoulder with the top ten beasts, or even surpass them. Once that bloodline was awakened, it would be extremely terrifying.</p><p>It seemed that there were spirit bodies that could evolve continuously like the Dragon God combat body.</p><p>After all, a spirit body was not a bloodline.</p><p>The bloodline was innate. Once it was awakened, it could be improved greatly. However, the level of the bloodline could be improved through Nirvana pills.</p><p>As for the spirit body, it was cultivated from the bloodline and not innate. It was likely that the restrictions were not that great, so it was normal for it to be able to evolve.</p><p>The flame became more and more intense, and the Phoenix cried out and danced around. However, a day later, the flame seemed to have reached its limit and quickly retracted, revealing Huang Ling’s figure.</p><p>Although Huang Ling’s cultivation was still at the third stage of the half-Saint realm, the pressure she gave off was much stronger than before.</p><p>Even Lu Ming felt a trace of pressure. The Phoenix Spirit’s spiritual body had successfully evolved and had reached the medium grade heavenly spiritual body.</p><p>Hu …</p><p>The flame was put away and Huang Ling stood up.</p><p>“Huang Ling, congratulations!”</p><p>congratulations!</p><p>Ye Dongfang, Xia ding, and the others all congratulated Feng Ling.</p><p>Their eyes were filled with envy, but they were not discouraged.</p><p>The higher the level of the spirit body, the more powerful the spirit body was. However, the spirit body’s future achievements might not necessarily be stronger.</p><p>They also had the heavenly spiritual body and had the potential to break through to the Imperial realm. In the future, when they cultivated to the Martial Emperor realm, it would be hard to say who would have higher achievements.</p><p>Although the grade of a spirit body represented one’s talent, there had been people in history who had reached the peak with their low-class heaven spirit body.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
