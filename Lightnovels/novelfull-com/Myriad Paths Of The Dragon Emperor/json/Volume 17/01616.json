The Dao of inscription didn’t require the comprehension of intent or even a domain. Inscriptions could actually be regarded as a simplified version of laws.</p><p>Inscriptions could connect directly with heaven and earth, borrowing the energy of heaven and earth. Therefore, after training to the peak of the ninth rank, one could directly communicate with the laws and comprehend them.</p><p>...</p><p>However, after reaching the Saint realm, there was basically no difference between the inscription Dao and the martial Dao.</p><p>After all, all laws and DAOs returned to their origin. No matter what Dao it was, it was the same in the end.</p><p>When one reached the Saint realm, the way of inscription also condensed the Saint heart, transformed spiritual power into Saint power, and controlled the laws, which was the same as martial arts.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming revealed a smile and looked at Huang Ling.”Now, let’s go!”</p><p>“Are you confident? If you don’t have a way, we’ll rush out directly at the end and don’t put ourselves in danger!”</p><p>Said Huang Ling, still a little worried.</p><p>Lu Ming’s plan was to kill Wan Tiancheng. Although Lu Ming had broken through to the ninth level Martial Emperor realm, could he really succeed?</p><p>“Don’t worry. Even if they can’t kill us, they can’t do anything to us!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled, looking very confident.</p><p>He then stood up and walked towards the puppet formation. “Follow my steps!”</p><p>With that, Lu Ming stepped into the puppet formation. More than a dozen puppets immediately launched attacks at Lu Ming, but their attacks all missed.</p><p>Then, he took another step forward. Huang Ling followed closely behind Lu Ming and stepped on the spot where Lu Ming had just stepped on.</p><p>Just like that, Huang Ling followed Lu Ming’s footsteps and stepped on the weak point of the formation. They passed through the puppet formation easily and the two of them stepped out of the cave entrance one after another.</p><p>“They’re out!”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming and Huang Ling stepped out of the cave, they heard a cold shout. Then, three terrifying auras burst out and locked onto Lu Ming and Huang Ling.</p><p>Especially Wan Tiancheng, whose body was bursting with cold killing intent.</p><p>you’re finally out. Huang Ling, I’ve given you a chance before, but you didn’t know how to cherish it!</p><p>Wan Tiancheng said indifferently.</p><p>“Enough nonsense. Wan Tiancheng, didn’t you want to kill me? Let’s fight!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted as his aura burst forth. He took a step forward and the earth rumbled. Twelve light spots appeared on his body and twelve Saint weapons floated in the air. Each of them was shining with a brilliant light and their battle weapon Qi soared into the sky. Lu Ming held the Black Dragon Spear in his hand and thrust it at Wan Tiancheng.</p><p>“Twelve Saint weapons? Die!”</p><p>die! Wan Tiancheng roared, and twelve holy weapons appeared on his body. He held a combat sword and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>His eyes were filled with deep jealousy.</p><p>Lu Ming could actually seal 12 holy weapons. One must know that when he sealed the 12 holy weapons, he had already reached the half-Saint level.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The Black Dragon Spear and Wan Tiancheng’s combat sword clashed heavily against each other. The combat weapon Qi kept clashing against each other, causing loud rumbling sounds.</p><p>Lu Ming could feel a surge of terrifying energy continuously charging at the Black Dragon Spear.</p><p>That was the power of the law. Even Lu Ming’s level-nine Chaos Domain seemed to be unable to withstand it.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Black Dragon Spear vibrated and Lu Ming retreated five to six steps back.</p><p>Wan Tiancheng’s eyes turned cold. He did not expect that Lu Ming could actually block his attack. He only took a few steps back and was not injured.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, Huang Ling rushed to the side.</p><p>“Where are you going?”</p><p>“Stay here!”</p><p>Zhao Kuang and Sima Liang both shouted as they chased after Huang Ling.</p><p>Huang Ling, who was flying at high speed, suddenly stopped. Her body was covered in flames. Bathed in the flames of the undying celestial Phoenix, her entire body seemed to have turned into flames.</p><p>The cry of a Phoenix was heard. A huge undying celestial Phoenix, bathed in flames, rushed out of Huang Ling’s body and flew in the air.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Following that, a large area of flames spread out, enveloping Zhao Kuang and Sima Liang, forming a cage of flames.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you have to be quick. I can only hold them off for three minutes at most. Finish this quickly!”</p><p>Huang Ling’s voice rang out from the flames. Then, a loud explosion could be heard from the flames, followed by Zhao Kuang’s beast-like roar.</p><p>“A quick battle? Hahaha, don’t tell me Huang Ling is counting on you to kill me?”</p><p>Wan Tiancheng laughed like he had heard a funny joke.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming didn’t waste any time. He didn’t have much time. He took a step forward and immediately used the divine sword technique. His gaze was like a sword that blasted into Wan Tiancheng’s body and onto the spiritual God.</p><p>However, Wan Tiancheng’s body only trembled slightly before returning to normal. He coldly shouted, ” “A soul attack technique, but it’s useless against me. Is this your trump card? You want to kill me with this? I’ll let you know how naïve you are!”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Wan Tiancheng held the combat sword in his hand, and the sword Qi was like a rainbow. The other eleven combat weapon Qis were added to the combat sword, making the power of the combat sword reach an astonishing level. He slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Spiritual God defensive treasure!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes moved.</p><p>Obviously, Wan Tiancheng had a spiritual God defensive treasure, which was why he could block Lu Ming’s divine sword technique.</p><p>This was normal. It was normal for a heaven’s favorite like Wan Tiancheng to have a spiritual God defensive treasure to protect his soul.</p><p>After all, it was impossible to defend against soul attacks. If one did not have a spiritual God defensive treasure, they would die without even knowing how they died.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted again and cast the divine sword technique.</p><p>Although the other party had a spiritual God defensive treasure, the divine sword technique could still interfere. At the same time, Lu Ming held the Black Dragon Spear in his hand and exploded his true essence to the extreme, charging towards Wan Tiancheng.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them exchanged a few moves in a row, but Lu Ming was still at a disadvantage.</p><p>“Is this your combat power? You still want to kill me? naive!”</p><p>Wan Tiancheng sneered and attacked Lu Ming. His attacks became even more violent, and his sword Qi was wild.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was calm. At this moment, the space between his eyebrows glowed and a Pagoda floated out.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, a strange fluctuation came from the pagoda. A transparent bubble appeared around Wan Tiancheng and enveloped him.</p><p>space-time domain! You have a treasure with the space-time domain!</p><p>break! Wan Tiancheng roared and exploded with all his strength. Laws surrounded his body, breaking apart the restraints of the spacetime domain and wanting to destroy the transparent bubble.</p><p>However, now that bubbles had reached Lv 9 martial Royal realm, as a space-time spiritual mouse and one of the top ten war beasts, her talent was undoubted. Even though she was still young, she was still very terrifying.</p><p>His talent was so strong that it completely surpassed Wan Tiancheng’s low-class heaven spiritual body.</p><p>Thus, even if Paopao’s cultivation was far behind the other party’s, their combat strength would not be too far apart. It was impossible for Wan Tiancheng to break through the transparent bubble in such a short time.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming stepped in the void, holding a spear in one hand and a sword in the other, and charged towards Wan Tiancheng.</p><p>The space-time domain had no effect on Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, ripples appeared in the void, forming terrifying spacetime blades that slashed towards Wan Tiancheng. This was also bubbles’s attack.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
