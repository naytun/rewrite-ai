Otherwise, they wouldn’t have dispersed!</p><p>that should be the case. They’re waiting for the remaining maps and keys!</p><p>The people in the surroundings guessed.</p><p>Lu Ming and Huang Ling also stepped into the air and left. Many people’s eyes fell on Lu Ming with greed in their eyes. Their eyes darted around, and no one knew what they were thinking.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming and Feng Ling returned to the Phoenix Palace.</p><p>“I must continue to improve my strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>With his current combat strength, together with bubbles and Ming Lian, it was more than enough to deal with geniuses like young master of blood prison. However, against geniuses like the tenth golden Crow Prince and ye Dongfang, he was still slightly lacking.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s current cultivation had already reached the peak of the ninth level martial Royal realm. It would be too difficult for him to break through in a short period of time.</p><p>This was because he would be able to comprehend the ultimate domain and enter the first stage of the half-Saint realm if he were to take another step forward.</p><p>It was not easy to break through from the ninth level martial Royal realm to the half-Saint realm.</p><p>In a short period of time, Lu Ming had two ways to improve his combat strength. The first was the chaos sky-turning seal, and the second was to improve his soul power.</p><p>He felt that he would soon be able to break through the chaos sky-turning seal and step into the fifth level.</p><p>As for his soul power, as long as he refined the demonic fiend crystals, he would be able to continuously increase it.</p><p>Although geniuses like the young master of blood prison and Huang Ling all had spiritual God defensive treasures that could defend their souls, their defensive power was only relative.</p><p>If one’s soul power was strong enough, one could still break through the defense and have a major impact on the soul.</p><p>If Lu Ming’s soul force was comparable to a bright Saint or even a great saint, he could break through young master blood prison’s spiritual God defensive treasure and destroy his soul with a shout and a look.</p><p>At the end of the day, it was because Lu Ming’s soul power was not strong enough. His current soul power was only equivalent to that of a second stage half-Saint.</p><p>When Lu Ming’s soul force reached the third stage of the half-Saint realm, even if the other party had a spiritual God defensive treasure, he would still be able to cause a major impact.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming decided not to take on the challenge for the time being. He would stay in the Phoenix Palace and cultivate in peace.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged under the path-understanding ancient tree. His mind was in an ethereal state as he comprehended the chaos sky-turning seal.</p><p>……</p><p>In a Hall of a Palace in dark water city, the young master of blood prison sat on the throne with a cold expression.</p><p>“I must get a map or key to the tomb of the reincarnation King!”</p><p>The young master of blood prison said coldly as he clenched his fists.</p><p>Without the map or key of the tomb of the reincarnation King, he was not even qualified to participate. Only with a map or key of the tomb of the reincarnation King could he be qualified to participate.</p><p>“Young master, do you have any plans?”</p><p>There were a few other young men in the hall. They were all the subordinates of the young master of blood prison. One of them spoke.</p><p>“Seize!”</p><p>Young master of blood prison’s eyes lit up as he said, ” that guy called Lu Ming is only at Lv 9 martial Royal realm. What right does he have to possess a map? that map should belong to me!</p><p>The other people’s faces changed, and one of them said, ” but young master, Lu Ming is hiding in Darkwater city. We can’t make a move there. Moreover, he’s in the Phoenix Palace. The Phoenix Spirit is in the Phoenix Palace. How can we take him away? ”</p><p>I’ll find a way to ask for help to deal with Huang Ling. As long as I can lure her away, Lu Ming will be easy to deal with. He’s only at the ninth level of the martial Royal realm. I can take him down in an instant. As long as I can take him down, I’ll leave Darkwater city quickly. Even the sage realm experts in Darkwater city will be helpless Against Me!</p><p>The young master of blood prison said in a cold voice.</p><p>“Young master is wise!”</p><p>The others quickly flattered him.</p><p>yes. During this period of time, keep a close eye on Phoenix Palace and Lu Ming’s movements. I’ll find a way to find someone to help us distract the Phoenix Spirit. Once I find someone to help us, we can take action!</p><p>The young master of blood prison said.</p><p>Lu Ming had no idea about young master of blood prison’s plot. He was fully focused on cultivating the chaos sky-turning seal.</p><p>Lu Ming had long cultivated the chaos sky-turning seal to the peak of the fourth level. After this period of killing and tempering, it was on the verge of a breakthrough. Therefore, after Lu Ming cultivated it with all his heart for two days, the chaos sky-turning seal naturally broke through and reached the fifth level.</p><p>The cultivation of the chaos sky-turning seal was very difficult. For example, Lu Ming did not take long to cultivate the thundering wind steps and thirteen accumulated power strikes to the sixth level. However, the chaos sky-turning seal had only broken through to the fifth level after cultivating for so long.</p><p>It was difficult to cultivate, but correspondingly, it was more powerful.</p><p>Every time the chaos sky-turning seal broke through a level, its power would skyrocket, especially the last two levels.</p><p>In the mountain and river diagram, Lu Ming stood on the peak of a mountain. His Chaos Domain surged and a chaos sky-turning stamp appeared in his palm, growing larger and larger.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming shook his palm and the chaos sky-turning seal disappeared automatically. Then, another chaos sky-turning seal condensed in Lu Ming’s other palm.</p><p>In the past, Lu Ming had to form hand seals to condense the chaos sky-turning seal. Now, he did not even need to do so. He could condense the chaos sky-turning seal with a single thought.</p><p>This way, it would be more convenient to fight.</p><p>“Now, increase my soul force!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and sat on the ground. He took out a demonic evil crystal and began to refine it.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another five days passed.</p><p>After five days of continuous refining, Lu Ming’s soul force had also made a breakthrough. The strength of his soul force was equivalent to the third stage of the half-Saint realm.</p><p>I’ve been in seclusion for a while. It’s time to go out and see if there’s any news!</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself. The next moment, he exited the mountain and river diagram and sent a message to Huang Ling.</p><p>Not long after, Huang Ling found Lu Ming.</p><p>“Huang Ling, how is it? did anyone come with the key and the map of the tomb of the reincarnation King?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>three days ago, an expert came. He had a map and a key. We are still short of two more!</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>“Oh, it seems that it will be soon!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Lu Ming, the situation in Darkwater city is getting more and more complicated. Many experts have come from other cities. You have to be careful these days!”</p><p>Huang Ling reminded.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He had a premonition that before the tomb of the reincarnation Emperor was opened, there would be a storm. Darkwater city would not be peaceful.</p><p>At this moment, a female disciple of Phoenix Palace came forward and bowed to Feng Ling. “Saintess, young master Tianying of the heavenly Bird Palace has sent someone here. He said that he is hosting a banquet at the drunken immortal restaurant and would like to invite you to have a chat!”</p><p>“Young master Tianying!”</p><p>Huang Ling frowned.</p><p>“Holy maiden, are you going? The people from Tianqin Palace also said that young master Tianying has invited the tenth Prince of the Golden Crow, and now you’re the only one left!”</p><p>The female disciple of Phoenix Palace said.</p><p>yes! Huang Ling pondered for a moment and said, ” go and tell him that I’ll be there in a while!</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The female disciple of Phoenix Palace bowed and retreated.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
