Twelve Saint weapons surrounded his body. There were all kinds of Saint weapons, and among them, there were several defensive ones.</p><p>Every Saint weapon was surrounded by the power of laws.</p><p>...</p><p>Wan Tiancheng used his defensive holy weapon to protect his body. At the same time, he brandished his combat sword and clashed with the blade of time and space, fighting Lu Ming.</p><p>For a time, the two sides fought to a draw.</p><p>Wan Tiancheng was indeed very powerful. He had a low-class heavenly spiritual body and his body was as sharp as a divine weapon. Coupled with the law of ten thousand weapons, he could destroy everything. Even with the help of bubbles, Lu Ming could only fight to a draw with Wan Tiancheng.</p><p>Lu Ming had already broken through to the ninth level of the martial Royal realm. If he was still at the eighth level, he would not be a match for him.</p><p>Lu Ming and bubbles were at a disadvantage in terms of the laws.</p><p>The two of them were only using their domains.</p><p>Domain and laws were two completely different concepts.</p><p>No matter how strong the chaos Domain and the space-time domain were, they were still a little inferior to Wan Tiancheng’s ten thousand soldier law.</p><p>Of course, if Lu Ming advanced further and his ninth-level domain turned into an ultimate domain, his power would increase sharply and it would not be a problem for him to suppress Wan Tiancheng.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two sides continued to collide with each other, and in the blink of an eye, dozens of moves had been exchanged.</p><p>damn it! How can this kid be so strong? ”</p><p>Wan Tiancheng roared in his heart.</p><p>When he first met Lu Ming, Lu Ming’s cultivation was only at the peak of the sixth level Martial Emperor realm. In Wan Tiancheng’s eyes, Lu Ming was an ant that could be easily killed. But now, only a short time had passed, and Lu Ming’s cultivation had soared to the ninth level Martial Emperor realm. The speed of his progress was so fast that even Wan Tiancheng was shocked.</p><p>However, he didn’t care about a Lv 9 martial Royal realm martial artist at all. He could even kill a heaven’s favorite with a low-class heavenly spiritual body with one slap.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had relied on his own combat strength and a treasure that could release the space-time domain to fight him to a draw.</p><p>This made him even more determined to kill Lu Ming. Otherwise, when Lu Ming advanced further and broke through to the half-Saint realm, he would not be a match for him at all.</p><p>“Kill, kill!”</p><p>As Wan Tiancheng roared, two more spots of light lit up on his body.</p><p>Two more holy weapons flew out from the two dots of light.</p><p>There were 14 Saint weapons in total, and when the battle weapon Qi of the 14 Saint weapons were combined, the power was even stronger.</p><p>As expected, Wan Tiancheng was still holding back.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The sword radiance broke through the air and the bubbles ‘space-time domain was forcefully broken by Wan Tiancheng. At the same time, Lu Ming was forced to retreat.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>die! Wan Tiancheng roared, his eyes flashing with a shocking killing intent as he charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Primal Chaos sky-turning seal!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and released the Holy weapon in his hand. A chaos sky-turning seal appeared in his palm.</p><p>Lu Ming held the chaos sky-turning seal and smashed it at Wan Tiancheng.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>An earth-shattering boom was heard. Lu Ming and Wan Tiancheng’s bodies trembled at the same time and they retreated.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>Wan Tiancheng roared in his heart. Lu Ming still had an ultimate move that he had not used. He had already done his best, but he still could not do anything to Lu Ming. This was hard for him to accept.</p><p>“60% of the power of the chaos sky-turning seal is still a little weak!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>Just now, he had used 60% of the chaos sky-turning seal’s power.</p><p>In fact, when Lu Ming cast the ten thousand soldiers art, the power was already very strong. It was very close to the power of the chaos sky-turning seal. After all, Lu Ming had only cultivated the chaos sky-turning seal to the fourth level.</p><p>Lu Ming’s ten thousand soldiers art could not do anything to his opponent. Even if he used 60% of the chaos sky-turning seal’s power, it would not be much stronger. However, Wan Tiancheng was already shocked.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step back and immediately took a step forward. On his palm, another 60% of the power of the chaos sky-turning seal was condensed. The chaos sky-turning seal grew rapidly and pressed down on Wan Tiancheng.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Wan Tiancheng roared. The 14 Saint weapons surrounded him and converged into a terrifying sword Qi. It rushed up and blasted on the chaos sky-turning seal.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The chaos sky-turning seal trembled and then collapsed. The combat weapon Qi of the combat sword in Wan Tiancheng’s hand also dissipated and he took a few steps back.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you can’t do anything to me. When Zhao Kuang and Sima Liang break through the Phoenix Spirit’s barrier, it’ll be the day of your death!”</p><p>Wan Tiancheng roared.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold and he did not say a word. In his palm, another chaos sky-turning seal condensed and blasted towards Wan Tiancheng. Wan Tiancheng resisted with all his might.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s glabella glowed and Ming Lian stepped out. The Tai Chi formation disk floated in the air and a Tai Chi pattern appeared, pressing down on Wan Tiancheng.</p><p>The Tai Chi pattern had a terrible offensive and sealing power. Facing the joint attack of the Tai Chi pattern and the chaos sky-turning seal, Wan Tiancheng was finally no match for them. He was blown back and slid on the ground, leaving a deep gully. He spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“What’s going on? A clone, no, the same person!”</p><p>Looking at the two Lu Mings, Wan Tiancheng was shocked.</p><p>How could the same person have two bodies?</p><p>Without giving him time to think, Lu Ming’s main body and secondary body attacked Wan Tiancheng again.</p><p>Previously, the reason why Lu Ming did not make a move at the beginning was that he wanted to catch Wan Tiancheng off guard and injure him severely.</p><p>“Don’t even think about killing me!”</p><p>Wan Tiancheng roared as fourteen Saint weapons circled around him.</p><p>He already understood that he was not Lu Ming’s match. He started to focus on defense, hoping that he would not make any mistakes.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s attack blasted towards Wan Tiancheng. The fourteen holy weapons around Wan Tiancheng glowed and surrounded him with the power of law, defending him with all his might.</p><p>A terrifying explosion was heard. Wan Tiancheng was sent flying and coughed up blood again, but he was still blocked.</p><p>haha, you can’t kill me. Zhao Kuang and Sima Liang are about to break free. When that happens, you’ll be the one to die!</p><p>Wan Tiancheng laughed like a madman, his face full of malevolence.</p><p>On the other side, the battle between Huang Ling, Zhao Kuang, and Sima Liang was also rumbling non-stop. The immortal cage that Huang Ling had transformed into was not going to last much longer.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes remained calm.</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>The void trembled as bubbles made his move. One after another, spacetime blades slashed towards Wan Tiancheng.</p><p>Clang clang clang!</p><p>The blade of time and space continuously slashed at Wan Tiancheng’s Saint weapon, causing it to shake violently.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the sky trembled, and a chaos sky-turning stamp the size of a mountain condensed. The might that this chaos sky-turning stamp emitted was much more terrifying than the previous one.</p><p>The chaos sky-turning seal with 100% of its power.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This time, Lu Ming used all his strength. The chaos sky-turning seal with 100% of its power pressed down on Wan Tiancheng.</p><p>Wan Tiancheng’s pupils contracted sharply, and a trace of fear flashed through his eyes.</p><p>“Block it! I must block it!”</p><p>die! Wan Tiancheng roared in his heart. The true essence in his body boiled as if it was going to burn. His spirit body shone and laws revolved around him. He squeezed out all the power in his body and burst out.</p><p>At this moment, Wan Tiancheng seemed to have entered another mysterious realm, and his potential was suppressed to the extreme.</p><p>this is the feeling of being invaded by the laws of nature. As long as I don’t die this time, I will be able to break through the third stage of the half-Saint realm in less than a month!</p><p>Wan Tiancheng was overjoyed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
