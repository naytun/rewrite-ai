Someone was fighting.</p><p>One figure after another charged into the sky and looked into the distance.</p><p>Lu Ming also rushed to the sky from his room and watched from a distance.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming saw a young man rushing into the sky in an attempt to escape.</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat as he recognized this young man.</p><p>This man was the heaven’s favorite who had the key and the map of the tomb of the Samsara King. He was also an expert with a heavenly spiritual body and had comprehended the laws.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A large yellow hand suddenly formed and grabbed at the young man.</p><p>The young man used all his strength in an attempt to break the hand. In the end, the yellow hand was broken, but the young man himself was also severely injured and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Give me the map and key to the tomb of the reincarnation King, and I’ll spare your life!”</p><p>A young man in a yellow robe appeared in the sky, and his vast aura suppressed the surroundings.</p><p>“Law tank!”</p><p>Lu Ming could tell at a glance that this yellow-robed young man was a half-Saint with a body of laws. Moreover, he was also a heavenly spiritual body, on the same level as the ten golden Crow princes and ye Dongfang.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>The young man roared and tried to break out of the encirclement. However, the yellow-robed young man’s eyes turned cold. With a wave of his hand, a huge stone sword appeared in the sky and slashed towards the young man.</p><p>There was a huge difference between the second stage and the third stage of the half-Saint realm. The young man was no match for him at all. After a few moves, his body was penetrated by a stone sword, and the spiritual God was almost destroyed.</p><p>don’t kill me! I’ll give you the map and key to the tomb of the reincarnation King!</p><p>In the end, the young man was scared and handed over the map and key to the tomb of the reincarnation King.</p><p>The yellow-robed young man put away the key to the map of the tomb of the reincarnation Emperor and snorted coldly. He stepped into the air and disappeared into the dark water city. Although the young man was unwilling, he had no other choice.</p><p>However, the native Saints still didn’t make a move.</p><p>“The dark water city is going to be in chaos!”</p><p>Many people sighed.</p><p>The paragons of the other three cities had all come to Darkwater city, but the native Saints of Darkwater city did not interfere. Everyone knew that Darkwater city was going to be in chaos.</p><p>Everyone wanted to enter the tomb of the reincarnation Emperor, including the map. There would be a fight for it. The people who controlled the map and the key of the tomb would probably be reshuffled.</p><p>For a time, dark water city was filled with undercurrents.</p><p>Lu Ming and Huang Ling’s expressions turned solemn as well. Their courtyards were very close to each other. Furthermore, they had been in closed-door cultivation and had not gone anywhere.</p><p>They were afraid that once they separated, they would be attacked and the map and key of the tomb of the Samsara King would be taken.</p><p>On the second night, another huge battle happened.</p><p>A heaven’s favorite who had the key to the map of the tomb of the reincarnation King wanted to leave Darkwater city at night and hide in the dark. He would come out after he had collected all the keys.</p><p>However, as soon as he stepped out of the city gate of dark water city, he was besieged by three heaven’s favorites of the same level. In the end, he was seriously injured and had to hand over the map and the key.</p><p>As a result, the atmosphere in Darkwater city became even more solemn.</p><p>Other than the ten golden Crow princes and ye Dongfang, who they were not afraid of, the other people who had the key to the map of the tomb of the Samsara King had already found people to cooperate with.</p><p>Their goal was to increase their strength. Otherwise, if they were taken away, they would have nothing left.</p><p>A few more days passed, but the last set of map keys still did not appear.</p><p>On this day, two figures arrived at the Phoenix Palace.</p><p>Lu Ming and Huang Ling appeared together.</p><p>“Zhao Kuang, Sima Liang, it’s you? Why have you come to my Phoenix Palace?”</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>The two who had just arrived were Zhao Kuang and Sima Liang.</p><p>“Huang Ling, Lu Ming, we’re here to form an alliance with you!”</p><p>Zhao Kuang said.</p><p>there are so many powerful cultivators in the dark water city now. How about we form an alliance and go to the tomb of the Samsara King together? ”</p><p>Sima Liang continued.</p><p>“Oh? An Alliance? Do you have the key and the map to the tomb of the reincarnation King?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>Zhao Kuang and Sima Liang were stunned, ” “Naturally, I don’t …”</p><p>“Since you don’t have it, what right do you have to form an alliance with us? get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands casually.</p><p>These two people had a good idea. How could it be so easy to gain something without anything?</p><p>Zhao Kuang and Sima Liang’s faces instantly darkened.</p><p>“Lu Ming, the other people in Darkwater city who have the map and key to the tomb are all looking for experts to form an alliance with to increase their strength. The two of us are looking for you to cooperate because we think highly of you, but you’re so arrogant!”</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t think that just because you can kill Wan Tiancheng and young master of blood prison, you can be lawless and look down on others. If two or even three people like young master of blood prison join forces, are you still a match for them?”</p><p>Sima Liang said through gritted teeth.</p><p>“Lu Ming already told you to get lost. Why aren’t you getting lost!”</p><p>Huang Ling berated.</p><p>good, good, very good. Then I’ll watch as your key to the map is taken away!</p><p>Zhao Kuang was furious. He unhappily left behind this sentence and left with Sima Liang.</p><p>Lu Ming and Huang Ling looked at each other with a grave look in their eyes. Then, they returned to their rooms and began to cultivate crazily.</p><p>However, it was too difficult for Lu Ming’s main body to improve its strength in a short period of time.</p><p>The chaos sky-turning seal had just broken through, so it was almost impossible to cultivate it to the sixth level in a short time.</p><p>It was the same for his cultivation base.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming was constantly refining the demonic fiend crystals to improve his soul force.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another three days passed.</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He beamed with joy and entered the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Ming Lian sat on a mountain with his legs crossed. The Taiji formation disk floated above his head and scattered down rays of light.</p><p>The Golden mental energy fire in between the clone’s brows was dancing. Suddenly, the mental energy fire expanded and mental energy rings appeared on the clone’s body.</p><p>There were ten light spots on the ninth Golden Spirit ring.</p><p>This meant that he had finally lit up the 10th spirit lamp and reached the realm of perfection.</p><p>This realm was equivalent to the first stage of half-Saint in martial arts. The next step would be to comprehend the laws.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. The improvement of the second body would undoubtedly increase his combat strength. At this critical moment, it would be of great help to him.</p><p>Then, the spirit ring disappeared, and the second body began to consolidate his cultivation.</p><p>Lu Ming took over and left the mountain and river diagram to continue refining the demonic evil crystals.</p><p>However, not long after, Lu Ming suddenly opened his eyes and rushed out of the courtyard.</p><p>That was because a few terrifying auras were pressing down on Phoenix Palace.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
