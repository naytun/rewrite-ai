It chose to attack when Lu Ming and Huang Ling were exhausted after a huge battle with Xia ding and the other four experts.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming and Huang Ling were no longer at their peak.</p><p>...</p><p>put it out, Huang Ling. Even if you have the unperishable flame, I’ll put it out and refine you!</p><p>The Taotie’s voice rang out, and the light beam from its mouth became even stronger.</p><p>Within the beam of light, the cry of a Phoenix could be heard as the unperishable flame of the Phoenix Spirit was being refined.</p><p>“Chaos!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared and exerted all his strength. A huge chaos sky-turning seal was formed and pressed toward the Taotie.</p><p>At the same time, his second body also controlled the Tai Chi disk array with all its might. Two more Yin Yang fish swords appeared and slashed toward the Taotie.</p><p>Two beams of light shot out from the Taotie’s eyes again, bombarding the Yin Yang fish sword and blocking it. However, he couldn’t block the primal Chaos sky-turning stamp and it smashed heavily on the Taotie’s body.</p><p>The Taotie gave a muffled groan as its body trembled. It actually managed to resist the chaos sky-turning seal. However, it was obvious that the Taotie was not in a good state either. A part of its back had caved in, and that part of its spine had been broken by the chaos sky-turning seal.</p><p>Two streams of blood gushed out of the two wounds caused by the Yin Yang fish sword.</p><p>roar! Damn it! You should die, brat! When I refine the Phoenix Spirit, it will be the day of your death!</p><p>The Taotie let out an angry roar.</p><p>Today, he had been injured by Lu Ming time and time again. Although it was not a fatal injury, it was a great insult to him.</p><p>He was a dignified existence at the third stage of the half-Saint realm. Yet, he had been injured by Lu Ming time and time again. He could not be forgiven.</p><p>this Taotie’s physical body is really abnormal!</p><p>Lu Ming felt a little helpless.</p><p>If an expert at the second stage of the half-Saint realm were to be hit by Lu Ming’s chaos sky-turning seal, he would probably be crushed to death.</p><p>However, Tao tie only suffered minor injuries.</p><p>At this moment, Huang Ling’s unperishable flame was getting weaker and weaker, as if it was going to be refined at any time.</p><p>“What do we do?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s brows furrowed deeply.</p><p>After a series of battles, the vital essence in his body was almost depleted. It was difficult for him to use the chaos sky-turning seal again with all his strength. Even if he did, the chaos sky-turning seal might not be useful.</p><p>Lu Ming started to feel anxious.</p><p>His cultivation was still too low. He was only at the ninth level of the martial Royal realm.</p><p>If his cultivation could reach the first stage of the half-Saint realm and comprehend the ultimate chaotic domain, his power would definitely increase dramatically. At that time, he could at least severely injure the Taotie with the chaos sky-turning stamp.</p><p>However, his current cultivation was only at the peak of the ninth level martial Royal realm. It was impossible for him to rush to the half-Saint realm.</p><p>It was a huge barrier between the ninth level martial Royal realm and the half-Saint realm. It was not easy to break through.</p><p>“Hahaha, Lu Ming and Huang Ling are finally going to be defeated and killed by the Taotie!”</p><p>Not far away, Zhao Kuang laughed maniacally. He was overjoyed to see that Lu Ming and Huang Ling were about to be defeated.</p><p>they can’t be Tao tie’s match. The outcome is already decided! Sima Liang also said coldly.</p><p>Around him, the others also shook their heads and sighed.</p><p>The Taotie was a heaven’s favorite on the same level as the tenth golden Crow Prince. Among the heaven’s favorites who entered the hundred clan battlefield, people at this level stood at the very top.</p><p>It was impossible for Huang Ling and Lu Ming to stand a chance. Moreover, they had just fought a great battle. It was even more impossible for them to be a match for the Taotie.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the cry of a Phoenix resounded through the world.</p><p>Huang Ling, who was already extremely weak, suddenly became more powerful and the unperishable flame started to burn.</p><p>Huang Ling had almost transformed into an undying Phoenix. She spread her wings and flew high, breaking out of the Taotie’s light beam. Her wings were like blades as she slashed at the Taotie.</p><p>The Taotie roared and struck out with its claws.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>With two loud bangs, Phoenix spirit and Taotie retreated.</p><p>“You’ve broken through the nomological tank!”</p><p>The Taotie roared.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The Phoenix Spirit roared as she spread her wings and charged towards Taotie.</p><p>“I’d like to see how powerful the law of unperishable flame is!”</p><p>The Taotie roared and charged towards Huang Ling.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In the sky, it was as if a Phoenix and a Taotie were fighting fiercely. For a moment, it was difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>“He actually broke through!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>At the critical moment of life and death, Huang Ling had broken through her limit and reached the third stage of half-Saint, the stage where laws could be infused into her body.</p><p>After reaching the third stage, the Phoenix Spirit’s combat strength had increased greatly. She was now on the same level as the Tao tie and was not afraid of him.</p><p>“As expected of the undying Heavenly Phoenix body, one of the top ten Battle Beasts!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>He realized that the Phoenix Spirit had the same characteristics as him. In times of danger, it was easier to stimulate one’s potential and break through one’s limits to achieve a leap.</p><p>“Damn it, how did this happen?”</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Zhao Kuang and Sima Liang had been very happy just a moment ago, but now their faces were extremely gloomy.</p><p>The battle between the Phoenix Spirit and the Taotie was extremely intense. Lu Ming did not interfere.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two sides had exchanged hundreds of moves, and there was still no clear winner.</p><p>Huang Ling, I’ll spare you today. We’ll fight another day!</p><p>In the end, Taotie turned around and left after leaving behind some harsh words.</p><p>He knew that now that Huang Ling had broken through, it was impossible for him to snatch Huang Ling’s and Lu Ming’s map key. He could only retreat.</p><p>Huang Ling didn’t pursue him. She wasn’t confident that she could keep Tao tie here. If they continued to fight, both sides would suffer and someone else would benefit from it.</p><p>The unperishable flame was extinguished and the Phoenix Spirit returned to its original form.</p><p>“You guys, get lost!”</p><p>Huang Ling’s gaze swept the surroundings, especially towards Zhao Kuang and Sima Liang.</p><p>Zhao Kuang and Sima Liang’s expressions changed as they turned to leave.</p><p>The others did the same. They turned and left. Now that Huang Ling had broken through and entered the third stage of the half-Saint realm, it would not be too difficult for her to kill Ordinary Geniuses.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the surrounding spectators had all dispersed.</p><p>congratulations on your breakthrough, Emperor spirit!</p><p>Lu Ming walked towards Huang Ling and smiled.</p><p>Huang Ling’s breakthrough had made him feel much more relaxed.</p><p>With Huang Ling’s breakthrough and his performance today, he believed that no one would dare to target them in the future.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I have to thank you. If you hadn’t restrained the Taotie, I might not have had the chance to break through!”</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had continuously attacked the Taotie and injured it. This had distracted the Taotie more or less. Otherwise, it would have refined her before she could break through.</p><p>If one wanted to stimulate one’s potential and break through one’s limits in a crisis, they would often be accompanied by danger. A single mistake could lead to death.</p><p>Then, she ordered the people of the Phoenix Palace to clean up the palace. After all, the battle just now had made the Phoenix Palace a mess.</p><p>Lu Ming and Huang Ling returned to their respective rooms.</p><p>Huang Ling had just made a breakthrough and needed to consolidate her cultivation. As for Lu Ming, he needed to recover.</p><p>After this battle, Lu Ming and Huang Ling’s reputation had spread far and wide. Indeed, no one had any designs on them after that.</p><p>However, the battle in dark water city was even more intense.</p><p>There would often be great battles.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
