Since Yin yinsong was the one who was challenged, he still had to stay in the fighting ring.</p><p>Yin taisong could only lower his head the entire time and stand in the fighting ring in shame.</p><p>...</p><p>The challenges continued. However, given Lu Ming’s combat strength, no one dared to challenge him.</p><p>In reality, no one dared to challenge those who were ranked at the top. Most of the challenges that were carried out later ended in failure.</p><p>Half a day later, the challenge ended and the twenty spots were set.</p><p>In Tian Chui’s cave residence in Cloud Dragon Valley, Longyuan Shan, Lu Ming, Tian Chui, and Xue ningxin sat around a table and drank to their heart’s content.</p><p>ha, ha, ha, it’s so satisfying today. I’m so happy to see the old dog master of Silver Dragon Valley!</p><p>Tian Chui gulped down a few mouthfuls of wine and laughed.</p><p>When she thought of the master of Silver Dragon Valley’s defeated expression, Longyuan mountain and Xue ningxin also revealed a smile.</p><p>“By the way, ninth Junior Brother, what realm have you reached now?”</p><p>Longyuan mountain asked.</p><p>Tian Chui and Xue ningxin also revealed curious expressions.</p><p>Lu Ming did not hide anything. The aura on his body bloomed, and laws surrounded him.</p><p>law! This is the second stage of the half-Saint realm. Amazing, amazing!</p><p>Tian Chui’s eyes widened.</p><p>ninth Junior brother’s talent is extraordinary. I, as his Senior Sister, have been surpassed!</p><p>Xue ningxin said with a smile.</p><p>When they first met Lu Ming, Lu Ming’s cultivation base was far inferior to theirs. Now, he had surpassed them. Lu Ming’s talent was shocking.</p><p>Of course, they were also happy for Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Longyuan mountain’s face didn’t show any happiness as he asked, ” “Ninth Junior Brother, are you confident in facing the Divine Child?”</p><p>As soon as he said this, Tian Chui and Xue ningxin’s faces immediately became serious, revealing a trace of worry.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was powerful, he was only at the second stage of the half-Saint realm. The divine Son had reached the Saint realm a year and a half ago.</p><p>In the Saint realm, one could refine the Saint heart and turn their vital essence into Saint power. They would have a stronger control over the laws and would be much stronger than half-Saints.</p><p>In the second stage of the half-Saint realm, it was too difficult to fight with a Saint. Furthermore, the deity was not an ordinary half-Saint, but a top heaven’s favorite, a monster in the Azure state.</p><p>if the divine son’s cultivation is still at the sage small perfection realm, I have a 50% chance of killing him!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment and said.</p><p>“What? 50% chance of killing him?”</p><p>Longyuan mountain, Tian Chui and Xue ningxin were dumbfounded.</p><p>Although they had hoped that Lu Ming would say that he was confident, they had never expected him to say that he was 50% confident in killing the divine Son.</p><p>Not defeat, but kill!</p><p>Killing was much harder than defeating.</p><p>Lu Ming was actually 50% confident that he could kill the divine Son.</p><p>Longyuan Shan, Tian Chui and Xue ningxin looked at each other. It seemed that they had underestimated this Little Junior Brother.</p><p>“Hahaha, good, then senior brother will wait for Junior Brother to show off his divine might at the treasure fixing assembly and kill him without leaving a single piece of armor!”</p><p>Tian Chui laughed heartily as he picked up the wine jar and took a few more gulps.</p><p>They hadn’t seen each other for more than a year, so they naturally had a lot to talk about. They drank and chatted until late at night before they left.</p><p>Lu Ming spent the rest of the time in closed-door cultivation, focusing on his cultivation.</p><p>The divine Son had broken through to the Saint realm a year and a half ago. It was very difficult to break through after reaching the Saint realm. The resources and time required to break through each realm were far beyond that of the martial Royal realm.</p><p>However, the deity’s talent was very high, and he had also received the full support of the Tian Shen sect. In one and a half years, who knew if the deity had broken through.</p><p>If the divine Son were to make another breakthrough, it would be very difficult for Lu Ming to defeat him.</p><p>Therefore, the only way was to constantly improve his own strength.</p><p>Lu Ming spent the next few days comprehending the chaos laws and cultivating the chaos sky-turning seal.</p><p>He had long cultivated the chaos sky-turning seal to the peak of the fifth level. If he could break through to the sixth level, Lu Ming’s combat strength would increase again.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, more than a month had passed.</p><p>At this time, there was only about a month before the start of the treasure sealing Convention, and it was time to set off for the Cang mountains.</p><p>Tian Chui, Xue ningxin, Lu Ming, and Lu Xiangxiang had come together to broaden their horizons, so Lu Ming had brought Lu Xiangxiang along.</p><p>Before he left, Lu Ming sent a message to su Lei. Back then, Lu Ming had promised to bring su Lei along when he went to the Cang mountains.</p><p>The group of five arrived at the Dragon God Valley.</p><p>“This time, take my space-breaking flying shuttle!”</p><p>Xue ningxin smiled and took out a flying shuttle. It was shining with silver light and was extremely beautiful.</p><p>Lu Ming could tell at a glance that Xue ningxin’s space-breaking flying shuttle was by no means comparable to an ordinary space-breaking flying shuttle.</p><p>The five of them entered the space-breaking flying shuttle, and with a swish, it shot through the sky like a stream of light. Its speed was twice that of an ordinary space-breaking flying shuttle.</p><p>In just seven days, they had arrived near the Cang mountains.</p><p>As they neared the grey Mountain, they got off the flying shuttle and headed towards the mountain.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>As they neared the Cang Mountain, they heard a roar in front of them. Beams of bright light shot up into the sky. Someone was fighting.</p><p>There were still some people watching in the void.</p><p>The five of them approached and found that the two people fighting were at the sixth level martial Royal realm and belonged to two different sects.</p><p>Before the start of each treasure fixing assembly, it was always the stage for those below the sixth level of the martial Royal realm. It was very normal for them to fight with each other.</p><p>The approach of Lu Ming and the group attracted the attention of others. Many pairs of eyes looked at them.</p><p>“That is … Lu Ming?”</p><p>“It’s really him! He has finally appeared! In the past few years, he has barely appeared. More than a year ago, he only appeared once in the heavenly wind Plains, and then disappeared!”</p><p>“I originally thought that in this time’s treasure sealing assembly, he would not appear. I didn’t expect that he would really appear, interesting!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s appearance attracted a lot of discussion.</p><p>“Hehe, Lu Ming, you really dare to show yourself. I thought you would be like a turtle hiding in its shell and not dare to come out!”</p><p>A sneer rang out and spread throughout the entire area.</p><p>A few figures stepped in the air and arrived in front of Lu Ming and the rest. They sneered at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Stone crown!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>The person who spoke just now was Shi Guan of the tianshen sect. In the last treasure settlement ceremony, Lu Ming and the others were chased by Shi Guan as soon as they arrived at the Cang mountains.</p><p>Close to three years had passed, and Shi Guan had undoubtedly become even more powerful. His body was suffused with milky-white holy light, and the power of laws circulated around him.</p><p>The second stage of half-Saint was Shi Guan’s cultivation.</p><p>However, Shi Guan did not have a superior-grade earth spiritual body but a medium-grade earth spiritual body. Lu Ming could kill him with one slap.</p><p>what bad luck! I heard a wild dog barking as soon as I arrived at the Cang Mountain!</p><p>Tian Chui sneered as he laughed.</p><p>“Senior brother is right, and it’s an ugly wild dog!”</p><p>Xue ningxin also called out.</p><p>Tian Chui and Xue ningxin spoke one after another, causing Xiang Xiang to smile. This little girl blinked her eyes and asked curiously,”Martial uncle, martial aunt, so this is what wild dogs look like. It’s the first time Xiang Xiang has seen them.”</p><p>The little girl was innocent and innocent. When she said that, the surrounding people couldn’t help but laugh.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
