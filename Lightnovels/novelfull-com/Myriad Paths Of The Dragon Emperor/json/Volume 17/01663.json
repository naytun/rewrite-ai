What did that mean?</p><p>...</p><p>The young experts from the other three families also looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>What did the SU family mean by this? To let one person walk to the center of the stage while the other five watched from the edge of the fighting ring, what kind of strategy was this?</p><p>Did they want Lu Ming to deal with the three of them alone?</p><p>At this time, the other three family heads also frowned.</p><p>They could not see through Lu Ming’s cultivation. They guessed that Lu Ming had cultivated a wonderful concealment technique. Initially, they thought that no matter how strong Lu Ming’s cultivation was, it would not be that strong. However, it seemed that something was not right now!</p><p>They had a bad feeling in their hearts, especially when they saw the SU family head’s calm expression. They felt that something was wrong.</p><p>“All of you, attack together!”</p><p>Lu Ming stood in the middle of the fighting ring with his hands behind his back.</p><p>“What? You want us to attack together?”</p><p>“This kid is so arrogant!”</p><p>he’s indeed arrogant. There are so many of us here. We’re not even afraid of a half-Saint, so how could he be a half-Saint? ”</p><p>such a young half-Saint can only be found in 13 top sects, and the number is very small. Now that the treasure fixing assembly is about to start, those Masters are all preparing for it. Why would they come to participate in the competition of several small families? ”</p><p>stop pretending! Let’s attack together and blast him off the fighting stage!</p><p>A series of surprised and cold voices rang out. Following that, the experts from the three major families made their move. There were a total of eighteen of them, and they charged towards Lu Ming. All kinds of light gathered together, and it was extremely terrifying.</p><p>With so many experts attacking at the same time, even an existence at the first stage of the half-Saint realm would have to retreat.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure still did not move. He only took a step forward.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>He took a step forward, and the fighting stage shook. Three Nine Dragons roared and rushed out, pouncing on the experts of the three families.</p><p>It was unstoppable, and it charged forward with crushing force.</p><p>The bodies of the 18 young experts from the three families were like 18 balls. They flew backward and spat out blood in the air.</p><p>Bang! Bang! “Bang!”</p><p>The 18 young men fell out of the fighting ring like dumplings, lying on the ground and wailing.</p><p>Silence!</p><p>The square fell into a dead silence.</p><p>It had ended!</p><p>It actually ended like this?</p><p>Lu Ming had only taken one step forward and the competition had ended.</p><p>Many ancient martial art practitioners from Gusu city had rushed over to watch a fierce battle. They did not expect that the rare grand event in Gusu city would end right after it had begun.</p><p>Some people were so distracted that they didn’t even see how it ended.</p><p>“This … This …”</p><p>The patriarchs of the other three families and the other experts were tongue-tied and completely speechless.</p><p>hahaha, you’re too kind. This time, the ancestral land will belong to my su family!</p><p>hahahaha! the head of the SU family laughed heartily. He had been depressed that Su Qin couldn’t enter the ancestral land, but now he felt much better.</p><p>The four great clans of Gusu city were constantly at war with each other. When had he ever seen such an expression on the faces of the clan heads of the other three great clans?</p><p>Su Qin sighed beside the SU family head.</p><p>Su Lei actually got Lu Ming’s help. She felt helpless and sighed in her heart. Su Lei was too lucky.</p><p>I didn’t expect that the SU family would invite such a powerful Young heaven’s favorite. He must be a heaven’s favorite from the 13 top sects. His cultivation must be in the half-Saint realm!</p><p>Hmph, the SU family is lucky this time!</p><p>As for the other clans, they could only watch their mouths.</p><p>Many of the spectators were also helpless. A grand event had ended just like that.</p><p>cut the crap. Now, go and open the ancestral land!</p><p>The head of the SU family said.</p><p>The ancestral land had to be opened by the family heads of the four great clans at the same time. This had been the rule in Gusu city for many years. Although the family heads of the other three great clans were unwilling, they had no choice but to open it.</p><p>They could only place their hopes on the next competition.</p><p>“Su Lei, let’s go!”</p><p>The master of the SU family rose into the air and looked at su Lei. Then, he turned to Lu Ming and said, brother Lu, every time someone enters the ancestral land, there must be a protector. How about you go in with su Lei? ”</p><p>“Sure, no problem!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Lu Ming, su Lei, and the four family patriarchs rose into the air and flew to the North of the square.</p><p>Not far from the North of the square, there was a small palace. Everyone walked into the palace and saw a stone wall. On the stone wall, there were all kinds of strange patterns.</p><p>“Let’s start!”</p><p>The head of the SU family said.</p><p>The other three patriarchs nodded, and the four of them struck out at the same time. They slammed their palms on the stone wall, and their Zhen Yuan crazily surged into it.</p><p>The stone wall emitted a bright light.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The stone wall suddenly split open, and a pitch-black Vortex appeared.</p><p>su Lei, go in. What kind of fortune you can obtain in the ancestral land will depend on your luck.</p><p>The head of the SU family said.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Su Lei nodded and stepped into the vortex with Lu Ming.</p><p>The space turned and in the next moment, Lu Ming found that they were in an open space. The open space was very large, but it was surrounded by a vast expanse of white.</p><p>In front of them, there was a ball of light floating in the air, like a sun.</p><p>“Is that the soul of the ancestor?”</p><p>Su Lei muttered and then knelt down respectfully. Facing the ball of light, she knelt down and kowtowed respectfully.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming stood beside su Lei and looked at the ball of light, deep in thought.</p><p>In the past few days, he had heard su Lei mention the ancestral land.</p><p>Su Lei didn’t know much either. She only knew that every time a member of the four great families entered this place, they would have to kneel down and pay their respects to the ball of light. Then, they would walk into the ball of light and obtain an opportunity.</p><p>From time to time, holy weapons, pills, cultivation manuals, and other treasures would fly out of the ball of light. As for what one could obtain, it all depended on fate.</p><p>Su Lei knelt down and walked towards the light.</p><p>When it reached a certain distance, a beam of light flew down from the ball of light and fell on su Lei’s body. Su Lei’s body trembled slightly as if she was under great pressure, but she gritted her teeth and held on.</p><p>Lu Ming was constantly paying attention to su Lei. If anything happened to su Lei, he would come to her rescue in time.</p><p>There had once been disciples of the four great families who had fallen here because they couldn’t withstand the pressure of the light beam. Therefore, after entering, there would always be someone to follow and protect them.</p><p>Su Lei gritted her teeth. Her delicate little face revealed a stubborn and determined look as she continued to step forward.</p><p>Step by step, su Lei seemed to have difficulty walking. Not long after, her body was drenched in sweat, and her face was covered in fragrant sweat.</p><p>But su Lei didn’t give up. She gritted her teeth and continued to step forward firmly.</p><p>Not long after, su Lei’s petite body trembled more and more violently. Blood even seeped out of her skin.</p><p>Lu Ming did not make a move. He understood that this was a test for su Lei. As long as su Lei could endure it, she would transform.</p><p>As long as su Lei’s life was not in danger, Lu Ming would not take action.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
