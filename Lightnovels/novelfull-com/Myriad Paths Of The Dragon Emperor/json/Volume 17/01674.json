The killing intent in her eyes grew stronger when she found that Lu Ming had killed so many experts.</p><p>“Lu Ming, how dare you kill so many people of my heavenly God sect? What should I be punished for?”</p><p>...</p><p>Luo shuihan said coldly.</p><p>“What should I be punished for? How laughable. Your people from the Tian Shen sect stopped me on the way and tried to snatch my storage ring. Shouldn’t I kill you?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Nonsense! How could the people of my heavenly God sect do such a thing?”</p><p>Luo shuihan shouted, then turned to the rest of the people of the tianshen sect and said, ” is what Lu Ming said true? did you guys try to snatch his storage ring? ”</p><p>“There’s no such thing. Lu Ming is talking nonsense. He was the one who bore a grudge against our deity sect and attacked us for no reason. The brothers from the Yu Du sect can testify to this, right?”</p><p>A burly middle-aged man from the heaven God sect shouted as he looked at the remaining people from the Yu Du sect.</p><p>that’s right. That’s true. Lu Ming is out of his mind. He suddenly attacked us!</p><p>The desire poison sect’s people also shouted.</p><p>This was a complete lie.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what else do you have to say? a life for a life!”</p><p>Luo shuihan said with a cold smile.</p><p>“What do I need to say? Do I still need to say anything to a bunch of shameless people like you? You just want to find a reason to attack, so there’s no need for so much nonsense. Yes, I did it. In the future, if you see anyone from the heavenly God sect, kill them all. Hurry up and attack!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s face was full of disdain as he shouted.</p><p>“Very good, very good, then you can die!”</p><p>Luo shuihan was Holy. Holy light filled the air and turned into a light belt that surrounded her body. She looked extremely Holy.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s combat strength was very strong, he was still not worthy of his attention.</p><p>Luo shuihan did not care about the combat strength of those who were killed by Lu Ming. He had a superior earth spiritual body and his cultivation had reached the peak of the third stage of the half-Saint realm. He was the top of the top ten geniuses of the Azure region.</p><p>He could kill a large number of Warriors at the first and second stage of half-Saint with one slap.</p><p>Around them, the others looked on nervously.</p><p>Many people thought that Lu Ming would not stand a chance and would be killed by Luo shuihan.</p><p>Was Lu Ming going to die in Luo shuihan’s hands before he even started challenging the divine Son?</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Luo shuihan stepped forward, and the Holy Light became more and more intense.</p><p>Luo shuihan, I’ll fight with you!</p><p>At this moment, a voice was heard. Then, a Dragon’s Roar shook the nine Heavens. With a flash of purple light, a purple figure appeared in front of Luo shuihan.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Luo shuihan smacked out a palm. Holy light burst out, laws circulated, and the palm Power was monstrous.</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar came from the purple figure. A purple dragon Claw struck out and collided with Luo shuihan. With a shocking boom, the purple figure and Luo shuihan were both forced back.</p><p>However, Luo shuihan only retreated three steps, while the purple figure retreated four or five steps.</p><p>“Senior brother Zi Feng!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>This figure that suddenly appeared was precisely Zi Feng, one of the Azure state’s ten great demon-level talents.</p><p>Zi Feng, you’re overestimating yourself if you want to stop me. I’ll kill you first, then Lu Ming!</p><p>Luo shuihan let out a long cry and charged towards Zi Feng.</p><p>“I’m not afraid of you!”</p><p>kill! Zi Feng shouted and also charged towards Luo shuihan. The two of them were engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded and helpless.</p><p>He had planned to take advantage of this opportunity to kill Luo shuihan and weaken the strength of the deity sect. In this way, it would be more likely for Dragon God Valley to win first place in the treasure fixing Convention.</p><p>In that case, the fragments of the prison-guarding stele and the other treasure would be under the control of the Dragon God Valley. Lu Ming would have a chance to get the fragments of the prison-guarding stele.</p><p>He was just about to make a move when Zi Feng rushed over, making Lu Ming rather speechless.</p><p>Zi Feng and Luo shuihan were engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>Zi Feng’s cultivation was also at the third stage of the half-Saint realm. He was in the body of the law, and his spiritual body was also a superior earth spiritual body. His combat strength was powerful. Although he was no match for Luo shuihan, it was not so easy for Luo shuihan to defeat Zi Feng.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two of them had exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>“You killed the people of my Tian Shen sect. You must die today!”</p><p>At this moment, an old voice came from afar. It was an old man in a white robe. He stepped on the void and flashed like a white light. He arrived at the scene in an instant. His powerful and vast aura locked onto Lu Ming in an instant.</p><p>A saint’s might filled the air. This was a Saint.</p><p>This battle had attracted the attention of the Saints of the heaven God sect.</p><p>The Saint of the tianshen sect stood high in the sky and looked down. The terrifying saintly might spread out, making many people around feel a strong pressure, and they could not help but retreat.</p><p>Lu Ming is finished. With the Saint making a move, he’s even more dead!</p><p>that’s right. A Saint is stronger than Luo shuihan!</p><p>Many people shouted.</p><p>“Initial bright Saint?”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s mouth curled into a disdainful smile and a sharp glint flashed in his eyes.</p><p>Luo shuihan had been blocked, so killing a Saint was not bad.</p><p>old man, you’re already so old. How dare you attack a junior? do you think that Dragon God Valley has no one? ”</p><p>A loud roar was heard. Then, a tall old man rushed over and stood in front of the tianshen sect Saint. His body also exuded a vast Saint might.</p><p>The Saint realm elder of Dragon God Valley had arrived.</p><p>The elder of the Dragon God Valley exuded a powerful holy aura, blocking the Saints of the tianshen sect and Lu Ming behind him.</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p><p>No way, don’t do this, let me do it!</p><p>Lu Ming roared in his heart. He was really speechless.</p><p>Previously, Luo shuihan had been blocked by Zi Feng. Now, a Saint in the initial bright Saint realm had come and was blocked by the Saint realm elder of Dragon God Valley.</p><p>It had completely disrupted Lu Ming’s plan.</p><p>“Lu Ming, step back. With me around, this old man can’t do anything to you!”</p><p>The Saint realm elder of Dragon God Valley said.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed!</p><p>The surrounding people were also discussing.</p><p>WOWO, Lu Ming is so lucky. There’s an expert in the vicinity of Dragon God Valley. Otherwise, he would be finished!</p><p>that’s right. His luck is too good. However, he won’t be able to go far by relying on luck. He will eventually encounter the heaven’s pride experts of the tianshen sect in the treasure fixing assembly. Even if he doesn’t die in the treasure fixing assembly, he will still die in the battle with the divine Son later on!</p><p>The tianshen sect’s Saint looked at the Dragon God Valley’s Saint with cold eyes.</p><p>However, he did not make a move.</p><p>The Saints of Dragon God Valley were no weaker than him. If they fought, both sides would probably be injured.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>On the other side, Zi Feng and Luo shuihan exchanged a blow, and the two retreated together.</p><p>The difference was that Luo shuihan was calm and composed, while Zi Feng was also gasping for breath, his breath somewhat weak.</p><p>Luo shuihan’s eyes showed a trace of unwillingness.</p><p>It would be very difficult to kill Lu Ming today.</p><p>“Lu Ming, do you only know how to hide behind other people? You can hide for a while, but you can’t hide forever. You have nowhere to hide in the treasure sealing assembly. This time, I will make sure that you Dragon God Valley people can’t return. Starting from the small treasure sealing assembly in ten days, I will let you know the consequences of offending my Tian Shen sect!”</p><p>Luo shuihan said coldly. She glanced at Lu Ming coldly, then turned around and left.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
