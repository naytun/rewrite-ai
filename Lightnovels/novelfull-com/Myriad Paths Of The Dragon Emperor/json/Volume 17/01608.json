It was a holy weapon. As the long spear swept out, the attack swept toward Lu Ming like a storm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming made his move. His attack was still very simple.</p><p>With the primal Chaos Domain and the prison suppression heavenly art, Kuang Kong’s attack crumbled in an instant.</p><p>The fist momentum didn’t stop as it struck towards Kuang Kong.</p><p>Kuang Kong’s expression changed drastically. The power of Lu Ming’s punch was too terrifying. It had far exceeded his expectations.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>He roared as a Green Shield appeared. It was a Saint weapon. At the same time, a gust of wind blew around him, forming several shields around him.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s punch landed on the Saint Weapon Shield, producing a terrifying boom. The Saint Weapon Shield was sent flying and crashed into Kuang Kong. Kuang Kong groaned and was sent flying. He crashed heavily into the light screen at the edge of the fighting ring. The light screen trembled and blocked his body.</p><p>Kuang Kong slid down the light screen and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>Kuang Kong shouted in disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was too terrifying. Even with his cultivation, he could not withstand a single blow. Moreover, his defense had once blocked the continuous attacks of a first stage half-Saint. Now, he was seriously injured by Lu Ming’s punch.</p><p>Below the fighting ring, the others were also shocked.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He stepped forward and closed in on Kuang Kong.</p><p>“Block it, I’m going to block it!”</p><p>Kuang Kong roared and waved his hands. Two more shields appeared. They were both holy weapons. The three holy weapon shields stacked together and floated in front of him.</p><p>At the same time, a suit of armor appeared on his body. It was also a holy weapon.</p><p>With so many defensive Saint weapons, it was no wonder that they could block the continuous attacks of a half-Saint.</p><p>As his genuine vitality constantly poured into the Liuyuan gloves, the Liuyuan gloves became heavier and heavier.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>He threw another punch at Kuang Kong’s shield.</p><p>Kuang Kong’s entire body was like a sandbag as he was sent flying. He crashed into the light screen, causing it to shake violently. Kuang Kong spat out a large mouthful of blood, and who knew how many bones in his body were broken.</p><p>“How can this person’s strength be so terrifying?”</p><p>Mad Kong was in despair.</p><p>Lu Ming’s strength had far surpassed that of the half-Saint he had met before. How could a person at the eighth level of the Martial Emperor realm have such shocking strength?</p><p>Of course, he did not know that when Lu Ming was at the peak of the seventh tier martial Royal realm, he could already fight head-on with the half-Saint of the thousand-kill mansion. Now that he had broken through to the eighth tier, his power was naturally stronger.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The Black Dragon Spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hands. He thrust the spear forward and the accumulated power of thirteen strikes burst out.</p><p>The 13 streams of power exploded, penetrating through Kuang Kong’s layers of defense and hitting his opponent’s body. Kuang Kong cried out in pain as his body was sent flying. This time, he didn’t get up.</p><p>Even with the protection of the Holy weapon, his life was gone.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and put away Kuang Kong’s holy weapon and storage ring.</p><p>who else wants to fight? it better be a half-Saint!</p><p>Lu Ming looked around and repeated himself.</p><p>what powerful strength! This person’s strength is even stronger than a first stage half-Saint!</p><p>it’s unbelievable. A Lv 8 martial Royal realm martial artist has such terrifying power. He must have a heavenly spiritual body!</p><p>even the heavenly spiritual body isn’t this terrifying!</p><p>Below the fighting ring, many people were discussing, but for a moment, no one went up.</p><p>Some people’s eyes flickered, as if they were measuring their own strength.</p><p>Lu Ming was able to destroy the gale with a few moves. His strength had already surpassed many first stage half-Saints. Some of the first stage half-Saints were also measuring their combat strength to see if they could fight Lu Ming.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>A moment later, a young man in a green robe stepped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>“It’s him, Lei Xiong!”</p><p>Many people’s eyes moved when they saw this young man.</p><p>it’s said that Lei Xiong is about to break through the second stage of the half-Saint realm and comprehend the laws of nature!</p><p>he’s on the stage. This battle is going to be interesting!</p><p>On the fighting ring, a smile finally appeared on Lu Ming’s face. Finally, a decent one had come.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lei Xiong made his move immediately. His entire body was covered in lightning. The terrifying lightning condensed into a lightning seal and charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Black Dragon Spear in Lu Ming’s hand shot up and swept across the Thunder seal. The Thunder seal exploded with a loud boom and the entire fighting ring was filled with the power of the Thunder cauldron.</p><p>But then, a huge lightning cauldron came crashing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and the Black Dragon Spear was blasted out again.</p><p>Lei Xiong had mastered the ultimate lightning domain and cultivated a terrifying domain martial technique. The power of lightning could turn into all kinds of terrifying attacks with shocking power.</p><p>Lu Ming did not use the divine sword technique or the chaos sky-turning seal. He only used ordinary combat techniques to fight with his opponent. For a moment, the two of them were in an intense battle, and it was difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>This battle lasted for half an hour. It only ended when the light screen disappeared.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>Lei Xiong gasped for breath. He had exhausted his essential core and if this continued, he would not be able to hold on. On the other hand, Lu Ming was still calm and composed.</p><p>“Monster!”</p><p>Lei Xiong mumbled, turned around and left the fighting ring.</p><p>unfortunately, it’s still lacking a little. I don’t have that sense of danger!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>After the battle with Lei Xiong, Lu Ming felt rather carefree. He felt that his comprehension of the chaos realm was somewhat inspired. However, he did not feel a sense of danger and the effect was still a little lacking.</p><p>“Are there any people at the second stage of the half-Saint realm? Come up and fight!”</p><p>Lu Ming spoke again, his voice spreading throughout the entire venue.</p><p>Many people below the fighting ring looked at each other.</p><p>Lu Ming actually wanted to challenge a half-Saint in the second stage. He was really abnormal.</p><p>An eighth level martial Royal realm expert challenging a second stage half-Saint, even if they were all from Emperor-level forces, was still dumbfounded.</p><p>The half-Saints here were not ordinary half-Saints outside. They were all genius half-Saints.</p><p>this is really interesting. I can’t believe such a heaven’s favorite appeared. If I can kill such a heaven’s favorite, it would be interesting!</p><p>A cold voice was heard as a pale-faced young man stepped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Then, the person took a step forward and a terrifying force surged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“The power of law!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils constricted. Then, he revealed a look of excitement.</p><p>He was a genuine second stage half-Saint.</p><p>“Thirteen charged attacks!”</p><p>The Black Dragon Spear flickered and stabbed forward.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>It was as if the Black Dragon Spear had stabbed into a mountain of steel. A terrifying force gushed forth, bending the Black Dragon Spear. Lu Ming’s body was forced to retreat a dozen steps before he could stabilize himself.</p><p>the power of law, what a powerful might!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart, but his eyes were even more excited, revealing a strong desire to fight.</p><p>Pressure. He could feel an intense pressure on his body. He needed this kind of pressure to force himself to keep moving forward.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
