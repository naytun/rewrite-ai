However, the noble young man slashed out with his sword, and the demonic Tiger’s body immediately collapsed, turning into a ball of demonic Qi.</p><p>...</p><p>However, at this moment, the noble young man’s pupils shrank. Two figures had appeared in the demonic Qi.</p><p>The two figures were exactly the same. There were two Lu Ming’s!</p><p>Of course, they were Lu Ming’s master God and clone.</p><p>Suddenly, a transparent bubble appeared on the young man’s body and covered him.</p><p>“Spacetime domain? Break!”</p><p>The noble young man roared. His body glowed, and a terrifying combat weapon Qi rushed out. With a bang, the transparent bubble was shattered.</p><p>However, at that moment, eight sealing gates appeared around him. Each one of them glowed with boundless light, and emanated terrifying sealing power that seemed to be trying to seal the young man.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had continuously used the nine seals of the divine Gate. Unknowingly, the nine seals of the divine Gate had broken through again. He could condense eight sealing gates at once, and they were even more powerful.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s main body roared. Two terrifying sword gleams shot out from his eyes and rushed into the noble young man’s body, causing him to tremble.</p><p>“Taiji!”</p><p>At this moment, Ming Lian whispered to himself. The Taichi formation disk floated above his head, and a huge Taichi pattern appeared, pressing down on the noble young man.</p><p>The Tai Chi formation disk contained a terrifying power of obliteration and suppression.</p><p>“Break, Break, Break!”</p><p>The noble young man let out a long roar. He held a sword in one hand and a spear in the other, attacking in all directions.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The eight sealing gates were destroyed one after another.</p><p>At this moment, the Tai Chi pattern pressed down, causing the noble young man’s body to shake violently. The vital essence that covered his body trembled.</p><p>His body froze in the air.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this time, the demonic bear had already arrived. It slapped the noble young man.</p><p>This palm directly hit the young man’s body, causing him to cry out in pain as he was sent flying. He heavily crashed into a wall, creating a large crater in the valley.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>But in the next moment, the noble youth rushed out of the hole. However, he was in a sorry state. His clothes were in tatters, revealing a golden armor.</p><p>His face was pale, and he couldn’t help but spit out another mouthful of blood. His aura was weak.</p><p>Just now, he had been hit by the power of the Tai Chi diagram and the demonic bear’s slap. In the end, he was still severely injured.</p><p>“Brat, don’t let me see you again. Otherwise, I’ll make you wish you were dead!”</p><p>The noble young man let out an unwilling roar, then turned into a rainbow light and soared into the sky, disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The demonic bear did not pursue.</p><p>this guy is really strong. Also, my soul power is still weak!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>The series of attacks just now had not been able to stop the noble youth.</p><p>He had used the godly sword technique to attack the other party’s soul. Although the other party had been affected, he had still retained a lot of strength, which was why he had escaped.</p><p>Otherwise, he would have been injured by the demonic bear’s slap.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current soul force was equivalent to the first stage of the half-Saint realm. It did not have a great impact on a half-Saint who had comprehended the laws.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, the demonic bear’s eyes looked at Lu Ming with a brutal glint.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a buzzing sound came from Lu Ming’s back. The prison-suppressing stele bloodline emerged.</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele was used to suppress evil spirits. Could it suppress these demonic creatures? Lu Ming planned to give it a try.</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele expanded rapidly and gave off a brilliant light. The word at the bottom of the stele was especially bright.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The demonic bear’s eyes revealed a look of awe. Then, it actually broke into a run and rushed into the depths of the valley.</p><p>The half-Saint demons did the same. They ran into the depths of the valley and disappeared.</p><p>“He really ran away?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s face revealed a smile.</p><p>The reason why he did not summon the prison-suppressing stele earlier was that he was afraid of scaring away these demonic creatures. If that happened, who would help him block the noble young man?</p><p>there must be a secret in this Valley. There are so many powerful monsters here. Let’s go in and take a look!</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>Since he had the prison-suppressing stele to intimidate the demons, Lu Ming was emboldened.</p><p>Ming Lian took a step forward and entered the space between Lu Ming’s eyebrows. He disappeared and went to cultivate in peace.</p><p>Now that the second body was progressing very quickly, he was getting closer and closer to lighting the ninth spirit lamp. Naturally, he had to seize the time to cultivate.</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele was suspended above Lu Ming’s head as he walked toward the depths of the valley.</p><p>The deeper he went, the wider and larger the valley became.</p><p>“Yes, so many bones!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. He discovered that there were many white bones in the valley ahead.</p><p>These white bones were of different shapes. Some were huge, like small mountains, while some were small and exquisite.</p><p>However, each type of white bone was as white as Jade and emitted fluorescent light. It could be seen that they had been extremely powerful when they were alive.</p><p>Lu Ming retracted his aura and continued to walk forward. In front of him were bone banners of all kinds.</p><p>“A Great War of the hundred races took place in the ancient times. Could this be the burial ground of the hundred races? And those demons were transformed after the death of these powerhouses?”</p><p>Lu Ming secretly guessed.</p><p>This was because the spiritual essence of these bone Gu had been lost very seriously. Some of the bone Gu had completely turned into dust. Obviously, they had experienced a long time.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>Lu Ming saw a huge human-shaped bone armor. This bone armor was very strange. It was golden in color and was seven to eight meters long.</p><p>“Could this be the legendary golden giant?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>The giant race was real, and the Golden giant was the Royal race among the giants. They were extremely terrifying and were natural-born warriors.</p><p>“Could this be the Qilin’s bone armor?”</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming saw a skeleton armor that looked very much like the legendary Qilin. Unfortunately, the spiritual essence in these bones was about to be depleted and they were no longer of any value.</p><p>If the spiritual essence of these bone Gu was not lost, the value of these bone Gu would be shocking.</p><p>“Strange, there shouldn’t be so many bone Gu in a hundred clan war. They should be scattered everywhere. Did someone purposely gather these corpses here?” someone asked.</p><p>Lu Ming made a guess.</p><p>“Then, are there any dragon bones here?”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The dragon clan was most likely involved in the hundred tribe war. If he could find some dragon bones, his Dragon God combat body would be able to evolve.</p><p>If he could break through the category of an earth spiritual body and evolve into a low-grade heaven spiritual body, Lu Ming’s strength would skyrocket.</p><p>“Let’s look for it!”</p><p>Lu Ming was suddenly in high spirits.</p><p>Although the spiritual essence of the bone armor had been severely lost, as long as there was enough of it, it could still allow Lu Ming’s Dragon divine combat body to evolve.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to venture deeper and finally entered a huge plot of land. It was covered with all kinds of bone banners. He could not see the end of it. It was as if he had come to a world of bones.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
