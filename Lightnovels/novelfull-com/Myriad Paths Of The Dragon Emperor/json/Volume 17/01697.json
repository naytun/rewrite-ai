Kill!”</p><p>The divine Son shouted and raised his combat strength to the maximum as he charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming retreated rapidly.</p><p>Now that the Laws of Chaos were in his body, Lu Ming indeed needed some time to get used to it. This period of time was the most dangerous period for him.</p><p>“You can’t escape!”</p><p>The Son of God gave chase.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>A pair of Yin Yang fish swords slashed toward the divine Son.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The divine Son combat sword slashed out and sent the Yin Yang fish sword flying.</p><p>He seemed to have noticed the difference between the main and secondary body. He stared at Lu Ming’s main body and ignored the secondary body.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The sound of air being pierced rang out as the second body took out 21 Phoenix Feather flying swords. They formed a sword formation and attacked the Son of God.</p><p>“Get lost, get lost!”</p><p>The Son of God’s battle sword swept across, and the sword Qi broke through the air. All the Phoenix Feather flying swords were sent flying.</p><p>However, at this moment, Lu Ming moved and appeared in front of his main body, blocking it. At the same time, he waved his hands at high speed. In the air, countless runes appeared, and one after another, large formations appeared. All kinds of defense, trap, bind, attack, all of them rushed towards the divine Son.</p><p>Now, the secondary body’s main purpose was to stall for time.</p><p>“If you want to stall for time, break!”</p><p>The Son of God’s hair stood on end as he swept his combat sword across, breaking through the formations one by one.</p><p>The second body took a few steps forward. With each step, countless runes appeared. One after another, large formations appeared in the air.</p><p>Although these arrays couldn’t harm the Son of God, it would be good if they could delay him.</p><p>The second body’s hands kept moving, and runes appeared one after another. They were opened by the second body, and all kinds of formations flashed in the runes and fell toward the divine Son.</p><p>These inscription scrolls were all made by him.</p><p>As for Lu Ming’s main body, he retreated quickly and tried his best to adapt to the law tank.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The Son of God let out a long howl. His sword light swept across, and countless formations collapsed. A sword light stabbed at Ming Lian’s second body at a terrifying speed.</p><p>Ming Lian waved his hand, and dozens of layers of defense appeared in front of him. However, these layers of defense were like paper under the sword light. They couldn’t withstand a single blow and were instantly penetrated.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The sword light pierced through the clone’s chest, leaving a large hole that was bright from the front and back.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>In the stands, Lu Xiangxiang cried out sorrowfully.</p><p>“Junior Brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>Tian Chui, Xue ningxin, Longyuan Shan, and the others all clenched their fists tightly, their veins bulging.</p><p>Everyone at the scene was staring at the battle. The battle had entered a critical moment.</p><p>This battle was more exciting than anyone had expected.</p><p>In the beginning, many people had thought that this would be a battle without any suspense. They thought that the divine Son would be able to kill Lu Ming easily.</p><p>However, when the battle between the two of them truly began, it was beyond everyone’s imagination.</p><p>This battle was full of suspense. From the beginning, no one could have predicted the outcome. The two of them kept using their trump cards and carried out a peak battle.</p><p>Even now, no one could guess who would win in the end.</p><p>Everyone’s hearts were in their throats, and they seemed to have forgotten to breathe.</p><p>Some of the young men were so excited that they were trembling.</p><p>A battle. This was a battle between geniuses. In a clash between geniuses, the difference between them was too great.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Ming Lian’s chest was pierced through and he spat out a few mouthfuls of blood. However, his eyes were still calm. He took a step forward and dense runes filled the air again. The formation appeared.</p><p>A golden mental energy fire burned between his brows, and the array Dao laws circulated around his body. Above his head, the Tai Chi array diagram gave off a brilliant light.</p><p>Another Tai Chi formation appeared and turned into the Yin Yang fish sword.</p><p>The divine son’s attacks were relentless. Streaks of terrifying sword radiance slashed out. Each sword radiance could easily kill an initial bright Saint.</p><p>All the formations were swept away.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Yin Yang fish sword was sent flying. PU, it quickly dodged, but it was still hit by the sword light, and one of its arms flew out.</p><p>However, Ming Lian’s secondary body still stood firmly in front of Lu Ming’s main body, resisting with all its might.</p><p>“Ah, get lost!”</p><p>The Son of God roared madly. There was a time limit to his secret skill’s explosive power, and he couldn’t afford to delay.</p><p>However, the methods of refining the secondary body were endless. He retreated as he fought and blocked in front of Lu Ming’s main body. He could not rush over for a while.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Ming Lian’s clone was hit by the sword light again. This time, it was even more serious. His waist was cut open, and he was almost cut in two.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The divine Son hollered, planning to destroy Lu Ming’s body completely before killing his main body.</p><p>“You’re the one who’s going to die!”</p><p>At this moment, a cold voice was heard. A figure suddenly appeared in front of the second body and threw a punch.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This punch landed on the sword light around him, causing it to tremble. The Son of God’s body trembled as he felt a storm-like power surging over, causing him to retreat.</p><p>This figure was Lu Ming’s main body.</p><p>“How is that possible? The body needs to adapt to it. How can you adapt so quickly?”</p><p>The Son of God cried out in disbelief.</p><p>It had not even been a minute and Lu Ming had already adapted to it?</p><p>others are others. I am me. Son of God, you are the one who will die today!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. With a wave of his hand, he kept Ming Lian’s clone into the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Although Ming Lian’s second body was severely injured, he would recover after a period of rest.</p><p>Lu Ming had indeed gotten used to it.</p><p>The Laws of Chaos coursed through every muscle and cell in Lu Ming’s body. He felt that he was extremely powerful now.</p><p>Initially, Lu Ming could not have gotten used to it so quickly. However, he had refined a wisp of chaos Qi and there was chaos Qi in his body.</p><p>The law of chaos was very similar to the chaos Qi. That was why Lu Ming could adapt to it so quickly.</p><p>freak, he’s really a freak. He’s different in every way!</p><p>Someone sighed.</p><p>“So what if you’ve adapted? So what if he had stepped into the nomological tank? If you don’t become a saint, you’ll still be an ant. Kill!”</p><p>The Son of God roared and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and destroyed his opponent’s sword gleam. Then, two jet-black sword gleams shot out from his eyes and entered the divine son’s glabella.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The Son of God screamed as his body trembled.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s breakthrough to the third stage of the half-Saint realm, the laws were in his body and his soul force had also improved. It was now equivalent to the soul force of a great bright Saint, which was equivalent to that of a Divine Son. If he used the divine sword technique, it would naturally have a great impact on the divine Son.</p><p>“The nine seals of the gate of God!”</p><p>Lu Ming formed a series of hand seals, and nine sealing gates appeared, surrounding his body in the middle. Then, a huge chaos sky-turning stamp appeared and pressed down on the divine Son.</p><p>With the breakthrough in his cultivation, Lu Ming had improved in all aspects and his combat strength had soared.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The Son of God endured the intense pain in his soul and let out a loud cry. He slashed out sword light after sword light, destroying the nine sealing gates. However, the chaos sky-turning stamp had already come down, and the Son of God could only block it with his sword.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Son of God’s body trembled violently as he retreated and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
