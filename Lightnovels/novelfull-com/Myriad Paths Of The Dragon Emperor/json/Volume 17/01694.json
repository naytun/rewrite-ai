They could not accept this.</p><p>...</p><p>In their hearts, the divine Son, who was invincible in the same realm, was forced into a disadvantageous position by a half-Saint with his cultivation of the Saint realm. This was simply a fantasy.</p><p>“How is that possible? How is that possible?”</p><p>Mo Yang shook his head repeatedly and roared in his heart.</p><p>All this while, he had not taken Lu Ming seriously. He thought that he could easily crush Lu Ming.</p><p>But he didn’t expect that this time, it completely subverted his imagination.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had easily killed Luo shuihan, which made his heart tremble. He did not even dare to fight Lu Ming and admitted defeat. He thought that Lu Ming would die at the hands of the divine Son.</p><p>However, he now realized that Lu Ming had not used much of his strength earlier. Now, he was actually able to suppress the divine Son.</p><p>“Why is he so strong? Why am I not the stronger one? who is Lu Ming? what right does he have to have such combat strength?”</p><p>Mo Yang roared in his heart. He was extremely jealous.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you really didn’t let me down. However, this is still far from enough!”</p><p>In the area of the tianshen sect, Xie nianjun’s eyes flickered as he murmured in his heart.</p><p>On the other hand, the people at Dragon God Valley were cheering.</p><p>“Son of God, is this your true power? It doesn’t seem to work!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s slightly mocking voice was heard.</p><p>The Son of God’s eyes were filled with surprise.”Lu Ming, your combat strength has indeed exceeded my expectations. It’s a pity that you’ve met me. You’re destined to die!”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Son of God stepped forward. The Saint light on his body became even more intense. It turned into a pillar of light that shot into the sky.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Then, the divine Son strode towards Lu Ming. With each step, his aura grew stronger. In the end, the divine son’s aura was so powerful that it was shocking. It was several times stronger than before.</p><p>“Great mastery of bright Saint!”</p><p>In Dragon God Valley, the purple dragon Valley master could not help but exclaim.</p><p>“What? The Divine Child has already reached the great mastery of the bright Saint stage. So fast?”</p><p>the greater mastery of bright Saint is several times more powerful than the lower mastery of bright Saint. Lu Ming is finished. The divine son’s cultivation is too high. Lu Ming is no match for him!</p><p>it’s a pity. Lu Ming is indeed extremely powerful. It’s rare to see him like this since ancient times. If he’s given a few more years, he might be able to fight against the divine Son!</p><p>“The heavens are jealous of geniuses. The time left for him is too short!”</p><p>Many people sighed. Some shook their heads, but some were gloating, hoping that Lu Ming would be killed.</p><p>Yin Zisong and the others from the silver Dragon Valley looked ferocious, hoping that Lu Ming would be killed.</p><p>The strength that Lu Ming had displayed this time was too shocking. If Lu Ming was not killed, they would not have a place in Dragon God Valley in the future.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, you’re going to die in the end!”</p><p>Mo Yang laughed in his heart, but his face was filled with ferocity.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A small, snow-white Pagoda appeared above the Son of God’s head. It was rapidly growing in size. At the same time, a combat sword appeared in his hand. It was covered in holy light.</p><p>Without a doubt, these were all holy weapons.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The small snow-white Tower grew to the size of a mountain and pressed down on Lu Ming. With the cultivation of a Divine Son in the upper tier of the bright Saint, he was extremely powerful when controlling a Saint weapon.</p><p>At this moment, light spots appeared on Lu Ming’s body. A holy weapon flew out from each light spot. There were a total of 36 holy weapons, floating around him.</p><p>The others were dumbfounded and almost bit their tongues.</p><p>Thirty-six holy weapons. Lu Ming had taken out thirty-six holy weapons at once. Most of the people were dumbfounded.</p><p>Most people had never touched a holy weapon before and had only seen others use it. But now, Lu Ming took out 36 holy weapons at once. It was really infuriating to compare people.</p><p>“What’s the use of having many holy weapons?”</p><p>The Son of God coldly spoke. The giant Pagoda glowed and pressed down.</p><p>The battle weapon Qi of the 36 holy weapons around Lu Ming connected with each other and gathered on a huge cauldron.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and the huge cauldron enlarged rapidly, crashing toward the giant tower.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>It was as if two mountains had collided. The sky shook violently. After the cauldron and the giant Pagoda collided, they were evenly matched and retreated together.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The Son of God wielded a long spear and charged at Lu Ming. The long spear pierced through the air, making a terrifying whistling sound.</p><p>Lu Ming was not afraid at all. He grabbed the Black Dragon Spear beside him, gathered the Qi of the combat weapon, and circulated the law, then charged at the divine Son.</p><p>The light collided in the void, and the force swept in all directions.</p><p>Experts like the purple dragon Valley master set up a defensive light curtain with a wave of their hands. Otherwise, those below the Saint realm would have died if they were hit by the Qi.</p><p>“Great saint light technique!”</p><p>The Son of God howled. The Holy Light on his body became even more dazzling. In the end, it turned into a holy light armor that covered the Son of God. The Son of God’s power became even stronger. The spear of divine punishment pierced through the void. It was indestructible.</p><p>The Divine Child started to suppress Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and activated his divine sword technique. Two pitch-black rays of light burst out from his eyes and rushed into the divine son’s glabella. The divine son’s glabella emitted a bright light, but he only trembled slightly as if nothing had happened.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current soul force was equivalent to an initial bright Saint, while the divine Son was a greater bright Saint. He most likely had a soul defense technique. Lu Ming’s divine sword technique had little effect on the divine Son.</p><p>“Chaos!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. A chaos Empyrean seal appeared in his left hand and he threw it at the divine Son.</p><p>The chaos sky-turning seal rapidly grew in size and pressed down, causing the Son of God’s expression to turn grave.</p><p>He controlled the giant tower and crashed it into the chaos sky-turning stamp. The spear of God’s punishment in his hand did not stop and continued to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming held the Black Dragon Spear in his hand and met the attack head-on.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The giant Pagoda was sent flying, but the chaos sky-turning seal also disappeared without a trace.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>Another chaos Empyrean seal was formed in Lu Ming’s hands and he charged at the divine Son.</p><p>Lu Ming condensed the chaos Empyrean seal and used the ten thousand soldiers art to fight the divine Son.</p><p>For a moment, the two of them were actually evenly matched. The battle ended in a draw, and they constantly collided in the void. It was extremely intense.</p><p>Lu Ming was at a disadvantage in terms of cultivation. He was only at the second stage of the half-Saint realm.</p><p>Back then, in the hundred clan battlefield, Lu Ming, his second body, and bubbles had killed a perfected bright Saint with just a few moves.</p><p>However, that was only the combination of the three. If Lu Ming was alone, he could only slightly suppress the existence of the Enlightenment Saint, but he would not be able to kill him.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming had 36 holy weapons sealed in his body. After cultivating in seclusion in the Dragon God Valley for more than a month, he had finally cultivated the chaos sky-turning seal to the sixth level. With Lu Ming as the main body, his overall combat strength was much stronger than it had been in the hundred tribes battlefield.</p><p>However, the Saints outside were stronger than the Saints in the hundred clan battlefield because they could use the laws more smoothly.</p><p>Moreover, the divine Son was a monster of the Azure region. He was the number one genius of the Azure region and was indeed very powerful. Therefore, even though Lu Ming had used all his strength, he could only fight to a draw with the divine Son.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
