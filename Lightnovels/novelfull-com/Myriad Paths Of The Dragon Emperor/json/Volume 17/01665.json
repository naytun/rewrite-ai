What a joke, rules are set by humans. Now, we can set new rules!”</p><p>The old ancestor of the Cheng family, one of the four great families, sneered.</p><p>that’s right. Do you want to stop us? hehe, that’s great!</p><p>The other Saint realm old ancestor said.</p><p>Old ancestor su and family head SU’s expressions changed.</p><p>The other party’s intention was obvious. If the SU family wanted to stop them, they could take this opportunity to join forces and destroy the SU family.</p><p>Ka-creak!</p><p>&Nbsp; old ancestor su clenched his fists and then sighed, ” “Then let’s split the treasures in the storage bracelet equally between the four of us, how about that?”</p><p>that’s more like it. However, that girl is currently receiving the inheritance. We have to interrupt her immediately and extract the inheritance. We’ll split it among the four families!</p><p>“That’s right, the benefits can’t be taken by the SU family alone!”</p><p>The other patriarchs said indifferently.</p><p>“Don’t you go too far!”</p><p>Old ancestor su hollered. He was really furious like a furious Lion. He stared at the other three old ancestors and hollered, ” if we forcefully interrupt the process of receiving the inheritance, the person receiving the inheritance will definitely suffer a backlash and die. Moreover, the inheritance can’t be extracted!</p><p>“How would you know if you don’t try?”</p><p>The Cheng family’s old ancestor said casually.</p><p>“That’s right. We’ll know if it works or not after we try!”</p><p>Another ancestor said coldly.</p><p>Their eyes were filled with coldness. What did su Lei’s life and death have to do with them?</p><p>Moreover, they could not allow the SU family to obtain the complete inheritance. Otherwise, if they were to rise to power in the future, would the other families still have a place in Gusu city?</p><p>They knew that su Lei would definitely die if they interrupted her inheritance. Moreover, the inheritance could not be extracted.</p><p>But their goal was to kill su Lei.</p><p>you’ve gone too far. Today, I won’t let you touch my su family even if I die!</p><p>Old ancestor su hollered and a terrifying aura spread out from his body.</p><p>Su Lei had obtained the inheritance of the ancestral land and was the hope of the SU family. He could not let her die.</p><p>&Nbsp; the SU family head stood beside old ancestor su.</p><p>hehe, old man su, I’m afraid you’re not enough. I’ll deal with this old man. I’ll leave the girl to you!</p><p>The Cheng family’s old ancestor sneered. His body also emitted a shocking aura as he stepped towards the SU family’s old ancestor. The auras clashed in the air, causing rumbling sounds.</p><p>The Cheng family’s master had his eyes on the SU family’s master.</p><p>“There’s no need for the patriarch to deal with a little girl. I can do it!”</p><p>The head of the Hong family from the other family spoke and walked towards su Lei.</p><p>Old ancestor SU’s eyes were filled with despair.</p><p>The patriarchs of the four great clans were all at the initial bright Saint realm. None of them could do anything to the other. He alone could not stop the other three great clans.</p><p>The head of the Hong family revealed a sinister smile on his face as he approached su Lei. Of course, he was still cautious, because su Lei had accepted the inheritance of the mysterious Yin Dragon. He didn’t know if the soul of the mysterious Yin Dragon was still there.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, who was sitting beside su Lei, he was completely ignored.</p><p>In the competition half a month ago, although Lu Ming had displayed terrifying abilities, he was a third stage half-Saint and a powerhouse whose body was filled with laws. He did not take Lu Ming seriously at all.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming opened his eyes. There was a cold look in his eyes.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming spat out the word ‘scram’.</p><p>“Kid, what did you say?”</p><p>The head of the Hong family was slightly taken aback, and then he revealed a sinister smile.</p><p>“If you don’t get lost, you’ll die!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was even colder.</p><p>“What big words. Then I’ll kill you first!”</p><p>The master of the Hong family was filled with cold killing intent. He sent a palm strike towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming made his move. He suddenly pounced toward the master of the Hong family and made a grabbing motion.</p><p>All the attacks and defenses of the Hong family’s master were instantly destroyed. Lu Ming looked down from above, grabbed his throat, and slammed him onto the ground.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The ground trembled and a huge crater was formed. The bones and armor of the master of the Hong family were broken. Not only that, Lu Ming’s terrifying destructive power rushed into his body and destroyed his spiritual God.</p><p>“You … You …”</p><p>Blood gushed out of the master of the Hong family’s mouth as he stared at Lu Ming in disbelief. Then, his head tilted to the side and he breathed his last.</p><p>At the scene, everyone else was also stunned.</p><p>Lu Ming had killed the master of the Hong family with one move. He was a third stage half-Saint, an expert who was affected by the laws.</p><p>The master of the SU family broke out in a cold sweat. He was glad that he did not attack Lu Ming back then. Otherwise, he would most likely end up the same way.</p><p>“Brat, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>The patriarch of the Hong family came back to his senses. A terrifying aura burst out of his body, and a vast Saint might pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, the patriarch of the Hong family took a step forward and charged towards Lu Ming. A terrifying saber radiance slashed down at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>The SU family’s old ancestor roared and wanted to help Lu Ming. However, the Cheng family’s old ancestor struck out a palm towards him. He had no choice but to counterattack to protect himself.</p><p>The patriarch of the Hong family’s terrifying saber gleam was about to land on Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm glowed and the flowing elemental water jacket covered his palm. He raised his hand and grabbed the Hong family patriarch’s saber flare. The saber flare stopped in mid-air.</p><p>“Behead him!”</p><p>The patriarch of the Hong family roared. His holy power was boiling and the power of law burst out. He wanted to cut Lu Ming and his hand in half.</p><p>However, the gleam of the blade remained in the air, in Lu Ming’s hand. It did not fall at all.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>The patriarch’s heart trembled, and his eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>He was a Sage. How could Lu Ming block his attack so easily?</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming exerted force and the other party’s saber gleam shattered like glass.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming used the thundering wind steps and appeared in front of the Hong family’s patriarch with a single step. He then threw a punch.</p><p>The flowing essence gloves glowed, and the Laws of Chaos burst forth. It destroyed everything as if it was a piece of rotten wood.</p><p>The patriarch of the Hong family slashed with all his might but it was shattered by Lu Ming’s punch.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s fist landed heavily on the body of the patriarch of the Hong family. The patriarch let out a blood-curdling screech as a huge hole was blasted in his body. He was sent flying far away and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Following that, the Black Dragon Spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hand. It shot out like lightning and pierced through the glabella of the patriarch of the Hong family, nailing him to the ground. He was dead.</p><p>He was dead!</p><p>The patriarch of the Hong family was killed by Lu Ming just like that. At this moment, the others were all staring at Lu Ming in shock. Their eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p>A Saint had been killed just like that, and it had seemed so easy.</p><p>They had only heard of Saints being killed by non-Saints in legends. However, it was happening right in front of their eyes. It made them feel like they were in a dream.</p><p>the second stage of half-Saint!</p><p>The old ancestor of Cheng family muttered.</p><p>They could finally see Lu Ming’s cultivation level clearly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
