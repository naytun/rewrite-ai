BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>There were four terrifying auras in total. They rose like smoke and pressed toward the Phoenix Palace.</p><p>...</p><p>Then, four figures walked in the air. With every step they took, the sky would rumble, and a huge pressure pressed down on the Phoenix Palace.</p><p>A figure flashed and Huang Ling appeared beside Lu Ming.</p><p>Then, the other disciples of Phoenix Palace rushed out.</p><p>“It’s finally here!”</p><p>Huang Ling muttered, her eyes solemn.</p><p>The heaven’s favorites from the other cities are finally going to make a move.</p><p>Four people came at once.</p><p>These four people were absolutely terrifying heaven’s pride experts. Each of them was a heaven’s pride expert on the level of the blood prison young master and Wan Tiancheng.</p><p>Without such combat strength, they would not dare to have any designs on Lu Ming and Huang Ling.</p><p>Four young men, three men and one woman, stood in a row in front of Huang Ling and Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, the entire Darkwater city was alarmed. Countless people rose into the air and looked over.</p><p>it’s so terrifying. The four powerful cultivators are going to attack Lu Ming and Huang Ling!</p><p>it’s only a matter of time. The other geniuses are all looking for experts to form an alliance with. As for Lu Ming and Huang Ling, there’s only two of them. Naturally, they’ll be targeted!</p><p>four against two. Lu Ming and Feng Ling are most likely in danger. They can’t keep the map and the key!</p><p>The voices reverberated in the sky.</p><p>Not far from the Phoenix Palace, Zhao Kuang and Sima Liang were also watching.</p><p>Hmph, Lu Ming, aren’t you all very arrogant? this time, let’s see how you can keep the map key!</p><p>Zhao Kuang coldly laughed.</p><p>“Lu Ming and Feng Ling better be killed!”</p><p>Sima Liang’s face was filled with viciousness.</p><p>“Huang Ling, Lu Ming, hand over the map and key to the tomb of the reincarnation King!”</p><p>A young man said directly.</p><p>“If you want the map and key to the tomb of the reincarnation King, let’s see if you have the ability!”</p><p>Huang Ling said coldly.</p><p>“Huang Ling, although your undying celestial phoenix body has strong vitality, you don’t stand a chance against the two of us. Lu Ming, I know you killed young master blood prison some time ago, but are you still a match for the two of us? I’m warning you, don’t make a mistake!”</p><p>A young man said coldly.</p><p>“You can try to see if you’re a match for him!”</p><p>Lu Ming spoke in a very domineering manner.</p><p>you’re so stubborn. Since that’s the case, attack!</p><p>die! a young man shouted as he stepped out and charged towards Feng Ling.</p><p>At the same time, the only woman among the four of them also charged at Feng Ling.</p><p>The remaining two people charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Two against one!</p><p>The cry of a Phoenix rang out, and a shadow of the undying Phoenix rushed out of Huang Ling’s body. A pair of phoenix wings extended from her back, and her whole body was bathed in the undying flames.</p><p>The Phoenix’s wings flapped out, and like two divine swords, they slashed at the opponent, engaging in a great battle with the opponent.</p><p>However, the moment they exchanged blows, Huang Ling was at a disadvantage.</p><p>The two of them weren’t any weaker than her, so she could only use her undying celestial phoenix body to hold on.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he had also engaged in a huge battle with the other party.</p><p>A huge cauldron pressed down on Lu Ming, and at the same time, there was a terrifying flaming sword Qi.</p><p>The power of two terrifying heaven’s favorites working together was too strong.</p><p>Lu Ming’s glabella glowed and Ming Lian stepped out. A Tai Chi formation disk floated above his head. A Tai Chi formation diagram appeared and pressed down on the young man who had slashed out the flaming sword aura.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The flaming sword Qi was dispersed. Ming Lian waved his hand and a Phoenix’s cry was heard. The Phoenix Feather flying sword flew out.</p><p>This time, there was a total of 21 Phoenix Feather flying swords. They formed a sword array and turned into a terrifying sword light, attacking the other party.</p><p>Back in the Windy Plains, Lu Ming had obtained more than a dozen Phoenix Feathers. During this period of time, they had all been refined into Phoenix Feather flying swords by his Ming Lian clone.</p><p>A total of 21 Phoenix Feather flying swords formed a sword formation, and its power was extremely shocking.</p><p>“Divine sun sword!”</p><p>The other party held a flaming sword and slashed out sword Qi like the sun towards the second body.</p><p>Lu Ming’s main body glowed with light as he cast the ten thousand soldiers art. Holy weapons appeared one after another. He held a spear in one hand and a sword in the other. They bombarded the cauldron and sent it flying.</p><p>“Nine Cauldrons suppressing the heavens!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s opponent was a young man in a black robe. He had long hair and a mysterious aura. Nine Cauldrons were floating around him.</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but think of the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron also had nine entities to suppress the Dragon veins.</p><p>The black-robed young man controlled the nine Cauldrons to press down on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and cast the divine sword technique at his opponent.</p><p>The black-robed youth’s body trembled, and his attack slowed down.</p><p>Lu Ming threw the spear and sword in his hands and controlled the other holy weapons to fight against the nine Cauldrons.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>Without a doubt, the nine Cauldrons were all Saint weapons. When the nine Cauldrons worked together, their power would be even more shocking.</p><p>In the sky above the Phoenix Palace, the sound of metal clashing came out like the ringing of a Bell.</p><p>The other disciples of the Phoenix Palace could not interfere at all. Ordinary Geniuses would be injured or even killed by the overflowing Qi if they got close.</p><p>“Chaos!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. A chaos sky-turning stamp appeared in each of his palms and he threw it at the other party.</p><p>The chaos sky-turning stamp was as big as a mountain. It pressed down as if it wanted to crush everything.</p><p>The black-robed young man’s pupils contracted rapidly. He summoned a few cauldrons and blasted them upwards.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>With two muffled booms, the opponent’s cauldron was sent flying, and the black-robed young man retreated.</p><p>At this moment, a Pagoda appeared above Lu Ming’s head. The bubble was inside.</p><p>“Bubble, help this second body!”</p><p>Lu Ming said and the pagoda flew towards the battlefield of the second body of inscription.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming roared and unleashed the divine sword technique. Two more flipping Sky Seals appeared in his palms and pressed down on the other party.</p><p>The other party roared, and his body emitted a strange light, causing the nine Cauldrons to shake. Many of Lu Ming’s Saint weapons were knocked away, and he then fought against the flipping Sky Seal.</p><p>The battle between the two was purely a fierce battle of strength. There was no technique involved. The flipping Sky Seal and the nine Cauldrons kept colliding with each other like mountains. They kept bombarding each other in the air, shaking the entire Darkwater city.</p><p>Many of the weaker cultivators were forced to retreat. The sound waves from the collision were too powerful.</p><p>However, with the help of Lu Ming’s divine sword technique, the young man in Black was slowly losing to Lu Ming. He was being suppressed by Lu Ming and had to retreat after every collision.</p><p>After more than ten moves, the black-clothed youth had already retreated more than ten miles.</p><p>“The nine seals of the gate of God!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s hands suddenly formed a seal. Nine gates of sealing suddenly appeared in the air, emitting a brilliant light. Each of them was aimed at one of the cauldrons.</p><p>Currently, Lu Ming had cultivated the nine seals of the gate of God to its peak. He could condense nine sealing gates at once. The nine gates were connected and the sealing power was greatly enhanced.</p><p>His opponent’s Nine Cauldrons were sealed in an instant. They stopped in the air and could not move.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
