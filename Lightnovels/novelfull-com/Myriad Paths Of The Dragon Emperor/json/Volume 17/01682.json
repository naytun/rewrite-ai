They wanted to save the lives of the most powerful heaven’s favorites. Otherwise, another top heaven’s favorite would die during the Dragon God Valley challenge.</p><p>Then, when it was the Tianyu demonic sect’s turn to challenge, they also sent out a top-notch heaven’s pride expert to challenge another top-notch heaven’s pride expert from the tianshen sect. The two of them exchanged a few moves before falling off the battle platform.</p><p>...</p><p>In this way, the top geniuses of the tianshen sect and the Tianyu demon sect had all failed.</p><p>“Hahaha, what are they doing? Is this a child’s game?”</p><p>On the grandstand, Tian Chui laughed out loud, his voice reverberating throughout the entire arena.</p><p>“Senior brother, you don’t know this. These people bully the weak and fear the strong. When they see someone who is easy to bully, they will bully them in all kinds of ways. They have a high and mighty appearance. When they see that they are not a match, they will be afraid to die. In order to save their lives, they will use any means possible.”</p><p>Xue ningxin said.</p><p>no wonder Mo Yang and Luo shuihan ran away so quickly. They probably can’t sit still anymore!</p><p>Tian Chui said with a grin.</p><p>As the two of them echoed each other, the people of the Tian Shen sect and the Tian Yu demon sect were so angry that they almost vomited blood.</p><p>But he couldn’t refute a single word.</p><p>This was simply too embarrassing. This time, the faces of the few sects could be considered to have been completely lost. It was even more embarrassing than three years ago.</p><p>Three years ago, they could still fight. But this time, they didn’t even dare to fight.</p><p>“I have something to do, I’ll be leaving first!”</p><p>“I’ll be leaving too!”</p><p>At this moment, some of the disciples of the heavenly God sect and the Tianyu demon sect who were at the LV 7 martial Royal realm and above could no longer sit still. They stood up and left one after another.</p><p>It would be too embarrassing if he continued to stay.</p><p>As for the people of Dragon God Valley, they were all very comfortable. They felt that their hearts were clear and their thoughts were clear.</p><p>This time, no one from the Dragon God Valley died, but they killed so many heaven’s pride experts of the tianshen sect, forcing the other party to not even dare to fight. It was so satisfying.</p><p>More people knew that it was Lu Ming.</p><p>All of this had happened because of Lu Ming.</p><p>If Lu Ming had not taken out his life-saving talisman, a group of them would have died when the three sects started to target them.</p><p>Moreover, su Lei and Qiu Yingying were also brought in by Lu Ming. He had never expected that su Lei and Qiu Yingying would be so terrifying.</p><p>This time, he had ruthlessly smacked the faces of the three sects, Tian Yu demon sect and Yu Du sect.</p><p>The competition continued.</p><p>When it was the Yu Du sect’s turn, they no longer had any top geniuses. The only one had died at the hands of Qiu Ying Ying, and they had randomly sent out a genius to challenge the other sects.</p><p>There was no longer any suspense in the next challenge.</p><p>Every time it was Dragon God Valley’s turn to challenge, one of the three sects, including the tianshen sect, would be killed.</p><p>As a result, the three great sects had no desire to continue fighting. They directly challenged each other, and every time, both sides would suffer heavy losses. Their goal was to survive.</p><p>In this way, the tianshen sect, the Tianyu demonic sect, and the Yudu sect were the first to be eliminated.</p><p>This process was very similar to three years ago.</p><p>However, this time, the remaining heaven’s favorites from the other sects could not do anything to su Lei and Qiu Ying Ying.</p><p>Three years ago, Lu Ming was alone and his cultivation was only at the fourth level Martial Emperor realm. They could take turns to fight him. However, this time, su Lei and Qiu Yingying were two people and they could take turns to rest. The effect of taking turns to fight in a chaotic battle was not great.</p><p>In the end, those heaven’s favorites were helpless and could only tell Qiu Ying Ying and su Lei that they were just sparring. They were defeated by the two of them.</p><p>The following matches seemed very boring, because there was no longer any suspense.</p><p>In the end, only su Lei and Qiu Ying Ying were left on the fighting ring.</p><p>After three years, Dragon God Valley had won the treasure auction again without losing a single person. This had never happened in history.</p><p>The face of the sage realm elder of the heavenly God sect was as black as charcoal. After giving the seven royal domain elixirs to su Lei and Qiu Ying Ying, he left with his disciples.</p><p>The Tian Yu demonic sect and Yu Du sect did the same, leaving with their tails between their legs.</p><p>The Saint realm elder of Dragon God Valley walked out and couldn’t stop smiling.</p><p>The battle ended with the Dragon God Valley’s complete victory. The disciples of the Dragon God Valley returned to their encampment with joy.</p><p>Junior Brother Lu Ming, you must be careful in the treasure ceremony seven days from now. Mo Yang and Luo shuihan might target you!</p><p>Zi Feng said somewhat worriedly.</p><p>“It’s fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Everyone returned to their rooms to prepare for the treasure sealing assembly that would be held in seven days.</p><p>Lu Ming also walked towards his room, but before he reached his room, a disciple of the Dragon God Valley came to report to Lu Ming that someone wanted to see him.</p><p>Lu Ming was a little curious. He did not know who it was.</p><p>There was a quiet bamboo forest in the back mountain of Dragon God Valley. When Lu Ming stepped into the bamboo forest, his eyes flashed.</p><p>In front of him was a woman in a white dress. She stood in the bamboo forest with a peerless face, like a fairy from a painting.</p><p>Xie nianjun!</p><p>Although Xie nianjun and Xie nianqing looked almost the same, Lu Ming could still recognize them at a glance.</p><p>Lu Ming did not expect that the person looking for him would be Xie nianjun.</p><p>“Long time no see, Xie nianjun!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and said indifferently.</p><p>Ever since the tianshen sect and the other sects went to the continent of the divine Ruins to recruit disciples, Xie nianjun was chosen by the tianshen sect and came to the yuan continent. They had not seen each other for nearly six years.</p><p>Xie nianjun had arrived in the yuan continent two years earlier than them.</p><p>All these years, Xie nianjun had not appeared. Why did he appear now to look for Lu Ming?</p><p>it has indeed been a long time. I already know about the divine wilderness continent!</p><p>Xie nianjun said with a smile.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up as he stared at Xie nianjun. You have sent people to the divine wilderness? ”</p><p>that’s right, but don’t worry, I did not interfere with the matters of the divine wilderness continent. The divine wilderness continent is too small, a small piece of land, not enough to fight for. It’s also good for the Xie family to end up like that!</p><p>Xie nianjun muttered.</p><p>“Oh? Did you come to find me just to tell me this?”</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a sigh of relief and asked.</p><p>of course not. I’m looking for you because of the godchild. I want to tell you a secret.</p><p>Xie nianjun said.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered but he did not say anything. He just stared at Xie nianjun.</p><p>Lu Ming, let me tell you. The divine Son has broken through to the mastery bright Saint realm not long ago!</p><p>Xie nianjun continued.</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. The Divine Child had indeed broken through.</p><p>furthermore, the Divine Child has also cultivated a secret technique that can increase one’s combat power for a short period of time if it is unleashed!</p><p>Xie nianjun continued.</p><p>“Why are you telling me this?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>Why would Xie nianjun suddenly be so kind as to tell the Divine Child’s Secret? one should know that Xie nianjun was also a member of the Tian Shen sect, and she was the Tian Shen sect’s saintess.</p><p>When Lu Ming first came to the yuan continent and entered the Emperor Cang’s Secret realm, Xie nianjun even ordered people to kill him. Now, he was so kind to remind him and tell him the divine son’s Secret.</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ming had doubts in his heart.</p><p>it’s still the same words. The divine wilderness is too small. It’s just a corner of the world. Today, it can be compared to the entire Azure continent, or even the entire Yuan continent!</p><p>At this moment, Xie nianjun’s eyes were burning with passion. in order to do all of this, I must first control the Tian Shen sect. However, with the Divine Child around, it will be even more difficult for me!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
