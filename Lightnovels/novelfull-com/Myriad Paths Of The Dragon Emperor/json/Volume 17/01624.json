However, he had also gained new knowledge in this battle. He had a new understanding of the great Dao of heaven and earth. As long as he digested it properly, he would definitely improve.</p><p>...</p><p>Soon, he returned to the Phoenix Palace and entered the mountain and river diagram. He sat cross-legged under the path-understanding ancient tree and began to comprehend quietly.</p><p>Two days later, Lu Ming finally ended his cultivation.</p><p>fighting with strong people and fighting to the death is indeed fast. It’s not something that bitter cultivation can compare with!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>&Nbsp; his Primal Chaos Domain had also improved.</p><p>“Then let’s continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and left the Phoenix Palace. He found a secret place, changed into the black robe and put on the Asura mask, and headed out of the city.</p><p>“It’s that Asura, he’s here again!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s arrival attracted many people’s attention.</p><p>After all, the battle between Lu Ming and the young master of blood prison two days ago had spread like wildfire.</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>Lu Ming was still as domineering as the last time. He fixed his eyes on a young man and threw a punch at him.</p><p>Through his aura, this young man should be an existence on the same level as the blood prison young master.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The other party shouted coldly and engaged in a fierce battle with Lu Ming.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming was still at a disadvantage and he exchanged more than a hundred moves with the other party.</p><p>“Brat, go to hell!”</p><p>At this moment, a beam of blood-red light rushed out of dark water city. It was the young master of blood prison. He had obviously heard the news and rushed out aggressively.</p><p>“I won’t accompany you today. We’ll fight again in two days!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and used the thundering wind steps. With a few flashes, he dodged the young master of blood prison and rushed into the dark water city.</p><p>“This guy is using us as whetstones!”</p><p>The young man who had fought with Lu Ming today said coldly.</p><p>No one would feel comfortable being used as a Whetstone by a Lv 9 martial Royal realm martial artist.</p><p>that person’s cultivation technique is very strange. The secret skill he used is the WAN family’s 10000 soldiers secrets. However, his domain doesn’t seem to be the 10000 soldiers domain. It’s very similar to the legendary Chaos Domain!</p><p>“There’s actually someone in this world who can cultivate the chaos Domain? It’s really shocking!”</p><p>“Moreover, his spirit body seems to be related to the nine Dragons!”</p><p>The young men around the lake were discussing.</p><p>These people were all prodigies from Emperor-level forces and naturally had unique judgment. Lu Ming’s territory and spirit body could not be hidden from these people.</p><p>it’s a great era today. I didn’t expect to meet someone who has cultivated the chaos Domain in the hundred clan battlefield. The chaos Domain is one of the ten strongest domains. In the future, when he cultivates a law, it will also be one of the ten strongest laws!</p><p>that’s right. I’ve heard that there are people who have successfully cultivated other ultimate maxims. If we can see the collision of ultimate maxims, how wonderful would that be? ”</p><p>The genius who fought with Lu Ming today mumbled to himself.</p><p>After Lu Ming entered Darkwater city, he changed into his disguise and headed to the Phoenix Palace.</p><p>He did not expect to run into Feng Ling looking for him the moment he returned to the Phoenix Palace.</p><p>“Lu Ming, there’s news on the map and key to the tomb of the Samsara King!”</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>“Oh, how is it?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he asked.</p><p>there is indeed more than one map and key to the tomb of the Samsara King. The map and key to the tomb of the Samsara King have appeared in different places and were obtained by different people. This matter has been spreading like wildfire in dark water city!</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>“Do you know who got it?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>I don’t know, but I’m sure that many of them are in Darkwater city!</p><p>Huang Ling shook her head.</p><p>it seems like they’re all waiting. Then, we don’t have to be in a hurry. Someone will definitely be the first to take the lead!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Huang Ling nodded and left after discussing with Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to cultivate in the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming would go out of the city every two days to challenge experts. Among them, he fought with the young master of blood prison the most. Although Lu Ming was at a disadvantage every time, the young master of blood prison could not do anything to him.</p><p>Just like that, a month’s time passed by in a flash.</p><p>In the past month, Asura’s name had spread throughout Darkwater city, becoming a famous battle maniac.</p><p>Everyone knew that Lu Ming was using those geniuses as a Whetstone. On the contrary, those geniuses were also using Lu Ming as a Whetstone, forcing themselves to work hard.</p><p>In the past month, Lu Ming had made rapid progress. He had already reached the peak of the ninth level martial Royal realm.</p><p>Therefore, in the end, when Lu Ming challenged those prodigies, his disadvantage was not so obvious anymore. He might even end up in a draw.</p><p>There were too many paragons in the hundred clan battlefield and there was no lack of opponents. That was why Lu Ming could improve so quickly.</p><p>If he was in the Azure continent, he wouldn’t have improved so quickly, because he didn’t have that many opponents.</p><p>The collision between geniuses would naturally encourage one to improve. Lu Ming’s improvement was especially obvious.</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming was cultivating in the mountain and river diagram. Suddenly, his heart stirred. There seemed to be some movement outside.</p><p>Lu Ming ended his cultivation and exited the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Gah!</p><p>As soon as he came out of the mountain and river diagram, a sharp cry came from the sky. It resounded through the world and reverberated between heaven and earth.</p><p>Lu Ming left the room and looked up at the sky. He realized that there were a few more Suns in the sky.</p><p>No, those were not the sun, but a few golden crows.</p><p>Divine birds, three-legged golden crows, there were several three-legged golden crows.</p><p>The three-legged golden Crow was also known as the divine bird of the sun. Like the true dragon and phoenix, it was also an extremely terrifying divine beast.</p><p>Yan kuangtu’s bloodline was the three-legged golden Crow.</p><p>A few three-legged golden crows were circling in the sky above Darkwater city. Their bodies were covered in golden flames, shining brightly like a sun.</p><p>“What’s going on? Why are those three-legged golden crows circling in the sky?”</p><p>In the Phoenix Palace, the disciples were also alarmed. They appeared in the sky one by one and looked up at the sky.</p><p>Huang Ling’s figure appeared beside Lu Ming.</p><p>Gah! Gah!</p><p>A total of four three-legged golden crows let out bright cries and then turned into four golden-robed young men, standing around the Darkwater city.</p><p>“Everyone, I, the Crown Prince of the Golden Crow race, have something to say to all of you!”</p><p>The four young men of the Golden Crow race spoke at the same time, and their voices echoed throughout the entire Darkwater city.</p><p>Gah!</p><p>At this time, an even louder golden crow’s cry resounded through the sky. A dazzling golden light filled the sky, and then a 10000-foot-tall figure appeared in the sky.</p><p>It was a young man, but he was not a physical being. Instead, he was formed from true Yuan and nomological power. He wore a golden robe with a sun embroidered on it. On his head was a golden crown. He was handsome, cold, and arrogant, and exuded a powerful Majesty.</p><p>“Greetings, tenth Prince!”</p><p>The four members of the Golden Crow race greeted the towering figure at the same time.</p><p>it’s the tenth Prince of the Golden Crow race. He’s extremely terrifying. His body is equivalent to a low-class heaven spiritual body, and he’s already reached the third stage of the half-Saint realm, the realm where the laws can be infused into his body!</p><p>Said Huang Ling, her eyes filled with solemness.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
