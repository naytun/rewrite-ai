It had been almost three years. What level had Lu Ming’s cultivation reached?</p><p>...</p><p>At least a high-level Martial Emperor?</p><p>haha, ninth Junior Brother, you’re finally back! We can fight side by side again!</p><p>Tian Chui laughed.</p><p>In his opinion, it would be a piece of cake for Lu Ming to get a spot.</p><p>seventh senior brother, eighth Senior Sister, how have you been? let’s have a drink after the challenge!</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Good, haha!”</p><p>Tian Chui and Xue ningxin both smiled and nodded.</p><p>“Lu Ming, who do you want to challenge?”</p><p>The hosting elder looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“He’ll do!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the room and landed on a silver-robed young man.</p><p>This man was obviously a proud Son of Heaven of Silver Dragon Valley. Who else could she pick?</p><p>“Hmph, Lu Ming, that was then and this is now. Three years ago, your combat strength was strong, but it may not be the same now!”</p><p>The young man stepped forward, and a powerful aura emanated from his body.</p><p>The aura of the peak Lv 9 martial Royal realm.</p><p>Moreover, since this person was chosen, his talent was naturally not bad. Even if he was not a superior earth spiritual body, he was at least a Medium Earth spiritual body.</p><p>“Make your move, I’ll give you the chance to make your move!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>In his opinion, the ninth level of the martial Royal realm was just a formality.</p><p>arrogant! Then I’ll send you down. Silver Dragon Claw!</p><p>The silver Dragon Valley’s Paragon bellowed. A layer of silver-white Dragon scales emerged on the surface of his body. He clawed at Lu Ming, leaving a terrible mark in the air.</p><p>In an instant, it was in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>so powerful. Let’s see how Lu Ming will crack it!</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming stretched out a hand. He moved later but reached first. He was as fast as lightning and grabbed the other party’s wrist. The other party’s arm and even his entire body stopped in the air.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The other party’s expression changed, and he suddenly roared. His entire body emitted a dazzling silver light, and a Dragon’s Roar sounded.</p><p>However, before his silver light could explode, Lu Ming swung his arm.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The other party was smashed to the ground, and the fighting ring made a violent roar.</p><p>With a wave of Lu Ming’s hand, the other party’s body was thrown out of the fighting ring like a broken sack. He fell to the ground with a dumbfounded look on his face.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>Many people were also dumbfounded.</p><p>The heaven’s pride expert at the peak of the ninth level martial Royal realm of Silver Dragon Valley was defeated just like that. It was too easy. Lu Ming did not even move a single step.</p><p>Although some people felt that Lu Ming would win in the beginning, they did not expect him to win so easily.</p><p>Could it be that Lu Ming had already broken through to the half-Saint realm?</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Humph! the master of Silver Dragon Valley snorted, his face gloomy.</p><p>“Haha, ninth Junior Brother, you’re amazing!”</p><p>Tian Chui laughed.</p><p>“Ninth Junior Brother, you’re so gentle!”</p><p>Xue ningxin said.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He had been merciful just now. Otherwise, the other party would have been dead.</p><p>Lu Ming won this round and entered the top twenty. Who else wants to challenge him? ”</p><p>The old host asked.</p><p>“Wait a moment!”</p><p>At this moment, a voice rang out in the fighting ring.</p><p>The hosting elder was stunned. He looked at one of the twenty people on the fighting ring and said, ” “Silver pine, do you have any questions?”</p><p>A young man in a silver robe stepped out with a cold and arrogant look on his face. He was the one who had called out for a moment.</p><p>elder, I don’t think Lu Ming is qualified to enter the twenty-person quota to participate in the treasure sealing assembly on behalf of the Dragon God Valley!</p><p>Silver pine said.</p><p>Bullsh * t! Yin Zisong, what right do you have to say that Junior Brother Lu Ming is not qualified to participate in the Dragon God Valley’s treasure fixing assembly? everyone can see Junior Brother Lu Ming’s strength!</p><p>Tian Chui was immediately enraged as he shouted.</p><p>“Hmph, what’s so great about having some strength!”</p><p>Yin Zisong snorted coldly, his cold and arrogant expression became even stronger, and said, ” everyone knows that Lu Ming is extremely daring and has offended the three major sects, the deity sect, the sky demon sect, and the Yu Du sect. If he also participates in the treasure sealing assembly, we will definitely be targeted by the three major sects. At that time, let alone seizing the first place, it would be good enough if we don’t come in last!</p><p>“Hmph, three years ago in the treasure auction, we were also competed against by the three great sects. How did we get first place in the end?”</p><p>Xue ningxin said sarcastically.</p><p>“That was then and this is now. The treasure determination meeting is just a small matter. The treasure determination meeting is where the true geniuses are gathered. In any case, the result of his battle with the divine Son has nothing to do with the treasure fixing assembly, and he’s bound to be killed. It’s better to directly find the divine Son and send him to his death, so why drag us down!”</p><p>Silver pine said.</p><p>Zisong is right. In my opinion, why don’t we just kill Lu Ming and give him to the divine Son to repair our relationship with the heavenly God sect!</p><p>The master of Silver Dragon Valley said coldly from his seat.</p><p>hahaha, if you want to curry favor with the heavenly God sect and become their dog, go ahead. No one will stop you. However, I’m not interested!</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly burst into laughter and looked at the master of Silver Dragon Valley in disdain.</p><p>“Impudent, How dare you!”</p><p>&Nbsp; ” you …! the master of Silver Dragon Valley was furious, and a powerful energy exploded from his body.</p><p>“The old dog is furious!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently, his tone full of disdain. Then, he turned his head and ignored the master of Silver Dragon Valley.</p><p>The master of Silver Dragon Valley was so angry that his chest heaved up and down. He wished he could kill Lu Ming with one slap. However, the experts of the Seven Valleys and the other Valley Masters were here. Naturally, he could not do that.</p><p>Many people sighed. Lu Ming was still Lu Ming. He was still so bold and direct. He called the cloud Dragon Valley master an old dog in front of everyone, just like three years ago.</p><p>“Everyone, you’ve all seen it for yourself. This kid has no respect for his elders. I suggest that we disqualify him, cripple his cultivation, and throw him into jail!”</p><p>The master of Silver Dragon Valley said coldly.</p><p>I think ninth Junior Brother is right. You’re clearly an old dog. As the master of a Valley, you actually want to send a disciple of Dragon God Valley to the deity sect as an apology. You’re really shameless. If you want to suck up to the deity sect, then leave. Just join the deity sect directly. It doesn’t matter if Dragon God Valley has you or not!</p><p>In the seating area, Longyuan Shan spoke coldly.</p><p>Now that he had broken through to the Saint realm, he would be acting as the valley master of Cloud Dragon Valley. He had great power and didn’t need to fear the valley master of Silver Dragon Valley.</p><p>“You … Your Cloud Dragon Valley is the cancer of Dragon God Valley!”</p><p>The master of Silver Dragon Valley said angrily.</p><p>“Alright, you’re an elder, what’s there to argue with a junior? Let’s continue watching the competition!”</p><p>A purple-robed old man said.</p><p>The purple-robed elder was the master of purple dragon Valley.</p><p>“That’s right. Yin long, you’re already so old, yet you still want to argue with me? Aren’t you afraid of being laughed at by the younger generation?”</p><p>The other Valley master also said indifferently.</p><p>The master of Silver Dragon Valley looked even gloomier. It was obvious that the other Valley Masters were on Lu Ming’s side.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>On the fighting ring, Tian Chui grinned. His laughter was extremely carefree, and it was particularly harsh to the ears of the master of Silver Dragon Valley.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
