If you have the ability, come and take it!</p><p>how arrogant! I’d like to see how much you’ve grown in three years!</p><p>...</p><p>A burly man in the first stage of the half-Saint realm of the tianshen sect stepped forward. A spear of divine punishment appeared and pierced toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were as cold as a knife. A holy weapon sword appeared in his palm.</p><p>Lu Ming’s holy weapon sword slashed out, and the sword light was shocking. The opponent’s spear of divine punishment was shattered by Lu Ming’s sword light. The sword light did not stop, and the man was cut in half, dying instantly.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He took a step forward and appeared in front of another middle-aged man from the tianshen sect who was at the first stage of the semi-sage realm. Then, he swung his sword again.</p><p>The man was frightened and retreated frantically. However, Lu Ming’s sword radiance still cut through his body, splitting it from the middle. His spiritual God had been destroyed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took a step forward and appeared in front of another powerhouse at the second stage of the half-Saint realm.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The second stage half-Saint expert roared. The laws circulated and holy light burst out, launching a terrifying attack at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, when Lu Ming’s battle sword slashed past, everything was illusory. The other party’s attack was instantly destroyed. This person followed in the footsteps of the previous two and was killed by Lu Ming’s sword.</p><p>The others gasped and retreated in shock.</p><p>One sword for one person, one sword for one person, one step for one person.</p><p>Regardless of whether they were at the first stage or the second stage of the half-Saint realm, they could not put up any resistance in Lu Ming’s hands. They were killed by Lu Ming’s sword one by one.</p><p>At this moment, the battle here had already alarmed the people in the distance, and many people had rushed over upon hearing the commotion.</p><p>it’s Lu Ming. Lu Ming is being surrounded!</p><p>it’s the people from the deity sect and the Yu Du sect. These two sects are really at loggerheads with Lu Ming. As long as they encounter him, they will fight to the death!</p><p>there are so many experts. Lu Ming is finished!</p><p>Many figures flew over. They were shocked to see so many experts besieging Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Attack together! Yu Du sect, attack together and kill Lu Ming!”</p><p>Within the heavenly Divine sect, a person shouted madly. This person was still wearing a black robe that had not been taken off.</p><p>“Kill! Attack together!”</p><p>There were more than 20 experts from the Yu Du sect and the deity sect. They were all half-step Saints. Five of them were at the second stage of the half-step Saint realm. All of them were charging toward Lu Ming.</p><p>All kinds of attacks were aimed at Lu Ming from both the front and back.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>All of a sudden, a few terrifying saber-lights slashed toward Lu Ming from the left. Each saber-light was filled with demonic Qi.</p><p>“The people from the Tian Yu demon sect are also here to join in the fun!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with a shocking murderous intent.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved and dodged the attacks from three sides. Then, like a Goshawk soaring through the sky, he pounced towards the experts of the tianshen sect. The combat sword in his hand slashed down.</p><p>A hundred-meter long sword light slashed towards the expert of the tianshen sect. The terrifying power made the expert of the tianshen sect extremely frightened.</p><p>“Join forces and block them!”</p><p>More than ten half-Saints of the tianshen sect joined forces to attack. More than ten beams of holy light gathered together and blasted toward Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s sword radiance cut through the Holy Light and killed three half-Saints in an instant.</p><p>Then, he slashed out with his sword and two more experts were killed.</p><p>“Ah, retreat, quickly retreat!”</p><p>The remaining people were almost scared to death. They frantically retreated. One of them took out a Saint weapon, which was a small mountain, and blocked in front of him.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s sword slashed at the hill, sending it flying and crashing into the man. The man was crushed into a meat patty by his holy weapon.</p><p>In just a few breaths, Lu Ming had killed six half-Saints of the deity sect. The people around were dumbfounded.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength had become even more terrifying. Compared to three years ago, he was much stronger. A half-Saint was like an ant in his hands.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming stepped into the air and charged towards the people from the desire poison sect. With a loud shout, the divine sword technique burst forth, and more than ten experts from the desire poison sect screamed in pain. Then, the sword light flashed, and all of them were killed.</p><p>Their poisonous bodies were completely useless in front of Lu Ming. Their souls were destroyed.</p><p>“Retreat, retreat!”</p><p>The remaining people, including the ones who were fighting Tian Chui and Xue ningxin, were all scared out of their wits. They didn’t dare to stay any longer and frantically fled in all directions.</p><p>“Shi Guan, since you’re here and you want to take my storage ring first, then you don’t have to leave!”</p><p>Lu Ming fixed his eyes on a black-robed man from the deity sect and walked towards him.</p><p>This person shouted and attacked together. Lu Ming immediately recognized him as Shi Guan.</p><p>Shi Guan turned pale with fright and fled frantically. However, Lu Ming’s speed was astonishing. He caught up with Shi Guan in a few steps and threw a punch at him. The force of his fist crushed Shi Guan.</p><p>Shi Guan used all his strength to block the attack. However, he was sent flying by Lu Ming’s punch. The black robe on his body burst open, revealing his true appearance.</p><p>It was indeed Shi Guan. At this moment, his face was filled with shock and his eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>Initially, he had brought an expert with the intention of snatching Lu Ming’s storage ring.</p><p>He had never expected that Lu Ming’s combat strength would reach such a terrifying level. The first and second stage half-Saints were like babies in Lu Ming’s hands. They could not withstand a single blow. A large number of them were killed as soon as he made a move. They suffered heavy losses.</p><p>Although there were no high-level spirit bodies among these people, Lu Ming’s combat strength was too terrifying.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming wanted to kill him.</p><p>He was no match for them.</p><p>Three years ago, Lu Ming was only at the LV 4 martial Royal realm. He could only run for his life when he was in his hands.</p><p>However, he might not even be able to escape from Lu Ming now.</p><p>In three years, everything had been reversed.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. The combat sword appeared in his hand again and he slashed at the stone crown.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The stone crown resisted with all its might.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>A loud shout came from the distance, causing the sky to rumble.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s sword momentum did not stop. He slashed down with all his might. In the midst of despair, the stone crown was killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the distance, there was a flash of holy light. A young and handsome man appeared in the air. His eyes fell on Lu Ming, filled with murderous intent.</p><p>“It’s Luo shuihan!”</p><p>Luo shuihan is here. This is going to be interesting!</p><p>Exclamations of shock rang out in the surroundings.</p><p>Junior Brother, be careful. This person is Luo shuihan, the strongest monster in the Cang region after the divine Son. She’s another peerless heaven’s favorite of the tianshen sect!</p><p>Tian Chui and Xue ningxin came to Lu Ming’s side and Xue ningxin said in a low voice.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Three years ago, a new peerless heaven’s pride emerged in the deity sect during the treasure determination assembly. At the treasure determination assembly, he overpowered everyone and was second only to the divine Son. He was ranked second among the ten great monsters.</p><p>When the divine Son broke through to the Saint realm and dropped out of the genius ranking, that person rose to the first place.</p><p>That sovereign was Luo shuihan.</p><p>Luo shuihan’s eyes swept across the scene, and the coldness in her eyes grew stronger.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
