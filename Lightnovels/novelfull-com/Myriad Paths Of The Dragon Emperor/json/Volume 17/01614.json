The undying phoenix body was not really undying. It was just that her life force was stronger. If her power had reached a certain level, she would still die.</p><p>...</p><p>“Even if you can defeat me and get the map, can you get out? There are three experts waiting outside.”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to speak, causing Huang Ling’s eyes to flicker even more.</p><p>After a while, Huang Ling’s gaze suddenly shifted and she revealed a smile. It was as beautiful as a peony blooming.</p><p>To be honest, the Phoenix Spirit was very beautiful. Among the people Lu Ming had met, only Xie nianqing and a few others could compare to her.</p><p>“Lu Ming, why don’t we join forces?”</p><p>Huang Ling said.</p><p>“Join forces? How do we join forces?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered as he asked.</p><p>let’s work together and get out of here. You have the map and I have the key. We can work together to find the tomb of the reincarnation Emperor and open it. We can share the treasures and inheritance in the tomb. What do you think? ”</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>“That’s a good idea. Alright, I agree!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a while and agreed.</p><p>There was no better way than this.</p><p>Lu Ming only had the map in his hands. Without the key, it was useless for him to get the map. With his combat strength, it was almost impossible to snatch the key from Huang Ling and escape from the encirclement of Wan Tiancheng and the other two.</p><p>Therefore, the best plan was to cooperate with Feng Ling.</p><p>Outside the cave, Wan Tiancheng’s group of three surrounded the cave with unsightly expressions.</p><p>Huang Ling, Lu Ming has a grudge against me. As long as you kill him and give me the map in his hands, we’ll join forces and rush out of here together. What do you think? ”</p><p>Suddenly, Wan Tiancheng opened his mouth, and his voice was transmitted into the cave.</p><p>Zhao Kuang and Sima Liang’s expressions changed.</p><p>If that was the case, they wouldn’t be able to stop Huang Ling and Wan Tiancheng if they joined forces.</p><p>Feng Ling, if you give me the map, I can work with you. In addition, I can agree to an additional condition of yours. As long as I can do it, I will not speculate!</p><p>Zhao Kuang immediately spoke up and promised even more generous conditions.</p><p>“Huang Ling, if you work with me, you can take more of the treasures in the tomb of the reincarnation King!” He said.</p><p>Sima Liang also spoke up, wanting to join forces with Feng Ling.</p><p>In their opinion, it would not be a problem for Huang Ling to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>In the cave, Lu Ming’s eyes flickered.”What they said might be a better idea for you. What do you think? Are you already tempted?”</p><p>“Who do you think I am? Was he going back on his word? Since I’ve agreed to join forces with you, I won’t go back on my word!”</p><p>Huang Ling’s beautiful eyes glared at Lu Ming and she said unhappily.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming seemed to be smiling.</p><p>“Of course!”</p><p>I need to recuperate now, ” Huang Ling said seriously. how about we rush out together after I’ve fully recovered? ”</p><p>“Rush out?”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment. After a while, a cold glint flashed in his eyes.”If you recover to your peak condition, can you hold back Zhao Kuang and Sima Liang for a few minutes?”</p><p>if I was at my peak and used my secret skill, I could hold them back for three minutes. I can’t do it any longer. What are you trying to do? ”</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>“Murder!” Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“Kill? To kill Wan Tiancheng?”</p><p>Huang Ling’s beautiful eyes widened.</p><p>“That’s right, but you’ll need to wait for a while!” Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Huang Ling’s eyes revealed a trace of shock. Lu Ming actually said that he wanted to kill Wan Tiancheng? She found it unbelievable.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation was only at the peak of the LV 8 Martial Emperor realm. How could he have killed ten thousand spirits?</p><p>“With my current cultivation, it is indeed very difficult, so I need to break through. And you, don’t you also need to heal your injuries?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>That’s right, wasn’t the puppet formation here the best place to train?</p><p>Since he was not in a hurry to go out, he might as well cultivate here. When he broke through to the ninth level Martial Emperor realm and killed Wan Tiancheng, he would have some confidence.</p><p>alright, then we’ll wait here for a while!</p><p>With that, Huang Ling walked to the side and sat down cross-legged, her body covered in flames as she began to heal her injuries, acting as if she trusted Lu Ming very much. Of course, she would not let her guard down. If Lu Ming did anything unusual, she would instantly unleash a powerful attack.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and returned to the mountain and river diagram. However, he stepped into the puppet formation.</p><p>All of a sudden, the puppets charged at Lu Ming and attacked him with terrifying attacks.</p><p>Lu Ming did not step into the weak point of the array to avoid it. Instead, he fought the puppets head-on.</p><p>However, these puppets could even injure Wan Tiancheng and the others, so their power was really strong. After a few moves, Lu Ming was injured and spat out blood. He had no choice but to retreat to the safe area beside the stone pillar.</p><p>At this moment, Huang Ling, who was recuperating, opened her eyes in surprise. the body of Nine Dragons? the bloodline you awakened before was the bloodline of Nine Dragons? ”</p><p>that’s right. The nine Dragons and the undying celestial Phoenix are both in the top ten Battle Beasts. The dragon and the phoenix are auspicious. Don’t you think we are a match made in heaven? ”</p><p>Looking at Huang Ling’s beautiful face, Lu Ming could not help but tease her.</p><p>“Oh, really? If your cultivation can catch up to mine, perhaps I can consider it?”</p><p>A strange look flashed in Huang Ling’s eyes as she smiled slyly.</p><p>“How long will it take for my cultivation to catch up to yours? It just so happens that there are puppets guarding the door now, so it’s an auspicious time. Why don’t we do some things now?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes darted all over Huang Ling’s curvaceous body. He walked towards her with a wicked smile.</p><p>“You … What are you trying to do? So you’re also a lecherous person, don’t come over!”</p><p>When she saw Lu Ming walking over, Huang Ling’s expression changed. Her body was filled with Phoenix Flames as she stared at Lu Ming nervously.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly laughed out loud. He turned and walked to the side, sitting cross-legged to recuperate.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Huang Ling gritted her teeth. She knew that she had been tricked by Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s injuries were not serious. Soon, his injuries were fully healed.</p><p>After he recovered, Lu Ming did not step into the puppet formation immediately. Instead, he fell into deep thought.</p><p>For now, he had the ten thousand soldiers scroll, thirteen stored attacks, the prison suppressing heaven skill, and the chaos sky-turning seal. That was enough for now.</p><p>Right now, he needed to cultivate a movement technique domain martial skill to make up for his lacking movement technique.</p><p>Lu Ming searched through Jiu Long’s memories, and soon, his eyes lit up.</p><p>He found a movement technique.</p><p>Wind Thunder steps!</p><p>In order to cultivate the thundering wind steps, one had to comprehend the domain of wind and lightning. This wasn’t a problem for them.</p><p>Wind Thunder steps combined the characteristics of wind and thunder. It moved like lightning and had the agility of the wind. It was a top-tier movement technique.</p><p>Lu Ming began to study it carefully.</p><p>A few hours later, Lu Ming stepped into the puppet formation again. More than a dozen puppets charged at him.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was covered in light spots. Ten holy weapons flew out. Lu Ming held a long spear in one hand and a combat sword in the other, and they attacked separately.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
