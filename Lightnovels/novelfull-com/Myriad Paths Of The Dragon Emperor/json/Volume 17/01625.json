Every muscle and even every cell in the body was filled with the power of the laws.</p><p>At this level, one’s physical strength would skyrocket, and their combat strength would be very terrifying. They were only half a step away from the Saint realm.</p><p>Huang Ling also had a lower-class heavenly spiritual body. She was a heaven’s favorite of the same level as her opponent. However, her cultivation was only at the second stage of the half-Saint realm. If she were to fight with her opponent, she would be defeated easily.</p><p>In the hundred clan battlefield, this kind of prodigy was almost the strongest. Even the strongest prodigies would rarely come to the hundred clan battlefield because they had no effect on training.</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince scanned the surroundings with a dignified gaze and said, ” I believe everyone has heard the news that the tomb of the reincarnation King is about to appear!</p><p>Many people were shocked. The first thing the Golden Crow tenth Prince said was about the tomb of the reincarnation Emperor. Could it be that he was doing this because of the tomb?</p><p>“Finally, someone can’t hold it in anymore!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and exchanged glances with Huang Ling.</p><p>I also know that some people have already obtained the map and key to the tomb of the reincarnation King. They are in the dark water city!</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince continued.</p><p>Many people’s eyes lit up as they understood that the tenth golden Crow Prince was going to take the lead.</p><p>however, the map and key of the tomb of the Samsara Emperor are divided into many parts. It is useless to get one part. Only by gathering them together can we find the tomb of the Samsara Emperor and get the treasures inside. I will take the lead today. I also have the map and key of the tomb of the Samsara Emperor. Tomorrow at noon, those who have the map and key of the tomb of the Samsara Emperor will come to the Golden Crow Palace to meet me. What do you think? ”</p><p>after all, if these maps don’t merge with the key, they’re useless. They’ll only become scrap!</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince added one last sentence before his massive figure disappeared into the air. The four golden Crow race members also disappeared into the air.</p><p>“How is it? Do you want to go to the Golden Crow Palace tomorrow?”</p><p>Huang Ling looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>of course we’re going. If we don’t go, our map and keys will be useless!</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>At this moment, the eyes of some people in Darkwater city flickered.</p><p>The entire Darkwater city was discussing this matter.</p><p>They did not speak for a day. At noon the next day, Lu Ming and Huang Ling headed to the Golden Crow Hall.</p><p>The Golden Crow Palace was also a temporary residence that the Golden Crow clan had bought in dark water city. It had a very wide area and was not smaller than the Phoenix Palace.</p><p>When Lu Ming and Huang Ling arrived at the square in front of the Golden Crow Palace, they realized that it was already crowded. Many paragons had gathered around the square.</p><p>There were also many locals.</p><p>Most of the people didn’t have the map or key to the tomb of the reincarnation King. They were just here to watch the show and see who had taken the key.</p><p>There were dozens of golden-robed young men standing on the square. They were all members of the Golden Crow race.</p><p>Among these people, there was a young man wearing a golden crown. He sat on a chair and looked around with a majestic gaze. He was the tenth Prince of the Golden Crow race.</p><p>Lu Ming and Huang Ling mixed in with the crowd and did not go out.</p><p>anyone who has the map and key to the tomb of the Samsara King can come out and see me!</p><p>The tenth Prince’s voice rang out.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>At this time, a figure stepped through the air and landed on the square.</p><p>It was a young man who appeared to be in his twenties. He had a slender figure, and his body was surrounded by streaks of lightning. His aura was overbearing.</p><p>it’s Ye Dongfang from the Thundergod sect!</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>“This person is very strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze also froze slightly.</p><p>The Thunderbolts surrounding ye Dongfang were all formed by the laws of Thunder. Once he launched an attack, it would be earth-shattering.</p><p>ye Dongfang is extremely terrifying. He’s no weaker than the tenth Prince of the Golden Crow!</p><p>Huang Ling sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Ye Dongfang, do you have the map and key to the tomb of the Samsara King?”</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince’s eyes shot out two rays of golden light as he stared at ye Dongfang.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Ye Dongfang’s palm glowed, and a jade talisman and a key appeared in his hands.</p><p>When she stood up, it was almost the same as the Jade talisman key that Lu Ming and Huang Ling had obtained.</p><p>“Take out your map and key!”</p><p>Ye Dongfang said.</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince smiled and with a wave of his hand, a jade talisman and a key appeared in his hands.</p><p>The shocking thing was that the Jade talisman and the key were different.</p><p>“You actually obtained two sets of maps and keys!”</p><p>Ye Dongfang’s eyes were filled with the power of lightning.</p><p>Around them, many elites were looking at the Jade talismans and keys in the hands of the Golden Crow tenth Prince and ye Dongfang with burning eyes.</p><p>But no one dared to do anything. Trying to lay their hands on the Golden Crow tenth Prince and ye Dongfang was no different from courting death.</p><p>three sets are obviously far from enough. Who else has the map and key to the tomb of the reincarnation King? ”</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince looked around.</p><p>“We!”</p><p>At this moment, two more figures stepped into the square.</p><p>Without a doubt, these two young men were extremely terrifying heaven’s favorites. Although they were not as powerful as ye Dongfang and the Golden Crow tenth Prince, they were on the same level as Huang Ling, the young master of the blood prison, and Wan Tiancheng.</p><p>A jade talisman and a key appeared in each of their hands.</p><p>Then, after a while, another person stepped out and took out a jade talisman and key.</p><p>After a while, another person walked out.</p><p>There was no doubt that those who had obtained the Jade talisman and key of the tomb of the reincarnation King were all extremely terrifying people. None of them were weaker than the young master of the blood prison. Wan Tiancheng was a heaven’s pride expert of the same level.</p><p>In total, there were six sets of Jade talismans and keys to the tomb of the Samsara King in the hands of the tenth golden Crow Prince.</p><p>The eyes of ye Dongfang, the Golden Crow tenth Prince, and the others lit up. If this continued, they might be able to gather the map and key to the tomb of the Samsara King.</p><p>“Is there any more?”</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince’s voice rang out again.</p><p>“Let’s go out!”</p><p>Huang Ling sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>The two of them stepped out and landed on the square, instantly attracting everyone’s attention.</p><p>that’s the Phoenix Spirit of the Phoenix Palace!</p><p>who’s that kid? he’s standing with fairy Feng Ling!</p><p>I know. That kid came to dark water city with Huang Ling. As soon as he arrived, he was assassinated by an assassin from the thousand kills mansion. However, that assassin was easily killed by him!</p><p>you dare to kill the assassins of the thousand-kill mansion? you’re quite bold!</p><p>The surroundings were filled with the sound of discussion.</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince’s gaze swept past Lu Ming and Huang Ling, then he ignored Lu Ming and looked at Huang Ling. “Feng Ling, do you have the key and the map of the tomb of the reincarnation King?”</p><p>“It’s not on me, it should be on the two of us!”</p><p>A key appeared in her hand while a jade talisman appeared in Lu Ming’s hand.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince, ye Dongfang, and the others were all taken aback.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
