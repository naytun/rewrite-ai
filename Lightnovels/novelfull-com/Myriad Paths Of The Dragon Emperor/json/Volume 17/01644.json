Lu Ming’s claw had grabbed his throat. A terrifying force blasted out and surged into Sima Liang’s body. Sima Liang’s essential core was scattered immediately. The bones in his body crackled and many of them were broken.</p><p>“Release … Let me go!”</p><p>...</p><p>Sima Liang’s eyes were filled with fear.</p><p>“I’ll let you go. I’ve already given you a chance. You’re the one who’s looking for death. I can’t help you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’d better let him go!”</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince said, his eyes shining with golden light and cold killing intent.</p><p>He was the one who freed Lu Ming from his grasp. He grabbed Sima Liang and made him feel very embarrassed.</p><p>“You want me to let him go? Who Do You Think You Are?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the tenth golden Crow Prince, not giving him any face at all. In his palm, a violent force suddenly burst out.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Sima Liang’s body exploded in Lu Ming’s hands. Then, he was crushed by the terrifying power and turned into ashes.</p><p>The others gasped.</p><p>How could Lu Ming’s abilities be so terrifying? Sima Liang’s abilities were definitely not weak. He was on par with most of the people at the scene. Yet, he could not even last one move against Lu Ming. He was as weak as a baby and could not fight back at all.</p><p>Young master Tianying, in particular, had spoken to Lu Ming earlier and was shivering.</p><p>it’s just a surprise attack by relying on soul attack techniques. You’re courting death!</p><p>kill! the Golden Crow tenth Crown Prince shouted coldly. With a flash of golden light, he pounced toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming actually dared to berate him? He simply didn’t know what death was!</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince’s claws transformed into the Golden crow’s claws, suffused with the divine Sun Fire. He clawed at Lu Ming, wanting to kill him with a single claw. His aura was terrifying.</p><p>On the side, Huang Ling wanted to help but was blocked by Tao tie.</p><p>The others looked on coldly.</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. He stood still and his palm was like a blade, slashing towards the tenth golden Crow Prince.</p><p>Lu Ming actually wants to fight the tenth golden Crow Prince in close combat. He’s really looking for death!</p><p>the body of the Golden Crow is extremely powerful to begin with. The body of the tenth golden Crow Prince is equivalent to a low-grade celestial spiritual body. Coupled with the infusion of the laws, it is even more terrifying. Lu Ming has no chance of winning in close combat!</p><p>Some people could not help but mock Lu Ming when they saw that he was going to take the tenth golden Crow Prince’s claw with his palm.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm landed on the claws of the tenth golden Crow Prince, and a metallic sound rang out.</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince’s expression changed drastically. He let out a furious roar and unleashed a flurry of claw shadows.</p><p>Lu Ming’s palms also struck out continuously.</p><p>In an instant, the two of them clashed head-on and exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>But what was even more shocking was that after a few dozen moves, the Golden Crow tenth Prince was forced to retreat. He took a few steps back before he could regain his balance. His palm was trembling slightly and there was blood flowing out.</p><p>In a head-on confrontation, he was no match for Lu Ming at all. His claws were cracked from the impact.</p><p>The others were dumbfounded.</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>In a head-on clash, Lu Ming actually had the upper hand in terms of physical strength, and he had injured the tenth golden Crow Prince.</p><p>“It’s my turn!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and charged toward the tenth Prince. His Chaos Domain, which had reached its peak, covered his entire body. He used the prison suppressing heavenly art and attacked the tenth Prince in a frenzy.</p><p>Gah!</p><p>With a screech, the Golden Crow tenth Crown Prince transformed into his true form. His entire body glowed with a golden light, like a small sun. He flapped his wings and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, as soon as he came into contact with Lu Ming, his body trembled as if it was torn apart. His divine Sunfire and the law of flames were completely suppressed by Lu Ming’s ultimate Chaos Domain.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Golden feathers were dancing in the sky.</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince was enraged. He reached out with three claws at Lu Ming, but was knocked back by Lu Ming’s punches.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was so powerful that he could suppress the tenth golden Crow Prince.</p><p>he’s made a breakthrough. He was already terrifying when he was in the ninth level of the martial Royal realm. Now that he’s broken through to the half-Saint realm, his combat strength must be even stronger!</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>“Taotie, come and help me!”</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince roared.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Taotie transformed into his true form and was about to rush up to help, but Huang Ling blocked him.</p><p>Huang Ling, let him come at me together. I’ll beat him up together today!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The Phoenix Spirit’s eyes shone with a strange light. Then, she really dodged. The Taotie roared and pounced towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and launched the divine sword technique. He then raised his hand and cast the chaos sky-turning stamp at the Taotie.</p><p>The primal Chaos sky-turning seal pressed down, almost crushing the Taotie town.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming was like a god of War as he launched a storm of attacks at the tenth golden Crow Prince. The tenth golden Crow Prince was forced to retreat and howl in anger.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming grabbed one of the Golden Crow tenth Prince’s wings, lifted it up, and threw it at the charging Taotie.</p><p>With a “bang,” the Golden Crow tenth Prince and the Taotie collided, and the sound of bones breaking could be heard.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the sky, a huge chaos sky-turning stamp appeared and pressed down on the Golden Crow tenth Prince and the Taotie.</p><p>The terrifying might caused the others to continuously retreat to the two ends of the bridge of helplessness, afraid of being affected.</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince and the Taotie howled as they fought back with all their might.</p><p>However, it was useless. Lu Ming had used all his strength to cast the chaos Empyrean seal. It was extremely powerful.</p><p>The bodies of the tenth golden Crow Prince and the Taotie trembled violently as they were forced to the ground and spat out large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>Everyone looked at each other with disbelief in their eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming was fighting one against two, and he had actually suppressed the Golden Crow tenth Prince and the Taotie so much that they were lying on the ground and vomiting blood. How was this possible?</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was strong. They were aware of this before. Now that Lu Ming had broken through, they had originally speculated that Lu Ming could fight with one of them or even win. However, he had completely crushed them. This was too terrifying.</p><p>They did not know that Lu Ming’s spirit body had refined a wisp of true chaos Qi. Although it was still a low-tier Celestial Spirit body, it was already equivalent to a medium-tier Celestial Spirit body.</p><p>Naturally, he would be able to completely crush the tenth golden Crow Prince and Taotie.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The Black Dragon Spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hands and he charged toward the Golden Crow tenth Prince and the Taotie.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince and the Taotie let out a loud roar as they suddenly charged towards the other side of the bridge of helplessness. They ran back the way they came from at an astonishing speed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered but he did not pursue.</p><p>At this moment, the others looked at Lu Ming with fear and solemness.</p><p>Even the other heaven’s favorites on the same level as the tenth golden Crow Prince were no exception!</p><p>“Lu Ming, your combat strength has become stronger. I’m no match for you at all!”</p><p>Huang Ling walked over and smiled.</p><p>“Let’s go out!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and did not say much. He walked back the way they came.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
