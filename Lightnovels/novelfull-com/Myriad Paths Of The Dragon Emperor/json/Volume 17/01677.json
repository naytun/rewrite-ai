In the Dragon God Valley, Lu Ming had made Yin Zisong kneel down with two shouts. Such a cultivation was simply unfathomable. These people naturally addressed Lu Ming as senior brother.</p><p>“Good, haha, then let’s go!”</p><p>The sage realm elder was overjoyed. After he shouted, he led everyone and flew towards the location of the treasure auction.</p><p>Lu Ming and Zi Feng also went together.</p><p>It was the same venue from three years ago. When Lu Ming and the rest arrived, they realized that the place was already full of people.</p><p>The other 12 sects had already arrived on the 13 circular platforms surrounding the fighting ring.</p><p>There was only one platform that was still empty. It was platform No. 10. Three years ago, Lu Ming and the rest were on that platform.</p><p>The Dragon God Valley disciples landed on the 10th platform, while the Saint elders flew into the pavilion behind.</p><p>Lu Ming and Zi Feng landed on the stands behind the tenth platform. Many Dragon God Valley disciples were already seated there.</p><p>“Ninth Junior Brother, come and sit here!”</p><p>Tian Chui and Xue ningxin had arrived as well. Tian Chui greeted Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming and Zi Feng were sitting beside Tian Chui and Xue ningxin.</p><p>hehe, your Dragon God Valley is finally here. I thought you were afraid and were cowards!</p><p>From the stands of the heavenly God sect, a cold gaze swept toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Luo shuihan had also arrived.</p><p>wait a minute. My Dragon God Valley will let the tianshen sect understand how to spell the word ‘cowardly turtle’.</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Luo shuihan’s eyes were filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re still as arrogant as ever. Wait a minute, don’t kill the disciples of Dragon God Valley because of you. There are a few beautiful women in there. It’ll be a pity if you kill them!”</p><p>A cold voice was heard. Lu Ming looked in the direction of the voice and a cold light flashed in his eyes.</p><p>Mo Yang!</p><p>The genius of the Tian Yu demonic sect had also come.</p><p>“Mo Yang, who ran faster than a dog in the heavenly wind Plains? You’ve forgotten so quickly!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>Mo Yang’s face stiffened.</p><p>Back then, in the Windy Plains, Lu Ming controlled the hurricane and chased him all over the place. He had been brooding over this matter. Now that Lu Ming mentioned it, his face turned even gloomier.</p><p>Hmph, Lu Ming, you’d better pray that you don’t meet me in this time’s treasure sealing assembly. Oh, I almost forgot that you still have to fight the divine Son later on. You’re dead anyway, and I can’t be bothered to argue with a dead person!</p><p>Mo Yang said coldly.</p><p>Many people’s hearts beat faster.</p><p>This time’s treasure auction had actually attracted so many powerhouses.</p><p>A few of the ten great demon-level geniuses had come.</p><p>The treasure settlement party had yet to start, but the few evildoers and Lu Ming were already at daggers drawn.</p><p>“Little Qing, you didn’t come?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the grandstand of the Tian Yu demonic sect and he was a little disappointed.</p><p>It seemed that Xie nianqing had not come to the Cang mountains yet. Otherwise, she should have guessed that Lu Ming would appear at the treasure auction. If Xie nianqing was here, he would definitely appear and look for him.</p><p>Now that he didn’t appear, he probably didn’t come.</p><p>junior brothers and sisters of the tianshen sect, today, please entertain the people of Dragon God Valley!</p><p>Luo shuihan’s voice was heard.</p><p>junior brothers and sisters of the Tianyu demonic sect, you must also ‘entertain’ the people of Dragon God Valley later!</p><p>Mo Yang also spoke coldly.</p><p>On the other side, the Yu Du sect’s people were also looking coldly at the Dragon God Valley’s people.</p><p>Many people were shocked. Could it be that Dragon God Valley was going to be targeted like three years ago?</p><p>Three years ago, Dragon God Valley produced Lu Ming. This time, who would the Dragon God Valley rely on?</p><p>Moreover, it was said that there was only one top-notch heaven’s favorite in Dragon God Valley. This time, Dragon God Valley would not be directly swept out of the competition and would not even be able to participate in the treasure auction, right?</p><p>In the stands, many disciples of Dragon God Valley who were at the seventh level Martial Emperor realm and above looked very upset.</p><p>“Hmph, detestable!”</p><p>Tian Chui gritted his teeth.</p><p>Lu Ming was the only one who looked calm. Zi Feng’s expression did not look too good either.</p><p>Not long after, a sage realm elder of the heaven God sect appeared and announced the rules of the competition and the rewards.</p><p>The reward this time was exactly the same as three years ago. It was still seven royal domain pills, which made many people’s eyes burn with desire.</p><p>Then, he announced the start of the competition.</p><p>The heavenly God sect still occupied the first platform and was the first to send a challenger.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A youth from the heavenly God sect leaped onto the fighting ring. A powerful aura emanated from his body. He was an expert at the LV 6 martial Royal realm.</p><p>He looked directly at the Dragon God Valley and pointed at a youth in the fourth level of the Martial Emperor realm. He said coldly, ” “You, come down and accept your death!”</p><p>Many people were shocked. It was exactly the same as three years ago. The tianshen sect sent their Masters to kill the disciples of the Dragon God Valley with low cultivation.</p><p>“Junior Brother, your life is more important!”</p><p>The leader of the Dragon God Valley team was a purple-robed young man from the purple dragon Valley.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The young man from Dragon God Valley nodded and jumped into the fighting ring.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The young man from the tianshen sect charged at the disciples of the Dragon God Valley.</p><p>The disciples of Dragon God Valley did not linger in the battle and rushed to the edge of the fighting ring.</p><p>“You won’t be able to escape, you’ll die!”</p><p>The young man from the tianshen sect attacked coldly. His speed exploded and he caught up with the disciples of the Dragon God Valley in an instant.</p><p>The difference in cultivation was too great. The disciples of Dragon God Valley could not even escape.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The young man from the tianshen sect condensed a spear of divine punishment in his hand and stabbed it toward the disciple of the Dragon God Valley.</p><p>The disciples of Dragon God Valley were dead!</p><p>Such a thought appeared in the minds of many people.</p><p>At this moment, a ray of light emanated from the body of the Dragon God Valley disciple and enveloped him. The next moment, his body trembled and disappeared. The next moment, he reappeared 300 meters away.</p><p>He was not far from the edge of the fighting ring.</p><p>The Dragon God Valley disciples rushed down the fighting ring like lightning.</p><p>“What a powerful life-saving spiritual talisman!”</p><p>Many people in the surroundings could see what was going on.</p><p>On the fighting ring, the disciple of the heavenly God sect snorted unhappily and returned to the first platform.</p><p>“I can’t believe there’s a life-saving spiritual talisman. I’m quite lucky, but there are still 35 people. Only one more person can live!”</p><p>Luo shuihan said coldly.</p><p>He didn’t notice the surprise in The Eyes of the Dragon God Valley disciples.</p><p>The Jade talismans that Lu Ming gave them were really useful. They immediately felt more confident and confident.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Next, it was the second platform’s sect challenge. The second platform was still the sky demon sect.</p><p>In fact, the landing platforms of the sects were almost the same as three years ago.</p><p>A young man from the Tianyu demonic sect stepped into the fighting ring and looked at Dragon God Valley.</p><p>“You, come down and accept your death!”</p><p>The youth from the Tian Yu demon sect, like the youth from the tianshen sect, challenged a disciple from the Dragon God Valley who was at the LV 4 martial Royal realm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
