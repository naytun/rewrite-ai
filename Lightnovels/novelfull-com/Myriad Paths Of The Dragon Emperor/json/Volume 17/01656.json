They thought that Lu Ming wanted to use their strength to temper himself in the hundred clan battlefield.</p><p>But now, after more than a year, Lu Ming was simply unfathomable in their eyes. Moreover, Lu Ming had saved them time and time again. Otherwise, they would not have been able to leave the hundred clan battlefield.</p><p>“There’s no need to thank me. I saved you all because I wanted to use your teleportation array to return to the Azure continent!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>The hundred clan battlefield was extremely far away from the Azure continent. Without a teleportation formation, it was unknown how long it would take to fly. The cloud continent was the continent closest to the Azure continent.</p><p>If he wanted to go back, he had to go to Yunzhou first, which was the closest.</p><p>Yun Xi, Yun que, and the others revealed a trace of embarrassment on their faces.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming said as he flew out of the hundred clan battlefield.</p><p>Yun Xi and the others quickly followed.</p><p>They were not far from the hundred tribes battlefield now. They flew out of the hundred tribes battlefield’s territory and appeared outside.</p><p>As soon as he flew out of the hundred clan battlefield, Lu Ming immediately felt that the chaotic laws between heaven and earth were clearer. He could control them more easily and naturally.</p><p>After all, the laws of the hundred clan battlefield were too chaotic.</p><p>the Saints outside the hundred clan battlefield are probably more powerful than the Saints inside!</p><p>Lu Ming had a thought in his mind.</p><p>In the hundred clan battlefield, the laws were chaotic. The Saints couldn’t control the laws as they pleased. The Saints outside were definitely stronger than those of the same level.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s go to the teleportation array!”</p><p>Yun Xi said.</p><p>“Wait a moment!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. Then, his glabella glowed. A large group of people suddenly appeared, giving Yun Xi and the others a big shock.</p><p>Especially after they sensed the cultivation of this group of people, their expressions changed even more.</p><p>The cultivation of this group of people was not weaker than theirs. They were all stronger than them. Some of their auras were as deep as mountains and unfathomable.</p><p>Heaven’s favorites, all of them are peerless heaven’s favorites.</p><p>Yun Xi and the rest widened their eyes in shock. Lu Ming actually had such a huge force. What exactly did Lu Ming experience in the hundred clan battlefield?</p><p>This group of people was, of course, Huang Ling, ye Dongfang, and the others.</p><p>The moment Huang Ling and the rest came out, they looked around.</p><p>“Yi, the nomological aura here isn’t from the hundred clan battlefield!”</p><p>“Hahaha, we’re out!”</p><p>When they sensed it, they could naturally sense that they were already out of the hundred clan battlefield. They were immediately overjoyed.</p><p>They were finally out of danger.</p><p>Although many people did not return in this direction, it would be easy for them to return once they were out of the hundred clan battlefield. All they had to do was waste a little more time.</p><p>Then, everyone expressed their gratitude to Lu Ming one after another. Yun Xi and the rest could only watch at the side, dumbfounded.</p><p>Lu Ming, with your talent, you will definitely leave the Cang state in the future. After all, the Cang state is too small. If you leave the Cang state in the future, you can come to the ancient Moon Holy Land to find me!</p><p>Huang Ling’s beautiful eyes flickered and she came to Lu Ming. There was a trace of reluctance in her eyes, but she hid it well.</p><p>“Ancient Moon Holy Land?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled. He had never heard of ancient Moon Holy Land!</p><p>“You’ve never heard of it?”</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>no, I came from outside the yuan continent. I don’t know much about the yuan continent. There aren’t many records about it in the ancient books of the Cang region!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“You actually came from the forsaken land?”</p><p>This time, not only Huang Ling, but the other geniuses were also shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming was such a prodigy. It was beyond their expectations that he came from the forsaken land.</p><p>“The forsaken land?”</p><p>Lu Ming was even more puzzled. Why had he not heard of any of the places that Huang Ling and the rest mentioned?</p><p>Back then, the cloud Dragon Valley master had given him a map of the dozens of States near Cang Prefecture.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let me tell you about the general geographical division of the world. Legend has it that there are nine Heavens and ten lands in the world!”</p><p>legend has it that the nine Heavens are not part of our primordial realm, but the heaven realm. Legend has it that the heaven realm and the primordial realm are twin worlds. The heaven realm is divided into Nine Heavens, while the primordial realm is divided into ten lands!</p><p>I don’t know about the nine Heavens of the heaven realm. After all, they are too far away from us. The ten lands of the yuan continent are the land of desolation, the land of crime, the land of ten thousand demons, the land of ten thousand demons, the land of divine beasts, the land of five elements, the land of barbarian heaven, the land of nine Serenities, the land of Yuan mountain, and the land of divine destiny!</p><p>the desolate land refers to the countless islands outside of the yuan continent. When put together, they are called the desolate land!</p><p>Huang Ling began to explain in detail.</p><p>outside the yuan continent, in the boundless ocean, the island of the endless continent is actually just a barren land of the ten lands? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was somewhat dumbfounded.</p><p>that’s right. We are currently in one of the ten lands, Yuan mountain!</p><p>Yuan mountain is extremely vast and incalculable. There are countless forces of all sizes, many Emperor-level forces, and countless blessed lands!</p><p>however, among all the paradisiacal lands, there are nine places that are the most famous. They are called the nine great Holy Lands. Each of the nine Holy Lands is a Holy Land for cultivation. The environment is unique and it far surpasses other places. The ancient Moon Holy Land is one of the nine great Holy Lands!</p><p>in every Holy Land, there are many powerful forces. My Phoenix Palace is in the ancient Moon Holy Land. In fact, the location of the hundred clan battlefield is within the range of the ancient Moon Holy Land. Therefore, the geniuses who come to the hundred clan battlefield to train are almost all from the ancient Moon Holy Land, as well as some of the large states near the ancient Moon Holy Land, and some Emperor-level forces!</p><p>Huang Ling continued to explain.</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a long sigh of relief, his eyes filled with shock.</p><p>He finally had a clear understanding of the yuan continent.</p><p>Vast, it was too vast.</p><p>The Azure state was already extremely vast, but it was only one of the many states near the ancient Moon Holy Land.</p><p>In ancient Moon Holy Land, there was clearly an even stronger force.</p><p>And Mount Yuan had nine sacred grounds, so how many continents were there? How big was the territory?</p><p>However, Mount Yuan was only one of the ten lands of the yuan continent.</p><p>How many geniuses and experts were there in this vast territory?</p><p>No one knew that in this vast land, every day, there would be experts dying and experts being born. Geniuses rose up, each of them experiencing their own joys and sorrows.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with strong anticipation.</p><p>The Azure continent was still too small. In the future, he would definitely leave the Azure continent and explore the outside world.</p><p>“Brother Lu, in the future, when you reach the Gu Yue Holy Land, remember to find me, we can drink to our hearts” content!”</p><p>Ye Dongfang said.</p><p>The Thunder God sect was also in the ancient Moon Holy Land.</p><p>Immediately, the other paragons also extended invitations to Lu Ming.</p><p>However, only a small number of forces came from ancient Moon Holy Land. The other forces were all Emperor-ranked forces around ancient Moon Holy Land.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
