Under the pressure of the giant seal, the Assassin’s body cracked and his soul was destroyed.</p><p>The other Assassin’s expression changed drastically. He wanted to escape, but he couldn’t. The Tai Chi formation disk was a treasure on the same level as monarch weapons. It contained a terrifying heaven and earth formation that could be used to refine the second body.</p><p>The longer he used it, the more he studied it, and the more power he could unleash.</p><p>The assassin in black couldn’t even protect himself in the Tai Chi formation disk. He was already injured, so how could he break out?</p><p>After Lu Ming killed one of the assassins in black, he walked toward the remaining assassin.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With the primal Chaos sky-turning seal launched, the result was already without suspense.</p><p>“My thousand kills mansion will never let you go!”</p><p>Before the assassin died, he let out an unwilling roar. Then, under the chaos sky-turning seal, his body and soul were destroyed.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, the two assassins ‘storage rings were caught in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>now that my Chaos Domain has broken through to level eight, I can find a place to cultivate and raise my cultivation to the LV 8 Martial Emperor realm!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. With a flick of his fingers, two balls of flames flew out and burned the two assassins ‘corpses into ashes. Then, he spread his black wings and rushed out of the crack. After flying for a while, Lu Ming rushed into a huge mountain and entered the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>He took out a large pile of raw gemstones and started to devour and refine them to improve his cultivation.</p><p>After a few days, Lu Ming’s cultivation had successfully broken through and entered the early stage of the LV 8 martial Royal realm.</p><p>“Let’s see if there’s anything good in these guys” storage rings!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out a few storage rings. Some belonged to the young man in purple from the WAN family, and some belonged to the assassins from the thousand-kill mansion.</p><p>Lu Ming first looked at the storage ring of the assassin from the thousand kills mansion.</p><p>there are so many treasures. It’s a pity that I don’t have the cultivation method of the thousand-kill mansion!</p><p>After Lu Ming counted the items, he was a little excited but also a little regretful.</p><p>There were too many treasures in the storage rings of the assassins from the thousand-kill mansion. There were more than 15 Saint weapons in the storage rings of the two half-Saint assassins.</p><p>It was even more than the Holy weapons that Lu Ming and the others had obtained from the Dragon Palace’s Treasury.</p><p>However, thinking about it, it was normal. These two assassins from the thousand-kill mansion had killed countless geniuses in the hundred clan battlefield. Generally, those who entered the hundred clan battlefield were geniuses from various Emperor-ranked forces. Each of them had more or less a Saint weapon. It was not surprising that the two assassins had so many Saint weapons in their storage rings.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was very interested in the cultivation method of the thousand-kill mansion. That kind of assassination technique was extremely shocking. It could kill people in an instant and was impossible to guard against. It was a pity that he did not see it.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took out the storage ring of the young man in purple from the WAN family.</p><p>The young man in purple from the WAN family also had two holy weapons in his storage ring. Of course, what attracted Lu Ming the most was a box with a Jade tablet inside.</p><p>“The ten thousand soldiers art!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The WAN family’s cultivation method was even more wondrous. They could actually seal spirit weapons and Saint weapons within their bodies. The Qi of the weapons and battle weapons would combine to form a terrifying power. This had left a deep impression on him.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately started to watch it seriously.</p><p>“Amazing, amazing, truly amazing!”</p><p>After a while, Lu Ming finished reading and sighed.</p><p>The WAN family’s ten thousand soldier art was indeed wonderful. One could seal a spirit weapon or a Saint weapon into one’s acupuncture point. With the weapon in the acupuncture point, the battle weapon Qi would connect with each other, and terrifying power could be unleashed.</p><p>Furthermore, with every additional weapon that was sealed in, the power would increase with it, and it would never end.</p><p>There were three hundred and sixty major acupuncture points and countless minor acupuncture points on the human body. If he sealed all of them into a weapon, how terrifying would the power be?</p><p>The higher the level of the sealed weapon, the more powerful it would be.</p><p>Of course, sealing a weapon into the acupoint required a strong body. The stronger the spirit body and the higher the cultivation, the more Saint weapons would be sealed and the higher the level.</p><p>The two young men in purple from the WAN family could only seal Emperor spiritual weapons in it. One of them had sealed eighteen Emperor spiritual weapons.</p><p>It was obvious that the young man’s body was not strong enough. If he tried to seal the Holy weapon by force, the power of the Holy weapon would probably burst his body.</p><p>However, just sealing eighteen Emperor spiritual weapons was already extremely terrifying. Even Yun Xi wasn’t his match with her Saint weapon.</p><p>As for the noble young man, he was even more terrifying. He had sealed twelve holy weapons, and no one knew if he had more.</p><p>However, the noble young man had the heavenly spirit body and his cultivation had reached the second stage of the half-Saint realm. It was not surprising that he could seal 12 Saint weapons.</p><p>Furthermore, there was an extremely harsh condition for practicing the ten thousand soldiers scroll. One had to practice the ten thousand soldiers domain before they could practice the ten thousand soldiers scroll.</p><p>The 10,000 soldier realm was a terrifying realm that could transform one’s realm into different weapon realms, such as a sword realm, a blade realm, a spear realm, and so on.</p><p>Otherwise, he would not have been able to fuse so many different weapons into it.</p><p>If one didn’t cultivate the 10000 soldiers territory, they wouldn’t be able to cultivate the 10000 soldiers manual.</p><p>No wonder the WAN family was so assured to carry the ten thousand soldier scroll with them, because even if other people went, they couldn’t cultivate it.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s face revealed a smile.</p><p>Ten thousand soldier domain? Lu Ming cultivated the chaos realm. Other than a few top-notch realms, Lu Ming could transform any realm in the world, let alone the various weapon realms.</p><p>Naturally, he could convert various tool domains. This ten thousand soldiers art was simply too suitable for Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately started to study it in detail. If he cultivated the ten thousand soldiers scroll, he would have one more cultivation technique.</p><p>Two days later, Lu Ming was done with his comprehension. The Black Dragon Spear appeared in his hands.</p><p>Lu Ming was about to start sealing the Holy weapon into his acupuncture points.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming’s spiritual body was a heavenly spiritual body. There was a trace of chaotic Qi in his spiritual body, which was stronger than a heavenly spiritual body of the same level. He was confident that it would not be a problem to fuse it with a holy weapon.</p><p>“Acupoint, open!”</p><p>Lu Ming immediately activated the ten thousand soldiers art.</p><p>On his right palm, there was a spot of light that was shining brightly. It was a major acupuncture point on his right palm.</p><p>The human body had three hundred and sixty major acupuncture points all over the body.</p><p>“Seal!”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming let out a soft cry. The Black Dragon Spear quickly shrunk and entered the acupuncture point on Lu Ming’s palm. Instantly, Lu Ming felt a powerful combat weapon Qi wildly attacking his acupuncture point, causing him to feel a sharp pain.</p><p>If one’s physical body wasn’t strong enough and their cultivation wasn’t profound enough, their physical body would be torn apart by the combat weapon Qi.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had the heaven spiritual body and his physical body was extremely strong. Although he felt some pain, he suppressed it immediately. After a while, the Black Dragon Spear quieted down and floated quietly in the acupoint.</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind sank into it and realized that the acupoint on his palm was like a world of its own. The Black Dragon Spear was suspended quietly in it. With a single thought, the Black Dragon Spear would appear in Lu Ming’s palm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
