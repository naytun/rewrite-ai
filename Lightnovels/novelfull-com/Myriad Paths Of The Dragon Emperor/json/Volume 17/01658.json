The more he cultivated, the slower the speed of sealing the Holy weapons became. The more holy weapons there were, the stronger the battle weapon Qi formed would be. The burden on his body would be greater. Lu Ming had to take each step carefully and carefully.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming successfully sealed thirty-six holy weapons. At this point, Lu Ming finally felt that he had reached his limit and stopped.</p><p>...</p><p>When Wan Tiancheng was in the second stage of the half-Saint realm, he had only sealed 14 holy weapons. The difference between him and Lu Ming was too great.</p><p>The battle weapon Qi of the 36 Saint weapons had reached a terrifying level of power.</p><p>After cultivating the ten thousand soldiers scroll, he began to comprehend the chaos laws and the chaos sky-turning seal.</p><p>Now, the primal Chaos sky-turning seal had already reached the peak of the fifth level. It was not far from the sixth level, the perfected level.</p><p>Time passed, and another few days went by.</p><p>The space-breaking flying shuttle was flying in the sky.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>All of a sudden, a dazzling sword light flashed below, attracting Lu Ming’s attention.</p><p>Lu Ming walked to the side of the crystal glass and looked outside. He suddenly raised his eyebrows. He saw a familiar face.</p><p>Su Lei!</p><p>Back then, when he was cultivating on the sky-reaching floating platform in the Dragon God Valley, he had a bet with the Silver City of the silver Dragon Valley. Later on, the Silver City reneged on the bet and even made a false accusation. At that time, no one dared to testify for Lu Ming. In the end, it was the timid little girl who came out and testified for Lu Ming. That little girl was su Lei. Lu Ming had a deep impression of her.</p><p>At this moment, su Lei was being chased.</p><p>There was a young girl with su Lei. The two of them fled in a hurry, and more than a dozen burly men chased after them.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped out of the space-breaking flying shuttle. He waved his hand and kept the space-breaking flying shuttle. Then, he flew towards su Lei.</p><p>su Lei, you won’t be able to escape today. You’d better obediently follow us back to the SU family, lest you suffer physical pain!</p><p>Behind su Lei, a big man said with a gloomy face.</p><p>Su Lei gritted her teeth and flew forward at high speed without saying a word.</p><p>“Hmph, don’t even think about it. You despicable people, the young lady will never go back with you!”</p><p>The young girl beside su Lei said loudly.</p><p>“Little girl, How dare you? what do you know? It’s an honor for you to contribute to the SU family if you go back!”</p><p>The burly man roared. Their speed became faster and faster as they approached su Lei and her husband.</p><p>Su Lei and the young woman’s faces became paler and paler.</p><p>“Junior Sister su Lei, how have you been?”</p><p>At this moment, a clear voice was heard. Su Lei was stunned. Then, she saw a young figure in a black robe descending from the sky, his long hair flying in the wind.</p><p>“Lu … Senior brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>Su Lei blurted out in surprise. She did not expect to meet Lu Ming here.</p><p>Then, su Lei’s expression changed and she shouted, ” “Senior brother Lu Ming, leave quickly …”</p><p>However, before he could finish his sentence, Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he suddenly appeared between su Lei and the burly men.</p><p>The burly men charged at Lu Ming. The leader of the group shouted, ” “Brat, get lost!”</p><p>With that, he stretched out a large hand and grabbed Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and waved his hand. A quintessential essence wall formed in front of him.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The burly man grabbed the Zhen Yuan wall like an ordinary person’s hand. He grabbed a steel plate with all his strength, but he was stronger. With a crack, the burly man’s finger broke.</p><p>Moreover, because they were charging forward too quickly, each and every one of them hit their heads on the Zhen Yuan wall.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The scene was very spectacular. The dozen burly men flew at high speed and suddenly crashed into the Zhen Yuan wall. Each of them was dizzy from the impact and fell to the ground, bleeding from their mouths and noses.</p><p>Some people even broke their noses.</p><p>Su Lei and the young woman were dumbfounded.</p><p>After a long while, the dozen burly men finally reacted. The leader shouted, ” kid, this is an internal matter of the SU family. It has nothing to do with you. Get lost!</p><p>Although he was shouting, his eyes were filled with solemness.</p><p>Although the dozen of them did not attack the quintessential essence wall that Lu Ming had conjured, they were surrounded by their quintessential essence and territory. When they crashed into it, the quintessential essence wall did not budge at all. On the other hand, they were all bruised and battered, looking extremely pathetic.</p><p>“Are you from the same clan as Junior Sister su Lei?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze shifted to su Lei.</p><p>Su Lei blushed and nodded slightly.</p><p>boy, did you see that? this is a private matter of the SU family. Get lost. We have to bring su Lei back to the SU family!</p><p>The leader of the men shouted.</p><p>“No, no, I don’t want to go back to the SU family!”</p><p>Su Lei shook her head.</p><p>“Today, you have to come back even if you don’t want to. Brothers, let’s attack together!”</p><p>The leader of the men shouted.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes and he took a step forward.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The sky rumbled, and a terrifying force charged toward the dozen or so burly men.</p><p>The strongest of the dozen burly men was only at Lv 8 martial Royal realm. In front of Lu Ming, they were like ants, unable to withstand a single blow.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>More than ten burly men were sent flying, each of them puking blood as they looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>This young man was so powerful!</p><p>“Su Lei, so what if you have a helper? Don’t forget that your mother is still in the SU family. If you don’t come back, your mother will die because of you!”</p><p>The leader of the large men said fiercely.</p><p>Instantly, su Lei’s pretty face turned pale and tears welled up in her eyes. She said, ” “You guys … Don’t hurt my mother!”</p><p>“Hmph, you’d better think about it carefully. Let’s go!”</p><p>The burly man snorted and turned around to leave.</p><p>“Did I let you go?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>This made the dozen or so burly men’s faces turn pale, revealing a look of fear.</p><p>“Senior brother Lu Ming, let them go. Otherwise, my mother …”</p><p>Su Lei said from the side.</p><p>The dozen burly men quickly flew forward and disappeared. Lu Ming did not give chase.</p><p>“Junior Sister su Lei, what happened? Are those people from the same clan as you?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“I … I …”</p><p>Su Lei pondered for a moment and said,”senior brother Lu Ming, it’s nothing.” I’ll handle this matter myself, you should leave!”</p><p>“Junior Sister su Lei, you’re afraid of implicating me, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked directly.</p><p>This timid girl was very kind and did not have any schemes. Lu Ming could tell what she was thinking at one glance.</p><p>Su Lei twisted her hands together and didn’t speak for a while.</p><p>young lady, what’s there to hide? those people are despicable and shameless. For their own sake, they would sacrifice you, young lady. What fellow clansmen? bah!</p><p>The young girl beside him said unhappily.</p><p>This girl was su Lei’s maidservant. Her name was su Cha, and her personality was the complete opposite of su Lei’s.</p><p>A sharp glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes.”Young lady, tell me, what’s going on?”</p><p>alright, young miss is kind-hearted. Let me say it. It’s like this …</p><p>Su Cha began to talk.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
