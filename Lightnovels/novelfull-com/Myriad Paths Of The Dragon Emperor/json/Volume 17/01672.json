You need to call our Deacon over. Please wait a moment!</p><p>The young woman said. Then, she took out a voice transmission jade talisman and sent a message.</p><p>...</p><p>Soon, an old man with white hair came to the counter.</p><p>The elder exuded a faint holy aura. Lu Ming speculated that the elder must be in the Saint realm.</p><p>The old man picked up Lu Ming’s storage ring and scanned it with his spiritual senses. His expression changed slightly and he began to examine it carefully.</p><p>After a while, the old man sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming,”Little brother, although this absolute Saint divine beast’s corpse has been dead for many years and lost a lot of its spirituality, its overall price is still higher than a flying shuttle that can travel at five times the speed and the 1500 kilogram Supreme Saint true dragon Bone. Are you sure you want to trade?”</p><p>“I’ll exchange!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>The goshawk’s corpse was not of much use to him, so he might as well exchange it for something useful.</p><p>alright, little brother. I won’t let you suffer any losses. I’ll add another nine drops of true dragon blood essence at the great circle of the bright Saint stage for you!</p><p>The old man smiled and passed the other storage ring to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming took it and scanned it with his spiritual senses. He realized that the space-breaking flying shuttle was already in the storage ring. Other than that, there was also a huge Jade box that contained a pile of dragon bones. There was also a Jade bottle. Presumably, it contained nine drops of true dragon blood essence of a perfected bright sage.</p><p>“Thank you, senior!” Lu Ming kept it and cupped his fists.</p><p>no need to be so polite. Little brother, you have to be careful. I’m afraid someone will be watching you!</p><p>The old man reminded.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and swept his gaze across the room. He realized that many pairs of eyes were looking at him.</p><p>Although Lu Ming and the rest were making the transaction through voice transmission and the people around them could not hear what they were saying, Lu Ming had previously said that he wanted to buy a space-breaking flying shuttle that was five times faster.</p><p>Even Saints would be jealous of such a treasure.</p><p>Also, a Deacon of the Supreme treasure Pavilion came after him. What exactly was the item that Lu Ming took out? He actually needed the deacon of the Supreme treasure Pavilion to come out?</p><p>Lu Ming definitely had valuable treasures on him!</p><p>Many people had such thoughts, and their eyes were burning with passion.</p><p>“Junior Brother, it seems like we’re being watched again!”</p><p>Tian Chui said, his eyes flashing with a sharp glint.</p><p>“Isn’t that just right? If we kill a batch before the final assembly, wouldn’t it be even easier during the final assembly?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Of course, they were also communicating through voice transmission.</p><p>Tian Chui and Xue ningxin’s eyes revealed a trace of malevolence.</p><p>“Let’s go outside and stop them!”</p><p>alright, then Lu Ming must have some valuable treasures on him. They’re ours!</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two were communicating through voice transmission. The others were also communicating in secret.</p><p>Then, a group of people left the treasure Pavilion silently and waited at the path that Lu Ming and the rest had to take.</p><p>The three of them continued shopping.</p><p>Tian Chui and Xue ningxin had both bought some items.</p><p>The three of them had bought what they needed and were satisfied. They left the treasure Pavilion and headed in the direction of Dragon God Valley.</p><p>As soon as the three of them left the Supreme treasure Pavilion, a group of people followed behind them silently.</p><p>“As expected, they followed us!”</p><p>Xue ningxin sneered.</p><p>“I hope there are people from the heaven God sect!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>If there were people from the heavenly God sect, he could kill them in broad daylight.</p><p>He and the tianshen sect had long been irreconcilable enemies. If he could kill more, why not?</p><p>The people behind him did not make a move immediately. They kept following him. It was obvious that they wanted to make a move only when they were far away from the Supreme treasure Pavilion.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two flew forward unhurriedly. Soon, they saw a group of people in black robes blocking their way.</p><p>The three of them stopped.</p><p>The people behind him also surrounded him.</p><p>“You’re finally here. Lu Ming, hand over your storage ring!”</p><p>A person in front of him coldly spoke.</p><p>it’s a robbery again. He’s been using this trick every day. He did it three years ago, and now he’s doing it again. He really hasn’t changed!</p><p>Tian Chui grinned.</p><p>“If you want it, then come and get it yourself!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>“Hmph, Lu Ming, since you’re looking for death, I’ll grant it to you. There’s no need to wait for you to fight the divine Son. I’ll kill you now!”</p><p>Lu Ming! the person said coldly. Then, a few people stepped out and closed in on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, he’s ours!”</p><p>Behind them, there were also people who forced their way over.</p><p>Junior Brother Lu Ming, do it later. Let me have some fun first!</p><p>The malevolence in Tian Chui’s eyes grew even stronger.</p><p>“Tian Chui, you deal with the front, I’ll deal with the back!”</p><p>A layer of dragon scales began to appear on her body. She took a step forward and rushed back.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>With a Dragon’s Roar, Xue ningxin turned into a Snow Dragon. Her body was pure white, and she emitted a shocking cold air as she clawed out.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>A black-robed man at the LV 9 martial Royal realm was killed by Xue ningxin.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Tian Chui shouted in front of him. A huge hammer appeared in his hand and he smashed a black-robed man who was at the peak of the ninth level Martial Emperor realm into a meat pie.</p><p>“Half-Saint, they are half-Saints!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Tian Chui and Xue ningxin shouted, their killing intent surging like a tide as they launched a storm of attacks towards the black-clothed men.</p><p>A few more people were killed in succession.</p><p>so what if he’s a half-Saint? kill him!</p><p>Another black-robed man rushed out, exuding a shocking aura.</p><p>Half-Saint, they were all half-Saints.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The people behind him exploded with a shocking amount of poison Qi and charged towards Xue ningxin.</p><p>The powerhouses in front of him were all bathed in holy light, and their killing intent was cold.</p><p>“Heaven deity sect, Yu Du sect, it’s really you!”</p><p>Tian Chui and Xue ningxin shouted.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying collision resounded. Tian Chui and Xue ningxin’s combat strength was extremely strong, and their attacks were like crazy, forcing the other party to retreat.</p><p>But soon after, more people joined in.</p><p>This time, there were at least a hundred people surrounding them, and there were still quite a few people who had yet to make a move.</p><p>The people who attacked later were more powerful. Lu Ming even saw the power of law flowing around a few of them.</p><p>He was a master at the second stage of the half-Saint realm.</p><p>Tian Chui and Xue ningxin were besieged by six or seven experts, all of whom were at the half-Saint realm. Moreover, there was an expert at the second stage of the half-Saint realm who was able to stop Tian Chui and Xue ningxin.</p><p>“Since the heaven deity sect and the Yu Du sect have already been exposed, why do they need to hide? Show your true form!”</p><p>Lu Ming stood in the air and spoke calmly, his voice spreading throughout the entire area.</p><p>“Hmph, so what if you reveal your true form?”</p><p>Someone said coldly. Then, he pulled off his black robe, revealing his true appearance.</p><p>Then, more and more people took off their black robes and revealed their faces.</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze across them. Many of them were older. Most of them were middle-aged and only a few of them were from the younger generation.</p><p>Looking at their clothes, they were from the desire poison sect and the heavenly God sect.</p><p>“Lu Ming, hand over your storage ring and I’ll let you live for a few more days!”</p><p>On the side of the heavenly God sect, a few middle-aged burly men stepped through the air and headed toward Lu Ming. The Holy Light was thick.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
