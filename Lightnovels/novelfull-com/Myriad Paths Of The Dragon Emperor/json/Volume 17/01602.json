Roar! Roar!</p><p>The roars of the demonic creatures could be heard from all directions. However, due to the prison defending monument, these demonic creatures avoided Lu Ming.</p><p>...</p><p>there are so many powerful demonic creatures! There’s more than one Saint realm demonic creature!</p><p>Lu Ming sensed his surroundings and was secretly shocked.</p><p>He could sense several terrifying demons here, exuding powerful Saint might.</p><p>Fortunately, he had the prison-suppressing stele to deter these demonic creatures. Otherwise, he would have been killed by the demonic creatures before he could even walk in.</p><p>“That is … Dragon Bone!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he strode forward.</p><p>A bone Gu that was a few hundred meters long lay on the ground. There were five dragon claws under its belly. If it was not a true dragon Bone Gu, what else could it be?</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. There were really dragon bones here.</p><p>“As expected, the loss of spiritual essence is very serious!”</p><p>Lu Ming walked to the side of the Dragon Bone and sensed it carefully. He sighed slightly.</p><p>Although the Dragon Bone was huge, there was not much spiritual essence left. It would probably be difficult for his Dragon God combat body to evolve.</p><p>there should be more than one dragon Bone here. Let’s look for it again!</p><p>Lu Ming started to look around.</p><p>This plot of land was extremely large and was covered with bone armor. The sky was also filled with a faint demonic Qi that obstructed one’s vision.</p><p>Lu Ming could only search slowly.</p><p>As expected, Lu Ming found another Dragon Bone not long after. Similarly, it had lost a lot of its spiritual essence. Lu Ming dragged this Dragon Bone to the previous one and placed the two together.</p><p>He then continued his search.</p><p>Half a day later, Lu Ming found a total of ten huge dragon bones.</p><p>These dragon bones were definitely above the Saint realm when they were alive. They might not be just bright Saints, but even stronger.</p><p>But they all died in battle.</p><p>After finding the ten dragon bones, Lu Ming walked one more round, but he did not find any new Dragon bones.</p><p>it seems that these are the only dragon bones here. Ten dragon bones should be enough!</p><p>There was a look of anticipation in Lu Ming’s eyes as he returned to the pile of dragon bones.</p><p>The ten dragon bones were stacked together like a small mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately sat cross-legged and his devouring power burst forth, enveloping the pile of dragon bones. He devoured the spiritual essence in the Dragon bones and began to cultivate the Dragon divine combat body.</p><p>It was the perfect place to cultivate. The prison-suppressing stele was floating in the air. The demonic creatures didn’t dare to get close to it, and other Warriors couldn’t get in. It was the perfect place to cultivate.</p><p>The essence of the dragon Bone was constantly being devoured and refined by the devouring power, seeping into Lu Ming’s spirit body.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was emitting a faint glow, and a faint Dragon’s Roar could be heard.</p><p>The spiritual essence in the Dragon Bone continued to gather in Lu Ming’s body and seeped into the depths of his physical body. As long as it accumulated to a certain extent, Lu Ming’s spirit body would undergo a qualitative change and achieve an upgrade, reaching a higher level in one go.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming focused on cultivation. Time flew by and in the blink of an eye, half a month had passed.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar shook the nine Heavens as it emanated from Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>The ten true dragon bones were instantly reduced to ashes by the Dragon’s Roar and scattered on the ground.</p><p>The spiritual essence in the Dragon bones had been completely absorbed by Lu Ming. Naturally, the Dragon bones had turned into powder.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, the Dragon’s Roar in Lu Ming’s body grew stronger and stronger. In the end, a huge shadow of Nine Dragons appeared in the void above Lu Ming’s head. The nine Dragons stepped in the void and roamed in space.</p><p>Heaven and earth phenomenon!</p><p>The appearance of the heaven and earth phenomenon indicated that Lu Ming’s spirit body had officially entered the ranks of the heaven spirit body.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly opened his eyes. His body rose into the air and he threw a punch.</p><p>A terrifying fist force, with an ear-piercing whistling sound, was blasted toward a half-Saint demonic creature not far away.</p><p>The demonic creature was sent flying by the force of the punch, and it was sent flying hundreds of meters away.</p><p>“What a powerful force!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile on his face.</p><p>The demonic creature was at the first stage of the half-Saint realm. It was considered an ordinary half-Saint, but it was sent flying by Lu Ming’s punch.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation was still at the peak of the seventh level Martial Emperor realm. However, his combat strength had been greatly improved and he was much stronger than before.</p><p>A heaven spiritual body was not something an earth spiritual body could compare to.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and rushed toward the half-Saint while the prison-suppressing stele pressed down on the demonic creature. The demonic creature screamed and ran away.</p><p>well, forget it. Here, if I use the prison-guarding stele, these demonic creatures will not dare to fight me. But once I put the prison-guarding stele away, these demonic creatures will attack me together!</p><p>Lu Ming felt a little depressed.</p><p>He had wanted to see if he could get some half-Saint demonic evil crystals, but it seemed that he could forget about it.</p><p>it’s been half a month. It’s time to leave. I can’t just hide in one place and cultivate!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and then walked out of the valley.</p><p>He had enough demonic fiend crystals on him for a while.</p><p>Not long after, he left the valley, put away the prison-suppressing stele, spread his black wings, and flew toward the exit of this area.</p><p>On the way, he also found some other people who were still hunting for demonic fiend crystals.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop. He spread his black wings and flew at an astonishing speed. He whizzed past the ground below.</p><p>It did not take long for Lu Ming to see the exit. He flew straight out of the crack that he had entered through.</p><p>Just as Lu Ming flew out of the crack, his pupils suddenly narrowed. He felt a terrible crisis descending upon him.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>There was a slight fluctuation that was aimed at Lu Ming’s throat. The terrifying sharpness made Lu Ming’s muscles tense up.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Without the slightest hesitation, Lu Ming threw an uppercut upward.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>This punch seemed to have landed on a long sword. With a clang, the long sword was deflected by Lu Ming’s punch. However, the terrifying sharpness still left a bloody mark on Lu Ming’s neck.</p><p>Moreover, there were also wisps of terrifying sword Qi that flowed along Lu Ming’s fist and into his arm.</p><p>Lu Ming’s arm muscles trembled and he destroyed the sword Qi.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The sound of the air being torn rang out again. The terrifying sharpness was aimed at the vital points all over Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure retreated rapidly. He retreated from the crack and returned to the world under the crack, standing in the void.</p><p>“They’re from the thousand-kill mansion!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a sharp glint.</p><p>The assassins of the thousand-kill mansion had finally arrived.</p><p>“You’ll die for killing the people of my thousand kills mansion!”</p><p>A cold voice was heard. Two figures appeared in front of Lu Ming. They were dressed in black and exuded a cold killing intent and a faint holy aura.</p><p>Half-Saint! The two men in Black were actually half-Saints.</p><p>the thousand-kill mansion really thinks highly of me. They’ve sent two half-Saints!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>that’s why no one can escape from the people killed by my thousand kills mansion!</p><p>One of the black-robed men said coldly.</p><p>It was true that they had only killed two assassins at the eighth level of the Martial Emperor realm. However, two half-step Saint assassins had been dispatched to kill Lu Ming. It was a foolproof plan.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
