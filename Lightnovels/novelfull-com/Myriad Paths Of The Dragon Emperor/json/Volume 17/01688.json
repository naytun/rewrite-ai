Zi Feng obtained one point and returned to the stands.</p><p>Next, po yuangui continued to draw lots, and the competition continued.</p><p>...</p><p>In the third round, the cultivation of the two geniuses was not much different.</p><p>The second stage of the one-man half-Saint realm and the first stage of the one-man half-Saint realm.</p><p>In fact, those who could enter the second round had the lowest cultivation, and almost all of them were at the first stage of the half-Saint realm. Moreover, many of them had superior earth spiritual bodies, and a few of them had Medium Earth spiritual bodies.</p><p>These were the top heaven’s favorites of the Azure continent’s ten great sects, and every single one of them was very strong.</p><p>In this battle, the first stage half-Saint tried his best to rush out of the battle platform. The two were one level apart in cultivation, so they couldn’t completely crush each other. The last person in the first stage of the half-Saint realm rushed out of the battle platform after paying a small price.</p><p>This way, he could at least continue to compete in the future.</p><p>The matches went on one by one, and soon, there were more than 30 matches.</p><p>Some people admitted defeat, and some were killed.</p><p>All those who met one of the top ten geniuses admitted defeat. The gap was too big, and they could only admit that they were unlucky.</p><p>In Dragon God Valley, there were also a few people who admitted defeat. However, Tian Chui and Xue ningxin’s luck wasn’t too bad. The opponents they met were of the same level as them. They were all in the first stage of half-Saint.</p><p>Among those of the same rank, Tian Chui and Xue ningxin were undoubtedly the strongest. Thus, the two of them had each defeated their opponent, obtaining one point.</p><p>What caught Lu Ming’s attention the most was Luo Xiang from the life-and-death Sword sect. This opponent, who had once competed with him in the Emperor Cang secret realm, was now extremely terrifying.</p><p>The second stage of half-Saint!</p><p>Moreover, his spiritual body had actually become a superior-grade earth spiritual body.</p><p>after 15 years of nurturing the sword soul, the sword soul is now nourishing the spirit body, causing it to evolve. What a terrifying cultivation method!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation could be described as advancing by leaps and bounds in the hundred clan battlefield, but Luo Xiang’s cultivation speed was not any slower than his. It was truly shocking.</p><p>Furthermore, Luo Xiang’s combat strength was also unfathomable.</p><p>A first stage half-Saint from the Yu Du sect wanted to rush down the fighting ring, but he was killed in a flash of sword light.</p><p>“This person is very strong!”</p><p>Even Zi Feng furrowed his brows, revealing a grave expression.</p><p>“Lu Ming, fight the tiger’s roar!”</p><p>At this moment, po yuangui’s voice was heard. It was Lu Ming’s turn.</p><p>Lu Ming stood up and took a step forward, appearing on the fighting ring.</p><p>Lu Ming’s opponent was a young heaven’s favorite from the demon Fort. He was at the first stage of half-Saint.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Tiger roared and transformed into his true form. It was a huge demonic Tiger. His eyes were filled with ferocity as he said,”Lu Ming, although you’re quite powerful, I’m not afraid of you. Let’s fight!”</p><p>Back then, Lu Ming had gone on a killing spree outside the Supreme treasure Pavilion and had easily killed the experts at the second stage of the half-Saint realm. However, those people’s spiritual bodies were not of high levels. Hu Xiao, on the other hand, was a superior-grade earth spiritual body.</p><p>After the judge announced the start of the match, the Tiger roared and pounced on Lu Ming.</p><p>His claws were like blades as he grabbed at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was even faster. In a flash, he appeared in front of Hu Xiao and threw a punch. The punch landed on Hu Xiao’s lower jaw. Hu Xiao’s huge body was sent flying. He rolled a few times on the fighting ring before he could get up.</p><p>After getting up, Hu Xiao didn’t dare to continue fighting. He broke into a run and rushed down the fighting ring.</p><p>Lu Ming stood there and did not stop him. He watched as Hu Xiao rushed down the fighting ring.</p><p>The demon Castle and Dragon God Valley had a good relationship. There was no need for Lu Ming to kill the other party. Moreover, Lu Ming could not reveal too much of his combat strength at the moment. Otherwise, how could he lure the people of the tianshen sect later on?</p><p>Hmph, it seems like Lu Ming’s combat strength is only average. He’s just a little faster, but his attack power isn’t that strong. One punch only injured Hu Xiao, not killed him!</p><p>“That’s normal. Demonic beasts have strong defenses to begin with. Lu Ming’s cultivation level isn’t that high either!”</p><p>As expected, there were people in the surroundings discussing.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and returned to the stands. He had obtained one point.</p><p>The competition continued.</p><p>Very quickly, the forty matches of the eighty people were all over.</p><p>After this round of competition ended, of the 80 people, only 60 people were left to continue participating in the following competitions.</p><p>The other twenty people were either killed or directly admitted defeat.</p><p>In fact, nine of the top ten geniuses of Cangzhou had participated in this time’s treasure fixing assembly, because the other one was from one of the three sects that had been eliminated long ago.</p><p>Nine monsters had made nine people admit defeat.</p><p>There were also others who admitted defeat or were killed. After one round, there were only sixty people left.</p><p>In the end, the number of people would become even fewer.</p><p>In this round, one person from Dragon God Valley was killed and three had admitted defeat. There were eleven people left.</p><p>Of these eleven people, eight had won and obtained eight points.</p><p>With this score, they were temporarily ranked first among the ten great sects.</p><p>The second place was the heaven deity sect with only six points.</p><p>Hmph, it’s just a temporary lead. We’ll kill all those with points later and see what their ranking is.</p><p>In the area of the heavenly God sect, Luo shuihan said in a cold voice.</p><p>Next, po yuangui put the remaining 60 names into a box and started to draw lots again for the second round of competition.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Shi Yu!”</p><p>Po yuangui reported his name.</p><p>I didn’t expect that I would be the first person to fight in the second round!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and stepped onto the fighting ring. At the same time, a young man from the tianshen sect’s area jumped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>it’s actually a disciple of the heaven God sect. I’ve been waiting for this day!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a cold glint.</p><p>“You’re not admitting defeat?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Hmph, why do I need to admit defeat to you? Do you really think you can kill me?”</p><p>Shi Yu, the heaven’s chosen from the heavenly God sect, sneered.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and did not say much.</p><p>“Begin!”</p><p>Po yuangui announced.</p><p>As soon as po yuangui finished his words, Shi Yu moved and rushed to the edge of the fighting ring.</p><p>He believed that he was not Lu Ming’s match, but it was not a problem for him to rush down the fighting ring.</p><p>He had already gotten one point, and he didn’t want to waste it.</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s mouth curled up into a smile. He moved and approached Shi Yu in an instant. The Black Dragon Spear appeared in his hand and enlarged rapidly as he swept it at Shi Yu.</p><p>Shi Yu was shocked. He did not expect Lu Ming to be so fast. A milky-white sword appeared in his hand. It was undoubtedly a holy weapon. He slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The combat sword and the Black Dragon Spear collided. Shi Yu’s body trembled and he slid back a dozen meters. Lu Ming’s body also swayed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, your combat strength is only so-so, fight!”</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming had only pushed him back a dozen meters and that Lu Ming himself had wobbled, Shi Yu’s confidence was boosted.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. He held the Black Dragon Spear and ‘fought’ with Shi Yu.</p><p>Of course, this was just a big battle that Lu Ming had deliberately created. He still had to fish for more fish later on. If he revealed his powerful combat strength all of a sudden and killed the other party, the other people from the heavenly God sect would not dare to fight Lu Ming and would admit defeat immediately.</p><p>Therefore, of course, Lu Ming had to ‘perform’ well.</p><p>After exchanging more than a dozen moves with Shi Yu, he then pierced Shi Yu’s dantian with his spear and killed him.</p><p>“The heaven’s pride experts of the tianshen sect are nothing more than this!”</p><p>Lu Ming held the long spear and looked at Luo shuihan provocatively.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
