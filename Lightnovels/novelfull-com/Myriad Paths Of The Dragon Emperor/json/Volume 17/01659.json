Later on, for some unknown reason, the four great families split up. The few families that split up changed their surnames one after another, forming the four great families today.</p><p>The four families shared the same ancestral land. Every once in a while, the four families would send their young experts to compete with each other. Whoever won would be able to send someone into the ancestral land to obtain the opportunities.</p><p>Moreover, they could still ask for outside help.</p><p>No matter which family it was, as long as they invited the younger generation, they could represent the family and participate in the competition.</p><p>After all, relationships and connections sometimes represented strength.</p><p>Now, it was time for the competition between the four races to fight for a spot to enter the ancestral land.</p><p>This time, the SU family had invited a few heaven’s pride experts from the deity sect to help the SU family participate in the competition. With the participation of the heaven’s pride experts from the deity sect, the SU family could be said to have won for sure.</p><p>However, the heaven’s God sect’s Paragon had a request.</p><p>This was because one of the heaven’s pride experts of the heavenly God sect had been poisoned by the fiery Lotus poison. Su Lei had the mysterious Yin dragon body. The heaven’s pride expert of the heavenly God sect had requested su Lei to have sex with the person who had been poisoned by the fiery Lotus poison. In this way, the mysterious Yin dragon body would be able to neutralize the fiery Lotus poison.</p><p>After su Lei found out, she ran out, which led to the SU family’s pursuit.</p><p>However, they didn’t expect the other party to be so despicable as to use su Lei’s mother to threaten them.</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were even colder.</p><p>Where there were people, there would be Jianghu.</p><p>For the sake of benefits, cultivators would fight for their own benefits. Such things happened every day in the vast Yuan continent.</p><p>Without strength, one could not even decide their own fate.</p><p>Lu Ming could not and would not care about other people and other matters.</p><p>However, since he had encountered this matter, and it was su Lei who had helped him before, he had to get involved.</p><p>“Junior Sister su Lei, let’s go. I’ll accompany you back to the SU family!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Su Lei shook her head repeatedly. senior brother Lu Ming, this is my business. I can’t implicate you. I’ll go back and save my mother!</p><p>“You’ll go back by yourself. Will you agree to their conditions?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Su Lei fell silent. Tears welled up in her eyes again, making her look lonely and helpless.</p><p>With her cultivation level, what could she do if she returned? she could only save her mother if she agreed to the other party’s conditions.</p><p>let’s go. I’ll go back to the SU family with you. Su Cha, you lead the way!</p><p>Lu Ming was very direct. He pulled su Lei’s small hand and stepped on the air.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Su Cha nodded and took the lead to fly forward.</p><p>Now, she could only give it her all.</p><p>Since Lu Ming called su Lei his Junior Sister, he should be a disciple of Dragon God Valley, right? Perhaps, Lu Ming was very powerful!</p><p>“Senior brother Lu Ming, su … There’s a Saint in the SU family!”</p><p>Su Lei’s face was flushed as Lu Ming held her hand. However, she was still worried.</p><p>Although he knew that Lu Ming was very powerful and had been very powerful since a few years ago, he was definitely no match for those half-Saints or even Saints.</p><p>“Haha, so what if you’re a Saint? I’ll still slap you to death. Junior Sister su Lei, you’ve helped me before, and I haven’t returned the favor. If I miss this opportunity, how am I going to return the favor in the future? do you want me to repay you with my body? Hahaha!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed out loud, but su Lei’s face was red.</p><p>However, after Lu Ming’s joke, su Lei’s mood was much better. She allowed Lu Ming to pull her along as they flew towards Gusu city.</p><p>Gusu city was very big. In the Azure region, it was also a big city with a rather famous reputation.</p><p>Each of the four families in the city had a Saint. They were very powerful in the nearby area.</p><p>Furthermore, the four major families were closely connected to the top forces in Cang Prefecture. Every time a genius was born, they would be sent to the 13 top forces to cultivate.</p><p>For example, su Lei was sent to the Dragon God Valley to cultivate. She only returned to the SU family when it was almost time for the four-clan competition. She did not expect this to happen.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at Gusu city. The three of them arrived before a huge Palace.</p><p>This was the SU family.</p><p>“Su Lei is back!”</p><p>The eyes of the few big men guarding the door lit up when they saw su Lei. A few of them flashed and blocked the escape route of the three people, as if they were afraid that they would escape.</p><p>One of them rushed into the palace to report.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming let go of su Lei’s small hand and took the lead to walk into the SU family’s residence. Su Lei and su Cha followed behind.</p><p>After entering the gate and walking through a long corridor, they arrived at a large courtyard.</p><p>The moment they stepped into the courtyard, the sound of air being torn could be heard continuously. In the SU family’s Palace, there were constantly figures flashing over and flying into the courtyard, surrounding them.</p><p>Su Lei and su Cha’s faces turned pale.</p><p>Lu Ming had his hands behind his back. His expression was calm and he was calm.</p><p>Su Lei, I knew you would come back!</p><p>A sharp voice rang out.</p><p>Then, a few figures came to the courtyard.</p><p>At the very front was a middle-aged man in a green robe. He stood with his hands behind his back and exuded a dignified aura.</p><p>Beside the green-robed middle-aged man stood a young woman. She was quite pretty. At this moment, she was sneering and looking at su Lei triumphantly. She was the one who had made the sound just now.</p><p>that’s the head of the SU family. That woman is the daughter of the head of the SU family, Su Qin. She’s the one who brought the genius of the deity sect here!</p><p>Su Cha sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded, his eyes glistening as he sized up the master of the SU family.</p><p>the third stage of the half-Saint realm. The rules of the world? ”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>He could tell at a glance that the cultivation of the sus ‘master was at the third stage of half-Saint.</p><p>However, the master of the SU family was at most a low-grade earth spiritual body. Even if he was at the third stage of the law, he was not worth mentioning in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>As for Su Qin, her cultivation was even worse. She was only at the sixth level of the martial Royal realm.</p><p>The master of the SU family’s gaze fell on Lu Ming as well, and he frowned slightly.</p><p>That was because he could not tell Lu Ming’s cultivation realm.</p><p>However, his brows soon relaxed.</p><p>Lu Ming should have cultivated some concealment technique. Since he was with su Lei, his cultivation level was probably not high. There was no need to worry.</p><p>“Master, I … Where’s my mother? Quickly release my mother, this matter has nothing to do with her!”</p><p>Since she was already here, su Lei decided to go all out. She stepped forward and faced the SU family’s master.</p><p>su Lei, what’s the hurry? after you help Zheng Fei get rid of the fire Lotus poison, you’ll naturally let your mother go!</p><p>Su Qin, the daughter of the SU family’s head, sneered.</p><p>“No, I want to see my mother first!”</p><p>Su Lei gritted her teeth.</p><p>“Su Lei, you are not qualified to talk about conditions now. Moreover, it is your honor to be able to have sex with the heaven’s pride of the heavenly God sect. Maybe the other party will take a fancy to you in the future and give you a status. At that time, you will have a meteoric rise!”</p><p>Su Qin said.</p><p>“I don’t want to! I want to see my mother!”</p><p>Then, a dagger appeared in su Lei’s hand and she pointed it at her heart. “If I don’t see my mother today, I’ll just die and you can forget about it!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
