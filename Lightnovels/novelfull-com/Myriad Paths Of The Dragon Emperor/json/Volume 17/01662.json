Is this condition very difficult to agree to?”</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, can you change your condition?”</p><p>The head of the SU family said.</p><p>“No need to exchange, this old master agrees!”</p><p>At this moment, an old voice was heard. From the depths of the SU family’s Hall, an elder with white hair stepped out.</p><p>“Saint!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>This elder was a Saint, but he was only a lower tier bright Saint.</p><p>“Forefather!”</p><p>&Nbsp; seeing this old man, the SU family head immediately bowed.</p><p>“We pay our respects to the ancestor!”</p><p>Su Qin and the rest of the SU family, including su Lei, su Cha, and su Lei’s mother, all bowed respectfully.</p><p>This elder was the pillar of the SU family, the only Saint.</p><p>I agree to Lu Ming’s conditions. After the SU family wins, su Lei will be allowed to enter the ancestral land. She is also a direct descendant of the SU family. If she can obtain the opportunity of the ancestral land, it will be the SU family’s fortune!</p><p>The SU family’s Saint realm ancestor said.</p><p>“Yes, ancestor!”</p><p>&Nbsp; the SU family head nodded and didn’t dare to disobey.</p><p>Su Qin was extremely unwilling, but since old ancestor su had spoken, she didn’t dare to say anything and could only grit her teeth.</p><p>also, don’t think that you can do whatever you want just because I’m in seclusion. You’re the head of the SU family, so you should think about the entire su family, not your children. If that’s the case, you don’t need to be the head of the family anymore!</p><p>Old ancestor su continued.</p><p>The head of the SU family broke out in cold sweat and knelt down in fear and trepidation, ” “Please forgive me, ancestor. I won’t dare to do it again in the future!”</p><p>In the world of martial Dao, strength spoke for itself.</p><p>In the SU family, a Saint was the king, and he could decide the family head with a word.</p><p>In front of old ancestor su, the SU family head didn’t even dare to let out a fart.</p><p>this girl is very talented. In the future, we will focus on nurturing her. The sage realm is in sight. Do you understand? ”</p><p>&Nbsp; old ancestor su looked at su Lei and smiled. Then, he looked at the head of the SU family and his eyes flashed.</p><p>He was in closed-door cultivation all year round. Sometimes, he would be in closed-door cultivation for decades. Therefore, he rarely asked about the SU family’s Affairs. If he had not been alarmed by Lu Ming’s aura and ended his closed-door cultivation, he would have lost a prodigy like su Lei.</p><p>With su Lei’s talent, she had the potential to become a saint. It was extremely difficult for a family to produce such a genius. However, the head of the SU family wanted to sacrifice su Lei in exchange for his daughter’s opportunity.</p><p>&Nbsp; old ancestor SU’s heart was filled with rage. He planned and it seemed like he had to clean up the SU family.</p><p>brother Lu Ming, please. I’ll order a banquet to thank you for protecting a genius of the SU family! su mo said.</p><p>The old ancestor of the SU family looked at Lu Ming and said politely.</p><p>“You’re welcome, please!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. Then, he entered the depths of the SU family’s residence with su Lei and the rest.</p><p>As for the few heaven’s pride experts of the tianshen sect, there would naturally be someone to deal with them. Moreover, an order had been issued that if anyone were to leak this information, they would be killed without mercy.</p><p>After the banquet, Lu Ming stayed at the SU family’s residence temporarily.</p><p>The competition between the four families would begin seven days later. Anyway, there was still some time before the treasure auction. Lu Ming was not in a hurry. He could help the kind-hearted su Lei.</p><p>Seven days passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The competition between the four great clans of Gusu city had begun. The venue was a huge square in the center of Gusu city.</p><p>In the middle of the square, a huge fighting ring had been built.</p><p>On this day, the square was surrounded by a sea of people.</p><p>The competition between the four great clans of Gusu city was a rare grand event in Gusu city, so it was only natural that the martial artists of Gusu city would flock to it.</p><p>There were stands built in all four directions of the square. Lu Ming and the SU family members landed on the stands on the East.</p><p>After that, the people from the other three families landed on the other three stands.</p><p>Not long after, the competition officially began.</p><p>The rules of the competition were very simple. Each family would send six young experts to enter the fighting ring together for a team battle. The family that still had people left on the fighting ring would win.</p><p>The SU family, including Lu Ming, had chosen six young men. Su Lei was one of them.</p><p>Apart from Lu Ming, the strongest among them was only at the seventh level martial Royal realm.</p><p>In the past, the SU family would always invite some external help. However, this time, with Lu Ming, the SU family naturally did not need to invite external help.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>From all directions, figures rushed up the fighting ring.</p><p>There were exactly six people in each direction.</p><p>As soon as the others jumped onto the fighting ring, they started sizing each other up.</p><p>After that, there would be a chaotic battle. Naturally, he had to observe the enemy well before he knew how to fight.</p><p>“Haha, Su Qi, your su family actually doesn’t have any external help this time? No, only one external helper? Have you already given up on the competition?”</p><p>hahahaha! a loud laugh rang out. From the South, a middle-aged man sneered at the SU family head.</p><p>apart from that person, the highest cultivation among the others is only at Lv 7 martial Royal realm. It seems that the SU family has really given up. Let’s eliminate the SU family first and have a battle between the three families!</p><p>A voice came from the West.</p><p>The people who spoke were the family heads of the other three families.</p><p>Just like the SU family’s master, they were all at the third stage of the half-Saint realm and had the cultivation base of the law tank. They could clearly see the cultivation of su Lei and the others with a sweep of their spiritual senses.</p><p>There was only one exception, and that was Lu Ming. He had cast the illusionary breath technique, so they could not see his cultivation level clearly. However, they did not care too much about it. They did not believe that Lu Ming’s cultivation level was very strong.</p><p>“Wait a minute, you’ll be the ones crying!”</p><p>A cold smile appeared on the SU family member’s face, but he didn’t say anything.</p><p>There was no point in saying anything now. In a moment, he would let them know the power of the SU family.</p><p>the family head has spoken. We’ll deal with the SU family first!</p><p>On the fighting ring, one of the six people from the South sneered and looked at Lu Ming’s group.</p><p>I also think that the four sides are too complicated. Let’s deal with the weakest one first!</p><p>One of the six people on the west side sneered.</p><p>Then, the three groups of people stepped forward and pressed toward Lu Ming and the others. Powerful auras bloomed one by one.</p><p>They were all high-level martial Royal realm experts, and each side had several Lv 9 martial Royal realm experts.</p><p>Among the six people of the SU family, except for su Lei, the rest of them turned pale.</p><p>Seven days ago, Lu Ming had shown his prowess at the SU family. Only some of the higher-ups and stronger people had participated. These young people had not participated and naturally did not know how powerful Lu Ming was.</p><p>“What do we do?”</p><p>A young man’s face was covered in cold sweat. The other three families all had external help, and each of them was much stronger than them. Not to mention the three families had joined forces. The result was obvious without a fight.</p><p>“Can’t you just solve it?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and walked to the center of the fighting ring.</p><p>“You … You don’t want to live anymore, what do you want to do? What should we do?”</p><p>A young man from the SU family was at a loss.</p><p>“I want to … We’ll just watch!”</p><p>Su Lei said timidly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
