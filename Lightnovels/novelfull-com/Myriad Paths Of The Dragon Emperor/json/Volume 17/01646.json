Even though the opponent was a Saint, he was still forced to retreat.</p><p>...</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he held the chaos sky-turning seal in his hand and threw it at the huge lizard-like beast.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The lizard-like ferocious beast was hit by the chaos sky-turning stamp and was forced to retreat. Its skin and flesh were torn open and blood was flowing out.</p><p>They took the opportunity to charge forward.</p><p>“Stay here!”</p><p>A cold voice suddenly came from the front. A huge demonic palm grabbed at them. The vast aura made Lu Ming’s expression change.</p><p>“Great mastery of bright Saint!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared angrily.</p><p>The other party had even sent out a great mastery bright Saint. They were going to kill them.</p><p>Each level of the Saint realm was divided into four levels: initial, upper, peak, and perfection.</p><p>The gap between each level was huge, even bigger than the gap between each level of the martial Royal realm.</p><p>Why did the Saints of the various races in the hundred clan battlefield join forces to kill them?</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming and the other young men were filled with questions.</p><p>However, now was not the time to be confused. The most important thing was to rush out first.</p><p>“Join hands with me!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. His hands were like phantoms as the chaos Domain boiled. A huge chaos sky-turning seal was formed and blasted toward the huge demonic palm.</p><p>On the side, Huang Ling, ye Dongfang, the yellow-robed young man, and the other powerful cultivators all joined forces. Their terrifying attacks merged into a colorful light pillar and rushed toward the demonic palm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The demonic palm was crushed immediately. Lu Ming was at the forefront. He immediately changed direction and flew at top speed. The rest of the people followed behind him.</p><p>The Saint realm experts were in hot pursuit.</p><p>On the other side, the tenth golden Crow Prince and Taotie had also broken through the other party’s blockade and fled into the distance.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>On the other side, another demonic palm formed and grabbed towards them. They continued to work together and destroyed the demonic palm.</p><p>They were flying forward rapidly, but the Saints behind them were hot on their heels. There was also a terrifying demonic light flying toward them.</p><p>The existence in the demonic light was a powerhouse at the great mastery of the bright Saint realm.</p><p>let’s split up. Otherwise, if we’re targeted like this, none of us will be able to escape!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The expressions of the others changed rapidly.</p><p>“We’ll split up. We’ll only have a chance if three to five people join forces!”</p><p>Ye Dongfang shouted and turned into a bolt of lightning, rushing in another direction.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Then, the yellow-robed young man was also sent flying.</p><p>The other two heaven’s favorites who had reached the womb Realm also flew out.</p><p>Following that, the weaker ones split up into groups of three to five and fled into the distance.</p><p>As for Lu Ming and Huang Ling, they flew straight ahead at top speed, raising their speed to the maximum.</p><p>“You guys go after those people. Leave those two to me!”</p><p>The being in the demonic light had its eyes on Lu Ming and was chasing after him. The other Saints scattered and chased after the others.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>With one chasing and one escaping, Lu Ming, Huang Ling, and the existence in the ball of demonic light flew tens of thousands of miles in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The ball of demonic light was approaching Lu Ming and Lin Feng at an alarming speed.</p><p>“Bubble!”</p><p>With a thought from Lu Ming, bubbles, who was hiding in the pagoda, appeared and opened a space-time Tunnel. Lu Ming and Feng Ling rushed in and appeared ten thousand miles away. Then, bubbles continued to open the tunnel. After a few times, they completely shook off the ball of demonic light.</p><p>it seems like bubbles has also advanced!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>In the yuan continent, when bubbles opened the spacetime tunnel in the past, he could only travel a few thousand miles. Now, he could travel ten thousand miles.</p><p>It seemed like bubbles had also improved during the three months that he had experienced nine reincarnations. She should have reached the first stage of the half-Saint realm, and her strength had increased greatly.</p><p>They flew for another hundred thousand miles before stopping.</p><p>“Why do these Saints want to kill us? Is it because we entered the tomb of the reincarnation King?”</p><p>Huang Ling frowned and couldn’t figure it out.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head. He could not figure it out either.</p><p>If it was because of the tomb of the reincarnation Emperor, it should be the undead race that attacked them because it was the territory of the undead race. Why were there so many races?</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming felt that the being in the last ball of magic light should be a human.</p><p>In the hundred clan battlefield, the only humans who had reached the Saint realm were the natives.</p><p>“Let’s go back to Darkwater city first!” He said.</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The Phoenix Spirit nodded and the two of them flew towards dark water city.</p><p>After a while, many figures gathered in front of the mountain where the tomb of the reincarnation King was.</p><p>There were two saints from the undead race, a few powerful beasts, and other races. All 12 Saints had gathered here.</p><p>damn it, those people escaped. I only killed a dozen or so!</p><p>The giant lizard that was badly beaten by Lu Ming let out an angry roar.</p><p>At this moment, a ball of demonic light flew over. The other Saints all looked at the demonic light.</p><p>The demonic light was retracted, revealing a figure.</p><p>It was a human, a black-robed old man with a gloomy face.</p><p>I deliberately disclosed the information of the tomb of the reincarnation Emperor to these foreign talents so that they would fight each other for the tomb. I didn’t expect that these people didn’t lose much after entering the tomb. What a mistake!</p><p>The black-robed old man said in a low voice.</p><p>“What do we do now?”</p><p>A Saint asked.</p><p>“Kill! We must kill him!”</p><p>the hundred clan battlefield belongs to us, ” the black-robed elder said in a cold voice. the wealth and treasures here belong to us. However, the large sects and factions outside have been sending young geniuses here for many years to plunder the wealth and kill the creatures of our various races. Even the humans who have been training outside have been killed by them!</p><p>“That’s why we have to kill them this time. We have to kill them until the large sects in the outside world are afraid. After we kill them, they won’t dare to send anyone in again. This way, the hundred clan battlefield will truly belong to us in the future!”</p><p>The black-robed elder’s words made the other sages present angry and filled with killing intent.</p><p>we’ll inform all the races to hunt for foreign talents. Also, many of them will probably go to the Alliance mountain. When the time comes, we’ll ambush them there. Remember, pick the most talented ones to kill. The more talented they are, the more heartache and fear they’ll feel. They won’t dare to send anyone here in the future!</p><p>The black-robed elder said.</p><p>“Alright, let’s do that!”</p><p>“I’ll immediately inform the other races! Ambush and kill foreign heaven’s favorites!”</p><p>The other sages nodded and turned into streaks of light, leaving the place.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
