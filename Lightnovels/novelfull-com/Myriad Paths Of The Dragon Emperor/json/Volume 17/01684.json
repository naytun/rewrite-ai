He sneered, ” “Don’t worry, after the treasure sealing assembly ends, I will kill you!”</p><p>haha, how arrogant! Lu Ming, you won’t have the chance to fight with senior brother Divine Son. The fixed treasure meet will be the day of your death!</p><p>...</p><p>Luo shuihan laughed out loud, her face full of contempt.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and did not continue speaking.</p><p>There was no point in saying more!</p><p>The remnant didn’t say anything else. He took a step forward and appeared on the grandstand of the Tian Shen sect.</p><p>After that, another old man rose into the air and stood in the sky above the fighting ring, overlooking the entire scene.</p><p>This old man was the judge of this assembly. He was from the poyuan family.</p><p>The poyuan family had been eliminated during the small treasure determination meeting. The judgment of each treasure determination meeting was made by the eliminated sect’s people. This was more fair and would not favor any side.</p><p>“This old man’s name is po yuangui, and I am the judge of this time’s event. Now, I will first announce the rules of the treasure fixing assembly. This time’s treasure fixing assembly is different from the past because the rules have been changed!”</p><p>Po yuangui’s voice resounded throughout the area, ” the meeting will be divided into two rounds. A total of ten sects will participate, and each sect will send twenty people.</p><p>the first round will be the selection. The ten great sects will enter ten different array worlds and hunt demonic beasts. Some of these demonic beasts have a wind core in their bodies, while some don’t. Your goal is to hunt for a wind core and rank them according to the number of wind cores. Only the top 80 will enter the second round!</p><p>Po yuangui explained.</p><p>The crowd understood the moment they heard it. In the first round, only 80 people would advance, and the rest would be eliminated.</p><p>the second round will be the points competition. Eighty people will take turns to fight. Everyone will have to fight with others, regardless of whether they are from the same sect or not. The winner will get one point. In the end, the sect with the most points will be the champion of this time’s treasure fixing assembly. That sect will have the right to control two ancient treasures until the next time!</p><p>I will announce the specific rules of the second round when the second round begins!</p><p>Po yuangui continued to speak and roughly explained what happened in the second round.</p><p>“It’s actually a points match!”</p><p>Zi Feng’s eyes moved.</p><p>this way, the sect that has more people in the first round will have an advantage in the second round!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The more people who entered the second round, the higher the probability of obtaining points, and the total points of that sect would naturally be higher.</p><p>“Now, I’ll open the formation!”</p><p>open! po yuangui said. Then, a powerful aura emanated from his body. With a wave of his hand, Saint power surged, and ten light doors suddenly appeared in the sky.</p><p>there are ten formation worlds inside. These ten formation worlds are almost exactly the same and the difficulty is the same. Now, every sect will enter a formation world and hunt for the wind core. From now on, you only have half an hour!</p><p>Po yuangui announced.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As soon as po yuangui finished speaking, the participants from the ten sects rose into the air one after another. Each sect had twenty people.</p><p>The group randomly chose a door and rushed in.</p><p>Dragon God Valley chose the nearest door and the twenty people rushed in. The next moment, they found themselves in a grassland.</p><p>At a glance, the grassland was boundless.</p><p>The world here was a world of arrays and not real. Everything here was fake. Only the core of wind was real. Their target was the core of wind.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Not far away, a wind Wolf was staring at them and howling.</p><p>“Demonic beast, see if there’s a wind core!”</p><p>A Lv 9 martial Royal realm expert rushed out and pounced on the wind Wolf.</p><p>The wind Wolf howled and stomped its feet. Its body was like a gust of wind as it rushed out. The disciple of Dragon God Valley missed.</p><p>“Where are you going?”</p><p>The man felt embarrassed after missing and continued to pounce on the wind Wolf.</p><p>However, the wind Wolf’s body was like the wind, and its speed was astonishing. For a moment, the disciple could not take it down.</p><p>“What a fast speed. Are all the demonic beasts here this fast?”</p><p>Some people’s faces turned ugly.</p><p>If the demonic beasts here were all so fast, then it would not be so easy to hunt for the wind core.</p><p>we only have half an hour. Let’s move quickly!</p><p>Zi Feng opened his mouth.</p><p>we’ll at most form groups of several people. This way, the hunting speed will be faster!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>If the speed of the demonic beasts here was so amazing, then the speed of one person hunting for the wind core would definitely not be as fast as the speed of several people working together.</p><p>alright, let’s find someone to join forces and set off quickly!</p><p>Zi Feng instructed.</p><p>Lu Ming was naturally with Tian Chui and Xue ningxin.</p><p>Zi Feng and the two purple dragon Valley’s disciples were together. The others also found people to join hands and flew into the distance in groups of three to five.</p><p>This array world was extremely vast, as if it had no end. Everyone scattered in the array world and disappeared in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Lu Ming, Tian Chui, and Xue ningxin flew forward at an extremely fast speed. In no time, they had already covered a distance of several thousand miles.</p><p>“There are a few demonic beasts down there!”</p><p>Xue ningxin looked down.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Tian Chui raised his giant hammer and swung it towards the demonic beasts.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The giant hammer struck the ground, causing the earth to shake and dust to fill the air.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A few figures rushed out from the smoke and dust. It was the demonic beasts. Their bodies were like the wind, and their speed was astonishing. They actually all dodged Tian Chui’s attack.</p><p>“You’re running really fast, watch me!”</p><p>Tian Chui waved his hand and the giant hammer in his hand flew out like a lightning bolt. Like a meteorite, it smashed onto a demonic beast. The demonic beast was crushed by the huge force and exploded.</p><p>However, the other demonic beasts had already fled far away.</p><p>Lu Ming used the thundering wind steps and chased after a demonic beast in a flash. In a few breaths, he caught up to the demonic beast and threw a punch. The demonic beast was torn into pieces, turning into energy and dissipating.</p><p>“There’s no wind core!”</p><p>Lu Ming raised his eyebrows.</p><p>There was no core of wind among the demonic beasts.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming walked over to Tian Chui and saw him saying with a bitter face, ninth Junior Brother, there’s no wind core. Have you found it? ”</p><p>“No, I didn’t!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head.</p><p>po yuangui said that some demonic beasts don’t have a wind core, while some do. It seems that the probability of having one is not high!</p><p>Xue ningxin said.</p><p>the demonic beasts here are fast, and the chances of them having a wind core are not high. Moreover, we only have half an hour. If this continues, it will be very difficult to hunt enough wind cores!</p><p>Tian Chui said.</p><p>it’s fine. I have an idea. Let’s go find the demonic beasts first!</p><p>Lu Ming said. Then, the three of them continued flying in search of demonic beasts.</p><p>There was no lack of demonic beasts on the Prairie. In a short while, they saw a few demonic beasts.</p><p>“The nine seals of the gate of God!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast the nine seals of the gate of God and nine sealing gates appeared, freezing the demonic beasts in place.</p><p>Tian Chui and Xue ningxin rushed over and dealt with the demon beasts in a few moves.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
