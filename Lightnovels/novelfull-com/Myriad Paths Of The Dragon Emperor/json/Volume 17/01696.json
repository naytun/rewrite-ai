You forced me to use the Holy explosion technique!”</p><p>The Son of God roared.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At that moment, the Son of God’s body glowed with holy light. The Holy Light armor covering his body actually exploded, turning into holy light and entering the Son of God’s body.</p><p>At that moment, the deity’s aura skyrocketed and actually rushed towards the peak of a bright Saint.</p><p>“What? The Divine Child still has a secret technique!”</p><p>what a terrifying secret skill. His aura is starting to skyrocket. It’s so strong, and it’s still rising!</p><p>“His temperament has changed!”</p><p>Many people cried out in alarm.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, the Son of God let out a beast-like roar. His eyes were bloodshot and his face was filled with ferocity.</p><p>The pure white holy light on his body was no longer pure, but mixed with a trace of blood.</p><p>“Lu Ming, die!”</p><p>The Son of God roared as he slashed out with his sword. The Taiji diagram was instantly shattered and dissipated in the air.</p><p>At the same time, the sword light was different. It slashed at Lu Ming’s long spear. Lu Ming’s body trembled violently as he felt an irresistible force coming at him. His body was sent flying into the air.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The Son of God roared. He took a step forward and charged forward. His sword light shook the sky, as if it could destroy everything.</p><p>Countless runes appeared on the second body, which turned into all kinds of weapons and flew toward the divine Son. At the same time, the Tai Chi disk array lit up, and another Tai Chi formation diagram appeared. Then, the Tai Chi formation diagram split into two, turning into a pair of Yin Yang fish swords that slashed toward the divine Son.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The Son of God’s sword-light easily destroyed the various weapons condensed from the secondary body’s array Dao laws. The sword-light then struck the Yin Yang fish sword.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Sparks flew in all directions, and the sword Qi was unrestrained.</p><p>The Yin Yang fish sword was sent flying.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the sky, a huge chaos sky-turning seal pressed down on the Son of God. Behind the chaos sky-turning seal, Lu Ming swooped down with his 36 Saint weapons, aiming for the Son of God.</p><p>“Holy light slash, break!”</p><p>The Son of God roared and slashed out with his sword. A beam of holy light sword Qi shot up into the sky. It was as if it had split the world in two and slashed at the chaos sky-turning seal.</p><p>Zzzzzzz …</p><p>When the sword light struck the chaos sky-turning seal, an ear-piercing sound was heard. The sword light was actually breaking the chaos sky-turning seal at a rapid speed.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In the end, the primal Chaos sky-turning seal exploded. The sword radiance did not stop and collided with Lu Ming, who was behind the primal Chaos sky-turning seal.</p><p>The terrifying vibrations continued to ring out. The Saint weapons around Lu Ming were sent flying one by one. Lu Ming’s body was once again sent flying into the sky.</p><p>“What powerful strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming was also a little shocked.</p><p>After the Son of God used the secret skill, his strength increased by several times.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not afraid. Instead, his eyes were filled with a strong desire to fight.</p><p>Battle! Battle! Battle!</p><p>Lu Ming did not retreat. Instead, he closed in. His main body turned into his second body, and he charged at the divine Son at the same time. All kinds of attacks were launched at the divine Son continuously.</p><p>The Son of God wielded the great saint Sword and slashed out with a sword light, destroying Lu Ming’s various attacks.</p><p>Then, the combat sword slashed out continuously. Beams of dazzling sword gleams surged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The explosions continued. Lu Ming’s various attacks were destroyed and he was forced to retreat.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The Son of God transformed into a beam of sword light and shot into the sky, heading straight for Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>The sword radiance bloomed and the Holy weapons that surrounded Lu Ming were sent flying one by one.</p><p>One of the shields even had a crack after being cut by the sword.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re dead meat today!”</p><p>The divine Son said coldly as he continued to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A sword gleam almost split Lu Ming’s body in half.</p><p>Lu Ming did not call for bubbles to help.</p><p>Bubbles was a spiritual beast and was not within his combat power. If he were to call bubbles out, the Supreme Sage of the tianshen sect would probably interfere.</p><p>He could only rely on himself.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s main body retreated quickly while his second body stepped forward. He controlled the Tai Chi disk array and pressed it down on the divine Son.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The Son of God’s sword struck the Tai Chi formation disk. The formation disk trembled and was sent flying.</p><p>It wasn’t that the Tai Chi formation disk wasn’t strong, but that his second body’s cultivation was limited, and it couldn’t unleash much of its power.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The Divine Child charged at Lu Ming’s main body again, as if he had his eyes fixed on it.</p><p>Lu Ming tried his best to resist but he was no match for him. He was in danger and was almost cut in half at the waist again. He dodged the attack by a hair’s breadth.</p><p>Lu Ming is already at his wit’s end. He has used all his strength!</p><p>that’s right. He’s strong enough, but he’s no match for the Divine Child. He’s going to die Here!</p><p>“What a pity!”</p><p>It was obvious that Lu Ming had used all his strength since the beginning of the battle. Unfortunately, he was no match for the enemy.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was swept by the sword ray and a bloody gash appeared, blood flowing out.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you have no chance!”</p><p>The divine Son bellowed, his attacks like a storm. Lu Ming was in danger.</p><p>However, despite being in danger, Lu Ming’s expression remained calm. He exerted the law of chaos to the extreme and fought the divine Son. At the same time, he refined his secondary body and launched continuous attacks at the divine Son.</p><p>the law tank! Divine Child, I’ll use you to break through the law tank!</p><p>In the midst of danger, Lu Ming was exceptionally calm. He was highly concentrated and his essential core and the Laws of Chaos were circulated to the extreme.</p><p>The more dangerous it was, the more it could stimulate one’s potential.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>A ray of sword light pierced through Lu Ming’s shoulder. However, Lu Ming’s spiritual body was powerful. It contained a wisp of chaotic Qi, which was not weaker than a medium-grade celestial spiritual body. His spiritual body immediately squirmed and sealed the wound. The destructive power of the sword Qi was worn out, so it did not cause too much damage.</p><p>the body of law, the body of law …</p><p>This word kept appearing in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>His mind seemed to have entered a mysterious state.</p><p>The state of life and death!</p><p>Facing the fatal threat of the Divine Child, Lu Ming finally entered that state again.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, an invisible wave rushed into Lu Ming’s body from the sky.</p><p>“That is … The laws of nature are in the tank!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>he’s broken through! Lu Ming has broken through! He’s actually breaking through in the middle of a great battle with the divine Son!</p><p>unbelievable. He’s about to break through the nomological tank. Is the situation going to be reversed again? ”</p><p>Everyone was shocked. The experts of the heavenly God sect stood up. Their auras exploded and their hearts trembled.</p><p>the body will need some time to adapt to the laws. Son of God, kill him now!</p><p>The great sage of the heavenly God sect roared.</p><p>“Lu Ming, be careful!”</p><p>The purple dragon Valley master also shouted to warn Lu Ming.</p><p>Everyone knew that this battle had reached a critical moment.</p><p>If Lu Ming’s body had gotten used to it, he would have turned the tide and killed the divine Son.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was already terrifying enough. If he made another breakthrough, he might really be able to defeat the divine Son.</p><p>Furthermore, the Divine Child’s Secret technique could greatly increase his strength for a short period of time, but that was only for a short period of time. There was a time limit, and if one side lost while the other side gained, the Divine Child would definitely die.</p><p>That was why the opportunity to become the godchild was now.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
