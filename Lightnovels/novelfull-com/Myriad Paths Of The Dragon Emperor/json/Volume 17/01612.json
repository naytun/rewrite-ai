There were even a few Saint realm demonic creatures. Even a half-Saint would be killed, let alone an eighth or ninth level martial Royal realm demonic creature.</p><p>While many people were watching unwillingly, Lu Ming had already quietly rushed into the valley.</p><p>...</p><p>While no one was paying attention, Lu Ming quietly changed his body. His secondary body entered the mountain and river diagram while his main body stepped out of it.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A half-Saint demonic creature charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming had a thought. Behind him, the aura of the prison-suppressing stele was released. The demonic creature’s eyes showed a trace of fear. It roared and retreated.</p><p>Lu Ming was unimpeded and he rushed into the ground covered in bones.</p><p>The light of reincarnation was emitted from the depths.</p><p>“So this isn’t the end, there’s a deeper place!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. The last time, he stopped here and did not go any further. He did not expect that there was another universe in the depths.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>In the valley, the demonic creatures roared like thunder, and the Holy aura filled the air.</p><p>A huge demonic bear was chasing after a young man. That young man was Zhao Kuang.</p><p>Zhao Kuang didn’t dare to face the Saint realm demonic creature head-on. He dodged it with his movement technique and managed to charge into the depths of the valley after paying a price.</p><p>The demonic bear roared but did not continue to pursue.</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze around but did not see Wan Tiancheng, Huang Ling, and Sima Liang. He assumed that the three of them had also successfully rushed in.</p><p>With their combat strength, even if they couldn’t defeat the Saint demonic creature, they could still rush in.</p><p>There were still people who wanted to rush in. They were all people at the half-Saint level. Lu Ming saw Xu Ran.</p><p>However, these people’s combat strength was much weaker. Under the attack of the Saint demonic creature, they could only retreat with injuries and escape in a hurry.</p><p>Some of the first stage half-Saints were even killed by the Saint demonic creatures.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele emerged behind Lu Ming. The demonic creatures retreated when they saw him. Lu Ming passed through the obstacles easily and went inside.</p><p>In the depths of this land of bones, there was a Valley that led all the way in.</p><p>There were no demonic creatures in this Valley. Lu Ming rushed here and put away the prison-suppressing stele. Then, he concealed his aura and walked into the valley.</p><p>The valley was very long, but there was no danger. Lu Ming moved forward smoothly.</p><p>Not long after, they reached the end of the valley. In front of them, a huge mountain appeared, blocking their way.</p><p>There was a cave on the wall at the bottom of the mountain. The light of reincarnation was coming from this cave.</p><p>A figure was standing in front of the cave. It was Sima Liang.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>A deep rumble came from the cave. It seemed like an intense battle was going on inside.</p><p>Sima Liang looked at Lu Ming as if he had heard some movement. When he saw Lu Ming’s cultivation level, his eyes were filled with surprise. He had not expected that a person at the eighth level of the Martial Emperor realm would be able to come here.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The rumbling sounds in the cave became even more intense. Then, a burly figure rushed out of the cave. It was Zhao Kuang.</p><p>At this moment, Zhao Kuang was in a sorry state. There was blood at the corner of his mouth and his breathing was weak.</p><p>damn it! So many puppets! How troublesome!</p><p>damn it! Zhao Kuang cursed. Then, he looked around and exclaimed in surprise when he saw Lu Ming.</p><p>Inside the cave, the sound of explosions continued to ring out. Then, another figure rushed out of the cave. It was Wan Tiancheng.</p><p>Like Zhao Kuang, he was also injured and in a sorry state.</p><p>There was a cold glint in his eyes. He swept his gaze across the room and it landed on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kid, it’s you?”</p><p>Wan Tiancheng’s eyes burst out with a shocking killing intent.</p><p>“Of course it’s me. Why? Is it because the gift I gave you was too valuable that you’re especially ‘grateful’? ”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Especially the word ‘present’, he emphasized it.</p><p>“You’re looking for death, kill!”</p><p>Wan Tiancheng’s murderous intent was as cold as a knife. He took a step forward and his sword Qi soared to the sky, slashing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>He hated Lu Ming to the core.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually killed two of his subordinates right in front of him. That was just a small matter. Later on, Lu Ming had even lured him to this Valley and used the demonic bear’s power to deal with him. At the critical moment, Lu Ming had even launched a sneak attack on him and severely injured him. Such a great humiliation made him want to skin Lu Ming alive. Now that he saw Lu Ming, he immediately killed him.</p><p>A Pagoda was suspended above Lu Ming’s head. The bubble was hiding inside.</p><p>Bubble’s cultivation base was also improving rapidly. She refined the energy of the time and space spinel every day and had reached the ninth level of the martial Royal realm.</p><p>The space-time domain enveloped Lu Ming. With a sway of his body, he dodged Wan Tiancheng’s attack.</p><p>that’s the space-time domain! That Pagoda has the power of the space-time domain!</p><p>Zhao Kuang and Sima Liang’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“You want to leave? die!”</p><p>Wan Tiancheng coldly shouted. His body glowed with light spots, and Saint weapons appeared one after another. The Saint weapons whistled, and the battle weapon Qi was everywhere.</p><p>“I know the ten thousand soldiers art too!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. His body glowed as well, and holy weapons appeared.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Wan Tiancheng’s pupils suddenly enlarged, revealing a look of disbelief. He roared, ” “The ten thousand soldiers art? how is that possible? How did you manage to successfully cultivate it?”</p><p>Even Zhao Kuang and Sima Liang were dumbfounded.</p><p>The ten thousand soldiers scroll required the comprehension of the ten thousand soldiers territory to be cultivated successfully.</p><p>As for the 10000 soldier realm, it was extremely difficult for ordinary people to comprehend it. However, because of the WAN family’s physique, only some geniuses could comprehend the 10000 soldier realm and cultivate the 10000 soldier scroll.</p><p>But how did Lu Ming manage to cultivate the ten thousand soldiers scroll?</p><p>While Wan Tiancheng was in a daze, Lu Ming dashed into the cave with the help of bubbles.</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze across the cave as soon as he rushed in.</p><p>The first thing he saw was Feng Ling.</p><p>At this moment, Huang Ling seemed to be on the verge of turning into a Phoenix. Her entire body was bathed in the flames of the undying celestial Phoenix as she fought fiercely against more than ten figures.</p><p>“A puppet!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes swept across the crowd and realized that although the dozen or so figures fighting with Huang Ling were in human form, they had no signs of life. They were all puppets.</p><p>The combat strength of these puppets was extremely powerful. They were actually equivalent to the third stage of the half-Saint realm. They were existences that were affected by the laws.</p><p>Lu Ming scanned the cave again and realized that the cave was very wide. In the deepest part of the cave, there were two stone pillars. Something was suspended on each of the stone pillars.</p><p>One of them was a jade talisman while the other was a pitch-black key.</p><p>The map and key to the tomb of the reincarnation King!</p><p>This was the first thought that came to Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>However, around the stone pillar stood several humanoid puppets. At a glance, there were hundreds of them.</p><p>All of them were equivalent to the third stage of half-Saint.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming had only taken a few glances when some of the puppets let out cold shouts and charged toward him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
