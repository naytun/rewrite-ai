However, this time, could Qiu Ying Ying and su Lei, two girls, withstand the wheel battle from all sides?</p><p>Soon, it was the Yu Du sect’s turn.</p><p>...</p><p>that Qiu Ying Ying should be skilled in soul spirit attacks. With a powerful soul spirit, she can create illusions. As long as you remain unmoved and attack with your poisonous insects, you should be able to deal with Qiu Ying Ying!</p><p>Luo shuihan sent a message to a heaven’s favorite of the Yu Du sect.</p><p>The Yu Du sect’s elite’s eyes lit up. He cupped his fists at Luo shuihan to express his gratitude.</p><p>“Hmph, Lu Ming, don’t think that I can’t do anything to you just because you found someone who’s good at soul power. Watch her die this time!”</p><p>Luo shuihan looked at Lu Ming with cold eyes.</p><p>Sensing Luo shuihan’s gaze, Lu Ming’s lips curled into a faint cold smile.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The heaven’s favorite from the desire poison sect leaped onto the fighting stage and directly challenged Qiu Ying Ying.</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying stepped onto the fighting ring and stood at the side, not moving.</p><p>The two of them stood there facing each other. The chosen from the desire poison sect emanated a poisonous aura, as well as countless poisonous insects that flew out and circled around him.</p><p>However, the heaven’s favorite of the Yu Du sect did not make a move. Instead, the poisonous gas around him began to surge towards Qiu Ying Ying.</p><p>At this moment, Qiu Ying’s eyes turned pitch black, like two deep wells. They were pitch black and unfathomable.</p><p>At this moment, the heaven’s favorite from the desire poison sect found that the scene around him had changed. It had become a purgatory of Asura, with countless demons brandishing their demonic weapons and charging at him.</p><p>an illusion! This is all an illusion!</p><p>The desire poison sect’s heaven’s favorite silently told himself that he would stand still and let those evil demons slash at him.</p><p>Those demons rushed past like phantoms.</p><p>haha, it’s useless. It’s an illusion!</p><p>The young man from the desire poison sect was overjoyed. He activated his Zhen Yuan and constantly released poisonous gas to the front. At this moment, he was under an illusion and could not see where Qiu Ying Ying was. However, as long as the fighting stage was filled with poisonous gas, Qiu Ying Ying’s ordinary spiritual body and early Lv 6 Martial Emperor realm cultivation would not be able to resist for long.</p><p>At this time, Qiu Ying Ying stepped out and walked towards the Yu Du sect.</p><p>Many people were watching nervously. Previously, a heaven’s pride expert of the heavenly God sect was killed by Qiu Ying Ying in this way.</p><p>This time, would it be the same as last time?</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying arrived in front of the Yu Du sect’s heaven’s pride expert and thrust her sword out.</p><p>However, at this moment, the poisonous insects that were flying around the Yu Du sect’s heaven’s favorites suddenly turned into a sword and attacked towards Qiu Ying Ying. Qiu Ying Ying’s expression changed, and she quickly blocked with her sword. Her body trembled, and she was sent flying.</p><p>At the same time, wisps of poisonous gas crawled up Qiu Ying Ying’s body and corroded his protective true Yuan and domain.</p><p>haha, her move is useless now. The poisonous insects of the desire poison sect can sense her aura and attack on their own. This woman is dead for sure!</p><p>In the stands, Luo shuihan laughed and showed a proud look.</p><p>“Aren’t you afraid of being slapped in the face again?”</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at Luo shuihan indifferently.</p><p>Hmph, she’s skilled in soul power and can create illusions. Don’t think that I can’t see through it. However, illusions are useless now. With her own cultivation, she’s dead!</p><p>Luo shuihan sneered with a confident expression.</p><p>However, at this moment, the situation on the fighting ring suddenly changed.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Qiu Ying Ying shouted. Two pitch-black sword lights shot out from her eyes and pierced into the Yu Du sect’s Paragon’s body.</p><p>The desire poison sect’s chosen let out a blood-curdling screech as the poison within his body erupted. However, in the next moment, he fell straight down onto the battle stage.</p><p>Dead. The chosen of the desire poison sect had died, just like that!</p><p>How did this happen?</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>All they saw was Qiu Ying Ying’s cry, and the heaven’s favorite of the Yu Du sect was dead. This was a top-tier heaven’s favorite.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Luo shuihan smacked the seat with his palm, shattering it. His face was burning.</p><p>He had just said that Qiu Ying Ying was dead, and in the next moment, the Yu Du sect’s heaven’s favorite was dead.</p><p>This was like a slap on his face.</p><p>Luo shuihan, won’t your face swell? ” he asked.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled contemptuously.</p><p>All of this was within Lu Ming’s expectations.</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying’s current soul power was too strong. It was equivalent to the soul power of a ninth level Martial Emperor.</p><p>Before this, Qiu Ying Ying had only used her soul force, which was equivalent to a Lv 7 Martial Emperor realm expert. Just now, Qiu Ying Ying had directly burst out her strongest soul force and used the divine sword technique. The heaven’s favorite from the Yu Du sect was unable to resist it at all, and his soul was directly destroyed, dying on the spot.</p><p>In this competition where the strongest was only at the sixth level of the martial Royal realm, Qiu Ying Ying was undefeatable.</p><p>Three years ago, when Lu Ming participated in the treasure sealing assembly, his soul power was far from being as strong as Qiu Ying Ying’s now.</p><p>His contemptuous voice made Luo shuihan’s face turn red.</p><p>As for the heaven’s favorites from the deity sect, sky demon sect, and Yu Du sect, they were all silent.</p><p>She could kill a top-tier heaven’s favorite with a single shout. How could they fight?</p><p>Was there any use in a tag-team battle? Was he going to die?</p><p>With the opponent’s soul power, how many times could he launch such an attack?</p><p>They had no confidence at all.</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying kept the other party’s storage ring and returned to the platform, and the competition continued.</p><p>There were only two people left in the Dragon God Valley, but no one dared to challenge them.</p><p>Soon, it was Dragon God Valley’s turn. Su Lei stepped onto the fighting ring directly. Her eyes were fixed on a top genius of the tianshen sect.</p><p>The heaven’s pride expert of the tianshen sect had a serious expression on his face. After stepping onto the fighting ring and exchanging two moves with su Lei, he actually wanted to rush off the fighting ring and did not dare to continue fighting.</p><p>“The river of mysterious Yin!”</p><p>Su Lei copulated, and the river of Xuan Yin swept towards the other party like a huge wave.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The other party was extremely frightened. He burst forth with holy light to resist with all his might, but the result was death!</p><p>He had been frozen to death in the river of mysterious Yin.</p><p>The tianshen sect had already lost two top-notch heaven’s favorites.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>“What do we do? What should we do if this goes on? the two women from Dragon God Valley are perverts. We can’t defeat them!”</p><p>The heaven’s God sect, the sky demon sect, and the Yu Du sect’s paragons were all panicking.</p><p>Being targeted by su Lei and Qiu Yingying, only death awaited him.</p><p>This was especially so for the remaining peak experts of the three sects. They were the most afraid. With their talent, they didn’t want to die Here.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I will make the Dragon God Valley pay with their blood at the treasure auction!”</p><p>On the stand, Luo shuihan said coldly. Then she got up and left.</p><p>He didn’t want to see what would happen next. The result seemed to be already decided.</p><p>The remaining people of the three sects had lost the courage to fight and only wanted to save their lives.</p><p>Of course, he could save his life, but it would be very embarrassing.</p><p>Hmph!</p><p>Mo Yang also stood up and left after Luo shuihan.</p><p>Sure enough, when it was the tianshen sect’s turn to challenge, they sent out a top expert. However, they did not challenge Dragon God Valley, but instead challenged a top expert from the Tianyu demon sect.</p><p>Then, the two of them exchanged a few symbolic moves before they both left the fighting ring.</p><p>This caused everyone to look down on him.</p><p>Many people laughed, especially the disciples of the Dragon God Valley, who were not stingy with their ridicule.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
