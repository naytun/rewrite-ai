He spread his black wings and his eyes were filled with a strong desire to fight.</p><p>...</p><p>From the aura of the two assassins, it was obvious that they were first stage half-Saints who had mastered the ultimate domain.</p><p>Lu Ming’s spirit body had just completed its evolution and became a low-grade Celestial Spirit body. He wanted to test his combat power.</p><p>Before the spirit body evolved, Lu Ming was confident that he could fight against an ordinary first stage half-Saint.</p><p>What was an ordinary first stage half-Saint? They were existences who broke through to the half-Saint realm with ordinary spiritual bodies or low-grade spiritual bodies. However, the two people in front of him were obviously high-grade spiritual bodies. Their combat strength was by no means comparable to ordinary half-Saints.</p><p>there’s no need for two people to join forces to kill a Lv 7 martial Royal realm expert like you. I can do it alone!</p><p>One of the men in Black stepped out. In his hand, a long sword as thin as a cicada’s wing was faintly visible.</p><p>The other person stood still in the air.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The black-robed man in front of him moved. With a single move, his figure disappeared into the air without a trace.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>All of a sudden, there was a slight sound of the air being torn behind Lu Ming. A sharp sword radiance was aimed at the back of Lu Ming’s heart.</p><p>He was so fast. The other party had just moved and he had already appeared behind Lu Ming. Such a terrifying assassination technique was truly shocking.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Black Dragon Spear shook and swept behind him.</p><p>However, when the Black Dragon Spear swept past, the sharp intent disappeared. In the next moment, another sharp intent appeared in front of Lu Ming. The terrifying sword Qi had yet to reach Lu Ming, but it seemed as if it was going to tear him apart.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the black wings and slashed forward like a heavenly blade.</p><p>But just like before, the black wings slashed through the air, and the other party had already disappeared.</p><p>The other party’s speed was too fast. When he attacked, he was as fast as lightning. He could attack Lu Ming from all directions at any time.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The sound of air being torn suddenly rang out continuously, as if it was attacking Lu Ming from all directions. For a moment, Lu Ming did not know which side was real and which side was fake.</p><p>“Sweep!”</p><p>Lu Ming used the most domineering method and swept the Black Dragon Spear in all directions. However, there was no one in sight.</p><p>the assassination techniques of the thousand-kill mansion are indeed amazing. The body can be hidden, but the soul can’t!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. He then closed his eyes and released his spiritual consciousness to sense the other party’s soul fluctuations.</p><p>“Over there!”</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming felt an obscure soul fluctuation. Without any hesitation, he became one with his spear and stabbed in that direction.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The sound of metal clashing rang out. A black figure appeared and floated back in the void.</p><p>you’re only at Lv 7 Martial Emperor realm, but your soul power is very strong. You can actually find my location through soul fluctuations!</p><p>The Man in Black said, looking a little surprised.</p><p>“Your concealment technique is useless Against Me!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>haha, that was just a test. Since the art of concealment is useless against you, I’ll kill you head-on!</p><p>The Man in Black sneered, and the killing intent on his body became stronger.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Man in Black moved and pounced at Lu Ming. He was as fast as a black stream of light, leaving behind a series of afterimages. The terrifying sword Qi cut through the void and stabbed at Lu Ming.</p><p>If concealment didn’t work, he would directly attack.</p><p>Lu Ming was not afraid at all. A Dragon’s Roar sounded from his body as he stabbed with the long spear in his hand.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The long spear and the long sword clashed. Lu Ming could sense a terrifying destructive force on the other party’s sword. It flowed along the Black Dragon Spear and surged towards him.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated his quintessential essence and Chaos Domain to resist the force.</p><p>The two of them retreated at the same time.</p><p>extreme space-breaking domain!</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>His opponent’s territory had surpassed the ninth-level territory and reached the ultimate territory. It was also a space-breaking territory with amazing penetrating power.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The Man in Black retreated and charged at Lu Ming again. The sword-light filled the sky like stars.</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear trembled and shadows of the spear filled the sky, colliding with the other party continuously.</p><p>The sound of concentrated collisions rang out, and in the blink of an eye, the two had exchanged dozens of moves, neither of them being able to separate.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The black-robed man was like a Phantom as he retreated rapidly.</p><p>He looked at Lu Ming with a gaze full of surprise.</p><p>He had not expected Lu Ming’s combat strength to be so terrifying.</p><p>The other man in Black who was watching the battle from a distance also had a serious look in his eyes.</p><p>“Is this all you’ve got? You’re nothing more than this!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>you actually have a heavenly spiritual body. Can you kill a genius of my thousand kills Prefecture? but your cultivation is too weak. If your cultivation was one or two levels stronger, I wouldn’t be your opponent. But now, you still have to die!</p><p>The Man in Black said coldly. The long sword in his hand emitted a layer of strange black light.</p><p>thousand-kill sword technique, ten-step slash!</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The figure of the Man in Black instantly crossed the void. The terrifying sword light was like a flying immortal from beyond the heavens. He instantly slashed out ten swords, each of which contained extremely terrifying power.</p><p>This was a terrifying killing technique that could kill with a single strike.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze turned solemn.</p><p>The muscles on his body bulged as the Black Dragon Spear in his hand seemed to transform into a Black Dragon as it roared and shot out.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>There were consecutive collisions. Waves of terrifying sword Qi flowed along the spear and surged into Lu Ming’s body. However, they were all destroyed by Lu Ming’s powerful body.</p><p>thousand-kill sword technique, kill a hundred people!</p><p>The terrifying sword light rose again, and it was even more shocking than before.</p><p>A hundred people were killed with one sword!</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long hiss, his fighting spirit soaring to the heavens as he fought with his opponent.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>There was a sword wound on Lu Ming’s shoulder. However, it was healing rapidly under Lu Ming’s powerful spirit body.</p><p>To be honest, the combat strength of the Man in Black was indeed shocking. The main thing was that his cultivation was much higher than Lu Ming’s.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation was at the peak of the seventh level martial Royal realm, while the other party’s cultivation was at the first stage of half-Saint.</p><p>The gap between the peak of the ninth level Martial Emperor realm and the half-Saint realm was not as simple as one level. Therefore, the gap between the first stage half-Saint and the seventh level Martial Emperor realm was too big.</p><p>If it was an ordinary half-Saint, Lu Ming could naturally surpass it. However, the other party was also a prodigy with an upper-class earth spiritual body.</p><p>After exchanging hundreds of moves, Lu Ming was actually at a slight disadvantage.</p><p>“Not enough, far from enough!”</p><p>Lu Ming kept growling in his heart.</p><p>If he wanted to stimulate all his potential in a life-and-death battle, this kind of pressure was far from enough for him.</p><p>He needed the pressure of near-death to stimulate his potential and break through quickly.</p><p>“Is this all you’ve got? And you still dare to boast shamelessly about killing me? how laughable. You two, come at me together!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl, his fighting spirit growing stronger.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>The Man in Black found it hard to believe.</p><p>As a half-Saint, he could not even kill a Lv 7 martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>Even if he had the heavenly spiritual body, his combat strength couldn’t be so strong that he could cross so many realms and fight with him.</p><p>He had seen a heavenly spiritual body before. There were more than one heavenly spiritual body in the thousand-kill mansion. They were definitely not this strong.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
