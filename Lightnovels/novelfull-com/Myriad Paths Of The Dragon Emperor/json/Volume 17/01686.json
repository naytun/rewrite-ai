Beside him, someone was recording the number of wind cores Luo shuihan had.</p><p>Luo shuihan’s face was cold and arrogant. He didn’t believe that the others had more wind cores than him.</p><p>Following that, the other disciples of the heavenly God sect began to take out their wind cores.</p><p>The second person had a much smaller number of wind cores, only 25.</p><p>However, the next ten people each had twenty wind cores.</p><p>However, when it came to the 11th person, that person shook his head, indicating that he didn’t. Starting from the 11th person, the 10 people behind him all shook their heads and retreated to the side.</p><p>it seems that the core of wind of the Tian Shen sect has been redistributed and concentrated in the hands of the ten people with the strongest cultivation!</p><p>Zi Feng said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. It was obvious that they were not the only ones. The other sects had also been allocated their wind cores. The ones with weaker cultivations were given to those with stronger cultivations. They hoped that more people could enter the second round.</p><p>As expected, most of the sects that followed had already been allocated. Only those with strong cultivation bases had wind cores, while those with weak cultivation bases didn’t even have one.</p><p>Of course, it was impossible for every sect to have as many wind cores as the tianshen sect. The top ten people would each have more than twenty wind cores. Some sects would have at least ten wind cores in the top ten.</p><p>One by one, the sects went up.</p><p>Luo shuihan looked at Lu Ming and the others. She sneered, ” “What’s wrong? Why don’t you go up and check your wind core? aren’t you ashamed to see others?”</p><p>we have too many cores of wind. We’re afraid of scaring you!</p><p>Tian Chui grinned.</p><p>“Too many? You really are shameless!”</p><p>Luo shuihan laughed in disdain.</p><p>“Let’s go up!”</p><p>At this time, Zi Feng opened his mouth and stepped forward, coming in front of po yuangui. He waved his hand, and a pile of wind cores appeared in front of him, a total of 31 pieces.</p><p>haha, only 31 pieces. Zi Feng, among the monstrous talents of the Azure region, you are ranked last!</p><p>Luo shuihan sneered.</p><p>Indeed, the other geniuses who went up to count previously all had more than thirty pieces, with purple maple the least.</p><p>It wasn’t that the wind cores that Zi Feng himself had hunted were inferior to the other geniuses. It was obvious that some of the other geniuses had most likely taken some wind cores from other disciples, which was why they had more.</p><p>As for Zi Feng, he didn’t take it from anyone else in the Dragon God Valley.</p><p>He had the same thoughts as Lu Ming and the rest. It was fine as long as the quantity was enough.</p><p>Zi Feng smiled faintly and ignored Luo shuihan. Then, Lu Ming stepped forward. With a wave of his hand, 30 wind cores appeared.</p><p>Luo shuihan’s eyes narrowed, and then she sneered, ” “Thirty? It seems that the wind cores obtained by many Dragon God Valley disciples are all in your hands, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at Luo shuihan indifferently. His eyes were full of ridicule and contempt, which made Luo shuihan even more unhappy.</p><p>Following that, Tian Chui and Xue ningxin stepped forward respectively. Each of them took out thirty wind cores, which shocked the others.</p><p>Luo shuihan’s face became even gloomier. it seems that the Dragon God Valley has gathered all the wind cores in you. It’s not wise to give so many wind cores to two people in the first stage of the semi-sage realm. It seems that the Dragon God Valley will be at the bottom this time!</p><p>The others were moved. It seemed that this was most likely the case. Dragon God Valley had gathered most of their wind cores in the hands of Lu Ming and the others. That was why they had so many wind cores.</p><p>Otherwise, they wouldn’t believe that Tian Chui and Xue ningxin, who were both in the first stage of the half-Saint realm, could obtain 30 cores of wind.</p><p>“What an idiot!”</p><p>Tian Chui said contemptuously, which made Luo shuihan’s eyes turn cold.</p><p>Tian Chui, he actually dared to call him an idiot.</p><p>“You guys are looking for death!”</p><p>Luo shuihan’s eyes flashed sharply.</p><p>Then, the other people of Dragon God Valley stepped forward and took out their wind cores.</p><p>Twenty-six, twenty-five, twenty-three …</p><p>In the end, there were a total of fifteen people from Dragon God Valley, including Lu Ming and the rest. They had taken out more than twenty wind cores.</p><p>Luo shuihan was stunned, and so were the others.</p><p>“This … How is this possible?”</p><p>Someone cried out in disbelief.</p><p>This was especially true for the heaven’s favorites from the other sects. They were in disbelief. They knew how fast the demonic beasts were and how hard it was to catch them.</p><p>Dragon God Valley could actually obtain so many wind cores.</p><p>Luo shuihan’s face had turned red.</p><p>we don’t have many wind cores in Dragon God Valley, but only 15 people have obtained more than 20 wind cores. There are still five senior and junior brothers who didn’t get any. I’m ashamed, I’m ashamed!</p><p>Tian Chui deliberately stared at Luo shuihan and sighed.</p><p>Puchi …</p><p>Some of the onlookers laughed out loud, especially the people from Dragon God Valley.</p><p>Tian Chui was obviously mocking Luo shuihan.</p><p>some people just like to splash. Others don’t want to bother with them, but they stick their faces close to them all day long to get beaten. Do they like the feeling of being slapped so much? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s words were more direct and full of sarcasm.</p><p>Luo shuihan’s face was extremely gloomy, and her body was trembling with anger.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Luo shuihan finally calmed down. She snorted and said, ” “It’s just luck. When you enter the second round, you’ll have to rely on pure strength. At that time, let’s see how you all die.”</p><p>Luo shuihan, remember your words!</p><p>Lu Ming responded indifferently. For a moment, the Dragon God Valley and the tianshen sect were at daggers drawn.</p><p>Both parties retreated to the side and waited quietly.</p><p>Not long after, everyone was counted, and PO yuangui began to announce the rankings.</p><p>Po yuangui had only announced the top 80. Without exception, the top 15 of Dragon God Valley had all entered the second round. They had become the sect with the most number of people.</p><p>The heavenly God sect, which had the second most people, only had ten people.</p><p>The sect with the least number of people only had four people in the second round.</p><p>There were a total of 10 sects and 80 spots. On average, each sect only had eight spots, and Dragon God Valley had 15 spots, which was far beyond the average level.</p><p>Lu Ming’s ranking was at the ninth place, second only to Zi Feng.</p><p>Of course, the crowd did not think that Lu Ming’s combat strength would be enough to rank ninth and compete with the top ten geniuses of the Azure region.</p><p>The number of wind cores didn’t represent anything. Tian Chui and Xue ningxin both had thirty wind cores, tied with Lu Ming in the rankings.</p><p>There were also many people from Dragon God Valley who had more than 20 pieces, ranking in the 10th or 20th place.</p><p>Luck!</p><p>Many people thought that Dragon God Valley must have been so lucky to have obtained a large number of wind cores.</p><p>After the announcement, everyone returned to their seats and waited for the second round to begin.</p><p>Po yuangui looked around and began to announce the specific rules of the second round.</p><p>As mentioned before, the second round of the competition would be a rotation battle. Everyone would have to fight against the others one by one. Each victory would give one point.</p><p>In the end, the sect with the highest total score won.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
