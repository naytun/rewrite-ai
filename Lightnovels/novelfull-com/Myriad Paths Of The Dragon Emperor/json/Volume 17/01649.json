A huge pit appeared on the ground.</p><p>When the primal Chaos sky-turning seal disappeared, the giant lizard beast lay in the deep pit like a pool of mud. There was no sign of life.</p><p>...</p><p>The Saint stage lizard beast was dead. It was killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>On the other battlefield, the human Saint was terrified when he saw this. He was almost scared to death.</p><p>He could kill a Saint before he became a Saint!</p><p>Even though he was a member of the hundred clan battlefield and had seen countless foreign prodigies since he was young, it was still extremely rare for someone to have such a battle record.</p><p>For example, geniuses like Huang Ling, ye Dongfang, and the Golden Crow tenth Prince who had reached the third stage of the half-Saint realm could only fight with ordinary saints. It was impossible to kill them.</p><p>Unless it was an even stronger heaven’s favorite.</p><p>But now, Lu Ming had done it.</p><p>Even ye Dongfang and Huang Ling were shocked.</p><p>Even though they came from a huge Emperor-ranked power and had seen many things, such a battle record was extremely rare.</p><p>Most importantly, Lu Ming was only at the first stage of the half-Saint realm. If he could reach the second stage of the half-Saint realm, comprehend the laws, or even reach the third stage of the half-Saint realm, how terrifying would his combat power be?</p><p>The Saint tried his best to break out of the encirclement, but he was entangled by Huang Ling and ye Dongfang. He was hit by Huang Ling and almost burned half of his body.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, the Black Dragon Spear that had pierced into the giant lizard beast’s palm flew out and was put away by Lu Ming. He then looked around and finally found a storage ring in the giant lizard beast’s mouth.</p><p>Then, step by step, he walked toward the human Saint, which made the human saint’s heart turn cold.</p><p>12 Saint weapons surrounded Lu Ming. He held the Black Dragon Spear and charged at the human Saint like a bolt of Black Lightning.</p><p>There was no longer any suspense in this battle. With Lu Ming’s participation, the human saint’s fate was sealed.</p><p>In the end, it let out an indignant roar and was killed by Lu Ming and the other two.</p><p>As for the human saint’s storage ring, Huang Ling and ye Dongfang did not take it. They said that it was Lu Ming’s credit, so Lu Ming naturally took it without any hesitation.</p><p>“Brother Lu, miss Feng Ling, thank you for saving me!”</p><p>Ye Dong saluted Lu Ming and Feng Ling, his eyes filled with gratitude.</p><p>If not for Lu Ming and Huang Ling, he would have been surrounded by two saints and would have been in danger.</p><p>“It’s nothing, no need to be so polite. Brother ye, where are you going next?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>I was planning to go to the Alliance mountain. I heard that many disciples of the Thunder God sect are imprisoned there. I was going to save them, but I didn’t expect to be attacked by two saints!</p><p>Ye Dongfang said.</p><p>haha, that’s great. We’re going to Meng mountain too. How about we work together? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>Ye Dongfang’s eyes lit up and he said in joy, ” “That’s great, I can’t ask for more!”</p><p>The four of them immediately left and flew towards the Meng mountains.</p><p>Although ye Dongfang was slightly injured, it was not particularly serious. With his Thunder attribute heavenly spirit body, his vitality was extremely strong, and he could heal his injuries while flying.</p><p>Another day passed, and a majestic mountain appeared in front of the four.</p><p>The mountain was huge, lush, and full of towering trees.</p><p>This was the Alliance mountain!</p><p>The four of them didn’t approach. Instead, they hid in the clouds and watched from a distance.</p><p>With their eyesight, they could clearly see the situation on the mountain even from a distance.</p><p>At the top of the mountain, there was a flat piece of land. Many young people were sitting on it.</p><p>At a glance, there were at least a thousand of them. They were all prodigies from various sects and powers who had entered the hundred clan battlefield.</p><p>“A disciple of Phoenix Palace!”</p><p>Huang Ling said softly.</p><p>Among the crowd, she saw about 20 Phoenix Palace disciples.</p><p>At the same time, ye Dongfang also discovered the disciples of Thunder God Palace.</p><p>There were powerhouses standing guard around these young men.</p><p>There were humans and terrifying alien races, one in each direction. There were four of them in total, and they were obviously All Saints.</p><p>In other areas of the mountain, there were also figures moving, but they were all below the Saint realm.</p><p>only four sage realm experts? ”</p><p>A flash of lightning appeared in ye Dongfang’s eyes, but he did not act rashly.</p><p>“The various races of the hundred clan battlefield have been planning this for a long time. Their main goal is to kill a large number of prodigies. But now, there are so many people imprisoned here. They’re clearly trying to lure us here for an ambush. I’m guessing that there are many powerful existences hidden in the dark!”</p><p>Lu Ming speculated.</p><p>yes. Otherwise, we wouldn’t have known that they were being escorted here so easily. I’m afraid that the locals have already received the news. As long as we ask, they will tell us the news!</p><p>Huang Ling also nodded.</p><p>“Then what should we do? We can’t just sit here and do nothing. After a few days, the other party might really make a move!”</p><p>Ye Dongfang said anxiously.</p><p>“I have an idea, but we don’t have enough people. We still need some help!”</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Lu Ming said.</p><p>there are many disciples of the sects and forces who have been captured here. There will definitely be others coming to rescue them. We will contact them secretly and attack together!</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>The four of them observed for a while, then retreated to a cloud in the distance to observe from a distance.</p><p>In another direction of Lu Ming’s group of four, two figures in golden robes stood in a mass of clouds.</p><p>One of them was the tenth golden Crow Prince, and the other was also a member of the Golden Crow race.</p><p>“Crown Prince, what do we do now? There are more than a dozen people in my clan. If they capture us, should we save them or not?”</p><p>The Golden Crow race member asked.</p><p>“Save? How? The other side has many experts and is obviously waiting for us to take the bait. In order to save them, we put ourselves in danger. Do you think it’s worth it?”</p><p>The Golden Crow tenth Prince said coldly.</p><p>&Nbsp; the Golden Crow race member lowered his head and didn’t speak.</p><p>“Let’s go. Leave the hundred clan battlefield!”</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince said coldly. He then retreated and disappeared.</p><p>Following that, more and more people came to watch from afar.</p><p>However, there were some who did the same thing as the Golden Crow tenth Prince and immediately backed out. There were others who were unwilling to give up and paced back and forth in the surroundings, hiding and watching from a distance.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other three flew toward a mountain peak where four young geniuses were.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>The four of them looked at Lu Ming and the rest at the same time.</p><p>“It’s you guys?”</p><p>The four of them were stunned.</p><p>“Xia ding, the four of you should also want to save him, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward.</p><p>The four of them were Xia ding and the other three who had attacked Lu Ming and Huang Ling in an attempt to steal the map and key to the tomb of the Samsara King.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Xia ding stared at Lu Ming and said cautiously.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current combat strength was extremely shocking. If he were to take revenge and attack them, the four of them would not be a match for Lu Ming even if they joined forces.</p><p>“How about we join forces? We also want to save people!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Join hands?”</p><p>Xia ding and the other three’s gazes flickered before they turned to look at Huang Ling and ye Dongfang.</p><p>“Alright, we agree to join hands!”</p><p>After a moment of silence, Xia ding nodded his head.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
