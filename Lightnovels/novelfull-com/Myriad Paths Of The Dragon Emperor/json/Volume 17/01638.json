One hour, one hour after another.</p><p>They had walked for a full day, but they were still in the passage. It was as if the passage really had no end.</p><p>...</p><p>But at this point, no one would give up. Everyone continued to move forward.</p><p>Very quickly, ten days had passed, and they were still moving forward in the passageway.</p><p>At this time, many people frowned. No matter how patient they were, they couldn’t help but feel a little anxious.</p><p>Was this passage really leading to the tomb of the reincarnation King?</p><p>However, since they had already come this far, it was impossible for them to retreat. They could only continue forward.</p><p>Soon, another five days passed.</p><p>“I can see the end!”</p><p>Suddenly, someone shouted in excitement.</p><p>In front of them, the passage was finally about to end. From a distance, it seemed to be a land of darkness.</p><p>Everyone heaved a sigh of relief. They had walked for half a month in a passageway with nothing. The key was that they had no idea how long they had to walk. This was a test of their patience.</p><p>Fortunately, they were all peerless geniuses who had dared to come to the hundred clan battlefield to temper themselves. They were outstanding in all aspects, and they naturally didn’t lack patience. That was why they had been able to persevere until now.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Immediately, everyone’s spirits were lifted. They began to speed up and rush forward, afraid that if they were one step slower than others, the opportunity would be taken by others.</p><p>Lu Ming and Huang Ling also sped up. Very soon, they rushed out of the passage and stepped into a land of darkness.</p><p>As soon as they rushed out of the tunnel, they felt their bodies lighten. The pressure disappeared, and they regained their ability to fly.</p><p>However, after everyone rushed out of the tunnel, they all stood in the air and looked ahead in shock.</p><p>A grave!</p><p>What entered their eyes were all tombs. They were densely packed, and they didn’t know how many there were. At a glance, it was boundless.</p><p>These tombs were of different sizes. Some of them were just mounds, while others were as large as mountains.</p><p>“How could this be? Why are there so many tombs here? isn’t it the tomb of the reincarnation King?”</p><p>Someone asked doubtfully.</p><p>There were so many tombs. Could it be that the tomb of the reincarnation King was among them and he had to search for it one by one?</p><p>these tombs might also bury important figures and have treasures!</p><p>Someone murmured, causing everyone’s eyes to light up.</p><p>That’s right, those who could be buried here probably didn’t have small origins. There might be treasures here. Then, with so many here, wouldn’t he be rich?</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Instantly, they moved. One figure after another scuttled out and rushed toward the tombs.</p><p>They were searching for their target. Each of them found a tomb and rushed over.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Huang Ling. He had a feeling that things were not as simple as they seemed.</p><p>The two of them carefully moved forward and flew into the area of the grave.</p><p>However, just as they were approaching the graves, the graves closest to them began to glow. Then, figures emerged from the graves.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>There were men and women, young and old among these figures. Many of them were not even human, but they all roared and charged at Lu Ming and the others. The terrifying power was shocking.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>One of the heaven’s favorites was not careful and was pierced by the spear. If he did not retreat quickly, he would have died.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A terrifying sword light shot towards Lu Ming. Lu Ming threw a punch and it collided with the sword light. With a clang, the sword light was sent flying, and Lu Ming felt his fist go numb.</p><p>“What a terrifying attack!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>The figure that emerged from the grave roared continuously and charged towards them.</p><p>These figures were not corporeal and looked like phantoms.</p><p>The Golden Crow tenth Prince was attacked by a giant bull. He transformed into his true form and fought with the giant bull. His battle power was shocking, and he tore the giant bull into pieces in one move. But the shocking thing was that the giant bull didn’t die. It re-formed and attacked the Golden Crow tenth Prince.</p><p>The others were in the same situation. Even if they destroyed the Phantoms, they would re-form.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The one who attacked Lu Ming was an illusory human figure that looked like an old man. The sword light that was constantly released was extremely mysterious and enveloped Lu Ming’s entire body.</p><p>Lu Ming cast the ten thousand soldiers art. He held the Black Dragon Spear and thrust out cui zang’s spear radiance, which collided with the sword radiance.</p><p>After exchanging dozens of blows, Lu Ming’s spear shattered the figure. However, the figure immediately condensed again.</p><p>these are formed from the immortal fighting spirit of the experts after their death. They are undying. There must be peerless experts buried under these tombs!</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>“I’ll break it and see!”</p><p>Zhao Kuang let out a furious roar and forced the figure that was attacking him to retreat. He then attacked a large tomb at the side.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The terrifying attack landed on the tomb, but the tomb didn’t move at all. It wasn’t damaged at all.</p><p>However, at this moment, a shocking scene appeared. Beams of light shot out from the tomb and directly wrapped around Zhao Kuang.</p><p>Zhao Kuang struggled madly, but it was useless. Then, with a bang, one of his arms exploded.</p><p>“Ah, help, help me …”</p><p>Zhao Kuang cried out in fear.</p><p>However, before he could finish his sentence, his entire body exploded with a bang. Blood splattered on the large tomb, and his body and soul were destroyed.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss …</p><p>The crowd gasped.</p><p>A powerful heaven’s favorite had died just like that because he had attacked the tomb.</p><p>these tombs all have terrifying nomological powers. As long as you attack the tombs, you will be attacked by the nomological powers!</p><p>Ye Dongfang said with a serious face.</p><p>that’s right. The laws of this tomb are invincible. Once you’re entangled, you’ll die!</p><p>Someone else said.</p><p>Many people felt a lingering fear.</p><p>It was a good thing that Zhao Kuang had attacked the tomb first, otherwise, they would have been the ones to die.</p><p>This was especially true for Sima Liang. He had been with Zhao Kuang the entire time and had almost attacked just now. However, Zhao Kuang had been a step faster than him. When he saw the abnormality in the tomb, he had stopped his attack and avoided the disaster.</p><p>It seemed like they couldn’t attack this tomb at all. If they did, they would die.</p><p>Perhaps, only the tomb of the reincarnation Emperor could be opened?</p><p>Everyone thought to themselves. Then, they began to search for the tomb of the reincarnation Emperor while fending off the attacks of the shadows.</p><p>However, they couldn’t find the tomb of the reincarnation King after searching for a long time.</p><p>And if this continued, it would be very disadvantageous for them, as their true Qi would be completely consumed.</p><p>“There is a path ahead. Keep going forward. Maybe the tomb of the reincarnation King is right in front of that path!” Jiang Chen said.</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>Many people nodded. They had all seen that path.</p><p>However, on both sides of the road, there were two particularly huge tombs, far above the other tombs. This made many people pay attention and not rashly go up.</p><p>“If you guys don’t go, I’ll go!”</p><p>The Taotie opened its mouth and rushed towards the path.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The two particularly large tombs lit up, and two figures appeared.</p><p>A true dragon and a Phoenix emitted a terrifying aura.</p><p>Moreover, these two figures were much more solid than the other illusory figures.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
