He was ten times more terrifying than any assassin from the residence of thousand kills that Lu Ming had encountered before.</p><p>He was definitely a heaven’s pride expert on the same level as the blood prison young master, Wan Tiancheng, and the others. Moreover, he was an assassin.</p><p>If it were any other heaven’s favorite like the blood prison young master, they would have been killed by this sword without any doubt.</p><p>But Lu Ming was not just anyone!</p><p>During this period, he had been on guard against the assassins of thousand-kill mansion no matter where he was, even in the war.</p><p>Therefore, he had sensed it the moment the assassin from thousand-kills mansion made his move.</p><p>He had not let bubbles make a move because he was on guard against the assassins from thousand-kill Manor.</p><p>Therefore, when the sword light pierced Lu Ming’s body, his body shattered like glass. Lu Ming’s body had already reappeared more than ten meters away.</p><p>At the critical moment, bubbles made a move. She used the space-time domain to move Lu Ming more than ten meters away while the chaos sky-turning stamp continued to suppress him.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The primal Chaos sky-turning seal, which was used at full power, struck young master blood prison’s body. His body instantly exploded and turned into a ball of blood light.</p><p>The blood light wriggled and tried to escape, but the terrifying power of the primal Chaos sky-turning stamp was constantly obliterating young master blood prison.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>The young master of blood prison let out an unwilling and miserable cry. Then, the mass of blood light was completely obliterated and disappeared from the world.</p><p>The young master of blood prison was dead!</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, another sword gleam was aimed at Lu Ming. It was shockingly fast and powerful.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was already prepared.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch at the sword radiance. The sword radiance trembled and a man in Black appeared. He borrowed the power of Lu Ming’s punch and retreated rapidly.</p><p>The second attack was blocked by Lu Ming again. The other party knew that the assassination had failed and wanted to retreat!</p><p>“Stay here!”</p><p>Lu Ming kicked the Black Dragon Spear. The Black Dragon Spear turned into a Black bolt of lightning and shot towards the other party. Lu Ming used the thunderwind steps and took a step forward. He grabbed a combat sword beside him and slashed.</p><p>A 10,000-meter long sword light slashed toward the Man in Black.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The Man in Black was extremely fast. His figure flashed non-stop, leaving a trail of afterimages behind him. He first dodged the Black Dragon Spear’s attack, then slashed out a sword gleam that collided with Lu Ming’s sword gleam.</p><p>However, at this moment, a transparent bubble suddenly appeared around the black-robed man’s body, enveloping him within. His body instantly stiffened.</p><p>The second body controlled the Yin Yang fish sword and slashed at the other party.</p><p>The assassin in Black’s body suddenly turned illusionary, and then an amazing sword light burst out, breaking the transparent bubble in one stroke. He wanted to escape, but he was still one step too late.</p><p>The black sword of the Yin Yang fish sword slashed his body, almost cutting him in half at the waist. Fresh blood scattered in the sky.</p><p>The assassin in black roared and his body was covered in a layer of black mist. His speed suddenly increased and he disappeared into the void in a few flashes.</p><p>The assassins of the thousand-kill mansion were too powerful. They failed to kill their target and wanted to retreat. Even Lu Ming could not keep them here.</p><p>All of this seemed to take a long time, but it actually happened in an instant.</p><p>At this moment, many of the surrounding onlookers finally reacted and gasped.</p><p>the young master of blood prison is dead!</p><p>heavens, Lu Ming killed the young master of blood prison. He died at the hands of a Lv 9 martial Royal realm martial artist. Unbelievable!</p><p>“Lu Ming is a Shura, and he’s become stronger again. Also, what’s that body? Could it be a clone? but it doesn’t look like it!”</p><p>even the assassins of the thousand-kill mansion were injured and forced to retreat. It’s too terrifying!</p><p>The scene was in a clamor. Many people were discussing excitedly and were shocked by Lu Ming’s strength and means.</p><p>In drunken immortal restaurant, young master Tianying was no longer calm. He stood high in the sky and looked into the distance. At this moment, his face was extremely gloomy.</p><p>“That blood prison is really courting death!”</p><p>Holding a wine cup, Huang Ling walked to young master Tianying’s side and spoke indifferently.</p><p>“You already knew about Lu Ming’s ability?”</p><p>Young master Tianying said through gritted teeth.</p><p>“Hehe, what do you think?”</p><p>Huang Ling smiled.</p><p>Young master Tianying’s face was as black as charcoal. It was obvious that Huang Ling knew that young master blood prison was no match for Lu Ming, which was why she had been so calm.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Young master Tianying snorted coldly. With a wave of his sleeve, he stepped into the air and left.</p><p>“This Lu Ming is the number one person!”</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince placed his hands behind his back and spoke calmly before stepping into the air and leaving.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it looks like you’ve become stronger again!”</p><p>Phoenix Palace! Phoenix spirit muttered and flew toward the Phoenix Palace.</p><p>Soon, Huang Ling returned to the Phoenix Palace.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you alright?”</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>“I’m fine!”</p><p>“Feng Ling, it seems like there’s a traitor in your Phoenix Palace!” Lu Ming shook his head.</p><p>&Nbsp; the blood prison young Master’s Men had been able to sneak into his room without making a sound, which meant that someone from the Phoenix Palace had helped him. Otherwise, it would have been impossible.</p><p>“I will investigate this matter!”</p><p>Her voice turned cold as she glanced at the disciples of Phoenix Palace. The disciples ‘expressions changed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t you find it strange that the local Sage Stage powerhouse of Darkwater city didn’t make a move this time?”</p><p>Huang Ling said.</p><p>“Indeed!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He also felt that this was a little strange.</p><p>The two of them discussed for a while but could not come to a conclusion. They could only guess that the local saint stage powerhouses were not around.</p><p>However, he heard that there was more than one sage realm expert in Darkwater city. It couldn’t be that all of them were gone!</p><p>Since she could not figure it out, she did not think too much about it. Huang Ling arranged a new courtyard for Lu Ming to stay in.</p><p>The surrounding crowd also dispersed, and the news of this battle quickly spread throughout Darkwater city.</p><p>This battle had made Lu Ming famous. To be able to kill a genius like the young master of blood prison, in the eyes of many, Lu Ming was even more terrifying than Huang Ling.</p><p>They finally knew why Huang Ling and Lu Ming had the map and key to the tomb of the Samsara King. It was because Lu Ming had the ability to do so.</p><p>The crowd no longer dared to underestimate Lu Ming, who was a Lv 9 martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>Of course, there was another matter that had a huge impact.</p><p>Why didn’t the local saint stage powerhouses make a move? this matter was very strange and everyone had different opinions.</p><p>However, in the next few days, this topic became even more heated.</p><p>This was because there had been a few more battles in Darkwater city these few days, but none of the local Saints had made a move.</p><p>This made many people wonder if the native sages had stopped caring about the situation. In other words, they could attack as they pleased in the city, just like they did outside.</p><p>As soon as this statement came out, everyone in Darkwater city was in danger.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
