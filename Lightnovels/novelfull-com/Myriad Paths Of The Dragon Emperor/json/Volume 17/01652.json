There will be other sage realm experts as well!</p><p>Lu Ming watched the other party leave and pondered in his heart.</p><p>...</p><p>Now, he could only stay here for a while.</p><p>Lu Ming walked deeper into the tombs and soon arrived at the intersection.</p><p>On both sides of the road, above the two tombs, the shadow of a true dragon and the shadow of a Phoenix appeared.</p><p>The two shadows were very powerful. However, with Lu Ming’s current combat strength, with the help of his clone and bubbles, he managed to rush past them and arrived at the yellow spring River.</p><p>At this point, Lu Ming summoned the mountain and river diagram. The mountain and river diagram glowed, and Huang Ling, ye Dongfang, and the others, as well as those who were saved by Lu Ming, all appeared by the yellow spring River.</p><p>“This place … Is it the tomb of the reincarnation King?”</p><p>Huang Ling, ye Dongfang, and the others recognized this place as soon as they came out.</p><p>As for those who had never come in, they looked around in confusion. When they saw the yellow spring River, their faces turned ugly.</p><p>“Yes, this is the tomb of the reincarnation King!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was grave. it looks like we’ll have to spend the rest of our days here. The other party is too powerful. With my cultivation, I can’t shake him off. I can only hide here for now!</p><p>“It’s already not bad to be able to reach this point. What plans do you have next?”</p><p>After Huang Ling finished speaking, she looked at Lu Ming. Not only was Lu Ming’s combat strength shocking, but he was also very resourceful and meticulous. He had left a deep impression on her.</p><p>cultivate and improve. We’ll charge out when we’re strong enough!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming had saved nearly five hundred people.</p><p>Most of these people were heaven’s favorites with upper-grade earth spiritual bodies, and there were also people with heaven spiritual bodies. As long as their strength improved one more step, they would be able to join forces and charge out.</p><p>we can cultivate here without worry. The local Saints won’t be able to enter!</p><p>Lu Ming told them about the changes in the grave and everyone was relieved.</p><p>“Lu Ming, no matter what, it’s all thanks to you this time. Otherwise, we definitely wouldn’t have been able to save her!”</p><p>Huang Ling said sincerely.</p><p>that’s right. This time, it’s all thanks to Lu Ming. Regardless of whether I can escape successfully or not, I, ye Dongfang, will remember this favor!</p><p>Ye Dongfang said.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s our fault for attacking you back then. I hope you don’t take it to heart!”</p><p>Xia ding and the other three stepped forward and thanked Lu Ming.</p><p>it’s fine. I promised to help Feng Ling save the people of the Phoenix Palace. Saving you is just a convenient way!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Following that, everyone split up in groups of two or three, looking for a place to cultivate.</p><p>Lu Ming returned to the bridge of helplessness but Meng Po was nowhere to be seen. Lu Ming sized up the vortex and did not jump down in the end. He sat cross-legged on the bridge and devoured the rough stones to regulate his breathing.</p><p>When Lu Ming’s cultivation had recovered, he entered the mountain and river diagram and went to the path-understanding ancient tree.</p><p>Previously, when Lu Ming put Huang Ling and the others into the mountain and river diagram, he had hidden it well. Therefore, Huang Ling and the others did not see Lu Ming’s path-understanding ancient tree.</p><p>After all, the path-understanding ancient tree was too precious. There would be unnecessary trouble if someone saw it.</p><p>As for the mountain and river diagram, although it was precious, everyone present was a heaven’s favorite of an Emperor-ranked force. Naturally, they had seen similar Grotto-heaven treasures before and were not too surprised.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged under the path-understanding ancient tree, quietly comprehending the path and comprehending the chaos realm. He hoped that he could cultivate the chaos realm into chaos laws as soon as possible.</p><p>As long as he cultivated the chaos realm into the chaos laws and entered the second stage of the half-Saint realm, Lu Ming’s strength would skyrocket. By then, he would have no fear when he faced the existences at the great mastery of the bright Saint realm. He was confident that he could even withstand a few moves from an expert at the peak of the bright Saint realm.</p><p>At that time, his chances of escaping would increase greatly.</p><p>At the same time, he was also cultivating his second body.</p><p>He had already lit 10 spirit lamps to refine his second body. Next, he would also use inscriptions to communicate with the laws and enter the second stage of the half-Saint realm.</p><p>Bubbles was also in the midst of her cultivation.</p><p>It was the same for the others. In this area, no one would disturb them, and everyone was focused on improving their strength.</p><p>Outside, there were Saint realm experts from various races. Everyone was under great pressure. With great pressure, they could improve faster and turn the pressure into strength.</p><p>Day after day, time flew by.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a month had passed.</p><p>The inscription refining secondary body had been cultivated to the limit. It seemed that he could communicate with the laws at any time and enter the second stage of the half-Saint realm.</p><p>However, at this moment, Lu Ming had to consider which law was the best for the inscription refinement clone to cultivate.</p><p>In the Saint realm, one could only control one kind of law. When one broke through to the Saint realm, one would use the law as the foundation and condense the Saint heart.</p><p>In the Dao of inscription, one could use inscriptions to borrow the energy of heaven and earth. Of course, one could also use this to comprehend the laws.</p><p>However, most of those laws were ordinary laws, such as metal, wood, water, fire, and so on.</p><p>However, there were three extremely powerful laws in the Dao of inscription.</p><p>They were the laws of array Dao, weapon Dao, and pill Dao.</p><p>These three laws were extremely powerful. Mastering each of them was extremely terrifying and difficult to comprehend. They were Supreme laws in the hearts of those who cultivated the Dao of inscription.</p><p>Even if it couldn’t be compared to the chaos laws, it was still a powerful law close to the chaos laws.</p><p>Lu Ming’s ambition was to comprehend one of the laws.</p><p>Which one should he comprehend?</p><p>It was the array Dao laws!</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming made up his mind.</p><p>The laws of array Dao could evolve into endless offensive and defensive techniques. They were ever-changing and endless.</p><p>Legend had it that after someone had comprehended the array Dao laws, they would use the array Dao laws to derive the destruction array Dao, the destruction array Dao, and so on. They all had terrifying abilities that could destroy the heavens and earth.</p><p>Although the array Dao laws were extremely difficult to comprehend, Lu Ming had the Tai Chi formation disk, which seemed to contain the array Dao laws.</p><p>After choosing the direction, he began to cultivate again.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another three months had passed.</p><p>It had been four months since they entered the tomb of the reincarnation King.</p><p>At this moment, the second body was at the critical moment of cultivation.</p><p>In the mountain and river diagram, ten golden spiritual lamps appeared on top of Ming Lian’s head. They formed a golden pillar of fire that shot into the sky as if it was trying to communicate with the law.</p><p>The Tai Chi disk array floated in the air, emitting a strange light that fell on Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a strange power descended from the sky and landed on the body of the clone. At that moment, dense runes appeared on the body of the clone.</p><p>These runes were similar to inscriptions, but they were of a much higher grade.</p><p>This was the embodiment of the array Dao law. Lu Ming and the rest had comprehended the array Dao law.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly stood up and struck out with his palm. Dense runes appeared on his palm and formed a dazzling combat sword. He slashed forward and a sword Qi split a small hill into two.</p><p>Then, he took a step forward, and runes appeared. They condensed into a true dragon that flew out.</p><p>amazing! Is this the array Dao law? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with surprise.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
