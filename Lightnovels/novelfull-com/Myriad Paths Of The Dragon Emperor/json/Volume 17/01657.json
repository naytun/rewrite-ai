They might know, which was why Lu Ming asked.</p><p>It had been more than ten years since he parted with Qiu Yue. Lu Ming missed her and wondered how she was doing.</p><p>“The only one in the world?”</p><p>Huang Ling, ye Dongfang, and the others looked at each other, deep in thought.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Miss Huang Ling, brother ye, you don’t know either?”</p><p>Lu Ming felt slightly disappointed.</p><p>the only one in the world. The one who dares to be so arrogant and use this title is most likely the ‘only holy temple’.</p><p>Huang Ling frowned.</p><p>“I think so too. Other than the one and only divine temple, who would dare to claim to be the only one in the world!”</p><p>Ye Dongfang said.</p><p>“Where is the one and only holy temple? Is it an Emperor-ranked power?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he quickly asked.</p><p>although the sole divine temple is in Yuan mountain, it’s not in Gu Yue Holy Land, but in another Holy Land. Furthermore, the sole divine temple is an extremely terrifying force. The cultivators of the sole divine temple are extremely powerful!</p><p>I heard that there aren’t many disciples from the sole divine temple, but every one of them is said to be the only one in the world. For example, a disciple from the sole divine temple cultivates the nomological laws of fire. This person is unique and extremely powerful, able to suppress other geniuses who cultivate the nomological laws of fire!</p><p>there’s only one genius in the world who can suppress other nomological laws by cultivating other nomological laws. This is how it came about!</p><p>Huang Ling explained.</p><p>“Every single one of them is the only one in the world?”</p><p>Lu Ming found it hard to believe.</p><p>The yuan continent was so vast and experts were as common as clouds. Although there were tens of thousands of laws, there were even more people who cultivated them. There were probably many people who cultivated each law, especially common laws like the law of fire and the law of water. Who could say that they were the best and the only one in the world?</p><p>The only holy temple’s tone was too arrogant.</p><p>the title of the only divine temple is a little too much. There are so many heaven’s favorites in the world, so how could they dare to claim that they are the only one? however, I have to say that the people from the only divine temple are indeed extremely terrifying. Their combat strength is terrifying, and there are few who can match them!</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>that’s right. I’ve heard that there are some experts from the sole divine temple who travel the world all year round in search of people with extraordinary talent. They bring them back to the sole divine temple to cultivate and nurture them!</p><p>Ye Dongfang added.</p><p>Ye Dongfang’s words made Lu Ming’s eyes light up.</p><p>The sole divine temple had experts who travelled the world in search of people with outstanding talent to bring back to the sole divine temple for cultivation. It was very likely that someone would have found Qiu Yue in the divine wilderness.</p><p>Lu Ming had found some clues. No matter what, he had to make a trip to the one and only divine temple in the future.</p><p>“Thank you, everyone, for clearing up Lu Ming’s doubts!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>brother Lu, you’re too kind. I’ll take my leave first. We have to report the hundred clan battlefield to the sect as soon as possible to prevent more prodigies from entering!</p><p>Ye Dongfang said.</p><p>After that, the others also bade farewell to Lu Ming one after another.</p><p>In the end, Huang Ling and the people from the Phoenix Palace also took their leave, leaving only Lu Ming, Yun Xi, and a few others.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Yun Xi and the rest nodded subconsciously. Unknowingly, Lu Ming had established a strong prestige in their hearts.</p><p>This place was very close to the teleportation formation of the cloud Emperor mountain. Not long after, they arrived at the teleportation formation and stepped into it, returning to the cloud Emperor mountain.</p><p>After returning to the cloud Emperor mountain, the elder who had gone to fetch Lu Ming and the cloud Dragon Valley master came to Lu Ming and told him a piece of news.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley had asked him to pass on a message to Lu Ming. The cloud Dragon Valley master was busy during this period of time. If Lu Ming returned from the hundred clan battlefield, he could return to the Azure continent alone.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists at the old man.</p><p>The old man nodded and brought Lu Ming out of the cloud Emperor mountain. Then, Lu Ming took out the space-breaking shuttle and flew in the direction of the Azure continent.</p><p>The cloud Emperor mountain was very far from the Cang region, especially from the Dragon God Valley. Even the cloud Dragon Valley master had to spend two days to get there.</p><p>Given the speed of Lu Ming’s low-level space-piercing shuttle, it would take him a month to get back to Dragon God Valley.</p><p>However, since there were still four months before the treasure sealing assembly, Lu Ming was not in a hurry. He could just rush back slowly.</p><p>While they were on the road, they could cultivate.</p><p>The higher one’s cultivation was, the more numb one would be to time.</p><p>A Martial Emperor could live for ten to twenty thousand years.</p><p>Saints had a lifespan of more than 100000 years.</p><p>Some people would go into closed-door cultivation for a few years, or even decades. It might take hundreds or even thousands of years to break through one level of cultivation.</p><p>A month’s time was really nothing.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged in the space-breaking flying shuttle. A few storage rings appeared in his hands.</p><p>Lu Ming had obtained these storage rings after killing a few Saints from the hundred clan battlefield.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had not checked and counted. Now was the perfect time to do so.</p><p>Not long after, he finished counting. Even with Lu Ming’s temperament, he was dumbfounded.</p><p>I’m rich, I’m really rich.</p><p>There were too many treasures and raw gemstones inside.</p><p>There were more than a hundred Saint weapons.</p><p>A total of 150 Saint weapons. What a huge number.</p><p>On second thought, Lu Ming understood.</p><p>This time, the local Saints had killed many heaven’s favorites from outside forces. Almost all of these heaven’s favorites had a Saint weapon. The Saints had collected a lot of Saint weapons.</p><p>There were also raw gemstones that were piled up like a mountain. He did not know how many there were. In short, it would be enough for Lu Ming to use for a period of time.</p><p>I’m cultivating the ten thousand soldiers scroll, and I need a large number of holy weapons. I don’t lack them now. I’ll use this time to cultivate the ten thousand soldiers scroll!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had been focused on comprehending the Laws of Chaos and had put everything else aside. He had not cultivated the ten thousand soldiers scroll.</p><p>When he was at the ninth tier of the martial Royal realm, Lu Ming could seal 12 holy weapons. Now that he had broken through to the second stage of the half-Saint realm, comprehended the law of chaos, and even refined a wisp of true Qi of chaos in his body, how many holy weapons could he seal in his body?</p><p>Lu Ming himself was looking forward to it.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately began to cultivate. He circulated the ten thousand soldiers art and began to seal the Holy weapon in his acupuncture points.</p><p>The thirteenth round was completed easily without any feeling.</p><p>Then, the fourteenth, the fifteenth …</p><p>In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed. Lu Ming had already left the clouds Plains and entered the Azure Plains.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
