The power was extremely shocking.</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming activated the prison suppressing heavenly art and threw a punch as well, matching the puppet’s punch.</p><p>There was a loud noise and Lu Ming’s body swayed slightly. He felt his arm go numb.</p><p>“What powerful strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming could feel that the puppet’s strength was comparable to Xu Ran’s.</p><p>Xu Ran’s cultivation was at the second stage of the half-Saint realm, but he had a superior earth spiritual body. He could fight above his level, which was equivalent to an ordinary third stage half-Saint.</p><p>“Kill! Kill! Kill!”</p><p>Then, more puppets pounced at Lu Ming. There were more than a dozen of them. With so many puppets attacking at the same time, the power was shocking. No wonder Wan Tiancheng and the others were forced to retreat.</p><p>These puppets were even more difficult to deal with than martial artists of the same level, because they were not afraid of death. Their skin was as hard as copper and their bones were as hard as iron. When they fought, their combat strength was extremely shocking.</p><p>Lu Ming did not dare to take on so many puppets head-on. With the help of bubbles, his figure flickered continuously and he dodged the puppets.</p><p>Behind him, at the entrance of the cave, Wan Tiancheng also rushed in, but he was also besieged by many puppets.</p><p>The strength of a single puppet was limited, but when a dozen of them worked together, their might was terrifying. Even a heaven’s favorite like Wan Tiancheng was suppressed.</p><p>In the end, he unwillingly retreated.</p><p>With the help of the bubbles, Lu Ming was in danger.</p><p>On the other side, Huang Ling was bathed in divine fire. She kept charging inside, trying to break through the puppets ‘encirclement and get the map and key of the tomb of the reincarnation King.</p><p>the undying Heavenly Phoenix body is indeed extraordinary. It has the characteristic of undying and its vitality is too strong!</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>Huang Ling’s combat strength might not be much different from Wan Tiancheng and the others, but her vitality was so strong that she was dozens of streets ahead of them.</p><p>The Phoenix Spirit was bathed in divine flames and had already been hit by the puppet many times. However, she still stubbornly charged forward.</p><p>“No, these puppets seem to be arranged according to a formation!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s eyes flickered.</p><p>The cave was huge, and there were at least a few hundred puppets scattered all over the place.</p><p>However, Lu Ming realized that there were at most a dozen puppets attacking them at the same time. The rest of the puppets were motionless.</p><p>For example, when he dashed past certain areas, some of the puppets would stop attacking but new puppets would join in and attack Lu Ming.</p><p>The number was always around a dozen.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. These puppets seemed to be arranged according to a certain pattern.</p><p>With a thought, he stepped forward. The Taiji formation disk floated above his head, and small Taiji diagrams appeared one by one, scattering on the ground.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The ground glowed, and lines appeared, forming a huge array.</p><p>“It’s indeed a formation!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>He realized that each of the puppets was standing at a critical point of the formation.</p><p>Those puppets attacked according to the operation of the array. Therefore, no matter where they went, there would be more than a dozen puppets attacking at the same time. Moreover, because of the enhancement of the array, the power of more than a dozen puppets was very shocking.</p><p>If it were a dozen ordinary third stage half-Saint Warriors, they would definitely not be able to resist a heaven’s pride expert like Wan Tiancheng. They might even be killed by him. But now, a dozen puppets at the third stage of half-Saint realm could suppress Wan Tiancheng, Zhao Kuang, and the others, and even injure them.</p><p>This was because of the formation’s support, which made the power of the puppets extremely shocking.</p><p>On the other side, Huang Ling looked at Lu Ming after seeing the formation on the ground. When she saw two Lu Mings, her eyes flashed with shock.</p><p>At this moment, the second body took a step forward and disappeared into Lu Ming’s glabella again. On the other hand, Lu Ming’s main body took a step forward. When he took this step, the attacks of the dozen puppets strangely hit empty air.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took another step forward. Just like before, the attacks of the puppets hit the air again as if they were not aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>A smile appeared on Lu Ming’s face. He had already identified the weak point of the array. Every step he took landed on the weak point of the array. It could also be said that it was the blind spot of the array, causing the attacks of the puppets to land on empty spots.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Lu Ming was taking a leisurely stroll, taking one step to the East and one step to the West. The puppets ‘attacks were all aimed at Lu Ming’s side, and none of them hit him.</p><p>Lu Ming was heading towards the map and key of the tomb of the Samsara King at high speed.</p><p>On the other side, Huang Ling was a little anxious. Her Phoenix cry rang out, and she charged forward without caring about her injuries.</p><p>The two of them quickly approached the two stone pillars.</p><p>About a minute later, the two of them broke through the puppets ‘encirclement almost at the same time and rushed towards the two stone pillars.</p><p>In the area around the two stone pillars, there were no puppets standing. Moreover, when they broke through the encirclement of the puppets and arrived at this area, the puppets stopped chasing them and returned to their original positions, standing still.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming grabbed a Jade token while the black key was in Huang Ling’s hand. Then, their eyes met and the atmosphere was a little tense.</p><p>brother, the Jade token in your hand should be a map, right? why don’t you give me the map and let the map merge with the key? otherwise, it’ll be useless if we each have one!</p><p>I’ll go with you! Huang Ling said in a tender voice. A powerful aura emanated from her body and locked onto Lu Ming.</p><p>indeed, it’s useless to have only one. You have the key, but you can’t find the tomb of the reincarnation Emperor. I have the map. Even if you find the tomb, you can’t enter it. How about you give me the key and let the map and the key join together!</p><p>Lu Ming laughed and slowly retreated, appearing to be on guard.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you deserve to die!”</p><p>they got the map and key to the tomb of the reincarnation King!</p><p>At this moment, a few angry roars could be heard. It was Wan Tiancheng, Zhao Kuang, and Sima Liang who had rushed in. They naturally saw that the map and key were in the hands of Lu Ming and Huang Ling.</p><p>However, they were besieged by a group of puppets. They did not have the immortal body of the Phoenix Spirit and could not withstand the siege of the puppets. After a while, they had no choice but to leave the cave.</p><p>“Your name is Lu Ming?”</p><p>Huang Ling blinked her eyes.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He focused all his attention on Huang Ling, afraid that she would suddenly attack.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m afraid you can’t keep the map of the tomb of the Samsara King if I attack!”</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>“Oh, really? I don’t think so!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled as his glabella glowed. He stepped forward and stood side by side with Lu Ming. The Tai Chi formation disk floated above his head, and a powerful aura filled the air.</p><p>“A clone? No, it’s the same person. Amazing, truly amazing!”</p><p>Huang Ling’s gaze shifted between Lu Ming’s main body and secondary body, and she revealed a look of surprise.</p><p>Huang Ling, although you have the undying Heavenly Phoenix body, the word ‘undying’ is only relative. You’re not really undying. It’s just that you have a strong life force. Just now, when you charged over, I’m afraid you’ve been injured quite badly. Your combat strength has been greatly reduced. If we really fight, you might not be my opponent!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly, looking very confident.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
