Its huge Dragon Claw smashed down at the Taotie.</p><p>...</p><p>The Taotie roared and transformed into its true form. It also struck out with its claw.</p><p>However, the result was that the Taotie’s body shook violently and was directly sent flying by the true Dragon’s illusory figure. It retreated a dozen steps and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>The Taotie was injured by the true Dragon’s Shadow in one move. It was shocking.</p><p>The Taotie’s combat strength was definitely at the peak among them. If it used its full power, it could definitely fight against a Saint realm expert. However, it was no match for him and was injured in one move.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Phoenix screeched and pounced towards the Taotie, scaring the Taotie into retreating, not daring to fight.</p><p>The true dragon and phoenix shadows flew above their respective tombs, but they didn’t pursue.</p><p>it’s so powerful. How can it pass? ”</p><p>he’s definitely stronger than an ordinary Saint realm expert. He’s no match for him alone!</p><p>Many people’s faces turned ugly.</p><p>He had gone through so much to reach this point, but was he going to stop here?</p><p>everyone, the only way to pass through this path is to join forces. Let’s join forces and charge through together. Otherwise, no one will be able to pass through alone!</p><p>Huang Ling spoke. She joined forces with Lu Ming to defeat a shadow and stepped forward.</p><p>“That’s right, we can only join forces now!”</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince said.</p><p>“Alright, I agree!”</p><p>“I also agree!”</p><p>The others chimed in one after another. Just now, everyone was still on guard against each other, but now, they had no choice but to join forces again. Because if they didn’t join forces, they could only stop here.</p><p>Everyone broke through the illusionary figures and converged towards the path. After a while, everyone was gathered together.</p><p>“Let’s charge!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>There were more than 40 people, and they rushed towards the intersection.</p><p>All of them were heaven’s spiritual bodies, and they came from different monarch-level forces.</p><p>The true dragon roared and the Phoenix let out a long cry as they pounced toward the crowd.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>More than forty heaven’s favorites attacked together. All kinds of light exploded. When they combined together, it was extremely terrifying.</p><p>All kinds of attacks collided with the true dragon and phoenix shadows. They were unstoppable and destroyed the true dragon and phoenix shadows in an instant, drowning them in their own.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The true dragon and phoenix shadows collapsed.</p><p>this is a good opportunity! Charge!</p><p>All of the heaven’s favorites took this opportunity to rush towards the entrance. In the blink of an eye, more than forty of them had made it past the two tombs.</p><p>The true dragon and phoenix shadows immediately gathered together again. However, they did not continue to attack them. Instead, they roared and flew into the tomb, disappearing.</p><p>“Just a wisp of immortal fighting intent has reached the Saint realm. I wonder how terrifying he was when he was alive? Could it be that he had reached the Emperor rank? Is there an Emperor-level true dragon buried in this tomb?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the large tomb, a fiery light flashing in his eyes.</p><p>If he could obtain the bone armor of an Emperor-level true dragon and refine it, what level would his spirit body evolve to?</p><p>Would he evolve into a superior-grade heavenly spiritual body in one go?</p><p>Of course, he was only thinking about it.</p><p>The tomb was filled with terrifying power of laws. Zhao Kuang had just ended up like that. He naturally didn’t dare to attack the tomb.</p><p>Everyone let out a long breath and followed the path forward.</p><p>Not long after, a River blocked his path.</p><p>The strange thing was that the water of this River was yellow, like the legendary River of hell, the yellow spring.</p><p>“This … Is this really the yellow spring River?”</p><p>Suddenly, someone spoke, his voice trembling.</p><p>Because there was a stone tablet there. When everyone looked at it, they saw two words written on the stone tablet: Yellow Springs!</p><p>Everyone looked at each other and saw shock and fear in each other’s eyes.</p><p>According to the ancient legends, there was a nine Serenities hell between heaven and earth. In the hell, there was a River that ran across the hell. It was called the yellow spring.</p><p>The yellow spring was untraversable, because once one entered it, no matter what living being it was, they would be corroded by the water and become a part of the yellow spring.</p><p>However, all of this was just a legend. No one had ever seen an Emperor-ranked expert.</p><p>Could it be that the netherworld and the nine Serenities hell really existed?</p><p>Even the Golden Crow tenth Prince and the Taotie, who were both unruly, had serious expressions on their faces.</p><p>No one dared to rashly attempt to cross the yellow Springs.</p><p>If they crossed the river like the legendary yellow spring, it would be equivalent to suicide.</p><p>“There’s a bridge over there!”</p><p>Someone pointed ahead and shouted. Everyone looked over and saw a bridge ahead.</p><p>Everyone walked along the shore of the yellow spring. When they got closer, they found that the bridge was very wide and led directly to the other side of the yellow spring.</p><p>There were three words carved on the bridge.</p><p>The bridge of helplessness!</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss …</p><p>The sound of gasping could be heard, and everyone felt a chill in their hearts.</p><p>According to the legends, there was a bridge of helplessness above the yellow spring. If one wanted to cross the yellow spring, they had to cross the bridge of helplessness.</p><p>He didn’t expect that there really was a bridge of helplessness.</p><p>The yellow Springs and the bridge of helplessness were just like the legends. Could it be that this place led to the nine Serenities hell?</p><p>Even though they were all geniuses from Emperor-ranked powers and had seen many things, they still felt a chill down their spines.</p><p>legend has it that on the bridge of helplessness, there is a mengpo holding a bowl of soup. Anyone who crosses the bridge has to drink it. After drinking it, they forget everything. Could there be a mengpo on the bridge of helplessness? ”</p><p>Someone said, his voice trembling.</p><p>Hmph, all of this is just an illusion. Someone deliberately set it up. If there really was a netherworld, why would it appear here? ”</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince snorted coldly. His entire body was covered in the Golden divine fire of the great sun. He stepped onto the bridge of helplessness and headed towards the other side.</p><p>that’s right. This should be the burial ground of the reincarnation Emperor. It can’t be the true netherworld. How can it stop me? ”</p><p>Then, someone else spoke and stepped forward.</p><p>“Huang Ling, let’s go too!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Huang Ling nodded. The two of them walked side by side and stepped onto the bridge of helplessness.</p><p>Seeing this, the others also followed.</p><p>Although they didn’t believe it, they were still cautious and on guard.</p><p>“Where did the souls of the ancient heroes go?”</p><p>All of a sudden, a leisurely voice rang out. It came from an unknown place and rang in everyone’s ears.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Someone was shocked and shouted.</p><p>“Where did the souls of the ancient heroes go?”</p><p>The voice continued to ring out, seemingly filled with helplessness and sighs.</p><p>As the group continued to move forward, that voice continued to ring out.</p><p>But all this time, it was only this one sentence that repeated itself.</p><p>Everyone held their breath and paid no attention to this voice. They continued forward, and soon, they would cross the bridge of helplessness.</p><p>But at this moment, everyone stopped.</p><p>There was a figure at the end of the bridge.</p><p>An old woman!</p><p>The old woman was very old. Her back was hunched, and she wore a loose black robe. Her hair was white, and the wrinkles on her face were like mountains.</p><p>She was holding a bowl in her hand. In the bowl, there was a milky white liquid.</p><p>Meng Po!</p><p>A name appeared in everyone’s mind!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
