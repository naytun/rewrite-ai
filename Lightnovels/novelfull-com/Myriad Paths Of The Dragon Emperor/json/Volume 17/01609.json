A blood-red light appeared between the sky and the earth and surrounded his body.</p><p>...</p><p>“Blood God cut!”</p><p>The blood-red light was like a divine knife, slashing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The blood-red light gave Lu Ming a strong sense of danger.</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar came from within Lu Ming’s body. Above his head, the shadow of Nine Dragons could be vaguely seen, dancing in the sky.</p><p>Heaven and earth phenomenon!</p><p>Lu Ming activated the Dragon God combat body to its maximum and caused a phenomenon.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming stomped on the ground heavily. His entire body twisted like a huge Dragon, then he drove the long spear and stabbed forward.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The Black Dragon Spear collided with the blood-red light. A terrifying force seemed to penetrate the Black Dragon Spear and split Lu Ming in half.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled and he retreated continuously.</p><p>the second stage of the half-Saint realm is indeed much stronger than the first stage. The power of the laws is invincible and can break anything!</p><p>Many thoughts flashed through Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>The pale-faced young man’s realm was the same as the noble young man from the WAN family, but his combat strength was far inferior to the noble young man’s. The noble young man from the WAN family had the heavenly spiritual body.</p><p>However, even though he was far inferior to the distinguished young man of the WAN family, his combat strength was still extremely powerful. After all, he could control the power of laws.</p><p>The laws were the foundation of this world.</p><p>“You’re not bad to be able to take two of my moves, but that’s all!”</p><p>The pale-faced young man said coldly. He controlled the power of law and continued to charge at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>The fighting spirit in Lu Ming’s eyes grew stronger and stronger. There was no fear in him at all. Light spots lit up on his body, and holy weapons flew out from within, floating around him.</p><p>There were a total of ten holy weapons, and the Qi of combat weapons converged, making Lu Ming’s aura even more powerful.</p><p>“Ten thousand soldier art, you are a member of the WAN family!” The pale-faced young man’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and declined to comment.</p><p>it seems like another genius has appeared in the WAN family. It’s time to behead him!</p><p>The pale-faced young man strode forward and slashed at Lu Ming with a blood-red light.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Black Dragon Spear trembled like a Dragon’s Roar as it thrust forward. At the same time, Lu Ming’s left hand grabbed a holy weapon sword and slashed down.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>This time, after two loud bangs, Lu Ming still retreated. However, he took a few steps back this time.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>The pale-faced young man shouted as the blood-red light continued to slash at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was not afraid at all. He rushed forward, two rays of black light shooting out from his eyes.</p><p>The pale-faced young man’s body trembled as he used the divine sword technique. A trace of pain flashed in his eyes.</p><p>However, he endured it and continued to attack Lu Ming with the power of law.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s current soul force was no longer weaker than that of a second stage half-Saint. When he used the divine sword technique, his opponent’s soul was also affected and his strength was weakened.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them clashed again, and at the moment of collision, they exchanged several moves.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming still retreated but only by a few steps. He could barely resist the other party’s attack.</p><p>Hiss … Hiss …</p><p>Below the fighting ring, the others gasped. Lu Ming’s combat strength was too terrifying. He was only at the eighth level of the martial Royal realm, but he could fight against a second stage half-Saint.</p><p>“A peerless monster!”</p><p>Someone sighed.</p><p>“Such combat strength, I’m afraid that even the strongest geniuses of ordinary Emperor-ranked powers don’t have such combat strength. Only those terrifying and ancient powers can have such geniuses!”</p><p>that’s right. The WAN family actually produced such a genius!</p><p>Many geniuses sighed and discussed.</p><p>On the fighting ring, the battle continued.</p><p>Lu Ming combined his divine sword technique and finally managed to fight with his opponent. Not long after, the two of them had fought for dozens of rounds.</p><p>“Satisfying, satisfying!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long roar. The nine Dragons also let out long roars in the celestial phenomenon. Apart from the chaos sky-turning seal, Lu Ming did not hold back in his battle. His essential core whistled and his territory was cast to the extreme.</p><p>The battle between the two of them was intense. The terrifying Qi was wantonly bombarding the light curtain at the edge of the fighting stage, causing it to shake violently.</p><p>“You actually used me as a Whetstone!”</p><p>The pale-faced young man’s eyes were cold.</p><p>He understood that Lu Ming was using him as a Whetstone to improve himself.</p><p>However, on the other hand, he was forced to this stage by Lu Ming, a Lv 8 Martial Emperor. The pressure he was under was also very great, and it could also force him to improve.</p><p>The battle continued without stopping.</p><p>Although the pale-faced young man’s combat power was obviously stronger, Lu Li had many tricks up his sleeve. The divine sword technique was enough to threaten the other party. Moreover, the Dragon God combat body was a heavenly spiritual body, so his vitality was extremely vigorous and his endurance was also extremely strong. It was as if he would never be tired.</p><p>It would be difficult for the other party to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>This battle had already gone on for who knew how many moves. After half an hour, the light screen at the edge of the fighting ring disappeared.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two of them exchanged a final blow and retreated at the same time, standing on both sides of the fighting ring.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming spat out a mouthful of blood. After such a long battle, he was still injured by the power of the law.</p><p>However, the other party was also panting like an ox, and had consumed a lot of energy.</p><p>“Let’s fight again next time!”</p><p>The pale-faced young man left with these words and strode away.</p><p>“I’ll wait for your battle!”</p><p>let’s go, ” Lu Ming said. He then jumped off the fighting ring and left. Soon, he returned to the inn and entered the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Under the path-understanding ancient tree, Lu Ming sat cross-legged with the heavenly Dao stone suspended in the air. He was quietly comprehending.</p><p>In this battle, he had been completely suppressed by the other party and was constantly in a life and death situation. His potential had been completely stimulated and he had gained a lot.</p><p>Unfortunately, he didn’t enter the life and death ethereal realm. It seemed that it wasn’t easy to enter the life and death ethereal realm. The last time he was able to enter it, it was completely by chance.</p><p>Two days later, Lu Ming ended his cultivation and opened his eyes.</p><p>as expected, I can only improve quickly in a great battle!</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a faint smile.</p><p>In two days, he had fully recovered from his injuries, and his Chaos Domain had also improved, approaching the middle stage of level eight.</p><p>If one were to cultivate step by step, it would be difficult to achieve this effect without months of hard work.</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming exited the mountain and river diagram and went to the Asura arena once again.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming arrived at the Asura stage, many people looked at him with fear in their eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming had already become a famous person in the Asura arena.</p><p>“You’re finally here. Let’s continue the battle!”</p><p>The pale-faced young man was also there, glaring at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Just what I wanted!” Lu Ming responded.</p><p>As soon as the battle on the fighting ring ended, Lu Ming and the pale-faced young man leaped onto the fighting ring one after another. Without saying a word, they immediately started fighting.</p><p>This time, the battle lasted for half an hour before the two of them retreated, panting heavily. This time, Lu Ming did not vomit blood. His injuries were lighter than before.</p><p>“I’m xu Ran!”</p><p>The pale-faced young man said.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Lu Ming answered.</p><p>“We’ll fight another day!”</p><p>“We’ll fight another day!”</p><p>The two of them left these words and then left the fighting ring.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
