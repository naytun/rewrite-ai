She wanted to control the tianshen sect.</p><p>...</p><p>However, in order to control the Tian Shen sect, he had to get rid of the deity first. The deity was the most popular candidate for the next head of the Tian Shen sect. With the deity, it would be more difficult for Xie nianjun to control the Tian Shen sect.</p><p>She wanted to use Lu Ming to get rid of the divine Son. That was why she came to tell him this secret.</p><p>I’m only a half-saint now, while the divine Son has already reached the great achievement of bright Saint. I’m afraid I’m no match for the divine Son. Even if you tell me this, I’m afraid it’s useless!</p><p>Lu Ming stared at Xie nianjun and said.</p><p>to be able to come out from a remote small family in the divine wilderness continent, unify the divine wilderness, create the Dragon Alliance, and even kill all the experts in the divine Ruins continent, Lu Ming, I believe that a Divine Child will not be difficult for you!</p><p>Xie nianjun said. After he finished speaking, he smiled flirtatiously and turned to leave.</p><p>This woman had great ambitions!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. However, he had to admit that Xie nianjun’s information was very useful to him.</p><p>The divine Son had actually broken through to the upper tier of bright Saint and knew a secret technique that could unleash his combat power for a short period of time.</p><p>When Lu Ming’s cultivation was still weak, he had come into contact with many secret skills that could allow him to unleash his combat strength in a short period of time. However, those secret skills and methods were only useful when his cultivation was low. At his current cultivation level, those secret skills were useless.</p><p>In this case, Lu Ming was mentally prepared. Otherwise, if the other party suddenly exploded, it would be dangerous.</p><p>“Great achievement of bright Saint?”</p><p>There was a glint in Lu Ming’s eyes. He then returned to his room.</p><p>After entering the mountain and river diagram, Lu Ming took out a pile of dragon bones and began to devour and refine them.</p><p>Lu Ming had bought this pile of dragon bones from the Supreme treasure Pavilion. They weighed 1500 kilograms, and the spiritual essence was well-preserved.</p><p>Time passed day by day, and very soon, the time for the treasure sealing assembly was about to arrive.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he had finally refined all the three thousand Jin of dragon bones.</p><p>“It’s still not enough!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed slightly.</p><p>After refining all the 1500-kilogram Supreme Saint Dragon bones, Lu Ming’s spirit body did not evolve. It was still a low-grade Celestial Spirit body.</p><p>The evolution of the heavenly spiritual body required the essence of a true dragon, which was beyond his imagination.</p><p>A huge amount of essence energy was stored in Lu Ming’s body but it had not accumulated to the point of evolution. In the future, he would need to refine more true dragon essence before the energy would burst out and evolve.</p><p>“It’s almost time for the treasure sealing assembly!”</p><p>Lu Ming got up and exited the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>As soon as he got out of the mountain and river diagram, he met Tian Chui, Xue ningxin, su Lei, Qiu Yingying, and Qiu Hao. Of course, there was also Lu Xiangxiang.</p><p>“Ninth Junior Brother, you’ve finally come out of seclusion. The treasure sealing assembly is about to begin, let’s go and meet up with the others!”</p><p>Tian Chui said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. The group of them flew towards an empty space. When they arrived, they realized that there were already many people there.</p><p>In the middle of the open space were the participants of the treasure sealing assembly. Lu Ming, Tian Chui, and Xue ningxin flew down and joined the rest.</p><p>“Junior Brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>Zi Feng nodded at Lu Ming kindly.</p><p>There were others who also greeted Lu Ming. Lu Ming smiled in response.</p><p>Of course, there were also cold gazes on Lu Ming, like silver pine trees.</p><p>They were surrounded by disciples of Dragon God Valley, and even elders.</p><p>“Second senior, and third senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the room and he noticed that his second senior brother, Longyuan mountain, and third senior brother, yang tianzong, were both present.</p><p>The two of them nodded and smiled at Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, a purple-robed elder walked through the air. Beside him were a few other elders, all of whom exuded a vast aura.</p><p>“The master of purple dragon Valley!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. He did not expect the valley master of purple dragon Valley to make a personal appearance.</p><p>Among the Seven Valleys of the Dragon God Valley, the purple dragon Valley was undoubtedly ranked in the top three. The valley master of the purple dragon Valley was also a rare master in the Dragon God Valley.</p><p>I’ll be leading this time’s treasure fixing assembly. You must do your best to fight for the glory of Dragon God Valley. Whoever contributes in the treasure fixing assembly will be heavily rewarded by the sect. Of course, if you’re faced with a life-and-death crisis, I hope you’ll put your lives first. Do you understand? ”</p><p>The master of purple dragon Valley landed in front of them and said loudly.</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>Everyone responded.</p><p>“Alright, let’s set off now!”</p><p>After the purple dragon Valley master finished speaking, he and several other elders took to the air. Lu Ming and the others followed, followed by a large number of Dragon God Valley disciples. They were all there to watch.</p><p>The location of the treasure fixing assembly was at the peak of the Cang Mountain.</p><p>There was a huge fighting ring here, surrounded by rows of seats. It was so huge that it could accommodate hundreds of thousands of people at the same time.</p><p>When Lu Ming and the rest arrived, a few sects had already arrived.</p><p>Dragon God Valley chose a random seat and landed. There were thousands of people, but they only occupied a small area.</p><p>Following that, the other sects descended one after another. Their numbers were huge, and each sect had thousands of people.</p><p>The only exception was the life-and-death Sword sect. All of them added up to less than a hundred people.</p><p>The life-and-death Sword sect had few people to begin with.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The sound of breaking air rang out as the sects arrived one by one.</p><p>The Tian Yu demon sect, the Tian Shen sect, etc.</p><p>The moment the Tian Yu demonic sect arrived, Lu Ming’s gaze turned to them. Then, a look of disappointment flashed across his face.</p><p>She didn’t see Xie nianqing.</p><p>Mo Yang looked at Lu Ming coldly, a sinister smile on his face.</p><p>In the direction of the deity sect, Luo shuihan was also looking at Lu Ming, her eyes cold.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming saw Xie nianjun but was a little surprised. Xie nianjun was sitting in the audience’s seat and not the contestant’s seat.</p><p>Xie nianjun, are you not participating?</p><p>Seven days ago, when Lu Ming met Xie nianjun, he had a vague feeling that Xie nianjun’s cultivation was very profound. He was at least at the half-Saint realm and might even be stronger than Lu Ming. However, Xie nianjun concealed it very well and Lu Ming could not tell his exact cultivation.</p><p>With such a cultivation base, he actually didn’t participate? Lu Ming felt a little strange!</p><p>Every time, only ten sects would participate in the treasure auction. The other three top sects had already been eliminated in the treasure auction, but there were still a large number of people who came to watch.</p><p>Other than the thirteen top sects, there were also people from some smaller sects and factions who came to watch.</p><p>This was the biggest event in the Azure continent that was held once every three years, so it naturally attracted many people.</p><p>“That is … The Son of God, the Son of God is here!”</p><p>Suddenly, someone exclaimed.</p><p>Everyone looked over.</p><p>The Son of God was dressed in white and bathed in holy light. He looked like the Son of God as he stepped through the air.</p><p>His body did not exude a strong aura, but it gave people a strong pressure.</p><p>He stood in the sky above the fighting ring, looking down at everyone arrogantly like a god.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I hope you can pass the treasure sealing assembly!”</p><p>The Divine Child looked at Lu Ming and spoke indifferently.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
