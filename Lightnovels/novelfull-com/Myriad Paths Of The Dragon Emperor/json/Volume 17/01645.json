Finally, they looked at each other and returned to where they came from.</p><p>Although they had all guessed that the inheritance of the reincarnation Emperor was likely to fall into Lu Ming’s hands, the combat strength that Lu Ming had just displayed was too strong. So what if it fell into Lu Ming’s hands?</p><p>...</p><p>What could they do?</p><p>They would have to join forces to fight Lu Ming. However, judging from Lu Ming’s combat strength, they would have to pay a heavy price even if they joined forces. They did not know how many people would die before they could take Lu Ming down.</p><p>Which one of them was willing to take this risk?</p><p>Lu Ming and Huang Ling walked in front. They soon passed through the small path and arrived at the area where the group of tombs was.</p><p>However, when they walked into the tombs this time, there was no movement from the tombs. No illusionary figures came out to attack them. They passed through the tombs easily and arrived at the long passage.</p><p>In front of him, the tenth golden Crow Prince and Taotie saw Lu Ming approaching and immediately broke into a run, running madly through the passageway.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and stepped into the passage with Huang Ling. He strode forward, and the others followed behind him.</p><p>The amazing thing was that when they came in before, it took them half a month to pass through the passage. This time, they only used a day to reach the end.</p><p>They saw the mountain that had been split open by the halberd.</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but think of the reincarnation halberd that the reincarnation Emperor had given him. It seemed to be the halberd that was formed after the fusion of Ten Keys.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Once they were out of the passageway, the tenth golden Crow Prince and the Taotie cast a cold glance at Lu Ming, then soared into the sky and flew into the distance.</p><p>But right at this moment, a terrifying sword light appeared in the sky up ahead and slashed down towards the tenth golden Crow Prince.</p><p>This sword light looked like a rusty iron sword. It cut through the void and was hundreds of thousands of feet tall.</p><p>At the same time, there was also a terrifying spear that was also covered in rust. It was incomparably huge as it charged towards Taotie.</p><p>“Who’s there? You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince let out a long cry and flew up into the sky. The divine fire of the sun burned fiercely, and one of his claws grew rapidly as he tried to grab the iron sword.</p><p>At the same time, the Taotie roared and shot out a destructive light toward the spear.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>With two loud explosions, the figures of the tenth golden Crow Prince and Taotie were blocked. They were suspended in the air. Even with their combat strength, they were unable to rush out.</p><p>Their eyes were like lightning as they looked forward.</p><p>In front of him, two figures stepped through the air.</p><p>The two figures were both wearing rusty iron armors, and their bodies were filled with a strong aura of death. The difference was that one was holding a sword, and the other was holding a spear.</p><p>Undead, and two of them were in the Saint realm!</p><p>“What’s going on? The undead are actually attacking the tenth golden Crow Prince!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming and the rest had rushed out of the passage one after another. Someone asked doubtfully.</p><p>“Kill, kill!”</p><p>The two undead Saints stepped forward and charged toward the Golden Crow tenth Prince and Taotie.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince and the Taotie roared in anger. They could only use their full power to fight.</p><p>Instantly, two balls of bright light burst out in the sky.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Some of the young men said as they flew in another direction.</p><p>Although he didn’t know why the two undead Saints attacked the Golden Crow tenth Prince and Taotie, it was better to leave as soon as possible while they were busy.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, a terrifying roar shook the heavens and earth. A destructive light shot towards the few heaven’s favorites who were flying at high speed.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>“Quickly retreat!”</p><p>A few heaven’s favorites roared and attacked.</p><p>However, as the beam of light passed by, the few heaven’s favorites retreated and blood flowed out of their mouths.</p><p>“Saint, it’s the Saint again!”</p><p>A few of the elites shouted.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>Roars were heard. On their left, a few giant creatures stepped in the air, exuding a terrible aura. It was the Holy aura.</p><p>Those huge creatures were all fierce beasts, and they were all in the Saint realm.</p><p>Then, a loud roar came from the right. A terrifying pressure spread towards Lu Ming and the others. A few figures appeared. Each figure was bathed in a brilliant light. Their faces could not be seen clearly, but their auras were definitely that of Saints.</p><p>At the same time, a powerful aura spread down from above their heads. A few Saints had also appeared.</p><p>there are 12 experts of the Saint realm. What do they want? ”</p><p>A young man’s face turned pale.</p><p>These Saint realm experts were obviously from the various races on the hundred clan battlefield. They usually ruled their own areas, but they had actually gathered here today.</p><p>“Kill them all!”</p><p>A voice full of killing intent came from the sky.</p><p>Kill!</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The beasts of the Saint stage and the other strange races charged toward Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Other than the two undead, there were a total of ten Saints who launched terrifying attacks at Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Instantly, a heaven’s favorite was blown up in the air and died.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A fearsome claw ray was aimed at Lu Ming, but he punched out and destroyed it.</p><p>The scene was in a chaotic battle.</p><p>Following that, a few more screams rang out as a few more geniuses were killed.</p><p>A Saint not only mastered laws, but also condensed Saint power.</p><p>Saint energy was completely different from Zhen Yuan and demonic power. It was a qualitative improvement. Saint energy was extremely powerful and could easily destroy Zhen Yuan and demonic power.</p><p>Although these geniuses were powerful, unless they entered the third level of the half-Saint realm, they would still find it difficult to fight against a Saint.</p><p>“Charge! Let’s charge out together!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>Facing ten Saints, they had to work together to have a chance.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Huang Ling dashed to the left.</p><p>The other paragons gathered together and charged with Lu Ming.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>A few huge Saint realm demonic beasts roared and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>One of them looked like a giant lizard with bone spikes all over its body. It was at least a few hundred meters long. It stretched out its huge claws and clawed at Lu Ming.</p><p>This was a beast at the lower tier of the bright Saint realm.</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch at the beast’s sharp claws.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s punch landed on the beast’s sharp claws. The beast’s huge body was forced to retreat.</p><p>In terms of strength, he was no match for Lu Ming.</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince and the Taotie could fight with ordinary saints. With Lu Ming’s combat power, he could easily suppress an ordinary Saint realm beast.</p><p>As the gigantic beast retreated, Lu Ming and the rest charged forward at top speed.</p><p>“Stop them!”</p><p>The other beasts roared loudly. A few of them in the sky also charged toward Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Let’s attack together!”</p><p>die! Huang Ling shouted. The undying flame burned on her body, and a flaming phoenix rushed out toward a beast.</p><p>??…</p><p>Thunderbolts filled the air. Ye Dongfang was beside the Phoenix Spirit. The sky was filled with Thunderbolts, forming a huge Thunderbolt sword that slashed at a beast.</p><p>One of the yellow-robed young men’s arms suddenly grew bigger. His face was covered with rocks. He punched at the sky and blocked a Saint.</p><p>As for the other heaven’s favorites, they gathered together and attacked with all sorts of methods.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
