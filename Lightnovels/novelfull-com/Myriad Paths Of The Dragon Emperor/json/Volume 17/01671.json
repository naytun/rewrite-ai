His cold eyes swept across Tian Chui and the rest as he said,”What’s the use of a sharp tongue? Lu Ming, this time, there’s no need for senior brother Divine Son to make a move. You’ll lose your life in the treasure fixing assembly, Hmph!”</p><p>With that, Shi Guan snorted coldly and left with a few disciples of the heavenly God sect.</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest did not stay there. They flew directly to the Dragon God Valley’s station at the Cang Mountain.</p><p>It was the first time Xiangxiang Beila had come to the Cang mountains. Her big eyes were spinning around, full of curiosity.</p><p>This was the first time that the little girl had gone out of the Lu clan for so many years. She was either in the Lu clan Fort or Dragon God Valley.</p><p>Xiangxiang, cultivate well. When you reach the high-level martial Royal realm, I’ll let you go out and wander alone!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“En, Xiangxiang will definitely do her best!”</p><p>The little girl’s eyes immediately lit up and she clenched her fists.</p><p>The next few days were peaceful after they arrived at the Dragon God Valley. Three days later, Tian Chui and Xue ningxin came to look for Lu Ming.</p><p>The Supreme treasure Pavilion was about to open its doors to sell treasures again.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with anticipation.</p><p>The Supreme treasure Pavilion was an Emperor-level power, and its business was spread across many large provinces. There were countless treasures in the Supreme treasure Pavilion, many of which could not be found in the Azure province.</p><p>Lu Ming also wanted to buy two things.</p><p>It was also a space-breaking flying shuttle. Lu Ming wanted to buy a higher level space-breaking flying shuttle.</p><p>The second was the Dragon Bone or the blood essence of a real Dragon.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had obtained a Dragon Valley in the ancestral land of Gusu city. However, it was obvious that the Dragon Bone had been dead for many years. The spiritual essence of the dragon Bone had been severely lost. Lu Ming estimated that even if he devoured and refined it, it would be difficult for his spirit body to evolve.</p><p>The Dragon God combat body had reached the heavenly spiritual body level. Every time it evolved, it would consume a terrifying amount of energy and require a terrifying amount of spiritual essence of a true dragon.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming needed more true dragon Bone Gu or blood essence.</p><p>Moreover, the blood essence of the true dragon skeleton at the bright Saint realm was no longer of much use to Lu Ming. He needed something of a higher level, which was almost impossible to find in the Azure region. When Lu Ming was in the Dragon God Valley, he had gone to the treasure Dragon Hall to ask, but the highest level of the true dragon skeleton was only at the peak of the bright Saint realm, and there were not many.</p><p>Lu Ming was also looking forward to the opening of the Supreme treasure Pavilion in the Cang mountains.</p><p>The three of them headed towards the Supreme treasure Pavilion.</p><p>Just like three years ago, the Supreme treasure Pavilion was packed with people. Many of them were wearing black robes and bamboo hats, afraid that others would recognize them.</p><p>Three years ago, Lu Ming and the rest were the same.</p><p>However, this time, the three of them did not hide it. With Lu Ming’s current combat strength, there was no need to hide it.</p><p>The three of them stepped into the Supreme treasure Pavilion and immediately attracted many pairs of eyes.</p><p>Many people turned to look at Lu Ming. Clearly, many of them recognized him.</p><p>Lu Ming did not care at all. With a calm expression, he, Tian Chui, and the other two started to walk around.</p><p>After walking one round, they went to the third floor.</p><p>Some people’s eyes flickered. They followed Lu Ming and the other two to the third floor.</p><p>The treasures on the third floor were of a much higher grade. Lu Ming went to a counter that specialized in selling holy weapons. A young lady smiled at him.</p><p>“What Saint weapon would you like to purchase?”</p><p>The young woman said with a smile.</p><p>“Excuse me, are there any space-breaking flying shuttles for sale here?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Of course we have a space-breaking flying shuttle. How many times faster do you need?”</p><p>The young woman asked.</p><p>The space-breaking flying shuttle that Lu Ming used in the past was of the lowest level. With this kind of space-breaking flying shuttle as a unit, it was called the space-breaking flying shuttle that could double the speed.</p><p>The higher grade of the flying shuttle would be faster. For example, Xue ningxin’s flying shuttle was twice as fast as the normal flying shuttle, so it was called the double space-breaking flying shuttle.</p><p>If its speed was three times, it would be called a triple space-breaking shuttle, and so on.</p><p>Back then, the cloud Dragon Valley master’s space-breaking flying shuttle had been at least ten times larger.</p><p>The main thing about the space-breaking flying shuttle was speed, followed by defensive power.</p><p>Normally, the faster the speed, the higher the value.</p><p>A normal spatial piercing shuttle was worth around five Saint weapons, and a spatial piercing shuttle that was twice as fast was worth double that. The faster it was, the more expensive it was.</p><p>“I need a space-breaking flying shuttle that can travel at five times the normal speed!” Lu Ming muttered to himself.</p><p>“Of course, we have a space-breaking shuttle with five times the speed, please wait a moment, Sir!”</p><p>The young woman took out a storage ring. The ring glowed, and an extremely beautiful space-breaking flying shuttle appeared. It was only the size of a palm, and it was covered with beautiful Starlight.</p><p>As soon as the space-breaking flying shuttle was taken out, it attracted a lot of attention.</p><p>“What a beautiful space-breaking flying shuttle. I’m afraid this space-breaking flying shuttle is extraordinary!”</p><p>the beautiful lady said that it’s a space-breaking flying shuttle that can travel at five times the speed. Can Lu Ming afford it? ”</p><p>Low voices came from all around, and many people’s eyes were burning with passion.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes also flashed.</p><p>With the speed of the space-breaking shuttle at five times, it would only take him three days at most to travel between the Cang mountains and Dragon God Valley, or even less. Lu Ming was very tempted.</p><p>this space-breaking flying shuttle is made of Star Iron. It’s worth twenty-five bright Saint weapons. Do you want it? ”</p><p>The woman’s voice sounded.</p><p>“I’m taking it!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s words shocked many people.</p><p>Lu Ming said he wanted twenty-five bright sacred weapons without even blinking. Many people were dumbfounded, and some people even had a flash of greed in their eyes.</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s mouth curled into a cold smile. If it was three years ago, he would definitely not dare to be so arrogant. But now? If anyone dared to have any ideas about him, he didn’t mind killing a portion of them first.</p><p>“Excuse me, do you sell true dragon bones here? If there is, I’ll buy some and pay for it together!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“I do have true dragon bones. What level of true dragon bones do you need, Sir?”</p><p>The young woman said.</p><p>“For those above the great saint realm, the higher the level, the better!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Those above the great sage realm!”</p><p>The young woman’s eyes flickered. we only have 1500 kilograms of Supreme Saint true dragon bones here, and they’re full of spirit. However, the price is very high. You’ll need 50 bright Saint weapons!</p><p>The young woman was sending this sentence to Lu Ming through voice transmission.</p><p>The young woman was also thinking about Lu Ming. The price must be too shocking and she was afraid that Lu Ming would be coveted by others.</p><p>“Fifty bright Saint weapons?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>In total, he would need seventy-five bright Saint weapons. He could take out that many bright Saint weapons, but he wouldn’t have many left if he took them out. If he needed to cultivate the ten thousand soldier scroll in the future, where would he find so many bright Saint weapons in a short time?</p><p>Lu Ming thought about it and decided to use other treasures to offset it.</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He took out a storage ring and handed it to the young woman.”Miss, take a look and see if the things inside can offset the Dragon Bone and the space-breaking flying shuttle!”</p><p>The young woman nodded and took the storage ring. After scanning it with her spiritual senses, her expression changed and she sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.”Could this be the corpse of an absolute Saint divine beast?”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Back then, Lu Ming had obtained the corpse of a Goshawk in his bedroom in the Emperor Cang’s Secret realm. It was an absolute Saint. Although it had been dead for many years, the price of an absolute Saint divine beast was still very high. Its entire body was filled with treasures.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
