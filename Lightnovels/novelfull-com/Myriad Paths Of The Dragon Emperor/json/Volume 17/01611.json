The battle was like a frenzy, and strange phenomena appeared in the sky above the two of them.</p><p>...</p><p>The root of a spirit body was the bloodline. It was transformed from the bloodline. Therefore, in a sense, the phenomenon of heaven and earth was also a manifestation of the bloodline.</p><p>Just like Lu Ming’s heaven and earth anomaly, which was Nine Dragons dancing in the air, the bloodline that he had condensed into a spirit body was the bloodline of the nine Dragons.</p><p>In the sky, the four heaven’s favorites fought intensely. After more than a hundred moves, there was still no clear winner.</p><p>Later on, Zhao Kuang went crazy and actually pulled Wan Tiancheng and Huang Ling into the battle, turning it into a four-person battle.</p><p>This was the hundred clan battlefield. There was no need for a reason to fight, only to temper one’s body.</p><p>The four of them fought chaotically, and the scene became even more intense. After another hundred moves, it was still difficult to determine the winner. In the end, the four of them split into four sides and stopped the battle at the same time.</p><p>hahaha, it’s great today, it’s great! Let’s fight another day!</p><p>Zhao Kuang laughed in a somewhat sinister manner, then turned around and left.</p><p>Then, Sima Liang also left.</p><p>In the end, Wan Tiancheng and Huang Ling looked at each other with a cold glint in their eyes. They then turned around and flew into the city.</p><p>The peak battle had ended, but the commotion it caused was far from over.</p><p>Many people were guessing why these geniuses had come. Something big must have happened nearby, or some treasure had appeared.</p><p>Usually, only the appearance of a treasure would attract these prodigies to the periphery of the hundred clan battlefield.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he had already returned to his room in the inn.</p><p>The combat strength of Wan Tiancheng and the rest was indeed very terrifying, giving Lu Ming a lot of pressure.</p><p>Just like Xu Ran, Wan Tiancheng, Huang Ling, and the others were all second stage half-Saints, but their combat strength was far stronger than Xu Ran’s. Even if Lu Ming used all his strength now, he would not be a match for them.</p><p>He had to continue to break through, and break through even faster, so that he could compete with these heaven’s favorites.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged under the path-understanding ancient tree. With the help of the heavenly Dao stone, he was focused on comprehending the path.</p><p>During this period of time, he didn’t plan to go to the Asura stage to fight. Now that Wan Tiancheng was here, he would definitely know that he used the ten thousand soldiers scroll.</p><p>In the time that followed, Lu Ming’s main body was focused on Dao enlightenment, while his secondary body would sometimes go out in disguise to gather information.</p><p>Three days later, a piece of news spread throughout the city.</p><p>According to the news, the reason why Huang Ling, Zhao Kuang, and the others had come from the depths of the hundred clan battlefield was that there might be a map and key to the tomb of the reincarnation Emperor nearby.</p><p>The news caused an uproar in the city.</p><p>There had always been a legend in the hundred clan battlefield.</p><p>It was said that the battle between the hundred ancient races was extremely brutal. Too many experts had died. Countless Saints and emperors had died.</p><p>It was said that after the war ended, some Supreme experts entered this place and built a tomb for the nine fallen emperors, burying them in the tomb.</p><p>These nine tombs were known as the nine thearchs ‘tombs by later generations!</p><p>It was said that there was a great Emperor’s inheritance in the nine emperors ‘tomb.</p><p>However, for so many years, countless heaven’s favorites have entered the hundred clan battlefield in hopes of finding the nine thearchs “tomb. However, it was all to no avail. No one knew where the tomb was.</p><p>For countless years, only one of the nine Emperor’s tombs had ever appeared, and it was obtained by a genius. That genius was the thousand kill Martial Emperor.</p><p>It was said that the thousand kill Martial Emperor had relied on the inheritance of one of the nine emperors ‘tombs to cultivate to the level of a Martial Emperor and create the terrifying thousand kill mansion.</p><p>A monarch’s tomb could form a huge power. How tempting was this?</p><p>Now, it was said that the reincarnation emperor’s tomb, one of the nine Emperor’s tombs, was about to appear. The map and key of the tomb would appear nearby, which naturally shocked countless people.</p><p>The facts proved that it was true. After that, Wan Tiancheng, Huang Ling, Zhao Kuang, and the others sent out their subordinates to search the nearby area.</p><p>It was said that the light of reincarnation would appear at the place where the key and the map of the tomb of the reincarnation King appeared.</p><p>It wasn’t just the subordinates of the heaven’s favorites. Countless heaven’s favorites in the city also rushed out to find the key and map to the tomb of the reincarnation King.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another dozen days passed.</p><p>It had been almost two months since Lu Ming entered the hundred clan battlefield. His cultivation was improving every day. Now, his cultivation had reached the peak of the eighth level martial Royal realm.</p><p>At this moment, a piece of news spread through the city. Someone had discovered a place that was suspected to be the light of reincarnation. It was in a place further outside the hundred tribe battlefield.</p><p>Countless people rushed to that place.</p><p>Lu Ming took the mountain and river diagram and followed the crowd to that place.</p><p>After crossing a long distance, they came to a land of mountains. Then, they found a crack and jumped down.</p><p>“This is the place?”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a look of surprise.</p><p>This was the place where Lu Ming had hunted for demonic fiend crystals previously.</p><p>The map and key to the tomb of the reincarnation King were actually in this place?</p><p>Surprised, Lu Ming followed the crowd and jumped into the crack.</p><p>“The demonic creatures here actually have demonic evil crystals!”</p><p>it’s really demonic evil crystals. I didn’t find such a treasure land before!</p><p>Soon after entering, many people discovered the situation here. The demonic creatures here actually contained demonic evil crystals.</p><p>Immediately, many people began to glow with blazing light. They were looking for demonic creatures to kill and take the demonic evil crystals.</p><p>“Eh? There’s really a light there!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked in one direction. There was a strange light emerging in that direction. The light seemed to have six different colors that were constantly changing, like the six paths of reincarnation.</p><p>That was the light of reincarnation.</p><p>“I didn’t see it here before. Did it just appear recently?”</p><p>Lu Ming was very surprised.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The sound of something breaking through the air was heard. Lu Ming saw Wan Tiancheng, Huang Ling, Zhao Kuang, and Sima Liang flying in that direction at the fastest speed.</p><p>Then, the other heaven’s favorites also flew in that direction.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped into the air and followed behind the group. Not long after, they came to a Valley.</p><p>“What a coincidence, it’s actually here?”</p><p>Lu Ming was even more surprised.</p><p>This was because this Valley was the valley that he had lured Wan Tiancheng to previously. In it, Lu Ming found ten dragon bones and his Dragon God combat body evolved into the heavenly spirit body in one go.</p><p>The light of reincarnation was actually emitted from the depths of this Valley. There really wasn’t any when he was here.</p><p>Roar! Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>In the valley, the demonic creatures roared, and their roars shook the sky.</p><p>Obviously, many people had entered and alarmed the demons.</p><p>oh no, there are so many powerful demons. They are all at the half-Saint realm. Ah, there are also sage realm demons!</p><p>“Not good, retreat, quickly retreat!”</p><p>The valley was in a mess. Many people rushed out desperately, but there were still screams. Many people were killed by the demonic creatures.</p><p>no, the demonic creatures in this Valley are too strong. We can’t rush in at all!</p><p>Many people sighed. They were extremely unwilling, but there was nothing they could do.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
