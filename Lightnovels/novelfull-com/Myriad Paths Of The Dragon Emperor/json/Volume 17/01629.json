His entire body was about to turn into a blood-red light and merge into the blood sea to refine Lu Ming.</p><p>“This move again!”</p><p>...</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. Then, he raised his hands and held them in the air.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the sky, a huge chaos sky-turning seal appeared. It pressed down on the blood sea like Mount Tai.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The blood sea trembled violently. A large amount of blood-colored energy was obliterated, and the blood sea was being suppressed and reduced in size.</p><p>When Lu Ming first fought with young master blood prison, he could only open a hole in the blood sea by using the chaos sky-turning seal with all his strength. But now, the chaos sky-turning seal had broken through to the fifth level and its power had increased greatly. Even if Lu Ming did not use his full strength, he could still suppress the blood sea and continuously obliterate it.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The blood sea trembled. Lu Ming turned into a beam of light and rushed out of the blood sea, standing high in the sky.</p><p>“Asura! Lu Ming, you’re an Asura!”</p><p>The blood prison young master roared madly, and his voice spread far and wide.</p><p>“What? Shura? Lu Ming is the Asura?”</p><p>that extremely mysterious and powerful Asura is actually Lu Ming? ”</p><p>it’s possible. Don’t forget that Asura’s cultivation is also at the ninth level of the martial Royal realm, the same as Lu Ming’s!</p><p>Young master of blood prison’s roar shocked many people.</p><p>Lu Ming was the mysterious Asura who had been challenging experts.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The young master of blood prison retrieved the blood sea, which turned back into a huge flag and was held in his hand.</p><p>“Lu Ming, since you’re an Asura, I’ve come to the wrong person!”</p><p>After saying this much, the young master of blood prison wanted to leave.</p><p>He knew that if Lu Ming was an Asura, he would not be able to take him down.</p><p>hehe, since you’ve come today, you’ll stay here forever, just like your subordinates!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He took a step forward, and at the same time, light spots appeared on his body. Twelve holy weapons floated around him.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming held the Black Dragon Spear and thrust it at young master blood prison.</p><p>“You want to kill me? Just you!”</p><p>The young master of blood prison bellowed and waved the blood flag. Blood-red light filled the sky as he fought with Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them exchanged a few moves in a row, their Qi unrestrained.</p><p>“Lu Ming, even if you use your ultimate move, you’ll only be on par with me. You want to kill me? dream on!”</p><p>The young master of blood prison roared.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming suddenly shouted and activated his divine sword technique. Two jet-black sword lights shot out from his eyes and rushed into young master blood prison’s body.</p><p>“Soul attack techniques are useless against me. I have the spiritual God’s defense … Ah!”</p><p>The young master of blood prison stopped mid-sentence and let out a painful roar.</p><p>He felt a tearing pain in his soul.</p><p>“How can your soul be so powerful?”</p><p>The young master of blood prison roared.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and stepped into the void. A chaos sky-turning stamp appeared in his palm and he threw it at young master blood prison.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This chaos Empyrean seal had about 60% of its full power, and its power was equally shocking.</p><p>The young master of blood prison waved the blood flag and attacked the primal Chaos sky-turning seal.</p><p>However, the young master of blood prison was struck by Lu Ming’s divine sword technique. His soul was in great pain and his strength was reduced. After the violent collision, young master of blood prison was forced to retreat.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Another chaos sky-turning seal appeared in Lu Ming’s hand and he pressed it down on young master blood prison.</p><p>After Lu Ming threw out the sky-turning stamp, a terrifying wave spread out from his palm.</p><p>One could see that a chaos Empyrean seal had appeared on each of Lu Ming’s palms. Two chaos Empyrean seals had appeared all at once.</p><p>One after another, they charged towards young master blood prison.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming used the divine sword technique to attack young master blood prison.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Young master of blood prison used all his strength to resist, but after continuously blocking five or six chaos sky-turning seals, the blood light on his body kept trembling. His face was as pale as paper, and blood kept flowing out of his mouth.</p><p>Under the continuous attacks of the primal Chaos sky-turning seal and the godly sword technique, the young master of blood prison was severely injured.</p><p>When his soul power and the chaos sky-turning seal had not broken through, Lu Ming’s main body could only fight young master blood prison to a draw even if he used all his strength. But now, he could completely suppress young master blood prison.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The young master of blood prison was scared. After blasting apart a Primal Chaos sky-turning stamp, he wanted to escape.</p><p>However, an even larger sky-turning stamp was formed and pressed down on him.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming’s glabella glowed. Ming Lian stepped out, and a Tai Chi formation disk appeared. A Tai Chi pattern appeared and pressed down on young master blood prison.</p><p>“You … How is that possible?”</p><p>Young master of blood prison’s pupils contracted sharply as he tried his best to resist.</p><p>However, he was unable to resist the main body and the secondary body.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Under the joint attack of the Tai Chi pattern and the chaos sky-turning seal, his body exploded and turned into a mass of blood light. Then, the blood light wriggled and condensed into young master blood prison’s body again.</p><p>However, his aura was much weaker than before. He was extremely weak.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Tai Chi pattern above the second body’s head glowed and turned into two Yin Yang fish swords, which slashed toward young master blood prison.</p><p>Young master of blood prison was terrified, and he frantically waved the blood flag to block the attack.</p><p>The Yin Yang fish sword turned into two streaks of black and white sword radiance. They cut through the void and struck the blood flag.</p><p>The blood light of the blood flag was directly broken. The Yin Yang fish sword cut two holes in the blood flag, and the power of the blood flag was almost destroyed.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted. This time, he used all his strength to cast the chaos sky-turning seal. A huge chaos sky-turning seal formed and was going to kill young master blood prison.</p><p>“No, no…”</p><p>Young master of blood prison shouted in fear.</p><p>He was already severely injured, his aura weak and dispirited. Now that the blood flag was crippled and Lu Ming had unleashed the chaos sky-turning stamp with all his might, he had a feeling that he was going to be killed by this move.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you can’t kill me. We’re in Darkwater city. You can’t do it. Senior, senior, save me!”</p><p>The young master of blood prison roared like a madman. He wanted to get the native Saint realm experts in the dark water city to interfere.</p><p>Before he made his move, he was afraid that the local saint stage powerhouses would interfere. Now, he desperately hoped that the local saint stage powerhouses would intervene.</p><p>Unfortunately, he was disappointed. There was no movement at all.</p><p>The native Saint stage powerhouses did not seem to have any intention of making a move.</p><p>This surprised many people in the surroundings.</p><p>In the past, if such a huge commotion was caused, the local Saints would have already intervened. However, there was no movement at all today.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He raised his hands, and the primal Chaos sky-turning seal emitted a terrifying aura that pressed down on young master blood prison.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, a terrifying sword light pierced through the void behind Lu Ming. It crossed a long distance in an instant and stabbed toward Lu Ming’s back.</p><p>This sword light was too terrifying. It was fast, accurate, and ruthless. Most importantly, the timing was perfect. It attacked when Lu Ming was attacking young master of blood prison with all his might. Furthermore, there was no warning at all.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
