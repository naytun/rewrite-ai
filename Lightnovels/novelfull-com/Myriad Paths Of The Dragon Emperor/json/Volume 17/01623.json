He held the Black Dragon Spear in his hand and cast thirteen accumulated power strikes.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>...</p><p>A huge spear radiance stabbed forward as if it was going to pierce through the heaven and earth. However, the spear radiance pierced into the blood sea and a huge passage was created. However, the blood sea churned and condensed again.</p><p>He didn’t exert any strength at all. He felt like he had strength but no place to use it.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming switched to his holy weapon sword and slashed out a vast sword aura. However, it was still useless and could not break the sea of blood.</p><p>a heaven’s spiritual body is indeed powerful!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>This blood-robed young man’s combat strength was not weaker than Wan Tiancheng’s.</p><p>If Lu Ming summoned bubbles and refined his second body, he would be able to suppress the other party. However, it would be meaningless.</p><p>Lu Ming was here to train himself.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At once, Lu Ming began to launch a frenzied attack. He used a long spear, a combat sword, a combat saber, and the prison suppressing heaven technique. He took turns to attack the vast sea of blood, causing it to tumble and shake violently.</p><p>However, the blood sea was still not broken. However, such an attack was not completely useless. At least it could stop the invasion of the blood sea and resist the power of refinement.</p><p>Outside the blood sea, young master blood prison’s body was covered in blood light. He stood on the blood sea with a cold look in his eyes.</p><p>“Hmph, struggle all you want. Even if you struggle a little longer, you’ll still die in the end!”</p><p>The young master of blood prison said coldly. His body became more and more blurry, as if he was about to turn into blood light and merge into the blood sea.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>In the sea of blood, the sanguine light began to change. It condensed into swords, Spears, and other things, and launched an attack on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>Lu Ming was fearless. He held a spear in one hand and a sword in the other, clashing with the blood light.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a few minutes had passed, and the battle was still ongoing.</p><p>awesome, awesome! Haha, your blood sea can’t refine me at all!</p><p>Lu Ming laughed out loud, his voice passing through the blood sea.</p><p>This made young master blood prison’s face turn even uglier.</p><p>“Let’s see how long you can last!”</p><p>Young master of blood prison shouted coldly. His body turned into a mass of blood light and merged into the blood sea, making the power of the blood sea even stronger.</p><p>In the blood sea, in front of Lu Ming, the blood sea churned and suddenly condensed into a big face. It was the face of young master blood prison.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The big face shouted and an endless bloody light shot toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The Black Dragon Spear shook and turned into a spear radiance, stabbing at the blood light. At the same time, he slashed out with the sword in his left hand, sending out a huge sword Qi.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>This time, the power of the blood-red light was even stronger. Lu Ming’s body trembled and he could not help but retreat.</p><p>With just his main body, he wasn’t a match for a heaven’s favorite like the blood prison young master.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly shouted and the divine sword technique burst out. It turned into two black sword lights and stabbed into the sea of blood.</p><p>“Ah, it’s a soul attack!”</p><p>Young master blood prison’s painful groans came from the blood sea.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Two sword lights shot out from Lu Ming’s eyes and pierced into the blood sea. Young master blood prison screamed in the blood sea again.</p><p>The blood sea churned rapidly. In the blood sea, young master blood prison’s figure reappeared, and his face was a little pale.</p><p>It was not that he did not have a spiritual God defensive treasure. However, his body had turned into a blood-red light and fused into the sea of blood. This meant that his soul had also been separated. Naturally, the spiritual God defensive treasure had lost its effect. His soul had been injured by Lu Ming in one move.</p><p>He had no choice but to reform his body so that the spiritual God defensive treasure would be effective.</p><p>However, when he re-formed his body, the power of the blood sea was naturally much weaker.</p><p>“Chaos!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted softly, his hands moving rapidly.</p><p>In the sky outside the blood sea, a huge chaos sky-turning seal was formed. It was no smaller than the blood sea.</p><p>This was the chaos sky-turning seal that Lu Ming had unleashed with all his might.</p><p>“What a terrifying attack!”</p><p>Outside, many paragons turned pale when they saw the huge chaos sky-turning seal in the sky.</p><p>They felt that if such an attack were to land on them, their souls would definitely be scattered.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The chaos sky-turning stamp pressed down on the blood sea.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The blood sea trembled and churned wildly, resisting the chaos sky-turning seal in a terrifying manner.</p><p>In the sky, there were continuous explosions.</p><p>“There’s an exit!”</p><p>In the blood sea, Lu Ming looked up and his eyes lit up.</p><p>The chaos sky-turning seal collided with the blood sea and finally blasted a gap.</p><p>Lu Ming used thundering wind steps. He took a step forward and his body turned into wind and thunder. He instantly rushed out of the gap and out of the blood sea.</p><p>“That guy has rushed out!”</p><p>Some people cried out in shock.</p><p>It must be known that it wasn’t easy to rush out of the blood prison young master’s blood sea, and very few people could do it.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this time, the chaos sky-turning seal finally exhausted its energy and exploded due to the constant collisions with the blood sea.</p><p>However, the blood sea had also become much more dispirited.</p><p>It was not that the chaos sky-turning seal was not powerful. The main problem was that Lu Ming’s cultivation was too much weaker than his opponent’s. His opponent’s sea of blood contained the power of laws.</p><p>In addition, the chaos sky-turning seal was still at the fourth level, so its power was naturally limited.</p><p>“Even if you rush out of the blood sea, you will still die!”</p><p>The young master of blood prison shouted coldly. The blood sea condensed into a blood flag again and he held it in his hand. The blood light on his body continuously poured into the blood flag. The blood flag grew to a hundred thousand feet and swept towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear swept out and also expanded to a hundred thousand feet. The two of them collided with each other, and the sky and earth rumbled. Lu Ming stepped into the void and retreated.</p><p>In a head-on confrontation, he was ultimately no match.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>The ten-thousand-foot blood flag swept toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming put down the Black Dragon Spear. He held a chaos sky-turning seal in his hand and threw it at Lu Ming.</p><p>This Primal Chaos Empyrean seal had about 60% of its power.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The chaos sky-turning seal was destroyed by the blood flag.</p><p>But then, a few more chaotic sky-turning seals condensed in Lu Ming’s hands and were thrown out in succession.</p><p>The two of them engaged in an intense battle, exchanging more than ten moves in a row.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was at a disadvantage, it was impossible for the young master of blood prison to kill him in a short time.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There was another deafening boom and Lu Ming retreated quickly.</p><p>hahaha, I’m so happy today. Let’s fight another day!</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily. His figure flashed and he headed back to Darkwater city.</p><p>“If you want to leave, then stay!”</p><p>The young master of blood prison let out a long roar, and his killing intent was as sharp as a blade.</p><p>Today, he was actually provoked by a ninth level martial Royal realm martial artist. In the final battle, he actually couldn’t take down the other party. Where would he put his face?</p><p>He would not be satisfied if he did not kill Lu Ming.</p><p>He waved the blood flag and chased after Lu Ming at top speed.</p><p>However, Lu Ming used the thundering wind steps and his speed suddenly increased. In a flash, he had rushed into the Darkwater city.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The young master of blood prison bellowed, but he had no choice but to stop.</p><p>Lu Ming rushed into the Darkwater city and found a hidden place to remove his mask. He changed into his clothes and heaved a long sigh.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
