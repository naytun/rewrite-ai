Such combat strength was already extremely terrifying.</p><p>As for Zhao Kuang and Sima Liang, they were even more dumbfounded.</p><p>...</p><p>Xia ding’s group of four had come with a menacing aura, but in the end, they were defeated by Lu Ming and his Junior Brother and retreated in a sorry state. This was something that they had never dreamed of.</p><p>They both had low-tier heaven spiritual bodies, so how could there be such a huge difference in combat strength?</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the sky, a huge claw grabbed towards Feng Ling.</p><p>The claw was covered in scales. It was extremely ferocious and emitted terrifying fluctuations.</p><p>Ming Lian’s second body was the closest to Huang Ling. He immediately controlled the Tai Chi disk array and the two Yin Yang fish swords slashed at the huge claw.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Yin Yang fish sword hit the claw, and sparks flew. Then, it was sent flying.</p><p>Within the pagoda, bubbles made a move. The void rippled, forming a terrifying spatial blade that slashed towards the claw. As for Huang Ling, she made her move as well. Flames filled the sky as a flaming phoenix flew out towards the claw.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The space blade shattered, and the flaming phoenix was destroyed. Huang Ling’s figure was pushed back, and blood flowed out of her mouth.</p><p>“Primal Chaos sky-turning seal!”</p><p>At this time, Lu Ming’s main body also made a move. He condensed a huge chaos sky-turning stamp and blasted it at the huge claw.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The chaos sky-turning seal struck the claw and was immediately shattered. However, the claw was finally blocked. It rapidly shrank and was retracted from the sky.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were extremely solemn.</p><p>“Someone else has made a move!”</p><p>“Who is it? Lu Ming and Huang Ling just had a huge battle and he’s making a move now?”</p><p>The hearts of many people in the surroundings trembled as they looked up into the sky.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>With a loud roar, the wind and clouds changed, and a huge creature slowly appeared in the sky.</p><p>Many people’s pupils contracted.</p><p>“Taotie!”</p><p>Lu Ming slowly spat out two words.</p><p>The huge creature that appeared in the sky was a Taotie.</p><p>The Taotie was also a type of divine beast that was incomparably powerful. It was said that in ancient times, the Taotie could Swallow the sun and moon in the sky when it opened its mouth. It was truly terrifying.</p><p>The Taotie’s eyes were like two small Suns as it stared at Lu Ming and Huang Ling. Its cold and harsh voice rang out, ” “Hand over the map and key of the tomb of the reincarnation King, and I will spare your lives!”</p><p>Obviously, Tao tie’s goal was the same as Xia ding and the others. He wanted the map and key of the tomb of the reincarnation King.</p><p>“Does the Taotie tribe only know how to take advantage of the situation?”</p><p>Huang Ling said coldly.</p><p>“Nonsense, if you don’t hand it over, you’ll die!”</p><p>The Taotie spoke coldly as it stepped into the air, causing the sky to rumble.</p><p>On Huang Ling’s body, the immortal Fire burned fiercely. She stared at Tao tie with a determined expression. Her meaning was self-evident.</p><p>Lu Ming’s main body and secondary body stood together and stared at the Taotie.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The Taotie roared and leaped towards Lu Ming and Huang Ling. It clawed at them and a terrifying howl rang out between heaven and earth as it clawed at them.</p><p>Above Ming Lian’s head, the Tai Chi formation disk glowed with a brilliant light. A Tai Chi diagram pressed down on Tao tie.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Taotie’s claw landed on the Tai Chi pattern, and the Tai Chi pattern was sent flying.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming cast the ten thousand soldiers art and thrust the Black Dragon Spear at the Taotie’s vital point.</p><p>However, the Taotie’s other claw struck out and slapped on the long spear. Lu Ming felt an extremely powerful force surging towards him and his body was directly blown away. His qi and blood churned and he almost spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“What terrifying strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>He stabbed the Taotie’s claw with his spear, but only left a shallow mark. It didn’t even pierce through the scales.</p><p>This Taotie was definitely at the same level as the tenth golden Crow Prince. Its body was equivalent to a low-tier celestial spiritual body, and its cultivation had reached the third stage of the half-Saint realm, which was the realm where the laws could be infused into its body.</p><p>The body of a divine beast with a heaven spiritual body was already extremely terrifying. In addition, the laws had infused into it, making the body even stronger. Even Lu Ming’s ten thousand soldiers scroll could not break it.</p><p>The cry of a Phoenix was heard. The Phoenix Spirit made a move but it was useless. She was sent flying by the Taotie’s palm.</p><p>“The nine seals of the gate of God!”</p><p>Lu Ming growled and quickly formed a seal with both hands. Nine gates of sealing were formed and pressed down on the Taotie, trying to seal it.</p><p>At the same time, bubbles made a move and cast the spacetime domain to seal the Taotie.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Tai Chi disk array above his head shook again, and the Tai Chi yin-yang fish pattern appeared again. But this time, it turned into the Yin Yang fish sword. Two terrifying sword lights, one black and one white, slashed toward the Taotie.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Taotie let out a heaven-shaking roar. Its body glowed, and its two claws struck out continuously, hitting the door of seal.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The nine gates of sealing shook violently before shattering one by one.</p><p>Then, two terrifying light beams shot out from the Taotie’s eyes and broke free from the bubble’s spacetime domain.</p><p>However, the Tai Chi Yin Yang fish sword had already arrived.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Yin Yang fish sword slashed at the Taotie’s body, causing sparks to fly everywhere and making an ear-piercing sound. However, in the end, it cut through the Taotie’s scales and left two deep sword marks on it, causing blood to flow out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Above the Taotie’s head, a huge chaos sky-turning stamp appeared and pressed down on the Taotie.</p><p>“Ah, die, die, all of you go to hell!”</p><p>The Taotie was injured by the Yin Yang fish sword and was completely enraged. Laws surrounded its body and it rushed out, bombarding the chaos sky-turning seal.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The chaos heaven-turning stamp gave off a terrible vibration, then cracked and finally shattered.</p><p>With a screech, Huang Ling attacked. A combat sword condensed from the undying flame slashed at Taotie’s wound. It immediately burned and emitted the fragrance of roasted meat.</p><p>The unperishable flame could keep one alive when used on oneself, but it could kill others when used on them!</p><p>“Damn it, kill!”</p><p>The Taotie roared in anger and opened its mouth. Instantly, a terrifying devouring force burst out and enveloped Lu Ming’s body and the Phoenix Spirit, wanting to swallow them and refine them.</p><p>“Devouring power, I also know it!”</p><p>Lu Ming growled and clenched his fist. The devouring power burst out and immediately offset the other party’s devouring power.</p><p>“The devouring power of the nine Dragons!”</p><p>The Taotie roared.</p><p>However, although Lu Ming had canceled out the devouring power and stopped the main body and the secondary body, the Phoenix Spirit could not cancel out the devouring power and flew directly into the Taotie’s mouth.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, it was approaching Taotie.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The Taotie growled and spat out a beam of light, which enveloped Huang Ling.</p><p>The Phoenix Spirit let out a long cry and continued to attack. She wanted to rush out of the light beam, but she could not do so. The light beam contained a terrifying destructive and refining power, which was constantly refining the Phoenix Spirit.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s main body and the second body moved at the same time. They charged towards the Taotie in an attempt to save Huang Ling.</p><p>However, two terrifying beams of light shot out from the Taotie’s eyes, forcing Lu Ming’s main body and his secondary body to retreat at the same time.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
