This kind of combat power was too terrifying.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>After a while, the others finally reacted. They roared and retreated, trying to leave this place.</p><p>“I said just now, if you don’t leave, you’ll die. It’s too late to leave now!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. Light spots appeared around his body. Thirty-six holy weapons floated in the air. The Qi of combat weapons gathered and reached a terrifying level.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The Black Dragon Spear had long returned to Lu Ming’s hands. He then flung it out and nailed a clan leader to the ground.</p><p>Lu Ming gripped his sword and stepped into the void, charging toward a Saint realm patriarch.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted as he unleashed his divine sword technique. The Saint realm patriarch trembled. At this moment, Lu Ming’s combat sword had already arrived.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The Saint realm patriarch was easily killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Another Sage had fallen!</p><p>At the scene, only the Cheng family’s old ancestor and the Cheng family’s head were left. However, the two of them were being held back by the SU family’s old ancestor and head.</p><p>“Spare me!”</p><p>The Saint realm patriarch of the Cheng family was horrified when he saw Lu Ming approaching. He begged for mercy.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were extremely cold. He used the divine sword technique once again.</p><p>The Cheng family’s patriarch shuddered. Then, Lu Ming’s combat sword slashed across.</p><p>The Cheng family’s patriarch was killed by Lu Ming’s sword while he was extremely frightened and unwilling. Then, with a flash of sword radiance, the Cheng family’s patriarch was also killed.</p><p>Previously, it was the Cheng family’s patriarch who was the most arrogant. Was it possible for him to beg for mercy?</p><p>At this point, the patriarchs and clan leaders of the other three great clans had all fallen here.</p><p>The SU family’s old ancestor and family patriarch looked at Lu Ming in shock. They were still in a daze.</p><p>Dead. All the Saint realm patriarchs and clan leaders of the other three families were dead.</p><p>From the moment Lu Ming made his move to the moment he killed the experts from the three major families, it took less than a minute.</p><p>Such astonishing battle prowess had simply exceeded their imaginations.</p><p>freak! He’s a true freak! No wonder he dared to challenge the divine Son. Right now, everyone in the Azure continent thinks that Lu Ming will definitely lose and be killed by the divine Son. But now, it seems that’s not necessarily the case. That’s not the case at all. The entire Azure continent has underestimated Lu Ming!</p><p>Many thoughts flashed through the minds of old ancestor su and the SU family leader.</p><p>Then, the two of them were overjoyed.</p><p>The most powerful people from the other three great clans were all dead. From now on, no one in Gusu city would be a match for the SU clan. The SU clan was going to dominate Gusu city.</p><p>All of this was because of Lu Ming.</p><p>Thinking up to this point, the SU family’s head felt waves of fear in his heart.</p><p>Fortunately, he had changed his mind and decided to rope Lu Ming in. Otherwise, the SU family would have been destroyed.</p><p>With a single thought, he had completely changed the SU family’s fate. The SU family head’s heart was extremely complicated.</p><p>However, he secretly swore that he would rope in Lu Ming and treat su Lei well in the future.</p><p>Lu Ming was very calm. With a leap, he put away the storage rings of the powerhouses from the major families, as well as the Saint hearts of the three saints.</p><p>Then, he continued to wait.</p><p>Not long after, su Lei’s body emitted a powerful aura. Then, the aura quickly converged, and su Lei opened her eyes.</p><p>“O-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o Old ancestor, patriarch!”</p><p>When su Lei saw the SU family’s old ancestor and family head, she quickly stood up and bowed.</p><p>“Don’t be so polite, don’t be so polite!”</p><p>Old ancestor su quickly helped su Lei up.</p><p>Su Lei and Lu Ming were very close. He even guessed that the two of them might have a special relationship. He did not dare to let su Lei bow to him.</p><p>Su Lei stood up and was even more surprised when she saw the corpses of the experts from the other three families.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The four of them headed toward the exit, and in the next moment, they appeared outside the ancestral land.</p><p>Outside the ancestral land, many people were waiting. At this moment, when they saw Lu Ming and the rest coming out, they all looked at them.</p><p>“Let’s go back to the SU family!”</p><p>Old ancestor su gave the order.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest returned to the SU family with the disciples.</p><p>The disciples of the other three families waited outside the ancestral land for a long time, but they didn’t see their patriarchs and family patriarchs. They became anxious.</p><p>After that, they sent people into the ancestral land, only to find that the ancestors and clan leaders of the three families were all dead.</p><p>As soon as this news was released, Gusu city was in an uproar. Everyone was extremely shocked.</p><p>The ancestors and clan leaders of the three families were all dead in the ancestral land, while the SU family was safe and sound.</p><p>Everyone knew that Gusu city was about to change.</p><p>The members of the other three families were all terrified.</p><p>As for the SU family’s old ancestor and the SU family’s head, they had started to make arrangements the moment they returned to the SU family. Now, Gusu city was about to be unified.</p><p>However, this had nothing to do with Lu Ming.</p><p>The next day, Lu Ming bid farewell to the SU family’s patriarch and patriarch. He was going back to Dragon God Valley.</p><p>“Senior brother Lu Ming, I’ll go back with you!”</p><p>Su Lei said.</p><p>Now, her mother and her clansmen’s status in the SU family had risen, so she could naturally rest assured.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and brought su Lei out of Gusu city. The SU family’s patriarch and the rest sent them all the way to the outside of Gusu city.</p><p>“Everyone, please go back!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out the space-breaking flying shuttle and entered it with su Lei. The space-breaking flying shuttle shot away like lightning and disappeared in the sky.</p><p>Su Qi, it’s best not to reveal the fact that Lu Ming killed a Saint before the final battle between Lu Ming and the divine Son!</p><p>&Nbsp; old ancestor su sent a message to the SU family head.</p><p>“I know, forefather!”</p><p>&Nbsp; the SU family head nodded.</p><p>Only the two of them knew about this matter. They understood that the fewer people who knew about this, the better. If the people from the deity sect knew about this, they would most likely harm Lu Ming in advance.</p><p>Now, they naturally hoped that Lu Ming would win. Lu Ming was so close to su Lei. The stronger Lu Ming was, the more benefits the SU family would get in the future.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another seven days had passed. Lu Ming finally returned to Dragon God Valley.</p><p>senior brother Lu Ming, when are you going to the treasure sealing assembly? I’ll go with you!</p><p>Su Lei spoke timidly. Her voice was very soft and she sounded a little nervous as if she was afraid that Lu Ming would reject her.</p><p>“Alright, when I’m going to the Cang mountains, I’ll send you a message!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>MMH!</p><p>Su Lei nodded repeatedly, her face blushing.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming and su Lei parted ways. Lu Ming returned to Cloud Dragon Valley.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>As soon as he entered the cloud Dragon Valley, he heard a crisp cry. A petite figure was charging towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“Fragrance!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile.</p><p>This petite figure was naturally his disciple, Lu Xiangxiang.</p><p>Junior Brother, you’re finally back. During this period of time, Xiangxiang has missed you very much. She has been asking when master will be back every day!</p><p>A heroic voice rang out as Longyuan mountain stepped over.</p><p>“Second senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists.</p><p>He had already sent a message to Longyuan mountain previously. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have met Longyuan mountain and Xiangxiang so coincidentally the moment he returned.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
