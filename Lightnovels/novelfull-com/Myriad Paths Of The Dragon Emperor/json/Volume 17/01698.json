Lu Ming stepped forward and a huge cauldron appeared in his body. He grabbed one of the cauldron’s legs and swung it like a hammer, smashing it at the divine Son.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current strength was immense. His body contained the Laws of Chaos. Every move he made was as heavy as a mountain. When the cauldron came crashing down, the terrifying pressure from the strong wind made it difficult for the divine Son to breathe.</p><p>...</p><p>The Son of God could only wave his sword to block.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The cauldron smashed into the Son of God’s sword. The sword hummed and he retreated again.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming lifted the cauldron and smashed it down like a storm, not giving the divine Son any chance to catch his breath.</p><p>With one step behind, the Son of God was forced into a disadvantageous position and could only wave his sword to block.</p><p>Violent rumbles rang out continuously as the Son of God was forced back. His body trembled and blood flowed out of his mouth.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>After several consecutive blows, the cauldron in Lu Ming’s hand cracked and was covered in sword wounds.</p><p>The divine son’s sword was a great saint weapon, after all, while the cauldron in Lu Ming’s hand was a bright Saint weapon. It was normal for the bright Saint weapon to be overwhelmed by the continuous attacks.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not care at all. It was just a bright sacred weapon. He had many of them. Even the bright sacred weapons sealed in his acupoints could be replaced.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The final strike shattered a large chunk of the cauldron, but the remnant was also sent flying backward.</p><p>“Primal Chaos sky-turning seal!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands, and a huge chaos sky-turning stamp formed, pressing down on the divine Son. This was Lu Ming’s full-power attack.</p><p>The Son of God used all his strength to slash out with his sword. However, the sword light was crushed by the chaos sky-turning seal, and the chaos sky-turning seal smashed onto the Son of God’s body. The Son of God’s body was like a meteorite, crashing down heavily.</p><p>Below them was the fighting ring.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Son of God crashed onto the fighting stage. He half-knelt on the stage and spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>At that moment, the godchild’s aura was rapidly weakening. In an instant, the godchild’s aura had weakened many times and was only barely at the Saint realm.</p><p>The time limit of his secret skill was up.</p><p>Obviously, his secret skill had a side effect. Once the time passed, his strength would be greatly weakened.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming descended and landed on the fighting ring, looking at the divine Son coldly.</p><p>The Son of God’s face was pale, and his clothes were stained with blood.</p><p>His eyes were filled with unwillingness and disbelief. He had lost. He had actually lost to Lu Ming.</p><p>Son of God, three years ago, you were so high and mighty. You treated me like an ant and had the power to kill me. Did you ever think that today would be the day you die? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>hahaha, I hate myself for not killing you three years ago!</p><p>The Son of God laughed like a madman.</p><p>three years ago, you wanted to kill me, but my senior brother was there, so you couldn’t. People like you can only show off when you have a higher state. Without the advantage of state, you’re nothing. Now I’ll send you on your way to accompany Luo shuihan!</p><p>With that, Lu Ming stepped forward. The cauldron disappeared and was replaced by a sword.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>From the stands of the heavenly God sect, several angry roars sounded.</p><p>Powerful auras burst out and pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“What are you guys doing? If the younger one can’t do it, then the older one has to make a move!”</p><p>The purple dragon Valley master’s body also burst out with a powerful aura as he stared at the direction of the divine sky sect.</p><p>Beside the purple dragon Valley master, the other Saint realm experts of Dragon God Valley did the same.</p><p>“Divine Child, you can’t die!”</p><p>The great sage of the heavenly God sect said coldly as he looked at Lu Ming with an icy gaze.</p><p>“Can’t die? What a joke. Three years ago, I had a life-and-death battle with the Divine Child. If I didn’t die, then he would!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He took a step forward and charged at the divine Son.</p><p>The Son of God’s expression changed drastically. He quickly retreated in the direction of the grandstand of the Tian Shen sect.</p><p>“If you still dare to attack, then I’ll kill you!”</p><p>The great sage of the tianshen sect said coldly. A spear of divine punishment appeared in his hand and he charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>How terrifying was a Supreme Saint? his strength was much stronger than a bright saint’s. A casual move had earth-shattering power.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately felt his hair stand on end and his muscles tensed up.</p><p>At this moment, a Dragon’s Roar was heard and a purple light burst out, clashing with the spear of divine punishment of the great sage of the heavenly God sect.</p><p>Then, with a flash, the purple dragon Valley master appeared in front of the Supreme Saint of the divine God sect and said, ” you’re really shameless. You’ve lost in a battle of life and death, and a great saint actually attacked. I’ll be your opponent!</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The great sage of the heaven God sect shouted as he thrust his long spear forward. It was as if he could pierce through the void.</p><p>The purple dragon Valley master’s body burst out with purple light. He threw a punch and collided with the spear of God punishment. The sky was filled with purple and white.</p><p>“Son of God, you can’t escape!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to charge at the divine Son.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>A few sacred Ming elders of the tianshen sect rushed towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted and used the divine sword technique. The elders trembled and Lu Ming’s combat sword slashed down.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>An expert in the upper tier of the bright Saint realm was split in half by Lu Ming’s sword. Even his Saint heart was shattered.</p><p>A perfected bright Saint was killed by Lu Ming in one stroke. Everyone around was dumbfounded and speechless. This kind of combat strength was too terrifying.</p><p>A non-Saint killing a Saint. Furthermore, the one he killed was a Saint who had attained the upper tier of bright Saint.</p><p>The other Saints of the tianshen sect shivered, but they were greeted by Lu Ming’s sword again.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A Saint in the early stages of the bright Saint realm tried to block the attack with his Saint weapon, but it ended up hitting him directly. He crashed into the battle stage with his Saint weapon, causing the stage to crack. The Saint was already dead.</p><p>At this time, the Dragon God Valley’s Saints had also arrived and blocked the tianshen sect’s Saints.</p><p>Lu Ming, on the other hand, strode towards the Son of God. He closed in on the Son of God in an instant, and the Son of God’s face turned even paler, without a trace of blood.</p><p>Lu Ming, you dare to kill the divine Son? the tianshen sect will not let you off!</p><p>The great sage of the heavenly God sect shouted.</p><p>The deity was a rare genius of the Tian Shen sect. He had a great chance of breaking into the Saint realm in the future.</p><p>They had already lost Luo shuihan, and the deity could not die.</p><p>Previously, Luo shuihan was here because they couldn’t interfere in the treasure fixing assembly. But now it was not the treasure fixing assembly, so they must protect the divine Son.</p><p>“Then I will flatten the Tian Shen sect!”</p><p>This was Lu Ming’s response. It was domineering and he was closing in on the divine Son in an instant.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The divine Son knew that he could not escape. A crazed look flashed in his eyes as he charged at Lu Ming with his combat sword in hand.</p><p>However, his current abilities were only equivalent to an initial bright Saint. He was no match for Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming swung his sword and struck the divine son’s combat sword. The combat sword trembled and the terrifying power made it difficult for the divine Son to even hold his sword. The great saint weapon was sent flying.</p><p>Lu Ming used his quintessential essence to suck the combat sword into his hand and kept it.</p><p>“Lu Ming, if we’re going to die, let’s die together!”</p><p>The divine Son roared, and the vital essence in his body erupted. He actually wanted to self-destruct and die with Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
