Without a war, this kind of bitter cultivation is too slow!</p><p>Lu Ming ended his cultivation and muttered to himself.</p><p>In fact, he had comprehended the path under the path-understanding ancient tree, and with the help of the heavenly Dao stone, his cultivation speed was not slow. However, compared to the speed of tempering himself in battle, it was naturally much slower.</p><p>there are as many heaven’s pride experts as clouds here. It just so happens that there’s someone to train with. Wouldn’t it be a pity to miss it!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and changed into a long black robe. He exited the mountain and river diagram and headed out of dark water city.</p><p>After leaving Darkwater city, he looked at the lake not far away. Sure enough, he saw many young men standing in the air above the lake. There were also two young men who were engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm glowed and an Asura mask appeared in his hand. He put it on his face and instantly, he looked more ferocious.</p><p>Lu Ming had once used this Asura mask when his cultivation level was not high. With its material, a high-level Martial Emperor would be able to see through it with a single glance.</p><p>However, Lu Ming covered it with his essential core and others could not see through it.</p><p>With the Shura mask on, Lu Ming stepped forward toward the youths, a cold aura emanating from his body.</p><p>Some people were alarmed and looked in Lu Ming’s direction. They were surprised to see him wearing the Asura mask.</p><p>Hmph, a Lv 9 martial Royal realm expert wearing a mask. He’s trying to act mysterious and mysterious!</p><p>Someone snorted coldly and looked at Lu Ming with a cold gaze.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming made his move. He took a step forward and appeared above the person who had spoken. He took a step forward.</p><p>A foot that reached up to the sky was formed, like the foot of a God, and it stepped toward the person who spoke.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The man let out a long howl and his vital essence exploded. His aura soared and condensed into a saber, slashing at Lu Ming.</p><p>The saber also carried the power of laws.</p><p>This person was an expert at the second stage of the half-Saint realm. He had an upper-class earth spiritual body, and his combat strength was amazing. When he wielded his blade, it was earth-shattering.</p><p>Just when many people thought that Lu Ming would be killed in one move, the result was beyond everyone’s expectations.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The giant foot stomped down, and the saber collapsed. The giant foot continued to stomp down.</p><p>The second stage half-Saint was smashed into the lake below by Lu Ming’s foot. He spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. His fist glowed and he threw a punch.</p><p>A terrifying fist force seemed to penetrate the void and blasted toward the lake below.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The water in the lake rose to the sky, and the waves rippled. The water in the area was blasted away by the fist force, revealing the bottom of the lake.</p><p>There was a huge pit at the bottom of the lake. The man at the second stage of the half-Saint realm was lying in the pit. He was no longer breathing. He had been killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out his hand and sucked. His quintessential essence was like a ribbon, sweeping up the other party’s storage ring. The lake water flowed backward. That proud Son of Heaven would remain at the bottom of the lake forever.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>Although the man in the Asura mask was only at Lv 9 martial Royal realm, he was not a ghost. He was a terrifying existence.</p><p>“Which force is this heaven’s favorite from?”</p><p>Some people guessed.</p><p>After all, there were simply too many Emperor-ranked powers. Every day, there would be geniuses from Emperor-ranked powers joining. No one knew what kind of geniuses would appear.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were like lightning and as cold as a knife as he scanned the surroundings.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across some people and they could not help but feel a chill in their hearts.</p><p>“You, fight me!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were fixed on a young man in a blood-red robe. He took a step forward and threw a punch at the young man.</p><p>Having been in the hundred clan battlefield for a few months, Lu Ming had already gotten used to the rules here.</p><p>In this place, there were no rules. There were only trials and challenges. In this place, you didn’t need to have any reason to attack anyone.</p><p>Lu Ming was here to fight with experts. He did not want to waste time and took the initiative to attack.</p><p>“Don’t think that you can fight me just because you killed a piece of trash. Kill!”</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming dared to attack him, the young man in the blood-red robe suddenly exploded with a murderous intent. His body was covered in blood-red light. He waved his palm and a blood-red palm print was blasted toward Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw two more punches in a row, which collided with the bloody palm print, creating terrifying fluctuations. Lu Ming’s fist force was immediately dispersed. The bloody palm print did not stop, carrying a terrifying power of law as it came crashing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>amazing! The heavenly spiritual body is indeed powerful!</p><p>Lu Ming was not shocked. Instead, he was overjoyed. He stepped forward and his essential core surged into the flowing essence gloves. He threw a punch and destroyed the bloody palm print. Then, he continued to attack the blood-robed young man.</p><p>This blood-robed young man had a heavenly spiritual body, which was on the same level as Huang Ling and Wan Tiancheng.</p><p>If Lu Ming wanted to take action, he would naturally choose the most powerful people. What use would the weak ones be?</p><p>“Blood devil palm!”</p><p>The blood-robed young man roared. A blood-red light filled the air, and his body seemed to turn into a thick blood aura. The law of blood burst out, forming a huge palm print that pressed down on Lu Ming, wanting to smash him into a pulp of flesh.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body glowed. Bright spots glowed and twelve holy weapons appeared.</p><p>Lu Ming gripped the Black Dragon Spear and infused it with combat weapon Qi. The chaos Domain covered it and transformed it into a Spear’s gleam that was as large as a mountain. He stabbed it into the sky.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a deafening boom, the spear radiance and the bloody palm print disappeared at the same time.</p><p>that’s the ten thousand soldiers scroll. He’s from the WAN family!</p><p>the WAN family has produced such a terrifying heaven’s favorite. He’s only at the ninth level of the martial Royal realm and he’s already so powerful? ”</p><p>Some people exclaimed in disbelief.</p><p>“Kill the WAN clan!”</p><p>The young man in the blood-red robe was extremely powerful. His killing intent was cold as he stepped into the air. The blood Qi on his body became thicker and thicker, as if he had turned into a sea of blood.</p><p>Huala!</p><p>A blood-red flag appeared in his hand.</p><p>He waved the blood flag and it expanded rapidly, bringing the sea of blood with it as it wrapped around Lu Ming.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The Black Dragon Spear in Lu Ming’s hand was thrown out like a black lightning bolt, piercing through the sea of blood. At the same time, Lu Ming took a step forward with his holy weapon sword in hand. With a slash of the sword, a shocking sword Qi was released, as if it was going to split the world.</p><p>The sea of blood was split open, but after rolling for a while, it gathered together again.</p><p>The Black Dragon Spear flew back without any success.</p><p>The sea of blood spread and the blood flag covered the sky, shrouding Lu Ming.</p><p>“Turn into a pool of blood!”</p><p>The blood-robed youth said coldly.</p><p>the man wearing the Asura mask is finished. He’s been enveloped by the flag of blood prison. He’s definitely going to die and turn into a pool of blood!</p><p>that’s right. Young master blood prison’s combat strength is astonishing. Once the blood prison flag is used, even the heaven’s favorites of the same level as him won’t dare to be enveloped by it. Although the masked man’s combat strength is terrifying, he’s only at the ninth level of the martial Royal realm!</p><p>“Another chosen has fallen!”</p><p>Discussions broke out in all directions. Even the two young men who had been fighting fiercely at the beginning had stopped fighting.</p><p>Lu Ming was enveloped by the blood prison flag, blocking out the sky and the sun. He looked around and saw blood flags and a sea of blood.</p><p>A terrifying blood aura seeped towards Lu Ming continuously, trying to refine him into a pool of blood.</p><p>Lu Ming blocked it with his chaos realm. The chaos realm emitted a series of sizzling sounds.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
