Surrender and join my Tian Shen sect in the future. Then, I’ll let you go!</p><p>Cai Ying said lightly.</p><p>...</p><p>He was too embarrassed to be cruel to such a young lady.</p><p>“No, no!”</p><p>Su Lei’s little head immediately shook like a rattle and said, ” I won’t surrender. I’m a disciple of the Dragon God Valley. I said we should stop here because I didn’t want to kill you!</p><p>What?</p><p>Many people were dumbfounded.</p><p>Su Lei had said ‘stop’ because she was afraid that she would hurt Cai Ying’s life.</p><p>Many people shook their heads and laughed.</p><p>Cai Ying was the top genius in this treasure auction. Unless it was the monstrous Lu Ming from three years ago, no one would be able to kill Cai Ying. At most, they would be able to defeat him.</p><p>“Little girl, so you’re pretending to be innocent to play with me. You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Cai Ying was furious, and her eyes were filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>He thought that su Lei was completely toying with him.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Cai Ying’s figure flashed and she slapped towards su Lei. A huge khaki-colored hand pressed down on su Lei.</p><p>What Cai Ying cultivated was not the divine cultivation technique of the tianshen sect, but another one.</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar came from su Lei’s body. Then, su Lei followed up with a palm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Su Lei’s small hand hit the big yellow hand. The big yellow hand seemed to be frozen by a cold air and shattered with a bang.</p><p>“Mountain crushing fist!”</p><p>Cai Ying’s first attack had failed, so she kept punching out with her fists. Rays of khaki-colored fist radiance, which were like mountains, pressed down on su Lei.</p><p>Su Lei’s petite body seemed as if it would be drowned at any moment.</p><p>Some people in the Dragon God Valley couldn’t help but feel nervous.</p><p>But at this moment, a River of profound Yin appeared on su Lei’s body, exuding a terrifying chill.</p><p>The xuanyin River surrounded su Lei’s body. Her palms rotated in the air, and a terrifying cold current burst out, shattering the mountain-like fist radiance.</p><p>Then, su Lei took a step forward and rushed towards Cai Ying. She struck out with her palm and the mysterious Yin River turned into a mysterious Yin Dragon. It flew out and destroyed everything.</p><p>Cai Ying’s pupils contracted rapidly as she punched out with both her fists. However, wherever the mysterious Yin Dragon passed by, all her attacks were destroyed.</p><p>Cai Ying was shocked. He took a step forward and instantly set up eighteen yellow walls in front of him, trying to block the attack of the mysterious Yin Dragon.</p><p>The mysterious Yin Dragon let out a long roar and turned back into a mysterious Yin River. The river became bigger rapidly and the water was overflowing. It flooded down and drowned Cai Ying in the river.</p><p>“Collect!”</p><p>The next moment, su Lei spoke softly and kept the mysterious Yin River. She then saw Cai Ying standing stiffly on the fighting ring. There was no breath on his body.</p><p>He was dead!</p><p>Cai Ying was dead. She was killed by su Lei.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>At this moment, Cai Ying’s body shattered like ice.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss …</p><p>Everyone in the audience gasped and looked at su Lei with shock.</p><p>Su Lei, who looked timid and harmless, had actually killed Cai Ying.</p><p>Cai Ying was a top-notch expert with a superior earth spiritual body. Su Lei had actually killed him.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The Dragon God Valley burst into cheers, while the tianshen sect was dead silent.</p><p>Luo shuihan’s face was so dark that it was about to drip water.</p><p>A heaven’s favorite with a superior-grade earth spiritual body had died just like that. It was a heavy loss. A heaven’s favorite with a superior-grade earth spiritual body had the potential to become one of the top ten geniuses in the Azure region. It was extremely rare.</p><p>It was also because the tianshen sect had become stronger and stronger in the past few decades. It had the aura of the top sect in Cangzhou. Therefore, it had received many heaven’s favorites. For other sects, it was already very good to have one or two.</p><p>could it be that Dragon God Valley is going to make a comeback like three years ago? ”</p><p>Many people had this thought.</p><p>Su Lei could even kill the most powerful heaven’s pride expert. She really had the power to turn the tide.</p><p>The heaven’s favorites from the other sects looked at su Lei with fear and seriousness.</p><p>In the Dragon God Valley, many people looked at Lu Ming with admiration.</p><p>They knew that su Lei and Qiu Yingying were recommended by Lu Ming. However, they did not expect that they were so talented.</p><p>There was a smile on Lu Ming’s face. Even spirit bodies of the same level had differences in strength. Su Lei’s mysterious Yin dragon body was undoubtedly an extremely terrifying physique.</p><p>“I … I told you to stop there, you … You just don’t listen!”</p><p>Su Lei muttered softly.</p><p>Although her voice was soft, it still spread to the entire scene. Many people were speechless when they heard it, but the people of the tianshen sect wanted to vomit blood.</p><p>In the beginning, who knew that su Lei was so strong?</p><p>Su Lei muttered a few words and returned to the platform.</p><p>“Senior brother Lu Ming, I … It’s alright, right?”</p><p>Su Lei looked at Lu Ming and asked timidly.</p><p>Yes, that’s right. But su Lei, you can’t be soft-hearted when dealing with your enemies. If you don’t kill them, they will kill you and even your family. Do you understand? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>yes, yes, su Lei understands!</p><p>Su Lei nodded.</p><p>This made the hearts of the disciples of the tianshen sect, the Tianyu demonic sect, and the Yudu sect sink.</p><p>“We’re going to change our tactics!”</p><p>The leader of the Tian Yu demon sect said.</p><p>The leaders of the heaven God sect and the desire poison sect had ugly expressions. They muttered to themselves for a moment before helplessly nodding their heads.</p><p>In the beginning, they had wanted to use a tag-team battle to eliminate Dragon God Valley in advance.</p><p>But now, Dragon God Valley had su Lei who could kill a top heaven’s pride expert. This was troublesome. If they fought them one after another, they would probably lose their lives.</p><p>At that time, he wouldn’t even be able to participate in the treasure Trade fair.</p><p>They could only walk the same path as three years ago and eliminate a few weak sects to maintain their position in the top ten.</p><p>This really made them vomit blood. In the beginning, they had come in a menacing manner and wanted to destroy Dragon God Valley First. But now, they had no choice but to follow the same path as three years ago. There was nothing more ironic than this.</p><p>The disciples of the three sects, especially Luo shuihan and Mo Yang, looked even gloomier.</p><p>Could it be that things would really develop like they did three years ago?</p><p>Many people thought so.</p><p>If that was the case, the three major sects, including the heavenly God sect, would lose a lot of face.</p><p>After that, the Tianyu demonic sect began to send people to challenge the weaker sects, and it was Dragon God Valley’s turn to continue hunting the paragons of the three major sects.</p><p>But the three sects had no choice but to accept it.</p><p>Round after round.</p><p>After many rounds, the three weakest forces were finally eliminated by the combined efforts of the deity sect, the sky demon sect, and the Yu Du sect.</p><p>The top ten had been born!</p><p>After the top ten were born, the tianshen sect, the Tianyu demon sect, and the Yudu sect were finally going to take action against Dragon God Valley.</p><p>let’s take turns to defeat Dragon God Valley!</p><p>The eyes of the paragons of the three sects burned with fire.</p><p>The tianshen sect first sent a top sovereign to challenge the sovereign of the Ice Dragon Valley and defeat him.</p><p>Then, the Tianyu demonic sect sent a top sovereign to fight with the leader of the Dragon God Valley team. The battle was extremely intense, but in the end, the man from the Tianyu demonic sect was stronger. He came prepared and knocked the leader of the Dragon God Valley team out of the fighting ring.</p><p>In this way, only Qiu Ying Ying and su Lei were left in Dragon God Valley.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
