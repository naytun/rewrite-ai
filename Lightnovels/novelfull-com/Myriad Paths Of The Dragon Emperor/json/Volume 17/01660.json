He did not expect su Lei to be so unyielding.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression did not change. He was very close to su Lei. If su Lei really committed suicide, he had dozens of ways to save her. Therefore, there was no need for him to be in a hurry. He had to see su Lei’s mother first.</p><p>“What’s there to be afraid? If anything happens to my mother, you can only have my corpse!”</p><p>Su Lei said firmly, her eyes revealing a determined look.</p><p>“Go and bring her mother here!”</p><p>At this moment, the SU family head instructed.</p><p>If su Lei died, she would lose her use. At that time, the heaven’s God sect’s Paragon might leave in a fit of anger. They had no choice but to be apprehensive.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Some people were heading towards the palace at the back.</p><p>Soon, someone brought a middle-aged woman here.</p><p>Lei ‘er, why are you back? hurry up and leave. Don’t worry about me!</p><p>When the middle-aged woman saw su Lei, her face changed and she shouted.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>Su Qin berated.</p><p>“Let my mother come over!”</p><p>Su Lei shouted.</p><p>The master of the SU family waved his hand, and the man let go of su Lei’s mother.</p><p>Anyway, this was the SU family’s residence. Lu Ming and the rest were already surrounded by the SU family’s experts. They could not escape even if they had wings.</p><p>The middle-aged woman ran over and hugged su Lei.</p><p>“Mother, are you alright?”</p><p>Su Lei put away the dagger and looked at the middle-aged woman.</p><p>“Lei ‘er, why did you come back? you’ve already run out. As long as you return to Dragon God Valley, they can’t do anything to you!”</p><p>The middle-aged woman said with a sad face.</p><p>“Mother, Lei ‘er can’t leave you behind!”</p><p>Su Lei said.</p><p>“Lei ‘er …”</p><p>The middle-aged woman’s tears kept flowing. Suddenly, she ran to the SU family’s head and knelt down, begging, ” family head, I beg you, let Lei ‘er go. No matter what, Lei’ er is still a direct descendant of the SU family. I beg you to let her go!</p><p>Su Lei’s family was originally the direct line of descent of the SU family and had quite a high status. However, after su Lei’s father and grandfather died in battle, their family’s status plummeted.</p><p>get up. You said it yourself. Su Lei is a direct descendant of the SU family. I asked her to do this for the SU family. Since she is a direct descendant of the SU family, what’s the big deal with sacrificing a little for the family? Moreover, I’m not trying to take her life. I’m just giving her a chance. After all, she’s a heaven’s favorite of the tianshen sect!”</p><p>&Nbsp; the SU family head spoke with an extremely cold tone.</p><p>“But … In this case, if the other party doesn’t want Lei ‘er, Lei’ er will be ruined. Family head, I beg you, let Lei ‘er go!”</p><p>Su Lei’s mother continued to plead.</p><p>“It’s useless no matter who you beg today!”</p><p>At this time, a cold voice sounded.</p><p>Then, three figures stepped into the courtyard.</p><p>The three young men were dressed in white robes. With one look, one could tell that they were disciples of the heavenly God sect.</p><p>One of them had a red face, as if there was a fire burning in his body.</p><p>This person should be the Zheng Fei who was poisoned by the fire Lotus poison.</p><p>The three of them stepped forward. Zheng Fei stared at su Lei and shouted, ” “All of you, why aren’t you taking down this girl and letting her help me dispel the fire poison? why aren’t you all …”</p><p>With the fire poison in his body, he felt as if he was constantly being burned by flames. The pain was unbearable, and Zheng Fei couldn’t wait to have sex with su Lei immediately.</p><p>that’s right. You’re dragging out such a small matter. If anything happens to my Junior Brother, don’t expect us to help your su family. At that time, we’ll go directly to the other three families and see how your su family can get first place!</p><p>Another heaven’s pride expert of the heavenly God sect coldly spoke.</p><p>The faces of the SU family’s master and Su Qin changed drastically. If the heaven’s pride expert of the deity sect were to help the other three families in a fit of anger, the SU family would have no chance.</p><p>su Lei, you b * tch! Hurry up and take senior brother Zheng Fei away to serve him. If you delay the important matters, not only you, but all of you will die!</p><p>Su Qin screamed.</p><p>Su Qin had joined the deity sect, but she was only a small figure in the deity sect. It was not easy for her to invite a few geniuses to help the SU family, and she did not want su Lei to ruin her plans.</p><p>Su Qin, don’t think that we don’t know what you’re thinking. You’re selfish. When the SU family gets first place and enters the ancestral land, you’ll definitely be the one to enter. You’re going to sacrifice the young lady to enter the ancestral land. How vicious!</p><p>Su Cha couldn’t help but shout.</p><p>“How dare you, a lowly servant girl, speak to me like this? slap your mouth!”</p><p>Su Qin’s face was cold. She moved and rushed towards su Cha, wanting to slap him.</p><p>Su Qin’s cultivation was at the LV 6 martial Royal realm. Although su Cha had some cultivation, he was only at the LV 2 martial Royal realm. He could not Dodge Su Qin’s attack.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was about to make a move, su Lei rushed out and hit Su Qin with her palm, causing Su Qin to retreat.</p><p>Su Lei’s cultivation was similar to Su Qin’s, but su Lei’s spiritual body was much stronger than su Lei’s. It was a medium-grade earth spiritual body, and her combat strength was far above Su Qin’s.</p><p>“Su Lei, you dare to stop me? I’m telling you, you have no choice today. All of this is for the SU family!”</p><p>Su Qin screamed.</p><p>“No other choice? Why would I?”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming, who had been silent all this while, finally spoke.</p><p>The others could not help but look at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kid, what do you mean?”</p><p>Su Qin’s gaze turned to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and a long spear suddenly condensed in his hand.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming flicked his hand and the long spear shot toward Zheng Fei at lightning speed.</p><p>This scene was too sudden. No one had expected that Lu Ming would suddenly kill Zheng Fei.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The long spear pierced through Zheng Fei’s dantian, destroying his spirit God and nailing him to the ground.</p><p>Zheng Fei’s eyes were wide open in disbelief.</p><p>Never in his dreams did he expect that Lu Ming would suddenly attack him.</p><p>Then, the light in Zheng Fei’s eyes dimmed, and there was no sign of life.</p><p>The whole place was silent!</p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded and thought they were dreaming.</p><p>“You … You …”</p><p>Su Qin raised her trembling hand and pointed at Lu Ming, unable to say a word.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had been standing there without saying a word. Su Qin had almost ignored him. Never in her wildest dreams did she expect Lu Ming to suddenly attack and kill Zheng Fei in one blow.</p><p>now, there’s no need to choose. He’s already a dead man!</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>ah, ah, you dare to kill senior brother Zheng Fei? you’re looking for death, you’re looking for death …</p><p>Su Qin screamed hysterically. Zheng Fei’s death meant that her plan was ruined.</p><p>“Brat, you’re looking for death. Kill!”</p><p>The remaining two disciples of the divine sky sect were furious. The aura of Lv 9 martial Royal realm emanated from their bodies.</p><p>Holy light filled the air as the two geniuses of the tianshen sect charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and two long Spears formed, piercing towards the two heaven deity sect’s paragons.</p><p>The attack and defense of the two heaven God sect paragons were completely destroyed by Lu Ming’s long spear.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>The two long Spears pierced through their dantians, destroying their spiritual gods. Just like Zheng Fei, they were nailed to the ground.</p><p>A one-hit kill!</p><p>The two geniuses of the tianshen sect who were at the ninth level of the martial Royal realm could not even withstand a single blow from Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
