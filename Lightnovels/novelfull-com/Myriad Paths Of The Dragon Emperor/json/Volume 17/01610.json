Each battle lasted for half an hour.</p><p>This was a life-and-death battle. Lu Ming’s improvement was very fast.</p><p>...</p><p>With every battle, Lu Ming’s chaos realm was greatly improved. The improvement of the chaos realm also improved his cultivation. Ten days later, Lu Ming’s cultivation had reached the late-stage of the eighth level Martial Emperor realm. He was not far from the peak of the eighth level Martial Emperor realm. This speed was already very shocking.</p><p>Lu Ming was not the only one who had improved. Xu Ran had also improved. He was more and more skilled in using the power of law.</p><p>Originally, Xu Ran had just entered the second stage of the half-Saint realm. Now, he was slowly crossing over to the later stage of the second stage.</p><p>However, it was obvious that Lu Ming had improved faster. Hence, ten days later, when Lu Ming fought with Xu Ran, although he was still at a disadvantage, it was not so obvious anymore.</p><p>The two of them had been fighting for days, and there was a feeling of appreciation for each other.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re too abnormal. If this goes on, it won’t be long before I’m no longer your match!”</p><p>Below the Asura arena, the two of them watched the battle on the fighting ring and chatted.</p><p>“It seems that I have to change my opponent!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>what? ” Xu Ran glared at him and said, ” you really think you can beat me? ”</p><p>no, I just feel that if I can’t kill you, it will lose the meaning of the life-and-death battle!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Xu Ran was stunned for a moment, but then he nodded.</p><p>The two of them had been fighting for days, and they felt that their temperaments were somewhat similar. After the battle two days ago, the two of them even went to drink to their hearts ‘content. Then, they went up to the Asura arena, and really couldn’t kill.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, a loud boom was heard. The sound did not come from the Asura platform, but from outside.</p><p>Outside the Asura stage, there was a battle.</p><p>Many people’s expressions changed.</p><p>In this city, only the Asura arena allowed people to fight. Other places prohibited fighting. Who was so bold to fight in the city? wasn’t he afraid of being killed by a Saint?</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>“Who is it that dares to fight in the city?”</p><p>Instantly, the paragons below the fighting ring rushed out one after another. Lu Ming and Xu Ran exchanged a glance and also rushed out.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>As soon as they got outside, they heard a violent roar and everyone looked up at the sky.</p><p>In the sky, there were two figures engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>Two rays of light crossed each other, and a terrifying force swept in all directions.</p><p>In the sky, two phenomena appeared.</p><p>One was a weapon that was moving freely in the void, while the other was a Phoenix that was bathing in tribulation fire.</p><p>The heaven and earth phenomenon indicated that the two people fighting were both heavenly spiritual bodies.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With another boom, the two figures separated and retreated hundreds of meters back, standing in the air.</p><p>One of them was a young man in a purple and gold robe. He was surrounded by 12 Saint weapons, and the Qi of the weapons shot up into the sky.</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>This young man was the distinguished young man from the WAN family.</p><p>The other one was a peerless beauty with a graceful figure and exquisite curves. Her skin was like jade and could cause the downfall of a city.</p><p>On her back, a pair of phoenix wings extended, adding to her strange temperament.</p><p>undying celestial Phoenix! This person’s spiritual body should be the undying celestial phoenix body that was condensed from the bloodline of the undying celestial Phoenix!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up when he saw the woman.</p><p>The undying celestial Phoenix was one of the top ten Battle Beasts. It was a unique existence in the Phoenix Clan, just like the nine Dragons in the dragon clan.</p><p>The undying celestial Phoenix was stronger than an ordinary Phoenix.</p><p>After coming to the yuan continent, this was the first time Lu Ming had met a genius who had awakened the bloodline of one of the top ten war beasts.</p><p>Through the surrounding discussions, Lu Ming knew the names of the two people.</p><p>The young man from the WAN family was named Wan Tiancheng, and the woman who had cultivated the undying Heavenly Phoenix body was named Huang Ling.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>His Saint weapon buzzed, and Wan Tiancheng stepped forward. His combat weapon Qi was like a rainbow, and his combat sword slashed towards Huang Ling.</p><p>The cry of a Phoenix resounded. Behind Huang Ling, a pair of phoenix wings flapped, forming a sky full of flames and bombarding towards Wan Tiancheng.</p><p>A terrifying collision erupted, and the sky was filled with the Qi of combat weapons and flames. The onlookers were forced to retreat, unable to get close.</p><p>how terrifying! His combat strength is close to the level of the Saint realm!</p><p>they only have low-class heaven spiritual bodies. I really don’t know how terrifying those with medium-class or high-class heaven spiritual bodies are. Maybe they can kill Saints before they become Saints!</p><p>Wan Tiancheng and Huang Ling’s combat strength shocked everyone. No wonder they dared to fight in the city. With such combat strength, even if the saints in the city attacked, the two could probably escape.</p><p>The battle weapon Qi and flames swept across the sky. Wan Tiancheng and Huang Ling kept colliding. The battle was reaching its climax, and no one dared to stop in that area.</p><p>No, there was one person!</p><p>A young Man in Black stood not far away from the battle. He had his arms crossed, and a layer of light emanated from his body, blocking the battle weapon Qi and flames that were sweeping in all directions.</p><p>“Who is this person?”</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>“It looks like Sima Liang!”</p><p>it’s him! Another heavenly spiritual body!</p><p>Someone cried out in surprise. They recognized this young Man in Black, who was also an extremely powerful heaven’s favorite.</p><p>“Hahaha, it’s really lively!”</p><p>With a loud laugh, an unusually burly young man stepped through the air. He was two heads taller than ordinary people, and his muscles were as firm as iron.</p><p>He stepped forward in the air. The Qi of the soldiers and the flames fell on him, but he seemed to feel nothing.</p><p>beast Zhao Kuang! Another heavenly spiritual body!</p><p>“What’s going on? Aren’t these freaks all in the depths of the hundred clan battlefield? why have they all come to the outskirts?”</p><p>“Could it be that something big is happening in the outer region?”</p><p>Many people were guessing.</p><p>The depths of the hundred clan battlefield was the heart of the ancient war. There were many opportunities there. Some abnormal geniuses and most half-Saints were gathered there.</p><p>They could only temper themselves in the depths of the hundred clan battlefield. Those on the outskirts were much weaker.</p><p>These abnormal people rarely came to the periphery of the hundred clan battlefield, but today, four abnormal people had appeared all at once.</p><p>“Sima Liang, it’s a rare sight. Fight me!”</p><p>Zhao Kuang’s eyes were burning with battle intent as he strode towards Sima Liang.</p><p>“Just what I wanted!”</p><p>Sima Liang said coldly. An ancient halberd appeared in his hand, and a terrifying aura emanated from it.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Zhao Kuang let out a terrifying roar. He was like an ancient wild beast, wild and violent. He wore a glove on each hand as he punched toward Sima Liang.</p><p>The heavenly halberd in Sima Liang’s hand also came slashing down.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>A terrifying tremor burst forth, as if the entire city was shaking violently.</p><p>Zhao Kuang and Sima Liang’s bodies trembled as they both retreated.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>Zhao Kuang roared, and the battle intent in his eyes grew even stronger. He once again pounced towards Sima Liang, but Sima Liang was not afraid at all. With the heavenly halberd in his hand, he slashed towards Zhao Kuang.</p><p>The two of them began an intense battle.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
