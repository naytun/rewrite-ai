Gradually, he fell into darkness and could not feel anything.</p><p>After an unknown period of time, Lu Ming gradually regained his consciousness.</p><p>...</p><p>He slowly opened his eyes. His eyes revealed the vicissitudes of life, as if he had experienced the vicissitudes of life.</p><p>he actually experienced nine lives and nine reincarnations. Could it be that reincarnation really exists in the world? ”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered to himself, his eyes filled with complicated emotions.</p><p>At this moment, a series of images appeared in his mind.</p><p>He remembered everything.</p><p>He drank the Meng Po soup, jumped into the whirlpool, and fell into the darkness. After that, he experienced nine lives.</p><p>In his first life, he was born into a family of generals in the Empire. From a young age, he led the Army to war and conquered the world. When he was middle-aged, he became the defender-general of the Empire, who had a large number of troops in his hands. However, he was suspected by the Emperor and he killed Lu Ming on a false charge.</p><p>Then, he was reincarnated.</p><p>In his second Life, he became a scholar from a poor family. He was determined to be the top scorer, but he fell in love with a noble family’s daughter when he was the top scorer. In the end, he was secretly killed by the noble family.</p><p>And then, it was the third life!</p><p>In this life, he became an ordinary person, a villager of a small village. He married and had children. The men worked the fields while the women weaved. In the end, he had a house full of children and grandchildren. His hair was white, and he died of old age.</p><p>The fourth life …</p><p>The fifth life …</p><p>In his ninth life, he became a good-for-nothing who couldn’t awaken his bloodline. His bloodline was dug out by his childhood sweetheart, and then he accidentally obtained the Supreme shrine and embarked on the martial path.</p><p>Later on, when he awakened the third bloodline, the third bloodline let out a loud roar. He woke up all of a sudden, as if his reincarnation had ended.</p><p>The Ninth Life is my own experience, and it’s exactly the same as my own experience. Is there really reincarnation in this world, or have I awakened the memories of the previous eight lives? ”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. He was shocked and confused. He could not tell what was real and what was fake.</p><p>Then, was his life also one of the reincarnations?</p><p>Was everything he had experienced all along the way real or fake?</p><p>“Little guy, I didn’t expect you to wake up after experiencing nine lives. This is really beyond my expectations!”</p><p>At this moment, an old voice entered Lu Ming’s ears.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He then looked around.</p><p>He was in a huge secret chamber, and an old Man in Black was walking toward him.</p><p>“Senior, Who are you?”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>“In the past, everyone called me Samsara!”</p><p>The old man smiled.</p><p>reincarnation! You are the reincarnation Emperor!</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but exclaim.</p><p>His mind slowly cleared up.</p><p>Could it be that the reincarnation Emperor was still alive?</p><p>well, you can say that. But now, it’s only a wisp of a soul!</p><p>The old man said with a smile.</p><p>Lu Ming took a closer look and realized that the other party was not a physical entity. It was more like a shadow or a wisp of soul.</p><p>“Senior Samsara, is there really such a thing as Samsara in this world?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>In his mind, fragments of those nine lives flashed past from time to time.</p><p>“Does reincarnation really exist in this world? I don’t know!”</p><p>The reincarnation Emperor sighed.</p><p>“You don’t know either?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled. It was said that the reincarnation Emperor controlled the law of reincarnation, which was one of the strongest laws in the world. It was on par with the law of chaos. Did he not know about reincarnation?</p><p>Then, were the nine lives he had experienced real or fake? How could it be so real?</p><p>little guy, do you have any doubts about your previous experience? in fact, that was not really reincarnation. It was just a reflection in the depths of your heart. You can understand it as a kind of illusion, or rather, it could also be that it awakened the memories of your previous life!</p><p>Said the reincarnation Emperor.</p><p>“So there’s no reincarnation in this world!” Lu Ming heaved a long sigh of relief and his mind regained its calm.</p><p>it’s hard to say. Maybe when my cultivation reaches a high enough level, I can really reincarnate. Unfortunately, my cultivation level is not high enough!</p><p>The reincarnation Emperor sighed and looked at Lu Ming.”Little guy, what’s your name? you’re the first one to wake up in your group. I thought that the strongest one among you would have to experience hundreds of lives before waking up. You’re really strange!”</p><p>“I’m lu Ming. Senior, how long have I been here?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>you’ve been here for three months!</p><p>Said the reincarnation Emperor.</p><p>“Three months? that’s good!”</p><p>Lu Ming felt relieved.</p><p>He had experienced nine lives, and it felt like he had experienced a long time. He had comprehended the different lives of nine lives. He was still afraid, but in reality, he had also experienced a long time. Three months was still fine.</p><p>“Senior, did you build this tomb? There’s also the helpless Yellow Springs from before …”</p><p>Lu Ming then asked a bunch of questions.</p><p>He was really curious.</p><p>of course not. I was almost gone in that battle. Later on, a peerless master came here and built a tomb for me. He also saved a wisp of my soul. Everything outside was done by that master. Perhaps he didn’t want me to waste my life’s knowledge, so he left a tomb for me to pass on my legacy!</p><p>The reincarnation Emperor explained.</p><p>“As expected!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. He had heard of the legend before. It was said that after the hundred clan war, an unparalleled expert came to the hundred clan battlefield and cultivated nine of the strongest great emperors into nine graves.</p><p>The thousand kills Martial Emperor from the thousand kills mansion had entered one of the great Emperor’s tombs and obtained the inheritance.</p><p>It seemed that the netherworld helplessness from before was indeed fake. It was a trap set up by that peerless expert.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you cultivate the nine Dragons combat body, right? Speaking of which, you have some connections with that unparalleled expert. That expert is one of the top ten war beasts, the nine lives devilish silkworm!”</p><p>Said the reincarnation Emperor.</p><p>“Nine lives devilish silkworm!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>According to dandan, the top ten war beasts had all been killed in a battle a long time ago, but now it seemed that things were not that simple.</p><p>Through a special method, dandan managed to keep her life.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming saw the Titan Longhorn. He heard that the nine lives devilish silkworm was still alive.</p><p>Perhaps, many of the top ten war beasts still existed in this world!</p><p>“What a pity, what a pity!”</p><p>At this moment, the reincarnation Emperor looked at Lu Ming carefully and sighed.</p><p>“Senior, what’s a pity?” Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>you were the first to wake up after experiencing nine lives. You could have received my inheritance, mastered the reincarnation domain, and then comprehended the reincarnation law. Unfortunately, you have already comprehended the chaos Domain!</p><p>chaos and reincarnation are one of the ten strongest laws in the world. Just like how a mountain can not contain two tigers, they are difficult to control and fuse at the same time …</p><p>The reincarnation Emperor sighed and explained in detail.</p><p>Cultivators, after cultivating to a certain realm, could control many laws at the same time.</p><p>However, there were ten ultimate maxims in the world that were difficult to control at the same time. Since ancient times, only rare geniuses and peerless talents could control one of them.</p><p>It was impossible to control two or more.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
