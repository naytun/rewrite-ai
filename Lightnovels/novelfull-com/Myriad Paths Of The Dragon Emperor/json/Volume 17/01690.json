Again!”</p><p>Lu Yuan roared and took a step forward. His body was like a mountain of metal as he charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming’s essential core was infused into the flowing element gloves and he began to fight Lu Yuan. They exchanged dozens of moves in the blink of an eye.</p><p>this Lu Ming is so powerful. He can actually fight with Lu Yuan!</p><p>it’s indeed shocking. Could it be that Lu Ming did not use his full strength just now? ”</p><p>look, Lu Ming’s aura has been completely revealed. He’s at the second stage of the half-Saint realm!</p><p>he’s really at the second stage of the semi-sage realm. It’s amazing that a second stage semi-Sage has such a strong combat strength!</p><p>Many people in the surroundings exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>Previously, it was not a big deal that Lu Ming could defeat a second stage half-Saint sovereign because he had to use dozens of moves to defeat his opponent. But now, Lu Ming was actually able to fight Lu Yuan. Everyone was shocked.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two of them had exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Lu Yuan roared in his heart. He actually could not take down Lu Ming. He started to feel anxious.</p><p>“It’s almost time!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. Then, he formed hand seals with both hands and six sealing gates appeared, sealing Lu Yuan. Lu Yuan’s movements immediately stiffened.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Yuan turned pale with fright.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out his Black Dragon Spear and thrust it at Lu Yuan’s dantian.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The Black Dragon Spear pierced into Lu Yuan’s dantian. Lu Yuan let out an unwilling roar before he died.</p><p>“Lu Yuan is dead!”</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>what a powerful sealing technique. So Lu Ming is skilled in sealing techniques. I know. He had been hiding it all along and deliberately fought with Lu Yuan. Then, he suddenly used the book of sealing to freeze Lu Yuan, who was caught off guard, and then killed him in one fell swoop!</p><p>indeed, this is Lu Ming’s tactic. Lu Yuan was too careless!</p><p>Many people discussed and felt that Lu Ming had died due to his own carelessness.</p><p>“Lu … Ming!”</p><p>In the stands, Luo shuihan’s eyes were as cold as a knife.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually killed Lu Yuan. In this case, the tianshen sect was at a disadvantage.</p><p>Once Lu Yuan died, his points would be reset to zero. This would be extremely disadvantageous to the total points of the heavenly God sect.</p><p>Originally, among the remaining eighteen people, the tianshen sect was in a very advantageous position.</p><p>This was because of the remaining eighteen people, three of them were from the heavenly God sect.</p><p>In addition to Luo shuihan, there was another heaven’s favorite who was almost the same as Lu Yuan.</p><p>Furthermore, a genius like Lu Yuan would not be killed even if he faced the top ten geniuses. If he wanted to rush off the fighting ring, even the top ten geniuses would not be able to kill him.</p><p>At this rate, the points of the deity sect would soon surpass that of the Dragon God Valley sect. At that time, as long as he killed Lu Ming, even if he did not kill Lu Ming, as long as he won the first place, he would get ten extra points. The deity sect would be the first place for sure.</p><p>However, he did not expect that Lu Yuan would be killed by Lu Ming due to his carelessness. In this case, the tianshen sect was a little mysterious.</p><p>“Lu Ming must die!”</p><p>Luo shuihan thought to herself.</p><p>Luo shuihan, it’s your turn next. I’ll send you to accompany Lu Yuan!</p><p>Lu Ming pulled out the bloody spear and pointed it at Luo shuihan. Then, he returned to the stands.</p><p>The competition continued.</p><p>The next match piqued everyone’s interest again.</p><p>Luo Xiang was going to fight a monster.</p><p>Luo Xiang had displayed a terrifying combat strength before. Once he used the life-death Sword Art, no one could defeat him.</p><p>It was amazing that he could reach this stage as a half-Saint.</p><p>Now, facing one of the top ten heaven’s favorites, what would he do?</p><p>However, when the battle began, everyone’s jaws dropped.</p><p>The sword-light swept across and completely suppressed the monster.</p><p>In just a dozen or so moves, the monster was in a dangerous situation and almost had his throat cut by a sword. In the end, in a state of injury, he used all his strength to rush down the fighting ring.</p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded and couldn’t believe their eyes.</p><p>He had defeated one of the top ten geniuses at the second stage of the half-Saint realm. This kind of combat strength was really amazing.</p><p>“So strong, I’m not his match!”</p><p>Zi Feng revealed a bitter expression.</p><p>The other geniuses all looked at Luo Xiang’s proud figure on the fighting ring with solemn expressions.</p><p>how did the life-and-death Sword sect produce such a person?!</p><p>Luo shuihan’s expression was the ugliest.</p><p>If Luo Xiang was already so strong, then after breaking through the law tank, wouldn’t he be no match for him? wouldn’t the number one genius of the Azure continent have to be replaced?</p><p>“No, I have to find an opportunity to get rid of this Luo Xiang!”</p><p>Luo shuihan’s eyes flashed with coldness. She could not let anyone take away her throne as the number one genius of the Azure continent.</p><p>Luo Xiang’s sword technique is sometimes fast and sometimes slow, changing unpredictably. Could it be the legendary law of fast and slow? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes revealed a look of deep thought.</p><p>Lu Ming had once obtained part of the nine Dragons ‘memory fragments. Naturally, his knowledge was far above others.</p><p>He could tell that the law Luo Xiang had comprehended was most likely the law of speed.</p><p>There was no doubt that the ten strongest laws were the strongest in the world.</p><p>However, below the ten ultimate maxims, there were some maxims that were also extremely terrifying. They far exceeded ordinary maxims. The fast and slow maxims were maxims at this level, which were only inferior to the ten ultimate maxims.</p><p>After Luo Xiang, it was Luo shuihan’s turn to fight with another sovereign.</p><p>That heaven’s favorite was second only to the top ten geniuses, but in the hands of Luo shuihan, he had no power to fight back at all. He was madly suppressed by Luo shuihan. In the end, he did not even manage to escape from the Coliseum and was killed by Luo shuihan.</p><p>After killing her opponent, Luo shuihan’s cold eyes looked at Lu Ming, full of provocation.</p><p>Lu Ming had only killed Lu Yuan due to his carelessness. On the other hand, Lu Ming had completely crushed and killed his opponent with his terrifying strength.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and ignored Luo shuihan.</p><p>Junior Brother Lu Ming, Luo shuihan’s combat strength is even more terrifying than it was three years ago. If you’re not confident in fighting him, just admit defeat!</p><p>Zi Feng sighed.</p><p>Luo shuihan’s combat strength was so terrifying that even he could only save his life. He had no chance of winning.</p><p>my master won’t lose. If that Luo shuihan meets my master, she’ll definitely be beaten to a pulp!</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila was unhappy. She pouted and looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>In Xiangxiang Beila’s eyes, Lu Ming was the strongest and would not lose to anyone.</p><p>“Alright, alright, your master is the strongest!”</p><p>Zi Feng said with a bitter smile.</p><p>“Hmph, of course!”</p><p>The little girl finally smiled.</p><p>“This girl!”</p><p>Lu Ming touched Xiangxiang’s little head lovingly.</p><p>The following matches were all extremely intense. The remaining participants were all top-tier heaven’s favorites from the Azure region. Naturally, no one admitted defeat. The battle was extremely intense.</p><p>When this round ended, there were only sixteen people left.</p><p>Dragon God Valley was still in the lead.</p><p>A new round began. The first battle was Zi Feng against Wang Jian.</p><p>In fact, at this point, they no longer used the method of drawing lots, because some people had already fought. If they drew lots, if they drew the same two people again, wouldn’t they have to fight again? There was no need for that.</p><p>Next, it was entirely up to poyuan GUI to rank himself.</p><p>Zi Feng fought with all his might, but unfortunately, he was ultimately no match for Wang Jian and was defeated by him.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Luo shuihan!”</p><p>Po yuangui’s voice sounded.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
