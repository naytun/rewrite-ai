He had always been proud of this. However, he was nothing compared to Lu Ming now.</p><p>Lu Ming had killed a first stage half-Saint with one stomp.</p><p>...</p><p>In his battle with Lu Ming, he probably did not even need to use one foot. He only needed half a foot.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming was telling the truth when he said that he was not qualified to fight him. However, he still said that Lu Ming was arrogant.</p><p>He was clearly the ignorant one.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly.</p><p>Huang Qi left with a red face.</p><p>this person is very strong. No wonder he can be with Feng Ling!</p><p>birds of a feather flock together. It’s normal for two heavenly spiritual bodies to be together. However, this person’s cultivation is too low. It’s hard for him to compete with the other heavenly spiritual bodies!</p><p>“That’s right, unless his cultivation improves!”</p><p>Lu Ming naturally heard these comments, but he only smiled faintly and did not take it to heart.</p><p>Huang Ling, do you have a way to get rid of the slaughter mark of the thousand kills mansion? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked as he walked in front of bi Lin.</p><p>He had the killing mark of the thousand-kill mansion on him. As long as the assassins of the thousand-kill mansion were within a certain range, they could find him through the killing mark. He was not afraid, but he was very annoyed.</p><p>Huang Ling shook her head and said, ” as far as I know, it’s extremely difficult to remove the slaughter mark from the thousand-kill mansion. The more assassins you kill, the stronger the slaughter mark will be. It’s easier for the assassins to sense it. It’s difficult to remove the slaughter mark unless it’s an Emperor level expert!</p><p>“Emperor level expert!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head, his mouth full of bitterness.</p><p>Where was he supposed to find an Emperor-level expert? there was definitely no one in the hundred clan battlefield. Even outside of the hundred clan battlefield, the Azure continent didn’t even have a single Emperor-level expert.</p><p>There were monarch-level powerhouses in other territories, but they were high and mighty and looked down on the world. Why would they help Lu Ming, a Martial Emperor?</p><p>It seemed that he had to be more careful in the future to prevent assassinations from the thousand-kill mansion.</p><p>His main body couldn’t stay in the mountain and river diagram every day. He needed to comprehend the great Dao of heaven and earth and practice fighting, unlike his secondary body, who stayed in the mountain and river diagram every day and could use the Tai Chi formation disk to enhance his mental fire.</p><p>“Lu Ming, even the other Emperor-level forces are afraid of the assassins of the thousand-kill mansion. Generally, they don’t dare to kill the assassins of the thousand-kill mansion. At most, they will just cripple the other party. Once you are entangled by the slaughter mark, you will face endless assassinations. You must be careful in the future!”</p><p>Huang Ling warned.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. The two of them did not stop and headed towards Darkwater city.</p><p>Darkwater city was several times larger than the city that Lu Ming had stayed in previously. The young men walking on the streets all had powerful auras. Most of them were at the half-Saint level.</p><p>Not long after, Huang Ling brought Lu Ming to a huge Palace.</p><p>Above the palace, the words ‘Phoenix Palace’ were written in large and magnificent characters.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m from the Emperor-level force, the Phoenix Palace. This is the Phoenix Palace’s temporary base in the hundred clan battlefield …”</p><p>Huang Ling explained.</p><p>The hundred clan battlefield was a training ground for the geniuses of many Emperor-ranked forces. Therefore, many powerful Emperor-ranked forces would buy palaces in the huge city of the hundred clan battlefield as a temporary stop.</p><p>After all, he had been training outside and fighting against experts. He would be tired and would need a place to rest and go into seclusion.</p><p>“Holy maiden!”</p><p>As soon as she entered the palace, a young man and a young woman bowed to her.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. It seemed that Huang Ling had a high status in the Phoenix Palace. She was the Saint.</p><p>Huang Ling nodded and led Lu Ming into the depths of the Phoenix Palace.</p><p>On the way, they met no less than 20 young men and women. These young men and women were handsome and beautiful. Each of them was a half-Saint and had superior earth spiritual body.</p><p>Like the Dragon God Valley, almost all the people in the Phoenix Palace had awakened the Phoenix bloodline and cultivated the Phoenix combat body.</p><p>so many geniuses. It seems like Phoenix Palace is a terrifying existence even among Emperor-level forces!</p><p>Along the way, Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>They had encountered so many heaven’s favorites on their way here. Any one of them would be a top heaven’s favorite in Cangzhou. Some of them had unfathomable auras and were surrounded by laws. They were obviously experts in the second stage of half-Saint.</p><p>Even a half-Saint with a body of laws could compete with the top ten geniuses in the Azure continent.</p><p>This was probably only the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>One should know that no one above the Saint realm could enter the hundred clan battlefield. How could the Phoenix Palace not have any geniuses above the Saint realm?</p><p>Definitely!</p><p>the yuan continent is huge and there are too many heaven’s favorites. The Cang region is just a small place!</p><p>Many thoughts flashed past Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>Now, his thoughts were slowly changing. His vision was no longer limited to the Azure continent.</p><p>The deity would eventually become his stepping stone. His opponents would be the Supreme talents of the Emperor-level forces in the yuan continent.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with a strong desire to fight. He felt his blood boiling.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you can stay here temporarily!” He said.</p><p>Bi Ling said as they arrived in front of a courtyard.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>during this period, I will send people to dark water city to inquire about the news of the tomb of the Samsara King. If there are other maps of the tomb, the appearance of the key will definitely be exposed. I will inform you as soon as I have news!</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>it seems that I was right to cooperate with you. It can save me a lot of trouble!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Then how are you going to repay me?”</p><p>Huang Ling smiled and looked at Lu Ming with a flirtatious expression.</p><p>Such a devastatingly beautiful woman had said such ambiguous words. Even with Lu Ming’s composure, his heart could not help but jump.</p><p>“Didn’t I say that you and I are a Dragon and a Phoenix? why don’t we just have sex?”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“F * ck, is this how you repay me? Wouldn’t that be too easy on you?”</p><p>Huang Ling rolled her eyes at Lu Ming and left the place with light steps.</p><p>Lu Ming laughed, pushed open the courtyard door, and walked in.</p><p>The courtyard was huge. Lu Ming walked into one of the rooms and entered the mountain and river diagram. He sat cross-legged under the path-understanding ancient tree and started to think quietly.</p><p>the geniuses of the various monarch-level forces are gathered in the dark water city. Although there aren’t many people like Huang Ling, there are still many of them. Who knows, there might be geniuses even stronger than her!</p><p>if the tomb of the reincarnation King opens, the people who enter will be the strongest. I’m still not strong enough!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>Right now, with his main body and secondary body working together, he could suppress someone like Wan Tiancheng. Together with bubbles, they could catch him off guard and kill him. However, if Lu Ming’s main body was alone, he was still not a match for such a person. He was still a little lacking.</p><p>He had to improve his strength as soon as possible.</p><p>Now, he had two main ways to improve his strength. One was to improve his cultivation. Once his cultivation improved, his strength would naturally soar.</p><p>The second was the breakthrough of the chaos sky-turning seal. He had already cultivated the chaos sky-turning seal to the peak of the fourth level. Once he broke through the fifth level, the power of the sky-turning seal would be even stronger, and he would be able to use it more easily.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
