If I were you, I would automatically get out of the fighting stage and not participate!”</p><p>Silver pine shouted and continued to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>...</p><p>He wanted Lu Ming to be unable to participate in the treasure sealing assembly and lose all his face. Then, he would be killed by the divine Son.</p><p>Moreover, it could suppress Lu Ming and boost his reputation.</p><p>He, Yin yinsong, was a heaven’s pride expert who had just risen. Three years ago, his cultivation was only at the peak of the ninth level martial Royal realm. He could not shine and could not be compared with the top geniuses.</p><p>But now, his cultivation had reached the second stage of half-Saint and he had comprehended the laws.</p><p>Moreover, he also had a superior-grade earth spiritual body and powerful combat strength. Now in Dragon God Valley, his combat strength was second only to Zi Feng, one of the ten great monstrous talents.</p><p>He was full of ambition and was determined to surpass Zi Feng and become the new top ten geniuses. Before that, he had to constantly establish his own prestige. Lu Ming, who was currently famous, was undoubtedly a very good choice.</p><p>“So you’re saying that your participation in the treasure fixing assembly is very useful?”</p><p>Lu Ming replied indifferently.</p><p>“Nonsense, who in Dragon God Valley doesn’t know my combat power? If I participate in the treasure fixing assembly, I will definitely help Dragon God Valley achieve great things!”</p><p>Silver pine said proudly.</p><p>“You? Trash? He really knows how to put gold on his face!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“What did you just say?”</p><p>Yin Zisong was furious and his face was extremely gloomy. He rolled his eyes and came up with a plan, ” “Lu Ming, I challenge you now. If you can withstand ten moves from me and not lose, I’ll admit that you’re capable and you’ll be eligible to participate in the treasure sealing assembly. How about it?”</p><p>“Ten moves?”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled up slightly.</p><p>“What’s wrong? You don’t dare to?”</p><p>Yin Zisong sneered, then cupped his fists to the hosting elder and said, ” “Elder, is this battle alright?”</p><p>“If Lu Ming agrees to it, sure!”</p><p>The hosting elder said.</p><p>Everyone’s gaze was on Lu Ming.</p><p>Did Lu Ming dare to accept the challenge from Yin Zisong?</p><p>Currently, Yin Zisong was the second strongest person among the younger generation in Dragon God Valley, second only to Zi Feng.</p><p>If he did not have the cultivation of the second stage of half-Saint, it would not be easy to take 10 moves from silver pine.</p><p>“Alright, you can make your move!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly. His expression was calm, and no one could tell what he was thinking.</p><p>In his seat, the master of Silver Dragon Valley was delighted. He sent a message to Yin Zisong, ” Zisong, this is an opportunity. Seize it and cripple Lu Ming!</p><p>Yin taisong nodded in agreement, a sharp glint flashing in his eyes.</p><p>Junior Brother, you have to be careful. Yin yinsong’s cultivation has already reached the second stage of the half-Saint realm. His spiritual body is a superior earth spiritual body …</p><p>Xue ningxin quickly sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming secretly, warning him to be careful.</p><p>Lu Ming flashed a reassuring smile at Tian Chui and Xue ningxin.</p><p>“Hmph, this guy wants to challenge master. He’ll definitely be beaten down by master. Master is the strongest!”</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang said from the side of Longyuan mountain.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In the fighting ring, silver pine stepped out. The cultivation of the second stage of the half-Saint realm was undoubtedly revealed. There were laws surrounding him, and his aura was threatening.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you really overestimate yourself. Three years ago, your cultivation was only at the fourth level of the Martial Emperor realm. Now, no matter how fast you improve, what realm can you reach? kneel down!”</p><p>Yin Zifeng sneered and strode forward, sending a palm strike towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kneel down!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly shouted. The divine sword technique in his eyes shot out and pierced into the silver pine’s body.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Silver pine let out an extremely shrill scream. Its eyes were protruding out, and its face was twisted together as if it was suffering unbearable pain.</p><p>His soul was almost torn apart by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kneel down!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted again and took a step forward.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s Saint realm soul power went berserk and frantically pressed down on the silver.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming seemed to have transformed into a God in front of silver pine. He was a hundred thousand feet tall and stood between the sky and earth. With a single thought, the sky collapsed and the earth cracked, and millions of corpses fell.</p><p>At this moment, silver pine’s liver and guts were torn apart. With a plop, he directly knelt down.</p><p>Seeing this, everyone was dumbfounded. Their eyes almost popped out of their sockets. They couldn’t believe what they were seeing.</p><p>Silver pine actually knelt in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>Moreover, the two of them did not fight at all. There was no explosive scene. They only heard Lu Ming shout ‘get down’ twice and then, Yin Zisong knelt down.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>Previously, Yin yinsong had been insufferably arrogant and had looked down on Lu Ming. He had said that if Lu Ming could withstand ten moves from him, he would acknowledge Lu Ming’s strength and be able to participate in the treasure fixing assembly.</p><p>But now?</p><p>He had not even made a move and he was already kneeling in front of Lu Ming. What was this?</p><p>“Lu Ming, what demonic art did you use?”</p><p>The master of Silver Dragon Valley roared from his seat. He found it hard to believe.</p><p>The most outstanding talent of the silver Dragon Valley was kneeling in front of Lu Ming just because of Lu Ming’s two shouts.</p><p>“Yao Arts? It’s ridiculous that you’re the master of a Valley and a great sage, but you actually said the word “demonic technique”!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered in response.</p><p>There were thousands of secret skills on the path of martial arts. The master of Silver Dragon Valley said the word ” demonic skill ” as if he was an ordinary person who had not cultivated it. How ridiculous was that?</p><p>The master of Silver Dragon Valley widened his eyes in anger, but he couldn’t refute.</p><p>“You can’t even tell with your soul power?”</p><p>Longyuan Shan spoke.</p><p>“This old master can naturally see it, there’s no need for you to say it!”</p><p>The master of Silver Dragon Valley said coldly.</p><p>Naturally, they could tell that Lu Ming was using his soul force. He had only said the word demonic art in a moment of desperation.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s soul force was too strong. It made them apprehensive.</p><p>how did this kid’s soul power reach such a level? it’s comparable to a Saint!</p><p>&Nbsp; ” damn it! the master of Silver Dragon Valley roared in his heart.</p><p>He hated Lu Ming to the core. He could not control the anger in his heart when he was facing Lu Ming. Otherwise, as the valley master, he would not be in such a pathetic state.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>On the fighting ring, Lu Ming retracted his soul force. Silver pine felt his soul become lighter, and he panted heavily as if he had collapsed.</p><p>Then, he came to his senses. He was kneeling in front of Lu Ming. Everyone’s eyes were on him.</p><p>Some were disdainful, some were disdainful, and some were sarcastic …</p><p>“Ah, damn it, damn it, how could this be?”</p><p>Silver pine’s eyes were red and he was screaming madly in his heart. He was actually kneeling in front of Lu Ming. Just now, it was as if his soul had been torn apart and he had no idea what he had done.</p><p>“You’re really a piece of trash!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>“Lu Ming … You …”</p><p>Silver pine shouted. He was so angry that he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>nest, you’re so powerful. You actually spurted blood on your own. I’ve really learned something today!</p><p>Tian Chui gloated, adding insult to injury, causing Yin Zisong to spit out another mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The master of Silver Dragon Valley couldn’t stand it anymore. He waved his sleeve and left.</p><p>Today, he had lost all his face. He was afraid that if he stayed any longer, he would be like a silver pine and vomit blood from anger.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
