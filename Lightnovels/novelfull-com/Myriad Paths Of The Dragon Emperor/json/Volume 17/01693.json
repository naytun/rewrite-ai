Where did the arrogant aura that you had when you said you wanted to kill me go? ”</p><p>Mo Yang’s face turned red, and he wished he could find a hole to hide in.</p><p>He lowered his head and returned to the stands without saying anything.</p><p>Now, the more he spoke, the more he would only humiliate himself.</p><p>He was filled with hatred but he did not have the courage to fight Lu Ming to the death.</p><p>ninth Junior Brother, I’ve already expected this outcome. He’s just a coward who bullies the weak and fears the strong!</p><p>Tian Chui said.</p><p>that’s right. The words of this kind of person are like farts!</p><p>Xue ningxin said.</p><p>Squeak …</p><p>Mo Yang gritted his teeth so hard that he almost broke them.</p><p>Lu Ming, I’ll let you be arrogant for a while. You’ll still die at the hands of the divine Son later. I’ll bear with you for now. In the future, I’ll kill all these people from Dragon God Valley!</p><p>Mo Yang roared in his heart.</p><p>The competition continued.</p><p>There was no longer any suspense in the rest of the competition. Anyone who encountered Lu Ming would admit defeat immediately, including those from the top ten geniuses.</p><p>haha, Junior Brother Lu Ming, I admit defeat. I’m not your match!</p><p>Later on, Zi Feng also encountered Lu Ming and directly admitted defeat.</p><p>Lu Ming ran into Luo Xiang at the back.</p><p>Lu Ming had thought that Luo Xiang would fight him. He did not expect Luo Xiang to shake his head and say,”Lu Ming, let’s spar if we have the chance in the future. I’m not your match now!”</p><p>With that, he directly left the fighting ring.</p><p>In this way, Lu Ming swept away all his opponents.</p><p>“All the matches of this time’s treasure sealing assembly have ended!”</p><p>When po yuangui made the announcement, the Dragon God Valley cheered.</p><p>When Dragon God Valley won, there was no need to calculate the score. They all knew that Dragon God Valley had won.</p><p>Lu Ming had defeated everyone alone. With the ten points he had earned, there was no doubt.</p><p>Dragon God Valley has won first place in this treasure auction. The two ancient treasures will be kept by Dragon God Valley. We will compete for them in three years!</p><p>Po yuangui announced.</p><p>“Hahaha, now, give me the two treasures!”</p><p>The master of purple dragon Valley stood up and looked at the Supreme Saint of the deity sect.</p><p>The Supreme Saint of the heavenly God sect was extremely unwilling and his face turned ugly.</p><p>He had brought the two treasures with him, but he had never thought of handing them over. This was because with the lineup of the heavenly God sect, it was certain that they would obtain the first place this time.</p><p>He had never expected that the boy, who was at the LV 4 martial Royal realm and boasted shamelessly about challenging the deity three years ago, would be so powerful. He had killed Luo shuihan and defeated the others, helping Dragon God Valley to win the first place.</p><p>Now, he had no choice but to hand it over.</p><p>“Damned little bastard, you’re dying but you still won’t die in peace!”</p><p>The great sage of the heavenly God sect roared in his heart.</p><p>In his opinion, Lu Ming would definitely be killed by the divine Son. There was no doubt about it. There was no other possibility.</p><p>However, even if Lu Ming was dead, it was an undeniable fact that Dragon God Valley had won first place and controlled two treasures for three years.</p><p>“What’s wrong? You’re dilly-dallying, don’t you want to hand it over?”</p><p>The purple dragon Valley master sneered.</p><p>hand it over then. I don’t think you can figure out anything in three years!</p><p>The great sage of the heavenly God sect said coldly.</p><p>It had been so many years. One of the two treasures was said to contain the secret of becoming a sovereign. However, after so many changes in the sect, no one had managed to figure out the reason. He didn’t believe that Dragon God Valley could figure out anything in just three years.</p><p>He took out a storage ring and threw it to the purple dragon Valley master.</p><p>The master of purple dragon Valley took it and scanned it with his spiritual sense. He smiled.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>He was not particularly interested in the other treasure. What he wanted was the fragment of the prison-suppressing stele.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The sky buzzed as a powerful pressure descended.</p><p>The Son of God stepped into the air and his body bloomed with holy light. His eyes were cold as he stood above the fighting ring and looked down at Lu Ming.</p><p>Many people were shocked. Were the divine Son and Lu Ming going to make a move?</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll give you time to recover!”</p><p>The Son of God said coldly.</p><p>there’s no need to recover. I can fight now!</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept toward the divine Son. He rose into the air and stood opposite the divine Son.</p><p>Without a doubt, at this moment, Lu Ming and the divine Son had become the focus of the scene.</p><p>“Is the war finally about to start?”</p><p>Someone muttered. In fact, many people had come to the treasure sealing assembly specifically to watch the duel between Lu Ming and the divine Son.</p><p>“Do you think Lu Ming can fight the divine Son?”</p><p>it’s very difficult. The divine Son entered the sage realm a year and a half ago, while Lu Ming is only in the half-Saint realm. Moreover, he’s only in the second stage of the half-Saint realm. The difference is too great. It’s impossible to cross over!</p><p>it’s almost impossible for anyone who isn’t a Saint warrior. Moreover, the other party is a Divine Son, stronger than an ordinary Saint. Lu Ming has no hope!</p><p>Many people discussed and some sighed. They felt that Lu Ming could not possibly be a match for the divine Son.</p><p>“Go, master, beat him up!”</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang waved her little fists.</p><p>On Longyuan mountain, yang tianzong, Tian Chui, Xue ningxin and the rest looked on quietly, their eyes revealing a trace of worry.</p><p>The Son of God’s body glowed with holy light, and even his eyes turned into milky white holy light. He said coldly, ” “Lu Ming, although your combat strength is not bad, I’ll let you understand the difference between a non-Saint and a Saint!”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The divine Son stepped forward like the son of a God. Holy light burst forth, and a powerful aura pressed down on Lu Ming. Then, he slapped out a huge holy light palm print.</p><p>Saint power surged and laws circulated. It was terrifying to the extreme.</p><p>“He only used the power of an initial bright Saint? You’re really looking down on me!”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. He did not Dodge but threw a punch.</p><p>Lu Ming’s fist glowed, and the shadow of a stele could be vaguely seen flashing by.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>An earth-shattering boom was heard. The huge holy light palm print was shattered by Lu Ming’s punch.</p><p>Lu Ming dashed past the Holy Light and charged at the divine Son.</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was too terrifying. He had directly destroyed the divine son’s attack and took the initiative to attack the divine Son.</p><p>Could it be that Lu Ming really had the combat strength of a Sage?</p><p>Thinking of this, many people widened their eyes and held their breath, staring at the scene without blinking, afraid of missing the crucial scene.</p><p>The Son of God’s eyes turned cold, and his hands glowed with holy light. They were like two milky-white Saint stones, crystal clear and Holy.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>His palm continued to strike at Lu Ming. It was extremely terrifying as if it could destroy everything.</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm was flowing with chaos laws as he used the prison-suppressing heaven technique. He was fearless as he continued to bombard the area.</p><p>Thump! Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>A dense series of collisions rang out. Lu Ming and the divine Son collided more than a hundred times in an instant. Every time they collided, a dull boom rang out in the sky. The two figures crossed each other like two streams of light. Some of the weaker cultivators could not even see clearly.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The last attack forced the two of them to retreat. However, Lu Ming only took three steps back, while the divine Son took nine steps back.</p><p>The Son of God was at a disadvantage!</p><p>Many people’s hearts trembled, and their eyes were filled with disbelief.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
