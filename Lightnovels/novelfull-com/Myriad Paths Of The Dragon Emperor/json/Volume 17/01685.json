After killing one of the monster beasts, a piece of crystal dropped.</p><p>...</p><p>The crystal was sparkling and translucent, with green energy swirling around it. This was the core of wind.</p><p>The core of the wind had a special mark. It could be seen at a glance whether it was brought out from here.</p><p>“Let’s continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Following that, they continued to search for demonic beasts. Lu Ming cast the nine seals of the divine Gate to seal the demonic beasts, while Tian Chui and Xue ningxin were responsible for killing them. The three of them split the wind cores they obtained equally.</p><p>The demonic beasts here, other than their astonishing speed, were not very strong in combat. Tian Chui and Xue ningxin could easily kill them.</p><p>However, the number of demonic beasts with a wind core was very small. On average, there was only one in ten demonic beasts with a wind core, which greatly increased the difficulty of obtaining it.</p><p>However, with the cooperation of Lu Ming and the other two, they were very fast.</p><p>When they encountered demonic beasts, they did not need to waste any time. Lu Ming had sealed them while Tian Chui and Xue ningxin took action. They could deal with the demonic beasts in an instant.</p><p>Ten minutes later, the three of them had killed hundreds of demonic beasts and obtained thirty wind cores. Each of them had ten.</p><p>Roar! Roar! Roar!</p><p>Roars came from ahead. The three of them perked up and continued forward. Soon, a large group of demonic beasts appeared in front of them.</p><p>They were wind leopards that were even faster than wind wolves.</p><p>This group of wind leopards numbered in the hundreds, and they galloped across the grassland in a mighty formation.</p><p>“So much! Haha, I’m rich!”</p><p>Tian Chui’s eyes lit up as he grinned.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>The group of wind leopards had also discovered Lu Ming and the other two. With a few loud roars, the wind leopards scattered in an uproar. Their speed was shocking, and they flew in all directions like hundreds of lightning bolts.</p><p>There were too many of them. Even if Lu Ming cast the nine seals of the gate of God, he would not be able to seal many.</p><p>“Bubble, I’m counting on you!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>Paopao had already appeared on Lu Ming’s shoulder. With a wave of its claws, the space in front of it rippled like water. Then, all the wind leopards stopped in mid-air, not moving at all.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Tian Chui and Xue ningxin were extremely excited as they charged towards the wind leopards.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he flew up as well. With a wave of his hand, streams of spear radiance shot out and killed the wind leopards one after another.</p><p>The wind leopards in the air were fixed in place and then exploded. In the air, pieces of wind cores appeared, crystal clear and bright.</p><p>In an instant, hundreds of wind leopards were all killed by them, and they obtained dozens of wind cores.</p><p>“Hahaha, cool, this is too cool!”</p><p>Tian Chui was incomparably excited as he swung his huge hammer around.</p><p>Xue ningxin was also smiling.</p><p>Killing wind leopards like this was indeed very cool.</p><p>The two of them glanced at the bubble on Lu Ming’s shoulder and did not say much. They naturally would not probe into Lu Ming’s Secret.</p><p>“Junior Brother, let’s go find a large group of demonic beasts to hunt!”</p><p>Tian Chui’s eyes were sparkling.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Immediately, the three of them flew through the air, specifically choosing to hunt large groups of demonic beasts.</p><p>Usually, when they saw one or two demonic beasts, the three of them wouldn’t stop at all. They would only stop to kill when they saw more than ten demonic beasts.</p><p>There was no lack of demonic beasts in this grassland. Not long after, they encountered another group of demonic beasts. There were more than a hundred of them, and their speed was astonishing.</p><p>With so many demonic beasts, it would be impossible to kill all of them if they were encountered by other people. They could only kill a portion of them. These demonic beasts were too fast. They were fleeing in all directions, so it was difficult to kill all of them.</p><p>However, Lu Ming and the rest were different. Lu Ming had bubbles. Bubbles cast the space-time law and froze the demonic beasts, allowing them to kill them.</p><p>Their efficiency had greatly increased.</p><p>Half an hour was too short, and it passed by very quickly.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two were flying when the space trembled. They felt their bodies tighten. The next moment, they were back at the place where they had just entered. The other disciples of the Dragon God Valley were also there.</p><p>Time’s Up so quickly! I’ve only managed to get a few wind cores!</p><p>“Me too!”</p><p>Some of the Dragon God Valley disciples sighed.</p><p>Some of the unlucky ones didn’t manage to obtain any wind cores after continuously killing demonic beasts. After half an hour, they only managed to obtain a few.</p><p>“Senior brother Zi Feng, how many pieces did you get?”</p><p>Someone asked Zi Feng.</p><p>“I obtained 31 pieces!”</p><p>Zi Feng said. He then looked at Lu Ming.”Junior Brother Lu Ming, how’s your harvest?”</p><p>“Our harvest is not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and said, ” senior brother Zi Feng has obtained more than thirty wind cores. It seems that if you want to enter the top eighty, you don’t need too many wind cores. Twenty is enough. Let’s distribute them!</p><p>“Distribution?”</p><p>The others looked at each other.</p><p>Most of them didn’t even have 20 pieces, so how were they going to distribute them?</p><p>Lu Ming, Tian Chui, and Xue ningxin looked at each other. Then, with a single thought, a huge pile of wind cores appeared in the air.</p><p>The others from Dragon God Valley were stunned.</p><p>All of them were dumbfounded.</p><p>It was too much. Lu Ming and the other two added up to a few hundred pieces.</p><p>“This … So many?”</p><p>Zi Feng was also tongue-tied.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. The three of them had obtained a total of more than two hundred and eighty pieces.</p><p>the three of us will each take thirty pieces. The rest will be distributed to those with higher cultivation so that more people from Dragon God Valley can enter the second round. Senior brother Zi Feng, you can divide it!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>After that, he, Tian Chui, and Xue ningxin each took thirty pieces, leaving behind a hundred and ninety pieces.</p><p>He didn’t need a lot of wind cores, as long as he could enter the second round.</p><p>The key was that more people from Dragon God Valley could enter the second round. The more people who entered, the higher the chance of getting more points in the second round.</p><p>Even one more point could determine the outcome of the battle.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming had to help Dragon God Valley get first place and control the two ancient treasures. Only then would Lu Ming have a chance of getting the fragment of the prison-suppressing stele.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Zi Feng nodded and started to distribute.</p><p>He didn’t assign the cores to those with lower cultivation levels. Instead, he assigned the cores to those with higher cultivation levels. In the end, only five people didn’t get their cores, and these five people had the lowest cultivation levels.</p><p>The others, including the one he had obtained, each had about twenty wind cores.</p><p>According to the number of wind cores that Zi Feng had obtained, twenty pieces should be enough.</p><p>The five of them didn’t complain. They had the lowest cultivation, so even if they entered the second round, it would be difficult for them to get points.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go out!”</p><p>Zi Feng said. Then, everyone flew towards the light door in the sky. The next moment, they appeared in the sky above the fighting stage.</p><p>At the same time, the other sects also walked out of the light door.</p><p>now, take out your cores of wind. One by one, I will record them according to the number. In the end, the eighty people who get the most cores of wind will enter the second round!</p><p>Po yuangui said.</p><p>“Let’s go first!”</p><p>Luo shuihan said and stepped out first, followed by the other disciples of the tianshen sect.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
