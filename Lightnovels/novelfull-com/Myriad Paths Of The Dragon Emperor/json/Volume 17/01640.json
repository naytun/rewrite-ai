His eyes were serious as he cupped his fist towards the old woman.</p><p>The old woman revealed a faint smile and glanced at the tenth golden Crow Prince, ” “The bridge of helplessness on the yellow spring River. I’m naturally Meng Po!”</p><p>“Is she really Meng Po?”</p><p>Many people’s hearts trembled.</p><p>This was the tomb of the reincarnation King. Why would there be the netherworld bridge of helplessness and Meng Po?</p><p>Did this place really lead to hell?</p><p>“Senior, is that reincarnation?”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly asked.</p><p>This was because there was no path in front of the bridge of helplessness, only a pitch-black Vortex.</p><p>that’s right. That’s Samsara. You can enter Samsara after you drink grandma Meng’s soup and forget about your past and present lives!</p><p>Said Meng Po as she lifted the bowl in her hand.</p><p>reincarnation! Reincarnation! The tomb of the reincarnation Emperor is right in front of us!</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>“That’s right!” Meng Po smiled.</p><p>hahaha, it’s indeed the tomb of the Samsara King. The netherworld is all fake. I’m going to meditate in the tomb of the Samsara King!</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince laughed and strode forward.</p><p>But Meng Po stood in front of him. young man, ” she said. if you want to enter Samsara, you must drink Meng PO’s soup. Forget your past life and this life. Only then can you enter Samsara!</p><p>“Get lost, no one can make me forget my past and present life!”</p><p>The Golden Crow tenth Prince was extremely domineering. He struck out with his palm, and the terrifying godly Sunfire rushed toward Meng Po.</p><p>However, Meng Po waved her hand and the Golden Crow tenth Prince’s fire was extinguished.</p><p>The Golden Crow tenth Prince’s eyes narrowed and he transformed into his three-legged golden Crow form. His body was covered in terrifying flames, like a sun. He flapped his wings and wanted to rush past Meng Po and enter the dark vortex.</p><p>“The young man is too impulsive!”</p><p>Meng Po murmured. She reached out a withered hand and grabbed at the tenth golden Crow Prince.</p><p>The dried-up claw quickly grew in size, becoming as large as a mountain as it struck towards the tenth golden Crow Prince.</p><p>The Golden Crow tenth Prince seemed to have been frozen in place, unable to move at all as he was caught by the withered hand.</p><p>damn it, attack! Let’s attack together and rush over!</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince roared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A figure rushed forward at extreme speed, wanting to take this opportunity to rush over.</p><p>He was also a terrifying young man, no weaker than the tenth Crown Prince of the Golden Crow.</p><p>However, a silk ribbon flew out of Meng PO’s sleeve and wrapped around the young man.</p><p>The others were shocked. They had wanted to take the opportunity to attack, but they couldn’t help but stop.</p><p>The other party was too terrifying. Even someone as powerful as the Golden Crow tenth Prince couldn’t put up any resistance and was captured right away. The other person was the same.</p><p>The two of them struggled with all their might, but it was of no use.</p><p>“Senior, spare me, spare me!”</p><p>The Golden Crow tenth Prince was scared and began to beg for mercy.</p><p>“What are you afraid of? I won’t kill you!”</p><p>Meng Po opened her mouth and grabbed the Golden Crow tenth Prince in front of her. Then, she poured the bowl of Meng Po soup into the Golden Crow tenth Prince’s mouth.</p><p>“Don’t …”</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince roared. If he would forget everything after drinking grandma Meng’s soup, would he still be himself? Wouldn’t that be the same as death? How could he be willing to drink it?</p><p>However, his struggles were of no use.</p><p>His mouth opened on its own, and a bowl of Meng Po soup was poured into the Golden Crow tenth Prince’s mouth. Then, his eyes revealed a look of confusion.</p><p>“Go, enter the cycle of reincarnation!”</p><p>Meng Po waved her hand, and the Golden Crow tenth Prince flew directly into the black Vortex and disappeared.</p><p>Then, everyone saw that the bowl of Meng PO’s soup in Meng PO’s hand, which was originally empty, was now automatically filled up.</p><p>Meng Po did the same thing. She poured a bowl of Meng PO’s soup into another young man’s mouth and then threw him into the dark vortex.</p><p>now, it’s your turn. Come, drink grandma Meng’s soup and enter the cycle of reincarnation!</p><p>Meng Po looked at Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Many people broke out in cold sweat.</p><p>“Senior, I won’t go to the tomb of the reincarnation King. I’m leaving!”</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>If he lost all his memories after drinking grandma Meng’s soup, what was the point of receiving the inheritance of the reincarnation Emperor?</p><p>“Since you’re here, there’s no reason to retreat. All of you will drink Meng PO’s soup and enter the cycle of reincarnation!”</p><p>Meng PO’s shriveled voice sounded.</p><p>“No, I’m not going, I quit!”</p><p>A few people shouted and retreated like lightning.</p><p>“I said, since you’re here, you can’t leave!”</p><p>Meng Po said indifferently. She reached out her hand and grabbed in the air. The people who were retreating seemed to be fixed in place. Their bodies were fixed in the air, and then they flew toward Meng Po under the effect of a powerful force.</p><p>Just like before, Meng Po drank a bowl of Meng Po soup and threw it all into the black Vortex.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what should we do?”</p><p>Huang Ling sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming. Her pretty face was a little pale.</p><p>this Meng Po is too strong. We can’t resist her at all!</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head.</p><p>The Golden Crow tenth Prince and the others were like babies in Meng PO’s hands. They could not fight back at all. Meng PO’s strength was definitely beyond their imagination. They had no chance at all.</p><p>Even if Lu Ming went all out with bubbles ‘help, he would not have any chance of escaping. The difference was too great.</p><p>“Are we really going to drink grandma Meng’s soup and forget about our past and present lives?”</p><p>Said Huang Ling, revealing an unwilling expression.</p><p>Huang Ling, do you believe that this is the true netherworld, Meng Po? ”</p><p>Lu Ming did not answer but asked Huang Ling instead.</p><p>Huang Ling was stunned and pondered, ” what the netherworld can do to Meng Po is just a legend. It’s in the nine Serenities hell. Legend has it that the nine Serenities hell is in the heaven realm!</p><p>“Heaven realm?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He did not think much about it and said, that’s right. That’s why I feel that this place is man-made. Perhaps it’s just a test and they might not really lose their memories. So, we can only take a gamble!</p><p>“Take a gamble?”</p><p>that’s right. Since I can’t escape, I’ll take a gamble. I’ll be leaving first!</p><p>With that, Lu Ming stepped out and strode toward Meng Po.</p><p>Many people were shocked. Lu Ming actually took the initiative to step forward?</p><p>“Little fellow, please!”</p><p>Mengpo picked up the soup in her hand.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming was very direct. He picked up the bowl of mengpo’s soup and drank it in one gulp. Then, he returned the bowl to mengpo and leaped into the dark vortex.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>Then, a burly young man walked out. It was ye Dongfang.</p><p>Obviously, Lu Ming was not the only bold person.</p><p>Like Lu Ming, ye Dongfang drank the mengpo soup and jumped into the vortex.</p><p>After that, Huang Ling stepped out and drank the soup before jumping into the whirlpool.</p><p>The others ‘expressions changed, but they also understood that there was no way out today. They could only drink grandma Meng’s soup and then step forward one by one.</p><p>Not long after, all the elites who had entered had jumped into the black Vortex.</p><p>After everyone had jumped into the black Vortex, Meng PO’s body on the bridge of helplessness disappeared like an illusion, as if she had never been there.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
