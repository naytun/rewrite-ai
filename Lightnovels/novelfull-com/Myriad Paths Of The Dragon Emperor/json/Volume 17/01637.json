Some were in the form of demonic beasts, while others were in the form of humans.</p><p>Some of them were wearing armor and holding swords and sabers, but they had one thing in common, which was that their bodies were filled with a strong aura of death.</p><p>“It’s the undead!”</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>“Kill, kill these humans!”</p><p>An undead, who was wearing armor and holding a sword, waved his sword like a Dark Warrior and gave orders.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Kill!</p><p>A large number of undead rushed towards Lu Ming and the rest. There were at least a thousand of them and they were all at the seventh level Martial Emperor realm or above.</p><p>All sorts of attacks were launched at Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince transformed into a three-legged golden Crow. The fire of the sun burned fiercely. As he rushed past, a dozen undead were turned into ashes in the flames.</p><p>Wild Thunder ye Dongfang clenched his fist in the air, and the sky was filled with lightning. Every lightning bolt that swept across would kill an undead.</p><p>The Taotie returned to its original form and roared. A beam of destructive light shot out of its mouth and a large number of undead were destroyed.</p><p>When such a Paragon attacked, it was earth-shattering and shocking. Large numbers of undead were annihilated.</p><p>At the same time, the others attacked one after another. All kinds of attacks were launched, killing the undead one by one.</p><p>However, there were too many undead, and they kept rushing out from the ground.</p><p>Moreover, he was getting stronger and stronger.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A giant white bone took the shape of a Tiger. With a loud roar, the space trembled as it pounced towards the tenth golden Crow Prince.</p><p>The White-boned Tiger exuded the aura of the third stage of the half-Saint realm. It was extremely powerful.</p><p>However, he was still defeated by the tenth golden Crow Prince in one move.</p><p>In a battle of the same level, a heavenly spiritual body could easily kill other non-heavenly spiritual bodies in seconds.</p><p>Undead kept rushing out from the ground. Many of them were at the half-Saint level, but they still couldn’t stop them. They kept pushing toward the majestic mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming punched out continuously. The force of his fist crossed the void and killed two undead at the second stage of the half-Saint realm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Right at this moment, an extremely terrifying aura burst forth from the ground. A figure wearing ancient battle armor and holding a long spear appeared in the sky.</p><p>Saint realm undead!</p><p>Many people’s expressions changed.</p><p>This undead wearing ancient armor and holding a spear was a Saint realm undead, and terrifying saintly might emanated from his body.</p><p>“So what if you’re a Saint? I’ll still be beheaded!”</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince spoke in an extremely domineering manner.</p><p>With their combat strength, they were not afraid of ordinary Saint realm cultivators.</p><p>However, the Saint undead did not attack. Instead, he glanced at Lu Ming and the others coldly and said in a shriveled voice, ” “Retreat!”</p><p>Then, the undead that had been attacking crazily retreated like a tide. They sank into the ground and disappeared.</p><p>His Saint undead also sank into the ground and disappeared.</p><p>“He retreated?”</p><p>Someone was stunned.</p><p>a Saint realm expert will only be killed if he doesn’t retreat. Naturally, he has to retreat!</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince spoke with great confidence.</p><p>The group continued forward. Following that, there were no accidents and no one stopped them. They arrived in front of the mountain.</p><p>The mountain was pitch-black and surrounded by a deathly aura. Not a blade of grass grew on it.</p><p>“Is this the tomb of the reincarnation King? I’ve been here before, but I didn’t find anything unusual!”</p><p>Ye Dongfang frowned.</p><p>This mountain looked like an ordinary mountain. There was nothing unusual about it, and there was no entrance.</p><p>After that, they flew around the mountain but did not find any entrance.</p><p>Everyone frowned. Was the tomb of the reincarnation King fake?</p><p>“Let’s take a look at the key to the tomb of the reincarnation King. What do you think?”</p><p>Someone suggested.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The others nodded and took out the key to the tomb of the reincarnation King.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>When everyone took out their keys, a shocking scene appeared. The ten Keys trembled and emitted a brilliant radiance. They left everyone’s hands and continued to fly towards the mountain.</p><p>Then, they floated on the top of the mountain and rapidly grew in size. Each of them was a hundred thousand feet in size.</p><p>Then, the ten Keys actually fused together and turned into a heaven raising halberd.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The mighty heaven battle halberd was swung down at the mountain.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>As the halberd struck down, the towering mountain split into two, revealing a deep valley in the middle, like a passage.</p><p>The halberd flew into the depths of the canyon and disappeared.</p><p>is this the passage to the tomb of the reincarnation King? ”</p><p>Some people’s eyes lit up.</p><p>it must be. Haha, the tomb of the reincarnation King has finally appeared!</p><p>Some people laughed.</p><p>However, the next moment, the scene suddenly became silent. Everyone’s figures flashed, and they pulled away from the others, revealing a guarded look.</p><p>Now that the tomb of the reincarnation King had appeared, they would become competitors. Naturally, they had to be wary of each other.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>The Golden Crow tenth Prince laughed coldly and took to the air, flying toward the valley.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The others quickly flew toward the canyon.</p><p>However, when they reached the canyon, their eyes narrowed.</p><p>The towering mountain was split in half. Logically speaking, the opposite side of the canyon was also the other side of the mountain. However, in reality, it was not.</p><p>In the depths of the canyon, there was a passageway that directly passed through space and led to an unknown place.</p><p>Everyone came to the entrance of the tunnel, and the tenth golden Crow Prince was still the first to step in. When he stepped in, his expression changed slightly, but he continued walking forward.</p><p>The others also entered the tunnel.</p><p>what a heavy pressure! There’s a no-fly zone here, so it’s hard to fly!</p><p>As soon as they entered the passage, someone said solemnly.</p><p>Lu Ming and Huang Ling also stepped into the passage. Instantly, they felt a strong pressure on their bodies.</p><p>This pressure was as heavy as a mountain. It was impossible to fly here, and one could only move forward step by step.</p><p>Everyone was on guard against each other as they walked forward step by step.</p><p>It was as if they had stepped into a spatial passageway, and their surroundings were a vast expanse of white. They had no idea where they were.</p><p>They walked forward step by step.</p><p>However, half an hour, one hour, two hours had passed, and they were still in the passage. Looking ahead, the passage seemed to have no end.</p><p>“How can it be so long? when will we reach the end?”</p><p>“Is there really the tomb of the reincarnation King ahead?”</p><p>“No matter what, I’m going to walk to the end!”</p><p>The group continued to move forward.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
