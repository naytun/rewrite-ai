After all, if he did not admit defeat, Luo shuihan would not let him go.</p><p>“Have we finally arrived? You’ve come earlier than I expected. That’s good. Now that I’ve dealt with Luo shuihan, I don’t have to hide my strength anymore!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>He had been hiding his strength to wait for Luo shuihan.</p><p>Otherwise, Lu Ming could easily kill these so-called geniuses with one punch.</p><p>But in that case, Luo shuihan would not dare to fight with him and would admit defeat directly.</p><p>“Hahaha, I’ve finally met Lu Ming!”</p><p>Luo shuihan was overjoyed.</p><p>“Senior brother Luo, you must kill Lu Ming and avenge senior brother Lu Yuan!”</p><p>I don’t think there’s any hope. Lu Ming will be scared witless when he meets senior brother Luo. He won’t have the courage to fight. He’ll definitely admit defeat at the first moment!</p><p>“You’re right. After all, being a coward is better than being killed!”</p><p>The disciples of the heavenly God sect spoke one after another. Their voices were very loud and spread throughout the entire place.</p><p>“Junior Brother, don’t fall for their goading!”</p><p>Zi Feng’s expression changed as he said.</p><p>The people of the heavenly God sect were clearly saying this for Lu Ming to hear. They were afraid that Lu Ming would admit defeat directly.</p><p>“Senior brother, don’t worry!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and stepped into the fighting ring. Luo shuihan did the same.</p><p>Lu Ming, you should just admit defeat. If you don’t, you’ll only die!</p><p>Luo shuihan said coldly, her eyes full of disdain.</p><p>Luo shuihan, you don’t have to use such a lowly method to goad me. But I’ll do as you wish and won’t surrender!</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Luo shuihan’s eyes flashed with joy.</p><p>The others were also shocked. Lu Ming did not surrender. Was he going to fight with Luo shuihan? Could he save his life in the hands of Luo shuihan?</p><p>Some people from Dragon God Valley looked worried.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I believe that this is more than your combat strength!”</p><p>In the area of the life and death Sword sect, Luo Xiang was carrying a long sword on his back. His whole body was like an extremely sharp battle sword as he stood there and muttered.</p><p>“Begin!”</p><p>At this moment, po yuangui’s voice was heard.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>As soon as po yuangui finished his words, Luo shuihan shouted. Holy light burst out and a holy weapon spear appeared in her hand. She jumped high and then stabbed at Lu Ming.</p><p>The long spear pierced through the air at an extremely fast speed. In an instant, it was in front of Lu Ming and was aimed at his heart.</p><p>Luo shuihan would not have stabbed Lu Ming’s dantian at the beginning. If she did, his spiritual God would be destroyed and Lu Ming would be dead.</p><p>Luo shuihan would not kill Lu Ming so easily. She wanted Lu Ming to suffer and die in despair. Only then could she vent her hatred.</p><p>Seeing that the long spear was about to pierce through Lu Ming’s heart, many people’s hearts were in their throats.</p><p>Lu Ming, why aren’t you dodging?</p><p>Could it be that Luo shuihan was so fast and powerful that she had locked onto Lu Ming and made it difficult for him to Dodge?</p><p>Many people had the same thought.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming made his move. He stretched out his hand and grabbed the Spear’s tip. Many people did not even see how Lu Ming did it.</p><p>Then, Luo shuihan’s spear stopped in the air, only a hair’s breadth away from Lu Ming’s chest.</p><p>However, he couldn’t pierce through it.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Luo shuihan shouted. Holy light burst out and laws circulated. She gathered all her strength and poured it into the spear. The spear shone and stabbed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>However, it did not move at all. The long spear did not move at all. Lu Ming’s hand was like the hand of a God, unmoving like a mountain.</p><p>“How is that possible? How is that possible?”</p><p>Luo shuihan’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets. She was screaming in her heart. It was unbelievable. She thought she was dreaming.</p><p>He had used all his strength to launch an attack, but Lu Ming had managed to grab hold of it with one hand. He could not move at all.</p><p>At this moment, the other people present were also dumbfounded.</p><p>What was Luo shuihan doing? Why was it fixed there?</p><p>“You, is this all you have? What a disappointment!”</p><p>Lu Ming stared into Luo shuihan’s eyes and said indifferently.</p><p>Looking at Lu Ming’s eyes, Luo shuihan’s heart trembled and a chill ran through her body.</p><p>At this moment, he knew that Lu Ming had been hiding his combat strength. Lu Ming’s actual combat strength was simply abnormal. He was not his match at all.</p><p>“Retreat, retreat, retreat!”</p><p>At this moment, there was only one word in Luo shuihan’s heart.</p><p>However, it was too late.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The long spear in his hand buzzed. A terrifying force flowed from Lu Ming’s hand along the long spear and into his body. His body trembled and he spat out a mouthful of blood. His body flew backward like a kite with a broken string.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming held Luo shuihan’s spear, turned the spearhead, and caught up with her. He thrust the spear, piercing through her heart and nailing her to the fighting ring.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>ah! Luo shuihan screamed. Her body twisted violently and she spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Although the heart was a vital point, Luo shuihan’s spirit body would not die in a short time. As long as she was treated well, she would recover soon.</p><p>At this moment, the entire place was silent. Everyone’s eyes were wide open as they looked at this scene in disbelief.</p><p>Luo shuihan was nailed to the fighting ring by her own spear.</p><p>How did this happen?</p><p>In Lu Ming’s hands, Luo shuihan was as weak as a baby.</p><p>He was the number one genius in Cangzhou. Although he was referring to the number one genius below the sage state, it was still shocking enough. However, in Lu Ming’s hands, he was simply trash.</p><p>At this moment, they all knew that Lu Ming must have been hiding his strength.</p><p>He was waiting for Luo shuihan, deliberately hiding his strength to wait for her.</p><p>Many people had the same thought.</p><p>It was ridiculous that the people of the tianshen sect and Luo shuihan herself had goaded Lu Ming not to admit defeat. It was ridiculous. It was probably what Lu Ming wanted.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, in the stands of the Tian Shen sect, one figure after another suddenly stood up, and a shocking aura burst out from their bodies.</p><p>They were all experts of the Saint realm. Their hearts trembled, and it was difficult for them to calm down.</p><p>Luo shuihan was defeated?</p><p>At that moment, the Son of God’s expression finally changed. His eyes were filled with holy light and sharp.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let me go!”</p><p>Luo shuihan shouted.</p><p>“Let go of you, what a joke!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s vital essence condensed into a knife and cut down. One of Luo shuihan’s arms flew out, making her scream in pain.</p><p>I’ll return the favor to you for treating my Dragon God Valley disciples so badly!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. His essential core was like a blade, slashing down again.</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere, and Luo shuihan’s other arm also flew out.</p><p>“No, Lu Ming, don’t kill me. Spare me!”</p><p>Luo shuihan was finally scared and started to beg for mercy.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
