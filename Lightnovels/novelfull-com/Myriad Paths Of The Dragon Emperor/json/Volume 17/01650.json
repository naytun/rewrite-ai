There were also a few other heaven’s favorites who were slightly weaker.</p><p>In this way, they added up to more than a dozen people.</p><p>For example, there were four people at the level of ye Dongfang and Huang Ling.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what is your plan?”</p><p>Huang Ling could not help but ask Lu Ming.</p><p>I have a technique that can change my aura. I’ll disguise myself as a native and approach the top of the mountain. Then, you guys pretend to attack and attract some experts. I’ll rush in and save those who need to be saved. Then, we’ll break out of the siege together!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Are you sure no one can recognize your aura-changing technique?”</p><p>Some people were skeptical.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He activated the illusionary breath technique and the aura on his body changed to be exactly the same as that person.</p><p>The expressions of the people present changed drastically.</p><p>There was actually such a mystical secret technique.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. The illusionary breathing technique that he had obtained in the divine wilderness continent back then was indeed amazing. Even now, it was still very useful.</p><p>as long as his cultivation level doesn’t exceed mine by too much, he won’t be able to sense it. It shouldn’t be a problem to hide from a few bright sages for a short time!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright, let’s do that!”</p><p>Ye Dongfang waved his hand, and a hint of fighting intent appeared in his eyes.</p><p>The others agreed one after another. This method was better than directly attacking.</p><p>wait for me in the distance. When I’m close to the peak, I’ll send a message to Feng Ling. That’s the time to attack!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The others nodded in succession. Then, Lu Ming landed on the ground. The chaos Domain transformed into the earth domain. Lu Ming’s body sank into the ground and disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming shuttled through the ground, completely concealing his aura as he headed for the Union mountain.</p><p>As Lu Ming approached the Union mountain, he picked a local who was at the ninth level martial Royal realm and killed him in an instant. Then, Lu Ming changed his clothes and changed his appearance rapidly. In the end, he looked exactly the same as the other person, even his aura.</p><p>After throwing the corpse into a cave, Lu Ming swaggered to the peak.</p><p>Naturally, there were no obstacles along the way. Very soon, Lu Ming arrived at the top of the mountain.</p><p>In front of him, a huge blood-red Tiger suddenly opened its eyes. Its lightning-like gaze fell on Lu Ming, as if it wanted to see through him.</p><p>The blood-red Tiger was one of the four Saints who were guarding the mountain.</p><p>“What are you doing here?”</p><p>The blood-red Tiger opened its mouth, and a saint’s might emanated from it. Its aura was oppressive.</p><p>“Senior, I have important news to report to you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“What news?”</p><p>The blood-red Tiger said.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>Lu Ming hesitated for a moment. He looked left and right on purpose. He held a voice transmission jade talisman in his hand and secretly sent a message to Huang Ling.</p><p>In the distance, in a cloud, Huang Ling received Lu Ming’s message.</p><p>“Lu Ming has sent out the news. Let’s do it!”</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>Instantly, more than a dozen figures rushed towards Meng mountain at extreme speed. The air whistled and released a terrifying aura.</p><p>“They’ve finally made their move!”</p><p>The blood-red Tiger sneered and looked in the direction of Huang Ling and the others, but it did not move.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, terrifying auras shot up into the sky from the Union mountain. The Holy might was vast, and ten different figures rushed out.</p><p>There were indeed terrifying experts lying in ambush here. Ten Saints charged towards Huang Ling and the others.</p><p>not good, there are too many experts on the other side. Retreat!</p><p>retreat! Huang Ling shouted and they retreated quickly.</p><p>“Don’t let them get away!”</p><p>Some of the Saints roared, and the ten Saints chased after Huang Ling.</p><p>“Hmph, this time, I’m going to leave all of them behind!”</p><p>The blood-red Tiger sneered, then looked at Lu Ming.”What did you want to report?”</p><p>“Senior, what I want to say is that there are other people who have sneaked in!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>The blood-red Tiger’s eyes shone with golden light.</p><p>“That is … I’ll!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly let out a loud roar. He stomped on the ground, causing the ground to crack. Lu Ming’s figure charged towards the blood-red Tiger, and he threw a punch at the blood-red Tiger.</p><p>Lu Ming had used almost all his strength in this punch.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>The blood-red Tiger did not expect that Lu Ming would suddenly attack. It wanted to Dodge but it was too late.</p><p>The punch landed squarely on the Tiger’s head. Even though the Tiger was a Saint realm expert, it could not withstand the blow. Its entire head exploded and its body flew out.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming rushed over immediately. The space between his brows glowed and the mountain and river diagram appeared. A beam of light descended and enveloped the disciples of the Phoenix Palace.</p><p>The disciples of Phoenix Palace were sucked into the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Then, the light of the mountain and river diagram turned again, and the disciples of the Thunder God sect were also taken in.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>At this moment, the Saints who were guarding the other directions finally reacted. They were furious and rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Collect, collect, collect!”</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the mountain and river diagram and frantically kept the young men. A Pagoda appeared above his head. Bubbles cast the space-time domain and three transparent bubbles suddenly enveloped the three saints, causing them to stop in mid-air.</p><p>Bubbles had already reached the half-Saint stage and was extremely powerful. When she used her spacetime domain, it was enough to affect a Saint.</p><p>By the time the three saints broke free of the space-time domain’s influence, Lu Ming had already taken away more than half of the youths on the mountaintop.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>kill! a loud shout came from the Union mountain. A beam of demonic light shot out and a black-robed elder appeared, exuding a terrifying aura.</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. This black-robed old man had fought outside the tomb of the Samsara Emperor. He was a great sage and was extremely powerful. Lu Ming was not his match yet.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming put away the mountain and river diagram and dashed into the distance.</p><p>“Ah, ah, save us, save us!”</p><p>The remaining young men shouted madly, and among them were the Golden Crow race.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s eyes were cold. He could not be bothered with these people.</p><p>Furthermore, the elites of these sects had already retreated on their own, such as the tenth golden Crow Prince. Why would Lu Ming save them?</p><p>The people that Lu Ming had saved were those who had joined forces with them.</p><p>“Stay here!”</p><p>The black-robed elder’s killing intent was extremely strong. Demonic Qi soared to the sky as a huge palm print came crashing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming got bubbles to open a space-time Tunnel and he rushed into it. When he reappeared, he was already near Huang Ling and the rest.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The group of people gathered and flew forward at high speed.</p><p>However, the next moment, Lu Ming and the rest had a drastic change of expression.</p><p>Because a few auras rose up in front of him. They were extremely terrifying auras.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
