However, once one admitted defeat, they would lose their qualification to continue the competition. They would be eliminated in advance, but they could still keep their points.</p><p>For example, if a person had already obtained five points and encountered an undefeatable opponent, he could take the initiative to admit defeat before the battle began. This way, he could keep his five points, but he would lose the qualification to compete in the later rounds.</p><p>Once the battle started, they could not admit defeat.</p><p>Once the battle started, the battle would only end when one was defeated, rushed off the fighting stage, or killed.</p><p>Once the battle started, one couldn’t admit defeat. However, if one rushed down from the fighting ring, it would be considered a failure. Not only would they keep their current points, but they could also continue to fight.</p><p>It was the same for those who were defeated or knocked off the fighting ring.</p><p>However, if he was killed, his points would return to zero.</p><p>In other words, no matter how many points a person obtained, once they were killed, they would get zero points.</p><p>Therefore, the best choice was to save his life without taking the initiative to admit defeat.</p><p>Moreover, unlike the treasure auction, the use of Saint weapons was not prohibited.</p><p>This was because the participants of the treasure auction were all powerful. Many of them were half-Saints, and they could only display their power with holy weapons.</p><p>However, there was one important point. The person who won the competition would receive an extra reward.</p><p>Therefore, this first place was especially important. Ten points could often determine the outcome of the battle.</p><p>The tianshen sect had won many consecutive victories, and this first place had played an important role.</p><p>alright, I’ve finished explaining the rules. Now, let’s begin the second round. I’ll draw lots randomly. Whoever I draw will fight. When everyone has fought, the round will end!</p><p>Po yuangui spoke and took out a box. Inside the box were the names of the 80 people who had entered the second round.</p><p>Po yuangui drew two names.</p><p>“Dragon weapon, Luo shuihan!”</p><p>Po yuangui called out their names.</p><p>Many people were shocked. They didn’t expect that it would be Luo shuihan’s turn in the first match of the second round.</p><p>Luo shuihan stood up, took a step forward, and appeared on the fighting ring.</p><p>In the Dragon God Valley area, a young man stood up with an unsightly expression.</p><p>Long Bing was one of the 15 people from Dragon God Valley.</p><p>Long Bing’s face turned pale. He did not expect to meet Luo shuihan first.</p><p>However, there were 80 people in total, and 15 from Dragon God Valley. The probability of meeting an expert was indeed very high.</p><p>long Bing, you are no match for Luo shuihan. Go up and admit defeat!</p><p>Zi Feng warned the Dragon Soldier.</p><p>Dragon Soldier nodded and then jumped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>haha, looks like I’m in luck. I’ve met someone from Dragon God Valley in the first round!</p><p>Luo shuihan laughed, and a sharp light flashed in her eyes.</p><p>“Now, let the competition begin!”</p><p>Po yuangui announced.</p><p>“Just admit defeat!”</p><p>Luo shuihan said lightly.</p><p>A look of struggle flashed in long Bing’s eyes. If he admitted defeat, he would not be able to get a single point in the treasure sealing assembly.</p><p>In the second round, Dragon God Valley would reward them with a large number of contribution points for every point they got. It was the same for the other sects.</p><p>He was not willing to admit defeat.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Dragon Soldier stomped his feet and rushed to the edge of the fighting ring.</p><p>As long as he rushed off the fighting ring, he could continue the rest of the competition even though he had lost this round. He was at the first stage of the half-Saint realm, so it was still possible for him to get points later.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The moment they saw that Dragon Soldier did not admit defeat but wanted to rush down the fighting stage instead, the expressions of Zi Feng and the rest changed drastically.</p><p>He didn’t admit defeat. Once he attacked, he would lose the chance to admit defeat.</p><p>haha, you actually don’t admit defeat. Then I’ll send you on your way!</p><p>Luo shuihan was overjoyed. Her body was bathed in holy light. Her body moved like a ray of holy light, rushing toward Dragon Soldier. Almost in an instant, she caught up with Dragon Soldier.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, a palm print of holy light struck toward the Dragon weapon.</p><p>Dragon soldier’s face turned pale. He changed his direction and rushed to the other side.</p><p>“You can’t escape!”</p><p>A cold light flashed in Luo shuihan’s eyes. She formed a spear of divine punishment in her palm and shot it out.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The spear of divine punishment pierced through one of Dragon soldier’s legs. Dragon soldier’s leg exploded. He screamed and fell to the ground, his face full of despair.</p><p>Luo shuihan took a step forward and appeared in front of long Bing. Her eyes were cold as she said, ” against me, you actually don’t admit defeat. Only death awaits you if you think that you’re lucky!</p><p>With a wave of his hand, a ray of holy light cut off one of Dragon soldier’s arms, and blood splashed everywhere.</p><p>ah, Luo shuihan, kill me if you want, but don’t insult me!</p><p>The Dragon Soldier roared.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Luo shuihan stepped on Dragon soldier’s face and said coldly, ” “Do I need you to teach me whether I want to kill or not? You people of Dragon God Valley are all so bold to offend me. You all deserve to die!”</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Another beam of holy light cut off the other arm of the Dragon Soldier.</p><p>damn it, Luo shuihan! If you want to do it, do it!</p><p>Zi Feng roared loudly, like a violent Dragon.</p><p>The rest of the people from Dragon God Valley were also furious.</p><p>The killing intent in Lu Ming’s eyes grew colder.</p><p>Luo shuihan did this on purpose. She could have killed Dragon Soldier in one move, but she tortured him in this way. She was taking revenge on Dragon God Valley and Lu Ming.</p><p>haha, if you want to blame someone, blame Lu Ming. He doesn’t know what’s good for him!</p><p>Luo shuihan laughed and stomped on the ground. Dragon soldier’s body exploded.</p><p>Luo shuihan looked at Lu Ming with vengeful pleasure and said with a smile, ” “So what if there are many people from Dragon God Valley who have entered the second round? No matter how many people there are, we can just kill them all!”</p><p>Luo shuihan, you’d better admit defeat when you meet me. Otherwise, you’ll die a miserable death!</p><p>Lu Ming said, his voice as cold as a knife.</p><p>He had to kill Luo shuihan.</p><p>“You want to kill me? I’ll be waiting for you!”</p><p>Luo shuihan said coldly.</p><p>Then, he jumped off the fighting ring.</p><p>The first round of the competition ended just like that.</p><p>junior brothers and sisters, if you encounter someone with a huge difference in cultivation in the following matches, you must admit defeat immediately. Don’t try to get lucky!</p><p>Zi Feng transmitted his voice to the other Dragon God Valley geniuses who were participating in the competition.</p><p>Everyone nodded in agreement.</p><p>The difference in cultivation was too great, so it was impossible to rush down the fighting ring.</p><p>the second match, Zi Feng versus Liu De!</p><p>Po yuangui’s voice sounded.</p><p>“It’s my turn in the second round!”</p><p>Zi Feng got up and stepped into the battle stage.</p><p>“I’m really unlucky!”</p><p>In the heaven seat King area, a young man stood up with an unsightly expression.</p><p>It was indeed unlucky to meet one of the top ten geniuses in the first round.</p><p>“Junior Brother, just admit defeat!”</p><p>The heaven seat King’s genius warned.</p><p>Liu De stepped onto the fighting ring. When po yuangui announced the start of the fight, Liu De directly admitted defeat.</p><p>If he admitted defeat, he would be eliminated in advance. He would not be able to participate in the following matches.</p><p>In this way, only seventy-eight people were left out of the eighty.</p><p>In theory, each of the eighty people would have to fight their way through, and in the end, each person would have to fight eighty battles. In reality, it was impossible to fight that many battles.</p><p>In the process of the competition, there would be people who would constantly admit defeat or be killed. Therefore, the number of people would get smaller and smaller. The further it went, the fewer people there would be.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
