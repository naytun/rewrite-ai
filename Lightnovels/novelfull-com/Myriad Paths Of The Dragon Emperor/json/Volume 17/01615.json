BOOM!</p><p>The long spear and the combat sword clashed with the two puppets. Lu Ming’s body trembled and he was forced to retreat.</p><p>...</p><p>“That is … The ten thousand soldiers art!”</p><p>This time, Huang Ling was shocked by Lu Ming again.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually cultivated the ten thousand soldiers art. This was a unique technique of the WAN family.</p><p>She felt that she could not see through Lu Ming anymore.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At the same time, a few more puppets attacked Lu Ming from the other side with lightning speed.</p><p>Lu Ming squinted his eyes slightly and focused his mind. Just as the puppets ‘attacks were about to hit him, he moved his body suddenly. A flash of wind and lightning appeared and he dodged the attacks of a few puppets by a hair’s breadth.</p><p>He was using the thundering wind steps.</p><p>Then, he attacked from the left and the right, launching a spear and a combat sword, blocking the siege of the other two puppets.</p><p>Lu Ming did not use the puppet formation’s weakness as an excuse to avoid the attacks. He used his combat strength to battle the puppets and train himself.</p><p>However, there were more than a dozen puppets in the puppet formation that were far more powerful than him. He could only use all his strength and suppress his potential to the limit to fight against the puppet formation.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming barely managed to withstand ten moves before he fell into a fatal crisis. He had no choice but to step on the weak point of the puppet formation to avoid the attacks and retreat to a safe area. After resting, he stepped into the formation again to fight the puppets.</p><p>Every time, Lu Ming had to push himself to the limit. When he was in a fatal danger, he would use the weakness of the array to avoid the attack. In this way, although Lu Ming could not enter the state of life and death, he still improved at a rapid pace.</p><p>As soon as he started cultivating the thundering wind steps, he improved the fastest. After a series of breakthroughs, he soon reached the third level.</p><p>As for the chaos Domain, it was also progressing very quickly and was starting to charge towards the ninth level.</p><p>Outside the cave, Wan Tiancheng, Zhao Kuang, and Sima Liang all had gloomy expressions. They stood outside, staring at the cave.</p><p>Hearing the violent rumbles coming from the cave, the three of them had different expressions.</p><p>“What’s happening inside?”</p><p>could it be that Huang Ling is dealing with that kid? ”</p><p>The few of them guessed.</p><p>“We’ll know once we go in and take a look!”</p><p>let’s go! Wan Tiancheng said coldly and rushed into the cave. Zhao Kuang and Sima Liang followed suit.</p><p>As soon as they rushed into the cave, they were besieged by the puppets. At the same time, they saw Lu Ming fighting with the puppets.</p><p>The three of them revealed doubtful expressions and left the cave.</p><p>“How did that brat fight against the puppet? Don’t tell me that after they obtained the map and the key, they would also be attacked by the puppets when they came out?”</p><p>Super Maniac was confused.</p><p>“It should be so!”</p><p>Sima Liang said.</p><p>if they can rush over, they can definitely rush out. We just have to wait here. When they come out, we’ll kill them. Then, we’ll use the map and the key. The three of us will rely on our own abilities!</p><p>Wan Tiancheng’s gaze was very cold. He must kill Lu Ming.</p><p>“That kid, how can he cultivate the ten thousand soldiers scroll? is it because of his domain? That kid’s domain is extremely similar to the legendary chaotic domain, but is there really anyone in the world who can cultivate the chaotic domain?”</p><p>Wan Tiancheng’s mind was constantly spinning with thoughts.</p><p>The three of them had been standing guard outside the cave. Inside the cave, Lu Ming was making the best use of his time to cultivate.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed.</p><p>In the cave, within the puppet formation, Lu Ming’s figure flickered non-stop as he fought with the puppets. Lu Ming’s spear was like a dragon, and his sword was like a sky-breaking sword. The power was shocking as he constantly collided with the puppets.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>After more than ten consecutive collisions, Lu Ming used the powerful force to drift backward and return to the safe zone.</p><p>what’s Lu Ming’s background? he’s so talented. He’s improving almost every day. In such a short time, he’s actually advanced from the eighth level to the ninth level of the Martial Emperor realm!</p><p>Huang Ling’s eyes revealed shock.</p><p>During this period of time, Huang Ling’s injuries had long healed. She had also fought with the puppets but her improvement was not as fast as Lu Ming’s.</p><p>my domain has reached the middle stage of the ninth rank!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>In fact, five days ago, Lu Ming’s territory had broken through to level nine. Then, he had devoured a large number of raw gemstones and raised his cultivation to the ninth level Martial Emperor realm in one go.</p><p>Now, the chaotic domain had been upgraded again, reaching the middle stage of the ninth level.</p><p>“Could it be that I was born to fight? I’m improving really fast in the midst of fighting!”</p><p>Even Lu Ming was surprised by his own improvement.</p><p>In a life-and-death battle, he was always highly focused and his thoughts were unusually active. Whether it was martial arts or territory, his speed of comprehension was extremely shocking.</p><p>By now, Lu Ming had already cultivated the thundering wind steps to its maximum level. His every move was like a storm and his speed was shocking.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming was waiting for an opportunity.</p><p>That was the inscription secondary body, because the inscription secondary body was also about to break through.</p><p>He had already lit up eight spirit lamps when he was refining his second body. Now, he would soon light up nine spirit lamps.</p><p>As long as the Ming Lian clone lit up the nine spirit lamps and controlled the Tai Chi formation, it would be even more powerful. That would be the time for them to attack.</p><p>“Now that I’ve made a breakthrough in my cultivation, I should be able to seal even more holy weapons!”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself. Then, he started to cultivate the ten thousand soldiers art. He took out a holy weapon and started to seal it.</p><p>A light spot lit up on Lu Ming’s chest. The Holy weapon had been successfully sealed.</p><p>This was the eleventh holy weapon.</p><p>Back then, Wan Tiancheng only sealed 12 Saint weapons.</p><p>“I haven’t reached my limit yet, continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out another holy weapon and started to seal it.</p><p>Not long after, the twelfth holy weapon was successfully sealed.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming finally felt that he had reached his limit. If he continued to seal, his body might not be able to take it.</p><p>With a single thought, the twelve acupuncture points on his body glowed, and twelve Saint weapons appeared, floating around him.</p><p>what kind of freak is this? he’s only at the ninth level of the martial Royal realm and he can seal 12 holy weapons!</p><p>Huang Ling was shocked. She was already numb to Lu Ming’s perverted behavior.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. The inscription refining secondary body had begun to break through.</p><p>In the mountain and river diagram, between the eyebrows of Ming Lian’s clone, a brilliant spiritual fire leaped. The Golden spiritual fire was extremely vigorous, like a divine fire burning.</p><p>The Tai Chi formation disk floated above his head. Light scattered and poured into his second body.</p><p>In the second body’s sea of consciousness, there were eight Golden Spirit lamps. They were extremely bright and the flames were extremely bright. Suddenly, the ninth spirit lamp was ignited and golden flames emerged.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Tai Chi formation disk emitted rays of light that surged into Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness, causing the flame on the ninth spirit lamp to burn brighter and stronger.</p><p>At this moment, spiritual rings appeared on the body of the clone.</p><p>There were a total of nine spiritual rings. The first eight spiritual rings had ten light spots on them, representing perfection. Only the last golden spiritual ring had nine light spots.</p><p>As long as his next body lit up ten mental lamps, Lu Ming would be able to use the mental fire, combined with inscriptions, to communicate with the laws of heaven and earth and enter the second stage of the half-Saint in one go.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
