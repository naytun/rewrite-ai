It’s best to tell us. Don’t try to keep it for yourself!</p><p>The Taotie said coldly. His body moved and blocked the bridge of helplessness’s path of retreat. He stared at the crowd with a ferocious look.</p><p>The crowd looked at each other in confusion.</p><p>For a moment, the scene quieted down, and the atmosphere was a little heavy.</p><p>before we find out who got the inheritance of the reincarnation Emperor, we’ll stay here. No one can leave!</p><p>The Taotie was extremely overbearing.</p><p>“There seems to be one person missing from our group!”</p><p>At this moment, a voice rang out. It was Sima Liang, and his gaze turned towards Huang Ling.</p><p>that’s right. One person is missing. Lu Ming is not here!</p><p>Said a young Man in Black feather clothes. He was young master Tianying of the heavenly Bird Palace.</p><p>Huang Ling’s eyes were filled with doubt. Why was Lu Ming not here?</p><p>“It really is so!”</p><p>could it be that Lu Ming has obtained the legacy and is now accepting it? ”</p><p>“Maybe he has already left!”</p><p>Some people were making guesses.</p><p>we’ll wait here. If Lu Ming hasn’t come out yet, he’ll definitely come out later. If he doesn’t come out after a while, we’ll go out and look for him!</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince’s eyes flashed with a sharp light.</p><p>The reincarnation Emperor was a true Emperor who could control the law of reincarnation. His inheritance was even more precious than the inheritance of the thousand kill Martial Emperor. Who wouldn’t be tempted?</p><p>Immediately, everyone began to wait quietly on the bridge of helplessness.</p><p>Lu Ming, on the other hand, was focused on refining the chaos Qi.</p><p>Slowly, a wisp of chaos Qi seeped into the depths of Lu Ming’s body and spread to every cell, giving every part of Lu Ming’s body a wisp of chaos Qi.</p><p>After a few days, Lu Ming finally managed to completely refine the wisp of chaos Qi.</p><p>Lu Ming ended his cultivation and leaped up.</p><p>“What powerful strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming felt that his body was filled with endless power.</p><p>His punch was heavier than a mountain.</p><p>He now felt that he could kill a half-Saint who had comprehended the laws with his physical strength alone.</p><p>“Lu Ming, although your current spirit body is still a low-grade Celestial Spirit body, in terms of strength, it’s no weaker than a medium-grade Celestial Spirit body!”</p><p>The voice of the reincarnation Emperor could be heard.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior. Senior, you …”</p><p>Lu Ming stood up and was about to bow to the reincarnation Emperor when he realized that the reincarnation Emperor’s body had become very ethereal, as if he would disappear at any moment.</p><p>He understood that the reincarnation Emperor had used up the last of his soul power to help him.</p><p>“I’m sorry, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart was filled with a deep sense of apology. He felt that his nose was a little sour.</p><p>little guy, don’t blame yourself. This wisp of my soul was about to dissipate anyway. It has nothing to do with you. Now, I’ll send you out. Go and roam the world as soon as possible!</p><p>Then, the reincarnation Emperor waved his hand. Lu Ming felt his body tighten. He left the secret room and came to an empty place. There was a Black Vortex in front of him.</p><p>“Senior, I will definitely find a suitable successor for you so that your legacy can be passed down!”</p><p>Lu Ming secretly swore in his heart and then stepped into the vortex.</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming passed through the vortex and a bridge appeared in front of him. It was the bridge of helplessness.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step and stepped onto the bridge of helplessness.</p><p>On the bridge of helplessness, everyone’s eyes were fixed on Lu Ming. Their eyes were filled with a fiery glow.</p><p>“Everyone, long time no see, I hope you’ve been well!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re finally out. Tell me, did you get the inheritance of the reincarnation Emperor?”</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince emanated a powerful aura and locked onto Lu Ming.</p><p>“The inheritance of the reincarnation Emperor? Why do you say that?”</p><p>Lu Ming pretended to be puzzled.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I knew you would deny it. All of us appeared here at the same time. You’re the only one who came out a few days later than the others. You must have obtained the inheritance of the reincarnation Emperor!”</p><p>The Taotie opened its mouth and strode over.</p><p>just because I’m a little later, does it mean that I’ve obtained the inheritance of the reincarnation Emperor? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>everyone, it’s very simple. As long as we cripple him and search his soul, everything will be clear. At that time, he’ll still have to spit out everything!</p><p>A cold voice rang out. It was Sima Liang.</p><p>Since the beginning of the fight for the map and key of the tomb of the Samsara King, he had been at a disadvantage in the hands of Lu Ming and Huang Ling. Later on, he and Zhao Kuang wanted to cooperate with Lu Ming and Huang Ling but were chased away by Lu Ming. This was a great humiliation. He had been looking for an opportunity to kill Lu Ming. Now that he had such an opportunity, of course, he would not let it go. He immediately added fuel to the fire.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold gaze turned to Sima Liang.”You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Sima Liang’s expression changed, and he was a little frightened. However, when he thought about the fact that there were so many experts present, he became braver and said, ” “What’s wrong? Did I speak your mind? you want to kill me? Hmph, there are so many people here, you won’t have the chance today!”</p><p>that’s right. Lu Ming, you should hand over the inheritance of the reincarnation Emperor!</p><p>Young master Tianying said coldly.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince took a step forward, and his entire body was covered in the divine fire of the great sun.”If you don’t want to admit it, then I’ll search your soul!”</p><p>“Golden Crow, what are you doing?”</p><p>die! Huang Ling shouted as the undying flame spread out from her body. Her powerful aura surged towards the tenth golden Crow Prince.</p><p>“Huang Ling, you’d better just stand there obediently!”</p><p>The Taotie said coldly. It took a step forward and stood in front of bi Lin.</p><p>everyone, let’s search his soul directly. Other than the inheritance of the reincarnation Emperor, there are other secrets on this person. Let’s get them together!</p><p>Sima Liang clamored, extremely arrogant.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Sima Liang coldly and took a step forward, walking towards him.</p><p>“Who do you want to kill? Stay here!”</p><p>The Golden Crow tenth Crown Prince said coldly as he clawed at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, the will of wind and thunder flashed across Lu Ming’s body as he used the thundering wind steps. In a flash, Lu Ming dodged the attack of the tenth golden Crow Prince and appeared in front of Sima Liang in an instant.</p><p>Then, he stretched out his hand to grab Sima Liang.</p><p>Sima Liang was shocked. He unleashed all of his cultivation and a heavenly halberd appeared in his hand, which he then swung at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly shouted and used the divine sword technique. Two black rays of light shot out from his eyes and blasted into Sima Liang’s spiritual God. Instantly, Sima Liang screamed in pain and his hands froze.</p><p>When a martial artist made a breakthrough in their cultivation, they would also take the opportunity to condense their soul, and their soul power would also increase accordingly.</p><p>When Lu Ming broke through to the first stage of the half-Saint, his soul force had also improved.</p><p>His soul power was already equivalent to the third stage of the half-Saint realm. Now that he had improved, he was infinitely close to the soul power of the Saint realm. After using the divine sword technique, even if Sima Liang had a spiritual divine defensive treasure, he was still greatly affected.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
