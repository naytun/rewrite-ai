Two days later, dark water city appeared in front of them.</p><p>When the two of them entered the city gate, the soldiers guarding the city looked at them coldly, but they did not move.</p><p>...</p><p>“The soldiers guarding the gate, something is wrong. They seem to want to attack us!”</p><p>Walking on the streets of dark water city, Huang Ling frowned.</p><p>it’s not just the guards. The other people on the street are also looking at me weirdly. Also, did you notice that you don’t seem to see any young men who are too powerful? ”</p><p>Lu Ming also frowned.</p><p>Huang Ling sized them up and realized that the people on the street were looking at them with strange expressions.</p><p>Moreover, there really weren’t many young experts. Occasionally, he would see some whose cultivation wasn’t very strong. It was obvious that they were local youths. It was as if the young heaven’s favorites who came here to train had disappeared into thin air.</p><p>“Not good, I’m afraid the situation has changed!”</p><p>Lu Ming had a bad premonition.</p><p>“Let’s go to the Phoenix Palace first!”</p><p>Huang Ling was a little anxious.</p><p>The two of them rose into the air and flew toward the Phoenix Palace.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at the Phoenix Palace.</p><p>However, there was no one in the Phoenix Palace.</p><p>The Phoenix Palace was completely empty. There was not a single disciple of the Phoenix Palace. It was as if the disciples of the Phoenix Palace had vanished into thin air.</p><p>“What’s going on? Could it be that something had happened in the past three months that caused all the young sovereigns to leave Darkwater city? Or have they all withdrawn from the hundred clan battlefield?”</p><p>Huang Ling was very confused. On the way, she had learned from Lu Ming that they had stayed in the tomb of the reincarnation Emperor for three months.</p><p>“Holy maiden!”</p><p>At this moment, an old woman flew over and bowed to Feng Ling.</p><p>“You are …”</p><p>Huang Ling was stunned.</p><p>“Holy maiden, it’s me!”</p><p>At this moment, the old woman’s form changed rapidly, turning into a young and beautiful woman.</p><p>The old woman earlier was this woman in disguise.</p><p>“Huang Xuan, it’s you. What happened?”</p><p>Huang Ling asked.</p><p>It was obvious that the young woman was a disciple of Phoenix Palace.</p><p>the saintess has been captured. The other senior and junior brothers and sisters have been captured by the local experts. I was able to disguise myself and blended into the local crowd in time. That’s how I escaped. Saintess, let’s go. The local experts will be here soon!</p><p>Huang Xuan said anxiously.</p><p>“A native expert?”</p><p>Huang Ling was a little stunned.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At this time, a violent air-piercing sound was heard. At least a few dozen rainbow lights cut through the void and flew toward them.</p><p>Dozens of powerhouses in armor descended above the Phoenix Palace in an instant, exuding a powerful aura.</p><p>The dozens of people were all in the half-Saint realm. More than a dozen of them were in the third stage of the half-Saint realm, the realm where the laws could be infused into the body.</p><p>“Take down all of the foreign chosen!”</p><p>A burly man shouted.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>Dozens of experts attacked immediately. They launched fierce attacks, wanting to severely injure Lu Ming and Huang Ling in one go.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>die! Huang Ling shouted angrily. The immortal flame burned and turned into an immortal flame Phoenix. It pounced forward and killed five or six half-Saints with a flap of its wings.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming threw more than a dozen punches in a row. Each punch sent a fist radiance flying through the air. Each fist radiance could blow up an expert in the air.</p><p>To Lu Ming, there was no difference whether it was the law tank or the second stage of the half-Saint, he could kill an ordinary half-Saint in one move.</p><p>“Evil creature, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>At this time, a loud shout came from the depths of dark water city, and a terrifying aura shot up into the sky.</p><p>oh no, it’s a Sage. Let’s rush out first!</p><p>Huang Ling’s expression changed.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. Then, he used the thunderwind steps and appeared in front of a local half-Saint in a flash. He reached out and grabbed the man’s throat. Then, he carried the burly man and rushed out of the dark water city with Huang Ling and Huang Xuan.</p><p>In the depths of dark water city, an elder rushed out and slashed out a terrifying sword light.</p><p>This was an expert in the initial sacred brightness realm. Lu Ming threw a punch and destroyed the sword light. Huang Ling used her vital essence to carry Huang Xuan and the three of them rushed out of Darkwater city at top speed.</p><p>In a short while, he rushed out of Darkwater city and rushed into the distance.</p><p>In Darkwater city, the old man in the sage realm seemed to be a little afraid and did not pursue.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest only stopped after flying for a long time. Lu Ming sealed the cultivation of the local half-Saint and threw him on the ground.</p><p>“Huang Xuan, what’s going on?”</p><p>Huang Ling asked.</p><p>I don’t know either. About a month ago, the locals suddenly launched an attack. Many of the Saints attacked the talents of the foreign forces. Many of them were killed. Many of our Phoenix Palace died as well. The others were captured, and some of them escaped the city!</p><p>Huang Xuan explained.</p><p>“What are the races on the hundred clan battlefield trying to do?”</p><p>Huang Ling’s eyes were burning with flames.</p><p>They had also been attacked by the Saints of various races in the hundred clan battlefield after coming out of the tomb of the reincarnation Emperor. Was this all a coincidence?</p><p>“We’ll know if we ask this guy!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped on the local half-saint’s dantian and said,”Speak, why did you attack us?”</p><p>“Hahaha, don’t you know your own limits? The hundred clan battlefield belongs to the various races of the hundred clan battlefield. You outsiders, there are always people coming in to plunder the treasures here and kill the people of the various races. You all deserve to die!”</p><p>this time, the various races of the hundred clan battlefield have joined forces to kill all of you so that the large sects in the outside world will never dare to send anyone here again!</p><p>The local half-Saint laughed wildly.</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>Lu Ming raised his eyebrows.</p><p>It seemed like the native races held a deep grudge against the foreign heaven’s favorites. They must have planned this for a long time to kill them.</p><p>It didn’t matter how strong the large sects and factions outside were. Experts above the Saint realm couldn’t enter the hundred clan battlefield. As a result, they could only give up on the hundred clan battlefield, a place where geniuses were trained.</p><p>“Tell me, where are the people you captured hiding?”</p><p>Huang Ling asked.</p><p>there’s no harm in telling you. Those who were caught in the Alliance mountain were all taken there, including the disciples of your Phoenix Palace. They’ll all be killed there and sacrificed to our ancestors. Haha!</p><p>The local half-Saint laughed.</p><p>“Meng mountain!”</p><p>Huang Ling frowned. She then looked at Lu Ming and said, ” Lu Ming, I’m going to Meng mountain to save the disciples of Phoenix Palace. I’ll take my leave now!</p><p>They had formed an alliance because of the tomb of the Samsara Emperor. Now that the trip to the tomb of the Samsara Emperor was over, their alliance was naturally over.</p><p>Huang Ling, I’m afraid this is a trap set by the native races. It’s probably very dangerous to go to the Alliance mountain!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>I know, but I can’t just leave so many disciples of Phoenix Palace! Phoenix spirit sighed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
