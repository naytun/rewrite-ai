Congratulations!”</p><p>Lu Ming sized up Longyuan mountain and was overjoyed to find that there was Saint power surging on Longyuan mountain.</p><p>...</p><p>haha, I’ve wasted so much time to break through to the Saint realm. Your third senior brother and the others have long broken through to the Saint realm!</p><p>Longyuan Shan laughed.</p><p>with second senior brother’s talent, he’ll definitely be able to break through the Saint realm in one day. He’ll definitely be able to do so in the future!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Lu Ming had heard Tian Chui and Xue ningxin mention that Longyuan mountain had been severely injured when they were young. It had damaged their source, which caused their cultivation to progress extremely slowly. They had been stuck at the half-Saint realm and were unable to break through.</p><p>It was said that when Longyuan mountain was young, they went out to train with their big senior brother and met a strong enemy. In that battle, their big senior brother died and Longyuan mountain was seriously injured.</p><p>This was also a knot in Longyuan mountain’s heart, and also the obstacle that stopped him from moving forward.</p><p>Longyuan mountain smiled and didn’t say much.</p><p>“Xiangxiang, come, let master see how your cultivation is.”</p><p>Lu Ming turned his gaze to Xiangxiang.</p><p>More than a year had passed, and Xiangxiang had grown a lot taller. She was already more than nine years old, and had a slender and elegant feeling. With one look, one could tell that she was a beauty.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat when he saw it. “Xiangxiang, you’ve broken through to the spiritual God Realm?”</p><p>that’s right. She just broke through not long ago. Xiangxiang’s cultivation hasn’t dropped, right? ”</p><p>Xiangxiang Beila blinked her large eyes and said.</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips trembled. Not only did it not fall, but it was also very fast.</p><p>More than a year ago, Xiangxiang Beila’s cultivation was only at the peak of the martial King realm. It had only been a year, but Xiangxiang Beila had already crossed several major realms and broken through to the spiritual God Realm in one go.</p><p>A nine-year-old spiritual God Realm. Even with Lu Ming’s state of mind, he was shocked.</p><p>haha, ninth Junior Brother, are you shocked? Xiangxiang is extremely talented and rare. If we don’t work hard, I’m afraid that Xiangxiang will surpass us soon!</p><p>Longyuan mountain laughed.</p><p>“That’s possible!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and felt a sense of pressure.</p><p>As her master, if he were to be surpassed by Xiangxiang Beila in the future, that would be too embarrassing.</p><p>Of course, he was still very happy.</p><p>Although he was under pressure, he still hoped that Xiangxiang Beila would be as strong as possible.</p><p>“By the way, second senior, where’s master?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>master has something to do during this period of time. I don’t know what it is exactly, so I’ll be cultivating with Xiangxiang Beila during this period of time!</p><p>Longyuan mountain said.</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. It seemed that the cloud Dragon Valley master was really in trouble.</p><p>ninth Junior Brother, you’ve come back at the right time. Today, Dragon God Valley is holding the selection of the spots for the treasure fixing assembly. You should still be able to make it if you go now!</p><p>Longyuan mountain said.</p><p>“Screening of the slots?”</p><p>Lu Ming was surprised.</p><p>In the past, anyone above Lv 7 martial Royal realm and below the age of 50 could participate in the treasure fixing assembly. Why was there a need to screen this time?</p><p>“Ninth Junior Brother, the rules of this time’s treasure sealing assembly have been changed!”</p><p>in recent years, there have been many experts and geniuses among the younger generation. As a result, there are too many people above the seventh level Martial Emperor realm. There are also many more geniuses who are stronger. Therefore, it is meaningless to have too many people above the seventh level Martial Emperor realm participate. Therefore, this time, the rules have been changed to each sect sending twenty of their strongest geniuses to participate!</p><p>Longyuan mountain explained.</p><p>“Only twenty?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>that’s right. That’s why the seven elders of the Dragon God Valley will first recommend twenty people. Then, the others will challenge these twenty people. The winner will replace the other person’s position and become one of the twenty people. In the end, when no one challenges, the twenty places will be determined.</p><p>ninth Junior Brother, let’s go. You’ll definitely be able to get a spot!</p><p>Longyuan mountain said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and brought Xiangxiang Beila along with Longyuan mountain, flying towards a huge Snow Mountain.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at the competition venue.</p><p>The top of a large Snow Mountain was very flat. There was a fighting stage in the middle, and it was surrounded by people.</p><p>On the northern side of the formation, there was a row of seats, and the people sitting on them were the high-level and strong people of the seven great valleys of Dragon God Valley.</p><p>On the edge of the fighting ring stood a row of people. These were the 20 people selected by the seven great valleys.</p><p>“Seventh senior brother, eighth Senior Sister!”</p><p>Lu Ming saw Tian Chui and Xue ningxin among the twenty people.</p><p>seventh brother and Eighth Sister have reached the first stage of the half-Saint realm. They’re quite good among the younger generation of Dragon God Valley!</p><p>Longyuan mountain said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. More than a year ago, Tian Chui and Xue ningxin had reached the eighth level of the martial Royal realm. It had been a long time since then. With their talents, it was normal for them to reach the first stage of the half-Saint realm.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s Lu Ming!”</p><p>At this moment, someone saw Lu Ming and exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>“What? Lu Ming had appeared? Where is it?”</p><p>Immediately, many people turned to look around and their eyes landed on Lu Ming.</p><p>Everyone in the Dragon God Valley knew that Lu Ming had challenged the divine Son.</p><p>However, in the past three years, Lu Ming rarely appeared. Everyone was very curious about what realm Lu Ming had reached.</p><p>Lu Ming pulled Xiangxiang Beila and landed in the seating area with Longyuan mountain.</p><p>Cloud Dragon Valley was one of the Seven Valleys. Now that Longyuan mountain had broken through to the Saint realm, they naturally had the right to sit here.</p><p>A cold and gloomy gaze swept toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately sensed it and looked at the other party.</p><p>The master of Silver Dragon Valley!</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile.</p><p>The master of Silver Dragon Valley cast a cold glance at Lu Ming and turned away.</p><p>now, the challenge will continue. Who else wants to challenge? ”</p><p>An elder of the Saint realm presided over the battle and his voice spread across the entire arena.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>A young man rushed into the fighting ring and chose to challenge a Lv 9 martial Royal realm young man.</p><p>The young man who had challenged him was also at the LV 9 martial Royal realm. The two of them exchanged more than a dozen moves before the young man was defeated.</p><p>Following that, a few more people went up to challenge him, but they were all defeated one by one.</p><p>Those who could be selected by the elders of the seven great valleys were definitely carefully selected. They were the strongest among the younger generation of the Dragon God Valley. It was not easy for ordinary people to challenge them.</p><p>From the start of the challenge until now, there had already been dozens of people who had gone up to challenge, but not a single person had succeeded.</p><p>“Is there anyone else who wants to challenge me?”</p><p>The hosting elder asked again.</p><p>“I’ll go up and get a spot!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming stood up and took a step forward, appearing on the fighting ring.</p><p>Everyone’s heart trembled and their eyes landed on Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming had disappeared for too long. No one knew his current ability. Therefore, Lu Ming’s name was not among the first twenty spots.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming had made a move, would he be able to succeed in the challenge?</p><p>during the previous treasure auction, Lu Ming swept through everyone and his combat strength was shocking. Now that such a long time has passed, it shouldn’t be a problem for him to obtain another spot!</p><p>that’s right. It shouldn’t be a problem for him to obtain a spot. I just don’t know what cultivation realm he’s at right now!</p><p>Many people around the fighting ring were guessing.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
