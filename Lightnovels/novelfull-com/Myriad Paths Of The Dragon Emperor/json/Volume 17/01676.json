He would increase Qiu Ying Ying’s soul force and teach her the divine sword technique. This way, Qiu Ying Ying would be able to crush other sixth level martial Royal realm geniuses with her soul force alone.</p><p>This way, if Qiu Ying Ying were to participate in the treasure auction, she would definitely give everyone a big surprise.</p><p>...</p><p>Yingying, let’s go to your room. I’ll help you increase your soul power!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying nodded.</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Ying Ying went to her room. Lu Ming took out a demonic fiend crystal and helped Qiu Ying Ying refine it.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s help and Qiu Ying Ying’s own help, the speed of refining the demonic fiend crystals was greatly accelerated.</p><p>After refining one, she took out another. Qiu Ying Ying’s soul power increased explosively.</p><p>After a few hours, Qiu Ying Ying’s soul power had a breakthrough. It was now equivalent to the soul power of an eighth level Martial Emperor and it was still increasing.</p><p>Three days later, her soul force made another breakthrough and reached the ninth level of the martial Royal realm.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming finally stopped helping Qiu Ying Ying refine the demonic fiend crystal.</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying needed some time to get used to the sudden increase in strength.</p><p>“Yingying, how about you participate in the treasure auction seven days from now?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Me? I’ve wanted to participate for a long time, but I wasn’t selected!”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying immediately revealed a look of anticipation.</p><p>Her cultivation level was not bad, but her physique was too poor. She was only an ordinary spirit body. Even if she wanted to participate in the small treasure auction, she was already prepared to be selected.</p><p>en, I’ll let senior apprentice brother Zi Feng know. Also, here is the divine Sword Art, a spirit cultivation and attack method. You take it to cultivate!</p><p>Lu Ming took out a jade talisman and passed it to Qiu Ying Ying. It was the attack method of the divine sword technique.</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying took it and scanned it with her spiritual sense, and her face revealed a happy expression.</p><p>Although her illusionary attacks were profound, they didn’t have strong offensive power. If she used the godly sword technique, she would be like a tiger with wings.</p><p>“Lu Ming, thank you!”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying smiled. Then, she seemed to have thought of something. A jade talisman appeared in her palm and she handed it to Lu Ming.”Lu Ming, this is the soul technique that I’m cultivating. It might be useful to you!”</p><p>“Alright, then I won’t stand on ceremony!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not stand on ceremony and kept it immediately. Qiu Ying Ying’s illusion technique was indeed very useful to Lu Ming.</p><p>Yingying, during this period of time, you should familiarize yourself with your cultivation. Seven days later, we’ll participate in the treasure auction!</p><p>Lu Ming said his goodbyes and left.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming looked for su Lei and told her that he had the intention to let her participate in the treasure settlement party. Su Lei naturally agreed.</p><p>With su Lei’s combat strength, she also wanted to participate in the treasure auction.</p><p>Lu Ming then returned to his room and entered the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>On a mountain peak, Ming Lian’s body was flowing with the power of runes. He had a jade talisman in his hand, and runes were entering the Jade talisman.</p><p>Meanwhile, bubbles stood on her clone’s shoulder and used the spacetime laws to help her clone refine Jade talismans.</p><p>Lu Ming was refining a space-time instant teleportation talisman. There was a trace of space-time law power sealed in it. If he crushed it, he could teleport three hundred meters away in an instant.</p><p>Lu Ming refined these Jade talismans with the purpose of giving them to the disciples of the Dragon God Valley who were participating in the treasure settling small meeting. He did not want to be like three years ago, where the disciples of the Dragon God Valley were passive and killed.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming appeared on another mountain peak. With a wave of his hand, a Dragon Bone appeared before his eyes.</p><p>He had obtained this Dragon Bone in the ancestral land of Gusu city.</p><p>Lu Ming released his devouring power and began to refine the essence of the dragon Bone.</p><p>Time passed day by day. In the blink of an eye, it was the day of the treasure auction. At this time, one of the Dragon bones had almost been refined by Lu Ming. However, his spirit body did not improve. It was still a low-grade Celestial Spirit body.</p><p>as expected, it’s too difficult for a spirit body to evolve after attaining the heaven spiritual body. I wonder if the 1500 kilograms of Supreme Saint Dragon Bone can help my spirit body evolve? ”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>Then, he exited the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>“Lu … Senior brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>When Lu Ming appeared in the courtyard, he realized that su Lei and Qiu Yingying had already arrived.</p><p>“Su Lei, Yingying, come with me!” He said.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He brought su Lei and Qiu Yingying and flew toward an open space in the Dragon God Valley.</p><p>There were dozens of people gathered here. These people were the disciples of Dragon God Valley who had participated in the treasure hunt.</p><p>In front of everyone, there were still two people. One was a tall and sturdy old man, precisely a Saint realm elder, and the other was Zi Feng.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming arrived, everyone’s eyes turned to him.</p><p>In particular, the disciples who were going to participate in the treasure auction looked at Lu Ming with admiration.</p><p>Three years ago, Lu Ming had single-handedly helped Dragon God Valley win the first place in the party.</p><p>“Junior Brother Lu, you’re finally here!”</p><p>Zi Feng’s eyes lit up when he saw Lu Ming and he smiled.</p><p>“Senior brother Zi Feng, elder!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists at Zi Feng and the sage realm elder.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I heard from Zifeng that someone recommended you to participate in the small treasure auction?”</p><p>The Saint realm elder asked as he looked at su Lei and Qiu Ying Ying.</p><p>“That’s right, it’s the two of them!”</p><p>Lu Ming pointed at Qiu Yingying and su Lei.</p><p>The Saint realm elder’s eyes flashed with a strange light as he sized up su Lei and Qiu Ying Ying.</p><p>His eyes fell on su Lei, and his eyes flashed. his body is full of qi and blood, and his vitality is as vigorous as fire. This is a superior earthly spiritual body, and his cultivation has reached the peak of the sixth level martial Royal realm. I didn’t know there was such a genius in Dragon God Valley!</p><p>“But … This girl seems to be an ordinary spirit body. Lu Ming, are you really going to let her participate?”</p><p>When the sage realm elder looked at Qiu Ying Ying, he was a little confused.</p><p>“Elder, don’t worry. She will surprise you!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Alright, then we’ll switch to two!”</p><p>The sage realm elder said. Then, he replaced the two people with the weakest cultivation with Qiu Ying Ying and su Lei.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming waved his hand and 36 Jade talismans appeared in the air.</p><p>my fellow junior brothers and sisters, the deity sect, Yu Du sect, and the other sects will definitely target us in this treasure determination party. It will be as dangerous as three years ago!</p><p>Lu Ming’s words caused many people’s expressions to change and fear flashed across their faces.</p><p>Indeed, if they were targeted by the other sects like three years ago, some of the weaker ones among them would be in danger.</p><p>However, the Dragon God Valley had ordered them to participate, so they had no choice but to participate. When the time came, they could only try their best to stay alive.</p><p>however, this time, I won’t let you repeat the mistake of the three-year period. Each of you will have one of these Jade talismans. If you encounter any danger, just crush the Jade talisman and your body will be transported 300 meters away!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>These words made all the disciples present, including the Saint stage elder and Zi Feng, reveal a burning desire in their eyes.</p><p>There was actually such a treasure. It could save his life at a critical moment.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and thirty-six Jade talismans flew into the hands of the thirty-six participating disciples, one for each of them.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
