The sword-light cut through the void, and the terrifying sharpness seemed to want to tear Lu Ming apart.</p><p>This man’s cultivation was even stronger than the Man in Black. He was not far from the second stage of half-Saint, where he could comprehend nomological laws.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted. The divine sword technique turned into a sound wave that rushed out, slowing down the opponent’s sword momentum. At the same time, Lu Ming stabbed with his spear, blocking the opponent’s long sword.</p><p>“Thousand-kill sword technique, thousand-mile space!”</p><p>The first black-clothed man once again used a terrifying killing technique. Thousands of sword lights bloomed from his hands, and the sword Qi whistled in the sky. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>As the first man in Black swung his sword, the sword light that filled the sky turned into one and slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“It’s dangerous!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming felt a sense of fatal danger. The sword light was too fast. It was so fast that Lu Ming could not block it in time.</p><p>Huala!</p><p>His first reaction was to use his black wings to block in front of him.</p><p>His opponent’s sword light pierced the black wings.</p><p>??…</p><p>An ear-piercing sound rang out, and sparks flew in all directions. The opponent’s long sword had actually pierced through the chaos Domain that covered the black wings. The black wings trembled as if they were about to be pierced open.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming retreated at top speed and was shocked to find that there was indeed a small pit on the black wings. It sank in and the black wings were injured.</p><p>Even a holy weapon could be destroyed. One could see how amazing the opponent’s attack was.</p><p>“Yes, this is the feeling!”</p><p>Lu Ming was not shocked. Instead, he was elated. This was the feeling he wanted. The feeling of being in danger.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the second man in Black also launched a terrifying attack at him.</p><p>Then, the first man in Black continued to charge at Lu Ming.</p><p>Dragon roars were heard as the Black Dragon Spear in Lu Ming’s hand danced and swept in all directions as he fought with the two men in Black.</p><p>Facing the two men in Black, Lu Ming was completely at a disadvantage.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not call bubbles for help, nor did he call for backup. He did not even cast the chaos sky-turning seal.</p><p>This was because Lu Ming wanted to stimulate his potential when he was in danger.</p><p>If he called out bubbles or the second body to help, how could he force himself to stimulate his potential?</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming simply kept his black wings and fought with his opponent with his Black Dragon Spear alone.</p><p>“Thousand-kill sword technique, thousand-mile space!”</p><p>“Thousand-kill sword technique, thousand-mile space!”</p><p>At this moment, the two men in Black used their most powerful killing moves at the same time. The sword Qi that filled the sky turned into two terrifying sword lights. One of them attacked Lu Ming from the front, while the other attacked Lu Ming from the back.</p><p>This was a killing move, an extremely terrifying killing move!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s heart turned cold. He felt a terrible crisis engulfing him. At this moment, he even wanted to call for bubbles or his clone to help.</p><p>However, he quickly rejected this idea.</p><p>He had to rely on himself to avoid this killing move.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s essence, energy, and spirit were highly concentrated. His pupils were about to contract into a dot.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s mind seemed to be roaring and exploding.</p><p>His spirit seemed to have merged with the world. At that moment, everything in the world seemed to slow down.</p><p>He saw the fatal sword attacks of the two assassins from thousand kills Manor approaching him.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming took a step forward and his figure disappeared from where he was.</p><p>The sword lights of the two assassins collided with each other.</p><p>With a terrifying boom, the two assassins ‘bodies trembled and they retreated. Blood seeped out of the corners of their mouths.</p><p>They found it hard to believe that Lu Ming was able to escape from their killing moves.</p><p>“Life and death ethereal realm, this is the life and death ethereal realm, kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and then shouted loudly. His Chaos Domain burst out and Lu Ming charged towards the other party.</p><p>The life and death realm was a mysterious realm. Some Warriors, in the face of death, would enter a realm due to their high concentration. This realm was called the life and death realm.</p><p>This realm was like enlightenment. A warrior’s spirit would be one with heaven and earth, and his understanding of the great Dao of heaven and earth would be greatly improved.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s understanding of the chaos realm seemed to have skyrocketed.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The Black Dragon Spear in Lu Ming’s hands transformed into two dazzling spearlights. The surface of the spearlights was covered with the chaos Domain that was as heavy as a mountain.</p><p>The spearlight stabbed the two assassins ‘long swords. The two assassins’ bodies trembled and they flew backward.</p><p>Lu Ming opened his eyes, his gaze extremely bright.</p><p>“Eighth-grade domain!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and was a little shocked.</p><p>At that moment, he had entered the realm of life and death. His chaotic domain had broken through and entered level eight.</p><p>The effect of the life and death ethereal realm was truly shocking. No wonder so many geniuses entered the hundred clan battlefield to find someone to fight. Walking on the edge of life and death, one’s progress was indeed very great.</p><p>It was a pity that the state of life and death could not be maintained for long. After a few breaths, he would be out of that state. Otherwise, how much would his realm increase?</p><p>“You’ve broken through?”</p><p>The eyes of the two assassins from thousand kills mansion were filled with strong killing intent.</p><p>They wanted to kill Lu Ming, but they did not expect that Lu Ming’s potential would be stimulated under their joint attack and he would actually break through.</p><p>so what if you’ve broken through? you’ll still die. Kill!</p><p>One of the assassins shouted coldly, his killing intent as sharp as a knife.</p><p>“It’s time to end this battle!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. His glabella glowed and Ming Lian stepped out. The Tai Chi formation disk was suspended above his head.</p><p>“Two people, no, one person!”</p><p>The two assassins ‘eyes narrowed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Tai Chi formation plate glowed, and a Tai Chi pattern emerged, suppressing one of the assassins.</p><p>Lu Ming took the lead and charged at another assassin.</p><p>In Lu Ming’s hand, a chaos sky-turning seal appeared and was rapidly growing.</p><p>In the end, the primal Chaos sky-turning seal turned into the size of a small mountain and pressed down on the assassin. The terrifying aura completely locked onto the other party.</p><p>“Thousand-kill sword technique, thousand-mile space!”</p><p>The assassin roared and displayed his unique skill. He displayed a brilliant sword in an attempt to break the chaos sky-turning seal.</p><p>However, when his sword light slashed at the chaos sky-turning seal, his sword light immediately shattered. His body retreated frantically as he spat out large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>The man roared as he frantically retreated.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was terrifyingly powerful. He had not used his full strength just now, but now that he had used his full strength, the power was shocking.</p><p>“Retreat? Where can you retreat to?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A huge chaos sky-turning seal formed above the black-clothed Assassin’s head. It emitted a vast and terrifying might, and its power was even stronger than the chaos sky-turning seal from before.</p><p>After such a long time, Lu Ming had already cultivated the chaos sky-turning seal to the peak of the fourth level, close to the fifth level. Now that the chaos Domain had reached level eight, the power of the chaos sky-turning seal had become even more terrifying.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
