Then, she turned to look at Lu Ming.</p><p>Huang Ling, I’ve just made a breakthrough. Let’s rush out today!</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming said, a sharp glint flashing in his eyes.</p><p>“Alright, we’ll charge out today!”</p><p>The others all nodded, killing intent flashing across their faces.</p><p>They were all heaven’s favorites and were very proud. This time, they were forced to hide here for half a year by the native races. This made them very angry and they wanted to explode.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming immediately took the lead and strode toward the exit.</p><p>Nearly 500 people followed Lu Ming with an imposing aura.</p><p>The way out was smooth, and they soon arrived at the passage.</p><p>As expected, it only took a day to cross the passage.</p><p>When they crossed the passage, a loud roar came from outside, ” “They’re out!”</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Instantly, a terrifying aura burst out from all directions outside the passage.</p><p>It was the aura of a Saint.</p><p>There were about twenty of them.</p><p>These people really didn’t want to give up. They had actually waited here for half a year.</p><p>More than 20 figures stepped in the air, shrouded in Saint light. Their auras were as heavy as mountains, and their Saint might permeated the air.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared and charged over.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>The other young men rushed over one after another, and a terrifying light of attack blasted forward.</p><p>Compared to half a year ago, their strength had improved a lot.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>An expert in the initial bright Saint realm stared at Lu Ming and attacked him with his palm.</p><p>“You’re the one who’s going to die!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He cast the prison suppressing heavenly art and threw a punch.</p><p>This punch contained the power of the Laws of Chaos.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The punch landed on the opponent’s palm. The opponent’s face changed dramatically. With a scream, his palm exploded. The terrifying force continued to attack the opponent.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The other party screamed in horror. Then, under this move, his body was torn into pieces, his Saint heart shattered, and he died on the spot.</p><p>Killing an early-stage bright Saint in one move made the other Saints around them gasp.</p><p>Weng!</p><p>Suddenly, the void rippled, and the space in front of the other initial bright sage expert shattered like a mirror. Just like the mirror, the body of the other initial bright sage expert also shattered.</p><p>Another initial bright Saint was dead!</p><p>This was bubble’s attack. She had used spacetime laws to kill a Sage.</p><p>Bzzzz …</p><p>On the other side, Huang Ling was bathed in the undying flames. With a palm strike, a flaming phoenix flew out. A lower tier bright Saint expert was sent flying, spitting out blood.</p><p>He was seriously injured by bi Lin in one move.</p><p>Ye Dongfang, Xia ding, and the others also unleashed their full power. Each of them could fight with a Saint and were not weak at all.</p><p>With the other 500 heaven’s favorites joining forces, their power was terrifying. When they joined forces, they completely blocked the opponent’s attack.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>A black-robed elder charged at Lu Ming with a cold gaze.</p><p>This person was an expert at the great mastery of the bright Saint realm.</p><p>A demonic palm print headed towards Lu Ming. Its combat strength was several times stronger than that of a lower tier bright Saint.</p><p>A chaos sky-turning seal suddenly appeared in Lu Ming’s palm and he smashed it toward the other party.</p><p>The chaos Empyrean seal was activated by the power of laws, and its might was even more terrifying. It directly crushed the other party’s demonic palm print.</p><p>it seems like the other party’s peak bright sage isn’t here for the time being. I’ll just kill this fellow!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>His glabella glowed, and Ming Lian stepped out. The Tai Chi formation plate glowed, and a Tai Chi yin-yang fish pattern pressed down on the black-robed elder.</p><p>The black-robed old man’s demonic light burst forth, and he struck out two palms in a row, resisting the Yin Yang Tai Chi pattern.</p><p>But at this moment, he was shocked to find that his movements had slowed down, as if he was in slow motion.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A blade formed by space slashed across, and a sword wound appeared on the black-robed old man’s body. Blood flowed out, and his body was almost cut in half.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>How could Lu Ming let go of such an opportunity? with a loud roar, he used the divine sword technique to attack the other party’s soul.</p><p>When Lu Ming had broken through to the second stage of the half-Saint realm, his soul had been tempered and he had finally broken through the limit. Now, Lu Ming’s soul force was equivalent to that of an expert in the initial bright Saint realm.</p><p>Even if his soul power was not as strong as the black-robed elder’s, he could still affect his opponent to a certain extent when he used the divine sword technique.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming had already appeared beside the old man. Under the old man’s shocked gaze, he threw a punch at the old man’s head.</p><p>The old man’s head exploded like a watermelon.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s claw pierced through the black-robed elder’s dantian and pulled out his Saint heart.</p><p>His Saint heart was as black as ink, like a diamond. It was crystal clear and filled with demonic Dao laws.</p><p>The Saint heart of a Saint was a treasure that could be used to refine pills or weapons. It was very expensive in the market. Lu Ming kept it.</p><p>As for the black-robed old man, he couldn’t be more dead.</p><p>An expert in the great mastery of the bright Saint realm was killed in just a few moments by the combined forces of Lu Ming, the clone, and bubbles.</p><p>Of course, this was because the three of them worked well together. If Lu Ming was alone, his combat strength would not be much different from the other party. It would be impossible to kill him. At most, he would have the upper hand.</p><p>The Saint realm Masters of the native races were terrified and retreated.</p><p>This included the other three who had attained the great mastery of the bright Saint realm.</p><p>They had been fighting the other heaven’s favorites with all their might, but when they saw this, they felt a chill run down their spines.</p><p>After not seeing him for half a year, Lu Ming had killed a person in the initial bright Saint realm with a single punch. He could even kill someone in the greater bright Saint realm. This was too terrifying.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not linger in the battle. He took the opportunity to break out of the encirclement.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>At this moment, a deafening roar came from behind them. A thin figure flew over at extreme speed. It was the powerhouse at the peak of the bright Saint stage.</p><p>Back in the tomb of the reincarnation Emperor, this person was injured by the power of the law of a large tomb and his origin was injured. During this period of time, he hid not far away to recuperate. When he heard the commotion, Lu Ming and the others had already broken out of the encirclement.</p><p>“All of you, enter the mountain and river diagram!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and summoned the mountain and river diagram, storing everyone else into it.</p><p>Even if he teamed up with bubbles and his second form, he would still not be a match for an expert at the peak of the bright Saint stage. In the Saint realm, every step forward would increase one’s combat strength by several times. The difference was huge.</p><p>After keeping the others, the bubble opened a space-time Tunnel and Lu Ming stepped into it. The next moment, he was already tens of thousands of miles away.</p><p>After bubble had comprehended the spacetime laws, all aspects of her had naturally improved rapidly. The distance of the spacetime tunnel had also increased by several times.</p><p>Tens of thousands of miles away, the bubble opened another space-time Tunnel and Lu Ming appeared tens of thousands of miles away again. After three consecutive times, Lu Ming was already a hundred thousand miles away.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
