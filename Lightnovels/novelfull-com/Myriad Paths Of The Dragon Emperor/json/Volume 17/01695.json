In the blink of an eye, they had exchanged hundreds of moves.</p><p>At this moment, everyone at the scene was no longer shocked but numb. They were numb to Lu Ming’s combat strength.</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength had exceeded their imagination.</p><p>They had never heard of a person in the second stage of the half-Saint realm being able to fight a Saint in the upper tier of the bright Saint realm. Furthermore, the opponent was a monstrous figure.</p><p>Everyone’s attention was focused on the final outcome of this battle.</p><p>Everyone held their breath and clenched their fists tightly. They watched nervously without blinking.</p><p>They understood that this battle was destined to be recorded in the history books of the Azure continent. It could be called a pinnacle battle.</p><p>Lu Ming’s main body was surrounded by 36 holy weapons and he held the chaos Empyrean seal in his hand. He looked like a god of War. The divine Son had a giant floating tower above his head and held the spear of divine punishment in his hand. He was covered in holy light armor and looked like the son of a God.</p><p>The two of them fought in the air and exchanged more than a dozen moves.</p><p>At this point, the Son of God’s heart started to get a little anxious.</p><p>Given his realm, he was already shocked to the core that he could not take down Lu Ming even now.</p><p>“Lu Ming must die. If this goes on, I’ll be no match for him in a few years!”</p><p>An idea that even the divine Son himself found hard to accept popped up in his mind. However, he knew that it was the truth. That was why he had to kill Lu Ming today.</p><p>“Holy light sword!”</p><p>The Son of God shouted. A snow-white combat sword flew out from his forehead. As soon as it appeared, sword Qi shot up into the sky and stirred up the wind and clouds.</p><p>“Great saint weapon, damn it!”</p><p>The purple dragon Valley master shouted angrily.</p><p>The others in Dragon God Valley were also shocked.</p><p>The Divine Child had actually refined a great sage weapon.</p><p>A great saint weapon was much stronger than an ordinary bright Saint weapon. It was the exclusive Saint weapon of a great saint.</p><p>Originally, Lu Ming and the divine Son were evenly matched. However, with the great saint weapon, the balance was probably going to be broken.</p><p>“Holy light sword, slash!”</p><p>The Son of God put away the spear in his hand and wielded the Holy Light sword. With a slash, a terrifying sword light was sent flying towards Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This sword struck the chaos sky-turning seal that was bombarding him. The chaos sky-turning seal trembled violently and then exploded in the air.</p><p>Then, the divine Son stepped forward with his sword and slashed at Lu Ming again.</p><p>The Black Dragon Spear in Lu Ming’s hands swept out horizontally, sweeping towards the other party.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The Holy Light sword struck the Black Dragon Spear, causing it to shake violently. Lu Ming could feel a terrifyingly sharp aura surging towards him, and he could not help but retreat.</p><p>The Holy Light sword did not stop and continued to slash at him. With a single thought, Lu Ming used the surrounding holy weapons to block in front of him. They were all defensive weapons.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The Holy weapons trembled, and a few of them were sent flying. Lu Ming had to retreat to block the opponent’s attack.</p><p>The divine Son had taken out his great saint weapon and his combat strength had increased greatly. Lu Ming was already at a disadvantage.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The Son of God wielded his sword and charged at Lu Ming again.</p><p>Lu Ming’s holy weapon danced around him as he activated the Qi of his combat weapon to fight his opponent.</p><p>After the series of battles, Lu Ming stopped using the chaos sky-turning seal.</p><p>Although the power of the chaos sky-turning seal was strong, the consumption was too great. If he continued to use it, he would definitely run out of genuine Yuan.</p><p>Kill!</p><p>The divine Son bellowed. His killing intent was wild as he launched a storm of attacks at Lu Ming.</p><p>It was already a great humiliation to him that he had not killed Lu Ming since the start of the battle. He had to kill Lu Ming as soon as possible.</p><p>Lu Ming used the ten thousand soldiers art to block it, but his figure kept retreating. He was being suppressed by the divine Son.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>After Lu Ming blocked the divine son’s sword, he soared into the sky.</p><p>“You want to leave? you can’t!”</p><p>kill him! the divine Son said coldly. He rose into the sky and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Who said I’m leaving?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was heard. At this moment, Lu Ming’s glabella glowed and a figure walked out.</p><p>Second body inscription!</p><p>As soon as his second body appeared, the Taichi formation disk floated in the air, and a Taichi diagram crushed down toward the divine Son.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming’s main body attacked as well. He looked down from above and became one with his spear, turning into a dazzling spear light that swooped down toward the divine Son.</p><p>The Tai Chi disk array had the power to seal and destroy. It floated above him, trying to seal and destroy the Divine Child.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The attack from Lu Ming’s main body arrived, and the Spear’s gleam pierced the space between the divine son’s eyebrows.</p><p>Holy light burst forth from the divine son’s body. With a loud roar, he slashed out with his sword, cutting Lu Ming’s spear light.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Son of God’s body fell.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Ming Lian’s second body controlled the Taichi formation disk and continued to suppress the Son of God. At the same time, he activated the law of formation Dao. Countless runes spread out, forming a sword that slashed down at the Son of God.</p><p>Lu Ming’s main body continued to attack.</p><p>The main body and the second body joined forces, not giving the Son of God any chance to breathe.</p><p>Everyone at the scene was dumbfounded.</p><p>Why were there two Lu Ming’s at the scene?</p><p>how audacious! You’re actually fighting two against one. You’ve already broken the rules!</p><p>The Supreme Sage of the heavenly God sect shouted with a cold look in his eyes.</p><p>“Are you blind? I can’t tell. The two Lu Mings have the same aura. They’re clearly the same person. This is just a secret technique!”</p><p>Although the purple dragon Valley master was also shocked, he sneered and retorted the Supreme Sage of the heavenly God sect.</p><p>that’s right. It’s just a secret technique. Two people are actually one person, just like a clone. What’s wrong with that? if you’re so capable, ask the Divine Child to use a clone too!</p><p>Tian Chui spoke.</p><p>“Hmph, the elders are talking, and it’s your turn to interrupt, you little brat. You don’t know your place!”</p><p>The great sage of the heavenly God sect waved his sleeves and turned his head away coldly without saying a word.</p><p>Indeed, the aura of Lu Ming’s main body and his second body were exactly the same, and so were the soul fluctuations. They were clearly the same person, just like a clone, but they were many times more brilliant than a clone.</p><p>It was unbelievable that two bodies could cultivate different cultivation techniques and comprehend different laws.</p><p>No matter what, since it was the same person, it was not against the rules.</p><p>And asking the Divine Child to use a clone was a joke. A clone’s strength was only a few percent of the real body’s. Furthermore, using a clone technique at this time would only weaken the real body’s battle prowess, which was not a wise decision.</p><p>Lu Ming took the main body and then the second, launching a series of attacks. His attacks were like a storm, not giving the divine Son a chance to catch his breath.</p><p>The situation had completely reversed.</p><p>Now, it was the divine Son who was at a disadvantage. Lu Ming kept on attacking.</p><p>“Could it be that the Divine Child is going to lose?”</p><p>“No way, if he’s not a Saint, he’s going to kill a Saint?”</p><p>“Oh my God, this is too terrifying!”</p><p>Many people couldn’t hide the shock in their hearts and exclaimed.</p><p>Lu Ming, I didn’t expect you to force the Divine Child to this extent. No wonder I lost to you in the divine wilderness continent, and the Xie family lost to you. However, this is not enough. The Divine Child still has a secret technique that he has not used!</p><p>Xie nianjun murmured in surprise.</p><p>Lu Ming’s main body and secondary body continuously launched attacks. They coordinated with each other and their power increased greatly.</p><p>“Son of God, is that all you’ve got? Looks like you’ll be the one to die today!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. Although he said that, he did not dare to be careless at all. He was on full alert.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
