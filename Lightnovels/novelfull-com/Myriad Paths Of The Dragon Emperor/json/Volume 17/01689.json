Many people had obtained points and would not give up easily unless they encountered the top ten geniuses. Only then would they admit defeat.</p><p>One match after another.</p><p>Without a doubt, the top ten geniuses had admitted defeat without even making a move.</p><p>In this round, Xue ningxin’s luck was not good. She had met Wang Jian, one of the top ten geniuses, and had no choice but to admit defeat.</p><p>As for Tian Chui, his luck wasn’t bad. He had met another person of the same rank and defeated his opponent, obtaining two points.</p><p>When all thirty matches in the second round ended, another sixteen people were eliminated, leaving only forty-four people who could continue to participate in the competition.</p><p>As for Dragon God Valley, there were still seven people, and they were still in first place.</p><p>Then, the third round began.</p><p>Lu Ming did not know if his luck was good or bad this round. He actually encountered another person at the first stage of the semi-sage realm. His opponent did not admit defeat. As soon as the battle began, he rushed to the edge of the fighting ring. Lu Ming did not pursue him and let his opponent rush off the fighting ring.</p><p>In this way, Lu Ming easily obtained three points.</p><p>Zi Feng, of course, also won, also obtaining three points.</p><p>However, Tian Chui’s luck had come to an end. In this round, he had also encountered one of the ten great monstrous talents, and it was Mo Yang.</p><p>Tian Chui directly admitted defeat, causing Mo Yang to coldly snort.</p><p>Tian Chui had mocked Mo Yang many times. If Tian Chui did not admit defeat, Mo Yang would definitely kill him.</p><p>After the third round of the competition ended, there were only thirty people left.</p><p>As time went on, the number of people would get smaller and smaller. So, in theory, each of the eighty people would have to fight eighty battles, but in reality, there was no need to fight so many battles.</p><p>The fourth round only had 30 people to battle.</p><p>These 30 people could be said to have very strong cultivation.</p><p>All the first stage half-Saints had been eliminated. The remaining ones were in the second stage.</p><p>Of course, the others did not know Lu Ming’s exact cultivation level as he had been using the illusionary breath technique to conceal it.</p><p>Po yuangui continued to draw lots.</p><p>This round of battle was undoubtedly even more intense. Many people had similar cultivation levels, so they naturally wouldn’t admit defeat easily. The battle was extremely intense.</p><p>Perhaps it was luck, but the top ten geniuses still didn’t meet each other in this round. Instead, they each defeated their opponent.</p><p>In this round, Lu Ming encountered an opponent at the second stage of the semi-sage realm. Naturally, the opponent would not admit defeat. He fought with Lu Ming. Lu Ming deliberately entangled himself with the opponent for dozens of moves before he finally knocked the opponent off the fighting ring.</p><p>When this round ended, there were only twenty-six people left.</p><p>Dragon God Valley was still in the lead.</p><p>“Hmph, that Lu Ming won’t be arrogant for long!”</p><p>Someone from the heavenly Divine sect said unhappily.</p><p>Then, the fifth round, the sixth round …</p><p>Slowly, the number of people decreased.</p><p>After the eighth round ended, there were only 18 people left.</p><p>Lu Ming’s luck was surprisingly good. He had not encountered any of the top ten geniuses and had won all the way, obtaining eight points.</p><p>And the top ten geniuses did not meet each other.</p><p>At this moment, the ninth round began.</p><p>“Wang Jian, Mo Yang!”</p><p>At this moment, po yuangui’s voice rang out, causing many people’s hearts to tremble.</p><p>Finally, was the top ten geniuses going to clash?</p><p>The main event was here.</p><p>Now, there were only 18 people left, including nine of the top ten geniuses. They would definitely meet.</p><p>The next part was the truly exciting part of the treasure sealing Convention.</p><p>Before this, the top ten geniuses had all swept the others and each of them had obtained eight points.</p><p>However, some people’s points would stop increasing, while others would continue to increase. The gap between the total points of the ten great sects would widen.</p><p>Wang Jian and Mo Yang stepped onto the fighting ring and looked at each other.</p><p>Mo Yang, three years ago, you were no match for me. This time, you are no match for me either!</p><p>Wang Jian said as sword Qi shot up into the sky from his body.</p><p>Wang Jian was the peerless genius of the jiuxiao sword sect. He was extremely powerful and his swordsmanship was unparalleled.</p><p>Three years ago, before Luo shuihan had risen to power, Wang Jian had been ranked second among the top ten geniuses and had competed with the divine Son. Unfortunately, three years ago, not only had he been defeated by the divine Son, but he had also been defeated by Luo shuihan, dropping to third place.</p><p>“How would you know if you don’t fight? I will defeat you in this battle!”</p><p>I’ll go! Mo Yang said. Demonic Qi surged from his body like a demonic god.</p><p>When the judge announced the start of the match, the two of them moved at the same time.</p><p>“Sword quaking the nine Heavens!”</p><p>“World devil howl!”</p><p>The two of them were old rivals. The moment they attacked, they used their full strength. There was nothing to test. They fought intensely. Laws filled the battle stage. Booming sounds rang out continuously, and terrifying collisions occurred.</p><p>All around, everyone was watching intently. Many people were shocked and amazed by the two’s combat strength.</p><p>However, Lu Ming lost interest after looking at it for a while.</p><p>He had seen this level of battle-power many times in the hundred clan battlefield and had no interest in it.</p><p>Mo Yang and Wang Jian exchanged more than a hundred moves. In the end, Wang Jian gained the upper hand and defeated Mo Yang, continuing his victory.</p><p>Of course, Mo Yang had been defeated, but he could still continue to fight.</p><p>Mo Yang’s face was cold as he returned to the stands, and the competition continued.</p><p>After the next two matches, another heavyweight showdown came.</p><p>It was another battle between the top ten geniuses.</p><p>Zi Feng versus the heaven seat King’s monstrous genius, Wang zicong.</p><p>This great battle could be said to be evenly matched. The two people fought fiercely for several hundred moves. In the end, Zi Feng won by a slight move and obtained victory.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Lu Yuan!”</p><p>Po yuangui’s voice sounded.</p><p>“Lu Yuan, a member of the heavenly God sect!”</p><p>Lu Ming was finally energized. He took a step forward and appeared on the fighting ring.</p><p>Finally, he had encountered another heaven’s favorite of the tianshen sect.</p><p>Lu Yuan stepped onto the fighting ring and stood opposite Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming, it seems that senior brother Luo shuihan doesn’t need to do anything. You’ll die by my hands!</p><p>Lu Yuan’s gaze was cold. His entire body emitted a cold metallic luster, and his aura was extremely powerful.</p><p>Lu Yuan’s combat strength was very strong. He also had a superior earth spiritual body. His cultivation had reached the third stage of the half-Saint realm, where the laws could affect him.</p><p>In the Azure region, he was second only to the top ten geniuses.</p><p>In fact, out of the 18 people left, nine of them were geniuses, while the other nine were second only to the top ten geniuses. They were all top geniuses and were eyeing the top ten geniuses covetously.</p><p>“You talk too much nonsense!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>When the judge announced the start of the match, Lu Yuan roared and charged at Lu Ming. The metallic luster on his body became even more intense. It was as if he had turned into a piece of metal.</p><p>What he cultivated was not the core cultivation technique of the tianshen sect, the sacred light technique. It was only because his spiritual body did not match the requirements, but it was still extremely terrifying.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and it collided with Lu Yuan’s.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>It was as if two pieces of iron had collided. Lu Yuan’s body trembled and he took a few steps back with loud bangs. Of course, Lu Ming also took a few steps back symbolically.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
