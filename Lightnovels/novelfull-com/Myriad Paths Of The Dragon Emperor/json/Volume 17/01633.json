He roared and his body burst into a shocking black light. He seemed to have turned into a large cauldron. He waved his hands and bombarded the chaos sky-turning seal.</p><p>...</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The young man in Black’s body was sent flying like a cannonball. He coughed up a mouthful of blood in the air, and many of the bone armor on his body broke like fried beans.</p><p>“Nine Cauldrons, combine into one!”</p><p>The young man in Black roared and the black light on his body became even more intense. The auras of the nine Cauldrons sealed by the gate of sealing grew stronger and broke through the seal of the gate of sealing in one fell swoop. They flew towards the young man in Black and then combined into one.</p><p>“What a tenacious life force!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>This young man’s combat strength was very shocking. It was as if he had nurtured a huge cauldron in the depths of his body. The power of laws was also very terrifying. His combat strength was even stronger than young master blood prison’s.</p><p>Lu Ming was notorious for killing young master of blood prison and injuring the assassins of thousand kills mansion. Therefore, among the four people who came to deal with Lu Ming, he was undoubtedly the most powerful.</p><p>The young man in Black combined the nine Cauldrons into one and rushed into it. The aura of the cauldron became even more violent as it charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming grabbed the Black Dragon Spear at the side and thrust it forward.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The Black Dragon Spear struck the cauldron and bent. Lu Ming was sent flying backward by a powerful and terrifying force.</p><p>“What powerful strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was somewhat solemn.</p><p>The other party’s physique was obviously special. When combined with the cauldron, his entire person seemed to be a cauldron, and the nine Cauldrons seemed to be the fusion of nine Saint weapons. The power was amazing.</p><p>Now that the black-clothed young man had merged with the cauldron, he was practically invincible.</p><p>Lu Ming let go of the Black Dragon Spear and allowed the twelve holy weapons to float around him as a form of defense. Lu Ming’s essential core surged into the flowing essence gloves.</p><p>At the same time, his third Blood Meridian emerged and a surge of energy surged into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Although the cloud Dragon Valley master had warned Lu Ming not to use his third bloodline as much as possible, it should be fine for him to use it once in a while and borrow a small amount of power.</p><p>The influx of the third bloodline’s energy made Lu Ming even more powerful. Dragon roars burst out from his body as he unleashed the prison suppressing heavenly art and threw a punch.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The fist landed on the cauldron, causing a terrifying shockwave. The sound waves spread out at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The cauldron trembled and was sent flying by Lu Ming, but Lu Ming’s body also retreated.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and threw another punch.</p><p>The cauldron shook and continued to crash toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>Then, the two of them continued to collide and exchanged dozens of blows.</p><p>At this moment, the inscription clone and the bubbles worked together to suppress the opponent.</p><p>The second body was refined with the Tai Chi formation disk as the main, turning into the Yin Yang fish sword, which had amazing destructive power.</p><p>At the same time, the various arrays and Phoenix Feather flying swords were also extremely profound. With the help of the bubble spacetime domain, although the opponent was strong, he was restrained in the battle and completely suppressed by the minglian clone.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The Yin Yang fish sword slashed out, almost cutting the other party into two, leaving a deep wound that was bleeding.</p><p>“That Lu Ming, how can he have such strong combat abilities? You should die!”</p><p>Zhao Kuang, who was watching the battle from afar, let out a low roar.</p><p>“Even Xia ding was unable to do anything to him!” Sima Liang also said in disbelief.</p><p>Xia ding was the black-robed young man who controlled the nine Cauldrons.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was beyond his imagination.</p><p>One person could actually split into two, and each of them had terrifying combat strength.</p><p>At their level, Xia ding was an extremely terrifying heaven’s favorite. None of them were his match. However, Lu Ming alone was able to fight him, and the other Lu Ming was able to completely suppress him.</p><p>fortunately, Huang Ling is about to be defeated. As long as Huang Ling is defeated, the two of them will join forces to fight Lu Ming. No matter how strong he is, he will still be defeated!</p><p>Sima Liang continued.</p><p>At this moment, Huang Ling was indeed in danger.</p><p>Her entire body seemed to have turned into a blazing Phoenix. Flames filled the sky as she unleashed her strength to the extreme.</p><p>However, she was no match for two powerful enemies of the same level. She was injured in many places. If it wasn’t for her undying celestial phoenix body, she would have been seriously injured long ago. Even so, if this continued, she would only be defeated.</p><p>I have the undying celestial phoenix body, the undying celestial Phoenix. I’m one of the top ten Battle Beasts. How can I lose? ”</p><p>The Phoenix Spirit let out a long cry like a phoenix. Her eyes were filled with madness, and the flames on her body became even more terrifying as she fought with her opponent.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Her body had been pierced through, leaving a huge hole in it. However, she didn’t care about it. The undying flames spread out, and the huge hole automatically healed.</p><p>She killed madly, not caring about her own injuries, not caring about defense, only focusing on attacking.</p><p>At this moment, Ming Lian’s second body followed up with another attack. Together with the bubbles, they unleashed a terrifying technique.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>His chest was pierced by the Yin Yang fish sword, and the terrifying destructive power kept destroying his spirit body, causing him to cough up blood.</p><p>“Quickly come and help me!”</p><p>The man roared.</p><p>“Hold on a little longer!”</p><p>One of the prodigies who was fighting against the Phoenix Spirit said. They wanted to defeat the Phoenix Spirit in one fell swoop and then deal with Lu Ming.</p><p>However, the Phoenix Spirit undying Heavenly Phoenix body wasn’t just for show. The other party couldn’t take down bi Lin at all.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The heaven’s favorites who were heavily injured didn’t dare to continue fighting and retreated.</p><p>The four of them came from different forces. They decided to work together to fight for the map and key of the tomb of the Samsara King. But now, his life was in danger. How could he fight to the death?</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>He took a few steps back and left.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The others roared.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Ming Lian’s second body rushed toward Huang Ling’s battlefield, and the Yin Yang fish sword slashed at one of the beautiful women.</p><p>Huang Ling’s pressure was greatly reduced. She launched a violent attack on one of them and was actually at a disadvantage.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s main body had already exchanged dozens of blows with Xia ding.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Another earth-shattering boom rang out as the cauldron trembled violently and retreated. Xia ding’s figure then fell out from within.</p><p>He had to pay a huge price to use this move. Now, he could not hold on any longer.</p><p>“Let’s forget about it this time, let’s go!”</p><p>Xia ding roared as he took the cauldron and retreated, disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p><p>When the remaining two saw this, they knew that they had lost the battle. They charged forward with all their might. After paying a price, they also charged out and disappeared.</p><p>The four powerful cultivators were defeated by Lu Ming and Huang Ling.</p><p>The surrounding spectators gasped in shock.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
