If they all died here, the Phoenix Palace would suffer a great loss.</p><p>She was the Phoenix Palace’s saintess, so she had to be saved.</p><p>...</p><p>“I’ll go with you!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“You’re coming with me?”</p><p>Huang Ling was stunned.</p><p>“An extra person, an extra helper, why? Are you touched?”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Many thanks!”</p><p>Huang Ling cupped her fists.</p><p>alright, then let’s set off to the Alliance mountain. This is also a training experience, but this time, our opponents have changed to Saints!</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heroically. Then, his vital essence burst forth and killed the local half-Saint. After that, Lu Ming, Huang Ling, and Huang Xuan headed for the Union mountain.</p><p>Huang Ling had been in the hundred clan battlefield for a long time, so she naturally knew where the Alliance mountain was.</p><p>Alliance mountain was the place where all the races of the hundred clan battlefield gathered.</p><p>Every once in a while, the various races of the hundred tribe battlefield would gather at the Alliance mountain to discuss matters.</p><p>A day later, the three of them had already covered a long distance.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, a violent explosion came from the front. The sky rumbled loudly, and the sky was filled with lightning.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Following that, there was a roar and a sword Qi that broke through the air and shot into the clouds.</p><p>There, a terrifying battle was taking place.</p><p>“Let’s go take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The three of them concealed their auras and flew into the sky.</p><p>The fluctuations in front of him were very shocking. There were two mighty beams of saintly might that filled the sky.</p><p>“It’s him, ye Dongfang!”</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming saw the people engaged in a great battle.</p><p>One of them was ye Dongfang.</p><p>In addition, there were two experts besieging ye Dongfang. One of them was a giant lizard-like beast with bone spikes all over its body. It was the beast that had fought with Lu Ming outside the tomb of the Samsara Emperor.</p><p>The other one was a human Saint.</p><p>He was an existence at the initial bright Saint realm.</p><p>In reality, it was extremely difficult to break through to the Saint realm in the hundred clan battlefield. As a result, most of the Saints in the hundred clan battlefield were initial bright Saints.</p><p>“You can’t escape. Today, you must die!”</p><p>The giant lizard beast roared and its claws were like mountains as it attacked ye Dongfang.</p><p>The human saint’s sword light bloomed, and it was extremely terrifying. He kept slashing at ye Dongfang.</p><p>Ye Dongfang was strong, but he was no match for two saints alone. He was in a bad shape, his hair disheveled, his body covered in blood, and his breath weak.</p><p>He let out a long roar as if he had transformed into a God of Thunder. Terrifying power of Thunder filled the air, and the laws of Thunder burst forth as he fought with the two saints.</p><p>The thick lightning sometimes swept across a mountain, and the mountain would directly collapse.</p><p>However, a Saint was just as terrifying. His Saint power was unparalleled. With one strike, he could obliterate the power of the lightning laws.</p><p>“Save ye Dongfang!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Huang Ling nodded.</p><p>Ye Dongfang was a decent man, and they were still too weak to go to the Meng mountains. If they could get ye Dongfang to help them, they would be even stronger.</p><p>leave the giant lizard to me. You and ye Dongfang will deal with the human warrior!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The Phoenix Spirit nodded and let Huang Xuan stay here. Huang Xuan could not interfere in a battle of this level.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>Lu Ming activated the thundering wind steps. With a flash of wind and thunder, his figure dashed out rapidly towards the giant lizard beast.</p><p>The Black Dragon Spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hands and he flung it out abruptly. Like a bolt of lightning, it tore through the air and stabbed at the giant lizard beast.</p><p>Lu Ming’s spirit body was very powerful now. When he threw the spear, it was covered with the ultimate Chaos Domain. The terrifying sound of the spear breaking through the air made the giant lizard beast feel frightened.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The giant lizard beast roared and ignored ye Dongfang. It slapped the Black Dragon Spear with its scale-covered palm.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The Black Dragon Spear pierced through the scales on the giant lizard beast’s claws, all the way to the handle.</p><p>The giant lizard beast’s palm was bleeding profusely. It let out an explosive roar, and at this moment, Lu Ming had already arrived.</p><p>“It’s you!”</p><p>The giant lizard beast roared angrily, a hint of fear in its eyes.</p><p>He was very clear about Lu Ming’s combat strength.</p><p>“This time, I’ll kill you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. A chaos sky-turning stamp formed in his palm and suppressed the lizard beast.</p><p>The giant lizard roared and fought back with all its might. However, after colliding with the primal Chaos heaven flipping seal, its huge body trembled and it retreated continuously.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. A chaos sky-turning stamp appeared in each of his hands and he smashed it at the giant lizard beast.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two consecutive attacks made it difficult for the giant lizard to stand in the air. It was smashed to the ground, causing dust to fly everywhere.</p><p>On the other side, Lu Ming’s participation jolted ye Dongfang’s spirit. The power of lightning spread all over his body, and he focused all his attention on the human Saint.</p><p>At this time, Huang Ling had also arrived and joined forces with ye Dongfang. The human Saint was immediately at a disadvantage.</p><p>“You’re the one who’s going to die today!”</p><p>Ye Dongfang seemed like he was going to explode with anger. He attacked the human Saint like a storm. With the help of Huang Ling, the human Saint was hit by a bolt of lightning. Even his Saint power protection was penetrated, and he spat out blood.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The human Saint shouted angrily and wanted to retreat. However, neither Huang Ling nor ye Dongfang was weaker than him. He couldn’t get out at the moment.</p><p>On the other side, Lu Ming had already completely suppressed the giant lizard beast. He rushed onto the back of the giant lizard beast and used the prison suppression heaven technique. His vital essence surged into the flowing essence gloves in a frenzy and blasted the back of the giant lizard beast.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>As the punch landed, scales flew everywhere and a huge hole was blasted on the back of the giant lizard beast. Even its bone armor was broken. Its huge body heavily smashed into the ground, creating a huge pit.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The giant lizard beast howled in pain. Its Saint energy condensed into a terrifying attack, trying to blast Lu Ming off its back.</p><p>At this moment, more than ten holy weapons appeared on Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Like the black wings, a shield holy weapon blocked the lizard beast’s attack. Lu Ming grabbed a holy weapon sword and stabbed it into the wound on the lizard beast. The sword Qi exploded and pierced deep into the lizard beast’s body. Then, Lu Ming’s power burst out and he cut horizontally.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>The giant lizard beast’s body was almost cut in half, and blood flowed all over the ground.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The giant lizard beast roared as its huge body rolled on the ground.</p><p>Lu Ming soared into the sky. In the sky, an exceptionally huge chaos sky-turning seal condensed.</p><p>This was the chaos sky-turning seal at its full power.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The 100% power of the primal Chaos sky-turning seal pressed down on the giant lizard beast and smashed into it.</p><p>Although the giant lizard beast tried its best to counterattack, it was useless. It was already severely injured, so how could it block the 100% power of the chaos sky-turning seal?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
