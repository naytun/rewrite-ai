Why were these young geniuses fighting here?</p><p>Lu Ming, Darkwater city is one of the four largest cities in the hundred clan battlefield. The local powerhouses in this city are very powerful. I’m afraid there are powerhouses at the peak of the bright Saint realm in charge!</p><p>...</p><p>Huang Ling explained.</p><p>The natives had grown up in the hundred clan battlefield, so they had adapted to the chaotic laws of the hundred clan battlefield. Some of the extremely talented ones could cultivate to the Saint realm.</p><p>However, the strongest could only be at the bright Saint realm.</p><p>A peak bright Saint was almost the strongest existence in the hundred clan battlefield.</p><p>a peak bright Saint is too powerful. With my strength, I’m afraid I won’t be able to fight back against a peak bright Saint. Therefore, almost no one dares to make a move in Darkwater city. However, there’s only one Asura platform, and the supply is in short supply. Therefore, many heaven’s pride experts will fight outside the city!</p><p>Huang Ling continued to explain.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. This was very easy to understand.</p><p>Outside the city, the native experts would not care.</p><p>Lu Ming and Huang Ling’s arrival attracted many people’s attention. Many people looked at the two of them.</p><p>When most of the people saw Feng Ling, their expressions changed, revealing a serious and fearful look.</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself that it seemed that Huang Ling was very famous in Darkwater city and had a lot of deterrence.</p><p>It seemed like the heavenly spiritual body was a terrifying existence even in the depths of the hundred clan battlefield.</p><p>Of course, there were also many people who looked at Lu Ming in surprise.</p><p>a Lv 9 martial Royal realm martial artist dares to come to Darkwater city. It’s rare!</p><p>any Lv 9 martial Royal realm expert who dares to come to Darkwater city is a person with extremely strong combat strength and is extremely confident in his own combat strength. This man is with Huang Ling. Could he also be a person with extremely strong combat strength? ”</p><p>“This, it’s hard to say. Some whose combat strength is not strong enough will also come here to see the world!”</p><p>Some people looked at Lu Ming and discussed in low voices.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>At this moment, a young man stepped on the void, causing the void to thump loudly. He arrived in front of Lu Ming, and the aura of the peak of the ninth level Martial Emperor realm emanated from his body.</p><p>The powerful aura locked onto Lu Ming.</p><p>it’s Huang Qi. This guy has his eyes on that Lv 9 martial Royal realm expert!</p><p>Huang Qi’s combat strength is very strong. With his cultivation at the peak of the ninth tier martial Royal realm, he once fought with an expert at the first stage of the semi-Saint realm for more than 100 moves before being defeated. It seems that he’s excited to see his prey!</p><p>Around them, someone spoke up with the mentality of watching a show.</p><p>a Lv 9 martial Royal realm martial artist who dares to come to Darkwater city must be very confident in his combat strength. Now, let’s fight. Holy Phoenix spirit, you won’t interfere, will you? ”</p><p>Huang Qi looked at Lu Ming with fighting spirit. His last sentence was directed at Huang Ling.</p><p>“As you wish!”</p><p>Huang Ling spread her hands casually and took a few steps back, indicating that she would not care. However, when she looked at Huang Qi, her eyes were filled with pity.</p><p>This guy actually challenged Lu Ming. He was really courting death. If he knew that Lu Ming had killed Wan Tiancheng, who knew what kind of expression he would make?</p><p>“You’re not my match!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>He was not interested in a ninth-level martial Royal realm martial artist at all. He did not have any training effect on himself. Lu Ming did not even bother to move.</p><p>Of course, he was speaking the truth. But in Huang Qi’s ears, he thought that Lu Ming was being arrogant.</p><p>presumptuous! I’ve even fought a half-Saint before. You’re just an early Lv 9 martial Royal realm martial artist, yet you’re so arrogant. We’ll know whether I’m your match after this battle!</p><p>Huang Qi’s gaze turned cold, and the aura on his body became stronger and stronger.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly turned cold.</p><p>That was because he felt a sharp Qi attacking his back at a terrifying speed.</p><p>Without thinking, Lu Ming suddenly turned around and threw a punch.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s punch landed on a longsword that was as thin as a cicada’s wing. A terrifying fist force exploded and a figure appeared out of thin air. The figure was sent flying by the fist force.</p><p>This figure was dressed in a black robe. His entire body was covered by the black robe, and only a pair of eyes were exposed, revealing a look of shock.</p><p>it’s the assassins from the thousand-kill mansion!</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The assassin from the thousand-kill mansion used his body technique and turned into a Phantom, flying away at high speed. His body exuded the aura of the ultimate domain. This assassin had the cultivation of the first stage of the half-Saint realm, which was almost the same as the two assassins who had killed Lu Ming.</p><p>“The assassination failed and you want to leave? did I allow you to?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. Wind and thunder Qi flashed on his body. With a hiss, Lu Ming’s body rushed out like a bolt of lightning, cutting through the void and chasing after the assassins from the thousand-kill mansion at an amazing speed.</p><p>The assassins of the house of a thousand kills were as fast as lightning. However, Lu Ming’s thundering wind steps had been cultivated to perfection. With the help of the air-frozen bead’s energy, his speed was even more amazing, far beyond the assassins of the house of a thousand kills.</p><p>Many people only saw a flash of lightning and Lu Ming’s figure appeared in the sky above the assassins from the house of thousand kills. Then, he stomped on the assassins.</p><p>Lu Ming had activated the prison-suppressing heavenly art with this kick. His entire being seemed to have turned into a huge prison-suppressing stele, suppressing everything.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This kick was so destructive that it destroyed all the attacks and defenses of the assassin from the thousand-kill mansion. Then, it stomped heavily on his head.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The other party’s head and body exploded in the air like a watermelon.</p><p>One move, dead!</p><p>This assassin was also a heaven’s favorite. He had a superior earth spiritual body and a cultivation base of the first stage of half-Saint. In the Azure region, although he could not be ranked among the top ten geniuses, he was still one of the stronger ones. However, he was killed by Lu Ming in an instant.</p><p>Lu Ming had been in the hundred clan battlefield for a few months. Unknowingly, his abilities had improved by leaps and bounds.</p><p>“What powerful battle strength!”</p><p>Many of the young heaven’s favorites in the surroundings were shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation was very clear. He was only at the early stage of the ninth level martial Royal realm. However, he had killed a first stage half-Saint genius with one move. This kind of combat strength was shocking.</p><p>Many of the people present were at the first stage of the half-Saint realm. They would probably end up the same if they encountered Lu Ming.</p><p>Some half-Saints in the second stage who had comprehended nomological laws looked very serious.</p><p>another heavenly spiritual body!</p><p>Someone said solemnly.</p><p>Even in Darkwater city, the center of the hundred tribe battlefield, there were not many heavenly spiritual bodies. Every one of them was extremely powerful.</p><p>The heavenly spiritual body was not as common as cabbages. Some of the monarch-level forces that did not have a strong fate might not even have a single heavenly spiritual body.</p><p>For example, there was no heavenly spiritual body in the Cang region. As far as Lu Ming knew, there was no heavenly spiritual body in the Cloud King Mountain.</p><p>Meanwhile, Huang Qi was completely stunned.</p><p>“Do you still want to continue fighting?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze turned to Huang Qi.</p><p>This simple sentence made Huang Qi’s face and ears turn red.</p><p>“I … I …”</p><p>Huang Qi stammered for a long time, but couldn’t say a word.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
