He’s just an early Lv 6 martial Royal realm martial artist with an ordinary physique. What else can he do other than using a life-saving spiritual talisman to escape?”</p><p>Luo shuihan sneered.</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming ignored Luo shuihan and looked at the fighting ring.</p><p>“I don’t know how to use a life-saving spirit talisman!”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying said.</p><p>“You’re not going to use your life-saving spirit talisman?”</p><p>The eyes of the heaven’s God sect’s genius lit up.</p><p>“No need, because I don’t need to use the life-saving spiritual talisman to deal with you!”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying said.</p><p>His words made the other party burst into laughter. Not only him, but many people from the tianshen sect and the Tian Yu demon sect also laughed.</p><p>An ordinary sixth level martial Royal realm cultivator with an ordinary spiritual body actually said that he didn’t need to use a life-saving spiritual talisman to deal with a heaven’s pride expert who was at least at the middle-grade earth spiritual body.</p><p>So arrogant, so presumptuous!</p><p>“If you don’t want to use the talisman, then go to hell!”</p><p>The heaven’s God sect’s Paragon said coldly. Holy light filled the air as he took a step forward. A sword of holy light appeared in his hand, and he slashed it towards Qiu Ying Ying.</p><p>But at this moment, in his eyes, Qiu Ying Ying had changed.</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying seemed to have disappeared from his sight, and the surrounding scene changed. In an instant, it turned into a purgatory.</p><p>Countless demons charged towards the heaven deity sect’s Paragon.</p><p>“How could this be? Get lost!”</p><p>The heaven’s God sect’s Paragon roared. Sword Qi swept out and slashed towards those evil demons. Those evil demons were continuously killed, but more and more evil demons pounced towards him.</p><p>He and the evil demon had a ‘fierce’ battle.</p><p>Of course, all of this was just what he had seen. At this moment, most of the people present were dumbfounded.</p><p>All they saw was the heaven’s God sect’s Paragon charging towards Qiu Ying Ying. However, when he was halfway there, he suddenly stopped and let out a strange roar. Then, he started to kill in the air.</p><p>And Qiu Ying Ying just stood there, not moving at all.</p><p>The battle between the heaven’s God sect’s paragons was incomparably intense. The other people at the scene were dumbfounded.</p><p>What was this old man doing?</p><p>Even the disciples of Dragon God Valley were dumbfounded.</p><p>At the scene, only two people had calm expressions.</p><p>One of them was Lu Ming, and the other was Qiu Hao.</p><p>Qiu Hao naturally knew that Qiu Ying Ying’s inheritance would allow her to cast an illusion.</p><p>“Junior Brother Lu Ming, you already knew about it!”</p><p>Zi Feng took a deep breath and looked at Lu Ming, who had a calm expression.</p><p>He finally knew why Lu Ming wanted Qiu Ying Ying to participate in the competition.</p><p>“Yes, senior brother, look down!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded slightly and smiled.</p><p>“Zhao Qi, what are you doing?”</p><p>Luo shuihan shouted from the stands of the divine sky sect. Her face was a little hot. What was this Zhao Qi doing?</p><p>However, his shout was completely useless. The heaven’s pride expert of the tianshen sect was still madly slashing at the air, his mouth constantly shouting things like ‘kill’ and ‘get lost’.</p><p>At this moment, Qiu Ying Ying took a light step forward, and a limpid sword appeared in her hand as she walked towards the other party.</p><p>It was as if the other party could not see Qiu Ying Ying at all as he randomly slashed out. However, each sword strike was unable to land on Qiu Ying Ying, and only landed beside her.</p><p>“Zhao Qi, what are you doing? Quickly retreat!”</p><p>“Quickly retreat!”</p><p>The people of the heavenly God sect shouted.</p><p>But it was useless. Zhao seventh didn’t seem to hear him.</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying came in front of Zhao Qi and stabbed him with her sword.</p><p>Zhao Qi had no reaction, and his dantian was pierced by Qiu Ying Ying’s sword.</p><p>At this time, Zhao Qi’s random attacks finally stopped. He stared at Qiu Yingying with his eyes wide open. He looked at the long sword that had pierced through his dantian and destroyed his spiritual soul. Blood kept spurting out of his mouth, and his eyes were full of disbelief.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying’s long sword shook, and Zhao seventh was sent flying far away. He was no longer breathing.</p><p>The entire place was silent.</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying’s attack was too strange, and Zhao seventh’s death was inexplicable.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>After a long while, the disciples of Dragon God Valley burst into cheers.</p><p>The people of the heavenly God sect, on the other hand, had gloomy expressions.</p><p>a person with an ordinary spiritual body at the early stage of the sixth level martial Royal realm can do this. He can easily kill the heaven’s pride expert of your tianshen sect. Did you see that? ”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Luo shuihan and said indifferently, his voice full of ridicule.</p><p>Luo shuihan gritted her teeth and her eyes were full of killing intent.</p><p>Just now, he was still saying that a person with an ordinary spiritual body at the early stage of the sixth level martial Royal realm could do nothing but use a spiritual talisman to save his life.</p><p>Now, the facts had proven that he was the one who could kill the heaven’s pride expert of the tianshen sect.</p><p>At this moment, it was a slap to his face.</p><p>I told you to cut the crap. Otherwise, you’ll only be slapping yourself in the face. Are you happy now? ”</p><p>Lu Ming continued.</p><p>Lu Ming, don’t be happy too early. The treasure locking party has not ended!</p><p>Luo shuihan said through gritted teeth.</p><p>“Then let’s continue watching!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>After Qiu Ying Ying killed her opponent, she returned to the platform.</p><p>After that, the Tianyu demonic sect and the Yudu sect challenged each other. They were more cautious and eliminated two more people from Dragon God Valley.</p><p>In this way, there were only ten people left from Dragon God Valley.</p><p>When it was Dragon God Valley’s turn, they did not continue to challenge the deity sect. Instead, they turned their attention to the Tian Yu demon sect and killed one of their disciples.</p><p>Soon, the ninth round ended, and the tenth round began.</p><p>From the tenth round onwards, no one challenged Qiu Ying Ying anymore, so she was left aside for now.</p><p>Another two rounds passed, and another six people were eliminated, leaving only four people.</p><p>They were the team leader, Qiu Ying Ying, su Lei, and a heaven’s favorite of Ice Dragon Valley.</p><p>Dragon God Valley had the least number of people.</p><p>why is this situation so similar to three years ago? dragon God Valley had the least number of people in the beginning, but in the end, they reversed the situation and made a comeback!</p><p>this time, will Dragon God Valley turn the tables? ”</p><p>Many people were discussing.</p><p>that’s impossible. Three years ago, there was Lu Ming in Dragon God Valley. But this time, it’s impossible for another Lu Ming to appear. Although Qiu Ying Ying’s methods are mysterious, she might be able to fight against a top heaven’s favorite.</p><p>that’s right. If we want to turn the tables like we did three years ago, we’ll have to be like Lu Ming. We’ll have to take turns to defeat everyone. Otherwise, there’s no hope!</p><p>While everyone was discussing, a new round began.</p><p>This time, the tianshen sect had sent a top expert to challenge them.</p><p>He was one of the four strongest people from the tianshen sect who had participated in the treasure auction. His name was Cai Ying. He was at the peak of the LV 6 martial Royal realm and had an upper-class earth spiritual body.</p><p>Cai Ying’s eyes swept across the four people of Dragon God Valley and finally fell on su Lei. She said, ” “Come down and fight!”</p><p>This time, the tianshen sect was very unyielding. They wanted to eliminate Dragon God Valley by taking turns to fight.</p><p>Su Lei’s cultivation was very strong, and her qi and blood were exuberant. She gave off a strong pressure. Before this, no one had challenged her.</p><p>Su Lei’s eyes lit up and she flew up to the fighting ring.</p><p>“You … Hello, I want … Why don’t we stop here?”</p><p>Su Lei said timidly.</p><p>These words made everyone else present look at each other.</p><p>Su Lei looked very strong, but why did she look like a ‘timid mouse’?</p><p>Cai Ying also smiled.</p><p>In this state, no matter how strong his cultivation was, what combat power could he have?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
