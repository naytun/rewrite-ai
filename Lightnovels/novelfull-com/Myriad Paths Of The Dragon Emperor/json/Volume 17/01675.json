He then left with the people of the tianshen sect.</p><p>...</p><p>As for the Yu Du sect and the Tian Yu demonic sect, they had also left quietly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you alright?”</p><p>The elder of the Dragon God Valley asked Lu Ming.</p><p>“Elder, I’m fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming answered helplessly.</p><p>yes, let’s go back first. In this time’s treasure sealing assembly, I’m afraid that we will still encounter the Joint Forces of the deity sect, the Yu Du sect, and a few other sects. You must be prepared!</p><p>The elder of Dragon God Valley said and then flew to the Dragon God Valley’s encampment.</p><p>Lu Ming, Tian Chui, Xue ningxin, and Zi Feng followed.</p><p>I’m afraid that Dragon God Valley will be in danger during the treasure auction in ten days!</p><p>Zi Feng sighed.</p><p>how many top-notch heaven’s favorites from Dragon God Valley are there in this treasure auction? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>The top heaven’s pride level he was talking about was those at the peak of the sixth level martial Royal realm with superior earth spiritual bodies. Only such heaven’s pride level experts could influence the outcome of the battle in the treasure determining party.</p><p>there’s only one person. He’s much worse than he was three years ago!</p><p>Zi Feng sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. In this case, Dragon God Valley was in danger.</p><p>The tianshen sect, the Yu Du sect, and the other sects would definitely target him during the treasure settlement ceremony. By then, Dragon God Valley would not have the power to resist him. It was very likely that they would not even be able to enter the top ten and would lose the qualification to participate in the treasure settlement ceremony.</p><p>senior brother Zi Feng, I recommend a person who is enough to suppress all the other top heaven’s favorites in the treasure auction!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he thought of su Lei.</p><p>Su Lei had obtained the inheritance from the ancestral land of Gusu city. Her mysterious Yin dragon body was extremely terrifying. Lu Ming estimated that in a battle of the same level, unless one had a heavenly spirit body, they would definitely not be su Lei’s match.</p><p>Su Lei’s participation was enough to suppress all the heroes!</p><p>he can suppress the other top-tier heaven’s favorites? ”</p><p>Zi Feng’s eyes brightened. There was actually such a heaven’s favorite in Dragon God Valley. How did he not know?</p><p>However, since Lu Ming said so, he must be confident.</p><p>“Alright, let’s change to another person!”</p><p>Zi Feng said.</p><p>The few of them chatted and soon returned to the Dragon God Valley base.</p><p>As soon as he returned to the Dragon God Valley base, Lu Ming ran into two familiar faces-the siblings, Qiu Yingying and Qiu Hao.</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying was very happy to see Lu Ming.</p><p>Yingying, congratulations. Your cultivation has reached the sixth level of the Martial Emperor realm!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying’s breakthrough speed was beyond Lu Ming’s expectations. She had already reached the sixth level Martial Emperor realm. One should know that Qiu Ying Ying was only an ordinary spirit body. It was shocking that she could achieve such a speed.</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying had once obtained an inheritance in the Emperor Cang secret realm. Perhaps it was related to this, Lu Ming thought.</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming gasped and stared at Qiu Ying Ying carefully.</p><p>“Lu … Lu Ming, What are you looking at?”</p><p>Being stared at by Lu Ming, Qiu Ying Ying blushed and said unnaturally.</p><p>senior brother Zi Feng, seventh senior brother, eighth Senior Sister, you can go back first. I have something to say to Yingying!</p><p>Lu Ming said to Zi Feng, Tian Chui, and the rest.</p><p>“Haha, Junior Brother, I understand, I understand. I’ll leave now!”</p><p>Tian Chui laughed out loud, revealing an “I understand” expression as he pulled Xue ningxin along and left.</p><p>Zi Feng smiled and left as well.</p><p>“Aiya, I forgot I have something important to do. You guys chat first, I’ll be leaving too!”</p><p>Qiu Hao smacked his head and winked at Qiu Ying Ying before flying up into the air and leaving the place.</p><p>Only Lu Ming and Qiu Yingying were left.</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying’s heart started to beat wildly. She did not dare to look at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming touched his nose and was rather speechless. It seemed that he had been misunderstood.</p><p>“Yingying, let’s go to the side and talk!”</p><p>Lu Ming said and walked to an empty space at the side.</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying’s heart was beating even faster, like a little deer.</p><p>“What did Lu Ming want to say to me? Does he like me …”</p><p>At this moment, Qiu Ying Ying’s mind was filled with all sorts of thoughts.</p><p>“Yingying, the inheritance you received back then, did it include a method to cultivate the soul?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked when they reached the empty space.</p><p>“Ah? Yes, that’s right!”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying was taken aback at first, but then she nodded.</p><p>It turned out that Lu Ming wanted to talk about this. It seemed that she was wrong. She did not know why, but she felt a sense of loss.</p><p>“As expected!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Lu Ming’s soul force was very strong. He had also cultivated the soul cultivation technique. When he sized up Qiu Ying Ying just now, he realized that Qiu Ying Ying’s soul force was exceptionally strong.</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying’s cultivation was at the sixth level Martial Emperor realm, but her soul power was far beyond that. It was even approaching the eighth level.</p><p>Such soul power was not something that an ordinary person could possess. Hence, Lu Ming immediately thought of the legacy that Qiu Ying Ying had obtained in the Emperor Cang secret realm.</p><p>“Yingying, the soul cultivation technique that you obtained, does it have any offensive techniques?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Yes, there is!”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying collected her thoughts and nodded.</p><p>“Use it, use it on me. I’ll feel it, use it with all your might!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Mm, okay!”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying nodded. She knew that Lu Ming was much stronger than her. Hence, she did not hold back.</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying’s eyes started to change. They turned pitch black. At this moment, Lu Ming realized that his surroundings had changed. It had become a purgatory.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>One by one, the purgatory demons charged out with furious roars and pounced on Lu Ming.</p><p>“It’s an illusion!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying’s soul attack was actually an illusion.</p><p>Using one’s own powerful soul power to influence the other party’s soul, causing the other party to hallucinate.</p><p>This kind of attack was mysterious and unpredictable, and extremely dangerous.</p><p>Once a person fell into an illusion, they would be at the mercy of others.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered softly. His soul force trembled slightly. The surrounding scene shattered like glass and returned to its original state.</p><p>Then, he saw Qiu Ying Ying’s body tremble as she retreated. Her eyes returned to normal, but her face was a little pale.</p><p>“Yingying, are you alright?”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and appeared beside Qiu Ying Ying. He asked with concern.</p><p>Lu Ming’s soul power was so powerful that with a slight vibration of his soul power, he had broken Qiu Ying Ying’s illusion. Even Qiu Ying Ying herself had suffered a backlash.</p><p>“I’m fine. It’s just that my soul force is a little shaken. Lu Ming, your soul force is so powerful!”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying said, her eyes filled with amazement.</p><p>Just now, when her soul force came into contact with Lu Ming’s soul force, she felt that Lu Ming’s soul force was like an endless ocean.</p><p>Yingying, your soul attack technique is very mysterious. I have another soul attack technique here that I can teach you. It will help your soul to advance to the eighth level of the Martial Emperor realm, or even higher. That way, no one below the high-level Martial Emperor realm in the Azure continent will be your opponent!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Really … Really?”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying said.</p><p>“Of course it’s real. Look at what this is.”</p><p>A demonic evil crystal appeared in Lu Ming’s hand.</p><p>“This is … Demonic evil crystal?”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying’s eyes lit up.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
