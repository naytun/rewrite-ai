How did he become so powerful three years later? even he, the number one genius of the Azure continent, could not fight back.</p><p>He couldn’t figure it out, but now, he only wanted to live.</p><p>In the past, when he was killing others, he acted high and mighty, looking down on others as if they were ants. But now that it was his turn, he finally understood how terrifying and terrifying he was.</p><p>“Let you off? is that even possible? Don’t you think it’s too funny?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently, his voice filled with disdain.</p><p>“Elder, elder, save me, save me!”</p><p>Luo shuihan cried out to the elders of the deity sect for help.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’d better let him go!”</p><p>An elder from the heavenly God sect spoke. The aura that was emitted from this elder was extremely shocking. The vast Saint might was constantly spreading out, filling the sky with a heavy pressure.</p><p>This was definitely a terrifying expert, far beyond the ordinary bright Saint realm. This was a Supreme Saint!</p><p>haha, what a joke. You were defeated in the treasure auction, and now you’re threatening me. You’re a great sage, but you’re really shameless!</p><p>In the Dragon God Valley area, the purple dragon Valley master stood up. He also exuded a terrifying aura, which was opposite to the Supreme Sage of the tianshen sect. The aura between heaven and earth became even more oppressive.</p><p>The face of the Supreme Saint of the heavenly God sect darkened.</p><p>He also knew that as a great saint, he had gone too far by interfering.</p><p>But Luo shuihan was very talented, second only to the divine Son.</p><p>If he didn’t die, he would definitely reach the Saint realm in the future. He might even reach the Supreme Saint realm or even the absolute Saint realm.</p><p>After so many years, how many absolute Saints did the heavenly God sect have?</p><p>There weren’t many absolute Saints in the entire Azure continent, and they had all been accumulated over the years.</p><p>It was definitely a huge loss to be killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Black Dragon Spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hands. The Spear’s radiance was shocking.</p><p>Luo shuihan, I’ll send you on your way!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>Luo shuihan was almost scared out of her wits. She struggled madly and screamed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’d better think twice!”</p><p>The Supreme Saint of the heavenly God sect said coldly.</p><p>“Think thrice? I only need to think twice before killing someone. Why do I need to think twice?”</p><p>yes, ” Lu Ming replied. The Black Dragon Spear pierced through Luo shuihan’s dantian and destroyed her spiritual God.</p><p>Luo shuihan let out an unwilling roar. Her eyes were as wide as a dead fish’s. Never in her wildest dreams would she have thought that her life would come to an end like this, killed by Lu Ming here.</p><p>senior brother Divine Child, avenge me!</p><p>Luo shuihan roared one last time, and her life was extinguished.</p><p>Luo shuihan was dead!</p><p>The Supreme Saints of the tianshen sect and the other sages all exuded a shocking aura. They looked at Lu Ming coldly, but in the end, they restrained their aura and sat down.</p><p>This was the treasure sealing assembly, and all the sects were present. If they broke the rules, they would be jointly suppressed by the other sects.</p><p>Luo shuihan is dead!</p><p>Many people murmured, still in disbelief.</p><p>Even the other geniuses were the same. They were somewhat dumbfounded.</p><p>The number one genius of the Azure region, the mountain that weighed down on the heads of all the conquerors of the Azure region, the insurmountable mountain, had been easily killed by Lu Ming. It made them feel that it was unreal.</p><p>“How could this be? How did this happen?”</p><p>Mo Yang mumbled to himself, as if he had been struck dumb.</p><p>Luo shuihan had been killed just like that. What about him? what could he do against Lu Ming? Thinking of this, he shivered.</p><p>How could Lu Ming’s combat strength be so powerful?</p><p>“I knew you were hiding your strength, but it’s still beyond my expectations!”</p><p>Luo Xiang murmured. His eyes were full of battle intent, but in the next moment, he retracted it.</p><p>master is the most powerful! I knew master was the most powerful!</p><p>In the Dragon God Valley area, Lu Xiangxiang cried out. She didn’t seem surprised at all. In her heart, it was as if everything had happened.</p><p>“Alright … Alright, my judgment is not even as good as a little girl’s!”</p><p>Zi Feng smiled bitterly.</p><p>hahaha, senior brother Zi Feng, that’s because you don’t understand Lu Ming. In the future, after getting to know him for a long time, it won’t be strange no matter what he does!</p><p>Tian Chui laughed out loud.</p><p>Tian Chui, Xue ningxin, Longyuan mountain, and the others all knew what was going on. Previously, Lu Ming had said that he had a 50% chance of killing the divine Son. It was only natural that he would be able to kill a mere Luo shuihan.</p><p>On the fighting ring, Lu Ming put away Luo shuihan’s storage ring and holy weapon spear. These were his spoils of war, so he would not be polite. Then, with a shake of the spear, Luo shuihan’s body flew out of the fighting ring.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As he pointed the Black Dragon Spear, everyone’s hearts trembled.</p><p>That was because Lu Ming was pointing in the direction of the divine Son.</p><p>Son of God, just you wait. You’re next!</p><p>Lu Ming pointed his gun at the divine Son, his killing intent cold.</p><p>I will send you down to accompany Luo shuihan!</p><p>The Son of God spoke. As he opened and closed his eyes, a terrifying holy light flashed.</p><p>Everyone in the surroundings was suddenly filled with anticipation.</p><p>He was looking forward to the battle between Lu Ming and the divine Son.</p><p>Previously, most people had thought that Lu Ming was not qualified to fight with the divine Son at all. They thought that he might have been killed by the divine God sect during the treasure auction.</p><p>Even if they were lucky enough to pass the treasure fixing assembly, they would not have the slightest hope against the divine Son.</p><p>But now, they suddenly felt a strong sense of anticipation.</p><p>Lu Ming had killed Luo shuihan with a flip of his hand. He was unfathomable. Who knew if Lu Ming had hidden his strength? Perhaps he could really fight with the Son of God?</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Black Dragon Spear in Lu Ming’s hand shook and the blood on it flew away. He then put the Black Dragon Spear away and returned to the stands.</p><p>“Now, let the competition continue!”</p><p>Po yuangui announced.</p><p>The competition continued, but the rest of the competition was already boring.</p><p>The people watching were not in the mood. They were all looking forward to the battle between Lu Ming and the divine Son.</p><p>The person who was fighting didn’t have the mood.</p><p>With Lu Ming around, did they still have any hope of competing for the first place?</p><p>With Lu Ming’s combat strength, he could completely sweep away all the other sects. In addition, Dragon God Valley had Zi Feng. Moreover, due to their numbers, they had been leading in points. How could the other sects compete in this way?</p><p>They could no longer see any hope, so their fight was just a formality.</p><p>Soon, this round ended and they entered the next round.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Mo Yang!”</p><p>When he heard po yuangui’s voice, Mo Yang’s face turned pale.</p><p>Lu Ming and Mo Yang stepped onto the fighting ring, facing each other.</p><p>“Mo Yang, you said earlier that you would kill me. Wait a minute, you won’t admit defeat right away, will you? I don’t think you, Mo Yang, are that gutless, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Mo Yang gritted his teeth, his face alternating between green and white.</p><p>He had intended to admit defeat. However, after hearing Lu Ming’s words, he admitted that he was gutless.</p><p>Lu Ming was deliberately embarrassing him.</p><p>“Begin!” Po yuangui announced.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and the fighting ring rumbled.</p><p>“I admit defeat, I admit defeat!”</p><p>Mo Yang shouted.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
