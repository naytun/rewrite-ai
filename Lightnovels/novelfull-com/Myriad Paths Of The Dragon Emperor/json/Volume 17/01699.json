The divine son’s soul felt as if it was being torn apart, and the vital essence in his body could not help but stagnate.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat sword pierced into the divine son’s dantian, shattering his Saint heart. The divine son’s power of law turned into a pillar of light and shot into the sky.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The great sage of the heavenly God sect roared.</p><p>The Son of God’s eyes were wide open, filled with unwillingness.</p><p>With his talent, he would have been able to become the Overlord of the Azure continent in the future if he had continued down this path. However, he had met Lu Ming.</p><p>Three years ago, Lu Ming was only at the fourth level of the martial Royal realm. He, on the other hand, was already at the peak of the half-Saint realm. He was an existence that was influenced by the laws. He did not take Lu Ming seriously at all. He was overbearing and fearless.</p><p>At the Dragon resting Lake, he had berated Lu Ming and the others. Later on, when Lu Ming and the others obtained the treasures of the Dragon Palace, he felt that he had lost face. He was overbearing and wanted to kill Lu Ming at the treasure settling meeting.</p><p>At that time, Lu Ming had actually challenged him but he did not care about it at all. If it was not for yang tianzong’s attack, he would have killed Lu Ming directly. Even though he had agreed later on, he did not take Lu Ming to heart.</p><p>How strong could a Lv 4 martial Royal realm expert be in three years? he was an ant that he could kill with a single slap.</p><p>But at the treasure auction, Lu Ming’s combat strength had exceeded his expectations and he had easily killed Luo shuihan.</p><p>However, he was not particularly concerned at that time. His cultivation had reached the upper tier of the bright Saint realm and he had many trump cards. No matter how strong Lu Ming was, he was only a half-Saint and was no match for him.</p><p>However, when the battle began, he realized that he was wrong.</p><p>Wrong meant death!</p><p>Son of God, you’re stronger than Luo shuihan. You won’t cry and beg for mercy, so I’ll give you a quick death!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He shook his combat sword and destructive power gushed in. The divine Son let out an indignant roar and was turned into ashes by Lu Ming’s destructive power.</p><p>The Son of God was dead!</p><p>At this moment, the other people in the arena did not know what to feel in their hearts. They were extremely complicated.</p><p>The Divine Child, a person who had been above all of the geniuses of the Azure continent for more than ten years, had been killed by an even younger youth with an even weaker cultivation.</p><p>The fall of the deity meant the birth of an even more terrifying genius.</p><p>If he was not a Saint, he would slaughter a Saint. In the future, who in the Azure continent would be a match for Lu Ming?</p><p>Could it be that after Emperor Cang, another great emperor would be born in the Azure continent?</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>Mo Yang muttered to himself in the Tian Yu demonic sect’s grandstand.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you really didn’t let me down!”</p><p>Xie nianjun murmured in the stands of the Tian Shen sect. Her eyes were glowing. With the death of the deity, the Tian Shen sect would be hers. No one could compete with her.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I want you to pay with your life!”</p><p>The great sage of the tianshen sect roared. His eyes were filled with anger and he wished he could tear Lu Ming into pieces.</p><p>However, the purple dragon Valley master kept him busy, and he could not free himself.</p><p>The people from the other sects looked on coldly. No one intervened.</p><p>This was not the treasure sealing assembly. It was a personal grudge between Lu Ming and the divine Son. They had no reason to interfere.</p><p>Moreover, in the past few years, the speed of the Tian Shen sect’s expansion had been too fast. Their strength was so strong that they had already become the number one in the Azure region. If the deity grew up in the future, he would also be a great enemy. It was good that he died.</p><p>However …</p><p>The powerhouses from the major sects looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>When Lu Ming grew up in the future, who would be his match?</p><p>The eyes of some of the experts from the sects, such as the sky demon sect and the desire poison sect, flickered, and no one knew what they were thinking.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The purple dragon Valley master and the Supreme Saints of the deity sect exchanged dozens of blows before they retreated.</p><p>The purple dragon Valley master retreated to Lu Ming’s side to protect him.</p><p>The eyes of the great sage of the heavenly God sect flashed with unwillingness. He knew that he could not kill Lu Ming today.</p><p>The tianshen sect had suffered a complete defeat in the treasure auction this time. Two of their strongest heaven’s pride experts had died. The loss was too great. He didn’t know how to explain it when he returned.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Dragon God Valley, the tianshen sect will remember this debt. We will pay it back sooner or later!”</p><p>The great sage of the heavenly God sect looked at Lu Ming with a strong killing intent. He did not hide it at all. Then, he waved his hand and shouted,”Disciples of the heavenly God sect, let’s go!”</p><p>After he finished speaking, he stepped into the air and left. All the elders and disciples of the heavenly God sect followed him.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, well done!”</p><p>The purple dragon Valley master came to Lu Ming’s side and said with a smile.</p><p>However, as soon as he finished speaking, his expression suddenly changed. He looked in the direction where the deity sect had left. Lu Ming did the same, looking in that direction.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the sky not far away, a huge pitch-black Hand that was even larger than a mountain suddenly appeared. It grabbed towards the people of the tianshen sect with an extremely shocking aura.</p><p>“Who’s there? You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The great sage of the tianshen sect was furious. He formed a long spear in his hand and pierced it through the giant hand.</p><p>However, just as the great sage of the tianshen sect made his move, a few rays of sword light burst out from the Cang mountains. They were extremely terrifying and crossed hundreds of miles in the void in an instant, slashing towards the people of the tianshen sect.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Instantly, dozens of disciples of the heavenly God sect were killed by the sword light.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The spear of the Supreme Saint of the tianshen sect pierced through the giant palm. However, a few figures flew out of the Cang mountains and rushed toward the people of the tianshen sect like lightning. The one in the lead had a shocking aura. He was a Supreme Saint.</p><p>The other people were also Saint stage powerhouses.</p><p>Before they even arrived, all kinds of terrifying attacks were already aimed at the people of the heavenly God sect.</p><p>“Just who are you people?”</p><p>The Supreme Saint of the heavenly God sect was furious. Holy light filled the air as he stood in front of the disciples of the heavenly God sect. The other Saints of the heavenly God sect also stood in front of him to block the attacks.</p><p>At the top of the Cang Mountain, everyone was also confused. Who were the people who attacked the Tian Shen sect?</p><p>Could it be that some sect wanted to target the tianshen sect?</p><p>However, at this moment, a terrifying aura rose around the grey Mountain. Rays of terrifying sword and Saber Light rose up and attacked the people of all the sects. The power was terrifying.</p><p>“Not good, enemy attack!”</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>Many people’s faces changed. The Supreme Saints of the major sects all burst out and launched all kinds of terrible attacks to resist the sudden killing moves.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At this time, many figures rushed out from all around the Cang Mountain. Each figure was wrapped in a black robe, but the aura they emitted was extremely terrifying. Their Holy might was vast and mighty, suppressing the sky.</p><p>The number of people was shocking. There were at least 50 to 60 people, and all of them were experts of the Saint realm. There were even more than 10 of them whose auras were as deep as the ocean and unfathomable. They were not any weaker than the purple dragon Valley master and the Supreme Saints of the tianshen sect.</p><p>The great sage realm. At least a dozen of these people who had suddenly appeared were great sages.</p><p>“Kill, kill everyone, leave no one alive!”</p><p>One of the black-robed men said coldly.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Dozens of Saints rushed to the top of the mountain from all directions.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>At that moment, all the experts on the peak of the grey Mountain erupted. The bright Saints and Supreme Saints of the 12 top sects all attacked each other.</p><p>A terrifying rumble resounded between heaven and earth.</p><p>The purple dragon Valley master was up against a black-robed man. The black-robed man was also a Supreme Saint, and his fighting strength was no weaker than the purple dragon Valley master’s. The two of them fought fiercely.</p><p>The Supreme Saints of the other sects also had opponents, and they were fighting fiercely.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
