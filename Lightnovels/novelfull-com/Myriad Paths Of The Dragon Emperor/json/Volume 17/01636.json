After more than ten days, the situation slowly stabilized.</p><p>At this moment, the tenth Prince of the Golden Crow sent a message to Lu Ming and Huang Ling, telling them that the key and map of the tomb of the Samsara King were ready. He invited them to meet at the Golden Crow Palace, merge with the map, and head to the tomb of the Samsara King.</p><p>...</p><p>“Is everyone finally here?”</p><p>Lu Ming ended his cultivation and a sharp glint flashed in his eyes. Together with Huang Ling, they flew towards the Golden Crow Palace.</p><p>“Those who have the key and map of the tomb of the Samsara King are all gathered at the Golden Crow Palace. Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>In dark water city, many people flew towards the Golden Crow Palace.</p><p>Very quickly, Lu Ming and Huang Ling arrived at the Golden Crow Palace.</p><p>This time, they did not meet at the square. As soon as Lu Ming and Huang Ling arrived, the members of the Golden Crow race welcomed them to a courtyard inside the Golden Crow Palace.</p><p>Those heaven’s favorites without a map or key could only wait outside the Golden Crow Palace.</p><p>When Lu Ming and Huang Ling arrived, they realized that many people had already arrived.</p><p>Ye Dongfang was standing alone with his hands behind his back.</p><p>There was also a young man in a yellow robe. He had taken the map and the key from another man. He was also a heaven’s favorite on the same level as ye Dongfang, the tenth golden Crow Prince.</p><p>In addition, there were a few other people with unfathomable auras. They were also heaven’s favorites on the same level as the Golden crow’s tenth Prince. He didn’t see them last time, so they were obviously from the other cities.</p><p>In addition, there were a few groups with more people. The smallest group had four or five people together, while the largest group had seven or eight people.</p><p>Lu Ming even saw Zhao Kuang and Sima Liang among the group of people.</p><p>These people were all at the same level as young master blood prison, so they formed an alliance of four to five people. They controlled the key and map of King Samsara’s tomb together.</p><p>Following that, a few more groups of people arrived. Each group had more than four to five people.</p><p>There were seven people in one group and Lu Ming recognized a few of them.</p><p>They were none other than Xia ding and the other three who had tried to snatch Lu Ming and Huang Ling away.</p><p>Xia ding and the other three looked at Lu Ming and Huang Ling with fear in their eyes.</p><p>There were six people in the other group as well. One of them was wearing black scaled armor. He glared at Lu Ming coldly, his killing intent flashing continuously.</p><p>“Taotie!”</p><p>Lu Ming could tell from the aura that the young man in the scaled armor was the Taotie.</p><p>It seemed that Tao tie had found a group of people to cooperate with and was going to enter the tomb of the Samsara King together.</p><p>alright, the ten sets of keys and maps are all here. But before I gather the maps, I have to make one point clear. Whoever has the map and the keys can bring anyone with them, but we have to decide on the candidates now. We can’t add any more people when we set off later. Brother ye, brother Shi, Holy Phoenix spirit … Do you have any objections?”</p><p>The Golden Crow tenth Crown Prince said. However, his eyes were on ye Dongfang, Huang Ling, the yellow-robed youth, the Taotie, and other beings of the same level as him.</p><p>“Let’s do this!”</p><p>“I have no objections!”</p><p>Ye Dongfang, the yellow-robed young man, and the others all nodded.</p><p>The others didn’t say anything. The people they were supposed to set off with had all arrived.</p><p>This group of people were the top heaven’s favorites. Every one of them had a heaven spiritual body. As for those with earth spiritual bodies, they would not be of much use.</p><p>Even if one’s earth spiritual body had reached the third stage of the half-Saint realm, they would not be a match for anyone here.</p><p>“Alright, in that case, take out the map now!”</p><p>The Golden Crow tenth Crown Prince said. He first took out two Jade talismans and inserted his true Yuan. The Jade talismans lit up and two maps appeared in the air.</p><p>Following that, the others took out their Jade talismans and channeled their essential core into them. Lu Ming did the same.</p><p>Map after map appeared in the air and pieced together.</p><p>A total of ten regions were pieced together to form a complete map.</p><p>At this moment, the map emitted a bright light. On the map, a bright spot of light appeared.</p><p>that’s where the tomb of the reincarnation King is!</p><p>Many people’s eyes lit up as they quickly memorized the map.</p><p>“This is the North of the hundred tribe battlefield, where Mount immortal is!”</p><p>Ye Dongfang said.</p><p>“I didn’t expect it to be there. Let’s go!”</p><p>The Golden Crow tenth Prince said.</p><p>Then, they put away their Jade talismans and rose into the air, flying north.</p><p>they’re out. They must know the location of the tomb of the reincarnation King!</p><p>There were many people waiting outside the Golden Crow Palace. When they saw Lu Ming and the group coming out, there was a commotion.</p><p>let’s go and follow them. Maybe we can enter the tomb of the reincarnation King and get some good fortune!</p><p>“Yes, follow them!”</p><p>A large group of people rose into the air and followed behind Lu Ming and the group.</p><p>“Those who don’t have the key and map of the tomb of the reincarnation King, get lost or die!”</p><p>The eyes of the tenth golden Crow Prince shone with a golden light as he scanned the surroundings.</p><p>At the same time, ye Dongfang, Tao tie, and the others also looked around with unfriendly eyes.</p><p>you guys are too overbearing. We are free to go wherever we want to go. Do you want to interfere with where we go? ”</p><p>“Right, you guys go your way, we’ll go our way. We’ll have nothing to do with each other!”</p><p>Someone among those people shouted.</p><p>“Stubborn! Kill!”</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince suddenly let out a loud cry. His body was covered in terrifying Solar Fire as he turned into a golden light and rushed out.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>The Golden Crow tenth Prince’s hand transformed into the Golden crow’s claws, and the sky was filled with claw shadows. No one could withstand a single strike. As long as they were caught by the claw shadows, they would be enveloped by golden flames and turned into ashes in the blink of an eye.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, more than a dozen young men were killed, both in body and soul.</p><p>The others were all shocked and quickly backed away. They looked at the tenth golden Crow Prince with fear in their eyes.</p><p>“If you continue to follow, kill without mercy!”</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince said coldly.</p><p>This time, no one dared to follow them. Although there were many of them, their combat strength was far inferior to the tenth golden Crow Prince’s. Once they made a move, they would only be slaughtered.</p><p>Moreover, there were still many more experts who had yet to make a move. Once they did, they would really be slaughtered.</p><p>Although they were unwilling, they could only watch helplessly as Lu Ming and the rest left.</p><p>Who asked them to be weak? in the world of martial Dao, the strong preyed on the weak. Without strength, opportunities were placed in front of them, and they were powerless to take them.</p><p>Lu Ming and the group headed north. Following the instructions on the map, they flew for two days and arrived at a land of dead silence.</p><p>This was a wasteland, and as far as the eye could see, the wasteland was covered with white bones.</p><p>However, these white bones had been eroded by the wind and had no spirituality.</p><p>The entire wasteland was filled with a faint aura of death.</p><p>It was obvious that this place had been a battlefield in the past.</p><p>In front of the wasteland, there was a majestic mountain. It was particularly eye-catching in the flat wasteland.</p><p>According to the map, the target was that mountain.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
