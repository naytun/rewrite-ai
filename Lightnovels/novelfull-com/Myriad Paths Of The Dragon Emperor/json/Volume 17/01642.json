At the same time, he was shocked.</p><p>In the world, there were actually nine laws that could be on par with chaos.</p><p>...</p><p>In the past, Lu Ming did not know about this at all.</p><p>It seemed that he still knew too little.</p><p>“Senior, perhaps in the future, there will be someone suitable for senior’s inheritance!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Although it was a pity, he could only give up. He couldn’t possibly give up the chaos Domain and switch to reincarnation, right? that was impossible.</p><p>“There’s no time left. This wisp of my soul can’t exist for long!”</p><p>The reincarnation Emperor sighed. Then, a crystal-like object appeared in his hand. Laws revolved around it and it was extremely wonderful. Lu Ming looked at it as if he was looking at a whole new world.</p><p>“Lu Ming, this is my world core. It contains all my inheritance. Take it. If you meet a suitable person in the future, help me pass it on. This is my last wish!”</p><p>The reincarnation Emperor said with a sigh.</p><p>The fact that a great emperor had fallen into such a state was truly lamentable.</p><p>“Senior, Lu Ming will definitely find the most suitable successor for you and pass it on!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was firm. He then took the world core from the reincarnation Emperor and put it away solemnly.</p><p>“Many thanks!”</p><p>The reincarnation Emperor smiled and said, ” “Little guy, since you are the first one to wake up, how can I let you return empty-handed? this reincarnation halberd is for you!”</p><p>The reincarnation Emperor’s palm glowed, and a halberd appeared.</p><p>this reincarnation halberd used to be my combat weapon, but it has been severely damaged and has no power left. However, I have sealed two forces inside it. If these two forces were to be fully unleashed, they can kill any expert below the Emperor realm!</p><p>Said the reincarnation Emperor.</p><p>“It can kill any expert below the Emperor rank!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked, then ecstatic.</p><p>Such a treasure was simply heaven-defying.</p><p>At a critical moment, it was a treasure that could definitely turn the tables and save his life.</p><p>that’s right. Of course, there are only two forces. Once you use them, there’s no more. Take them!</p><p>The reincarnation Emperor passed the reincarnation halberd to Lu Ming, who accepted it with joy.</p><p>“Okay, I’ll send you out now!”</p><p>Said the reincarnation Emperor.</p><p>“Senior, can I stay here for a while? I want to cultivate here!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Previously, he had experienced nine lifetimes. Those scenes were like nine real lives. Lu Ming had learned a lot. He felt that he was about to make a breakthrough in the chaos realm.</p><p>One more step and he would be a half-Saint!</p><p>As long as he broke through to the half-Saint realm, his strength would skyrocket. He would have more confidence when he went out.</p><p>“It’s fine, you can continue to cultivate!”</p><p>Said the reincarnation Emperor.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and then sat cross-legged. He took out the path-understanding ancient tree and started to comprehend it quietly.</p><p>“The path-understanding ancient tree? It seems like this little fellow has more secrets than I thought!”</p><p>The reincarnation Emperor was stunned for a moment, and then he smiled.</p><p>The chaos Domain on Lu Ming’s body was shaking up and down.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, seven days had passed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The chaos Domain on Lu Ming’s body suddenly trembled violently and then expanded with an imposing aura.</p><p>The ultimate domain!</p><p>After going through nine reincarnations, Lu Ming had an epiphany and finally made a breakthrough in the chaos Domain to the extreme.</p><p>The ultimate Primal Chaos Domain was much more powerful than a level nine Primal Chaos Domain.</p><p>As soon as the chaos realm was broken through, the essential core in Lu Ming’s body also went berserk. It whistled and jumped, its speed increasing.</p><p>His cultivation base was about to break through.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and a large pile of mid-grade raw gemstones appeared on the ground. Lu Ming circulated the devouring power and devoured the raw gemstones madly, beginning to refine them.</p><p>Three days later, Lu Ming had already refined an unknown number of raw gemstones. His aura suddenly increased explosively, forming a primordial Qi pillar that shot straight to the top of the secret chamber.</p><p>However, this secret chamber was very sturdy. Lu Ming’s essential core Qi column rushed to the top and there was no reaction at all.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming opened his eyes.</p><p>He had finally broken through to the first stage of half-Saint.</p><p>After breaking through to the half-Saint realm, his combat strength had increased dramatically. He was now confident that he could suppress the Taotie alone.</p><p>little guy, I almost forgot. I can see a trace of chaos Qi in your body. Let me give you another opportunity!</p><p>The reincarnation Emperor appeared and walked over. A stream of Qi appeared in his hand and started to circle around his arm.</p><p>chaos Qi! This is the real chaos Qi!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes widened in shock.</p><p>He could immediately sense that the current on the arm of the reincarnation Emperor was the real chaotic Qi.</p><p>Although he cultivated the chaos Domain, he had never seen true chaos Qi.</p><p>that’s right. This is a wisp of true chaotic Qi. I obtained it before the Great War. I originally wanted to refine it into the reincarnation halberd, but after the Great War, I gave it up. Now, I’ll give it to you. Refine it into your spirit body, and the power of your spirit body will be greatly improved!</p><p>“Lu Ming, close your eyes. I’ll give you a hand!”</p><p>The reincarnation Emperor shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming quickly closed his eyes and became one with his mind.</p><p>The reincarnation Emperor waved his hand, and a wisp of chaotic Qi flew out and entered Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>The Qi of chaos was the Qi of origin between heaven and earth. Even a wisp of it could collapse a mountain. It was extremely heavy.</p><p>As soon as the chaos Qi entered Lu Ming’s body, he felt that his body was about to break apart.</p><p>“Hold on, there’s a trace of chaos Qi in your body. You should be able to refine it!”</p><p>The voice of the reincarnation Emperor rang in Lu Ming’s ears. Then, a ray of light was emitted from the reincarnation Emperor’s Hand and enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>Instantly, Lu Ming felt the pressure on his body lighten. He then focused his mind and began to refine with all his might.</p><p>Slowly, a wisp of true chaotic Qi intertwined with the original wisp of chaotic Qi in his body and seeped into Lu Ming’s body. His body was slowly becoming stronger.</p><p>At this moment, on the bridge of helplessness, there were many young men sitting cross-legged. They were Huang Ling, the Golden Crow tenth Prince, the Taotie, and the others.</p><p>The more than 40 heaven’s favorites who had jumped into the vortex were all here.</p><p>At this moment, all of the heaven’s favorites opened their eyes, and they were all confused.</p><p>“Eh, what’s going on? I clearly remember drinking grandma Meng’s soup and jumping into the whirlpool. Why am I still here?”</p><p>Someone asked, full of doubt.</p><p>I don’t know either. I only know that I fell into darkness and lost consciousness. When I woke up, I was already here!</p><p>“I’m the same!”</p><p>The others all nodded.</p><p>It seemed that they were different from Lu Ming. Lu Ming could remember everything that happened in his nine reincarnations, but these people seemed to have forgotten.</p><p>The Golden Crow tenth Prince’s body was covered in flames. He stood up and looked around cautiously. When he didn’t see Meng Po, he let out a long breath.</p><p>it seems like we have come out after entering the reincarnation. Who is it that has obtained the inheritance of the reincarnation Emperor? ”</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince said coldly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
