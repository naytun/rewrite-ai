Is it also an Emperor-ranked power?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>...</p><p>that’s right, and it’s a very terrifying Emperor-level force. The heavenly Bird Palace is made up of terrifying bird-type demonic beasts and divine beasts, and its experts are as many as the clouds!</p><p>as for the Phoenix Palace, although we are humans, our bloodline and spiritual body are all related to phoenixes, so the relationship between the Phoenix Palace and the heavenly Bird Palace is very good. Young master Tianying is a peerless genius of the heavenly Bird Palace. He invited me to a banquet, and I couldn’t refuse. Lu Ming, you can walk around the Phoenix Palace by yourself. I’m leaving!</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>“Alright, you can go!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>The Phoenix Spirit turned around and left. Lu Ming strolled around the Phoenix Palace for a while to relax. He returned to his room and planned to enter the mountain and river diagram to continue cultivating.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>There was someone in his room.</p><p>There were three young men who looked at Lu Ming with lightning-like eyes.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>One of the young men moved and appeared at the door. After a while, an inscription scroll appeared. Countless inscriptions filled the air and formed a circle of light that enveloped the room.</p><p>“Everyone, you’ve entered the wrong room!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>“Nonsense. Lu Ming, hand over the map of the tomb of the reincarnation King. You’re not qualified to have it!”</p><p>One of the young men spoke, his voice cold.</p><p>The three young men exuded a powerful aura. They were all experts at the second stage of the half-Saint realm.</p><p>However, they were all upper grade earth spiritual bodies.</p><p>“Who sent you? Say it and then get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly.</p><p>“You’re looking for death. Since you don’t want to hand it over, I’ll take it myself!”</p><p>One of the young men shouted coldly. He stepped forward and grabbed at Lu Ming with his palm. His palm enlarged rapidly and was covered in a bloody light.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and it was as if he was crushing dry weeds and smashing rotten wood. The young man’s palm exploded directly and his body was sent flying. He crashed into the light circle and broke the light circle. His body crashed through the wall of the room and flew out.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming turned around and threw another punch.</p><p>The young man standing at the door was also sent flying by the punch.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>The last young man was shocked.</p><p>They were all at the second stage of the half-Saint realm and had comprehended the laws. However, they were no match for Lu Ming and were sent flying with each punch.</p><p>He didn’t even think as his figure shot up into the sky, broke through the room, and rushed out.</p><p>“Since you’ve come, don’t leave!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He moved and chased after the young man, approaching him rapidly.</p><p>The young man was scared out of his wits and shouted, ” “Young master, save me!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>As soon as the other party finished speaking, Lu Ming had already appeared beside him. The flowing essence gloves glowed and he threw a punch, tearing the other party into pieces.</p><p>Usually, geniuses with superior-grade earth spiritual bodies were no match for Lu Ming unless they had reached the third stage of the half-Saint realm and were affected by the laws. They would be easily crushed and killed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the sound of air being torn could be heard from all directions. More than a dozen figures rushed toward Lu Ming with cold killing intent that was not concealed at all.</p><p>So many experts had actually entered!</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and activated the godly sword technique through sound waves, swarming toward the dozen or so experts.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s soul power, which had reached the third stage of the half-Saint realm, the divine sword technique was shockingly powerful.</p><p>Those young men immediately let out shrill screams and fell to the ground one after another, no longer breathing.</p><p>“Damn it, Lu Ming, you deserve to die!”</p><p>An angry roar was heard. A blood-red figure appeared in the air and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Young master of blood prison, it’s you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>The last person to appear was the young master of blood prison.</p><p>At this moment, young master blood prison’s body was filled with cold killing intent, and his eyes were red.</p><p>He was furious, and his heart ached!</p><p>Initially, he thought that it would be enough to deal with Lu Ming and a few geniuses at the second stage of the semi-sage realm. He would bring more than ten experts to support them.</p><p>However, he did not expect that the three experts would be killed by Lu Ming in an instant. Even the other ten or so experts were killed by Lu Ming’s soul attack. These were all geniuses, and it made his heart bleed. He had to tear Lu Ming into a thousand pieces.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>A blood-red flag appeared in his hand. The blood-red flag expanded rapidly and covered the sky. It turned into a sea of blood and enveloped Lu Ming and the entire courtyard.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>The disciples of Phoenix Palace were alarmed and rushed out of their courtyards. They stood high in the sky, but their expressions changed when they saw the sea of blood.</p><p>The blood sea was too terrifying. If an ordinary person was enveloped by it, only death would await them.</p><p>it’s young master blood prison. How dare he cause trouble in our Phoenix Palace!</p><p>“Go and report to the Holy maiden!”</p><p>The disciples of Phoenix Palace were in an uproar.</p><p>There was a huge commotion here. Not only Phoenix Palace, but more than half of the city was alarmed.</p><p>One figure after another rushed into the sky and watched from afar.</p><p>it’s young master blood prison! He’s actually attacking Phoenix Palace!</p><p>it must be for the map of the tomb of the Samsara Emperor in Lu Ming’s hands. But to be honest, Lu Ming is not qualified to control a map!</p><p>“Young master blood prison, aren’t you afraid of Feng Ling?”</p><p>“He’s most likely using some other method to block the Phoenix Spirit!”</p><p>Many people thought about it and guessed the purpose of young master of blood prison.</p><p>Drunken immortal restaurant was quite a distance away from Phoenix Palace, but the commotion in Phoenix Palace could still be heard here.</p><p>“Damn it, it’s that guy from blood prison!”</p><p>Huang Ling rushed out of the drunken immortal restaurant and looked in the direction of the Phoenix Palace with a gloomy expression.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Two figures appeared beside her. One was a young man in a black feather robe, and the other was the tenth golden Crow Prince.</p><p>“Feng Ling, let’s continue drinking!”</p><p>The black-feathered robe youth said calmly.</p><p>“Young master Tianying, I didn’t expect you to join forces with the blood prison. You asked me out in advance so that the blood prison could make a move, right?”</p><p>Huang Ling coldly looked at the man in Black.</p><p>This man was young master Tianying of the heavenly Bird Palace.</p><p>Young master Tianying chuckled. He didn’t admit or deny it, but there was indeed an aura that locked onto Huang Ling.</p><p>what’s the blood prison doing? how could they cause such a big commotion when they’re dealing with a mere Lv 9 Martial Emperor? ”</p><p>Young master Tianying snorted in his heart.</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince’s face was calm. He didn’t know about this before, and now that he did, he wouldn’t care.</p><p>“Feng Ling, let’s continue drinking!”</p><p>Young master Tianying continued.</p><p>“Alright, if you want to drink, I’ll accompany you!”</p><p>Suddenly, Huang Ling let out an inexplicable smile, turned around, and returned to the drunken immortal restaurant. This caused young master Tianying to be stunned. He had thought that Huang Ling would directly rush to the Phoenix Palace to save him. He did not expect her to return to the drunken immortal restaurant.</p><p>it seems like Huang Ling and Lu Ming are not on good terms!</p><p>Sky Eagle laughed in its heart.</p><p>He didn’t know that Huang Ling knew Lu Ming’s combat strength. Lu Ming had killed Wan Tiancheng back then. Now that his cultivation had improved, he was undoubtedly stronger. Young master blood prison was clearly courting death by targeting Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
