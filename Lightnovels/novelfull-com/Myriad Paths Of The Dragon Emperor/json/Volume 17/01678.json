It was the same as three years ago.</p><p>“I’ll come!”</p><p>...</p><p>The Dragon God Valley disciple who had been challenged leaped onto the fighting ring and looked at the disciples of the sky demon sect with a provocative look.</p><p>“Brat, you’re very arrogant. I’ll make you wish you were dead!”</p><p>The young man from the Tian Yu demon sect said coldly.</p><p>you want to kill me? let’s make a bet. If you can’t kill me, you’ll have to kneel down and kowtow to me!</p><p>The Dragon God Valley disciple sneered.</p><p>With the Jade talisman, he had the confidence to save his life and his courage grew.</p><p>“Brat, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>The disciples of the Tianyu demonic sect charged at the disciples of the Dragon God Valley.</p><p>The Dragon God Valley disciple took a step forward and rushed to the edge of the fighting ring.</p><p>However, the disciple of the Tianyu demonic sect caught up with him very quickly. A demonic blade slashed at the disciple of the Dragon God Valley. However, just like the previous battle, the disciple of the Dragon God Valley emitted a ray of light. The next moment, he had already appeared 300 meters away. He took a few steps and rushed out of the fighting ring.</p><p>I’ve told you that you can’t kill me. So what if you’re at the sixth level of the martial Royal realm? ”</p><p>The disciple of the Dragon God Valley said arrogantly.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The Tian Yu demonic sect disciple’s face was extremely cold as he returned to the platform with hatred.</p><p>another life-saving spiritual talisman. Don’t tell me everyone has one!</p><p>that’s impossible. This kind of life-saving spiritual talisman is very precious. There are definitely not many of them in Dragon God Valley!</p><p>There was a commotion all around.</p><p>“You people of Dragon God Valley are really willing to give up such a precious treasure to save your lives. But even if each of you has one, what’s the use? You can only save your life, but you can’t win. Then let’s eliminate Dragon God Valley First!”</p><p>Luo shuihan said coldly.</p><p>He was in a bad mood. He had said that he would kill the disciples of the Dragon God Valley, but now he was saved by them one after another, which made him feel very embarrassed.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly, his expression calm.</p><p>The challenges continued, and soon it was the Yu Du sect’s turn.</p><p>Sure enough, the Yu Du sect also sent out an expert to challenge the Dragon God Valley disciple. However, the Dragon God Valley disciple still used the Jade talisman to save his life and rushed down the fighting ring.</p><p>This made everyone in the area a little dumbfounded. Could it be that everyone in Dragon God Valley would really get a life-saving spiritual talisman?</p><p>However, it was useless. Even if he could survive, he would be the first to be defeated and eliminated by the three great sects. At that time, he wouldn’t even be able to participate in the treasure fixing assembly.</p><p>Three years ago, there was Lu Ming, and in the end, the herculean King dominated the crowd.</p><p>Who was in Dragon God Valley this time?</p><p>It was said that the quality of Dragon God Valley’s paragons this time was far inferior to three years ago.</p><p>It was said that the heaven’s pride experts in the tianshen sect were stronger than three years ago. They had four heaven’s pride experts who had reached the peak of the sixth level martial Royal realm and possessed superior earth spiritual bodies. This was one more than three years ago.</p><p>The Tian Yu demonic sect and the Yu Du sect were not any worse than they were three years ago.</p><p>In this way, Dragon God Valley had no chance at all.</p><p>The competition continued, and soon it was Dragon God Valley’s turn to challenge.</p><p>The difference from three years ago was that this time, the disciples of Dragon God Valley had life-saving spiritual talismans and could counterattack in advance.</p><p>The leader of the Dragon God Valley team had sent a Lv 6 martial Royal realm expert to challenge a Lv 4 martial Royal realm expert of the deity sect and killed him.</p><p>This made the disciples of the divine realm sect and Luo shuihan’s faces turn ugly.</p><p>They didn’t manage to kill the disciples of Dragon God Valley. Instead, one of them was killed by the disciples of Dragon God Valley.</p><p>today, Dragon God Valley will be the first to be eliminated!</p><p>Luo shuihan’s cold voice was heard.</p><p>Luo, can you shut up? before it started, you were already shouting that you wanted to ‘entertain’ the disciples of Dragon God Valley and wanted to kill them. Now that you can’t kill them, you want to be the first one to eliminate the disciples of Dragon God Valley. Don’t you feel pain when you slap yourself like this?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s disdainful voice was heard.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>Beside Lu Ming, Tian Chui, Xue ningxin, and the others burst into laughter. Following that, the rest of the people from Dragon God Valley also laughed.</p><p>Chi Chi Chi!</p><p>Luo shuihan clenched her fists so tightly that her veins were bulging.</p><p>Soon, the first round of the competition ended, and the second round began.</p><p>The second round was the same as the first round. The tianshen sect, the Tianyu demon sect, and the Yudu sect took turns to send out their experts to challenge the Dragon God Valley. However, everyone from the Dragon God Valley was given a jade talisman. In the end, none of them were killed. All of them survived.</p><p>This left the people from the other sects dumbfounded.</p><p>There were so many life-saving spiritual talismans in Dragon God Valley.</p><p>This kind of talisman wouldn’t be very useful in other places. It could only move three hundred meters. If the difference in strength was too great, the three hundred meters distance could be covered in a few moves.</p><p>However, it was different on the fighting ring.</p><p>Moving 300 meters on the fighting ring was enough to escape the fighting ring and save his life.</p><p>This made the people of the three major sects feel very helpless. What made the people of the tianshen sect want to vomit blood was that when the Dragon God Valley challenge came, they would send experts to kill a weak person of the tianshen sect.</p><p>They couldn’t kill the people of Dragon God Valley, but Dragon God Valley could kill them.</p><p>After that, it was the same for every round.</p><p>In every round, three people from Dragon God Valley were defeated, but one of them was able to kill one person from the tianshen sect.</p><p>Soon, eight rounds had passed.</p><p>Twenty-four people from Dragon God Valley had been defeated, leaving only twelve people.</p><p>However, eight people from the tianshen sect had been killed by the Dragon God Valley. These were all heaven’s pride figures, which made the people of the tianshen sect feel heartache.</p><p>They finally had a taste of what it was like to be hunted down by them in Dragon God Valley three years ago.</p><p>The tianshen sect had no way out now. They could only eliminate Dragon God Valley as soon as possible to reduce their losses.</p><p>The ninth round!</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A heaven’s pride expert of the tianshen sect leaped onto the fighting stage. His violent aura filled the entire area.</p><p>The peak of the sixth level martial monarch realm!</p><p>Although this person was not one of the four strongest people in the tianshen sect’s treasure auction, he was still one of the four strongest heaven’s pride experts.</p><p>He looked at Dragon God Valley.</p><p>At this time, the remaining 12 people of Dragon God Valley were all at the LV 6 martial Royal realm.</p><p>“Little girl, come down!”</p><p>The heaven’s God sect’s Paragon looked at Qiu Ying Ying and said coldly.</p><p>“It’s finally my turn!”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying’s eyes lit up as she stepped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>you also have a life-saving spirit talisman on you, right? in that case, get out of the fighting stage yourself, lest I make a move!</p><p>The chosen from the heavenly God sect spoke.</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying’s cultivation was only at the early stage of the LV 6 martial Royal realm. Moreover, her qi and blood were not strong, and her vitality was not very vigorous. She was clearly a person with an ordinary physique.</p><p>The Dragon God Valley had actually sent a person with an ordinary physique to fight. There was really no one else.</p><p>“Zi Feng, Lu Ming, you’re actually letting a girl with an ordinary physique fight. Has your Dragon God Valley declined to such an extent? You can’t even send out a decent person?”</p><p>Luo shuihan said with a cold smile.</p><p>He would not let go of the chance to mock Dragon God Valley.</p><p>“Wait a minute, don’t slap your own face again!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
