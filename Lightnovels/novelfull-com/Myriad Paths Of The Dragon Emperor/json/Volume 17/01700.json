The Supreme Saints from the major sects were all blocked. Then, the other party’s bright Saints charged forward, breaking through the defenses of the Saints from the major sects and killing the young geniuses.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>A black-robed man broke through the defense of the Dragon God Valley Saints and attacked the Dragon God Valley’s sovereign.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>Zi Feng shouted loudly, blocking in front of everyone.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes glowed with a cold light. With a flash of wind and thunder, he rushed to the grandstand of Dragon God Valley. The divine son’s great saint weapon appeared in his hand. He slashed at the black-robed Saint.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The black-robed Saint was only an initial bright Saint, but he was killed by Lu Ming with one strike.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At this time, more than a dozen people rushed out of the Cang Mountain. They were also experts of the Saint realm. They went to the major sects and a few of them went to the Dragon God Valley.</p><p>There were too many powerful beings on the other side. Excluding the Supreme Saints, there were more than 60 Saints, which had surpassed the Saints of all the major sects.</p><p>The other party had obviously planned this for a long time. While all the major sects had gathered at the top of the Cang Mountain to participate in the treasure fixing assembly, they had quietly hidden around the Cang Mountain and then suddenly launched a thunderous attack.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The counterattacks of the Saints from Dragon God Valley included Lu Ming’s second senior brother, long Yuanshan, and third senior brother, yang tianzong.</p><p>Yang tianzong’s combat power was strong. He could fight two powerful black-robed Saints alone.</p><p>However, there were too many saints on the other side. One of them broke through the encirclement and attacked Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and used the divine sword technique. However, the other party’s body only trembled slightly. Two sword gleams shot out from his eyes and stabbed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Godly sword technique!</p><p>Lu Ming was greatly shocked!</p><p>The other party was also using the godly sword technique. These people were from evil spirit.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s current soul power was strong. In addition, he had a spiritual God defensive treasure. He blocked the opponent’s attack. Lu Ming did not stop and slashed out with his combat sword.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat sword slashed at the other party’s combat saber.</p><p>The other party was at the Enlightenment Saint level, but Lu Ming’s current strength was so powerful that the other party’s body shook violently and was sent flying like a cannonball.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Yang tianzong seized the opportunity and his palm turned into a Dragon Claw. He grabbed out and killed the expert.</p><p>brothers, don’t resist. Enter my mountain and river diagram!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. His glabella glowed, and the mountain and river diagram flew out. With a roll, Tian Chui, Xue ningxin, Xiangxiang, and the other Dragon God Valley disciples were all taken into the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>There were too many saints on the other side. Anyone below the Saint realm had no way of resisting. They would only be killed. It was better to put them all away.</p><p>Seeing that the disciples of Dragon God Valley had been taken away, the sages of Dragon God Valley were excited. They didn’t need to take care of the disciples of Dragon God Valley anymore. They fought with their full strength.</p><p>The Dragon God Valley sect had almost no losses, but the other sects had suffered great losses.</p><p>The black-robed experts seemed to have set their sights on the young people below the Saint realm. Some of them rushed through the encirclement and attacked the young people. The major sects suffered heavy casualties.</p><p>“We’ll block them, you guys charge out!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>The Supreme Saints and Saints of the major sects used their full power to hold back the black-robed Saints so that the young men could break out of the siege.</p><p>“Charge, charge, charge!”</p><p>All those below the Saint realm rushed out of the Cang Mountain.</p><p>However, before they could rush out, attacks burst out from the Green Mountain and killed these young men. Suddenly, many people were killed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>From the grey Mountain, more figures rushed out. There were so many of them that they were so densely packed that not even water could pass through the surroundings of the grey Mountain.</p><p>However, these people were not Saints. They were all half-Saints and high-level martial Royal realm.</p><p>These people were engaged in fierce battles with the disciples of the various sects.</p><p>An evil-looking young man appeared in the sky. He was wearing a black robe and had a cold smile on his face.</p><p>Behind him stood four middle-aged men. Their auras were wild and terrifying. They were far stronger than ordinary Saint realm experts.</p><p>The evil-looking young man’s eyes swept across the room and finally landed on Lu Ming. A cold killing intent flashed in his eyes.</p><p>“Whoever kills this person will be heavily rewarded!”</p><p>The evil-looking young man pointed at Lu Ming and his voice echoed throughout the entire area.</p><p>Many black-robed Saints immediately looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“This kid is mine!”</p><p>All of a sudden, the black-robed Saints pounced on Lu Ming.</p><p>“All of you, get lost!”</p><p>Yang tianzong let out a long roar and his entire body was covered in dragon scales. It was as if he had transformed into a real Dragon as he tried his best to resist. However, there were too many enemies. Although yang tianzong was strong and was already at the great circle of the bright Saint stage, he could not resist too many enemies.</p><p>There were still some people who rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Junior Brother, be careful!”</p><p>Yang tianzong reminded Longyuan mountain.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long roar. He held his combat sword and the Laws of Chaos filled the air as he stepped forward.</p><p>At the same time, a bubble appeared on his shoulder.</p><p>In this life-and-death battle, bubble could no longer be bothered to hide in the pagoda. Hiding in the pagoda would ultimately affect her combat strength.</p><p>Bubbles waved her claws and transparent bubbles appeared, enveloping the three black-robed men. The three black-robed men froze in their movements.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and swung his sword. Two black-robed Saints were killed. Only a peak bright Saint broke the transparent bubble at the critical moment and blocked Lu Ming’s attack. He was sent flying.</p><p>“Trash, if you go again, this person will definitely die!”</p><p>The evil-looking young man’s voice was heard again in the sky. He seemed to be filled with killing intent toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at this person and his heart trembled.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was unfamiliar with the young man’s appearance, he could still remember the look in his eyes.</p><p>elder mo hun, you’re elder mo hun!</p><p>Lu Ming roared.</p><p>The evil-looking young man’s expression changed and he sneered, ” “Brat, your memory is not bad. I didn’t expect that in just a few years, your cultivation would soar to this level. Damn it!”</p><p>The other party was actually elder mo hun.</p><p>Back then, not long after Lu Ming joined Dragon God Valley, he was arranged by Yin Feng to accept a mission. During the mission, Lu Ming met elder mo hun of evil spirit.</p><p>In the end, elder mo hun was severely injured by the prison-suppressing stele and his physical body was destroyed, but his soul escaped.</p><p>These evil-looking young men must be elder mo Hun’s soul, and they must have been reborn.</p><p>evil spirit! The other party is from evil spirit!</p><p>Lu Ming roared loudly, his voice spreading throughout the entire area.</p><p>Many people were shocked. So it was evil spirit. No wonder they attacked all the sects at the same time.</p><p>“So what if I know? None of you will be able to leave today!”</p><p>Elder mo hun sneered.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
