It was terrifying.</p><p>The attack of the evil god race member was instantly destroyed. After being struck by the terrifying power, his body trembled violently and he retreated rapidly while spitting out large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>A six-star heavenly Emperor was actually repelled by Lu Ming in one move and spat out a large mouthful of blood. How was this possible?</p><p>Lu Ming was so powerful?</p><p>Even the Titan longhorn beetle blinked its huge eyes, thinking that it was seeing things.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted as he forced his opponent to retreat. He continued to control the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron to attack his opponent.</p><p>“Quickly come and help me!”</p><p>The evil god race member was shocked and retreated frantically.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At that moment, three more people charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>The three of them were all six-star heavenly emperors.</p><p>In addition to the evil god tribe, there were a total of four six-star heavenly emperors.</p><p>Two members of the evil god tribe, two natives.</p><p>The four of them unleashed their full power and attacked together, unleashing a terrifying attack.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The four six-star heavenly emperors ‘attacks hit the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron one after another. The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron kept shaking, but the four powerhouses were also forced to retreat and almost spit blood.</p><p>“Peakheavenly Emperor!”</p><p>One of them said with a grave expression.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was already equivalent to a peak heavenly Emperor.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to control the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, blasting it at the other party continuously.</p><p>The nine divine cauldrons resonated with each other. The roars of Dragons reverberated, and the power was extremely strong.</p><p>The other party had four six-star heavenly emperors, but they were still no match for him. They were suppressed by Lu Ming and kept retreating.</p><p>At this moment, heavenly venerate six sages and the others had already arrived and were attacking the other party. It was difficult to tell who was stronger.</p><p>This way, the pressure on the heaven realm would be greatly reduced.</p><p>“Haha, good, good!”</p><p>The Titan longhorn beetle laughed as it charged forward with all its might.</p><p>His strength was really amazing. Even though he was only a five star heavenly Emperor, he could still fight a six star heavenly Emperor for a while.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>After a series of collisions, the other party had to retreat with each collision. Lu Ming had the upper hand.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Finally, the evil god tribe member who had been injured by Lu Ming could not take it anymore and spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Come and help us!”</p><p>The evil god tribe member roared.</p><p>There were a total of nine six-star heavenly emperors. The other two wanted to rush over to help and attack Lu Ming together.</p><p>However, the Titan longhorn beetle, the nine lives devilish silkworm, and the others used all their strength to hold their opponent back.</p><p>As a result, the battle turned into a stalemate. Lu Ming’s side even had a slight upper hand.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it!”</p><p>Duo Lei roared, his face contorted.</p><p>It was Lu Ming again. Lu Ming had destroyed it.</p><p>Today, they could have killed the few heaven realm experts in one fell swoop. However, because of Lu Ming’s appearance, the battle situation was now tilted.</p><p>“LuMing, die!”</p><p>Duo Lei’s face was contorted in anger. He roared and launched an attack at Lu Ming, but it was blocked by the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming was controlling the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, he was not afraid of duo Lei’s attack at all.</p><p>“Duo Lei, how have you been? no, you don’t look good. Haha!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed sarcastically. At the same time, he intensified his attacks, forcing the other party to retreat.</p><p>The four six-star heavenly emperors could only block him for a short time, but they couldn’t hold on for long.</p><p>“Retreat, retreat!”</p><p>Duo Lei bellowed and launched a frenzied attack. After exchanging a few moves with the armored burly man, he took the time to launch a few attacks at Lu Ming, blocking his Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>The four six-star heavenly emperors took the opportunity to retreat and join the other five six-star heavenly emperors.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to attack.</p><p>However, the other party did not linger in the battle and quickly retreated.</p><p>Duo Lei had also shaken off his opponent and joined up with the rest of the evil god tribe members, retreating as they fought.</p><p>The forces of duo Lei and the rest were only slightly weaker than that of Lu Ming’s group. If they were bent on retreating now, it would be difficult for Lu Ming’s group to make them stay.</p><p>After chasing for a while, duo Lei and the others finally retreated.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I didn’t expect your abilities to have reached such a level. It’s all thanks to your help this time!”</p><p>The Titan longhorn beetle walked over to express its gratitude.</p><p>“Senior, you’re too kind. I also relied on the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and put away the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>After that, everyone introduced themselves to each other.</p><p>Lu Ming knew that the burly man in armor was called Zhan Li. He was a top expert who rose to power after the ancient battle. He had a peak heavenly Emperor cultivation base and had been cultivating in the lair of Zulong all this while.</p><p>” Seniors, do you know what happened? On our way here, we discovered that the local major powers seem to be working together with the evil god tribe!”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Something big has happened!”</p><p>Zhan Li sighed.</p><p>The Titan longhorn beetle, the nine lives devilish silkworm, and the others also had grave expressions.</p><p>Lu Ming and the six sages were both shocked. Even powerhouses like the Titan longhorn beetle, who had seen many great things, were like this. What exactly had happened?</p><p>the reason why the surrounding forces are all listening to the evil god tribe and cooperating with them to deal with the heaven realm is because of the order from the yellow spring Empire!</p><p>The Titan longhorn beetle said.</p><p>“Yellow Springs Empire, it’s really the yellow Springs Empire. Senior, what happened to the yellow Springs Empire?” Lu Ming asked.</p><p>the yellow Springs world’s biggest cursed land is within the yellow Springs Empire. It’s said that there’s a life fruit inside that can cure even the most serious injuries. It can even cure the injuries of deities!</p><p>however, if you want to enter the cursed land, you must get the help of the upper echelons of the yellow spring Empire. Therefore, senior ancestral Dragon and the non-human race’s Saint ancestor have come to the yellow spring Empire to cooperate with them. In this way, there will be competition!</p><p>we’ve received news that senior ancestral Dragon was defeated. The divine ancestor of the non-human race has won the trust of the upper echelons of the yellow spring Empire!</p><p>The Titanos explained.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were shocked.</p><p>Zulong had lost in the competition for the yellow Springs Empire!</p><p>They finally understood why the surrounding major forces would cooperate with the evil god tribe to deal with the people from the heaven realm.</p><p>That was the order of the yellow Springs Empire. Who in the yellow Springs world dared to disobey the order of the yellow Springs Empire?</p><p>“Then, senior ancestral Dragon, he…”</p><p>Someone asked in a hoarse voice.</p><p>“His life and death is unknown…”</p><p>The Titan longhorn beetle said.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>It was as if Thunder had exploded in everyone’s minds.</p><p>His life and death were unknown!</p><p>No one knew whether the ancestral Dragon was Dead or Alive. This was an unbearable blow to any living being in the heaven realm.</p><p>The ancestral Dragon was the backbone of the heaven realm.</p><p>Now, in the entire heaven realm and the primordial realm, only zu long had reached the martial God Realm.</p><p>The evil god tribe, on the other hand, had the non-human sacred ancestor and the sacred ancestor bloodheart, who only had a wisp of his bloodline left.</p><p>Within the war god level, they had always been at a disadvantage, and they constantly felt a sense of danger.</p><p>If something happened to the ancestral Dragon, then there would be no hope for the heaven realm and the primordial realm. They wouldn’t be a match for the evil god tribe and would be doomed to be destroyed.</p><p>Heavenly venerate six sages and the others all looked desperate.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
