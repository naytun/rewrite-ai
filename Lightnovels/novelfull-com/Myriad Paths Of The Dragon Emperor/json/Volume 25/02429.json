He continued to expand at an increasing speed.</p><p>1.1 million, 1.2 million, 1.5 million, two million miles …</p><p>it’s actually still expanding. In that case, continue to refine it. Refine it for me</p><p>Lu Ming kept taking out Supreme-grade raw gemstones and stones of chaos.</p><p>A large number of Supreme-grade raw gemstones were refined.</p><p>Fortunately, Lu Ming had abundant resources. Over the years, he had killed many opponents and accumulated a large number of resources.</p><p>Furthermore, he had obtained too many resources on the void God Island.</p><p>There were over 20000 chaos gems and primordial chaos gems each.</p><p>There were countless Supreme-grade raw stones. Lu Ming did not even count them. If it were an ordinary person, they would not be able to afford to consume them.</p><p>Lu Ming did not care about the resources at all. No matter how many resources he had, the most practical thing was to turn them into abilities.</p><p>As a large number of resources were refined and transformed, Lu Ming’s small world continued to expand wildly.</p><p>Three million miles, four million miles …</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming’s small world expanded to ten million kilometers before it stopped.</p><p>The others had just broken through to the great emperor realm and their small world was only one million miles wide. However, Lu Ming’s small world had a radius of ten million miles, which was ten times the size of others.</p><p>This was the distance between the length and width. As for the surface area, it was unknown how many times it was, at least a hundred times.</p><p>This was already comparable to a small world of the heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p>Of course, the amount of resources consumed was also shocking.</p><p>Lu Ming had used up three thousand chaos gems.</p><p>As for the Supreme-grade raw stones, there were an even more shocking number of them. Lu Ming did not even count them.</p><p>However, it was all worth it. Lu Ming could feel that the world Energy in his body was extremely rich. It was not like the world Energy that an ordinary great emperor could possess.</p><p>I’m still a one star great emperor, but my world Energy is many times more powerful than the world Energy of other one star great emperors!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. Flis current world Energy was really too strong.</p><p>eh, there’s a different type of energy in the world force!</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming sensed that his World Energy was mixed with a trace of purple-gold energy. Moreover, Lu Ming felt that this energy was extremely shocking and much stronger than World Energy.</p><p>“Could it be my great Dao …”</p><p>Lu Ming thought of the great Dao that he controlled. With a thought, his body emitted a purple light. There was a kind of power that he controlled. The power was extremely mysterious, but it exuded a terrifying power as if it ruled over everything.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming seemed to have become one with the entire world. It was as if the energy of the entire world could be used by him.</p><p>He dominated everything. Lu Ming seemed to be able to dominate everything.</p><p>With a single thought, a mountain in the mountain and river diagram in the distance turned into ashes and dissipated.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p><p>This power was too terrifying. Fie had only thought about it.</p><p>“This is my great Dao. No, great Dao definitely doesn’t have such powerful might. I seem to have become one with time. However, it’s different from the heavenly Dao…”</p><p>Lu Ming’s thoughts were filled with doubts.</p><p>He realized that the great Dao he controlled was completely different from the other great DAOs. He was certain that the other great DAOs would not be able to withstand a single blow from him.</p><p>However, it was also different from the heavenly Dao.</p><p>Even his power of the world was mixed with this power.</p><p>It was different from the great Dao and also different from the heavenly Dao.</p><p>It seemed to be a brand new Dao.</p><p>it should be related to my cultivation. 1 cultivate 81 types of nomological laws, which is why this wonderful Dao was born!</p><p>Lu Ming analyzed.</p><p>The fundamental structure of the world was the laws.</p><p>There were thousands of laws, but the core was the ten strongest laws and many King path laws.</p><p>Although there were many other ordinary laws, their effects were far less than the ten ultimate laws and the king path laws.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he had mastered all the ultimate maxims and most of the king path maxims. After breaking through to the great emperor realm, he had mastered a mysterious Dao.</p><p>“I wonder how powerful this Dao of mine is?”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered, then closed his eyes and started to experiment.</p><p>When he activated this wonderful technique, he seemed to have become one with the heaven and earth. Flis consciousness drifted out and extended out of the stone room. Lu Ming saw everything in the other stone rooms.</p><p>He continued to extend his consciousness outwards. Not long after, Lu Ming saw a layer of light screen.</p><p>This light screen covered the entire area.</p><p>At the very top of the light screen, there was a round pearl that was emitting a bright light.</p><p>The light screen was formed by this bead.</p><p>could it be that this is the restriction of the eternal cage? a restriction formed by the evil god race’s sacred ancestor’s treasure? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>“If we can open this restriction, we can go out!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up but then he smiled helplessly.</p><p>Qing Cang and the others had said that not even a peak heavenly Emperor could penetrate this light curtain. Moreover, it had a terrifying offensive power that could even kill a peak heavenly Emperor.</p><p>Then, how could he open it?</p><p>However, Lu Ming really wanted to give it a try. He had a feeling that he could dominate everything. Fie could even open the light screen here.</p><p>This was the feeling he got from that wonderful Dao.</p><p>“I’ll try!”</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming made up his mind and decided to give it a try.</p><p>A wisp of purple-gold light flew towards the light screen. It was the wondrous Dao.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Waves spread out from the light screen, and finally, a crack appeared.</p><p>it’s a success! It’s actually a success!</p><p>Lu Ming was ecstatic. The light screen seemed to be under his control. It was an extremely mysterious feeling.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming quickly put away the wonderful way and the light screen returned to normal.</p><p>Duo Lei was in control of the treasure and Lu Ming was afraid that he would alert him.</p><p>At this moment, duo Lei, who was cultivating in a secret room, suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p>“Could it be that someone is attacking the restriction? You really don’t know what’s good for you!”</p><p>Duo Lei mumbled as he observed through the bead.</p><p>He controlled the bead and could observe everything that was happening on the light screen at any time.</p><p>However, duo Lei didn’t find anything. Fie didn’t find anyone attacking the light curtain.</p><p>“Could it be an illusion?”</p><p>Duo Lei frowned. Fie then carefully observed for a while, but did not find anything, so he ignored it.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>It really worked. He could really open the restriction. This meant that he could leave at any time.</p><p>this wondrous Dao is too wondrous, too profound!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and his palm emitted a purple-gold radiance. It was the physical manifestation of the wonderful Dao.</p><p>I’ve never heard of this Dao before, but it seems to be able to dominate the world. Let’s call it the Dao of domination!</p><p>Lu Ming came up with a name.</p><p>The Dao of a ruler!</p><p>“I don’t know how strong my current combat strength is!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>Before his breakthrough, Lu Ming could fight a weaker one-star Celestial Emperor to a draw if he used all his strength. Now that he had made a breakthrough, his world power had increased tremendously, and he had mastered the ruler’s Dao. Flis combat strength had definitely soared..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
