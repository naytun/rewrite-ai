They could be said to be extremely powerful, far above storm and Mo ping.</p><p>He was definitely a three star great emperor or higher, or even a four star great emperor.</p><p>Of course, they had been cultivating for a long time. At least, they had been cultivating for a few thousand years, much longer than Lu Ming.</p><p>The three of them were very confident. They stepped forward and surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>The people around them retreated, giving them enough distance to fight. “You guys… Let’s attack together!11</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes swept across the three of them as his indifferent voice rang out. What?</p><p>Everyone was stunned!</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to fight one against three. He wanted to challenge three people alone?</p><p>How arrogant!</p><p>what an arrogant human brat! This is the first time I’ve seen such an arrogant human!</p><p>One of the three young men licked his lips, his eyes cold.</p><p>he wants to challenge all three of us at the same time. Who does he think he is?</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>of course I’ll agree to it. I’ll beat him up until he can’t take care of himself!</p><p>The three Longevity Roll experts sneered, their eyes growing more and more sinister.</p><p>Since Lu Ming was asking for it, they naturally had to fulfill his wish.</p><p>The three young men moved and surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>Almost at the same time, they made their moves. Three different attacks were launched at Lu Ming with shocking power.</p><p>The moment the three of them attacked, Lu Ming could tell their abilities. Two four star great emperors and one peak three star great emperor. Under normal circumstances, such a lineup would not have any problems dealing with someone who had cultivated for less than two hundred years. However, they had encountered Lu Ming and that was a problem.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s muscles trembled and his body shot out like a cannonball towards one of the people.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming reached out with his large hand and the other party’s attack was immediately destroyed. Then, his claw did not stop. In an instant, he grabbed the other party’s throat.</p><p>Hurry up!</p><p>It was too fast!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm was unbelievably fast. Before the other party could react, Lu Ming had already grabbed his neck.</p><p>Then, with a powerful swing, the other party was like a meteorite, crashing towards the ground.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The ground trembled and the other party screamed in pain. Who knew how many bones in his body were broken, and he was truly unable to take care of himself.</p><p>However, the ground here was extremely firm, and only a shallow pit was formed when the other party crashed into the ground.</p><p>At this moment, the other two people’s attacks were about to land on Lu Ming. Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he dodged their attacks. Then, he attacked one of them.</p><p>The man was slightly surprised, but he did not panic.</p><p>The one that Lu Ming had easily defeated was the weakest among the three of them. He was only a three star great emperor, while he was a four star great emperor.</p><p>A four star great emperor had already reached the high level great emperor realm, and his battle prowess was far beyond that of a three star great emperor. “Meteor fist!”</p><p>He bellowed in rage and his fist shot towards Lu Ming like a shooting star at an astonishing speed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming threw a punch as well. The two fists collided heavily. Kachaa!</p><p>When the two fists collided, the youth’s arm was bent, and the bones in his arm were broken. The scales on his skin flew everywhere, and his body trembled as he retreated.</p><p>His eyes were filled with deep fear.</p><p>He felt that Lu Ming’s strength was too strong. It was as if he could move mountains and tread the sea. It was difficult to resist.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Then, he was shocked and retreated quickly because Lu Ming had arrived again. However, how could his speed be compared to Lu Ming’s? as he retreated, Lu Ming had already arrived.</p><p>Suppression, it was a complete suppression!</p><p>Although the foreign youth tried his best to resist, he only managed to block two moves before he followed in the footsteps of the previous person. Lu Ming grabbed his throat and threw him to the ground, lying on the ground, unable to move.</p><p>It took time to describe, but all of this happened in an instant.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two Longevity Roll experts were crushed by Lu Ming.</p><p>The remaining person was almost scared to death.</p><p>He had been able to deal with the three star great emperor, but now, even a four star great emperor had been crushed. He was panicking.</p><p>He retreated decisively, like a stream of light.</p><p>“You want to leave?”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed coldly. His muscles trembled and the space exploded. Lu Ming charged towards the other party and closed in on him in an instant.</p><p>The other party tried his best to resist, but the result was already set in stone. After two moves, he crashed into the ground like a meteorite, unable to move. “This… This…”</p><p>The eyes of the surrounding non-humans almost popped out of their sockets. Looking at the three Longevity Roll experts lying on the ground, they felt as if they were dreaming.</p><p>Those were three experts on the longevity Roll, and their rankings were not low either. However, they could not even withstand a single blow from Lu Ming. In just a few moves, the three of them were lying on the ground like dead dogs. Terrifying!</p><p>They finally knew how terrifying Lu Ming’s abilities were. Previously, he had not used his full strength at all.</p><p>Perhaps, he had not used his full strength yet.</p><p>How powerful was Lu Ming now?</p><p>Mo tianluo, mo ping, storm, and the others all turned pale.</p><p>Lu Ming’s ability was beyond their imagination.</p><p>The commotion here had also alarmed some of the experts on the holy mountain.</p><p>Quite a few people flew over.</p><p>There were more and more people here. When the people behind found out about the situation, they were all shocked.</p><p>“With this kind of strength, could it be that your so-called Longevity Roll doesn’t have any stronger experts?”</p><p>Lu Ming spoke, his voice filled with faint contempt.</p><p>All the alien races didn’t look good.</p><p>In the vast evil god World, there were countless experts.</p><p>But now, a human youth was mocking them for not having any experts at the edge of the holy mountain. This was really embarrassing.</p><p>this kid is looking for death. Let me slap him to death!</p><p>An extremely powerful expert from the Holy Mountain said ferociously. However, Jia Yi released a terrifying aura and scared that person away.</p><p>“The Kings have given the order that this person can not die. The rest doesn’t matter!”</p><p>Jia Yi’s voice rang out, causing many people to stop.</p><p>They naturally understood what the ‘Kings’ meant.</p><p>The Kings referred to the Kings of the ten royal families.</p><p>What was Lu Ming’s background? he actually made the ‘Kings’ order that he could not die!</p><p>This made all the alien races even more curious.</p><p>“Is there no one else to fight? What a disappointment!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s next words made many of the alien races sulk. They really felt that Lu Ming deserved a beating. Many powerful beings really wanted to go out and beat Lu Ming up.</p><p>this guy is very strong. In my opinion, unless it’s an expert ranked in the top twenty on the longevity Roll, no one below the twentieth rank is his match!</p><p>good. We’ll spread the news on the holy mountain. The top 20 of the longevity Roll will definitely rush over when they hear it!</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Many people discussed and then flew toward the holy mountain.</p><p>“Lu Ming, if you have the guts, just wait here. There will be experts coming to fight you!”</p><p>Mo tianluo stared at Lu Ming and said.</p><p>“As you wish!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and then closed his eyes to rest in the air.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
