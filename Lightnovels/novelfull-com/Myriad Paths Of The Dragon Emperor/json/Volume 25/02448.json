He had never expected that Lu Ming would suddenly appear in two world city after more than a hundred years.</p><p>“Lu Ming, How did you come back?”</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu’s voice was trembling with excitement.</p><p>Lu Ming was very touched. He briefly recounted what had happened all these years.</p><p>Saint ancestor bloodheart, Saint ancestor of the non-human race, ancestral Dragon…</p><p>The eternal universe heavenly Emperor was extremely shocked, and he seemed to be digesting this information.</p><p>In the heaven realm, there were many heavenly emperors who didn’t know about the existence of the ancestral Dragon. The eternal universe heavenly Emperor was one of them. Now that he knew so many secrets, he naturally needed to digest them.</p><p>The eternal universe heavenly Emperor was shocked. He did not expect Lu Mmg to experience so much in the evil god Realm.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ve broken through to the heavenly Emperor realm?”</p><p>The heavenly Emperor’s eyes widened as he sized Lu Ming up. He could sense that Lu Ming’s blood and Qi were surging in an astonishing manner.</p><p>my physical body has made a breakthrough. I’m lucky to have the help of senior ancestral Dragon. Otherwise, I would need at least another thousand years!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Good,good, good!”</p><p>The eternal universe heavenly Emperor said a few “good” words.</p><p>“Senior, what’s the current situation?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>three years ago, a large number of strong cultivators suddenly appeared in the heaven realm. They came to two world city and another battlefield to participate in the battle. They claimed to be from the prison suppression field. It seems that they were from the prison suppression field that came with you from the evil god field!</p><p>with the help ot the Musters from the prison realm, the combat power of the heaven realm has increased greatly. In the past few years, for some reason, the alien races have been hiding and not taking the initiative to fight They have become defensive. All these years, we have been sending people out of the city and tailing their way to the camp of the alien races on the other side of the battlefield. There is still an Army attacking there!</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu explained.</p><p>the alien race has actually turned into a defense? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly stunned.</p><p>Even with the help of the prison suppression field, the heaven realm’s overall strength was still not as good as the alien races.</p><p>The non-humankind wouldn’t hide like turtles to defend.</p><p>could it be that the outsiders want to preserve their strength and launch a full- scale attack after Saint ancestor bloodheart recovers? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart could not help but skip a beat. He thought of this possibility and his gaze turned solemn.</p><p>This possibility was the highest.</p><p>“Lu Ming, some of your friends are also following the Army to attack the alien race. They want to capture an important figure of the enemy and ask about you!”</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu said.</p><p>“My friend…”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart slapped a beat. It was very likely that it was dandan, bubbles and the rest.                  ’</p><p>“Senior, I’ll go take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>yes, be careful. Follow me!</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu said as he flew towards the city walls.</p><p>“That is… Lu Ming?”</p><p>“Nest, who did I see? Lu Ming?”</p><p>“Wasn’t lu Ming captured by the alien race? why is he here?”</p><p>“Could it be that everything is just a rumor?”</p><p>Along the way, those who saw Lu Ming were stunned and tongue-tied.</p><p>More than a hundred years ago, Lu Ming was captured by the alien race and it caused a great commotion in the Tai Qing heavenly region.</p><p>Lu Ming’s talent was too high and many people had high hopes for him. He did not expect that he would be captured by the alien race. It was a huge loss.</p><p>Many people thought that Lu Ming had been captured by the alien race for more than a hundred years and that he was most likely dead. They did not expect him to appear in two world city.</p><p>When they reached thecity wall, the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor ordered bls men to open the formation and Lu Ming flew out.</p><p>After flying out of two world city, Lu Ming exploded and flew towards the other side of the battlefield at an astonishing speed. The void exploded continuously.</p><p>“What a fast speed!”</p><p>Those who saw Lu Ming’s speed were shocked. In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming disappeared from everyone’s sight.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s current speed, he was too fast. Not long after, a military camp with no end In sight appeared In front of him. At this time, a great battle was going on.</p><p>On the side of the heaven realm, they took the initiative to attack the camp of the non-humans, and the battle between the two sides was very fierce.</p><p>At this time, a camp of the non-humans was attacked by a heavenly realm Army.</p><p>The commander of this heavenly realm Army was none other than dandan.</p><p>Back then, dandan’s cultivation base had already reached the peak great emperor realm. After more than a hundred years of cultivation, dandan had also successfully broken through and reached the heavenly Emperor realm. Following behind dandan were bubbles, Phoenix spirit, Long Chen, Ouyang Wushuang, and the others.</p><p>After more than a hundred years, everyone’s cultivation had improved greatly.</p><p>Most of them had entered the true Emperor realm.</p><p>In addition, there were also some other experts from the heaven realm.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Dandan roared and turned into a giant turtle, fighting a heavenly Emperor of the foreign race.</p><p>The battle between the two was extremely intense, but it was obvious that dandan was stronger. The other party was not her match at all and was suppressed by dandan.</p><p>there’s a Prince of the alien race in this military camp. I must capture him and ask him about Lu Ming’s whereabouts. I can even exchange him for Lu Ming!</p><p>Dandan sent a message to everyone.</p><p>Back then, when Lu Ming was captured, the other party had shouted that they could not harm Lu Ming’s life. Therefore, they still had hope that he was not dead.</p><p>Bubbles and the others launched a fierce attack.</p><p>Bubbles ‘cultivation base had also reached the great emperor realm, and she had even reached the three-star great emperor realm. Right now, bubbles had mastered a great Dao, and her use of spacetime had reached a high degree of perfection.</p><p>Her body flickered, and a large number of foreign beings were imprisoned.</p><p>Some of the weaker ones were directly reversed in time, regressing to an even weaker stage and were easily killed.</p><p>Even great emperors would find it difficult to survive as long as their cultivation bases were not too far above bubbles’.</p><p>In the depths of the camp, a purple-haired alien was watching coldly.</p><p>This person was an acquaintance of Lu Ming’s, the Prince of the alien race, mo tianluo.</p><p>“Lu Ming’s friend? Let’s see how you guys die.”</p><p>Mo tianluo sneered and then sent a message to the heavenly Emperor who was fighting with dandan.</p><p>The heavenly Emperor suddenly exchanged a few blows with dandan and retreated.</p><p>“Retreat! Protect the Prince!”</p><p>The foreign celestial Thearch roared as he retreated.</p><p>“If you want to leave, then stay!”</p><p>Dandan gave chase, but the other party was also very fast. He retreated to mo tianluo’s side and retreated with mo tianluo.</p><p>Dandan and the others chased after them and killed a large number of alien races along the way.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Suddenly, dandan called for a stop.</p><p>“Why didn’t you continue?”</p><p>Someone was puzzled.</p><p>it’s better to be careful. The other party seems to be deliberately luring us here.</p><p>If there’s a trap, we’ll be in trouble. Let’s retreat first!</p><p>After all, dandan had lived for a long time and was very meticulous.</p><p>The others nodded.</p><p>They didn’t chase after him, but retreated.</p><p>In front of him, mo tianluo also stopped, his eyes cold.</p><p>“You’re not chasing? Quite meticulous, but did he think that this would work? Kill them all!”</p><p>Mo tianluo roared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>Following mo tianluo’s roar, the ground suddenly exploded, and many figures flew out. They were all from the foreign races.</p><p>Two of them had shockingly strong auras and were actually powerhouses of the heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p>The alien race had indeed set up an ambush here.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
