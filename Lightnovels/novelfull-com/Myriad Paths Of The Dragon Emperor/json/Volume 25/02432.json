It hit the light curtain of the restriction and caused layers of ripples.</p><p>Lu Ming used the path of domination to break the restriction.</p><p>The Dao of a sovereign ruled over all things, and it could even rule over this restrictive barrier.</p><p>ripples appeared on the barrier, and Qing Cang and the others watched</p><p>with wide eyes.</p><p>Although they heard from Lu Ming that he could break the restriction, they had not seen it with their own eyes. They could not help but feel nervous.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, the restrictive barrier shook. Then, a crack appeared on it. The crack grew bigger and bigger, forming a huge hole.</p><p>It opened!</p><p>The light screen of the restrictive spell was activated!</p><p>Qing Cang and the others were ecstatic.</p><p>As for those who had been invited and didn’t know the original plan, they were</p><p>all dumbfounded and couldn’t believe their eyes.</p><p>The light curtain of the restriction was actually opened by Lu Ming, who had not broken through to the heavenly Emperor realm. How was this possible?</p><p>Legend had it that the light screen of the eternal cage was formed by a treasure of the non-human race’s divine ancestor. It was indestructible and even peak heavenly emperors couldn’t break it.</p><p>But now, Lu Ming had broken it.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>Someone gave himself a tight slap.</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>Someone asked in surprise.</p><p>I’m checking to see if I’m dreaming. Am I daydreaming because I want to go out too much? so I’m not, hahaha!</p><p>The man burst out laughing.</p><p>The others were speechless.</p><p>“Go, go quickly. Otherwise, when duo Lei finds out, none of us will be able to</p><p>leave!”</p><p>Qing Cang roared and ran forward.</p><p>The others also seemed to wake up from a dream and ran after him.</p><p>“Hurry up, I can’t hold on for long!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted as well. He realized that the energy consumed to open the light screen of the restriction was terrifying. Now, his World Energy was flowing away at an alarming rate.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>Qing Cang, Wu tai, and the others quickly rushed out and finally arrived outside the light curtain.</p><p>At this time, duo Lei, who had been in seclusion, suddenly opened his eyes. His face was extremely ugly.</p><p>“Damnit!”</p><p>He had discovered Lu Ming and the rest instantly through the treasure of the</p><p>divine ancestor.</p><p>He was extremely shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming could actually open the light screen of the restriction. This was unprecedented.</p><p>“Damn it, none of you can leave. Die!”</p><p>Duo Lei roared as he controlled the sacred ancestor treasure.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the bead above the eternal cage began to shake violently. It exuded a terrifying aura, and the restrictive barrier trembled violently.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming felt a terrifying force pressing down on him. His body shook violently and he spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>The hole that he had opened up was healing rapidly.</p><p>Fortunately, everyone had escaped. Lu Ming’s muscles trembled and he rushed out of the light screen before it could heal.</p><p>” None of you will be able to escape!”</p><p>Duo Lei’s roar came out of the eternal cage as a terrifying aura burst out and spread out for a million miles.</p><p>Duo Lei and the peak heavenly Emperor realm experts had gone mad. It was earth-shattering and terrifying.</p><p>At this moment, those who hadn’t managed to escape from the eternal cage were all shocked.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>“What’s happening? Duo Lei has gone mad!’</p><p>could it be that someone is trying to escape? who is so bold?</p><p>Many people were making guesses.</p><p>everyone, attack! Pursue the escapees and kill them without mercy!</p><p>Duo Lei’s voice was heard again. He chased after Lu Ming and the rest at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>All the alien races in the eternal cage were alarmed and they chased after Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Someone has escaped!”</p><p>The remaining people who didn’t escape were dumbfounded.</p><p>Someone actually managed to escape.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, outside the light screen, Qing Cang howled into the sky, his roar shaking the heavens.</p><p>A dazzling golden light erupted from Qing Gang’s body, and the endless golden light hit the chain armor.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The chain-armor kept exploding, and Qing Gang’s aura became stronger and stronger.</p><p>Qing Cang used to be one of the top ten Battle Beasts. He was a peak heavenly Emperor and his combat strength was amazing.</p><p>He could break the chain armor with his own strength.</p><p>However, in the past, when he was inside the light curtain, he couldn’t get out even if he broke his armor. He would be suppressed by the Holy ancestor weapon controlled by duo Lei.</p><p>But now that he was outside, he had no scruples.</p><p>“Qing Cang!”</p><p>A loud roar came from the distance as a burly figure appeared.</p><p>It was duo Lei!</p><p>Duo Lei had arrived!</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A destructive light burst out of duo Lei’s third eye. This destructive light turned into a giant hand that passed through the light screen and bombarded Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>He was going to kill Lu Ming, Qing Cang, and the others.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>break! Qing Cang roared as a terrifying power exploded from his body, destroying the chain armor.</p><p>With his chain armor destroyed, Qing Gang’s aura became even more terrifying. His body emitted an infinite amount of golden light as his body rapidly transformed into a giant lion.</p><p>It was a giant lion with nine heads and a golden body that looked like it was carved from gold.</p><p>It was the nine-headed Golden Lion, one of the top ten Battle Beasts.</p><p>Roar! Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>The nine heads howled, and the entire eternal cage shook violently. The space around it exploded into pieces.</p><p>Duo Lei’s destructive hand also shook crazily, but it was blocked.</p><p>At this moment, Wu tai and the others were also crazily attacking the chain armor.</p><p>However, they weren’t as strong as Qing Cang, so they couldn’t breakthrough at all.</p><p>in the distance, many powerful auras rose up. The other powerful beings of the alien race were also coming.</p><p>“Elder brother Wu, let me help you!”</p><p>Lu Ming came to Wu Tai’s side and used his nominator’s power to help Wu tai break the chains and armor.</p><p>If a ruler’s power could break through the barriers set up by a non-human sacred ancestor’s weapon, it should be able to break through this armor as well. And sure enough, as soon as the sovereign’s power poured into the armor, the seal was destroyed. In the blink of an eye, all of the sealing power was broken.</p><p>boom!</p><p>Wu Tai’s armor exploded and a terrifying aura emanated from his body.</p><p>“Hahaha, I’m finally free!”</p><p>Wu tai laughed out loud. His aura was like a smoke signal, rising to the sky and stirring up the wind and clouds.</p><p>Although Wu tai wasn’t as powerful as Qing Cang, he was still a terrifying existence. He had reached the level of a six-star heavenly Emperor.</p><p>He wasn’t far from the peak of the heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Duo Lei bellowed in anger and exploded with all his strength, launching a series of terrifying attacks.</p><p>However, Qing Cang wasn’t afraid of him at all. His nine lion heads roared and shot out beams of light as he fought with duo Lei.</p><p>The two of them had similar cultivation levels, and they were locked in a fierce battle.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
