It was as if he had struck a giant hammer. A powerful force surged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Then, as if there was no bone spine, labu’s waist bent into a terrifying arc. His legs were like two knives, slashing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The angle was extremely strange and tricky. An ordinary person might not be able to avoid it if they were not careful.</p><p>Lu Ming cast the six-feathered divine wings. Coupled with the vibration of his muscles, his speed was extremely fast. In a flash, he dodged the opponent’s attack.</p><p>his entire body can be turned into a weapon. Interesting. However, it’s time for this battle to end!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. There were a few more lights on his body.</p><p>“Reincarnation cutting!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted in a low voice. His palms seemed to be pushing the water and dancing in the air. A huge vortex appeared in the void.</p><p>This was a divine power that Lu Ming had created.</p><p>Over the years, Lu Ming had mastered ten ultimate maxims and seventy-one</p><p>king path maxims. With so many maxims intertwining with each other, they could produce countless divine powers.</p><p>Over the years, Lu Ming had made many attempts and developed some strange divine abilities.</p><p>However, each of these divine powers had different characteristics and the number of laws they contained was different.</p><p>Some contained more than ten types, some twenty types, some thirty types…</p><p>The more laws it contained, the more powerful it would naturally be.</p><p>However, he didn’t manage to research a divine power that contained 81 laws.</p><p>It was too difficult and required a long time to study.</p><p>This reincarnation cutting technique was a sacred art that contained more than</p><p>a dozen laws.</p><p>One of them was the reincarnation law, and the other two were the two strongest laws and 12 King path laws.</p><p>A huge vortex spun madly, containing a terrifying cutting power, and covered the labu in an instant.</p><p>Labu used all his strength to resist, and his body turned into all kinds of weapons, charging forward.</p><p>However, at this moment, Lu Ming rushed over and attacked continuously.</p><p>Finally, labu could not withstand Lu Ming’s continuous palm strikes. His body trembled violently and he was sent flying thousands of miles away. He spat out a mouthful of blood and his face turned pale.</p><p>Labu was defeated!</p><p>Many people looked at each other!</p><p>This human brat was way too strong.</p><p>Most importantly, they had heard that Lu Ming had only cultivated for less than two hundred years. How was it possible that he was so powerful in less than two hundred years?</p><p>In the depths of the sky, some people were also watching.</p><p>If others were to see this, they would definitely be shocked.</p><p>this was because any one of them could shake the evil god World.</p><p>This was because these people were the ‘Kings’ that others spoke of.</p><p>The evil god race was the king of the ten great king races.</p><p>However, not all of them came, but there were still five of them.</p><p>Each of these five was a peak expert in this world and were extremely terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming arrived at the holy mountain. These terrifying experts were very curious and came over to take a look.</p><p>After all, Lu Ming had the bloodline of the sacred ancestor bloodheart, this brat is actually strong to this extent. It’s really beyond expectations! this kind of genius has a higher ambition than the sky. It’s difficult to make him feel despair!</p><p>indeed, such people are all blessed with great fortune. They are all very confident. No matter what kind of predicament they face, they believe that they can get out of it!</p><p>The Kings of the non-human race discussed.</p><p>They knew very well what kind of person Lu Ming was because they themselves were such people. Otherwise, how could they stand at the peak of the world? there’s no other way. He’s already come this far, so he can only keep going.</p><p>There’ll always be someone on the longevity Roll who can suppress him!</p><p>An elderly non-human King said.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>The non-human Kings all nodded. They seemed to be very confident in one of the longevity roll’s members.</p><p>Below!</p><p>you’re quite capable, but it’s a pity that you’re still not good enough. Next!</p><p>Lu Ming cast a glance at labu and said indifferently.</p><p>At the scene, a few young men looked at each other.</p><p>They were all experts ranked between tenth and twentieth on the longevity</p><p>Roll, but they weren’t confident in winning if they were asked to fight.</p><p>Although they were stronger than labu, they were not that much stronger. They were afraid that if Lu Ming had held back just now, they would most likely be defeated.</p><p>Therefore, they were a little hesitant.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>At this moment, kui ju spoke and appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>This made the eyes of many people light up.</p><p>Kuiju was an expert ranked ninth on the longevity Roll.</p><p>The top ten of the longevity Roll were all freakishly powerful.</p><p>With kuiju taking action, they were at ease.</p><p>“Your name is Lu Ming?”</p><p>Kuiju looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“I’ve never heard of such an expert like you in the human race!”</p><p>Kui ju smiled, looking extremely handsome.</p><p>If he was in the human race, he would be able to charm countless young girls.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled casually and did not say much.</p><p>I don’t want to fight you fiercely either. That’s what ordinary people do. How about we decide the winner in three moves? ”</p><p>Kuiju said.</p><p>“Three moves?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>that’s right. If I can’t defeat you within three moves, it’ll be my loss. However, there’s a rule. You can’t Dodge, you can only meet force with force. How about it?”</p><p>Kui ju said with a cunning look in his eyes.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled, his smile very bright.</p><p>“This kid actually agreed!”</p><p>haha, this time, he’s going to lose even more. He actually agreed to exchange three moves with kuiju. He’s going to lose!</p><p>The other alien races laughed wildly in their hearts. They looked relieved, thinking that Lu Ming would lose for sure.</p><p>Lu Ming did not know the power of kuiju.</p><p>Lu Ming naturally noticed the reactions of the people around him.</p><p>However, would Lu Ming be afraid?</p><p>He wanted to defeat him in three moves?</p><p>Lu Ming was confident that no one below the heavenly Emperor could do it.</p><p>“Make your move!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was heard and the entire venue quieted down. Everyone widened their eyes and waited for the moment when Lu Ming was defeated.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Kuiju’s body gave off a powerful aura.</p><p>Six star great emperor!</p><p>Kuiju’s cultivation was already at six star great emperor, and he was currently emitting a purple light that was extremely bright.</p><p>Then, purple scales appeared on his skin.</p><p>Royal non-human races were originally similar to humans. They no longer had scales on their bodies. However, at this moment, purple scales appeared on kui ju’s body once again.</p><p>Countless scales covered the surface of kuiju.</p><p>it’s here. Kuiju is about to use this move. Lu Ming is bound to lose!</p><p>Mo tianluo’s eyes were filled with excitement.</p><p>Lu Ming did not know but they were very clear.</p><p>The strongest part of kuiju was its explosive power.</p><p>Kuiju had a unique skill that consumed a lot of energy, but it was extremely powerful. Even the experts on the longevity Roll didn’t dare to take it head-on and could only avoid it.</p><p>However, for this kind of unique skill, the gathering could only be used for a few moves. Therefore, he made a pact with Lu Ming to use three moves. Moreover, he could only fight head-on.</p><p>He did not expect that Lu Ming would agree to it stupidly. Was he not going to lose?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
