This time, the two guards also ended in a draw.</p><p>“Let’s Have a Battle!”</p><p>In the end, the last-ranked commander leaped onto the fighting ring and looked at the guard who was ranked 12th.</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>The twelfth-ranked commander simply jumped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two of them began to fight intensely. The scene was shocking.</p><p>Both of their cultivation bases were equivalent to the heavenly Emperor realm, but they were only equivalent to one-star heavenly emperors.</p><p>This battle also lasted for a few hundred moves. In the end, it was the commander ranked 12th who was slightly better and defeated the other party.</p><p>The last-ranked commander had an ugly expression.</p><p>He couldn’t even defeat the twelfth-ranked commander. This time, he was destined to be ranked last again.</p><p>alright, let’s continue the battle after everyone has recovered. Men, prepare the banquet!</p><p>King Feng Ming announced.</p><p>Immediately, young girls began to serve fine wine and delicacies.</p><p>Everyone began to eat and drink, and even monarch Feng Ming called over a group of beautiful women to dance on the battle stage to liven things up.</p><p>Everyone ate and drank as they waited.</p><p>They were all powerhouses equivalent to the Martial Emperor realm. They had plenty of time and were not in a hurry.</p><p>Only when the people who had been fighting just now had recovered to their peak condition did the challenge begin.</p><p>The twelfth commander began his challenge.</p><p>However, he obviously didn’t dare to challenge those who were ranked too high. He chose to challenge those who were ranked eleventh.</p><p>This battle was also very intense, but in the end, it was still the eleventh- ranked commander who won.</p><p>A hundred years was a very short period of time for these great emperors and heavenly emperors.</p><p>Therefore, everyone’s combat strength wouldn’t improve much in a hundred years. It was difficult to change the ranking, which was almost the same as a hundred years ago.</p><p>Only a few people were full of suspense.</p><p>For example, commander Yu Zhan and commander Rama.</p><p>After the battle, the crowd continued to wait. When they recovered, the challenges would continue.</p><p>Just like that, two days later, it was finally the governor of the border city’s turn to challenge.</p><p>He directly challenged commander Yi Yang.</p><p>Many people were interested.</p><p>This was because this match was also quite suspenseful.</p><p>A hundred years ago, the border city’s commander and Yi Yang’s forces were about the same in strength. In the final King’s ranking, Yi Yang was ranked ahead of the border city. All these years, the border city’s commander had been dissatisfied and wanted to surpass Yi Yang in this commander’s meeting.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>On the side of the border city’s commander, a tall guard leaped onto the fighting ring. His gaze swept across Lu Ming, bin bu, and Liao min before finally stopping on Lu Ming and the other two.</p><p>He knew bambu and Liao min. They were both very strong, so he had no confidence.</p><p>However, he had never seen Lu Ming before. Moreover, he looked very young. Hence, he chose Lu Ming at the first moment.</p><p>“Kid, come down and fight!”</p><p>The burly man pointed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“You actually picked me? It seems like they think I’m easy to bully!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Bleu and Liao min’s lips trembled. Lu Ming was easy to bully? They had already mourned for the burly man.</p><p>Yi Yang also had a smile on his face.</p><p>The more eye-catching the performance of his guards was, the higher the score the monarch would give them, and the higher their ranking would be.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and appeared on the fighting ring.</p><p>“Kid, what’s your name? I don’t kill nameless people!”</p><p>The large man said coldly.</p><p>This kind of battle didn’t have any life or death restrictions. If you had the strength, you could directly kill your opponent.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>However, when Lu Ming announced his name, the black-robed figure who had been sitting behind commander Rama trembled and gave off a cold killing intent.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>Commander Rama turned his head and looked at the black-robed man curiously.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he sensed the other party’s killing intent at the first moment and looked at the black-robed man.</p><p>The other party had revealed killing intent after he had told them his name. It was clear that they were targeting him. Even now, the other party was still filled with killing intent and didn’t hide it at all.</p><p>the moment he heard my name, he revealed killing intent towards me. Could he be from the evil god race? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>This was highly possible.</p><p>The evil god race had a unique appearance, and they were not found in netherworld mountain. As long as they revealed their true form, the people from the heaven realm would be able to recognize them.</p><p>On the other hand, the heaven realm had a certain advantage because there were many humans in netherworld mountain.</p><p>They were mixed in with the crowd, so it would be difficult for the other party to find them.</p><p>In the stands, commander Yi Yang looked in commander Rama’s direction and frowned. His expression was a little gloomy.</p><p>“Brat, where are you looking at? you’re looking for death!”</p><p>die! the burly man roared and charged at Lu Ming. The saber in his hand was as fast as lightning as he slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly. He did not even look and kicked him.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The other party’s saber beam collapsed and he was kicked in the stomach by Lu Ming. He screamed in pain and flew out of the fighting ring, falling to the ground.</p><p>“So strong?”</p><p>Many people were stunned.</p><p>He defeated a peak great emperor in one move. What kind of fighting power was that?</p><p>Could it be that Lu Ming was a celestial Thearch?</p><p>The border city commander’s expression was extremely ugly.</p><p>If Yi Yang had a Celestial Emperor as his subordinate, he would lose for sure.</p><p>After sending the burly man flying, Lu Ming’s gaze turned to the black-robed man. “Since you’re here, why hide your head and showyour tail? reveal your true face!”</p><p>“Hehehe!”</p><p>The other party sneered and then took off his black robe, revealing his true appearance.</p><p>This person was middle-aged and had long purple hair. He was a member of the royal family of the foreign races. As his three eyes opened and closed, a cold light flashed.</p><p>“So you’re Lu Ming. Hehe, I’m quite lucky. You’re the first person I killed!”</p><p>The non-human King laughed coldly.</p><p>Although he did not make it so obvious, Lu Ming was very clear about his meaning.</p><p>What the other party meant was that the first heaven realm being that he would kill in netherworld mountain would be Lu Ming.</p><p>“Oh, really? That’s what I wanted to say!”</p><p>Lu Ming responded coldly. He took a step forward and returned to the stands.</p><p>“You have a grudge against him?”</p><p>Yi Yang asked. His face was extremely gloomy and his long and narrow eyes flashed with a cold light.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>haha, Yi Yang, it seems that your guard has a grudge against my guard. It seems that we are going to have a battle!</p><p>Commander luomo laughed out loud. His voice was filled with coldness.</p><p>Yi Yang’s expression was extremely ugly.</p><p>The other commanders watched with a faint smile, especially the commander of the border city, who was gloating.</p><p>Feng Ming country’s King looked on with a faint smile and did not speak.</p><p>These commanders had conflicts with each other, which was to his liking. This way, he could better manage them.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
