We didn’t expect to see such a good show. Life-or-death pill. Not bad. It’s a waste to leave it in your hands. Leave it to me!</p><p>“You want the life-or-death pill? dream on!”</p><p>run! the first Prince shouted angrily, turned around, and ran.</p><p>However, the next moment, a figure suddenly appeared in front of him. It was</p><p>Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly released a terrifying aura that pressed down on the first</p><p>Prince. The first Prince’s body shook violently and he spat out a large mouthful</p><p>of blood. His face was pale.</p><p>“Your cultivation…”</p><p>The first Prince was in disbelief.</p><p>He was completely vulnerable in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>Back then, when he had fought Lu Ming at the foot of the evil god tribe’s sacred mountain, the two of them had been about the same. His cultivation had been at the peak great emperor realm.</p><p>After all these years of cultivation, his cultivation had already reached the heavenly Emperor realm, and he was now a two-star heavenly Emperor.</p><p>To break through from peak great emperor to two star heavenly Emperor in</p><p>just a few decades was already extremely shocking.</p><p>However, he was worlds apart from Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s aura alone was enough to force him back and make him spit blood.</p><p>“Attack, attack together!”</p><p>The first Prince shouted at the other six members of the evil god race.</p><p>However, the six members of the evil god race could not move at all.</p><p>“Don’t waste your energy!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said. His body was covered in black light, like a demoness.</p><p>She stretched out her hand, and a Black Lotus flower suddenly appeared on the</p><p>bodies of the six evil god race members, enveloping them within it.</p><p>In just a few breaths ‘time, the Black Lotus flower dissipated, and the six evil</p><p>god race beings within it also disappeared without a trace. Only six storage bracelets were left floating in the air.</p><p>The first Prince’s pupils contracted rapidly, and a look of fear appeared on his face.</p><p>To be able to kill six members of the evil god race with just a raise of his hand …</p><p>What kind of combat strength was that?</p><p>One should know that there were two four-star heavenly Emperor experts inside.</p><p>To be able to do this, one must at least be a peak heavenly Emperor, right?</p><p>At the thought of this, the first Prince became even more frightened.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I advise you to let me go obediently. Now, the ancestral Dragon has been defeated, and my race’s holy ancestor has cooperated with the martial God of the yellow spring Empire. Your heaven realm is destined to be defeated. There’s no turning back. If you let me go now, I can still put in a few good words for you and spare your life!”</p><p>The first Prince said.</p><p>“Spare my life? Hehe, I can’t trust you, and you even killed the woman who trusted you. What else can’t you do?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and took a step forward. A terrifying pressure pressed down on the first Prince. The first Prince’s body shook violently and he spat out another mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Tell me, how is senior ancestral Dragon? What happened in the capital of the netherworld Kingdom?”</p><p>Lu Ming pressed.</p><p>ancestral Dragon, hahaha, let me tell you, he’s dead. He was killed by our Saint ancestor. He was skinned and his tendons were pulled out!</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming would not let him off, the first Prince decided to throw</p><p>caution to the wind and burst out laughing.</p><p>“Senior ancestral Dragon is dead? No, that’s impossible!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled. He then shook his head.</p><p>“If you want to lie to me, then I’ll search for it myself!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold as he pointed his finger.</p><p>His finger was like a spear, piercing toward the first Prince’s dantian. The first Prince was shocked and retreated frantically, trying to avoid it.</p><p>But now, Lu Ming’s combat strength was much stronger than his. He could not avoid it at all and his dantian was hit instantly.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The first Prince’s dantian had been pierced through by Lu Ming and his cultivation was crippled.</p><p>“All…”</p><p>The first Prince let out a hysterical scream, but his voice stopped abruptly.</p><p>Lu Ming pointed his finger at his glabella and began to search his soul.</p><p>Lu Ming saw the first Prince’s memories in his soul.</p><p>After a long while, Lu Ming ended the soul search. He waved his hand and kept the first Prince into his small world.</p><p>The first Prince had a special status. He might be useful.</p><p>However, the first Prince’s storage bracelet was in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming pulled Xie nianqing, tore open the space, and left the place.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what’s going on? how’s the ancestral Dragon?”</p><p>Not long after, they returned to the inn. Xie nianqing quickly asked.</p><p>“Senior ancestral Dragon is not dead …”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and briefly explained what he had seen to Xie nianqing.</p><p>It turned out that not long after they entered netherworld mountain, the ancestral Dragon and the non-human divine ancestor had both come to the yellow spring Empire.</p><p>Their target was the cursed land of the yellow Springs Empire.</p><p>For existences on the level of the ancestral Dragon and the non-human divine ancestor, the other Cursed Lands were of little use.</p><p>They wanted to enter the biggest cursed land, and the life fruits inside were the most useful.</p><p>However, it wasn’t easy to enter the cursed land. He had to get the support of the yellow Springs Empire.</p><p>As such, the two of them started to compete in the yellow Springs Empire. They each supported an important figure of the yellow Springs Empire and fought for the power of the yellow Springs Empire.</p><p>Unfortunately, after decades of fighting, the side that zu long supported was defeated and killed. Zu long also escaped from the capital of the netherworld Empire with injuries and his whereabouts were unknown.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming also learned that the divine ancestor of the non-human race had yet to enter the cursed land. The first Prince had no idea why.</p><p>The ancestor Dragon was not dead. Lu Ming was finally relieved.</p><p>The ancestral Dragon was the key to fighting against the non-human divine ancestor. He was the only martial God in the heaven realm.</p><p>In addition, Lu Ming had also discovered a clue. During this period of time, the alien race had discovered a hidden cursed land. However, it seemed that the heaven realm had entered that place. During this period of time, the alien race had been paying close attention to the cursed land and planned to send people to encircle and annihilate the heaven realm creatures in the cursed land.</p><p>“We can’t let them succeed!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing discussed for a while before leaving the inn. Not long after, they appeared outside a huge mansion.</p><p>After searching the first Prince’s soul, he found out that this was the evil god tribe’s headquarters in the netherworld imperial capital. If the evil god tribe wanted to send out experts, they would definitely head out from here.</p><p>At that time, they only needed to follow.</p><p>The two of them hid in the dark void and paid close attention to the mansion.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he took out the first Prince’s storage ring and began to count.</p><p>The first Prince had an astonishing amount of resources.</p><p>There were two weapons that were equivalent to heaven Dao soldiers and a large number of divine stones.</p><p>Lu Ming did not bother about it. He went straight to the Jade bottle.</p><p>In the Jade bottle, there were three life-or-death pills.</p><p>Lu Ming planned to give the life-death pill to the Titan longhorn beetle and the nine lives devilish silkworm first so that they could recover from their injuries.</p><p>With a single thought, the Jade bottle appeared in his small world. Lu Ming’s figure appeared in his small world as well.</p><p>Ever since he had attained the great emperor realm, Lu Ming’s real body could enter his own small world. When he entered the small world, it would automatically hide in the dark void.</p><p>Lu Ming took the Jade bottle and walked to the place where he had planted the path-understanding ancient tree.</p><p>After so many years, the path-understanding ancient tree had grown to two meters tall. It was so huge that it covered the sky.</p><p>The Titan longhorn beetle, the nine lives devilish silkworm, and the others were cultivating and chatting under the path-understanding ancient tree.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
