Purple-gold light emanated from his body and enveloped him.</p><p>For a moment, the purple-gold and blood-red glows on his body churned nonstop.</p><p>ruler, ruler of heaven and earth, ruler of everything. Whatever power you have, get lost!</p><p>Lu Ming roared in his heart. The power of the path of domination protected his soul in the middle, making it invulnerable to all attacks.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>After being blocked, the third bloodline seemed to be enraged. The blood waves surged into the sky and were abnormally violent. They wanted to drown Lu Ming completely and kept attacking him.</p><p>not good. The world Energy is rapidly being consumed…</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. He controlled the way of domination to resist the corrosion of the third bloodline. His World Energy was being consumed very quickly. If this went on, he would not be able to resist for long.</p><p>“Hold on, the Dao of a sovereign can dominate the world. If the entire world can be dominated, then naturally, the energy of the world can be dominated as well!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He then emptied his mind. At this moment, he seemed to have become one with the entire world.</p><p>He seemed to have become the master of the world.</p><p>hu hu…</p><p>With a single thought, the boundless energy between heaven and earth was dominated and controlled by Lu Ming to help him resist the corrosion of the third bloodline.</p><p>Instantly, the consumption of his world power greatly slowed.</p><p>“It’s useful!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>the sovereign Dao was truly amazing. He had a feeling that he had only just comprehended it and was still lacking in maturity. If he continued to grow and his cultivation continued to rise, his sovereign Dao would only become stronger.</p><p>At that time, he might really be able to dominate the entire world. By borrowing the power of the entire world, how terrifying would that power be?</p><p>For example, if you controlled the power of the entire heaven realm to attack the enemy, what kind of power would it reach? It was hard to imagine.</p><p>Lu Ming had completely blocked the third bloodline’s corrosion with his Dominator’s Dao. No matter how crazy the third bloodline was, it was useless. ‘This power… How was that possible? How was that possible? How can anyone in this world control this kind of power?”</p><p>Outside the prison realm, the non-human divine ancestor’s eyes widened and he yelled in disbelief.</p><p>“He recognizes my power?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>As far as he knew, there should have been no one in history who could control this kind of power, right?</p><p>What did the non-human divine ancestor mean?</p><p>‘This power… Hahaha, good, good!”</p><p>At this moment, the ancestral Dragon laughed heartily. However, unlike the non-human divine ancestor, he laughed in a carefree manner.</p><p>“I blocked it!”</p><p>Qing Cang, Wu tai, Liu changlai, and the others were also ecstatic.</p><p>If Lu Ming could block the corrosion of the sacred ancestor bloodheart, then everything would turn around.</p><p>“Damn it, I’m going to destroy all of you!”</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor roared as a terrifying aura emanated from his body. A huge battle-ax appeared in his hand, and he swung it at the prisonsuppressing formation.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>the prison suppression formation trembled and sent out ripples, but in the end, it was able to block the attack. It was much better than before.</p><p>“Break, Break, Break!”</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor unleashed a frenzied barrage of attacks, destroying everything in its path.</p><p>However, even though the prison-suppressing formation was shaking, it was still holding on. It didn’t seem like the non-human divine ancestor would be able to break through it for a few hours.</p><p>“Lu Ming, hang in there. I’ll be able to break the seal in half an hour at most!”</p><p>The ancestral Dragon’s voice rang out. His huge body was wrapped in giant chains. He struggled madly, causing many of the alien races to turn pale.</p><p>“Senior, don’t worry. Half an hour is no problem!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was heard.</p><p>“Good! Roar!”</p><p>The ancestral Dragon roared and exploded with boundless Dragon might.</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor also roared and attacked the prisonsuppressing formation.</p><p>Both sides were fighting for time.</p><p>Whoever had the advantage would win.</p><p>If the divine ancestor broke through the prison-suppressing formation first, everyone would die. All their efforts would be in vain.</p><p>Or, if Lu Ming could not resist it and was devoured by the bloodheart Saint ancestor, they would be finished.</p><p>The other possibility was that the ancestral Dragon would break through the ten-sided seal formation first. Then, he would be able to enter the prisonsuppressing formation and completely destroy sacred ancestor bloodheart.</p><p>Although the sacred ancestor bloodheart was also a Supreme expert, an existence on the same level as the ancestral Dragon, he was only a wisp of bloodline left. He couldn’t be the ancestral Dragon’s opponent at all. He would definitely be obliterated.</p><p>Therefore, whoever took the initiative would be able to change the battle situation.</p><p>Of course, the non-human divine ancestor could also change his way of attacking the ancestral Dragon.</p><p>However, the ancestral Dragon was only stopped by the formation and didn’t lose his fighting power. The non-human divine ancestor couldn’t do anything to the ancestral Dragon even if he attacked.</p><p>Perhaps the power of their battle would cause the ten directional seal formation to collapse even faster.</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor had thought that everything was under his control. However, he had never expected that Lu Ming would be able to resist the corrosion of the bloodheart divine ancestor.</p><p>Now, everything was no longer within his control.</p><p>Time passed by minute by minute.</p><p>Everyone was waiting, waiting for the results.</p><p>The people from the prison suppression field were very worried that Lu Ming would not be able to withstand it.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, half an hour had passed.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Dragon’s Roar shook the sky and shook the earth.</p><p>Countless non-human overlords trembled and spat out mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The chains formed by runes on the ancestral Dragon’s body kept exploding, turning into energy and dissipating.</p><p>In a few breaths, all the runes exploded. Even the Kings of the ten royal families trembled and retreated while spitting blood.</p><p>The ancestral Dragon had escaped.</p><p>“Damnit!”</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor roared and stopped attacking the prisonsuppressing formation. He turned around and attacked the ancestral Dragon.</p><p>However, the ancestral Dragon didn’t want to fight him head-on. His body shrunk rapidly and became more than ten meters long. He rushed towards the prison-suppressing formation like a flash of lightning.</p><p>As long as the ancestral Dragon could break into the prison suppression formation and obliterate sacred ancestor bloodline, they would have won.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor knew the ancestral Dragon’s plan. He shrunk his body and tried to stop the ancestral Dragon.</p><p>However, the two of them were equally strong. The ancestral Dragon didn’t want to fight and was determined to charge at the prison-suppressing formation. The non-human divine ancestor couldn’t stop him.</p><p>“Killing heart, retreat!”</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor roared.</p><p>Even if he tried his best, he wouldn’t be able to stop the ancestral Dragon for long.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The sea of blood surrounding Lu Ming trembled wildly, as if it was extremely unwilling. In the end, all the sea of blood and blood Qi shrank into a drop of blood, turned into a blood-red lightning, and flew out of the prison suppression formation.</p><p>Lu Ming’s connection with the third bloodline was completely cut off.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The drop of blood formed by sacred ancestor bloodheart’s bloodline was extremely fast. In a flash, it rushed out of the prison-suppressing formation. Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The ancestral Dragon and the non-human divine ancestor pounced toward the drop of blood at an incredible speed.</p><p>However, the murderous heart divine ancestor had intentionally avoided the ancestral Dragon and flew toward the non-human divine ancestor, so the non- human divine ancestor was faster. He grabbed the murderous heart bloodline and swung his battle-ax at the ancestral Dragon. The two of them exchanged a blow and retreated.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
