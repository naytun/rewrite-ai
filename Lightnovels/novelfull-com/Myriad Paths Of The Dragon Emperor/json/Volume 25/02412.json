Let me fight you!”</p><p>Just as everyone was speculating, a voice was heard.</p><p>Then, the crowd saw a burly figure step out.</p><p>This figure was more than two meters tall and was covered in purple scales. He</p><p>had come with mo tianluo.</p><p>“Buduo, it’sbu duo!”</p><p>bu duo is about to make his move. Althoughbu duo’s talent is not as high as the eighth Prince’s, and he has been cultivating for a thousand years, he has already broken through to the great emperor realm not long ago. He should be able to suppress that kid!</p><p>Many people were excited to see this figure.</p><p>“Bu duo, don’t show mercy. Attack with all your strength. Kill, kill, kill him. I’ll take responsibility if anything happens!”</p><p>Mo tianluo roared, his face incomparably malevolent.</p><p>He could not wait to cut Lu Ming into eight pieces.</p><p>Bu duo’s body was tall and sturdy, and his three eyes flickered with cold light.</p><p>He took a step forward, and the ground trembled.</p><p>A pitch-black iron rod appeared in his hand. With a slight shake of the iron rod, a pitch-black hole appeared in the space. It was extremely horrifying.</p><p>On the side, many people retreated.</p><p>A great Emperor’s attack was no small matter. Some of the weaker cultivators didn’t want to be involved.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at bu duo with a calm expression. A one star great emperor, he really did not take it to heart.</p><p>“Make your move!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>“Brat, die!”</p><p>Bu duo’s eyes revealed a trace of ferocity. He exploded with all his strength and leaped. Then, he looked down from high above and smashed his staff at Lu Ming with the force of Mount Tai.</p><p>The power of this rod was shocking. If it was a true Emperor, he would definitely not be able to block it and would be smashed into meat paste.</p><p>At the side, Jia Yi’s eyes flickered but he did not make a move. Lu Ming had the bloodline of the bloodline of the sacred ancestor bloodheart. He would not die</p><p>so easily.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The metal rod struck down with a dull thud. In an instant, it was close to Lu</p><p>Ming’s head.</p><p>Just when everyone thought that Lu Ming’s head was going to explode, Lu Ming stretched out his hand and grabbed.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>There was a dull roar. The black metal rod was caught by Lu Ming. Then, the metal rod was fixed in the air, not moving at all.</p><p>Bu duo was the same. He held the iron rod in his hands and was also frozen in</p><p>the air.</p><p>The seemingly powerful stick attack was blocked by Lu Ming with one hand.</p><p>“So this is your strength, it’s just so-so!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly. He exerted force in his palm and shook it suddenly.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The iron rod trembled violently, and a terrifying force followed the iron rod and blasted toward bu duo.</p><p>Bu duo let out a blood-curdling screech, and his body flew out like a cannonball, following in mo tianluo’s footsteps. He crashed heavily onto the ground and spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>The scene fell into dead silence again.</p><p>One move, another move. Buduo, who had already reached the great emperor realm, was defeated. He could not fight back at all in the hands of Lu Ming.</p><p>How could Lu Ming be so powerful?</p><p>Was this the strength of the human race? The human race was actually this strong?</p><p>Many people from the foreign races were shocked.</p><p>In their minds, the human race and the divine beasts of the heaven realm couldn’t even withstand a single blow. Their evil god race was the Supreme existence.</p><p>But now, a human youth had defeated several of their experts in a row. this person looks young, but he might have already cultivated for countless years. That’s why he’s so strong!</p><p>“That’s right, it must be like this!”</p><p>Following that, many other alien races spoke up and thought that Lu Ming was an old monster.</p><p>It was normal for an old monster who had cultivated for countless years to have</p><p>such strength.</p><p>“You really know how to deceive yourself!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered, his face filled with disdain.</p><p>“What did you just say?”</p><p>“Haven’t you been cultivating for many years? then tell me, how many years have you been cultivating until now?”</p><p>Someone asked loudly.</p><p>alright, I’ll tell you then. I, Lu Ming, have cultivated for less than two hundred years!</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was heard by everyone.</p><p>“What? Less than two hundred years, how is that possible?</p><p>“He defeated the great emperor bu duo in less than two hundred years.</p><p>Impossible. How could the human race have such a powerful heaven’s favorite? he must be lying to deliberately attack us!”</p><p>Many of the alien races roared in disbelief.</p><p>in less than 200 years, there were only a few in the entire evil god tribe who could defeat bu duo, who had reached the one star great emperor realm.</p><p>that’s why I said you’re lying to yourself. I believe you have a way to determine the age. If you don’t believe me, then find someone to do it!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The alien fell silent. Seeing how confident Lu Ming was, he did not seem to be lying. He had probably cultivated for less than two hundred years.</p><p>The human race actually had such a heaven’s favorite.</p><p>“Is there anyone else who wants to come out and fight? Today, I’d like to see what kind of tricks your clan has!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice could be heard from afar.</p><p>There was silence at the scene. Everyone looked at each other, but for a moment, no one made a move.</p><p>Lu Ming had cultivated for less than two hundred years. There were only a few people in the entire evil god Realm who could fight with Lu Ming at this age. There was not a single one present.</p><p>As for those who had cultivated for tens of thousands of years, hundreds of thousands of years, or even longer, it would be a little embarrassing for them to come out and fight Lu Ming.</p><p>hehe, aren’t there many experts in the evil god tribe? to think that there s actually no one who can fight me. Alright, I’ll give you all a chance. Anyone who has cultivated for less than 10000 years can come and fight me. I’ll accept all of you!</p><p>Lu Ming said loudly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you said it yourself. Don11 go back on your word!</p><p>Mo tianluo shouted.</p><p>“Of course!”</p><p>Lu Ming responded.</p><p>good. My clan has a Longevity Roll. On it are a hundred top experts who have cultivated for less than ten thousand years. Any one of them can crush you. Just you wait, I’ll go find them now!</p><p>Mo tianluo teased.</p><p>He must teach Lu Ming a lesson today.</p><p>the longevity Roll. A hundred experts who have cultivated for less than ten thousand years. Interesting. Go and find them. Find a few more. I’ll wait here!</p><p>Lu Ming said with a relaxed expression. Not only was he not nervous, but he was also looking forward to it.</p><p>For the Martial Emperor realm, if one had cultivated for less than 10000 years, it could be said to be a golden period. It was the time for one’s cultivation to explode.</p><p>It also represented the future.</p><p>The concept was similar to that of the prodigies of the younger generation. Lu Ming also wanted to see how strong the strongest group of experts in the evil god tribe who had cultivated for less than ten thousand years were.</p><p>Lu Ming crossed his arms and waited quietly.</p><p>More and more foreign races gathered around.</p><p>How many years had it been since a human had challenged them in their capital?</p><p>They also wanted to see what kind of strength this human, who had cultivated for less than 200 years, had.</p><p>A few figures stood in the sky, but no one noticed them.</p><p>These people were the king of the outsiders, general mo Luojia, and a few other powerful beings.</p><p>as expected of the person chosen by the Saint ancestor bloodheart. He’s extraordinary!</p><p>The non-human King said.</p><p>Previously, they did not know that Lu Ming had such powerful abilities.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
