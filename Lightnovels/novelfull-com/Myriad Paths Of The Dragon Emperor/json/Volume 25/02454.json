He wanted to kill Lu Ming, but he would be subdued by Lu Ming every time.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, three months had passed.</p><p>In this way, Xie nianqing’s memories of this life slowly gained the upper hand. Every day, the time that the memories of this life dominated was getting longer and longer.</p><p>Sometimes, she would go out with Lu Ming to accompany Lu shenhuang and play with little Lu Chi.</p><p>This way, a virtuous cycle was formed.</p><p>Staying by Lu Ming’s side, staying by his child’s side, Xie nianqing’s obsession grew stronger and stronger. He was absolutely unwilling to give up and fought against the memories of his previous life.</p><p>The battle intent from his past life was getting weaker and weaker.</p><p>In the memories of his previous life, his background was extraordinary. He was high and mighty, a goddess who did not take Lu Ming seriously at all.</p><p>Even though Lu Ming’s cultivation base had reached the heavenly Emperor realm, he was still a lowly ant in her eyes.</p><p>What was a heavenly Emperor in her eyes? even the Supreme powerhouses who had surpassed heavenly emperors were like ants in her eyes.</p><p>However, she couldn’t take it anymore. She would rather die and let Xie nianqing’s memories merge with her.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s memories of his past life had lost their will to fight, so naturally, his current life’s memories prevailed. Slowly, Xie nianqing’s memories of his past life became weaker and weaker.</p><p>Just like that, three years passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>In these three years, Xie nianqing’s memories of his previous life had almost been wiped out and devoured. Most of the time, Xie nianqing’s memories of this life dominated.</p><p>Even if the memory of his previous life was occasionally dominant, it had changed. He did not kill Lu Ming but was in a daze.</p><p>On this day, Xie nianqing accompanied Lu shenhuang, Lu Chi, and the others.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he was sitting cross-legged on a mountain peak. His body was completely covered in purple-gold light.</p><p>After several years of cultivation, Lu Ming’s mastery of the path of domination had deepened.</p><p>” I can break through now!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. He then took out pieces of chaos gems and began to devour the chaos Qi in them to improve his cultivation.</p><p>Hu hu hu…</p><p>A large number of chaos gems were devoured by Lu Ming, refined, and transformed into world power.</p><p>Lu Ming’s small world started to expand rapidly again.</p><p>However, the amount of resources it consumed was also shocking.</p><p>When Lu Ming broke through to the great emperor realm from the true Emperor realm, he had used up three thousand chaos stones and a large number of raw gemstones.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming had used up even more resources to break through to two star great emperor from one star great emperor.</p><p>As time passed, the number of resources that Lu Ming refined increased.</p><p>Half a month later, Lu Ming had consumed a total of six thousand chaos gems.</p><p>With 30% of the raw gemstones in his body, his cultivation had finally broken through to two star great emperor.</p><p>His small world had doubled in size, reaching a radius of 20 million miles.</p><p>The purple-gold energy in his world power had increased and become more concentrated.</p><p>The reason why Lu Ming had consumed so many resources was because he had converted them into this purple-gold energy.</p><p>This purple-gold energy was not World Energy. It was of a higher level than World Energy. Lu Ming called it the Dominator’s energy.</p><p>if this continues, I won’t have enough resources!</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming smiled bitterly.</p><p>At first, the resources he had obtained from the void Island were enough. Lu Ming thought that they would at least last him for a long time. However, he now realized that they were not enough.</p><p>He was only a two-star great emperor now. Of the twenty thousand chaos gems, he had already used up nine thousand of them, and there were still twenty thousand primordial chaos gems left.</p><p>As for the raw gemstones, he had used up thirty to forty percent of them.</p><p>At this rate, these resources could only allow Lu Ming to cultivate to four star great emperor at most. If he continued, he would run out of resources.</p><p>Without resources, it would take God knows how long to advance to the next realm by slowly absorbing the natural energy of heaven and earth.</p><p>“Let’s take one step at a time!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>The increase in his cultivation level had greatly increased Lu Ming’s combat strength.</p><p>The power of domination had become stronger. Lu Ming could suppress or even kill a two-star great emperor with the power of domination alone.</p><p>With his physical strength and the great desolation spear, defeating a three star great emperor would not be a problem.</p><p>Not far away, Xie nianqing and the others also looked over.</p><p>“Forget it!”</p><p>Xie nianqing murmured. There was a sigh in his eyes, and a trace of unwillingness.</p><p>She still had things to do in another place.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
