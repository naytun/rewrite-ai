It had been more than a hundred years. Now that they met, it was as if they had endless topics to talk about. They chatted and laughed.</p><p>Even Xuan Feng, who had always been a man of few words, was smiling.</p><p>Through the chat, Lu Ming learned about Xuan Xiang and the rest’s experiences over the years.</p><p>Back then, after the patriarch of the Xuan family, Xuan Xiang, Xuan Feng, and Lu Ming had parted ways, they had been traveling everywhere. They had gone to various places, broken through dangerous and forbidden places, and trained everywhere. After more than ten years, the patriarch of the Xuan family had brought them to the heaven realm.</p><p>The ancestor of the Xuan family was an extremely powerful existence in the heaven realm in ancient times, so he naturally knew about the lair of Zulong. After coming to the heaven realm, the ancestor of the Xuan family brought Xuan Xiang and Xuan Feng to the lair of Zulong and settled down there. The ancestor of the Xuan Family Focused on cultivation and recovery, and he would find time to guide Xuan Xiang and Xuan Feng.</p><p>He stayed there for more than a hundred years.</p><p>Although Xuan Feng’s talent wasn’t particularly good, the cultivation environment was too good. The lair of Zulong was the dwelling place of the Zulong. The cultivation environment could be said to be the best in the heaven realm.</p><p>Coupled with the guidance of the Xuan family’s ancestor and the accumulation of large amounts of resources, the two of them managed to reach the true Emperor realm in over a hundred years.</p><p>Lu Ming also briefly shared his experience.</p><p>Although it was only a simple explanation, the two of them were shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming had nowhere to go in the lair of Zulong, so he settled down there.</p><p>Occasionally, Xuan Xiang and Xuan Feng would spar with Lu Ming. Lu Ming only attacked casually, but the two of them were no match for him at all. They admired him even more.</p><p>The two of them had the best cultivation environment and the guidance of an expert. However, Lu Ming had relied on himself to get to where he was today, step by step. His achievements were far above the two of them. Naturally, the two of them were impressed.</p><p>Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, three months had passed.</p><p>One day, Lu Ming received a message from the ancestor Dragon, asking him to wait at the place where the ancestor Dragon was in seclusion.</p><p>Lu Ming bade farewell to Xuan Xiang and Xuan Feng and walked towards the palace at the peak of the mountain.</p><p>When Lu Ming arrived, he realized that there was no one there. He then waited there.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming heard footsteps. He looked and saw a few people walking over.</p><p>There were a total of four people, two old men, one middle-aged man, and one young man.</p><p>“Dragon Qi, they’re all true dragons!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He could sense Dragon Qi from these four people.</p><p>He had the bloodline of Nine Dragons, and his spiritual body was the Dragon God combat body. He was very sensitive to Dragon Qi and could easily sense it.</p><p>“You’re the brat…”</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming, the young man strode over with a hint of hostility in his eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming was baffled. This was the first time he had met this young man and he had not offended him. He must be crazy to have ill intentions toward him the moment they met!</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. However, this was the lair of Zulong and the other party was a true dragon. He was most likely related to the Zulong. Lu Ming could not be bothered to argue with him.</p><p>“The Dragon essence pool only opens once every ten thousand years. This time, only I am qualified to Enter the Dragon essence pool. I really don’t understand why the old ancestor let you Enter the Dragon essence pool. Did the old ancestor…”</p><p>The young man said indignantly.</p><p>“Ao Luan, mind your words!”</p><p>Before the young man could finish, an old man quickly interrupted him.</p><p>The young man’s name was ao Luan. His expression changed slightly. He stopped and did not say anything, but his gaze became even colder. He stared at Lu Ming and said, kid, the Dragon essence pool only opens once every 10000 years. Only the most talented one can enter. I’m the most talented one in the dragon clan in 10000 years. What right do you have to enter? ”</p><p>“Dragon essence pool?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Did the ancestral Dragon ask him to wait for a few months just to let him Enter the Dragon essence pool?</p><p>It was highly possible. Otherwise, this young man from the dragon clan wouldn’t be so against him.</p><p>“Senior ancestral Dragon naturally has his reasons for letting whoever enter!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“You’re saying that your talent is stronger than mine?”</p><p>The young man said coldly, his eyes flashing with a cold light.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled but did not answer. His meaning was self-evident.</p><p>“Hahaha, good, very good. There’s still someone who is so confident in front of me, ao Luan. Then I’ll test just what kind of ability you have. Now, I challenge you. Attack!”</p><p>Ao Luan laughed from anger, and a powerful aura spread out from his body.</p><p>Six star great emperor!</p><p>This ao Luan’s cultivation is truly shockingly high.</p><p>Of course, ao Luan had been cultivating for a long time. Lu Ming speculated that he had been cultivating for at least a few thousand years.</p><p>In reality, ao Luan had already been cultivating for over five thousand years.</p><p>It was extremely rare for someone to reach the six star great emperor realm in five thousand years.</p><p>Even on the Outlander race’s Longevity Roll, he was at the top.</p><p>He was definitely a rare genius. No wonder he was so confident.</p><p>On the side, the two elders of the true dragon Tribe and the middle-aged man looked on expressionlessly without any intention of stopping him.</p><p>“You’re not my match!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head slightly.</p><p>With his current cultivation level, he really couldn’t bring himself to be interested in a six star great emperor.</p><p>He was speaking the truth, but ao Luan completely exploded.</p><p>you’re boasting shamelessly. I’d like to see how much you’re worth!</p><p>Ao Luan was furious. He took a step forward and rushed toward Lu Ming like lightning. He bent his claws and grabbed at Lu Ming.</p><p>As the claw struck out, the void exploded. Its power was shocking.</p><p>“Immemorial demonic Dao!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. Ao Luan did not cultivate the system of laws. Instead, he cultivated the immemorial demonic Dao.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming’s fingers were like a sword, stabbing out at the other party’s claw. It was like a real peerless divine sword, fast as lightning and sharp.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s finger and ao Luan’s claw collided. With a violent boom, ao Luan’s body trembled as if he had been electrocuted and he flew backward.</p><p>“An immemorial body cultivator!”</p><p>Ao Luan’s expression was somewhat gloomy.</p><p>Lu Ming had only used his physical strength earlier. He thought that Lu Ming was a physical cultivator who cultivated his physical body.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar shook the firmament. Ao Luan transformed into a true dragon. His body wriggled, and his dragon claws stepped in the air as he pounced toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The five dragon claws stomped down on Lu Ming one after another. The Dragon claws were covered in a layer of terrifying demonic energy.</p><p>After transforming into the body of a true dragon, ao Luan’s battle prowess rose to its peak.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned slightly cold.</p><p>He had already shown mercy, but the other party didn’t know when to retreat, so don’t blame him for being heavy-handed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The muscles in Lu Ming’s body trembled and he burst forward, swinging his fists continuously.</p><p>Bang!Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s fist collided with ao Luan’s dragon claws. With each collision, ao Luan’s body trembled and he retreated.</p><p>After more than ten moves, ao Luan retreated more than 50 kilometers. He was completely crushed by Lu Ming.</p><p>what a strong body! He’s already reached the peak of great emperor realm!</p><p>On the side, the middle-aged man muttered with a gloomy expression.</p><p>Ao Luan was one of his nephews.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly rose up and attacked. He grabbed one of ao Luan’s dragon claws, swung it up, and smashed it down on the ground.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Ao Luan roared and struggled with all his might, but it was of no use. He was caught by Lu Ming and could not help himself.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
