How could he pay attention to this place and Lu Ming?</p><p>“This kid, what’s his background?”</p><p>Kang duo was extremely confused, but a determined look flashed in his eyes.</p><p>He had to defeat Lu Ming.</p><p>Kang duo nodded silently and looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, make your move!”</p><p>All three of Condor’s eyes glowed with a fiery red light. At the same time, his body was also covered in flames.</p><p>With a flap of its wings …</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Kang duo dashed towards Lu Ming like a fiery red bolt of lightning. In the process, a combat sword appeared in his hand. It was crystal clear like fire Jade and he slashed it at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Peak Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed the moment Kang duo made his move.</p><p>Kang duo was a peak Emperor, and he wasn’t an ordinary peak Emperor. He was a genius, and his battle strength was stronger than ordinary peak emperors.</p><p>Compared to the human race, he was equivalent to a peak great emperor who had mastered the strongest great Dao, or even stronger.</p><p>There was no need to doubt the strength of such a person. He was almost invincible under the heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p>“Open it!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. All the energy in his body erupted.</p><p>On his body, rays of light flashed continuously.</p><p>It was a series of laws, and in total, 81 laws had erupted.</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming’s strength exploded to the maximum.</p><p>If it was before he came to the alien race, when Lu Ming was still in control of more than a dozen laws, he would not have been a match for a peak Emperor with his own strength.</p><p>Just like when he was on the void God Island, he had to rely on his heavenly Emperor corporeal body to fight peak great emperors.</p><p>However, things were different now. Although his physical body hadn’t improved, he had mastered 81 laws. His combat power had increased greatly, and he was confident that he could fight a peak great emperor.</p><p>The 81 types of laws finally transformed into a chaotic-colored battle suit that covered Lu Ming’s body. At the same time, the great desolation spear appeared in Lu Ming’s palm.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s spear swept out and the space exploded. The great desolation spear emitted a terrifying vibration and collided with Kang duo’s combat sword.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>It was as if two stars had crashed into each other, creating a terrifying boom and a scorching light.</p><p>Immediately after, their bodies trembled and they retreated.</p><p>what a terrifying power. The power of the flames has even surpassed the laws and the great DAOs. It can burn everything!</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>The other party’s flame power had a shockingly high temperature.</p><p>Even though he had a battle suit condensed from 81 kinds of laws, it was almost destroyed.</p><p>However, he didn’t know that Kang duo was also shocked.</p><p>In the entire evil god World, there were only a handful of people below the celestial Emperor who could compete with him.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s cultivation was clearly not at the peak great emperor realm yet, but he was able to block his attack.</p><p>The thoughts of the two of them turned quickly, but their figures did not stop at all. After retreating, the two of them stepped on the void and rushed towards each other again.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>The space was smashed by the two of them, and no one stayed within hundreds of thousands of miles.</p><p>This battle was too terrifying. Other than the celestial Thearch, if anyone else was sucked into it, they would only be left with death.</p><p>The two of them fought in the dark void at times, and at other times, they fought in the sky.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two of them had exchanged hundreds of moves, and it was difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>“How terrifying!”</p><p>All the alien races were shocked.</p><p>It was amazing that Lu Ming could actually fight with Kang duo to this extent.</p><p>Mo tianluo, in particular, was extremely shocked.</p><p>Among all of them, he felt it the most because he had fought with Lu Ming in the past.</p><p>However, if Lu Ming were to exert his full strength, he could crush him with one finger.</p><p>In the depths of the sky, the few non-human Kings were also silent and looked on without blinking.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two of them had exchanged more than two hundred moves.</p><p>“Satisfying!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl. His eyes were filled with a bright fighting spirit and his muscles were trembling with excitement.</p><p>It had been more than a hundred years since he had fought to his heart’s content.</p><p>Deep down in his bones, he loved to fight and kill.</p><p>He could only improve faster in battle.</p><p>In the battle against Condor, he was able to use all of his strength to the extreme and display it to his heart’s content.</p><p>“Reincarnation cutting!”</p><p>death’s abyss!</p><p>“Chaos crush!”</p><p>space-time cage!</p><p>“Karmic cycle!”</p><p>“Heavenly wheel of fate!”</p><p>As Lu Ming’s figure flashed, he cast all kinds of terrifying divine abilities. These divine abilities were created by Lu Ming after combining various laws over the years. They were extremely powerful.</p><p>Each divine ability had a different effect, but when used together, it had endless uses.</p><p>The more they fought, the stronger Lu Ming became. He became more and more skilled in the use of various divine powers and slowly gained the upper hand.</p><p>Kang duo started to be suppressed and retreated.</p><p>“Is this all you’ve got? This is truly disappointing!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was heard, causing Kang duo’s expression to turn ugly.</p><p>“Since you’re looking for death, I’ll fulfill your wish, incinerating furnace!”</p><p>Kang duo roared. His third eye suddenly burst out with a blazing light.</p><p>Hu hu hu…</p><p>His third eye turned into a fiery red vortex, spinning rapidly. A terrifyingly hot temperature permeated the air. In addition, there was a terrifying suction force that wanted to suck Lu Ming in.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s muscles trembled rapidly. At the same time, he used the six- feathered divine wings in an attempt to escape from the suction force.</p><p>The suction force was shockingly strong. Lu Ming found it difficult to escape.</p><p>“Come in!”</p><p>Kang duo bellowed. His body was covered in scorching flames as he charged at Lu Ming at an equally fast speed.</p><p>The closer he got to Lu Ming, the stronger the attraction in his third eye.</p><p>Through the eye, Lu Ming could even see a fire furnace with burning flames inside.</p><p>“Get in!”</p><p>Kang duo roared.</p><p>“Let’s see if you have the ability to do so!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He shook the long spear and exploded the void, tearing the suction force apart. Then, he retreated quickly and avoided Kang duo.</p><p>However, Condor’s speed was also astonishingly fast. He chased after Lu Ming at an extreme speed, making it difficult for Lu Ming to escape.</p><p>Condor’s body even started to melt, turning into rays of light and flying into his third eye.</p><p>In the end, Condor’s body completely disappeared and flew into his third eye. Then, a fire furnace appeared in the air.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The fire furnace trembled and expanded rapidly. In the end, it was bigger than hundreds of mountains. It pressed down on Lu Ming and sealed the void.</p><p>An even more terrifying suction force acted on Lu Ming, causing his body to stiffen.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The furnace pressed down and devoured Lu Ming directly into the furnace, causing him to disappear.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
