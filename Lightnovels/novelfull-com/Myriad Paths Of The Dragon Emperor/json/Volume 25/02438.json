We can’t break it with our power!</p><p>A non-human King sighed.</p><p>The other non-human Kings also nodded. If they could break it, they would have done so long ago. Why would they wait until now?</p><p>The hall fell into silence again.</p><p>the matter of the sacred ancestor bloodheart is of great importance. I can’t be careless. I’ve decided to invite the sacred ancestor!</p><p>After a while, the king of the first royal family spoke.</p><p>” Holy ancestor, please!”</p><p>The other non-human Kings were all shocked.</p><p>The non-human race’s divine ancestor had been severely injured in the battle that year and had been sleeping to recuperate. They wouldn’t disturb the divine ancestor unless it was an extremely urgent matter.</p><p>But now, he had no choice but to do so.</p><p>This was because sacred ancestor bloodheart was too important.</p><p>Since ancient times, this world could no longer give birth to Supreme experts.</p><p>There were only so many Supreme powerhouses, and each one of them could decide the direction of the battle.</p><p>Once Saint ancestor bloodheart was resurrected and returned to his peak, it would be easy for him to destroy the prison realm and the heaven realm.</p><p>This matter was worth alarming the non-human divine ancestor.</p><p>“Alright, I agree!”</p><p>A non-human King nodded.</p><p>“I also agree!”</p><p>“I agree!”</p><p>The other non-human Kings all nodded and came to an agreement.</p><p>They immediately set off.</p><p>On the non-human sacred mountain, the air shook and ten kings appeared.</p><p>As soon as the ten King tiers appeared, they were immediately discovered.</p><p>“Heavens, what did I just see?

They had the right to reach the top.</p><p>Many alien races were alarmed. They came out of their seclusion to pay attention to the development of the matter.</p><p>Ten King tiers had arrived at the peak of the holy mountain at the same time. Something major had definitely happened.</p><p>At the peak of the holy mountain, there was a cave. At the entrance of the cave, there was a stone door that was tightly closed.</p><p>This was where the divine ancestor of the non-human race was sleeping.</p><p>The stone door was carved with dense runes.</p><p>The ten kings ‘eyes revealed deep piety and reverence. Then, they knelt down</p><p>and kowtowed at the same time.</p><p>When they knelt down, their bodies glowed at the same time, turning into ten pillars of light that shot onto the stone door.</p><p>in an instant, the stone door gave off a dazzling light that illuminated the entire holy mountain.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Suddenly, the stone door made a sound and slowly opened. Behind the stone door, an aura filled the air.</p><p>This aura was indescribable. It was majestic and heavy, transcending everything, suppressing everything, and unimaginably powerful.</p><p>Under this aura, even the heavenly Dao became extremely docile.</p><p>This was the aura of a Supreme expert!</p><p>“The Holy ancestor has awakened!”</p><p>The hearts of countless non-humans on the holy mountain trembled, and they all knelt down respectfully, regardless of their cultivation.</p><p>The sacred ancestor had finally awoken after so many years, and this made countless non-humans extremely excited.</p><p>“We welcome the divine ancestor!”</p><p>At the peak of the holy mountain, the ten kings of the non-human race bowed respectfully.</p><p>“Why did you wake me up?”</p><p>A majestic and ancient voice spread throughout the entire holy mountain.</p><p>Many alien races were so excited that they were trembling.</p><p>They had never thought that they would be able to hear the voice of the divine ancestor in their lifetime. They were truly too lucky.</p><p>divine ancestor, the bloodline of the divine ancestor bloodheart has awakened</p><p>in a human youth!</p><p>The king of the number one royal family replied respectfully.</p><p>“Killing intent? It seems like his plan succeeded. Where is he now?”</p><p>The majestic voice sounded again.</p><p>divine ancestor, there’s been an accident. That young man has the prisonsuppressing stele in addition to the bloodline of the divine ancestor bloodheart! and now that young man has escaped into the prison-guarding field, which is a territory formed by the prison-guarding stele left by the prison-guarding patriarch!</p><p>The king of the first royal family reported.</p><p>so it’s that old man from the prison guard. What a good plan. I understand now. Three months later, I will go to the prison guard field in person. Before that, gather as many powerful figures as you can and set up the omnidirectional seal formation outside the prison guard field. This is the formation disk, take it!</p><p>A majestic voice sounded, and then a ray of light flew out of the cave.</p><p>The king of the number one royal family reached out and caught it. It turned out to be a formation disk, covered with strange patterns.</p><p>“Many thanks, divine ancestor!”</p><p>The ten kings were overjoyed. They bowed respectfully and left.</p><p>The door of the cave was closed again.</p><p>That terrifying aura had also disappeared without a trace.</p><p>anyone above great emperor level, come out and come with us to the prison suppression field!</p><p>The ten royal families stood in the sky. The voice of the king of the first royal family spread throughout the entire holy mountain.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>“Yes, sir!”</p><p>Countless voices were heard on the holy mountain.

The number was shocking.</p><p>The sky was filled with people above great emperor.</p><p>you guys wait outside the prison suppression field. I’ll be there with the Army!</p><p>The king of the first royal family ordered.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Countless great beings accepted the order and flew toward the prison suppression field.</p><p>The Kings of the top ten royal families returned to their royal cities. Not long after, a large number of great beings also flew out of their royal cities and headed toward the prison suppression field.</p><p>Countless great beings of other races gathered outside the prison realm.</p><p>The prison suppression field was also shocked and held an emergency meeting, the foreign tribes have launched a large-scale invasion. They’ve mobilized countless experts!</p><p>judging from the formation, the ten royal families of the non-human race have moved together. It seems like they’re after the bloodline of the sacred ancestor bloodheart!</p><p>“We can’t give them the bloodline of the sacred ancestor bloodheart!” that’s right. We have the prison-suppressing formation. They can’t break it! The higher-ups of the prison suppression field discussed and decided to fight to the end.</p><p>If the lips die, the teeth will be cold. They naturally understood this principle. Once they handed over the bloodline of the sacred ancestor bloodheart, the first to be destroyed would be the prison suppression field.</p><p>In the prison suppression field, countless Masters also moved, ready to fight at any time.</p><p>However, the non-humans didn’t attack. Instead, they started to set up a formation outside.</p><p>The people from the prison suppression field were confused.
