Because of Jia Yi’s presence, no one dared to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>However, many of the alien races were very curious about Lu Ming’s background. How could a human swagger into a capital city of the alien race with an expert following him?</p><p>“Move…”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and continued to stroll around. However, more and more alien races gathered around him, and there was no lack of heavenly Emperor-level existences.</p><p>“Kid, it’s you!”</p><p>Suddenly, a voice filled with disbelief was heard.</p><p>In front, the crowd made way for a group of people.</p><p>The one in the lead had purple hair that danced in the wind. He was a member</p><p>of a foreign royal family and was very young.</p><p>“It’s him, the Prince of the foreign tribe!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Back in the two world city, when the foreign races attacked the city, they sent their younger generation to challenge the heaven realm in an attempt to demoralize the heaven realm.</p><p>At that time, there was a powerful alien Prince. Unfortunately, Lu Ming captured him and exchanged him for too chaos gems.</p><p>The man in front of him was the Prince, mo tianluo.</p><p>Behind mo tianluo, there were a few other figures. Some were from the Royal alien races, while others were from other races. All of them had powerful auras.</p><p>“Greetings, eighth prince!”</p><p>All around, many of the foreign races bowed in respect.</p><p>There were many different races in the alien race, and all of them had the same bloodline. However, the royal family of the alien race was the race with the closest bloodline to their ancestor.</p><p>Therefore, the royal family had the highest status among the many races.</p><p>As for mo tianluo, as a Prince, he was a King among Kings. His status was much higher than that of ordinary royal families.</p><p>The normal alien races would naturally be respectful.</p><p>Mo tianluo did not care about the others. His eyes were fixed on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kid, why are you here?”</p><p>Mo tianluo1 s face was gloomy as he asked in a cold voice.</p><p>“Why am I here? you should ask your ancestors this question. Do you think I want to stay here?”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips.</p><p>“Kid, mind your words!”</p><p>Mo tianluo scolded and then looked at Jia Yi.</p><p>“Senior, could it be that you’re here to ensure his safety?”</p><p>Mo tianluo asked.</p><p>yes! Jia Yi nodded, ” I’ll only protect his life. I won’t care about any injuries!</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Mo tianluo’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Even though he was curious as to why Jia Yi would protect a human’s life, he only protected his life and didn’t care about anything else, so it was easy to handle.</p><p>He wanted Lu Ming to suffer a fate worse than death!</p><p>Mo tianluo’s eyes flashed with a cold light.</p><p>Back then, he was taken hostage by Lu Ming in exchange for a hundred chaos gems. He had been brooding over this and had been looking for an opportunity to take revenge.</p><p>Who would have thought that the opportunity would be presented right in front of him? how could he let it go?</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Mo tianluo stepped forward. His purple hair was flying in the wind, and his body was covered in a purple light. As the third eye on his forehead opened, a cold light flashed.</p><p>“Kid, come out and fight!”</p><p>Mo tianluo said in a cold voice.</p><p>Many people in the surroundings became excited.</p><p>Mo tianluo was one of the top geniuses of the evil god tribe. Back then, he was ranked ninth among the younger generation of the evil god World.</p><p>In the vast evil god tribe, mo tianluo was ranked ninth, which showed his talent.</p><p>Although mo tianluo could no longer be considered a member of the younger generation at his current age, he was still a young man.</p><p>“The eighth prince is about to make his move!’</p><p>it seems that this human has a grudge with the eighth prince. Haha, how many moves do you think the eighth prince can take him down? ”</p><p>no more than ten moves. It might be an instant kill. You must know that the eighth prince now has the battle strength of a rank 18 true Emperor!</p><p>The surrounding alien races were all discussing.</p><p>“A level 18 true Emperor?”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled up slightly, with a faint disdain.</p><p>I’d better find someone stronger. You’re not my match!</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>His words made the cold light in mo tianluo’s eyes shine even more.</p><p>“Brat, you’re talking big. I’d like to see how much you’ve improved over the years!”</p><p>With that, mo tianluo took a step forward. His body was like a purple stream of light as he rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Mo tianluo struck out with his palm. Purple light filled his palm and turned into a terrifying palm print, blasting toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The alien races cultivated a system that was very similar to the heaven realm’s ancient system. Their actions might seem simple, but their every move was extremely powerful.</p><p>“Peak true Emperor, rank 18 true Emperor!”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s mouth twitched slightly.</p><p>For martial sovereigns, each seclusion could last for thousands or tens of thousands of years. Mo tianluo’s speed of advancing from a stage nine true Emperor to a stage eighteen true Emperor in just over a hundred years was already very fast and shocking.</p><p>Unfortunately, he had encountered Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be measured by common sense.</p><p>Lu Ming did not use his physical strength. His body glowed with the radiance of various laws. In an instant, there were more than ten kinds of radiances on his body that were intertwined.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming simply pointed his finger.</p><p>With the augmentation of more than ten types of laws, Lu Ming’s simple finger attack became extremely powerful.</p><p>Lu Ming’s fingers were like long Spears, piercing mo tianluo’s palm.</p><p>There was no earth-shattering sound, nor was there any scene of wanton force.</p><p>The collision between the two was very quiet.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>It was as if a needle had pierced a balloon. With a poof, blood splattered everywhere. Mo tianluo’s palm print and his palm were directly pierced by Lu Ming’s finger. The destructive force surged toward mo tianluo.</p><p>Mo tianluo let out a blood-curdling screech as his body flew backward and crashed heavily onto the ground. His body twitched and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>The entire place was silent!</p><p>Mo tianluo, the Prince of the alien race, was actually defeated by Lu Ming in one move.</p><p>He was killed in seconds!</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>More than a hundred years ago, mo tianluo was ranked ninth among the younger generation in the entire evil god World. He was extremely talented. Although he was no longer in the younger generation, his combat strength had undoubtedly become stronger. However, he was defeated by Lu Ming in one move.</p><p>This made everyone stunned, as if they found it difficult to accept.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>Mo tianluo couldn’t accept it and roared in his heart.</p><p>All these years, he had been working hard and his cultivation had improved very quickly. He was already at the peak of the true Emperor realm and had the battle power of a rank 18 true Emperor.</p><p>He would be able to break through to the great emperor realm soon.</p><p>He was confident that he could reach the great emperor realm before he was 200 years old.</p><p>Great emperors who were younger than a thousand years old were already very impressive, let alone great emperors who were younger than two hundred years old.</p><p>He was already stunning enough but he was still killed by Lu Ming in one move. Back then, he had fought many rounds with Lu Ming before Lu Ming defeated him.</p><p>Initially, he thought that he was strong enough to defeat Lu Ming and take revenge. He never expected this to be the result.</p><p>Could it be that Lu Ming had already broken through to the great emperor realm?</p><p>Many people couldn’t help but think so!</p><p>Only a great emperor could defeat mo tianluo so easily, right?</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s aura was clearly only at the true Emperor realm.</p><p>This puzzled many people.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
