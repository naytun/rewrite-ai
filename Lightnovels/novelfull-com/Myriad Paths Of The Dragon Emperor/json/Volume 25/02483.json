He’s also trusted by the Dragonman Empire. I reckon he’s exploring that cursed land!</p><p>Six sages said with a grave expression.</p><p>A six-star heavenly Emperor was too powerful. One more step and he would be a peak heavenly Emperor.</p><p>I won’t fight them head-on. I’ll disguise myself and go over to check out the situation. If they’ve already plundered the cursed land, I’ll leave immediately. If they haven’t, we might be able to take advantage of the chaos and reap some benefits!</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“In that case, we’ll go with you. We don’t know where to go anyway!”</p><p>The celestial said.</p><p>The others nodded in agreement.</p><p>They really didn’t know where to go now.</p><p>alright, why don’t we do this? you guys enter my small world first. I’ll go alone and change my appearance. It’ll be easier for me to move around!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright, let’s do that!”</p><p>Heavenly venerate six sages and the rest nodded and entered Lu Ming’s small world.</p><p>After everyone had entered the small world, Lu Ming cast the divine breath technique and his body began to transform into a dark-skinned youth. He left the place and headed towards the Dragon people Empire.</p><p>The Dragonman Empire was separated from Fengming country by a small country.</p><p>Lu Ming traveled at full speed and took three days to arrive at the Dragonman Empire.</p><p>The Dragonman Empire was extremely vast, at least ten times larger than Feng Ming country.</p><p>There were many races in the Dragonman Empire. There were humans, snakepeople, and so on. However, the most numerous race was the Dragonman race.</p><p>The dragonmen had two dragon horns on their foreheads and a long Dragon Tail. Some of them even had dragon scales on their bodies. Other than that, they were no different from ordinary people.</p><p>Lu Ming was walking in a city. He was secretly amazed at the dragonmen.</p><p>These dragonmen were half-human and half-dragon, and they emitted a strong Dragon Qi. They were all burly and above two meters tall.</p><p>“There are so many races in netherworld mountain. Senior ancestral Dragon said that netherworld mountain came from beyond the sky. What kind of place is beyond the sky? Myriad tribes contending for hegemony?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s thoughts were flying and his imagination was running wild.</p><p>He was very curious about that ‘outer space’.</p><p>I have the blood essence of the nine Dragons, and I’ve cultivated the Dragon God combat body. I’ve also refined some Dragon marrow before, so I also have strong Dragon Qi in my body. Why don’t I disguise myself as a Dragon Man? ”</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>If he could disguise himself as a Dragonman, it would be easy for him to do things in the Dragonman Empire.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming’s body changed rapidly again.</p><p>Two dragon horns grew out of his forehead, scales appeared on his body, and a long tail grew out of his buttocks.</p><p>There was also a dense Dragon Qi emanating from his body, just like a Dragonman.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and then swaggered on the street.</p><p>On the street, the creatures of other races looked at Lu Ming in awe.</p><p>In the Dragonman Empire, although there were many races, they were also divided into ranks.</p><p>There was no doubt that dragonians were respected and enjoyed special privileges wherever they went.</p><p>“Let’s go to the capital of the Dragonman Empire!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and flew towards the capital of the Dragonman Empire.</p><p>After a few days, Lu Ming arrived at the capital of the Dragonman Empire.</p><p>Lu Ming started to wander around the capital of the Dragonman Empire.</p><p>eh? an evil god tribe member!</p><p>After walking for a while, Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly lit up. He saw an evil god tribe member.</p><p>This evil god looked very young, and he had definitely cultivated for less than 10000 years. He should be a prodigy on the longevity Roll, and he was only at the Emperor realm.</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile and walked over.</p><p>you outsider, how dare you molest the beauty of my clan? you’re simply courting death!</p><p>Lu Ming glared at the alien and strode toward him.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The alien was stunned.</p><p>“Kneel down and surrender!”</p><p>Lu Ming grinned and gave him a slap.</p><p>The other party was shocked and wanted to resist. However, he was too far away from Lu Ming. He was slapped in the face by Lu Ming and fainted.</p><p>Many dragonians around them looked at Lu Ming curiously.</p><p>this fellow molested my Dragon beauty. Shouldn’t he be taught a lesson? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said casually.</p><p>yes, they should be taught a lesson. These three-eyed aliens have been very arrogant recently. They should be taught a lesson!</p><p>good lesson. You even dared to molest the beauty of my clan. You’re simply despicable!</p><p>“Cripple him!”</p><p>The dragonians shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He then grabbed the alien and strode away.</p><p>After making a few rounds, he came to a remote place. There was no one around. Lu Ming stretched out his finger and touched the person’s glabella.</p><p>Lu Ming cast the soul-searching technique to search the person’s soul and obtain information.</p><p>The man’s body trembled. Very soon, Lu Ming obtained some useful information.</p><p>There was indeed a six-star heavenly Emperor realm expert from the foreign race who had obtained the attention of the Dragonman Empire. They had cooperated with the Dragonman Empire and entered the cursed land to search for treasures. They had split the treasures equally with the Dragonman Empire.</p><p>This time, the foreign races had gathered fifty to sixty experts in the Dragonman Empire. There were quite a number of heavenly Emperor realm experts.</p><p>A few months ago, the foreign races had entered the cursed land, but they encountered difficulties.</p><p>There were dangers and obstacles in the cursed land, so the non-humans were advancing very slowly. During this period of time, they had been thinking of ways to conquer the cursed land.</p><p>In addition, the alien races had gained a lot of treasures in the areas that had been conquered.</p><p>“It hasn’t been conquered yet. Good!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The cursed land had not been completely broken through, and the place that had been broken through had many treasures.</p><p>This meant that no one had explored this cursed land before. There would definitely be a lot of gains inside.</p><p>Lu Ming decided that he must explore this cursed land.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and a burst of energy exploded, killing the alien. Then, he burned the man into ashes.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming headed towards the cursed land.</p><p>The cursed land was located in the mountains to the West of the Dragon people Empire’s capital.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming arrived at that place.</p><p>There were many dragonians guarding this mountain range. However, when they saw that Lu Ming was also a Dragonman, they thought that he was one of their own and did not bother much.</p><p>In any case, the locals of netherworld mountain couldn’t enter the cursed land.</p><p>Lu Ming easily crossed the mountain and arrived at his destination.</p><p>Within the mountains, there was a Castle. The castle covered an extremely large area.</p><p>This was the cursed land.</p><p>In the nearby area, many dragonians were wandering around and waiting.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
