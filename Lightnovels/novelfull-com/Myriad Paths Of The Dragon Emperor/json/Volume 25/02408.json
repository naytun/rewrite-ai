You were the one who caught me, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming said. He sensed carefully and found that this place was indeed different from the heaven realm and the primordial realm.</p><p>The space here was filled with a strange energy that was very different from the original Qi of the heaven realm and the primordial realm.</p><p>But…’</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p>He realized that the laws of heaven and earth here were exactly the same as those in the heaven realm and the primordial realm.</p><p>He had originally thought that the evil god tribe and the heaven realm and the primordial realm were two different worlds, and the laws of heaven and earth would be completely different. He had not expected that they would be exactly the same.</p><p>That’s strange!</p><p>Lu Ming was surprised but this was a good thing for him.</p><p>“That’s right, 1 was the one who caught you!”</p><p>Said moruojia. He stared at Lu Ming and continued,”Now, 1 need your cooperation!”</p><p>“1 cooperate?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a mocking smile.”Tell me!”</p><p>“Cooperate with me and let me take the prison-suppressing stele out of your body!”</p><p>Moruojia said.</p><p>“You know I have the prison-guarding stele?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>From the beginning to the end, he had never used the prison-suppressing stele. How did the other party know?</p><p>Was the other party’s cultivation so strong that he could see through him, or did something happen while he was unconscious?</p><p>wait, how did 1 wake up? I’ve been borrowing the power of the third bloodline like crazy, and my consciousness has been devoured by the endless killing intent of the third bloodline. I’m about to turn into a killing puppet. How did I wake up?”</p><p>it’s impossible for him to have saved me. Could it be the prison-suppressing stele…</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly recalled that when he first obtained a drop of ancestral dragon blood, it had triggered the third bloodline to go berserk. However, it was the prison-suppressing stele that had suppressed the third bloodline.</p><p>Could it be that the prison-suppressing stele had saved him again?</p><p>Did the prison-suppressing stele suppress the power of the third bloodline, so he could wake up?</p><p>It was highly possible!</p><p>That was why he knew he had the prison-guarding stele.</p><p>“What exactly is the third bloodline?”</p><p>wait a minute, sacred ancestor bloodheart. During the previous battle, the other party shouted at sacred ancestor bloodheart. Could he be referring to the third bloodline?”</p><p>“What is the third bloodline? What did it have to do with the alien races? Does he want me to be devoured by the third bloodline by taking away the prison-suppressing stele?”</p><p>At this moment, many thoughts flashed through Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>He was so smart that he had managed to guess the situation correctly based on some scattered clues.</p><p>“It seems that if 1 don’t cooperate, you can’t take away the prison-suppressing stele!”</p><p>The smile at the corners of Lu Ming’s mouth grew wider.</p><p>Moroja did not answer directly. Instead, he said coldly,” “You just need to cooperate!”</p><p>hahaha, I took the initiative to cooperate. I’m afraid that after the prison-guarding stele is stripped away, it will also be the time of my death. I m not that stupid.</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily.</p><p>“You’re not worthy, so you’ll only die!”</p><p>Moruojia said coldly.</p><p>“Oh, really? Then you can kill me now!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>A cold glint flashed in moroja’s eyes. He did not expect Lu Ming to be so difficult to deal with at such a young age.</p><p>If they could kill Lu Ming, they would have done so long ago. However, after killing Lu Ming, the sacred ancestor bloodheart would not be able to wake up. “Tell me, why do you want to take away the prison-suppressing stele? who is the Saint elder bloodheart? What’s the relationship between this and my third bloodline?”</p><p>Lu Ming stared at the other party and asked a few questions in succession. Since he had fallen into the hands of the foreign races, he was willing to risk his life. At most, he would die.</p><p>“You shouldn’t be asking these questions!”</p><p>Moroja’s eyes were cold. He stared at Lu Ming and said,” “It seems that you don’t agree?”</p><p>even if I agree, I’m afraid I’ll still die. Without the prison-suppressing stele, I’ll be devoured by the endless killing intent. Instead of turning into a killing puppet, it’s better for you to kill me directly!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and did not care.</p><p>if you agree, I can guarantee that you won’t die. 1 can even extract your soul and find you a suitable body for you to reincarnate!</p><p>Moruojia said.</p><p>“I appreciate your good intentions!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>To extract his soul and Exchange it for a new body? what a joke. He might as well kill him.</p><p>Moreover, he was sure that the alien race was so eager to take away the prison-suppressing stele and let the third bloodline devour him. There must be a conspiracy.</p><p>“Saint ancestor bloodheart, could it be that my third bloodline was reborn in my body by a terrifying alien expert who wanted to use my body to revive? but my second bloodline is the prison-guarding stele, which can suppress my third bloodline?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s imagination ran wild.</p><p>If that was the case, it was even more impossible for him to agree. Otherwise, the heaven realm and the primordial realm would probably suffer.</p><p>“Don’t think that we can’t do anything if you don’t agree!”</p><p>Mo Luojia waved his sleeves and left with a cold face. The door of the secret chamber was closed, leaving Lu Ming alone.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. He walked to the side of the secret room and observed the walls.</p><p>The walls of the secret room were made of an unknown material, and there were many mysterious runes drawn on them.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head. He understood that since the other party was so assured to lock him up here, it was probably wishful thinking for him to break out of this secret chamber and escape.</p><p>since I’m here, 1’11 take things as they are. Since the nomological laws here are the same as those in the heaven realm and the primordial realm, 1 can still cultivate!</p><p>moreover, the other party didn’t kill me in this situation. If they do, it 11 be disadvantageous to their so-called sacred ancestor bloodheart!</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming felt much more at ease.</p><p>As long as he didn’t die, he would have a chance.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged and adjusted himself to his best condition. 1 hen, he began to comprehend the law of karma.</p><p>Now, out of the ten ultimate maxims, Lu Ming only had not successfully comprehended the law of karma and the law of fate.</p><p>After mo Luojia walked out of the secret room, he came to a large hall.</p><p>In the hall, more than a dozen non-human experts were waiting.</p><p>“Great general, how is it? Did that kid agree to it?”</p><p>An old man asked.</p><p>that kid is young, but he’s extremely shrewd. I’m afraid he’s already guessed a lot. He won’t agree at all. He won’t be swayed by force or persuasion!</p><p>Moroja frowned.</p><p>“You won’t be affected by force or persuasion? That brat is courting death. I’ll go and kill him …”</p><p>A burly foreign being was furious, but he swallowed his words halfway and smiled awkwardly.</p><p>If he killed Lu Ming, how would the sacred ancestor bloodheart awaken?</p><p>“Great general, what should we do now?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>imprison that kid here. We’ll study him and see if we can find a way to extract the prison-suppressing stele from him!</p><p>at the same time, send a message to the other royal families and ask them to think of a way!</p><p>Moruojia said.</p><p>“Alright, we can only do this!”</p><p>I don’t believe that we can’t remove a broken prison-suppressing stele!</p><p>The other alien races nodded and left..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
