Although he had the help of the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, it was still extremely shocking.</p><p>It had only been a few decades!</p><p>A few decades was just a blink of an eye to them.</p><p>He had lived for a long time and had never seen such a stunning person like Lu Ming.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>As he spoke, Qing Gang’s gaze turned to Xie nianqing.</p><p>Beside him, the black Phoenix had also transformed into a human. It was a middle-aged woman with a good figure. At this moment, she also looked at Xie nianqing.</p><p>Xie nianqing was very young, but his combat strength was extremely powerful. He was a peak heavenly Emperor. Most importantly, they didn’t know him, so they were naturally curious.</p><p>“This is my wife!”</p><p>Lu Ming held Xie nianqing’s hand and said.</p><p>“Your wife…”</p><p>Qing Cang, the black Phoenix, and the others were all shocked.</p><p>“May I ask, how many years has sister-in-law been cultivating?”</p><p>Qing Cang asked curiously.</p><p>“Little Qing is about the same age as me!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Qing Cang, the black Phoenix, and the others looked at each other, completely dumbfounded.</p><p>sigh, I’m old, I’m old. I thought I had good talent, but compared to you two, I’m simply a waste!</p><p>Qing Cang sighed as if he had suffered a great blow.</p><p>Lu Ming touched his nose and smiled bitterly.</p><p>“Old lion, aren’t you looking for trouble by comparing yourself to Lu Ming and the rest?”</p><p>The Titan longhorn beetle laughed.</p><p>“Hahaha, that’s true!”</p><p>Qing Cang laughed.</p><p>After chatting for a while, they left the place, afraid that the other party would send more powerful experts.</p><p>After leaving, they chatted as they walked. Qing Cang and the others also learned about the ancestral Dragon.</p><p>“I wonder where senior ancestral Dragon is?”</p><p>that’s right. If this continues, the most cursed land will be entered by the foreign divine ancestor. If he obtains the life fruit, we’ll be finished!</p><p>The Titanos and the others sighed.</p><p>The Titan longhorn beetle and the nine lives devilish silkworm had consumed the life-or-death pill before and knew its effects. The life-or-death pill was made from the fruit of life.</p><p>If the divine ancestor of the non-human race could get the fruit of life, he might really be able to recover.</p><p>If even Saint ancestor bloodheart’s injuries were healed, they would have even less hope.</p><p>Everyone was worried, but also helpless.</p><p>With their strength, they could not compete with the other party at all.</p><p>After that, they planned to enter some cities to Scout for information.</p><p>If the divine ancestor of the outsiders wanted to enter the biggest cursed zone, there should have been news of it.</p><p>Not long after, they arrived at a large city. The others entered Lu Ming’s small world while Lu Ming and Xie nianqing cast a secret technique to enter the large city.</p><p>After that, the two of them stayed in this large city, cultivating and gathering information at the same time.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed.</p><p>One day, they heard a piece of news that made them furious.</p><p>In the imperial capital of the netherworld, the evil god tribe released news that they had captured some heaven realm beings and tied them to the eastern city gate of the imperial capital of the netherworld. Three months later, they would kill them all.</p><p>The news spread like a whirlwind.</p><p>When Lu Ming told the Titan longhorn beetle and the rest of the people about this news, they were furious.</p><p>“Kill, kill our way over and save those people!”</p><p>The Titan longhorn beetle had the most irascible temper, and it roared angrily.</p><p>don’t act rashly. The evil god tribe is trying to lure us over so that they can capture us all in one fell swoop. This is definitely a trap!</p><p>The nine lives devilish silkworm said.</p><p>“Are we just going to watch those people die in vain? What if those people have your family and friends?”</p><p>The Titan longhorn beetle glared.</p><p>“I’m saying, we can’t act rashly, we need to think of a foolproof plan!”</p><p>The nine lives devilish silkworm said.</p><p>“Let’s go and observe the situation first!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>I think so too. Let’s go and observe first before making a decision. Even if we’re going to take action, we’ll have to gather more people!</p><p>The nine Devils devilish silkworm said.</p><p>After that, the others remained in Lu Ming’s small world. Lu Ming and Xie nianqing changed their appearances and headed for the netherworld imperial capital.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at the eastern gate of the capital of the netherworld. They stood on a mountain peak outside the eastern gate and looked ahead.</p><p>There were indeed some people tied up outside the East Gate of the yellow Springs Empire. They all looked Haggard and weak.</p><p>There were a lot of them, almost two hundred of them.</p><p>“Long Chen, Feng Ling, Ouyang Wushuang…”</p><p>Among them, Lu Ming saw Long Chen, Huang Ling, and Ouyang Wushuang.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little anxious.</p><p>These were all his best friends.</p><p>In fact, Lu Ming even saw Yuan Xin in the crowd. This child of destiny could not control her own fate and was tied up.</p><p>Lu Ming had also met some of the older generation.</p><p>“We must save them!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were shining with determination.</p><p>However, he could not act rashly. Lu Ming estimated that there were terrifying powerhouses hiding near the East Gate. Even a martial God like the divine ancestor might be nearby.</p><p>If he rushed out rashly, he would only be courting death.</p><p>“What should I do?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little anxious. There were only three months left. After three months, Long Chen, Feng Ling, and the others would be killed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t be anxious. You have to calm down!”</p><p>Xie nianqing held Lu Ming’s hand and Lu Ming slowly calmed down.</p><p>In the next few days, the two of them observed the area and thought of countermeasures.</p><p>However, the difference in strength was too great, and it was really difficult for them to think of a countermeasure.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>At this moment, a voice was heard in Lu Ming’s ears.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled when he heard this voice.</p><p>That was because it was the voice of the ancestor Dragon.</p><p>Sure enough, a figure walked out of a mountain not far away. If it wasn’t the ancestral Dragon, who could it be?</p><p>Zu long took a step forward and came to Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Senior ancestral Dragon, it’s great that you’re fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>With the appearance of the ancestral Dragon, they had hope.</p><p>“I was injured in the netherworld imperial capital, but it’s not a big deal!”</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>“Senior ancestral Dragon, what should we do next?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>let’s leave first. I’ll leave some people here to guard the place. If other people from the heaven realm come, call them to meet us. We’ll gather our people first and think of a way to save them!</p><p>Zu long said. Then, he left the place with Lu Ming and the rest and appeared in a secret place a million miles away.</p><p>Lu Ming saw many familiar faces in the heaven realm.</p><p>For example, the five elements Qilin.</p><p>They just waited there.</p><p>As expected, in the next few days, there were people coming here to meet up.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
