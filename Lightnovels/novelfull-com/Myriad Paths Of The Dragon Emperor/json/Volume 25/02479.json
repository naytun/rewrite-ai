It’s a person from beyond the heavens!”</p><p>King Feng Ming’s heart moved as he understood.</p><p>There were definitely people from beyond the heavens who had been valued by the Dragonman Empire’s big shots or had cooperated with them to enter some Cursed Lands and obtain the treasures inside.</p><p>Just like the cooperation between him and Lu Ming, emissaries, I’m afraid you’re too late. Someone has already entered the cursed land!</p><p>Explained King Feng Ming.</p><p>” Someone went in? Who was it? What does he look like?”</p><p>A purple-haired member of the evil god race asked. He was a member of the Royal race of the evil god race.</p><p>in fact, the number of foreign Royal clans that came to netherworld mountain this time was relatively large.</p><p>that person’s name is Lu Ming…</p><p>Country ruler Feng Ming described Lu Ming’s name and appearance.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s Lu Ming!”</p><p>“So it’s Lu Ming. Very good. The divine ancestor has given the order to kill Lu</p><p>Ming without mercy!”</p><p>A few of the foreign kinds spoke one after another, and their three eyes glowed with a cold light.</p><p>you, bring us to the cursed land. Otherwise, the country of Feng Ming will be destroyed!</p><p>One of the evil god race members said.</p><p>“Yes, yes, I’ll Take You There now. Don’t worry!”</p><p>King Feng Ming hurriedly nodded.</p><p>He had no choice, the other party was sent by the Dragonman Empire and he did not dare to disobey.</p><p>There were experts at the peak of the void transformation stage guarding the Dragon people Empire. As for those at the fourth level void transformation stage and above, there were even more of them. He was the only fourth level void transformation stage martial artist in the Feng Ming country. If he went against the Dragon people Empire, only death awaited him.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t blame me for turning my back on you. You can only blame your bad luck for offending someone you shouldn’t have!”</p><p>King Feng Ming said awkwardly.</p><p>Following that, he brought the emissaries from the other kingdoms and the experts from the evil god tribe towards the cursed land.</p><p>Soon, they arrived outside the cursed land.</p><p>” Are there any dangers in this cursed land?”</p><p>The Royal member of the evil god tribe asked.</p><p>“I don’t know about this!”</p><p>King Feng Ming shook his head.</p><p>He wasn’t sure about this. There was no record of this in the ancient records. “Generally, Cursed Lands are dangerous. I suggest that we stand guard outside and let Lu Ming take the risk inside to help us clear the way. It’s best if he dies inside. If he doesn’t die and comes out with an opportunity, it’ll be beneficial to us. What do you think?”</p><p>One of the evil god race members said.</p><p>good, that’s great. Lu Ming got some opportunities and came out in high spirits. I wonder what his expression will be when he finds out that he’s an Oriole behind him? ”</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>A few members of the evil god race started laughing.</p><p>“Everyone, apart from Lu Ming, there are some other people. One of them is an expert at the fourth level of the void transformation stage. Why don’t we…” King Feng Ming rolled his eyes and offered a conspiracy.</p><p>“Good, hahaha!”</p><p>The evil god tribe members laughed after hearing this.</p><p>Lu Ming knew nothing about the outside world. He was fully focused on comprehending the way of the ruler. In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed, and Lu Ming felt that he had gained a lot.</p><p>Meditating on the Dao of a ruler for half a month here was comparable to fumbling around outside for a few years.</p><p>let heavenly venerate six sages and the others know. I’ll probably still need some time to comprehend it!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>Although he did not obtain anything here, to Lu Ming, there was nothing more useful than this statue.</p><p>This was his chance.</p><p>When Lu Ming returned to the edge of the formation, he realized that six sages and the rest were still there.</p><p>Lu Ming explained the situation inside.</p><p>“Lu Ming, go and cultivate. I’ll wait for you here. While you’re at it, I’ll take a look at the other places and search!”</p><p>The celestial said.</p><p>They hadn’t completely searched the cursed land before.</p><p>While Lu Ming was in seclusion, they could do a thorough search.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and returned to the statue to continue comprehending The Way of the Master.</p><p>Time flew by, and three months had passed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s understanding of The Way of the Master had improved greatly.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that as long as he had enough resources, he would be able to break through and reach four star great emperor.</p><p>Lu Ming planned to find a place to break through after he went out. unfortunately, the ruler’s will on this statue is limited. I’ve already comprehended most of it!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>he felt that even if he continued to study it, he wouldn’t be able to make much of a difference.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>At that moment, a crack suddenly appeared on the statue.</p><p>The cracks were very thin at first, but they quickly grew longer and larger. In the end, the cracks were like a spider’s web, densely covering the statue.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In the end, the entire statue exploded and turned into ashes.</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>Could it be that if he completely comprehended the ruler’s will on the statue, it would collapse?</p><p>This was the only explanation that made sense. Otherwise, Lu Ming really could not figure it out.</p><p>“Eh? That’s…”</p><p>When the statue exploded, a strong fragrance filled the air.</p><p>Lu Ming discovered that there was a pit under the statue. There was a plant in the pit.</p><p>The plant was bare and had no leaves. It only had a trunk, and on the trunk hung a bright red fruit.</p><p>The fruit was crystal clear and had a treasure light flowing around it. It gave off a strong medicinal fragrance.</p><p>what kind of fruit is this? it’s so rich in life essence!</p><p>Lu Ming tried to identify it but he could not identify what this plant was. He had come into contact with all kinds of spirit herbs, Saint herbs, and Emperor herbs, but there was no such record.</p><p>However, the life essence in this fruit was really too rich. It was so rich that it was shocking.</p><p>“If I refine this fruit, I’m afraid I can make a breakthrough in my physical body!”</p><p>Lu Ming had a thought in his mind. At the thought of this, his eyes lit up.</p><p>If he could make another breakthrough in his body and cultivate the seven Gods mysterious technique to the middle of the sixth level, he would be able to suppress an ordinary four-star heavenly Emperor with his physical strength alone. He would even be able to fight against the fourth level void transformation stage in netherworld mountain.</p><p>With the Dao of a ruler, his battle-power would increase dramatically.</p><p>“Refine!”</p><p>Lu Ming made a prompt decision and walked over. He observed carefully and found no danger.</p><p>Lu Ming uprooted the plant and plucked the fruit. He planted the root in his own small world.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged, holding the fruit and observing it for a while. The fruit was the size of a fist, and it was overflowing with life essence.</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth and swallowed the fruit in one bite.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The moment the fruit entered Lu Ming’s body, it was like a volcanic eruption. Waves of scorching energy erupted and rushed into Lu Ming’s limbs and bones.</p><p>“What a shocking amount of energy. Good, good…’</p><p>Lu Ming was not shocked. Instead, he was happy.</p><p>Now, his physical body was equivalent to the heavenly Emperor realm. It was too difficult to break through.</p><p>One had to know that once his physical body broke through, he would have to cross several levels. The amount of energy required was simply too much, so much that it was shocking.</p><p>The more energy the fruit contained, the more confident he would be in breaking through.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
