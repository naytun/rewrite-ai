Their terrifying aura made Qing Cang and the others change their expressions and stop.</p><p>another four peak heavenly emperors. A total of seven peak heavenly emperors. You really think highly of us!</p><p>Qing Cang sneered as his nine heads looked around.</p><p>Beside Qing Cang, there was a Phoenix flapping its wings, and its body was covered in black flames.</p><p>It was a Black Phoenix, a peak heavenly Emperor, the king of the Phoenix race in the heaven realm.</p><p>“Haha, Qing Cang, I’ll see how you die today!”</p><p>hahahaha… a loud laugh came from behind. The experts of the evil god tribe had blocked Qing Cang and the others ‘escape route, making it impossible for them to escape.</p><p>duo Lei, why aren’t you guarding the eternal cage? be careful not to let anyone escape!</p><p>Qing Cang sneered, his voice filled with mockery.</p><p>The one from the evil god tribe who had just spoken was duo Lei.</p><p>Upon hearing Qing Gang’s words, duo Lei’s eyes turned extremely ferocious as he roared, ” “So what if you’ve escaped from the eternal cage, qingcang? He’ll still die in my hands. And that Lu Ming kid, I’ll tear him into pieces sooner or later!”</p><p>“Charge back to the cursed Lands!”</p><p>Qing Cang secretly sent a message to the beings in the heavenly realm.</p><p>They would only have a chance if they rushed back to the cursed land. Outside, they would have to face the double siege of the evil god tribe and the yellow Springs Empire. They would be in grave danger.</p><p>“It’s too late!”</p><p>In the small world, Lu Ming was a little anxious. He then sent a voice transmission to the Titan Longhorn and the nine-lives devilish silkworm.</p><p>“Senior, quickly wake up!”</p><p>“Senior, quickly wake up!”</p><p>Lu Ming kept transmitting his voice.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The auras of the Titan bull and the nine-lives devilish silkworm suddenly skyrocketed. Then, they rapidly contracted before opening their eyes.</p><p>” Is the war about to start!”</p><p>The Titan longhorn beetle asked.</p><p>“That’s right. It’s an urgent matter, so I can only disturb the two of you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>it’s fine. I’ve almost recovered. Let’s go out and fight!</p><p>The Titan longhorn beetle said.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the small world. The next moment, everyone in the small world appeared outside.</p><p>At this moment, Qing Cang and the others also made their move.</p><p>They immediately charged toward the evil god tribe behind them, wanting to rush back to the cursed land.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The experts from the evil god tribe and the yellow spring Empire also made their moves.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming roared and his voice reverberated in all directions. Then, he rushed towards the people of the yellow Springs Empire.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>The people of the evil god tribe and the yellow spring Empire were stunned.</p><p>In just a short moment, they had already arrived.</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron and charged at a peak heavenly Emperor of the yellow Springs Empire.</p><p>At the same time, Xie nianqing joined forces with Lu Ming to attack one person.</p><p>The Titan longhorn beetle and the others also launched their attacks.</p><p>On Lu Ming’s side, there were five peak heavenly emperors. Their sudden appearance caught the yellow Springs Empire off guard.</p><p>The peak-stage heavenly Emperor who was attacked by Lu Ming and Xie nianqing was sent flying. He spat out a mouthful of blood and was severely injured.</p><p>The other experts of the yellow Springs Empire were also pushed back and suffered different degrees of light injuries.</p><p>“Titan, nine-lives, it’s you! Hahaha, kill!”</p><p>Qing Cang was overjoyed to see the Titan Longhorn and the others. He turned around and was about to kill the experts of the yellow Springs Empire.</p><p>However, after being stunned for a moment, duo le and the others also reacted and charged toward Qing Cang and the others.</p><p>The scene was in a chaotic battle.</p><p>The total number of peak heavenly Emperor powerhouses from both sides was the same, seven.</p><p>However, just now, Lu Ming and the others had sneaked an attack and injured one of the opponents. They had the upper hand in terms of the number of peak heavenly emperors.</p><p>An intense chaotic battle broke out. Lu Ming’s side had the slight upper hand. If it were not for the fact that the yellow Springs Empire and the evil god tribe had more six-star heavenly emperors, the battle would have been one-sided.</p><p>“Lu Ming, damn it, damn it!”</p><p>Duo Lei roared in his heart.</p><p>It was Lu Ming again. Every time, Lu Ming would ruin his plans. Lu Ming was simply his nemesis.</p><p>He was so furious that he could not wait to crush Lu Ming’s bones and scatter his ashes.</p><p>“If you want to kill me, then come!”</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the nine Divine Nine-Dragon cauldrons and hurled them at duo Lei.</p><p>Duo Lei also unleashed his powers in a frenzy, wanting to kill Lu Ming. The two of them collided continuously, but it was difficult to determine the victor.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>At this moment, a six-star heavenly Emperor of the evil god tribe was killed by Xie nianqing.</p><p>Lu Ming, the Titan longhorn beetle, and the rest each had an opponent and they fought fiercely with each other.</p><p>Xie nianqing, on the other hand, did not have any peak heavenly Emperor to stop him.</p><p>The peak-stage heavenly Emperor of the yellow Springs Empire was severely injured at the beginning. He was at most as strong as a six-star heavenly Emperor, and there were five or six six six six-star heavenly emperors surrounding Xie nianqing.</p><p>However, Xie nianqing’s combat strength was beyond their imagination. He became more and more courageous, and his attacks were unpredictable. After a dozen moves, he successfully killed a six-star heavenly Emperor.</p><p>“Exterminate!”</p><p>As Xie nianqing spoke, his body emitted a black light. The black light turned into black lotuses. The petals of the lotuses flew out and formed a black sword that slashed at his opponent.</p><p>On the other side, the five six-star heavenly emperors were flustered by Xie nianqing’s attack and were in danger.</p><p>“Come and help us!”</p><p>A six-star heavenly Emperor roared.</p><p>However, the chaotic battle was intense, and everyone had an opponent. How could they draw out so many experts?</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Suddenly, another six-star heavenly Emperor was pierced through the forehead by Xie nianqing’s sword light and died on the spot.</p><p>“Ah, damn it!”</p><p>Duo Lei howled, wanting to push Lu Ming back and attack Xie nianqing.</p><p>However, Lu Ming controlled the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron and fought back with all his might. He blocked Xie nianqing’s attack with all his might, leaving him no energy to attack Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Gather, gather together!”</p><p>A peak great emperor from the yellow Springs Empire roared.</p><p>At this moment, they were at a disadvantage and had to gather their strength to defend.</p><p>All the people from the evil god tribe and the yellow spring Empire started to gather. They got close to each other and got into a defensive position.</p><p>Initially, Lu Ming and the rest had the upper hand by a slight margin. Now that the other party was on the defensive, they could not take down the other party.</p><p>Very quickly, the people from the evil god tribe and the yellow Springs Empire gathered together and formed a defensive formation that was as strong as iron. They blocked the attacks from Lu Ming and the others and finally stabilized the situation.</p><p>The two sides fought for a while, then separated into two camps and confronted each other.</p><p>They all knew that if there were no accidents today, no one could do anything to the other.</p><p>However, Lu Ming and the rest had achieved their goal of saving people.</p><p>The faces of duo Lei and the others were ugly.</p><p>Today, they had failed to kill anyone, and instead, a few six-star heavenly emperors had died. It was a big loss.</p><p>“When my race’s divine ancestor recovers, you’ll all die. Go!”</p><p>A peak heavenly Emperor from the evil god tribe spoke coldly. Then, the evil god tribe and the yellow spring Empire retreated unwillingly.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest did not pursue. The other party was on the defensive. It was useless even if they pursued.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
