He could only extract the prison-suppressing stele if Lu Ming was willing to cooperate.</p><p>How could he make Lu Ming volunteer?</p><p>That was to make Lu Ming feel despair and let him see the terrifying strength of the alien races. He wanted to let Lu Ming understand that the heaven realm was no match for the alien races and that the heaven realm was destined to be destroyed by them.</p><p>Lu Ming could not change the outcome even if he did not agree.</p><p>Then, he would give Lu Ming hope, a way out for him, resources, and his family. Only then would Lu Ming yield and agree to the alien race’s conditions.</p><p>“Let him move freely in our Jie, but send an expert to follow him, in case he gets killed by others!”</p><p>The non-human King instructed.</p><p>This was the evil god World, and if a human were to walk on the streets, he would really be killed.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Moroga and the others bowed and accepted the order.</p><p>“Alright, let’s do that!”</p><p>The non-human King instructed before leaving.</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming was cultivating when the door of the secret chamber opened again. Mo Luojia and an old man walked in.</p><p>here it comes again. In my opinion, you don’t have to waste your time. You can’t take away the prison-suppressing stele!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>I’m not here today to take away the prison-suppressing stele. I’m here to let you out!</p><p>Moruojia said.</p><p>“Let me out?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. He was quite surprised.</p><p>He didn’t expect that the other party would let him out.</p><p>“That’s right, you can go to my realm, but you can only stay in my realm. If you want to go back to the heaven realm, stop daydreaming. Let’s go!”</p><p>After saying that, moruojia turned around and left.</p><p>“What are these alien races up to?”</p><p>Lu Ming was very puzzled.</p><p>However, it was better to leave this place than stay in this secret chamber for the rest of his life. There was nothing to think about. Lu Ming followed moroja and left.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered as he walked out of the secret room and came to a platform.</p><p>Because the scenery that entered his eyes was truly magnificent.</p><p>This secret room should be located at an extremely high position. From where they stood, they were high up in the clouds and had a wide field of view, allowing them to see into the distance.</p><p>What came into view was a large number of buildings. These buildings were very strange, completely different from the buildings in the heaven realm. They looked more barbaric, more majestic, and very magnificent.</p><p>Such buildings were endless and could not be forgotten.</p><p>There was a huge city here, even bigger than the ancient city in the heaven realm.</p><p>In the city, there were people constantly flashing.</p><p>All of them were alien races. There were black-scaled alien races with burly bodies, purple-scaled alien races, four-armed alien races with short bodies, and also alien races that looked like shadows…</p><p>There were too many!</p><p>These alien races did not conceal their auras. One after another, terrifying auras soared into the sky. Lu Ming could clearly sense them.</p><p>“So many experts…”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. With just a casual sense, Lu Ming realized that there were a shocking number of experts among these alien races.</p><p>A large group of them were all at the Martial Emperor realm. There were also a large number of true emperors.</p><p>There were even many great emperors.</p><p>There were too many powerhouses.</p><p>“This is the royal city of my tribe!”</p><p>Moroja explained.</p><p>the capital? no wonder!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>The capital was usually a place where experts gathered. It was normal for there to be many experts.</p><p>” However, this is only one of the Royal cities of my race!”</p><p>Moroja then added.</p><p>“One of the royal families? what do you mean?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked instinctively.</p><p>there are a total of ten Royal clans in the evil god tribe. Naturally, we have ten royal cities. This is one of the Royal cities of our tribe. I might as well tell you that only three of the ten Royal clans have been attacking the heaven realm all these years. That’s not all!</p><p>Moruojia said.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>This time, Lu Ming was really shocked.</p><p>There were actually ten Royal clans in the alien race, and only three of them had attacked the heaven realm in the past few years.</p><p>This meant that there were seven other royal families that hadn’t attacked the alien races.</p><p>The three royal families attacking the heaven realm had already forced the heaven realm into a disadvantageous position. If the ten royal families all attacked the heaven realm, wouldn’t the heaven realm be unable to resist?</p><p>This was beyond Lu Ming’s expectations. At this moment, he was really anxious.</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming’s expression, moroga smiled.</p><p>This was what he wanted to see. Shock, despair!</p><p>now, you know the strength of my clan. If the heaven realm wants to fight with my clan, it’s like an egg hitting a stone!</p><p>Moruojia laughed coldly.</p><p>“How could this be? No, the heaven realm must still have some hidden power. Otherwise, it would have been destroyed by the alien races!”</p><p>yes, it’s definitely not that simple. There must be some hidden story.</p><p>Otherwise, the alien races wouldn’t have dragged on for so many years without destroying the heaven realm!</p><p>Many thoughts flashed through Lu Ming’s mind as he tried to calm himself down.</p><p>Hu…</p><p>A moment later, Lu Ming heaved a long sigh of relief and his eyes calmed down.</p><p>“This kid…”</p><p>Moruojia was shocked. Lu Ming’s mental fortitude was beyond his expectations. He calmed down so quickly after hearing that the alien race was so powerful.</p><p>“Hmph, let’s see how you’re going to remain calm when you seethe true strength of my clan!”</p><p>Moruojia snorted in his heart and ordered, ” “Jiayi, from now on, he will follow him. Do you understand?”</p><p>“Yes, great general!”</p><p>The old man beside moroja bowed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Moroga took a step forward and disappeared.</p><p>since we’re already here, let’s take a good look around. If we can learn more about the secrets of the alien races, it will be helpful when we return to the heaven realm in the future!</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming leaped off the platform and flew down.</p><p>Jiayi was not far behind Lu Ming.</p><p>After jumping off the platform, Lu Ming walked toward a Street.</p><p>The alien race’s buildings were ancient and tall. Each building was hundreds of meters tall and the streets were wide.</p><p>Lu Ming swaggered around the streets.</p><p>On the other hand, the alien races on the street were stunned. Their eyes widened to the size of copper bells as they stared at Lu Ming.</p><p>“This… This person isn’t from my clan?”</p><p>“He looks like a human. Yes, a human!”</p><p>a human actually dares to stroll around our King City. This… What’s going on?”</p><p>The non-humans on the streets were all discussing.</p><p>Furthermore, this piece of news spread like a whirlwind.</p><p>In a short while, this area was surrounded by all kinds of alien races.</p><p>“Hey, move aside, move aside. You’re blocking the way. Do you have any manners?”</p><p>Lu Ming was very arrogant. He berated her directly.</p><p>nest, this human is so arrogant!</p><p>a human dares to berate us in our King City. He’s courting death!</p><p>A short-tempered non-humankind being shouted, showing his cold killing intent.</p><p>However, at the sight of Jiayi who was following Lu Ming, they shivered in fear.</p><p>Jia Yi’s aura was too terrifying.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
