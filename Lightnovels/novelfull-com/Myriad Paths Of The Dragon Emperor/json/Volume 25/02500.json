During this time, most of the creatures in the heaven realm would go to the periphery of the netherworld Empire to inquire about the news. This way, they could come back.</p><p>On the third day, Lu Ming saw dandan. After not seeing her for some time, dandan’s cultivation level had increased by a lot and she had reached the four- star heavenly Emperor level.</p><p>Lu Ming chatted with dandan for a while and found out that this fellow had encountered some fortuitous encounters.</p><p>On the fifth day, bubbles arrived. Currently, her cultivation base had reached the peak great emperor realm and she was only a step away from becoming a heavenly Emperor.</p><p>On the sixth day, Lu Xiangxiang and Ouyang Moli came together, which made Lu Ming overjoyed.</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang and Ouyang Moli’s cultivation had both stepped into the great emperor realm.</p><p>Lu Ming finally heaved a sigh of relief. Lu Xiangxiang and the rest were fine. Lu Ming was relieved.</p><p>As time passed, more and more people gathered here.</p><p>However, Lu Ming still could not think of a very effective method.</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming went to find the ancestor Dragon.</p><p>senior, I have a heaven’s favorite of the Outlander race in my hands. He’s the son of the king of the number one Royal race of the Outlander race, and he’s known as the strongest heaven’s favorite in the history of the evil god race. Perhaps we can use him to exchange for him!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The first Prince was still in Lu Ming’s hands. He had been kept in the small world.</p><p>He did not kill the first Prince back then because he thought that it might be useful in the future. The first Prince’s identity was not to be underestimated. Perhaps he could exchange for Feng Ling, Long Chen, and the others.</p><p>“I’m afraid it’ll be difficult!”</p><p>Zu long frowned, although the first Prince is important, you’re still the most important person in the eyes of the non-human divine ancestor. Once you appear, the non-human divine ancestor will probably kill you immediately. He won’t care about some non-human genius!</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. The non-human divine ancestor seemed to know that he had cultivated the path of domination. Perhaps he really did not care about the first Prince’s life and wanted to kill him.</p><p>“Senior, do you have a good plan?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>whether it’s to save people or to fight the non-human divine ancestor, there’s only one way now, and that’s to go to the yellow spring sect!</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>“Yellow spring sect?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>that’s right. The netherworld sect is an extremely secretive sect in the netherworld world. It doesn’t care about worldly affairs and only focuses on cultivation. Even the people in the netherworld world world don’t know about it. I’ve stayed in the imperial capital of the netherworld for a while and learned about it from some ancient books!</p><p>it’s said that the netherworld sect and the netherworld Empire were of the same lineage in the early days. However, some people were keen on secular power and established the netherworld Empire, while some people who were not keen on secular power and established the netherworld sect in seclusion!</p><p>Zu long explained.</p><p>“Is the netherworld sect very strong?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>strong, of course, they are strong. Although they don’t have as many people as the yellow Springs Empire, their top combat force is not weaker than the yellow Springs Empire!</p><p>as far as I know, there are two martial gods in the netherworld Empire and two in the netherworld sect!</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>“Two war gods!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>Not to mention anything else, the two martial gods were already enough to shock the world.</p><p>as long as we can obtain the support of the netherworld sect, not only can we save people, but we can also fight against the divine ancestor of the non- human race!</p><p>Zulong said. He sighed and said, ” if we can’t get the support of the netherworld sect, we can only do it ourselves!</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Time passed day by day, and a month had already passed since the three months that the evil god tribe had given him.</p><p>At this time, more than 500 people had gathered in the heaven realm.</p><p>At this time, zu long was also ready to leave for the yellow spring sect.</p><p>However, he didn’t bring that many people with him. He only brought Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, the Titan longhorn beetle, the nine-lives devilish silkworm, and ten other people to the netherworld sect.</p><p>The netherworld sect was located in the northernmost part of the netherworld world. It was almost at the edge of the netherworld.</p><p>The ancestral Dragon brought them to a mountain range.</p><p>There were countless mountains here.</p><p>Soon, they arrived in front of a tall mountain.</p><p>At the foot of the mountain, there was a huge stone tablet. The stone tablet was ancient and covered in moss. In the middle of it, there was a huge ‘Huang’ character.</p><p>The mountain Gate was empty.</p><p>Was this the netherworld sect? Everyone was puzzled.</p><p>But since they were already here, they could only continue forward.</p><p>They didn’t fly, but walked up the mountain’s stairs.</p><p>When he passed by the stone tablet, Lu Ming sized it up curiously and felt that it looked familiar.</p><p>Very soon, they were halfway up the mountain. Suddenly, the space moved and four figures appeared in front of them, blocking Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Halt, this is the yellow spring sect!”</p><p>A middle-aged man said.</p><p>“Everyone, we would like to see your sect’s leader!”</p><p>Zu long cupped his fists and said.</p><p>“Everyone, my sect’s sect master is not seeing guests. Please leave!”</p><p>The middle-aged man waved his hand with a cold expression.</p><p>“You haven’t even seen him before, how do you know he’s gone missing? We have something important to discuss with your sect leader!”</p><p>The Titan longhorn beetle shouted.</p><p>“Everyone, please return!”</p><p>The middle-aged man continued to speak, but his voice was cold. It was obvious that he wanted to drive the guest away.</p><p>you didn’t even hear why we’re here. What’s the meaning of this? ”</p><p>The Titan longhorn beetle grumbled unhappily, and a powerful aura erupted from its body.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Just as the Titan longhorn beetle’s aura erupted, the four people in front of it also released powerful auras.</p><p>Three six-star heavenly emperors and one peak heavenly Emperor!</p><p>The expressions of Lu Ming and the group changed slightly.</p><p>The cultivation of the four people in front of him was already extremely shocking.</p><p>Not only that, but there were also many shocking auras coming from the mountain peak. They were like terrifying air waves that pressed down on this side.</p><p>Lu Ming could sense that there were no less than ten peak heavenly Emperor auras.</p><p>There were even a few auras that were extremely shocking, even above peak heavenly Emperor.</p><p>“WOWO, there are so many experts here, and there are even invincible figures who are half a step into the martial God Realm!”</p><p>The Titan longhorn beetle grinned, its eyes filled with shock.</p><p>This Yellow Springs sect was indeed terrifying. The Titan longhorn beetle had only released its aura, but it was like poking a hornet’s nest, causing a bunch of experts to appear.</p><p>Perhaps, this was only a portion of them. Who knew how many more experts there were in the dark?</p><p>everyone, please calm down. We have no ill intentions. We are only here to seek cooperation!</p><p>The ancestral Dragon stepped forward and said. Then, he looked at the peak of the mountain and said,”Fellow Daoists, I have a matter to discuss with you!”</p><p>The ancestral Dragon’s voice came from far away, and at the same time, he gave off a strange aura.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, why have you come to the netherworld sect?”</p><p>At this time, an old voice came from the peak of the mountain. Then, a light flashed and a figure appeared in front of everyone.</p><p>It was an old man with white hair and a Sage-like air.</p><p>“We pay our respects to the sect leader!”</p><p>elder! the people from the yellow spring sect saluted the old man respectfully.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest felt a chill in their hearts. They knew that the old man was a Battlegod.</p><p>The two sect Masters of the yellow spring sect were both at the martial God Realm.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, we’re here to seek your cooperation!”</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>“Cooperation?”</p><p>Tho u;hita_h airarl oldorwac r»ti’7’71or1</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
