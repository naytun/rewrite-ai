It would be a waste to go there against an existence like the foreign race’s divine ancestor. It was better to focus on improving his strength first.</p><p>Lu Ming closed his eyes and meditated on the will of domination on the statue before him.</p><p>The Dominator’s intent from the statue was very faint. Lu Ming spent less than a month to fully comprehend it.</p><p>After searching for a while and finding nothing else, Lu Ming met up with sixth Saint and headed outside.</p><p>After leaving the ruins, they chose a direction and flew off.</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>After flying for a while, Lu Ming suddenly spoke and then stopped.</p><p>The others also stopped.</p><p>“No, this area is too quiet!”</p><p>The experienced heavenly venerate six sages immediately sensed that something was amiss.</p><p>This area was completely silent, as if there were no living beings, not even insects. Something was definitely wrong.</p><p>At this moment, a large number of figures flashed in all directions and surrounded Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Some of them were at the great emperor realm and some were at the heavenly Emperor realm. All of them were glaring at Lu Ming and the rest with cold killing intent.</p><p>“Everyone, Who are you? Why are you surrounding us?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“The person who will kill you!”</p><p>A cold voice rang out, and two figures walked out of the crowd.</p><p>“Evil god tribe!”</p><p>Lu Ming, six sages, and the others were stunned when they saw the two of them.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>When the two members of the evil god tribe looked at Lu Ming, their eyes were filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>“Kill them!”</p><p>One of the evil god tribe members gave the order.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>Immediately, the experts moved and charged towards Lu Ming and the rest. Hundreds of attacks were about to drown them.</p><p>“The strongest is the five-star heavenly Emperor!”</p><p>As soon as these people attacked, Lu Ming could determine their strength.</p><p>The strongest were the five star heavenly emperors. There were only two of them. The others were all below the five star heavenly Emperor.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately summoned the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron. The nine Divine Nine-Dragon cauldrons floated around him and blocked all the attacks. Then, with a shake, they blasted in all directions.</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron was so powerful that these people couldn’t block it. The terrifying power blasted out, and screams rang out. These people’s bodies exploded one by one.</p><p>Even the two five-star heavenly emperors were the same. Their bodies exploded and they died on the spot. The two one-star heavenly emperors from the evil god race had even weaker cultivation bases, but they were also killed instantly.</p><p>Lu Ming dashed past them and kept all the storage rings.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. Everyone left the place at top speed and flew North.</p><p>However, their expressions were grave along the way.</p><p>Apart from the two members of the evil god race, the rest of the people from earlier were obviously natives.</p><p>Could it be that some major power had been controlled by the evil god race, so they had sent people to guard the cursed Lands and hunt down the heaven realm’s experts?</p><p>That was their guess.</p><p>They flew all the way, and two days later, they arrived near another cursed land.</p><p>However, they saw a massacre near the cursed land.</p><p>A group of people was besieging more than a dozen heaven realm experts.</p><p>Moreover, those heaven realm Masters were obviously at a disadvantage. There were already seven or eight corpses on the ground, some of which were from the human clan, and some from the divine beast clan.</p><p>The ones who surrounded the heaven realm experts were obviously natives. However, they saw a few evil god tribesmen among them.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest did not hesitate and charged out.</p><p>Lu Ming’s control of the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron was equivalent to that of a peak heavenly Emperor. There was no suspense in the battle. Lu Ming had completely annihilated these people and a few members of the evil god tribe.</p><p>“Many thanks!”</p><p>The heaven realm experts were overjoyed to have survived the disaster and thanked Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>“Everyone, what’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>we don’t know either. They had just finished exploring this cursed land and left the cursed land for a short distance before they were surrounded!</p><p>One of the men said.</p><p>“The situation is the same!”</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his eyebrows.</p><p>For the past two days, they had been hurrying on their journey. They had already left the territory of the previous force and arrived at another force. However, this Force’s actions were the same as the previous Force’s.</p><p>Could it be that the surrounding major forces were all controlled by the evil god tribe? Or was he working with the evil god race?</p><p>Lu Ming had a bad feeling in his heart.</p><p>After that, everyone gathered and left the place together.</p><p>A day later, they arrived at the vicinity of a huge city.</p><p>However, there were people checking the city gates around the city.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>After discussing, Lu Ming and the rest changed their appearances, concealed their aura, and walked toward a city gate.</p><p>“All of you, when you enter the city, you must pass through this door, understand?”</p><p>One of the Tauren widened his eyes and chided.</p><p>Lu Ming discovered that there was a pitch-black door outside the city gate. It was not big and there were many strange lines carved on it.</p><p>Everyone who wanted to enter the city had to pass through this door.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, when a white-haired old man passed through the door, the door emitted a brilliant light.</p><p>“The aura of the heaven realm, kill him!”</p><p>A cold shout rang out.</p><p>Then, experts pounced out from all directions.</p><p>“So many experts!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>Two five-star heavenly emperors and one six-star heavenly Emperor instantly rushed out.</p><p>The white-haired old man shouted and retreated, but it was too late.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>A few attacks landed on the white-haired old man, killing him directly.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest could not help but stop in their tracks.</p><p>damn it! It’s the evil god race!</p><p>Someone growled. However, he kept his voice low and didn’t let it out.</p><p>it’s definitely the evil god tribe. The door they created can detect the heaven realm aura on our bodies!</p><p>The celestial said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
