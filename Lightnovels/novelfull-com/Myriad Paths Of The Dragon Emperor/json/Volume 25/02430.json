If he could kill a one star heavenly Emperor, it would be equivalent to crossing an entire major realm to kill the enemy.</p><p>For it to happen to a great emperor or heavenly Emperor, it was an unbelievable thing.</p><p>The higher one’s cultivation level was, the harder it was to fight those of higher cultivation levels.</p><p>To be able to cultivate to the heavenly Emperor realm, which one of them wasn’t a peerless genius?</p><p>Only by mastering an ultimate Maxim could one cultivate to the heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p>Therefore, towards the end, it was extremely, extremely difficult to cross a minor realm to fight an enemy.</p><p>Not to mention crossing a major realm to kill an enemy.</p><p>Moreover, this was only Lu Ming’s estimation.</p><p>In addition to his physical strength, Lu Ming’s combat strength would be even stronger.</p><p>From now on, Lu Ming had entered the ranks of the powerhouses in the heaven realm, primordial realm, and evil god Realm.</p><p>” now is not the time to leave. With my strength, even if I leave, I will be discovered and caught up to. Moreover, even if I leave, in the vast evil god World, where should I go? ”</p><p>Lu Ming started to think again.</p><p>In the end, he decided to discuss it with Qing Cang and the others. He might even escape with them.</p><p>Lu Ming stopped and stood up. He walked to the door and gave it a hard push. The door was pushed open.</p><p>The eternal cage was not strictly managed.</p><p>It was mainly because of the divine ancestor’s treasure, which covered the entire area. No one could break the restriction. Therefore, duo Lei and the other alien races were at ease. Usually, Lu Ming and the others could enter and leave the stone rooms freely.</p><p>To duo Lei and the rest, Lu Ming and the rest could only move around within the area of the restriction at most. They could not run away.</p><p>Moreover, those above the celestial Thearch level had chains and armors that could seal their cultivation base, providing them with an additional layer of insurance.</p><p>Lu Ming walked out of the stone room and followed the passageway. Soon, he arrived at the entrance of another secret room.</p><p>He knocked on the door and a voice came from inside, ” “Come in!”</p><p>Lu Ming pushed the stone door open and walked in. Qing Cang was inside.</p><p>Qing Cang was lying on a bluestone and drinking wine leisurely.</p><p>“Haha, brother Lu Ming, you came at the right time. Drink with me!”</p><p>Qing Cang smiled, took out a pot of wine, and threw it to Lu Ming.</p><p>This wine was given to Qing Cang by Lu Ming. There was no wine to drink in the eternal cage.</p><p>Lu Ming took it and took a sip.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, did you have a breakthrough in your cultivation?”</p><p>Suddenly, Qing Cang’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Although his cultivation was sealed by the chained armor, his eyes were still sharp. He could tell at a glance that Lu Ming had made a breakthrough.</p><p>“I just broke through!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Let me see, what is the great Dao you have comprehended?”</p><p>Qing Cang quickly asked, very curious.</p><p>Lu Ming had mastered 81 types of laws. He was also very curious about what kind of great Dao he would master when he broke through to the great emperor realm.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He was about to ask Qing Cang.</p><p>Qing Cang had lived for a long time, so he might know what the great Dao he had comprehended was.</p><p>With a single thought, a domineering aura emanated from Lu Ming’s body. At the same time, a purple-gold light emanated from his body.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Qing Cang’s expression turned grave when he sensed Lu Ming’s aura.</p><p>“Big brother Qing Cang, do you know what Dao this is?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“It’s so strange. I’ve never seen or heard of such a Dao!” Qing Cang shook his head.</p><p>Qing Cang looked at it carefully and revealed a surprised expression, what a terrifying Dao. There’s a domineering will in it. In front of this Dao, I’m afraid that ordinary great DAOs won’t be able to withstand a single blow. Only the heavenly Dao can contend with it. Moreover, your cultivation is still weak now. In the future, as your cultivation improves, it will become even more amazing and powerful!</p><p>“Sigh, what a pity!”</p><p>Qing Cang let out a long sigh.</p><p>“Big brother Qing Cang, what’s a pity?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>it’s a pity that you’re locked up here. Otherwise, with your talent, you might be able to create a miracle in the future and break through the last barrier to enter the Supreme realm. If that’s the case, the heaven realm might be able to defeat the evil god tribe. What a pity!</p><p>Qing Cang sighed.</p><p>“Big brother Qing Cang, we might be able to get out!”</p><p>Lu Ming said in a low voice.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, what do you mean by that?” Qing Cang glared at him.</p><p>big brother Qing Cang, I won’t hide it from you. I’ve named my great Dao the Dao of sovereign. I’ve opened the restriction of the eternal cage through the Dao of sovereign!</p><p>Lu Ming explained the situation.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Qing Cang’s eyes glowed with a bright light. Even though he was sealed by the chain armor, a terrifying aura still emanated from him.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, you said … Is it true?”</p><p>Qing Cang’s voice trembled.</p><p>He had been locked up here for too long and had no hope of leaving. Now that he heard that he could leave, he was naturally excited.</p><p>yes, it’s absolutely true. However, I’m afraid that duo Lei will soon find out after opening it, so I came to discuss it with big brother Qing Cang!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter. As long as I can get out of this restriction, I can break free from this sealing armor. At that time, even if duo Lei finds out, I’m not afraid of him!”</p><p>Qing Cang said with great confidence.</p><p>Qing Cang was different from the Titan Longhorn and the nine lives devilish silkworm. Although he had been captured during the ancient battle, his injuries hadn’t been that serious and he had long since recovered.</p><p>As long as he could break free from the seal, he would immediately recover his peak heavenly Emperor cultivation base and wouldn’t be afraid of duo Lei.</p><p>“Then where are we going after we leave?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>I’m going to the prison suppression field, so I’m going with Wu tai and the others. This time, I’ll take this opportunity to bring more people out!</p><p>Qing Cang said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He had the same intention.</p><p>There were too many experts in the eternal cage.</p><p>The number of heavenly Emperor realm powerhouses was also shocking. If they could bring them out, they would definitely be able to cause great trouble for the evil god tribe. That way, the pressure on the heaven realm would also be reduced.</p><p>He couldn’t give up on this combat power.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming and Qing Cang discussed the details. Then, they looked for Wu tai and told him about the matter.</p><p>When Mrs. Wu heard this, she was shocked at first, but then she was overjoyed.</p><p>The three of them discussed who they should bring out.</p><p>This matter had to be carried out strictly. He had to bring along people he could trust.</p><p>If this matter was exposed to the alien race, they would probably seal Lu Ming or even kill him. Everything would be over then.</p><p>After some discussion, Wu tai and Qing Cang started to take action. They revealed this matter to some people they could trust and discussed when to take action.</p><p>In the end, there were more than thirty people who knew about this.</p><p>Of course, if they wanted to escape, it would not be just these thirty people. Each of them could find an excuse and invite some people to go with them. As long as they did not tell them the specific details beforehand, they could escape together when Lu Ming opened the restriction.</p><p>In the end, they decided to wait for duo Lei to gather them before taking action.</p><p>Because when he finished absorbing battle Qi, he would definitely need to cultivate. By then, he would be at his lowest alert.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
