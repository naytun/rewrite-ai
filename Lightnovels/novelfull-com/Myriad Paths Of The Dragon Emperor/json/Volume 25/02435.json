I heard that you were locked up in the eternal cage of the alien race…</p><p>Wu Lu flew over and looked at Mrs. Wu with excitement.</p><p>Before Mrs. Wu was caught, she had a good relationship with Wu Lu, so she was naturally happy to see him again.</p><p>“It’s a long story. It’s all thanks to brother Lu Ming. Let me introduce you!”</p><p>Mrs. Wu pointed at Lu Ming and Qing Cang and introduced them to Wu Lu and the rest.</p><p>“Nine-headed Golden Lion!”</p><p>When Wu Lu and the others found out about Qing Gang’s identity, they couldn’t help but be shocked.</p><p>all right, let’s pack up and go back to the prison suppression field!</p><p>Mrs. Wu said.</p><p>Then, they took the storage bracelets and weapons left by the alien race and flew to the prison suppression world.</p><p>The prison suppression field was like a black light shield covering the land of the evil god field. It formed a world of its own, vast and boundless.</p><p>Soon, they were close to the prison suppression field. Lu Ming found that there was a light shield in front of him, blocking his way.</p><p>The reason why the prison suppression field was able to resist the alien races was because of this light shield. The alien races couldn’t break this light shield at all.</p><p>At this point, Lu Ming’s expression changed slightly.</p><p>That was because he felt the bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele in his body buzzing and emitting a burning light.</p><p>It was as if he was extremely excited.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In front of him, the light shield also trembled.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Wu tai, Wu Lu, and the others were shocked.</p><p>The light shield of the prison suppression field had never moved. It wouldn’t even shake when a peak heavenly Emperor attacked it. But why did it suddenly shake?</p><p>The people from the prison suppression field looked at each other with worry in their eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming was also secretly shocked.</p><p>“Is the prison-guarding world really related to the prison-guarding stele? Otherwise, why would the prison-suppressing stele have such an abnormality?”</p><p>Lu Ming had many thoughts in his mind.</p><p>He could feel that the prison-guarding stele was about to fly away. Lu Ming quickly suppressed and controlled the prison-guarding stele, hiding it in his body.</p><p>The prison-guarding stele was the key to suppressing the third bloodline. If the prison-guarding stele flew away, who knew what would happen?</p><p>At the very least, he could not let the prison-suppressing stele fly away for the time being. Lu Ming felt that the third bloodline was like a time bomb.</p><p>Wu Lu sent a message. Not long after, a door opened automatically in the light shield. Lu Ming and the rest walked into the light shield.</p><p>As he walked into the light shield, Lu Ming felt that the strange movement of the prison-suppressing stele in his body was stronger.</p><p>When they all entered the light barrier, the light barrier sealed up again.</p><p>“Wu Lu, are you guys alright?”</p><p>Immediately, someone came over to greet him.</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze across the crowd. There were many people and they were all humans.</p><p>elder Liu, take a look! Who’s back? ”</p><p>Wu Lu laughed heartily as he walked forward, welcoming an old man with snow-white hair.</p><p>The old man swept his gaze across Lu Ming and the rest, his expression ecstatic.</p><p>“Mrs. Wu, Wang Qi, it’s you guys!”</p><p>The old man saw Wu tai and the others and called out in surprise.</p><p>This time, most of the people who escaped were from the prison guard world. There were not many from the heaven realm. The people from the prison guard world were overjoyed to see Wu tai and the others return.</p><p>“Elder Liu!”</p><p>Wu tai and the others went up to him.</p><p>“You’re all back. Good, good, good!”</p><p>Elder Liu’s face was full of smiles, and so were the others.</p><p>With so many people back, and all of them were heavenly Emperor realm Masters, the strength of the prison suppression field would be greatly enhanced.</p><p>I heard that all of you have been locked up in the eternal cage. No one has ever been able to escape from that place since ancient times. How did you get out? ”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>The others also looked at Wu tai and the others curiously.</p><p>“It’s all thanks to brother Lu Ming…”</p><p>Wu tai first introduced Lu Ming and the rest, then briefly explained how they had escaped.</p><p>After elder Liu and the others heard this, they were naturally secretly amazed.</p><p>They were shocked that Lu Ming could break the restriction of the eternal cage and even kill the celestial Thearch at such a young age.</p><p>it’s good that you’re back. Let’s go, I’ll inform the elder Council and we’ll celebrate!</p><p>Elder Liu said, and then spread the news.</p><p>Then, they flew toward the inside of the prison suppression field.</p><p>The prison suppression field was vast, no different from a world.</p><p>They flew past a large area of mountains and rivers. Suddenly, Lu Ming’s pupils contracted sharply, and he was extremely shocked.</p><p>After flying for a while, they saw a stone tablet in front of them.</p><p>This stone tablet was incomparably huge. It stood on the ground, supporting the heavens and the earth. It was unknown how high it was.</p><p>It gave off an infinite amount of light. A pillar of light shot out from the tablet and pierced the sky.</p><p>On the tablet, there were three big words: The prison-guarding stele!</p><p>The prison-guarding stele, there was a prison-guarding stele here!</p><p>Furthermore, it didn’t look illusory, but real!</p><p>Could there be two or more prison-suppressing steles?</p><p>At this moment, many thoughts flashed through Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the prison-suppressing stele in Lu Ming’s body shook even more violently, especially the three big words ‘prison-suppressing stele’, which were shining brightly.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In front of him, the huge ‘prison-guarding stele’ suddenly shook, and a terrifying wave spread between the sky and the earth.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>All the people from the prison suppression field were shocked.</p><p>The prison-guarding stele suddenly shook, which was a rare thing.</p><p>However, it was not over yet. The prison-suppressing stele that stood between heaven and earth was shaking more and more violently, and it kept buzzing.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Not only that, but violent rumbles also came from other directions. The entire world was shaking.</p><p>all the prison-guarding steles are shaking. How is this possible? ”</p><p>Elder Liu cried out in alarm.</p><p>The prison-guarding stele was the foundation of the prison-guarding field.</p><p>Because of the prison-guarding stele, the prison-guarding stele produced a light shield that isolated the outside world from the outside world, so the alien races couldn’t get in.</p><p>Without the light shield, the prison suppression field would have been annihilated if the alien races had gathered all their forces.</p><p>The prison-guarding stele had never shook so violently before. What had happened?</p><p>At this moment, the prison-suppressing stele in Lu Ming’s body also shook crazily. It was getting more and more intense. In the end, Lu Ming could no longer suppress it.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body glowed with a brilliant light. Then, the prison-suppressing stele emerged from his body and quickly grew in size, turning into a giant stele that reached the sky. It resonated with the prison-suppressing stele in front of it and echoed each other.</p><p>“This … This is the prison guarding stele!”</p><p>Elder Liu, Wu tai, Wu Lu, and the rest roared in disbelief when they saw the prison-suppressing stele on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Prison guarding stele!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. His mind whirred. At this moment, he thought of many things.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>At this moment, beams of light flew over from the distance. Each beam of light contained an expert. There were old men and middle-aged men and women. All of them had powerful auras and were all at the world realm.</p><p>“Prison guarding stele!”</p><p>When they saw the prison-suppressing stele above Lu Ming’s head, they all exclaimed in shock.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
