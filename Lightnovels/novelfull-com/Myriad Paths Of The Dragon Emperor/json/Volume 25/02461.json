After a loud boom, the other party’s body shook violently and he flew backward. He kept retreating and his face was a little pale.</p><p>this kind of training method is somewhat similar to the primordial training system, but not exactly. It’s more similar to little Qing’s training method, but it’s far less exquisite than little Qing’s!</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing.</p><p>this kid is quite capable. I’ll take him down!</p><p>A middle-aged woman said. This middle-aged woman was tall and strong, but she used a large saber. The blade was faster than the palm.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>The middle-aged woman moved and pounced toward Lu Ming. She slashed hundreds of times in an instant. The dazzling Saber Light was about to annihilate Lu Ming.</p><p>There was only pure power on each blade light. There was no fluctuation of nomological laws or great Dao.</p><p>Lu Ming moved like a butterfly, shuttling back and forth between the knife lights, sensing the other party’s cultivation path in detail.</p><p>The middle-aged woman was a four star great emperor. Her expression changed. She shouted and unleashed all of her strength. She slashed her saber at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, they could not even touch the corner of Lu Ming’s clothes. Lu Ming always dodged them exquisitely.</p><p>At the side, the other people’s faces all became serious.</p><p>“Let’s attack together and take him down!”</p><p>The five star great emperor ordered.</p><p>This person had the highest cultivation level among this group of people.</p><p>The strength that Lu Ming had displayed was too powerful. Even a four star great emperor was fooled by him. Even if he were to take action personally, he was afraid that he would not be able to do anything to Lu Ming. Therefore, he had asked everyone to attack together!</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>die! Big River shouted softly and pounced at Lu Ming first. He struck out with his palm, and the force of his palm was overwhelming.</p><p>At the same time, the other 30 plus people also made their moves. Of course, except for the young woman, who was not a great emperor.</p><p>The combined attack of more than thirty great emperors was shockingly powerful. All kinds of attacks were aimed at Lu Ming from all directions.</p><p>“Let’s stop here!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. A purple-gold light flashed on his body and he instantly struck more than thirty times.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>There were more than 30 consecutive explosions. More than 30 silhouettes retreated frantically. Each and every one of them was pale as they stared at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>Lu Ming had only used one move and he had instantly repelled them.</p><p>They understood that Lu Ming was too powerful, far above them. Lu Ming had been merciful just now. Otherwise, they would have all died.</p><p>The young woman’s eyes were brimming with tears. She stared at Lu Ming and said, why is mo you so ruthless? my father is already seriously injured. Why don’t you let us cure him? ”</p><p>“Did you capture that Jade Blood Fox to treat someone’s injuries?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“You’re still acting dumb. Don’t you know that mo you sent you here? Mo you injured my father, and only the blood of the Jade Blood Fox can cure my father’s injuries!”</p><p>The young woman said.</p><p>On the other hand, the burly man and the rest surrounded the young lady cautiously to prevent Lu Ming from attacking her.</p><p>“Where is the Jade Blood Fox? perhaps I can help you catch it!”</p><p>Lu Ming touched his nose and said. After all, he was the one who disturbed the other party’s capture of the Jade Blood Fox. He was a little embarrassed.</p><p>Moreover, if he could help the other party capture the Jade-Blood Fox, he would definitely win their favor. Lu Ming had just arrived and needed to find out more information through the people in netherworld mountain.</p><p>“You’ll help us? Although your cultivation is high, it’s impossible for you to catch a Jade Blood Fox. A Jade Blood Fox comes and goes without a trace, doesn’t have a fixed residence, and is extremely fast. It’s very difficult to find a trace of it unless you use the Jade blood grass to attract it. However, the Jade blood grass is too rare. Do you know how much effort we spent to buy one?</p><p>Where can we get the Jade blood grass now?”</p><p>The young woman was on the verge of tears as she spoke. She looked at Lu Ming with hidden bitterness.</p><p>“What? Jade blood grass? Rare?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>He remembered that there was also a spiritual herb in the heaven realm called the Jade blood herb. Although it was not common, it was very common. Lu Ming had at least a few hundred of them.</p><p>Could it be that they only had the same name?</p><p>Lu Ming was a little uncertain.</p><p>“Miss, the Jade blood grass you mentioned, is it this kind?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. A spiritual herb appeared in his hand and he showed it to the young lady.</p><p>The young woman and the others widened their eyes.</p><p>“Jade blood grass, you also have Jade blood grass? You … Can you sell this Jade blood grass to us?”</p><p>After the young woman finished speaking, she stuck out her tongue and secretly scolded herself for being stupid. The other party had come specifically to disrupt their capture of the Jade Blood Fox, so why would he sell them the Jade blood grass?</p><p>He was probably here to make them angry.</p><p>Many thoughts flashed through the young woman’s mind.</p><p>But the next moment, her eyes suddenly widened.</p><p>This was because there was a continuous flash of light in Lu Ming’s hand. A pile</p><p>of Jade blood grass appeared. There were dozens of them.</p><p>“This… So many? How is that possible?”</p><p>The young woman was dumbfounded.</p><p>The others weren’t any better.</p><p>Although the Jade blood grass was not a high-level spiritual grass, it was very rare. They had spent a lot of effort to buy one, and they had already used it up.</p><p>However, Lu Ming took out dozens of them at once, making them think that they were dreaming.</p><p>there’s no need to sell it. Since I’m the one who disturbed you guys from capturing the Jade-Blood Fox, I should atone for my sins by helping you guys capture the Jade-Blood Fox!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Are you really going to help us? Are you really not sent by mo you?”</p><p>The young woman asked.</p><p>of course not. I really landed here unintentionally. Previously, I was fighting with an enemy in the sky, but I was no match for him and was blasted down bv him!</p><p>Lu Ming told a lie.</p><p>“I see. It seems like we have wronged you. I’m sorry!”</p><p>The young woman stuck out her tongue and smiled, looking very cute.</p><p>“Then let’s start. How do I use the Jade blood grass?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>it’ll be fine as long as it’s ignited. Once the Jade blood grass is ignited, it will emit a strange smell that will attract the Jade Blood Fox!</p><p>however, we have to change our location. We have just disturbed it here. The jadeblood Fox is extremely cautious, and I’m afraid it won’t come a second time. Let’s go ahead!</p><p>The young woman said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and flew forward.</p><p>The gravity here was too strong. It was thousands of times stronger than the heaven realm. As a result, flying here was thousands of times more laborious and naturally, the speed was much slower.</p><p>The young woman and the other thirty-odd people also rose into the air and followed Lu Ming.</p><p>my name is Xu Rong. What’s your name? ”</p><p>The young woman asked on the way.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Lu Ming answered.</p><p>In a short while, they had flown tens of thousands of miles, planning to catch the jadeblood Fox here.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately ignited ten stalks of Jade blood grass, causing Xu Rong and the rest to feel heartache.</p><p>The Jade blood grass emitted a strange smell that spread far away.</p><p>As for Lu Ming and the rest, they retreated a hundred miles and surrounded the area. They then waited quietly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
