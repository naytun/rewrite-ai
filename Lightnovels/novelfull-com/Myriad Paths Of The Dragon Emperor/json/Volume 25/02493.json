What kind of danger have you not encountered? moreover, you’re an expert in the martial God Realm. We can’t compare with you. I don’t thinkyou’ll be in trouble so easily!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>I feel the same way. We don’t have to worry fearlessly. What we have to do is to improve ourselves as much as possible and kill the evil god tribe!</p><p>Zhan Li said.</p><p>Although he said that, everyone’s hearts were still weighed down by a huge stone that was difficult to let go.</p><p>There was more than one God in the yellow Springs Empire. If they worked with the non-human divine ancestor to deal with the ancestral Dragon, the situation would be hard to say.</p><p>After all, the ancestral Dragon was still injured and not in his peak state.</p><p>“Lu Ming, where are you guys going?”</p><p>The Titan longhorn beetle asked.</p><p>we were going to the yellow Springs Empire to find out more about the situation. Now, I’ve decided to go to the imperial capital of the yellow Springs Empire!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“To the netherworld imperial capital?”</p><p>The expressions of the Titan longhorn beetle and the others changed.</p><p>that’s right. I want to find out more about senior ancestral Dragon. Anyway, we can’t go to the other forces or other Cursed Lands. We might as well go to the netherworld imperial capital!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Instead of hiding and wasting time, he might as well go to the yellow Springs Empire and find out the situation.</p><p>Only by knowing the specific situation would they be able to respond better, however, the gates of the imperial capital of the netherworld have been tampered with by the evil god tribe. As soon as we, the living beings of the heaven realm, approach, we will be discovered. There is no way we can enter the imperial capital of the netherworld!</p><p>Zhan Li sighed.</p><p>senior, I won’t take risks easily. If I really can’t get in, I’ll stay near the yellow Springs Empire and see if I can get anything!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“How about this, let’s go together. The more people there are, the better we can look out for each other!”</p><p>The nine lives devilish silkworm rarely spoke.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go together!”</p><p>Zhan Li, the Titan longhorn beetle, and the others all nodded their heads.</p><p>that’s good. Seniors, you can all enter my small world. It’ll be more convenient for me to act alone!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The others nodded.</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming’s small world appeared. Everyone turned into rays of light and entered Lu Ming’s small world.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming changed his appearance and headed to the netherworld imperial capital alone.</p><p>The yellow Springs Empire, the ruler of the yellow Springs world, had a vast territory.</p><p>The territory of the yellow Springs Empire alone was comparable to the taiqing heavenly region.</p><p>Around the yellow Springs Empire, there were other forces of various sizes.</p><p>Lu Ming moved alone and his speed increased sharply. He traversed the void and was many times faster than before.</p><p>In less than a day, Lu Ming had arrived near the netherworld imperial capital. The capital of the netherworld Kingdom was extremely majestic. It was even larger than two world city. It was larger than any city that Lu Ming had ever seen.</p><p>There were many roads leading to the capital of the netherworld Kingdom.</p><p>Tens of thousands of miles away from the yellow Springs Empire, there were towering mountains.</p><p>Lu Ming appeared on a mountain and looked into the distance.</p><p>As expected, the city gates of the netherworld imperial capital had been tampered with by the evil god race. As long as one entered, they would be able to detect the aura of the heaven realm.</p><p>Lu Ming changed his direction and looked at the other city gates. It was the same. Lu Ming even saw traces of the evil god tribe at some of the city gates.</p><p>“How can I sneak into the netherworld imperial capital?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>If they could not enter the netherworld imperial capital, it would be very difficult for them to obtain useful information.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming turned around and shouted coldly. His gaze was as sharp as a sword.</p><p>He could feel that there was a disturbance in the space behind him.</p><p>” Lu Ming, your spiritual senses are getting sharper!”</p><p>A light chuckle was heard. Then, a figure flashed and a stunning woman appeared.</p><p>“Little Qing!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>Who else could this beautiful woman be other than Xie nianqing?</p><p>Lu Ming did not expect to meet Xie nianqing here.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ve made great progress in your cultivation!”</p><p>Xie nianqing smiled charmingly. He walked over and held Lu Ming’s hand.</p><p>as your man, how can I not improve? I’ll be surpassed by you!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>At the same time, he also noticed that Xie nianqing had improved a lot.</p><p>Now, Xie nianqing’s cultivation had reached the level of a five star heavenly Emperor.</p><p>When they entered netherworld mountain, Xie nianqing was a two-star heavenly Emperor. In just 20 years, his cultivation had broken through three levels. This was extremely shocking.</p><p>Xie nianqing was a heavenly Emperor, not a great emperor. It was extremely difficult for a heavenly Emperor to advance.</p><p>Breaking through three levels in a row in over twenty years. If this were to be known, it would be terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that ever since Xie nianqing devoured her memories from her previous life, her cultivation speed had become even more terrifying. It was much faster than before she devoured them.</p><p>However, even so, it could not have happened so quickly. Lu Ming knew that Xie nianqing must have had a fortuitous encounter in netherworld mountain.</p><p>Moreover, Xie nianqing’s combat power was extremely strong.</p><p>Back when he was a peak Emperor, he could already fight Lu Ming. Although Xie nianqing was a five-star heavenly Emperor now, he could definitely fight a peak Emperor or even stronger.</p><p>you’re so smug. Do you believe that I’ll beat you to the ground right now?!</p><p>Xie nianqing rolled his eyes at Lu Ming, but his face was full of smiles.</p><p>“Little Qing, why are you here?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>right now, there are traces of the evil god tribe everywhere. The other powers are all working with the evil god tribe. I heard that something happened to the ancestral Dragon here, so I came to take a look!</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>it’s a pity that the evil god tribe has set up formations that can detect the aura of the heaven realm at all the city gates. We can’t get in at all. Otherwise, we could go in and ask for some information!</p><p>Lu Ming said helplessly.</p><p>The entire Yellow Springs Empire’s city walls were set up with a large formation. One couldn’t fly in directly. If they wanted to enter, they had to enter through the four city gates.</p><p>“That’s easy. I have a way to cover up the aura of the heaven realm on my body!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“Do you have a way to hide the aura of the heaven realm?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked and very surprised.</p><p>It was easy to conceal one’s aura.</p><p>However, the auras of worlds like the heaven realm and the primordial realm were shapeless and incorporeal. They couldn’t be sensed normally, but they were engraved into one’s bones and soul. They couldn’t be erased.</p><p>You’re a creature from the heaven realm and the primordial realm, so you’re born with the marks of these two worlds. How could Xie nianqing cover it up?</p><p>On second thought, Lu Ming felt at ease.</p><p>Xie nianqing had devoured the memories of his previous life.</p><p>Her background in her previous life was probably very shocking and unfathomable. It was normal for her to have all kinds of wondrous methods.</p><p>“Well, now you know how powerful I am!”</p><p>Xie nianqing smiled, then his ten fingers bloomed like a lotus flower. Strange patterns appeared and finally condensed into a Black Lotus.</p><p>The Black Lotus flew toward Lu Ming and fused into his body.</p><p>“Alright, I’m done!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said as she continued to form seals. A lotus flower appeared on her body and disappeared in a flash.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
