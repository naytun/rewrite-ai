Interesting!</p><p>and his battle prowess is astonishing. Let’s go and take a look!</p><p>Such discussions could be heard everywhere on the holy mountain. Then, one figure after another flew out of the holy mountain and approached Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>There were even heavenly Emperor powerhouses who had arrived.</p><p>“Labu, it’slabu!”</p><p>Suddenly, someone shouted.</p><p>Everyone saw a young man coming from the Holy Mountain and standing in the air.</p><p>This person was a member of the non-human royal family. He had purple hair, but his appearance was ordinary. He was thin, and his face was cold. His eyes were pale gold, and a cold light flowed between his eyes.</p><p>After he arrived, he swept his gaze across Lu Ming and revealed a strong desire to fight.</p><p>labu is ranked 19th on the longevity Roll. He’s only been cultivating for 3700 years, and he’s definitely a rare genius!</p><p>“That’s right, with labu’s help, that brat will definitely lose!”</p><p>“Look, kuiju is here too!”</p><p>As everyone was discussing, an even stronger cry of surprise suddenly erupted.</p><p>A young man appeared in the sky.</p><p>This young man was also a member of the non-human royal family, but he was different from labu. He was very handsome and had Jade-like skin. He was even more beautiful than a woman.</p><p>Upon seeing this young man, labu’s pale golden eyes flashed with solemnity and fear.</p><p>Kuiju was ranked ninth on the longevity Roll, ten places higher than labu. He was much stronger.</p><p>even kui ju, one of the top ten on the longevity Roll, is here. Let’s see how arrogant that human brat can be this time!</p><p>“That’s right. This time, he’ll be the one to be beaten into a dead dog!”</p><p>“I’m really looking forward to it!”</p><p>Everyone was looking forward to the next battle.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he was indifferent to all these. He had a leisurely look on his face as he closed his eyes to rest.</p><p>Following that, more and more experts came.</p><p>There were dozens of Longevity Roll experts present. Seven or eight of the top twenty had come, and even a few of the top ten had come.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re still pretending to be calm. Now that the expert is here, do you dare to fight?”</p><p>Mo tianluo shouted.</p><p>Among the people present, no one looked forward to Lu Ming being abused more than him.</p><p>He could not wait to see Lu Ming being abused.</p><p>“Are all of you here? I’m afraid it’s another bunch of weaklings. Why don’t we wait a little longer?”</p><p>Lu Ming opened his eyes and said casually.</p><p>The experts on the longevity Roll almost vomited blood from anger.</p><p>All of them were filled with fighting spirit, and their eyes were burning with anger.</p><p>you’re boasting shamelessly. Don’t think that you’re invincible just because you’ve defeated a few people. I’ll come and fight you!</p><p>With a roar, a burly alien rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Everyone immediately recognized that this person was an expert ranked thirty-second on the longevity Roll. His battle prowess was extremely profound.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming also rushed out and threw a punch.</p><p>Lu Ming’s punch exploded with a shocking amount of power, directly crushing the other party’s attack. The other party spat out a large mouthful of blood and was sent flying.</p><p>“Like I said, I can’t even withstand a single blow!”</p><p>Lu Ming said in disdain.</p><p>He didn’t want to dawdle any longer. He immediately displayed his powerful strength so that the weaker ones didn’t dare to go up.</p><p>The eyes of the longevity Roll experts narrowed.</p><p>Lu Ming was indeed capable.</p><p>“I’ll fight you!”</p><p>A voice rang out, and then a thin figure stepped out.</p><p>Everyone recognized him as the nineteenth-ranked labu on the longevity Roll.</p><p>Finally, the top twenty experts of the longevity Roll were about to make their move. Everyone was filled with anticipation.</p><p>“Make your move!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Before Lu Ming could finish his sentence, labu moved at an astonishing speed and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>With every step he took, the void trembled and his speed increased. When he neared Lu Ming, his speed had reached its maximum.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>His palm was like a knife as he slashed at Lu Ming with shocking power.</p><p>However, the most shocking thing was yet to come.</p><p>Just as his palm was about to reach Lu Ming, his palm suddenly changed.</p><p>His palm was like mercury. It suddenly elongated and wriggled, turning into a saber. It slashed at Lu Ming at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>“What is this technique…”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and his muscles trembled. He retreated rapidly and dodged the other party’s saber.</p><p>However, as soon as Lu Ming retreated, the other party’s palm changed again.</p><p>It wriggled rapidly and turned into a soft whip. The soft whip had spikes on it as it whipped toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“It can even be like this…”</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely surprised and he struck out with his palm.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>When his palm hit the soft whip, it was as if he had hit a mountain, causing a violent vibration.</p><p>“Five star great emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. The other party’s cultivation was equivalent to a five star great emperor.</p><p>However, he was definitely a genius among geniuses, considering that he had cultivated to this level in just a few thousand years. His combat strength was extremely shocking, and he couldn’t be compared to ordinary five star great emperors.</p><p>Lu Ming was not his opponent’s match with his physical strength alone. After the collision, Lu Ming was forced to retreat.</p><p>“Lu Ming is no match for them!”</p><p>Hahaha, I knew that labu would definitely win!”</p><p>come on, let’s beat that brat up. A human dares to be arrogant in our realm!</p><p>The surrounding non-humans were very excited.</p><p>Mo tianluo, storm, and the others also looked excited.</p><p>After forcing Lu Ming back with one attack, labu’s other hand also struck at Lu Ming.</p><p>His other hand turned into a weapon as well. It was a combat sword and he slashed it at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Looks like I’ll need to use the combination of laws!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. Then, rays of light appeared on his body.</p><p>More than ten rays of light covered Lu Ming’s body, like a colorful armor.</p><p>Lu Ming cast a modified version of the chaos Divine palm and struck the labu with both palms.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The two of them collided continuously, causing loud rumbles.</p><p>Labu’s attack style was very strange. His hands seemed to be really made of mercury, and they could change into all kinds of weapons at will. The key was that they were extremely powerful and could change into many things, making it impossible to guard against.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s explosive world force and the augmentation of more than ten types of laws caused his combat strength to skyrocket and he was faintly suppressing his opponent.</p><p>The reason why Lu Ming did not unleash his full power to defeat his opponent was that he felt that the alien races had strange and mysterious means. He wanted to see more of them.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two of them had exchanged dozens of moves. Lu Ming seemed to have the upper hand.</p><p>The surrounding non-humans didn’t say anything, and their faces were filled with depression.</p><p>Labu was actually at a disadvantage. Those people who had thought that labu would definitely win felt that they had lost face.</p><p>At this moment, labu also started to feel anxious.</p><p>Suddenly, he changed his attack.</p><p>He actually charged toward Lu Ming head-on and adopted a desperate fighting style.</p><p>However, to Lu Ming’s surprise, just as he charged forward, his head and his hands transformed rapidly and sharp spikes grew out.</p><p>His head had become like a giant hammer.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
