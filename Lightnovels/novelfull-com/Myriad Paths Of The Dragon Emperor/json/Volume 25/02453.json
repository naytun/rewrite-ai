She had given up so much for Lu Ming and had never asked for anything in return. How could Lu Ming not know that? how could he not be moved?</p><p>“Young master, thank you!”</p><p>Qiu Yue leaned into Lu Ming’s arms and hugged him tightly, as if she was unwilling to let go for the rest of her life.</p><p>The moonlight cast a long shadow on the two of them, as if they were one.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming stayed in the heavenly Emperor City for three months. During these three months, Lu Ming did not cultivate much. He spent his time with Lu shenhuang and the rest, accompanying Li Ping and Lu Yuntian.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming also took the time to give a lecture.</p><p>In addition to the people from the Dragon Alliance and Dragon God Valley, people from other forces in the heavenly Emperor City also gathered to listen to Lu Ming’s lecture.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming started his speech, the aura shocked everyone.</p><p>Lu Ming was like a god that ruled the world, explaining the mysteries of the world to the fullest.</p><p>The celestial Emperor!</p><p>Some people speculated that Lu Ming must have reached the heavenly Emperor realm. A great emperor definitely did not have such an aura.</p><p>The rumor that Lu Ming was the heavenly Emperor spread like wildfire and shocked the entire heavenly Emperor City. After that, the entire Yuan mountain was shocked.</p><p>Furthermore, this piece of news spread to other places at a terrifying speed. It caused a huge commotion in the entire primordial realm.</p><p>Lu Ming had become a heavenly Emperor. This news had shocked many people.</p><p>Lu Ming stayed in the heavenly Emperor City for a few months. Then, he brought Lu shenhuang and the rest back to the heaven realm.</p><p>After returning to the heaven realm, he rushed to Xie nianqing’s residence without stopping.</p><p>It had been more than a hundred years, but Xie nianqing’s residence had not changed. It was still the same place.</p><p>From afar, Lu Ming could see Xie nianqing cultivating on a mountain peak. His entire body was enveloped in a strange black energy.</p><p>“Peak Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed when he sensed Xie nianqing’s aura.</p><p>He was afraid that Xie nianqing’s cultivation level was too high. If Xie nianqing had also reached the heavenly Emperor realm, it would be more difficult for him to control Xie nianqing.</p><p>On the other hand, Xie nianqing’s cultivation base was only at the great emperor realm. Lu Ming was confident.</p><p>“You guys stand here, don’t come over!”</p><p>Lu Ming instructed Lu shenhuang and the rest before he stepped forward and walked towards Xie nianqing.</p><p>When Lu Ming was a distance away from Xie nianqing, Xie nianqing suddenly opened his eyes. His gaze was filled with a cold light.</p><p>“Lowly ant, it’s you, die!”</p><p>Xie nianqing shouted and turned into a black stream of light, pouncing at Lu Ming.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>As he neared Lu Ming, a long sword appeared in Xie nianqing’s hand. He swung his sword, and a Dark Sword light slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming cast the way of domination. His palm was covered with purple-gold light as he struck out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm collided with Xie nianqing’s sword radiance, creating a loud boom.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s sword light dissipated. Her delicate body trembled and she couldn’t help but take two steps back.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s body shook violently and he took a few steps back.</p><p>“What a terrifying power!”</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely shocked.</p><p>After clashing with Xie nianqing, she felt that Xie nianqing’s power was so powerful that it seemed to tear apart her ruler’s power.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s current cultivation base was only one star great emperor, he could suppress and even kill a one star Celestial Emperor with the Dao of domination alone.</p><p>Xie nianqing had actually managed to repel such a force.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s combat strength was also shocking. With his peak Emperorcultivation, he could fight above his level and even kill a heavenly Emperor.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Xie nianqing shouted and charged at Lu Ming again.</p><p>Lu Ming condensed a long spear in his palm and swept it towards Xie nianqing.</p><p>Lu Ming did not use his physical strength. He fought Xie nianqing with the power of the way of domination.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them clashed continuously, and in the blink of an eye, they had exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked to discover that he was actually at a disadvantage.</p><p>He wasn’t Xie nianqing’s match with just one Dao of domination.</p><p>He couldn’t help but secretly rejoice that Xie nianqing hadn’t broken through to the heavenly Emperor realm. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to suppress Xie nianqing.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s muscles and bones trembled and he began to release his physical strength.</p><p>The combination of physical strength and the way of domination greatly increased Lu Ming’s combat strength. With a shake of his spear, a terrifying force surged towards Xie nianqing.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s body retreated rapidly, his face pale.</p><p>Lu Ming seized the opportunity and pounced on Xie nianqing. His spear swept toward Xie nianqing again.</p><p>Xie nianqing shouted. The black light around his body was extremely intense. A bright sword light burst out, but it was destroyed after colliding with Lu Ming’s long spear.</p><p>Xie nianqing retreated again.</p><p>Lu Ming quickly followed.</p><p>In the distance, Lu shenhuang and the others were extremely anxious.</p><p>don’t worry. Lu Ming will not hurt your mother. He’s helping her!</p><p>A figure suddenly appeared beside Lu shenhuang and the rest. It was Xie nianjun.</p><p>Xie nianjun was dressed in white and his aura was unfathomable.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Lu shenhuang nodded.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming rushed towards Xie nianqing. The spear disappeared and turned into a big hand, grabbing at the young man.</p><p>Xie nianqing shouted as the black light around him grew even more intense. It then turned into Black Lotus flowers that surrounded Xie nianqing.</p><p>Lu Ming’s big hand grabbed the Lotus but was blocked by it.</p><p>The defensive power of this lotus flower was shocking.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes and rushed over, his fists constantly blasting out.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The Lotus flowers around Xie nianqing’s body kept on rumbling. One by one, the Lotus flowers exploded and disappeared into energy.</p><p>“Open it!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted as the power of domination filled his entire body. He exerted force and broke apart the Lotus flowers. Then, he reached out and held Xie nianqing in his arms.</p><p>“Lowly ant, you’re courting death!”</p><p>Xie nianqing fought back with all his might. His strength was so strong that Lu Ming’s arm went numb.</p><p>Lu Ming exerted all his strength and held Xie nianqing’s slender waist tightly. His other hand grabbed both of Xie nianqing’s arms. Then, he poured his Dominator’s power into Xie nianqing’s body and suppressed her strength.</p><p>The power of domination was indeed very advanced and powerful. It slowly suppressed Xie nianqing’s power.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s resistance was getting weaker and weaker.</p><p>“Ant, ant, you’re courting death…”</p><p>Xie nianqing continued to shout.</p><p>shut up. Wait a minute. Watch how I conquer you!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly.</p><p>Anyway, this wasn’t Xie nianqing. It was just his memory from his previous life.</p><p>“You guys wait here!”</p><p>Lu Ming said to Lu shenhuang and the rest. Then, he brought Xie nianqing and flew into the distance. They came to a hidden place and entered the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>“What do you want to do?”</p><p>Xie nianqing shouted.</p><p>“Xiao Qing and I already have a child. We’re an old couple, what do you think I’m doing?”</p><p>Lu Ming gave a strange smile.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s face turned pale and he screamed in fear, ” “No, don’t! I won’t let you off…”</p><p>Si la!</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to talk nonsense and started to take action.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
