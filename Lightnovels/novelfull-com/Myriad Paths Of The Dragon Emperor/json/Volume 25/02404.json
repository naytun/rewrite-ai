Even an ordinary heavenly Emperor could change the situation.</p><p>The alien’s eyes were ferocious as he looked at Lu Ming and dandan. He took a step forward and appeared above them.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A huge Mace appeared in his hand and he swung it at Lu Ming.</p><p>The mace had yet to reach them, but the terrifying Qi had already made it difficult for dandan, Lu Ming, and the rest to breathe.</p><p>Dandan and Lu Ming made their moves at the same time.</p><p>Dandan opened her mouth and spat out a world, while Lu Ming punched out continuously with both fists, gathering into a blood-red fist force that hit the mace.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>With two consecutive loud bangs, the small world that dandan had spat out shook violently and then flew back into dandan’s body. Dandan’s body retreated rapidly and she spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Lu Ming’s fist force was also crushed. He retreated rapidly, his body felt like it was about to be torn apart.</p><p>The celestial Thearch was too powerful!</p><p>Although Lu Ming could kill a peak great emperor with the power he borrowed, he was still no match for the celestial Thearch.</p><p>“All of you, die!”</p><p>The non-human celestial Thearch’s eyes were ferocious as he charged toward Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>“That brat has the bloodline of the sacred ancestor bloodheart. We can’t kill him. Take him down. As for the others, kill them without mercy!”</p><p>Another voice came from the other side of the passage.</p><p>The alien heavenly Emperor’s eyes flickered as he brandished his Mace and smashed it towards dandan.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>Lu Ming rushed over and blocked this move, but his injuries worsened.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At this moment, the tunnel was shaking violently, and the crack was getting bigger and bigger.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this time, another figure rushed out of the crack. It was also an alien race powerhouse. From his aura, he was also a heavenly Emperor.</p><p>“Damnit!”</p><p>Earth One, Thunder one, and the others roared, extremely anxious.</p><p>The foreign races were going all out and continuously sending their experts over.</p><p>That passage hadn’t been fully opened yet. The non-humankind would have to pay a heavy price to send their powerful warriors here.</p><p>But the alien race didn’t seem to care.</p><p>“I’m finished, this Lord will die Here today!”</p><p>Dandan looked up to the sky and sighed.</p><p>With two non-human heavenly emperors appearing in a row, there was no way they could escape.</p><p>“Hahaha, just surrender!”</p><p>The non-human celestial Thearch laughed and swung his Mace at Lu Ming and the rest again.</p><p>The foreign being who came later also charged over.</p><p>if this continues, I’ll go all out. Strength, strength, I want strength!</p><p>Lu Ming roared in his heart.</p><p>“As you wish!”</p><p>A cold voice came from the third bloodline. The blood sea churned and formed a huge human face.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Waves of more powerful energy surged into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Lu Ming’s power was rising steadily.</p><p>“This kid…”</p><p>The two foreign heavenly emperors looked grim.</p><p>it’s the power of the sacred ancestor bloodheart. Attack and take him down!</p><p>A dignified voice came from the other side of the passage.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>That passage shook more violently. The alien tribes were still worried. They wanted to send more experts here.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming looked up to the sky and roared.</p><p>At this moment, his will was completely overwhelmed by the endless killing intent.</p><p>At this moment, there was only endless killing intent in Lu Ming’s heart and nothing else.</p><p>He had forgotten everything and was completely controlled by his instincts and killing intent.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and charged toward the two foreign celestial Thearch.</p><p>The two foreign celestial thearchs had grave expressions on their faces. They did not dare to hold back. They used all their strength to fight Lu Ming.</p><p>Continuous rumbles were heard. The two foreign celestial thearchs were locked in a fierce battle with Lu Ming.</p><p>The alien celestial Thearch was actually blocked by Lu Ming.</p><p>” Brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>Bubbles was extremely anxious.</p><p>it’s over. This kid is completely controlled by the killing intent!</p><p>Dandan was also extremely anxious.</p><p>little guy, we must rush out. If no one manages to rush out, then everything will be over!</p><p>Dandan sent a voice transmission to bubble and then rushed out with all her might.</p><p>However, there were too many foreign races. They kept rushing towards dandan and blocked her way.</p><p>They were completely passive.</p><p>Tu Yi and Lei Yi were blocked while Lu Ming was engaged in a fierce battle with the two foreign celestial thearchs. Dandan and the others were also blocked. If this continued, they would be left behind sooner or later.</p><p>“Power, power…”</p><p>Lu Ming had lost his consciousness and only had his instincts.</p><p>He instinctively wanted to tear apart the enemy in front of him and kill all the living beings he saw.</p><p>Therefore, the third bloodline continued to pour energy into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Lu Ming’s strength grew stronger and stronger. At first, he could only fight to a draw with the two Outlander heavenly emperors. However, slowly, Lu Ming began to gain the upper hand and began to suppress the two Outlanders.</p><p>The two alien heavenly emperors were forced to retreat by Lu Ming.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>One of the alien heavenly emperors was caught off guard and was grazed by Lu Ming’s sharp claws. A large piece of his flesh was torn off, causing him to retreat in fear.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared and swept his claws. The surrounding alien races below the celestial Thearch level were swept by the claw and exploded into</p><p>The ashes dissipated.</p><p>The alien races below the celestial Thearch level were so frightened that they retreated. They did not dare to approach Lu Ming.</p><p>“Trash, all of you are trash!”</p><p>An angry roar came from the passage.</p><p>On the other side of the passage, on the other side of the endless void, was another world. It was the world of the foreign races, the evil god World.</p><p>In a vast and uninhabited area of the evil god tribe, there was an extremely huge formation. The base of this formation had been condensed from the bones of the space-time spirit rat, and it was filled with countless runes.</p><p>At this moment, there were a few alien races standing in the sky.</p><p>These foreign beings looked no different from humans. They had purple hair and a third eye in the middle of their brows.</p><p>This was the Royal clan of the evil god race.</p><p>Behind these few members of the evil god tribe’s royal family was a dense and endless Army of other races.</p><p>Above the huge array was an extremely huge passage. It was several times larger than the vortex where Lu Ming and the rest were.</p><p>At this moment, there were at least a few dozen foreign overlords bombarding the passageway with the power of the formation, trying to open up a gap.</p><p>you must bring back the bloodline of the sacred ancestor bloodheart. Once the sacred ancestor bloodheart is resurrected, our race will be invincible. We can conquer the heaven realm in just a few days!</p><p>One of the evil god tribe’s Royal members said.</p><p>This person had a square face and was filled with dignity, as if he held supreme power.</p><p>that’s right. We must bring back the bloodline of the sacred ancestor bloodheart. It seems that we’ll have to go there personally!</p><p>Beside the dignified royal member were two other Royal members of the evil god tribe. At this moment, one of them spoke.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The dignified Royal in the middle nodded and then said, ” “Continue to increase the number of crystals, regardless of the price!”</p><p>All of a sudden, the non-human race members flew out, and an ocean of crystals flew into the formation. The formation glowed, and its power became even stronger.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The two royal family members rushed out and rushed into the passage.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
