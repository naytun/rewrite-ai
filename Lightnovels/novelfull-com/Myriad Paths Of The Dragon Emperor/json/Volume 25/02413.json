The king of the non-human race and the others thought that Lu Ming was so powerful because of the power of the sacred ancestor bloodheart. They did not know how strong Lu Ming was himself.</p><p>At this moment, they were a little surprised to see Lu Ming displaying his abilities.</p><p>this kid has extraordinary talent. I’m afraid it won’t be easy to subdue him and make him despair!</p><p>that’s right. This kind of person is definitely an overwhelming prodigy in the heaven realm. This kind of person is usually arrogant, supercilious, and extremely confident. It’s difficult to make such a person submit to despair! The other powerhouses also chimed in.</p><p>This was indeed beyond their expectations.</p><p>Their original plan was that if Lu Ming was just an ordinary prodigy, he would definitely be taught a lesson when he walked the evil god Realm.</p><p>By then, a few powerful paragons would be able to suppress Lu Ming. In that case, Lu Ming would easily give in and give in.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was a rare genius. It would not be easy to make such a person despair.</p><p>“If it really doesn’t work out, then I’ll take him to the holy mountain!”</p><p>The non-human King said.</p><p>great, the king is wise. Countless experts of our world have gathered on the holy mountain, including some of the top-ranked figures on the longevity Roll. I believe he’ll give in to the countless experts!</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Moroga and the others all smiled. At the mention of the holy mountain, their eyes flashed with respect.</p><p>Time passed quickly.</p><p>After two hours, a few rays of light broke through the sky from the distance.</p><p>The next moment, a few figures appeared in the sky.</p><p>One of them was mo tianluo.</p><p>There were two other people. One of them was also a non-human King, but he had a head of short purple hair. He looked very energetic and young.</p><p>The other person was a shadow-like alien.</p><p>He didn’t seem to have a physical body. He stood there, but his body was swaying like water.</p><p>“It’s storm and moping!”</p><p>“I didn’t expect storm and Mo ping to be in the capital!”</p><p>mo ping is ranked 98th on the longevity Roll. Storm is ranked 76th!</p><p>hahaha, let’s see how arrogant that human brat can be this time!</p><p>Excited discussions could be heard from the surroundings. It was obvious that they were very confident in the so-called storm and Mo ping.</p><p>From the discussions of the people around him, Lu Ming knew that the Royal with inch-long hair was called mo ping.</p><p>That shadow-like alien race was called storm, and they were both top experts on the evil god world’s Longevity Roll.</p><p>This is the kid who wants to challenge everyone on the longevity Roll? He’s really arrogant!”</p><p>Mo ping coldly spoke, his eyes flashing with sharpness.</p><p>‘Then let’s cripple him and make him lie on the ground like a dog, hehehe!” hehe … Bao Feng laughed in an ear-piercing voice. His shadow-like body swayed.</p><p>“You first, or should I go first?”</p><p>Mo ping asked storm.</p><p>“You do it. In my opinion, you are enough!”</p><p>The ear-piercing sound of the storm rang out again.</p><p>“Alright, then I’ll take on this kid!”</p><p>Mo ping stepped forward, and a violent aura emanated from his body.</p><p>“Three star great emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>Mo ping had cultivated for less than ten thousand years, but he was already a three star great emperor.</p><p>And he was only ranked Ninety-eighth on the longevity Roll.</p><p>“Could it be that the hundred people on the longevity Roll are all three star great emperors or above?”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s heart felt heavy.</p><p>In less than ten thousand years of cultivation, a hundred of them had reached the level of three star great emperor. This was absolutely shocking.</p><p>There was almost no problem for these people to become heavenly emperors in the future. They could even become peerless powerhouses.</p><p>The alien races were indeed powerful. No wonder the heaven realm had been defeated in the ancient war and could only guard the Tai Qing heavenly region.</p><p>no, I can’t be discouraged. No matter how many powerhouses and prodigies the Outlanders have, I’ll suppress them all in the future!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes shone with a bright light and a strong fighting spirit.</p><p>I’m invincible!</p><p>This was Lu Ming’s belief and his confidence in himself.</p><p>No matter how many heaven’s favorites or powerhouses you have, I will suppress them all!</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Mo ping shouted coldly. The third eye between his brows emitted a brilliant light. Then, combat swords flew out of his eye.</p><p>There was a total of eighteen combat swords. They formed a strange pattern and slashed violently at Lu Ming.</p><p>“What a unique attack!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>His opponent had used the destructive light from his third eye to form a sword</p><p>and then formed a wonderful sword formation.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The 18 combat swords formed a magical sword formation. Its power increased exponentially, bursting forth with endless sword Qi that enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s muscles trembled rapidly as he unleashed the six-feathered divine wings.</p><p>Lu Ming now controlled too many laws. He had a total of eighty-one types and seventy-one types of King path laws.</p><p>The six types of laws required for the six-feathered wings were all contained within.</p><p>Not only the six-feathered divine wings, but the 18 types of nomological laws of the indestructible ancient scroll were also contained in it. This caused the power of Lu Ming’s indestructible ancient scroll to increase explosively.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>Lu Ming’s speed was extremely fast. He dodged continuously, avoiding the sword Qi attacks.</p><p>None of the sword aura could hit Lu Ming.</p><p>“Your movement technique is quite fast. Let’s see how you Dodge it!”</p><p>Mo ping said coldly. The light in his third eye grew brighter, and the 18 swords became even faster.</p><p>At the same time, he took a step forward and charged at Lu Ming, throwing a palm strike.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A vortex appeared in his palm, and it exuded a shocking power.</p><p>This force spun wildly, bringing with it a shocking tearing force. It wanted to envelop Lu Ming and tear him into pieces.</p><p>This power could greatly enhance one’s speed and movement technique. When combined with the sword formation formed by the eighteen combat swords, it was simply invincible.</p><p>“Lose!”</p><p>Mo ping coldly shouted, extremely confident.</p><p>He had been able to rank Ninety-eighth on the longevity Roll and defeat two other experts whose cultivation levels were not any lower than his because of this move.</p><p>“I’m too lazy to play with you!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s indifferent voice was heard. Then, Lu Ming struck nineteen palms in a row.</p><p>18 of the palms landed on the 18 combat swords, and the other palm struck mo Ping’s palm.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s strength was so shocking that the eighteen combat swords exploded</p><p>when he slapped them.</p><p>When Lu Ming’s palm collided with mo Ping’s palm, mo Ping’s body trembled as if he had been electrocuted. His eyeballs almost popped out.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The sound of bones breaking rang out. Mo ping let out a blood-curdling scream as his body was sent flying. Just like mo tianluo and bu duo, he crashed heavily onto the ground.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
