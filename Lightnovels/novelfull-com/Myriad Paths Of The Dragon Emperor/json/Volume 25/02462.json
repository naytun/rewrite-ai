One Jade blood grass could burn for ten days.</p><p>They had waited for a full six days.</p><p>Suddenly, there was a red bolt of lightning in the forest in front of them. It shot towards the burning Jade blood grass at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>It was not lightning. Lu Ming could see clearly that it was a blood-red fox. It was very small, less than half a meter long.</p><p>“They’re here!”</p><p>Xu Rong’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>The burly man shouted. Then, more than thirty people pounced on the Jade-</p><p>Blood Fox from all directions, forming an encirclement.</p><p>Squeak…</p><p>The Jade-Blood Fox was frightened and let out a few shrieks. Its four limbs stretched out and it retreated like a bolt of lightning.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>In that direction, a few great emperor realm powerhouses shouted. Their power formed a huge hand that grabbed at the Jade-Blood Fox.</p><p>The Jade Blood Fox charged left and right, but all its escape routes were blocked. There was no way out.</p><p>‘Squeak…’</p><p>The Jade Blood Fox screeched and suddenly leaped. Its body turned into a sword light and rushed over.</p><p>Plop!</p><p>One of the great Emperor’s Hand was pierced through by the Jade-Blood Fox.</p><p>The Fox rushed past it and turned into a bolt of lightning, leaving at top speed.</p><p>“Not good, quickly chase!”</p><p>Xu Rong shouted.</p><p>The other people’s faces were also unsightly.</p><p>This Jade Blood Fox didn’t match the rumors.</p><p>It was rumored that Jade blood foxes were extremely cautious and didn’t have a fixed residence. They came and went without a trace and were extremely fast.</p><p>However, their cultivation wasn’t high and their combat strength wasn t strong. A great emperor was enough to deal with them.</p><p>However, the Jade-Blood Fox was able to transform into a sword beam and break through a great Emperor’s attack. This was something they had not expected.</p><p>They pursued madly, but the Jade-Blood Fox was even faster than them. It was like a red bolt of lightning, rapidly flying into the distance and about to escape.</p><p>This time, the Jade-Blood Fox had been surrounded and was escaping. With its cautious nature, it would be extremely difficult to attract it over.</p><p>Xu Rong was on the verge of tears.</p><p>At this moment, a figure rushed out at an extremely fast speed. It was even faster than the Jade-Blood Fox and disappeared in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“So fast…”</p><p>Xu Rong and the rest were stunned because the person who had rushed out was</p><p>Lu Ming.</p><p>Hope rose in their hearts. They hoped that Lu Ming would be able to catch it.</p><p>They gritted their teeth and gave chase. After a while, they saw Lu Ming stepping on the air in front of them. He was holding a blood-red little fox in his hand and it was struggling non-stop.</p><p>It was the Jade Blood Fox.</p><p>“I caught it, I caught it!”</p><p>Xu Rong jumped up in excitement, and the others were also overjoyed.</p><p>“Miss Xu, I’m glad I didn’t fail you!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and passed the Jade Blood Fox to Xu Rong.</p><p>“Lu Ming, thank you. It’s all thanks to you this time!”</p><p>Xu Rong was so excited that her face turned red. She quickly took the Jade Blood</p><p>Fox and kept it in a Jade bottle.</p><p>Her father was saved, and her face was full of smiles.</p><p>“Lu Ming, where are you going next?”</p><p>Xu Rong asked.</p><p>“To be honest, I was just about to ask. Where is this place?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“You don’t know where we are?”</p><p>Xu Rong was curious.</p><p>I actually came from a distant place. I was chased by someone and I was running for my life. I don’t even know where I am now.</p><p>Lu Ming gave a ‘bitter smile’.</p><p>“This is the ten square Forest of Fengming country. Our Xu family is in Great</p><p>Ming city, which is one of the big cities in Fengming country!”</p><p>Xu Rong said.</p><p>“Great Ming city, country of Feng Ming?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>The ancestral Dragon said that there were tens of thousands of countries in netherworld mountain, and it seemed like it was true.</p><p>“Lu Ming, since you’re not from here, why don’t you return to Great Ming city with us first and then think of a way to go back?”</p><p>Xu Rong said.</p><p>“We can only do this for now!”</p><p>Lu Ming pretended to be helpless and nodded.</p><p>Xu Rong was overjoyed. Then, a group of people appeared and returned to the great Ming city.</p><p>The ten square Forest was not too far from the great Ming city. It was only a million miles away. However, the flying speed here was much slower. It took them a few hours to reach the great Ming city.</p><p>Great Ming city was a majestic city. It was very huge and could be ranked in the top twenty even in the vast country of Fengming.</p><p>On the way, Lu Ming also learned from Xu Rong how her father was injured.</p><p>Her father had challenged a man called mo you and was injured by him.</p><p>As for mo you, he was the guard of a commander in Fengming.</p><p>Along the way, Xu Rong talked a lot to Lu Ming.</p><p>Fengming country advocated martial strength and used martial strength to rule the country.</p><p>Under the Fengming country’s King, there were thirteen commanders. Each of them led a large Army and guarded a region. They were all extremely powerful existences.</p><p>The great Ming city was under the rule of one of the commanders. Under this commander, there were eighteen guards. Mo you was one of the guards under this commander and his combat strength was very strong.</p><p>However, there was a rule in Fengming country. All status was based on strength, and it could be fought for with strength.</p><p>As long as he could defeat his opponent, he would be able to replace his opponent’s position.</p><p>For example, if they defeated or even killed mo you, they could replace him and become the guard of that commander. They would be high and mighty and run amuck in an area.</p><p>my father didn’t covet the position of the other party’s commander and guard. He was forced by mo you to challenge him!</p><p>In the end, Xu Rong sighed.</p><p>“Oh? What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>mo you set up a bet with my big brother and he lost in the end. He’s in debt, and even if I sell the entire Xu family, I can’t pay off those debts!</p><p>Xu Rong sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He roughly understood.</p><p>The group walked through the city gate and headed in the direction of the Xu family.</p><p>“There are so many races?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked the moment he entered the city.</p><p>Within the city, the streets were wide and people were coming and going.</p><p>However, it wasn’t just the human race. There were also other races.</p><p>For example, they had horns on their heads and were of a race similar to humans.</p><p>There were also races that had long tails, and races that had human-shaped upper bodies but snake-like lower bodies.</p><p>These races were definitely not formed by the divine beasts, but were born like this.</p><p>Lu Ming looked around and saw at least four to five races.</p><p>These races did not exist in the heaven realm, primordial realm, or evil god Realm.</p><p>the ancestral Dragon said that netherworld mountain came from beyond the heavens. Could these be the races from beyond the heavens? ”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>Then, he thought of the statue at the core of the void God Island.</p><p>That statue had a pair of wings on its back. It was also a race that had never been seen before. Was there any connection between all these?</p><p>However, Lu Ming realized that the number of humans was the highest.</p><p>After passing through a few streets, a huge mansion appeared in front of them. This mansion was the Xu family.</p><p>However, at this moment, the Xu family’s residence was surrounded by people.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>The faces of Xu Rong and the others changed, and they rushed over.</p><p>“It’s Xu Rong!”</p><p>Many people saw Xu Rong and quickly made way for her.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
