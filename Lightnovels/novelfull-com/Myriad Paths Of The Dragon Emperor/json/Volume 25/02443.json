The bloodline of the sacred ancestor bloodheart would be a great threat in the future if it fell into the hands of the non-human sacred ancestor.</p><p>However, it had already fallen into the hands of the non-human divine ancestor, so it was impossible to completely obliterate the divine ancestor bloodheart.</p><p>In a flash, the ancestral Dragon entered the prison-suppressing formation.</p><p>I’ll let you off today. It won’t take long for the prison suppression field and the heaven realm to be destroyed. I’ll definitely succeed in opening the sky. All of you stubborn people will die!</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor’s cold voice rang out as he ordered the non- human race to retreat.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Countless alien races rose into the air and disappeared without a trace.</p><p>The non-human race’s divine ancestor cast a cold glance at Lu Ming, then took a step forward and disappeared.</p><p>The great battle ended just like that.</p><p>“Thank you for saving me, senior ancestral Dragon!”</p><p>“Junior pays his respects to senior!”</p><p>Qing Cang, elder Liu, and the others flew over and saluted the ancestral Dragon. It was said that the ancestral Dragon was the ancestor of all the true dragons in the world. His seniority was too high, and he had lived for countless years. No one knew how the ancestral Dragon appeared or how long he had lived. “Rise!”</p><p>Zu long transformed into a human form. He was a burly old man. He waved his hand casually and appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>He sized Lu Ming up carefully.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was trying his best to recover. Just now, he had used up too much energy to resist the third bloodline. His World Energy was about to be exhausted.</p><p>In the end, he managed to withstand it. The energy from the outside world continued to pour into Lu Ming’s body. Lu Ming’s world Energy was recovering rapidly.</p><p>A moment later, Lu Ming heaved a long sigh of relief and closed the door.</p><p>“The third bloodline has finally left!”</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely relaxed.</p><p>The third bloodline was a time bomb that constantly threatened Lu Ming’s safety. Although it could be of help to Lu Ming sometimes, he would rather not have it.</p><p>Now that the third bloodline, the bloodline of the sacred ancestor bloodline, had left, Lu Ming felt relaxed as if a huge stone that had been weighing on his heart for many years had been lifted.</p><p>Lu Ming saw the ancestor Dragon the moment he opened his eyes.</p><p>Although the ancestral Dragon had transformed into a human, his aura remained the same. Lu Ming quickly stood up and cupped his fists in greeting.”Junior Lu Ming greets senior ancestral Dragon!”</p><p>“Haha, no need to be so polite!”</p><p>Zu long laughed heartily. He was all smiles when he looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>I didn’t expect this. I really didn’t expect that there would be someone in this world who could control this kind of power. The power of a ruler…</p><p>Zu long sighed.</p><p>“All?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>When the ancestral Dragon mentioned the power of a master, he was obviously referring to the power that Lu Ming controlled.</p><p>However, the name of this power was casually given by Lu Ming. Could it be that he had chosen the right name?</p><p>“Senior, you know about this power?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>“I do know, but this kind of power is too little. Even if it’s there … I’m not too sure about the specifics!”</p><p>Zu long said. He then looked at Lu Ming. “You have to cultivate well. If you keep going, you might be able to break through the limit and step into the Supreme realm!”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Then, zu long looked at elder Liu and the others from the prison suppression field and said, ” it’s not a good idea for you to stay in the evil god Realm for a long time. Instead, it will give the alien tribes an opportunity to attack you one by one. Why don’t you come with me to the heaven realm? only when we join forces will we have the power to fight against the alien tribes!</p><p>senior, we also want to go to the heaven realm, but there are too many people in the prison suppression field. We can’t take them there!</p><p>that’s right. Although a peak heavenly Emperor doesn’t need a space passage and can directly tear space, cross the long void, and enter other worlds, he can only move alone and can’t bring anyone with him!</p><p>even if there’s an Eden treasure, it will be ground to pieces when crossing the long void!</p><p>The elders from the prison suppression field all spoke.</p><p>They were naturally willing to go to the heaven realm and join forces with the experts of the heaven realm.</p><p>However, even if a peak heavenly Emperor could directly step into the endless void and enter another realm, he could not bring anyone with him.</p><p>Even the lower grade monarch weapons could not be brought along as they would be torn apart by the void storm during the long journey in the void.</p><p>As such, even if one were to use an Eden treasure to store a person, it would be useless. Similarly, it would be useless to cultivate a small world.</p><p>it turns out that a peak heavenly Emperor can directly cross the long void and enter another realm from one realm!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>He thought of the time when he was captured by mo Luojia. At that time, mo</p><p>Luojia had passed through the void and captured him.</p><p>Mo Luojia was a peak heavenly Emperor.</p><p>I understand. It didn’t work in the past, but that doesn’t mean it won’t work now!</p><p>Zu long smiled and explained, ” now, the nine prison-guarding steles are gathered. As long as we control them, we can form a prison-guarding space. It can hold an endless number of people. With the level of the prison-guarding stele, we can stop them even if they cross the long void!</p><p>“Really, that’s great!”</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>The people from the prison suppression field were all overjoyed.</p><p>I used to be an old friend of the prison-guarding stele, and I know some ways to control it. Let’s do it now!</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>Then, the ancestral Dragon exuded a powerful aura and his hands quickly formed a seal.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The nine prison-guarding steles of the prison-guarding world started to shake and then slowly floated in the air. The nine prison-guarding steles resonated with each other and created a space.</p><p>The prison suppression space had the same meaning as a Grotto-heaven treasure.</p><p>“In!”</p><p>go! zu long shouted and a strong force was generated. All the people in the prison suppression field flew into the prison suppression space.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming, Qing Cang, elder Liu, and the rest also entered the prison suppression space.</p><p>The prison suppression space was also a world of its own. It was vast and had Endless Mountains.</p><p>“We didn’t notice it before!”</p><p>Elder Liu and the others were overjoyed. They began to arrange for the endless population of the prison suppression field to live here.</p><p>The ancestral Dragon put away the nine prison-guarding steles and stepped out. The space cracked and he went through the void toward the heaven realm.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, the ancestral Dragon’s figure appeared in the prison suppression space.</p><p>“We’ve already reached the heaven realm!”</p><p>Zu long smiled.</p><p>“So fast!”</p><p>Everyone was overjoyed, but at the same time, they were shocked. The strength of the ancestral Dragon was truly unfathomable. He had returned to the heaven realm from the evil god Realm so quickly.</p><p>“Come with me!”</p><p>Zu long waved his hand, and Lu Ming, Qing Cang, Liu changlai, and the others disappeared. The next moment, they appeared in the sky.</p><p>Standing high in the sky and looking down, they found that there was a huge mountain under their feet. There were many buildings built on the mountain. Around the mountain, there were huge cities.</p><p>“So many experts!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked to discover that this huge mountain was emitting a terrifying aura. Some of them were at the heavenly Emperor realm, while others were at the great emperor realm. The number was astonishing.</p><p>Although it wasn’t as many as the Outlander sacred mountain, it wasn’t much worse.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
