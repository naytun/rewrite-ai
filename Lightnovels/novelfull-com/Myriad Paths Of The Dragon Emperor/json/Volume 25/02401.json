Dandan, bubbles, Earth One, and Thunder one were also greatly shocked and had looks of disbelief on their faces.</p><p>From the information in the crystal Pagoda, they learned that the alien race was going to open a huge passage to the primordial realm.</p><p>Yes, this plan had been going on for many years.</p><p>A picture emerged from the crystal Pagoda.</p><p>In this picture, there was an unknown area where countless foreign races gathered. They were setting up a large array, and the foundation of this large array was a pile of white bones.</p><p>With these bones as the foundation, a huge passage was opened.</p><p>“Chirp, chirp, chirp…”</p><p>Upon seeing this picture, bubbles kept on crying out, appearing to be very sad, angry, and anxious.</p><p>the bone banner of the space-time spirit rat. Damn it, the last generation of the space-time spirit rat’s bone banner was obtained by a foreign tribe and used to open a passage!</p><p>Dandan also let out an angry roar.</p><p>The bone insect of the time and space spirit mouse!</p><p>Lu Ming understood everything!</p><p>It seemed that the body of the previous generation’s space-time spirit rat had fallen into the hands of a foreign race.</p><p>The space-time spirit mouse could control space-time. It had reached an extreme level in the use of space-time. Every drop of blood and every strand of hair on its body was related to space-time.</p><p>It was indeed possible for the alien races to open a huge and stable passage in the boundless void with the bone banner of the space-time spirit rats, which could allow a large number of alien races to pass through.</p><p>The destination of this passage was the primordial realm.</p><p>“Where is it?”</p><p>Lu Ming grew anxious and continued to read the information in the crystal Pagoda. Not long after, they made a discovery.</p><p>On a huge island, the figures of Men in Black flickered. In the sky, there was a huge vortex.</p><p>It was obvious that the people of the death god nation were working with the evil god tribe to open a passage in the primordial realm.</p><p>“It’s overseas!”</p><p>Not long after, they finally arrived at the specific location.</p><p>It was not in the yuan continent but overseas.</p><p>This crystal Pagoda actually hid such a secret. No wonder that foreign race wanted to destroy it even when he was dying.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were secretly afraid!</p><p>If the alien races opened this passage, the Army would invade, and the primordial realm would be finished.</p><p>Once the primordial realm was over, the taiqing heavenly region would also be in danger.</p><p>They only stopped after carefully examining the information in the crystal Pagoda.</p><p>let’s go. We’ll kill the people of the death god nation first, and then inform the experts of the heaven realm. Let the heaven realm send people to guard there!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with cold murderous intent.</p><p>He was secretly afraid. Fortunately, they had discovered him. Otherwise, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p><p>“Kill, we must kill them, chirp chirp!”</p><p>Bubbles cried out as well, dancing with joy and a fierce look on her face.</p><p>The previous generation’s space-time spirit mouse was equivalent to bubble’s mother. But now, after its death, its bones were being used for this kind of torture. It would be strange if she wasn’t filled with killing intent.</p><p>After the plan was made, they immediately left and flew North.</p><p>According to the information they had obtained, the destination of the foreign tribe’s passageway was the endless sea in the North of the yuan continent.</p><p>That place, like the divine wilderness continent, was called the barren land. However, that place was not as remote as the divine wilderness continent, nor was it as far away from the yuan continent as the divine wilderness continent. Earth One and Thunder one brought Lu Ming, dandan, and bubbles and rushed towards the North of the yuan continent.</p><p>With their heavenly Emperor realm cultivation, their speed was too fast. Not long after, they left the yuan continent and came to the boundless sea.</p><p>They followed the sea and headed north.</p><p>Two days later, they finally neared their destination.</p><p>In front of them was an incomparably huge island.</p><p>Rather than calling it an Island, it could be said that it was a continent. A continent that was similar to the divine wilderness continent, but its surface area was even larger than the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>However, compared to the yuan continent, it was like an Island.</p><p>In the sky above the island, a huge vortex was suspended there, covering the entire Island.</p><p>From this, it could be seen just how huge this passageway would be once it was opened. In an instant, countless evil god tribe members would be able to flood in.</p><p>From a distance, they could see many black shadows flashing on the island. They were all assassins from the death god nation.</p><p>from the looks of it, that passageway should not have been opened yet. The death god nation is working with the evil god tribe to open the passageway as soon as possible!</p><p>Dandan said in a low voice.</p><p>let’s attack. We’ll kill the people of the death god nation first, and then destroy the great formation here!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The others all nodded.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>They moved. They didn’t hide their figures anymore and rushed toward the island. In a few breaths, they were close to the island.</p><p>“There’s someone!”</p><p>“Not good, I’ve been discovered!”</p><p>“Kill them!”</p><p>More than a thousand Men in Black Rose into the sky from the island and launched an attack on Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Thousands of sword gleams shot toward Lu Ming and the rest from all directions like raindrops.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>die! Lei Yi shouted coldly and struck out with his palm. Endless Thunderbolts formed in the air like a spider web and rushed towards the black-clothed men. Those Men in Black couldn’t resist at all and were killed immediately. From a distance, thousands of Men in Black fell to the ground like thousands of mosquitoes.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly and dashed into the island.</p><p>This Island was really huge, as big as a continent.</p><p>There were countless assassins from the death god nation on this Island, and it was obvious that all the other creatures on this Island had been killed by them. As Lu Ming and the group went deeper, Men in Black rushed out from all over the island.</p><p>humans of the primordial realm, kill!</p><p>All of a sudden, a series of loud roars rang out. From the depths of the island, a group of burly figures rushed toward Lu Ming and the rest. Their auras were extremely shocking.</p><p>Great emperor!</p><p>There were at least a few dozen great emperors charging toward them. The most shocking thing was that these great emperors were all from the evil god race.</p><p>How could there be so many evil god tribesmen in the primordial realm? not good! It’s very likely that the passageway has already been slightly torn apart. That’s why some of the evil god tribe members have entered! Dandan’s expression changed and became extremely serious.</p><p>If that was the case, then the passageway was not far from being completely opened.</p><p>In an instant, the members of the evil god race had already charged over.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The great desolation spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hand. With a shake of the great desolation spear, rays of spear light flew out and killed a few great emperor-level foreign tribe cultivators.</p><p>At the same time, Earth One and the rest also made their move.</p><p>With the two heavenly monarchs attacking, great sovereigns were no match for them and were constantly killed.</p><p>However, from the depths of the island, more and more figures flew out. They were all from the evil god race, and there were so many of them that it was shocking. From their auras, there were actually more than a hundred great emperor realm experts.</p><p>The number was still increasing, and there were quite a few peak great emperors.</p><p>“No matter how many come, kill them all!”</p><p>Earth one’s eyes were filled with killing intent. The meteor hammer appeared in his hand and gave off a terrifying aura.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The meteoric hammer suddenly blasted out, like a planet smashing forward..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
