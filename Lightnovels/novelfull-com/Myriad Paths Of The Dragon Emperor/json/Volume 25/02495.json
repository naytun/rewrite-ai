After that, they left.</p><p>Initially, Lu Ming had planned to take down the first Prince and gather some information. However, he had changed his mind and decided to wait for another three days.</p><p>Naturally, he had his eyes on the life-or-death pill.</p><p>After the first Prince and Ou Xing left, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing waited in the courtyard.</p><p>Three days passed in the blink of an eye!</p><p>Three days later, when night fell, the first Prince had been waiting for him.</p><p>In the middle of the night, a figure stepped through the air. It was Ou Xing.</p><p>“Xing ‘er, have you brought the life-or-death pill?”</p><p>The first Prince quickly asked.</p><p>“I did, but I have to put it back quickly. If my father finds out, it won’t be good!”</p><p>Ou Xing said.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I’m just going to take a look to broaden my horizons!”</p><p>The first Prince said with a smile.</p><p>Ou Xing nodded. With a wave of her hand, a Jade bottle with some inscriptions on it appeared in her palm.</p><p>Ou Xing’s fingers waved, and runes flew toward the Jade bottle. Then, the Jade bottle began to emit light, and the light only dimmed down after a while.</p><p>“Alright, I’m done!”</p><p>Ou Xing smiled and passed the Jade bottle to the first Prince.</p><p>The first Prince quickly took it and poured out a pill.</p><p>A milky white pill the size of a pigeon’s egg exuded a strong medicinal fragrance. Even Lu Ming and Xie nianqing, who were hiding in the void, could smell it.</p><p>“Is this the life-or-death pill?”</p><p>The first Prince murmured as he lowered his head and looked at her carefully. His eyes were filled with intense greed.</p><p>After examining it for a while, the first Prince put the life-or-death pill back into the Jade bottle and handed it over to Ou Xing. He smiled and said,”Xing ‘er, I’ve taken a good look. I’ll return it to you!”</p><p>“Yes, I’ll return it now!”</p><p>Ou Xing smiled and reached out to take it.</p><p>However, at this moment, the first Prince’s palm glowed like a battle sword. It struck towards Ou Xing’s dantian at lightning speed.</p><p>At such a close distance, coupled with the first Prince’s sneak attack, ordinary people would not be able to avoid it.</p><p>However, at the moment when the first Prince attacked, Ou Xing’s body began to glow. A resplendent radiance spread out and turned into a battle armor that covered her entire body. At the same time, Ou Xing retreated rapidly.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The first Prince’s palm energy struck Ou Xing’s armor, but it was easily dissipated by the armor.</p><p>Ou Xing retreated a hundred meters and stood on the surface of the lake. Her face was extremely ugly.</p><p>first, why, why? ”</p><p>Ou Xing roared, her face filled with disappointment.</p><p>“So you’ve been on guard Against Me!”</p><p>The first Prince’s face was gloomy as he said coldly. He then raised the Jade bottle in his hand and sneered, ” the life-or-death pill can heal any injury below the divine Spirit realm, no matter how severe it is. Each pill is equivalent to a life. Only by following me can such a peerless pill display its true value. Do you understand? ”</p><p>“You said that you will stay in the yellow Springs world and accompany me for the rest of your life. Was that all a lie?”</p><p>Ou Xing asked.</p><p>“Nonsense, I still have important things to do, why would I stay in this place? This place is just a cursed place!”</p><p>The first Prince sneered.</p><p>“Sigh, I was too naive!”</p><p>Ou Xing sighed, and her disappointment became even stronger.</p><p>I was going to give you a chance. If you didn’t do it today, I would have treated you with all my heart. I could even ask my father to give you a life-or-death pill. Unfortunately, you’ve disappointed me!</p><p>After saying that, a cold killing intent suddenly burst out from Ou Xing’s eyes and she waved her hand.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>The space behind Ou Xing suddenly split open, and two figures appeared.</p><p>They were two old men in Black robes, exuding a terrifying aura.</p><p>They were two heavenly Emperor realm powerhouses, one three star heavenly Emperor and one two star heavenly Emperor.</p><p>The first Prince’s face darkened when he saw the two of them. He said, ” b * tch, not only have you been guarding against me, but you’ve also secretly brought people here. Are you trying to kill me? ”</p><p>originally, I brought them here just in case. If you didn’t do anything, they wouldn’t have appeared. Unfortunately, you’ve disappointed me. Give me the life-or-death pill and I’ll leave your corpse intact!</p><p>Ou Xing coldly said.</p><p>“Hahaha, b * tch, you think I’m not prepared? I’ve been prepared for this. You don’t trust me, and I’ve never trusted you. Come out!”</p><p>The first Prince waved his hand.</p><p>The void trembled, and figures appeared in the surrounding space.</p><p>There were a total of six people, all of whom were from the evil god tribe. Moreover, all of them were heavenly Emperor-level powerhouses. There were even two four-star heavenly Emperor-level peerless powerhouses.</p><p>Seeing these people, Ou Xing’s pretty face turned pale.</p><p>first, I’m just joking with you. For the sake of our relationship, please let me go!</p><p>On Ou Xing’s face, an ugly smile appeared.</p><p>“Let you go? I don’t want to be enemies with your ou clan. Although your ou clan doesn’t have a martial God and I’m not afraid of you, it’s still a problem. You can go in peace. I’ll do my best with these three life-or-death pills. Do it!”</p><p>The first Prince laughed coldly. His voice was ice-cold as he gave the order.</p><p>“Young miss, quickly leave!”</p><p>Behind Ou Xing, two old men took her and charged in one direction.</p><p>However, the six members of the evil god race had also made their move. They sealed off the sky and earth, surrounding the three of them and unleashing terrifying attacks.</p><p>The difference in strength between the two sides was too great. The two old men that Ou Xing brought were not his opponents at all. As soon as they made a move, they were blown up.</p><p>number one dog thief, you’ll die a terrible death, you’ll die a terrible death …</p><p>Ou Xing crazily cursed.</p><p>However, in the next moment, she was struck by the attacks of several celestial emperors and instantly turned into ashes, her body and soul destroyed.</p><p>In the air, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were speechless.</p><p>However, this was equivalent to a dog-eat-dog fight. Before this, the two of them naturally wouldn’t make a move.</p><p>After killing Ou Xing and the two experts of the OU family, the first Prince was overjoyed. He took out the Jade bottle again and poured out three pills.</p><p>All of them were life-or-death pills, and the medicinal fragrance was extremely rich.</p><p>hahaha, what a great harvest! Let’s go, let’s quickly leave this place!</p><p>The first Prince laughed out loud. He then kept the Jade bottle and turned around to leave.</p><p>However, after flying for a while, he realized that the six members of the evil god race were still standing in the air, not moving at all.</p><p>“I told you to leave, didn’t you hear me?”</p><p>The first Prince turned around and said impatiently.</p><p>However, the moment he turned around, his eyes widened.</p><p>It was because the six demonic humans seemed to be frozen in the air. They couldn’t move at all, and only their faces revealed a frightened expression.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>The first Prince’s hair stood on end. He shouted and quickly turned around to check.</p><p>“Aren’t we welcome, old friends?”</p><p>A chuckle was heard and the space cracked open. Lu Ming and Xie nianqing walked out.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Lu Ming, why are you here? How did you enter this place?”</p><p>The first Prince’s eyes widened as he roared in disbelief.</p><p>The gate of the yellow Springs Empire’s imperial capital was engraved with a formation that could detect the aura of the heaven realm. The creatures of the heaven realm couldn’t enter the imperial capital at all.</p><p>The first Prince did not expect to meet Lu Ming here.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
