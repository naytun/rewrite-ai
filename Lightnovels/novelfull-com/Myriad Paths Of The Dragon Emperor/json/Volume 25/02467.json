It seemed that Yi Yang had called them over for the commander’s assembly.</p><p>Lu Ming did not say anything and waited for Yi Yang to continue.</p><p>the rules of the commanders ‘assembly are very simple. Every commander can bring three guards with them to participate. At that time, they will challenge each other, and the king will re-rank them according to their battle results! the three of you are the strongest among my guards. Therefore, you will be coming with me to the capital to participate in the commanders ‘meeting! Yi Yang announced.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Lu Ming, Bleu, and Liao min nodded.</p><p>“The capital?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>He also wanted to go to the capital because there was a cursed land in the capital of Fengming. This was exactly what he wanted.</p><p>alright, get ready. We’ll leave tomorrow!</p><p>Yi Yang said.</p><p>The crowd dispersed, and the day passed quickly.</p><p>The next day, Yi Yang brought Lu Ming and the other two people, as well as other guards, to the capital of Fengming country on a huge bird.</p><p>After flying for three days, they arrived at the capital of the country of Feng Ming. It was a huge and vast ancient city.</p><p>The capital of Fengming country was bustling with activity. Lu Ming saw even more races.</p><p>“It’s commander Yi Yang!”</p><p>The moment they entered the capital, they were immediately recognized, the commanders ‘meeting that happens once every hundred years is coming. The capital is going to be lively again!</p><p>I wonder if there will be any changes to the ranking of the various commanders this time!</p><p>it’s hard to say. In my opinion, the most suspenseful thing is still the battle between the first and second place. A hundred years ago, the two commanders fought for a thousand moves before the winner was decided!</p><p>“Not bad, I’m looking forward to it!”</p><p>While the crowd was discussing, Lu Ming and the rest passed through a few streets and arrived at a huge mansion.</p><p>This mansion was the mansion that Yi Yang ruled in the capital. It was also huge and there were many experts stationed in the mansion.</p><p>As soon as Yi Yang and the others arrived, someone came to welcome them and arranged their accommodation.</p><p>The next thing to do was to wait for the General Assembly to begin.</p><p>Time flew by quickly, and more than ten days passed in the blink of an eye. The General Assembly had arrived.</p><p>Yi Yang brought Lu Ming, bin bu, and Liao min to the palace.</p><p>When they arrived at the Imperial Palace, there were naturally people to receive them. They were welcomed to a wide area.</p><p>This area was surrounded by rows of seats as a viewing platform. In the center, there was a huge fighting stage.</p><p>It was obvious that the duel would be held on that fighting ring.</p><p>“Haha, Yi Yang, you’re early!”</p><p>A loud laugh was heard.</p><p>Everyone looked in the direction of the sound and saw four people flying over from another direction.</p><p>The one in the lead was an old man with a horn on his forehead. He looked at Yi Yang with a cold smile.</p><p>“You’re not too late either!”</p><p>Yi Yang said coldly.</p><p>hehe, Yi Yang, this time, I will definitely take your place!</p><p>The old man sneered.</p><p>“You?You’re still far from it!”</p><p>Yi Yang sneered and confronted each other. Cold auras emanated from both of them as they collided in the air.</p><p>Of course, they understood that now was not the time to fight. They all snorted coldly and found their seats on the stands.</p><p>that old man is called the commander of border city. He’s ranked 10th among the 13 commanders, while our commander is ranked 9th. That guy has always wanted to replace our commander’s position!</p><p>Liao min explained to Lu Ming via voice transmission.</p><p>Along the way, Liao min was closer to Lu Ming. She frequently expressed her goodwill to Lu Ming and looked at him with flirtatious eyes.</p><p>This caused Bleu, who was standing at the side, to feel extremely jealous.</p><p>“Oh, no wonder!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and smiled at Liao min.</p><p>At this moment, people kept flying over.</p><p>All of them were commanders, with each of them leading three guards.</p><p>Liao min also introduced them to Lu Ming.</p><p>it’s Luo mo Tong and commander Yu Zhan. The two of them are here together!</p><p>Suddenly, Liao min spoke in a serious tone.</p><p>Lu Ming also looked over.</p><p>The two sides had four people each.</p><p>The most eye-catching ones were naturally the two people walking in front.</p><p>One of them was a middle-aged man in a white robe. He was a human.</p><p>The other one had a pair of black wings on his back, and his eyes were cold.</p><p>Through Liao min’s introduction, Lu Ming learned that the middle-aged man in the White robe was commander Yu Zhan, who ranked first among the thirteen commanders.</p><p>The one with the black wings was the second-ranked commander Rama.</p><p>These two were extremely powerful and had been fighting each other for countless years.</p><p>The strength of the two of them was about the same, but overall, Yu Zhan’s commander was slightly better, so he was always ranked first.</p><p>There were rumors that this time, commander luomo wanted to pull down commander Yu Zhan’s throne and replace him.</p><p>Their gazes met, creating intense sparks as they sat down in their seats.</p><p>“These two people have deep cultivation!”</p><p>Lu Ming sized up the other party and realized that their cultivation was very profound. They were probably far above Yi Yang.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming sized up the guards that the other party had brought.</p><p>“Heavenly Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming realized that among the guards that the two of them had brought, there were also heavenly Emperor-level existences. Yi Yang, the commander of the border city, and the others could not compare to them at all.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming saw that among the people brought by commander Rama, there was a very mysterious person. He was covered in a black robe and his appearance could not be seen clearly!</p><p>I don’t see any heaven realm experts or foreign races!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>“The country ruler has arrived!”</p><p>At this moment, a voice was heard.</p><p>Then, a group of people flew over from the distance.</p><p>There were more than 100 people, and the leader was a human in his 50s. He wore a crown and had a majestic aura.</p><p>Obviously, this person was the king of Fengming country.</p><p>The group of people landed on the seats at the head of the table and sat down in succession.</p><p>“Greetings, King!”</p><p>Everyone stood up and saluted the king of Fengming.</p><p>“Everyone, please rise and take a seat!”</p><p>The king of Feng Ming country waved his hand.</p><p>Everyone took their seats.</p><p>“The commanders” meeting that happens once every hundred years is about to begin again. The rules are the same as before. Everyone will bring three guards and the last commander will start the challenge!”</p><p>just do whatever you want. This King knows what the final battle result is!</p><p>The country ruler announced.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Everyone responded.</p><p>Then, the last-ranked commander sent out a guard and jumped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>His opponent was a guard of the twelfth-ranked commander.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There was nothing to say, and the two of them began to fight fiercely.</p><p>Both of them were peak great emperors, and their battle power was similar. The battle was very intense, and they exchanged a few hundred moves. In the end, both of them were injured, and it ended in a draw.</p><p>“How is it? Do you have the confidence?”</p><p>Commander Yi Yang secretly sent a message to Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>this kind of trash can’t even withstand a single blow. I can defeat him in ten moves!</p><p>Bleu said, full of confidence.</p><p>However, after taking a look at Lu Ming, his face turned gloomy again. He had been defeated by Lu Ming in one move.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and did not say much.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
