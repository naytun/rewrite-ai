Of course, the most shocking thing was the energy he cultivated. It was like the energy of the ancient cultivation system, indestructible.</p><p>“There are very few people below the celestial Thearch level who can take my punch without being injured. Your strength is not bad, no wonder you could defeat Kang duo!”</p><p>The first Prince spoke, but his voice was still indifferent, high and mighty, and filled with endless confidence.</p><p>However, some of the heavenly Emperor powerhouses around them were shocked.</p><p>They were not shocked by the first Prince’s combat strength, but by Lu Ming.</p><p>This was because Lu Ming did not cast any laws just now. Instead, he used his physical body.</p><p>He had blocked the first Prince’s attack with his physical body alone. It was too shocking. They had seen Lu Ming’s moves before. His physical strength was not that strong before this.</p><p>could it be that he had hidden his strength before, or that he had a breakthrough this month? ”</p><p>Many of the alien races had the same thought.</p><p>first Prince, be careful!</p><p>A non-human heavenly Emperor warned.</p><p>“You’re underestimating me!”</p><p>The first Prince looked at this person, his golden eyes emitting a cold light.</p><p>The heavenly Emperor’s expression changed, and he quickly said, ” “No, I wouldn’t dare to underestimate the Prince…”</p><p>“It’s fine as long as you don’t. I can easily suppress a human brat!”</p><p>The first Prince said indifferently. He looked at Lu Ming and took a step forward, charging at him again.</p><p>He still had one hand behind his back and was only using one hand!</p><p>The power of this punch was stronger than before.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with fighting spirit. There were more than a dozen different kinds of radiances emanating from his body.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With the law’s blessing, Lu Ming’s combat strength was even stronger. He threw another punch.</p><p>There was another violent explosion!</p><p>This time, Lu Ming did not retreat. He successfully blocked the first Prince’s attack.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>The first Prince was taken aback. He was clearly surprised that Lu Ming did not retreat after being punched.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>However, the first Prince was only stunned for a moment. He did not stop. He turned his fist into a palm and slashed at Lu Ming with his palm like a knife.</p><p>Lu Ming’s reaction was very fast. He waved his palm to block.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The two of them were as fast as lightning. In an instant, they had exchanged dozens of moves and then retreated.</p><p>“This is your strength? It’s not much!”</p><p>Lu Ming chuckled.</p><p>The first Prince’s golden eyes turned cold.</p><p>Lu Ming’s ability had indeed exceeded his expectations.</p><p>In the past, unless one’s cultivation base was higher than his, he would usually single-handedly take care of a battle between two people of the same level.</p><p>Even Kang duo, who was ranked second on the longevity Roll, couldn’t force him to use a second hand.</p><p>However, he could not deal with Lu Ming now.</p><p>“You do have some strength, but in front of me, you’re still far from it!”</p><p>The first Prince said coldly. He finally extended his other hand.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The first Prince dashed toward Lu Ming like a beam of light, unleashing a terrifying attack.</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and various laws emanated from his body.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The two of them once again charged at each other, engaging in an intense battle.</p><p>The battle this time was more intense and terrifying than the battle between Lu Ming and Kang duo.</p><p>how is this Lu Ming so powerful? how is this possible? ”</p><p>“Could it be that he didn’t use his full strength in the previous battle with Condor?”</p><p>Many alien races were shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming’s abilities seemed to be limitless. If they were stronger, Lu Ming’s abilities would be stronger too. There was no end to it.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming and Prince Di Yi had exchanged hundreds of moves.</p><p>“Exterminate, kill!”</p><p>The first Prince let out a long howl. His third eye burst out with golden light, which was like a divine sword that slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>When the two worked together, the offensive was even stronger.</p><p>However, the number of laws on Lu Ming’s body increased. At this moment, Lu Ming had already released 49 laws.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two of them exchanged another blow and both retreated.</p><p>“If that’s all you’ve got, then lose!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. The number of laws on his body increased, and his aura grew stronger. In the end, 81 types of laws covered his body, and Lu Ming’s aura rose to its peak.</p><p>This made all the foreign kinds ‘faces turn extremely ugly.</p><p>Could it be that the first Prince was going to be defeated?</p><p>No, it can’t be!</p><p>Many alien races shook their heads crazily.</p><p>you’re the first person in hundreds of years to force me to this extent. I’ll let you have a taste of my ultimate strength!</p><p>“Supreme… Descend!”</p><p>The first Prince let out a long howl. His third eye burst out with an extremely dazzling radiance. The Golden radiance was even more dazzling than the sun.</p><p>Then, a figure appeared in the third eye of the first Prince. The figure stepped out of the third eye.</p><p>It was a burly figure, but he was shrouded in a golden light. His appearance could not be seen clearly, but the aura he gave off was extremely terrifying.</p><p>“Divine ancestor… The aura of the Holy ancestor!”</p><p>the sacred ancestor has descended. No, it’s the power of the sacred ancestor!</p><p>the first Prince’s bloodline is the closest to the Holy ancestor’s. He can already borrow a trace of the Holy ancestor’s power!</p><p>Many of the alien races started to shout.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The first Prince bellowed. The figure stepped out and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned serious. He could sense danger and pressure from this figure.</p><p>But he was not afraid!</p><p>This was only the first Prince’s power. It couldn’t be the non-human divine ancestor himself.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming used all his strength and charged forward, engaging in an intense battle with the figure.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them fought intensely. In the blink of an eye, dozens of moves had passed, and they were evenly matched.</p><p>“Fuse with my body!”</p><p>The first Prince once again yelled out, and the figure retreated, turning into a ray of light that fused into the first Prince’s body, causing the first Prince’s aura to greatly increase.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The first Prince charged toward Lu Ming. The two of them engaged in a fierce battle again.</p><p>The void crumbled, and the space within a radius of hundreds of thousands of miles was in chaos, sweeping up endless spatial storms.</p><p>The power of the battle between the two was too strong. It could destroy the world.</p><p>terrifying, this is too terrifying!</p><p>“Is this still the great emperor? A great emperor can actually have such battle prowess?”</p><p>heavens, this is a battle between the heavenly emperors!</p><p>the two of them fought to the extreme, and the power they unleashed far exceeded that of ordinary peak great emperors.</p><p>Other peak emperors would probably be killed in one move.</p><p>The power that the two of them displayed had far exceeded the level of great emperors.</p><p>It was a battle of the peak, a true battle of the peak.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Towards the end of the battle, the two of them fought madly, clashing madly and getting hit continuously.</p><p>The two of them were hit, but they didn’t care and continued to fight.</p><p>Lu Ming had the indestructible ancient scroll. Although he was hit, he could recover quickly.</p><p>The first Prince was also very terrifying. In such a state, his recovery ability was also astonishing.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
