There were all kinds of creatures living in it, forming countries. There were even martial God Realm experts.</p><p>This was too unbelievable. Netherworld mountain was a completely different heaven realm or evil god Realm!</p><p>however, there’s one thing you can rest assured about. No living being in netherworld mountain, no matter how powerful they are, even the martial God, can never come out!</p><p>it’s said that the people in netherworld mountain have been cursed and will be trapped in the mountain forever for generations. Even the cursed creatures can’t enter some places in netherworld mountain. Only the creatures who are not cursed can enter. So, this is our chance!</p><p>The ancestral Dragon continued, and all kinds of thoughts ran through everyone’s mind.</p><p>therefore, although there will be great opportunities in netherworld mountain, it will also be very dangerous. If we go in, not only will we have to face and kill the alien tribes, but we might also have to kill the living creatures in netherworld mountain. Therefore, I will not force you. If you want to leave, you can leave now!</p><p>The ancestral Dragon’s voice reverberated throughout the area, but no one left.</p><p>According to the ancestral Dragon, netherworld mountain came from beyond the sky. It was extremely mysterious and had many treasures. Even martial gods had their eyes on it. Even the ancestral Dragon had never entered it. The myriad tribulation only opened once, so there must be a great opportunity. Although it would be accompanied by danger, when had there been no danger in cultivation?</p><p>Even if they didn’t go in, when the alien race’s martial God recovered and came to the heaven realm, they would still die. It was better to go in and take a risk. “Alright, since that’s the case, we’ll go in!”</p><p>Zu long announced.</p><p>They couldn’t bring too many people in. Otherwise, they would be finished if the alien races attacked them.</p><p>He believed that the foreign races were the same. They didn’t dare to send too many people in.</p><p>“However, after you enter, you must remember a few things!”</p><p>“First, after entering, if you see any outsiders, kill them!” second, try your best to find places that the creatures of netherworld mountain can’t enter. There’s a high probability of finding opportunities in those places! third, remember to take advantage of the situation. Sometimes, you can use the power of the living beings of netherworld mountain to kill the alien race. If you can use the martial God Realm experts of netherworld mountain to kill the alien race’s divine ancestor and the Saint ancestor bloodheart, you can protect the heaven realm!</p><p>Zu long warned him seriously.</p><p>Everyone nodded and agreed in unison.</p><p>of course, I haven’t entered it. I read these according to extremely ancient books. Since the myriad tribulations have passed, I don’t know what has happened in netherworld mountain. Therefore, after entering, the most important thing is to adapt to the situation!</p><p>alright, netherworld mountain will open in a month. All of you will gather here in a month. I’m afraid it will take a long time before you can come out. If you have anything to do, make arrangements in advance!</p><p>The ancestral Dragon ordered.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Everyone received the order and left the place.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing left the place, planning to bid farewell to Li Ping and Lu Yuntian. This trip would take quite a long time. Even the ancestral Dragon said that it would take a long time, so it must really take a long time.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming would not miss this trip.</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to improve quickly. He could not cultivate step by step. It was too slow. Moreover, he needed too many resources to improve his cultivation level.</p><p>The resources he had on him were simply not enough for him to improve. This trip to netherworld mountain might be an opportunity for him.</p><p>When he returned to the heavenly Emperor City, he bade farewell to Li Ping and Lu Yuntian, saying that they would be going into seclusion for a period of time. He asked Lu shenhuang, mu wanxuan, and Lu Chi to stay in the heavenly Emperor City to accompany Li Ping and the rest.</p><p>A month passed by in a hurry. Lu Ming and Xie nianqing returned to the square in the lair of Zulong.</p><p>Everyone gathered again.</p><p>ancestral Dragon stood in the air and waved his hand. A small boat appeared and then quickly became bigger.</p><p>“This is … A sky-reaching warship? No, it’s not the ship that belonged to the Archean body cultivator!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>He realized that the boat zu long took out was very similar to the sky-reaching battleships that the Archean body cultivators used to take out. It could float on the yellow spring River.</p><p>the Archean body cultivators once said that the sky-reaching battleship was obtained from a historical site by their ancestors. Could it be that the treasure that can resist the netherworld water was obtained from netherworld mountain? ”</p><p>Lu Ming had a thought.</p><p>this ship is called the sky-reaching warship. All of you can board it. If you want to enter netherworld mountain, you must use this treasure to cross the netherworld River!</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Immediately, thousands of people rose into the air and flew toward the warship.</p><p>it’s indeed also called a heaven-reaching warship!</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered. He held Xie nianqing’s hand and flew to the skyreaching battleship.</p><p>The sky-reaching battleship was extremely large, and thousands of people could only occupy a small space.</p><p>After everyone had entered the warship, the warship shrank rapidly and was put away by the ancestral Dragon. Then, the ancestral Dragon took a step forward and disappeared from the lair of Zulong. The next moment, the space outside the two world city trembled and the ancestral Dragon appeared.</p><p>The speed was unbelievable.</p><p>“Moke!”</p><p>The ancestral Dragon looked forward. The void in front of him shook, and another figure appeared. It was the Saint ancestor of the non-human race, mo ke!</p><p>ancestral Dragon, this time, you’ll definitely lose. Killing heart and I will recover in netherworld mountain and take your head!</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor Moke said coldly.</p><p>“Let’s see who will have the last laugh!”</p><p>yes, ” zu long replied coldly. He took a step forward and rushed into the spatial crack. He came to the sky above the yellow spring River and waved his hand.</p><p>The Supreme battleship enlarged rapidly and landed on the yellow spring River. Zu long then landed on the deck of the Supreme battleship.</p><p>At the same time, the non-human divine ancestor had also entered the yellow spring. He took out a battleship similar to the sky-reaching battleship and also landed in the yellow spring River.</p><p>The two warships advanced side by side, heading toward the yellow spring.</p><p>The experts from both sides sized each other up and clashed.</p><p>“The first Prince, Kando …”</p><p>On the alien warship, Lu Ming saw a few extremely talented figures on the longevity Roll.</p><p>The top-ranked geniuses on the longevity Roll were all there.</p><p>Clearly, the non-human divine ancestor had the same thought as the ancestral Dragon. Choosing people to enter netherworld mountain wasn’t based on cultivation, but on luck.</p><p>Only those with stronger luck would be able to obtain fortuitous encounters and even kill their opponents.</p><p>The two sides did not make a move. If they did, they would only end up with both sides suffering losses. No one had the confidence.</p><p>The two battleships continued to move forward. In front of the yellow spring River, a huge mountain was looming, as if it was extremely far away.</p><p>They had been traveling for three months, but they still hadn’t reached the end of the yellow spring River. Moreover, the mountain was still in front of them, and they didn’t know how far it was.</p><p>“Soon!”</p><p>At this moment, the ancestral Dragon spoke, and everyone’s spirit was lifted.</p><p>Was he finally here?</p><p>“Look, that mountain is gone!”</p><p>“Not good, there’s a vortex in front!”</p><p>Suddenly, someone exclaimed.</p><p>In front of him, the mountain had disappeared. In its place was an incomparably huge vortex. All the water of the netherworld was flowing into that vortex.</p><p>Could this be the end of the yellow Springs?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
