Lu Ming? Could he be the Lu Ming who has been known as the heaven realm and the primordial realm’s number one prodigy of the younger generation for more than a hundred years? the one who has become an Emperor with many laws?”</p><p>One of the old men muttered. Suddenly, his expression changed as if he had thought of something.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Zu long nodded.</p><p>“It’s him! It’s actually him!”</p><p>Ao Luan and the two old men were extremely shocked.</p><p>“If you don’t have any objections, you may leave!”</p><p>Zu long waved his hand.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The two old men and ao Luan bowed and saluted. Then, they retreated and flew tens of thousands of miles away. They helped the middle-aged man up and left quickly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, come with me!”</p><p>Zu long smiled, then turned around and flew to the right.</p><p>Lu Ming touched his nose and smiled bitterly. He reckoned that the ancestral Dragon had long known about the situation, but he deliberately did not show himself so that Lu Ming would take action and reveal his strength, lest ao Luan and the others were dissatisfied.</p><p>They followed the ancestral Dragon and came to a Valley. There was a light screen at the entrance of the valley. It was obvious that there was a formation sealing the place.</p><p>The ancestral Dragon waved his hand and the formation opened. Lu Ming walked in.</p><p>There was a vortex in the valley.</p><p>“Lu Ming, go in. Behind the vortex is the Dragon marrow pool. It contains the essence of the dragon marrow that is naturally born in the world. It only opens once every ten thousand years. If you absorb the essence of the dragon marrow, it will be enough to improve your body and reach the heavenly Emperor realm!”</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>“It can help my body break through to the heavenly Emperor realm?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>This was incredible.</p><p>He was now at the late-stage of the fifth level of the seven Gods mysterious technique. If he wanted to cultivate to the sixth level, he would need to use topnotch treasures and slowly cultivate on his own. Even if Lu Ming was extremely talented, it would be difficult for him to break through without thousands of years of cultivation.</p><p>Now, he could make a breakthrough with the help of the Dragon essence pool. It was evident that the value of the Dragon essence pool was high. It was no wonder that ao Luan wanted to find trouble with Lu Ming.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming saluted the ancestral Dragon solemnly.</p><p>you don’t have to thank me. The situation is urgent now. Saint ancestor bloodheart is not dead. Although only a wisp of his bloodline is left, Moke will definitely find a way to help him recover. Also, that place is about to open. You are the only variable now. You must improve your strength as soon as possible!</p><p>Zulong said, his eyes filled with worry.</p><p>“That place is about to open? The only variable?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>What was the meaning of this?</p><p>Also, what was the ‘sky-opening’ that the divine ancestor of the outsiders had mentioned?</p><p>Lu Ming realized that as his cultivation level increased, he knew more and more. However, there were also more and more things that he did not know.</p><p>There seemed to be many secrets in this world that he did not understand. However, the ancestral Dragon didn’t want to say more. “You may enter!” “Yes!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and stepped forward, entering the vortex.</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming appeared in a wonderful place.</p><p>It was an underground cave that was very wide. The moment Lu Ming entered, he heard the sound of a Dragon’s Roar.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Lu Ming sized up the underground cave and discovered an extremely wonderful scene.</p><p>The walls of this cave were covered with Dragon-shaped marks, which didn’t look like they were carved by humans. They looked more like natural and vivid marks.</p><p>In addition, there were some spiritual herbs and Saint herbs growing around the cave. They were all in the shape of Dragons, like small real Dragons, crawling all over the place.</p><p>In the middle of the cave, there was a small pool with golden liquid inside. The Dragon roars were coming from the pool.</p><p>Lu Ming took a look and discovered that there were nine golden true dragons swimming in the pool.</p><p>No, that was not a real Dragon, but a condensed form of energy. The essence that it emitted was extremely dense.</p><p>amazing, it’s really amazing. The Dragon essence pool was formed naturally by heaven and earth. Nature is really amazing!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. Then, he took off his clothes and entered the Dragon essence pool. He sat cross-legged, and the water in the pool just happened to be above his head.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming entered the Dragon essence pool, the water transformed into tiny true dragons that wriggled into his body.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming began to use the seven divine mysterious technique to absorb the energy in the Dragon essence pool and temper his body.</p><p>The energy in the Dragon essence pool was absorbed by Lu Ming and seeped into every part of his body. In every cell, Lu Ming’s physical body was improving rapidly. It was at least a few hundred times faster than his usual cultivation speed.</p><p>Lu Ming cultivated with all his heart, forgetting everything and time. He cast everything aside and cultivated with all his heart.</p><p>Time flew by. Days passed and months passed.</p><p>The water level of the Dragon essence pool was also dropping slowly.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, three years had passed.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Suddenly, a Dragon’s Roar came from Lu Ming’s body. Then, the sound of his bones vibrating could be heard.</p><p>The vibration sound grew stronger and the aura on Lu Ming’s body grew stronger.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the end, it formed a huge explosion.</p><p>A terrifying aura filled the cave.</p><p>Heavenly Emperor, this was the pressure of a heavenly Emperor.</p><p>Lu Ming had finally broken through to the sixth level of the seven Gods mysterious technique.</p><p>Lu Ming’s physical strength had completely reached the heavenly Emperor realm. Now, Lu Ming could suppress an ordinary one-star heavenly Emperor with his physical strength alone.</p><p>In addition to the power of the way of domination, Lu Ming’s strength had increased by another level.</p><p>Lu Ming continued cultivating for two months to consolidate his cultivation before ending it.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a long sigh. His lungs moved and a Dragon’s Roar came from his throat.</p><p>“The dragon and I are really fated!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and got up to feel the situation in his body.</p><p>His entire body was filled with destructive power, and his blood Qi was as turbulent as a Great River.</p><p>Heavenly Emperor realm!</p><p>After cultivating for more than a hundred years, Lu Ming had finally broken through to the heavenly Emperor realm. However, he was the first to do so in the path of physical cultivation.</p><p>“I don’t know how much time has passed!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and left the place.</p><p>When he walked out of the vortex, there was a flash in the sky. The projection of the ancestral Dragon appeared.</p><p>“It seems like I’ve broken through!”</p><p>Zu long smiled.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>“Senior, how long have I been cultivating?” Lu Ming cupped his fists and asked.</p><p>“Three years!”</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>“It’s been three years?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>“Do you really want to leave? Go! If there’s anything, I’ll come to you!”</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He was indeed eager to return home. He wanted to go back and see how the situation was.</p><p>Lu Ming left the place with the ancestral Dragon. He went to Xuan Feng and Xuan Xiang and bade them farewell. He went to an ancient city nearby and left the lair of Zulong by taking the teleportation formation.</p><p>After leaving the lair of Zulong, Lu Ming appeared in the North of the Tai Qing heavenly region. He then took another teleportation array and headed to two world city.</p><p>Lu Ming returned to two world city two days later.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
