Tell him that I, Lu Ming, will give him three days ‘time. Within three days, he must come and kneel before me to apologize. After that, he must submit to me and work for me. Otherwise, three days later, I will storm his governor’s manor and take his dog life!”</p><p>What?</p><p>Lu Ming’s words stunned everyone.</p><p>Luo Mo’s words were to get Lu Ming to join him and work for him.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming had actually asked Rama to kneel and apologize and then help Lu Ming with his work.</p><p>This contrast stunned everyone, and they thought they had heard wrong.</p><p>“You… What did you just say?”</p><p>One of the Rama guards pointed at Lu Ming with a trembling finger. He thought that he was dreaming.</p><p>“Go back and tell them to get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re so stubborn. You’re asking for death. Liao min, do you see that? Lu Ming is arrogant and stubborn. He’s asking for death, and he’s going to bring all of you down with him. If you don’t surrender now, I’ll put in a few good words for you in front of commander Rama!”</p><p>Bleu shouted.</p><p>“Do you want to surrender?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Liao min.</p><p>“I’m willing to die for you, commander!” Liao min gritted her teeth and cupped her fists.</p><p>“What about you guys?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the remaining guards.</p><p>The guards ‘expressions changed. Then, they gritted their teeth and said, ”</p><p>“I’m willing to die for you, commander!”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile on his face.</p><p>“You guys… You’re so stubborn, you’re seeking death!”</p><p>Bleu shouted.</p><p>“Blowing!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He suddenly moved and appeared in front of Bleu, pointing his finger.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>A burst of energy shot out, directly piercing through Bleu’s dantian.</p><p>Bleu’s eyes widened and he looked at Lu Ming in disbelief. Then, he started to scream crazily.</p><p>He screamed wildly. He did not expect that Lu Ming would really dare to attack him now that he had become Rama’s guard.</p><p>His heart was filled with despair.</p><p>Although the cultivation of the people of netherworld mountain was different from that of the heaven realm, there was one thing in common. That was, the dantian was still a vital point, a place to store energy.</p><p>If his dantian was destroyed, his cultivation base would be crippled.</p><p>“I’m not killing you now because I want you to see how I’in going to destroy Rama. Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly and threw Bleu out.</p><p>The others were incomparably terrified, and they hurriedly retreated with Bleu.</p><p>Lu Ming did not say anything. He turned around and returned to the governor’s manor.</p><p>As for Lu Ming’s request for Rama to kneel and apologize, if he did not apologize, the news that he would attack the Rama residence in three days spread like a whirlwind, throughout the entire capital.</p><p>The capital was shaken.</p><p>It had only been a few days since the meeting of the commanders. Many of the commanders had not returned to their respective territories. They were all shocked and were looking forward to the next development of the situation.</p><p>damn it! Rama’s angry roar came from the governor’s manor.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you brat, How dare you? you’re seeking your own death. Let’s see howyou’re going to kill me in three days!”</p><p>Rama roared in anger as his cold killing intent enveloped the entire governor’s manor.</p><p>Countless experts in the capital were watching. The atmosphere in the capital was extremely tense.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.</p><p>“Let’s go. Follow me to the Romo’s governor’s manor!”</p><p>Lu Ming strode out of the commander’s residence and headed for the Rama residence.</p><p>Liao min and the other guards gritted their teeth and followed Lu Ming.</p><p>They were taking a gamble!</p><p>They realized that Lu Ming was too relaxed these few days.</p><p>This wasn’t done on purpose. He was really relaxed.</p><p>If they were not confident, they would not be so relaxed. Therefore, they took a gamble. They bet that Lu Ming had the confidence to deal with Rama. If they bet correctly, they would definitely be successful.</p><p>“Lu Ming has set off!”</p><p>The moment Lu Ming came out, the entire capital was in an uproar. Countless people, both openly and secretly, followed Lu Ming as he headed for the Romo’s governor’s manor.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming arrived at the Romo’s governor’s manor.</p><p>The Romo’s governor’s manor had already been heavily surrounded, both inside and outside.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Outside the Romo’s governor’s manor, someone stopped Lu Ming.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted coldly and took a step forward. A terrifying aura burst out, forming a storm-like force that rushed forward.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Those people guarding the gate were directly sent flying out by the force.</p><p>Lu Ming strode in.</p><p>Inside the gate was a wide courtyard, which was already full of people.</p><p>At the very top, Luo mo was sitting on an armchair. On both sides of him were expert guards.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the room and he realized that Bleu was there as well. Bleu was glaring at Lu Ming with a venomous look.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you here to apologize to me?”</p><p>Luo mo sneered. Killing intent flashed in the depths of his eyes.</p><p>“I’m here to take your dog head!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“How dare you! You’re looking for death!”</p><p>“How dare you be so rude to commander Rama!”</p><p>Luo Mo’s guards all shouted.</p><p>However, when Lu Ming’s cold gaze swept across them, their expressions changed drastically and they broke out in cold sweat.</p><p>now, I’ll give you all a chance. I’ll give you ten breaths to consider. After ten breaths, surrender to me and I’ll let bygones be bygones!</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the surroundings, looking as if he did not care about Rama at all.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Luo mo was so angry that he laughed. He stood up from his chair and a violent aura spread out, causing everyone to feel great pressure.</p><p>Luo mo had already reached the peak of the third level void transformation stage. In Feng Ming country, other than the king, no one was his match.</p><p>“They’re about to make their move!”</p><p>Outside the governor’s manor, the other governors and experts were all paying close attention. At this moment, their hearts trembled.</p><p>“Kill, kill him!”</p><p>Bleu roared in his heart and could not wait to cut Lu Ming into eight pieces.</p><p>“Today, I will make you wish you were dead!”</p><p>Luo mo said coldly. As soon as he finished speaking, he rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A snow-white scimitar appeared in Rama’s hand. It was extremely sharp and he slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fist and condensed a long spear with the way of domination. He swept the spear out.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The two attacks collided, creating a terrifying shockwave that swept in all directions.</p><p>“Quicklyretreat!”</p><p>The surrounding people retreated frantically, afraid of being dragged in.</p><p>With a loud boom, Lu Ming and Rama both took a few steps back.</p><p>“We’re on par!”</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming could actually fight to a draw with Rama.</p><p>They finally knew why Lu Ming dared to come all the way here. It turned out that he had enough capital.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>Luo mo roared and unleashed his combat strength to the maximum as he charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming held his long spear and charged over.</p><p>Lu Ming did not use his physical strength. He only used The Way of the Master to fight.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming’s cultivation had reached the three-star great emperor level, he could suppress an ordinary three-star heavenly Emperor with the Dao of domination alone.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
