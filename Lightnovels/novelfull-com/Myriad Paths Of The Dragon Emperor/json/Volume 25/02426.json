His battle power was beyond imagination.</p><p>There were not many people like him in the evil god Realm or the heaven realm.</p><p>According to Lu Ming’s knowledge, the top ten war beasts were at the peak of the heavenly Emperor realm at their peak.</p><p>However, the ordinary-looking man in front of him was actually a peak heavenly Emperor.</p><p>“Qing Cang used to be a well-known figure in the heaven realm. Haven’t you heard of him, brother Lu Ming?”</p><p>Mrs. Wu looked at Lu Ming curiously.</p><p>“No, I didn’t!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head.</p><p>hahaha, Mrs. Wu, when was I in heaven realm? so many years have passed, who still remembers my name!</p><p>Qing Cang laughed and didn’t take it seriously.</p><p>the nine-headed Golden lion’s name has shaken the world. Back then, even the evil god World had heard of it…</p><p>Mrs. Wu said with a grin.</p><p>“What? The nine-headed Golden Lion…”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes widened in shock.</p><p>Of course, he knew about the nine-headed Golden Lion.</p><p>One of the top ten Battle Beasts, the nine-headed Golden Lion, who didn’t know about it?</p><p>However, it was said that the nine-headed Golden Lion had already died in the ancient war. Qing Cang was actually one of the top ten war beasts, the nine- headed Golden Lion.</p><p>So he didn’t die.</p><p>“You’ve heard of it?”</p><p>Mrs. Wu said.</p><p>“Of course, who hasn’t heard of the nine-headed Golden Lion, one of the top ten Battle Beasts?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>everything is just a false reputation. You’ve still become a prisoner!</p><p>Qing Cang laughed at himself.</p><p>“Big brother Qing Cang, big brother Wu tai, why are you wearing this chain armor but I’m not?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>this kind of armor can seal one’s cultivation base. It’s covered with formations that can seal one’s cultivation base through one’s acupuncture points. All those above the celestial Thearch realm wear this kind of armor. As for those below the celestial Thearch realm, their cultivation base isn’t high. Even if they don’t wear the armor, the evil god tribe can easily suppress them. Therefore, they don’t wear it!</p><p>Mrs. Wu explained.</p><p>Lu Ming came to a realization. No wonder some people were wearing armor while some were not. So this was the reason.</p><p>This place was surrounded by restrictions with terrifying defensive and killing power. Even a heavenly Emperor couldn’t get out, let alone those under the heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p>Moreover, there were so many experts of the foreign kinds guarding this place. Those below the heavenly Emperor realm couldn’t cause any trouble.</p><p>“They’re here!”</p><p>Qing Cang suddenly said as he looked in one direction.</p><p>Lu Ming and Wu tai also looked in the same direction.</p><p>A bald, middle-aged man walked over with a group of people in fiery red armor.</p><p>The bald middle-aged man looked no different from a human, but the third eye on his forehead told everyone that he was a foreign race.</p><p>His body exuded an extremely terrifying aura. It was as if he was the universe, high and mighty. His pressure was like the ten lands and the eight wastelands of the universe.</p><p>“How terrifying!”</p><p>Lu Ming sensed it and felt cold sweat all over his body. His heart was beating faster.</p><p>this man is called duo Lei, the commander of the eternal cage. He is also a peak heavenly Emperor!</p><p>Mrs. Wu said in a low voice.</p><p>“Peakheavenly Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. No wonder he gave off such a terrifying feeling.</p><p>With a peak heavenly Emperor guarding this place, even if he didn’t set up a restriction, not many people would be able to escape.</p><p>duo Lei practices a strange combat technique that requires him to absorb powerful battle Qi. So, he will gather everyone together once in a while and then choose someone to compete with. He will then be able to absorb the battle Qi of others during their battles!</p><p>Mrs. Wu continued to explain.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He finally understood why these people had gathered here.</p><p>Duo Lei came to the center of the cave and waved his hand. A fighting stage appeared and landed in the middle of the cave.</p><p>according to the old rules, whoever I point out will go up and fight. Whoever doesn’t try their best and is perfunctory, I will draw all his blood after the battle!</p><p>Duo Lei said coldly. His eyes were like lightning as they scanned the surroundings.</p><p>The faces of those who were scanned by him all changed and became somewhat grave.</p><p>Duo Lei was vicious and merciless, and he would definitely do as he said.</p><p>Many of them had been imprisoned here for countless years, so they were naturally aware of this.</p><p>“Liu Ji, Wang Mang, you guys go up!”</p><p>Duo Lei called out names.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming saw two figures walking up to the fighting ring.</p><p>Both of them were wearing silver chain armors. It was obvious that they were both at the heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p>After the two of them stepped onto the fighting ring, duo Lei waved his hand, and their armors flew away and landed in duo Lei’s hands.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>As soon as the armor flew away, Liu Ji and Wang Mang’s bodies exploded with astonishing auras.</p><p>“This is … Three star heavenly Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>Two of them were three-star heavenly emperors. The number of experts imprisoned in this eternal cage was shocking.</p><p>Liu Ji and Wang Mang looked at each other, and then they suddenly rushed toward each other.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them began to fight intensely in the fighting ring.</p><p>The two of them had similar cultivation levels, and they used their full strength without holding back. The battle was extremely intense.</p><p>“This … It’s not a law system!”</p><p>As soon as the two of them started fighting, Lu Ming realized that they were not cultivating the nomological system at all. Instead, they were cultivating the immemorial martial Dao, which was similar to the immemorial system.</p><p>they’re from the prison suppression field. They’re cultivating, so it should be different from the heaven realm, right? ”</p><p>Mrs. Wu said.</p><p>“Yes, I am!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>The nomological system had risen at the end of the primordial era, and the prison suppression field should have always been in the evil god field. It was normal that they cultivated differently.</p><p>The two of them exchanged several hundred moves, and in the end, Liu Ji Won by a slight margin, defeating Wang Mang.</p><p>Duo Lei was watching from the side, his eyes sparkling with excitement. A layer of light flickered on his body, constantly changing.</p><p>After Liu Ji and Wang Mang’s battle, duo Lei called another two heavenly Emperor powerhouses to battle.</p><p>The cultivation of each group was similar, so the battle was extremely intense and full of fighting spirit. This was very beneficial to duo Lei.</p><p>Just like that, they fought a few groups in a row.</p><p>There were heavenly emperors and heavenly emperors.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that none of them cultivated the nomological system. Qing Cang told him that not many people in the heaven realm had been captured. Most of the humans here were from the prison suppression field.</p><p>recently, we have a newcomer here. He is a peerless heaven’s favorite from the heaven realm!</p><p>Suddenly, duo Lei spoke and looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>The others could not help but look at Lu Ming.</p><p>There was no one as young as Lu Ming here.</p><p>I heard that you’re very strong. Go up and fight!</p><p>Duo Lei said.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered, but he did not say anything. He stepped forward and landed on the fighting ring.</p><p>“You, go up and fight him!”</p><p>Duo Lei pointed at an old man.</p><p>The old man leaped onto the fighting ring, and a powerful aura emanated from his body.</p><p>He was a peak great emperor.</p><p>“Little brother, you have to be careful. This old man’s cultivation is peak Emperor!”</p><p>The old man said kindly.</p><p>He felt that Lu Ming was really young. He was so young. No matter how strong he was, how strong could he be? Hence, he kindly reminded her.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
