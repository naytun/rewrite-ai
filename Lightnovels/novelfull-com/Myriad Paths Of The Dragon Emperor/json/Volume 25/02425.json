On both sides of the passage, there were stone doors. It was obvious that these were all stone rooms.</p><p>This place was completely different from the place where Lu Ming had been imprisoned for a hundred years.</p><p>This place was definitely not the capital.</p><p>At this time, the doors of the stone rooms opened, and figures walked out from inside.</p><p>“Human!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>The ones who walked out of those stone rooms were actually humans.</p><p>A person walked out of each stone room.</p><p>Could these humans have been captured from the heaven realm?</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming saw a few more divine beasts, but all of them had taken on human form.</p><p>In addition, Lu Ming also discovered a unique point. Some people, like him, were not wearing anything. It was the same as when they were outside.</p><p>However, some of them were wearing silver chain armors that even covered their arms and legs.</p><p>“What is this place? A place to imprison prisoners from the heaven realm?”</p><p>Many thoughts flashed through Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>The others also looked at Lu Ming with curious expressions.</p><p>However, no one said anything because there were many alien races in blood- red armor. All of them were at the heavenly Emperor realm. Lu Ming saw that there were no less than ten of them.</p><p>He followed the passage and soon reached the end.</p><p>At the end of the passage was a huge cave. There was a hole above the cave, from which a beam of light shot down.</p><p>Lu Ming guessed that this might be the interior of a mountain.</p><p>There were passages all around the cave, and people were gathering from each passage.</p><p>Most of them were humans and divine beasts. Lu Ming even saw alien races wearing silver chain armors, looking like prisoners.</p><p>Around the cave stood many beings in fiery red armor. Of course, not all of them were heavenly emperors. Most of them were great emperors.</p><p>However, there were many of them, more than 200 of them.</p><p>The power of the foreign races gathered in this place was shockingly strong.</p><p>“Is this a cage for the alien race?”</p><p>Lu Ming speculated in his heart.</p><p>little brother, you’re new here. I’ve never seen you before!</p><p>At this moment, a burly man with messy hair walked over and greeted Lu Ming.</p><p>“That’s right, I’ve only been here for a few months!”</p><p>Lu Ming said as he sized up the other party.</p><p>The other party looked to be in his fifties. His hair and beard were in a mess, but one could barely tell that he was very handsome. His eyes flashed with a sense of Majesty.</p><p>He was also wearing a chain armor.</p><p>you should be from the heaven realm, and it should be less than a thousand years since you came from the heaven realm. You still have the smell of the heaven realm on you, a familiar yet strange smell!</p><p>The burly man sighed and revealed a nostalgic expression.</p><p>“Big brother also came from the heaven realm?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>that’s right. However, that was many, many years ago. I don’t even know how many years ago it was. I heard that it should be the ancient era!</p><p>The burly man sighed.</p><p>“Ancient times!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>Could it be that he was captured by the alien race during the ancient war and imprisoned here?</p><p>It was hard to imagine how many years it had been since the ancient era.</p><p>“Are the humans and divine beasts here all seniors of the heaven realm?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>“No, only a small portion of them came from the heaven realm!”</p><p>The burly man shook his head.</p><p>“A small portion?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>haha, you can’t be thinking that only the heaven realm and the primordial realm have humans, right? in fact, the evil god Realm also has humans! The burly man laughed.</p><p>There are humans in the evil god tribe? ”</p><p>This time, Lu Ming was even more shocked.</p><p>He had never heard that there were humans in the evil god World. Weren’t the evil god World all alien races?</p><p>The 10 Royal alien races occupied the entire evil god World.</p><p>haha, I’m a human from this side. Qing Cang, is this little brother from the heaven realm? ”</p><p>At this moment, a burly man with fiery red hair walked over. He looked to be in his fifties and was also wearing a chain-like armor.</p><p>The big man with messy hair was called Qing Cang.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Qing Cang nodded and introduced, ” his name is Wu tai. He’s a human from the evil god World. Little brother, what’s your name? ”</p><p>“My name is Lu Ming!”</p><p>Lu Ming introduced himself and then started chatting with Qing Cang and Madam Wu.</p><p>The two of them were very forthright. Lu Ming learned a lot about this place during the conversation.</p><p>This place was called the eternal cage. It was a place where the alien races locked up felons. It meant that once someone was locked in, it would be difficult to get out for ten thousand years.</p><p>These people had been detained and given drugs on the spot.</p><p>That’s right, medicine. Every once in a while, the alien races would send people to extract their blood and use it to make pills for the alien races to consume and improve their cultivation.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming learned that there were humans in the evil god Realm.</p><p>There were still some who stayed in a place called the prison realm to resist the alien races.</p><p>And the power of the prison suppression field was very strong.</p><p>“The prison suppression field? The name is so similar to the prisonsuppressing stele!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred and he thought of many things.</p><p>Maybe the alien races were distracted by the prison suppression field, so they couldn’t attack the heaven realm with all their might.</p><p>“Why is there another outsider locked up here?!”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>because some alien tribes are also against attacking the heaven realm. You see, those dozen alien tribes over there are all very powerful existences. However, they opposed the attack on the heaven realm in ancient times, so they were also imprisoned here!</p><p>Qing Cang said, pointing to the left.</p><p>Lu Ming looked over and saw more than ten alien races. They were all Royal members of the alien race and they were wearing silver chain armors.</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>Lu Ming came to a sudden realization. It seemed that not all the alien races were in favor of attacking the heaven realm. Some were against it.</p><p>In fact, Lu Ming had been wondering why the alien races had to attack and destroy the heaven. Wouldn’t it be better for everyone to live in peace?</p><p>“Big brother Qing Cang, you’ve been imprisoned here since ancient times. Has no one ever escaped from here after so many years?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>“No, I didn’t!”</p><p>Qing Cang shook his head and sighed, the entire eternal cage is enveloped by a treasure and has a terrifying restriction. It’s said that the treasure belongs to the evil god tribe’s Saint ancestor. Once it’s set up, the restriction can’t be broken!</p><p>moreover, the restriction has a terrifying killing power. As long as one is within the restriction, once there is any abnormal movement, the restriction will be activated and even a peak heavenly Emperor will be killed!</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. A peak heavenly Emperor was about to be killed. That was too terrifying.</p><p>A peak heavenly Emperor was the most powerful person in the world. Lu Ming could not imagine how powerful he was.</p><p>“Lu Ming, brother Qing Cang is a peak heavenly Emperor!”</p><p>Mrs. Wu said.</p><p>“What? Peak heavenly Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled and he was dumbfounded. He had never expected Qing Cang to be a peak heavenly Emperor.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
