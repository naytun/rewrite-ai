Otherwise, Lu Ming would not be at ease.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming stood up, and Lu shenhuang and the rest followed him. They headed back to the primordial realm.</p><p>Lu Ming had returned to the primordial realm a few times and was familiar with the way. Not long after, Lu Ming and the rest returned to the primordial mountain of the primordial realm through the void passageway.</p><p>The primordial realm was still peaceful.</p><p>Back then, the alien race had used the bone daggers of the previous generation of space-time spiritual rats to open a passage to the primordial realm. Fortunately, Lu Ming and the rest had discovered it.</p><p>In that battle, Lu Ming was captured, but the Titan longhorn beetle and the nine lives devilish silkworm arrived and saved dandan, bubbles, tu Yi, and Lei Yi.</p><p>Then, he would send this news to the heaven realm.</p><p>The heaven realm had sent a large number of experts to guard the passage. The alien races seemed to know that they couldn’t do it. In these years, they didn’t continue to open the passage, nor did they invade from there.</p><p>Thus, the primordial realm remained peaceful.</p><p>Lu Ming led the few of them and flew towards the heavenly Emperor City. In the past, the people from Dragon God Valley and Dragon Alliance had occupied the territories of the Heng family and the he family respectively Later on, the primal Chaos Palace had sent some puppet masters to guard the two families, making them impregnable. These years, the two families had developed steadily and many masters had emerged.</p><p>In Dragon God Valley, the strength of the Dragon Alliance was steadily increasing.</p><p>Lu Yuntian and Li Ping were chatting in a huge courtyard.</p><p>Although more than a hundred years had passed, not only did the two of them not age, they became younger and younger.</p><p>Lu Ming had left behind a large amount of resources. Although Li Ping’s cultivation talent was very poor, with a large amount of resources and the guidance of some great emperor realm experts, her cultivation had still reached the martial Royal realm.</p><p>As force Emperor could live for roooo – 20000 years, of course, she looked very young.</p><p>“Sigh, Ming ‘er hasn’t been back for more than a hundred years. I wonder how he’s doing now?”</p><p>Li Ping sighed softly, her eyes filled with longing.</p><p>Madam, young master is currently in seclusion. I believe that he will come back to see you once he comes out!</p><p>At the side, Qiu Yue said.</p><p>Back then, they did not tell Li Ping and Lu Yuntian about Lu Ming being captured by the alien race. They had been keeping it a secret from them, only saying that Lu Ming was in seclusion.</p><p>All these years, Qiu Yue had always been by Li Ping and Qiu Yue’s side, that’s right, you’re really a woman. You’re already a Martial Emperor, but you’re still so ignorant. With Ming ‘er’s current cultivation, it’s normal for him to go into closed-door cultivation for a hundred years!</p><p>Lu Yuntian chided Li Ping.</p><p>“You’re the only one who’s open-minded!”</p><p>Li Ping rolled her eyes.</p><p>At this moment, Qiu Yue seemed to have sensed something and looked up at the sky.</p><p>The empty sky suddenly trembled, and a spatial crack appeared. A few figures walked out from it.</p><p>It was Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Qiu Yue was stunned for a moment, then her delicate body trembled. Tears flowed down uncontrollably as she mumbled, ” “Young master, young master is back. It’s young master…”</p><p>Qiu Yue knew that Lu Ming had been captured by the alien race. Naturally she was extremely worried. It would be strange if she was not excited to see Lu Ming.</p><p>Upon hearing Qiu Yue’s words, Li Ping and Lu Yuntian also looked up at the sky. “Ming, er…”</p><p>The two of them were overjoyed.</p><p>“Let’s go down…”</p><p>Lu Ming’s face was full of smiles. He then stepped down and landed in the courtyard. Lu shenhuang and the rest followed.</p><p>“Father, mother!”</p><p>Lu Ming was all smiles.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, you’ve finally come out of seclusion…”</p><p>Li Ping was also very excited. As she spoke, she looked at Lu shenhuang and the others. With one look, she could not help but be stunned.</p><p>This was because Lu shenhuang and Lu Ming were too similar.</p><p>“Ming’er, they are…”</p><p>Lu Yuntian was also a little stunned.</p><p>“Cough cough!”</p><p>Lu Ming coughed a few times and started to introduce, father, mother, this is my son. His name is Lu shenhuang. That is his wife, mu wanxuan. Also, this little fellow is the daughter of the divine wilderness, my granddaughter, Lu Chi!</p><p>“All?”</p><p>Li Ping and Lu Yuntian were both stunned.</p><p>However, it was only for a moment, and their faces were filled with smiles.</p><p>He didn’t expect that after not seeing each other for more than a hundred years, they would even have a grandson. Not only that, but their grandson had already gotten married and had a daughter.</p><p>The old couple was naturally excited to have so many descendants.</p><p>“Grandpa, grandma!”</p><p>“Grandpa, grandma!”</p><p>Lu shenhuang and mu wanxuan both went forward and bowed to Li Ping and Lu Yuntian.</p><p>Great-grandfather, great-grandmother, ah…”</p><p>The little fellow also called out in a baby voice.</p><p>“Good, good, good, don’t be so polite!”</p><p>The old couple could not stop smiling.</p><p>Blood was thicker than water in a family, so they naturally got to know each other very quickly. After a while, Li Ping was happily chatting with mu wanxuan with Lu Chi in her arms.</p><p>“Good, you really have Ming ‘er’s style, haha!”</p><p>Lu Yuntian patted Lu shenhuang’s shoulder and laughed heartily.</p><p>The family was happy and harmonious.</p><p>Qiu Yue stood at the side, her eyes filled with envy.</p><p>She wished that she could give birth to children for Lu Ming.</p><p>Ming ‘er, the mother of the divine wilderness is…”</p><p>Li Ping asked Lu Ming after a while.</p><p>“It’s nianqing…” Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Where is she?”</p><p>Li Ping asked with concern.</p><p>she has something to do now. Mother, don’t worry. I’ll bring her to see you soon!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>As everyone chatted, not long after, Lu Yuntian ordered the servants to prepare a banquet.</p><p>The news of Lu Ming’s return spread and the people from the Dragon Alliance and Dragon God Valley cheered.</p><p>Lu Ming was their backbone. They felt uneasy without him around.</p><p>There was even a rumor that Lu Ming had passed away. There had always been an uneasy atmosphere in the Dragon Alliance and Dragon God Valley. Now that Lu Ming had appeared, everyone was naturally happy.</p><p>At night, the moonlight was scattered, and the ground seemed to be covered in a layer of white frost.</p><p>Outside the heavenly Emperor City, on a mountain peak, Qiu Yue stood there quietly, looking into the distance.</p><p>Al!</p><p>After a long time, Qiu Yue sighed.</p><p>“Qiuyue, what are you sighing for?”</p><p>Suddenly, a voice was heard.</p><p>Qiu Yue jumped in shock. She turned around and saw Lu Ming smiling at her.</p><p>“Young… Young master! Young master…”</p><p>Qiu Yue’s face turned red.</p><p>Lu Ming walked over and held Qiu Yue’s small hand.</p><p>“Qiuyue, thank you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>How could he not know what Qiu Yue was thinking?</p><p>“Young master, why are you thanking me?”</p><p>Qiu Yue said.</p><p>“Thankyou for taking care of my parents all these years!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“This is what I should be doing…”</p><p>Before Qiu Yue could finish her sentence, Lu Ming’s lips had already sealed her warm lips.</p><p>Qiu Yue’s body trembled and she slowly closed her eyes. Two drops of tears flowed down her white cheeks.</p><p>After a long time, their lips separated.</p><p>“Qiuyue, I, Lu Ming, will not let you down in this life!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s determined voice rang in Qiu Yue’s ears.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
