Lu Ming’s comprehension of the nominator’s nao had greatly improved. Otherwise, he would not have been able to do this.</p><p>However, it was enough to affect a four star great emperor for a moment!</p><p>For those below the four-star heavenly Emperor level, the impact would probably be even greater.</p><p>For those with weaker cultivation, Lu Ming could dominate them and prevent them from attacking him even if he stood there without moving.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming continued to control the way of domination and used it on the remaining two alien races.</p><p>The bodies of the two demonic humans froze again.</p><p>“No, no…”</p><p>The two demonic humans roared in their hearts.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A ray of spear light shot out, and a foreign being was killed.</p><p>Next, there was only one alien left. He had already lost the thought of running away and attacked Lu Ming madly.</p><p>The result was destined. He was killed in the air by Lu Ming after a few moves.</p><p>Lu Ming put away all the storage bracelets and rings of the alien races.</p><p>Around him, the subordinates of country ruler Feng Ming dispersed in an uproar.</p><p>Heavenly venerate six sages and the rest of the heavenly realm were all dumbfounded.</p><p>Including monarch Feng Ming, there were a total of four four star great emperors. All of them were killed by Lu Ming. Not a single one of them managed to escape. Lu Ming’s methods were simply strange and unpredictable.</p><p>“Senior six saints, how are your injuries?”</p><p>Lu Ming walked over and asked.</p><p>“Good, it’s already stabilized!”</p><p>The celestial said.</p><p>Just now, he was heavily injured by country ruler Feng Ming. Fortunately, his head and dantian weren’t attacked. Although his injuries were severe, they weren’t life-threatening. With his peerless expert life force and astonishing recovery speed, he had already stabilized himself.</p><p>“Then, let’s go, we’re going to Rob the Fengming Imperial Palace!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a cold glint.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The others also revealed ferocious expressions.</p><p>They immediately flew toward the palace.</p><p>When they arrived at the Imperial Palace, it was already in complete chaos.</p><p>The news of King Feng Ming’s death had already spread. The experts in the palace were in complete chaos and began to snatch the treasures of the palace.</p><p>In order to snatch treasures, they killed each other, and the Imperial Palace was in a state of slaughter.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>When Lu Ming and the rest arrived, they immediately charged in.</p><p>They specifically chose heavenly Emperor realm powerhouses to kill.</p><p>In Fengming country, other than the thirteen commanders, there were still some other heavenly Emperor powerhouses. Lu Ming and the rest killed every one they saw.</p><p>Lu Ming had killed two heavenly Emperor powerhouses in a row and snatched their storage rings.</p><p>These heavenly emperors all had many divine stones on them.</p><p>The amount of resources that Lu Ming would need for his cultivation in the future was too terrifying.</p><p>One must know that his true cultivation base was only at the great emperor realm. The resources he used were comparable to other heavenly emperors.</p><p>If he were to break through to the heavenly Emperor realm, how much resources would he consume?</p><p>Therefore, what he wanted to do most now was to stock up on resources.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming and the rest charging towards them, the experts in the palace dispersed in an uproar.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest went deep into the palace and opened a treasure vault.</p><p>Inside was the royal treasury, which was filled with a large amount of resources.</p><p>There were all kinds of medicinal herbs, blacksmithing materials, combat weapons, and divine stones.</p><p>Unfortunately, they didn’t find any weapons that were equivalent to celestial sovereign weapons. The highest level was only a great sovereign weapon.</p><p>There was also a large number of divine stones, which Lu Ming and the rest divided among themselves.</p><p>Without a doubt, Lu Ming had the greatest credit. He took the majority of the credit and Lu Ming accepted it without any hesitation.</p><p>After ransacking the palace, Lu Ming and the rest left the capital of Feng Ming and flew into the distance. They only found a hidden place to stop after flying for hundreds of thousands of miles.</p><p>Heavenly venerate sixth Saint was recuperating while Lu Ming entered the mountain and river diagram to check on his gains.</p><p>Lu Ming took out the storage rings and bracelets and counted them.</p><p>Most of the alien races ‘storage rings contained crystals that were specially used by the alien races. They were not of much use to Lu Ming. However, there were some divine stones in the alien races’ storage bracelets that Lu Ming had collected.</p><p>The biggest gain was still country ruler Feng Ming.</p><p>Not only did King Feng Ming contribute a combat sword that was equivalent to a heaven Dao soldier, he also contributed a large number of divine stones.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming piled all the divine stones into a pile and counted them. There were about thirty million pieces.</p><p>Thirty million divine stones, each of which was equivalent to ten thousand Supreme-grade raw stones. It was an amazing fortune.</p><p>“Now, I can break through my cultivation!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>His comprehension of the path of a ruler had already reached the standard.</p><p>He could make a breakthrough in his cultivation now. Once he did, he would reach four star great emperor and his combat strength would increase exponentially.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, Lu Ming took out a large number of divine stones and began to absorb the energy inside the divine stones to break through.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming did not use chaos gems to break through. He planned to use divine stones.</p><p>He only had about 10000 chaos gems left. He planned to keep them for now. They might be useful in the future.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Piles and piles of divine stones exploded and turned into the unique divine Qi of the netherworld world world, which was absorbed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the path of domination and refined it with all his might, transforming the energy into World Energy.</p><p>Lu Ming began to break through to four star great emperor.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, two months had passed. The aura on Lu Ming’s body had increased dramatically. His entire body was shrouded in a purple-gold light, and he looked extremely noble.</p><p>After two months of cultivation, Lu Ming finally broke through and his cultivation level reached four star great emperor.</p><p>The area of the small world in his body expanded by a huge circle.</p><p>The world Energy was even more robust, and the ruler’s energy mixed in with the world Energy was also a bit thicker.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength had increased tremendously. Now, he could suppress a four-star celestial Thearch with just the Dao of domination.</p><p>With the combination of the Dao of domination and his physical body, Lu Ming could even kill a five-star celestial Thearch.</p><p>The truly powerful one was still the Dao of domination.</p><p>One should know that Lu Ming’s current cultivation was only at the four stars great emperor realm. He could cross a large realm to kill an enemy. His potential for improvement was huge. How powerful would he be when he entered the heavenly Emperor realm in the future? would he be able to compete with the martial God?</p><p>Lu Ming was very much looking forward to this!</p><p>After ending his cultivation, Lu Ming exited the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ve made another breakthrough in your cultivation!”</p><p>Sensing Lu Ming’s aura, celestial venerable six sages was shocked.</p><p>“I broke through by luck!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Heavenly venerate six sages and the others gasped.</p><p>A breakthrough by luck?</p><p>They laughed bitterly. Wiry didn’t the others get this lucky?</p><p>They were already in awe of Lu Ming.</p><p>At such a young age, Lu Ming could already kill a four-star heavenly Emperor in a row. Now that he had a breakthrough in his cultivation, how powerful would his combat strength be?</p><p>One had to know that a four-star heavenly Emperor was already known as a celestial venerable in the heaven realm.</p><p>Lu Ming was now able to kill celestial Venerables in succession. He was almost at the peak of this world.</p><p>In a few more years, he would probably be unrivaled.</p><p>They knew that they were witnessing the rapid rise of an invincible figure.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
