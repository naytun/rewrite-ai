Could this be the foundation of the heaven realm?”</p><p>Many thoughts flashed through Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>In the past, the number of Masters he had met in two world city or in two world city could not be compared to the alien races. They were even far from being comparable to the prison guard field. Lu Ming had always been curious about how they could fight against the alien races with such power.</p><p>Lu Ming also guessed that the heaven realm was hiding some power.</p><p>Now that he had discovered it, it was very likely that this place was the hidden power of the heaven realm.</p><p>this is where I live. It’s an independent world. The outside world is called the lair of Zulong!</p><p>Zu long explained.</p><p>“Lair of Zulong!”</p><p>Lu Ming remembered this name.</p><p>At this moment, a beam of light flew out from the mountain below. In a flash, it appeared in front of everyone.</p><p>It was a middle-aged man with a burly figure. He wore a scale armor and looked majestic and handsome.</p><p>“Five elements, haha, long time no see!”</p><p>Qing Cang laughed and came out to greet the middle-aged man.</p><p>The middle-aged man was surprised to see Qing Cang, but then he smiled and said, ” “So it’s you, Lion. It’s been so many years, I thought you were long dead?”</p><p>“Pfft, you Qilin didn’t die, so how could I die?”</p><p>Qing Cang deliberately pulled a long face. He was overjoyed to see someone he knew.</p><p>“Five elements? Qilin, could it be the five elements Qilin, one of the top ten Battle Beasts?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>There was a five elements Qilin among the top ten Battle Beasts, which was definitely powerful. Seeing how familiar Qing Cang was with the other party, it was most likely the case.</p><p>“Greetings, senior!”</p><p>Wu Xing saluted the ancestral Dragon.</p><p>Wuxing, you’ve come at the right time. I’ve brought all the people from the prison suppression field. Go and arrange a place for them to live!</p><p>Zu long waved his hand and nine prison-guarding steles flew towards elder Liu. Elder Liu reached out and caught them.</p><p>“Alright, everyone, please follow me!”</p><p>Wu Xing waved his hand and flew off in a certain direction. Elder Liu and the others followed.</p><p>Only zu long, Lu Ming, Qing Cang, and a few people from the heaven realm were left at the scene.</p><p>“Senior, we will take our leave!”</p><p>“Senior ancestral Dragon, I’ll also take my leave!”</p><p>The few of them bade farewell to the ancestral Dragon.</p><p>They were from the heaven realm and had been captured by the alien races for countless years. They missed their family and friends here, so they naturally wanted to meet them as soon as possible.</p><p>There are teleportation gates in those cities. You can leave by taking the teleportation gates!</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>Everyone bowed and said to Lu Ming, ” “Brother Lu Ming, you have our teleportation token with you. If you need anything, feel free to send us a message!”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Then, those people left one after another, leaving only Lu Ming and Qing Cang.</p><p>“Senior, I will also be taking my leave…”</p><p>Lu Ming also wanted to leave.</p><p>Back then, when he was captured by the alien race, dandan, bubble, and his other family and friends must have been very worried. After all, it had been more than a hundred years and he could not wait to return and meet them.</p><p>A hundred years was an extremely long time for him. An ordinary person would not have such a long life span in their entire lifetime.</p><p>I wonder how his parents are.</p><p>And how are the others?</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t be in such a hurry to go back. Stay here for a few months. I have something to tell you after a few months!”</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>” A few months? That’ s good!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. More than a hundred years had passed. He did not mind a few months.</p><p>you can take a good look around the lair of Zulong during this time!</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you can take a walk around here. I have to go!”</p><p>Qing Cang said. He then bade farewell to Lu Ming and zu long and left the place.</p><p>Lu Ming and the ancestral Dragon landed in front of a Palace on the huge mountain below. The ancestral Dragon gave Lu Ming a Dragon-shaped token. With this token, Lu Ming could enter and exit anywhere in the lair of Zulong at will.</p><p>After that, the ancestral Dragon entered a Hall, presumably to cultivate, while Lu Ming wandered around.</p><p>This mountain was really huge. It stretched for millions of miles, and there were caves and palaces everywhere.</p><p>Lu Ming walked around casually. He could sense powerful auras in front of many cave abodes and palaces. Many of them were emitting the aura of the heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p>the heaven realm has been passed down from the primordial era, the primordial era, and the ancient era for countless years. The number of experts it has accumulated is also amazing!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>With the help of the great beings from the prison suppression field, they would have the ability to fight against the alien races.</p><p>Lu Ming was walking around when he suddenly heard a violent roar coming from the front. There were people fighting.</p><p>Lu Ming was curious and strode forward.</p><p>There was a huge Palace in front of them. In front of the palace was a square, where two figures were fighting intensely.</p><p>The sword Qi surged!</p><p>“True Emperor realm!”</p><p>From a distance, Lu Ming could sense that the two figures were at the true Emperor realm.</p><p>There were very few true emperors on this mountain. Lu Ming speculated that he should be the disciple of some powerful person.</p><p>“That’s…”</p><p>Lu Ming approached. When he saw the appearance of the two fighting figures, he could not help but be dumbfounded.</p><p>The two of them were acquaintances!</p><p>Moreover, they were two acquaintances who had not seen each other for a long time.</p><p>Profound fragrance, profound peak!</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded. He did not expect to meet Xuan Xiang and Xuan Feng here.</p><p>Back when Lu Ming was still cultivating in the eastern Xuan region of the eastern wilderness, Xuan Xiang and Xuan Feng’s family were exterminated by the sky corpse sect. They were stranded on a small island in the heaven realm because of the ancient barren city.</p><p>On the small island, Lu Ming was surrounded and attacked by the evil god tribe.</p><p>In the end, the Xuan family’s patriarch, Su Xing, killed all the evil god tribe members and brought Lu Ming, Xuan Xiang, and Xuan Feng back to the primordial realm.</p><p>Later on, the patriarch of the Xuan family left with Xuan Xiang and Xuan Feng. Lu Ming had not seen them since.</p><p>Later on, Lu Ming had sent people to search for them in the divine wilderness continent and in the yuan continent. However, there was no news of Xuan Xiang and the rest.</p><p>He had never thought that he would meet Xuan Xiang and the others here.</p><p>it seems that the ancestor of the Xuan family is definitely a terrifying existence!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>With his current knowledge and experience, he could deduce many things.</p><p>The patriarch of the Xuan family was most likely seriously injured in the ancient war with the alien races and fell into the primordial realm with the ancient city of desolation. He was an extremely powerful existence.</p><p>It could be seen from his first encounter with dandan and his attitude towards her.</p><p>At this moment, Xuan Xiang and Xuan Feng also felt that someone was approaching. They stopped and looked over.</p><p>At the sight of Lu Ming, the two of them were stunned. Then, they widened their eyes and their mouths. They were dumbfounded.</p><p>“Lu …Lu Ming…”</p><p>The two of them were very surprised. They did not expect to meet Lu Ming here.</p><p>hahaha, Xuan Xiang, Xuan Feng, long time no see! How are you? ”</p><p>Lu Ming had already reacted. He laughed and flew over.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, it’s really you!”</p><p>Xuan Xiang welcomed him with a face full of smiles.</p><p>“Naturally, it’s me, the real deal!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
