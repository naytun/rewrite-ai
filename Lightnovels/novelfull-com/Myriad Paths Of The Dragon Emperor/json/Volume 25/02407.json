There were more than ten figures standing around Lu Ming.</p><p>More than half of these figures were purple-haired non-human royalty.</p><p>The few people who were at the entrance of the passage earlier were all here. The other alien races also had powerful auras and were terrifying.</p><p>These were the top experts of the evil god tribe. Even the weakest of them had a cultivation base of four star heavenly Emperor or above.</p><p>At that moment, more than a dozen of the foreign kinds were staring at Lu Ming with burning eyes.</p><p>it’s really the sacred ancestor bloodheart. I didn’t expect that the sacred ancestor bloodheart didn’t die in the battle that year. She left behind her Natal bloodline and was reborn in the body of a human. This is really unexpected! An old man sighed.</p><p>This old man was also a member of the royal family, but he was very old. His face was full of wrinkles and his purple hair had lost its luster.</p><p>hahaha, the heavens are really blessing our race. Saint ancestor bloodheart is still alive, and our race will definitely be able to level the heavenly realm, break the realm, and open the sky, achieving Supreme glory!</p><p>that’s right. When the time comes, it’ll be as easy as turning over a hand to flatten the heaven realm. Ancestral Dragon, don’t even think about stopping our tribe!</p><p>The other non-humans were all excited and laughed.</p><p>They were waiting for the sacred ancestor bloodheart to wake up.</p><p>However, at this moment, their expressions changed drastically.</p><p>This was because Lu Ming’s body was emitting another kind of radiance. Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled and a stone tablet appeared, growing rapidly.</p><p>The stone tablet kept shaking and emitted layers of black light that surged toward Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>That’s right, this stele was the prison-guarding stele.</p><p>The light emitted by the prison-suppressing stele gushed into Lu Ming’s body and emitted a terrifying suppressive force, suppressing the blood-red light of the third bloodline.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>The blood-red radiance roared continuously, as if it wanted to destroy Lu Ming and replace him.</p><p>However, the prison-suppressing stele glowed brightly and its suppressing power was extremely strong. It kept suppressing the blood-red Qi.</p><p>The blood-red aura emitted by the third bloodline was suppressed by the prison-suppressing stele’s power. It slowly wriggled and retracted back into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>The blood aura in Lu Ming’s body slowly became thinner.</p><p>More than a dozen outsiders were dumbfounded!</p><p>the prison-guarding stele! It’s the prison-guarding stele! Damn it! Why is the prison-guarding stele in this man’s body? ”</p><p>damn it! I understand now. The prison-suppressing stele is also his bloodline. It’s specially used to suppress the Saint ancestor bloodheart. What a powerful scheme!</p><p>Damn it, let’s take this prison-suppressing stele out!”</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>A dozen foreign kinds shouted.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Three outsiders attacked at the same time. Their cultivation bases were shockingly powerful, and each of them was a five star Celestial Emperor and a six star Celestial Emperor.</p><p>The three of them attacked. Their powers formed a sealing force that enveloped the prison-suppressing stele, trying to separate it from Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele shook violently, and Lu Ming’s body shook slightly.</p><p>“Strip!”</p><p>The three of them roared and exploded with their full power.</p><p>However, at this moment, the prison-suppressing stele suddenly trembled and shone brightly. A terrifying power spread out from the prison-suppressing stele, as if it could suppress the heavens.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The three foreign kinds ‘powerful beings trembled as if they had suffered a terrible attack. They retreated and spat out a mouthful of blood, their faces pale.</p><p>no wonder it’s the prison-guarding stele. That person’s Natal weapon is extraordinary. Even if it’s not complete, the power it contains is still shocking. Let’s attack together!</p><p>A dignified non-human royal family member said.</p><p>“Alright, let’s attack together!”</p><p>The others nodded.</p><p>Immediately, a terrifying aura was emitted from the bodies of the dozen foreign kinds.</p><p>The weakest among them was a four star great emperor, and the strongest was a peak heavenly Emperor. A dozen of them together could sweep across the world.</p><p>At the same time, more than a dozen people attacked together. More than a dozen rays of light turned into a sealing force, trying to seal the prisonsuppressing stele and then strip it out.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele started to shake crazily. Then, it began to grow in size, and a terrifying power burst out from it.</p><p>The strength of this force was actually above that of more than a dozen foreign races.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the end, the prison-suppressing stele suddenly shook, and an even more terrifying power spread out, directly destroying the sealing power of more than a dozen foreign tribes.</p><p>Moreover, more than a dozen foreign people were shaken by the power of the prison-guarding stele and kept retreating. A few of the weaker ones hit the wall of the secret room, their faces pale and blood oozing from their mouths.</p><p>More than a dozen foreign kinds had unsightly expressions.</p><p>With their strength, they could not do anything to the prison-suppressing stele.</p><p>damn it, the power of the prison-guarding stele is too strong. Not to mention us, even an unrivaled master would not be able to extract it, unless it was someone of the same level…</p><p>An old man said with an ugly expression.</p><p>The other people’s faces were a little gloomy. Where could they find people of the same level? could it be that they had to ask the old ancestor to make a move?</p><p>However, the old ancestor had been seriously injured in the battle back then and had been in a deep sleep. How could he make a move now?</p><p>“What do we do?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>there’s only one way to strip the prison-suppressing stele, and that’s to make this kid do it willingly. As long as he cooperates, it’ll be easy to strip the prisonsuppressing stele, and Saint ancestor bloodheart will wake up!</p><p>The dignified non-human Royal clan member said.</p><p>“This kid will cooperate?”</p><p>The others didn’t quite believe it.</p><p>“There’s no other way. We can only wait for him to wake up!”</p><p>The dignified Royal said.</p><p>With no other choice, everyone could only wait.</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele hovered above Lu Ming. Its radiance grew brighter and brighter, forming waves of suppressive force that surged into Lu Ming’s body. The blood-colored mist on Lu Ming’s body slowly faded.</p><p>Lu Ming’s consciousness had fallen into darkness. He seemed to be floating in the darkness. He had no concept of time and did not know how long he had been floating.</p><p>After an unknown period of time, a beam of light shot through the darkness. Lu</p><p>Ming dashed toward the beam of light.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming felt a shock in his head and his consciousness recovered in an instant.</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>that’s right, we discovered that the alien races were trying to open the passage.</p><p>We went to stop them, and a terrifying battle occurred!</p><p>I’ve been borrowing the power of the third bloodline like crazy!</p><p>there s also the Titan Longhorn. I’ve been caught…</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. Everything appeared in his mind.</p><p>dandan, bubbles, Earth One, Thunder one, and the rest, how are they? ”</p><p>“With the Titan Longhorn and the others around, it should be fine, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming was worried and he opened his eyes abruptly.</p><p>What came into view was a secret room. In the secret room, there were pieces of luminous stones inlaid, which illuminated the secret room as if it was daytime.</p><p>A purple-haired middle-aged man with a square face and an imposing manner looked at Lu Ming with his hands behind his back.</p><p>There was no one else other than him.</p><p>“You’re finally awake. You’re Lu Ming, right?”</p><p>The dignified middle-aged man spoke. Even his voice was filled with dignity.</p><p>“Who are you? Wait, you’re from a different race…”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed as he saw a third eye in between the other party’s eyebrows.</p><p>The royal family of the alien race!</p><p>A thought flashed across Lu Ming’s mind.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
