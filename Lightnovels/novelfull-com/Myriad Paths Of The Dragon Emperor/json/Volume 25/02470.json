His third eye shone even brighter. Rays of light burst out and condensed into more and more combat swords, which flew toward Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, a purple sword appeared in his hand. He became one with the sword and turned into a purple stream of light, charging toward Lu Ming.</p><p>He exploded with all his strength and wanted to kill Lu Ming as soon as possible.</p><p>it seems that I’m not a match for a two-star Celestial Emperor with just the strength of my physical body!</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea. Then, he clenched his fist in the air. The purple-gold ruler’s power gathered and turned into a long spear.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming swept his long spear in all directions, and the sword gleam that was slashing at him was shattered.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear collided with the sword radiance of the non-human King and a shocking boom was heard.</p><p>The non-human King’s body trembled violently, and his eyes were filled with horror as he was sent flying by Lu Ming’s slap.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming charged forward with his spear like a bolt of lightning, his speed extremely fast.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The non-human Royal could not avoid it at all. Lu Ming’s spear pierced through his head between his eyebrows.</p><p>A two-star heavenly Emperor from the Royal non-human race had died!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Yi Yang suddenly stood up from his seat, his face full of shock.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was so powerful that he could kill a second level void transformation stage expert.</p><p>One had to know that he himself was only at the second level void transformation.</p><p>The others were also shocked.</p><p>hehe, someone actually expelled such an expert from the ranks of the guards. It seems like someone is very confident!</p><p>The commander of the border city sneered.</p><p>Commander Yi Yang’s expression turned ugly.</p><p>At that moment, he felt a tinge of regret. If he had known that Lu Ming was so powerful, he would have considered it.</p><p>With a helper like Lu Ming, he would definitely be able to rank higher in the commander ranking. Even if he offended commander Rama, it was not unacceptable.</p><p>However, it was too late to regret now.</p><p>“Damnit!”</p><p>Commander Rama’s anger and killing intent soared.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually killed a non-human King, causing him to lose an important general. This time, it would have a huge impact on his attempt to get first place.</p><p>haha, Rama, it seems like your subordinate has challenged someone he shouldn’t have!</p><p>Commander Yu Zhan laughed out loud. Among these people, he was the happiest.</p><p>Of the thirteen commanders, only commander Rama was a threat to him.</p><p>Now that commander Rama had lost a powerful helper, he was naturally happy.</p><p>“Hmph, don’t think that just because I’m short of a guard, I’m not your match!”</p><p>Commander Rama said coldly as his eyes flickered with a fierce light.</p><p>After killing the non-human King, Lu Ming reached out and took his storage bracelet. He did not leave the fighting ring. He glanced at commander Yi Yang coldly, then turned to the king and cupped his fists.”Your Majesty, Lu Ming would like to ask if it is possible for me to challenge a commander now?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s words shocked some of the commanders.</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to challenge the commander?</p><p>Was he trying to ascend to the position of commander?</p><p>Commander Yi Yang was especially shocked. A trace of fear flashed in his eyes.</p><p>He was afraid. He was afraid that Lu Ming would challenge him.</p><p>“Impudent! Who Do You Think You Are? You’re not even a commander’s guard, yet you still want to challenge a commander? this is the commander’s assembly, why aren’t you getting lost!”</p><p>Commander Yi Yang stood up and chided.</p><p>if I remember correctly, the rule of Feng Ming country states that anyone can challenge the commander. As long as they defeat and kill the other party, they can replace the other party’s position. Did I remember wrongly? ”</p><p>Lu Ming cast a glance at commander Yi Yang and said sarcastically.</p><p>haha, of course you can!</p><p>At this moment, monarch Feng Ming laughed out loud.</p><p>He was naturally happy to see the challenges between his subordinates. Only in this way, the strong would replace the weak, and his country of Feng Ming would become stronger and stronger.</p><p>“Which commander do you want to challenge?”</p><p>Asked King Feng Ming.</p><p>Many of the thirteen commanders present became nervous.</p><p>“I want to challenge commander Yi Yang!”</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out his hand and pointed at Yi Yang.</p><p>Yi Yang’s face turned pale and his eyes were filled with fear.</p><p>He could not fathom Lu Ming’s combat strength at all. He had just killed a second level void transformation stage expert.</p><p>He knew that he was stronger than the foreign tribe’s royal family, but not by much. He was not confident that he could defeat Lu Ming.</p><p>“Damnit, damnit!”</p><p>Commander Yi Yang roared in his heart. He was filled with regret. If he had known this would happen, he would not have taken Lu Ming in as his guard.</p><p>He blamed everything on Lu Ming. He did not think about why Lu Ming had challenged him. He felt that everything he had done was right.</p><p>Yi Yang, why aren’t you accepting the challenge? are you afraid of your own guard?”</p><p>The commander of the border city sneered.</p><p>Commander Yi Yang’s face turned red. In the end, he was helpless. He had to fight this battle. Otherwise, he would not be able to survive in Fengming country.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>He leaped onto the fighting ring and looked at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>He held a combat sword in each of his hands. The two combat swords emitted a dark light.</p><p>All of a sudden, commander Yi Yang made his move. He attacked first. His two combat swords turned into two cold venomous snakes and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, his lower body, the snake tail, was like a sharp long sword, stabbing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>When they worked together, it was impossible to guard against.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not need to defend at all. He could just attack.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The long spear vibrated and Lu Ming swept it out.</p><p>The purple-gold spear expanded as it swept out. It became thousands of meters long and crushed towards commander Yi Yang.</p><p>No matter how tricky Yi Yang’s attack was, it was useless. In the face of such a brutal attack, he could only take it head-on.</p><p>The combat sword in his hands slashed continuously. In an instant, he had slashed more than a thousand times, hitting the long spear condensed by Lu Ming’s power of domination and letting out a dense roar.</p><p>But even so, commander Yi Yang was still sent flying by the terrifying power of the spear. His face turned pale.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming stepped on the fighting ring and leaped high into the air. He held the spear with both hands and smashed it down at Yi Yang with the force of Mount Tai.</p><p>A huge spear ray pressed down like a mountain range.</p><p>Commander Yi Yang roared and used all his strength. His body was covered in a layer of green light. The next moment, he actually turned into a huge Python and soared into the sky.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The long spear collided heavily with the Python. The Python screamed and fell off the fighting ring, revealing Yi Yang’s appearance again.</p><p>At this moment, his breathing was weak and he spat out a large mouthful of blood. His face was filled with fear.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming became one with his spear and turned into a spear ray, charging towards Yi Yang.</p><p>“No, no, I admit defeat, I admit defeat…”</p><p>Commander Yi Yang screamed in fear.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s long spear did not stop at all. It pierced through commander Yi Yang.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Commander Yi Yang’s eyes widened and he looked at Lu Ming in horror. Then, he stopped breathing.</p><p>Commander Yi Yang, an expert at the second level void transformation stage, chased Lu Ming away because he was afraid of commander Rama. However, he attracted a fatal disaster for himself.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
