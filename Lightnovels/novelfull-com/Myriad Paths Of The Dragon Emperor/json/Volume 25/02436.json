They had not expected to see such a scene.</p><p>•No, not only the prison guarding stele, but also the soul of the prison guarding stele. Hahaha, it’s really the blessing of our ancestors!”</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele and the soul of the stele have returned. From</p><p>now on, the nine steles are all here!”</p><p>The Masters from the prison suppression field laughed like crazy.</p><p>However, there was a change in Lu Ming’s body at this moment.</p><p>The third bloodline let out a wild roar. The sea of blood was filled with endless blood Qi. Lu Ming’s body was covered in a layer of blood Qi as if it was going to devour him.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele above Lu Ming’s head trembled and emitted an infinite amount of light. Waves of powerful suppressive force suppressed the third bloodline.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The third bloodline trembled violently and exploded with shocking power to fight against the prison-suppressing stele.</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele buzzed and shrunk. It flew back into Lu Ming’s body, suspended above the third bloodline, and suppressed it.</p><p>The third Blood Meridian was finally suppressed by the powerful suppression force and slowly flew back to Lu Ming’s spine, hiding.</p><p>Lu Ming took the opportunity to control the prison-suppressing stele bloodline and made it fly back to his spine.</p><p>The huge prison-guarding stele in front of him also quieted down and</p><p>everything returned to normal.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Little brother, how did you get the prison guarding stele and its soul?”</p><p>Elder Liu looked at Lu Ming with a burning gaze.</p><p>“Prison-guarding stele? Are there many pieces of the prison-suppressing stele?”</p><p>Lu Ming did not answer but asked a question instead.</p><p>there are nine pieces of the prison-guarding stele, one main stele and eight sub steles. They are the Natal treasures of the ancestors of the prison-guarding world. But in the ancient war, the prison-guarding stele was broken, and the soul of the main stele disappeared. Two of the main stele’s fragments disappeared. Now, there are only eight sub steles and one fragment of the main stele in the prison-guarding world. Together, they form a prison-guarding formation to guard the prison-guarding world!</p><p>Elder Liu explained patiently.</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>He didn’t expect there to be nine prison-suppressing steles, one main stele and eight secondary steles.</p><p>The main monument had been shattered, and the two fragments that Lu Ming had obtained were the fragments of the main monument.</p><p>It was no wonder that the prison-suppressing stele had an unusual reaction when Lu Ming came here.</p><p>little brother, how did you get it? you even managed to get the soul of the main monument. We thought that the soul of the main monument had already disappeared!</p><p>Elder Liu continued to ask.</p><p>senior, the soul of the main monument you mentioned was automatically awakened from my body when I was cultivating. It can be considered my bloodline!</p><p>as for the two fragments, I obtained them later by chance!</p><p>Lu Ming explained.</p><p>a bloodline that was awakened from the body? ”</p><p>Elder Liu and the others were all stunned.</p><p>“In my opinion, the soul of the prison-suppressing stele did not dissipate. Instead, it took the opportunity to be reborn from this little brother’s body!” Another white-haired old man from the prison suppression field said.</p><p>This man was also an elder of the prison suppression field, and his cultivation was unfathomable!</p><p>“That’s right, haha, it’s really the blessing of the ancestors!”</p><p>The other people from the prison guard field were all smiling.</p><p>“Little brother, please follow us!”</p><p>Elder Liu smiled gently and then flew toward the depths of the prison suppression field.</p><p>The other people from the prison guard field also followed.</p><p>Lu Ming, Qing Cang, and the rest also joined in.</p><p>Mountains and lakes flew under their feet. They didn’t know how far they had flown, but they had come to the depths of the prison suppression field.</p><p>In front of him, a towering mountain peak appeared.</p><p>At the peak of the mountain, there was also a stone tablet.</p><p>However, this stone tablet was only a fragment. There was only a section of it that stood on the peak of the mountain.</p><p>just like the prison-suppressing stele, this broken stele also shot out a black light into the sky.</p><p>■■This is the other piece of the prison-guarding stele. After combining it with the other two pieces in your body, you will have the complete prison-guarding stele!”</p><p>An elder from the prison suppression field smiled.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were glowing.</p><p>He had never given up on looking for the other fragments of the prisonsuppressing stele. However, after so many years of searching, he had not found any clues. He did not expect that the last fragment would be here.</p><p>Lu Ming could feel that the prison-suppressing stele in his body was shaking non-stop as if it was about to break through the air and leave.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, we have a presumptuous request!”</p><p>Elder Liu looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Senior, please speak?” Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>the nine prison-guarding steles are the Natal treasures of the ancestors of the prison-guarding world. In the ancient war, the ancestors fought against the enemy and died, leaving only the prison-guarding steles to guard our line. However, the nine prison-guarding steles are incomplete and can’t be used to their full power!</p><p>on behalf of the prison-guarding field, I would like to ask Lu Ming to return the prison-guarding stele to the prison-guarding lineage so that the nine steles can be combined into one. This way, the nine prison-guarding steles can be fully utilized! he said.</p><p>Elder Liu said.</p><p>“As expected!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>When elder Liu had said that he had a presumptuous request, he had already guessed that the other party would make this request.</p><p>The other people from the prison suppression field looked at Lu Ming with hope.</p><p>“Senior, please forgive me for not being able to agree to this condition!” Lu Ming smiled bitterly and said.</p><p>“You can’t agree?”</p><p>Elder Liu’s face changed slightly, ” Lu Ming, you’ve saved Wu tai and the others. By right, we can’t make such a request of you. However, the prison guarding stele is too important to us. Please return it. We of the prison guarding lineage will definitely compensate you accordingly. If you have any conditions, please state them!</p><p>“Senior, that’s not what I meant. It’s really difficult to return it!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head.</p><p>Elder Liu’s face looked a bit ugly, and so did the others from the prison suppression field.</p><p>kid, you don’t know what’s good for you. Elder Liu said he would compensate you. Besides, the prison-suppressing stele belongs to the prison-suppressing branch. You have to hand it over!</p><p>A burly man in the crowd shouted.</p><p>“What did you just say? Shut up!”</p><p>Wu tai shouted coldly as he looked at the man.</p><p>Lu Ming was Mrs. Wu’s Savior. He was naturally unhappy that this person threatened Lu Ming.</p><p>“What’s wrong? The prison suppression field wants to take it by force?</p><p>Qing Cang also spoke coldly, exuding a powerful aura that made one’s heart tremble.</p><p>“Everyone, please don’t misunderstand!</p><p>Elder Liu smiled bitterly, then turned to the burly man who had just spoken, ” “Brother Lu Ming, you are an important guest of the prison guardians. Watch your words!”</p><p>“Yes, elder!”</p><p>The burly man’s face was a little pale. He nodded repeatedly and did not dare to speak.</p><p>However, most of the people from the prison-suppressing field were still looking at Lu Ming longingly. Obviously, the prison-suppressing stele was very important to them.</p><p>senior, it’s not that I’m stingy and unwilling to return the prison-suppressing stele. I have my own difficulties!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
