He charged forward and clawed at Lu Ming.</p><p>A terrifying force pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>It was obvious that this person was a powerhouse of the heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. He threw ao Luan away and retreated rapidly, avoiding the middle-aged man’s attack.</p><p>sixth uncle, teach him a lesson! Teach him a lesson!</p><p>Ao Luan stabilized his body and roared.</p><p>The middle-aged man looked at Lu Ming and said,”Little brother, you look so young, but your cultivation is so profound. I really admire you. I’m also very excited to see a prey. Little brother, why don’t you accompany me for a few moves?”</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. After hitting the young one, the old one would come out.</p><p>He had only used his physical strength and showed that he was a peak Emperor. On the other hand, the middle-aged man was a heavenly Emperor. Although he was a one-star heavenly Emperor, he was far above peak great emperors. Now that he asked Lu Ming to exchange a few moves with him, it was obvious that he was bullying him.</p><p>However, it was just a one-star heavenly Emperor. Why would Lu Ming be afraid?</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled into an inexplicable smile. He nodded and said,”Very well, since senior has invited me, how could this junior dare to refuse?”</p><p>“You agree?”</p><p>The middle-aged man and the two old men were stunned.</p><p>They initially thought that Lu Ming would not dare to accept the challenge and would back off in the face of difficulties, giving up on entering the Dragon essence pool. They did not expect Lu Ming to actually agree.</p><p>A cold glint flashed in the depths of the middle-aged man’s eyes. He would take this opportunity to teach Lu Ming a lesson.</p><p>Lu Ming was chosen by the ancestral Dragon. Naturally, he did not dare to have the intention to kill Lu Ming. However, it was fine to teach him a lesson.</p><p>haha, little brother, you’re so heroic. Pay attention!</p><p>The middle-aged man smiled and suddenly took a step forward. His body rushed towards Lu Ming at an astonishing speed. He then clawed at Lu Ming.</p><p>He had used eighty percent of his power in this claw attack. It was almost certain that he could take down a peak Emperor.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming also threw a punch at the middle-aged man.</p><p>he actually dared to take it head-on. What a hothead!</p><p>The middle-aged man said in disdain.</p><p>A peak great emperor actually dared to fight a heavenly Emperor head-on. If this wasn’t stupidity, then what was?</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The two attacks collided.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s fist emitted a dazzling purple-gold radiance.</p><p>The Dao of a ruler!</p><p>The moment the two of them collided, Lu Ming burst out with the path of domination.</p><p>The middle-aged man’s expression changed instantly. His eyes popped out and he looked extremely shocked.</p><p>at this moment, he sensed an incomparably terrifying power surging toward him. At this critical moment, he unleashed all his strength, but it was too late.</p><p>With a violent boom, the middle-aged man’s body was like a broken sack, flying out for thousands of miles before he could stabilize his body. He spat out a mouthful of blood, and one of his arms was bent beyond recognition.</p><p>What?</p><p>On the side, ao Luan and the two old men were all stunned.</p><p>One move!</p><p>Lu Ming had only used one move to send the middle-aged man flying and spitting blood.</p><p>The middle-aged man was a heavenly Emperor.</p><p>The few of them couldn’t wrap their heads around it.</p><p>Lu Ming was not surprised at all. When he used his ruler’s power, it was enough to suppress or even kill a one-star Celestial Emperor. Just now, the middle- aged man had been careless and naturally was not Lu Ming’s match.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The middle-aged man bellowed and transformed into a true dragon. A vast Dragon’s might spread out and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>He did not believe that he would not be able to take down Lu Ming even if he used all his strength.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation base was clearly only at the great emperor realm.</p><p>The huge Dragon’s body pounced on Lu Ming’s head in an instant.</p><p>“You’re really looking for a beating!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. His entire body was shrouded in purple-gold light, like a god who ruled the world.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>He turned into a purple-gold light and charged at his opponent. At the same time, the purple-gold light condensed into a long spear.</p><p>This was a spear condensed from the Dao of domination. It was firm, immortal, and indestructible.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming pulled his gun.</p><p>This spear not only contained the power of the way of domination, but also the power of the physical body.</p><p>The middle-aged man bellowed. The Dragon horns on his head glowed with a brilliant light. Two beams of divine light shot out and slashed at Lu Ming like heavenly blades.</p><p>At the same time, he struck out with his dragon claws continuously, which converged into a Golden Dragon Claw and clawed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Several attacks were launched at the same time. The middle-aged man had used all his strength.</p><p>However, when his attack collided with Lu Ming’s long spear, his expression changed.</p><p>His attacks continued to crumble while Lu Ming’s long spear crushed his attacks as easily as breaking dry weeds and smashing rotten wood, lashing out at him.</p><p>The middle-aged man’s dragon body shrank rapidly as he retreated frantically However, he could not avoid Lu Ming’s attack and was struck by Lu Ming’s long spear at the waist.</p><p>The middle-aged man let out a blood-curdling screech as his body was sent flying tens of thousands of miles away. He crashed into a barren mountain, causing smoke and dust to fill the air.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss…</p><p>Ao Luan and the two old men took in a cold breath.</p><p>This time, the middle-aged man could be said to have used all his strength. However, he was still sent flying by Lu Ming’s spear. He was completely crushed.</p><p>Where did this young man come from? his strength was too shocking.</p><p>They only reacted after a long time.</p><p>“It’s just sparring, you’re too heavy-handed!”</p><p>One of the old men said coldly.</p><p>“He didn’t die!”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips and did not take it to heart.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>The old man’s face was gloomy.</p><p>“Alright, I’m done!”</p><p>At this moment, a voice rang out. It was the ancestral Dragon’s voice. It came</p><p>from the palace. Then, a figure appeared in the sky.</p><p>This figure wasn’t a real entity, but a projection of the ancestral Dragon.</p><p>“We pay our respects to the ancestor!”</p><p>Ao Luan and the two old men’s expressions changed. They stood up and saluted.</p><p>Lu Ming is someone I have my eyes on. Do you have any objections to my decision? ”</p><p>The ancestral Dragon glanced at ao Luan and the two old men.</p><p>Their expressions changed drastically, and they hurriedly lowered their heads.</p><p>“I don’t dare, I don’t dare!”</p><p>“Are you doubting my judgment of people?”</p><p>Zu long said.</p><p>No, patriarch, absolutely not. Patriarch’s eyes are like torches!”</p><p>The two old men quickly said.</p><p>Ao Luan also didn’t dare to make a sound.</p><p>If Lu Ming was really a good-for-nothing, he would fight for the Dragon essence Pool no matter what. However, the strength that Lu Ming had just displayed was too shocking. Needless to say, Lu Ming had killed a celestial Thearch in seconds. It was too terrifying.</p><p>let me tell you. Lu Ming has been cultivating for less than two hundred years!</p><p>Zu long said.</p><p>“What… What? Less than two hundred years?”</p><p>This time, ao Luan and the two old men were almost scared to death.</p><p>They would never doubt that the ancestral Dragon would lie to them.</p><p>Heavens, he had cultivated for less than 200 years, and he was able to crush a heavenly Emperor. What kind of monster was this?</p><p>There was actually such a person in the world?</p><p>No wonder the ancestral Dragon had chosen Lu Ming to Enter the Dragon essence pool. Ao Luan was submissive now and did not dare to make a single sound.</p><p>Compared to Lu Ming, he was simply trash.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
