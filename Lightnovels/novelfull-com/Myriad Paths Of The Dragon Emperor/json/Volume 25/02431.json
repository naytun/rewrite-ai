Without a doubt, Lu Ming was called up again.</p><p>Lu Ming did not use the way of domination. He only used his physical strength and a part of the world’s energy to fight with a one-star celestial Thearch for hundreds of moves.</p><p>“I’ve broken through!”</p><p>Duo Lei’s eyes flickered. He could naturally tell that Lu Ming had a breakthrough.</p><p>However, even if Lu Ming broke through, he was only at the great emperor realm. He did not care much about it.</p><p>In his opinion, Lu Ming’s physical strength was too strong. Even if he had a breakthrough in the laws, it would not increase his overall combat strength by much.</p><p>After more than a day, the duel ended. Lu Ming and the rest returned to their respective stone rooms.</p><p>After returning to the stone room, Lu Ming waited quietly. After a few hours, Lu Ming opened the stone door and went to Qing Gang’s stone room.</p><p>When he arrived at the Qing Cang stone room, he found that there was another big man in the room.</p><p>This burly man did not know that Lu Ming and the rest’s plan was invited by Qing Cang.</p><p>Not long after, Mrs. Wu also arrived at Qing Gang’s stone room with two people.</p><p>“Wu tai, old brother Qing Cang, why did you call us here?”</p><p>The two men who came with Mrs. Wu asked.</p><p>These two people didn’t know the specific plan.</p><p>“We’re looking for you guys, just come with us!”</p><p>Qing Cang said. Then, he walked out of the stone room first, followed by Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>The few of them were very curious but they did not ask much. They followed Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Lu Ming and the group entered a passageway and strolled around casually, heading to the periphery of the eternal cage.</p><p>At this moment, many people began to take action. Those who knew the plan invited one, two, or three people. They strolled around casually and headed to the place where Lu Ming and the rest had agreed on.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest turned left and right, bypassing a few passages, and came to a relatively large stone room.</p><p>This stone chamber was the outermost one. If one walked through the passage outside the stone chamber, they would reach the edge of the restriction.</p><p>When Lu Ming and the rest arrived, there were already a few people waiting there.</p><p>As time passed, more and more people arrived.</p><p>A moment later, there were a total of 133 people.</p><p>Among the one hundred and thirty-three people, there were a total of three hundred people who wore chain armors on their bodies, indicating that they were all heavenly Emperor realm existences.</p><p>Only thirty of them were below the heavenly Emperor level.</p><p>“Everyone, why did you bring us here?”</p><p>Someone else asked. Those who were invited here were also very curious.</p><p>Qing Cang and the others didn’t answer.</p><p>“Everyone’s here, let’s go!”</p><p>Qing Cang said as he walked away.</p><p>The people who were invited were even more curious.</p><p>However, those who were invited were usually very close to someone, so they didn’t ask much and just followed Qing Cang.</p><p>Gradually, they approached the entrance of the passage. They could even see the light barrier outside through the passage.</p><p>“Do you want to escape?”</p><p>Finally, someone guessed what Lu Ming and the rest were up to. Their expressions changed drastically.</p><p>There was no way to break this restriction. Furthermore, those above the heavenly Emperor level were all wearing chain armors that sealed their cultivation. It was impossible for them to escape.</p><p>If he tried to force his way through, he would only die.</p><p>“Do you want to die?”</p><p>Some people were a little anxious.</p><p>would we do that if we weren’t confident? just follow us!</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>Many people’s faces became extremely solemn and uncertain.</p><p>They hadn’t expected that Qing Cang and the others would actually try to escape.</p><p>For countless years, no one had managed to escape.</p><p>” What are you guys trying to do?”</p><p>At this moment, a loud roar came from the passage entrance, and a burly figure appeared.</p><p>It was a foreign being wearing blood-red armor and had a powerful aura.</p><p>Everyone’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>Usually, there were no foreign races in this passageway.</p><p>Because the non-humankind was very confident in their inhibition formations, the security was very loose. There was no non-humankind guarding this place at all.</p><p>Today, a foreign being had actually appeared. Moreover, it seemed that his cultivation was very profound. He was a foreign being in the heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p>Unlucky, he was really too unlucky.</p><p>Qing Cang, Wu tai, and the others ‘faces turned extremely ugly.</p><p>A heavenly Emperor alien, this is troublesome.</p><p>Qing Cang could tell that this was a one-star heavenly Emperor.</p><p>It should be known that those above the heavenly Emperor realm all wore chain armors. Only those below the heavenly Emperor realm did not wear armor.</p><p>They couldn’t do anything to this heavenly Emperor, and once he made a scene and alerted duo Lei, everything would be over.</p><p>All his plans would be ruined.</p><p>Many people who knew the plan were burning with anxiety.</p><p>What to do?</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a figure burst out and charged toward the non-human heavenly Emperor.</p><p>It was Lu Ming!</p><p>Lu Ming took action immediately. At this moment, there was nothing to hesitate about. They could only escape after killing this alien. Otherwise, they would all be finished.</p><p>Lu Ming’s speed was shockingly fast. His entire body was covered in a purple glow. He used all his strength the moment he attacked, using The Way of the Master.</p><p>In the process of rushing out, the great desolation spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hands. Lu Ming burst out with all his strength, becoming one with the spear, and stabbed at the alien celestial Thearch.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>The non-human celestial Thearch’s pupils contracted sharply. He felt a fatal threat from Lu Ming’s attack.</p><p>It was unbelievable that a great emperor could give him such a feeling.</p><p>However, he didn’t have time to think. He roared and used all his power to form layers of defense.</p><p>As long as he could block this move and escape in the other direction, he would spread the news of what had happened here. Lu Ming and the rest would be finished and he would be able to make a contribution.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming’s attack had already arrived.</p><p>The alien’s expression changed.</p><p>This was because the defense that he had set up could not withstand Lu Ming’s attack at all.</p><p>Wherever the spear radiance passed, all his defenses collapsed instantly.</p><p>“No, no, how is that possible…”</p><p>The non-human celestial Thearch roared in his heart.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>A long spear pierced through the void and pierced through his forehead.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The spear trembled, and the non-human heavenly Emperor was torn into pieces.</p><p>He was dead!</p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded and completely stunned.</p><p>A one-star heavenly Emperor was killed by Lu Ming in one move.</p><p>Oh my God, what kind of strength was this?</p><p>Lu Ming was only at the great emperor realm, but he was able to kill a one-star heavenly Emperor with one move. His combat strength was too terrifying.</p><p>In fact, this was normal.</p><p>The Dominator’s Dao was too powerful. Lu Ming’s world Energy even contained a trace of purple-gold energy. Lu Ming called it the Dominator’s energy.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming did not need a physical body. He felt that he could kill a one-star celestial Thearch with the law system alone.</p><p>Just now, with the addition of his physical strength and the power of the great desolation spear, it was not surprising that he could kill a one-star celestial Thearch in a second.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>After killing the alien celestial Thearch, Lu Ming did not stop and rushed out of the passage.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
