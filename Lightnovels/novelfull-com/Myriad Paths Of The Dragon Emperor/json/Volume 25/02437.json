If little brother has any difficulties, you can tell us. My clan of prison guardians will definitely do our best to help!”</p><p>Elder Liu said.</p><p>“Seniors, do you know of the Saint ancestor bloodheart?” Lu Ming asked after a moment of silence.</p><p>“What? Saint ancestor bloodheart!”</p><p>Elder Liu cried out in shock, his eyes filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>“How could the Guardians of the prison not know of sacred ancestor bloodheart?”</p><p>The other people from the prison suppression field also showed cold killing intent, as if they had an irreconcilable hatred.</p><p>“Little brother, could this matter be related to Saint ancestor bloodheart?”</p><p>Elder Liu asked.</p><p>in addition to the prison-suppressing stele bloodline, I’ve also awakened another bloodline, which is probably related to Saint ancestor bloodheart!</p><p>With that, Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. His third bloodline flew out, exuding a cold killing intent.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, everyone from the prison suppression field released a terrifying aura that shot up into the sky like smoke.</p><p>“What shocking strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>There were too many experts among the people from the prison suppression field. Lu Ming even felt a few auras that were not weaker than Qing Gang’s.</p><p>The aura of a peak heavenly Emperor!</p><p>It was terrifying, and this might only be part of the strength of the prison suppression field.</p><p>No wonder the prison realm could fight with the alien races for so many years and hold back part of their Army. Their strength was amazing.</p><p>”Saint ancestor bloodheart!”</p><p>it’s really the sacred ancestor bloodheart! She’s not dead yet!</p><p>The people from the prison suppression field kept exclaiming and didn’t hide their cold killing intent.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat, and the third Blood Meridian flew back into his body.</p><p>Elder Liu was deeply shocked. He let out a long breath and calmed down.</p><p>I understand now. I finally understand why the soul of the prison-guarding stele would awaken in your body!</p><p>Elder Liu said as realization dawned on him.</p><p>“Senior, who is the sacred ancestor bloodheart?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>Saint ancestor bloodheart is a terrifying expert. He’s a Supreme expert who can slaughter the world!</p><p>Liu changlai spoke, as if he was reminiscing, and a look of fear flashed across his eyes.</p><p>in the ancient times, a Great war broke out. The foreign races attacked the heaven realm. The ancestor of the prison guard lineage was also a human and naturally opposed it. That was the Great War!</p><p>it’s said that the few Supreme powerhouses in the world were divided into two camps and fought each other. The ancestors of the prison-guarding lineage stood on the side of the heavenly realm and the human race, while the sacred ancestor of the killing heart stood on the side of the alien race!</p><p>in the ancient times, my ancestor and sacred ancestor bloodheart fought a great battle. The battle was earth-shattering, and even the prison-suppressing stele was broken. In the end, my ancestor and sacred ancestor bloodheart died together!</p><p>now it seems that the sacred ancestor bloodheart has not been completely annihilated. She still left a trace of her bloodline and has been reborn in your body, hoping to awaken again. However, the ancestor obviously held back and let the soul of the prison-suppressing stele be reborn in your body to suppress the bloodline of the sacred ancestor bloodheart!</p><p>Elder Liu explained.</p><p>“That’s right, it should be like this!”</p><p>The other people from the prison suppression field also nodded.</p><p>“I see, I see!”</p><p>Lu Ming had a sudden realization.</p><p>He had always felt that his two bloodlines were very mysterious and did not know where they came from. Now, he finally understood.</p><p>This was a game between two Supreme powerhouses that spanned hundreds of millions of years. It was just that the battlefield had changed, and it had changed into his body.</p><p>Lu Ming’s back broke out in a cold sweat. In that case, he was really in constant danger. If not for the prison-suppressing stele, he would have been devoured by the third bloodline long ago.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming also thought of a problem.</p><p>When he wanted to break through to the martial Royal realm, he needed to merge a bloodline with his body and turn it into a spiritual body. Fortunately, he had chosen the nine Dragons bloodline. If he had chosen the prisonsuppressing stele or the third bloodline, he would not have succeeded at all.</p><p>seniors, I can’t return the prison-suppressing stele now. If I do, I’m afraid Saint ancestor bloodheart will be revived!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly.</p><p>“Al!”</p><p>Elder Liu sighed, if that’s the case, then don’t return it. We can’t let the sacred ancestor murderheart be reborn. Otherwise, the divine ancestor and the sacred ancestor murderheart will work together. Not only our prison-guarding lineage, but the heaven realm will also be destroyed!</p><p>The others from the prison guard field nodded.</p><p>They still knew the severity of the situation.</p><p>Anyway, the prison-guarding formation formed by the prison-guarding stele could still resist the attacks of the alien races, so there was no hurry.</p><p>however, the bloodline of the sacred ancestor bloodheart is also a great disaster. We should find a way to completely destroy it. That’s the right way!</p><p>Elder Liu said.</p><p>“Senior, do you have any ideas?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Although he could borrow the power of the third bloodline to greatly increase his strength and turn the tide at a critical moment, he could not do anything.</p><p>However, that was a time bomb. If he could get rid of it, Lu Ming would rather not have that kind of power.</p><p>the Saint ancestor murderheart is a Supreme expert who has surpassed the heavenly Emperor. In ancient times, such an expert was called the ancestral Emperor. He has stepped into a completely different level of existence. He is so powerful that the heavenly Emperor realm can’t even hope to catch up with him. Even if it’s just a trace of his bloodline, I’m afraid that the heavenly Emperor realm can’t destroy it!</p><p>“It’s only possible if we get someone on the same level as the Holy ancestor bloodheart to attack!”</p><p>Elder Liu said.</p><p>“An existence on the same level as the Saint ancestor bloodheart?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly. Where could he find such an existence?</p><p>the ancestor Dragon of the heaven realm is a Supreme Master. If you can return to the heaven realm, you will have a way!</p><p>Qing Cang said.</p><p>“The ancestral Dragon?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>“Everyone, you’d better stay here first and think of a way in the future!”</p><p>Elder Liu laughed.</p><p>They left immediately and went to an ancient city in the depths of the prison realm. Elder Liu had arranged a place for them to stay.</p><p>Lu Ming stayed there and cultivated in peace.</p><p>The evil god tribe had ten Royal tribes, and all of them had the bloodline closest to that of the non-human divine ancestor. Each of them was high and mighty, and they ruled over their own territories.</p><p>However, there were also differences in strength among the ten royal families.</p><p>Among them, the strongest royal family was called the first royal family.</p><p>For example, the first Prince, who was ranked first on the longevity Roll, was a Prince of the first royal family.</p><p>In the main hall of the first royal family’s Palace, they were discussing something.</p><p>The king of the first royal family was sitting at the top of the hall.</p><p>On both sides of the hall, the Kings of the other nine royal families sat.</p><p>The Kings of the ten great royal families had gathered.</p><p>“Everyone, Lu Ming has escaped into the prison suppression field. What should we do now?”</p><p>A non-human King said.</p><p>Hmph, that duo Lei is really a piece of trash. I let him guard the eternal cage, but he actually let someone escape. I really want to kill him with a slap!</p><p>Another non-human King shouted coldly.</p><p>now is not the time to blame anyone. We have to figure out how to deal with it. That Lu Ming has the bloodline of the sacred ancestor bloodheart. We have to take him down and awaken the sacred ancestor bloodheart. This is related to our clan’s grand plan!</p><p>The king of the number one royal family spoke from the highest point.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
