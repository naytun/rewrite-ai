The only ones that had changed were Luo mo and Yu Zhan, as well as Lu Ming who had killed Yi Yang and replaced his position.</p><p>alright, the General Assembly has ended. My beloved subjects, please enjoy your meal!</p><p>Country ruler Feng Ming smiled and ordered his men to serve all sorts of delicacies.</p><p>It wasn’t until the next day that the crowd dispersed.</p><p>Lu Ming brought bambu and Liao min back to the governor’s manor.</p><p>Throughout the journey, bin bu was trembling with fear, afraid that Lu Ming would find trouble with him.</p><p>“This subordinate pays his respects to the commander!”</p><p>The moment he returned to the governor’s manor, he saw the other guards leading the people from the governor’s manor to welcome Lu Ming respectfully.</p><p>Obviously, they had already received the news that Yi Yang had died in Lu Ming’s hands and that Lu Ming had inherited the position of commander. “Everyone, there’s no need to be so polite. I’ll still need to rely on you to do things for me in the future!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“I’m willing to die for the commander!”</p><p>Bleu was one step ahead.</p><p>I m willing to die for the commander!”</p><p>The others also shouted.</p><p>“Alright, we’ll stay in the imperial capital for now. You guys go help me with something. Send people to find these three-eyed people!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out a jade talisman. The Jade talisman glowed and many pictures appeared in the air.</p><p>These pictures were the appearances of the different races of the foreign races. “When you find these people, don’t beat the grass and alert the snake. Come back and report to me!”</p><p>Lu Ming instructed.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Everyone bowed and Lu Ming dismissed them.</p><p>Lu Ming picked a room. After he entered the room, a storage ring appeared in his hand.</p><p>This storage ring belonged to Yi Yang.</p><p>Lu Ming was looking forward to it. He wondered how many resources Yi Yang had in his storage ring.</p><p>Lu Ming’s spiritual senses entered and he began to count.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming’s face broke into a smile.</p><p>Three million divine stones!</p><p>There were three million divine stones in Yi Yang’s storage ring, which was equivalent to 300 billion Supreme-grade raw stones.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. These resources were enough for him to break through to the four star great emperor realm, or even the five star great emperor realm. However, Yi Yang’s storage ring didn’t have any combat weapons that were equivalent to the heavenly Dao soldiers. There were only weapons that were equivalent to great emperor weapons.</p><p>It seemed that weapons that were equivalent to heaven Dao soldiers were relatively precious even in netherworld mountain.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was already quite satisfied.</p><p>Next, he only needed to send people to search for the alien races. If they could be killed, Lu Ming would kill them directly.</p><p>However, it would be more troublesome to find living beings from the heaven realm.</p><p>The creatures of the heaven realm were closer to the creatures of netherworld mountain. Unless he met them in person and could sense the aura of the heaven realm on them, it would be difficult for others to find them.</p><p>Also, Lu Ming wanted to find out more about the cursed land in the capital of Fengming. He wanted to find an opportunity to enter it.</p><p>However, these things could not be rushed. He had to take it one step at a time.</p><p>Lu Ming closed his eyes and began to cultivate.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed. Lu Ming ended his cultivation and walked out.</p><p>However, after Lu Ming walked around for a while, he felt a little strange.</p><p>The number of people in the governor’s manor had decreased.</p><p>At that moment, a figure flashed and Liao min appeared not far away.</p><p>“Greetings, commander!”</p><p>Liao min saluted, but her expression was not good.</p><p>“What’s wrong, Liao min? Why do I feel that the number of people in the governor’s manor has decreased by a lot?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Commander, something has happened!”</p><p>Liao min said with an ugly expression.</p><p>“Oh? What happened?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked, his expression still calm.</p><p>some time ago, commander Rama released news that you killed his trusted guard. He won’t let you off so easily. He’ll kill you sooner or later!</p><p>Liao min said.</p><p>“And then?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression remained calm. One could not tell what he was thinking. “After that, rama continued to say that the fault lies with you and it has nothing to do with the other people in the governor’s manor. As long as the others submit to him, he would let bygones be bygones and entrust them with heavy responsibilities!”</p><p>Liao min answered.</p><p>“And then, those people all ran to Rama?”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile. However, there was a cold glint in the depths of his eyes.</p><p>that’s right. Bleu was the first to join Rama. During this period of time he has been encouraging others to join him. Now, 10 out of the 18 guards have joined Rama!</p><p>Liao min gritted her teeth and said.</p><p>“Hehe, Rama…”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>He didn’t want to go too far, but some people were forcing him.</p><p>At this moment, outside the governor’s manor, a clamor suddenly rang out Lu Ming extended his spiritual sense out and saw a group of people surrounding the entrance of the governor’s manor.</p><p>Bleu was one of the few people in the lead.</p><p>In addition, there were a few people who were the guards under Rama.</p><p>Lu Ming’s subordinates and a few guards stopped them at the door.</p><p>“You people are still so stubborn. Are you following Lu Ming to your deaths?”</p><p>Bleu glanced at the guards and sneered.</p><p>The guards ‘expressions were ugly and they were hesitating.</p><p>as the leader of the 13 commanders, commander Rama is very powerful. Lu Ming can’t compare to him at all. Lu Ming will die sooner or later for offending commander Rama. If you continue to follow him, you’ll only be sending yourselves to your deaths. A wise man submits to circumstances. You’d better submit to commander Rama as soon as possible!</p><p>Bleu continued.</p><p>“Bleu, you traitor!”</p><p>Liao min couldn’t stand it anymore. She rushed out and scolded.</p><p>“Traitor? What a joke. Lu Ming is going to die. Why should I accompany him to his death? Liao min, you’d better quickly submit to Lord Rama. I can put in a few good words for you and get you a job. Otherwise, you’ll end up in a miserable state!”</p><p>Bleu sneered as he scanned Liao min with a pair of fiery eyes.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Liao min was furious, and her face turned red.</p><p>I’ll give you one last chance. You only have three days. If you don’t surrender to</p><p>Lord Rama after three days, you’ll die with Lu Ming!</p><p>Bleu said coldly.</p><p>“Oh, really? I’d like to see what you’re capable of!”</p><p>A cold voice was heard. Lu Ming stepped out.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>At the sight of Lu Ming, Bleu’s eyes narrowed. He subconsciously took a few steps back, his eyes filled with fear.</p><p>However, the next moment, he thought of something. His courage grew and he stopped.</p><p>“Bleu, I’ve already given you a chance. It’s a pity that you didn’t cherish it!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly, his body exuding a cold murderous intent.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what do you want to do? I’m now Lord Rama’s guard. You dare to touch me? You ‘re looking for death!”</p><p>Bleu shouted.</p><p>“Didn’t I already kill one of Rama’s guards?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Bleu’s expression changed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Lord Rama has spoken. If you go and beg for his forgiveness now, then join him and work for him, he might consider sparing you! ”</p><p>One of the Romo guards beside Bleu said.</p><p>This person had the cultivation base of a one-star heavenly Emperor.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
