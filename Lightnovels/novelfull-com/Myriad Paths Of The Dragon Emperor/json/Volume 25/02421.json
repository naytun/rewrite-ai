It is inherited from the bloodline. Once swallowed, the only thing you can do is burn to ashes!</p><p>look at how arrogant that kid is. He’s dead for sure!</p><p>Those alien races were discussing with great joy.</p><p>Not far away, Jia Yi’s eyes flashed. He wanted to help but he knew that there were many Kings watching from the sky. If the Kings did not ask him to help, he would naturally not help.</p><p>In the depths of the sky, the various Kings were indeed watching.</p><p>what should we do? should we save him? he has the bloodline of the sacred ancestor bloodheart. He can’t die!</p><p>A non-human King said.</p><p>I think we’ll see. With the bloodline of the sacred ancestor bloodheart in him, I don’t think he’ll die so easily!</p><p>“Not bad, let’s take a look!”</p><p>The other non-human Kings nodded. They thought that it would be better to let</p><p>Lu Ming beg for mercy.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming was swallowed into the incinerating furnace, he felt endless flames engulfing him and burning fiercely. The terrifying high temperature was about to burn him into ashes.</p><p>Lu Ming covered his entire body with the 81 types of laws. At the same time, he circulated the indestructible ancient scroll to resist the burning power from the outside.</p><p>However, the flames were indeed terrifying. Their power was too shocking.</p><p>Even if there were many nomological laws intertwined together, they would still be burned.</p><p>One law after another was burned through.</p><p>It was not that Lu Ming’s law was not powerful. It was just that compared to their current combat strength, the law was slightly inferior.</p><p>One had to know that the great emperor realm corresponded to the great Dao.</p><p>Thus, even a profound law like the law of fate would find it difficult to display its profound effects at this time. It would also be burned through.</p><p>Through the laws, a terrifying heat flow coursed through Lu Ming’s entire body. His muscles were on the verge of being burned. Waves of piercing pain spread throughout Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>The clothes and hair on his body instantly turned to dust.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the indestructible ancient scroll to resist the attack with all his might.</p><p>Now, the indestructible ancient scroll’s recovery ability was even more shocking. After his muscles were burned, they immediately recovered and were as white as Jade.</p><p>Lu Ming relied on the indestructible ancient scroll to persevere.</p><p>this furnace is indeed powerful, but it can’t do anything to me. I can use the flames here to temper my body!</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile on his face.</p><p>In the past hundred years, there were not many good natural treasures. Lu Ming had been cultivating his physical body and his Seven Gods mysterious technique had been progressing step by step. He had also reached the limit of the middle fifth stage, but he had been stuck at a bottleneck. This time, he might be able to find an opportunity to break through.</p><p>Lu Ming reduced the power of the indestructible ancient scroll slightly and used some flames to help temper his body.</p><p>Chi Chi Chi…</p><p>Some flames spread all over Lu Ming’s body. The terrifyingly high temperature seeped into Lu Ming’s bones, internal organs, and even every cell, wanting to burn Lu Ming into ashes.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the seven Gods mysterious technique and began to temper his body.</p><p>Just like that, three hours passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Outside, countless beings of the foreign races were waiting patiently for the furnace in the sky.</p><p>“That kid, has he been refined?”</p><p>it’s been three hours. If an ordinary master of the same level as Kang duo was sucked into the furnace, he would be refined in less than half an hour!</p><p>“But Kang duo didn’t stop. That kid shouldn’t have been refined yet!”</p><p>“It’s been so long, will Kang duo be unable to hold on?”</p><p>Many alien races started to discuss among themselves. They were confused.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another two hours had passed. It had been five hours since Lu Ming was sucked into the furnace.</p><p>‘1 Eh? Why is the power of the flames weakening? and it1 s getting weaker!</p><p>In the furnace, Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>“It seems that maintaining the high temperature of the furnace also requires energy. That condo, he can’t hold on any longer!”</p><p>Lu Ming made a guess.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was satisfied.</p><p>After five hours of tempering, Lu Ming’s body had made great progress.</p><p>He felt that his physical body could break through at any time.</p><p>Once he broke through to the late-stage of the fifth level of the seven Gods mysterious art, he would be able to suppress peak emperors with his body alone.</p><p>In addition to the power of the world and the 81 laws, Lu Ming’s combat strength would skyrocket.</p><p>Another half an hour passed and the power of the flames in the furnace became weaker. It was not of much use to Lu Ming’s tempering.</p><p>“Time to go out!”</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. He held the great desolation spear and rushed to one side.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming thrust his spear and it hit the wall of the furnace. The furnace shook violently.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming burst out with all his might and attacked continuously. The furnace shook even more violently as if it was going to explode.</p><p>Outside, all the foreign kinds were shocked.</p><p>not good! That brat isn’t dead! He’s attacking the furnace!</p><p>how terrifying! He’s still alive after so long! What kind of freak is that kid? ”</p><p>“The furnace can’t hold on any longer!”</p><p>Many alien races were shocked.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The furnace shook violently. From the outside, one could see that one side of the wall of the furnace was bulging. Finally, cracks covered the wall.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the end, the entire furnace exploded, and waves of heat swept in all directions.</p><p>A shrill cry reverberated in all directions, and everyone saw Kang duo’s body flying far away. His face was pale, and his breath was extremely weak.</p><p>The third eye of Condor was already closed, but blood was still flowing out.</p><p>The furnace was broken, and Condor was severely injured.</p><p>Lu Ming held the long spear in his hand and stood in the void. His aura was extremely vigorous and he was completely fine.</p><p>“You’ve lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Al!”</p><p>Kang duo sighed and didn’t say anything. He flew to the side and sat down cross-legged, his body covered in a layer of flames as he began to heal.</p><p>The non-humans present looked at each other.</p><p>Kando was actually defeated!</p><p>If even Kang duo was no match for Lu Ming, then who else on the longevity Roll or below the heavenly Emperor realm could be a match for Lu Ming?</p><p>Could it be that the mighty evil god tribe of the vast evil god World was going to be bullied by a human brat?</p><p>No!</p><p>it seems like only the first Prince can suppress him under the heavenly Emperor realm!</p><p>At this moment, someone spoke.</p><p>Hearing this, all the alien races present were shocked. Then, their eyes lit up. that’s right. We can only ask the first Prince to make a move!</p><p>the first Prince has the purest bloodline of the divine ancestor. His talent is the best in our clan since ancient times. He can definitely suppress him!</p><p>that’s right. The first Prince has only been cultivating for a few hundred years!</p><p>Voices rang out one after another. The foreign races seemed to have great confidence in the first Prince.</p><p>“The first Prince? What a strange name!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>However, for him to be respected by so many foreign races after cultivating for a few hundred years, his talent was indeed shocking.</p><p>“Lu Ming, the first Prince of our tribe is on the holy mountain, but he’s in seclusion. I’m afraid he’ll need some time. Do you dare to wait here?”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>“Why wouldn’t I?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
