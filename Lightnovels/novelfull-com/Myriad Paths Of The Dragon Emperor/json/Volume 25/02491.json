This was the essence of the world.</p><p>After the old man entered the door, he was detected to have the aura of the heaven realm and was killed.</p><p>Who would specifically search for living beings from the heaven realm? It was definitely the evil god tribe!</p><p>It was obvious that the evil god tribe had created this gate. Anyone who wanted to enter the city would be detected to have the aura of the heaven realm.</p><p>The people from the evil god World or netherworld mountain did not have the aura of the heaven realm!</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to everyone and then turned to leave silently. The group left the place, and two days later, they arrived at another large city. However, they found that there were also people checking in this big city, and there were also gates that could detect the aura of the people of the heaven realm.</p><p>They left silently.</p><p>In the next half a month, they traveled a long distance and passed by five to six forces and seven to eight big cities.</p><p>But it was the same. All the forces and all the cities had people checking.</p><p>“What’s going on? Could it be that all the powerful forces have been controlled by the evil god tribe?”</p><p>Someone growled, his eyes red.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest also looked grave. The premonition in their hearts grew stronger.</p><p>This is troublesome!</p><p>looking at the current situation, it seemed like the evil god race was controlling all of them.</p><p>If this went on, the beings of the heaven realm would lose countless experts. Furthermore, there were some important Cursed Lands that they could not enter. They were all going to be taken over by the evil god tribe.</p><p>“What do we do now?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>If they went to the cursed Lands, they would be ambushed by the enemy, and they could not enter some of the important cities.</p><p>Now, where should he go?</p><p>“To the yellow Springs Empire!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“The yellow Springs Empire?”</p><p>The other people’s faces changed.</p><p>The yellow Springs Empire was the most powerful force in the yellow Springs world. It had more than one God and many experts.</p><p>Moreover, the biggest cursed land was in the yellow spring Empire. The ancestral Dragon and the non-human divine ancestor would probably rush to the yellow spring Empire.</p><p>These people were not enough to go to the yellow spring Empire.</p><p>yes, to the yellow Springs Empire. I have a feeling that something has happened there. Otherwise, why do the surrounding forces all listen to the evil god tribe’s orders? ”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go!”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The others all nodded.</p><p>They immediately flew in the direction of the yellow Springs Empire. They specifically flew to remote places and did not pass by those big cities. BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>After flying for a few days, they suddenly heard a violent roar from ahead.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>There was a terrifying collision. They saw a long spear shoot up into the sky as if it was going to pierce through the firmament.</p><p>At the same time, a huge battle-axe appeared, crossing the sky and colliding with the long spear.</p><p>Even though they were far away, they could still feel the terrifying pressure.</p><p>“This is… The peak heavenly emperors are fighting!”</p><p>The faces of heavenly venerate six sages and the others changed drastically. Buzzzzzz!</p><p>at this moment, a bull’s roar reverberated through the world. The world shook and many mountains exploded.</p><p>“The Titanos…”</p><p>Lu Ming exclaimed in shock.</p><p>Lu Ming would not have misheard the Titan longhorn beetle’s voice. He had heard it a few times.</p><p>It was obvious that the Titan Longhorn and the others had encountered a powerful enemy.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Without any hesitation, Lu Ming flew forward.</p><p>Heavenly venerate six sages and the others also flew forward.</p><p>After flying for some distance, they finally saw the scene in front of them.</p><p>Lu Ming saw the Titan longhorn beetle and the nine lives devilish silkworm.</p><p>There were more than fifty people from the heaven realm.</p><p>However, they were surrounded by a group of people.</p><p>Among them, there were experts from the evil god tribe and netherworld mountain. There were more than 100 of them, which was double the number of experts from the heaven realm.</p><p>The heavenly realm was completely focused on defense.</p><p>On the heaven realm’s side, the Titan longhorn beetle and the nine lives devilish silkworm weren’t the strongest. They had yet to recover from their serious injuries and only had the battle prowess of a five star heavenly Emperor and a six star heavenly Emperor respectively.</p><p>On the heaven realm’s side, there was a burly man in battle armor holding a spear. His combat strength was unparalleled, and he was a peak heavenly Emperor.</p><p>However, the other party also had a peak heavenly Emperor.</p><p>Duo Lei!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. The peak heavenly Emperor was actually duo Lei, the one who guarded the eternal cage in the evil god Realm.</p><p>He and the armored man from the heaven realm were locked in a fierce battle.</p><p>However, the other people in the heaven realm were at a disadvantage. This was because the evil god tribe had a total of nine six star heavenly emperors. Experts of this level were completely above the heaven realm.</p><p>The Titan longhorn beetle, the nine-lives devilish silkworm, and several other heaven realm experts were all defending with all their might, but they were still at a disadvantage. If this continued, defeat was only a matter of time.</p><p>“Charge, charge out!”</p><p>The Titan longhorn beetle roared and transformed into its true form. Its horns were as sharp as blades as it charged forward.</p><p>However, he had been severely injured in the past and was only a five star heavenly Emperor now. He was forced to retreat by a six star heavenly Emperor with one move.</p><p>There were too many experts on the other side, and they were completely unable to charge out.</p><p>Titan Longhorn and nine lives devilish silkworm, you were lucky enough to survive the ancient battle. This time, I’ll send you on your way. Attack with all your might and kill them as soon as possible!</p><p>Duo Lei said coldly.</p><p>The others ‘attacks became even more violent.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming and the rest were rushing over.</p><p>Many people could not help but look at Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s you!”</p><p>After seeing Lu Ming, duo Lei let out an angry roar. His cold killing intent seemed to be able to freeze the world.</p><p>Back then, he had been guarding the eternal cage but Lu Ming had escaped with a group of people. This had caused him to be punished by the higher-ups of the evil god tribe.</p><p>Not only that, but he was also laughed at by the other members of the evil god tribe.</p><p>It should be known that no one had ever escaped from the eternal cage since ancient times. However, during the time when duo Lei was guarding the place, someone had managed to escape, and so many experts had escaped.</p><p>All of this was Lu Ming’s fault. It was all Lu Ming’s fault!</p><p>Duo Lei regarded this as a great humiliation and was thinking of how to settle scores with Lu Ming every day.</p><p>At this moment, when he saw Lu Ming, he was really envious.</p><p>As for the Titan Longhorn and the nine lives devilish silkworm, their expressions changed drastically when they saw Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s go!”</p><p>The Titanos roared.</p><p>There were too many experts on the other side. Lu Ming’s current cultivation level was still weak. If he charged forward, he would simply be courting death.</p><p>“Haha, it’s too late to leave now. Let me send him on his way!”</p><p>A six-star heavenly Emperor from the evil god tribe laughed and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not retreat at all. He controlled the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron and blasted it at his opponent.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron pressed down, and a terrifying power burst out, crushing the other party.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
