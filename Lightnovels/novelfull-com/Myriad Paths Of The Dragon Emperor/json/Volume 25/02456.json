When they arrived, they realized that countless people had already gathered on the city walls.</p><p>However, there was no movement outside the city wall, nor was there any sign of a foreign being.</p><p>“Senior Heng Yu, what’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing saw the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor and walked over to ask.</p><p>I don’t know. There’s a strange noise outside two world city. We’ve already sent people to check it out!</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu said.</p><p>Everyone waited in silence.</p><p>Not long after, more than a dozen figures flew back from outside two world city.</p><p>“What’s happening outside the city? Why is there the sound of a Great River flowing?”</p><p>Someone immediately asked.</p><p>in a battlefield outside the city, the space suddenly cracked open, and a River appeared?”</p><p>An old man replied.</p><p>“A River suddenly appeared?”</p><p>Many people were puzzled.</p><p>that’s right. It’s a vast Yellow River with water flowing out. It’s extremely terrifying. A great emperor was splashed by the water and was immediately corroded to death!</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Many people gasped. What River? The river water was so terrifying that even a great emperor would be corroded to death if they were splashed by it. it looks like the legendary yellow spring River in the nine nether heavenly domain!</p><p>The old man replied.</p><p>“What? Yellow spring River, why would the yellow spring River appear on this battlefield?”</p><p>it’s said that the yellow spring River has no end and flows through the heavens. Perhaps it will pass through this battlefield? ”</p><p>“But why is it overflowing?”</p><p>Many people were very confused.</p><p>“Yellow spring River!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He was sure that it was the yellow spring River.</p><p>Back then, he had gone to the ten thousand spirit heavenly region by accident and entered the nine Serenities heavenly region with the Archean body cultivators. He had used the yellow spring River to return to the Tai Qing heavenly region.</p><p>He knew very well that the yellow spring River did pass through the battlefield outside the city.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Many people flew out of the city and toward the source of the sound.</p><p>“Lu Ming, do you want to go and take a look?”</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He, Xie nianqing, the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor, and the rest immediately flew toward the source of the voice.</p><p>Not long after, they arrived at a battlefield and stopped far away.</p><p>In front of him, cracks appeared in the space. He could clearly see a Yellow River flowing through.</p><p>This River was extremely wide. It flowed through the void, and no one knew where it flowed to.</p><p>From time to time, Yellow River water would overflow and fall on the ground, corroding the earth and creating bottomless pits.</p><p>“It’s the yellow spring River!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. He had seen the netherworld before and he would not be mistaken.</p><p>But why did the space suddenly crack and the yellow spring River water overflow?</p><p>This had never been recorded before.</p><p>Lu Ming was very puzzled.</p><p>On the other side of the yellow spring River, there were also many people, all of them from the alien races.</p><p>Obviously, the alien races were also alarmed and were also watching in bewilderment.</p><p>look, a mountain has appeared on the yellow spring River!</p><p>Suddenly, someone cried out in shock.</p><p>He didn’t need to call for the others to see it.</p><p>In front of the yellow spring, a huge mountain appeared in the distance. Countless people were shocked. It was said that no one knew where the end of the yellow spring River was, not even the heaven sovereign. It was extremely mysterious.</p><p>It could be said to be one of the most mysterious places in the world.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes widened. When they had escaped from the nine levels of underground to the Tai Qing heavenly realm on the sky-reaching battleship, they had also seen such a mountain.</p><p>At that time, they had already guessed that this was the end of the yellow spring River.</p><p>No one noticed that there was a figure in the depths of the sky.</p><p>That figure was the ancestor Dragon.</p><p>“Is it finally here? Moke has been waiting for this day for countless years. Is the legendary netherworld mountain going to appear again?”</p><p>The ancestral Dragon muttered. His eyes were filled with solemness and anticipation.</p><p>“It’s time to make preparations!”</p><p>let’s go, ” zu long said and left.</p><p>Three days later, a Dragon’s Roar reverberated throughout the entire taiqing heavenly region.

Even some heavenly emperors didn’t know.</p><p>my God, the ancestral Dragon, a Supreme expert who has surpassed the heavenly Emperor? ”</p><p>there’s actually such an existence in this world. I used to think that it was just a legend.</p><p>hahaha, my heaven realm actually has such a strong person. How lucky!</p><p>I heard that there are countless experts in the lair of Zulong.</p><p>We don’t have to be afraid of the alien races now!”</p><p>The appearance of the ancestral Dragon boosted the morale of the heaven realm.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not so optimistic.</p><p>the ancestral Dragon has suddenly appeared. Is the final battle coming? ”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. He had a bad feeling.</p><p>Could it be that Saint ancestor bloodheart had already fully recovered? impossible! How many years had it been?</p><p>At this time, Zulong sent out a large number of experts to invite some people to gather at the lair of Zulong.</p><p>There were many geniuses among them. Lu Ming and Xie nianqing had also received the invitation.</p><p>In addition, there was also the eternal universe heavenly Emperor, dandan, bubbles, Feng Ling, Long Chen, Ouyang Wushuang, and others.</p><p>There were no rules. Some had high cultivation levels, while others had low cultivation levels.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest set off immediately for the lair of Zulong.</p><p>A few days later, they arrived at the lair of Zulong and gathered at a huge square under the mountain where Zulong lived.</p><p>“The auras of so many experts!”</p><p>“How terrifying!”</p><p>The eternal universe heavenly Emperor and the others could feel the auras of the powerful beings on the mountain, and they were all shocked.</p><p>“Hahaha, after so many years, I’ve come here again!”</p><p>Dandan grinned and laughed.</p><p>“Dandan, did you come here often in the past?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>of course, I’m an ordinary person. Unfortunately, I’ve only seen you once!</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>“I really want to see senior ancestral Dragon’s grace!”</p><p>an unparalleled expert who has surpassed heavenly Emperor. He’s a legendary figure!</p><p>Feng Ling, Long Chen, and the others were also very excited.</p><p>As they chatted, more and more people arrived.</p><p>Lu Ming saw many familiar faces.</p><p>For example, Tianming, Bao de, and the nine absolutes of the heaven realm,</p><p>Lin Xiaofeng, Fu Liu, and others.</p><p>These were all geniuses.</p><p>Lu Ming also saw some powerhouses.
