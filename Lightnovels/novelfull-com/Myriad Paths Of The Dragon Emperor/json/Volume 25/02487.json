It kept going forward, and no one knew where it led.</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate and stepped on the road.</p><p>He was much more confident now. With the help of the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, he was not afraid even if he encountered a peak heavenly Emperor.</p><p>Now, the only threats to Lu Ming were the unrivaled powerhouses and the martial arts God.</p><p>However, there were too few of them.</p><p>The only martial gods left were the non-human divine ancestor and the ancestral Dragon.</p><p>There were not many Martial Emperor powerhouses either.</p><p>For example, both the primal Chaos God monarch and the undying God monarch had fallen.</p><p>There were not many people like him in both the heaven realm and the evil god Realm who were half a step into the martial God Realm.</p><p>According to what Lu Ming knew, this time around, neither the heaven realm nor the evil god tribe had such people come in and were guarding outside.</p><p>Of course, this was only on the surface. Lu Ming was not sure if there were such people in the dark.</p><p>He continued to advance, but the path he took after that was completely devoid of danger. It was calm and peaceful.</p><p>Lu Ming had advanced at least a few thousand miles.</p><p>Lu Ming was somewhat speechless. Although the castle looked huge from the outside, it was not that exaggerated. After entering, he realized that the space inside was shockingly large. Space technology was probably used.</p><p>After a few thousand miles, the road became narrower, and only a few people could walk side by side.</p><p>After traveling another thousand miles, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. A door had appeared in front of him.</p><p>It was the end!</p><p>Lu Ming strode forward, using the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron to protect himself, and rushed into the door.</p><p>Behind the door was a vast Hall. The hall was filled with brilliant light.</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned when he saw it.</p><p>The source of the light in the hall was a ball of light.</p><p>In the hall, there were balls of light. Each ball of light was dazzling, and there was a treasure in each ball of light.</p><p>Yes, it was a treasure.</p><p>Most of them were combat weapons!</p><p>There were also some storage rings and bracelets.</p><p>All of them were treasures, and there were hundreds of them.</p><p>“Hahaha, I’m rich!”</p><p>Lu Ming was ecstatic. He then flew up and grabbed a ball of light.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>However, when Lu Ming approached the ball of light, the ball of light seemed to have a mind of its own and flew away.</p><p>“Eh? Don’t even think about leaving!”</p><p>Lu Ming chuckled. His muscles trembled and his body burst out. The Way of the Master condensed into a big hand and grabbed at the ball of light.</p><p>This time, the ball of light could not fly away and was caught in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>However, after grabbing the ball of light, Lu Ming did not take out the combat weapon inside because it was blocked. The ball of light seemed to be formed by the array on it. It would not be easy to take out the treasure inside.</p><p>“Refine!”</p><p>Lu Ming released his nominator’s power and began to refine the ball of light.</p><p>Fortunately, the defensive power of the ball of light was not that strong. After a few minutes, Lu Ming had refined it. A long spear-like combat weapon fell into Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>It’s only equivalent to a great emperor weapon!</p><p>Lu Ming took a look and was a little disappointed.</p><p>This long spear was only equivalent to a great emperor weapon. It was not of much use to Lu Ming.</p><p>However, it was not a bad idea to bring it out for others to use. Lu Ming kept it.</p><p>Next, Lu Ming grabbed another ball of light.</p><p>This ball of light was also a combat weapon, a combat sword.</p><p>After Lu Ming caught it, he refined it for a few minutes before he took out his combat sword.</p><p>“They’re equivalent to heaven Dao soldiers!”</p><p>This time, Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>This combat sword was actually equivalent to a heaven Dao soldier.</p><p>It was filled with layers of strange arrays. Lu Ming injected energy into it and waved the combat sword, unleashing a shocking power.</p><p>Weapons that were equivalent to the heaven Dao soldiers were priceless. Lu Ming had not obtained many of them so far.</p><p>Even if Lu Ming did not use it himself, he could bring it out and give it to the celestial Thearch in the heaven realm to use. It could greatly improve the combat power in the heaven realm.</p><p>After obtaining a heaven Dao soldier-level combat weapon, Lu Ming’s heart burned with passion. He continued to grab other orbs of light.</p><p>Next, Lu Ming caught dozens of light orbs in succession.</p><p>However, there weren’t many heaven soldiers. There were five of them among the 30 light balls, and the rest were all Emperor-level weapons.</p><p>in addition, the storage rings and bracelets were all made up of divine stones.</p><p>A large number of Godstones.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>He had really struck it rich this time.</p><p>There were more than thirty light orbs and five weapons of the heavenly Dao soldier level. Lu Ming was already very satisfied.</p><p>There were a few hundred balls of light here, so wouldn’t there be a few dozen heaven Dao soldier-level weapons?</p><p>If word of this got out, it would scare people to death.</p><p>Also, with a large number of divine stones, Lu Ming would not have to worry about resources for a long time.</p><p>Lu Ming was even more excited to collect the light orbs.</p><p>At this moment, in another direction of the hall, dozens of figures flickered and rushed in from behind a door.</p><p>The evil god race!</p><p>They were all from the evil god race that Lu Ming had encountered previously.</p><p>It seemed that after so much effort, these foreign races had finally opened up the path on the left, and the two paths on the left and right led to this Hall.</p><p>The moment these evil god race members saw the balls of light in the hall, their eyes shone with a fiery light.</p><p>The moment they saw Lu Ming, their fiery glow turned into a cold killing intent.</p><p>“It’s Lu Ming. Damn it, he’s not dead!”</p><p>The six-star heavenly Emperor of the foreign race roared.</p><p>Lu Ming entered the path on the right. He did not die and had entered this place earlier than them.</p><p>They were extremely puzzled.</p><p>However, they did not think much about it now because they saw Lu Ming collecting the treasures. Their eyes were red.</p><p>They had worked hard for a few months, and in their eyes, these treasures were all theirs.</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>The six-star celestial Thearch of the alien race shouted coldly. He held his saber and took the lead in attacking Lu Ming.</p><p>The cold gleam of the blade slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, the other alien races also attacked Lu Ming, trying to kill him.</p><p>I was going to find you after I collected all these treasures. Now that you’ve come here, I’ll send you on your way!</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently. With a single thought, the nine Divine Nine-Dragon cauldrons flew out.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron trembled and emitted a terrifying aura, which pressed down on the dozens of alien races.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Feeling the power of the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, the six-star heavenly Emperor realm alien was shocked. He unleashed his full power and turned his attack into a defense.</p><p>However, the other alien races didn’t react as quickly.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>When the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron came crashing down, the bodies of the foreign kinds with weaker cultivation bases exploded.</p><p>Even a five-star heavenly Emperor was torn apart by the vast power of the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron and died on the spot.</p><p>Only the six-star heavenly Emperor did not die, but he was seriously injured and retreated while spitting out blood.</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron’s power was equivalent to a peak great Emperor’s power. How could these non-humans block it?</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>The non-human six-star heavenly Emperor turned around and fled without thinking.</p><p>But it was too late!</p><p>The nine Cauldrons expanded rapidly and suppressed all directions, shrouding him within.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The alien roared and slashed out with his saber, sending out hundreds of saber lights.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
