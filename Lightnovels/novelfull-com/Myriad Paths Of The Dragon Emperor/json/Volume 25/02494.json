He had complete trust in Xie nianqing.</p><p>The two of them changed their appearances, concealed their auras, and flew toward the gates of the netherworld imperial capital.</p><p>When they came to the city gate and looked at it up close, they realized that there were runes carved on both sides of the city gate. This was the formation set up by the evil god race.</p><p>As long as a creature from the heaven realm or the primordial realm entered, those runes would immediately react.</p><p>On both sides of the city gate, there was a team of armored soldiers guarding.</p><p>“They’re all celestial emperors!”</p><p>Lu Ming sensed that the soldiers guarding the city gate were all powerhouses of the heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p>In addition, there were some experts lying in wait near the city gate. Although they were well hidden, Lu Ming had mastered the Dao of domination and ruled the heaven and earth. His senses were extremely sharp and he could easily sense them.</p><p>They were all experts, and there were even peak heavenly emperors.</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked by the strength of the yellow Springs Empire.</p><p>the yellow Springs world was definitely stronger than either the heaven realm or the evil god Realm. Even if the two joined forces, they would not be able to compare.</p><p>Fortunately, the people of the yellow Springs world had been cursed for generations, making it difficult for them to leave the yellow Springs mountain. Otherwise, the situation outside would have changed a long time ago.</p><p>The two of them swaggered into the capital of the netherworld Empire.</p><p>There were people of all races in the netherworld imperial capital. There were also many humans. Naturally, no one paid attention to Lu Ming and his companion.</p><p>The two of them walked around but did not find any traces of the evil god tribe. They found someone to sound them out but did not get much useful information.</p><p>The two of them simply found an Inn to stay in.</p><p>For the next ten days, the two of them wandered around the netherworld imperial capital, but they did not obtain much useful information.</p><p>On this day, the two of them strolled around the largest market in the imperial capital of the netherworld.</p><p>In the yellow Springs world, there were many treasures that couldn’t be found outside. The two of them also bought some.</p><p>“That is… The first Prince!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>In front of him, he saw a young man with golden hair.</p><p>This young man was the first Prince, who was ranked first on the evil god tribe’s Longevity Roll.</p><p>The third eye between the first Prince’s brows was closed. His head was full of golden hair, and he was no different from a human.</p><p>He was extremely handsome, like a natural sun, attracting the attention of others wherever he went.</p><p>Around them, some young women kept looking at Prince Di Yi with shining eyes.</p><p>However, when they saw the woman beside the first Prince, their eyes dimmed.</p><p>It was an extremely beautiful woman. She wore a purple one-piece dress that accentuated her perfect figure.</p><p>Compared to her, the other women around her paled in comparison.</p><p>Most importantly, this woman came from a huge family in the yellow spring imperial capital. It was the biggest Alchemist family in the yellow spring Empire, the OU family.</p><p>Ou Xing, the young miss of the OU family, how could those women dare to compare?</p><p>The first Prince and the young miss of the OU family, Ou Xing, were very close to each other as they shopped and bought things together.</p><p>Lu Ming pulled Xie nianqing along and followed behind the two of them from a distance.</p><p>Since he had encountered the first Prince, Lu Ming would not let him go easily.</p><p>The first Prince had a very high status in the evil god tribe and should know many secrets.</p><p>After the first Prince and Ou Xing strolled around, they left the city square and walked towards a bustling Street. Not long after, they entered a wide mansion.</p><p>The two of them followed him in.</p><p>With Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s current cultivation, it was impossible for the first Prince and Ou Xing to notice them.</p><p>There was a huge courtyard behind the mansion. In the courtyard, there was a Lake, and in the middle of the lake, there was a Pavilion.</p><p>The first Prince and Ou Xing came to the pavilion. The first Prince held Ou Xing’s waist with one hand and chatted with her.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing appeared not far away. Lu Ming waved his hand and the space cracked open. He and Xie nianqing entered the crack and appeared in the sky above the pavilion.</p><p>When Lu Ming was at the true Emperor realm, he had already comprehended the space-time law. Now that he had transformed into the ruler’s Dao, his control over space had reached the point of perfection.</p><p>The first Prince and Ou Xing didn’t notice the two of them at all as they were in the space above the pavilion.</p><p>Moreover, the conversation between the two of them was clearly transmitted to Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Xing ‘er, I’ve heard that your ou family has a life and death pill. Is that true?”</p><p>The first Prince asked.</p><p>of course it’s true. Our ou family is the number one Alchemist family in the yellow spring Empire!</p><p>Ou Xing laughed lightly and her tone carried a hint of pride.</p><p>“Is the life-or-death pill really as magical as the legends say?”</p><p>The first Prince asked again.</p><p>of course. You should know that there’s a Tree of Life on the yellow Springs Island, the biggest cursed land in the yellow Springs Empire. The Tree of Life will bear a kind of fruit called the fruit of life after a long period of time!</p><p>the fruit of life possesses the miraculous power of nature. No matter how serious the injury is, it can heal it. It can even heal the injuries of gods!</p><p>the life-or-death pill is made from the life fruit. Before the myriad tribulation, there were people from beyond the heavens like you who brought the life fruit from the netherworld Island. My ou family was fortunate enough to obtain one and refined it into nine life-or-death pills!</p><p>although the life-or-death pill isn’t as effective as the fruit of life, it’s only useless to Immortals. For those below the immortal level, no matter how serious their injuries are, even if their life essence is damaged, one pill can cure them!</p><p>“After so many years of consumption, my ou clan only has three pills left!”</p><p>Ou Xing explained, and her proud expression became even stronger.</p><p>“Life-or-death pill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were burning with passion.</p><p>The life-or-death pill was actually refined from the fruit of life. No matter how serious the injury was, one pill would be able to heal it. Even if the source of one’s life was injured, it would be the same.</p><p>Lu Ming was tempted!</p><p>The injury to his life source was no ordinary injury.</p><p>Ordinary injuries were nothing to great emperors and heavenly Emperor-level figures. Even if their bodies were to explode, they could be healed.</p><p>However, it would be very difficult to recover if one’s life essence was injured.</p><p>If the battle was too intense, many experts would be injured.</p><p>For example, the Titan longhorn beetle, the nine lives devilish silkworm, the ancestral Dragon, and the non-human divine ancestor had all been injured. They hadn’t fully recovered after so many years.</p><p>However, the life-or-death pill could heal these injuries quickly.</p><p>If he could obtain the life-or-death pill, wouldn’t the injuries of the Titan longhorn beetle and the nine lives devilish silkworm be able to heal quickly and return to their peak state?</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing continued to listen.</p><p>it’s so amazing. Xing ‘er, I’in really curious. Can you let me take a look at the life-or-death pill? ”</p><p>The first Prince said.</p><p>“Let you see? I can’t let this happen. If my father and the old ancestor find out,</p><p>I won’t be able to bear the consequences!”</p><p>Ou Xing said.</p><p>“Xing ‘er, I’m just curious and want to take a look. Take a look and take it back. They won’t know. Don’t you even believe me?”</p><p>The first Prince said gently.</p><p>In the beginning, Ou Xing didn’t agree. After the first Prince’s coaxing and pestering, Ou Xing finally agreed and secretly took out the life-or-death pill for the first Prince to see.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing looked at each other and their eyes lit up.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
