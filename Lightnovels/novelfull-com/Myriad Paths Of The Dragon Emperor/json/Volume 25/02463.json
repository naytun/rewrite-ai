His eyes were ferocious.</p><p>Beside him was a group of armored experts from different races. All of them had powerful auras and were great emperor realm experts.</p><p>“Mo you!”</p><p>Xu Rong shouted.</p><p>The brawny man heard the voice and looked over. When he saw Xu Rong, he laughed, so it’s the young lady of the Xu family. You’ve come back just in time!</p><p>This burly man was mo you.</p><p>Opposite mo you and the others was another group of people. The leader was a man who looked to be in his sixties. However, his Qi was extremely weak, dispirited, and his face was pale. It was obvious that he had been seriously injured.</p><p>“Rong-er, quickly come over!”</p><p>The man in his 60s shouted.</p><p>“Father, how are you?”</p><p>Xu Rong quickly ran over and said worriedly.</p><p>This man was Xu Rong’s father, Xu Yuanshan.</p><p>“I’m fine, I’m fine!” Xu Yuanshan said, but after a few words, his face turned pale and he gasped for breath.</p><p>“Mo you, what are you doing in my Xu family again?”</p><p>Xu Rong glared at mo you.</p><p>“What are you doing? Your big brother still owes me a lot of divine stones. Of course I’m here to collect the debt!”</p><p>Mo you sneered. When he looked at Xu Rong, a fiery light flashed in the depths of his eyes.</p><p>“How many immortal stones does my big brother owe you?”</p><p>Mo you said.</p><p>eight hundred thousand divine stones!</p><p>Mo you said.</p><p>“You… I only owe you 300000 Yuan!”</p><p>A young man beside Xu Yuanshan shouted. This young man was Xu Rong’s elder brother, Xu Feng.</p><p>“You don’t want interest? You’ve been in debt for a year. With interest, it’s eight hundred thousand!”</p><p>Mo you said with a cold smile.</p><p>“An increase of 500000 Yuan in a year? Why don’t you just Rob someone?”</p><p>Xu Rong shouted angrily.</p><p>“This is the rule here. It’s only right to pay back what you owe. Hurry up and return it?”</p><p>Mo you scolded.</p><p>eight hundred thousand divine stones. Even if I sell the entire Xu family, it won’t be enough!</p><p>Xu Yuanshan said.</p><p>Xu Rong’s older brother did not dare to speak. He lowered his head.</p><p>not enough? sure. Miss Xu Rong is a beautiful woman. You can give her to me. Your Xu family and miss Xu Rong will be enough. As for the rest, I won’t care about it!</p><p>Mo you said. He looked at Xu Rong with a burning gaze.</p><p>Xu Rong’s face turned pale.</p><p>“You… Don’t even think about having any ideas about Rong-er!”</p><p>Xu Yuanshan roared.</p><p>“Don’t even think? Since you can’t, then don’t blame me for being impolite!”</p><p>Mo you said ferociously.</p><p>A terrifying aura emanated from his body.</p><p>“Peak Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming squinted his eyes slightly. Mo you’s cultivation was at the peak Emperor realm.</p><p>Mo you’s subordinates also burst out with a powerful aura and pressed down on the Xu family.</p><p>The people of the Xu family couldn’t resist at all, especially Xu Yuanshan. Under the pressure of the other party’s aura, his body staggered back. His face turned pale and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Father!”</p><p>Xu Rong was extremely worried.</p><p>Xu Yuanshan was already seriously injured, and now that he was even more injured, he would be in danger if this continued.</p><p>“If you don’t do as I say, the Xu family will be destroyed today!”</p><p>Mo you said coldly.</p><p>Around them, no one spoke.</p><p>Fengming country was founded on martial arts, and everything was spoken with martial arts. The strong stood in high positions, and the weak were like ants. It was extremely cruel.</p><p>If the Xu family had the strength to kill mo you, the commander would not say anything.</p><p>“Mo you, you won’t die a good death!”</p><p>Xu Rong cursed.</p><p>“Hmph, who can kill me?”</p><p>Mo you said ferociously.</p><p>“Me!”</p><p>At this moment, a voice rang out and reverberated throughout the entire area.</p><p>Many people were shocked. Who dared to be so bold as to say that he could kill mo you?</p><p>Mo you’s eyes were filled with cold killing intent as he followed the voice and looked at the speaker.</p><p>Finally, his gaze landed on Lu Ming.</p><p>The person who spoke just now was Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kid, you say… You want to kill me?”</p><p>Mo you enunciated each word. His murderous intent was as cold as a knife. He looked at Lu Ming as if he was looking at a dead man.</p><p>“It seems like you’re not deaf!”</p><p>“I heard that as long as I challenge you and defeat you, I can take your place and become the commander’s guard?” Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Hehe, you want to become the commander’s guard? You’re quite ambitious. Let me tell you, it’s true. Let’s see if you have the ability to do so!”</p><p>Mo you said ferociously.</p><p>Lu Ming, don’t. Mo you has the cultivation of the peak of the void interpretation stage. Moreover, his strength is the best among those at the peak of the void interpretation stage!</p><p>Xu Rong sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming. She was very worried.</p><p>“Profound void martial stage? Wasn’t it the great emperor? Could it be that netherworld mountain’s realm division is different from the heaven realm and evil god Realm?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>However, now was not the time to ask for details.</p><p>mo you, I’m officially challenging you now. Do you dare to accept my challenge? ”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted directly.</p><p>Lu Ming had his own plan.</p><p>The local forces in netherworld mountain were extremely powerful. There were even martial God Realm experts who wanted to obtain opportunities in netherworld mountain and even kill the alien races. They had to borrow power.</p><p>It borrowed the power of the living beings of netherworld mountain.</p><p>This way, not only could he exterminate the alien races, but he could also obtain resources. It would be difficult to rely on himself.</p><p>He believed that the other races would do the same. Now, it was up to who was faster.</p><p>He would first become the commander of the guards and then continue to climb up. When he had a certain amount of power in Fengming, he could use the power of Fengming to find the heaven realm creatures and foreign race powerhouses.</p><p>Gathering all the living beings in the heaven realm, killing the foreign races, and finding opportunities.</p><p>Challenge mo you?</p><p>Many people in the surroundings were stunned.</p><p>Xu Yuanshan and the others were also stunned.</p><p>Lu Ming looked so young and he wanted to challenge mo you. He was too bold.</p><p>“Lu Ming…”</p><p>Xu Rong was worried.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was powerful and had defeated more than thirty experts with one move, mo you was an expert at the peak of the void interpretation stage. His subordinates could not compare to him.</p><p>“You want to challenge me?”</p><p>Mo you’s eyes flickered continuously, revealing a cold light.</p><p>“What’s wrong? You don’t dare to?”</p><p>Lu Ming said in disdain.</p><p>hahaha, brat, why wouldn’t I dare? however, let me see your strength. If you don’t have some strength, why would any random cat or dog come to challenge me? how would I have so much time? ”</p><p>Mo you sneered.</p><p>“Lord Protector, let me test his strength!”</p><p>Behind mo you, a burly man in iron armor walked out.</p><p>This burly man had a pair of horns on his head that were as sharp as blades.</p><p>alright, you can try. You can kill him directly!</p><p>Mo you said coldly.</p><p>“Your subordinate understands!”</p><p>The bull-horned man said coldly. He then walked toward Lu Ming with a battle axe in his hand.”Kid, make your move!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As soon as the bull-horned man finished speaking, Lu Ming moved. A spear ray shot towards the bull-horned man at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>Before the bull-horned man could react, he was pinned to the ground by Lu Ming’s spear radiance.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
