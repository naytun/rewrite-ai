Their cold killing intent enveloped Lu Ming. “Heaven realm trash!”</p><p>The six-star heavenly Emperor said coldly.</p><p>This was a noble of a different race. He was tall and covered in purple scales. He held a battle sword in his hand. He was wide and huge, even taller than an ordinary person!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The other party made his move immediately. His burly body approached Lu Ming in an instant and his huge saber slashed out violently. The space exploded and the power was shocking.</p><p>Lu Ming’s entire body was covered in a bright purple-gold light as he pushed his strength to the extreme.</p><p>When Lu Ming’s energy was activated to the extreme, he could no longer maintain his disguise and revealed his original appearance.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The great desolation spear trembled violently and swept out, colliding fiercely with the opponent’s saber. With a violent boom, Lu Ming was once again pushed back.</p><p>Now, even if he used all his strength, he was not a match for a six-star heavenly Emperor.</p><p>In the heavenly Emperor realm, there was a huge gap between each level.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s you!”</p><p>The other party recognized Lu Ming the moment he revealed his true form.</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>“Let’s attack together!”</p><p>The other four five-star heavenly emperors also roared and attacked together. Five five-star heavenly emperors joined forces, and their power was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming brandished his long spear tightly and blocked the other party’s attack. However, he was still forced to retreat and the qi and blood in his body were in turmoil.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The six-star heavenly Emperor also rushed over and slashed out a pale saber flare.</p><p>Lu Ming no longer took the attack head-on. His muscles trembled and he moved horizontally for a hundred meters to avoid the other party’s attack. He then rushed toward the road on the right.</p><p>There was no alien race guarding that road.</p><p>The five alien experts were in hot pursuit.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s speed was very fast. In an instant, he arrived at the intersection. He did not stop and rushed over directly.</p><p>The five alien races stopped.</p><p>“Are we going to chase them?”</p><p>A five star heavenly Emperor non-human asked.</p><p>there’s no need to chase. This path is more dangerous than the one on the left.</p><p>It’s much more difficult. If this kid goes in, he’ll die!</p><p>leave two people here to guard. We’ll continue to attack over there. If there’s any movement here, inform me immediately!</p><p>The six-star heavenly Emperor ordered.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The others nodded.</p><p>They waited for a while more. Seeing that Lu Ming did not come out, a few of them returned to the left path, leaving two people to keep watch nearby.</p><p>Lu Ming entered the path on the right and kept moving forward.</p><p>This road was filled with blood-red mist, blocking the view and making it impossible to see the scenery ahead.</p><p>the foreign tribe didn’t chase after us. It seems that there’s danger here!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>He focused his mind and covered his body with the power of domination. He held the great desolation spear and walked forward carefully.</p><p>After advancing for more than ten miles, a Dragon’s Roar suddenly came from ahead.</p><p>That’s right, it was a Dragon’s Roar!</p><p>This place… Could there be a true dragon?”</p><p>Lu Ming had some doubts.</p><p>They continued forward.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>The Dragon’s Roar became louder and louder. Suddenly, the fog churned and two blood -red lights appeared in the fog. They were like two blood moons. Then, a huge true dragon appeared in the fog.</p><p>The true dragon was blood red all over. Its blood red eyes were filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>“A true dragon, there’s actually a true dragon!”</p><p>Lu Ming was bewildered.</p><p>This was the netherworld mountain, a place that came from beyond the heavens.</p><p>In the heaven realm, the ancestral Dragon was known as the ancestor of all true dragons. In that case, didn’t that mean that true dragons only existed in the heaven realm?</p><p>Could it be that there were true dragons beyond the heavens?</p><p>In that case, the theory that the ancestral Dragon was the ancestor of all true dragons was worth discussing.</p><p>no, it’s not a real body. It’s an illusionary body!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He realized that this true dragon seemed to have a physical body, but there was no life aura on it. Instead, it was condensed from some kind of energy.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The moment the true dragon saw Lu Ming, it roared and pounced at him.</p><p>“One-star heavenly Emperor!”</p><p>As soon as the true dragon made its move, Lu Ming could tell that it had the cultivation base of a one-star Celestial Emperor.</p><p>Naturally, a one-star heavenly Emperor was no match for Lu Ming. Lu Ming’s spear struck out and the true dragon was defeated.</p><p>However, after the true dragon was defeated, it turned into a wave of energy and drifted back, then condensed into a physical body again.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>Following that, more roars were heard. As the blood mist churned, another blood-red true dragon appeared.</p><p>There were strong and weak Auras, but the weakest one was a one-star heavenly Emperor, and the strongest was a three-star heavenly Emperor.</p><p>As soon as the true dragons saw Lu Ming, they roared and pounced on him.</p><p>Lu Ming held the great desolation spear and charged over.</p><p>The long spear trembled and shot out spear light. It pierced into the heads of the true dragons and crushed them.</p><p>However, the moment these true dragons were defeated, they immediately condensed again. There was no way to kill them.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming rushed over and went deep in.</p><p>However, he realized that more and more true dragons were appearing. Moreover, there were already more than twenty four-star heavenly Emperorlevel true dragons that had surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>“Why are there so many true dragons? are they Dragon Souls?”</p><p>Lu Ming made a guess.</p><p>More than twenty true dragons pounced at Lu Ming continuously. After being defeated by Lu Ming, they condensed again.</p><p>However, Lu Ming finally realized something. Every time the true dragons were defeated, they would become weaker.</p><p>It wasn’t completely unkillable. As long as he killed it a few more times, he could still kill it.</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear trembled continuously. The bright and sharp spear radiance burst out continuously, blasting the true dragons apart.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>He felt that the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, which had been silent in his sea</p><p>of consciousness, had actually moved.</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron hadn’t shown any signs of change since it had used up all its energy more than a hundred years ago. However, there was a change now.</p><p>Could it be related to these true dragons?</p><p>Lu Ming did not think and immediately summoned the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As soon as the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron appeared, it began to shake violently. The Dragon carving on the cauldron emitted a bright light, as if the Dragon on it had come alive.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Then, a loud dragon roar came from the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron. Then, the shadow of Nine Dragons appeared, opened its mouth, and roared.</p><p>A terrifying devouring power was emitted from the mouths of the nine Dragons.</p><p>The blood-red true dragons showed fear and wailed. But in the next moment, these blood-red true dragons actually turned into red light and flew into the mouths of the nine Dragons, disappearing.</p><p>More than 20 blood-red true dragons were swallowed by the nine Dragon phantoms, regardless of their cultivation level.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron shook violently, and a powerful aura emanated from its surface.</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron had been revived. Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
