The remaining alien races managed to escape.</p><p>Lu Ming, you’re amazing. I didn’t expect you to surpass me again!</p><p>Dandan looked at Lu Ming with a depressed look.</p><p>hehe, isn’t it normal to be surpassed by me? Who am I? I’m an invincible heaven’s favorite!</p><p>In front of dandan, Lu Ming’s skin was thicker than his.</p><p>Sure enough, dandan was even more displeased and revealed a look of shock.</p><p>“Let’s go, we’ll continue to kill the enemy!”</p><p>Lu Ming arrived and looked at the alien camp in the distance.</p><p>There, a great army of the heavenly realm was fighting with the Army of the foreign races.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>She gritted her teeth and wanted to vent her frustration at Lu Ming on the alien</p><p>race.</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming and his companion coming over, the alien races were shocked and quickly retreated into the military camp, activating the formation to resist.</p><p>The two of them arrived outside the military camp.</p><p>“Greetings to the two heavenly emperors!”</p><p>In the heavenly realm Army, many people were very respectful.</p><p>In fact, there were some people who were more familiar with Lu Ming in this heaven realm Army. For example, two of the nine absolutes of the heaven realm were among them.</p><p>However, at this moment, they were looking at Lu Ming with eyes full of respect.</p><p>It was obvious that Lu Ming had already become a heavenly Emperor. From then on, he was high and mighty.</p><p>If they wanted to become heavenly emperors, they didn’t know how many years it would take and how many things they had to go through.</p><p>Their former opponent had now become a heavenly Emperor. He had far surpassed them, and they felt very complicated.</p><p>“Everyone, there’s no need to be so polite!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands casually.</p><p>With that, Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the non-human camp. He realized that apart from activating the formation, most of the people had actually retreated to the back.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>At this moment, bubbles and the rest flew over. Bubbles dashed into Lu Ming’s</p><p>arms.</p><p>“Bubble, you’ve grown up!”</p><p>Lu Ming touched bubbles ‘small head.</p><p>After not seeing each other for more than a hundred years, bubbles had finally grown up a little. She looked like a seven or eight-year-old girl and was even cuter.</p><p>“Of course!”</p><p>Pao Pao pouted, her face red.</p><p>“Let’s leave this place and return to two world city!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>He believed that the news of what had happened here would soon spread to the other foreign races, and at that time, even stronger foreign races would definitely come.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current strength and the great desolation spear, he was confident that he could protect himself even if he encountered a three-star heavenly Emperor.</p><p>However, it would be difficult to protect the others.</p><p>If a peerless expert at the level of a four-star heavenly Emperor came, he would not even be able to protect himself.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go back!”</p><p>Dandan also nodded.</p><p>The other Army was also planning to return to two world city.</p><p>Everyone flew towards two world city together. There were no accidents along the way, and they returned to two world city safely not long after.</p><p>They had not seen each other for many years and naturally, there were many topics to talk about. Dandan, bubbles, and Huang Ling were very curious about Lu Ming’s experiences over the years. They pulled Lu Ming to drink with them and chatted.</p><p>Lu Ming briefly recounted his experience over the years, shocking everyone. During this period of time, Lu Ming learned that Long Chen had returned to the divine wilderness and married Xie nianlin. Lu Ming was happy for him.</p><p>As time passed, he had let go of the grudges between him and the Xie family.</p><p>It wasn’t until the next day that the crowd dispersed.</p><p>Lu Ming went to a courtyard and stayed there. He planned to return to the primordial realm in two days to visit his parents.</p><p>However, just a day later, dandan, bubbles, Long Chen and the rest arrived at</p><p>Lu Ming’s residence.</p><p>“Hahaha, Lu Ming, look who we have brought!”</p><p>Dandan laughed.</p><p>“Who is it!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and swept his gaze across the room.</p><p>Then, he saw a young man in the crowd.</p><p>He looked like he was in his twenties. He had an imposing appearance and was extraordinarily handsome. He looked 70 – 80% similar to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Divine wilderness!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Although more than a hundred years had passed, Lu Ming could immediately tell from the aura that this young man was Lu shenhuang.</p><p>“Father!”</p><p>Lu shenhuang shouted out, his eyes filled with surprise.</p><p>Then, shenhuang Lu walked over while holding a young lady’s hand.</p><p>This lady was extremely beautiful and was no less beautiful than Feng Ling and Qiu Yue. She was carrying a little girl who was about two to three years old. She had two pigtails and was extremely cute.</p><p>“Father!”</p><p>The young lady blinked her big eyes and looked at Lu Ming curiously. She called out softly.</p><p>“Chi’er, call Grandpa!”</p><p>Lu shenhuang looked at the little girl.</p><p>“Grandpa, Grandpa…”</p><p>The little girl called out in her childish voice.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming was tongue-tied and stunned.</p><p>It was obvious that the young lady was Lu shenhuang’s wife and the little girl was his daughter.</p><p>He went around the evil god World and didn’t expect that Lu shenhuang was already married and had a daughter.</p><p>“Hahaha, Lu Ming, are you stupid?!”</p><p>Dandan laughed.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming berated dandan. Then, he looked at Lu shenhuang and the rest with a big smile on his face.”Good, good, good!”</p><p>Lu Ming said ‘good’ a few times, his heart filled with warmth.</p><p>These were all his family.</p><p>Divine wilderness, what are their names?</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Father, her name is mu wanxuan, this little guy is Lu Chi!</p><p>Lu shenhuang introduced.</p><p>“Alright, alright. Lu Chi, Chi ‘er, come, let Grandpa hug you!”</p><p>Lu Ming extended his hand to Lu Chi.</p><p>The little girl was not shy with strangers at all. She climbed onto Lu Ming and rolled around in his arms.</p><p>Lu Ming carefully used the world Energy to support Lu Chi, as if he was afraid that she would fall.</p><p>“In two years, she can start cultivating!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and instructed Lu shenhuang.</p><p>yes, I’ve been using spirit herbs to build her Foundation. I’ll let her cultivate in two years!</p><p>Lu shenhuang nodded.</p><p>“Have you met your grandparents?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>Lu shenhuang was stunned for a moment before he shook his head, ” “No, I didn’t!”</p><p>“Come with me to see them tomorrow!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Shen Huang nodded.</p><p>Everyone talked and laughed, and after awhile, dandan and the others left tactfully.</p><p>Only Lu Ming, Lu shenhuang, mu wanxuan and Lu Chi were left in the courtyard.</p><p>The little girl had been snuggling in Lu Ming’s arms and was reluctant to come out.</p><p>“Little fellow…”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. Then, his body was filled with purple-gold light, which enveloped Lu Chi.</p><p>This was the power of a ruler.</p><p>The power of domination dominated the world and was Supreme. Lu Ming wanted to use the power of domination to build a foundation for Lu Chi and improve his body.</p><p>The ruler’s power was so mysterious that it could adjust Lu Chi’s body to the best state.</p><p>Lu shenhuang and mu wanxuan naturally knew what Lu Ming wanted to do. They stood quietly at the side and did not say a word.</p><p>Lu Ming only finished after a full day.</p><p>Lu Chi’s body had undergone earth-shaking changes. It had become pure and stainless. When he started cultivating in the future, his cultivation speed would be extremely shocking.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
