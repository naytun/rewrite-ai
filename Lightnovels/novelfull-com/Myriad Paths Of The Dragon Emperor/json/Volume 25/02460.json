The huge warship looked like a tiny ant in front of the vortex.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Deafening rumbles rang out. The current was too fast, forming a terrifying suction force that acted on the warship, trying to suck it in.</p><p>“Not good, let’s go!”</p><p>Many people’s expressions changed drastically. They wanted to take to the air and leave this place.</p><p>The yellow spring’s water was so powerful that even a heavenly Emperor would be in danger if he were to be swept into it. Those below the heavenly Emperor realm would definitely die.</p><p>If they were sucked into this vortex, they would be dead.</p><p>hold on. We can only enter netherworld mountain through this vortex!</p><p>At this moment, the ancestral Dragon shouted. His voice was like a Bell that rang in everyone’s hearts.</p><p>Everyone managed to calm down. The ancestral Dragon would not harm them. The Outlander race’s divine ancestor managed to suppress the commotion. Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The two sky-reaching battleships were swept into the yellow spring’s vortex and disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest felt a terrifying pressure pressing down on them. Their surroundings were pitch black and they could not see anything at all. They could not even hear a sound. It was silent all around.</p><p>Huala!</p><p>The next moment, they seemed to have passed through something, and the light around them suddenly brightened.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s eyes widened. He had a shocking discovery.</p><p>At this moment, they were high up in the sky and not on the sky-connecting warship. They had no idea where the warship had gone.</p><p>All of them, including the non-humans, were thrown down by an extremely powerful force.</p><p>Even Lu Ming found it difficult to resist this power.</p><p>Below them, there was a huge mountain. They were falling towards the mountain.</p><p>In the beginning, the mountain didn’t look very big. However, as they got closer to the mountain, the mountain looked bigger and bigger.</p><p>All of them had deviated from their original course and were getting further and further away from each other.</p><p>“Little Qing…”</p><p>Lu Ming saw that Xie nianqing, dandan, bubbles, and the rest were getting further and further away from him. They were flying to different locations on the mountain.</p><p>The speed at which they were falling was getting faster and faster because a terrifying gravitational force was coming from the mountain.</p><p>“What a huge mountain…”</p><p>The closer he got to the mountain, the more he realized how huge, terrifying, and majestic it was.</p><p>From a distance, it didn’t seem like much, but when they got closer, they realized that any protrusion or flat ground on this mountain was a vast and boundless plain.</p><p>Big, it was too big. This mountain really was like a huge world.</p><p>As they got closer and closer, they could even see large rivers and huge cities.</p><p>All of them had landed in different positions. Lu Ming could no longer see Xie nianqing, dandan, and the others. He looked up and could only see a few figures, who were very far away from him.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming landed on the edge of the mountain. As he got closer, he realized that there was a dense forest below him.</p><p>A terrifying force of gravity pulled Lu Ming towards the forest.</p><p>what a terrifying gravity. On this mountain, the gravity is thousands of times stronger than the outside world!</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked. He activated the world Energy, stabilized his body, and fell toward the forest.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming landed heavily in a forest, creating a huge pit on the ground. The powerful shock wave shattered the ancient trees in the surroundings.</p><p>Hu…</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a long sigh of relief. He had finally arrived at netherworld mountain.</p><p>“The origin Energy here… No, no, this isn’t Origin Energy…”</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>He discovered that the heaven and earth here was filled with a type of energy. It was not the original Qi, but an energy of a higher grade than the original Qi. Its quality was higher than the original Qi, and he could also absorb and refine it. The effect was at least ten times better than the original Qi.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. This meant that the speed of his cultivation here was much faster than in the outside world. Although it might not be ten times faster, it would be at least five times faster.</p><p>what is the origin of this netherworld mountain? the cultivation conditions are actually so much better than the heaven realm? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was filled with thoughts.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>At this moment, lights and shadows flickered in the surroundings. The next moment, many figures appeared and surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>“Human!”</p><p>At the sight of these figures, Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>These figures were all humans. There were more than thirty of them, and their cultivation was shockingly high. All of them were at the great emperor realm.</p><p>More than 30 great emperors had appeared. Even in the heaven realm, they were a powerful force.</p><p>More than thirty people glared at Lu Ming with killing intent in their eyes. They gritted their teeth and wished they could cut Lu Ming into eight pieces.</p><p>Lu Ming could not figure it out. He had just arrived and did not offend these people. Why were they looking at him with fierce expressions?</p><p>In particular, there was a young lady among them who was as beautiful as a flower. She was looking at Lu Ming with resentment as if he had done something outrageous.</p><p>“Kid, Who are you? Why did you stop us from capturing the Jade Blood Fox?”</p><p>One of the burly men glared at Lu Ming, his body exuding a powerful aura.</p><p>He was a five star great emperor, and he was very powerful.</p><p>disrupt your capture of the jadeblood Fox? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p><p>He didn’t. He had just arrived.</p><p>you’re still playing dumb? we spent three months to lure the Jade-Blood Fox here. We were about to catch it, but you descended from the sky and caused such a huge commotion, scaring it away. You’re still denying it? ”</p><p>The woman glared at Lu Ming hatefully and said through gritted teeth.</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>Lu Ming finally understood.</p><p>He had just descended from the sky, and the other party happened to be here to capture a Jade Blood Fox, and he had just so happened to scare the other party away.</p><p>This was too much of a coincidence!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly. He was really speechless.</p><p>everyone, I really didn’t do it on purpose. I’m willing to compensate for the losses I caused!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Compensation? how? Jadeblood foxes are extremely rare and difficult to catch.</p><p>Can you catch one?”</p><p>The young woman continued to speak with hatred.</p><p>miss, why bother talking nonsense with him? I think he was sent by mo you to disrupt our capture of the Jade-Blood Fox!</p><p>The five star great emperor realm burly man said angrily.</p><p>That’s right, they must have been sent by mo you!”</p><p>it must be. He doesn’t want us to cure the master!</p><p>The others also roared in anger.</p><p>“In myopinion, we should capture him first and interrogate him!”</p><p>A white-haired elder charged at Lu Ming. He reached out his hand and a huge claw was aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>This old man had the cultivation of two star great emperor.</p><p>“Eh? This cultivation system…’</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. Then, he gathered a little energy and pointed his finger.</p><p>Lu Ming was very curious about the cultivation methods of these people and wanted to test them. Therefore, he did not use his full strength and only used a trace of his strength.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
