The dragonians did not pay much attention to him after they saw him.</p><p>Lu Ming wandered around for a while and suddenly rushed toward the cursed</p><p>land.</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>On the side, the dragonians roared.</p><p>The people of the yellow Springs world had been cursed for generations. They could not enter the cursed Lands. Once they entered, they would die.</p><p>In their opinion, Lu Ming was courting death!</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s speed did not slow down at all. He ran wildly and approached the castle in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“He’s fine, he’s fine!”</p><p>The dragonmen looked at each other.</p><p>According to their experience, as long as they were within a certain range of the cursed land, they would be cursed and die on the spot. However, Lu Ming had already run to the castle and he was fine.</p><p>it’s fake. Damn it. He must be fake. He’s pretending to be a Dragonman!</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>On second thought, the dragonians knew that Lu Ming was an imposter. Only outsiders could enter the cursed land.</p><p>However, they could only watch helplessly and did not dare to pursue.</p><p>The castle was huge, and the gate was open.</p><p>Lu Ming rushed in directly.</p><p>Behind the door was a dark passage.</p><p>Lu Ming reduced his speed and advanced carefully. This cursed land was</p><p>dangerous.</p><p>However, there was no danger in this passage. When Lu Ming was about to reach the end, nothing happened.</p><p>However, at the exit of the passage, there were two foreign races guarding it.</p><p>“You are…”</p><p>They were stunned when they saw Lu Ming.</p><p>That was because Lu Ming was still in his Dragonman form. Could a Dragonman enter this place? That was why they didn’t know how to react.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming took the opportunity to charge forward. His palm was like a knife, cutting horizontally.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>With two loud bangs, the two alien races were killed by Lu Ming. He charged</p><p>past them.</p><p>Behind the passage was a huge platform, and In front of the platform were two</p><p>wide roads.</p><p>The two paths led in different directions.</p><p>The road on the right was pitch-black and covered in a bloody mist. It was a terrifying sight.</p><p>As for the road on the left, it was also covered in white fog, blocking one’s vision and making it impossible for one to see what was ahead.</p><p>On the platform, there were more than a dozen foreign kinds either standing or sitting. On the road to the left, there were also a few foreign kinds standing there.</p><p>Only the right path didn’t have any foreign races.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming entered, more than ten alien races looked at him in unison.</p><p>“Dragonman?”</p><p>no, it’s definitely not a Dragonman. Someone is pretending!</p><p>“Who cares who he is? He doesn’t have the aura of my race, so he must be from the heaven realm. Kill him!”</p><p>A cold aura bloomed as a cold voice sounded.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>One of the four-armed alien was the first to charge at Lu Ming at an extremely</p><p>fast speed.</p><p>This alien had the cultivation base of a three-star heavenly Emperor, which was very powerful.</p><p>However, his opponent was Lu Ming. A purple-gold light emanated from Lu Ming’s body. His power of domination condensed into a long spear and he thrust it forward.</p><p>It looked like Lu Ming was stabbing at the void, but as he did so, a scream was heard. The four-armed alien appeared out of thin air, his head pierced by Lu</p><p>Ming.</p><p>A three-star heavenly Emperor was killed instantly.</p><p>“Not good, this person is very strong. Let’s attack together!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Other than a few who were not even heavenly emperors, the rest of the alien races were all heavenly emperors.</p><p>A few of them were extremely terrifying.</p><p>Two four star heavenly emperors and one five star heavenly Emperor.</p><p>Lu Ming no longer hid his abilities and attacked with all his might.</p><p>The great desolation spear appeared in his hands. Lu Ming was bathed in the purple-gold light. The long spear vibrated and he stabbed a few times in succession.</p><p>The two four-star heavenly emperors were sent flying by Lu Ming and they</p><p>spat out mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>The five-star heavenly Emperor’s body trembled violently and he retreated.</p><p>Lu Ming was unleashing his full power now. He was so powerful that even a five-star heavenly Emperor was not his match.</p><p>“Not good, this person is difficult to deal with, quickly call him Sir!</p><p>The five-star heavenly Emperor roared.</p><p>“Call me Lord!”</p><p>A few of the demonic humans, who were guarding the intersection on the left, rushed into the road.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming wielded his long spear, his killing intent as sharp as a knife, and charged towards the foreign kinds.</p><p>With a sweep of the long spear, a few of the foreign races were sent flying with broken bones and tendons, dying on the spot.</p><p>“Damnit!”</p><p>The five-star heavenly Emperor roared angrily. A yellow stone flew out of his third eye. It exuded a powerful aura and was thrown at Lu Ming.</p><p>“This is… Heaven Dao soldiers? No, there’s no aura of the heavenly Dao. It’s a weapon of this world!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>The misty yellow stone that the other party had taken out was a weapon equivalent to a heavenly Dao soldier. It was a weapon from netherworld mountain, and there were many wondrous formations engraved on it. As long as one injected energy into it, it would be activated.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming shook his long spear and swept it out, colliding with the stone.</p><p>The rock was sent flying. The non-human five-star heavenly Emperor was also forced to retreat by Lu Ming’s powerful energy.</p><p>Lu Ming strode forward, his long spear stabbing out continuously.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>One by one, the alien races died under Lu Ming’s spear.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current combat strength, anyone below the level of a four-star heavenly Emperor would not be able to withstand a single blow from him.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, there were only five or six of the foreign kinds left.</p><p>The rest of the non-humans were terrified. They didn’t dare to continue fighting and turned to run.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>At this moment, an angry roar camefromthe left road.Aburly figure rushed out from the road, stirring up white mist like a hurricane.</p><p>He had yet to come out but his violent aura was already pressing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Six-star heavenly Emperor?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered fearlessly. He strode forward and the terrifying purple-gold Spear’s gleam charged towards a four-star celestial Thearch of the foreign tribe.</p><p>The foreign being tried his best to block the attack, but he spat out a mouthful of blood. One of his arms exploded, and he was severely injured.</p><p>“My Lord, save me!”</p><p>The alien shouted.</p><p>“You dare?”</p><p>The voice roared in the road.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming was very decisive. He attacked again. The Spear’s gleam pierced through the air and directly pierced through the injured four-star heavenly Emperor, killing him in the air.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a pale-white Saber Light slashed out from the intersection. It was shockingly powerful and the terrifying force was headed straight for Lu</p><p>Ming’s face.</p><p>Lu Ming’s arm shook and the great desolation spear changed its direction rapidly, blocking in front of him.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>There was a violent tremor and Lu Ming felt a violent force charging at him. He could not help but retreat.</p><p>Then, a burly alien with a saber in his hand walked out of the intersection.</p><p>This foreign being’s three eyes glowed with a cold light, and his body exuded a powerful aura.</p><p>A six-star heavenly Emperor!</p><p>Then, with a flash, five or six figures rushed out from the road on the left, each of them an expert.</p><p>“Four five star heavenly emperors!”</p><p>Lu Ming could tell the other party’s cultivation level.</p><p>One six star heavenly Emperor and four five star heavenly emperors.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
