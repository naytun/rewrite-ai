Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Kuiju finally attacked.</p><p>He shouted in a low voice. At least three-tenths of the purple scales on his body flew out toward Lu Ming.</p><p>These scales were like small Flying Daggers. They were extremely sharp and powerful, cutting the space into chaos.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s muscles trembled and the strength of his physical body was activated to the extreme.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming cast the inextinguishable golden body.</p><p>Lu Ming had successfully cultivated all eighteen types of laws contained in the indestructible ancient scroll.</p><p>In fact, Lu Ming even tried to make changes to the indestructible ancient scroll by adding in a few laws. This made the power of the indestructible ancient scroll even stronger, and its recovery and defense abilities became even more shocking.</p><p>Lu Ming did not retaliate at all, allowing the scales to cut his body.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Sparks flew in all directions. When the scales cut Lu Ming’s body, there was a continuous clanging sound that was extremely ear-piercing.</p><p>However, none of the scales could break through Lu Ming’s defense.</p><p>The scales flew past, but Lu Ming was completely fine.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets.</p><p>Many people knew how terrifying the kuiju skill was. Those scales were a hundred times, a thousand times sharper than a real flying knife…</p><p>Once it erupted, it was indestructible. Even those on the longevity Roll who were ranked higher than kui ju didn’t dare to take it head-on. They could only think of ways to avoid it.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not retaliate at all. He just stood there and allowed kui ju to attack him. However, he could not break through Lu Ming’s defense.</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>Many people were dumbfounded.</p><p>Kuiju himself was stunned.</p><p>After a long time, everyone finally reacted.</p><p>“I don’t believe it. Just watch me break your defense. All of you…”</p><p>Kuiju hollered in rage and pushed with both hands. The purple light on his body was extremely bright and all the scales on his body burst forth.</p><p>The countless scales were like flying Daggers. There were thousands of them.</p><p>Lu Ming still did not move, allowing the thousands of scales to slash at his body.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>Ear-piercing sounds were heard continuously. After the concentrated sounds passed, Lu Ming was still standing there, perfectly fine.</p><p>There was not a single wound on his body.</p><p>Everyone sucked in a breath of cold air. This kind of defensive power was too terrifying.</p><p>it doesn’t have any power at all. Are you playing house? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s disdainful voice was heard and kuiju’s face turned red.</p><p>The attack that he was so proud of was said to be child’s play by Lu Ming. He was so angry that he almost vomited blood.</p><p>“The third move!”</p><p>” die! kui ju roared as he waved his hands. Thousands of scales gathered together and connected to each other, forming a huge flying knife. The power of this flying knife was several times stronger than the scattered scales, and the attack power was completely concentrated.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The flying Daggers flew toward Lu Ming.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with solemnity. The power of this flying knife was enough to threaten him.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body glowed continuously. In the end, he used more than forty types of laws.</p><p>More than 40 types of laws condensed into a long spear in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming thrust his spear.</p><p>The two blades met in the air and exploded with a blinding light.</p><p>The Rings of light were even more dazzling than the sun.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming’s body trembled slightly and he took a few steps back. The flying knife that kuiju condensed immediately collapsed and turned into purple scales that flew in all directions. Then, they flew back into kui ju’s body and disappeared.</p><p>Kuiju’s body retreated as his blood churned and his face turned pale.</p><p>“Three moves!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly and kuiju’s face turned pale.</p><p>According to the agreement, if he did not defeat Lu Ming in three moves, he would lose.</p><p>“I’ve lost!”</p><p>Kuiju sighed and retreated.</p><p>In fact, even if he did not admit defeat, he was not Lu Ming’s match. He had used his strongest technique but he still could not do anything to Lu Ming. The result would be the same if he continued to fight.</p><p>“Kuiju lost!”</p><p>Many alien races had unsightly expressions.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was simply unfathomable. It was as if he had no foundation.</p><p>Starting from mo tianluo, he had completely swept through all the battles. No matter how strong the people were, they could only fail.</p><p>“What do we do?”</p><p>Many people turned to look at the youths.</p><p>These people were ranked above kui ju on the longevity Roll.</p><p>However, at this moment, these people looked at each other with grave expressions. For a moment, no one made a move.</p><p>Although kuiju’s ranking was lower than theirs, kuiju’s explosive power wasn’t lower than theirs. In fact, it was even stronger.</p><p>Their combined combat strength was above kui ju’s. However, if they were to be like Lu Ming and take three moves head-on from kui ju, they would be the ones who would be defeated.</p><p>Under such circumstances, even kuiju was defeated. Could they defeat Lu Ming if they went up?</p><p>They had no confidence at all.</p><p>The other foreign races were also silent.</p><p>Could it be that no one could suppress Lu Ming?</p><p>Could it be that the heavenly Emperor had to make a move?</p><p>However, a celestial Thearch who had cultivated for God knows how many years would be embarrassed if he were to attack a junior like Lu Ming. Even if he won, it would be an unfair victory.</p><p>I didn’t expect that a human who has cultivated for less than 200 years would have such combat power. I’m itching for a fight!</p><p>At this moment, a chuckle was heard.</p><p>Then, a young figure appeared in the air.</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly stunned at the sight of this person.</p><p>This was because this alien race was different from the alien races that Lu Ming had seen in the past.</p><p>This foreign being looked very similar to a human, but he was different from the royal family of the foreign race.</p><p>He had long red hair, and the third eye between his eyebrows was red like a small sun.</p><p>This was especially so for the pair of wings on his back. They were also fiery red, and there were even flames burning on them.</p><p>This was the first time Lu Ming had seen such a foreign tribe.</p><p>“It’s Prince Condor!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>A Prince? It seems that this Kang duo is also a royal member of a foreign tribe. It seems that there is more than one appearance of a foreign royal member!” Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>“Prince Condor actually came!”</p><p>Prince Condor is ranked second on the longevity Roll. He’s about to make a move!</p><p>‘I haven’t seen Prince Kandor in action for many years, at least hundreds of years. This is a good time!”</p><p>Many people were discussing in surprise.</p><p>With a gentle smile on his face, Kang duo nodded to the crowd. Then, he flapped his wings and flew toward Lu Ming.</p><p>to be honest, I’ve never seen someone as powerful as you in less than two hundred years of cultivation. Even if that fellow were to reach your level of combat strength, he would have spent more time than you!</p><p>Kang duo smiled.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. Who was the guy that Kang duo was talking about?</p><p>“Kando, go all out, you must defeat him!”</p><p>At this moment, a voice sounded in Kang duo’s ears.</p><p>“Father!”</p><p>Kang duo was shocked.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
