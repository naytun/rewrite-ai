Follow me!”</p><p>Mo tianluo said, then turned around and flew in a direction.</p><p>Lu Ming did not say anything and followed him.</p><p>As for Jiayi, he kept quiet and followed not far from Lu Ming.</p><p>As long as Lu Ming’s life was not in danger, he would not take action.</p><p>“Let’s go, I’ll go and take a look too!”</p><p>“Just in time, I want to go too!”</p><p>The surrounding alien races were all very curious. They wanted to see what kind of storm Lu Ming would stir up when he arrived at the holy mountain. After all, some of the top experts on the longevity Roll were in the holy mountain. Lu Ming would definitely have to fight with those existences on the holy mountain. They did not believe that Lu Ming could keep winning. Immediately, the large group of people followed behind Lu Ming and flew forward.</p><p>Soon, they flew out of the capital and headed west.</p><p>The holy city was to the West of the Imperial City and was also the center of the entire evil god World.</p><p>Mo tianluo led the way at a steady pace. Lu Ming was not in a hurry either. In the end, he took out a puppet and sat on it. He let the puppet travel while he focused on comprehending the various laws. He wanted to achieve perfection in all the laws as soon as possible and enter the great emperor realm.</p><p>Mo ping and Feng Feng turned into two streams of light and flew to the West, disappearing from everyone’s sight. It was likely that they had arrived at the holy mountain in advance to make preparations.</p><p>Just like that, after flying for a month, they arrived at a plain.</p><p>The demonic Sky Net slowed down even more when they arrived. Lu Ming noticed that all the members of the alien race had a solemn look on their faces. There was also respect and reverence, or even a kind of piety.</p><p>After flying for a while, a huge mountain appeared in front of them.</p><p>It was a huge mountain, and it truly reflected the meaning of the word ‘huge’.</p><p>It was an incomparably towering and massive mountain.</p><p>There was no vegetation on this mountain, but even from far away, one could feel the magnificence of this mountain.</p><p>The mountain was so high that it reached into the depths of the sky. As they slowly got closer, they realized that the area it occupied was even larger.</p><p>Lu Ming had never seen such a huge mountain peak.</p><p>“That’s…”</p><p>When he got closer, Lu Ming realized that there were a shocking number of alien races at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>At a glance, countless non-humans were sitting cross-legged on the holy mountain, as if they were cultivating.</p><p>There was a wide mountain road that led from the foot of the holy mountain to the top.</p><p>On the mountain paths were numerous outsiders who were slowly making their way up. When they reached a certain height, they would land on some rocks, or find a random spot to sit down cross-legged and cultivate.</p><p>The entire holy mountain was filled with people. The number of non-humans was shocking.</p><p>Lu Ming took a casual glance and discovered millions of alien races. This was only a corner of the holy mountain.</p><p>There were countless alien races on the holy mountain.</p><p>The most shocking thing was that these foreign kinds were all experts.</p><p>The worst was at the Saint realm.</p><p>The Martial Emperor realm was above that.</p><p>Lu Ming saw at least a hundred thousand martial emperors and more than ten thousand true emperors among the one million alien races.</p><p>There were so many experts in a corner. How many experts were there in the entire holy mountain?</p><p>Terrifying. It was truly terrifying. Lu Ming’s expression changed and he became extremely solemn.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming’s expression had changed, mo tianluo looked pleased. He flew over and said, ” “Lu Ming, let me tell you. The holy mountain is the residence of our race’s holy ancestor. He lives at the highest point!”</p><p>“Your race’s divine ancestor is in this holy mountain?”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help asking.</p><p>of course. The divine ancestor of our tribe lives at the peak of the holy mountain, so the entire holy mountain is the best Holy Land for cultivation for our tribe. When we cultivate on the holy mountain, we will be influenced by the aura of the divine ancestor. Over time, not only can you improve your cultivation, but you can also purify your bloodline, making yourself closer to the divine ancestor and making your bloodline purer!</p><p>Mo tianluo said proudly.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. So that was the case. No wonder there were so many powerful people gathered on the holy mountain.</p><p>The divine ancestor of the non-human race was an unimaginable existence. He was probably an existence that surpassed the celestial Emperor.</p><p>In that case, what was the relationship between the sacred ancestor bloodheart and the non-human sacred ancestor?</p><p>Lu Ming had more doubts in his heart.</p><p>let me tell you, there are many caves on the holy mountain. Many people in my tiibe have turned into ascetics and have been cultivating in those caves for countless years. I don’t know how many of them there are!</p><p>also, the higher you go, the higher your cultivation level will be. Near the top of the mountain, there are a large number of celestial emperors cultivating. The number is beyond your imagination!</p><p>now you know the strength of our tribe. Only a small part of our tribe is attacking the Tai Qing heavenly region. If we send out a large Army, the Tai Qing heavenly region will be turned into dust in an instant!</p><p>Mo tianluo said proudly.</p><p>Lu Ming was indeed very shocked.</p><p>The number of non-human experts on this Saint mountain was indeed terrifying. It was beyond his expectations.</p><p>From a distance, one could sense the terrifying auras on the entire sacred mountain. Although these auras were very obscure, Lu Ming had cultivated 81 types of laws and it was as if he was about to merge with the heaven and earth. His perception was also astonishingly strong, so he could sense them clearly. Those auras and waves of shocking pressure were all heavenly Emperor-level existences. The number of them made Lu Ming apprehensive.</p><p>The entire holy mountain was like a terrifying weapon of a Martial Emperor. It gave off a terrifying pressure.</p><p>It was as if he would be crushed into dust at any moment.</p><p>Mo tianluo was right. The forces that the foreign races had gathered outside the two world city could not compare to this holy mountain.</p><p>If all the powerful beings on this mountain moved together, the Tai Qing heavenly region would be turned into dust in an instant.</p><p>that’s impossible. It can’t be. If that’s the case, the alien races would have already broken through the two world city and the Tai Qing heavenly region. They wouldn’t have waited until now!</p><p>maybe there’s a hidden power in the heaven realm that I haven’t seen yet! also, there might be other reasons. If it could be destroyed, the heaven realm would have been destroyed by the alien races long ago!</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind whirred and he instantly thought of many things. He told himself to relax and his mood finally improved.</p><p>Mo tianluo sneered and walked toward the holy mountain.</p><p>When they were close to the holy mountain, a few beams of light flew out of the holy mountain.</p><p>Two of them were storm and Mo ping. Other than them, there were three other young men.</p><p>Of course, even though he looked young, he was definitely not young.</p><p>“It’s the three people on the longevity Roll. They’re sixty-fifth, fifty-ninth, and forty-third!”</p><p>Someone on the side recognized the three people.</p><p>as expected, most of the top experts on the longevity Roll are on the holy mountain. Three of them came all at once. It’s enough to take care of Lu Ming and let him know the power of our race!</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Seeing the three young men, many of the demonic humans were excited.</p><p>They had been following him for a long time just to see Lu Ming being beaten up.</p><p>“He’s the human who defeated you?”</p><p>One of the young men stepped forward and looked at Lu Ming coldly. His eyes were extremely sharp.</p><p>“He doesn’t look like much. I can easily defeat him!”</p><p>Another young man spoke, his voice filled with confidence.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
