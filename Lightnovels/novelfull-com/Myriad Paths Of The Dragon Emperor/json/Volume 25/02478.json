It kept attacking him, trying to push him back.</p><p>The nominator’s power that enveloped Lu Ming’s body was shaking more and more violently. There were even ripples in some places.</p><p>At this rate, Lu Ming would not be able to hold on for long. There was still at least a hundred meters ahead.</p><p>“Could it be that we’re going to stop here?”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself and felt a little indignant.</p><p>Although he did not know what was in front of him, or perhaps it would still be empty after he passed, Lu Ming was a little unwilling to leave without taking a look since he had already come this far.</p><p>“The Dao of domination rules over everything, including the power of heaven and earth. It’s reasonable to say that it rules over everything in the world, including this sword Qi!”</p><p>Many thoughts flashed through Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>Then, his eyes lit up and he growled, ” “Get out of my way, my Lord!”</p><p>He was using the Dao of sovereign as a medium to control the sword Qi through heaven and earth.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The sword Qi flew at high speed, but when it got close to Lu Ming, it curved and flew past him.</p><p>“It’s effective, it’s really effective!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He then focused on controlling the way of domination and the sword aura.</p><p>Indeed, when the sword Qi neared Lu Ming, it would curve and fly past him.</p><p>Lu Ming increased his speed and sped forward.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Heavenly venerate six sages and the others were dumbfounded.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s speed increased exponentially as he strode forward. Although there were more and more sword Qi in front of him, none of them could hit Lu Ming. Very soon, Lu Ming had crossed the distance of more than a hundred meters and passed through the formation.</p><p>“The Dao of a sovereign is truly profound. Can it really control all things in the world? that’s truly terrifying!”</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming was secretly delighted.</p><p>This way, he could even control the enemy’s attacks.</p><p>For example, if the opponent’s attack was about to hit him, he would control it and attack the enemy instead. What kind of scene would that be?</p><p>However, Lu Ming also understood that this had something to do with one’s cultivation and strength.</p><p>If the sword formation was stronger, Lu Ming would not be able to control it.</p><p>Similarly, if the opponent’s combat strength was too strong, Lu Ming would also find it difficult to control.</p><p>Everything was still related to his own strength.</p><p>” Everyone, Lu Ming will go to the front and take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming said to six sages and the rest.</p><p>“Go, be careful!”</p><p>The celestial said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and continued to move forward along the passageway.</p><p>Not long after, they reached the end of the passage. At the end of the passage was a stone room.</p><p>The stone room was empty. Lu Ming looked disappointed.</p><p>It seemed that he would have to return empty-handed again.</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming’s gaze was cast on a statue against the wall of the stone room.</p><p>This statue was a young man.</p><p>This person was very handsome and looked to be in his twenties.</p><p>His hands were behind his back, and his eyes were like stars. He exuded a domineering intent realm.</p><p>That’s right. It was the will of a ruler. It was very similar to the way of a ruler that Lu Ming had comprehended.</p><p>“How could this be? This intent is definitely the Dao of domination!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered, his eyes filled with shock.</p><p>At this moment, he let his imagination run wild, and many thoughts flashed through his mind.</p><p>Could it be that there was someone else in the world who had comprehended the Dao of a sovereign?</p><p>He couldn’t help but think back to when the foreign race’s divine ancestor had seen his power and seemed to have recognized it.</p><p>also, the ancestral Dragon recognized this power and called it ruler power.</p><p>In the past, Lu Ming had thought that the power that he had comprehended was unique.</p><p>This was because he had comprehended ten ultimate laws and seventy-one king path laws before he could comprehend the ruler’s path.</p><p>Now, it seemed that it was possible that someone else had comprehended the Dao of a ruler.</p><p>The owner of this statue must have also comprehended the Dao of a ruler, or else the ruler’s intent wouldn’t be so dense.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>It wasn’t a bad thing for him that someone else had comprehended the ruler’s path.</p><p>If he was the only one who had comprehended the Dao of domination, then he could only rely on himself to blindly explore. If someone else had comprehended the Dao of domination, then he would have a ready-made path to walk on.</p><p>“The will of a sovereign emanating from this statue will be of great use to me!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes brightened. He immediately sat down cross-legged and controlled the way of a sovereign. The power of a sovereign spread toward the statue.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>It seemed to have resonated with Lu Ming’s Dao of domination. The statue shook slightly and a layer of purple-gold light emanated from it.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming seemed to see a young man with his hands behind his back. He was unparalleled in his style and he ruled the world.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s understanding of The Way of the Master was slowly deepening.</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was comprehending the ruler’s Dao, outside the cursed land, King Feng Ming was standing guard with a group of people. He was waiting for Lu Ming to come out.</p><p>At this moment, a middle-aged man flew over with a panicked expression.</p><p>“Country ruler, something bad has happened!”</p><p>The middle-aged man shouted anxiously from a distance.</p><p>“What’s the matter?” King Feng Ming frowned.</p><p>country ruler, the yuan hai country, the great Yan country, and the bright moon country have joined forces and sent their armies to attack our Feng Ming country. We already have 18 cities that have been occupied by the other party!</p><p>The middle-aged man reported.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>King Feng Ming turned pale with fright.</p><p>“How is that possible? These three countries all have enmity with each other, how could they join forces to attack my country of Feng Ming?”</p><p>King Feng Ming simply couldn’t believe it.</p><p>“Report!”</p><p>At this moment, another burly man flew over.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>King Feng Ming said anxiously.</p><p>“Country ruler, the messengers from the source Ocean country, the bright moon country, and the great Yan country want to see you!”</p><p>The burly man reported.</p><p>meet him, quickly meet him. He’s just outside the capital!</p><p>King Feng Ming quickly said.</p><p>Then, he hurriedly brought his men back.</p><p>Two days later, monarch Feng Ming met with the emissaries from the Three Kingdoms outside the capital.</p><p>“That’s…”</p><p>To his shock, King Feng Ming discovered that beside the three envoys, there were a few strange looking people.</p><p>These people all had three eyes.</p><p>If Lu Ming was here, he would have known at a glance that these people were from the evil god race.</p><p>The emissaries from the other nations were all followed by people from the evil god tribe.</p><p>Furthermore, there was a four-star heavenly Emperor from the evil god tribe beside each emissary.</p><p>“Everyone, I wonder why you all want to join forces to attack my Feng Ming country?”</p><p>Asked King Feng Ming.</p><p>In particular, the bright moon country, which had a good relationship with the Fengming country, had come to attack the Fengming country, which made him confused.</p><p>“We’re just following orders!”</p><p>The envoy from the bright moon country said.</p><p>“Following orders?”</p><p>King Feng Ming was shocked.</p><p>that’s right. A Lord from the Dragonman Empire has ordered your Fengming Kingdom’s cursed land to allow these outsiders to enter the cursed land!</p><p>The envoy from the Mingyue Kingdom pointed at the evil god race and said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
