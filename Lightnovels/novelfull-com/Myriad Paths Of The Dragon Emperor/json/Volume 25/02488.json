He had the cultivation base of a six-star heavenly Emperor and the saber in his hand was also a heavenly Dao soldier.</p><p>However, the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron was no ordinary heaven Dao soldier.</p><p>The ancestral Dragon had told Lu Ming before that the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron was refined by the ancestral Dragon for the nine Dragons. It had taken both the ancestral Dragon and the nine Dragons ‘painstaking efforts. In the end, the nine Dragons had used it to suppress the passage. It was no trivial matter, and its power was far beyond that of an ordinary heaven Dao soldier.</p><p>In fact, it had already surpassed the category of heaven Dao soldiers.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>The six-star celestial Thearch’s saber kept hitting the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, causing sparks to fly and the cauldron to shake.</p><p>However, every time he collided with the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, the six-star heavenly Emperor’s body would shake. A powerful force blasted toward him, causing him to suffer heavy injuries.</p><p>After hundreds of collisions…</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The other party spat out a large mouthful of blood. Cracks appeared on his body, and fresh blood seeped out.</p><p>“Lu Ming, this time, our clan’s divine ancestor and the murderous heart divine ancestor will definitely recover to their peak. At that time, the heaven realm will be destroyed, and you will die without a burial place!”</p><p>The foreign celestial Thearch roared.</p><p>“Console yourself and go on your way!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He tried his best to control the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron and bombarded it one after another.</p><p>In the end, the six-star heavenly Emperor couldn’t hold on any longer. His body cracked and then exploded, and his body and spirit were destroyed.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, he kept the alien’s storage bracelet. Lu Ming was not in a hurry to collect the treasures. Instead, he rushed toward the passageway that the alien had just come in from.</p><p>He would first kill all the alien races and then collect the treasures.</p><p>When they arrived at the passage, they saw blood-red true dragons wandering around.</p><p>However, their numbers were much fewer than the ones on the right, and none of them were too strong. It was no wonder that the foreign races were able to rush over.</p><p>Lu Ming did not hold back. He controlled the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron and devoured all the blood-red true dragons.</p><p>He followed the path and walked outside. Indeed, there were some alien races guarding the place. They had all been killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming returned to the hall and began to collect the light orbs.</p><p>After spending a few days, Lu Ming finally put away all the treasures in the light orbs.</p><p>There were thirty-five heaven Dao soldier-level weapons and the rest were Emperor-level weapons. There were also a large number of divine stones. Lu Ming did not count them as they would be enough for a while.</p><p>Especially the 35 heaven Dao soldier grade treasures. If he brought them out, it would probably cause a huge commotion.</p><p>although this netherworld mountain is dangerous, it also comes with opportunities!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>I wonder how little Qing, bubbles, dandan, and Feng Ling are doing? ”</p><p>Lu Ming thought of Xie nianqing and the rest. He could not help but feel worried.</p><p>This Yellow Springs world could be said to be extremely dangerous.</p><p>Not only did they have to face the alien races, but they also had to face the experts of the yellow Springs world. If they were not careful, they would be in danger of dying.</p><p>Xie nianqing and dandan were both at the heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p>As for bubbles, Long Chen, Feng Ling, and the others, their cultivation levels were still low. There were also his two disciples. If they were to encounter the other party’s heavenly Emperor, they would probably be in danger.</p><p>All of this would depend on luck.</p><p>The vast netherworld mountain was huge and boundless. It was as big as the nine heaven domains of the heaven realm combined.</p><p>There were hundreds of forces in the various countries.</p><p>In addition, there were also large areas of wilderness.</p><p>There were many wilderness areas that were inaccessible to humans, but there were also Cursed Lands.</p><p>There was a huge Lake. The water in the lake was pitch-black, and it emitted a shocking demonic Qi.</p><p>A figure suddenly appeared here.</p><p>It was Xie nianqing.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s lips curled into a smile. He stepped into the lake and disappeared.</p><p>In another place, in the middle of the mountain range, a mountain range suddenly split open. Gravel flew everywhere, and smoke and dust filled the air.</p><p>When the dust settled, a huge tomb appeared in the direction of the crack in the mountain range. It was extremely huge and exuded a vast pressure.</p><p>A figure rushed out from the rubble.</p><p>hahaha, I knew there would be a huge tomb here. The treasures in this tomb will be mine!</p><p>The figure laughed and rushed into the tomb.</p><p>In another direction, there was a strange terrain. The ground here was filled with passages that were connected to each other like a beehive.</p><p>Two figures appeared at the entrance of a tunnel.</p><p>The two figures were Lu Ming’s two disciples, Lu Xiangxiang and Ouyang Moli.</p><p>I didn’t expect that there would be a cursed land in this barren mountain. Senior Sister, should we go down and explore? ”</p><p>Ouyang Moli asked.</p><p>The two of them were lucky. They didn’t expect to meet each other not long after entering netherworld mountain.</p><p>“Since we’re here, of course we have to go in!”</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang said.</p><p>huhu…</p><p>At this moment, a strong wind suddenly blew in the honeycomb-like caves, and a terrifying suction force gushed out.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang and Ouyang Moli were about to escape, but it was too late. They were swept into the cave by the force.</p><p>In other places, many people had their own fortuitous encounters and entered some wondrous places.</p><p>The people of netherworld mountain could not enter these places.</p><p>For example, Huang Ling, Long Chen, and the others had met the top experts of the heaven realm. They had explored a few Cursed Lands with them.</p><p>Of course, there were also those who were unlucky and met with alien races, and were killed by them.</p><p>Or, they were killed by the local experts of netherworld mountain.</p><p>Of course, there were also alien races who were killed by the heaven realm experts. Lu Ming, for example, had killed many alien races after entering netherworld mountain.</p><p>After Lu Ming kept all the treasures, he strolled around the hall. There were a few large doors in the hall.</p><p>There were two large doors. They were the doors that Lu Ming and the rest had entered from.</p><p>Lu Ming explored the rest one by one.</p><p>However, these doors led to other side halls, and there was nothing to gain from those side halls.</p><p>Very soon, there was only the last door left that Lu Ming had not explored.</p><p>Lu Ming walked in. He went through many passages and arrived at a small hall.</p><p>This Hall was also empty, with only a statue.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up at the sight of the statue.</p><p>This was because this statue was exactly the same as the statue that Lu Ming had seen in the legacy site in the country of Feng Ming.</p><p>Furthermore, this statue also exuded a ruler’s will that was many times stronger than the one in the country of Feng Ming.</p><p>could it be that there’s a statue like this in every cursed land? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were burning with passion.</p><p>To Lu Ming, the nominator’s intent on the statue was more precious than anything else.</p><p>It would allow Lu Ming’s understanding of The Way of the Master to deepen rapidly.</p><p>“Comprehension!”</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged in front of the statue and began to comprehend.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the path of domination and resonated with the statue. The statue emitted a strong domineering aura that enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming began to study it carefully.</p><p>The ruler’s will on this statue was much stronger than the one in the country of Fengming, so it would take much more time to comprehend it.</p><p>Lu Ming spent two years in comprehension.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
