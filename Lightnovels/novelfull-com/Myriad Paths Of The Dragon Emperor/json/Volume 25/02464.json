He was at the fifth stage of the insightful emptiness realm, but he was actually killed in an instant?</p><p>When many people looked at Lu Ming, the coldness in their eyes was completely different from just now.</p><p>Lu Ming’s ability to kill the bull-horned man with one move was enough to show that he could not be underestimated.</p><p>Mo you’s eyes also narrowed slightly, a trace of solemness flashing through them.</p><p>“Can I challenge you now?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze turned to mo you.</p><p>“You have some ability!”</p><p>A fierce light flashed in mo you’s eyes. With a wave of his hand, a blood-red saber appeared in his hand, emitting a bloody smell.</p><p>From this, it could be seen that many people had died in mo you’s hands.</p><p>“Little brother, you have to make him take out his guard token. That way, if you defeat him, you can obtain the position of commander guard!”</p><p>Xu Yuanshan reminded him.</p><p>” Hmph, you think he can defeat me?”</p><p>Mo you snorted coldly, but he still followed the rules and took out the guard token, putting it on his belt.</p><p>“Make your move!”</p><p>Mo you said ferociously.</p><p>“You should make the first move. I’ll give you a chance to make a move!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>What he meant was that once he made his move, he would have no chance.</p><p>Mo you’s expression turned ugly, revealing a cold killing intent. “Since you’re looking for death, I’ll fulfill your wish!”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Mo you’s figure was like a bolt of lightning, rushing toward Lu Ming and slashing the saber in his hand.</p><p>It was fast, accurate, and powerful.</p><p>Lu Ming stood still. In his palm, the power of domination condensed into a long spear, which he held in front of him.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Mo you’s saber stood on Lu Ming’s long spear. Lu Ming’s body was as steady as Mount Tai and he did not move.</p><p>The huge rebound force made mo you’s body shake violently and he retreated continuously.</p><p>his combat strength is indeed powerful!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>In the heaven realm, mo you’s fighting power was considered strong even among peak great emperors.</p><p>There were strong and weak cultivators in the same realm. Mo you was considered strong among peak great emperors.</p><p>However, it was nothing in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>At this moment, mo you was extremely shocked.</p><p>He had used all his strength in that move just now, intending to kill Lu Ming in one move. However, the final result was that Lu Ming did not move at all. Instead, he was forced to retreat.</p><p>At this moment, he understood that Lu Ming’s ability was above his.</p><p>“No, I can’t just give up my position as a guard for nothing!”</p><p>Mo you roared in his heart.</p><p>In Fengming country, there were a total of 13 commanders. Each of them led an Army and held a high position.</p><p>And each commander only had eighteen guards.</p><p>One could imagine how great the power of this position was. It was hard to come by, and he did not want to give it up.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>He turned around and ran. He had actually fled without fighting.</p><p>“Since you’ve already accepted the challenge, don’t you think it’s too late to run?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold voice was heard. His muscles trembled and his body rushed towards mo you like lightning. The long spear in his hand was thrust out at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>Mo you was shocked. He wanted to turn around to defend, but it was too late.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The long spear pierced through mo you’s head and killed him.</p><p>Mo you’s body fell heavily to the ground. His eyes were wide open, and he died with grievances.</p><p>He had come this time with the intention of taking the Xu family into his own pocket and taking the Xu family’s beautiful young lady under his belt. He had not expected to lose his life here.</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out his hand and the guard token on mo you’s belt flew into his hand.</p><p>Mo you’s men all looked frightened and then turned to run, scattering in a hubbub.</p><p>“Mo you is dead!”</p><p>At first, Xu Rong, Xu Yuanshan, and the others were stunned, but then they became ecstatic.</p><p>Now that mo you was dead, the divine stones that big brother Xu Rong owed mo you would naturally be gone. No one would find trouble with them anymore, so they were naturally happy.</p><p>“Thank you, brother Lu Ming, for saving me!”</p><p>Xu Yuanshan had already learned of Lu Ming’s name from Xu Rong and came over to express his gratitude.</p><p>you’re too polite. I only made a move because I wanted to get the position of his guard!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled, then picked up the token in his hand and asked, ” “Senior, how do I use this token?”</p><p>that’s simple. As long as you take this token and meet the Lord Commander, as long as the Lord Commander agrees, you will naturally be able to inherit the position of the commander’s guard. Under normal circumstances, the Lord Commander will agree, because the stronger you are, the more beneficial it is to the Lord Commander!</p><p>Xu Yuanshan explained.</p><p>Back then, when mo you had forced the Xu family, Xu Yuanshan had challenged mo you, hoping to defeat him and get his guard position. In this way, the Xu family’s crisis could be resolved. Unfortunately, he was not mo you’s match and was instead seriously injured by mo you.</p><p>“Father, it’s all thanks to Lu Ming that we were able to capture the Jade-Blood Fox!”</p><p>Xu Rong said.</p><p>“You caught the Jade-Blood Fox?”</p><p>Xu Yuanshan was overjoyed. He then thanked Lu Ming solemnly.</p><p>Lu Ming was really the benefactor of the Xu family.</p><p>First, he helped them catch the Jade-Blood Fox and his injuries could be treated. Then, he killed mo you. Without Lu Ming, the Xu family would really be finished.</p><p>He was very grateful to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, come in and have a seat. Men, prepare a banquet!”</p><p>Xu Yuanshan welcomed Lu Ming into the Xu family and instructed the servants to prepare a banquet.</p><p>The surrounding onlookers also dispersed.</p><p>All of this was not surprising to them.</p><p>In the country of Feng Ming, such challenges were common.</p><p>Not only were there people challenging the guards of the commanders, there were even people challenging the commanders.</p><p>The Xu family treated Lu Ming warmly as a distinguished guest.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming stayed at the Xu family for a few days. He read through the huge amount of information that the Xu family had collected and had a better understanding of nether mountain.</p><p>There were many races in netherworld mountain.</p><p>There were the bull-headed race, the scaled race, the serpent-men race, and so on. There were dozens of races of all sizes.</p><p>Moreover, the cultivation realm in netherworld mountain was very different from that in the heaven realm.</p><p>The first few stages were basically the same, but after reaching the Martial Emperor realm, it was very different.</p><p>The Martial Emperor realm in netherworld mountain was divided into the void prying stage, true void stage, void interpretation stage, and void transformation stage. Each stage was divided into seven stages.</p><p>They corresponded to the void Emperor, the true Emperor, the great emperor, and the heavenly Emperor.</p><p>For example, mo you was at the peak of the void realm, which was the same as a peak great emperor.</p><p>As for the living beings of netherworld mountain, they didn’t cultivate any nomological laws or great DAOs. They didn’t even come into contact with the heavenly Dao. What they cultivated was pure power.</p><p>Above the transformation void martial stage was the God Realm, also known as God. This point was exactly like what the ancestral Dragon had said.</p><p>The living beings here called netherworld mountain the netherworld world.</p><p>Within the yellow Springs world, there were hundreds of factions and countries, each occupying a region and ruling a region.</p><p>As for the country of Fengming, it was only a small country on the edge of the yellow Springs world.</p><p>In addition, Lu Ming also saw the records about the cursed land.</p><p>There were some places in the yellow Springs world that the living beings here could not enter at all. If they entered, they would die. The living beings of the yellow Springs world called them the cursed Lands.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
