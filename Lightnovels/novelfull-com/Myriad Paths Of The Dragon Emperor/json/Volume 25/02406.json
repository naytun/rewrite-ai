He turned into a stream of light and pounced toward the two foreign celestial thearchs.</p><p>Along the way, the bodies of some of the other alien races exploded.</p><p>The two foreign celestial thearchs ‘expressions changed drastically. They did not hope to achieve anything, but they hoped that they would not make any mistakes. The two of them joined forces to defend with all their might. However, they were still hit by Lu Ming with one move and spat out mouthfuls of blood. They almost died.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>The Titan longhorn beetle’s voice resounded through the sky. Its horns were like scimitars as it slashed at its opponent.</p><p>you want to save people with your severely injured bodies? don’t even think about leaving today!</p><p>The non-human King let out a roar. His entire body was covered in purple light, and his battle-power was incomparably powerful. He fought an intense battle with the Titan longhorn beetle.</p><p>If the Titan longhorn beetle was at its peak during the ancient times, he wouldn’t be its opponent at all. However, in the battle of the ancient times, the Titan longhorn beetle had been seriously injured and had yet to recover. He had no fear at all.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Titan longhorn beetle roared. Its roar shook the heavens, and the void collapsed. Its power was terrifying.</p><p>In the distance, Earth One and Thunder one were still fighting with an unparalleled expert of the foreign tribe. However, at this moment, the roar of the Titan longhorn beetle came rushing over. The unparalleled expert’s expression changed as he tried his best to block it and retreated a few steps.</p><p>With that, Earth One and Thunder one finally found an opportunity to escape. They retreated ten thousand miles and came to Lu Ming’s side.</p><p>“Young master, let’s go!”</p><p>Earth One roared.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was affected by the Titan longhorn beetle and managed to regain a trace of clarity. He also understood the current situation and that it was better to leave.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>They quickly retreated.</p><p>“Stay!”</p><p>At this moment, a loud shout came from the sky. Then, the sky cracked open, and a huge purple hand stretched out from the sky. It covered the sky and the sun. It was extremely huge, and it grabbed at Lu Ming, tu Yi, and Lei Yi.</p><p>The pressure was so strong that it was terrifying. It was the most powerful expert that Lu Ming had encountered so far.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils contracted rapidly.</p><p>The other party didn’t attack through that passage, but directly broke through the void.</p><p>if the enemy was in the evil god World, they could actually break through the void and attack. This kind of strength was just too terrifying, not good! Heavenly Emperor at the peak of the heavenly Emperor realm, retreat!</p><p>Dandan shouted.</p><p>However, there was no way to retreat in the face of this huge palm.</p><p>“Young master, leave quickly!”</p><p>Earth One roared, and then burst out with all his strength. He pushed the meteor hammer to the extreme and blasted it toward the large hand.</p><p>At the same time, Lei Yi activated the heaven Dao soldier with all his might and attacked the hand.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with cold killing intent. His body was covered with bone spikes, making him look extremely ferocious. He also attacked the big hand.</p><p>The three of them joined forces, and their power reached the extreme. They bombarded the giant purple hand.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Three earth-shaking explosions occurred in a row, and the air waves whistled like mountains and seas.</p><p>The two heaven Dao soldiers trembled violently before flying back. Earth One and Thunder one were jolted back by the force and were sent flying tens of thousands of miles.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled violently as well. He spat out a large mouthful of blood and his body flew backward.</p><p>However, just as his body was about to fly backward, the huge purple hand burst out with an extremely powerful suction force. It sucked Lu Ming in and flew towards the huge purple hand.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The Titan longhorn beetle and the tall and thin man named nine lives wanted to help, but they were held back by two foreign tribe royal family members.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming flew directly to the palm of the big hand.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming burst out in a frenzy and attacked with all his might, but it was useless. The big hand was firm and immortal, and its strength was extremely strong. He could not break it at all.</p><p>The next moment, the big hand clenched and grabbed Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, a terrifying and boundless energy gushed into Lu Ming’s body. Lu Ming’s body trembled, and the last bit of consciousness he had turned blurry and he lost consciousness.</p><p>After the big hand grabbed Lu Ming, it shrank back.</p><p>“Young master!”</p><p>Earth One and Thunder one roared and wanted to save him.</p><p>“Don’t be rash. The person who attacked is a peak heavenly Emperor. Although he attacked from a great distance and his power is greatly reduced, Lu Ming has already been captured by him. We can’t save him with our strength. Retreat first!”</p><p>The Titanos roared.</p><p>The aura on his body became stronger and stronger. He suddenly roared and forced his opponent to retreat.</p><p>Titan, take them away first. I’ll block the foreign tribe!</p><p>The tall and thin middle-aged man said. The aura on his body became stronger and stronger, and his attacking power became more and more astonishing. He actually managed to block the two non-human royal families.</p><p>with a heavily injured body, he can barely unleash an outburst. He can forget about recovering to his peak in his entire life!</p><p>A non-human King roared.</p><p>However, the two of them were blocked by the tall and thin man. The Titan longhorn beetle’s huge body rushed towards dandan and the others.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Even the first non-human expert couldn’t block his roar. His body trembled and he retreated.</p><p>The bodies of the two ordinary foreign heavenly emperors exploded, and their bodies and souls were destroyed.</p><p>A large number of non-humans below the heavenly Emperor level died.</p><p>The Titan longhorn beetle’s huge body came to dandan and the others ‘side. A wave of power rolled them up and rushed toward Earth One and Thunder one.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>Pao Pao cried out, her eyes staring straight ahead.</p><p>At this moment, the big hand that was grabbing Lu Ming had already retracted and disappeared in the space of eternal nothingness.</p><p>Al!</p><p>The Titan longhorn beetle also sighed inwardly.</p><p>It wasn’t that he didn’t want to save her, but that he couldn’t.</p><p>The other party was too strong. He was an existence at the peak of the heavenly Emperor realm, a true peak expert.</p><p>If he was at his peak, he could compete with the other party. Unfortunately, he had been seriously injured in the ancient battle and had not recovered yet. His strength had been greatly reduced and he was not the other party’s opponent at all.</p><p>“Let’s go, inform the heaven realm experts and send people to guard this place!”</p><p>The Titan longhorn beetle activated another wave of power and swept up Earth One and Thunder one, flying into the distance at top speed.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The two non-human Kings roared and attacked crazily, trying to kill the tall and thin man.</p><p>However, the tall and thin man’s strength was above the Titan longhorn beetle’s. At this moment, he didn’t care about his injuries and erupted with a shocking attack, forcing back the two people in one fell swoop. His figure flickered, shattering the void and disappearing.</p><p>The two non-human Kings ‘faces were extremely dark.</p><p>the rest of you, retreat to our realm first. When the passage is fully opened, attack here. The heaven realm and the primordial realm will fall into the hands of our race sooner or later!</p><p>A non-human King shouted and then turned around.</p><p>Not long after, dandan, bubbles, tu Yi, Lei Yi, the Titan longhorn beetle, and the tall and thin man gathered on a mountain peak in the yuan continent.</p><p>“Tai Tan, nine lives, this time, many thanks for your rescue!”</p><p>Dandan sighed.</p><p>I also accidentally discovered the abnormality here, so I asked the Titan to come with me. I didn’t expect to encounter this scene!</p><p>The tall, thin man sighed.</p><p>This tall and thin man was the nine lives devilish silkworm, one of the top ten Battle Beasts.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, will he be alright?”</p><p>Bubble was extremely worried.</p><p>I don’t think so. Lu Ming’s bloodline has an astonishing origin. Judging from the conversation just now, the other party wouldn’t kill Lu Ming!</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>During the previous battle, the other party had shouted not to kill Lu Ming and would kill everyone else without mercy. This made dandan think of many things.</p><p>“I hope so!”</p><p>Earth One and Thunder one sighed.</p><p>“Let’s go back to the heaven realm and spread the news!”</p><p>Dandan said. Then, everyone’s figures flashed and they left the place.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
