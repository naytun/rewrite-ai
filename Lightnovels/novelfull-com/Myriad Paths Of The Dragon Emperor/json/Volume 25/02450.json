He secretly heaved a sigh of relief when he realized that everyone was fine.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s you!”</p><p>Not far away, mo tianluo’s eyes were cold and filled with ferocious killing intent as he stared at Lu Ming.</p><p>Mo tianluo naturally knew that the entire prison suppression field had disappeared after the battle. He also knew that the people from the prison suppression field had come to the heaven realm.</p><p>mo tianluo, what a coincidence! I’ll send you on your way today!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“Hahaha, what big words. Kill him!”</p><p>Mo tianluo shouted and ordered his men to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s combat strength was strong and could even suppress the first Prince, there were a few celestial thearchs here. He wanted Lu Ming to die Here today.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The two one-star heavenly emperors shouted and rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, be careful!”</p><p>Huang Ling and the others couldn’t help but exclaim.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s eyes were calm and the corners of his mouth curled into a cold smile. Purple-gold light emanated from his body and condensed into a purple-gold spear.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>His muscles trembled, and his body rushed toward one of the one-star heavenly emperors at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming’s physical body had broken through to the heavenly Emperor realm, his muscles could vibrate ten billion times in an instant. Wherever he passed, the void seemed to turn into a black hole, and everything was shattered.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The long spear swept out and swept toward that one star heavenly Emperor.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Lu Ming’s spear swept out. The foreign celestial Thearch felt extremely terrifying as if he was about to be crushed by this spear.</p><p>He screamed hysterically and tried to block it with all his might, but it was in vain.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The non-human celestial Thearch’s body was like a sandbag that had been smashed into bits and pieces, flying everywhere.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes widened.</p><p>Not only dandan, bubble, Huang Ling, and the rest, but a heavenly Army that was fighting the alien races in the distance was also shocked.</p><p>That was a celestial Thearch, but he was killed by Lu Ming in seconds and exploded in the air. The impact was too strong.</p><p>Mo tianluo was even more dumbfounded.</p><p>A few years ago, in the evil god Realm, Lu Ming had challenged the longevity Roll. Although he was strong back then, he was only slightly stronger than the first Prince. Although he was invincible among the great emperors, there was still a gap between him and the celestial Thearch.</p><p>However, it had only been a short while and Lu Ming could blow up a celestial Thearch with one shot. This kind of combat strength was too terrifying. It had improved too quickly and it made him feel frightened.</p><p>At this moment, the other non-human heavenly Emperor was almost scared to death. He quickly retreated.</p><p>“It’s too late to leave now!”</p><p>let’s go! Lu Ming said coldly. His muscles trembled and he dashed forward. In a few breaths, he caught up with the alien.</p><p>“Save me!”</p><p>The foreign celestial Thearch roared and charged toward the two star celestial Thearch.</p><p>He wanted that two-star heavenly Emperor to save him, but he was controlling the heaven Dao soldiers with all his might, constantly bombarding the other party, making it difficult for the other party to have the opportunity to help. Lu Ming had already arrived. His long spear swept out and enveloped a radius of ten thousand miles.</p><p>The foreign celestial Thearch couldn’t Dodge, and he let out a desperate roar as he fought back.</p><p>However, he was only a one-star heavenly Emperor. How could he block Lu Ming’s attack? the long spear swept past, and he followed in the footsteps of the foreign tribe member and was blown up in the air.</p><p>Lu Ming flashed past and kept the other party’s storage bracelet.</p><p>“Run, run, run!”</p><p>While Lu Ming was charging toward the alien, mo tianluo had already fled frantically.</p><p>The rest of the Army followed him and fled.</p><p>“Stop him! Stop him for this Prince! Do you hear me?!”</p><p>Mo tianluo ordered his subordinates.</p><p>However, no one listened to him. What a joke. If they stopped to stop Lu Ming, they would die. Who would be so foolish?</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was chasing after mo tianluo.</p><p>Mo tianluo was so scared that he almost cried. He roared madly, ” stop him! Stop him! If you dare to disobey my orders, I’ll kill your entire family! I’ll exterminate your entire clan!</p><p>However, the other alien races ran even faster than him.</p><p>“It seems like no one is helping you!”</p><p>A cold voice came from behind mo tianluo.</p><p>Mo tianluo was so shocked that he jumped up.</p><p>“Lu Ming, please spare me…”</p><p>Mo tianluo shrieked. He was already scared out of his wits and didn’t dare to resist at all.</p><p>“You’ve tried to kill me and my friends time and time again. Is it possible for me to spare you?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He shook his long spear and a terrifying force crushed mo tianluo. Mo tianluo screamed in pain and his body turned into dust. He died.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, the two-star heavenly Emperor was going all out. After exchanging a blow with dandan, he seized the opportunity to escape.</p><p>“Don’t even think about leaving!”</p><p>Dandan roared and controlled the heaven Dao soldier to chase after the other party with all its might. Powerful rays of light burst out from the heaven Dao soldier and blasted towards the other party.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he also unleashed his speed to the maximum and chased after the other party.</p><p>“Kill, kill all the outsiders!”</p><p>At this moment, bubbles, Ouyang Wushuang, and the rest led their Army and chased after the foreign races that were running away.</p><p>Lu Ming’s speed was extremely fast. In addition, the two-star heavenly Emperor was being closely followed by dandan, so it was difficult for him to fully display his speed. Soon, Lu Ming caught up with him.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming threw the long spear condensed by the way of domination at the two- star celestial Thearch of the foreign tribe at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>The third eye of the two-star celestial Thearch shot out a beam of destructive light that collided with Lu Ming’s long spear. Although he managed to block it, he could not help but pause for a moment.</p><p>In this way, dandan took the opportunity to catch up and control the heaven Dao soldier. The small tower turned into a giant tower, emitting a vast pressure of the heaven Dao, and suppressed the other party.</p><p>The great desolation spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming’s physical body had reached the heavenly Emperor realm, he could fully activate the power of the heaven Dao soldier.</p><p>The muscles on Lu Ming’s palm trembled and the great desolation spear trembled violently as well. The pressure of the heavenly Dao spread out.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming arrived and thrust the great desolation spear.</p><p>The two-star celestial Thearch of the alien race blocked dandan’s attack. He wielded his giant axe and hacked at Lu Ming.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>With a deafening boom, the two-star celestial Thearch’s body trembled violently, and he was forced to retreat as he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>One move and he was injured.</p><p>Moreover, the battleaxe in his hand began to crack.</p><p>A two-star heavenly Emperor was indeed much stronger than a one-star heavenly Emperor.</p><p>However, he did not have a heaven Dao soldier. On the other hand, the current Lu Ming could fight a two-star heavenly Emperor with just his physical body and the great desolation spear. With the addition of the ruler’s Dao, Lu Ming’s combat strength was completely above that of a two-star heavenly Emperor.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and charged forward again.</p><p>At the same time, dandan also controlled the heaven Dao soldier and charged over.</p><p>Being besieged by Lu Ming and dandan, the other party was even more outmatched. Even if they tried their best, it would be useless.</p><p>After barely blocking a few moves, Lu Ming’s spear struck his body, almost splitting him in two. Then, he controlled the heaven Dao soldier to suppress and kill this person completely.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
