It was covered in cracks, and finally exploded with a bang.</p><p>“It exploded!”</p><p>Lu Ming was filled with anticipation and ran up to take a look.</p><p>In the country of Fengming, the statue had exploded. There was a fiery red fruit growing under the statue. After Lu Ming refined it, his physical body had a breakthrough.</p><p>What would it be this time?</p><p>There was nothing!</p><p>When Lu Ming went up to take a look, he realized that there was a flat floor under the statue. There was nothing.</p><p>Lu Ming was indignant. He searched the area carefully but still did not find anything.</p><p>“I was too greedy!”</p><p>Lu Ming touched his nose and smiled bitterly.</p><p>It seemed that it was pure coincidence that there was a fiery red fruit growing under the statue in Fengming.</p><p>Moreover, he had gained a lot this time. Lu Ming was satisfied.</p><p>it’s been more than two years. It’s time to leave!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and left the place.</p><p>After arriving at the platform outside, Lu Ming’s body began to transform rapidly with a single thought. In the end, he turned into a purple-haired royal member of the evil god tribe. A third eye appeared between his brows.</p><p>Lu Ming swaggered out of the cursed land.</p><p>A group of dragonians was still standing guard outside the cursed land.</p><p>“He’s out!”</p><p>The group of dragonians perked up when they saw Lu Ming.</p><p>After all, it had been two years, and there had been no movement from the cursed Lands. They had thought that all of the evil god race members had died in there.</p><p>“How is it?”</p><p>“What did you find in there?”</p><p>A group of dragonians surrounded Lu Ming after he came out.</p><p>everyone, we’ve encountered a troublesome matter inside. We don’t have enough manpower, and another group of experts from my clan has arrived. I’m going to go and help!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“So that’s how it is, then go!”</p><p>The dragonians did not suspect him and let Lu Ming go.</p><p>Lu Ming left this place easily and found a hidden place. He transformed into a Dragonman and swaggered to the capital of the Dragonman Kingdom.</p><p>In the Dragonman Kingdom’s capital, Lu Ming began to collect a large number of materials related to the cursed land.</p><p>If there was a statue in every cursed land, it would be of great use to Lu Ming.</p><p>He might be able to cultivate his ruler Dao to an extremely high level in netherworld mountain.</p><p>To Lu Ming, time was the only thing he was lacking.</p><p>After all, Lu Ming had only been cultivating for less than two hundred years. To the celestial Thearch who had been cultivating for hundreds of thousands or millions of years, it was just a fraction of the total.</p><p>If the foreign race’s divine ancestor managed to obtain a healing treasure on this trip to netherworld mountain, the final battle would be upon them.</p><p>Before that, Lu Ming had to make the best use of his time and improve quickly.</p><p>Lu Ming had stayed in the capital of the Dragonman Empire for two months. He had read a large number of ancient books and records about the cursed Lands.</p><p>There were many Cursed Lands in netherworld mountain.</p><p>Some were located in important places such as near the capital of Feng Ming country and the Dragonman Empire. These places were usually guarded by experts from the native living beings of netherworld mountain.</p><p>As for the cursed Lands in the wild, because they were too isolated and the locals could not enter, they were rarely visited by people and were often left unattended.</p><p>Lu Ming’s target was the cursed Lands in the wild.</p><p>“Let’s go to Yan Ming mountain!”</p><p>Lu Ming confirmed his target and left the capital of the Dragonman Empire.</p><p>After traveling more than a hundred thousand miles, he transformed into his true form and summoned heavenly venerate six sages and the rest from the small world.</p><p>senior six saints, I’m going to Yan Ming mountain next…</p><p>Lu Ming told him his goal.</p><p>“We’ll go with you!”</p><p>The celestial said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. The group moved together and headed towards Yan Mingshan.</p><p>Blazing mountain was extremely remote and was located in the wilderness. There were very few people there, but there was a cursed place, blazing mountain.</p><p>After flying for tens of millions of miles, they arrived at the Yanming underground Palace.</p><p>However, they were attacked the moment they entered.</p><p>This underground Palace had a type of puppet that was covered in flames and was very powerful.</p><p>The group broke through all the way in.</p><p>This underground Palace should not have been plundered by anyone. Everyone had obtained many good things. However, compared to Lu Ming’s gains in the Dragon people Empire, these were considered small.</p><p>Lu Ming saw another statue in the depths of the underground palace.</p><p>“Who exactly is the owner of this statue? There’s a statue in every cursed land.</p><p>Could it be the master of netherworld mountain?”</p><p>Lu Ming guessed in his heart.</p><p>Moreover, this statue also had a strong sense of domination.</p><p>However, compared to the statue in the cursed land of the Dragonman Empire, it was not much different. Lu Ming spent some time and completely understood it.</p><p>The statue also shattered, but there was still nothing under the statue.</p><p>After that, they left the Yanming underground Palace and headed to the next cursed land.</p><p>In the following days, Lu Ming and the rest went to various Cursed Lands in the wilderness. Some of them had some gains, but some of them were empty. Obviously, they had been plundered.</p><p>However, to Lu Ming, every cursed land was a treasure trove.</p><p>This was because there was a statue in every cursed land.</p><p>Heavenly venerate six saints and the rest knew that the statue would be of great use to Lu Ming. Therefore, they waited patiently in every cursed zone.</p><p>Moreover, they had encountered alien races in some of the cursed Lands and fought them. However, with Lu Ming’s current combat strength, he could easily defeat those alien races.</p><p>Just like that, time passed by quickly. In the blink of an eye, twenty years had passed.</p><p>In the past twenty years, Lu Ming and the rest had explored no less than twenty Cursed Lands.</p><p>Unfortunately, many of the statues in the cursed Lands did not have a strong Dominator’s will. Lu Ming could easily comprehend them, but it did not improve his Dao of domination much.</p><p>Even so, Lu Ming’s cultivation level had improved and he had become a five star great emperor.</p><p>Lu Ming’s abilities had also improved.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming had unleashed his full power, the combination of the way of domination and his physical body was enough to rival a six-star heavenly Emperor.</p><p>“I still need to find some large Cursed Lands!”</p><p>Lu Ming was deep in thought as he sat cross-legged under a statue in the cursed land.</p><p>Over the years, Lu Ming had come to a conclusion. In a small-scale cursed land, the Dominator’s aura on the statue was relatively thin.</p><p>The larger it was, the stronger the Dominator’s intent was and the more useful it was to Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
