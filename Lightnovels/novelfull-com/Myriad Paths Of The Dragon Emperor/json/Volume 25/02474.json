He aimed at Lu Ming’s vital parts from a tricky angle.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s long spear shook and turned into rays of spear light, blocking all the saber lights.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two of them had exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>The two of them fought from the courtyard of the governor’s mansion up into the sky, their Qi spreading out in all directions like a storm.</p><p>However, Luo Mo’s figure was continuously pushed back as the energy spread out.</p><p>Every time he collided with Lu Ming’s long spear, he would have to take a step back. After dozens of moves, he had already taken dozens of steps back.</p><p>“Damn it, how is this possible? How can he be so strong?”</p><p>Luo mo roared in his heart.</p><p>With his cultivation base at the peak of the third level void transformation stage, only the King of Feng Ming could suppress him in Feng Ming country. Now, Lu Ming, who did not seem to have a high cultivation base, actually had a stronger combat strength than him. He could not believe it.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>Bleu, who was in the crowd, roared in his heart. His face was completely twisted.</p><p>His cultivation had been crippled by Lu Ming. He was looking forward to Rama defeating Lu Ming and even crippling Lu Ming’s cultivation so that Lu Ming would be better off dead.</p><p>Unfortunately, his wish was destined to never come true.</p><p>Liao min and the others were overjoyed.</p><p>They knew that they had made the right bet. Lu Ming was completely capable of dealing with Rama. They were not afraid.</p><p>“Kill, kill!”</p><p>die! Luo mo roared in the sky as he used all his strength. His body was even surrounded by a blood-red mist.</p><p>The scimitar in his hand was also covered with a layer of blood-red light. Its power was instantly increased by a level and it could actually fight with Lu Ming without being at a disadvantage.</p><p>the creatures in netherworld mountain are much stronger than those in the heaven realm or the evil god Realm!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He was a little surprised.</p><p>In the outside world, given Lu Ming’s combat strength, he could probably kill a three-star celestial Thearch with the Dao of domination and many moves, unless the other party was shockingly talented.</p><p>But now, he could only barely gain an advantage against Rama with his ruler’s Dao.</p><p>The creatures of netherworld mountain cultivated extremely condensed power.</p><p>The combat skills they cultivated, when combined with that power, were shockingly powerful and invincible.</p><p>In this aspect, he was a little like Xie nianqing!</p><p>However, Xie nianqing was stronger!</p><p>Rama, is this your full strength? then let’s end this!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, all the muscles and bones in his body started to shake.</p><p>At the same time, the long spear in his hand disappeared and was replaced by the great desolation spear.</p><p>Lu Ming used his physical strength, the heaven Dao soldier, and the great desolation spear.</p><p>With the two enhancements, Lu Ming’s combat strength increased tremendously.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The great desolation spear swept out and collided with Luo Mo’s scimitar, causing a shocking explosion.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The scimitar in Rama’s hand kept shaking. The terrifying power sent him flying. His arm was almost broken. The qi and blood in his body churned, and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“You… Weapon?”</p><p>Luo mo was shocked.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming did not give Rama any chance to catch his breath. He kept stabbing with the great desolation spear. The Spear’s gleam was thousands of miles long and pierced through the space, aiming at Rama.</p><p>Rama was shocked and tried to block frantically. However, he could not block it at all. Every time he blocked a spear radiance, he would be sent flying. After blocking more than a dozen of them, there was finally an opening. Lu Ming’s spear pierced through his chest, leaving a large hole in it.</p><p>Luo mo spat out a mouthful of blood. Under the destructive power, half of his body exploded.</p><p>He was severely injured, and his strength was greatly reduced.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped in the air and swept the great desolation spear.</p><p>“No, no, I’m willing to surrender…”</p><p>Rama shouted in fear.</p><p>He understood that he was not Lu Ming’s match. If he did not surrender, he would die.</p><p>“I’ve given you a chance before, but you didn’t know how to cherish it!” Lu Ming said coldly. He would not give his opponent another chance. He wanted to establish his might with this battle.</p><p>The long spear carried a terrifying power as it crushed over.</p><p>Luo Mo’s combat power was greatly reduced, and he was unable to avoid it. He could only block with his scimitar.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The great desolation spear swept across his curved blade and struck his body heavily. He was sent flying like a broken sack. In the process of flying, his body exploded into several pieces.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming thrust his spear across the air. A ray of spear light pierced through the void and destroyed Rama’s soul. Then, a wave of energy rolled and Rama’s storage ring was kept in his hand.</p><p>Luo mo was dead!</p><p>The entire place was silent!</p><p>Everyone knew that with Rama’s death, the rankings of the remaining commanders would definitely change.</p><p>Plop!</p><p>In the crowd, Bleu’s body went limp and he fell to the ground, his face filled with despair.</p><p>Lu Ming cast a cold glance at Bleu but did not kill him.</p><p>A cripple should be left to fend for himself!</p><p>the commander is mighty! The commander is invincible!</p><p>Liao min shouted in excitement.</p><p>Following that, the other guards who did not betray Lu Ming also shouted in excitement.</p><p>They knew that they had made the right bet, so they were naturally excited.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across Rama’s subordinates and guards.</p><p>Under Lu Ming’s gaze, the guards and subordinates shivered and broke out in cold sweat.</p><p>if any of you want to avenge Rama, feel free to attack. I’ll take you all on!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>Those people’s faces were covered with cold sweat.</p><p>“The commander is invincible. We are willing to serve the commander!” Immediately, a few people rushed out and saluted Lu Ming respectfully, you guys still have the face to serve the commander. You’re really shameless! Liao min berated them. This was because these people were Lu Ming’s guards and they had previously sided with Rama.</p><p>“Hey!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and stopped Liao min. He smiled and said, ” “This commander is magnanimous. As long as you come back and do your best for this commander, I will let bygones be bygones!”</p><p>To Lu Ming, netherworld mountain was just a passer-by. He would not stay there for long.</p><p>The most important thing for him now was to borrow the power here to find foreign races and obtain information about the cursed Lands to obtain opportunities.</p><p>Therefore, he didn’t care whether the other party would betray him or what kind of heart he had. As long as he could use him, it was fine.</p><p>He had already crippled Bleu and killed Rama. It was enough to kill the chicken to warn the monkeys.</p><p>“Many thanks, commander!”</p><p>The few of them were ecstatic.</p><p>“You’re the same. Surrender to me now and work for me, and I’ll let bygones be bygones!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Rama’s subordinates.</p><p>Those people looked at each other, then saluted Lu Ming in unison. They said loudly, ” “I’m willing to serve the commander!”</p><p>“I’m willing to serve the commander!”</p><p>Instantly, all of Rama’s subordinates saluted Lu Ming to show their allegiance. At this moment, an old man in official robes flew over and said, ” the king has given the order to appoint Lu Ming as the first commander. He will be in charge of all the armies and territories of Rama!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
