They looked at Lu Ming with a grave expression.</p><p>To be able to kill Yi Yang, his combat power had already surpassed most of the commanders. Only some of the higher-ranked commanders could do it.</p><p>Commander Rama’s eyes were cold, but he didn’t say anything.</p><p>Among the crowd, bambu and Liao min were the most shocked.</p><p>“So strong, he’s so strong? How did this happen?”</p><p>Bleu muttered, his eyes filled with shock.</p><p>At the thought that he had offended Lu Ming previously, he could not help but shiver.</p><p>Lu Ming could even kill commander Yi Yang. It would be a piece of cake to kill him.</p><p>alright, Lu Ming, you’ve killed Yi Yang and replaced him. You’re temporarily ranked ninth. You can participate in the challenge of the General Assembly later!</p><p>King Feng Ming announced.</p><p>“Many thanks, country ruler!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists in thanks and then returned to the stands.</p><p>“This subordinate pays his respects to Lord Commander!”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming returned to the grandstand, Liao min bowed respectfully.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming had taken over Yi Yang’s position and became a commander, he was their immediate superior.</p><p>Liao min sighed secretly. Not long ago, Lu Ming was the same as them, just a guard. But now, he had become a commander and replaced Yi Yang’s position.</p><p>This was the world of cultivation. The strong were respected. As long as one had the strength, reputation and status were at their fingertips.</p><p>“Your subordinate greets Lord Commander!”</p><p>At the side, Bleu also hurriedly bowed, his head deeply lowered in respect.</p><p>Lu Ming cast an indifferent glance at Bleu. Bleu’s body trembled and he broke out in cold sweat.</p><p>“No need to be so polite, sit down!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand.</p><p>Then, he sat down.</p><p>The challenge continued.</p><p>It was still the commander of the border city who issued the challenge.</p><p>Originally, the border city’s commander was going to challenge Yi Yang, but now that Yi Yang was dead, the commander had become Lu Ming.</p><p>He had seen Lu Ming’s combat strength just now. He knew that he was no match for Lu Ming. Therefore, he skipped Lu Ming and challenged the eighth- ranked commander. Naturally, he was defeated.</p><p>Next, it was Lu Ming’s turn to challenge.</p><p>“I give up the challenge!”</p><p>Lu Ming said loudly.</p><p>Since he had already obtained the commander’s position, Lu Ming had no intention of continuing the challenge. Going too far was as bad as not going too far. He understood this principle.</p><p>He could already do a lot of things with this commander’s position.</p><p>Lu Ming’s decision to give up on the challenge delighted some of the commanders, especially those who were ranked before him.</p><p>The challenge continued.</p><p>The next challenge did not have much suspense.</p><p>A hundred years was too short for experts like them. Their strength would not change much.</p><p>Very quickly, it was rama’s turn to challenge.</p><p>“Will he challenge Lu Ming first?”</p><p>Many people thought so.</p><p>Lu Ming had just killed one of Rama’s powerful guards. Given Rama’s character, he would not let Lu Ming off so easily.</p><p>However, Rama took a few glances at Lu Ming and did not challenge him.</p><p>After all, Lu Ming’s strength still made Luo mo somewhat apprehensive. He was afraid that after challenging Lu Ming, he would then challenge commander Yu Zhan and not be at his peak.</p><p>Therefore, he did not challenge Lu Ming. Instead, he looked at Yu Zhan.</p><p>As expected, the guards that Rama sent out after him were all guards that challenged commander Yu Zhan.</p><p>The two sides were locked in battle.</p><p>However, commander Rama still lost a guard.</p><p>The other party still had a guard, but Rama no longer had a guard. He had to fight himself.</p><p>Luo mo leaped onto the battle platform and looked at commander Yu Zhan, ” “Yu Zhan, come down and fight!”</p><p>“Defeat my guard first!”</p><p>Yu Zhan said coldly. After which, his guard leaped onto the fighting stage.</p><p>The last guard under Yu Zhan’s command was also a heavenly Emperor expert, but he was only a one-star heavenly Emperor.</p><p>a first level void transformation martial artist wants to consume my energy? you must be dreaming. Get lost!</p><p>die! Luo mo shouted loudly and sent out a palm strike. The terrifying power of the palm strike was like an avalanche as it surged towards the other party.</p><p>Third level void transformation stage!</p><p>Commander Rama’s cultivation base was at the third level void transformation stage, which was equivalent to a three-star heavenly Emperor. He was much stronger than a one-star heavenly Emperor.</p><p>Although the other party had used all his means, he was still unable to change the outcome. He was blasted off the fighting ring by Rama’s palm force.</p><p>Yu Zhan, do it yourself. Don’t call these small fries over!</p><p>Luomo looked at commander Yu Zhan, radiating a powerful battle intent.</p><p>you haven’t fought for a hundred years. Let’s see where your confidence comes from!</p><p>Commander Yu Zhan spoke coldly. With a move of his body, he appeared on the battle platform, standing opposite to commander luomo.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Both of them burst out with powerful auras. Their auras collided and produced a violent boom.</p><p>Without a doubt, commander Yu Zhan was also a three star heavenly Emperor.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, the two of them moved. They turned into two rays of light and fiercely collided with each other, starting an intense battle.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The attacks of the two men kept clashing against each other, and the fighting ring was filled with endless rumbles. In the blink of an eye, the two had exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>Then, there was a violent explosion and the two of them retreated rapidly.</p><p>The only difference was that Yu Zhan had retreated over twenty steps, while Rama had only retreated a dozen steps.</p><p>“Rama, you… Your cultivation base…”</p><p>Commander Yu Zhan looked at commander Luo mo in shock, his eyes filled with disbelief.</p><p>“Hahaha, Yu Zhan, I’m only a step away from the fourth level of the void transformation stage now. Let’s see how you’re going to fight me!”</p><p>Luo mo laughed madly and was filled with confidence.</p><p>This time around, he was confident that he could defeat Yu Zhan, not only because of that royal member of the foreign race, but also because of his own strength.</p><p>In the past hundred years, his cultivation had finally made another breakthrough. He was only one step away from the fourth level void transformation stage and had already reached the limit of the third level void transformation stage. His combat strength had already surpassed Yu Zhan.</p><p>The other commanders were also extremely shocked.</p><p>This time, the ranking of the commanders was probably going to change.</p><p>“Yu Zhan, be defeated!”</p><p>Commander luomo continued to charge at commander Yu Zhan.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>Commander Yu Zhan roared in anger, and the two of them once again engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>However, although Luo mo was stronger, he wasn’t that much stronger. Under Yu Zhan’s desperate resistance, it wouldn’t be easy for Luo mo to obtain victory.</p><p>The two of them exchanged more than two hundred moves. In the end, commander Yu Zhan was no match for commander luomo and was defeated.</p><p>Commander Yu Zhan returned to the grandstand with an unsightly expression and circulated his martial arts to treat his injuries.</p><p>alright, this time’s commanders ‘meeting has ended. Next, I will announce the rankings of the commanders for the next hundred years!</p><p>Said King Feng Ming.</p><p>Everyone’s spirits were lifted. The new ranking was about to be released, and this would affect the distribution of benefits later.</p><p>“First place… Rama!”</p><p>King Feng Ming announced the first place.</p><p>“It’s really rama!”</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>Although Luo mo had lost a guard this time, he was still extremely powerful. He was invincible among the 13 commanders. It was normal for him to be ranked first after defeating commander Yu Zhan.</p><p>Commander Yu Zhan’s face turned gloomy, while commander luomo laughed out loud before thanking monarch Feng Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
