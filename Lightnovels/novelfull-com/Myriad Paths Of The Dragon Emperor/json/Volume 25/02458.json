Was the ancestral Dragon finally going to reveal</p><p>the purpose of gathering everyone?</p><p>They were also very curious.</p><p>“There are several aspects involved in this!” Zu long muttered.</p><p>the first is the existence that surpasses the heavenly Emperor realm. Many people call my realm the Supreme realm or the ancestral Emperor. In fact, this realm is called the martial God Realm, the realm above the Martial Emperor!</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>“The war god!”</p><p>Many people were shocked and their eyes lit up.</p><p>It turned out that the martial God Realm was above the martial Supreme realm.</p><p>God, God, so there really were gods in the world.</p><p>Qing Cang and the other peak heavenly emperors were especially excited.</p><p>They were already at the peak of the heavenly Emperor realm. Their next step would be to break through to the martial God Realm and transcend beyond the heavenly Dao, not bound by the heavenly Dao.</p><p>Everyone’s imagination ran wild, and zu long started to explain, ” in the ancient times, there were four martial gods in the heaven realm and the evil god Realm. I, the owner of the prison-suppressing stele, am the ancestor of the prison-suppressing field. I am the prison-suppressing ancestor!</p><p>there’s also a Saint ancestor of the non-human race. The last one is called Saint ancestor bloodheart!</p><p>the four martial gods were divided into two camps. Prison-guarding patriarch and I were good friends, while the killing heart Saint ancestor and the non- human Saint ancestor were on the same side. They wanted to invade the heaven realm and destroy the human race and the divine beasts. That was the start of the ancient war!</p><p>“Each side has two war gods!” Everyone’s heart stirred, and they perked up to listen. They knew that they were about to find out some ancient secrets.</p><p>it was a brutal battle. The four of us fought in the dark void for a hundred years. In the end, prison-guarding patriarch and Saint ancestor bloodheart both died!</p><p>Zu long continued. Some of the people from the prison suppression field looked sad.</p><p>the divine ancestor and I were both severely injured. Even now, we haven’t recovered from our injuries. We’ve been recuperating all these years. The outsiders are afraid of me, so they didn’t dare to attack with full force!</p><p>Zu long continued.</p><p>Everyone came to a sudden realization. Although the outsiders were powerful as a whole, the martial God didn’t have the upper hand and didn’t dare to fight them head-on. This was normal.</p><p>“Senior ancestral Dragon didn’t say why the alien races attacked the heaven</p><p>realm!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming thought of a problem.</p><p>This question had been on his mind for a long time, but since zu long didn’t say anything, he didn’t ask.</p><p>however, the situation has changed. Saint ancestor bloodheart isn’t dead!</p><p>The ancestral Dragon continued.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Other than Lu Ming and a few others, the rest were shocked and their faces</p><p>were filled with shock.</p><p>The sacred ancestor bloodheart was still alive?</p><p>Didn’t that mean that there were two martial gods in the evil god Realm? On their side, there was only one martial God. How were they going to fight?</p><p>If that was the case, the heaven realm was no match for the alien races.</p><p>The overall strength of the alien races was stronger than that of the heaven realm. With the addition of the two martial gods, the heaven realm was going to be destroyed.</p><p>Some people’s eyes were filled with despair, however, although Saint ancestor bloodheart didn’t die, he was severely injured in the battle with the prison-guarding patriarch, and only a trace of his bloodline is left. This is related to the next thing I’m going to talk about, which is netherworld mountain!</p><p>Zu long continued.</p><p>“Netherworld mountain?”</p><p>Many people were stunned.</p><p>yes, yellow spring Mountain. I believe many people have seen or heard of it. Outside the two world city, the space cracked open and the yellow spring River appeared. At the end of the river, there is a mountain. That is yellow spring Mountain!</p><p>netherworld mountain, an extremely hidden place. Even I have never entered</p><p>it!</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>Everyone was shocked. As a martial God expert, the ancestral Dragon had transcended the heavenly path and was truly invincible in the world. In everyone’s hearts, he should be an omniscient figure. However, even the ancestral Dragon had never been there. What kind of place was that?</p><p>I’ve also read a few records from some extremely ancient books. Legend has it that netherworld mountain doesn’t belong to the heaven realm, the primordial realm, or the evil god Realm. Instead, it comes from beyond the heavens!</p><p>Zulong said.</p><p>“Beyond the heavens?”</p><p>Many people were dumbfounded.</p><p>Beyond the heavens? What did that mean?</p><p>Could there be other worlds apart from the primordial realm, heaven realm, and evil god Realm?</p><p>“Beyond the heavens?”</p><p>Dandan whispered, frowning, as if she knew something.</p><p>“Beyond the heavens?”</p><p>Paoba muttered, her eyes filled with doubt.</p><p>“Bubble, what do you know?”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to bubbles.</p><p>I don’t know. Some images will appear in my mind, but I can’t see them clearly!</p><p>Pao Pao said.</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled and did not understand.</p><p>Dandan glanced at bubbles and did not say anything.</p><p>“Senior, what is beyond the heavens?”</p><p>Someone could not help but ask.</p><p>“Beyond the heavens?”</p><p>The ancestral Dragon looked up at the sky and a look of reminiscence seemed to flash in his eyes. After a while, he said, ” that’s a vast place. We’ll talk about this later. Let’s talk about netherworld mountain first!</p><p>it’s said that netherworld mountain comes from beyond the sky. It’s extremely ancient and mysterious. Usually, it’s covered by a layer of restriction. Even I can’t enter it!</p><p>however, it doesn’t mean that you can’t enter forever. It’s said that after every ten thousand tribulations, the restriction of netherworld mountain will be opened once. At that time, you can enter!</p><p>Everyone was even more shocked. Even the ancestral Dragon couldn’t enter, so who else could?</p><p>Also, the myriad tribulation will be activated once.</p><p>Myriad tribulations, how long were those?</p><p>Each tribulation was 333333 years long, so wouldn’t ten thousand tribulations be more than three billion years?</p><p>Everyone looked at each other.</p><p>according to the ancient records, netherworld mountain is like a world of its own and contains countless treasures. Heaven Dao soldier-grade treasures can be found anywhere, and there are even some treasures that possess heavendefying effects. No matter how heavy one’s injuries are, they can be healed very quickly!</p><p>“This time, netherworld mountain is about to open. That’s why there are so many strange phenomena!” the non-human divine ancestor has been waiting for this opportunity. He wants to take the sacred ancestor bloodheart into netherworld mountain and obtain an opportunity. Not only will his own injuries be healed, but the sacred ancestor bloodheart’s injuries will also be healed. In that case, we’ll be even more unable to resist!</p><p>that’s why I’ve gathered all of you here this time to bring you into netherworld mountain. Firstly, you can stop the foreign tribe. Secondly, you can also obtain opportunities. If you can obtain great opportunities inside, I’m afraid your cultivation will advance by leaps and bounds!</p><p>Zu long explained.</p><p>Everyone came to a realization. So this was the reason why zu long had gathered them.</p><p>He would stop the alien race and then obtain the opportunity to improve his cultivation.</p><p>most of you are people with great luck. After you enter, you will have a higher chance of obtaining an opportunity. However, I have to remind you that netherworld mountain is very dangerous. This time, many outsiders will enter with you. That is for sure!</p><p>moreover, netherworld mountain is vast and boundless. According to ancient records, the area inside is unimaginably vast. I’m afraid it’s no smaller than the total area of the nine heaven domains in the heaven realm!</p><p>moreover, there are countless living beings in there, including humans and other races. They have established their own countries, and they are extremely prosperous and powerful. There are even martial God Realm experts in there! Zu Long’s face was solemn as he warned.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
