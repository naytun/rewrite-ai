Come, come, come and greet this old man!”</p><p>Dandan shouted at the Titan Longhorn and the nine lives devilish silkworm.</p><p>The Titan longhorn beetle and the nine lives devilish silkworm glanced at dandan and then stepped forward.</p><p>“Greetings to the two seniors!”</p><p>Feng Ling, Long Chen, and even the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor hurriedly bowed.</p><p>They knew that these two were two of the top ten warbeasts, so they naturally didn’t dare to slight them.</p><p>Each of the top ten Battle Beasts was a terrifying existence, standing at the peak of the heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p>In ancient times, other than a few unparalleled experts such as the primal Chaos Emperor and the undying Emperor, no one was a match for the top ten war beasts.</p><p>Of course, this was with the exception of people like zu long, who had already surpassed heavenly Emperor.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>The Titan longhorn beetle and the nine lives devilish silkworm nodded, indicating that there was no need to be so polite.</p><p>“Old bull, aren’t you guarding a void passage in the primordial realm? Why are you here?”</p><p>Dandan asked casually.</p><p>senior ancestral Dragon sent someone to ask me to come. There are already people sent by senior ancestral Dragon to guard that place!</p><p>The Titan longhorn beetle replied. Then, it glared and said, old turtle, you know a lot of secrets. Do you know why the ancestral Dragon gathered us here? ”</p><p>“It should be related to netherworld mountain, right?”</p><p>Dandan rolled her eyes and said.</p><p>“Netherworld mountain? Could it be the faintly discernible mountain on the yellow spring River?”</p><p>The Titan longhorn beetle, nine lives devilish silkworm, and the others were all puzzled.</p><p>“It should be, but I’m not too sure about the details!”</p><p>Dandan frowned.</p><p>“Haha, what a coincidence today!”</p><p>At this moment, a loud laugh was heard. Following that, a golden light flashed and a burly man with messy hair appeared in the sky.</p><p>“Big brother Qing Cang!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile.</p><p>It was the nine-headed Golden Lion, Qing Cang.</p><p>“Old lion, so you didn’t die!”</p><p>When it saw Qing Cang and the Titan longhorn beetle, it glared at them.</p><p>“Nonsense, if you, an old bull, are not dead, how can I die?”</p><p>Qing Cang also glared at dandan and said, also, if this outrageous old turtle didn’t die, how could I die?!</p><p>“Hey, hey, what did you say? Be careful with your words!”</p><p>Dandan was furious, her eyes wide open.</p><p>“Dandan, what kind of outrageous things have you done in the past?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>“Pfft, what do you mean by that? They’re framing me…”</p><p>Dandan’s eyes were even bigger than the Titan Longhorn.</p><p>“Framed? who used to Rob people’s ancestral graves every day? One time, I even stole it from the undying venerable Emperor and was taught a lesson by him. I almost became a roasted turtle…”</p><p>Qing Cang said disdainfully.</p><p>Lu Ming was suddenly enlightened. He finally understood why dandan could not obtain the indestructible ancient scroll when it was first born.</p><p>It turned out that this guy had robbed the ancestral grave of the immortal venerable Emperor in the past. It was already kind of him not to kill him.</p><p>This guy was indeed unreliable.</p><p>“Wait, what’s this guy’s name? Dandan? Hahahaha!”</p><p>The Titan longhorn beetle said. After it finished speaking, it began to laugh wildly.</p><p>“Dandan? Eggy? Hahaha!”</p><p>Qing Cang also laughed. Even the nine lives devilish silkworm couldn’t help but laugh.</p><p>As for Huang Ling, Long Chen, and the others, they wanted to laugh but didn’t dare to. Their faces were red from holding back their laughter.</p><p>“You guys… You guys …”</p><p>Dandan was so angry that she was stomping her feet.</p><p>Many people in the surroundings looked over. Some of them recognized Qing Cang, the Titan bull, and the others, and were shocked.</p><p>These were all the top ten Battle Beasts, the ancient era’s giant crocodiles. Now, many of them were gathered together.</p><p>The nine-headed Golden Lion, the Titan longhorn beetle, the nine lives devilish silkworm, the world God turtle, and the space-time spirit rat. There were five of them. It had been many years since they had last seen them.</p><p>“This is… Space-time spirit mouse? So, back then…”</p><p>After laughing for a while, Qing Cang looked at bubbles and sighed.</p><p>The Titan Longhorn and nine lives devilish silkworm stopped laughing. Their expressions were somewhat dejected.</p><p>“During that battle, I was captured by the alien races long ago. I wonder how the others are doing?”</p><p>Qing Cang asked.</p><p>“The battle back then was too tragic. Nine-lives and I were seriously injured and haven’t recovered for many years. The old turtle’s injuries were even worse. You were captured, and only the five elements Qilin’s injuries were better. He’s been by the Dragon ancestor’s side all these years. As for the others, almost all of them died!”</p><p>The Titan longhorn beetle sighed.</p><p>the nine Dragons died in the primordial realm. The sacred Spirit ant, the undying celestial Phoenix, and the Archean dragonesque elephant all died. Spacetime was even more miserable. Even their corpses were used by the alien races!</p><p>The nine lives devilish silkworm sighed.</p><p>Even dandan’s eyes were a little dejected.</p><p>In ancient times, the top ten warbeasts were extremely glorious. Back then, there were some conflicts and grudges between them. However, after the ancient war, those grudges had long disappeared.</p><p>Now, there were only a few of them left.</p><p>At the side, Lu Ming also sighed secretly. The more he knew, the more he could imagine the tragic battle that year.</p><p>Too many experts had died in battle.</p><p>Even a sect as powerful as the Hunyuan sect was almost completely destroyed.</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming had learned from Earth One, Thunder one and the rest.</p><p>Hunyuan sect, in ancient times, had once ruled the Hunyuan heavenly region and was extremely powerful.</p><p>Hunyuan sect had nine halls.</p><p>For example, the primal Chaos Hall was one of the nine halls of the Hunyuan sect. There was also the time space spirit Hall, and the previous generation’s time space spirit rat was the hall Master.</p><p>The nine Hall Masters were almost all peak heavenly emperors. However, the primal Chaos Emperor was the leader of the nine halls.</p><p>Hunyuan sect’s Grandmaster was a terrifying figure, not weaker than the primal Chaos Emperor.</p><p>Such a powerful force was also annihilated in the battle that year.</p><p>The nine Hall Masters and Hunyuan sect master had all died in battle.</p><p>Only the primal Chaos Hall had left behind some puppets.</p><p>As for the Hunyuan sect headquarters, there were no experts left behind, only the array spirit inside.</p><p>The array spirit was the one who had arranged for Lu Ming and the others to take the Hunyuan sect assessment.</p><p>He had already understood these matters from Earth One and the others.</p><p>As the crowd chatted, thousands of people had gathered in the square.</p><p>Suddenly, a light flashed from the mountain, and a few figures flew out.</p><p>The one leading them was zu long.</p><p>There were a few people following behind the ancestral Dragon, and some of them were the five elements Qilin.</p><p>The other one had an unfathomable aura. Clearly, he was also an extremely terrifying expert.</p><p>The ancestral Dragon flew out and stood in the air. A Supreme aura emanated from his body that even the heavenly Dao was suppressed.</p><p>Although most of them had never seen the ancestral Dragon before, they all knew that it was the ancestral Dragon when they sensed the aura.</p><p>“Greetings, senior ancestral Dragon!”</p><p>The thousands of people all saluted respectfully.</p><p>“Rise!”</p><p>The ancestral Dragon waved his hand, and everyone felt a force lifting them up. Even a peak heavenly Emperor couldn’t resist.</p><p>“I’m sure you’re all very curious as to why I’ve suddenly gathered you here, right?”</p><p>Zulong said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
