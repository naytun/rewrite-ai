Senior, please!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>The old man spoke and suddenly rushed toward Lu Ming. His palm was like a knife as he struck out.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The old man’s palm trembled, and a strange power circulated. It was really like a battle blade.</p><p>The old man also cultivated the ancient martial arts, and his attack power was astonishing.</p><p>Since he had made his move, he would not hold back, because duo Lei would not allow anyone to hold back.</p><p>Lu Ming took a deep breath and threw a punch.</p><p>This punch was very ordinary, but when it was thrown out, the space on the fighting stage exploded and the wind howled. The power was extremely shocking.</p><p>However, there was a light screen around the fighting ring that blocked the reckless Qi.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>The old man’s eyes widened. The power of Lu Ming’s punch was so shocking that he was shocked.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The old man’s moves changed. With a shake of his arm, he suddenly slashed dozens of times.</p><p>Dozens of saber beams were shot out, aiming at Lu Ming’s fist.</p><p>However, as Lu Ming’s fist passed by, the elder’s Saber Light exploded inch by inch. The terrifying fist force crushed over and collided with the elder’s palm.</p><p>The old man’s body trembled as if he had been electrocuted. Then, he backed off madly until he was out of the fighting ring and hit the light screen at the edge of the fighting ring. His face turned pale.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>At the scene, many people were shocked and could not help but re-examine Lu Ming.</p><p>Previously, they thought that even if Lu Ming was a genius, he would not be too powerful. It was already very shocking that he had the fighting power of a great emperor.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s attack shocked them.</p><p>He had defeated a peak great emperor with one punch.</p><p>“This little brother Lu Ming is not bad. He looks really young. He has cultivated for less than a thousand years at most, but he has such combat strength. It’s really amazing!”</p><p>Mrs. Wu sighed.</p><p>Qing Gang’s eyes were also filled with surprise, he’s probably a body cultivator. He’s already reached the peak of the Dao Emperor realm and is a rare prodigy. What a pity that he’s been locked up in the eternal cage!</p><p>Qing Cang sighed.</p><p>Mrs. Wu was the same.</p><p>With such strength at such a young age, if he had enough time, he would definitely become a terrifying master. Unfortunately, he had been captured by the alien race and brought here, which was equivalent to losing hope.</p><p>“Little brother’s battle strength is amazing, this old man is no match for you. I’m impressed, I’m impressed!”</p><p>On the fighting ring, the old man cupped his fists and said, his eyes full of admiration.</p><p>“Senior is too polite!”</p><p>Lu Ming said politely.</p><p>“Duo Lei, I’m really no match for you. You can go down now!”</p><p>The old man looked at duo Lei.</p><p>“Trash, get lost!”</p><p>Duo Lei waved his hand, and the old man walked down the fighting ring.</p><p>you are indeed powerful. Ao Jing, you go!</p><p>Duo Lei said to a middle-aged man in silver chain armor.</p><p>“Me?”</p><p>The man was stunned.</p><p>He was at the heavenly Emperor realm, and duo Lei was asking him to fight with a great emperor?</p><p>“Duo Lei, you’re going too far. Lu Ming is only a great emperor. It’s meaningless for you to ask him to fight ao Jing!”</p><p>Qing Cang cried out.</p><p>” When has it ever been your turn to interrupt me? Qingcang, remember who you are now. You’re just a prisoner, so don’t think of yourself as one of the top ten warbeasts!”</p><p>Duo Lei coldly glanced at Qing Cang, then turned to ao Jing and said, ” “Let’s go up and fight, and we’ll use our full strength!”</p><p>Ao Jing had no choice but to step onto the fighting stage. Duo Lei waved his hand and ao Jing’s armor flew away.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar was heard, and ao Jing emitted a powerful aura.</p><p>Ao Jing was a true dragon, and he was a one-star heavenly Emperor.</p><p>“Little brother, be careful!”</p><p>Ao Jing reminded.</p><p>“Senior, just use your full strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming said, a strong fighting spirit in his eyes.</p><p>This was the first time he was going to fight a heavenly Emperor.</p><p>A heavenly Emperor was much stronger than a great emperor. No great emperor had ever been able to fight a heavenly Emperor.</p><p>Even the first Prince of the non-human race, who was known as the strongest heaven’s favorite of the non-human race, wouldn’t be a match for the weakest one-star heavenly Emperor.</p><p>Lu Ming was looking forward to how far he could go against a one-star heavenly Emperor if he were to go all out.</p><p>Moreover, although he had mastered 81 types of nomological laws, his use of them was not perfect.</p><p>At the very least, he was unable to interweave all the laws together to form a sacred art.</p><p>It couldn’t be as smooth as one.</p><p>All of this was very difficult to comprehend on one’s own, but in an intense battle, one would often reap great benefits.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming was looking forward to it and his fighting spirit was very strong.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>Lu Ming’s body glowed. It was the light of the law.</p><p>“That is …The laws!”</p><p>Below the fighting ring, Qing Cang was shocked.</p><p>He did not expect that Lu Ming had actually cultivated laws.</p><p>“Wait, so many… No, no, several ultimate maxims. What’s going on? My God, it’s still increasing…”</p><p>Qing Gang’s eyes immediately widened.</p><p>This was because the laws on Lu Ming’s body were constantly flashing.</p><p>A dozen, twenty, fifty…</p><p>And the number of ultimate maxims kept increasing.</p><p>Qing Gang’s eyes grew wider and wider, and in the end, he became completely dumbfounded.</p><p>Qing Cang did not cultivate the system of laws, but the primordial demonic</p><p>Dao.</p><p>However, in the ancient era, the system of laws dominated the heaven realm and was extremely prosperous. He naturally understood it very well.</p><p>At that moment, he was dumbfounded when he saw the law on Lu Ming.</p><p>He was not the only one. Everyone around the battle stage who had some understanding of the nomological system was also dumbfounded.</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming’s 81 types of laws emerged and formed a battle suit that covered his entire body.</p><p>Lu Ming unleashed his abilities to the maximum.</p><p>“Senior, please!”</p><p>Lu Ming extended his hand and reminded ao Jing.</p><p>“Little brother, you’re amazing!”</p><p>Ao Jing’s eyes were filled with shock, and his aura was raised to the maximum.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them moved at the same time, pouncing towards each other and launching a terrifying attack. With a violent boom, the two of them clashed head-on, and then both of them retreated.</p><p>The difference was that ao Jing only took three steps back, while Lu Ming took 15 steps back.</p><p>“What shocking strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>What ao Jing cultivated was not the system of laws, but the primordial demonic Dao.</p><p>The primordial demonic Dao cultivated the body and demonic power.</p><p>The combination of the demonic body and demonic power was extremely powerful.</p><p>In the previous exchange of blows, ao Jing’s strength was completely above Lu Ming’s.</p><p>He didn’t know that the others were even more shocked.</p><p>he blocked it. A great emperor is actually fighting against the celestial Emperor. Unbelievable!</p><p>ao Jing didn’t show any mercy. It is indeed incredible! He is a peerless monster!</p><p>“Unfortunately, he’s been locked up in the eternal cage!”</p><p>Many people sighed and felt sorry for Lu Ming.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. At this moment, his fighting spirit was getting stronger.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Then, he rushed toward ao Jing and increased his power to the maximum.</p><p>Ao Jing was not to be outdone. He charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The two of them engaged in an intense battle, and the battle turned white hot.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
