Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>They turned into streams of light and rushed out, killing their way to the camp.</p><p>Instantly, attacks rained down mercilessly, killing a large number of alien races.</p><p>“Enemy attack!”</p><p>The roars spread throughout the camp.</p><p>One figure after another flew out of the military camp.</p><p>This was an Army of 10000 soldiers, and even the weakest one was at the void Emperor realm.</p><p>The most powerful general was also a powerhouse of the heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p>There were two celestial emperors in this Army.</p><p>“Kill them!”</p><p>As soon as the two Heavenly Kings appeared, the human commanders of the prison suppression field targeted them and attacked each other.</p><p>“Not good, retreat!”</p><p>The alien heavenly Emperor realized that there were six heavenly emperors among the people from the prison realm. He knew he couldn’t defeat them, so he gave the order to retreat.</p><p>One by one, the outsiders rose into the air and retreated. At the same time, a brilliant light shot into the sky and disappeared into the depths of the heavens.</p><p>This was a signal for the other alien races to come and help.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The humans of the prison suppression field started a massacre.</p><p>They were all elites. There were six heavenly monarchs in total, and the rest were great emperors. They could be said to be the elites of the elites.</p><p>The alien races were killed one after another. In just a short while, they had chased for a hundred thousand miles and killed thousands of alien races.</p><p>However, they didn’t dare to pursue further. They would be in danger if other foreign tribe powerful beings came to their rescue.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>retreat! the commander of the prison suppression field ordered. More than too people quickly retreated.</p><p>However, they didn’t retreat far before their expressions changed.</p><p>Because behind him, a dense crowd of figures had appeared, all of them from foreign races.</p><p>There were at least tens of thousands of alien races, and some of the leaders had terrifying auras.</p><p>There were a total of ten heavenly emperors.</p><p>Ten non-human heavenly emperors appeared behind them. The human race from the prison suppression field looked terrible.</p><p>not good, we’ve been ambushed. Charge forward!</p><p>The commander of the prison suppression field shouted.</p><p>However, as soon as he finished speaking, the foreign kinds who had just escaped returned. And there were even more of them.</p><p>Furthermore, the number of heavenly emperors in the lead increased from two to six.</p><p>Furthermore, one of them had an extremely terrifying aura that far surpassed the other celestial emperors.</p><p>He was a peerless expert of the alien race, a four-star heavenly Emperor.</p><p>hehe, you want to ambush us. Don’t think that we don’t know. We’re just waiting for you to fall into our trap!</p><p>A non-human heavenly Emperor sneered.</p><p>The people from the prison suppression field were in despair.</p><p>Obviously, the alien races had set up a trap and were waiting for them. Once they made a move, they would be surrounded.</p><p>There were six foreign heavenly emperors in front of him, and one of them was a four-star heavenly Emperor.</p><p>Behind them, there were ten foreign heavenly emperors.</p><p>On the other hand, there were only six heavenly emperors. The difference in strength was too great. They were no match for them at all. It was likely that none of them would be able to escape today.</p><p>“Kill them, let’s fight it out with them!”</p><p>“Right, let’s fight it out with them. Killing one is enough, killing two is enough!”</p><p>The eyes of the humans from the prison suppression field were red with determination.</p><p>Since he couldn’t escape today, he would fight to the death.</p><p>Even if he died, he would make the other party lose a piece of flesh.</p><p>“Doit!”</p><p>kill! the alien expert ordered.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The humans from the prison realm also roared and charged at the alien races.</p><p>The two sides collided with each other.</p><p>Instantly, screams rose and fell, from both the alien race and the human race.</p><p>However, although the human race of the prison guard world were all elites, there were too many alien races, and there were more Masters than them. Once they fought, they were completely at a disadvantage, and people were being killed.</p><p>“Kill, kill!”</p><p>A peak great emperor wielding a battle blade slashed out and killed a non- human great emperor. However, he was immediately sliced in half by a heavenly Emperor’s axe and died.</p><p>Tragic, extremely tragic!</p><p>Not long after, more than half of the more than too humans from the prison suppression field were killed.</p><p>If this continued, it was only a matter of time before they were completely annihilated.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At this moment, a violent boom came from the sky in the distance.</p><p>The void was constantly exploding, and the rumbles were getting stronger and stronger as they approached rapidly.</p><p>Even the people on both sides stopped fighting and looked in that direction.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The void exploded, and more than a hundred people suddenly appeared in the void not far away.</p><p>“This… So many experts!”</p><p>Sensing the auras of these too-odd people, the foreign kinds were almost scared to death.</p><p>The aura was too terrifying. With more than a hundred auras gathered together, some of the weaker alien races were immediately pressed down.</p><p>“Big brother Wu, it’s big brother Wu!”</p><p>The commander of the prison suppression field shouted in excitement.</p><p>Of course, the more than one hundred people were Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>When they got close to the prison suppression world, they saw a battle in the distance. It must be a battle between the prison suppression world and the alien race, so they came immediately.</p><p>“Wu Lu, it’s you guys!”</p><p>Wu tai looked at the commander and then scanned the scene. When he saw the human bodies from the prison suppression field, his eyes turned red.</p><p>“Alien scum, die! All of you must die!”</p><p>Wu tai roared.</p><p>“Kill them all!”</p><p>The others also shouted and suddenly started to attack the alien race.</p><p>Over a hundred heavenly monarchs and thirty great sovereigns were too powerful. The non-humans were no match for them.</p><p>In an instant, thousands of alien races were killed.</p><p>“Go, quickly go!”</p><p>The rest of the foreign kinds screamed in fear. They didn’t dare to resist and fled in all directions.</p><p>There were more than a hundred heavenly emperors. How could they fight against them?</p><p>“Don’t even think about leaving, kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Large groups of alien races were killed, and their corpses fell to the ground.</p><p>Even the heavenly emperors of the foreign races were instantly blown up.</p><p>Among Lu Ming’s group, there were many four-star heavenly emperors and above.</p><p>“Kill! Haha! Kill!”</p><p>The remaining 50 people from the prison suppression field all shouted in joy.</p><p>At first, they thought they were dead for sure this time. They didn’t expect a group of experts to suddenly appear on the way. Moreover, the number of experts was terrifying. They completely crushed the foreign races.</p><p>They launched a counterattack.</p><p>“Run, run!”</p><p>The non-human heavenly emperors were terrified and wanted to run away.</p><p>However, how could they possibly escape when they were surrounded by so many celestial emperors?</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Wu tai held off the four-star heavenly Emperor of the alien race and charged forward.</p><p>“Six-star heavenly Emperor!”</p><p>The other party was in despair, not understanding why so many experts had suddenly appeared.</p><p>He fought back with all his might, but the gap between a four star heavenly Emperor and a six star heavenly Emperor was too big.</p><p>In one move, he was severely injured by Wu tai, and in the second move, he was killed.</p><p>Qing Cang didn’t make a move, because there was no need to.</p><p>Lu Ming did not make a move.</p><p>Previously, he had used up a lot of energy to open the light curtain of restrictions, especially after being discovered by duo Lei, who had controlled the light curtain of restrictions.</p><p>On top of that, he had been removing armors for the others along the way. Now, he needed to recover.</p><p>Lu Ming took out a large number of Supreme-grade raw gemstones and devoured the raw gemstones ‘original energy to recover.</p><p>This was a one-sided battle without any suspense. A large number of alien races were harvested and killed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
