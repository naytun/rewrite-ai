BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The fiery-red fruit exploded in Lu Ming’s body like a volcano, turning into waves that surged into his limbs and bones.</p><p>It was as if Lu Ming’s physical body was wrapped in endless lava and was about to melt. Waves of pain spread throughout his body.</p><p>The energy contained in the fiery-red fruit was truly shocking. Even with Lu Ming’s current physical body, he could not withstand it and was about to be torn apart.</p><p>“The indestructible ancient scroll, the power of a sovereign!”</p><p>Lu Ming growled as he circulated the indestructible ancient scroll to heal his injuries. At the same time, he circulated his ruler’s Dao.</p><p>The path of domination was to dominate everything. Lu Ming tried to dominate the energy and control it from there.</p><p>It was indeed useful!</p><p>Under the path of a ruler, the energy became much more docile.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming circulated the ” mysterious Seven Gods technique “, His muscles, bones, and bones vibrated at ten billion times per second to refine the energy.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Streams of energy were like the water of a River, flowing into Lu Ming’s body. With every vibration, endless energy was used up and refined. It seeped into Lu Ming’s muscles, bones, and bones, strengthening his body.</p><p>Lu Ming’s physical body was improving rapidly.</p><p>It was a true speed, much faster than when he cultivated in the Dragon essence pool in the lair of Zulong.</p><p>The energy of the lair of Zulong was relatively mild. However, the energy of this fruit was extremely violent.</p><p>Fortunately, it was Lu Ming. If someone else had swallowed the entire fruit, they would have exploded and died.</p><p>However, the berserk state brought about a rapid improvement in his physical body.</p><p>“Refine, refine, refine!”</p><p>Lu Ming put all his effort into refining it. Very soon, a month had passed. BOOM!</p><p>Before the energy from the fruit was completely refined, Lu Ming’s body shook like thunder.</p><p>He had broken through!</p><p>His physical body had broken through to the middle of the sixth stage of the ” Seven Gods mysterious skill</p><p>Now, Lu Ming’s physical strength alone was enough to suppress a four-star heavenly Emperor. His combat strength had increased greatly.</p><p>There was still some residual energy in his body. Lu Ming continued to operate the seven Gods mysterious technique to refine all the remaining energy.</p><p>The remaining energy was naturally not enough for Lu Ming’s physical body to continue breaking through, but it could be consolidated.</p><p>A few days later, Lu Ming refined all the energy and ended his cultivation.</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile on his face.</p><p>Lu Ming had already gained a lot from this trip to the cursed land.</p><p>What could be better than a deeper mastery of the Dao of domination, a breakthrough in the physical body, and a great increase in strength?</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and walked back.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming was near the sword formation. There were only a few people on the other side of the sword formation.</p><p>“Lu Ming has come out!”</p><p>The few of them smiled when they saw Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming strode forward and charged into the sword array.</p><p>When Lu Ming charged into the sword array, the array lit up again and tiny sword Qi appeared, rushing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>This tune, Lu Ming did not even use the way of the ruler. He relied on his physical body and the indestructible ancient scroll to block the sword Qi attack. Lu Ming dashed out for a hundred meters before he began to cast The Way of the Master. He controlled the sword Qi and rushed out of the sword formation.</p><p>“Everyone, where are the six saints?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“They’re waiting for you outside!”</p><p>One of them said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and followed the few of them.</p><p>On the way, Lu Ming learned that they did not have any other gains in this cursed land.</p><p>It was obvious that this cursed land had already been plundered before the myriad tribulation.</p><p>After passing through the passage, they arrived at the huge stone chamber and saw heavenly venerate six sages and the others.</p><p>After casually chatting for a while, the group walked out. After a while, they left the cursed land and from afar, they saw monarch Feng Ming waiting with a group of people.</p><p>“Hahaha, commander Lu, you’re finally out!”</p><p>From afar, King Feng Ming came over to welcome him with a face full of smiles.</p><p>“Your Majesty!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists.</p><p>“Commander Lu, how was your trip to the cursed Lands?”</p><p>King Feng Ming asked with a smile.</p><p>sigh, country ruler, to be honest, I’m returning empty-handed this time!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>“Return empty-handed?”</p><p>King Feng Ming’s expression changed slightly.</p><p>that’s right. I’m afraid that someone has already entered this cursed land before the myriad tribulation. If you don’t believe me, my Lord, Lu Ming can swear an oath!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>hahaha, what oath? of course I believe in the commander. Let’s go back and welcome you back. This Dao brother, please!</p><p>King Feng Ming laughed and extended his hand to invite six sacred heavenly venerate.</p><p>Heavenly venerate six sages had not been on guard!</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, King Feng Ming suddenly made his move. A combat sword appeared in his palm and he stabbed it towards six sages.</p><p>At such a close distance, heavenly venerate six sages was completely unprepared. He had never expected that King Feng Ming would suddenly attack him. It was already too late for him to Dodge.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The long sword had pierced through six sacred heavenly venerate’s heart.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>Heavenly venerate six sages roared and struck out with both palms.</p><p>King Feng Ming pulled out his sword and retreated.</p><p>Heavenly venerate sixth Saint fell to the ground and vomited blood. He had been severely injured.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were shocked by the suddenness of the situation. They moved quickly and surrounded the sixth Saint.</p><p>“Why are you doing this?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at country ruler Feng Ming coldly.</p><p>“To get rid of you, of course!”</p><p>The one who spoke was not country ruler Feng Ming, but someone else.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>In the surroundings, figures flashed and appeared one after another.</p><p>it’s the evil god tribe!</p><p>The other people in the heaven realm were in an uproar.</p><p>it’s indeed the evil god tribe!</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes.</p><p>When he saw the evil god race, he understood everything.</p><p>The evil god tribe must have arrived after they entered and King Feng Ming must have surrendered immediately. He must have pretended to be talking to Lu Ming and the others to launch a sneak attack.</p><p>This was because, to Emperor Feng Ming’s knowledge, the six sages were a threat. That was why he had launched a sneak attack and eliminated the six sages first. At the very least, he had to injure them severely. This way, Lu Ming and the others would be like turtles in a jar.</p><p>“Lu Ming, the divine ancestor has ordered us to kill you without mercy. You can go in peace!”</p><p>“Hahaha, we’ll be valued by the divine ancestor after killing you. Lu Ming, your death was worth it!”</p><p>The evil god tribe members laughed.</p><p>“You think you can kill me?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“Oh? Do you want others to save you? I’m telling you, don’t even think about it. Your useless subordinates are all here!”</p><p>One of them sneered and with a wave of his hand, a few heads fell to the ground.</p><p>“Liao min, Wu Fan…”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes reddened at the sight of the heads, and an icy cold killing intent emanated from him.</p><p>Liao min, Wu Fan…</p><p>They were all Lu Ming’s guards. They had followed Lu Ming from the beginning and did not betray him. However, they were killed by the other party.</p><p>He was furious!</p><p>“Today, all of you will die!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was extremely cold. Finally, he looked at King Feng Ming and said,”Your Fengming country will be destroyed!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
