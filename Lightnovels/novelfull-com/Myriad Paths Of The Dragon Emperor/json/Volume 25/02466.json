If there’s anything you need, feel free to tell me!</p><p>Yi Yang said with a smile.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“Congratulations, guard Lu!”</p><p>congratulations, brother Lu!</p><p>At the side, the other guards were all smiling as they congratulated Lu Ming. It was the complete opposite of the situation just now.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming had proven his ability and was highly regarded by Yi Yang. He was called the first guard by Yi Yang. Of course, they had to build a good relationship with Lu Ming.</p><p>As for Bleu, let him go to the side.</p><p>This world was always so realistic.</p><p>Bleu stood at the side, his expression extremely ugly.</p><p>After that, someone led Lu Ming to a place. After two rounds, they arrived in front of a mansion.</p><p>This mansion used to be mo you’s mansion and now it belonged to Lu Ming.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming entered the mansion, he was greeted by a group of people who bowed to him.</p><p>“This subordinate greets Lord guard!”</p><p>There were more than a hundred people who kowtowed to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Mm, you’re free!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>These people used to be mo you’s subordinates, and now they had become his subordinates.</p><p>“Sir guard, what are your orders?”</p><p>Some people looked at Lu Ming with smiles and fawning looks.</p><p>“You guys go do what you need to do!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and dismissed the crowd. He found a room to stay in.</p><p>He sat cross-legged in his room and started to cultivate.</p><p>The mysterious energy between heaven and earth continued to gather toward Lu Ming.</p><p>After a long while, Lu Ming opened his eyes.</p><p>the effect of the path-understanding ancient tree is getting smaller and smaller in my cultivation!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>he realized that ever since he had comprehended the ruler Dao, the Dao Comprehension ancient tree had been of little use to him.</p><p>Lu Ming seemed to be able to merge with the world and even dominate the world. He could directly comprehend the way of the Dominator from the world. The effect of the path-understanding ancient tree had become minimal and was not of much help to Lu Ming.</p><p>The Dao Comprehension ancient tree was very useful for the comprehension of laws, great DAOs, and heavenly DAOs, but it was not very useful for the Dao of rulers.</p><p>After some thought, a storage ring appeared in Lu Ming’s hand.</p><p>This storage ring was mo you’s.</p><p>Lu Ming had killed mo you and naturally obtained his storage ring.</p><p>He extended his spiritual senses into it. The next moment, a few combat weapons appeared in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>” What a strange weapon!”</p><p>Lu Ming took the combat weapon and sized it up carefully.</p><p>The weapons in the yellow Springs world were also very different from those outside.</p><p>“It’s really amazing!”</p><p>Lu Ming injected the world Energy into the combat weapon and sensed it carefully. He was shocked.</p><p>He found that the combat weapons here were engraved with many arrays. These arrays interacted with each other and formed many wonderful functions. Once energy was injected into them, these arrays would be activated, causing the combat weapons to burst out with amazing power.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming realized that even if he injected the world Energy, he could still activate the array inside.</p><p>Lu Ming tried a few times and realized that these few combat weapons were equivalent to Thearch weapons. None of them were equivalent to celestial Thearch weapons.</p><p>Thinking about it, mo you was only a great emperor, how could he have a weapon equivalent to a Celestial Emperor weapon?</p><p>if I can get some combat weapons that are equivalent to Celestial Emperor weapons in the netherworld world and bring them out, the experts in the heaven realm can also use them. That will greatly enhance the strength of the heaven realm!</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Then, he kept the combat weapons and a glittering and translucent stone appeared in Lu Ming’s hand.</p><p>This stone was about the same size as a raw stone.</p><p>“Is this the netherworld world’s divine stone?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>Then, he activated his cultivation technique and absorbed the energy of the divine stone.</p><p>The energy in the divine stone was exactly the same as the energy drifting between heaven and earth in netherworld mountain, but it was many times richer.</p><p>The energy of a divine stone was absorbed by Lu Ming and was quickly refined by him, turning into his World Energy.</p><p>one divine stone actually contains so much energy. It’s equivalent to 10000 Supreme-grade raw stones!</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>The energy of this divine stone was too much. One piece was equivalent to 10000 Supreme-grade raw stones.</p><p>Lu Ming checked and found that there were five hundred thousand divine stones in mo you’s storage ring.</p><p>That was 50 billion Supreme grade raw stones.</p><p>50 billion Supreme-grade raw stones was already shocking enough.</p><p>Lu Ming had obtained a large number of Supreme-grade raw gemstones on the void Island. There were about six to seven hundred billion of them.</p><p>Now, there was only about 100 billion left.</p><p>The divine stones on mo you were equivalent to half of the raw stones on Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>haha, if I can get enough Godstones here, I won’t have to worry about my cultivation!</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>His cultivation had consumed too many resources.</p><p>Now, he only had over 10000 stones of chaos and 100 billion Supreme-grade raw stones left.</p><p>These resources were simply not enough.</p><p>However, once he had enough divine stones, he could do it.</p><p>A cultivation breakthrough did not necessarily require chaos stones or primordial chaos stones. A single Supreme-grade raw gemstone could do the same. However, the amount required was astonishing.</p><p>Therefore, in the past, Lu Ming had always cultivated with the raw gemstones and the chaos stones or the primordial chaos stones.</p><p>This would greatly reduce the consumption of raw gemstones.</p><p>However, with more than ten thousand chaos stones, Lu Ming would probably use up all of them if he were to break through again. However, as long as he had enough divine stones, he could break through.</p><p>Lu Ming began to think about how he could collect more divine stones. In that case, he would have enough resources for cultivation even after he left netherworld mountain.</p><p>After tidying up his things, Lu Ming continued to cultivate and comprehend The Way of the Master.</p><p>Time flew by and two months passed.</p><p>The past two months had been very peaceful. Nothing happened. Lu Ming cultivated in peace.</p><p>One day, Yi Yang sent someone to look for Lu Ming, saying that he had something to discuss with him.</p><p>It was still the same Hall where Lu Ming met Yi Yang.</p><p>There were two other people besides Yi Yang.</p><p>One of them was Bleu, who was defeated by Lu Ming. The other was a woman who looked to be in her thirties. She was very beautiful, graceful, and had a mature charm. She was full of strong temptation.</p><p>This was something that was not difficult to notice from Bleu’s eyes that were filled with the flames of desire when he glanced at her from time to time.</p><p>Lu Ming recognized the woman. She was one of Yi Yang’s guards. Her name was Liao min.</p><p>I ve come to find you today for the commander’s assembly!”</p><p>Yi Yang went straight to the point and said his purpose.</p><p>Bleu and Liao min’s expressions were calm. It was obvious that they had known about this long ago. However, Lu Ming was stunned and had some doubts.</p><p>Lu Ming, you don’t know yet, right? let me tell you!</p><p>Yi Yang looked at Lu Ming and said, ” there are a total of 13 commanders in Fengming country. Each of them is in charge of a region. However, the territory they are in charge of varies in size. The troops they command also vary in strength and strength. The ranking of the commanders is the deciding factor!</p><p>the country of Fengming holds a meeting of the commanders every hundred years to determine the ranking of the commanders. In another half a month, it will be the new meeting of the commanders!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
