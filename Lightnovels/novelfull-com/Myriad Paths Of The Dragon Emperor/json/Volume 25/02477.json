His true form was a divine beast, a giant ape with infinite strength and strong defense.</p><p>Moreover, he was a two star great emperor.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>He was cautious as he walked forward step by step. Finally, he stepped into the area of the great array.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The runes seemed to shake and light up. Countless thin threads stabbed at the man like tiny swords.</p><p>“Blockit!”</p><p>The burly man roared as World Energy filled his body. At the same time, he took out a few defensive Emperor weapons and charged forward.</p><p>However, the power of those tiny sword Qi was too strong. In the blink of an eye, at least tens of thousands of tiny sword Qi had hit him.</p><p>The Emperor-level weapons around him were covered in cracks in an instant before exploding and turning into dust.</p><p>Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!</p><p>As soon as the Emperor weapon was broken, countless tiny sword Qi hit the burly man. His body trembled violently, and he was stopped in his tracks.</p><p>One side of his body was covered in a layer of frost, while the other side was extremely red.</p><p>The burly man’s expression was extremely unsightly. His body trembled and he suddenly spat out a large mouthful of blood. His aura rapidly weakened.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Heavenly venerate six sages’s expression changed. He rushed over and pulled the burly man out.</p><p>Everyone saw that the burly man’s body was covered with tiny holes, from which cold and hot air flowed out.</p><p>The burly man quickly sat down cross-legged, swallowed a pill, and began to heal his injuries.</p><p>He had been severely injured just now. If not for the help of the six sages, he would have definitely died here.</p><p>The others looked solemn.</p><p>The power of this Grand array was also too powerful.</p><p>Even a two-star heavenly Emperor couldn’t resist it, so it would probably be the same for a three-star heavenly Emperor.</p><p>“I’ll try!”</p><p>A three-star heavenly Emperor was unwilling to give up and wanted to try.</p><p>Unfortunately, he couldn’t do it either. His defense was quickly broken by the tiny sword Qi, and he spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>He was in a slightly better state than the burly man from before. He had taken the initiative to retreat, but he had also suffered considerable injuries.</p><p>Even a three-star heavenly Emperor couldn’t do it, so everyone turned to look at the six sages.</p><p>His cultivation was the highest among the people present, so they could only rely on him now.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>Heavenly venerate six sages strode forward and stepped into the array.</p><p>As soon as he stepped into the formation, a Pagoda appeared in his hand and enveloped him within it. Then, he took a big step forward, wanting to rush over. That Pagoda was a heaven Dao soldier!</p><p>However, the runes in the surroundings shone even brighter as boundless sword Qi rushed towards six sages.</p><p>In particular, the sword Qi in front of him increased by several times, forming a wall of sword Qi in front of him.</p><p>Ding! Ding! Ding!</p><p>The sword Qi attacked the heaven Dao soldier in a frenzy, causing it to shake violently.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Celestial venerable six saints unleashed his full power and a powerful aura emanated from him. Controlling the heaven Dao soldier, he strode forward with all his might.</p><p>However, every step was extremely difficult.</p><p>After a few minutes, heavenly venerate six sages had only advanced less than ten meters.</p><p>One had to know that this section with the formation was a few hundred meters long.</p><p>The sounds of the collision grew more and more intense, and the heaven Dao soldiers also began to shake more and more violently.</p><p>Sparks flew in all directions, and an ear-piercing sound came from the heaven Dao soldier.</p><p>Heavenly venerate six sages’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>Even the heaven Dao soldiers were damaged and couldn’t block it.</p><p>Heavenly venerate six saints hurriedly retreated, not daring to advance.</p><p>Retreating was much easier than advancing. Not long after, heavenly venerate six sages had already retreated out of the array.</p><p>He hurriedly checked the heaven Dao soldier and found that there were a few small holes on it.</p><p>Heaven Dao soldiers were too hard to come by. Now that they were damaged, it would be extremely troublesome to repair them.</p><p>“It seems that we can’t go over!”</p><p>it’s difficult to pass this formation without the cultivation of a six-star heavenly Emperor or above!</p><p>The others sighed.</p><p>However, at this moment, a figure stepped out.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>The others were shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming actually wanted to give it a try. If even heavenly venerate six sages could not do it, how could Lu Ming?</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s speed was extremely fast as he stepped into the array.</p><p>Lu Ming did not use the heaven Dao soldier.</p><p>The six sages had already proven that the heaven Dao soldiers were useless.</p><p>Using them would only damage them.</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to try it with his own strength.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming entered the formation, countless tiny sword auras rushed toward him.</p><p>Some of the sword Qi was extremely cold, while the others were extremely hot.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that he was in a furnace where coldness and heat converged. Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The muscles all over Lu Ming’s body trembled rapidly. At the same time, he activated the imperishable golden body to block the sword Qi.</p><p>Ding! Ding! Ding!</p><p>When the sword Qi stabbed Lu Ming’s body, there was a piercing sound of metal clashing. Many of the sword Qi were blocked.</p><p>However, Lu Ming felt a sharp pain in his body as if he was being pricked by needles.</p><p>Although most of the sword aura was blocked, a portion of it broke through Lu Ming’s defense and pierced into his body.</p><p>Lu Ming quickly activated the indestructible ancient scroll and recovered quickly.</p><p>Fortunately, Lu Ming’s physical body was extremely strong and his life force was exuberant. With the help of the indestructible ancient scroll, his injuries recovered very quickly.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a few steps forward. However, the further he went, the more sword aura he encountered.</p><p>More sword Qi pierced into Lu Ming’s body. His recovery speed could not keep up with the speed of his injuries.</p><p>“My Lord!”</p><p>Lu Ming growled. His entire body was covered in a purple-gold light. The power of domination covered his entire body.</p><p>A series of concentrated sounds rang out, and the ruler’s power trembled, but it wasn’t pierced. The sword Qi was blocked.</p><p>“The power of a ruler is indeed effective!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>Then, he continued to stride forward. In less than a minute, Lu Ming had advanced more than 50 meters, far surpassing the previous six sages.</p><p>“So fast?”</p><p>what kind of power is this? it’s so terrifying that it can block the attack of that sword Qi.</p><p>“The number one heaven’s pride in the heaven realm is indeed extraordinary and incomparable!”</p><p>The others sighed and hoped that Lu Ming would be able to make it.</p><p>Right now, the heaven realm and the foreign kinds were at a life and death juncture. The stronger the heaven realm was, the more hope they had.</p><p>Naturally, they hoped that Lu Ming would be able to walk over and gain something.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming continued to move forward. Sixty meters, seventy meters, eighty meters…</p><p>Lu Ming moved forward one meter at a time. Very soon, he had walked past a hundred meters.</p><p>However, at this point, the power of the formation was even more terrifying. The sword Qi was endless and densely packed as it blasted towards Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
