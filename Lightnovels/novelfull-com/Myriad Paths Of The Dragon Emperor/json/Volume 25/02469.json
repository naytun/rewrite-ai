How would I dare to fight with you?” Commander Yi Yang forced a smile on his ugly face. Then, he looked at Lu Ming with a cold glint in his long and narrow eyes.”Lu Ming, hurry up and apologize to commander Rama and his guards!”</p><p>“You want me to apologize?”</p><p>Even Lu Ming was stunned. He did not expect Yi Yang to do this.</p><p>Yi Yang didn’t even know what grudges he had with the alien race. He didn’t even ask and wanted him to apologize?</p><p>that’s right. Hurry up. I don’t care what grudges you have. Go and apologize, and you must make commander Rama and his guards forgive you. No matter what method you use, no matter what price you have to pay. Do you understand? ”</p><p>Yi Yang said coldly. His voice was full of threat and he did not hide it at all.</p><p>His meaning was clear. No matter what method Lu Ming used, even if he had to kneel down, even if he had to pay a heavy price, he had to make the other party forgive him so that commander Rama would not challenge him.</p><p>The meeting of commanders didn’t have a rule that those who were ranked higher couldn’t challenge those who were ranked lower.</p><p>Now, it was just the beginning. Only the lower-ranked ones could start the challenge.</p><p>Those who were ranked higher could also challenge those who were ranked lower. However, that would leave a bad impression in the king’s heart.</p><p>Yi Yang was scared to death. Luo mo was ruthless and had strong combat strength. If he challenged him, he would be dead.</p><p>He was cursing in his heart. Of all people, Lu Ming had to offend the guard of commander Rama. He was simply courting death. It was fine if he was courting death, but he had to implicate him.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“What are you laughing at?”</p><p>Yi Yang said coldly. The gloominess in his snake-like eyes became even stronger.</p><p>“I’m laughing. Who Do You Think You Are? What right do you have to order me around?”</p><p>Lu Ming answered indifferently.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Yi Yang’s eyes widened and he was stunned.</p><p>What did Lu Ming say? Lu Ming actually said that he was something?</p><p>How dare he! A flame of anger filled Yi Yang’s chest.</p><p>Lu Ming was just his guard. In the end, he was just his dog. Now, he actually dared to say that in front of the other commanders and the monarch.</p><p>This made him extremely embarrassed and embarrassed. His heart was filled with cold killing intent, and he could not wait to cut Lu Ming into eight pieces.</p><p>If it was any other guard, they would definitely not dare to disobey him. They had to do whatever he said.</p><p>“Hahaha, this brat is seeking his own death!”</p><p>At the side, Bleu laughed wildly in his heart. He did not expect Lu Ming to be so stupid. He was simply courting death.</p><p>no need to talk nonsense. Even if he kneels in front of me today, he must die!</p><p>At this moment, the non-human King spoke coldly.</p><p>Yi Yang’s expression turned even uglier.</p><p>He looked around and his eyes lit up. “Everyone, this guard of mine is arrogant and disregards his superiors. What’s the point of keeping such a person? I will now expel him from the ranks of my guards. If you have any grudges with him, you can go and find him. It has nothing to do with me!”</p><p>“Lu Ming, hand over your guard token!”</p><p>Yi Yang looked at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>“They actually expelled him from the ranks of the guards!”</p><p>this Yi Yang is decisive. However, this way, he can avoid a battle with commander Luo mo. It’s a wise choice!</p><p>that’s right. If it were me, that would be the only thing I could do. I would be courting death if I fought with commander Rama!</p><p>The surrounding commanders were all discussing.</p><p>The country ruler, who was sitting at the top, had a calm expression. He was drinking his wine and no one knew what he was thinking.</p><p>“Here’s your guard token!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out the guard token and threw it to Yi Yang.</p><p>“Commander Rama, Lu Ming is no longer my guard. If you have any problems, you can look for him!”</p><p>Commander Yi Yang looked at commander Rama with a flattering expression.</p><p>“Hehe, this commander is really trash!”</p><p>The non-human King laughed in disdain.</p><p>Yi Yang’s expression was ugly but he did not dare to refute. The other party was Rama’s guard. Offending him was equivalent to offending Rama.</p><p>“It’s all because of Lu Ming. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be like this!”</p><p>Yi Yang looked at Lu Ming coldly, his killing intent flashing.</p><p>This time, he had kicked Lu Ming out of the ranks of guards in public. Not only did he have one less person on his side, but he was also afraid that the king’s impression of him was not good. This time, it was definitely impossible for him to increase his ranking. He was afraid that his ranking would even fall and he would be suppressed by the commander of the border city.</p><p>He blamed everything on Lu Ming.</p><p>“You still want to kill me!”</p><p>Lu Ming naturally felt Yi Yang’s murderous intent. There was also a murderous intent in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>Your Majesty, I’m going to challenge Lu Ming to settle my personal grudges.</p><p>Please allow me to do so!</p><p>The non-human King cupped his fists towards the king.</p><p>“Sure!”</p><p>The country ruler said indifferently.</p><p>They were just a few commander guards, so he didn’t take them to heart. Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The non-human King leaped onto the fighting ring and looked at Lu Ming.”Lu Ming, come up and fight!”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. He moved and leaped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>Even if the other party didn’t challenge him, he would still find an opportunity to challenge the other party.</p><p>Alien races were killed without mercy.</p><p>Every time they killed one, the strength of the non-humans would be reduced.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A powerful aura erupted from the non-human King.</p><p>This is… Second level void transformation stage, what a powerful aura!”</p><p>what a terrifying strength. It’s only a guard of commander Rama, but he actually has the strength of a second level void transformation stage martial artist!</p><p>The other commanders all cried out in alarm.</p><p>A second level void transformation stage martial artist was equivalent to a two star heavenly Emperor.</p><p>One had to know that some of the other commanders were only at the first level of the void transformation stage and some were at the second level of the void transformation stage.</p><p>On the other hand, even a guard of commander Rama was at the second level void transformation stage. The difference between them was too great.</p><p>Luo Mo’s lips curled into a cold smile. This was his trump card. This time, he was going to defeat commander Yu Zhan and obtain the first place.</p><p>“Kill! Destruction Sword formation!”</p><p>The non-human King shouted coldly. Beams of destructive light shot out from his third eye and turned into combat swords. They formed a sword formation and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was calm. He swung his fist and threw dozens of punches in a row.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming did not use the way of domination. Instead, he simply used his physical strength.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>After dozens of continuous explosions, Lu Ming shook off the sword formation, but he also retreated continuously.</p><p>“He actually blocked it!”</p><p>The other commanders were shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually blocked the opponent’s attack. This was enough to prove that Lu Ming was also at the heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p>that Yi Yang has a guard at the transformation void martial stage!</p><p>The commander of the border city had a dark look in his eyes.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Yi Yang roared.</p><p>The stronger Lu Ming’s performance was, the more uncomfortable he felt. He could not help but think how good it would have been if Lu Ming had not offended Rama’s guards. Then, he would have been able to climb up the ranking.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>That country ruler Feng Ming was also interested.</p><p>He had never seen Lu Ming and the foreign tribe’s royal family before. He could not help but feel curious about the fact that Feng Ming country suddenly had two void transformation stage existences.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
