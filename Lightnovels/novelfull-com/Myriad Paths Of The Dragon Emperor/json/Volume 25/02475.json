As soon as Lu Ming won, King Feng Ming immediately sent someone to confer Lu Ming the title of first commander and to rope him in.</p><p>“Many thanks, country ruler!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists.</p><p>congratulations, commander Lu!</p><p>congratulations!</p><p>The other commanders also came forward to congratulate Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded in response. Not long after, the crowd dispersed and Lu Ming officially took charge of the governor’s manor, the Army, and the territory of Rama.</p><p>Two days later, Lu Ming began to send people to investigate the foreign races in Fengming country. He also sent people to look for clues about the cursed land. There were many Cursed Lands in netherworld mountain, and the living beings of netherworld mountain could not enter.</p><p>In Feng Ming country, there was a cursed land that was heavily guarded by Feng Ming country ruler.</p><p>After more than ten days, there was finally news that they had found traces of foreign races in the North of Feng Ming.</p><p>According to their subordinates, there were a total of three alien races. Their cultivation levels were unknown, but they did not disturb them.</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes and he set off immediately.</p><p>There was no reason for him to let the alien races go.</p><p>Lu Ming charged over directly.</p><p>In a Valley, three non-humans were discussing how to enter the capital of Feng Ming and find an opportunity to enter the cursed land.</p><p>However, these three alien races weren’t particularly strong. Two of them were one-star heavenly emperors, and the other was a great emperor.</p><p>Lu Ming could sense the other party’s cultivation. He did not hesitate and attacked immediately.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming rushed into the sky and shot out three spearlights. Without any suspense, the three foreign kinds were killed immediately.</p><p>Then, he took the other party’s storage ring and burned the alien’s corpse to ashes. Lu Ming left the place.</p><p>After that, there were no more traces of foreign races in Feng Ming.</p><p>Netherworld mountain was huge, and Fengming country was only a small part of it. This time, there were not many outsiders who came in. There were only a few thousand of them, and they were scattered. Naturally, there were not many people from Fengming country.</p><p>Lu Ming put more energy into the cursed land.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered on how to find an opportunity to sneak into the cursed land. At this moment, monarch Feng Ming sent someone to summon Lu Ming. Within the Imperial Palace, in a large hall, monarch Feng Ming sat on the high seat.</p><p>Lu Ming walked into the hall and cupped his fists. “Lu Ming greets the country ruler!”</p><p>“Commander Lu, please take a seat!”</p><p>King Feng Ming waved his hand, an inexplicable smile on his face.</p><p>Lu Ming sat down at the side.</p><p>“I wonder why the country ruler has summoned Lu Ming?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>King Feng Ming seemed to be smiling but not smiling. He muttered to himself for a moment before he suddenly opened his mouth, ” “Lu Ming, if I’m not mistaken, you’re not from the netherworld world, are you?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat, but his face remained calm.”Country ruler must be joking. If I’m not from the yellow Springs world, where would I be from?”</p><p>“It came from beyond the heavens!”</p><p>King Feng Ming opened his mouth and his eyes became even brighter, ” in the ancient records of my Fengming country, there were records that in the distant past, who knows how many years ago, there were people from beyond the heavens who descended. These people from beyond the heavens were not afraid of the cursed land of netherworld mountain and could enter and leave freely! as for you, I can’t find any information on you. It’s as if you appeared out of thin air. After you became the commander, you immediately sent people to investigate some inexplicable people. Most importantly, you’ve been investigating the cursed Lands all this time!</p><p>no one in the yellow Springs world is interested in the cursed Lands because the people of the yellow Springs world can’t enter these Cursed Lands. Only people from beyond the heavens are interested in the cursed Lands. Am I right? ” King Feng Ming’s eyes were bright as he stared at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s thoughts turned quickly. He pondered for a while and said, “That’s right, I’m indeed from beyond the heavens!”</p><p>Since the other party was already suspicious, there was nothing to hide. It was better to just say it out and negotiate with the other party.</p><p>“He really is from beyond the heavens!”</p><p>King Feng Ming’s eyes were incomparably bright as he said excitedly, ” I didn’t expect it, I didn’t expect it. So the ancient records are true. I always thought it was just made up, just a legend!</p><p>After a long while, monarch Feng Ming finally calmed down.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you want to enter the cursed land, don’t you?”</p><p>Asked King Feng Ming.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and told him the truth.</p><p>“Legend has it that the cursed land was left behind by the most ancient ancestor of the yellow Springs world. You’ll have a great opportunity. Lu Ming, let’s work together. I’ll let you enter the cursed land, and you’ll split the treasures you obtain 50 – 50. How about it?”</p><p>Said King Feng Ming.</p><p>that’s right, we’ll split it 50 – 50. If I don’t let you enter the cursed land, you won’t be able to enter either. You have to understand this!</p><p>King Feng Ming said, his body exuding a powerful aura.</p><p>Monarch Feng Ming was a fourth level void transformation stage martial artist. He was a peerless expert that was equivalent to a four-star heavenly Emperor. “Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate and nodded.</p><p>It was a win-win cooperation. Lu Ming did not have to fall out with the other party.</p><p>“Fine, hahaha, commander Lu, you can go back first. I will let you know in a few days!”</p><p>King Feng Ming smiled.</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and left.</p><p>Lu Ming returned to the governor’s manor. He cultivated while waiting.</p><p>He was looking forward to the cursed land.</p><p>However, entering the cursed Lands and whether one could gain anything from it still depended on luck.</p><p>This was because before the myriad tribulation, someone had entered the yellow Springs world.</p><p>However, it was too long ago before the myriad tribulation. The heaven realm was probably still in the earliest primordial era. At that time, there were probably not many powerful people, and there were probably not many living creatures that came in.</p><p>There might be many Cursed Lands that had not been explored.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, three days had passed. Liao min had something important to report to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Commander, there are more than ten people outside saying that they are from your hometown and they want to see you!”</p><p>Liao min said.</p><p>“From the same hometown?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. Wasn’t his fellow villager from the heaven realm?</p><p>“Quickly let them in!”</p><p>Lu Ming instructed.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Liao min nodded and left. A moment later, he came in with a dozen people.</p><p>“Senior six saints!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up when he saw one of them. He went forward to greet him.</p><p>These people were beings from the heaven realm. Lu Ming recognized one of the elders. He was heavenly venerate six sages, a four-star heavenly Emperortier powerhouse who guarded the two world city.</p><p>Back then, he had met Lu Ming a few times.</p><p>Apart from heavenly venerate six sages, Lu Ming did not recognize the rest of the people. Judging by their cultivation, they were at the celestial Emperor realm and great emperor realm. Among them, heavenly venerate six sages ‘cultivation was the highest.</p><p>“Liao min, you guys can leave!”</p><p>Lu Ming instructed Liao min and the rest to leave.</p><p>After Liao min and the others left, only Lu Ming, six sages, and the others were left in the hall.</p><p>“Senior, are you also in the vicinity of Feng Ming?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“No, we’re here to look for you!”</p><p>Heavenly venerate six sages sighed.”Lu Ming, I’m afraid that Fengming country is no longer safe!”</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed slightly.</p><p>the foreign race has already obtained the Dragon people Empire’s trust and is in control of the Dragon people Empire’s powerful strength!</p><p>The celestial said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
