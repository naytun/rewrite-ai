He slowly gained the upper hand and began to suppress the first Prince.</p><p>At this moment, the two of them were covered in blood because they had been hit too many times.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming landed another punch on the first Prince’s shoulder. Half of his body almost exploded.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming was also hit. He was also severely injured, but his recovery speed was faster than his opponent.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not give the other party a chance to recover. He charged forward with his injuries.</p><p>The more they fought, the more serious the first Prince’s injuries became. He was less and less of a match for Lu Ming. In the end, he was completely suppressed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The first Prince’s chest was hit, and his bones were broken. His body was sent flying far away, and he spat out a large mouthful of blood. His aura was extremely weak.</p><p>Lu Ming was about to suppress the other party in one go.</p><p>However, at this moment, a shadow flashed and a figure appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>The figure wore a crown on his head and exuded an earth-shattering aura. Under this aura, Lu Ming could not move at all. He could not even move a finger.</p><p>The king of the outsiders!</p><p>This was a non-human King and he was terrifyingly powerful. The difference between Lu Ming and him was too great.</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>The non-human King said coldly with a dark expression.</p><p>“We pay our respects to the king!”</p><p>Many people saluted.</p><p>The evil god tribe had ten Royal tribes, and the king of each royal tribe had a Supreme status and was respected by most of the other races.</p><p>“Today’s battle ends here. Everyone, step down!”</p><p>The non-human King instructed.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Many alien races bowed and flew toward the holy mountain.</p><p>However, they were all shocked, especially mo tianluo, storm, and the others. They were all dazed.</p><p>They understood that even if the king of the non-human race appeared, it would not change the fact that the first Prince had been defeated.</p><p>This so-called most powerful prodigy in the history of the evil god tribe had also been defeated by Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming had single-handedly defeated the entire Longevity Roll.</p><p>This was something they had never expected.</p><p>The first Prince stood in the distance, his golden eyes flashing with an extremely cold light.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! the first Prince shouted coldly. He turned into a stream of light and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>He had always been invincible. Now that he had been defeated, he had a strong desire to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>However, he was blocked by a force on the way. It was the power of the king of the non-human race.</p><p>“You can’t kill him!”</p><p>The non-human King spoke.</p><p>this person is a human. I must kill him or else I’ll be in endless trouble!</p><p>The first Prince shouted.</p><p>“Whether to kill or not, we know what to do. Back down!”</p><p>The alien King berated.</p><p>The first Prince’s expression changed.</p><p>Although he was known as the strongest heaven’s favorite in the history of the evil god World and had a very high status, he still did not dare to act presumptuously in front of the king of the alien race.</p><p>The ten kings of the evil god tribe were the ten people with the highest status in the evil god World, excluding the sacred ancestor.</p><p>“You may withdraw!”</p><p>Another voice rang in the first Prince’s ears.</p><p>Hearing this voice, the first Prince’s expression changed again. This was because this voice belonged to his father.</p><p>The first Prince cast a cold glance at Lu Ming with his golden eyes. He turned into a beam of light and flew toward the holy mountain.</p><p>Only Lu Ming, Jiayi, and a few others were left at the scene.</p><p>Lu Ming did not beat around the bush. He was in the evil god Realm and had no choice. He was prepared to deal with the other party however they wanted to.</p><p>However, don’t even think about making him yield.</p><p>In the depths of the firmament, a few non-human Kings were discussing matters.</p><p>“What should we do now?”</p><p>A non-human King asked.</p><p>All of this was completely out of their expectations and out of their control.</p><p>Their plan was to let Lu Ming see the power of the evil god Realm, to make him despair and to make him yield.</p><p>However, they had never expected that Lu Ming’s talent and combat strength would be so high.</p><p>He actually broke through the longevity Roll!</p><p>In that case, they would be the ones to suffer a blow. It would be the evil god tribe and not Lu Ming.</p><p>No one below the heavenly Emperor could defeat Lu Ming. How could they make Lu Ming yield?</p><p>Their plan had failed.</p><p>I didn’t expect this kid to be so talented. No wonder the sacred ancestor bloodheart chose him. Once the sacred ancestor bloodheart revives in him, he’ll definitely be able to recover to his peak!</p><p>“Not bad. Unfortunately, the prison-guarding stele is in the way!”</p><p>The faces of the Kings of the other races were ugly.</p><p>For a moment, they could not think of a solution at all.</p><p>They could not take away the prison-suppressing stele and Lu Ming refused to yield. They had no other choice.</p><p>“Could it be that we’re going to invite the divine ancestor?”</p><p>A non-human King spoke, but the other non-human Kings were silent.</p><p>“No, the Holy ancestor has been in secluded meditation ever since the battle to recover from his injuries. Unless it’s an urgent matter, we can’t disturb him!” that’s right. I suggest that we wait for a while and spend more time studying it.</p><p>I don’t believe that we can’t find a way to get rid of the prison-suppressing stele!</p><p>The other non-human Kings chimed in.</p><p>Hundreds of years, thousands of years, or even tens of thousands of years, in their eyes, was just the snap of a finger.</p><p>At most, they would spend another tens of thousands of years or even hundreds of thousands of years to research it. They did not believe that they could not find a way.</p><p>I suggest that we lock Lu Ming up in the eternal cage. This kid has not even been born for two hundred years. If we lock him up in the eternal cage, he might yield after a few thousand or ten thousand years!</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>The Kings all nodded and reached a consensus.</p><p>“I’ll bring him there!”</p><p>A non-human King finished speaking and disappeared in a flash.</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly felt an extremely powerful force enveloping him. His vision turned black and he could not see anything.</p><p>“Let’s see what you guys are up to!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was calm. He sat cross-legged and waited quietly.</p><p>After an unknown period of time, Lu Ming was swept away by a wave of energy and left the darkness. Light appeared in front of him.</p><p>“Where is this place?”</p><p>Lu Ming sized it up.</p><p>He found himself in a stone room, and the door was closed.</p><p>“It seems like I’ve been locked back in the secret chamber again!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Since he was already here, he might as well take things as they were. Lu Ming sat cross-legged and began to regulate his breathing.</p><p>In the previous battle, he had suffered some injuries. Although he had the indestructible ancient scroll, he had not fully recovered. After a period of healing, Lu Ming had returned to his peak state.</p><p>In the following days, Lu Ming spent his time comprehending the laws and tempering his body.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, three months had passed.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>On this day, the door of the stone room opened, and a foreign man in red armor walked in.</p><p>“Heavenly Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat when he saw the alien. This alien was a powerhouse at the heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p>“Follow me!”</p><p>The red-armored being said coldly before turning around and leaving.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a while and followed..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
