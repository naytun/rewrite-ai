Where are you now?”</p><p>The Titan longhorn beetle hurriedly asked.</p><p>“I’m currently in the netherworld imperial capital!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Netherworld imperial capital, how did you get in?”</p><p>The Titan longhorn beetle’s eyes widened in surprise.</p><p>The others were the same.</p><p>my wife used a secret technique to conceal the aura of the heaven realm. That’s how I came in. I’ve already found information about senior ancestral Dragon!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“How is senior ancestral Dragon?”</p><p>The Titan longhorn beetle, the nine lives devilish silkworm, and the rest looked at Lu Ming nervously, afraid to hear that something had happened to the ancestral Dragon.</p><p>“Senior ancestral Dragon didn’t die. He just escaped from the netherworld imperial capital with injuries.” Lu Ming briefly explained what he knew.</p><p>“That’s good!”</p><p>Hearing that the ancestral Dragon was fine, everyone heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>I’ve also received some news. The evil god tribe will probably send experts to besiege a cursed land. There should be experts from the heaven realm in there. I’m afraid we’ll have to fight!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Fight, we must fight!”</p><p>that’s right! I’m going to kill that bunch of evil god race trash!</p><p>The Titan Longhorn and the others roared.</p><p>“Seniors, Lu Ming has something to give you!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze shifted to the Titan longhorn beetle and the nine lives devilish silkworm. The Jade bottle appeared in his hand.</p><p>“You have something for us?”</p><p>The Titan longhorn beetle and the nine lives devilish silkworm were both confused.</p><p>I obtained this pill from an Alchemist family in the imperial capital of the netherworld. It’s called the life-or-death pill. It has the effect of seizing the Fortune of the heavens and earth. Anyone below the martial God Realm, no matter how serious their injuries are, even if their life essence is injured, can be healed!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“What? There’s actually such a pill in this world?”</p><p>Everyone’s mouth was wide open in shock.</p><p>“Lu Ming, how can we accept such a valuable pill!”</p><p>Then, the nine lives devilish silkworm shook its head.</p><p>seniors, pills are inanimate objects. If they can’t display their full power, they won’t be of any value. If the two seniors can recover to their peak, it will be a blessing for the heaven realm. Only then will the life-or-death pill show its true value!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“That’s right, that’s exactly the case!”</p><p>The others also nodded and urged the two to accept it.</p><p>Once the Titan Longhorn and nine lives devilish silkworm recovered to their peak, they would be two peak celestial emperors.</p><p>There were not many in the entire heaven realm who could reach this stage.</p><p>“Alright, Lu Ming. I, old bull, will remember your kindness!”</p><p>The Titan longhorn beetle was more straightforward and nodded in agreement.</p><p>In fact, they were also very tempted.</p><p>After all, it had been countless years since the ancient battle, and they had yet to recover to their peak. This feeling was truly unpleasant.</p><p>Lu Ming poured out two life-or-death pills and handed them to the Titan longhorn beetle and the nine lives devilish silkworm. The two of them took the pills and chose a spot each. They sat down cross-legged, swallowed the life-or- death pills, and began to refine them.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he left the small world and reappeared beside Xie nianqing. He continued to observe the mansion.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a few days had passed.</p><p>There was finally some movement in the mansion.</p><p>A group of experts from the yellow Springs Empire appeared and entered the mansion. After a while, a large group of people flew out of the mansion.</p><p>There were experts from the evil god tribe and the yellow spring Empire. There were hundreds of them.</p><p>They headed straight for the Western City Gate.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing followed from a distance.</p><p>Not long after, the experts from the evil god tribe and the yellow spring Empire left the city gate and headed west.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing had also successfully exited the city gate and followed from a distance.</p><p>They didn’t dare to get too close as there were too many experts in the evil god tribe and the yellow spring Empire.</p><p>There were even peak heavenly emperors, not just one or two, but at least five or six.</p><p>In addition, there were also many six-star and five-star heavenly emperors.</p><p>This was an extremely shocking power.</p><p>With so many experts being mobilized at once, it was obvious that they wanted to capture all the living beings in the heaven realm in the cursed land in one fell swoop, leaving none alive.</p><p>After flying for more than a day, they came to an extremely remote place. In front of them, there was a scorching aura.</p><p>It turned out that there was a large group of volcanoes in front of them, with no end in sight.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>There were volcanoes erupting continuously, and lava shot into the sky. The air was filled with black smoke and a pungent smell.</p><p>The cursed land was in the middle of the volcanoes.</p><p>The people of the yellow Springs Empire couldn’t enter, so they hid outside the volcano.</p><p>As for the evil god tribe, they charged into the volcano range.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Not long after, a terrifying explosion erupted among the volcanoes.</p><p>A great battle erupted. Terrifying energy pierced through the ground. Endless lava rushed into the sky, causing the area to become even hotter.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>In the depths of the volcano, there was a Golden Lion with nine heads. It was incomparably huge and stood tall as it roared towards the sky.</p><p>The surrounding volcanoes exploded one after another in an extremely ferocious manner.</p><p>“Big brother Qing Cang!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>It was the nine-headed Golden Lion Qing Cang.</p><p>Qing Cang was a peak heavenly Emperor and was extremely powerful. However, the evil god tribe also had peak heavenly emperors.</p><p>in the volcano range, terrifying auras soared into the sky and collided with each other.</p><p>the heaven realm has two peak heavenly emperors, but the evil god race has three!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart felt heavy.</p><p>The evil god tribe now had one more peak-stage heavenly Emperor. Moreover, Lu Ming could sense that the evil god tribe also had more five star and six star heavenly emperors.</p><p>If this continued, the heavenly realm would definitely not be a match for them.</p><p>In addition, the experts of the yellow spring Empire were lying in ambush outside the volcano. The number of experts was even more than that of the evil god tribe. If the heaven realm creatures rushed out, it would be really dangerous.</p><p>“I wonder how the two seniors, the Titan Longhorn and the nine lives devilish silkworm, are recovering?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little anxious.</p><p>If they were to attack later, they would be at a disadvantage because they didn’t have enough experts.</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron and could be considered a peak heavenly Emperor.</p><p>Xie nianqing could be considered a peak heavenly Emperor.</p><p>Including Zhan Li, there were only three peak heavenly emperors. They were not enough.</p><p>Lu Ming could sense that there were four peak heavenly emperors in the yellow Springs Empire. In addition to the three from the evil god tribe, there were seven of them.</p><p>In addition, there was still the six-star heavenly Emperor.</p><p>If the Titan longhorn beetle and the nine lives devilish silkworm recovered, then there was no need to fear.</p><p>“Charge out!”</p><p>Qing Gang’s loud roar rang out among the volcanoes.</p><p>After that, a group of heaven realm experts joined forces and rushed out. The people from the evil god tribe were in hot pursuit.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. He then entered the small world with a thought. He wanted to see if the Titan longhorn beetle and the nine lives devilish silkworm had recovered.</p><p>At this moment, the two of them were surrounded by a brilliant light and their auras were very powerful.</p><p>“Peak heavenly Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but feel overjoyed when he sensed their auras.</p><p>The life-or-death pill was worthy of being a peerless divine medicine. Its medicinal effects were incomparably shocking.</p><p>It had only been a few days, but the Titan longhorn beetle and the nine lives devilish silkworm had almost fully recovered. Their auras had returned to peak heavenly Emperor.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
