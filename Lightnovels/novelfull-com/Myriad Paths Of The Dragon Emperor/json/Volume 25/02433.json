I’ll block them!”</p><p>Wu taidao strode forward and killed those foreign kinds.</p><p>Lu Ming, on the other hand, rushed to the other man to help him break the chain and armor.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s help, the person broke through the armor in a few moves and a terrifying aura emanated from his body.</p><p>He was also a six-star heavenly Emperor from the prison suppression field, who was no weaker than Wu tai.</p><p>This time, he was the one who had escaped, along with Wu tai and Qing Cang, who were the strongest.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, thank you!”</p><p>The man cupped his fists and then rushed toward Wu tai. Together with Wu tai, they fought against the alien experts.</p><p>There weren’t many foreign experts guarding the eternal cage.</p><p>There were only 18 heavenly Emperor stage existences.</p><p>This was because the divine ancestor weapon and the peak heavenly Emperor duo Lei were enough. There was no need for so many experts to guard the place. There were 18 celestial thearchs. Lu Ming had killed one earlier, so there were 17 left.</p><p>Among them, there was only one six-star heavenly Emperor. Now that there were two six-star heavenly emperors, the non-humans were at a disadvantage. Many people heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>They were safe now. At least, with their current strength, they didn’t need to fear the foreign tribes.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to help the others break their armors.</p><p>As more and more experts joined the battle, the non-humans were completely outmatched. After a few of their heavenly monarchs were killed, the remaining ones didn’t dare to fight and retreated into the light barrier.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Duo Lei roared continuously, his face grimaced.</p><p>He could only fight with Qing Cang and couldn’t deal with the others.</p><p>They were outside the light curtain, and he couldn’t control the power of the restriction to deal with Qing Cang and the others.</p><p>“That kid, it’s all that kid’s fault, Lu Ming…”</p><p>Duo Lei bellowed in his heart. He swept his gaze at Lu Ming, his eyes filled with malevolent killing intent.</p><p>All of this was because of Lu Ming. If not for him, Qing Cang and the others would not have been able to escape.</p><p>He could not wait to crush Lu Ming’s bones and scatter his ashes.</p><p>Now, it was too late for regrets. If he had known this would happen, he would have put Lu Ming on the chain armor.</p><p>“Duo Lei, I’ll fight you!”</p><p>Wu tai let out a long howl and charged toward duo Lei.</p><p>The other six-star heavenly Emperor and two five-star heavenly emperors also rushed toward duo Lei.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he continued to help the others break their armors.</p><p>Qing Gang’s combat strength was not weaker than duo Lei’s, and with the other four experts joining forces, duo Lei was immediately at a disadvantage.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>Qing Gang’s body was as big as a mountain, and he was covered in golden light. His nine heads attacked with nine different divine arts.</p><p>As for Wu tai and the others, they cultivated the immemorial system, so their offensive power was also extremely powerful. With a wave of their hands, there were terrifying saber lights and sword lights that could split the sky and earth.</p><p>For a moment, duo Lei was no match for him and was forced to retreat.</p><p>Qing Cang seized the opportunity and rushed over. He clawed out and left a deep wound on duo Lei’s body.</p><p>Duo Lei’s face was pale as he retreated rapidly.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Qing Cang roared. He didn’t want to let duo Lei go, so he launched a fierce attack.</p><p>Wu tai and the others also attacked with all their might.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>In the end, duo Lei let out an angry roar, turned around, and rushed into the light curtain of the restriction.</p><p>There was nothing they could do about it. Without the help of the light barrier, the experts guarding the eternal cage were no match for Qing Cang and the others.</p><p>“Let’s go, we have to leave quickly!”</p><p>go! Qing Cang shouted and turned to leave. A powerful force swept up the others, turning them into a golden light and flying into the distance. They disappeared in the blink of an eye.</p><p>quick, report this to the higher-ups and send people to attack Qing Cang and the others along the way. We must capture them!</p><p>Duo Lei roared and gave the order.</p><p>All of a sudden, more than a hundred heavenly emperors, including a peak heavenly Emperor like Qing Cang, had escaped. If he couldn’t catch them, he would definitely be punished.</p><p>They immediately sent the news to the ten royal families.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were also making the best use of their time.</p><p>Their next destination was the prison suppression field.</p><p>This was what they had planned long ago.</p><p>Out of the entire evil god field, only the prison suppression field could accommodate them.</p><p>Otherwise, even if they managed to escape, they would be captured by the alien races. They would either be captured or killed.</p><p>He would only be safe if he escaped into the prison suppression field.</p><p>They had to hurry and get to the prison suppression field as fast as possible.</p><p>It was certain that the foreign races would send experts to encircle and annihilate them.</p><p>The good thing was that the eternal cage wasn’t far from the prison suppression field.</p><p>Qing Cang, Wu tai, and the others wrapped the others with their power and hurried on with their journey.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he continued to help the rest of the people break their armors.</p><p>As long as more people could recover their combat power, they would be able to fight even if they were surrounded by the foreign races.</p><p>They specifically chose barren mountains to fly in.</p><p>Not long after, everyone’s chains and armors had been broken by Lu Ming.</p><p>Everyone had regained their combat strength.</p><p>More than a hundred heavenly emperors, this was an extremely terrifying force.</p><p>They increased their speed and traveled through space.</p><p>They did not encounter any obstacles on the way.</p><p>More than a hundred celestial thearchs. It was too terrifying. Even if the alien races received the news and temporarily mobilized so many powerful people, they could not catch up to Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>If they wanted to send people to snipe, they could only send the experts in front of Lu Ming’s group. However, there were not many experts in front of Lu Ming’s group in such a short time.</p><p>Even if some experts discovered Lu Ming and the group, they did not dare to stop them.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming and the rest had a smooth journey. They were about to reach the prison suppression field after half a day.</p><p>The prison suppression field was not an independent field from the evil god field. It was only a part of the evil god field. A vast area was covered in layers of black fog.</p><p>The prison suppression field was in the black mist.</p><p>There were large numbers of alien armies stationed in all directions of the prison realm. The two sides had been fighting for countless years.</p><p>The non-humankind had invested a large number of experts in this place.</p><p>Because the prison suppression field was also very strong and often sent people to attack the alien races. If the alien races didn’t send strong people, they would be killed and defeated by the prison suppression field.</p><p>In the mountains to the East of the prison realm.</p><p>A group of people flickered in the mountains. There were about too people in this group, and they were all humans.</p><p>They were the humans from the prison suppression field. There were six heavenly emperors and the rest were great emperors.</p><p>This time, they had come out to ambush and kill the alien races.</p><p>This sort of thing had happened countless times over the countless years.</p><p>They concealed their auras and were extremely cautious.</p><p>This was because they might be hunted down by the alien races when they tried to kill them.</p><p>After passing through the vast mountains, a military camp appeared in front of them.</p><p>An Army of the foreign races was stationed here.</p><p>Their goal today was to destroy this Army.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The leader of this group was a burly man with a three-star heavenly Emperor cultivation base. He was the commander of this group.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
