The stone tablet created by all the great beings from the prison suppression field shook and then exploded.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Some of the weaker ones from the prison suppression field, such as those at the empty Emperor realm, were shaking violently and spat out blood.</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>Elder Liu and the other elders shouted and attacked again.</p><p>Endless light flickered. They condensed another huge stone tablet and flew out.</p><p>If they attacked from the inside, the light barrier of the prison suppression formation would not be able to stop them.</p><p>“A group of ants, looking for death!”</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor roared. A beam of destructive light shot out from between his brows and hit the huge stone tablet. The stone tablet exploded instantly. This time, many of the human cultivators at the void Emperor realm from the prison suppression field were sent flying as if they had been hit by a mountain. They spat out blood and were severely injured. They could no longer fight.</p><p>Even some of the true Emperor realm experts started to bleed from the corners of their mouths.</p><p>“I’ll go with you!”</p><p>Qing Cang rushed out and gathered in the formation. He turned into a huge nine-headed Golden Lion and cooperated with the attack of the formation.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Then, Mrs. Wu and the others also rushed out and joined the formation.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Countless experts shouted and blasted out another stone tablet.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The great beings of the prison suppression field set up a formation to resist the non-human divine ancestor. They exchanged more than a dozen moves.</p><p>However, the people from the prison suppression field were completely at a disadvantage.</p><p>The reason why the great beings of the non-human race could stop the ancestral Dragon was that they had been inscribing the formation a few months in advance. The formation was extremely complete.</p><p>Also, they had more great beings than the prison suppression field. They had the formation disk given by the Saint ancestor of the non-human race, which was why they could stop the ancestral Dragon.</p><p>The people from the prison guard world had set up the formation in a hurry, and they had fewer Masters than the alien race, so they couldn’t fight the alien race’s divine ancestor.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>One by one, the Masters of the prison suppression field were sent flying away. They fell to the ground and spat out blood. They lost the ability to fight.</p><p>In the end, even the great emperors and the heavenly Emperor were shaking and their faces were pale.</p><p>Some of the most powerful people, such as Qing Cang and elder Liu, were the core of the array, so they suffered a lot more from the backlash.</p><p>Their bodies trembled slightly, and blood flowed from the corners of their mouths.</p><p>“Blockit!”</p><p>The old bodies of Liu changlai and the others trembled, but their wills were firm and they wouldn’t retreat.</p><p>“We can only do that!”</p><p>Behind him, Lu Ming clenched his fists tightly and sighed.</p><p>At this point, there was no other way. There was only one way, and that was to merge the prison-suppressing steles together.</p><p>The combination of the prison-suppressing stele and the prison-suppressing formation had greatly increased its power, which was why it could block the attack of the non-human divine ancestor.</p><p>As for sacred ancestor bloodheart, he could only take things one step at a time.</p><p>If it did not work, Lu Ming would not let himself be devoured by the sacred ancestor bloodheart.</p><p>“Prison-suppressing stele, out!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted in a low voice. His body glowed and the prison-suppressing stele appeared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As soon as the prison-suppressing stele appeared, it started to shake violently. It expanded rapidly and emitted an infinite light.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>In the prison suppression field, the broken piece and the eight sub-steles were shaking violently. They seemed to be very excited.</p><p>this is bad. Lu Ming, don’t be rash!</p><p>Qing Cang roared.</p><p>“Think thrice!”</p><p>Wu tai and the others also shouted.</p><p>If Saint ancestor bloodheart was reborn, the consequences would be even more serious.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s eyes were firm and he was unmoved.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>go! Lu Ming shouted. He waved his hand and the prison-suppressing stele flew to the depths of the prison-suppressing field as fast as lightning.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming completely cut off the connection with the prison-guarding stele. The prison-guarding stele moved even faster and stepped into the void. In an instant, it came to the depths of the prison-guarding world, where the fragment was.</p><p>When the two approached each other, the fragment of the prison-suppressing field flew directly from the mountain peak toward Lu Ming’s prisonsuppressing stele.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The two collided and then fused together.</p><p>All the fragments of the prison-guarding stele had merged together to form a complete prison-guarding stele with the soul of the main stele.</p><p>At this moment, the prison-suppressing stele became bigger again. It was as tall as the sky, and it gave off a shocking wave.</p><p>The other eight sub-steles also started to shake crazily. They shone brightly and all the light gathered together to form the prison-suppressing formation.</p><p>In an instant, the power of the prison suppression formation increased dramatically, and the cracks that had appeared before disappeared.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor’s attack landed on the prison-suppressing formation, but the formation only produced a ripple that was far weaker than before.</p><p>Even a non-human divine ancestor at his peak would have needed a long time to break through the complete prison-suppressing formation.</p><p>It would probably take even longer to break it open now. By then, the ancestral Dragon would have escaped.</p><p>However, the non-human divine ancestor stopped and laughed, hahaha, you’re so stupid. Without the suppression of the prison-suppressing stele, let’s see how you can resist the devouring of the killing heart!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s body had indeed undergone a tremendous change.</p><p>As soon as the prison-suppressing stele left, the third bloodline immediately turned the world upside down.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The sound of endless waves crashing could be heard. The third bloodline seemed to have turned into a sea of blood. The sea of blood churned and endless energy swept toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>A loud roar filled with boundless killing intent charged at Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness. It wanted to devour Lu Ming’s consciousness and completely occupy him.</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming’s eyes and hair turned blood red. Even his body was growing bone spikes, making him look extremely ferocious.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Outside, the non-human divine ancestor laughed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, hold on!”</p><p>Qing Cang activated lion roar and roared to help Lu Ming suppress the killing intent, making Lu Ming a little more awake.</p><p>However, without the suppression of the prison-guarding stele, the power of the third bloodline was too strong, and the killing intent was so strong that it was shocking.</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming’s consciousness was almost devoured.</p><p>Lu Ming finally realized how lucky he was in the past. It was all because of the suppression of the prison-suppressing stele that he was not devoured by the third bloodline. Only when he took the initiative to borrow the power of the third bloodline would the third bloodline have an opportunity to take advantage of him.</p><p>Otherwise, he would have been devoured by the third bloodline.</p><p>That was why Lu Ming could not unleash much of the prison-suppressing stele’s power even though it was a high-level bloodline. It was mainly because the prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline was focused on suppressing the third bloodline.</p><p>“Devour, rebirth, kill!”</p><p>The sea of blood churned and formed a huge face. It kept changing, shocking Lu Ming’s consciousness.</p><p>“My Lord!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly let out a long roar and began to operate the path of domination.</p><p>His body suddenly emitted a dazzling purple-gold radiance.</p><p>In an instant, the power of the third bloodline was pushed away a little.</p><p>Lu Ming’s consciousness also became clearer.</p><p>“It’s useful!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>The power of the path of domination was useful, and it could block the corrosion of the third bloodline.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
