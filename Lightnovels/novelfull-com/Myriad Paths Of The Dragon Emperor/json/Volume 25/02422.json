I’ll tell you, the first Prince of my tribe is the first on the longevity Roll!</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>Then, someone flew toward the sacred mountain, apparently to invite the first Prince.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he flew to the side and sat cross-legged on a huge rock.</p><p>I’m afraid that the first Prince’s combat strength is astonishing. He’s definitely above Kang duo. With my current strength, I’m afraid it’s difficult to defeat him!</p><p>“However, my physical body is about to break through. I might as well take this opportunity to break through!”</p><p>Lu Ming made up his mind and took out a pile of Emperor’s medicine. He began to practice the seven Gods mysterious technique to absorb the medicinal power of the emperor’s medicine and attempt to break through to the fifth level of the seven Gods mysterious technique.</p><p>Lu Ming’s physical body had been tempered by the smelting furnace previously and had almost broken through the bottleneck. He could break through at any time. At this moment, Lu Ming was cultivating. His physical body seemed to be very hungry and thirsty, frantically absorbing the external energy.</p><p>Hu hu hu…</p><p>Lu Ming’s physical body seemed to have turned into a black hole, devouring the energy from the outside world.</p><p>no, it’s better to cultivate in the mountain and river diagram!</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>Lu Ming felt very uncomfortable being stared at by so many people.</p><p>With a thought, the mountain and river diagram emerged. Lu Ming turned into a ray of light and entered the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>“A treasure from the heavenly realm!”</p><p>Many of the alien races murmured. They didn’t seem to mind.</p><p>The mountain and river diagram was there. Lu Ming could not escape at all.</p><p>Especially those at the great emperor realm, they could completely break through the attack of the grotto-heaven treasure and attack the people inside.</p><p>Many alien races were waiting there.</p><p>The first Prince was in seclusion. Even if someone invited him, it was unknown how long it would take for him to come out.</p><p>After Lu Ming entered the mountain and river diagram, he could no longer hold back. He took out a large number of Emperor’s medicine, sacred medicine, and Supreme-grade rough stones.</p><p>Hu hu hu …</p><p>As long as Lu Ming circulated the seven Gods mysterious technique, his body would turn into a black hole and devour energy crazily.</p><p>The energy of the emperor’s medicine, the sacred medicine, and the Supreme- grade rough stone were all absorbed by Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>As soon as the energy entered Lu Ming’s body, it seeped into every cell in his body to help him improve his physical strength.</p><p>As the days passed, Lu Ming’s physical body became stronger and stronger.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Half a month later, Lu Ming’s physical strength had reached its peak. Then, with a loud bang, the aura that he emitted increased dramatically.</p><p>At the same time, his bones and muscles were shaking crazily as he was transforming.</p><p>His skin glowed with a layer of treasure light like the light of a divine weapon.</p><p>After a while, his muscles and bones stopped shaking and calmed down.</p><p>At this time, Lu Ming had completely broken through and cultivated the seven Gods mysterious technique to the late-stage of the fifth level.</p><p>Lu Ming’s strength increased explosively. He felt that he had an inexhaustible amount of strength in his body.</p><p>At the same time, the strength of his muscles, defense, and vitality had also increased to an unbelievable level.</p><p>Lu Ming had a feeling that he could be unrivaled among great emperors with his physical strength.</p><p>hahaha, good. Let the first Prince of the outsiders come!</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily. He extended his spiritual senses through the mountain and river diagram to observe the situation outside. He realized that the first Prince had not arrived.</p><p>Lu Ming did not mind. He continued to circulate the ” Seven Gods mysterious technique ” to consolidate his realm, slowly moving towards the limit of the fifth stage late phase.</p><p>Now that he had reached the late-stage of the fifth level of the seven Gods mysterious skill, his next step would be to break through to the sixth level.</p><p>Once he reached the sixth level of the seven Gods mysterious technique, his physical strength alone would be comparable to a Celestial Emperor. That would be truly terrifying.</p><p>However, without a great opportunity, it would be extremely difficult to break through.</p><p>The Archean body cultivator lineage had been passed down for a long time. However, there were only a handful of people who had reached the heavenly Emperor realm. It was clear how difficult it was to cultivate the seven divine mysterious technique to the sixth level.</p><p>Lu Ming cultivated quietly. In the blink of an eye, another half a month had passed.</p><p>At this moment, there was finally some movement outside.</p><p>A figure silently appeared in the sky, overlooking the mountains and rivers.</p><p>All the alien races fell silent.</p><p>It was a young alien, similar to a human. He was obviously a member of the royal family.</p><p>However, they were different from the other royal families.</p><p>He was extremely handsome, and his hair was golden. Under the sunlight, it glowed.</p><p>His three eyes were also golden in color. When he opened them, they were filled with supreme majesty.</p><p>The first Prince!</p><p>The number one royal tribe of the evil god tribe was known as the strongest prodigy of the evil god tribe since ancient times. He had cultivated for less than 300 years and had already reached the peak of the Emperor level.</p><p>He was said to have the bloodline closest to the divine ancestor of the nonhuman race, and his battle-power was even more astonishing. Experts of the same level couldn’t even withstand a single blow from him.</p><p>I’m here to join the first Prince!</p><p>Countless alien races saluted Prince Di Yi, even some of the heavenly emperors. Their eyes were full of respect.</p><p>The first Prince was destined to be invincible in the future.</p><p>“Where is he?”</p><p>The first Prince spoke.</p><p>“It’s in that estate-world treasure!”</p><p>Someone pointed at the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>The first Prince’s golden eyes looked at the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The first Prince stomped his foot down. A huge foot formed and pressed down on the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>He actually attacked directly, and it was abnormally overbearing.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The mountain and river diagram turned into a stream of light and flew out, avoiding the attack.</p><p>Then, there was a flash of light and Lu Ming’s figure appeared. He kept the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>“Make your move, I don’t have that much time to waste!”</p><p>The first Prince placed his hands behind his back and cast an indifferent glance at Lu Ming.</p><p>He was cold, overbearing, and filled with endless confidence.</p><p>This was the first Prince!</p><p>He was high and mighty, like a god, looking down on the common people as if nothing could enter his eyes.</p><p>since you don’t have time, then please go back. I don’t have that much time to waste with you!</p><p>Lu Ming also spoke coldly.</p><p>The other party’s attitude made him unhappy.</p><p>“Ignorant!”</p><p>The first Prince said indifferently.</p><p>Lu Ming’s words did not make him angry, because Lu Ming was not qualified to make him angry.</p><p>In his opinion, Lu Ming was just an ignorant ant.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, a powerful aura emanated from the first Prince.</p><p>It was indeed the aura of a peak Emperor, but it gave off a terrifying pressure, as if one was facing a heavenly Emperor.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The first Prince took a step forward. His body turned into a golden stream of light as he rushed toward Lu Ming and threw a punch.</p><p>He still had one hand behind his back, as if to say that he only needed one hand to deal with Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s muscles trembled and he threw a punch as well.</p><p>Lu Ming did not use world force or laws for this punch. It was purely physical strength.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two fists collided with a heavy boom. Then, a figure retreated a hundred miles.</p><p>It was Lu Ming!</p><p>Lu Ming, the first Prince, was the one who retreated. He did not move.</p><p>“What a terrifying power!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>In the exchange of punches just now, Lu Ming was actually completely at a disadvantage.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
