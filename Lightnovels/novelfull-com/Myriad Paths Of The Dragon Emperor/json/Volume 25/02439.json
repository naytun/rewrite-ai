It was Supreme and suppressed the world.</p><p>It was the aura of someone of the same level. It was the aura of a Supreme expert.</p><p>Because of the prison-guarding formation, there was a layer of black fog outside the prison-guarding field. It was impossible to see through the prisonguarding field from the outside and from the inside of the prison-guarding field, one could not see the outside.</p><p>But now, under the pressure of the aura, the black mist outside the prison suppression field dispersed.</p><p>One could see that there was a light screen between the sky and the earth that covered the entire area.</p><p>It was the light shield formed by the prison suppression formation.</p><p>Outside the light barrier, countless foreign races stood in the air or on the ground. There were so many of them that it was impossible to count.</p><p>Suddenly, the space outside split open, and a figure stepped out of the spatial crack.</p><p>However, the figure was shrouded in a layer of black light, and its appearance could not be seen clearly. However, the Supreme aura was emanating from this figure.</p><p>The moment he appeared, the aura became even more terrifying.</p><p>It was as if he was this world, he was everything, and the heavenly Dao had to grovel at his feet.</p><p>“Greetings, sacred ancestor!”</p><p>All of the alien races were very respectful.</p><p>“Holy ancestor?”</p><p>Everyone in the prison suppression field was shocked.</p><p>“Divine ancestor, the non-human divine ancestor has awakened!”</p><p>A white-haired elder from the prison suppression field said with a trembling voice. His eyes were full of fear.</p><p>This was an extremely powerful existence, but he was filled with fear when he saw that figure.</p><p>He was not the only one. Many of the great beings from the prison realm were the same.</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor was a Supreme Master, on the same level as the prison-guarding old ancestor.</p><p>That kind of person was too powerful. He had transcended the heavenly path and the heavenly Emperor realm. He had completely reached another level of life.</p><p>Heavenly Emperor-level existences were vulnerable in his hands.</p><p>Now, the divine ancestor of the non-human race had actually awakened and descended.</p><p>“The clan of purgatory shall be destroyed!”</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor said coldly, his voice filled with Supreme might.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor took a step forward, and the entire sky shook violently. A huge foot formed in the sky and stomped down on the prison suppression field.</p><p>It was so big that it covered the sky. It was even bigger than the entire prison suppression field.</p><p>From a distance, one could see that there was a dome-shaped light shield around the prison suppression field.</p><p>An incomparably huge foot, which was even bigger than the light shield, stomped heavily on the light shield.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>An earth-shaking explosion was heard. The entire prison suppression field was shaking and many buildings collapsed.</p><p>The light shield formed by the prison-guarding stele was also shaking crazily, sending out layers of waves.</p><p>However, he managed to block it in the end. This kick didn’t break the prison suppression formation. The prison suppression formation stabilized.</p><p>“Hahaha, it’s blocked, it’s blocked!”</p><p>“He can’t break it!”</p><p>The people from the prison suppression field were shocked at first, and then they were overjoyed.</p><p>The prison-suppressing formation formed by the prison-suppressing stele had actually blocked the non-human divine ancestor’s attack.</p><p>“Hmph, let’s see how many moves this broken formation can block!”</p><p>A destructive light shot out from his glabella and turned into nine huge swords that slashed at the prison suppression formation.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Terrifying explosions kept sounding. The entire prison suppression field was like a small boat in the ocean, being hit by the waves and swaying with them, as if it could be destroyed at any time.</p><p>The eight sub-steles in the prison suppression field shook and shone with infinite light.</p><p>At the center of the prison suppression field, the broken piece of the main stele was also shining with infinite light, strengthening the prison suppression formation.</p><p>However, the non-human divine ancestor’s attack was too powerful. The terrifying power made many weaker cultivators cough up blood and fall to the ground.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The mountains were shaken and exploded, sending rocks and dust flying everywhere.</p><p>“Not good, if this continues, I’m afraid we won’t be able to hold on for long!” the divine ancestor of the non-human race was also severely injured. After so many years, he’s still far from his peak. Otherwise, the prison-suppressing formation wouldn’t have been able to stop him!</p><p>“If all the prison-guarding steles are gathered, maybe we can stop it!”</p><p>Many of the great beings from the prison suppression field were anxious.</p><p>After all, the non-human divine ancestor was a Supreme Master, on the same level as the prison guard patriarch.</p><p>Although the non-human divine ancestor had been injured and lost his peak combat power, the prison-suppressing formation was only formed by the treasures left behind by the prison-suppressing great ancestor. He wasn’t the one controlling it, so there was a huge difference in power.</p><p>Furthermore, it was only an incomplete formation. How could it block the attack of the non-human divine ancestor? it would be broken sooner or later.</p><p>Now, they were caught in a dilemma.</p><p>If Lu Ming returned the prison-suppressing stele, the power of the prisonsuppressing formation would definitely surge. However, Saint ancestor bloodheart would probably be revived.</p><p>If he didn’t return the prison guarding stele, he wouldn’t be able to hold on and would die.</p><p>Lu Ming’s brows furrowed deeply.</p><p>He was also considering whether he should control the prison-guarding steles and gather them to strengthen the power of the prison-guarding formation.</p><p>However, in that case, without the suppression of the prison-suppressing stele, the third bloodline would definitely take the opportunity to devour Lu Ming’s consciousness.</p><p>The situation was extremely dangerous.</p><p>“What do we do?”</p><p>Everyone was extremely anxious.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, a Dragon’s Roar rang out between heaven and earth.</p><p>The Dragon roar shook the heavens and earth as a Supreme pressure filled the air.</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>In the distance, the void trembled violently and cracked open. A Dragon Claw suddenly stretched out from the void.</p><p>This Dragon Claw was too big and boundless. It grabbed towards countless foreign kinds and enveloped them.</p><p>At this moment, countless outsiders, including the Kings of the ten royal families, were all terrified. They felt as if they were going to be turned into ashes by this claw.</p><p>“It’s you, you little worm!”</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor roared in anger. He waved his hand and a huge palm struck out, clashing with the Dragon Claw.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying explosion erupted, and the sky within a radius of millions of miles exploded, creating countless spatial cracks.</p><p>The same thing happened to the ground below. It kept exploding, and lava rushed into the sky.</p><p>Terrifying, this was too terrifying!</p><p>Just a single exchange of moves was enough to destroy the heavens and earth.</p><p>If it weren’t for the protection of their divine ancestor, a large number of them would have died.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>a dragon roar shook the sky, and space exploded as an enormous true dragon appeared in the air.</p><p>This true dragon was too huge, at least a million miles long. It circled in the sky, covering the sky and the sun.</p><p>Countless people were dumbfounded.</p><p>ancestral Dragon! It’s senior ancestral Dragon!</p><p>Qing Cang cried out in surprise.</p><p>it’s senior ancestral Dragon. Senior ancestral Dragon is here. We’re saved!</p><p>The great beings from the prison suppression field also laughed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
