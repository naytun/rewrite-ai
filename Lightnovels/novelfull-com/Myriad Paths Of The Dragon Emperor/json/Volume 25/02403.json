Instantly, two peak great emperor evil god race members went around dandan and charged toward Lu Ming and Pao Pao.</p><p>Before they even reached Lu Ming, two terrifying beams of destructive light were already heading for him.</p><p>Lu Ming exerted all his strength and 17 types of laws covered his entire body. His muscles trembled non-stop and he swept out the great desolation spear. BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two beams of destructive light bombarded the great desolation spear. The great desolation spear trembled violently and the power of law on it was destroyed. The two beams of energy surged over. Lu Ming’s body shook violently and he spat out a mouthful of blood. Wounds appeared on his body and blood flowed out.</p><p>Lu Ming was no match for two peak great emperors and was injured in one move.</p><p>Fortunately, Lu Ming’s defense was amazing and he had used the indestructible ancient scroll. His injuries were healing rapidly and it did not affect his combat strength much.</p><p>“What do we do?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing.</p><p>He was no match for a peak Emperor.</p><p>As for the heavenly Emperor corporeal body, there wasn’t much energy stored in it. If he wanted to deal with a peak great emperor, the energy in the heavenly Emperor corporeal body had to reach 100%. Otherwise, it would be useless.</p><p>Under such circumstances, even if Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body’s energy reached 100%, it would still be useless. There were too many foreign races.</p><p>At this moment, there were almost twenty peak great emperors, and there were even more great emperors of other levels.</p><p>Deep in the island, alien races were still coming.</p><p>It was as if an Army of alien races was stationed on this Island.</p><p>Lu Ming still had the fallen star bow. However, his cultivation was only at the true Emperor realm. Even if he used the fallen star bow, it would not be of much use.</p><p>In addition, Lu Ming still had the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron. Unfortunately, the energy of the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron seemed to have been exhausted after the previous battle. All these years, there was no movement at all, and Lu Ming could not control it.</p><p>Now, he only had one trump card, and that was the third bloodline.</p><p>In the past, he didn’t dare to use the third bloodline as it was too evil and seemed to have endless power. However, every time he used the power of the third bloodline, he felt as if he would be eroded by it and become a killing puppet.</p><p>However, he had no choice but to use it today. Otherwise, they would all have to stay here.</p><p>They needed someone to escape and spread the news. Otherwise, it would affect the safety of the Tian Yuan world and Lu Ming’s family and friends.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a hint of ruthlessness. With a thought, his third bloodline appeared. A wave of energy gushed out from the third bloodline and surged into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>Roars rang out in Lu Ming’s mind, and a cold killing intent emanated from him.</p><p>His eyes and hair had turned blood red.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming thrust his spear twice, and two spear gleams collided with the two peak great emperor realm evil god tribe members.</p><p>With two loud bangs, Lu Ming’s body swayed and he took a few steps back. However, he had also blocked the attacks of the two evil god tribe members.</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>Doubt and solemness flashed in the eyes of the two evil god tribe members.</p><p>Lu Ming’s strength suddenly increased explosively, making them feel puzzled.</p><p>not enough, it’s still not enough. Again!</p><p>Lu Ming growled in his heart. The energy in his third bloodline continued to surge into Lu Ming’s body, making his killing intent even stronger.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>kill! Lu Ming shouted and charged at the two evil god tribe members.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming’s strength had increased greatly and he could completely suppress the two members of the evil god tribe.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The two members of the evil god race were sent flying by Lu Ming. However, they were not seriously injured and only suffered minor injuries.</p><p>“Not enough, it’s still not enough!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared in his heart.</p><p>Today, borrowing a little bit of power was far from enough. He had to have overwhelming power to escape.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The third bloodline was like a boundless sea of blood, filled with boundless power.</p><p>At this moment, the sea of blood churned and waves of energy gushed into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Blood mist continued to spread out from Lu Ming’s body. There were even bone spikes that appeared on his body.</p><p>Lu Ming’s appearance became extremely ferocious. The bubble was shocked and flew away from Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>Bubbles was extremely anxious.</p><p>Bubbles had seen Lu Ming’s appearance before. At that time, Lu Ming almost lost himself and became a killing puppet.</p><p>“Bubble, leave quickly!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared. At this moment, his will was severely challenged. His heart was filled with endless killing intent. He only retained a trace of will to control himself.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming let out a roar and rushed toward dandan.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming simply put away the great desolation spear, because his claws had become extremely sharp.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared and clawed at a peak Emperor of the non-human race.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>This non-human Emperor was unable to resist at all. His attack and defense were destroyed by Lu Ming. Then, Lu Ming grabbed his body and tore him in half.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming charged toward the other alien races.</p><p>sacred ancestor bloodheart! It’s sacred ancestor bloodheart! Sacred ancestor bloodheart is still alive! Hahaha! We must capture that kid!</p><p>In the sky, an extremely excited voice came from the other side of the passage. Then, the passage began to shake crazily. The wind and clouds changed color, as if it was going to be torn apart at any time.</p><p>As for the alien races, they became even more frenzied when they heard the voice. They kept charging at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Die, die!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were bloodshot. His claws were like knives as he pounced.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming tore the alien races apart one by one.</p><p>Even a peak Emperor couldn’t stop Lu Ming. Those below the peak Emperor realm couldn’t even withstand a single blow and were killed by Lu Ming in groups.</p><p>“Dandan, bubble, charge out with me!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared and charged forward with all his might. Wherever he passed, the alien races were killed continuously, and he carved out a bloody path.</p><p>At this moment, the bubble flew to dandan. Dandan carried her and followed behind Lu Ming, charging out together.</p><p>“Don’t even think about leaving!”</p><p>The unparalleled expert who was fighting with Earth One and Thunder one shouted coldly. He wanted to give up on Earth One and Thunder one and attack Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Earth One and Thunder one burst forth with no regard for their lives, pushing the power of the heaven Dao soldiers to the extreme and holding on tightly to the other party. It was not easy for the other party to escape in a short time.</p><p>Sila!</p><p>At this moment, a loud boom came from the passage in the sky. Then, an opening was forcefully opened.</p><p>One could see that there were two hands on both sides of the opening. They tore it open with all their might, and the opening slowly grew larger, turning into a spatial Rift.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A towering figure suddenly rushed out of the crack and appeared in the sky above the island.</p><p>The towering figure was burly and covered in purple scales. It exuded a terrifying aura.</p><p>The celestial Emperor!</p><p>This was a heavenly Emperor-level powerhouse.</p><p>Although this foreign being was not as powerful as the peerless powerhouse, he was indeed a powerhouse of the heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The expressions of tu Yi, Lei Yi, and dandan changed drastically.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
