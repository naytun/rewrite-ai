Then, she sat cross-legged and a Black Lotus appeared, enveloping her.</p><p>“Mother…”</p><p>Lu shenhuang was shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flickered and he also came close.</p><p>don’t worry, your mother has succeeded. The memories of this life have completely taken the initiative. She has devoured the memories of her previous life and is about to make a breakthrough!</p><p>Xie nianjun smiled.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed too. It seemed that Xie nianqing had finally succeeded.</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at Xie nianjun again. In his eyes, Xie nianjun was becoming more and more unfathomable. Due to the conflict between the two memories, Xie nianqing’s cultivation was far behind Xie nianjun’s.</p><p>Even Lu Ming could not tell what Xie nianjun’s cultivation level was.</p><p>“Who exactly were Xiao Qing and Xie nianjun in their past lives?”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>He had a feeling that the two of them must have had very shocking backgrounds in their previous lives.</p><p>However, he was already at the peak of the heavenly Emperor realm. He had even met the ancestral Dragon and the non-human divine ancestor, but he still couldn’t figure out Xie nianjun.</p><p>He had asked Xie nianqing this question before. However, Xie nianqing shook his head and did not say much. He only said that it was not the time yet. He seemed to have some concerns and Lu Ming did not pursue the matter.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s aura was getting stronger and stronger. He was at the critical point of breaking through to the heavenly Emperor realm. Everyone waited in the distance.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a month had passed. Xie nianqing was still in the midst of his breakthrough when Lu Ming received a message from the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor.</p><p>Outside the two world city, the passageway that led to the primordial realm had reopened.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>That passageway led to the primordial realm. Back then, Lu Ming had come to the heaven realm through that passageway.</p><p>In the battle back then, the passageway was destroyed by the Divine Nine- Dragon Cauldron controlled by Lu Ming. Back then, evil swordsman said that the passageway would reopen in about a hundred years.</p><p>Now, more than a hundred years had passed, and that passage had finally reopened.</p><p>Lu Ming was a little worried that the alien races would send an Army to attack that passage and enter the primordial realm.</p><p>divine wilderness, wait for your mother here. I have something important to do. I will return to two world city first. When your mother has broken through, come find me in two world city!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Father, be careful!”</p><p>Lu shenhuang said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He took a step forward and the space cracked. Lu Ming entered the crack and disappeared.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s speed, it did not take long for him to rush back to two world city.</p><p>After rushing back to two world city, he learned that the heaven realm had already sent some peerless experts into the ancient battlefield to guard the passage.</p><p>That battlefield was very terrifying, and there were marks left by the peerless experts back then. It was dangerous even for ordinary celestial emperors to enter, and only the peerless experts could enter safely.</p><p>Now, there were many strong people in the heaven realm.</p><p>A group of great beings came from the lair of Zulong. With the great beings from the prison suppression field, there were many great beings.</p><p>But this time, the alien races didn’t do anything. They still focused on defense.</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a sigh of relief when he heard the news.</p><p>Now that the prison suppression field had come to the heaven realm, the two sides had joined forces and their strength had increased greatly.</p><p>The non-human race didn’t seem to want to fight them head-on. Instead, they wanted to wait for sacred ancestor bloodheart to recover.</p><p>Lu Ming was very clear about the alien race’s plan. However, they had no choice.</p><p>The heaven realm could defend, but they couldn’t gather all their forces to attack the evil god Realm and destroy the evil god Realm before Saint ancestor bloodheart recovered.</p><p>The only thing they could do now was to improve themselves as much as possible.</p><p>The final battle would definitely come.</p><p>The passageway was fine. Lu Ming made up his mind and returned to Xie nianqing’s side, waiting for him to break through.</p><p>A few more months passed, and Xie nianqing’s aura reached its peak.</p><p>Heavenly Emperor realm!</p><p>Xie nianqing had finally broken through!</p><p>“Strange!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with doubt.</p><p>Xie nianqing had broken through to the heavenly Emperor realm, but the feeling he gave off was different from the other heavenly emperors.</p><p>Whether it was in the heaven realm or the evil god Realm, after breaking through to the celestial Emperor realm, no matter what cultivation system one cultivated in, they all belonged to the heavenly Dao and involved the power of the heavenly Dao.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming’s path of domination was an exception.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not sense any aura of the heavenly Dao from Xie nianqing. There was only pure strength, but it gave off a terrifying feeling.</p><p>Lu shenhuang cultivated the same technique as Xie nianqing. It did not belong to any cultivation system in the heaven realm or the evil god Realm.</p><p>Lu Ming knew that it should be Xie nianqing’s cultivation method from his previous life.</p><p>“Lu Ming, the divine wilderness…”</p><p>Not long after the breakthrough, Xie nianqing retracted his aura. He opened his eyes and smiled at Lu Ming and Lu shenhuang.</p><p>“Mother, have you completely recovered?”</p><p>Lu shenhuang was overjoyed.</p><p>“Alright, I’m done!”</p><p>Xie nianqing smiled.</p><p>Then, he turned to look at Xie nianjun. Xie nianjun smiled, turned around, and disappeared in a flash.</p><p>Next, the family gathered together and it was a happy and harmonious time.</p><p>Lu Ming stayed there for a few more months. In these few months, Lu Ming was completely relaxed and did not spend too much time on cultivation.</p><p>A few months later, they returned to the primordial realm and met up with Lu Yuntian, Li Ping, and the others. After some time, they arrived at two world city.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming planned to stay in two world city and cultivate while fighting against the alien races.</p><p>The days seemed to have become dull. Time passed quickly, and it had been twenty years.</p><p>After twenty years, Lu Ming had finally made another breakthrough. His cultivation level had risen to three stars great emperor.</p><p>However, the amount of resources used was also shocking.</p><p>This time, he used primordial chaos stones. Lu Ming had used up all 20000 primordial chaos stones in one go. As for the raw gemstones, Lu Ming only had 30% of them left.</p><p>“I’m afraid the remaining resources won’t be enough for me to break through to four star great emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly.</p><p>However, after breaking through to three star great emperor, the ruler’s power in his World Energy had become a bit denser, and his battle-power had undoubtedly become stronger.</p><p>However, his physical body had not broken through, and his Seven Gods mysterious skill was still at the early stage of the sixth level. It would take a long time for him to break through to the middle stage.</p><p>Hualala …</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming was chatting with Xie nianqing when he suddenly heard the sound of running water. The sound seemed to be coming from a distance.</p><p>And the sound was getting louder and louder, like the waves of a Big River.</p><p>“What’s that sound?”</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing found it very strange. They flew into the sky to watch.</p><p>As soon as they flew into the sky, they were all shocked, because people were flying in the sky from all corners of two world city. They looked in the direction outside two world city with puzzled expressions.</p><p>The voice came from outside two world city and spread throughout the entire city.</p><p>“Could it be the work of a foreign race?”</p><p>Someone asked doubtfully.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Many people flew toward the city walls of two world city.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
