Its body spiraled in the sky and its head had already extended into the depths of the firmament. When the Dragon eyes opened, it was as if two suns had suddenly appeared in the sky.</p><p>“Ancestral Dragon!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered, his eyes revealing his excitement.</p><p>The ancestral Dragon was said to be the Supreme Master of the heaven realm. Even dandan was full of respect when she mentioned the ancestral Dragon.</p><p>Back then, Lu Ming had obtained a drop of ancestral dragon blood and refined it in his body to improve his physical strength.</p><p>Now, this ancestral Dragon was obviously the real one.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>roar! the ancestral Dragon roared again. His body twisted and his powerful aura made many alien races pale.</p><p>In front of a Supreme powerhouse, ordinary heavenly Emperor realm cultivators would not be able to withstand a single blow.</p><p>reptile, your injuries haven’t healed yet. Do you think you’re my match? ”</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor said coldly. Although his body couldn’t compare to the ancestral Dragon’s, his aura wasn’t any weaker.</p><p>“It’s just a battle to the death!”</p><p>The ancestral Dragon spoke. His voice was like thunder, shaking the world.</p><p>“A Mantis trying to stop a chariot. When the sky is split open, none of you will live. You will all be annihilated!”</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor said coldly.</p><p>“We can only fight!”</p><p>This was the response of the ancestral Dragon.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Then, the ancestral Dragon reached out a claw and attacked the non-human divine ancestor.</p><p>The non-human’s body shone with boundless light. In the light, his body grew rapidly and became a million miles in size. He was no smaller than the ancestral Dragon.</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor sent out a palm that clashed with the ancestral Dragon. Heaven and earth exploded, and the scene was destructive.</p><p>“Set up the ten directional seal formation!”</p><p>The voice of the foreign divine ancestor rang out.</p><p>“Set up the formation!”</p><p>The king of the number one royal family roared. An array disc appeared in his hand, emitting an infinite amount of light.</p><p>Countless beings of the foreign races made strange hand seals and runes appeared on their bodies.</p><p>Countless runes were released from the bodies of the foreign races. With the king of the number one royal family as the core, they formed a large formation.</p><p>Endless runes started to gather, forming huge chains that wrapped around the ancestral Dragon.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The ancestral Dragon roared and wanted to retreat, but he was held back by the non-human divine ancestor.</p><p>The two of them fought intensely. In an instant, countless chains covered the entire sky and earth, shrouding the ancestral Dragon within.</p><p>The ancestral Dragon let out a long roar, causing the void to collapse. He struggled with all his might, trying to break free, but this ten directional seal formation was set up by the combined efforts of countless alien races.</p><p>There were countless great emperor realm and heavenly Emperor realm powerhouses. The power of the formation set up by so many experts was simply too shocking.</p><p>Even the ancestral Dragon couldn’t break free.</p><p>“Mo ke, do you think you can defeat me with this formation?”</p><p>The ancestral Dragon roared.</p><p>Mo ke was the name of the alien race’s divine ancestor.</p><p>I can’t do anything to you. I’ll trap you for an hour. After an hour, you won’t be able to turn the tables!</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor said coldly and then turned to the prison suppression field.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor didn’t waste any time. He attacked immediately. A huge palm hit the prison suppression world. At the same time, destructive light shot out from between his eyebrows and turned into nine combat swords, slashing at the prison suppression world.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The light shield of the prison suppression field started to shake again.</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor continued to attack. The light shield of the prison-guarding stele rippled, and the entire prison-guarding world was shaking even more violently than before.</p><p>It was obvious that the non-human divine ancestor hadn’t used his full power earlier, as if he had known that the ancestral Dragon would come.</p><p>Now that the ancestral Dragon was trapped by the ten directional seal formation, the non-human divine ancestor was going all out.</p><p>The earth of the prison suppression field was shaking violently. Mountains collapsed, rivers stopped flowing, and the ground collapsed. It was like the end of the world.</p><p>“What do we do? If this continues, we won’t be able to stop them sooner or later!”</p><p>senior ancestor Dragon is trapped. He will need an hour to get out. According to the current situation, the prison-suppressing formation can’t last an hour!</p><p>Some of the great beings from the prison suppression field were pale and anxious.</p><p>When the ancestral Dragon had appeared, they had thought that they were saved. However, the non-human divine ancestor had anticipated this and had set up a formation to stop the ancestral Dragon.</p><p>As long as the formation was broken, they would all die.</p><p>“What do we do?”</p><p>Everyone was extremely anxious. Many people’s gazes were on Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was the only one who could turn the tide.</p><p>if the fragments of the prison-guarding stele in his body, the soul of the prison-guarding stele, and the sub-steles are combined, the power of the prison-guarding formation will definitely increase greatly!</p><p>“But what about Saint ancestor bloodheart?”</p><p>if I kill him before the sacred ancestor bloodheart devours him, will the sacred ancestor bloodheart die as well? ”</p><p>Someone muttered and looked at Lu Ming with ill intentions.</p><p>“What did you say? Are you looking to die?”</p><p>shut up! Wu tai shouted coldly. In a flash, he appeared in front of Lu Ming. His eyes glowed coldly as he glared at the people who had spoken.</p><p>Qing Gang’s figure also moved and appeared beside Lu Ming.</p><p>If anyone dared to have any ideas about Lu Ming, he would attack violently.</p><p>It was not just the two of them. The people who had been rescued by Lu Ming from the eternal cage were all standing beside him, exuding a cold aura.</p><p>Their attitude had explained everything.</p><p>The faces of those who had spoken earlier paled.</p><p>all of you, shut up. Lu Ming is the Savior of our prison suppression field. Do you understand? ”</p><p>Elder Liu shouted coldly and then showed an apologetic expression to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled slightly. He was not angry.</p><p>It was normal for some people to have such thoughts at such a critical moment.</p><p>If sacrificing Lu Ming alone could save everyone, many people would have the same thought.</p><p>Heaven and earth were shaking more and more violently, and the attacks of the non-human divine ancestor were getting more and more violent.</p><p>He became a million miles tall, like a giant standing between the sky and the earth. He was like a Supreme God, bombarding the prison suppression field as if he was going to destroy the world.</p><p>A few minutes later!</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The prison suppression field was shaking. The light shield formed by the prison suppression formation was changing. It would collapse at any time.</p><p>It had only been a few minutes. It was impossible to hold them off for an hour.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Suddenly, a voice rang out, making everyone’s hearts beat wildly.</p><p>Because a crack had appeared on the prison suppression formation.</p><p>everyone, attack together! Set up a formation and block it together!</p><p>Elder Liu roared and charged forward.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>“I swear to fight to the death!”</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>In the prison suppression field, countless people were shouting. They rushed forward like a swarm of locusts and started to set up a formation in a huge open space.</p><p>There were countless overlords from the prison suppression field, from the peak invincible overlords to the void Emperor. The number was shocking.</p><p>So many people had set up a large formation. Their auras blended together and they attacked together.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>They struck out at the same time, and a huge stone tablet was formed. It flew through the light shield and hit the non-human Saint ancestor.</p><p>“A group of ants, overestimating their own abilities!”</p><p>The non-human divine ancestor’s cold voice rang out as he struck out with his palm, striking the giant stone tablet.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
