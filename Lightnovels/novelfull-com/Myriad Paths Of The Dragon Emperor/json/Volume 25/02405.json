He grabbed one of the alien heavenly emperors and tore him in half with all his might.</p><p>“Save me!”</p><p>The alien didn’t die and shouted in fear.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The other alien seized the opportunity and launched a fierce attack on Lu Ming. Lu Ming’s body trembled and he took a few steps back. He then threw the alien’s body away.</p><p>The foreign heavenly Emperor’s body fused together, and his face was pale.</p><p>A heavenly Emperor powerhouse would naturally not die so easily, but he was still frightened just now.</p><p>Lu Ming’s aura was too terrifying. His killing intent was as cold as a knife. If no one else helped him, he would really die in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>The two foreign heavenly emperors had ugly expressions. If this continued, they would really die Here.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At this moment, the tunnel started to shake violently, even more so than before.</p><p>Then, the crack grew bigger and bigger. Then, everyone saw two purple rays of light rush out of the crack.</p><p>The two rays of purple light faded, revealing two figures.</p><p>“My Lords!”</p><p>The two non-human heavenly emperors were overjoyed when they saw the two figures.</p><p>These two figures were the two Royal powerhouses of the non-human race.</p><p>“We’re really finished!”</p><p>Dandan shouted.</p><p>Originally, there were too many powerful beings of the foreign kinds, and they couldn’t resist at all. Now, there were two more, and they were two royal families of the foreign kinds.</p><p>From the expressions of the two foreign heavenly emperors, one could tell that they were extremely terrifying beings.</p><p>“A bunch of trash, get out of my way!”</p><p>One of the non-human Kings stepped forward. His purple hair danced in the wind, and his body glowed with purple light.</p><p>At the same time, he struck out with his palm.</p><p>A huge purple palm came crashing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>That kind of aura was simply earth-shattering, causing people’s faces to change.</p><p>unparalleled expert! This is an unparalleled expert!</p><p>Dandan couldn’t help but exclaim.</p><p>Today was the end. This non-human King was a peerless expert above the four-star heavenly Emperor level. His strength was even stronger than the previous peerless expert. He was extremely terrifying.</p><p>In addition, there was also a non-human royal family that had not made a move, but his strength was definitely terrifying.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not the least bit afraid of this move. Or rather, he did not know what fear was.</p><p>In his heart, there was only killing!</p><p>“Power, power, kill, kill…”</p><p>Lu Ming roared madly. His instinct made him constantly borrow the power of the third bloodline.</p><p>The surging energy gushed out from Lu Ming’s third Blood Meridian and surged into his body.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Cracks began to appear on Lu Ming’s body, and blood kept flowing out.</p><p>It was impossible for Lu Ming to borrow the third bloodline’s power endlessly because his physical strength was limited. If there was too much power, his physical body would explode.</p><p>He was able to use such a powerful force to suppress the celestial Thearch. It was all thanks to his powerful physical body. Otherwise, it would have been impossible.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming had already reached his limit.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming soared into the sky like a wild beast and threw a punch at the palm of the non-human King.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A deafening boom was heard. Lu Ming’s body trembled violently and he flew backward like a kite with a broken string. His body cracked and he coughed up blood.</p><p>The other party had shown mercy. It was obvious that the Royal non-human race did not want to kill Lu Ming. They wanted to capture Lu Ming alive for great use.</p><p>“You’re putting up a stubborn resistance!”</p><p>The non-human King said coldly. He stretched out his hand again and sent another palm toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming howled fearlessly and once again confronted his opponent. This time, Lu Ming was sent flying and his injuries were even more serious.</p><p>“What are you guys doing? Go and kill those people. A space-time spirit rat and a World Turtle, we can get rid of them!”</p><p>The non-human king who didn’t make a move ordered coldly.</p><p>The two foreign heavenly emperors ‘expressions changed, and they stepped out at the same time, charging toward dandan and the others.</p><p>As for the non-human royalty who didn’t make a move, he headed toward Earth One and Thunder one.</p><p>They wanted to end this battle once and for all.</p><p>At this moment…</p><p>Bzzzz…</p><p>in the distance, a bull’s roar came from the distance. The sound was shocking and carried a terrifying power.</p><p>The low-level non-human beings below the Emperor level were all blown apart by the sound.</p><p>Even the great emperor alien was struck by lightning. His body cracked and he spat out blood.</p><p>In an instant, countless alien races died on the spot.</p><p>However, the strange thing was that dandan and bubbles were completely fine.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, after being hit by the cry, his consciousness, which had been completely drowned by the murderous intent, actually showed a trace of clarity.</p><p>He could barely make out his current situation.</p><p>“This voice…”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>“Old bull, it’s that old bull. Hahaha …”</p><p>Dandan laughed crazily.</p><p>In the distance, a giant bull as tall as the sky stepped over. It seemed very slow, but it was actually astonishingly fast. In an instant, it had arrived in front of them.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The giant bull roared again, and the terrifying sound waves rushed toward the non-human King race and the non-human Celestial Emperor.</p><p>The expressions of the two ordinary foreign heavenly emperors changed drastically. They tried their best to block, but they were still sent flying and spat out large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>“The Titanos…”</p><p>The non-human king who attacked Lu Ming shouted in anger. His entire body glowed and he clapped his hands to resist the sound waves.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>A violent fluctuation was heard. The non-human King’s body trembled continuously and he actually retreated.</p><p>The Titan longhorn beetle. Yes, this giant beetle was the Titan longhorn beetle.</p><p>Lu Ming had never expected that the Titan longhorn beetle would dare to come to his aid at such a critical moment.</p><p>Wasn’t the Titan longhorn beetle guarding a forbidden area in the Azure continent? it had actually rushed here.</p><p>a heavily injured and sick bull. Do you think you can save them by coming here? stay here today!</p><p>The non-human Royal who didn’t make a move earlier spoke coldly. He took a step forward, and a terrifying aura burst out from his body. He was even stronger than the one who had attacked earlier.</p><p>“What if I’m included?”</p><p>A figure suddenly appeared beside the Titan longhorn beetle.</p><p>It was a middle-aged man. He was tall and thin, but he was handsome. His eyes were sharp and filled with vicissitudes of life.</p><p>However, an unfathomable aura emanated from his body.</p><p>“Nine lives, it’s you! Hahaha, you’re all here to save me, right? hahaha!”</p><p>Dandan laughed wildly.</p><p>interesting. Today, four of the top ten war beasts of the heaven realm have come. Let’s get rid of them together!</p><p>The non-human king who didn’t make a move earlier spoke coldly. His body glowed with purple light as he took a step forward and threw a punch at the tall, thin middle-aged man.</p><p>As for the other non-human King, he charged towards the Titan longhorn beetle.</p><p>An intense battle began.</p><p>“Go, quickly go!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming managed to regain a trace of his consciousness. He shouted at dandan and the rest, then leaped and killed the two ordinary celestial thearchs of the alien race.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
