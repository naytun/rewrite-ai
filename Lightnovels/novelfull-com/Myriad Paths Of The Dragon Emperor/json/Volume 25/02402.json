When activated by Earth One, its power was even more shocking.</p><p>This strike was like a huge star smashing out. If it hit the ground, the island would be shattered.</p><p>“A heaven Dao soldier, it’s the celestial Emperor!”</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The faces of the evil god race members changed as they retreated rapidly.</p><p>However, their speed was not as fast as the meteor hammer. The meteor hammer was about to hit them.</p><p>people of the primordial realm, how dare you kill our race’s powerhouses? you’re courting death!</p><p>At this moment, a loud roar came from the depths of the island. Then, a huge palm stretched out from the depths of the island.</p><p>The palm was covered in pitch-black scales that blocked out the sky and the sun. It collided with the meteor hammer.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>It was as if the end of the world had arrived. After an incomparably violent boom, the meteor hammer actually trembled and was struck back by this palm.</p><p>However, the palm was completely fine.</p><p>After exchanging a blow with the heaven Dao soldier, his palm did not show any signs of abnormality, not even a scale falling off.</p><p>The hand retracted, and a figure suddenly appeared in the sky.</p><p>This was an evil god tribe member, and his entire body was covered in black scales.</p><p>From the looks of it, he seemed like an ordinary member of the evil god race. However, his body size was very different from that of an ordinary member of the evil god race.</p><p>The ordinary members of the evil god race were all tall and burly. However, this evil god race member’s body was similar to that of an ordinary person’s, and it was well-proportioned and slender.</p><p>Apart from the scales all over his body and the third eye between his brows, he was no different from a human.</p><p>However, his aura was extremely terrifying and powerful.</p><p>“Not good, it’s a peerless expert!”</p><p>Earth one’s expression changed drastically as he shouted.</p><p>There was actually a peerless expert here. Only existences above the four-star heavenly Emperor level could be called peerless experts.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! the evil god tribe’s peerless powerhouse shouted coldly. He waved his hand, and his palm rapidly grew in size, pressing down on tu Yi. At the same time, a destructive light burst out from his third eye, turning into a destructive battle sword that slashed down on Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>Earth One erupted with all his strength and controlled the meteor hammer to strike.</p><p>As for Lei Yi, he opened his mouth and spat out a combat sword that was shining with lightning. It exuded a terrifying aura and attacked the evil god tribe.</p><p>This was Lei Yi’s heaven Dao soldier.</p><p>The primal Chaos Palace had left behind two heaven Dao soldiers. One was with Thunder one and the other with gold one.</p><p>BOOM! boom!</p><p>With two consecutive terrifying rumbles, Lei Yi and tu Yi were actually blocked and could not do anything to each other.</p><p>“Heaven Dao soldiers, two heaven Dao soldiers. Hahaha, my luck isn’t bad, they’re all mine!”</p><p>The evil god tribe’s peerless expert laughed and unleashed his full power as he charged toward Earth One and Thunder one.</p><p>Earth One and Thunder one also unleashed their full strength and engaged in a great battle with the other party. However, it was difficult to determine the victor in a short time. The two of them were entangled and unable to escape.</p><p>“Young master, you guys should leave quickly!”</p><p>Earth One roared.</p><p>This time, it was impossible for them to destroy the other party. Things had gone beyond their expectations.</p><p>The alien race had already torn a hole in the passage. Not only were there a large number of experts entering, but there was even a peerless expert.</p><p>This peerless expert had the cultivation of a four-star heavenly Emperor and was extremely powerful.</p><p>Earth One and Thunder one’s cultivation was at two-star Celestial Emperor. Even with the help of the heaven Dao soldiers, the two of them could only barely protect themselves when facing each other.</p><p>And this was when the other party didn’t have heaven Dao soldiers. If they did, they would be dead for sure.</p><p>The only thing they could do now was to stall the other party and let Lu Ming and the rest escape so that they could pass the news to the heaven realm.</p><p>“Earth One, Thunder one…”</p><p>Lu Ming roared.</p><p>let’s go, young master. We must leave. The news here must be spread. Don’t worry about us. We have our own ways to escape!</p><p>Leiyi also shouted.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth. He no longer hesitated and turned to leave.</p><p>However, at this moment, a large group of the evil god race had already surrounded them and were charging toward them with attacks.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were bloodshot and he kept sweeping his long spear.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Those who were swept by Lu Ming’s long spear exploded immediately.</p><p>No matter if they were true emperors or great emperors.</p><p>“Brat, die!”</p><p>An unusually burly member of the evil god race held a battle axe and exchanged a blow with Lu Ming.</p><p>A terrifying force gushed over. Lu Ming’s body trembled and he could not help but retreat.</p><p>Peak Emperor!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat!</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current combat strength, he could fight against a six star great emperor, but he was definitely no match for a peak great emperor.</p><p>In addition, dandan and bubbles had also encountered strong enemies.</p><p>Bubbles ‘cultivation had yet to break through to the great emperor realm. In such a battle, he would not be of much use. He stood on Lu Ming’s shoulder and assisted him.</p><p>On the other hand, dandan was surrounded by several peak great emperors.</p><p>However, dandan’s battle-power was extremely strong and she completely suppressed the peak emperors, forcing them to retreat.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>All of a sudden, dandan gave up on attacking. In a flash, she rushed toward Lu Ming and sent the evil god tribe member who was attacking Lu Ming flying with a single move. He spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Lu Ming, follow me. We’re going out!”</p><p>die! dandan shouted as he charged forward. Every time he attacked, it was like a world was being blasted out. Even peak emperors couldn’t stop him.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>A few peak great emperors were sent flying and spat out blood.</p><p>“Everyone, stop them! Don’t let them escape!”</p><p>The peerless expert of the evil god tribe shouted.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill them!”</p><p>A large group of evil god tribe members rushed over and attacked Lu Ming and the others without any regard for their lives.</p><p>“Spacetime!”</p><p>Bubbles ‘small hands kept waving, trying to seal off the spacetime and stop those foreign races.</p><p>It was a pity that bubbles ‘cultivation base was too weak. He could block those below great emperor, but he could not block those above great emperor, especially those advanced great emperors.</p><p>The other party struggled with all its might and broke free from the bubble’s spacetime power.</p><p>The peak great emperors ignored the bubbles ‘spacetime power and continued to attack Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>There were too many of them!</p><p>Although dandan’s combat strength was strong and she could crush experts of the same level, there were too many of them. She couldn’t take the continuous attacks.</p><p>At least ten peak great emperors were attacking dandan. Their path was blocked and it was difficult for them to get out.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At this moment, the vortex above the island let out a deafening roar. It seemed that someone was trying to break the passage and come here.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were anxious. If even more powerful evil god tribe members came, they would really be finished.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Dandan roared loudly and transformed into her true form, her attack power even stronger.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>One of the peak emperors from the evil god tribe was struck by dandan and was instantly annihilated.</p><p>However, at the same time, dozens of attacks fell on dandan.</p><p>These attacks were all from six star great emperors and even peak great emperors. No matter how strong dandan’s defense was, she couldn’t take it and was forced to retreat..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
