This level of power was the lowest level.</p><p>The second level was where there were six-star heavenly emperors or even peak seven-star heavenly emperors. Such a force was much stronger than the country of Fengming.</p><p>The third level had an invincible master.</p><p>What was an invincible master?</p><p>In the heaven realm, the primal Chaos Emperor and the undying Emperor were invincible.</p><p>They were half a step into the martial God Realm. They were invincible below the martial God Realm, and their strength was even stronger titan a peak heavenly Emperor. This was the invincible master.</p><p>There weren’t many of such forces in the yellow Springs world.</p><p>The fourth level, which was the strongest force, was the force with a martial God.</p><p>On the surface, there was only one force like this in the entire Yellow Springs world, which was the yellow Springs Empire, which occupied a large territory in the center of the yellow Springs world.</p><p>The yellow Springs Empire had a martial God, and there was more than one. He was truly Supreme and commanded the eight directions.</p><p>The Dragonman Empire was a second-tier power, and it had a peak heavenly Emperor. Its strength was many times stronger than the Fengming Kingdom. And Fengming country was a small country near the Dragon people Empire. Now, the foreign race had actually obtained great power in the Dragonman Empire.</p><p>right now, the foreign races have borrowed the strength of the Dragonman Empire to sweep through some of the surrounding small countries. Many of our heaven realm’s people have died at the hands of the foreign races. We’ve just escaped. I heard that the commander of the country of Fengming is called Lu Ming. I guessed that it was you, so I rushed over to take a look!</p><p>The celestial said.</p><p>“In that case, I’m afraid that the foreign tribes will soon send experts to Feng Ming!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>I’m afraid so. It’s said that Feng Ming country has a cursed land. There aren’t many small countries around the Dragon people Empire that have a cursed land. They’ll definitely be targeted by the other party!</p><p>The celestial said.</p><p>Lu Ming muttered to himself. After a while, he said, it’s too much of a pity to leave now. King Feng Ming has already agreed to let me enter the cursed land. Let’s wait a little longer. Once we enter the cursed land and take away the opportunities inside, we’ll leave immediately!</p><p>“Alright, let’s do that!”</p><p>Heavenly venerate six sages and the others nodded in agreement.</p><p>It would be a waste if he didn’t take the opportunity. Moreover, he couldn’t leave it for the alien race.</p><p>Heavenly venerate six sages and the others would be staying in the governor’s manor.</p><p>Fortunately, they did not have to wait long. Two days later, King Feng Ming sent someone to call for Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming brought six sages and the rest to the palace.</p><p>“Who are they?”</p><p>King Feng Ming looked curiously at six sacred heavenly venerate and the others.</p><p>they are my friends. Let’s enter the cursed land together. I don’t know if there are any dangers in the cursed land, but the more people we have, the higher our chances of success!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>that’s good too. However, we can’t change our share!</p><p>Said King Feng Ming.</p><p>“Naturally!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“Come with me!”</p><p>King Feng Ming said. Then, he led a group of people towards the northern side of the palace. After leaving the palace, they arrived at a dense forest.</p><p>After passing through the forest and a Canyon, they saw a tall mountain.</p><p>Of course, along the way, there were powerhouses standing guard.</p><p>the cursed land is right in front of us. You guys can go in. As for whether there’s any danger inside, I don’t know!</p><p>Said King Feng Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Then, they walked forward.</p><p>There was a stone door at the foot of the mountain in front of them. It was halfopen, and it was pitch-black inside.</p><p>Everyone slowed down and approached carefully.</p><p>They didn’t know if there was any danger in the cursed land, so they naturally didn’t dare to be careless.</p><p>Heavenly venerate sixth Saint, who had the highest cultivation base, walked in front as the group carefully entered the gate.</p><p>Behind the door was a passage, and it was so quiet that not a single sound could be heard.</p><p>The group advanced carefully. This passageway was very long, at least a few thousand meters. After passing through the passageway, they would arrive at a huge underground cave.</p><p>The cave was empty, with nothing inside.</p><p>There were some stone doors around the cave.</p><p>The group did not split up. They still gathered together and walked towards some stone doors.</p><p>Behind the first stone door was a secret room, but there was nothing inside.</p><p>The group came to the second stone door, which was also a secret room, but it was also empty.</p><p>Everyone looked at each other.</p><p>Could it be that this cursed land had already been visited by someone before the myriad tribulation, and everything inside had been swept clean?</p><p>The crowd was unwilling to give up and continued to search.</p><p>Behind some of the stone doors, there was a passage. After walking in, they saw secret rooms. However, these secret rooms were all empty.</p><p>Everyone looked disappointed. It seemed like they were really going to return empty-handed today.</p><p>However, they were really unwilling to leave just like that. They planned to turn this place upside down and search for themselves.</p><p>They continued to walk towards the stone doors that they had not searched.</p><p>eh? there’s a passage behind this. There’s no secret chamber!</p><p>Someone suddenly said.</p><p>As the group walked, they found a passage that led straight ahead.</p><p>The group followed this path and continued forward.</p><p>After walking for an unknown distance, the passage became wider, but everyone had no choice but to stop.</p><p>In front of him, there was a section of the wall and the ground that was filled with strange patterns that emitted a dim light.</p><p>When these lines were put together, they looked like a huge array.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>Heavenly venerate six sages reminded him before talcing out a great emperor weapon and controlling it to fly forward.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>When the Emperor-level weapon passed through the path, the patterns suddenly glowed and countless fine threads filled the path.</p><p>Some of these threads were snow-white, while some were crimson red.</p><p>They were like tiny sword Qi, emitting a cold and hot aura.</p><p>Yes, ice-cold and heat coexisted.</p><p>The Emperor weapon was enveloped by the threads and kept making earpiercing sounds.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>In just a few breaths, the Emperor weapon was covered in cracks before it exploded and turned into dust that scattered in the air.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss…</p><p>A few gasps could be heard.</p><p>This was indeed a great formation, and its power was astonishing. A great emperor weapon would turn into powder in a few breaths ‘time. Not even a residue was left.</p><p>If people went in, they would be dead.</p><p>Those below the heavenly Emperor realm turned pale. They knew that they couldn’t go in and would stop here.</p><p>“I’ll try!”</p><p>A burly man stepped out and walked forward.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
