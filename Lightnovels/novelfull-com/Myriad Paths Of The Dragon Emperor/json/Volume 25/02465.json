The cursed land was the place they were looking for.</p><p>The people of netherworld mountain couldn’t enter, because they had been</p><p>cursed for generations. However, outsiders could enter.</p><p>There might be opportunities in there.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming was overjoyed to find out that there was such a cursed land in Feng Ming country. It was in the capital of Feng Ming country.</p><p>“It seems that I made the right choice by choosing to be the commander’s</p><p>guard!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Lu Ming stayed at the Xu family for two days. Under Xu Rong’s reluctant gaze,</p><p>he bade them farewell.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming walked towards the great Ming city’s governor’s manor. The commander who was guarding this place was called Yi Yang. It could be said that he was the most powerful person in the great Ming city. He ruled dozens of nearby cities and had millions of troops.</p><p>The governor’s manor was located at the center of the great Ming city.</p><p>Not long after, a vast mansion appeared before Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>At the gate of the mansion, there was a group of big men in iron armor standing guard.</p><p>“Who’s there? Stop!”</p><p>Lu Ming was stopped the moment he arrived.</p><p>“I want to see commander Yi Yang!”</p><p>The guard token appeared in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>“The commander’s Guard Command token!</p><p>The Guard’s expression changed, then he smiled and said, ” so you have a guard token. Sir, please wait a moment. We’ll report this to the commander!</p><p>Since Lu Ming had a guard token, it meant that he had defeated a guard and was very likely to inherit that Guard’s position. In that case, his status would be far above theirs. Naturally, they did not dare to offend Lu Ming.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He kept the guard token and waited quietly.</p><p>After a long while, the guard came out and reported, ” “The commander wants</p><p>to see you. Please follow me!”</p><p>Then, he turned around and walked inside.</p><p>Lu Ming followed him into the commander’s residence. They passed through several corridors and courtyards before they arrived at a large hall.</p><p>At the entrance of the hall, the burly man who was guarding the door did not dare to enter. He gestured for Lu Ming to enter while he himself retreated.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped into the hall and realized that it was already full of people.</p><p>At the head of the table sat a middle-aged man with a sinister face. His eyes were long and narrow, and when he opened and closed them, he gave off a cold and gloomy feeling.</p><p>However, what attracted Lu Ming’s attention the most was the lower half of the person’s body.</p><p>The lower half of this person’s body was a snake’s tail.</p><p>It was a serpent-man, and the aura on his body was extremely shocking.</p><p>“Heavenly Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming could immediately sense that this person’s cultivation was at the celestial Emperor, which was the void transformation stage of the netherworld.</p><p>On both sides of the hall, there were more than ten people sitting.</p><p>There were men and women, old and middle-aged. All of them had powerful</p><p>auras and were peak emperors.</p><p>“This must be the commander and his guards!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He then stepped forward and cupped his</p><p>fists.’T’m lu Ming. Greetings, commander!”</p><p>“You killed mo you?”</p><p>Yi Yang asked from the seat of honor.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“Take out your guard token and let me take a look!</p><p>Yi Yang said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He waved his hand and the guard token appeared in his hand.</p><p>“Lord Commander, may I ask if I can inherit the position of protector?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>hehehe, what a joke. You want to inherit the position of protector? ”</p><p>The one who spoke was not commander Yi Yang, but a middle-aged man sitting on the left. He had a pair of bull horns and eyes as big as copper bells.</p><p>According to the rules, I can inherit mo you’s position after killing him. Why can’t I inherit the position of a guard? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>ridiculous. I received news that you attacked mo you from behind. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have been his match. Such a despicable person wants to inherit the position of guard. It’s ridiculous. Now you dare to come here. Well, today I’ll avenge mo you!</p><p>The bull-headed man said coldly. He stepped forward and his powerful aura</p><p>pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>This bull-headed man was named Bleu. He had a very good relationship with mo you. He was also the strongest among the 18 guards under Yi Yang.</p><p>He had received news that mo you had been killed by Lu Ming’s sneak attack from behind. He was furious and was about to avenge mo you. He did not expect Lu Ming to come to his door.</p><p>Yi Yang sat at the head of the table with a sneer on the corner of his mouth, but he didn’t stop them.</p><p>He had also received the news that mo you had been stabbed to death by Lu</p><p>Ming from behind.</p><p>He also wanted to see if Lu Ming had the ability. If he did not, Bleu would have killed him for nothing.</p><p>“I’m afraid you’re a bit lacking!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast a casual glance at Bleu.</p><p>Lu Ming didn’t care about a peak great emperor, no matter how strong he was. you’ re a despicable man who only knows how to sneak attack me from behind. How dare you be so arrogant? die! Whirlwind kill!</p><p>A wide battleaxe appeared in Bleu’s hands. He raised the battleaxe and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>In the process of charging towards Lu Ming, Bleu’s entire body began to spin rapidly, bringing along his battle axe. Like a whirlwind, he swept towards Lu Ming with astonishing power.</p><p>“Whirlwind kill, it’s whirlwind kill! Big brother Bleu has used a killing move from the start!”</p><p>“That kid is finished. Big brother Bleu has used his killing move. Not many people at the profound void martial stage can fight against him. That kid is dead for sure. He will be ground into mincemeat!”</p><p>The other guards sneered coldly, as if they were watching a show.</p><p>They seemed to have already seen the scene of Lu Ming being strangled to death.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming made his move. He took a step forward and threw a punch. The entire Hall rumbled.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Lu Ming’s fist collided with Bleu’s battleaxe, creating a loud boom. Bleu’s battleaxe was then sent flying far away.</p><p>Then, a shrill cry was heard. Bleu’s burly body was crushed by Lu Ming’s fist force and flew far away. He fell heavily on the ground and spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>With just one move, Bleu had been severely injured.</p><p>In the hall, gasps could be heard.</p><p>The guards widened their eyes in disbelief.</p><p>Bleu was the strongest among them. However, he was defeated by Lu Ming in one move after he had used his killing move.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was shocking.</p><p>They understood that Lu Ming did not need a sneak attack to kill mo you. He could easily kill mo you in a head-on battle.</p><p>“Just this little bit of battle power? I thought he would be very strong, how disappointing!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and cast a disdainful glance at Bleu.</p><p>just now, he had shown mercy for Yi Yang’s sake. Otherwise, with one punch, Bleu would have been reduced to nothing.</p><p>Bleu was so angry that he spat out two more mouthfuls of blood. He was so embarrassed he wanted to die.</p><p>“Hahaha, good, good. You’re Lu Ming, right? from now on, you’ll be my guard, my first guard!”</p><p>On the seat of honor, Yi Yang laughed out loud, his eyes revealing his excitement.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
