It was emitting powerful fluctuations.</p><p>Although it was still a lot weaker than when he was at his peak, it was still very shocking.</p><p>haha, this blood-red true dragon is actually useful for the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron. More of it, the more the better!</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily in his heart.</p><p>He had been quite depressed because of these blood-red true dragons, but now he couldn’t wait for more to come.</p><p>With a thought, Lu Ming put away the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron and continued to move forward.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>Dragon roars could be heard continuously. As Lu Ming went deeper, blood-red true dragons kept appearing. Their numbers increased and their cultivation level grew stronger.</p><p>Behind them, there was actually a five-star heavenly Emperor.</p><p>However, when Lu Ming summoned the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, it immediately devoured the blood-red true dragons.</p><p>If one didn’t work, he would summon two.</p><p>The path was very long. Lu Ming walked for thousands of miles before he reached the end.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, several Divine Nine-Dragon cauldrons had already been awakened.</p><p>At the end of the road was a huge wasteland, and in the center of the wasteland was a huge mountain.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>Dragon roars reverberated through the world.</p><p>“So many…”</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p><p>He saw many blood-red true dragons swimming in the wilderness.</p><p>At a glance, one could not tell how many there were.</p><p>Their auras varied in strength. Some of them were one-star heavenly emperors, while some of them were even six-star heavenly emperors.</p><p>Lu Ming was not shocked. Instead, he was happy.</p><p>In Lu Ming’s eyes, all these blood-red true dragons were treasures.</p><p>These blood-red true dragons were simply killing stars to others.</p><p>For example, to the foreign races, they were terrifying killing stars.</p><p>The strongest of the foreign kinds was only a six-star heavenly Emperor. If they rushed here, they would probably die.</p><p>no wonder there are no foreign races on the right side. It’s so dangerous. Hahaha!</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming burst out laughing.</p><p>In Lu Ming’s eyes, these true dragons were all tonics, tonics for the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>If the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron was fully awakened, Lu Ming would definitely be able to unleash its full power with his current cultivation.</p><p>When the blood-red true dragons saw Lu Ming, they roared and pounced toward him.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and rushed over as well. The moment he rushed out, a huge cauldron flew out from his brow.</p><p>A total of Nine Cauldrons floated in the air, emitting a dazzling light. Then, they condensed mto the figure of Nine Dragons. They opened their mouths and burst out with a powerful devouring power.</p><p>The devouring power enveloped those blood-red true dragons. Those below the six-star heavenly Emperor level had no power to fight back at all. They directly turned into blood-red light and flew into the mouths of the nine Dragons, turning into energy to activate the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>The nine Divine Nine-Dragon cauldrons glowed, and their auras became stronger and stronger. The Dragon-shaped carvings on them seemed to come alive.</p><p>Soon, the blood-colored true dragons in this area were all devoured. Lu Ming immediately shifted his focus to devouring the blood-colored true dragons in other areas.</p><p>If the few alien races knew that Lu Ming had such a great time in this place, they would probably die of anger.</p><p>Lu Ming kept running and devouring the blood-colored true dragons. In just a few hours, he had devoured more than half of the blood-colored true dragons.</p><p>The reason why it took him a few hours was that the blood-red true dragons, which were equivalent to six-star heavenly Emperor realm experts, could still resist and were relatively difficult to deal with.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was about to continue controlling the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron to devour the blood-red true dragon, the mountain in the middle of the wilderness suddenly shook.</p><p>Then, it emitted a bright blood-red light.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Suddenly, a Dragon’s Roar came from the mountain, shaking the earth.</p><p>there are true dragons in this mountain too. Wait, this mountain can’t be a huge tomb, a true Dragon’s tomb!</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but guess.</p><p>And the more he looked, the more he looked like it.</p><p>It was very likely that an extremely powerful true dragon was buried in this mountain. Many years after its death, the Dragon Soul spread out and turned into many blood-red true dragons.</p><p>This was highly possible!</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron was resurrected after devouring such a Dragon Soul.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Dragon’s Roar from the mountain became louder and louder. Then, it emitted a piercing blood-red light. A huge blood-red true dragon rushed out of the mountain, emitting a powerful and shocking aura.</p><p>peak seven-star heavenly Emperor!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>This blood -red true Dragon’s aura had already reached the peak of the heavenly Emperor realm. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>I don’t know how many years it has been since its death, but its remaining Dragon Soul has already reached the peak of the celestial Emperor realm. This true dragon couldn’t have been a powerful existence at the martial God Realm when it was alive, could it? ”</p><p>Lu Ming guessed and was secretly shocked.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, the nine Dragons also roared, and the nine Divine Nine- Dragon cauldrons emitted a brilliant light.</p><p>The nine illusory Dragons pounced directly at the blood-red true dragon at the peak of the heavenly Emperor realm. The blood-red true dragon also pounced at the nine illusory Dragons. The two huge Dragons intertwined in the air and fought fiercely.</p><p>A vast Dragon might spread in all directions. The other blood-red true dragons lay on the ground and didn’t dare to move.</p><p>The two giant Dragons were locked in a fierce battle.</p><p>It wasn’t that the combat strength of the nine Dragon shadows was so strong that they could be compared to a peak heavenly Emperor. It wasn’t like that.</p><p>However, the nine Dragons seemed to be born to restrain their opponents, or rather, to restrain the Dragon Souls.</p><p>That was why the two of them were locked in a fierce battle.</p><p>This battle was a long and fierce battle.</p><p>This was because once the blood-red true dragon was destroyed, it would reform.</p><p>However, every time the other party was defeated, the nine Dragons would take the opportunity to devour some of the other party’s Dragon Souls. However, there was an endless supply of Dragon Souls coming in from the mountain. ’ Therefore, the blood-red true dragon was always in its peak state as it fought with the nine Dragons.</p><p>This battle lasted for a full month.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He might as well cultivate at the side.</p><p>However, after a month of fighting, the nine Dragons finally gained the upper hand.</p><p>That was because there was finally no more Dragon Soul to replenish the mountain. Without any replenishment, every time the other party was defeated by the nine Dragons and devoured a part of it, he would become weaker and weaker.</p><p>In the end, the true dragon was defeated by the nine Dragons. It turned into wisps of light and was completely devoured by the nine Dragons.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>After devouring the true dragon, the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron shook violently. It was dazzling, and its aura reached its peak.</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron had completely recovered.</p><p>Lu Ming could control it with a single thought.</p><p>“What a terrifying power!”</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron. He was overjoyed when he felt the power emanating from it.</p><p>He felt that if he controlled the nine Divine Nine-Dragon cauldrons at the same time, he might be able to burst out the power of a peak heavenly Emperor.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. This meant that with the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, he could fight a peak heavenly Emperor.</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron to continue devouring the remaining blood-red true dragons.</p><p>Not long after, the blood-red true dragons on the wilderness were all devoured by the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron. Not a single one was left.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
