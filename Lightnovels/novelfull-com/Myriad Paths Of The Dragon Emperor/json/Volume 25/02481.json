I’ll kill you now!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Country Master Feng Ming made his move. A bright sword light slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Monarch Feng Ming had a cultivation base at the fourth level void transformation stage. In the heaven realm, he was equivalent to a peerless expert at the four-star heavenly Emperor stage. His battle prowess was much stronger than a three-star heavenly Emperor.</p><p>The sword gleam was extremely sharp and it neared Lu Ming in an instant.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming immediately threw a punch at an astonishing speed, accurately hitting the blade of Feng Ming’s sword. The combat sword in Feng Ming’s hand trembled continuously, and his body shook violently as well. He was forced to retreat dozens of steps before he could stabilize himself.</p><p>“You… Your battle power, how did you …?”</p><p>King Feng Ming was extremely shocked.</p><p>In the previous move, he felt that Lu Ming’s strength had completely surpassed his.</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>A few months ago, he had seen Lu Ming and Rama fight. Back then, Lu Ming was stronger than Rama, but not by much.</p><p>He was confident that he could take down or even kill Lu Ming.</p><p>He did not expect that in just a few months, Lu Ming’s ability had surpassed him.</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>One must know that at their level of cultivation, it was extremely difficult to improve even a little bit. It would take a long time, so how could it be improved in a few months?</p><p>the cursed land. He must have obtained a Supreme opportunity in the cursed land. That’s why his combat strength has increased so much!</p><p>King Feng Ming thought to himself.</p><p>kill him! We must kill him and take his fortune!</p><p>King Feng Ming roared in his heart. The original battle sword in his hand disappeared and was replaced by a black battle sword.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Battle Sword shook, and the sword Qi soared to the sky.</p><p>“This is… A heaven Dao soldier!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>They weren’t exactly heaven Dao soldiers either, as their weapons didn’t contain the power of the heaven Dao. However, their grade was equivalent to that of a heaven Dao soldier.</p><p>As the ruler of a country and with a cultivation at the fourth level void transformation stage, it was normal for King Feng Ming to have a weapon that was equivalent to a heaven Dao soldier.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>King Feng Ming moved again and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>As for the other foreign races, they didn’t make a move. With King Feng Ming leading the way, they were happy to sit back and enjoy the fruits of his labor.</p><p>They blocked the way in all directions to prevent Lu Ming and the rest from escaping.</p><p>The great desolation spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hands. His body emitted a purple-gold light and he swept the spear out.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming used all his strength.</p><p>The power of his physical body, the power of a ruler, and the power of the great desolation spear.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two of them collided once again.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Battle Sword in King Feng Ming’s hand trembled madly as a terrifying power charged towards King Feng Ming.</p><p>King Feng Ming immediately spat out a large mouthful of blood as his body was sent flying.</p><p>His eyes were wide open in disbelief.</p><p>He had already used all his strength, but he was still vulnerable in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s aura was like a rainbow. His muscles trembled and his body burst out, charging towards King Feng Ming at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>The people inside netherworld mountain were stronger than those outside.</p><p>The strength of country ruler Feng Ming was also slightly stronger than the ordinary four star heavenly Emperor outside.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming had cultivated the seven Gods mysterious technique to the middle of the sixth stage. He could suppress an ordinary four- star heavenly Emperor with his physical strength alone.</p><p>Therefore, he was on par with King Feng Ming in terms of physical strength.</p><p>King Feng Ming had a combat sword that was equivalent to a heaven Dao soldier, while Lu Ming had the great desolation spear. The two of them were equal.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had the power of the path of domination. Once he erupted, he completely crushed King Feng Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The great desolation spear trembled and became incomparably huge as it struck towards country ruler Feng Ming.</p><p>Country ruler Feng Ming turned pale with fright as he raised his battle sword to block.</p><p>The great desolation spear struck the Battle Sword of country ruler Feng Ming heavily.</p><p>The terrifying power caused country ruler Feng Ming’s arm to explode. His combat sword flew out of his hand and flew out.</p><p>Lu Ming used his ruler’s power and put away his opponent’s combat sword.</p><p>As for country ruler Feng Ming’s body, he was like a meteorite as he crashed into the ground.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The earth trembled as King Feng Ming smashed a huge hole in the ground. He spat out blood continuously.</p><p>Everyone around them was dumbfounded.</p><p>The powerful country ruler Feng Ming could not even withstand a single blow from Lu Ming.</p><p>“Not good, let’s join forces, let’s join forces and kill him!”</p><p>One of the alien races roared.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>The other alien races also roared and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>There were a total of three four star heavenly emperors. The others were three star heavenly emperors, two star heavenly emperors, and one star heavenly emperors.</p><p>A total of nine alien races charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>From all directions, a series of attacks were blasted toward Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not take it head-on. Instead, he turned into a stream of light and fell to the ground. His entire person was like a long spear, stabbing towards King Feng Ming.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>King Feng Ming roared. However, he was severely injured. Even if he wanted to Dodge, he couldn’t.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s footsteps landed heavily on country ruler Feng Ming’s body. His entire body exploded and turned into ashes under the terrifying and violent power.</p><p>Only a storage ring flew out and was caught by Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming stomped heavily on the ground. The ground shook and a huge pit was blasted out. It was covered with cracks that looked like cobwebs.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body soared into the sky and he thrust the great desolation spear.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Rays of spear radiance pierced through the heavens and earth, piercing towards the foreign kinds.</p><p>The one-star, two-star, and even three-star heavenly emperors couldn’t resist at all. They were pierced through by the spear radiance and died in the air.</p><p>Only the three four-star heavenly emperors could block it. However, their bodies shook violently and they were sent flying by Lu Ming.</p><p>Individually, these three four star heavenly emperors were not as strong as King Feng Ming.</p><p>this is bad. Let’s go. We’ll ask a stronger person to kill Lu Ming!</p><p>One of the foreign beings revealed a look of horror and turned to run.</p><p>The other two foreign kinds ran even faster than him.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was not something they could match. If they did not run, they would die.</p><p>The three of them ran in three different directions.</p><p>Even if Lu Ming were to chase, he could only chase one person.</p><p>“You want to leave?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. The purple-gold light on his body became even more dazzling.</p><p>“My Lord!”</p><p>Lu Ming murmured. The way of domination melded with heaven and earth. It instantly took effect on the three alien races, wanting to dominate them.</p><p>The three demonic humans froze.</p><p>This stiffness was enough.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming became one with the spear and turned into a purple-gold spear gleam. It pierced through the void and stabbed at one of the alien races.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The alien was killed by Lu Ming in the air.</p><p>At this time, the other two demonic humans had already reacted and were extremely shocked.</p><p>Just now, they had felt a powerful force acting on them from the dark, causing their bodies to freeze.</p><p>“Run, run, run!”</p><p>The two demonic humans were terrified and started to run away.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
