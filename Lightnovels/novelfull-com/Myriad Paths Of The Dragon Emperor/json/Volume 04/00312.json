The reason why he didn’t make a sneak attack was because of it.</p><p>“Old man, you’re the one who’s going to die. Golden Eye, go!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted in a low voice. The Golden-eyed blood corpse roared and pounced at the old man.</p><p>Chi Chi!</p><p>At that moment, two figures appeared behind Lu Ming and Qiu Yue. The moment they appeared, they transformed into two thin, sharp sword lights that shot toward Lu Ming and Qiu Yue.</p><p>The speed was so fast that it was shocking. The sword light was sharp and invincible.</p><p>The two people who had launched the sneak attack were at the peak of the 6th level of the martial ancestor realm. Their auras were similar, and when they joined forces, their power multiplied.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a furious roar. He pulled Qiu Yue and six ancient shields appeared in front of him.</p><p>The six shields were stacked together in front of him.</p><p>Pfft! Puu!</p><p>It was as if leather had been pierced. The sword lights of the two people who had ambushed them were too sharp. The six shields were pierced one after another.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had won himself some time. The long spear turned into two spearlights and thrust forward.</p><p>Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!</p><p>The tip of the spear and the tip of the sword collided.</p><p>Lu Ming felt waves of extremely sharp sword aura surging toward him. The Wind and Fire Force on the tip of the spear was almost scattered.</p><p>Lu Ming pulled Qiu Yue and retreated at full speed.</p><p>The two people who had ambushed him were also blocked and retreated.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming could finally see the two figures clearly.</p><p>These two people looked almost exactly the same. They were short like monkeys and were about forty years old.</p><p>damn it, this person is so young, but he can actually block one of our attacks. He’s too terrifying. We can’t let him Live!</p><p>The two short men growled in a low voice. They were extremely shocked.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Chi Chi Chi</p><p>The two of them turned into two streaks of sword radiance and charged toward Lu Ming and Qiu Yue. They were as fast as lightning and were difficult to catch with the naked eye.</p><p>“Ten thousand miles of ice!”</p><p>Qiu Yue shouted and her second bloodline appeared. With a wave of her hand, the temperature in front of her dropped sharply. A large amount of frost appeared out of thin air, as if even the air had frozen.</p><p>Great ice formation!</p><p>Lu Ming could tell that the force of ice that Qiu Yue had comprehended had reached the major success stage and was extremely powerful.</p><p>The two short men’s bodies seemed to be frozen as well, and their speed was greatly reduced.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>The two short men roared.</p><p>“Haha, good!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily and struck out with both palms.</p><p>In the sky, two huge beast claws condensed and smashed toward the two short men.</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming had already cultivated the three Palms to the fifth stage. Its power was close to the power of an earth level high level martial arts technique and it was extremely powerful.</p><p>As long as Lu Ming comprehended the final heavenly path palm, its power would be infinitely close to that of a heaven-level martial arts technique. It would be extremely terrifying.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two beast claws pressed down like mountains.</p><p>The two short men slashed out sword Qi to block the beast’s palm.</p><p>With two loud bangs, the two of them trembled and quickly retreated.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming charged over directly. His long spear was like a dragon, and the Spear’s radiance tore through the air, blasting at the two short men continuously.</p><p>Behind them, Qiu Yue waved her hands, and crescent-shaped ice wheels appeared one after another, slashing at the two short men.</p><p>It had to be said that the two short men were extremely powerful. Their genuine Qi was strong, condensed, and sharp.</p><p>Moreover, their cultivations had reached the peak of the martial ancestor realm Level 6. If the two of them worked together, they could fight against a normal martial ancestor realm Level 7.</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue joined forces, but they could only end up in a draw.</p><p>“Refine, refine!”</p><p>Lu Ming put all his effort into refining the blood essence in his body.</p><p>Most of the blood essence in his body came from a 7th level martial arts Grandmaster. There were also 5th level martial arts Grandmaster and a large number of other martial arts grandmasters.</p><p>At this moment, it was constantly transforming into the energy of the nine Dragons bloodline and transforming into Lu Ming’s essential Qi.</p><p>Lu Ming’s essential Qi continued to increase.</p><p>In a moment, he was at the peak of the second level of martial ancestor realm.</p><p>However, it did not stop there. It began to charge towards the third level of the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>It was not the first time for Lu Ming to have a breakthrough while fighting. He was very familiar with the process. Of course, this was because of the wonder of the nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>The two short men became more and more frightened as they fought.</p><p>First of all, Qiu Yue’s cold Qi was too shocking. Her cultivation was obviously much lower than theirs, but the cold Qi was so terrifying that it seemed to be able to freeze everything. They felt that the genuine Qi in their bodies was about to be frozen, and their speed slowed down.</p><p>Of course, the most terrifying one was Lu Ming. His attacks were violent and his strength was shocking. Every attack could destroy a mountain. Every attack forced them to go all out. Moreover, Lu Ming did not seem tired at all. The more he fought, the more courageous he became.</p><p>The two of them had the intention to retreat.</p><p>“Let’s go. We should leave first. These two are too terrifying. Let’s get stronger experts to kill them.”</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The two of them slashed a few times and planned to retreat.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he sneered, ” “Leave? It’s too late to leave now!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The aura on Lu Ming’s body was like a volcanic eruption. It actually soared wildly.</p><p>Third level of Wu Zong!</p><p>Just now, his cultivation had successfully broken through.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength soared once again after he broke through to the third level of the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>not good! He actually broke through? ”</p><p>A short man cried out in disbelief.</p><p>“Monster, this is a monster, retreat, quickly retreat!”</p><p>The other man shouted crazily as he retreated.</p><p>However, it was too late.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was like lightning. He appeared not far away from him in an instant and thrust his spear.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>It was as if the air had been pierced through. The Spear’s radiance crossed a distance of a hundred meters in an instant, penetrating everything.</p><p>The short man didn’t even have time to react before the spear ray pierced through his heart.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming held the spear in his hand and threw it out.</p><p>A 200-meter-long spear light streaked across the sky and shot toward the short man.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The short man cried out in fear and slashed out a shocking sword light.</p><p>However, it was useless. The spear radiance swept past and the sword radiance collapsed. The spear radiance’s momentum did not stop as it struck the short man’s body.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The short man cried out in pain. It was unknown how many bones in his body had been broken. His body was sent flying like a cannonball, and blood spurted out of his body.</p><p>Although he didn’t die, he was almost dead.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Qiu Yue waved out a moon-shaped ice wheel, which rushed over the short man’s body and cut him in two.</p><p>Lu Ming rushed over and devoured their blood essence.</p><p>The blood essence of two martial arts grandmasters at the peak of the sixth level was definitely a great supplement.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>On the other side, the Golden Eye blood was fearless and had completely suppressed the opponent.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming had killed the two short men, the old man was in disbelief.</p><p>Although the two short men were no match for him, they were no small matter. He thought that they would be more than enough to kill Lu Ming and Qiu Yue. He never expected that they would be killed by Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>The old man was shocked.</p><p>“It’s your turn.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were like lightning. He moved and thrust his spear at the old man.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The old man slashed out with his sword, clashing with the long spear. However, he was forced back by a powerful force.</p><p>“How can he be so strong?”</p><p>The old man was shocked and turned to run.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
