With a move of his hand, his essential Qi condensed into a long spear and he directly whipped it at his opponent.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>As the long spear swept across, the sword light crumbled like tofu. The Spear’s body heavily struck the expert from the nether demon Palace.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In an instant, the man’s eyes popped out. He didn’t even have time to scream before his entire body exploded.</p><p>Flesh, blood, bones, and bones were all stimulated by the energy and pierced through the experts of the nether demon Palace.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>The people from the nether demon Palace were first shocked, then chaos ensued.</p><p>The true Qi in his body erupted, blocking the flesh and bone armor that was piercing through!</p><p>Pfft! Puu!</p><p>It was as if bullets had hit their bodies. Instantly, more than a dozen disciples of the nether demon Palace with weaker cultivations had bloody holes in their bodies. They fell to the ground and screamed in pain.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>You feishi let out a roar of disbelief.</p><p>In one move, he had instantly killed a martial arts Grandmaster 7-dan peak warrior of the third stage, and the remaining energy could seriously injure more than a dozen experts. How was this possible? even he couldn’t do it.</p><p>I have to thank you for this. With the help of the three-colored primordial fire, I had a fortuitous encounter and my cultivation level skyrocketed!</p><p>Lu Ming looked at you feishi and smiled faintly.</p><p>“F * ck, no, that’s impossible!”</p><p>You feishi roared, finding it hard to accept.</p><p>He had wanted to kill Lu Ming, but in the end, he had helped Lu Ming and allowed him to have a fortuitous encounter.</p><p>How could there be such a thing in the world? Thinking of this, he was so depressed that he wanted to go crazy.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>His figure moved and he took a step forward.</p><p>Nine Dragons heaven stomping steps!</p><p>An unimaginable power erupted from Lu Ming’s feet.</p><p>“Block it! Block it!”</p><p>You feishi roared and joined forces with the remaining five or six people to resist with all their might.</p><p>However, under Lu Ming’s attack, everything was in vain.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Other than you feishi, the other disciples of the you mo Palace screamed as their bodies exploded, including those who were injured.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The nine Dragon bloodline flew out and devoured everyone’s blood essence.</p><p>You feishi’s situation was not much better. Under Lu Ming’s attack, many of his bones were broken and he lay on the ground like mud.</p><p>“Ah, how could it be?”</p><p>You feishi roared, unable to bear it.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually obtained a fortuitous encounter because of him and killed him instead. This was simply ridiculous.</p><p>He really wanted to roar at the sky and ask why the heavens were treating him like this.</p><p>“What is it called? You can be on your way!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He flicked his finger and a ray of spear radiance flew out, piercing you feishi’s throat.</p><p>Lu Ming was now in the early stage of the eighth level martial arts Grandmaster realm, close to the fifth level. Killing you feishi and the others was as easy as cutting grass.</p><p>After killing you feishi, he devoured his blood essence and kept the storage ring of the disciple of the nether demon Palace.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming scanned his surroundings.</p><p>There were all kinds of spiritual herbs in the surrounding herbal field. However, they were all level one, level two, level three, and the highest was level four. Although there were some very rare spiritual herbs, they were too low-level. To Lu Ming, they were not of much use.</p><p>why aren’t there any Level 5 spiritual herbs? ”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and then took out the storage ring of the nether flying stone. He was overjoyed when he took a look.</p><p>In you feishi’s storage ring, there were more than a dozen Level 5 spiritual herbs that gave off a strong medicinal fragrance.</p><p>It was not that there were no level 5 spirit herbs here, but they had already been dug away by you feishi and the others.</p><p>He took another look at the low-level spiritual herbs. Then, Lu Ming took action and picked some level four spiritual herbs.</p><p>As for the low-level spiritual herbs, Lu Ming could not be bothered to take action. Even if there were some that were rarer in the outside world, Lu Ming was not an Alchemist and did not know how to plant herbs. He reckoned that they would be dead after digging them out for a period of time.</p><p>After picking the Level 4 spiritual herbs, Lu Ming moved and moved forward.</p><p>At the end of the herbal field, there was a passageway. Lu Ming dashed into the passageway and disappeared.</p><p>…</p><p>At this moment, there was a huge Bronze Palace in the depths of the ruins.</p><p>The bronze Palace’s Gate was tightly shut. There were four small statues at the gate. They were the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermillion Bird, and black Tortoise.</p><p>It was about a meter tall.</p><p>At this moment, there were more than a hundred people gathered in front of the bronze statue.</p><p>Coldflow wood, ye Tiannan, wuhui, and the others were all among them.</p><p>However, at this moment, they were in a sorry state, especially Coldflow wood, ye Tiannan, and the others. They were injured all over and their breathing was shallow.</p><p>As for the three forces, they originally had more than 100 people, but now they only had a few dozen people left.</p><p>The other people present were all disciples of the nether demon Palace in black robes.</p><p>They surrounded Coldflow wood and the rest.</p><p>You Feiyu, we have given you the key to this relic. Now, can you let us go? ”</p><p>Coldflow wood looked at the leader of the nether demon Palace.</p><p>This person was the most powerful person in the nether demon Palace, you Feiyu.</p><p>“Let you go? “There are only three four symbols secret keys, and we are still short of The White Tiger secret key. Before the four secret keys are gathered, none of you can leave!”</p><p>You Feiyu sneered.</p><p>“We have already said that The White Tiger key is not with us!”</p><p>Coldflow wood gritted his teeth.</p><p>I don’t care about that. You came in together. You can’t enter this bronze Hall without the four keys. You’d better stay here!</p><p>You Feiyu said indifferently, his tone unquestionable.</p><p>damn it, you Feiyu, don’t you go too far. You have killed so many people from our three sides. Now that we have given you the key, you want to go back on your word? ”</p><p>Ye Tiannan roared.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>You Feiyu sneered and said with a mocking look, ” “I’m bullying you, so what? Can you resist? In this world, the weak don’t have the right to speak. Right now, your fates are all in my hands. Whether I let you go or not depends on my mood, do you understand?”</p><p>You Feiyu looked down at Coldflow wood, ye Tiannan, and the others, his tone full of arrogance.</p><p>Giggle</p><p>Han liumu gritted his teeth, his eyes red.</p><p>Humiliation, incomparable humiliation filled their hearts, and they almost exploded.</p><p>However, they knew that if they resisted, they would die. Thus, they could only endure it.</p><p>You Feiyu glanced at Coldflow wood and the others indifferently, then stopped paying attention to them. She looked at the passage on the left and frowned.</p><p>The you feishi still hadn’t arrived. This made him a little unhappy.</p><p>“What’s that you feishi doing? Taking so much time to deal with a small fry, this guy is getting more and more unreliable!”</p><p>A young man with a big nose said beside you Feiyu.</p><p>“Maybe it’s because of some matter!”</p><p>Another person said.</p><p>“He couldn’t have been killed, right? Hehe, senior brother Feiyu, let me go and see what’s going on!”</p><p>The big-nosed young man sneered.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
