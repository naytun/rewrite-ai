How was this possible?</p><p>...</p><p>If the truth wasn’t right in front of their eyes, they wouldn’t have believed it.</p><p>“Argh! Die!”</p><p>LAN Yunfei’s anger soared to the sky. His eyes were filled with cold killing intent. With a loud roar, blood light exploded and a sky-blue broadsword appeared. Around the broadsword, there were two silver chakras.</p><p>This was LAN Yunfei’s bloodline, a second level King bloodline.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>His bloodline exploded, increasing LAN Yunfei’s combat strength by a notch. He slashed at Xie nianqing.</p><p>“I’m too lazy to play with you!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes turned cold as he raised his hand.</p><p>At this moment, a Jade-like hand also condensed in the air.</p><p>This hand wasn’t real. It was at least ten times bigger than Xie nianqing’s hand. It was perfect, like the most perfect work of art. Just like Xie nianqing’s hand, it was in the shape of a flower and full of demonic charm.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Immediately, Xie nianqing shouted and flicked his flower-pinching fingers.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The blade light of LAN Yunfei’s slash was instantly destroyed. The finger force did not stop and shot toward LAN Yunfei.</p><p>LAN Yunfei’s expression changed drastically. It was too late for him to Dodge, so he could only block with his saber.</p><p>With a boom, LAN Yunfei groaned and retreated more than ten meters. He crashed into a few tables before he could stabilize himself. Blood spurted out of his mouth.</p><p>Sisi Gu</p><p>Gasps could be heard all around.</p><p>Xie nianqing was too strong. LAN Yunfei was no match for him even before his bloodline was activated.</p><p>Other than Qiu changkong, when did the blazing sun Empire have such a powerful genius?</p><p>“Get down!”</p><p>Xie nianqing shouted again and pressed his palm down.</p><p>That huge hand also pressed down at the same time, pressing down towards LAN Yunfei.</p><p>LAN Yunfei bellowed in anger. He exploded with all his strength and slashed upward.</p><p>But with a bang, the blade light was instantly destroyed, and the palm pressed down without stopping.</p><p>LAN Yunfei roared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, there was an air-piercing sound at the top of the stairs. A figure rushed up like lightning and arrived in front of LAN Yunfei. He threw a punch upward.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The air wave swept out, and the fist force and palm disappeared.</p><p>At this time, everyone saw that there was already one more person in front of LAN Yunfei.</p><p>“It’s him? Yang six extremes!”</p><p>33rd on the cloud Emperor ranking, yang Liuji from the blood Zhao Empire’s great sun sect. Could he be the one LAN Yunfei invited? ”</p><p>Upon seeing who it was, the crowd exclaimed in shock once more.</p><p>“It’s actually him?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile.</p><p>Back in the ruins of the cloud Emperor Palace, Lu Ming had fought with yang Liuji. In the end, Lu Ming defeated yang Liuji with the help of the Golden-eyed blood corpse.</p><p>Xie nianqing was also stunned as he also recognized yang Liuji.</p><p>On the other hand, Feng Wuji and Ling Yanchi’s expressions changed drastically.</p><p>The scorching sun Empire and the blood Zhao Empire were close to each other, and the name of yang Liuji had long since reverberated in their ears.</p><p>“Brother yang, you’ve finally come!”</p><p>Seeing yang Liuji, LAN Yunfei was overjoyed.</p><p>“Brother LAN, I’m sorry I’m late.”</p><p>Yang Liuji said as he looked around.</p><p>The moment he saw Xie nianqing and Lu Ming, he was stunned. Then, his eyes flashed with a cold killing intent.</p><p>“Little bastard, is that you? Haha, good, good, you’ve really worn out your iron shoes in a long search, but you’ve found it without any effort. Since I’ve encountered you today, then don’t leave.”</p><p>Yang Liuji revealed a sinister smile.</p><p>When he came out of the Yun Emperor Palace, he wanted to ask the senior Masters of the great sun mansion to kill Lu Ming, but Lu Ming escaped too quickly. He searched around the Yun Emperor Palace but could not find Lu Ming.</p><p>During this period of time, he hated Lu Ming to the core. He did not expect to meet him here. He was so ecstatic that he almost laughed out loud.</p><p>“What’s wrong? You’ve been defeated, are you looking for a beating again?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>The crowd was stunned. From Lu Ming’s tone, could it be that yang Liuji had lost to Lu Ming before?</p><p>No way? If that was the case, wasn’t the burning sun Empire a little too terrifying?</p><p>nonsense, you little bastard. Back then, you only relied on external forces and a puppet. Now that your puppet is gone, I’ll kill you in three moves!</p><p>Yang Liuji shouted and hurriedly corrected Lu Ming’s words.</p><p>The others came to a realization. It turned out that Lu Ming had relied on external forces. No wonder. It was useless if it was not one’s own ability.</p><p>They let out a long breath. If even a small Empire like the burning sun Empire was this strong, how could they bear it?</p><p>“Kill me in three moves? Just you? Aren’t you afraid of laughing your head off?”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to say indifferently.</p><p>This kind of indifferent attitude made yang Liuji’s anger rise.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>you’re courting death! yang Liuji roared, his body emitting a scorching aura that made the restaurant look like a furnace.</p><p>Xie nianqing moved and stood in front of yang Liuji.</p><p>“Little Qing, there’s no need for you to deal with him. Let me play with him!”</p><p>Lu Ming picked up a glass of wine and finished it in one gulp. He then stood up and walked towards yang Liuji.</p><p>“Hurry up and finish it, we haven’t finished our meal!”</p><p>Xie nianqing glanced at Lu Ming and went back to his seat.</p><p>His tone was casual as if Lu Ming could easily deal with yang Liuji.</p><p>This caused the surrounding people to be dumbfounded.</p><p>haha, I know you’re concerned about me and worried that the food won’t taste good if it’s cold. Don’t worry, I’ll deal with him. The food won’t get cold!</p><p>Lu Ming laughed.</p><p>The others ‘lips trembled. These two were both more confident than the other. They were still thinking about eating, and the dishes wouldn’t even get cold.</p><p>Please, your opponent is the genius on the cloud Emperor ranking, yang Liuji, not some random cat or dog on the side of the road.</p><p>Crazy, too crazy!</p><p>Yang Liuji almost vomited blood, feeling his heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys throb in pain.</p><p>He took a few deep breaths to calm himself down.</p><p>it’s useless to rely on your mouth. You’ll soon pay the price for your stupidity!</p><p>Yang Liuji roared, and the scorching aura around his body became even more intense. His entire body was like a sun, and he almost set the restaurant on fire.</p><p>“This place is too narrow, let’s go out and fight!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Good, just what I want!”</p><p>Yang Liuji shouted angrily.</p><p>The two of them flew out of the window and appeared in the sky above the small lake.</p><p>At this time, it had already alerted the people on the other floors of the restaurant, and they all looked out one by one.</p><p>that’s yang Liuji. Yang Liuji is going to fight someone!</p><p>who is the other person? is he also a genius on the cloud Emperor ranking? ”</p><p>no, there’s no such person on the cloud Emperor ranking. He’s so young, he looks less than 20 years old!</p><p>“This person actually dared to fight yang Liuji, this is going to be a good show!”</p><p>The people on the other floors of the restaurant were discussing.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>&Nbsp; ” kill! the moment they left the restaurant, yang Liuji roared, his aura exploding.</p><p>Wu Zong 5-dan peak!</p><p>Obviously, yang Liuji’s cultivation had also improved during this period of time. Back in the ruins of the cloud Emperor Palace, yang Liuji’s cultivation was only at the early stage of the fifth level of martial ancestor realm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The powerful Fire Force exploded, making yang Liuji look like a small sun. It emitted an extremely hot aura, and the lake water below began to boil, filling the air with mist.</p><p>“Divine sun fist!”</p><p>Yang Liuji roared and threw a punch at Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
