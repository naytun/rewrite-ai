It was clear that many young geniuses were cultivating in seclusion.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment and then walked toward the place with the most aura.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming arrived at the center of the city.</p><p>There were many people gathered there.</p><p>ancient remnant weapon, ancient remnant weapon, obtained in a secret place. It even contains a trace of spirituality. Exchange it for a piece of meteoric metal!</p><p>an ancient elixir recipe from the ancient battlefield of the netherworld. It must be of high quality. I only want a high level earth grade martial arts technique. You can take it!</p><p>…</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming arrived, he heard shouts. It was as if he had arrived at the market outside.</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>Then, he pulled a young girl to his side and asked.</p><p>The young girl was kind. She briefly explained and Lu Ming came to a realization.</p><p>This was equivalent to a small market.</p><p>The first three months of the Ditian Divine Guard selection was a time for people to gain experience, search for opportunities, and raise their cultivation.</p><p>During this period of time, everyone might have gained something and obtained some treasures, but they might not be able to use them.</p><p>Therefore, in some big cities, many geniuses would gather together and take out the treasures that they didn’t need to exchange with others for the treasures they needed.</p><p>Thus, this small market City was created.</p><p>Lu Ming’s interest was piqued. He also strolled around to see if he could find anything he needed.</p><p>There were about five to six hundred people here. They were shouting non-stop and the items they took out were also strange. It was an eye-opener for Lu Ming.</p><p>However, he did not see anything that tempted Lu Ming.</p><p>“You animal, it’s you!”</p><p>All of a sudden, an angry roar was heard. The next moment, Lu Ming felt a cold aura enveloping him.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around quickly and saw a few young men walking toward him in big strides.</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but smile. Wasn’t this the long-armed young man from the flying Tiger Mountain range?</p><p>He was really an enemy, a road butcher.</p><p>As the saying goes, when enemies meet, their eyes are red.</p><p>The long-armed young man’s eyes were filled with hatred as he glared at Lu Ming.”Little bastard, I didn’t expect to meet you here. This time, I won’t let you escape.”</p><p>also, where’s the spirit herb? hand it over now, or you’ll die a horrible death.</p><p>The long-armed young man said in a sinister voice.</p><p>“Are you stupid? it’s been so many days, and you still have spirit herbs? If you really want it, I can still remember where it is. I can take you there, but I didn’t expect you to have such a strong taste!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>This was an insult. This was an insult.</p><p>The long-armed young man’s eyes turned red at once. The bloodline in his body burst out, and a violent aura rose.</p><p>“Die! Die, you animal, go to hell!”</p><p>The long-armed young man roared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming soared into the sky and hovered in the air. “If you want to fight, come up!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The long-armed young man also rushed into the sky.</p><p>Their actions naturally alerted the others.</p><p>that’s the flying Ape from the flying Tiger Mountain range. It’s the strongest expert in the flying Tiger Mountain range. It’s said that it’s a genius of three battles!</p><p>“Who is the other person? He dared to fight with the flying Ape? Could it be that he is also the most powerful expert in a certain region?”</p><p>“I don’t know, I don’t know him!”</p><p>The others were all talking among themselves as they stared at the sky.</p><p>In the sky, Lu Ming and the long-armed teenager, Flying Ape, stood opposite each other.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, the two of them moved at the same time. They turned into two streaks of light and rushed toward each other.</p><p>Then, they collided in the air like two meteors.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a deafening boom, the two figures quickly retreated.</p><p>“Kill! Great ape King divine fist!”</p><p>The flying Ape roared again and charged at Lu Ming with a punch.</p><p>A terrifying fist radiance streaked across the sky and headed straight for Lu Ming.</p><p>“Nine Dragons trampling the heavens!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s body glowed and he took a step forward.</p><p>Wherever he stepped, the space trembled violently, turning into a violent force that surged forward.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This time, an even more shocking tremor spread out. The sound was vast and shocking.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Then, a figure flew backward like a shooting star.</p><p>It was the flying Ape.</p><p>“The flying Ape was defeated, the flying Ape was actually defeated. Who is this person? It’s so terrifying!”</p><p>could it be one of those monstrous talents from the high-tier empires? ”</p><p>“Can’t you guys see? This person is only in the early 6th level of the martial ancestor realm, but he was able to defeat the flying Ape. How many battles did he have to go through?”</p><p>Oh my God, if you didn’t tell me, I wouldn’t have realized it. It’s true. Isn’t this too terrifying? ”</p><p>The hundreds of geniuses below all took in a cold breath.</p><p>In the air, the flying Ape flew a thousand meters and stopped in the air. Blood kept flowing out of its mouth, and its eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>He growled.</p><p>He was a genius who had won three battles and was the best in the flying Tiger Mountain range. Countless so-called geniuses were trash in front of him.</p><p>He had always been the one to defeat people of a higher level than him. Now, Lu Ming was the one who defeated him. He could not accept this.</p><p>“Nothing is impossible. Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long hiss and his figure soared into the sky. He appeared above the flying Ape and looked down from above as he took a step forward.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>It was as if an ancient divine mountain was falling from the sky.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>The flying Ape roared. At this moment, his body suddenly swelled up. His body was a lot bigger, and his arms were thick and solid. He looked more like a giant ape.</p><p>This was a secret skill that could temporarily increase one’s combat strength.</p><p>“Devour!”</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the nine Dragons ‘bloodline and released a powerful devouring force on the flying Ape.</p><p>The flying ape’s body trembled. He felt his blood and essence shake, wanting to leave his body. His aura suddenly dropped.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps and the flying Ape clashed.</p><p>The flying Ape let out a blood-curdling screech, and its body fell to the ground like a cannonball.</p><p>There was a large area of ancient houses.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The flying Ape crashed heavily into these houses, causing the earth to rumble violently.</p><p>“Heaven’s path palm!”</p><p>Almost at the same time, Lu Ming struck out with his palm.</p><p>The heaven’s path palm print condensed and slammed down.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The flying Ape had just charged out from below when it saw the heaven’s path palm print flying toward it. It immediately let out a cry of horror and despair.</p><p>He was already injured, and he was no match for the palm. He was like a fly that was being suppressed by the heavenly Dao palm.</p><p>There was another earth-shaking boom. A large area of ancient houses was shattered, dust filled the air, and gravel flew everywhere.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold as he condensed more than ten long Spears in his hand. He threw them out and they turned into more than ten bolts of lightning, shooting down.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>A shrill scream rang out, and then there was no more sound.</p><p>Many figures were floating in the sky above the city. At this moment, all of them were staring at the city in a daze, their eyes filled with shock.</p><p>Just now, Lu Ming’s series of attacks were Swift, ruthless, and like a storm. There was no way to avoid them, and it shocked everyone.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
