He was overjoyed and his face lit up.</p><p>...</p><p>“How about this, as long as you let us go, I will plead with the experts from the nether demon Palace to spare your life. Then, we will pretend that today’s incident never happened,”</p><p>The green-haired youth said.</p><p>Since Lu Ming was afraid, he believed that Lu Ming would accept this condition.</p><p>A venomous killing intent flashed in the depths of his eyes. He roared in his heart. As long as he escaped this danger, he would definitely make the more powerful people in the nether demon Palace go all out to hunt down Lu Ming. He would make him die without a burial place and make him regret offending him.</p><p>“Are you done?”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly smiled faintly and said.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The green-haired youth was stunned.</p><p>“If you’re done, you can be on your way!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s body emitted a cold murderous intent.</p><p>“You’re scared, no, don’t be scared!”</p><p>The green-haired youth and the other 7th level martial ancestor realm genius screamed in fear.</p><p>Just now, they thought that they had seen hope and that Lu Ming would let them off. But the next moment, they fell from heaven to hell.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to waste his breath on them. The Spear’s gleam burst out and killed the two of them.</p><p>After that, he killed the other injured people one by one, took their storage rings, and swallowed their blood essence.</p><p>brother Lu Suan, we have to thank you again for saving us this time!</p><p>Song Yu flew over and stuttered.</p><p>In his heart, Lu Ming was becoming more and more mysterious and unattainable.</p><p>“No need to thank me. I’m the one who dragged you guys down this time. And brother song, what are your plans next? This city has already been exposed. I’m afraid that there will be experts from the nether demon Palace coming!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“We’ve received news that there’s a small city in the North. There are experts in our area there, and we plan to rush over and meet them!”</p><p>Song Yu said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. This was good too. He was not a kind person. He could not possibly spend his time helping them all the time. They would have to rely on themselves.</p><p>Immediately after, Song Yu and her sister, as well as the burly young man, bade farewell to Lu Ming and left the place for the North.</p><p>Lu Ming walked into one of the rooms and sat cross-legged, refining the blood essence that he had just devoured.</p><p>It was the blood essence of a sixth or seventh grade martial arts Grandmaster. It was not of much help to Lu Ming. After refining it, Lu Ming’s cultivation was still at the peak of the early fifth grade martial arts Grandmaster realm.</p><p>now that I’ve successfully cultivated the heaven path palm, my combat strength has increased greatly. Although I haven’t reached the level of a battle prodigy of five, I’ve reached the peak of a battle prodigy of four.</p><p>Lu Ming summarized his combat strength.</p><p>If Lu Ming were to unleash his full power and open up his Blood Meridian, his combat strength would reach the peak of a level four fighter with the heavenly Dao palm and the power of wind and Fire.</p><p>Just now, he had used this move to defeat everyone from the nether demon Palace.</p><p>However, the peak of a level four talent was only one step away from level five. Although it seemed like there was only one step, this one step was a world of difference.</p><p>It would be extremely difficult to become one of the top five.</p><p>Even if Lu Ming managed to cultivate the second step of the nine Dragons heaven treading steps, he would not be able to reach the level of a five-man talent.</p><p>now, if I want to quickly increase my combat strength, I can only quickly increase my cultivation.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>The power of the palm of the great path was already extremely terrifying. Even if he cultivated the second step of Nine Dragons heaven treading steps, its power would not be much stronger than the palm of the great path. Unless he cultivated it to the third step, then his combat power would be greatly improved.</p><p>However, he had not even mastered the second step, let alone the third step.</p><p>In terms of force, the force of Wind and Fire were both at the limit of large success. The two were balanced, and the power of the fusion was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Even if one of Lu Ming’s forces broke through to perfection, the power would not be much stronger after the fusion of the two forces.</p><p>Unless both forces had reached perfection.</p><p>However, this was not something that could be comprehended in a short time.</p><p>Therefore, if Lu Ming wanted to improve his combat strength in the short term, the only way was to improve his cultivation.</p><p>In this selection, his weakness was his cultivation.</p><p>find a place with powerful demonic beasts, kill them, and improve your cultivation.</p><p>Lu Ming made up his mind and left the small city, heading west.</p><p>They headed west in search of places with powerful demonic beasts.</p><p>Slowly, night fell, and night came again.</p><p>However, with Lu Ming’s Wind and Fire power, as long as he did not encounter anything too strange, he would not be in any danger.</p><p>Those specters couldn’t do anything to him.</p><p>He charged forward until the day came again, and the world regained its vitality.</p><p>During the day, Lu Ming sped up. Very quickly, he crossed the distance of more than a hundred thousand miles.</p><p>Finally, Lu Ming stopped in the middle of a vast mountain.</p><p>The mountain was full of life. From the depths of the mountain, roars came out, accompanied by powerful auras that soared into the sky.</p><p>Lu Ming could sense at least ten auras of eighth grade fourth level demonic beasts.</p><p>He could even sense the aura of a class 9 Lv 4 demonic beast.</p><p>“Alright, this is the place!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>This boundless mountain seemed to have nurtured many powerful demonic beasts.</p><p>Lu Ming rushed into the mountain without hesitation.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss!</p><p>Not long after he rushed in, a Python that was more than fifty meters long pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>The Python exuded a powerful aura of Class 8 Lv 4.</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>Lu Ming grinned and thrust his long spear forward. With a plop, he pierced a huge hole in the Python’s head.</p><p>The Python hissed and rolled its huge body, crushing a few trees that were large enough for several people to hug.</p><p>After rolling a few times, he finally stopped breathing.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and swallowed the Python’s blood essence. At the same time, he took out the demonic pill and swallowed it as well.</p><p>The blood essence and demonic core of a class 8 level 4 demonic beast were much more effective.</p><p>A moment later, Lu Ming’s body trembled slightly. He had finally broken through to the middle stage of the fifth level martial ancestor realm.</p><p>Then, he continued to hunt demonic beasts.</p><p>Half a day later, Lu Ming had killed a total of eight eighth grade fourth level demonic beasts and one ninth grade fourth level demonic beast. His cultivation had reached the peak of the middle fifth grade martial ancestor realm, not far from the late fifth grade martial ancestor realm.</p><p>At this moment, night fell once again, and all the demonic beasts went into hiding.</p><p>Lu Ming followed a demonic beast and hid in a cave that was more than ten meters underground.</p><p>But soon, the spectre found him.</p><p>This led Lu Ming to a conclusion.</p><p>It was useless for outsiders like them to hide. The spirit would still find them.</p><p>On the other hand, the spirit race wouldn’t look for the demon beasts if they hid.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He could only resist and wait for the time to pass.</p><p>When the day arrived, Lu Ming meditated and regulated his breathing for a while. After he had recovered, he continued to venture deep into the forest to hunt demonic beasts.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Half an hour later, Lu Ming dashed out of a Valley at high speed, frantically fleeing into the distance.</p><p>A loud cry came from the valley, shaking the earth and making countless trees shake. Then, a huge toad that was more than 50 meters tall and the size of a small mountain rushed out of the valley.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The giant toad opened its mouth and a Scarlet tongue pierced through the space of several miles in an instant, aiming at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He used the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps and took a step forward. His figure appeared ten miles away, avoiding the attack.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
