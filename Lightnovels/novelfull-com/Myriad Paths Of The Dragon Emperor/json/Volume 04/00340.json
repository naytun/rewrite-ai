Where are you going?”</p><p>A cold voice sounded. Yan Quan appeared behind the swordsman.</p><p>“Old man, you think you can stop me? You really think I’m a pushover.”</p><p>The swordsman was furious, and he violently slashed his sword forward.</p><p>An extremely bright sword light slashed towards Yan Quan. It was even stronger than the previous one.</p><p>He wanted to kill Yan Quan with one sword strike and escape as soon as possible. He was afraid that the Golden-eyed blood zombie would catch up with him, which would be troublesome.</p><p>But the next moment, his pupils rapidly contracted.</p><p>Yan Quan’s fist shot out, and a fist force, vast and scorching, bombarded towards him.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The fist force hit the sword light and directly shattered it. The fist force did not stop and continued to hit the sword-carrying burly man.</p><p>“How could this be? How can he be so strong?”</p><p>The swordsman cried out in horror, his voice full of disbelief.</p><p>He had already used all his strength in that sword attack just now. He had originally planned to kill Yan Quan with one sword attack, but he never dreamed that it would be shattered by Yan Quan’s fist.</p><p>“Why would tianyun have so many experts by his side? Ah, I have to stop it. We must inform the sect leader of this matter first.”</p><p>The swordsman growled and blocked with his sword.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The terrifying fist force hit his combat sword, causing it to shake continuously. His body shook violently and was sent flying backward like a cannonball, blood spurting from his mouth.</p><p>half-step King! It’s a half-step King!</p><p>The swordsman was scared out of his wits. Without thinking, he turned around and ran.</p><p>“I told you, you can’t leave!”</p><p>Yan Quan sneered, his figure was like lightning, in a few breaths he caught up to the sword-carrying man.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>After a few consecutive punches, the swordsman screamed as a few big holes appeared on his body. He died on the spot.</p><p>“Kill! Let’s attack together!”</p><p>Hua Chi shouted. More than two thousand people on the hill attacked at the same time, charging toward the experts of the ten direction Sword School and the Army.</p><p>Corpses were everywhere, truly everywhere.</p><p>The smell of blood was so thick in the forest that it was like a living hell.</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood corpse roared and tore apart a few martial grandmasters from the ten directions sword sect with a wave of its hand. With a roar, the Golden-eyed blood corpse devoured the surging blood Qi and condensed a dense blood Qi on its body.</p><p>Lu Ming did not make a move. He stood beside Lu Yuntian and Li Ping.</p><p>There was no need for him to take part in this great battle.</p><p>Not long after, the mountain forest was covered with corpses.</p><p>Other than a small portion of the 100000 troops that the ten direction sword sect had brought, most of them had remained here. The experts of the ten direction sword sect had all been killed, and not a single one was left.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I knew you would come.”</p><p>Hua Chi did not make a move. He walked to Lu Ming’s side and said.</p><p>No one else heard their conversation.</p><p>“Hua Chi, I didn’t expect the ten direction Sword School to be so bold. When I heard the news, it was already too late.”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>“Since things have come to this, we can only move forward. Sooner or later, I will make the ten directions sword sect pay with their blood.”</p><p>Hua Chi said through gritted teeth.</p><p>Lu Ming patted Hua Chi’s shoulder and said in a serious tone, ” don’t worry. Your problems are my problems. I will definitely destroy the ten direction Sword School.</p><p>This time, Hua Chi had brought Lu Yuntian and Li Ping along even in the midst of danger. Lu Ming was very touched by this and had already treated Hua Chi as a brother who would live and die for him.</p><p>“I believe you.”</p><p>Hua Chi revealed a smile, but in the next moment, his expression suddenly changed, as if he had thought of something. He said,”Lu Ming, I have something important to tell you.”</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“It’s about the mystical sword sect.”</p><p>Hua Chi said.</p><p>“Mystical sword sect?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>“That’s right. Not long ago, my father received news that the Duanmu family of the mystic essence sword sect has long since joined the ten direction sword sect. They’ve been working for the ten direction sword sect in secret all these years. If my father hadn’t planted a chess piece in the five major sects, I’m afraid he wouldn’t have discovered it.”</p><p>Hua Chi solemnly said.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>“Lu Ming, this should be true. My father was planning to inform the sect leader of the mystical sword sect about this, but before he could, the heavenly suppression King, that b * stard, started his rebellion.”</p><p>Hua Chi said through gritted teeth.</p><p>“The Duanmu family actually sided with the ten direction Sword School? I should’ve thought of it. ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart was in turmoil as he muttered in his heart.</p><p>He had been suspicious since a long time ago. He had learned from Hua Chi that the Silver Wolf Pavilion was an assassin group trained by the ten direction sword sect. However, the head of the Duanmu family had repeatedly sent assassins from the Silver Wolf Pavilion to kill him.</p><p>However, he had previously thought that the Duanmu family had hired the Silver Wolf Pavilion assassins. Now, it seemed that they had not been hired with money at all.</p><p>“Not good! The mystical sword sect is in danger!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m worried about this too. The ten direction sword sect has the ambition of a Wolf. We don’t know when they started to set up. First, it was the ghost moon saber sect, and they had a spy from the ten direction sword sect. Then, it was my royal family. The heavenly suppression King has long been a member of the ten direction sword sect.”</p><p>now, the omnipresent sword sect will definitely use the same method to defeat the mystical sword sect. Once the mystical sword sect is destroyed, the blazing sun Empire will only have one Crimson Cloud Valley left. It will be difficult for one tree to hold the fort alone, and it will be destroyed sooner or later. At that time, the omnipresent sword sect will unify the blazing sun Empire, and we will really be defeated.</p><p>Hua Chi said, his voice filled with worry.</p><p>we must stop this from happening. No matter what, the mystical sword sect can not be destroyed. I’ll send you all to the gazing immortal pass and head to the mystical sword sect immediately. I hope we can make it in time.</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Wangxian pass? Alright, once I get to gazing immortal pass, I’ll announce the crimes of the ten direction Sword School and Heavenly King Zhen. I’ll call on the geniuses to oppose the power and Army of the ten direction Sword School and fight them together.”</p><p>Hua Chi said with a nod.</p><p>The two of them came to a decision. At this time, the battle had also ended, and the Army had assembled.</p><p>“Let’s go to Wangxian pass.”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand.</p><p>With Lu Ming and the blood red Cavalry escorting them, their journey was smooth. The strange thing was that the omnipresent sword sect did not make any moves. They did not send out any experts to hunt them down.</p><p>This made Lu Ming and Hua Chi frown.</p><p>Not a single person from the ten directions sword sect was sent out to pursue them. It was very likely that the ten directions sword sect’s people were used for other purposes and could not spare time.</p><p>If they couldn’t spare any manpower, then what could they do?</p><p>Now, there were only the mystical sword sect and the Crimson Cloud Valley.</p><p>Everyone galloped at top speed, and three days later, they were not far from the gazing immortal pass.</p><p>At this time, Ming Meng had already sent an Army to welcome them.</p><p>“Hua Chi, then we’ll split into two groups.”</p><p>Lu Ming said to Hua Chi.</p><p>“Alright, Lu Ming. I’ll definitely lead the Army to support you as soon as possible.”</p><p>Hua Chi said.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, be careful!” He warned.</p><p>Li Ping said worriedly.</p><p>“Father, mother, don’t worry. I will be fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and bade farewell to everyone.</p><p>“Blood red Cavalry, follow me!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The 30,000 blood red Cavalry shouted, their auras soaring as they followed Lu Ming towards the east.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
