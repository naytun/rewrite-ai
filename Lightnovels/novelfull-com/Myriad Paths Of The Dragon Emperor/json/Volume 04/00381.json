How is that possible?”</p><p>...</p><p>Everyone’s eyes widened.</p><p>The commotion here had already alarmed the people in the city. Seven or eight people had flown up into the sky to watch.</p><p>These people had obviously paid 10 million spiritual crystals to take refuge in the city.</p><p>“How audacious!”</p><p>The black-robed skeletal man roared.</p><p>The eyes of the other young men from the dark Demon Palace turned cold as well. A powerful aura burst out from their bodies and pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>To be able to kill a martial arts Grandmaster 5-dan pinnacle second level genius with a single spear strike, he was definitely a third level genius.</p><p>“Brat, you dare to kill the people of my nether demon Palace. Even if you are a genius of three battles, you will die today!”</p><p>One of the young men from the nether demon Palace shouted coldly. The aura that he exuded was extremely terrifying. It had reached the peak of the 6th level of the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>He and the black-robed skeletal man who had been talking earlier were the two strongest among the ten-odd youths from the nether demon Palace.</p><p>“Oh, really? Then let’s see who kills who?”</p><p>Lu Ming held the spear in one hand and walked towards the city, step by step.</p><p>“Kill! Let’s attack together and kill him!”</p><p>The black-robed skeletal man waved his hand. Instantly, the dozen youths from the nether demon Palace howled and their bodies flashed rapidly. Black light emanated from their bodies as they slashed at Lu Ming with their swords.</p><p>With more than a dozen experts joining hands, even an ordinary expert in the early stage of the ninth martial ancestor realm would be instantly blown into pieces.</p><p>Even if Lu Ming was a level four genius, he would still die, let alone a level three genius.</p><p>However, was it possible for him to have won four battles?</p><p>However, they would never have dreamed that Lu Ming was already a level four genius before his wind force had broken through to the phenomenal success stage. Now, he had surpassed level four.</p><p>“Nine Dragons trampling the heavens!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long hiss and his figure soared into the sky. He then took a step forward.</p><p>This step incorporated the power of wind and Fire.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>It was as if the nine Dragons had stepped into the sky and were surveying the world.</p><p>This step, regardless of the number of people, exploded.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The dozens of geniuses from the nether demon Palace, who were below the sixth level of the martial ancestor realm, had their bodies exploded. They did not even have the chance to scream.</p><p>As for those above the 6th martial ancestor realm, they all spat out large mouthfuls of blood. Their bodies crackled and it was unknown how many bones they had broken.</p><p>Even the two geniuses at the peak of the 6th level of the martial ancestor realm spat out mouthfuls of blood and retreated.</p><p>“This … This …”</p><p>Song Yu, Song Jing, and the dozen or so young men who had entered the city to take refuge were all staring with their eyes wide open. Their mouths were wide open, and they could not help but gasp.</p><p>The scene was too terrifying.</p><p>With a single step, a dozen geniuses from the nether demon Palace were either dead or injured.</p><p>Even the two geniuses at the peak of the sixth level of the martial ancestor realm were spitting out blood.</p><p>Most importantly, Lu Ming was only in the early phase of the fifth level of the martial arts Grandmaster realm. How was this possible? How many battles did he have to fight? How could there be such an expert in the world?</p><p>damn it, damn it! Let’s go, let’s go! This man is a peerless monster! Let’s leave first and wait for senior brother Yue and the others to come back before killing him!</p><p>The black-robed skeletal man roared. He was simply scared out of his wits.</p><p>“You want to leave now? It’s too late!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and then took another step forward.</p><p>Nine Dragons trampling the heavens.</p><p>Boom ~!</p><p>The heavens and earth shook. The severely injured disciples of the dark Demon Palace at the 6th level of the martial arts Grandmaster realm screamed in pain. Their bodies could no longer take it and exploded.</p><p>Even the two geniuses at the peak of the sixth level of the martial ancestor realm felt as if they had been hit by a 10000-meter-tall mountain. Their bodies crackled and blood spurted out of their mouths.</p><p>The two of them were both monstrous geniuses who had slightly surpassed the level of a World War Two genius. Their combat strength had barely reached the early stage of the ninth level of martial ancestor realm, which was why they were able to take two kicks without dying.</p><p>“Run, run, run!”</p><p>The two of them roared madly in their hearts. They were extremely afraid. They turned into two streaks of light and fled frantically.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold. He waved his hand forcefully and two spearlights burst out. They crossed the space in an instant and stabbed at the two of them.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>One of them was pierced through the heart by the spear ray. He let out an unwilling roar and fell to the ground.</p><p>As for the black-robed skeletal man, his reaction was slightly faster and he managed to avoid being hit in his vital parts. However, one of his arms was pierced by the spear radiance and exploded.</p><p>“Beast, my nether demon Palace will never let you off. Next time, I will tear you into pieces!”</p><p>A voice filled with hatred came from afar. In an instant, the black-robed skeleton disappeared.</p><p>“You want to leave?”</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. He took another step forward and his body disappeared in an instant.</p><p>Everyone was left dumbfounded.</p><p>Lu Ming cast the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps. Each step he took covered a distance of five kilometers. When he appeared five kilometers away, he frowned.</p><p>The aura of the young man from the nether demon Palace suddenly disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze around but did not find any traces.</p><p>it seems like the other party has cultivated some kind of cultivation technique or possesses some kind of treasure. He’s concealing his aura and hiding his tracks!</p><p>Lu Ming searched for a moment but still could not find any traces. He had no choice but to give up and return to the city.</p><p>The corpses of the ten or so disciples of the nether demon Palace lay on the ground, not moving at all, and not a single storage ring was missing.</p><p>The people in the city did not dare to touch them as they were Lu Ming’s spoils of war.</p><p>In a flash, Lu Ming kept the storage rings of the youths from the nether demon Palace. At the same time, he also devoured their blood essence.</p><p>“Lu … Brother Lu!”</p><p>At this moment, Song Yu and Song Jing flew over. Song Yu looked at Lu Ming with some respect.</p><p>“Brother song, let’s enter the city first!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Then, the three of them flew into the city.</p><p>After flying into the city, Lu Ming was a little surprised because he saw a few young men flying out.</p><p>Lu Ming pulled a burly young man and asked, ” “Brother, why are they flying out?”</p><p>“AI!”</p><p>The burly youth sighed and said, ” this brother, although you are strong, you don’t know that the dark Devil Palace is an extremely powerful sect. The area where the dark Devil Palace is located is called the dark Devil Mountain area. There are high-ranked empires in that area, but the dark Devil Palace is undoubtedly the Overlord of that area. Even the high-ranked empires have to listen to the dark Devil Palace. Almost all the geniuses in that area have joined the dark Devil Palace and become their disciples.</p><p>“In this city, there is a group of disciples from the you mo Palace. Those people just now are not the strongest in this group. Seven of them have gone to other cities to investigate this morning. However, they will be back in two days at most. At that time, we will all be dead. That’s why they left this place and would rather find another city to settle down.”</p><p>The burly young man was kind and explained everything to Lu Ming in detail.</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>Lu Ming had a sudden realization.</p><p>“What is the cultivation of the seven people who left?” he asked.</p><p>almost all of them are above the late sixth level of martial ancestor realm. Two of them are even geniuses at the early seventh level of martial ancestor realm. They are in the middle of the second and third battles and are extremely powerful. Although you are strong, you are not their match. It is better to leave this place quickly!</p><p>The burly young man advised.</p><p>“Thank you for the information!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists, but he had no intention of leaving.</p><p>Seeing this, the burly young man did not say anything. He shook his head and left.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
