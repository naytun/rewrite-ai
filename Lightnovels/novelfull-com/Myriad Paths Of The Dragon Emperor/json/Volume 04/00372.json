You must be dreaming.”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and pounced on the stone egg as well.</p><p>At the same time, the red-haired water demon’s expression changed, and it also pounced towards the stone egg.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Li qiushui shouted in anger and her sword light slashed at Lu Ming and the red-haired water demon.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>With two loud bangs, the red-haired water demon retreated, but Lu Ming did not move an inch.</p><p>“You f * ck!”</p><p>Autumn water’s expression changed.</p><p>this is the power of perfect force. It’s nothing more than this. Get lost!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. Then, he shouted and shook his long spear. The power of wind and Fire, which had been fully mastered, merged and was drawn towards li autumn water.</p><p>“Sword of vast autumn water!”</p><p>Autumn water’s sword slashed out, and her complete water force exploded.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The long spear and the Battle Sword collided.</p><p>In an instant, autumn water’s expression changed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s attack was like a hot knife cutting through butter. Autumn water’s perfected water force was being pushed back.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>Li qiushui let out a roar of disbelief. Her eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>His force had clearly broken through to perfection, and its power had increased by several times. On the other hand, Lu Ming’s force was clearly still at the phenomenal success stage. How could it be stronger than his? this was too unbelievable. Li autumn water found it hard to accept.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Autumn water’s figure was sent flying. She retreated dozens of meters and her face turned pale.</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out his hand and grabbed the stone egg.</p><p>Lu Ming’s hand trembled slightly and his expression changed.</p><p>Heavy, this stone egg was unbelievably heavy.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current cultivation and the strength of his physical body, he could even lift something that weighed a million pounds with one hand.</p><p>However, this stone egg was able to make Lu Ming’s hand tremble. Its weight was definitely not less than a million pounds.</p><p>A stone egg the size of a human head actually weighed a million Jin. This was simply unbelievable.</p><p>The stone egg wasn’t round, but oval, very similar to an ordinary animal egg.</p><p>“Wait, that’s a Leviathan!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s gaze froze.</p><p>He could feel a trace of life force in the stone egg. Although it was extremely weak, almost negligible, it was still a trace of life force.</p><p>could this really be an egg of a living creature? and it’s still alive? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were shining. He was extremely shocked.</p><p>A living creature’s egg that weighed a million pounds, what kind of creature’s egg was this?</p><p>Lu Ming’s imagination ran wild.</p><p>ah! Die! Die! Autumn waters River sword!</p><p>At this moment, li qiushui bellowed. A River of sword Qi rushed towards Lu Ming.</p><p>This was autumn water’s killer move, and its power was much stronger than before.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold. He moved his hand and was about to put the stone egg into his storage ring.</p><p>However, the next moment, Lu Ming’s expression changed. He could not put it in.</p><p>This stone egg could not be stored in the storage ring.</p><p>Lu Ming did not have time to think. He held the stone egg in his hand and took a step forward.</p><p>Nine Dragons heaven stomping steps!</p><p>The nine Dragons heaven stomping steps was a fusion of Wind and Fire.</p><p>This was Lu Ming’s strongest killing move.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>As if he was crushing dry weeds and rotten wood, Lu Ming crushed li qiushui’s River of sword aura with one step. The huge force did not stop and bombarded li qiushui.</p><p>Kacha Kacha</p><p>The sound of bones breaking was heard. Li qiushui screamed and spat out blood. Her body was like a cannonball, flying a few thousand meters.</p><p>“Brat, don’t let me run into you in the Ditian Divine Guard selection, or I’ll make sure you die a miserable death!”</p><p>A furious roar filled with killing intent came from the distance, getting further and further away.</p><p>Autumn water took this opportunity to escape.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed but he did not pursue.</p><p>Li autumn water’s combat strength was not much weaker than his. Although she was injured, it was not fatal. She was running for her life. It would not be easy for Lu Ming to catch up to her.</p><p>The others were dumbfounded. They tried to guess which region Lu Ming was from that he was so powerful.</p><p>Autumn water’s force had reached perfection. She would definitely be in the top 40 of the thousand River region’s Top 100 list. With such combat strength, she was actually kicked by Lu Ming to the point where she vomited blood and fled for her life.</p><p>Especially some of the elders, they were sighing. It was really a new generation replacing the old.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the Heaven’s Gate continued to tremble. However, to Lu Ming’s disappointment, there was nothing more that spurted out.</p><p>After a long while, nothing else came out.</p><p>Many people were also greatly disappointed.</p><p>Most of the people who had come this time had gained nothing other than the aura of the sky Gate to comprehend Shi.</p><p>They looked at Lu Ming. This time, Lu Ming had undoubtedly gained the most.</p><p>He had obtained a total of three items.</p><p>Half an hour later, the mountain peak started to shake violently.</p><p>“The Heaven’s Gate is going to disappear!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>Everyone flew away from the mountain peak and stood in the void.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The mountain peak trembled, and a huge Whirlpool formed under the river. The mountain peak was slowly disappearing.</p><p>After a while, the mountain and the heaven Gate disappeared completely in the whirlpool. The river returned to its calm state.</p><p>As for the water Tribe members in the river, they all dove into the water and disappeared.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Seeing the heaven Gate disappear, many people left the place.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming was the only one left.</p><p>“This stone egg can’t be stored in the storage ring?”</p><p>Looking at the stone egg in his hand, Lu Ming was secretly amazed.</p><p>“Can the Supreme shrine be taken in?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>He could not take in any living beings in the Supreme shrine, except himself.</p><p>This stone egg also had an aura of life, and he didn’t know if he could store it.</p><p>With a thought, the stone egg disappeared.</p><p>“It can be taken in!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>If the Supreme shrine could not be kept, Lu Ming would be speechless. He could not possibly carry a stone egg that weighed a million kilograms around all day, right?</p><p>“Let’s find a place and study it!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he disappeared.</p><p>An hour later, in a quiet place ten thousand miles away, Lu Ming sat cross-legged and took out the broken long spear first.</p><p>After studying it carefully, he realized that apart from being extremely hard, there was no other reaction.</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly disappointed. He kept the broken spear and took out the branch.</p><p>The withered branch was as black as ink, as if it had been burned. There was no sign of life.</p><p>However, they had one thing in common with the long spear. They were extremely hard. No matter what Lu Ming did, he could not leave a trace on the withered branch.</p><p>It was just a withered branch, but it was so extraordinary. Lu Ming was shocked. He kept it carefully. It might be useful in the future?</p><p>Finally, he took out the stone egg.</p><p>He sensed it carefully, and there was indeed a weak life aura.</p><p>It was very faint, and if one didn’t hold it in their hands and sense it carefully, they wouldn’t be able to notice it.</p><p>What was inside? Was it really an egg? Or was there a living being sealed inside?</p><p>Lu Ming guessed and his imagination ran wild.</p><p>“Let’s try injecting true Qi!”</p><p>After that, Lu Ming injected essential Qi into the stone egg, but it had no effect.</p><p>Then, he took out spiritual herbs and spiritual crystals, refined the essence inside, and injected them into the stone egg. There was still no change.</p><p>The stone egg was still half-dead.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
