The place where our ancestors left their inheritance is under this stone house. You can go in when we open the door.</p><p>The head of the mo family smiled.</p><p>Lu Ming and Mo Ying nodded.</p><p>“Let’s start!”</p><p>The head of the mo family nodded to the elders.</p><p>The old men moved and spread out around the stone house. They shot out beams of light into the stone house.</p><p>The stone house began to tremble slightly, emitting rays of light.</p><p>The stone house was covered in inscriptions.</p><p>The inscriptions were bright, and with a few shouts from the elders, a stone door in front of the stone house suddenly opened.</p><p>The moment the door of the stone house opened, Lu Ming seemed to see a blood-colored ocean surging toward him. The nine Dragon bloodline seemed to be so excited that it was about to roar at the sky.</p><p>“This place is not simple!”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned slightly.</p><p>Mo Ying didn’t seem to feel anything unusual, and she looked at the stone house with anticipation.</p><p>alright, moying, young master Lu, the stone door is open. You can go in!</p><p>The head of the mo family said.</p><p>“Many thanks to the patriarch and the elders!”</p><p>Mo Ying sincerely thanked the mo family head and the elders, then stood up and walked towards the stone house.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and he followed mo Ying in.</p><p>After the two of them walked in, the stone door of the stone house automatically closed.</p><p>hahaha, great things have come to pass. This time, my mo family will have made a great contribution.</p><p>After the stone door closed, the head of the mo family laughed excitedly. However, his smile did not have the slightest bit of kindness. Instead, it seemed a little ferocious.</p><p>In the stone house.</p><p>After the stone door was closed, the stone house was not dark. The walls of the stone house were inlaid with luminous stones.</p><p>There was a big hole on the floor of the stone house, and a stone ladder slanted down the big Hole.</p><p>The head of the mo family had told them that the inheritance of the mo family’s ancestors was deep underground.</p><p>The two of them did not hesitate and walked down the stairs.</p><p>The stairs were very long, and they kept going down. After walking for about a thousand meters, they saw a stone door. The stone door was flowing with inscriptions, and it was bright and colorful.</p><p>In the middle of the stone door, there was a pit.</p><p>Mo Ying took out a Jade tablet and shone it into the pit.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Immediately, the stone door made a creaking sound and opened automatically.</p><p>Behind the stone door, there was another stone ladder that went down. The stone ladder was getting more and more steep, almost vertical.</p><p>After walking for a while, they saw another stone door. Mo Ying did the same thing and opened it with a Jade card.</p><p>This time, there was a passage behind the stone door.</p><p>On both sides of the passage, there were stone rooms.</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows slightly. He could sense a chilly aura from the stone rooms.</p><p>“How can this place be so eerie?”</p><p>Obviously, mo Ying had also felt it and said with a slight frown.</p><p>perhaps it’s because no one has been here for too many years.</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Mo Ying nodded and didn’t say anything. The two of them continued walking.</p><p>After walking for a while, the stone chamber disappeared, and the passage continued forward.</p><p>After walking for about a thousand meters, they reached the end of the tunnel. In front of them, there was a huge underground cave.</p><p>In the cave, the cold Yin Qi was even thicker.</p><p>In the middle of the cave, there was a huge pool.</p><p>The two of them were stunned when they saw the pool.</p><p>This pool was not filled with water at all, but bright red blood.</p><p>That’s right, the entire pool was filled with blood, and the smell of blood filled the entire underground cave.</p><p>“This … What was this? Could this be the ancestor’s inheritance?”</p><p>Mo Ying said in shock and disbelief.</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>At this moment, the blood in the pool churned violently. Then, the blood gushed into the air and actually condensed into two blood-colored Dragons, which pounced at Lu Ming and Mo Ying.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The two blood-colored flood Dragons roared, and the smell of blood assailed their nostrils. The flood dragon’s claws were as sharp as knives as they clawed at the two people.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. The demon subduing spear appeared and he thrust it forward.</p><p>Chi Chi!</p><p>Two spearlights burst out and shattered the two Blood Dragons.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>However, the water in the pond churned and the blood water in the pond condensed into eight blood-colored Dragons.</p><p>Eight blood-colored flood Dragons pounced toward the two of them.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>At this moment, mo Ying finally reacted. She waved her hands to resist the blood-red Dragon.</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear trembled and he thrust it forward, crushing the blood-colored flood Dragons one by one.</p><p>However, these blood-colored flood Dragons were not destroyed. They gathered together in the air and formed another blood-colored flood Dragon. At the same time, more blood-colored flood Dragons continued to form in the pool and pounced at Lu Ming and Mo Ying.</p><p>There was no way to kill them all.</p><p>In a short while, mo Ying was scratched by a blood-red dragon’s claw, leaving a deep wound.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The aura on Lu Ming’s body exploded violently. He swept his long spear out and dozens of blood-colored flood Dragons exploded in the air.</p><p>However, it was useless. After a while, it would reform.</p><p>“Since I can’t kill it, I’ll just destroy this blood pool!”</p><p>Lu Ming strode forward, intending to blow up the pool full of blood.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>At this moment, the sound of metal clashing could be heard from the blood pool. It sounded like iron chains were colliding with each other.</p><p>Clang clang clang …</p><p>The sound of the collision became louder, and the blood in the pool of blood surged more violently, making a loud noise like a stormy sea.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>The blood-colored flood Dragons roared repeatedly. They stopped attacking Lu Ming and Mo Ying and flew back into the blood pool.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Under the pool of blood, a violent explosion suddenly sounded. The entire underground cave shook violently, as if there was a prehistoric giant beast in the pool that was about to break free.</p><p>“I’m not willing!”</p><p>Suddenly, a loud roar came from the bottom of the blood pool.</p><p>Lu Ming and Mo Ying’s expressions changed drastically. There was actually someone at the bottom of the blood pool.</p><p>“I can’t accept this! The Dark Moon royal family is despicable and shameless! The entire mo family is despicable and shameless! You’ve set me up! I won’t let you off even if I become a ghost!”</p><p>A loud roar came from the blood pool. The voice was filled with pain and unwillingness, as well as hatred.</p><p>Clang, clang …</p><p>The sound of the chains clanging became even more intense. The next moment, the blood pool suddenly churned violently. As the blood churned, it actually formed the shape of a human.</p><p>This humanoid figure was dozens of meters tall and extremely huge. It looked like a burly old man. He roared at the sky and tried to break free, but the endless blood around him wrapped him up.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>With an earth-shaking roar, the endless blood water condensed into a hundred-meter-long giant flood Dragon, which wrapped around the old man’s body.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
