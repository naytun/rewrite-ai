I reckon that the ten direction sword sect will definitely seize this opportunity and let Qiu changkong participate in the Emperor sky Divine Guard selection. Once Qiu changkong successfully joins the Emperor sky Divine Guard, we’ll all be in danger.”</p><p>The first to speak was Lin Xueyi.</p><p>that’s right. The Emperor sky divine guards have great authority. When the time comes, even a little bit of their power will be terrifying. With Qiu changkong’s talent, although he might not be able to join the Emperor sky divine guards, the truth is hard to predict. Even if he becomes a reserve Emperor sky Divine Guard, he’ll still be a great danger.</p><p>The valley master of the Scarlet cloud Valley, Ling potian, nodded and said.</p><p>“We also need someone on our side to become a Ditian Divine Guard before we can fight against Qiu changkong.”</p><p>Someone sighed.</p><p>The next moment, everyone’s eyes were focused on Lu Ming.</p><p>On their side, only Lu Ming’s talent was unparalleled, and he had the potential to fight Qiu changkong.</p><p>“The Ditian divine guards?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered.</p><p>It was reasonable to say that he should stay away from the Emperor heaven divine Palace, because the palace Master of the Emperor heaven divine Palace, Martial Emperor Di Yi, was his destined enemy.</p><p>However, Martial Emperor Di Yi was still far away from the Tianxuan region, so he didn’t have to worry about it for the time being.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming also yearned to become an Emperor sky Divine Guard.</p><p>It was said that the Ditian divine guards were all peerless geniuses from all over the world, and they were unimaginably powerful.</p><p>Only by constantly clashing with these monsters could he become stronger, stimulate his potential, and improve quickly.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming was deep in thought, everyone looked at him without saying a word.</p><p>If Lu Ming did not wish to participate in the Ditian Divine Guard selection, they would not force him.</p><p>“I’m willing to go, but I don’t know how to go.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The others were overjoyed to see Lu Ming nodding.</p><p>“Haha, it’s very easy to participate. The emissary of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace is currently patrolling the blazing sun Empire. It won’t be long before he sends out an invitation letter to the geniuses of the blazing sun Empire. Only with an invitation letter can one participate in the selection of the Empyrean heaven divine guards.”</p><p>The valley master was overjoyed.</p><p>“Oh? So that’s how it is!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Marquis champion, with your talent, you’ll definitely receive an invitation. Although the Empyrean heaven divine guards will be facing the endless Eastern Territory of the Tianxuan region, where there are countless geniuses, it’s not impossible for you to get a reserve position for the Empyrean heaven divine guards with your talent. At that time, you’ll have the confidence to fight against Qiu changkong.</p><p>Lin Xueyi stroked her beard and her face revealed a happy expression.</p><p>“Preparing for the Ditian Divine Guard? It might not be?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>Could it be that Lin Xueyi thought that he couldn’t even get into the reserve Ditian Divine Guard?</p><p>Lin Xueyi seemed to have read Lu Ming’s mind and explained, ” Marquis champion, the eastern part of the Tianxuan region is too vast. The cloud Emperor mountain range we are in is just a corner of the region. Beyond the cloud Emperor mountain range, there are many other regions that are even larger than the cloud Emperor mountain range. Each region has many powerful empires.</p><p>for example, there is a region near the cloud Emperor mountain range called the thousand River region. There are more than 100 empires in this region. The strongest one is a high-level Empire. It is a hundred times stronger than the burning sun Empire. There are many geniuses and monstrous talents. This is only the thousand River region. There are other stronger regions, so the competition is too strong.</p><p>Lin Xueyi finished and sighed.</p><p>that’s right. In the past, even when all the geniuses on the cloud Emperor’s list were annihilated, none of them became reserve Emperor sky divine guards. The geniuses on the cloud Emperor’s list this time are much stronger. However, I predict that there will be no more than three who can become real Emperor sky divine guards and no more than ten who can become reserve Emperor sky divine guards!</p><p>The valley master also sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. Less than three of the geniuses on the cloud Emperor’s list could become official Ditian divine guards. The competition was really terrifying.</p><p>However, the next moment, Lu Ming’s eyes were burning with flames again, and his blood was boiling.</p><p>Wasn’t this what he wanted? To fight with geniuses and heroes, to break the shackles, to realize self-Ascension, and to constantly surpass.</p><p>Looking at Lu Ming’s burning fighting spirit, Lin Xueyi and the rest looked at each other. They saw hope in each other’s eyes.</p><p>Given the situation in the blazing sun Empire, they could only pin their hopes on Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, Lin Xueyi’s expression suddenly changed. She waved her hand, and a ten thousand mile sound transmission talisman appeared in her hand.</p><p>He was overjoyed when he saw the message in the talisman.”The emissary from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace has sent someone over. He’s probably here to issue an invitation. Let’s go and welcome him!”</p><p>The group hurriedly walked out of the hall and flew outside.</p><p>In the sky outside the mystical sword sect, a young man stood alone with his hands behind his back.</p><p>The young man was about twenty-six or twenty-seven years old. He wore a purple robe and was filled with a noble aura.</p><p>“I am the sect master of the mystical sword sect, Lin Xueyi. Greetings, emissary of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace!”</p><p>“I am the valley master of the Scarlet cloud Valley, Ling potian. Greetings, emissary of the Emperor heaven divine Palace!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi and Ling potian hurriedly cupped their fists and saluted.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>The young man in purple nodded his head and glanced at Lin Xueyi and Ling potian, ” “It’s good that the Crimson Cloud Valley is here. It saves me the trouble of making an extra trip.”</p><p>After saying that, two golden invitation letters appeared in the purple-robed young man’s hands. With a wave of his hand, the two invitation letters flew towards Lin Xueyi and Ling potian.</p><p>Lin Xueyi and Ling potian reached out to receive it.</p><p>these two invitation letters, one for Feng Wuji and the other for Ling Yanchi. Get them to bring the invitation letters to the cloud desolate Empire to participate in the preliminaries!</p><p>The young man in purple said indifferently.</p><p>The young man in purple turned around and was about to leave.</p><p>“Envoy, please wait!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi hurriedly called out.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Do you have any questions?”</p><p>The young man in purple turned around with a cold expression.</p><p>emissary, may I ask why Lu Ming doesn’t have an invitation? ”</p><p>Lin Xueyi asked carefully.</p><p>“Lu Ming?”</p><p>The young man in purple sneered and said, ” what’s so strange about not having an invitation? it just means that he’s not qualified. Alright, there are no other questions. That’s it!</p><p>“Emissary!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi gritted her teeth and shouted again,”Messenger, did you make a mistake? with Lu Ming’s talent and reputation, how could he not have an invitation?” Can the messenger help to ask the higher-ups?”</p><p>that’s right, emissary. I think there’s really a mistake. How could the Marquis champion Lu Ming not have an invitation? ”</p><p>Ling potian also said.</p><p>Even Feng Wuji and Ling Yanchi had invitation letters, how could Lu Ming not have one?</p><p>One must know that Lu Ming could already kill geniuses at the level of the six scorching sun heroes.</p><p>During the battle with the mystical sword sect, Duanmu Lin was even killed by him.</p><p>One must know that Duanmu Lin had defeated Feng Wuji.</p><p>In the end, Feng Wuji had an invitation but Lu Ming did not. It was really strange.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
