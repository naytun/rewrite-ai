On one side, there were private rooms, and on the other side, there was a Hall.</p><p>They didn’t choose a private room, but found a seat by the window.</p><p>From this position, he could see a Lake from the window. The lake was clear like a mirror, and when the breeze blew, it was extremely comfortable.</p><p>“Waiter, if there’s anything good to eat, bring it all to me. Also, bring me four jars of good wine!”</p><p>Ling Yanchi shouted.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The waiter replied.</p><p>It was very fast, and it didn’t take long for a table full of food and wine to be served.</p><p>The four of them ate while listening to the conversations of the other people in the restaurant.</p><p>it’s really lively recently. All the great geniuses can’t sit still anymore. There’s competition from time to time!</p><p>that’s right, I’ve seen a few battles on the cloud Emperor board. That level of cultivation is really shocking.</p><p>the ordinary Geniuses on the cloud Emperor ranking are still okay, especially those who are ranked higher. They are really terrifying. Half a month ago, Ji rufeng, the seventh genius on the cloud Emperor ranking, killed three late stage martial grandmasters in Tianyuan peak with one strike. That’s more terrifying!</p><p>that’s nothing. I heard that ten days ago, a sect angered the second-ranked young master of the cloud Emperor ranking, Wei tianshe. Wei tianshe went to the sect and annihilated the entire sect. That sect had a few 9-grade martial ancestor realm experts!</p><p>“What? There’s actually such a thing? Wei tianshe is too terrifying!”</p><p>Lu Ming and the other three heard the discussions around them.</p><p>Feng Wuji and Ling Yanchi were shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with solemness.</p><p>It was impossible for Lu Ming to kill three martial arts grandmasters in the later stage of the eighth level with a single sword strike, let alone annihilate a sect that had a few martial arts Grandmaster ninth level powerhouses.</p><p>The top geniuses on the cloud Emperor board were indeed amazing.</p><p>also, there’s a young master Huo Ling who recently emerged. He defeated Yuan Zhifei, who was ranked 15th on the cloud Emperor ranking. He’s the strongest Dark Horse!</p><p>that’s right. This person can be said to be the strongest among the rising stars!</p><p>“Don’t forget that there’s another person who’s also a Dark Horse!”</p><p>“Oh? Who is it?”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang. He was born in the small blazing sun Empire, but he rose to power. He was ranked 36th on the cloud Emperor ranking and killed the genius ranked 22nd not long ago. I heard that five days ago, Qian Jun, who was ranked 11th on the cloud Emperor ranking, also suffered a loss at his hands!</p><p>“What? Qian Jun had actually lost to Qiu changkong? Qiu changkong is so terrifying, he’s going to make it into the top ten!”</p><p>in the cloud Emperor mountain range, this generation of young people is indeed very powerful. I wonder if they can compete with the geniuses from other regions!</p><p>Qiu changkong has actually become so strong! Feng Wuji murmured, his eyes were filled with shock and fear.</p><p>“As one of the scorching sun’s six heroes, the difference between us and him is too great!”</p><p>Ling Yanchi sighed and was also very serious.</p><p>The stronger Qiu changkong was, the more disadvantageous it would be for them.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He did not say anything and continued drinking.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s mouth twitched slightly, and he seemed to be a little disdainful.</p><p>Then, the four of them ate while listening.</p><p>Squeak!</p><p>At this moment, the door of another private room opened, and four young men walked out.</p><p>These four young men were all wearing blue robes, embroidered with a sky-blue long blade.</p><p>this is a person from the cloud desolate Empire’s Blue blade family. Could the person in the box be an important figure of the blue blade family? ”</p><p>“I know who it is. It’s the second young master of the blue blade family, LAN Yunfei. I saw him go in earlier.”</p><p>The four blue-robed young men caused a wave of discussion to break out, but the voices were very low, as if they were very afraid.</p><p>The four youths from the blue blade family were actually walking towards Lu Ming and the other three.</p><p>He walked to the four of them and one of them, a young man in a blue robe, cupped his fists and said, ” “May I know where the four of you are from?”</p><p>Although he cupped his fists, his tone was arrogant, as if he was giving an order.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned slightly. He did not like the other party’s attitude.</p><p>“We are from the burning sun Empire!”</p><p>Feng Wuji didn’t want to offend anyone, he stood up and clasped his fists.</p><p>“The burning sun Empire?”</p><p>When the four blue-robed young men heard this, their eyes revealed a look of contempt.</p><p>“So it’s the scorching sun Empire, that God-forsaken place. Alright, I won’t waste my breath on you. My second young master is going to invite a friend to a banquet today. This girl looks quite good, so he wants to invite her to accompany him for a drink. Alright, come with me!”</p><p>A young man in a blue robe said scornfully. Then, he looked at Xie nianqing and ordered.</p><p>It turned out that they were here because they had their eyes on Xie nianqing.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned again while Feng Wuji and Ling Yanchi looked anxious.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes were filled with cold killing intent. He glanced at the four blue-robed young men and said, ” “Your second young master, which dog is he? Are you worthy of this lady accompanying you to drink?”</p><p>As soon as he said that, the four blue-robed young men’s expressions changed.</p><p>The expressions of the other people in the restaurant also changed drastically.</p><p>“She’s finished! A mere woman from the burning sun Empire dared to call LAN Yunfei a dog! She’s finished! She’s doomed to a miserable fate!”</p><p>the blazing sun Empire is too small after all. Other than Qiu changkong, there are no other geniuses. Their knowledge is so shallow that they even dare to offend the blue blade family!</p><p>The other people in the restaurant lowered their voices and whispered among themselves, as if they were afraid that the blue blade family would hear them.</p><p>“B * tch, what the f * ck did you just say?”</p><p>A young man in a blue robe pointed at Xie nianqing and roared.</p><p>“What did you just call me? Slap your own mouths, 100 each, or I’ll break your legs!”</p><p>Xie nianqing glanced at them and said coldly.</p><p>The others were shocked.</p><p>Crazy, too crazy.</p><p>The blue blade family was arrogant, but Xie nianqing was even more arrogant.</p><p>“AI! I guess she is a rare genius in the blazing sun Empire and is used to being arrogant. However, this is not the blazing sun Empire, but the cloud desolate Empire, where all the geniuses from the 36 countries of the cloud desolate Empire are gathered. How can she be arrogant?”</p><p>Someone in the restaurant shook his head and sighed.</p><p>“What did you just say? Break our legs? Hahaha, laughable, laughable, a mere piece of trash from the burning sun Empire dares to say that he will break our legs, this is too laughable.”</p><p>The four blue-robed young men sneered.</p><p>little b * tch, I originally wanted you to drink with me and forget about it. Now, not only do I want you to drink with me, but I also want you to sleep with me. Get over there!</p><p>A blue-robed young man clawed at Xie nianqing’s hair.</p><p>The claw contained a powerful true Qi.</p><p>This blue-robed young man was actually a martial arts Grandmaster 3-dan expert.</p><p>Feng Wuji and Ling Yanchi’s faces changed drastically, they shouted, ” “Be careful!”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The next moment, a figure flew out.</p><p>It was the blue-robed young man. He flew more than ten meters away and crashed into a few tables and chairs. He fell to the ground and screamed in pain.</p><p>His two legs were bent and deformed, having been broken.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
