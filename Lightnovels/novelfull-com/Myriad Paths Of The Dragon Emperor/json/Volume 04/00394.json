After about six hundred meters, he saw the wall. The wall was also made of this kind of metal and there were floral patterns on it.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming took out a level-four saber from a storage ring and slashed at the metal wall.</p><p>The saber shook and was bounced away. There was not even a mark on the metal wall.</p><p>“This can’t be an alchemy furnace right?”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly had a bold guess.</p><p>The deep pit and the surrounding metal walls made Lu Ming think of an alchemy furnace.</p><p>It was an alchemy furnace with a diameter of more than a thousand meters and a depth of several thousand meters.</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming gasped in shock.</p><p>With such a huge alchemy furnace, what kind of elixir was he going to refine?</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the stone egg trembled and actually flew in a direction of its own accord.</p><p>Lu Ming then realized that there was still this stone egg?</p><p>Just now, Lu Ming’s attention was drawn to the stone egg and he had forgotten about it.</p><p>This time, the stone egg seemed to have come alive. It was like a living creature, making Lu Ming extremely surprised.</p><p>Previously, he had spent a lot of effort, but nothing had happened.</p><p>“Could there be something here that’s attracting the stone egg?”</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming ran after him.</p><p>When they arrived at the center of the deep pit, the stone egg shot up into the sky. The surface of the stone egg emitted a strange aura that caused the three-colored primordial fire to avoid it.</p><p>The three-colored primordial fire dodged, and a vacuum was revealed.</p><p>A golden pill the size of a Dragon’s Eye was floating there.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes almost popped out.</p><p>There was actually a pill here?</p><p>Furthermore, this medicinal pill looked too extraordinary.</p><p>Its entire body was golden, like the legendary golden core of the great path.</p><p>On the surface of the pill, there were true dragons and divine phoenixes dancing. It was extremely mysterious.</p><p>Most importantly, Lu Ming could feel that this pill contained an endless amount of energy essence. It was definitely a treasure pill.</p><p>Could it be that such a large pill furnace was used to refine this pill?</p><p>Could it be that the stone egg’s abnormality was also because of this pill?</p><p>The answer was obvious.</p><p>The stone egg rushed to the side of the elixir. Its round body was trembling slightly, as if it was excited.</p><p>Then, a crack suddenly appeared on the stone egg, as if it had opened its mouth, and it swallowed the Golden pill.</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded. He then wailed, ” “No! You should at least leave some for me!”</p><p>The pill was a Supreme treasure. It was unknown how many years had passed, but its spiritual essence had not been lost. From this, one could see how terrifying it was.</p><p>If it was taken out, its value would definitely be terrifying. Now, it was actually swallowed by the stone egg in one bite.</p><p>“Wastrel!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared angrily.</p><p>Kachakachaa!</p><p>The stone egg chewed the pill as if it was eating candy, making a crunching sound.</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming saw traces of golden powder floating down from the stone egg.</p><p>This was the residue that it had accidentally dropped when it was chewing on the pill.</p><p>These fragments also rippled with powerful spiritual essence fluctuations.</p><p>“I can’t waste it!”</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth and controlled his nine Dragon bloodline to open his mouth and suck in the debris.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>When he inhaled the debris, Lu Ming felt as if thousands of volcanoes had erupted.</p><p>Endless energy essence burst out, and the bloodline of the nine Dragons swelled up like a balloon, almost bursting.</p><p>Boundless energy swept through the area. It was simply too powerful.</p><p>Lu Ming was almost scared to death. He then shouted, ” “Refine, refine!”</p><p>He controlled the bloodlines of the nine Dragons and started to refine them crazily.</p><p>Huhu ~</p><p>With the bloodline of the nine Dragons, he was a hundred meters long and had the shape of a flood Dragon. At this moment, he had become a fat worm, round and bulging.</p><p>Waves of immense energy gushed into Lu Ming’s body. This energy was extremely pure and could be transformed into essential Qi without any refining.</p><p>In his dantian, the Qi cyclone began to spin crazily.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation level began to soar rapidly.</p><p>Originally, Lu Ming’s cultivation had reached the early stage of the sixth level of the martial ancestor realm. Now, it was rapidly improving.</p><p>After a few breaths of time, he had reached the later stage of the sixth level of martial ancestor realm.</p><p>However, it had no intention of stopping and continued to speed up.</p><p>no, the energy is too strong. I can’t transform it in time!</p><p>Lu Ming realized that the speed of his cultivation was not as fast as the influx of energy.</p><p>The boundless energy exerted a tremendous pressure on his body and meridians, as if they were about to burst.</p><p>absorb! Absorb the bloodline!</p><p>Lu Ming did not care anymore. He controlled the nine Dragons bloodline and absorbed the energy crazily.</p><p>With the absorption of the blood Meridian, the pressure on Lu Ming’s body finally reduced a little.</p><p>However, the speed of his cultivation was still terrifying.</p><p>In just a minute, Lu Ming’s cultivation had rushed to the peak of the sixth level martial ancestor realm.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, the nine Dragon bloodline roared, and three silver chakra appeared on its body.</p><p>King level third rank bloodline!</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons had actually advanced.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>this pill might contain the blood essence of a Supreme existence. Otherwise, it’s impossible for the bloodline of the nine Dragons to advance.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>This was because ordinary energy could not advance a bloodline.</p><p>But this was a good thing.</p><p>With the advancement of the nine Dragon bloodline, the devouring and refining power became stronger, and the refining speed became faster.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Two minutes later, Lu Ming’s body trembled and the cyclone spun wildly.</p><p>7th level of Wu Zong!</p><p>In just a few minutes, Lu Ming’s cultivation level had increased by an entire level.</p><p>This was simply inconceivable.</p><p>However, it was not over yet. It was still going on.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>After a while, the bloodline of the nine Dragons roared again, and another silver chakra appeared on his body.</p><p>A fourth level King bloodline!</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons had advanced again.</p><p>If others were to see this, they would probably be scared to death.</p><p>&Nbsp; Whoosh!</p><p>His nine Dragon bloodline had increased by two levels and finally withstood the pressure. Although his body was still round, it was no longer in danger of exploding.</p><p>The upgrade continued.</p><p>Early stage of martial ancestor realm Level 7, middle stage of martial ancestor realm Level 7.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming’s cultivation level rose to the peak of the seventh level martial ancestor realm.</p><p>At this time, the nine Dragon bloodline actually advanced again to the fifth tier of the king level.</p><p>“It’s time to upgrade my second bloodline!”</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea.</p><p>He began to control the bloodline of the nine Dragons and transferred a large amount of energy to the second bloodline.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that the second bloodline was extraordinary.</p><p>It was a huge stone tablet covered in mist. There seemed to be some words on it, but they were not clear.</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to comprehend something from the stone tablet many times, but he always felt that he was blocked by a mysterious force and it was difficult to comprehend.</p><p>Right now, the eruption of the second blood Meridian could only strengthen Lu Ming’s strength and defense.</p><p>He had not discovered any other magical uses, but Lu Ming guessed that it was because his level was not high enough. As long as his level increased, he might be able to discover something.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
