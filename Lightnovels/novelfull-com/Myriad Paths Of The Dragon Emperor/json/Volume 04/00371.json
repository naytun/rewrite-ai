This way, the fusion of the two forces would be able to erupt with the strongest power.</p><p>Under the Heaven’s Gate, his comprehension of wind force could simply be described as advancing by leaps and bounds.</p><p>Half an hour later, his wind force had reached the middle stage of the Dacheng realm from the early stage.</p><p>After another half an hour, his wind force broke through to the late-stage of the Dacheng realm. He was only a step away from the limit of the Dacheng realm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, a loud boom came from not far away. Lu Ming sensed a strong aura rippling from li qiushui’s body.</p><p>That was force, li autumn water’s force, which was several times stronger than before.</p><p>The force of water was perfect!</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Autumn water stood up and laughed.</p><p>An extremely powerful force spread out from his body and filled the entire area, forming a powerful pressure.</p><p>Those who were comprehending were all shocked and stopped cultivating.</p><p>autumn water’s force has broken through and reached perfection. It’s too shocking.</p><p>this time, his ranking in the thousand River Top 100 list is going to advance by a large margin.</p><p>Many people were discussing in shock.</p><p>Force, from large success to great completion, was too difficult. Many heaven’s favored sons were stuck at this step, stuck at this step for a lifetime.</p><p>Perfection represented perfection, and its power was much stronger than that of the upper tier.</p><p>“Kid, you didn’t leave just now, but now you won’t have the chance.”</p><p>Li qiushui looked at Lu Ming, her eyes flashing with cold killing intent.</p><p>His Shi had reached perfection, and his combat power had improved greatly. He was now confident that he could rank in the top 40 of the thousand River Top 100 list, or even higher.</p><p>Killing Lu Ming would be a piece of cake.</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into an inexplicable smile and he slowly got up.</p><p>He wanted to test the power of the fusion of Wind and Fire.</p><p>Their gazes met, and their powerful auras clashed, forming a powerful pressure.</p><p>The red-haired water demon looked on with a serious expression.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the heaven Gate, which was hundreds of meters away, suddenly shook.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The entire mountain started to shake violently.</p><p>“The Heaven’s Gate is about to spew out treasures!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>Everyone’s heart trembled as they looked at the Heaven’s Gate with burning eyes.</p><p>“Hmph, I’ll let you off for now!”</p><p>Li qiushui sneered. He retracted his aura and looked at the heaven Gate.</p><p>“Let me go?”</p><p>A faint smile hung on the corners of Lu Ming’s mouth.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the heaven Gate shook once again. The center of the heaven Gate was misty like chaos, and one could not see what was inside.</p><p>Suddenly, a few light figures flew out of the heaven Gate. As soon as they left the heaven Gate, they made a loud sound and flew into the distance.</p><p>The speed was so fast that they covered the distance of several hundred meters in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“That is … A few broken soldiers!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and he saw the real bodies of the light shadows clearly.</p><p>A few lights and shadows were actually a few broken weapons.</p><p>There were four in total.</p><p>It was a battle sword, but the tip of the sword was broken.</p><p>A saber was only half of its original size.</p><p>There was also a long spear. Its tail had disappeared, and only the tip of the spear remained.</p><p>The last one was half an iron rod.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Autumn water and the red-haired water demon pounced towards the remaining soldiers without hesitation.</p><p>Autumn water pounced towards the broken sword, while the red-haired water demon pounced towards the half-blade.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop and pounced toward the broken spear.</p><p>Although the half-broken spear was fast, Lu Ming was faster. In an instant, he was close to the half-broken spear.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Just as Lu Ming stretched out his palm to grab the spear, the spear trembled and a blurry figure rushed out from the spear. An aura that was similar to the world’s most powerful man burst out.</p><p>The figure was extremely tall, like a broken shadow. It was impossible to see him clearly. One could barely see that he was holding a long spear in his hand. He stabbed the spear at Lu Ming with terrifying power.</p><p>“Nine Dragons trampling the heavens!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate. He took a step forward and collided with the spear shadow.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>There was a loud explosion and Lu Ming felt his feet go numb. He could not help but take three steps back.</p><p>The figure also trembled and with a bang, it dispersed and disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. Essential Qi gushed out and wrapped around half of the long spear, holding it in his hand.</p><p>The long spear was pitch-black, and it could be seen that it was covered in sword and saber wounds. It had obviously experienced a tragic battle.</p><p>At the same time, a primitive and ancient aura emanated from the spear. It was filled with the aura of time.</p><p>this spear has been around for so many years, but it still contains a trace of its owner’s undying fighting spirit. It’s amazing. I wonder what kind of existence the owner of this spear is? ”</p><p>Lu Ming sized up the long spear and sighed secretly.</p><p>The broken spear had lost its spirituality after such a long time. However, the material of the spear was extraordinary. Lu Ming could not tell what material it was made of. He held it tightly but there was not a single mark on the spear.</p><p>“After all, it spurted out from the Heaven’s Gate. I’ll keep it for now.”</p><p>With a move of his hand, he kept the half-broken spear.</p><p>In the other direction, the broken blade and broken Sword also had all kinds of strange phenomena. However, they were all defeated by li qiushui and the red-haired water demon and were successfully kept.</p><p>The other half of the iron rod flew far away and was finally taken by a burly man under the siege of more than a dozen experts.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the Heaven’s Gate shook again.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Two light figures flew out.</p><p>Lu Ming took a look and was shocked.</p><p>This time, it was actually two dried branches.</p><p>Two pitch-black dead branches.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Without the slightest hesitation, the red-haired water demon, Lu Ming, and Li qiushui pounced towards the two withered branches like lightning.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Li qiushui was closer to the red-haired water demon. With a loud shout, a bright sword light as white as the Milky Way cut through the air and slashed at the red-haired water demon.</p><p>The power of his perfect Shi was extremely terrifying.</p><p>The red-haired water demon shouted in anger. He did not dare to take it head-on and quickly retreated.</p><p>Autumn water reached out and grabbed the branch.</p><p>On the other side, the red-haired water demon retreated and missed the time. Lu Ming also grabbed another withered branch in his hand.</p><p>This dried branch was pitch-black, as if it had been burnt. It did not have the slightest vitality, as if it was a real dried branch.</p><p>However, considering the wonders of the Heaven’s Gate, Lu Ming kept it.</p><p>“Brat, hand over that withered branch. Quick, give it to me!”</p><p>Autumn water’s eyes were cold. She looked at Lu Ming and chided him in a commanding tone.</p><p>“Why don’t you take a f * cking piss and look at yourself in the mirror? who the hell are you? You’re just a piece of trash, yet you want me to hand over the branch? dream on!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast a sidelong glance at autumn water and said coldly.</p><p>Li qiushui’s face turned green. Her eyes were extremely cold and murderous. kid, don’t think that just because you were able to fight me to a draw, I can’t do anything to you. Now, I’ll let you know the power of perfect force.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A powerful aura exploded from li autumn water’s body.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, the heaven Gate shook again, and another thing spurted out of the stone gate.</p><p>This time, it was a stone egg the size of a human head.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
