It was not something he could fight against. To be able to avoid an assassination attack was already a feat of extraordinary talent.</p><p>But now, the Golden Moon black-robed man was sent flying by Lu Ming in one move. The impact on him was too strong.</p><p>Lu Ming did not care what the others thought. After he sent the Golden Moon black-robed man flying with one move, he took a step forward and charged toward him.</p><p>At the same time, he struck out with his palm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the sky, a huge beast palm smashed down toward Jinyue.</p><p>Jinyue roared and tried to resist, but it was useless. She was crushed by the beast’s palm, and her body fell rapidly.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had already arrived.</p><p>The long spear that carried the power of wind and Fire pierced through the heart of Jinyue’s Black-robed man.</p><p>The Golden Moon black-robed man let out a desperate roar before he died.</p><p>Never in his dreams did he expect Lu Ming to be so powerful. Wasn’t the news he received the same level as the six heroes of the scorching sun?</p><p>However, other than Qiu changkong, most of the scorching sun’s six heroes were only at the peak of the fifth stage of the martial arts Grandmaster realm. He was only at the sixth stage of the martial arts Grandmaster realm, but he was killed by Lu Ming so easily.</p><p>Was this still the combat strength of the six heroes of the scorching sun?</p><p>Wasn’t this almost as powerful as the geniuses on the cloud Emperor ranking?</p><p>This was Jinyue’s last thought before she died. She was filled with unwillingness and doubt.</p><p>“Swallow!”</p><p>After killing the Golden Moon black-robed man, Lu Ming controlled the nine Dragon bloodline to devour the Golden Moon black-robed man’s blood essence.</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons began to refine the blood essence crazily.</p><p>On Lu Ming’s body, nine red Meridian cycles flashed and disappeared. They were so fast that no one noticed them.</p><p>That’s right, nine red chakra.</p><p>Previously, he had obtained nine portions of sixth grade fourth level demonic beast’s blood essence in the Yun Emperor palace ruins. It was equivalent to sixth grade martial Grandmaster. Some time ago in the imperial capital, Lu Ming had refined all of them and completely transformed them into bloodline energy.</p><p>Nine portions of blood essence that were equivalent to a sixth level martial ancestor realm, how terrifying was that? It would directly raise the nine Dragon bloodline to Ordinary Level 9, and the next step would be King level bloodline.</p><p>However, it was extremely difficult to advance from the mortal class to the king class. Who knew how much blood essence was needed?</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As Lu Ming refined the blood essence, he charged in other directions.</p><p>In that direction, a 2-dan martial ancestor realm assassin was fighting with a young man. That young man was a genius from star cluster Hall. At this moment, he was surrounded by danger and could lose his life at any moment.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming rushed over and stabbed the assassin with his spear. The assassin did not even have the strength to resist before he was killed. His blood essence was devoured by the nine Dragons bloodline.</p><p>At this time, there were screams from other places.</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood corpse was simply undefeatable. Its body flickered and one of the assassins was torn apart.</p><p>In just a short while, seven assassins had died in the hands of the Golden-eyed blood zombies.</p><p>Xie nianqing wasn’t too far off either. With a wave of her hand, the assassin couldn’t resist and his head was inexplicably cut off.</p><p>There were also four people who died in her hands.</p><p>retreat, retreat! The enemy is too strong. It doesn’t match the information we received!</p><p>The remaining ten or so killers shouted in panic and wanted to retreat.</p><p>“Where do you think you’re going!”</p><p>“Kill them!”</p><p>The Army was alarmed. Countless soldiers rushed out and surrounded the dozen or so assassins.</p><p>“Since you’ve come, don’t even think about leaving!”</p><p>Lu Ming floated high in the sky, his killing intent surging.</p><p>Then-</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands and Spears were formed one after another. The Wind and Fire forces were condensed on each spear and turned into a flaming light, shooting toward the fleeing assassins.</p><p>“Ah!” “Ah!”</p><p>Continuous screams were heard.</p><p>There was no way to block it. There was no way to block it. The strongest of the remaining assassins was only in the third level of the martial arts Grandmaster realm. No matter what methods they used, it was useless. They were pierced through by Lu Ming’s long spear and nailed to the ground.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the remaining dozen or so assassins were all killed.</p><p>The 20,000-strong Army and the young experts all quieted down. Then, they burst out with earth-shaking roars.</p><p>the general is invincible! The general is invincible!</p><p>The roars of the 20000-strong Army were especially loud in the middle of the night. The demonic beasts were so shocked that they didn’t dare to make a sound.</p><p>At this moment, the Army of 20000 was convinced of Lu Ming’s strength. Lu Ming’s divine might had subdued them.</p><p>On the other side, Huaying looked at Lu Ming with mixed feelings. She gritted her teeth and flew toward Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, Gao Li and the remaining young man who was cultivating in the great sun Prefecture flew towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the three of them in surprise.</p><p>“Brother tianyun, no, general, I was blind to have offended you before. I didn’t expect that you’d let bygones be bygones and save my life. From now on, Huaying’s life belongs to you. Whether it’s to climb a mountain of swords or plunge into a pot of boiling oil, Huaying will not refuse as long as you say the word!”</p><p>general, senior brother Huaying’s wish is also my wish. Gao Li swears to obey General’s words to the death!</p><p>“Me too!”</p><p>Gao Li and the other young man also shouted.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming’s ability had completely convinced them and they were shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was too strong. If he wanted to kill them, he could do it with a flip of his hand.</p><p>Previously, they had offended Lu Ming in such a way. They were afraid at the thought of it.</p><p>Furthermore, Lu Ming’s cultivation was only at the second tier martial arts Grandmaster realm. It was simply unbelievable for him to have such combat strength. They understood that the gap between them and Lu Ming was too great. They would never be able to catch up to him in their lifetime.</p><p>They were convinced of Lu Ming’s abilities.</p><p>“No need to be so polite. Since I’m the general of this Army, it’s my duty to ensure your safety while you’re in this Army.”</p><p>Lu Ming swept a glance at them and said in a deep voice.</p><p>“I can’t wait for the general’s generosity!”</p><p>Huaying sighed.</p><p>alright, now let’s take a look. How many people have we lost? ”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and instructed.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Huaying quickly cupped her fists and turned around to check.</p><p>After a while, the result was out.</p><p>11 of the young martial grandmasters had died, and three of the 1-dan martial ancestor realm had died.</p><p>This was a great loss. One had to know that these were all geniuses that the imperial family had secretly cultivated. They were the future pillars of the imperial family, but now they were dead.</p><p>As for the others, most of them were injured.</p><p>“The Dark Moon Empire!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered, the murderous intent in his eyes flickering.</p><p>At the same time, he raised his guard.</p><p>The Dark Moon Empire was most famous for its assassins.</p><p>The killers of the Dark Moon Empire were very famous in the 36 countries of Emperor Yun. Those killers who lurked in the dark could make people tremble with fear and cause headaches.</p><p>Next, Lu Ming increased the number of patrols and sent out golden-eyed blood zombies to patrol the surroundings.</p><p>Since the Golden-eyed blood corpse didn’t know fatigue, it was perfect to patrol the surroundings.</p><p>Lu Ming returned to the tent to refine the blood essence.</p><p>Just now, Lu Ming had found an opportunity to devour the blood essence of the assassins.</p><p>Out of the 20 people, only a few of them were at the great Martial Master realm. The rest were at the first martial ancestor realm and above. The strongest was at the sixth martial ancestor realm.</p><p>The blood essence of these people gathered together was huge.</p><p>However, after the nine Dragon bloodline advanced to the ninth level, the refining speed was greatly increased. Soon, all the blood essence he had devoured had been refined and turned into nourishment for the nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>However, he was still at tier nine of the ordinary class and had not advanced to king class.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
