Several long Spears condensed from true energy pierced through his body and nailed him to the ground.</p><p>The flying ape’s eyes were wide open. Its eyes were filled with unwillingness, but it no longer had the slightest breath.</p><p>He was dead!</p><p>The flying Ape was killed. This was the strongest expert in this region, a genius who had only won three battles. Yet, he was killed just like that.</p><p>Everyone gasped and felt cold.</p><p>Even in large regions and great empires, geniuses who had won three battles were extremely rare. They were exceptionally powerful.</p><p>If such a person did not die, it would not be a problem for him to break through to the martial King realm in the future. He could even reach an even higher realm.</p><p>Now, he had died just like that. Everything was for nothing.</p><p>A General’s success was built upon thousands of bones. Every peak expert had stepped over piles of bones and the corpses of other geniuses to reach the top.</p><p>At this moment, the other young men who came with the flying Ape from the flying Tiger Mountain range were trembling in fear, and their faces were pale.</p><p>They left sneakily. The flying Ape was already killed. If they stayed, wouldn’t they be courting death?</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with a few small fries. He moved and appeared beside the flying ape’s corpse. He used his essential Qi to sweep up the storage ring and devoured the blood essence.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming soared into the sky and left the place.</p><p>At the north of the city, Lu Ming landed and found a room to enter.</p><p>Then, he appeared in the Supreme shrine.</p><p>During this period of time, he had obtained too many storage rings and had not carefully cleaned them up.</p><p>He had only roughly cleaned up the place and removed the spirit herbs.</p><p>As for the spiritual crystals and weapons, he didn’t have time to clear them.</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming had obtained many things left behind by geniuses who were at least at the fifth level of the martial ancestor realm. There were simply too many of them. The items inside were also extremely rich.</p><p>Lu Ming counted them one by one.</p><p>There were all sorts of lower, middle, and even upper spiritual crystals.</p><p>One middle spiritual crystal was equivalent to 100 lower spiritual crystals.</p><p>One upper spiritual crystal was equivalent to 100 middle spiritual crystals and 10000 lower spiritual crystals.</p><p>Lu Ming stored the spiritual crystals in a few storage rings. He did not count them carefully, but if all the spiritual crystals were converted into low-grade spiritual crystals, Lu Ming estimated that there would be at least one billion.</p><p>Yes, one billion crystals.</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming had accumulated too many spirit crystals and he had not spent them.</p><p>Lu Ming calculated that after the Ditian Divine Guard selection, he would go out and purchase demonic beast blood essence in bulk to upgrade his bloodline.</p><p>Apart from spirit crystals, there were also many spirit weapons.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming had already refined the spiritual herbs.</p><p>There were also some blacksmithing materials, cultivation technique manuals, and all sorts of other items. They piled up into a few storage rings.</p><p>However, there was nothing too precious and it would not be of much help to Lu Ming.</p><p>After all these things were cleared, more than a day had passed.</p><p>Lu Ming then left the Supreme shrine and strolled around the streets.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>However, Lu Ming had not walked for long on the street when he heard the sound of flying. One figure after another flew over and stopped in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>These people were not from the same group but were divided into three groups. They were obviously from three different forces.</p><p>But what was the meaning of these three different forces standing in front of him?</p><p>He had never seen these people before.</p><p>“Brother, please don’t misunderstand. I am the Coldflow tree of the hangushan area.”</p><p>One of the group of people was dressed in long, snow-white robes. One of them was a young man in his mid-twenties with a handsome face. He cupped his fists at Lu Ming and smiled.</p><p>“The hangushan District?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Lu Ming had heard of this area before. It was a small area not much larger than the cloud Emperor mountain range.</p><p>The Coldflow wood in front of him had an extraordinary aura, and he might be the strongest person in the hangushan area.</p><p>“I’m wuhui from the mingyan peak area.”</p><p>“I’m ye Tiannan from the swallow Sparrow Lake area!”</p><p>One person from each of the other two groups cupped his fists at Lu Ming.</p><p>Clearly, these two people were the leaders of their respective forces.</p><p>“Ming Yan peak area, Yan que area?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>These two regions were small regions, just like the hangushan region.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had never dealt with people from these areas. Why were they looking for him?</p><p>“May I know your name, brother?”</p><p>Coldflow wood said with a smile.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. It was just a name. There was nothing to hide.</p><p>“So it’s brother Lu. We have something to discuss with brother Lu. Can we talk in private?”</p><p>Coldflow wood said as he pointed to the sky.</p><p>“What is it? There’s no harm in saying it here!”</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows slightly.</p><p>“Brother Lu, this involves an ancient ruin. I’m afraid it’s not good to let others know!”</p><p>Ye Tiannan of swallow Sparrow Lake said in a low voice.</p><p>“An ancient ruin?”</p><p>Lu Ming raised his eyebrows. He felt even more puzzled. Could it be that these people were looking for him for help?</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and flew to the sky.</p><p>Coldflow wood, ye Tiannan, and wuhui also flew into the sky.</p><p>Lu Ming was not afraid of any tricks. Although the Coldflow wood and the other two gave off the feeling that they were extremely powerful, even stronger than the flying Ape, he was not afraid of them.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not afraid. Even if the three of them joined forces and he was no match for them, it would not be too difficult for him to escape.</p><p>“Tell me, what do you want from me? I don’t believe that there are ancient ruins and that you would be so kind to find me. ”</p><p>Lu Ming went straight to the point when they were high up in the sky.</p><p>brother Lu, please don’t misunderstand. We need four keys to open the ancient ruins. The three of us each have one, and the fourth key is with you!</p><p>Coldflow wood said with a smile.</p><p>“On me?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>haha, I’m not happy with brother Lu. Actually, that key was originally with the flying Ape. You killed the flying Ape and took his storage ring. Of course, that key is with brother Lu!</p><p>Coldflow wood laughed.</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>Lu Ming had a sudden realization.</p><p>“Brother Lu, did you see a palm-sized key in the shape of a Tiger in the flying ape’s storage ring?”</p><p>Coldflow wood asked.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. Then, with a move of his hand, a black, palm-sized Tiger-shaped metal piece appeared in his hand.</p><p>“Is it this one?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>When he was tidying up earlier, he had indeed found this metal piece in the flying ape’s storage ring. However, he had taken a look at it and didn’t know what use it had, so he had thrown it aside.</p><p>Could it be the key to some ancient ruins?</p><p>“This is the one!”</p><p>Coldflow wood and the others were overjoyed when they saw this.</p><p>Then, their hands glowed, and a Dragon-shaped, turtle-shaped, and Phoenix-shaped iron plate appeared in their hands.</p><p>the four symbols Key has been gathered. We can finally open the ancient ruins.</p><p>Coldflow wood was pleasantly surprised.</p><p>After that, Coldflow wood explained to Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
