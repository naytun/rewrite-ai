At the same time, a light flashed in his hand and a long spear was formed.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The long spear pierced through the air and pierced through the strange bird’s chest.</p><p>The strange bird let out a shrill cry as a large hole exploded in its chest. It fell from the sky without any signs of life.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming rushed forward and controlled his nine Dragon bloodline to devour the strange bird’s blood essence. At the same time, he struck out with his palm and split the strange bird’s body open. He took out a demonic core from within.</p><p>Lu Ming would not miss the demonic core of a seventh grade fourth level demonic beast.</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons swallowed the demonic pill and began to refine it.</p><p>A portion of the energy from the blood essence and the monster core was converted into genuine Qi.</p><p>It was a pity that with Lu Ming’s current cultivation at the fifth tier martial arts Grandmaster realm, the blood essence and demonic core of a seventh tier fourth level demonic beast had limited effects on him.</p><p>it seems like there are high-level demonic beasts in this forest. I’ll hunt them while I search for the ancient city!</p><p>After making up his mind, Lu Ming continued to fly forward.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Not long after, a loud roar was heard. A ferocious Tiger with two heads charged out of the forest and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>A moment later, the tiger’s blood essence and demonic core were converted into Lu Ming’s essential Qi.</p><p>The mountain forest was very large. Lu Ming had been flying for five to six hours but he still had not left the mountain forest.</p><p>During this process, Lu Ming had killed more than a dozen seventh and eighth grade fourth level demonic beasts, refining their blood essence and demonic cores.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation had only reached the peak of the early stage of the fifth level of the martial arts Grandmaster realm, not even the middle stage.</p><p>This made Lu Ming somewhat speechless.</p><p>At this time, the sun set and night began to fall.</p><p>Ever since the sun had set, the forest had become completely silent. Not a single sound could be heard.</p><p>Other than the sound of the wind, all other sounds seemed to have disappeared at this moment. It was as if all the other living beings had disappeared.</p><p>The world was silent.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and rushed down the mountain forest.</p><p>Sure enough, there was not a single demonic beast in the forest, not even a single insect.</p><p>Lu Ming was walking in the forest, scanning the area. After a while, he made a discovery.</p><p>A Wolf-shaped monstrous beast was hiding in an underground cave that was more than ten meters deep. It was shivering as if it was extremely afraid.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He left the underground cave and continued to move forward.</p><p>At some point in time, the sky had been covered with thick dark clouds, and the world was dark.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s cultivation, he could only see a few hundred meters away.</p><p>Huhu ~</p><p>A cold wind blew, and it was particularly eerie.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He moved and landed on a big tree to observe his surroundings.</p><p>Kakakaka</p><p>All of a sudden, a series of strange cries rang out from afar. The sound was getting closer and closer, as if it was rushing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Kakakaka</p><p>The cries grew louder and noisier. It didn’t seem to be coming from one thing, but from many.</p><p>But in the next moment, those voices suddenly disappeared without a trace.</p><p>“Where did he go?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>Huhu ~</p><p>A cold gust of wind blew past Lu Ming’s neck.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Without thinking, Lu Ming soared into the sky.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A cold and sharp force swept past Lu Ming’s body and hit the big tree where he had just landed.</p><p>The tree was cut in half and fell to the ground.</p><p>* Kaka *</p><p>Chi Chi Chi</p><p>The strange cry was heard again. At the same time, a cold and sharp force attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>“What the hell is this? Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming held the long spear and swept it out.</p><p>However, Lu Ming felt that when the long spear swept out, it was as if it was sweeping through the air and there was no place to exert force.</p><p>The next moment, a cold and sinister force attacked Lu Ming from behind.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming’s figure soared into the sky. Looking down from the sky, Lu Ming finally saw clearly what had attacked him.</p><p>Seven or eight black shadows in the shape of humans with unclear facial features were drifting in the air at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>“This damn thing, it can’t be a real ghost, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He felt that it was very possible.</p><p>This was an ancient battlefield. Countless living beings had died in battle. Blood flowed like a river, and resentment soared into the sky.</p><p>It was also possible for evil beings like the spirit race to be born.</p><p>“Nine Dragons trampling the heavens!”</p><p>Lu Ming stomped down.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>An inexplicable tremor was felt and a terrifying force exploded from under Lu Ming’s feet. There was even the faint roar of a Dragon.</p><p>* Kaka *</p><p>The black specters seemed to be terrified and let out ear-piercing screeches.</p><p>However, under the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps, it instantly turned into dust and dissipated.</p><p>it seems like the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps has a miraculous effect on this damn thing!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Thinking about it, Dragons were powerful creatures that stood at the peak of all living things in the world. They were sacred and could not be offended.</p><p>Not to mention the nine Dragons that were stronger than ordinary true dragons.</p><p>The nine Dragons heaven-trampling steps was named as the nine Dragons heaven-trampling steps. It naturally contained the will of Nine Dragons. With one step, evil spirits would retreat and spirits would dissipate.</p><p>* Kaka *</p><p>However, the black Spirits were defeated, and the strange, ear-piercing cries rang out in the distance again.</p><p>More spirits were rushing over.</p><p>“Let’s leave this place!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and flew rapidly into the distance.</p><p>In the pitch-black sky and earth, there were constant strange cries. Lu Ming looked around and saw black shadows flying everywhere. It was as if a group of demons were dancing wildly.</p><p>Chi Chi Chi</p><p>A few spirits flew toward Lu Ming and shot out cold and sinister energy.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming swept his long spear out. A hundred-meter long spear ray dispersed the cold and sinister aura, scattering a few spirits at the same time.</p><p>However, the next moment, the spirits gathered together again, but their bodies seemed to have become smaller.</p><p>it’s not completely ineffective. It’s still effective to attack with an aura force, but the effect is weaker!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Then, he struck out two more times with his spear. A thick spear ray shot out, containing a powerful Wind and Fire Force.</p><p>A few spirits were scattered again, and when they regathered, their bodies were much smaller.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop and rushed past them.</p><p>There were spirits blocking the way in front. Lu Ming used the same method to disperse them.</p><p>This was all thanks to Lu Ming’s fusion of Wind and Fire Force, which was extremely powerful. If it was just a single force, even if it was perfected, it would not have such an effect.</p><p>As for the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps, although it was effective, it consumed too much energy. Lu Ming would not cast it unless it was absolutely necessary.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming kept charging forward. However, after a hundred miles, he suddenly stopped and looked ahead in shock.</p><p>Kacha Kacha</p><p>In front of them, there was an Army in iron armor.</p><p>However, the armor on each soldier was tattered and full of sword marks. It was filled with the aura of time.</p><p>Each soldier held a black iron sword and was full of fighting spirit.</p><p>However, the most terrifying thing was that it was impossible to see each soldier’s face clearly. At first glance, it was just a mass of black fog. In the position of their eyes, there were two masses of Scarlet light.</p><p>“Could this be the legendary nether soldier?”</p><p>Lu Ming gasped in shock.</p><p>A group of nether soldiers walked forward step by step and disappeared into the darkness. No one knew where they were going.</p><p>this ancient battlefield is indeed evil and terrifying. No wonder it’s said to be extremely dangerous at night!</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself. Then, he took a detour and continued to move forward.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
