The evolution of the nine Dragons ‘bloodline was too sudden and he could not control it at all.</p><p>...</p><p>If possible, he would never choose to let his bloodline evolve at this time.</p><p>retreat quickly and spread this news to the Duke of the South and the imperial family. This man is a monster. He must be killed!</p><p>The head of the mo family shouted at the martial grandmasters.</p><p>A bloodline that could evolve was simply unheard of. It was too shocking. Since they were already enemies, they couldn’t let such a person live.</p><p>This was what the head of the mo family thought.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>There were more than a hundred martial grandmasters, and they all rushed in all directions.</p><p>“If that’s the case, then all of you can stay!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered, his eyes exuding a terrifying murderous intent.</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons must not be exposed. Although this place was far away from the headquarters of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, it would be a disaster if the characteristics of the nine Dragon bloodline were to be passed to Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>These people must die!</p><p>Lu Ming soared into the sky, and the nine Dragon bloodline appeared behind him.</p><p>A wyrmdragon that was a hundred meters long was floating above Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons roared into the sky, and a powerful devouring power burst out of its mouth.</p><p>The devouring power was dozens of times stronger than before it evolved.</p><p>The mouth of the nine Dragon bloodline was like a black hole, and a terrifying devouring power spread out, shrouding more than a hundred martial grandmasters.</p><p>The hundred or so great martial masters seemed to have been frozen in place, and then they showed extremely frightened expressions.</p><p>“The power of my bloodline is being lost.”</p><p>not good, I feel like my blood essence is about to be drawn out.</p><p>More than a hundred people let out terrified screams.</p><p>“Devour!”</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes as he shouted.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons suddenly cried out, and the devouring power in its mouth became even stronger.</p><p>Then, a terrifying scene happened. All kinds of bloodlines floated above the heads of more than a hundred great Martial Master realm Warriors. These bloodlines wailed and actually left their Masters, flying towards the nine Dragon bloodlines and being swallowed by them.</p><p>“My bloodline power, my bloodline power has been devoured!”</p><p>He screamed, but then the scream stopped abruptly.</p><p>That was because nine drops of blood essence flew out of each person’s body and were swallowed by the bloodline of the nine Dragons.</p><p>More than 100 people fell to the ground stiffly, without a trace of life.</p><p>The scene was silent. Even the battle between the mo clan’s martial arts grandmasters and Yan Quan had stopped for a short while.</p><p>Everyone looked at Lu Ming with their mouths agape. Their eyes were filled with shock and disbelief.</p><p>The roar of the bloodline had actually devoured the bloodline power and blood essence of more than a hundred people. What kind of ability was this? He was simply a demon.</p><p>“Demon, demon, you’re a demon!”</p><p>Someone from the mo family shouted.</p><p>“What demon? In my opinion, your mo family is the real demon. All of you should die, kill!”</p><p>Yan Quan roared and charged towards the mo family again.</p><p>The two sides engaged in a fierce battle again.</p><p>Mo Ying looked at Lu Ming with fear in her eyes.</p><p>I didn’t expect the devouring power to be so terrifying after the nine Dragon bloodline evolved to king class. It can directly devour a living person.</p><p>Even Lu Ming himself was a little shocked.</p><p>In the past, it could only devour the blood essence of the dead.</p><p>Now that his nine Dragon bloodline had evolved to the king tier, he could even devour living people.</p><p>those were only great Martial Master realm Warriors. I wonder if they have any effect on Warriors above the martial ancestor realm? ”</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming cast his gaze at the mo family’s martial arts grandmasters.</p><p>“I’ll try!”</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming controlled the nine Dragon bloodline. The terrifying devouring power enveloped the mo family’s martial arts grandmasters.</p><p>Immediately, some of the martial Grandmaster powerhouses with low cultivation levels trembled, and the power of their bloodlines became somewhat unstable.</p><p>“What the hell is this power?”</p><p>The martial arts grandmasters roared and their essential Qi exploded wildly to resist Lu Ming’s devouring power.</p><p>it’s more effective for martial artists below the fourth level of martial arts Grandmaster. It can affect the stability of their blood vessels. It’s also effective for martial artists above the fourth level of martial arts Grandmaster, but relatively speaking, it’s less effective.</p><p>Lu Ming came to a conclusion in an instant.</p><p>For martial artists with lower cultivation than him, it was still very effective. It could affect the circulation of blood vessels, but it could not directly devour blood essence and the power of blood vessels like a great Martial Master. It would be blocked.</p><p>Those with higher cultivation levels than Lu Ming would also be of use, but the effect would be relatively smaller.</p><p>However, this effect should not be underestimated. If he were to affect his opponent’s bloodline or even blood essence in a great battle, his combat power would definitely be greatly reduced.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>At this moment, the head of the mo family shouted.</p><p>Due to the influence of the devouring power from Lu Ming’s bloodline, the mo family’s hundred sword battle formation became unstable. Yan Quan seized the opportunity to attack and was immediately at a disadvantage.</p><p>“The mo family will be destroyed today!”</p><p>Yan Quan roared, his attacks like a tide.</p><p>“Hold on, hold on. Yan Quan has been suppressed for more than ten years and has been seriously injured. This is only a temporary eruption and he can’t hold on for long. When he can’t hold on any longer, it will be our time to counterattack. At that time, everything will still be under our control!”</p><p>The head of the mo family roared.</p><p>Everyone from the mo family was determined and used all their strength to stabilize the situation.</p><p>Yan Quan’s face was a little gloomy. His situation was indeed as the mo family head had said.</p><p>He had been suppressed and tortured for too long. He had many internal injuries. Now, he could only use a secret skill to burst out his peak combat strength, but he couldn’t hold on for long. Once the secret skill’s time was up, he would be in a passive position.</p><p>Immediately, Yan Quan used all his strength and attacked with all his might.</p><p>“Haha, Yan Quan can’t hold it in anymore. It’s just as I guessed, we’ll hold on!”</p><p>The head of the mo family laughed and revealed a happy expression.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, a loud boom came from the ground behind the stone house. Then, a blood-red pillar of light shot out from the ground and broke through the clouds.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Then, a burly figure rushed out of the blood-red light pillar.</p><p>Golden-eyed blood corpse!</p><p>This figure was the Golden-eyed blood corpse that had gone to the underground cave to absorb the flood dragon blood.</p><p>But now, the Golden-eyed blood corpse’s aura was extremely terrifying, not any weaker than the flame spring.</p><p>This was the aura of a half-step King.</p><p>He didn’t expect the Golden-eyed blood corpse to advance from the martial ancestor 9-dan to the half-step King realm after absorbing the flood dragon’s blood.</p><p>And in such a short time.</p><p>After being stunned for a moment, Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>“Goldeneye, kill them!”</p><p>Lu Ming pointed at the mo family.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood corpse roared and pounced towards the mo family members.</p><p>“Not good, block it, block it!”</p><p>The mo family head’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>“Hahaha, this is the will of the heavens to destroy your mo family. Die!”</p><p>How could Yan Quan miss this opportunity? he laughed as he charged towards the mo family members.</p><p>“Devour!”</p><p>Lu Ming once again controlled the nine Dragons ‘bloodline. The powerful devouring power was used on the mo family members.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>There were two explosions.</p><p>Immediately after, screams of pain were heard. Some of the mo family’s Warriors who were only in the 1st and 2nd realm of the martial ancestor realm were killed by the terrifying energy.</p><p>Even those with high cultivation were shocked.</p><p>The hundred sword battle formation was broken!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
