There were boundless grasslands and high mountains.</p><p>“Ta!” “Ta!”</p><p>The earth trembled. Lu Ming led Xie nianqing, Huaying, and a few hundred other people. Ming Meng led three thousand guards and sped across the plains.</p><p>This plateau was usually used as a training ground for the mountain Army, and there were many demon beasts howling in groups.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming saw a group of hundreds of wild lions, their bodies shimmering in gold. When they saw Lu Ming’s Army, they roared and ran into the distance.</p><p>Not long after, he saw another herd of thousands of black bulls, each two meters tall, running wildly on the grassland.</p><p>there are many demonic beasts on this plateau. If we can capture them and form an Army, how strong will our combat power be? ”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled as he rode on the green scaled horse.</p><p>little brother tianyun, you’re right. However, the demonic beasts of the plateau are unruly, and there aren’t many of them of the same species. It’s too difficult to form a cavalry of tens of thousands. If we use different species, it’ll be difficult to train them together, and their combat strength won’t be high!</p><p>Ming Meng explained with a smile.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He understood that too.</p><p>For example, the berserk Lion was not inferior to the Bloodmoon demonic Tiger. Unfortunately, it was difficult to capture more than ten thousand berserk Lions.</p><p>Furthermore, it was extremely difficult to tame such wild demonic beasts.</p><p>As the group galloped across the plains, they saw all sorts of demonic beasts along the way. Some moved alone, while others moved in groups.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Suddenly, a roar came from the front, and a fiendish aura filled the air.</p><p>Tadashi</p><p>Then, they heard a group of wild lions, giant bears, and other demonic beasts running toward them.</p><p>The eyes of the demonic beasts were filled with panic and fear.</p><p>OWW!</p><p>Wolf howls came from behind them. Then, Lu Ming and the rest saw more than a dozen bloody shadows running wildly toward them.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, they were not Blood Shadows, but a dozen huge wolves.</p><p>These giant wolves looked extremely demonic. Each of them was more than two meters tall and four meters long. Their bodies were blood-red and covered in blood-red scales. Even their legs were covered in scales.</p><p>There was only a ball of fiery red hair on its neck, like a ball of fire.</p><p>OWW!</p><p>A wild lion was caught up by a giant wolf, and it was actually unable to resist at all. It was directly slapped over by a claw, and then its neck was bitten off.</p><p>what a mighty giant wolf! What powerful strength!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed and he exclaimed in admiration.</p><p>this is a bloodred scaled Wolf. The weakest of these wolves is equivalent to a seventh grade great Martial Master, and two of them are even at the first grade martial Grandmaster. They must have run out from the depths of the plateau.</p><p>Ming Meng’s eyes were also filled with surprise as he spoke.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>At that moment, the demonic beasts in front of them saw Lu Ming and the rest and they quickly avoided them and ran away.</p><p>However, the dozen or so Crimson scaled wolves stopped in front of Lu Ming and the rest. They looked at them ferociously and howled continuously, showing no intention of running away.</p><p>this type of bloodred scaled Wolf is definitely a top-tier Mount!</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the dozen or so Crimson scaled wolves with great interest.</p><p>that’s right. It’s said that this type of bloodscale Wolf has the bloodline of a flood Dragon. It’s invulnerable, can run like the wind, and has infinite strength. It’s definitely a top-grade mount. If you have an Army of tens of thousands of bloodscale wolves, you’ll be invincible.</p><p>unfortunately, the Crimson scaled Wolf might really have the bloodline of a flood Dragon, making it extremely proud and unruly. It is extremely difficult to tame them. Even if you use your strength to subdue them, they would rather die than submit. The Dark Moon Empire also drooled over the Crimson scaled Wolf, but after so many years, they have been helpless.</p><p>Ming Meng explained.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little disappointed. He had wanted to build a powerful Army!</p><p>“Hmph, it’s just an animal. I don’t believe I can’t tame it.”</p><p>Huaying snorted coldly and said in an unconvinced manner. Then, his figure rushed out and pounced at the Crimson scaled Wolf.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The dozen or so Crimson scaled wolves roared and pounced on Huaying, launching a counterattack.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Huaying shouted coldly and threw a few punches.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Some of the Grandmaster realm Crimson scaled wolves were sent flying. They rolled on the ground for a dozen times before they got up and shook off the dirt on their bodies. They were completely fine.</p><p>The two demonic beasts of the first martial ancestor realm had only retreated a dozen steps.</p><p>On the other hand, Huaying’s body also shook.</p><p>good fellow, what powerful strength. I’ll tame you!</p><p>Huaying shouted and rushed forward, punching continuously.</p><p>With Hua Ying’s cultivation, these bloodred scaled wolves were naturally no match for him. He was sent flying. Hua Ying identified a bloodred scaled Wolf in the first tier of the martial ancestor realm and rode on it, trying to tame it.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Crimson scaled Wolf let out an earth-shattering roar as if its dignity had been insulted. It flew into a rage, and its body trembled and jumped wildly.</p><p>At the same time, his body emitted a burning flame that enveloped Huaying.</p><p>“Kneel down!”</p><p>die! Huaying roared as he used his full strength to suppress the Crimson scaled Wolf.</p><p>With Huaying’s martial Grandmaster 3-dan cultivation and his King-level bloodline, his full power was like a huge mountain pressing down on the back of the bloodscaled Wolf.</p><p>The bloodred scaled Wolf howled continuously, but it still couldn’t resist and was pressed down.</p><p>However, it didn’t yield. It kept struggling and roaring, looking extremely ferocious.</p><p>“Surrender or I’ll kill you!”</p><p>Huaying shouted.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The only response he got was the roar of the bloodred scaled Wolf.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Hua Ying continued to suppress it. After a while, he was sweating profusely, but the Crimson scaled Wolf still did not yield.</p><p>“You’re indeed unruly!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. At the same time, he felt that it was a pity. This type of Crimson scaled Wolf was not too powerful. As long as a portion of them was equivalent to a Martial Master realm expert and formed an Army, it would be extremely terrifying.</p><p>OWW!</p><p>At this moment, a loud roar was heard. Two blood-red lights came from the distance at an incredible speed. They arrived in front of Hua Ying in a few breaths. One of them pounced on Hua Ying.</p><p>Hua Ying was shocked and threw a punch.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a loud boom, Huaying’s body was pushed back more than ten meters.</p><p>At this time, he could clearly see that two more Crimson scaled wolves had appeared on the field. These two Crimson scaled wolves were extremely majestic, and they were one size larger than the other Crimson scaled wolves.</p><p>“It’s equivalent to the third level of Wu Zong!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>“What’s going on? What’s going on today? why are there so many martial ancestor realm bloodscaled wolves? normally, the bloodscaled wolves would hide in the depths of the plateau, so why are there so many of them today?”</p><p>Ming Meng was extremely surprised.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The two Crimson scaled wolves howled as they glared at Lu Ming and the group.</p><p>Then, with a roar, he turned around and ran towards the plateau.</p><p>The other Crimson scaled wolves followed closely behind.</p><p>“Lu Ming, how about we make a bet?”</p><p>At this moment, Xie nianqing galloped out and looked at Lu Ming provocatively.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
