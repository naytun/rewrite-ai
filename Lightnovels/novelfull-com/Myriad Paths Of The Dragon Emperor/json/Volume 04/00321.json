However, he was exhausted and could faint at any time.</p><p>However, at this moment, he saw mo Ying and the others.</p><p>...</p><p>The moment he saw mo Ying, he didn’t know why, but his nine Dragon bloodline started to throb, and he could clearly feel the cultivation situation in mo Ying’s body.</p><p>The bloodline in mo Ying’s body was definitely related to Dragons.</p><p>He found out that there were two kinds of Qi in mo Ying’s body, so he shouted before he fainted to attract mo Ying’s attention. Mo Ying would definitely not leave him alone and would save him.</p><p>He had guessed it right. Mo Ying was very curious about him.</p><p>“Mo Ying, there’s no true Qi fluctuation on this person, so he’s obviously an ant. Hurry up and leave, follow me back to Su Tiancheng. If we make the young prince wait for too long, it will be hard for us to explain.”</p><p>At this moment, the young man walked over and glanced at Lu Ming, urging him.</p><p>“Mo Bing!”</p><p>Displeasure flashed across mo Ying’s face as she coldly shouted, ” if you’re in a hurry to return to su Tiancheng, then go back first. Also, I’m not going back to Su Tiancheng to see the young prince. I just want to go back. I don’t need to explain to anyone. If you want an explanation, you can explain it yourself.</p><p>also, this man is seriously injured. If we don’t save him, he won’t live for long. I must save him.</p><p>Mo Ying’s tone was firm.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Mo Bing’s face was livid. He then glared at Lu Ming and turned to leave.</p><p>Mo Ying sized Lu Ming up and frowned slightly.</p><p>Lu Ming’s injuries were too serious.</p><p>“This person is definitely a martial artist. He might have just exhausted his Zhen Qi. Otherwise, how could he see the abnormality in my body with a single look? however, this person’s injuries are too serious. I’m afraid it won’t be easy to treat him.”</p><p>Mo Ying pondered for a moment before she took out a fragrant pill and fed it to Lu Ming.</p><p>The pill melted in his mouth and turned into waves of energy that gushed into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>A moment later, Lu Ming’s face was ruddy.</p><p>“Men, help him onto the horse. Let’s continue our journey slowly.”</p><p>Mo Ying ordered.</p><p>“Yes, young lady Ying!”</p><p>A middle-aged burly man stepped forward and helped Lu Ming onto a horse. He let Lu Ming lie on the horse.</p><p>After that, mo Ying mounted her horse and galloped forward at a speed not much faster than a normal person’s walking speed.</p><p>“Moying, you did it on purpose, didn’t you? you’re walking so slowly on purpose. Have you thought about the consequences of standing the young prince up? The young prince is the son of our Yin Yue Empire’s Prince Zhennan.”</p><p>Mo Bing shouted coldly.</p><p>“You keep calling me Little Prince, but I’m not his dog. I can’t see whoever I want to see, and I can walk as slowly as I want. No one can control me. I said, if you’re impatient, you can go back first.”</p><p>Mo Ying replied coldly with a hint of mockery.</p><p>“What did you just say?”</p><p>Mo Bing was furious.</p><p>But mo Ying sneered and ignored him.</p><p>little b * tch, you think you’re the pride of the heavens just because you have some talent? just you wait. One day, I’ll make you regret what you said today.</p><p>Mo Bing roared in his heart, but he did not say it out loud.</p><p>The group of people moved forward slowly.</p><p>Lu Ming woke up half a day later.</p><p>As soon as he woke up, he felt a sharp pain all over his body.</p><p>my body was cut by the sword Qi of the Silver Wolf Pavilion’s assassins, and the pressure from the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps had cracked my muscles and bones. Fortunately, my internal organs are not seriously injured. I should be able to recover in a short time.</p><p>Lu Ming secretly observed his injuries and pondered.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming struggled to sit up and circulated the true war Dragon technique to begin healing his injuries.</p><p>In the beginning, not a single bit of true Qi was used. However, after circulating the true war Dragon technique a few times, a wisp of true Qi began to appear in his body.</p><p>As he circulated the true war Dragon technique, the true Qi in his body increased.</p><p>At the side, mo Ying looked at Lu Ming but did not disturb him.</p><p>On the other side, mo Bing glanced at Lu Ming with a cold look in his eyes. so he’s a martial artist. Hmph, this time, it’s all because of him that we returned late. When we return to su Tian city, we will teach him a lesson.</p><p>Two hours later, Lu Ming had recovered one percent of his essential Qi. He took out Two Spirit crystals and held them in his hands to speed up the recovery of his essential Qi.</p><p>The wounds on his body were healing rapidly.</p><p>At the same time, the internal injuries in the depths of his body were also slowly healing.</p><p>This was the benefit of having a strong body. His body had reached the fifth stage, so his recovery and vitality were extremely amazing. If an ordinary person suffered such injuries, they would have died several times.</p><p>After half a day, Lu Ming had barely recovered one-twentieth of his essential Qi.</p><p>The injuries on his body were much better, and he no longer felt the piercing pain.</p><p>“How’s your recovery?”</p><p>Mo Ying asked as she rode over.</p><p>I’m feeling better. Thank you for saving my life this time. I’ll remember this in my heart.</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>This was the Dark Moon Empire. Of course, he could not use the name tianyun, or he would be killed on the spot.</p><p>Therefore, he simply used Lu Ming’s name.</p><p>“You don’t need to thank me, it was nothing.”</p><p>Mo Ying pondered for a while and asked in a low voice, ” “Young master Lu Ming, before you fell unconscious, you shouted that Qi is divided into yin and yang. May I know what you meant?”</p><p>“I finally can’t take it anymore.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled in his heart and said, ” miss, you’re asking the obvious. If I’m not wrong, your Blood Meridian should be related to Dragons. However, there was a problem during the cultivation process. The essential Qi that you cultivate is more Yin in nature, but there is yang in your Blood Meridian. Hence, the yin and yang are not compatible, and you often suffer.</p><p>Lu Ming also spoke very softly, only mo Ying could hear him.</p><p>Mo Ying’s eyes lit up when she heard this. She was extremely surprised and said, young master, you can actually tell with one look. There’s no mistake at all. My bloodline is that of a Cloud Dragon. Just like a flood Dragon, I have the bloodline of a true dragon. However, I don’t know why yang-type true Qi would appear and interfere with my cultivation time and time again. I wonder if young master has a way to solve this? ”</p><p>Having said that, he looked at Lu Ming with a face full of hope.</p><p>She had already secretly sought out famous doctors and inscription Masters, but she could not find a solution.</p><p>He had been in despair, but now he had hope.</p><p>this shouldn’t be difficult. I just need to suppress the Yang-attribute true Qi and then strip it away. However, to do this, I’ll have to wait until my injuries are fully healed.</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Really? Alright, I’ll buy the best Pills to help you recover as soon as possible.”</p><p>Mo Ying was overjoyed.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He planned to go to sutian city with mo Ying first. He would return to Moonview city after he had recovered from his injuries.</p><p>Otherwise, with his current situation, he couldn’t even fly. If he encountered a stronger demonic beast on the way, he would become the demonic beast’s food. That would be too unjust.</p><p>Not far away, mo Bing saw mo Ying talking to Lu Ming and they seemed to be very intimate. He immediately roared in his heart. this little b * tch, she most likely has her eyes on this little bastard. Hmph, when we reach su Tiancheng, I will report to The Little Prince. Let’s see how you all die!</p><p>In this way, Lu Ming slowly rushed to sutian city while healing his injuries. Two days later, everyone arrived at sutian city.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
