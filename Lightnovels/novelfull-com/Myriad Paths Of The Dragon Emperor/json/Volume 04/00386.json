Instead, it hit a mountain peak that was thousands of meters high.</p><p>The giant toad was furious. It flicked its Scarlet tongue and the mountain peak rumbled. The mountain peak, which was thousands of meters high, exploded and broke in half. The section of the mountain peak whizzed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>WOWO, this Toad is too strong. It’s definitely a half-step King!</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He used the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps and traveled ten miles in an instant.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Behind him, the mountain hit the ground with a deafening boom.</p><p>This attack had killed countless living beings.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop. He took a few more steps before he completely shook off the giant toad.</p><p>This time, he was really unlucky. He had only casually barged into a Valley and had already alerted such a powerful existence.</p><p>it seems like I have to be careful. Who knows what kind of existences are living in this ancient battlefield? if I encounter a real Monster King, I won’t even know how I died!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered. Then, he focused his attention and observed carefully, continuing to hunt demonic beasts.</p><p>“Eh? A rich medicinal fragrance!”</p><p>Lu Ming had yet to walk a hundred miles when he suddenly smelled a strong medicinal fragrance.</p><p>“On the left!”</p><p>Lu Ming tried to identify it and realized that the medicinal fragrance was coming from the left. He immediately went to the left.</p><p>In front of them were two mountain peaks that were seven to eight thousand meters tall. They pierced through the clouds and were exceptionally majestic.</p><p>In the middle of the two mountain peaks, a huge Canyon was formed. The medicinal fragrance came from there.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly stopped.</p><p>In the mountain forest, several corpses of demonic beasts lay on the ground. They had sword wounds on their bodies, and from the looks of it, they had not been dead for long.</p><p>“There are already people here!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately focused and continued to move forward.</p><p>Along the way, they saw many demonic beast corpses.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>All of a sudden, the sound of something breaking through the air could be heard. Eight young men and women appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>stop! This place has been occupied by my Flying Tiger Mountain range. Friend, please go back!</p><p>The eight young men and women sized Lu Ming up. One of the blue-robed young men said.</p><p>Flying Tiger Mountain range!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. The flying Tiger Mountain range was a small area to the South of the cloud Emperor mountain range. Although it was bigger than the cloud Emperor mountain range, it was not much bigger.</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile.”You’ve occupied it? I’ve never heard of any place in the ancient battlefield of the netherworld or which region it belongs to. If you can come here, I can come here too.”</p><p>It was obvious that there were treasures in the canyon. The people from Flying Tiger Mountain range wanted to occupy this place and eliminate the demonic beasts here to obtain the treasures.</p><p>Lu Ming had finally encountered it. How could he miss it?</p><p>kid, don’t refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit. You’re only in the fifth level of the martial ancestor realm and you dare to bargain with us? since you’re not leaving, then you’ll stay here forever!</p><p>The blue-robed young man’s face darkened, and killing intent burst forth from him.</p><p>“I’m afraid you don’t have the ability!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>you’re just a mere fifth level martial ancestor realm and you dare to be so arrogant. You’re looking for death!</p><p>Next to the blue-robed young man, a cold-looking young man in the early stage of the sixth level of the martial arts Grandmaster realm took a big step forward and sent a palm towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A ferocious Tiger with flower spots appeared and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>This young man was a second-rate warrior.</p><p>He believed that he could definitely suppress Lu Ming with his cultivation of the early sixth level martial ancestor realm.</p><p>But the next moment, his expression changed.</p><p>Lu Ming casually swung his palm and the Tiger that he had condensed was easily dispersed.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming’s slap continued.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>The crisp sound of a slap was heard. The cold-looking young man let out a blood-curdling scream. His body was sent flying like a cannonball. He crashed into two trees that were large enough for several people to wrap their arms around before he finally stopped. He lay there twitching non-stop and had already passed out.</p><p>The others gasped and looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>“Let’s attack together!”</p><p>The blue-robed youth reacted and shouted.</p><p>Following that, silver chakra glinted as his bloodline burst forth, and seven powerful auras rose.</p><p>Among them, the blue-robed youth’s cultivation had reached the peak of the sixth level of the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Lu Ming snorted coldly. He focused his gaze and a long spear appeared in his hand. He swept it out.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>With six consecutive booms, except for the blue-robed young man, the other six people were all sent flying and fell heavily on the ground.</p><p>As for the blue-robed young man, he was forced back a hundred meters and coughed up blood.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He was a little dissatisfied with his attack.</p><p>The so-called three battle geniuses and four battle geniuses were not things that could be achieved with a casual attack.</p><p>Instead, it referred to the combat power he had when he used his full strength and executed his ultimate move.</p><p>When Lu Ming used the heavenly path palm, he could reach the peak of a level four fighter.</p><p>And the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps was only a little more than the four battle geniuses.</p><p>As for the power of wind and Fire, without the nine Dragons heaven stomping step or the heavenly path palm, he could only reach the level of a level 4 fighter.</p><p>He was not satisfied with himself, but the blue-robed young man and the others were terrified.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the sound of something breaking through the air was heard again.</p><p>From the direction of the canyon, dozens of figures flew out.</p><p>It was obvious that these people were all geniuses from the flying Tiger Mountain range.</p><p>Just now, they had already been alerted.</p><p>you’re all alone, yet you dare to go against so many people in the flying Tiger Mountain range. Are you looking for death? ”</p><p>Dozens of people stood in front of Lu Ming. A burly young man shouted coldly.</p><p>this place doesn’t belong to your Flying Tiger Mountain range. I can’t come and go as I please. You’re the ones who are too overbearing.</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“Kid, which region are you from?”</p><p>The one who spoke was a young man standing in the middle of the dozens of people.</p><p>This young man had the back of a Tiger and the waist of a bear. His arms were especially long and could reach his knees if they were casually placed.</p><p>Obviously, he was the leader of the group.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the person and frowned. This person gave him a very dangerous feeling.</p><p>“The cloud Emperor mountain range!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. There was nothing to hide.</p><p>“Cloud Emperor mountain range?”</p><p>After hearing Lu Ming’s words, the dozens of people from the flying Tiger Mountain range were visibly relieved.</p><p>The long-armed young man in the lead even sneered.</p><p>so you are from the cloud Emperor mountain range. Hehe, since you dared to hurt so many of us, you can stay here forever!</p><p>The long-armed young man sneered.</p><p>The reason why he said so much just now was that he was afraid that Lu Ming was a genius from a large area. If that was the case, he would have to think twice.</p><p>Now? There was no need for that.</p><p>brother Fei, you’re the number one expert in our Flying Tiger Mountain range. You don’t need to use an ox-Cleaver to kill a chicken. There’s no need for you to do it. I’ll go and kill him!</p><p>The burly young man from before strode out.</p><p>With every step he took, the earth rumbled and cracked.</p><p>A huge black bear appeared above his head, with four silver chakra shining brightly.</p><p>He was in the early stage of the martial ancestor 7-stage. Without a doubt, this person was a genius who was not weaker than young master Tian she.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>A saber appeared in the burly young man’s hand and he slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>This blade seemed to be able to split a mountain.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
