It can’t be Lu Ming’s. How can Lu Ming be tianyun?”</p><p>Lu Yao called out incoherently.</p><p>Not long ago, she was still thinking that it was a pity that Lu Ming was not here. She could not see the gap between him and Duanmu Lin and was proud that he had chosen Duanmu Lin.</p><p>However, in the blink of an eye, tianyun had appeared and defeated Duanmu Lin with a single move.</p><p>Now, he was telling her that Lu Ming was tianyun.</p><p>This was a huge blow to her.</p><p>no, no, impossible. It’s fake. All of this is fake.</p><p>Lu Yao shrieked, her beautiful face contorted into a hideous and terrifying expression.</p><p>She couldn’t accept all this.</p><p>In the sky, Lu Ming casually glanced at Lu Yao and no longer paid attention to her, as if she was just a stranger.</p><p>“Duanmu Lin, I’ll send you on your way!”</p><p>Lu Ming said softly.</p><p>“No, no, I can’t die!”</p><p>Duanmu Lin cried out in horror as he desperately flew backward.</p><p>“Lu Ming, stop!”</p><p>Duanmu canghai roared and a powerful aura burst out from his body, wanting to save him.</p><p>However, he was being held back by Lin Xueyi.</p><p>“Yan LAN, get lost!”</p><p>On the other side, Duanmu pojun also roared loudly. He wanted to save Yan LAN, but how could Yan LAN allow him to do so?</p><p>“Duanmu pojun, we haven’t decided who’s going to win yet. Where are you going?”</p><p>Yan LAN laughed coldly as he blocked Duanmu pojun’s way.</p><p>“Stop him!”</p><p>Yin tianjue shouted.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A few of the experts he had brought with him charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>A long spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hands. With a stab, the Spear’s gleam burst out and the two seventh grade martial arts Grandmaster experts were instantly killed.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming devoured the blood essence.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop as he charged toward Duanmu Lin.</p><p>“Stop him and let young master Lin escape.”</p><p>The other Duanmu family experts rushed over, but the strongest was only in the seventh level of the martial arts Grandmaster realm. They were all killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>In the next moment, Lu Ming appeared in front of Duanmu Lin.</p><p>“I’m not afraid!”</p><p>Duanmu Lin shouted in fear.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and thrust his spear.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The spear pierced through Duanmu Lin’s heart.</p><p>Duanmu Lin’s eyes immediately popped out like a dead fish’s. His eyes were filled with unwillingness and regret.</p><p>Immediately after, the life in his eyes quickly dissipated.</p><p>Never in his dreams did he expect that he would die in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>More than a year ago, when Lu Ming left the mystical sword sect, he said that he would return to the sect to kill him within two years. At that time, he did not take it seriously.</p><p>He did not think that Lu Ming could catch up to him.</p><p>However, the truth was often very different from what you expected.</p><p>Duanmu Lin was dead!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming swung his long spear and Duanmu Lin’s corpse flew out like a piece of trash.</p><p>“No, Lu Ming, you should die. You should die!”</p><p>In the sky, Duanmu canghai screamed hysterically, his voice was as shrill as a ghost.</p><p>Duanmu Lin was the hope of the Duanmu family, and now that his hope had been snuffed out, Duanmu canghai simply couldn’t bear it.</p><p>“Old man, what are you shouting for? After I left the sect, you sent people to assassinate me. I once swore to trample your Duanmu family to the ground. Now it’s your turn. Golden Eye, go and kill that old man!”</p><p>Lu Ming berated Duanmu canghai and then instructed the Golden-eyed blood corpse.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood corpse let out a deafening roar as it emitted a dense blood-red light and pounced towards Duanmu canghai.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Duanmu canghai roared and slashed at the Golden-eyed blood corpse.</p><p>A sharp sword light burst out, trying to cut the Golden-eyed blood zombie in half.</p><p>However, the result shocked everyone.</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood corpse waved its claws and tore Duanmu canghai’s sword light into pieces. The Golden-eyed blood corpse continued to attack Duanmu canghai with lightning speed.</p><p>half-step King warrior? why is it half-step King warrior again? ”</p><p>Duanmu canghai let out a cry of disbelief.</p><p>There was another half-step King beside Lu Ming. How was that possible?</p><p>Could it be that half-step Kings were cabbages?</p><p>Even Lin Xueyi and the other half-step Kings were stunned.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Duanmu canghai circulated his sword force and burst out with all his strength.</p><p>Just now, he thought that he could kill the Golden-eyed blood corpse with a casual strike, so the sword ray was easily destroyed by the corpse.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At this moment, Lin Xueyi shouted coldly, and a terrifying sword aura burst forth, and a peerless sharp edge stabbed towards Duanmu canghai.</p><p>“Argh! Lin Xueyi, you sneaked an attack on me, you’re despicable!”</p><p>Duanmu canghai howled in fear as he used all his strength to resist.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang and Yin tianjue roared and wanted to save him, but Shangguan Ming and Yan Quan had also made their moves.</p><p>A battle between half-step Kings suddenly erupted.</p><p>The entire heaven and earth was in an uproar.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>An earth-shattering scream reverberated through the entire mystical sword sect.</p><p>It was Duanmu canghai.</p><p>He was no match for the Golden-eyed blood corpse and Lin Xueyi. Furthermore, Lin Xueyi had launched a sneak attack.</p><p>With one move, a piece of flesh was torn off from his chest by the Golden-eyed blood corpse. Even his bones and internal organs could be seen.</p><p>His right hand had disappeared. Lin Xueyi’s sword light had cut off one of his arms from his shoulder, almost cutting him in half.</p><p>But even if he dodged it, he was already half-dead.</p><p>ah, Lin Xueyi, you’re despicable! How dare you sneak attack me!</p><p>Duanmu canghai shouted.</p><p>“There’s no need to kill traitors in broad daylight. Kill!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi’s killing intent was like a tidal wave. She hated the Duanmu family to the core. She unleashed her full power and charged towards Duanmu canghai.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood corpse also roared and charged towards Duanmu canghai.</p><p>“Save me!”</p><p>Duanmu Cang’s sea urchin was scared out of its wits as it fled for its life.</p><p>Unfortunately, even if Qiu Wuyang and Yin tianjue wanted to help, they were powerless.</p><p>Their opponents weren’t any weaker than them.</p><p>Duanmu canghai was already heavily injured and his combat strength was greatly reduced. How could he escape?</p><p>The next moment, another scream was heard.</p><p>He dodged the claw of the Golden-eyed blood corpse, but he couldn’t avoid Lin Xueyi’s sword and was cut in half.</p><p>After all, he was a half-step King with a strong life force. Duanmu canghai was still alive, and he started to scream in fear.</p><p>sect leader, sect leader, please spare my life. Please spare my old bones. For the sake of all the years I’ve fought for the sect, please spare me!</p><p>Duanmu canghai pleaded loudly.</p><p>&Nbsp; he actually called him sect leader again, he was really shameless.</p><p>Indeed, the older a person was, the more afraid he was of death.</p><p>“Fight for the sect? I think you’ve been working hard for yourself all these years. Duanmu canghai, I’ll send you on your way personally.”</p><p>Lin Xueyi coldly shouted.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sharp sword Qi burst out.</p><p>Duanmu canghai let out a cry of despair as the sword Qi sliced through his head, splitting him into two.</p><p>Duanmu canghai, a half-step King, was dead!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
