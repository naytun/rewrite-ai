There were a series of powerful aristocratic families that obeyed the royal family and ruled the mountains and rivers.</p><p>Su Tian city was extremely majestic and was one of the top ten cities in the dark Moon Empire. The mo family of su Tian city was also extremely prosperous and could be ranked in the top ten among the major families in the dark Moon Empire.</p><p>On the way, Lu Ming learned a lot of information.</p><p>For example, mo Ying was originally a branch family disciple of the mo family, but she had amazing talent and was heavily nurtured by the mo family. Now, she was already one of the top five geniuses of the mo family, and her cultivation had reached the 1-stage martial ancestor realm.</p><p>With such a status, the treatment in the mo family would not be bad. They would have an independent courtyard and a dozen servants.</p><p>As soon as they returned to the mo family, mo Ying brought Lu Ming to her courtyard so that Lu Ming could recover better.</p><p>In a guest room in moying courtyard, Lu Ming sat cross-legged.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, a pile of spiritual herbs appeared beside him.</p><p>At this point, Lu Ming could finally relax and recover to his heart’s content.</p><p>Immediately, he activated the ten thousand spirit war body and transformed the spiritual herbs and medicines into the Qi of ten thousand spirits. The Qi of ten thousand spirits seeped into his body and quickly healed Lu Ming’s injuries.</p><p>Lu Ming’s physical body was recovering rapidly.</p><p>A few hours later, Lu Ming was done with the recovery of his physical body. He circulated the true war Dragon technique to recover his essential Qi.</p><p>It was already evening when he finished his cultivation.</p><p>Thump thump thump</p><p>There was a knock on the door. Lu Ming opened the door and it was mo Ying.</p><p>Obviously, mo Ying had just finished washing up, and her hair was still wet and stuck to her face.</p><p>He had to admit that mo Ying was indeed very beautiful. Among all the women Lu Ming had seen, mo Ying was only slightly inferior to Xie nianqing, Xie nianjun, Qiu Yue, and Mu Lan. She was a rare beauty.</p><p>brother Lu, this is the healing pill I just bought. Take it and heal your wounds!</p><p>Mo Ying took out a few Jade bottles and handed them to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stand on ceremony. He took the Jade bottle and smiled.”Many thanks, miss mo!”</p><p>you’re welcome. I won’t disturb brother Lu’s healing.</p><p>Mo Ying didn’t say much. After a polite word, she turned around and left.</p><p>After mo Ying left, Lu Ming raised his head and looked in the direction of the North.</p><p>That direction was deep in the mo family.</p><p>Lu Ming did not know why, but when he arrived at the mo family, he felt that there was something deep within the mo family that was attracting him. To be more precise, it was attracting the nine Dragon bloodlines, making them feel jubilant.</p><p>“What exactly does the mo family have? It actually caused the bloodline of the nine Dragons to feel jubilant. It seems that I will have to stay in the mo family for a while.”</p><p>Lu Ming looked in that direction and pondered.</p><p>After pondering for a while, Lu Ming returned to his room to recuperate.</p><p>Five days passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>After five days of recuperation, Lu Ming’s injuries had fully recovered and his cultivation had returned to its peak.</p><p>To be able to completely recover from such a serious injury in just five days was extremely shocking.</p><p>This was completely due to his deity-grade cultivation technique, the true war Dragon technique, and his fifth stage physical body.</p><p>In the past five days, mo Ying often came to visit him, but she did not mention anything about treating her.</p><p>“I wonder what the local customs of the Dark Moon Empire are like? It’s rare for me to come here, so I’ll go and experience it!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. Then, he walked out of mo Ying’s courtyard and casually strolled around su Tiancheng.</p><p>Sutian city was really huge. In the blazing sun Empire, Lu Ming had only seen a city bigger than sutian city in the blazing sun imperial capital.</p><p>On the streets, there was an endless stream of martial artists giving off powerful auras, and the streets were surrounded by a forest of shops.</p><p>There were all sorts of strange items and some of them were the specialty products of the Dark Moon Empire. Lu Ming had only read about them in books in the past. Now that he had seen the real thing, he could not help but buy some.</p><p>“Little bastard, stop right there!”</p><p>Lu Ming had only been shopping for a while when a cold voice came from behind.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and could not help but sneer.</p><p>Wasn’t the person who had come mo Bing?</p><p>Mo Bing’s face was dark as he strode towards Lu Ming with four burly men.</p><p>“Who’s the little bastard calling?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“Of course I’m calling you little bastard!”</p><p>Mo Bing said coldly.</p><p>“Oh? So it’s the little bastard who called me. Hello, little bastard!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“You win!”</p><p>Only then did mo Bing react, and his face turned livid.</p><p>As for the four burly men behind him, they almost couldn’t hold back their laughter. However, their bodies were slightly trembling, and it was obvious that they were having a hard time holding it in.</p><p>“You have a sharp tongue. Do you want to die?”</p><p>Mo Bing’s expression was extremely ugly. He stared at Lu Ming coldly and said, ” I think your injuries have almost recovered during this period of time. In that case, you should get out of the mo family as soon as possible. Mo Ying’s courtyard is not a place you can stay in. The longer you stay, the more miserable your death will be!</p><p>“Oh? Was it? I’d like to try!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and did not care.</p><p>“Brat, have you taken a fancy to that girl mo Ying and are trying to get her? let me tell you, the young prince has taken a fancy to mo Ying. Whoever tries to get her is going against the young prince, and only death awaits them.”</p><p>Mo Bing threatened.</p><p>“Young prince? Who does he think he is?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>Mo Bing’s expression changed as he shouted, ” brat, you’re courting death. Men, attack! Break his legs and throw him out of su Tiancheng!</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Behind mo Bing, the four burly men answered in unison. They strode forward, exuding a powerful aura as they closed in on Lu Ming.</p><p>Ninth grade great Martial Master realm. The four burly men were all ninth grade great martial masters.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The four burly men attacked at the same time, aiming at Lu Ming’s hands and feet.</p><p>This was to cripple his four limbs in one blow.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The next moment, four crisp sounds rang out, and four tall figures flew far away and fell to the ground. Each of them held an arm and wailed endlessly.</p><p>It was the four burly men. At this moment, each of them had an arm twisted into a fried dough twist, broken into seven or eight pieces.</p><p>Mo Bing was stunned. He blinked his eyes hard, thinking that he was dreaming.</p><p>The four ninth grade great martial masters had their arms broken in an instant and were sent flying. He did not even see how Lu Ming had attacked.</p><p>How was that possible? This dying man that they had randomly met on the side of the road was actually this strong. Could he be a martial arts Grandmaster level genius?</p><p>“Did you just say you were going to break my legs?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and walked towards mo Bing.</p><p>Mo Bing’s expression changed drastically, and he could not help but step back as he cried out, ” “What the f * ck are you doing? I’m an elite disciple of the mo family. These servants can’t compare to me. If you dare to touch me, I will make sure you can’t leave su Tiancheng.”</p><p>However, Lu Ming was unmoved. He walked towards mo Bing step by step.</p><p>Mo Bing’s face started to break out in a cold sweat, and his eyes were filled with fear. Finally, he screamed, turned around, and ran.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered coldly. He flicked his fingers and shot out a few streams of energy, which hit mo Bing’s legs.</p><p>Mo Bing screamed and fell to the ground, wailing in pain.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
