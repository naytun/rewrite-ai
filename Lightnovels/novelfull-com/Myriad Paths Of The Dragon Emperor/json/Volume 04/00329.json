It roared and turned to run.</p><p>However, it was too late.</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons roared and a powerful devouring power burst out of its mouth.</p><p>At the same time, the bloodline Dragon twisted its body and, like a bolt of lightning, appeared on the head of the Bloodwater Dragon in an instant. A powerful devouring power enveloped it.</p><p>The bloody water dragon was extremely frightened. It kept roaring and its huge body kept twisting.</p><p>However, the bloodline of the nine Dragons stopped firmly on the head of the blood water dragon and continued to burst out with devouring power.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The bloody water dragon roared. A dragon’s soul was extracted from the body of the blood water dragon.</p><p>The first thing that appeared was the head of the flood Dragon Soul. It kept roaring and tried to shrink back, but it was useless under the devouring of the nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>It was being pulled out bit by bit.</p><p>“What’s going on? What’s going on?”</p><p>An elder of the mo family shouted in disbelief.</p><p>“Kill, kill!”</p><p>The two elders of the mo family gritted their teeth and tried their best to activate the inscription formation in an attempt to get rid of the nine Dragons ‘bloodline and kill Lu Ming.</p><p>Unfortunately, when the giant blood water dragon touched the bloodline of the nine Dragons, it was like a mouse meeting a cat. It did not dare to resist at all.</p><p>The dragon’s soul in the Bloodwater Dragon was continuously extracted. Soon, more than half of it was extracted.</p><p>“Kid, what are you doing? Still not stopping? Hurry up and stop!”</p><p>“You’re trying to ruin the mo family’s thousand-year plan, do you know that? Quickly stop!”</p><p>The two elders of the mo family cried out hysterically.</p><p>“Haha, you two old dogs, you’ve lived so long, have you wasted all your time on dogs? Stop? And then use my own life to complete the mo family’s thousand-year plan? Have your f * cking brains been eaten by dogs?”</p><p>“Also, what’s your mo family’s thousand-year plan? What does it have to do with me? In my eyes, they’re all dog shit!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl. The words of the two mo family elders were too laughable.</p><p>“F * ck you, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>The two mo clan elders ‘shriveled old faces flushed red, and they were so angry that they almost bled.</p><p>They were the mo family’s Grand elders and were usually high and mighty. When had anyone dared to scold them like this?</p><p>“I’ll kill this brat first!”</p><p>An elder of the mo family shouted. He slowed down his control of the inscription formation and was about to pounce on Lu Ming.</p><p>However, the moment he stopped controlling the inscription formation, the elder in the pool of blood went berserk, and the entire underground cave started to shake.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>The elder of the mo family was unwilling, but he could only fly back and continue to control the inscription formation.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this time, the nine Dragon bloodline let out a deafening roar. Its devouring power suddenly increased, and the Dragon Soul in the blood water dragon was pulled out.</p><p>The flood dragon’s soul roared in fear and struggled with all its might.</p><p>“Don’t!”</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>The two elders of the mo family shouted.</p><p>However, the bloodline of the nine Dragons opened its mouth and sucked the flood Dragon Soul into its mouth, disappearing without a trace.</p><p>The nine Dragon bloodline revealed a satisfied expression and flew back into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>”</p><p>The two elders of the mo family started to scream like mad ghosts.</p><p>“Let him go? You guys are thinking too much!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, the underground cave began to shake violently. In the pool of blood, the blood water surged and churned.</p><p>Clang clang</p><p>The sound of iron chains colliding rang out.</p><p>“Not good, quickly suppress old monster Yan Quan!”</p><p>The two elders of the mo family screamed in fear as they tried their best to control the inscription formation to suppress the old man in the blood pool.</p><p>But-</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The next moment, there was an explosion and a figure shot up from the blood pool.</p><p>It was an old man in his 60S. He had a long beard and a burly figure that was more than two meters tall.</p><p>The figure that was tens of meters tall earlier was not his real body. It was a humanoid figure formed by true energy.</p><p>Several arm-thick chains were wrapped around the elder’s body and extended out of the blood pool.</p><p>As the burly old man moved, the iron chains clanged.</p><p>“Not good, Yan Quan is about to escape!”</p><p>The two elders of the mo family shouted in fear.</p><p>hahaha, even the heavens are helping me. Mo family, if I, Yan Quan, don’t destroy your mo family today, I’m not a human!</p><p>The burly old man laughed madly.</p><p>“Kill him, quickly!”</p><p>The two elders of the mo family roared and gave up on controlling the inscription formation. A combat sword appeared in their hands and they slashed at Yan Quan.</p><p>The sword Qi whistled through the air in an extremely shocking manner.</p><p>“Martial ancestor 8-dan peak!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. The cultivation of the two mo family elders was terrifyingly high. They were both at the peak of the eighth level of the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>a mere martial ancestor 8-dan wants to kill me? you’re overestimating yourself!</p><p>Yan Quan laughed and waved his hands. Two terrifying palm forces were sent out toward the two elders of the mo family.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>With two loud bangs, the two elders of the mo family let out a blood-curdling screech as their bodies were sent flying like cannonballs. They crashed heavily into the wall of the cave and spat out large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>Clang clang</p><p>Yan Quan waved his palm, causing the iron chains to collide. There were a total of four iron chains that locked him.</p><p>He was too strong. Even when he was chained up, he was still able to injure two elders of the mo clan who were at the peak of the eighth level of the martial ancestor realm. His strength was so strong that it was shocking.</p><p>“You want to lock me up with a few pieces of scrap metal? break!”</p><p>break! Yan Quan shouted. A terrifying true Qi burst out of his body and he pulled with great force.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The entire cave began to shake violently, and the ground continued to shake, giving off a deep rumble.</p><p>“Not good, Yan Quan is about to break free, quickly go!”</p><p>The two elders of the mo family were so frightened that their faces turned pale. They turned around and ran towards the exit.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Yan Quan suddenly shouted as he grabbed a chain and pulled it.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The iron chain that was as thick as an arm was broken into two.</p><p>This was not an ordinary iron chain, but a rare black iron with inscriptions engraved on it.</p><p>However, it was still broken.</p><p>“You want to leave? Die!”</p><p>Yan Quan let out a shout and waved his arm. A broken chain flew out toward the two mo family elders. It was so fast that it caught up to the two elders in an instant.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>The two elders of the mo family roared and each used their strongest move.</p><p>But the difference was too great.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>With two loud bangs, all the attacks of the two mo clan elders were dispersed, and a section of the iron chain hit them.</p><p>Kachachi</p><p>The sound of bones breaking could be heard. The two mo family elders cried out in pain and flew out. They fell heavily on the ground and were no longer breathing.</p><p>At this moment, the entire mo family was in chaos.</p><p>When Yan Quan pulled out the iron chain, the entire mo family’s land shook violently as if there was an earthquake.</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>Many disciples of the Mohist were panicking.</p><p>The head of the mo family and a few elders had been standing guard in front of the stone house.</p><p>Other than them, there were a few more people.</p><p>One of them was the young prince, Yin Jiufeng. Beside him, there were a few elders with powerful auras.</p><p>At this moment, the mo family head’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>“Not good, there’s a problem underground.”</p><p>The head of the mo family cried out.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
