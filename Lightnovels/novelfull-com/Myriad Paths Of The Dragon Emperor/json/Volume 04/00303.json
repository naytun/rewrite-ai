The skin of the wolves is as hard as iron, and they are extremely fierce. They can run like the wind, and the green scale horses can’t even compare to them. Many of the soldiers who died in this battle were torn apart by the wolves.</p><p>Huaying explained.</p><p>“What about their wolves? how many have we captured?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Not many. These wolves have long been tamed by the Dark Moon Empire with a secret technique. They will not surrender at all, and will only fight to the death. We barely managed to capture a hundred, but we can’t use them at all.”</p><p>Huaying explained.</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his eyebrows.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>A moment later, Lu Ming led the Army and continued on their journey.</p><p>There was nothing much to think about. Lu Ming did not believe that the Army of the Dark Moon Empire was as elite as the ash Wolf Army.</p><p>If they were all elites like this, the burning sun Empire would have been destroyed long ago.</p><p>There shouldn’t be a lot of such an elite army.</p><p>The Army set out and rushed towards Moonview city.</p><p>At this time, the Moonview city might be experiencing a great battle, so they must hurry over as soon as possible to provide support.</p><p>They didn’t guess wrong. A fierce battle was indeed going on in the Moonview city.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>To the North of the Moonview city was a boundless grassland. On the grassland, two armies were engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>On one side was the mountain suppressing Army, which had a total of 80000 people. All of them were cavalrymen, and their momentum was as magnificent as a mountain.</p><p>On the other side was the yinyue Army, which only had 50000 people. However, among these 50000 people, there was one army that was particularly eye-catching.</p><p>This was because each of the cavalrymen was riding a Bloodmoon demonic Tiger.</p><p>This was the Dark Moon Empire’s Bloodmoon demonic Tiger Legion, which was even more powerful than the grey wolf Legion.</p><p>This Bloodmoon demonic Tiger Legion had a total of 10000 people.</p><p>The Dark Moon Empire’s 10000 bloody moon demonic Tiger Army as the vanguard, together with the other 40000 ordinary cavalrymen, were engaged in an intense battle with the 80000 soldiers of the mountain suppressing Army on the boundless Prairie.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of iron cavalry galloped on the grassland, causing the ground to shake.</p><p>A powerful and terrifying aura gathered, stirring up the wind and clouds. The clouds in the sky exploded and were swept away, making it difficult for them to gather.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The sounds of battle shook the heavens as the two steel torrents collided.</p><p>Instantly, killing intent soared into the sky, and all kinds of true Qi swirled wildly. Miserable screams rose and fell, and blood floated in the air, and the smell of blood assailed the nose.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The sound of metal clashing resounded through the plains, and a few moments later, the two armies of steel charged past, leaving behind a trail of corpses.</p><p>“Adjust the direction, hurry!”</p><p>In front of the mountain Army, a burly man in his fifties shouted. He was burly and his hair and beard were all standing up.</p><p>It looked very similar to Ming city.</p><p>He was the general of the mountain Army, the Father of the three Ming siblings, Ming Meng.</p><p>Thump! Dong!</p><p>Under Ming Meng’s lead, the eighty thousand soldiers drew a large arc across the plains and quickly turned around.</p><p>On the other side, the Dark Moon Empire’s Army, under the leadership of their general, also quickly turned around.</p><p>The two armies faced each other again.</p><p>“Armor piercing arrow, fire!”</p><p>Ming Meng roared.</p><p>Close to 80000 cavalrymen took down the armor breaking bow on their mounts and shot arrows.</p><p>Swish Swish Swish</p><p>A dense wave of armor piercing arrows was shot towards the yinyue Army.</p><p>“Fire!”</p><p>On the side of the Dark Moon Empire, arrows were also shot out in an overwhelming manner.</p><p>After shooting the armor piercing arrows, the two armies charged forward madly, charging at each other.</p><p>Ah ah!</p><p>Arrows fell, people screamed, and horses neighed. People were thrown off their horses, and people were killed.</p><p>This was an armor piercing arrow. It could pierce through thick armor and was extremely powerful.</p><p>If an ordinary person were to be shot by an arrow, their entire body would explode.</p><p>With tens of thousands of people shooting arrows at the same time, even a martial Grandmaster would not dare to be careless. If they were not careful, their protective Zhen Qi would be completely consumed by the dense armor-breaking arrows, which would penetrate their defense and kill them.</p><p>Therefore, an ordinary martial arts Grandmaster was not invincible in the face of such a huge Army.</p><p>Once the Army formed a battle formation, it was not impossible to kill a martial Grandmaster. Such things had happened in history.</p><p>After shooting a round of armor piercing arrows, the two sides collided again.</p><p>The first to bear the brunt were the generals of the two sides.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Ming Meng roared. He wielded a two-meter-long blade and slashed out. The world seemed to be split apart as he slashed toward the enemy general.</p><p>Ming Meng’s cultivation had already reached the peak of the sixth level of the martial ancestor realm. He was also a general who had been through hundreds of battles, and his combat strength was extremely strong.</p><p>However, the cultivation of the Dark Moon Empire’s general was not any weaker than his. He was also at the peak of the sixth level martial ancestor realm. The spear in his hand trembled the space as he waved it.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The two of them exchanged a blow, creating a powerful storm that swept up the nearby cavalry and sent them flying hundreds of meters.</p><p>hahaha, Ming Meng, today, I will definitely destroy your Yue zhengarmy and level the Moonview city!</p><p>The enemy general laughed.</p><p>“You’ve been saying this every day, is there any use?”</p><p>Ming Meng snorted coldly.</p><p>However, he had a bad feeling in his heart.</p><p>The Dark Moon Empire’s grey Wolf Army had not appeared, which made Ming Meng worried.</p><p>Although there were only 10000 soldiers from the grey wolf Army, their combat strength was too strong. They could not afford to be careless.</p><p>Although he had left 20000 soldiers to defend the Moonview city, he was still not confident.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>The enemy general laughed and exchanged a few more moves with Ming Meng.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of soldiers charged over, leaving behind a field of corpses.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>A tiger’s roar resounded. The 10000-strong Bloodmoon Devil Tiger Army of the Dark Moon Empire was so powerful that they could bite a piece of the formation of the mountain suppressing Army every time.</p><p>After a few clashes, the mountain suppressing Army had lost thousands of Armored Cavalry.</p><p>Ming Meng’s heart was bleeding. The mountain suppressing Army was a strong Army that he had spent countless efforts and decades to create. It was one of the few powerful armies of the imperial family. Losing even one would make Ming Meng’s heart ache.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Ming Meng’s hair and beard were all standing up, and he was as fierce as a Lion.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At this moment, a violent roar came from the direction of Moonview city.</p><p>The earth was shaking.</p><p>Ming Meng’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>“It’s finally here!”</p><p>The enemy general laughed.</p><p>it’s the grey wolf Army! You asked the grey wolf Army to take a detour around Mount han so that you could launch a sneak attack on Moonview city!</p><p>Ming Meng’s expression changed greatly as he roared.</p><p>haha, that’s right. But it’s too late now. How can the 20000 soldiers you left behind be a match for the grey wolf Army? ”</p><p>The enemy general laughed.</p><p>Ming Meng’s expression was extremely dark. At this time, he was caught in a dilemma.</p><p>If he led the Army back to help, the local forces would definitely chase after him from behind. By then, the grey wolf Army would come to the front and attack him from both sides. The mountain suppressing Army would be in danger.</p><p>But if they didn’t come back, could the Moonview city block the attack of the ash Wolf Army?</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The vibration was getting closer and closer.</p><p>Ming Meng’s expression became uglier and uglier, while the great general of the Dark Moon Empire laughed more and more freely.</p><p>“Haha, today, I’m definitely going to flatten Moonview city, and then lead my Army to break into the blazing sun Kingdom. What’s going on?”</p><p>The Dark Moon Empire’s great general started to laugh arrogantly and carefreely, but his expression immediately changed.</p><p>Because that Army did not attack the full moon City, but instead rushed towards the yin Yue Empire’s Army.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
