He also wanted to find a city to settle down. Otherwise, he would not be in the mood to cultivate at night.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming had agreed, Song Yu and Song Jing were overjoyed.</p><p>Immediately, the three of them continued along the mountain range.</p><p>Tens of thousands of miles passed by in a flash. After that, he finally walked out of the forest.</p><p>After the forest was a plain.</p><p>The three of them flew for a few more hours before a small city finally appeared in front of them.</p><p>The three of them were overjoyed and hurriedly flew over.</p><p>The small city was not big, only a few miles in radius.</p><p>“There are people in the city!”</p><p>Song Jing whispered.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest saw it too. It seemed that someone had arrived at the city earlier.</p><p>On the city wall, there were about a dozen people standing.</p><p>Outside the city, there were one or two people who seemed to be talking to the people on the city wall, but they were too far away to hear clearly.</p><p>The three of them flew directly toward the city.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>However, when the three of them approached the city, a few sharp sword Qi shot towards them.</p><p>The three of them changed their expressions and stopped abruptly. They dodged the sword Qi and stared at the city wall with unsightly expressions.</p><p>The sword Qi just now had come from the city wall.</p><p>“What are you guys doing? Why are you stopping us from entering the city?”</p><p>Song Yu shouted.</p><p>hehe, you can enter the city if you pay 10 million spiritual crystals each!</p><p>A young man on the city wall sneered.</p><p>This young man was wearing a black robe with a skull embroidered on it.</p><p>In fact, the other dozen or so youths on the city wall were all dressed in the same way. They were all wearing black skeletal robes, and they were obviously from the same force.</p><p>10000000 spiritual crystals! You’re clearly trying to loot a burning house!</p><p>Song Yu shouted.</p><p>“Robbery? Don’t make it sound so bad. This is called a refugee fee. If you pay spiritual crystals, you can take refuge in the city!”</p><p>The previous black-robed Skeleton Man laughed.</p><p>“On what basis? This city is a public place, why should we pay you shelter fees?”</p><p>At the bottom of the city wall, there were two young men who had arrived earlier than Lu Ming and the rest. They were shouting loudly.</p><p>“On what basis? Just because we are stronger, just because we are the disciples of the nether demon Palace. Hurry up and hand it over. If you don’t, then get lost. If you don’t, then you will end up like that!”</p><p>The skeletal black-robed youth shouted coldly and pointed into the distance.</p><p>Everyone looked over and saw a few corpses. They were all young men.</p><p>those who have paid the spiritual crystals have all gone in to rest. Those who didn’t pay the spiritual crystals and still want to break in can only end up like this!</p><p>The black-robed skeletal man shouted coldly.</p><p>The two young men, as well as Song Yu and Song Jing, had extremely ugly expressions on their faces.</p><p>The disciples of the nether demon Palace were too overbearing.</p><p>Furthermore, the ten over disciples of the nether demon Palace were all emitting a powerful aura.</p><p>There were a total of 13 people, and six of them exuded the aura of a peak 5th level martial ancestor.</p><p>The other seven people were all in the sixth level of the martial ancestor realm. Two of them even exuded the aura of a peak sixth level martial ancestor realm expert.</p><p>Those who could enter the eastern nether ancient battlefield were all geniuses and could fight at least two levels above them.</p><p>Some could even exceed two levels.</p><p>This was an extremely powerful force. Even the weakest among them could be ranked on the Emperor Yun list in the 36 countries.</p><p>The two strongest youths were at the peak of the sixth level of the martial ancestor realm. They were definitely not weaker than LAN Yundao.</p><p>As for Song Yu and Song Jing, they were only in the early stage of the fifth level martial Grandmaster realm. The other two young men were only in the late stage of the fifth level martial Grandmaster realm. The difference was too great.</p><p>At this moment, should he retreat or advance?</p><p>If they retreated, they would have to face countless spirits at night, and there might be even more bizarre things. Only death would await them.</p><p>However, if they entered, each person would have to pay almost 10 million spiritual crystals.</p><p>10 million spiritual crystals was a huge sum even for martial arts grandmasters like them. Although they could afford it, it would hurt their bones.</p><p>“We’ll pay!”</p><p>The other two young men hesitated for a moment and finally made a decision. They gritted their teeth, took out a storage ring each, and handed it to the black-robed skeleton.</p><p>The black-robed skeletal man examined it and revealed a satisfied smile. “At least you know what’s good for you. Go in!”</p><p>The two young men had ugly expressions as they flew into the city.</p><p>“Let’s hand it over too!”</p><p>Song Yu let out a long sigh and said.</p><p>“Pay? I don’t have the habit of giving spirit crystals to others for free.”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>This sentence naturally reached the ears of the black-robed skeleton.</p><p>The black-robed skeletal man who had been talking earlier looked at Lu Ming with a cold gaze and said, kid, if you don’t want to pay up, then get out of here. Don’t be an eyesore. Otherwise, I don’t mind killing you.</p><p>He could see Song Yu, Song Jing, and Lu Ming’s cultivation levels clearly. They were all trash in the early stage of the fifth level of the martial ancestor realm. He did not care about them at all.</p><p>“Get lost? You’re the ones who want to get out of here. Now, get out of here. I want this city!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>Everyone present was stunned.</p><p>What did Lu Ming say? He wanted the people of the nether demon Palace to scram? He wanted to occupy this city?</p><p>Crazy, crazy, this kid must be crazy.</p><p>Even song Yu and Song Jing were shocked.</p><p>What was Lu Ming doing? Could it be that he wanted to fight against the people from the nether demon Palace? but it was impossible for him to win.</p><p>Although they knew that Lu Ming’s force was extremely powerful, even stronger than a perfected force.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s cultivation was only at the early phase of the fifth level of martial arts Grandmaster realm. No matter how strong his combat strength was, even if he was a rare third-level genius, it was impossible for him to be a match for these people from the nether demon Palace.</p><p>There was actually a common term for those geniuses who could cross levels and fight. They were called ” the genius of a few battles.</p><p>For example, those who could cross one level to fight were called geniuses of one battle, those who could cross two levels to fight were called geniuses of two battles, and those who could cross three levels to fight were called geniuses of three battles.</p><p>Of course, the cross-level battle here was only within the martial arts Grandmaster realm.</p><p>As for the other realms, they weren’t called that.</p><p>The majority of the peerless geniuses were second-rate geniuses.</p><p>There were very few people who could surpass a World War Two genius.</p><p>And those who could reach the level of three battle geniuses were even rarer.</p><p>For example, LAN Yundao, li qiushui, and even young master Tian she were in between World War Two and World War Three.</p><p>Lu Ming speculated that Jian Fengyun might be a three-man genius.</p><p>“Kid, what did you say?”</p><p>The black-robed Skeleton Man thought he had heard wrong.</p><p>“I told you to get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming repeated.</p><p>“Hahaha, you want us to get lost? Just based on a piece of trash in the early stage of martial ancestor realm Level 5, you’re dead for sure today. Even if you’re a genius, you’ll still die today. Kill him!”</p><p>The black-robed skeletal man waved his hand.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Immediately, a disciple of the nether demon Palace flew out and a sharp sword light was aimed at Lu Ming’s throat.</p><p>This young man had a cultivation at the peak of the fifth level of the martial arts Grandmaster realm. He was a World War Two genius. Unless Lu Ming was a World War Three genius, he would definitely die.</p><p>“You’re the one who’s going to die!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly and took a step forward. At the same time, a Spear’s gleam burst out.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The spear light directly pierced through the chest of the YouMo Palace youth.</p><p>The youngster from the nether demon Palace cried out in pain as his body was sent flying by the spear light. With a clang, he was stuck on the city wall.</p><p>A single spear had killed a fifth level peak martial ancestor realm genius.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
