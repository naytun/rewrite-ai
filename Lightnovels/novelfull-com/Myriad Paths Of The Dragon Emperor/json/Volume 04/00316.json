The key was that there were too many of them.</p><p>Battle Spears and battle swords were piled up like mountains, emitting a cold luster.</p><p>The armors were piled up higher than a mountain, and the pills in the Jade bottles were also piled up like a mountain.</p><p>There were too many of them.</p><p>Lu Ming estimated that there were at least hundreds of thousands of sets of spirit weapons and armors.</p><p>This was simply an Armory.</p><p>Lu Ming picked up some of them and noticed that most of them were second-level spiritual weapons. There were a few third-level spiritual weapons and not many fourth-level ones.</p><p>“This is the energy gathering pill and the energy breaking pill!”</p><p>When Lu Ming checked the pills, he was shocked at first, then he was excited and overjoyed.</p><p>The energy gathering pill could allow martial artists of the warrior realm or even master realm to quickly increase their cultivation.</p><p>The origin breakthrough pill, on the other hand, could allow one to break through to the next realm.</p><p>The grade of the pills was not high. Most of them were level two pills, which were useless for martial grandmasters. However, there were too many of them.</p><p>It was no wonder that Lu Ming was so excited. These items could be equipped with a huge Army.</p><p>How could there be so many low-level items in the storage ring of a martial King?</p><p>After that, Lu Ming thought about it and understood.</p><p>The Dongyi tribe had once occupied a vast territory and established an Empire.</p><p>Most of the territories of the blazing sun Empire, the yinyue Empire, and even the blood Zhao Empire now belonged to the Dongyi tribe.</p><p>The Dongyi tribe used to be a true mid-tier Empire, but it was destroyed later on.</p><p>The Dongyi ancestor’s storage ring was filled with so many low-level spiritual weapons and elixirs. He must have wanted to build an army in the future and rebuild the Dongyi Empire.</p><p>However, it died before it could be realized. Now, Lu Ming had gained all the benefits.</p><p>“Hahaha, I’ve really worn out my iron shoes searching high and low for it, and now I’ve found it without any effort. Good, very good. If the bloodscaled Wolf cavalry and the other soldiers are all equipped, their strength will definitely increase greatly.”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming left the Supreme shrine and gathered his Deputy general, Deputy general, and dozens of other people.</p><p>When Lu Ming used some empty storage rings to store the spirit weapons, armors, and pills separately and showed them to the Deputy general and Deputy general, they were all petrified.</p><p>All of them widened their eyes and their mouths. They looked at Lu Ming in disbelief and shock, not moving an inch.</p><p>It was only after a long while that they finally reacted, and their bodies trembled with excitement.</p><p>“General, these, these are all yours?”</p><p>Huaying swallowed her saliva.</p><p>“Of course. Otherwise, do you think I robbed them? alright, these spirit weapons and armors, give each of them a set. Distribute these pills to increase their strength. Pay attention, the thirty thousand red blood scaled Wolf cavalry must focus on this. I want them to break through to the Martial Master realm as soon as possible.”</p><p>Lu Ming instructed.</p><p>His goal was to make the thirty thousand red blood scaled Wolf cavalry all reach the Martial Master realm.</p><p>Only then would they be able to display the true power of the bloodscale Wolf cavalry.</p><p>Of course, he only gave 80000 sets of spirit weapons and armors, and he kept the rest for now.</p><p>As for the secret manuals, they were some low-level martial arts techniques and battle formations. They were suitable for killing on the battlefield and would not be of use in the short term. Lu Ming did not give them away.</p><p>Huaying and the others went out happily.</p><p>Not long after, when Lu Ming’s men were all equipped with new equipment, everyone in the mountain suppressing Army was shocked.</p><p>It was too shocking. Lu Ming’s weapons were all second-level spiritual weapons and armors.</p><p>Lv 2 was the same as a Martial Master. If a warrior realm warrior put on a Lv 2 spiritual transformation armor, his combat power and life-preservation ability would definitely increase by a large margin.</p><p>As for the elites, they were all equipped with Level 3 equipment.</p><p>Soon, everyone found out that all of the equipment had been given to them by tianyun.</p><p>The eyes of the soldiers of the mountain suppressing Army turned red with envy.</p><p>They realized that the treatment of the soldiers following Lu Ming was too good. First, they had the bloodred scaled Wolf. Now, even their equipment had a new look.</p><p>If not for the military regulations, they would have been willing to join tianyun.</p><p>After Ming Meng found out, he laughed bitterly.</p><p>From then on, every soldier under Lu Ming was using the essence gathering pill and essence breaking pill to increase their cultivation at a crazy rate.</p><p>During this period of time, the Dark Moon Empire seemed to have remained silent and did not make any other moves.</p><p>Time flew by and half a month passed.</p><p>In the past half a month, the strength of the bloodscale Wolf cavalry had been increasing at a crazy rate.</p><p>The Scarlet blood scaled Wolf cavalry originally had around five thousand Martial Master realm cultivators.</p><p>The rest were mostly eighth and ninth grade martial Warriors.</p><p>In the past half a month, they had all been improving at a crazy rate.</p><p>Some of the ninth grade martial warrior realm soldiers had been stuck there for a long time, but with the help of the origin breakthrough pill, they managed to break through their bottlenecks and enter the Martial Master realm.</p><p>In just half a month, more than ten thousand people had broken through to the Martial Master realm.</p><p>As for the others, almost all of them had advanced by one or even two levels.</p><p>A pill that could be left behind by a martial King might not be of a high grade, but it was still extraordinary. It was the foundation of the Dongyi martial King’s plan to build a strong Army in a short period of time. Naturally, the effects of the pill were amazing, beyond Lu Ming’s expectations.</p><p>“This is great! If this continues, the thirty thousand red blood scaled Wolf cavalry will all reach the Martial Master realm in less than a month.”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed and he distributed the pills without any hesitation.</p><p>The pills in the martial King’s storage ring were prepared for the 500000-strong Army, and they were never to be used up.</p><p>At this time, news came from Ming Meng that there had been some strange movements in the dark Moon Empire.</p><p>Sure enough, three days later, the six hundred thousand troops of the Dark Moon Empire covered the sky and the earth as they launched an attack on the territory of the ghost moon saber sect.</p><p>For a time, a great battle ensued.</p><p>After Lu Ming received the news, he did not hesitate and set off with thirty thousand blood red scaled Wolf cavalry.</p><p>This was the perfect time to test the combat power of the bloodscale wolves.</p><p>This battle shocked the entire burning sun Empire and the Dark Moon Empire.</p><p>The 30,000 blood red iron cavalry that Lu Ming led were practically invincible.</p><p>In this battle, the first opponent of the blood-red scaled wolves cavalry was the Dark Moon Empire’s grey Wolf Army.</p><p>The 50,000 Grey Wolf Army was completely powerless against the blood red Cavalry’s attack.</p><p>The fifty thousand soldiers of the ash Wolf Army were almost completely annihilated.</p><p>In this way, 70000 of the Dark Moon Empire’s ash Wolf Army had been destroyed by Lu Ming. They were completely crippled.</p><p>Soon after, the Dark Moon Empire sent out an extremely powerful Legion, the wild lion Legion.</p><p>The berserk Lion Legion had a total of 100000 soldiers, and their combat strength was even stronger than the ash Wolf Legion.</p><p>This battle was incomparably brutal.</p><p>In the end, the result was the same. The thirty thousand Scarlet blood scaled Wolf cavalry had defeated the one hundred thousand berserk Lion Legion in one fell swoop, and almost all of them had been killed.</p><p>For a time, tianyun’s name and the Scarlet blood scaled Wolf cavalry’s name shook the burning sun Empire and the Dark Moon Empire.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
