Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, another sound of something breaking through the air could be heard.</p><p>“Qiu changkong is here!”</p><p>“And the strongest Dark Horse, Prince Huo Ling!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming looked up and saw a few figures flying down from the sky.</p><p>One of them was very young, about 21 or 22 years old. He wore a fiery red robe and had eyes like lightning. He had a powerful aura and his hands were behind his back.</p><p>This man must be young master Huo Ling.</p><p>The other person had a sword on his back. If he wasn’t Qiu changkong, who else could he be?</p><p>Qiu changkong’s eyes were filled with killing intent the moment he saw Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I don’t know how you got the invitation. You could’ve lived a little longer if you didn’t participate in the Ditian Divine Guard selection. Now that you’re here, you’re just looking for death. After the preliminaries, it’ll be your death when the real selection competition begins!”</p><p>Qiu changkong’s eyes were cold as he kept thinking.</p><p>Naturally, he had heard of the news that Lu Ming had defeated yang Liuji. At first, he was extremely shocked.</p><p>They were shocked by Lu Ming’s invitation and his ability.</p><p>However, he was only a little shocked at the beginning and did not have any fear.</p><p>He had ten percent confidence that he could kill Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Qiu changkong, his eyes filled with killing intent.</p><p>He had to kill Qiu changkong!</p><p>Lu Yuntian’s eight years of torture were all thanks to Qiu changkong.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of air being torn could be heard from time to time as people kept coming.</p><p>Not long after, Jiang hongwen, who was ranked third on the cloud Emperor ranking, and young master Tian she, who was ranked second, arrived together, pushing the atmosphere to a climax.</p><p>Young master Tian she was wearing a green robe. His face was gloomy and his eyes were cold. He was like a venomous snake that was about to devour people. Anyone who was targeted by him would feel a chill.</p><p>Jiang hongwen was tall and had a majestic and domineering aura, which was the complete opposite of young master Tian she.</p><p>Up until now, there were nearly 600 people in the square. Each and every one of them was a Dragon among men and had extraordinary auras. When they were gathered together, it was extremely spectacular.</p><p>“Jian Fengyun isn’t here yet, could he be dead? Hehe!”</p><p>Suddenly, a cold voice was heard. It was young master Tian she.</p><p>Everyone couldn’t help but look at him.</p><p>how could Jian Fengyun die if you, a venomous snake, didn’t die? ”</p><p>Not far away, Jiang hongwen sneered.</p><p>Many people’s expressions changed slightly.</p><p>There were not many people on the cloud Emperor list who dared to speak to young master Tian she in such a manner.</p><p>LAN Yundao was ranked fifth and was arrogant. However, in front of young master Tian she, he had to be obedient.</p><p>hehe, I heard that Jian Fengyun went to another region for training. It’s normal for him to die outside!</p><p>Young master Tian she smiled sinisterly.</p><p>Jian Fengyun was the number one genius on Emperor Yun’s board and the top expert among the younger generation in Emperor Yun’s 36 kingdoms.</p><p>“Haha, Wei tianshe, I’m afraid I’ll have to disappoint you!”</p><p>At this time, a loud laugh came from the distance.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A sword light cut through the air at an unbelievable speed.</p><p>He was clearly ten miles away a moment ago, but in the next moment, he was already in the sky above the square.</p><p>The sword light dispersed, and a young figure appeared.</p><p>He was about twenty-four or twenty-five years old, wearing a long gray robe. He had a slender figure and bright eyes.</p><p>He looked like an unsheathed divine sword.</p><p>The most eye-catching part was the long scar on his face, which looked very ferocious.</p><p>“Jian Fengyun, you’re finally here!”</p><p>Young master Tian she’s eyes moved, revealing a trace of solemness.</p><p>He was Jian Fengyun, who was ranked first on the cloud Emperor board.</p><p>There was a burst of excited discussion.</p><p>“Eh? Why was there a scar on Jian Fengyun’s face? I didn’t have it before!”</p><p>who is so powerful that he could leave a scar on Jian Fengyun’s face? ”</p><p>Whispers could be heard from nearby.</p><p>“Wei tianshe, I’m here. Are you very disappointed?”</p><p>Jian Fengyun looked at young master Tian she and said.</p><p>what’s there to be disappointed about? you’ve come at the right time. This time, I’m going to defeat you completely!</p><p>Young master Tian she sneered. Then, his eyes flickered and he said, ” “Jian Fengyun, I heard that you went to another region for training. You’ve been injured by someone. This is too embarrassing!”</p><p>what’s there to be embarrassed about? I was injured by the geniuses there when I was training in the thousand River region. I have to tell you that the geniuses from other regions are far stronger than those in the cloud Emperor mountain range!</p><p>Jian Fengyun said frankly.</p><p>This made young master Tian she, Jiang Hong Wen, and the other geniuses ‘faces turn grave.</p><p>Jian Fengyun, what’s your ranking in the thousand River region? ”</p><p>Young master Tian she asked.</p><p>“18th place!”</p><p>Jian Fengyun said word by word.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>As soon as he said that, the entire place was in an uproar.</p><p>The No. 1 genius of the cloud Emperor mountain range was defeated by the No. 18 genius of the thousand river water region and had a scar on his face. How was this possible?</p><p>Was the thousand River region really that powerful?</p><p>haha, Jian Fengyun, in my opinion, it’s not that the opponent is too strong. It’s that you’re too weak. It seems that you’ve regressed in the past few years. This time, I’ll surpass you completely.</p><p>Young master Tian she laughed out loud.</p><p>He didn’t believe that the thousand River region was that powerful.</p><p>If the 18th place could defeat Jian Fengyun, didn’t that mean that there were at least 18 geniuses who were above him, young master Tian she?</p><p>This was only the waters of the thousand rivers. What about the regions?</p><p>With young master Tian she’s pride, he would never believe that so many geniuses would surpass him.</p><p>He thought that Jian Fengyun was too weak to move forward.</p><p>Many people also secretly nodded and were more willing to believe young master Tian she’s words.</p><p>“Frog in the well!” Jian Fengyun smiled faintly and did not bother to say anything else.</p><p>Young master Tian she snorted coldly and stood at the side.</p><p>By now, the number of people had reached six hundred.</p><p>Ka ka!</p><p>At this moment, the gate of the Emperor heaven divine Palace opened, and a few figures walked out.</p><p>The leader of the group was an old man with white hair and wearing a black robe.</p><p>The old man had a kind expression on his face. There was no aura fluctuation on his body, as if he was an ordinary person who had not cultivated.</p><p>However, no one dared to underestimate him because he was a member of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace.</p><p>it seems that everyone is here. Let me introduce myself. My name is Lu Xiu, and I’m the host of this preliminaries. I’ll also be leading you to the real selection later!</p><p>The old man introduced himself.</p><p>“Greetings, senior Lu.”</p><p>The geniuses on the square all saluted.</p><p>Lu Xiu nodded. alright, let’s cut the chit-chat and come with me. This isn’t the venue for the preliminaries!</p><p>After saying that, Lu Xiu rose into the air and flew towards the North.</p><p>The participating geniuses on the square also rose into the air and followed.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other three were mixed in the crowd and did not stand out.</p><p>The people around the square sighed and felt it was a pity.</p><p>He would not be able to see the exciting content after that.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
