Junior Brother feiye, go and check it out. See what’s going on. Find Junior Brother feishi and ask him to bring The White Tiger key as soon as possible and meet us!</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The big-nosed young man cupped his fists and was about to leave.</p><p>At this moment, a voice sounded, ” “No need, your junior brothers won’t be able to come!”</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>The big-nosed youngster, you feiye, shouted coldly.</p><p>You Feiyu and the others could not help but look at the tunnel on the left.</p><p>A young man who wasn’t even twenty years old walked out.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>“Brother Lu!”</p><p>Coldflow wood, ye Tiannan, and the others all exclaimed when they saw this young man.</p><p>The young man was Lu Ming.</p><p>He followed the path in the herb field and came here. When he arrived, he heard the conversation between you Feiyu and the others.</p><p>“It’s you? Kid, you’re still alive?”</p><p>The big-nosed young man shouted coldly.</p><p>of course I’m still alive. Are you blind? ”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips and berated.</p><p>“You win!”</p><p>The big-nosed young man’s breathing stagnated. His eyes were filled with killing intent as he said, ” kid, it seems like you feishi and the others didn’t find you. They let you escape, but you barged in here. This is really fate, no one can save you!</p><p>“Hurry up, hand over The White Tiger key and I can give you a quick death!”</p><p>The big-nosed young man rebuked with an arrogant and haughty expression.</p><p>“There was a big guy just now who was as arrogant as you. In the end, I sent him on his way. It seems that I will send you on your way too!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly, a murderous intent flashing in his eyes.</p><p>“What? You killed you feishi? I’d like to see how much you’re worth!”</p><p>The big-nosed young man took a step forward. His sword-light flashed and a cold sword-light slashed towards Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>It was as fast as lightning.</p><p>In the early stage of martial ancestor 8-stage, this big-nosed youth was not inferior to you feishi.</p><p>With a flick of his finger, the demon subduing spear appeared in his hand. Lu Ming was about to swing the spear.</p><p>At this time, the stone egg hanging in his hair suddenly flew out and turned into the size of a human head. It directly ignored the sword light and rushed past, then smashed fiercely at the big-nosed young man’s face.</p><p>It hit the big-nosed young man’s nose precisely.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>A sound that made one’s teeth ache was heard. The big-nosed young man screamed and fell to the ground.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The stone egg flew back and floated in front of Lu Ming. It bounced around like a naughty ball.</p><p>He seemed to be extremely excited.</p><p>“This f * ck!”</p><p>Lu Ming was tongue-tied and dumbfounded.</p><p>You Feiyu, Coldflow wood, and the others were also dumbfounded.</p><p>This works too?</p><p>What kind of stone was this? Lu Ming threw a stone and it injured the big-nosed young man with one hit. What kind of treasure was this?</p><p>At that moment, the big-nosed young man was lying on the ground, screaming in pain.</p><p>It was terrible. His face was covered in blood, and the area around his nose had completely caved in. Even his facial features could not be seen clearly.</p><p>Everyone broke out in a cold sweat as they watched. It was really tragic!</p><p>“This stone egg Gu!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He reached out to hold the stone egg, but he did not expect it to be so lively. It jumped a few times in the air and landed on Lu Ming’s shoulder. Lu Ming could not feel any weight at all.</p><p>“Haha, this stone egg is so intelligent. What is it?”</p><p>Lu Ming was even more curious. He suddenly felt that the entire pill had not been wasted.</p><p>“Let’s attack together. Be careful of that stone egg!”</p><p>You Feiyu gave the order and looked at the stone egg on Lu Ming’s shoulder with a grave expression.</p><p>He wasn’t confident that he could defeat the big-nosed young man with one strike.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In a flash, the disciples of the dark Demon Palace surrounded Lu Ming and looked at the stone egg with fear.</p><p>No one wanted to be attacked. As for Lu Ming, they had ignored him.</p><p>As for Coldflow wood and the rest, their eyes shone with hope.</p><p>They were in despair. Even though Lu Ming had arrived, they still did not have much hope. They knew that Lu Ming’s combat strength was similar to theirs.</p><p>It was impossible for them to be a match for the many experts from the nether demon Palace.</p><p>However, they did not expect Lu Ming to suddenly throw out a stone egg and knock out the big-nosed young man with one blow. This gave them hope.</p><p>The stone egg on his shoulder glowed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, the stone egg flew out again and smashed down on a martial arts Grandmaster 7-dan genius.</p><p>The genius was shocked. He roared and used all his strength.</p><p>The power of his bloodline and true Qi burst out without regard for his life, laying out more than a dozen defenses.</p><p>However, it was useless!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The stone egg instantly passed through these defenses and smashed into the young man’s head.</p><p>The young man screamed as his head split open like a watermelon. He fell to the ground and died.</p><p>A one-hit kill!</p><p>Everyone gasped.</p><p>Especially those from the nether demon Palace, their faces were filled with fear.</p><p>Even you Feiyu was shocked and fearful.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! After the stone egg killed one person, it flew back to Lu Ming’s shoulder and jumped around excitedly.</p><p>let’s attack together. That stone egg can only deal with one person at a time. Let’s attack together and kill this bastard. That stone egg will become ownerless, and we won’t have to fear it anymore!</p><p>You Feiyu shouted.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Kill!”</p><p>A total of seventy to eighty disciples of the YouMo Palace charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Immediately, seventy to eighty sword Qi enveloped Lu Ming from all directions.</p><p>The space immediately boiled and was thrown into chaos by the sword Qi.</p><p>The power of seventy to eighty geniuses attacking together was too shocking.</p><p>“Then all of you shall die!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with murderous intent.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The second blood Meridian burst out, causing Lu Ming’s strength to increase greatly.</p><p>At the same time, the bloodline of the nine Dragons flew out, opened its mouth, and roared.</p><p>A terrifying devouring power burst forth and enveloped the disciples of the nether demon Palace.</p><p>He was instantly stunned.</p><p>“Argh, not good, my bloodline strength is going to leave my body!”</p><p>“The blood essence is unstable, it’s about to rush out of my body!”</p><p>The disciple of the nether demon Palace let out a terrified roar. In an instant, the sword light was in chaos.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming’s cultivation had improved greatly and his nine Dragon bloodline had risen three levels in a row, how terrifying was the devouring power?</p><p>Those whose cultivation levels were lower than Lu Ming’s almost lost control of their Blood Meridian power and were devoured. They could not even unleash much of their combat strength.</p><p>“Nine Dragons trampling the heavens!”</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming cast the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The entire space shook.</p><p>Then-</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The disciples of the nether demon Palace exploded like rotten sweet potatoes, and their blood essence flew into the mouths of the nine Dragons.</p><p>Eighty-one people. With this kick, a total of eighty-one people were killed.</p><p>Only you Feiyu and the other two disciples of the nether demon Palace were still alive.</p><p>The three of them were all at least in the eighth level of the martial ancestor realm, but they were all half-dead.</p><p>Even you Feiyu was the same. The number one genius of the nether demon Palace had reached the middle of the eighth level of the martial Grandmaster realm. His combat strength had even surpassed that of a genius of three battles.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s kick still left him severely injured. He knelt on the ground and vomited blood.</p><p>“How could this be? How did this happen?”</p><p>You Feiyu shouted hysterically, as if he had gone crazy.</p><p>He found it hard to accept all this.</p><p>In just one move, the most elite group of people from the nether demon Palace had all died.</p><p>How could he be so strong?</p><p>Back then, when the disciples of the nether demon Palace used the shadow exterminating talisman to transmit the images, Lu Ming was far from being this powerful.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
