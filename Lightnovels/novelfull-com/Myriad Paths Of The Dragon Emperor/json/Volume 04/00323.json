Someone actually dared to break his leg? who was this person?</p><p>Many people sized Lu Ming up and guessed secretly.</p><p>“What are you shouting for? Now, get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted angrily.</p><p>As if they had been granted Amnesty, the four burly men struggled to get up, supported mo Bing with their other hand, and ran away.</p><p>Lu Ming did not care and continued to stroll on the streets.</p><p>After strolling around for a while, he walked back.</p><p>Just as she returned to mo Ying’s courtyard, she met mo Ying.</p><p>“Brother Lu, how are your injuries?”</p><p>Mo Ying asked.</p><p>“I’m almost done.” Lu Ming nodded and smiled.</p><p>“Then, that, that!”</p><p>Mo Ying stammered and stopped.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look at the essential Qi in your body.” Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Good, good!”</p><p>Mo Ying was overjoyed.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming and Mo Ying came to her bedroom.</p><p>Mo Ying’s bedroom was elegantly decorated and had a faint fragrance.</p><p>The two of them sat cross-legged on the bed.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming and Mo Ying’s palms pressed against each other. Lu Ming transferred a stream of essential Qi into mo Ying’s body.</p><p>Mo Ying’s genuine Qi was strong and condensed, and it was extremely cold.</p><p>However, within the cold true Qi, there were traces of hot true Qi that were intertwined with the cold true Qi.</p><p>As a result, mo Ying’s Zhen Qi was not pure, which would greatly interfere with her cultivation. Sometimes, the cold and heat would alternate, which was extremely painful.</p><p>Only by removing the burning genuine Qi could mo Ying’s restraint be removed. At that time, mo Ying’s cultivation speed would be even faster.</p><p>“Eh? It’s indeed the true Qi produced by the cloud Dragon. It’s actually in the shape of a Dragon!”</p><p>Lu Ming realized that mo Ying’s cold and hot vital energy had formed the shape of a Dragon, like small dragons entwining together.</p><p>It was very similar to the true Qi cultivated from the true war Dragon technique, but the Dragon-shaped true Qi cultivated from the true war Dragon technique was more realistic and vivid.</p><p>After observing for a while, Lu Ming retracted his essential Qi.</p><p>“Brother Lu, how is it? Can it expel the Yang-attribute true Qi?”</p><p>Mo Ying asked nervously.</p><p>This concerned her future path of martial arts, so he was naturally nervous.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. there shouldn’t be any major problems. The two types of essential Qi are intertwined too deeply. It’s not something that can be completely expelled in one or two days. I estimate that it will take about ten days.</p><p>“It’s okay, it’s okay. It’s worth it no matter how much time I spend.”</p><p>Mo Ying said excitedly.</p><p>She had already endured it for more than ten years, so why would she care about ten days?</p><p>Thereafter, Lu Ming placed his palm on mo Jue’s spine and channeled essential Qi.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Cloud Dragon that was as white as Jade emerged from Mo Yi’s body and roared at Lu Ming.</p><p>“How audacious!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and the nine Dragon bloodline emerged.</p><p>It was clearly in the shape of a Python, but when the cloud Dragon saw the bloodline of the nine Dragons, it seemed to be terrified. With a wail, it directly sank into mo Ying’s back and didn’t dare to move.</p><p>“Swallow!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm exuded a powerful devouring force. As he pressed it against mo Ying’s back, the devouring force gushed out. The Yang-type true Qi in mo Ying’s true Qi was instantly extracted and refined by Lu Ming, as if he was extracting silk from a cocoon.</p><p>Wisps of it, although not very fast, were very stable.</p><p>Mo Ying’s delicate body trembled slightly, and fine beads of sweat oozed out of her body.</p><p>Two hours later, Lu Ming stopped.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Mo Ying let out a long breath, then carefully observed her own true Qi, and then trembled with excitement.</p><p>“It’s really stripped, it’s really stripped!”</p><p>Mo Ying turned around excitedly and looked at Lu Ming with excitement and gratitude.</p><p>“This time, I’ve only extracted a portion of it. It looks like it’ll take another eight or nine days.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Thank you, Lu Ming!”</p><p>Mo Ying had already forgotten her awkwardness and was extremely excited. The problem that had troubled her for so many years was finally going to be solved.</p><p>“Then we’ll continue tomorrow!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“En, good!”</p><p>Mo Ying nodded happily.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming would spend two hours a day to help mo Ying extract the Yang-type essential Qi.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, seven days had passed, and the Yang-type true Qi in mo Ying’s body had almost been stripped away.</p><p>Mo Ying circulated her true Qi, and her speed instantly increased by several times. It was extremely smooth, and she even broke through a realm in one go, reaching the second grade of martial ancestor realm.</p><p>On the eighth day, just as Lu Ming was stripping away the remaining yang-type essential Qi for mo Ying, there was a sudden noise and screams from outside.</p><p>young prince, miss Ying is really cultivating!</p><p>Mo Ying’s servants called out.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
