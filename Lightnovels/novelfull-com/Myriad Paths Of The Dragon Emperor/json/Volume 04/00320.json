When he reappeared, he was already ten miles away.</p><p>Ten miles in a step!</p><p>This was the terrifying power of the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps. Moreover, Lu Ming had only cultivated the first step.</p><p>According to the records of the nine Dragons heaven-trampling steps, if one cultivated it to the highest realm, one would be like Nine Dragons. One step would allow one to travel hundreds of millions of miles, and the power would be unimaginable.</p><p>Lu Ming was still far from it.</p><p>“Damn it, you can’t leave!”</p><p>The assassin from the shadow Wolf Pavilion bellowed and chased after Lu Ming at high speed.</p><p>To a martial Grandmaster, a distance of five kilometers was something that could be covered in a few breaths.</p><p>Without thinking, Lu Ming took another step forward.</p><p>His figure flashed like the wind and lightning, and he crossed another ten miles under his feet.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s body trembled and he spat out another mouthful of blood.</p><p>He had already been severely injured, and using the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps had taken a huge toll on him. The pressure from the heavens and earth was also immense, which made his injuries even more severe.</p><p>The difference was too great. It was impossible for him to fight them head-on, so he could only escape.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The shadow Wolf Pavilion’s assassins were in hot pursuit, their killing intent surging like the tide.</p><p>At the back, the Golden-eyed blood corpse was holding Yuan que back for a double kill.</p><p>“Tianyun, hand over your martial skill and I’ll leave your corpse intact!”</p><p>The assassin from the shadow Wolf Pavilion shouted.</p><p>The martial arts technique that Lu Ming displayed was too shocking. He was very envious. If he could get it, what level would his combat strength reach?</p><p>His killing intent toward Lu Ming grew stronger.</p><p>“Laughable. If you have the ability, come and get it yourself!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and took another step forward.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Heaven and earth trembled slightly. Lu Ming’s body was like a bolt of lightning, streaking across the void. In the blink of an eye, he was ten miles away, putting some distance between him and the shadow Wolf Pavilion’s assassin.</p><p>damn it, damn it! I don’t believe that you can use such a powerful martial technique in succession. Today, you must die!</p><p>The shadow Wolf Pavilion’s assassin roared. A giant black Wolf rose from his body and chased after Lu Ming with all his might.</p><p>With every step Lu Ming took, he would catch his breath and take another step. And it was these two breaths that allowed the other party to catch up to him.</p><p>Just like that, one chased and one escaped, and in the blink of an eye, a thousand miles had passed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was bleeding profusely. The continuous use of the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps had caused him too much damage. His skin cracked open and blood was flowing out.</p><p>The true Qi in his body was becoming more and more deficient, and he wouldn’t be able to hold on for long.</p><p>Suddenly, there was a wave of moisture in front of them.</p><p>It was a great River, extremely wide, surging on the great Prairie.</p><p>“Big River!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He took another step forward along the river.</p><p>Ten miles away, Lu Ming looked forward.</p><p>The river split up in front, and it did not split into one, but into a fan shape with Five Forks. It split into five branches and flowed towards the entire Prairie, giving birth to the creatures of the Prairie.</p><p>“The heavens are helping me!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. Without thinking, he plunged into the big River.</p><p>The river was extremely deep, more than a hundred meters deep. Lu Ming sank directly to the bottom of the river and swam quickly ahead.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In just four to five breaths, the shadow Wolf Pavilion’s assassin appeared above the river.</p><p>“You want to escape? In your dreams, kill!”</p><p>die! the assassin from the shadow Wolf Pavilion shouted and slashed out with his combat sword. Dense and sharp sword Qi shot toward the river.</p><p>Suddenly, the water in the river churned. One after another, the big fish were killed. Their corpses floated to the surface of the water, and their blood dyed the river red.</p><p>“Die, die!”</p><p>The shadow Wolf Pavilion’s assassins seemed to have gone crazy as they continuously slashed out sword Qi at the river.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The sword Qi continued to shoot out, covering the entire section of the river.</p><p>At the bottom of the river, Lu Ming was swimming like a fish, avoiding the sword aura.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>However, the sword aura was too dense. One of the sword aura pierced through Lu Ming’s shoulder and almost chopped off his arm. Blood was flowing out.</p><p>Lu Ming snorted and continued to move forward.</p><p>There were Five forks in the road ahead. Lu Ming chose one at random and swam down quickly.</p><p>Above them, the assassins from the shadow Wolf Pavilion wreaked havoc in the river as if they had gone mad. However, they still did not see Lu Ming.</p><p>Then, he rushed into the river and started to search.</p><p>After searching everywhere, he could not find Lu Ming. When he reached the fork, his face was completely distorted.</p><p>He did not know which path Lu Ming had taken.</p><p>In addition, it was impossible to chase the enemy according to their aura in the river, as the river would wash away the aura.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>He rushed into the sky, looked around, and roared in anger, ” “Damn it, damn it!”</p><p>Lu Ming followed the river and kept going down. He had no idea how far he had drifted.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that he was getting weaker and weaker. His vision was turning black and his body was in excruciating pain.</p><p>He knew that his previous injuries were too severe, and they were completely acting up now.</p><p>“No, I have to find a place to heal. Otherwise, it’ll be dangerous.”</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming wiped his face and removed his disguise mask, revealing his true appearance.</p><p>As for his body, he had already recovered to his original size due to his injuries.</p><p>After changing into a new set of clothes, Lu Ming continued to drift along the river for a while, in case the shadow Wolf Pavilion’s assassins caught up to him.</p><p>……</p><p>In the evening, a group of people rushed along the main road by the SU River.</p><p>There were more than a dozen people, most of whom were burly middle-aged men. They exuded a heavy aura, and one could tell at a glance that they were martial arts masters.</p><p>Two young men, a man and a woman, were riding in the front.</p><p>The man was handsome, but his long and narrow eyes gave people a gloomy feeling.</p><p>The woman was wearing a long green dress. Her figure was graceful and her curves undulated. She was extremely beautiful.</p><p>However, the woman seemed to have a lot on her mind and frowned.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>stop! suddenly, the woman shouted and pulled the horse under her carriage to a stop.</p><p>The others also stopped.</p><p>“Moying, why did you suddenly stop?”</p><p>The young man frowned and asked.</p><p>“There’s someone in front!”</p><p>Mo Ying said.</p><p>Everyone looked forward and saw a figure crawling out of the SU River.</p><p>After the figure climbed onto the shore, his body staggered as if he would fall down at any moment.</p><p>“The Qi is divided into yin and yang!”</p><p>The figure looked at the crowd and suddenly let out a loud cry. Then, he fell straight down.</p><p>he’s just a dying man. Why do you care so much? let’s hurry back to tiansu city. The young prince came to see you, so we can’t let him wait forever.</p><p>The young man casually glanced at the figure and said indifferently.</p><p>“I want to save him.”</p><p>After mo Ying finished speaking, she jumped off the horse and walked towards the figure.</p><p>“What? You want to save him? You want to save such a piece of trash?”</p><p>The young man shouted.</p><p>But he didn’t see the shock in mo Ying’s eyes.</p><p>“How did he know? Could he really cure me? I’m the only one who knows about this, but this person can see through it with a single glance. I must save him!”</p><p>Mo Ying helped the figure up as she thought about it. She was slightly surprised when she saw the figure.”He’s so young!”</p><p>The person who had climbed out of the river was Lu Ming.</p><p>He had drifted along the river for a while, but his injuries were much more serious than he had imagined.</p><p>His injuries were acting up, and he had no strength left in his body. What was more terrifying was that the true Qi in his body had disappeared completely. He couldn’t even enter the Supreme shrine.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
