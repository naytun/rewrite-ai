BOOM!</p><p>Instantly, all kinds of Shi burst out.</p><p>Wind, fire, metal, wood, mountain, Thunder, water, and so on.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that most of these people had comprehended the force of water.</p><p>It probably had something to do with the environment of the thousand River region.</p><p>He could only move forward by blocking with force.</p><p>Some of the Wu Zongs who had not comprehended force directly knelt down around a thousand meters.</p><p>As for those grandmasters who had comprehended the basics of force, they could walk within 900 meters.</p><p>Those at the early stage of the initial success stage could advance eight hundred meters, and those at the middle stage could advance seven hundred meters.</p><p>Every bit of power he gained was a bit closer to the heavenly gate.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was standing at a distance of about a thousand meters, motionless.</p><p>He stood there and comprehended.</p><p>He felt that the last palm of the ” Three Palms “, the palm of heavenly path, was extremely similar to the aura emitted by the Heaven’s Gate.</p><p>heavenly Dao, heavenly Dao, great Dao of heaven and earth, so that’s how it is!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up when he compared the heavenly path palm with the aura that the Heaven’s Gate was emitting.</p><p>He had finally figured out a little about the heavenly path palm.</p><p>The heavenly path palm was said to be infinitely close to a heaven-grade martial arts technique once cultivated. Its power was incomparably terrifying, but in history, only a few people were able to cultivate it, as it was too difficult.</p><p>Lu Ming had been cultivating for a long time but he still did not have any clues. At this moment, there seemed to be a door that was wide open in front of him.</p><p>this aura, I want to capture this aura and engrave it in my heart. Then, I will reflect it with the heavenly Dao palm. I believe that I will be able to cultivate the heavenly Dao palm very soon!</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing. He focused all his attention on sensing the aura.</p><p>After a while, Lu Ming used his aura to resist and advanced a hundred meters. However, he retreated very quickly.</p><p>The heavenly Dao aura ahead was even more intense, but at the same time, it was even more difficult to capture and memorize something. It was still more suitable to be within a thousand meters.</p><p>While Lu Ming was trying to understand the situation, two figures were moving forward at the fastest speed.</p><p>These were two old men, and they could actually walk within three hundred meters.</p><p>“Shi at the peak of its completion, they are the two monsters of Min River.”</p><p>Someone recognized the two old men and shouted.</p><p>It was obvious that these two old men were very famous.</p><p>Lu Ming took a closer look and realized that the two elders ‘cultivation had already reached the peak of the eighth level martial arts Grandmaster realm.</p><p>it’s best if you can comprehend it within three hundred meters. Moreover, the closer you are to the treasure that will be ejected from the Heaven’s Gate, the higher the chance of obtaining it!</p><p>Some people were extremely envious.</p><p>Everyone tried their best to get closer to the Heaven’s Gate, so that they could gain more.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a figure came from afar and arrived on the mountain in an instant. Then, he continued to rush towards the Heaven’s Gate.</p><p>It was a young man in his twenties.</p><p>A powerful force erupted from his body, and he was extremely fast. Soon, he was within three hundred meters.</p><p>“Who is this person? Shi is actually so powerful?”</p><p>“You don’t even know autumn water?”</p><p>“What? He’s Li qiushui, who’s ranked 78th on the thousand River top 100?”</p><p>Someone was shocked.</p><p>“You two old fogeys, get lost!”</p><p>Once autumn water was within 300 meters, she looked at the min River Monsters coldly.</p><p>The faces of the min River duo darkened, and one of them said,”Li autumn water, what is the meaning of this?”</p><p>“What do you mean? I’m telling you to get lost! I’m the only one left within 300 meters!”</p><p>Li qiushui laughed coldly.</p><p>li autumn water, isn’t your appetite a little too big? I’m afraid you can’t hold it, right? ”</p><p>The min River duo said in a deep voice.</p><p>“Can’t hold on? Just the two of you? You guys are not worthy!”</p><p>Li autumn water was overbearing.</p><p>“Li qiushui, you may be a genius, but we brothers aren’t afraid of you!”</p><p>The min River duo would not give in so easily.</p><p>“If you don’t get lost, then you can only die!”</p><p>Autumn water’s eyes turned cold.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A ray of sword light broke through the air and headed toward the two monsters of Min River.</p><p>“I’m not afraid of you!”</p><p>The two Min River Monsters roared and used all their strength to resist.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>After only five or six moves, the two monsters of Min River trembled violently and retreated. A sword wound had appeared on each of their bodies, and it was so deep that their bones could be seen.</p><p>Sisi Gu</p><p>Everyone gasped in shock.</p><p>The famous Min River Monsters were injured after five or six moves by autumn water.</p><p>Wasn’t autumn water a little too strong?</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed, and there was a hint of solemnity in the depths of his eyes.</p><p>He could clearly see that autumn water’s cultivation was at the peak of the sixth level of the martial ancestor realm. The min river’s twin monsters were two levels higher than him, yet they were injured within five or six moves.</p><p>Autumn water’s ability to fight across two levels was now two levels higher.</p><p>Generally speaking, those peerless geniuses, in the martial arts Grandmaster realm, could fight across two levels, which was almost their limit.</p><p>Geniuses like the scorching sun six heroes and those who were ranked at the bottom of the cloud Emperor ranking could only fight against those who were two levels higher.</p><p>However, the geniuses who were ranked at the bottom of the cloud Emperor board had a much higher cultivation level than the other geniuses.</p><p>As for the top ten geniuses on the cloud Emperor ranking, they were stronger.</p><p>Not only did they have a high cultivation base, but their ability to fight across levels was also stronger.</p><p>For example, LAN Yundao and the others had the ability to fight across two levels, but not three levels. They were in the middle.</p><p>Lu Ming speculated that Jian Fengyun might be able to fight three levels above him.</p><p>Li qiushui, on the other hand, was two to three levels above him. Lu Ming speculated that her combat strength was not weaker than LAN Yundao and the other geniuses who were ranked fifth or sixth on the cloud Emperor ranking.</p><p>But li qiushui was only ranked 78th on the list of the top 100 in the thousand River region.</p><p>The top 100 list of the thousand River waters had the same meaning as the cloud Emperor list. It listed the top 100 geniuses of the thousand River waters.</p><p>He was ranked 78th and yet he was already so powerful. Lu Ming had a deeper understanding of the other regions ‘strength.</p><p>“If you don’t get lost, you’ll die!”</p><p>The autumn water was extremely cold.</p><p>The faces of the min River duo were extremely ugly. In the end, they gritted their teeth and retreated to the 400-meter zone.</p><p>hahaha, li qiushui, eldest young master Li, you are indeed powerful!</p><p>At this moment, a loud laugh was heard, and a red-haired big man quickly ran towards the Heaven’s Gate, his body exuding a powerful aura.</p><p>They only stopped when they were three hundred meters away.</p><p>“It’s the red-haired water demon!</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>Autumn water’s eyes also darkened. She looked at the red-haired water demon and did not say anything.</p><p>The red-haired water demon’s cultivation had already reached the early stage of martial ancestor realm level 9. He wasn’t confident that he could defeat him.</p><p>The red-haired water demon wasn’t afraid of li autumn water either. He stood 300 meters away and looked at the sky Gate with fiery eyes.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s eyes flickered.</p><p>“I’ve succeeded!”</p><p>He had succeeded in inscribing a faint wisp of heavenly Dao aura. As long as he put his mind to it, he would be able to recall the faint heavenly Dao aura.</p><p>Although it was very faint, it should be enough for the cultivation of the heavenly path palm.</p><p>“It’s time to comprehend force!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile and he strode forward.</p><p>Without stopping, eight hundred meters, seven hundred meters, five hundred meters …</p><p>Lu Ming kept walking towards the three hundred-meter zone.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Finally, Lu Ming stepped into the three hundred-meter zone.</p><p>At this moment, everyone’s eyes were focused on Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
