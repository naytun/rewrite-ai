We’ll each take one of them. Whoever can tame them first wins. The loser has to agree to one condition of the winner. Do you dare to bet?”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>As soon as he said that, the people around them looked at the two of them with interest.</p><p>Standing together, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing looked like a golden couple. Moreover, Xie nianqing had been by Lu Ming’s side since the Imperial City. Naturally, others thought that their relationship was not ordinary.</p><p>When Xie nianqing proposed to make a bet with Lu Ming, the others naturally thought that this was a different kind of flirting between the young couple.</p><p>At the side, Mingzhu looked at the beautiful Xie nianqing and sighed in her heart.</p><p>She thought that perhaps only a peerless beauty like Xie nianqing could be worthy of Lu Ming!</p><p>The distance between her and Lu Ming was too great. In the future, they would be further apart.</p><p>After sighing, Mingzhu hid her worries in the bottom of her heart. She revealed a smile on her face and looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Why wouldn’t I?”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Alright, let’s begin!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s expression was sly as he turned into a beam of light and chased after the bloodred scaled Wolf.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and similarly moved, stepping on the air and leaving.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Ming Meng and the rest chased after them on their horses. However, after a while, they could no longer see the two of them.</p><p>“Forget it, we’ll wait for them here!”</p><p>Ming Meng said.</p><p>The others nodded and began to wait.</p><p>The bloodred scaled Wolf ran at a terrifying speed on the grassland. However, with Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s hot pursuit, they caught up in no time.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Xie nianqing’s body moved and pounced on a third grade martial ancestor realm bloodscaled Wolf.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Crimson-scaled Wolf roared and spat out a pillar of fire at Xie nianqing.</p><p>However, with a wave of his hand, Xie nianqing sent out a palm print and the pillar of fire was dispersed. Xie nianqing stepped lightly on the back of the Crimson scaled Wolf.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Crimson-scaled Wolf immediately went berserk. It let out a furious roar and shook its body wildly, trying to throw Xie nianqing off.</p><p>However, Xie nianqing’s true Qi burst forth, forming a terrifying pressure that pressed down on the Crimson scaled Wolf.</p><p>However, the bloodred scaled Wolf howled madly and refused to yield.</p><p>On the other side, Lu Ming was also standing on the back of the Crimson scaled Wolf, channeling his energy to suppress it.</p><p>But at the same time, the bloodred scaled Wolf went berserk and refused to yield.</p><p>In fact, it was not difficult for Lu Ming and Xie nianqing to kill the two Crimson scaled wolves. It was very simple.</p><p>However, what they wanted was not to kill it, but to tame it. In this way, they could not use too much power, or they would kill the Crimson scaled Wolf in an instant.</p><p>He could only use an appropriate amount of strength to suppress the bloodred scaled Wolf and wear down its ferocity. Only then could he slowly tame it.</p><p>This was a process of consumption.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>The two martial Grandmaster 3-dan Scarlet-scaled wolves howled and leaped, trying to shake Lu Ming and Xie nianqing off. However, the two of them stood firmly on the back of the wolves.</p><p>Just like that, the two Crimson scaled wolves abandoned the other Crimson scaled wolves and howled as they headed deeper into the plateau.</p><p>The Crimson scaled Wolf’s speed was too fast. It could easily cross mountains and rivers as if they were flat ground.</p><p>Not long after, they crossed a thousand miles.</p><p>Here, the grassland had disappeared and was replaced by an endless plateau and mountains.</p><p>The two bloodred scaled wolves howled continuously as they leaped through the forest.</p><p>Not long after, they travelled a thousand miles deeper into the plateau.</p><p>OWW! OWW!</p><p>Suddenly, the howls of the wolves resonated with the two bloodscaled wolves.</p><p>Hearing the howls from the wolves around them, the two bloodred scaled wolves seemed to have been injected with chicken blood, and they howled even louder and madly.</p><p>OWW! Awooo!</p><p>In the surroundings, the howls of the wolves became even more concentrated, coming from all directions.</p><p>Then, tall and strong figures appeared from all directions.</p><p>Bloodred scaled wolves. They were all around him.</p><p>The Crimson-scaled wolves glared at Lu Ming and Xie nianqing, their eyes filled with killing intent.</p><p>there are so many bloodred scaled wolves. Could this be a Wolf Den? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>The howls of the wolves could be heard all around. Lu Ming looked around and realized that most of the bloodred scaled wolves were level two demonic beasts, which were equivalent to martial masters.</p><p>Only a small number of them were level three demonic beasts.</p><p>with so many bloodred scaled wolves, how powerful would an Army be if they were to be used as mounts? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart could not help but burn.</p><p>OWW! OWW!</p><p>At this moment, two wolf howls suddenly rang out. These two howls shook the heavens and earth, piercing straight through the clouds.</p><p>After these two howls, the other bloodscaled wolves in the surroundings all fell silent.</p><p>Within a radius of several dozen li, the other demonic beasts didn’t even dare to breathe. It was extremely quiet.</p><p>That was-</p><p>In the next moment, Lu Ming saw two bloodred scaled wolves walking out from the highest mountain.</p><p>The two Crimson-scaled wolves were extremely burly and three meters tall. They were covered in fiery-red scales that looked like they were made of fire Jade. They were crystal clear and seemed to have flames jumping out of them.</p><p>An extremely powerful aura burst out from the two Crimson scaled wolves.</p><p>a peak sixth grade fourth level demonic beast is equivalent to a peak sixth grade martial Grandmaster!</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze suddenly flickered.</p><p>Wuwuwu …</p><p>At this moment, the other bloodred scaled wolves whimpered and prostrated as if they were welcoming the arrival of their King.</p><p>are these two bloodscale wolves the king of the pack? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat as he thought of this possibility.</p><p>Looking at the situation, it shouldn’t be wrong.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>The two Crimson-scaled wolves appeared and howled in anger. They leaped into the air and pounced at Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing did not dare to be careless. They used their full strength and met the attack.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>With two loud bangs, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were both sent flying.</p><p>what a powerful force. Although this Wolf King is a peak Class 6 fourth level demonic beast, its combat strength is not something an ordinary Class 6 fourth level demonic beast can compare to. It’s at least at Class 7 fourth level.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>The two bloodscaled Wolf Kings howled in anger and pounced at Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>The two of them began to fight.</p><p>However, as soon as they started fighting, Xie nianqing was at a disadvantage.</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly better but he was also at a disadvantage.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current combat strength, he would have no problem fighting against an average sixth-grade martial arts Grandmaster. He could even kill them. However, against a seventh-grade martial arts Grandmaster, the difference was too great. He was no match for them.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>After a few consecutive exchanges, Lu Ming’s muscles trembled and he retreated continuously. He was at a disadvantage.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>On the other side, Xie nianqing was sent flying. He landed beside Lu Ming, blood flowing from the corner of his mouth.</p><p>However, she did not say a word and did not escape. It was as if she would not leave as long as Lu Ming did not leave. She was very stubborn.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The two Crimson Wolf Kings howled as they surrounded Lu Ming and Xie nianqing. Their murderous intent was like a tidal wave.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
