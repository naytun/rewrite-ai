Now that there was the freakish Lu Ming, he did not dare to continue fighting. He turned and ran.</p><p>“You want to leave? How can it be that easy?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and gave chase. At the same time, the Golden-eyed blood zombie followed suit.</p><p>The white-haired old man was shocked, and his figure soared up into the sky.</p><p>There were six figures there, both men and women. Each of them exuded a terrifying aura. All six of them were in the 7th level of the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>Among them, there were three from the Dark Moon Empire and three from the blazing sun Empire. The six of them were in a chaotic battle, and it was extremely intense.</p><p>As soon as they saw the white-haired old man rushing over, the three people of the Dark Moon Empire were shocked. One of them asked,”Old Lin, why did you come back?”</p><p>this time, the information was wrong. A few extremely powerful characters appeared. I’m not their match. Let’s retreat quickly? ”</p><p>The white-haired old man called out.</p><p>“Retreat? We’re on the verge of victory, and we’re retreating now? You’re crazy.”</p><p>A burly man roared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming and the Golden-eyed blood corpse had already rushed over. The white-haired elder was so frightened that he fled in a hurry.</p><p>“He’s just a little brat, what’s there to be afraid of? I’ll kill him!”</p><p>The burly man shouted coldly. His opponent, who had been knocked back with one move, wielded a huge saber and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>As the saber radiance slashed down, the space shook violently.</p><p>“You can’t!”</p><p>The white-haired old man cried out in alarm.</p><p>But it was too late.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood corpse roared and charged forward. It waved its claws and blood-red light appeared, clashing with the blade light.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming thrust his spear forward. The Spear’s gleam, which contained the power of wind and Fire, instantly pierced through the saber’s gleam and went straight for the burly man.</p><p>The burly man’s eyes widened and he looked extremely frightened.</p><p>“Ah, retreat! Retreat! Retreat!”</p><p>The burly man roared. He used all of his true Qi and physical strength in an attempt to Dodge the spear.</p><p>However, he was still a step too late. He managed to avoid being hit in his vital parts, but the spear radiance still pierced his shoulder. The burly man’s shoulder instantly exploded, and one of his arms was missing.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The burly man screamed and coughed up blood. He had been severely injured. He tried to run away with his remaining genuine Qi.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. The long spear trembled and the Spear’s radiance lashed out horizontally, hitting the burly man’s body. The burly man let out a terrified cry and his body exploded in the air.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Lu Ming rushed over and devoured the blood essence.</p><p>“Retreat, quickly retreat!”</p><p>The white-haired old man was scared out of his wits. The burly man, who was not weaker than him, was killed by Lu Ming and the Golden-eyed blood corpse in one move. He was so scared that his whole body trembled. He screamed and ran even faster.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The other two Dark Moon Empire’s 7th level martial ancestor realm experts also turned pale with fright as they frantically fled.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the three of them disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Lu Ming did not pursue him. The reason why he was able to kill the burly man so easily was not because his combat strength was much stronger than his opponent. The main reason was that his opponent was too careless. That was why he was killed by Lu Ming and the Golden-eyed blood corpse.</p><p>If they were to fight head-on, Lu Ming might not be able to defeat the other party.</p><p>“Young master, how may I address you?”</p><p>At this moment, the three seventh level martial grandmasters from the blazing sun Empire flew over and cupped their fists in greeting. At the same time, they carefully sized up Lu Ming and were shocked when they discovered his age.</p><p>“This one is Tian Yun!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>From their attire, he could tell with a single glance that one of the three was an expert from the mystical sword sect, while the other two were experts from the ghostmoon saber sect.</p><p>“You’re tianyun?”</p><p>The mystical sword sect’s expert, a tall and thin man in his fifties, exclaimed.</p><p>The two powerhouses from the ghost moon saber sect also looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>Tianyun’s name had already spread throughout the entire blazing sun Empire. As long as one was a martial artist, everyone would know him.</p><p>But today, they realized that tianyun was even more powerful and stunning than the legends had described.</p><p>“Three seniors, it’s more important for us to deal with the enemy first!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Not bad! Let’s go, let’s kill those bastards from the Dark Moon Empire!”</p><p>The tall and thin man from the mystical sword sect roared.</p><p>The four of them then rushed toward the battlefield where the other martial grandmasters were fighting.</p><p>The Dark Moon Empire’s martial Grandmaster powerhouses had obviously received the news and fled in panic.</p><p>After leaving a few people alive, they all escaped.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The other martial Grandmaster powerhouses charged towards the battlefield on the ground.</p><p>“Young master!”</p><p>Qiu Yue appeared beside Lu Ming and whispered softly. Her brows were filled with joy.</p><p>“Qiuyue, let’s go. Let’s kill the enemies together. We’ll catch up after the battle.”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>Qiu Yue nodded obediently and followed Lu Ming to the battlefield below.</p><p>There was no longer any suspense in the battlefield below. When Lu Ming left earlier, the 20000-strong Bloodmoon demonic Tiger Army of the Dark Moon Empire had already been defeated. The situation was hopeless.</p><p>After that, the northern Battlefront Army fought back and attacked the blood red scaled Wolf cavalry from both sides. The yinyue Army was completely defeated.</p><p>When Lu Ming returned, he saw Xie nianqing leading the blood-red Army at the forefront. They were pursuing the defeated Army of the Dark Moon.</p><p>Along the way, corpses were strewn everywhere.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming landed on the bloodscaled Wolf King, and Qiu Yue followed suit, sitting slightly in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>The bloodred scaled Wolf had a huge body that was more than six meters long. It was still very spacious when the two of them sat on it.</p><p>At the side, Xie nianqing noticed that Lu Ming had returned. At the same time, he saw Qiu Yue sitting in front of Lu Ming. His face darkened instantly, and a cold glint flashed across his eyes.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>The Dark Moon Empire’s soldiers let out terrified howls and ran for their lives. However, no matter how fast they were, they were not as fast as the Crimson scaled Wolf. One by one, they were killed, and the smell of blood filled the air.</p><p>“Yi!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming noticed that the Golden-eyed blood corpse next to him was gathering a thick blood-red light.</p><p>The blood Qi in the world continued to gather towards the Golden-eyed blood corpse, and the blood light on the body of the Golden-eyed blood corpse became thicker and thicker.</p><p>“That’s right, blood zombies like to devour blood to increase their strength. The battlefield is heaven for blood zombies.”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself and was secretly happy.</p><p>He was naturally happy that the Golden-eyed blood corpse’s strength had increased.</p><p>The massacre continued, and it took an hour for everything to calm down.</p><p>In this battle, the Dark Moon Empire suffered a crushing defeat, leaving tens of thousands of corpses.</p><p>All of this was because of the arrival of the blood red Cavalry led by Lu Ming. The power of the blood red Cavalry had begun to show.</p><p>Thump thump …</p><p>A troop of military horses galloped over and stopped a hundred meters in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>It was the northern Army.</p><p>“That’s general tianyun!”</p><p>A dark-skinned man in his forties called out.</p><p>“That’s right, I am Tian Yun.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“I’m Huang Chenlong, the Deputy general of the northern Battlefront Army. Nice to meet you, general tianyun!”</p><p>The dark-skinned man cupped his fists and said.</p><p>“So it’s general Huang. General Huang, come over for a chat.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Huang Chenlong nodded and brought a group of people to meet up with Lu Ming. Lu Ming also asked Huang Chenlong about this matter. How was the northern Battlefront Army?</p><p>“The great general was assassinated.”</p><p>Huang Chenlong sighed and began to talk.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
