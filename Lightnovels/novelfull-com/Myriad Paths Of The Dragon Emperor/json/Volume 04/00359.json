It was for Xie nianqing.</p><p>It seemed that the news of Xie nianqing’s defeat of LAN Yunfei yesterday had already spread to the higher-ups of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. That was why they had sent an invitation letter.</p><p>With Xie nianqing’s combat strength, he was fully qualified to receive an invitation.</p><p>The next two days were peaceful and no one disturbed Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, it was time for the Ditian Divine Guard’s preliminary round.</p><p>The Ditian Divine Guard preliminaries were to select a group of elites from the geniuses who had received invitations from the 36 countries of Emperor Yun. Only this group of people would be qualified to participate in the final selection of the Ditian divine guards.</p><p>The gathering place for the preliminaries was in front of the Emperor heaven divine Palace’s residence in the cloud desolate imperial capital.</p><p>Early in the morning, Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, Feng Wuji, and Ling Yanchi headed to the assembly point.</p><p>The Emperor heaven divine Palace’s residence in the cloud desolate Empire’s imperial capital was extremely Grand and majestic. It was even more majestic than the cloud desolate Imperial Palace.</p><p>In front of the mansion, there was a wide square.</p><p>When Lu Ming and the rest arrived, the square was already surrounded by people.</p><p>Most of them were people who came to watch the show.</p><p>However, there were not many people in the square.</p><p>This was because there were people from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace guarding the square. Only the geniuses participating in the preliminaries could step on it. If anyone else were to step in rashly and was discovered, they would be killed without mercy.</p><p>No one dared to take the risk.</p><p>When the four of them arrived, they walked directly to the square.</p><p>“Guys, look, there’s a genius from the preliminaries here.”</p><p>“Two of them look so young. Which Empire are they from?”</p><p>“I don’t know him, he’s a complete stranger!”</p><p>I know. I saw them a few days ago. The youngest man and woman are the two who defeated yang Liuji and LAN Yunfei three days ago. They are the geniuses from the burning sun Empire.</p><p>The surrounding crowd was discussing when someone suddenly shouted.</p><p>“What? It’s them, just like the rumors, they’re really that young. I thought the rumors were exaggerated.”</p><p>I can’t believe that the blazing sun Empire has produced such a genius.</p><p>In the past few days, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s names had spread throughout the cloud wilderness imperial capital.</p><p>Many people were very curious and they looked at Lu Ming and the other three.</p><p>The four of them had also seen big scenes before, so their expressions didn’t change. They walked to the square and stood at the side.</p><p>“It seems that we came too early.”</p><p>Feng Wuji chuckled.</p><p>“It’s a good opportunity for me to meet the other geniuses!”</p><p>Ling Yanchi’s eyes were filled with excitement.</p><p>Time slowly passed, and more and more people came.</p><p>Without a doubt, they were all young people, all under the age of 30. Most of them were in their twenties, and there were very few under the age of 20.</p><p>look, that’s Liu Xiaofeng, who is ranked 35th on the cloud Emperor ranking list!</p><p>Suddenly, someone pointed at a yellow-robed young man and shouted.</p><p>also, that’s Wang Kai, who is ranked 26th on the cloud Emperor board!</p><p>Oh my God, that’s Su Yingying, who is ranked 13th on the cloud Emperor board. I’ve long heard that Su Yingying is a devastatingly beautiful woman. Now that I’ve seen her today, I see that she is indeed worthy of her reputation.</p><p>With the arrival of the geniuses on the cloud Emperor ranking list, the audience was excited.</p><p>The 36 countries of Emperor Yun were vast, but there were only 36 people on the Emperor Yun list.</p><p>Usually, the geniuses on the cloud Emperor ranking were scattered all over the place. It was hard to see them at all. But now, they had seen so many people at once, and everyone was excited.</p><p>Even Feng Wuji and Ling Yanchi’s eyes lit up as they started to size up the geniuses on the cloud Emperor board.</p><p>Soon, no less than 300 people had gathered in the square, and the number was still increasing.</p><p>This made Lu Ming sigh with emotion.</p><p>Only geniuses on the same level as the six heroes of the scorching sun could receive an invitation. However, hundreds of such geniuses had arrived.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly felt a murderous intent enveloping him. He could not help but turn around to look. The corners of his mouth curled into a faint smile.</p><p>So it was the six extremes of yang.</p><p>After not seeing him for a few days, yang Liuji’s injuries had almost recovered. He was looking at Lu Ming with a cold gaze.</p><p>Beside yang Liuji was a tall young man. He was wearing the same clothes as yang Liuji and was obviously from the blood Zhao’s great sun House. He was also staring at Lu Ming with an unfriendly look.</p><p>yang Liuji is here. The one beside him, is he the number one expert among the younger generation of the great sun House, Yan feixun? ”</p><p>it’s definitely him. Yan feixun, ranked ninth on the cloud Emperor ranking list!</p><p>Exclamations of shock came from the surroundings.</p><p>The top ten geniuses on the cloud Emperor ranking list had finally appeared.</p><p>It was as if Yan feixun’s arrival was the start of the event that had happened ten days ago.</p><p>In the air, a blue light flashed and two figures appeared in the square.</p><p>One of the two blue-robed young men was LAN Yunfei.</p><p>The other man was tall and had a saber on his back. He had a wild aura.</p><p>“LAN Yunfei and LAN Yundao!”</p><p>“The fifth-ranked LAN Yundao has arrived.”</p><p>There was another round of exclamations in the surroundings.</p><p>As soon as LAN Yunfei and LAN Yundao arrived, they swept their gazes across the surroundings. In the next moment, they discovered Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>The two of them strode toward Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“There’s a good show to watch!”</p><p>The crowd’s gaze was fixed on LAN Yundao and Lu Ming.</p><p>The geniuses on the square were also watching with interest.</p><p>Very soon, LAN Yunfei and LAN Yundao were not far from Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“You two are Lu Ming and Xie nianqing?”</p><p>LAN Yundao’s gaze fell on Lu Ming and Xie nianqing. He did not hide the murderous intent in his eyes.</p><p>“That’s right. I didn’t expect to be so famous now!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and did not care.</p><p>Xie nianqing pouted and didn’t even bother to reply.</p><p>Seeing this, LAN Yundao’s face darkened and he said coldly, ” “You dare to beat up my blue blade family’s people, you’re really bold. However, those who dared to beat up my blue blade family’s people are no longer in this world.”</p><p>“Oh, really? Aren’t you afraid of biting your tongue when you talk big? the world is so big, and there are so many experts. There are also many people who can destroy your family with a flick of their hands. You even said that the people who dared to attack your blue blade family are no longer in this world. You really have no shame in talking big!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently, his voice full of ridicule.</p><p>“What did you just say?”</p><p>LAN Yundao was furious.</p><p>“Brother LAN, there’s no need to waste words with them. Just attack and kill them!”</p><p>At this moment, Yan feixun walked over and said with a murderous look.</p><p>“You want to kill me? why don’t you try?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with killing intent and a powerful aura rose from his body.</p><p>Xie nianqing, Feng Wuji, and Ling Yanchi walked to Lu Ming’s side and glared at Yan feixun, LAN Yundao, and the rest.</p><p>The battle was about to begin.</p><p>this place doesn’t allow a great battle. Anyone who violates this rule will be killed!</p><p>Suddenly, a middle-aged man shouted loudly, and a mountain-like pressure rose from his body.</p><p>This burly man was a guard of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace.</p><p>LAN Yundao and Yan feixun’s expressions changed and they withdrew their Qi.</p><p>Lu Ming and the group also retracted their aura.</p><p>Hmph, I’ll let you off today. Lu Ming, I hope you can pass the preliminaries smoothly. At that time, I’ll let you know the consequences of offending the blue blade family in the Ditian Divine Guard selection!</p><p>LAN Yundao said coldly before he turned around and left with LAN Yunfei.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
