Whoosh!</p><p>...</p><p>The long spear stabbed out continuously, and the golems exploded one after another.</p><p>Not long after, the twenty golems were all defeated by Lu Ming.</p><p>Next, the seventh level martial arts Grandmaster mid-level stone golems could not stop Lu Ming either.</p><p>He swept through everything.</p><p>When the twenty stone golems in the later stage of the seventh realm martial arts Grandmaster realm were defeated, Lu Ming’s points had already surpassed yang Liuji’s.</p><p>Outside the formation, yang Liuji’s eyes were fixed on the stele, his teeth clenched.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Yang Liuji growled.</p><p>Although he was mentally prepared, he still felt extremely unhappy that Lu Ming had surpassed him.</p><p>However, the others did not pay much attention to Lu Ming. The top ten on the cloud Emperor board were no slower than Lu Ming in terms of points.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In the ten thousand illusionary killing array, Lu Ming shot a few times in succession and defeated the last two seventh peak martial ancestor realm golems. At this point, Lu Ming’s points had reached 1560 points.</p><p>At this time, the surrounding scene changed again.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that he had appeared in a huge Canyon. In the canyon, the wind whistled and tore the sky apart.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>A series of air-piercing sounds suddenly rang out in the midst of the violent wind.</p><p>The next moment, streaks of saber radiance slashed at Lu Ming. They were so fast that they were in front of Lu Ming in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed and his body trembled slightly. His body was like a flickering light and a fleeting shadow as he drifted back dozens of meters.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The long spear shook and swept out horizontally, sending a figure flying.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming saw that it was a figure completely wrapped in a black robe.</p><p>The ten thousand illusionary killing array would not only form demonic beasts, but also Warriors.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Behind Lu Ming, there were also rays of Saber Light slashing at him.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his long spear and blocked a few attacks.</p><p>These black-robed men were all in the early stage of the eighth level of the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>“Wind force!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast the force of the wind and began to sense the tracks of the black-robed person.</p><p>Although the black-robed man was fast, he could not hide from Lu Ming’s wind force.</p><p>“I’ve found you!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly flashed and he stabbed more than ten times with his long spear.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming pierced through five to six black-robed men in a row, turning them into energy and dissipating.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current combat strength, the early eighth level martial arts Grandmaster realm martial artists were no match for him. After he found their tracks, they were killed by Lu Ming one after another.</p><p>Very quickly, the 20 Black-robed men in the early stage of the eighth martial ancestor realm were all killed.</p><p>In the next moment, 20 Black-robed men in the middle of the eighth level martial Grandmaster realm appeared.</p><p>The 20 Black-robed men were even faster. In the midst of the strong wind, they were as fast as lightning.</p><p>Even when Lu Ming cast wind force, it was difficult to capture the trajectory.</p><p>force, these black-robed people actually also grasped wind force!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>amazing, truly amazing. This is only a Grand formation, but the martial artist condensed inside actually also grasps the force of the wind.</p><p>Lu Ming was amazed.</p><p>“This wind force is different from the one I comprehended. That’s right, so wind force can also be like this. Why didn’t I think of it before?”</p><p>For a moment, Lu Ming was not in a hurry to kill these black-robed men. Instead, he blocked them and sensed the momentum of the wind at the same time.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current cultivation, if he used all his strength and executed the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps, he would definitely be able to cross four small realms and fight with a martial arts Grandmaster at the peak of the eighth level. He might even win.</p><p>It was not impossible for him to break through this stage with his full strength.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was no longer in a hurry.</p><p>Outside the ten thousand illusionary killing array, everyone was staring at the stone tablet.</p><p>In the beginning, Lu Ming did not attract much attention. However, when he passed the seventh level martial arts Grandmaster stage and accumulated 1560 points, he attracted a lot of attention.</p><p>This was a threshold. Those who could cross this threshold, even in the cloud Emperor ranking, were top geniuses and could definitely be ranked in the top twenty.</p><p>Lu Ming is actually so strong. He has accumulated one thousand five hundred and sixty points. He’s going to face a martial arts Grandmaster eighth realm early phase next.</p><p>“I wonder how far Lu Ming can go?”</p><p>Many people were discussing.</p><p>When yang Liuji heard this, he couldn’t help but grit his teeth.</p><p>“I didn’t expect Lu Ming to be so powerful!”</p><p>Yan feixun muttered.</p><p>“You have some ability, but you still have to die!”</p><p>LAN Yundao snorted.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Lu Ming, I didn’t expect your strength to have reached this level. It looks like I’ll have to find an opportunity to kill you during the Ditian Divine Guard selection this time!”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang’s eyes glowed with a cold light.</p><p>But not long after, their expressions changed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s points continued to rise at a very fast speed, no slower than Shangguan Yanchen and the other geniuses in the top ten of the cloud Emperor ranking.</p><p>it’s still increasing. Lu Ming’s points are still increasing. He’s too strong. Could it be that Lu Ming can charge into the top ten? ”</p><p>I really didn’t expect Lu Ming’s combat strength to be so terrifying. He probably didn’t use much of his strength when he defeated yang Liuji, right? ”</p><p>Oh my God, look, Xie nianqing’s points aren’t bad either. They’re all from the blazing sun Empire.</p><p>including Qiu changkong, the small blazing sun Empire has three such terrifying geniuses. Unbelievable!</p><p>Exclamations could be heard from the surroundings.</p><p>Very quickly, Lu Ming’s points shot up to one thousand eight hundred and twenty. This meant that Lu Ming had already killed twenty martial arts Grandmaster eighth realm martial artists.</p><p>next, Lu Ming will be facing twenty martial arts Grandmaster eighth realm intermediate stage martial artists. As long as he can pass this stage, there’s a high chance that he’ll make it into the top ten. If he can pass the next stage, he’ll be able to surpass Qiu changkong and enter the top ten.</p><p>“I’m looking forward to it!”</p><p>“Eh? No, have you noticed that Lu Ming’s points have stopped moving?”</p><p>“Yes, could it be that he has reached his limit?”</p><p>that’s most likely the case. I think he’s already at the end of his rope and should be doing his best to resist. That’s why his points have stopped moving.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Qiu changkong, Yan feixun, and the others also heaved a long sigh.</p><p>Qiu changkong, in particular, was nervous when he saw Lu Ming’s points increase rapidly. He was afraid that Lu Ming would surpass him.</p><p>Given his pride, he would definitely find it hard to accept that Lu Ming had surpassed him.</p><p>Fortunately, Lu Ming’s points suddenly stopped.</p><p>“Hehe, Lu Ming, is this your limit? What a disappointment.”</p><p>Qiu changkong murmured, a smile on his face.</p><p>At the same time, LAN Yundao and the others were also sneering.</p><p>Lu Ming was just that. He did not pose a threat to them.</p><p>look, Xie nianqing’s points are slowing down too.</p><p>not bad. It seems like Xie nianqing’s combat power is slightly higher than Lu Ming’s, but he’s not as strong as the top ten geniuses on the cloud Emperor ranking.</p><p>Some people were discussing with each other, expressing their own opinions.</p><p>That was because the top ten geniuses on the cloud Emperor board were still increasing their points.</p><p>Not long after, three of the top ten geniuses on the cloud Emperor board had surpassed Qiu changkong and pushed him down to the ninth place.</p><p>Yan feixun, on the other hand, fell to the tenth place.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Yan feixun gritted his teeth. He was originally ranked ninth, but this time, he was ranked tenth. Not only did he not improve, but he also dropped one rank, which made him depressed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
