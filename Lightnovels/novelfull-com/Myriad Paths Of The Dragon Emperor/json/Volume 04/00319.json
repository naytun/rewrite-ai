They were even more golden now, as if two pieces of gold had been embedded in them.</p><p>Most of the green hair on his skin had faded away, making his skin look blood red and crystal clear. He looked like he was made of fiery red Steel, full of strength.</p><p>In particular, the aura of the Golden-eyed blood corpse was more than five to six times stronger than before.</p><p>“How could he be so much stronger? This aura isn’t just at the 8th level of the martial ancestor realm. Could it be that the Golden-eyed blood corpse has already reached the 9th level?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind whirred and his eyes were filled with surprise.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood corpse growled and came to Lu Ming’s side.</p><p>“Let’s go back to Moonview city!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Then, together with the Golden-eyed blood corpse, they soared into the sky and flew towards Moonview city.</p><p>However, he had not even flown ten miles when he suddenly felt a chill down his spine.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, the Golden-eyed blood corpse let out a deafening roar and charged toward Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>Chi Chi!</p><p>Above Lu Ming’s head, a dark cloud suddenly split open. Two pale-white sword gleams, faster than lightning, were slashing down on Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood corpse collided with the two blade lights and its body fell to the ground like a cannonball.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At the same time as the two blade gleams were released, a jet-black sword gleam pierced through the void behind Lu Ming and stabbed him.</p><p>This sword was fast, accurate, vicious, and terrifyingly powerful.</p><p>ninth level martial ancestor realm! Three ninth level martial ancestor realm assassins! Block them!</p><p>Lu Ming bellowed in rage. Six ancient shields condensed behind him and stacked on top of each other.</p><p>But-</p><p>Chi Chi Chi</p><p>The six ancient shields were penetrated almost instantly.</p><p>However, this also bought Lu Ming some time. His second blood Meridian burst out instantly. He waved his left palm and a huge beast claw struck out mightily.</p><p>At the same time, he held the demon subduing spear in his right hand and stabbed out. On the spear, there was a strong power of wind and Fire.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The huge beast claw was the first to be destroyed by the sword radiance. Then, the demon subduing Spear’s tip and the sword radiance clashed.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>A terrifying fluctuation spread out. Lu Ming grunted and his body flew backward rapidly. He flew for a few thousand meters before he stopped in the air and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, three figures flashed and appeared in the sky.</p><p>Two of them were middle-aged men, wearing blood-red robes. One of them had a full moon embroidered on it, while the other had a chipped moon.</p><p>They each held a scimitar in their hands.</p><p>The two of them were behind Lu Ming, blocking his way of retreat.</p><p>The third person was wrapped in a black robe, and his appearance could not be seen. He held a thin and black long sword.</p><p>He was in front of Lu Ming. The three of them had vaguely sealed off Lu Ming’s path of retreat.</p><p>“This tianyun is truly hard to deal with. Even after all this, I still wasn’t able to kill him.”</p><p>Said the middle-aged man with the full moon. His voice was cold and hoarse, and it was extremely unpleasant to hear.</p><p>“That’s a golden-eyed blood corpse. It’s so powerful. It seems to have reached the early stage of martial ancestor 9-dan. It’s not weaker than the three of us.” Jiang Chen said.</p><p>The middle-aged man with the chipped moon said.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood corpse roared and rushed out from the ground, blocking Lu Ming.</p><p>On the claws of the Golden-eyed blood corpse, there were two deep wounds caused by the blade light.</p><p>Lu Ming wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth. His gaze fell on the thin black long sword of the person in front of him. His eyes flashed as he said,”You’re from the shadow Wolf Pavilion, right?”</p><p>He had seen the sword more than once.</p><p>hehe, you’re going to die today anyway, so there’s no harm in telling you. You’re right, I’m the number one assassin of the shadow Wolf Pavilion. It’s your honor to have me fight.</p><p>The black-robed man sneered.</p><p>the shadow Wolf Pavilion is actually working with the yinyue Empire. It seems like the omnidirectional sword sect is planning a grand scheme.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered.</p><p>“Hehe, you know quite a lot.”</p><p>The shadow Wolf Pavilion’s assassin sneered.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming shouted and dashed to the left.</p><p>What a joke. The three assassins in the early stage of martial ancestor realm level 9 were too strong. They were not something he could fight against. If he stayed, he would only die.</p><p>Only by rushing out would they have a chance of survival.</p><p>“You want to leave? How was that possible? Die!”</p><p>The three assassins roared and made their final moves.</p><p>Two saber-lights and one sword-light pierced through the void and slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Fast, it was too fast. It was behind Lu Ming in an instant.</p><p>A 9th level martial arts Grandmaster assassin was simply too powerful.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood corpse roared and charged forward without fear of death.</p><p>However, it was only one person after all. It was no match for them at all and was once again sent flying by two saber lights.</p><p>If it wasn’t for its steel-like body, it would’ve already been hacked into pieces.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>On the other side, Lu Ming used all his strength and exchanged a blow with the shadow Wolf Pavilion’s assassin.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming was sent flying even further away. He coughed up a large amount of blood. One of his arms was covered in sword marks and he felt as if his body was about to split apart.</p><p>This move caused him to be even more injured.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>kill! the shadow Wolf Pavilion’s assassin shouted coldly. His killing intent burst forth as he continued to charge at Lu Ming.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood corpse charged out from underground.</p><p>“Leave this beast to the two of us. You’re in charge of killing tianyun.”</p><p>The yuan and que duo shouted coldly and charged towards the Golden-eyed blood zombie.</p><p>“Don’t worry, tianyun will die!”</p><p>The shadow Wolf Pavilion’s Assassin’s voice was extremely cold. The sword light became even sharper, and it cut through the sky. A sword mark that was several miles long suddenly appeared in the sky, as if it was going to cut the sky apart.</p><p>“Nine Dragons trampling the heavens!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming erupted with all his strength. His essential Qi surged, he looked up to the sky and let out a long roar, then suddenly took a step forward.</p><p>A strange wave was emitted from Lu Ming’s body. Then, a terrifying force burst out from under Lu Ming’s feet.</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar suddenly rang out. It was as if a Supreme true dragon was stepping in the void, crushing everything.</p><p>After a month of hard work, he had finally completed the first step of the nine Dragons heaven treading steps.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This step collided with the shadow Wolf Pavilion Assassin’s sword light.</p><p>There was an earth-shattering boom and Lu Ming’s body was sent flying far away.</p><p>However, the shadow Wolf Pavilion’s assassin was also struck by this attack, and his body came to a halt.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>The assassin from the shadow Wolf Pavilion shouted hysterically. He could not believe it.</p><p>He could clearly see that tianyun was only at the peak of the third level of the martial ancestor realm, while he was at the early stage of the ninth level.</p><p>The difference was about six levels.</p><p>It could be said that the gap between them was 108000 miles. With such a huge gap, it was already a great miracle that she could block two of his sword strikes and not die.</p><p>But now, he had actually blocked his attack. This was simply a fantasy. The shadow Wolf Pavilion’s assassins had lived for so many years, but they had never heard of such a thing.</p><p>His self-confidence had taken a heavy blow.</p><p>“Die! Die! Die!”</p><p>The shadow Wolf Pavilion’s assassins howled and charged at Lu Ming in a frenzy.</p><p>Lu Ming’s talent made him feel afraid.</p><p>“Nine Dragons trampling the heavens!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared. This time, he did not step toward the shadow Wolf Pavilion’s assassin. Instead, he stepped into the void behind him.</p><p>The nine Dragons heaven stomping steps, as a divine level martial technique, was not only used for attack.</p><p>It was also a movement technique, and the principle was the same. As long as the operation method was slightly changed, it would be a Supreme movement technique.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
