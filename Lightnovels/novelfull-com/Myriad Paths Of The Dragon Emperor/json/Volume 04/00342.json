Aren’t you afraid that the ten direction sword sect will unify the blazing sun Empire and become stronger, and then target the yin moon Empire?”</p><p>...</p><p>Lin Xueyi looked at Yin tianjue and asked.</p><p>“Haha, there’s no harm in telling you. It turns out that the territory of the ghost moon saber sect belongs to my Yin moon Empire!”</p><p>Yin tianjue laughed.</p><p>“What? The ten direction sword sect is betraying our country!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi roared.</p><p>The ten direction sword sect had actually given the ghost moon saber sect’s territory to the yin moon Empire, which was equivalent to one-fifth of the blazing sun Empire’s territory.</p><p>The ten directions sword sect was using all their means.</p><p>Lin Xueyi, this is a win-win situation. Alright, your mystical sword sect is destined to be destroyed. Kill!</p><p>Yin tianjue ordered.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Dozens of figures flew out from the back of the giant centipede and charged toward the mystical sword sect.</p><p>Instantly, dozens of mystical sword sect disciples were killed.</p><p>These people were all top-notch experts. The weakest of them was at the sixth level of the martial arts Grandmaster realm, and three of them were at the ninth level.</p><p>As soon as he made his move, the situation changed drastically, and the mystical sword sect was at a disadvantage.</p><p>Yin tianjue didn’t make a move, his target was Lin Xueyi.</p><p>“Duanmu canghai, why don’t we join forces and kill Lin Xueyi?”</p><p>Yin tianjue sneered.</p><p>“Just what I wanted!”</p><p>Duanmu canghai’s murky eyes revealed a cold glint.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Their auras exploded and swept across the world. The clouds in the sky were turned into dust by their auras.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lin Xueyi’s upper Lv 4 combat sword let out a soft cry, and a beam of sword Qi shot up into the sky.</p><p>He looked at Duanmu canghai and Yin tianjue with a serious expression.</p><p>Facing two half step King Warriors, he had no confidence at all. He knew that he had to go all out today, or else the mystical sword sect would be in danger.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Duanmu canghai and Yin tianjue shouted in unison, each of them launching a move.</p><p>Duanmu canghai used a sword while Yin tianjue used a battle spear. The two attacks advanced side by side and headed towards Lin Xueyi.</p><p>“Profound Heavenly Sword technique!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi let out a long cry, and her entire body seemed to have transformed into a divine sword. Sword intent filled the air, and a brilliant sword light seemed to have come from beyond the heavens as it violently slashed out.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Two earth-shaking rumbles spread out for hundreds of miles.</p><p>If one looked up from below, one could see that the entire sky was covered in sword Qi and spear light. The space trembled, and it was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The next moment, a figure retreated frantically. Due to its speed, it created an air wave that was thousands of meters long.</p><p>It was Lin Xueyi. She retreated a few thousand meters, groaned, and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Lin Xueyi, you are no match for the two of us. Today, you are dead!</p><p>Yin tianjue sneered.</p><p>“Even if I die, I’ll drag you down with me!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi’s eyes flashed with madness.</p><p>“Drag us down with you? Haha, Lin Xueyi, you think too highly of yourself. Die!”</p><p>Yin Tian Jue laughed loudly, his aura like a mountain as he charged towards Lin Xueyi.</p><p>At the same time, Duanmu canghai also attacked Lin Xueyi.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Another two earth-shaking rumbles sounded, and Lin Xueyi was forced back again. She coughed out blood, and her face was pale.</p><p>He was completely outmatched by two experts of the same realm. He was completely suppressed.</p><p>They were both half-Kings, and they had both cultivated their controlling force to the extreme. They were both at the peak of the blazing sun Empire and the yinyue Empire. Who could be worse than the other?</p><p>It was impossible for Xue Lin to be a match for the two.</p><p>“Haha, Lin Xueyi, die!”</p><p>Yin tianjue howled as his battle spear pierced through the air, turning into a huge spear that was a few hundred meters long as it flew towards Lin Xueyi.</p><p>“Lin Xueyi, let this old man send you off!”</p><p>Duanmu canghai laughed coldly as his sword light shook the sky. Boundless energy burst forth from his aged body.</p><p>A sword light slashed towards Lin Xueyi.</p><p>At this moment-</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Heaven and earth shook violently as a saber flare slashed over from the void in the distance.</p><p>The blade light was hundreds of meters long and black in color. The most shocking thing was that when the blade light cut through the void, a series of shrill screams rang out, as if countless evil ghosts were screaming.</p><p>The target of this blade light was Yin tianjue.</p><p>“Ghost king purgatory slash!”</p><p>Yin tianjue cried out in alarm as his expression changed. He immediately shouted and forcefully changed the direction of his battle spear to attack the blade light.</p><p>With a loud boom, Yin tianjue’s body trembled slightly as he took a few steps back. Every step he took caused a loud boom in the air.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The blade light dissipated and an old man wearing a black robe with a Black Moon embroidered on it appeared in the air.</p><p>“Shangguan, it’s you!”</p><p>Yin tianjue’s face was dark.</p><p>“Ghost moon saber sect’s old ancestor, Shangguan Ming!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi’s face was filled with joy.</p><p>He had thought that the ghost moon saber sect had been destroyed and Shangguan Ming had died in battle. Now it seemed that Shangguan Ming had not died.</p><p>old Shangguan, I didn’t kill you last time. This time, you’ve come to die. This is the will of heaven.</p><p>Yin tianjue sneered.</p><p>“Yin tianjue, and the ten direction sword sect, even if I have to risk my life, I will not let you succeed.”</p><p>Shangguan Ming’s face was full of hatred.</p><p>The ghost moon saber sect had been annihilated, and he had always wanted to take revenge.</p><p>“Shangguan Ming, you’re an old bag of bones. You should go earlier!”</p><p>At this moment, a cold voice came from the distance.</p><p>Then, a slender figure with his hands behind his back stepped through the air.</p><p>In an instant, it appeared in front of him.</p><p>“Qiu Wuyang!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi and Shangguan Ming’s expressions changed.</p><p>Qiu Wuyang, the head of the ten direction sword sect, was actually nearby.</p><p>“Shangguan Ming, I knew that you would not give up and would always want to take revenge. That’s why I didn’t make a move just now. I wanted to lure you out and get rid of you both at the same time,”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang said lightly. His body flashed and together with Duanmu canghai and Yin tianjue, they formed a triangle and surrounded Lin Xueyi and Shangguan Ming.</p><p>Lin Xueyi and Shangguan Ming were leaning against each other, their expressions extremely ugly.</p><p>Qiu Wuyang had planned everything out, and the mystical sword sect had no chance of survival.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>At this moment, a long howl came from below, piercing through the sky.</p><p>Lin Xueyi and the others couldn’t help but look in that direction.</p><p>Over there, Feng Wuji and Duanmu Lin were fighting.</p><p>But at this moment, Feng Wuji was no match for Duanmu Lin. He was covered in blood and one of his arms was broken by Duanmu Lin’s palm.</p><p>haha, Feng Wuji, you’re not the strongest Man in the mystical sword sect, you’re just a piece of trash. If I was born a few years earlier, you wouldn’t even be able to stand out.</p><p>Duanmu Lin laughed loudly. His aura was wild, and his cultivation had actually reached the 4th level of the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Duanmu Lin’s saber slashed out, and Feng Wuji barely managed to block it. He was sent flying for over a thousand meters as blood spurted out of his mouth.</p><p>“Wuji!”</p><p>In the sky, Lin Xueyi was extremely worried.</p><p>hehe, Lin Xueyi, you’ve already lost. Even among the younger generation, the Duanmu family’s geniuses are enough to crush you. The mystical sword sect should have been ruled by someone else a long time ago.</p><p>Duanmu canghai laughed coldly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
