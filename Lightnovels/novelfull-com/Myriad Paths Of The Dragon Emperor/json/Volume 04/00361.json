It was a spectacular sight.</p><p>...</p><p>Their target was a mountain peak to the North of the imperial capital.</p><p>The distance of a hundred miles was covered in an instant.</p><p>Lu Xiu led the group to a flat land in front of the two mountains.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll first tell you the rules of the preliminaries. The preliminaries are actually very simple. It’s split into two rounds. The first round is to test one’s aura.”</p><p>I’ll test the level of your comprehension of force. Those who haven’t reached major accomplishment will be eliminated!</p><p>Lu Xiu announced.</p><p>“What? He’s going to be eliminated before his force is fully formed?”</p><p>Someone cried out in extreme disappointment.</p><p>good, you see the stone pillar in front, right? it’s the treasure to test force. As long as you input force into this stone pillar, it will appear in different colors. They are divided into blue, purple, silver, and gold, corresponding to the entry level of force, small success, large success, and perfection. Only when the stone pillar appears silver will it be considered a pass. Now, begin!</p><p>Lu Xiu announced.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest nodded. This rule was simple.</p><p>“I’ll go first!”</p><p>A skinny young man took the lead and walked out with great confidence.</p><p>He walked in front of the stone pillar and struck out with his palm. A powerful wind force surged out of his palm and poured into the stone pillar.</p><p>Instantly, the stone pillar emitted a faint silver light, beautiful and magnificent.</p><p>wind force, early stage of major accomplishment. Pass. Next!</p><p>Lu Xiu announced. Naturally, there were people registering at the side.</p><p>“I’ll do it.”</p><p>A strong young man walked out and a strong aura poured into the stone pillar.</p><p>The stone pillar immediately emitted a silver light, which was darker than the youth’s.</p><p>force of earth, mid-stage of great completion. Pass. Next.</p><p>Lu Xiu announced.</p><p>Then, one by one, the young men stepped forward to take the test.</p><p>These young men had all reached the peak level of their control force. Some of them were at the early stage of the peak level, some were at the middle stage, and only a few of them had reached the late stage.</p><p>Those youths who had not reached the level of great accomplishment did not even step forward to take the test.</p><p>“I’m going too!”</p><p>“I’ll go with you!”</p><p>Feng Wuji and Ling Yanchi also went up for the test.</p><p>Feng Wuji had comprehended the force of wind and reached the early stage of the Dacheng realm. Ling Yanchi had comprehended the force of fire and reached the middle stage of the Dacheng realm.</p><p>Soon, more than four hundred people passed the test.</p><p>For geniuses at the level of the scorching sun’s six heroes, most of them had already reached the major accomplishment stage.</p><p>Of course, there were also a few who did not reach that level.</p><p>However, not a single person had reached the peak of Shi.</p><p>Although there was only one step between the great completion and great Perfection of control force, the difference was huge.</p><p>One was flawed while the other was perfect. The difference in power was several times.</p><p>“Yang Liuji has entered the arena!”</p><p>Many people’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Up until now, no one from the cloud Emperor ranking had entered the arena.</p><p>They wanted to see how far the geniuses on the cloud Emperor ranking could go.</p><p>Yang Liuji walked up to the stone pillar, his entire body exuding a burning aura. With a wave of his hand, Shi poured into the stone pillar.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The stone pillar trembled, and an extremely dense silver light spread out, making the entire stone pillar look as if it was made of pure silver.</p><p>“Force of fire, the limit of large success!”</p><p>Lu Xiu announced.</p><p>The limit of the upper tier was just one step away from the great circle.</p><p>This was the first person who had reached the peak of Shi.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was calm. He was not surprised at all. He had fought with yang Liuji before, so he was very clear about the strength of yang Liuji’s force.</p><p>Yang Liuji’s appearance opened the prologue to the appearance of the geniuses on the cloud Emperor list. Then, one by one, the geniuses on the cloud Emperor list appeared.</p><p>However, it was a pity that most of the geniuses on the cloud Emperor list had only reached the limit of the upper tier.</p><p>There were even a few people who were only at the late-stage of the Dacheng realm, and none of them had reached the perfection realm.</p><p>Even those ranked in the top 10 on the cloud Emperor ranking were only at the limit of the great completion.</p><p>“It’s the fire spirit Prince’s turn!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>Young master Huo Ling strode forward with a cold and arrogant expression, but he was only at the peak of the profound level.</p><p>Following that, Qiu changkong, Yan feixun, and LAN Yundao stepped forward one by one. Unfortunately, none of them had reached the peak of their astral force.</p><p>From this, one could see how difficult it was to reach perfection.</p><p>“I’m going to take the test, do you want to come with me?”</p><p>Xie nianqing glanced at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>The two of them stepped forward and attracted a lot of attention.</p><p>LAN Yun said. Yan feixun and Qiu changkong turned their cold gazes over.</p><p>“I’ll go first, or you go first!”</p><p>Xie nianqing looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Anything is fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Then you go first!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward. A scorching aura burst out from his body. The power of the fire surged into the stone pillar and it turned pure silver immediately.</p><p>“The force of fire is at the limit of perfection!</p><p>Lu Xiu announced.</p><p>Many people were not too surprised. Since Lu Ming could defeat yang Liuji, his comprehension of force would naturally not be bad. It was normal for him to reach the limit of large success.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and took a few steps back.</p><p>During this period of time, he had cultivated the force of fire to the limit of large success, but it was difficult to break through to perfection.</p><p>As for wind force, it had also reached the limit of the small success stage and was about to break through to the large success stage.</p><p>Lu Ming believed that the power of the fusion of the two types of Shi would not be inferior to that of a perfected Shi.</p><p>Lu Ming retreated while Xie nianqing stepped forward.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>All of a sudden, a terrifying aura erupted from Xie nianqing’s body as he was surrounded by a green light.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>This was the force of the wind. The powerful force of the wind gushed into the stone pillar.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The stone pillar began to shake violently. In the next moment, golden rays of light began to spread out.</p><p>“Golden light, it’s golden light!”</p><p>Someone shouted!</p><p>perfect force! This woman has already cultivated her force to perfect force! How terrifying!</p><p>“What a monster! Why haven’t I heard of him before?”</p><p>The surroundings were filled with clamors and cries of alarm.</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned as well, then he sighed. A seventh level King level Blood Meridian was indeed terrifying. Even his comprehension of force was unique.</p><p>Yan feixun, LAN Yundao, and Qiu changkong’s eyes were filled with killing intent.</p><p>Jian Fengyun, young master Tian she, and Jiang hongwen’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Especially young master Tian she, who was staring at Xie nianqing with greed and lust in his eyes.</p><p>Feng Wuji and Ling Yanchi’s mouths were wide open in shock.</p><p>“Wind force, perfect, good, good!”</p><p>Lu Xiu laughed heartily.</p><p>The stronger the geniuses in the cloud Emperor mountain range, the more contribution he would make and the corresponding rewards would be given. Naturally, he was happy.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Xie nianqing retracted his essential Qi and walked to Lu Ming’s side. He pursed his lips provocatively as if to say,’do you see that?’ I’m stronger than you!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly and touched his nose.</p><p>“Next!”</p><p>Lu Xiu shouted.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>Jiang hongwen strode forward, waved his hand, and a force landed on the stone pillar.</p><p>The stone pillar trembled, and then, it also emitted a golden light.</p><p>Force, perfection!</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>Then, young master Tian she stepped forward. His body trembled slightly, and a long snake-like force slammed into the stone pillar. The next moment, golden light filled the air.</p><p>“It’s your turn!”</p><p>Young master Tian she looked at Jian Fengyun.</p><p>Jian Fengyun smiled. He didn’t move, but two sword lights shot out from his eyes.</p><p>This was a sword light condensed from Shi, and it landed on the stone pillar.</p><p>The stone pillar trembled violently and emitted a rich golden light.</p><p>Similarly, force, perfection.</p><p>Only four people’s Shi had reached perfection.</p><p>They were Jian Fengyun, young master Tian she, Jiang hongwen, and the rising star, Xie nianqing.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
