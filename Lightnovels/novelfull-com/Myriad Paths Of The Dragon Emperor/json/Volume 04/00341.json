Countless soldiers in iron armor were fighting, and corpses were strewn all over the ground.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Tens of thousands of meters above the mystical sword sect, two extremely bright sword radiances were clashing, as if they could split the sky.</p><p>Tens of thousands of sword Qi swept out, and the collision of their forces was terrifying.</p><p>“Duanmu canghai, why did your Duanmu family betray the mystical sword sect? The mystical sword sect has treated you well!”</p><p>The sect leader Lin Xueyi howled towards the sky, her voice filled with grief and indignation.</p><p>The two people in the sky were Lin Xueyi and the old ancestor of the Duanmu family, the Father of The White Tiger Hall’s headmaster, Duanmu pojun, Duanmu canghai.</p><p>it’s simple. The Duanmu family has been working hard for the mystical sword sect for almost a thousand years, but we can only live in a corner. The mystical sword sect should have belonged to the Duanmu family long ago.</p><p>On Duanmu canghai’s aged face, a cold smile could be seen.</p><p>“Haha, so the ten direction Sword School made such a promise to you. But Duanmu canghai, do you think that the ten direction Sword School will keep their promise after this? How can you still be so naive at your age?”</p><p>Lin Xueyi smiled bitterly.</p><p>“There’s no need for you to worry about that. Rest in peace. The mystical sword sect will definitely flourish with each passing day in my hands.”</p><p>also, don’t even think that the Scarlet heaven Valley will come to your rescue. A large number of experts from the Shi Fang sword sect and the heavenly Devil cult have gathered in the Scarlet heaven Valley. Now, the Scarlet heaven Valley can’t even take care of itself. As long as I kill you all and combine all our forces, I can flatten the Scarlet heaven Valley in one fell swoop.</p><p>Duanmu canghai sneered.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them exchanged a few moves in a row, and the space was shaking wildly.</p><p>This was a life and death battle between half-step Kings.</p><p>“Ah!” Ah!</p><p>Screams of pain came from all over the mystical sword sect, causing Xue Lin’s eyes to turn red.</p><p>Every scream could mean the death of a mystical sword sect disciple.</p><p>Lin Xueyi’s heart was bleeding.</p><p>When the ghost moon saber sect was in trouble, Lin Xueyi already knew that something was wrong and had called back most of the mystical sword sect’s experts in case of an accident.</p><p>They had also mobilized hundreds of thousands of elite troops from the major cities to guard the mystical sword sect.</p><p>Sure enough, five days ago, the ten direction Sword School had launched a large-scale attack. Apart from hundreds of thousands of troops, there were also a large number of martial arts powerhouses.</p><p>The mystical sword sect was caught in a Great War.</p><p>However, the mystical sword sect had the home ground advantage. With the five great academies as the base of the formation, they activated the five ultimate formation.</p><p>With the five ultimate formations, the ten direction sword sect would not be able to enter.</p><p>After four days of intense battle, the mystical sword sect was as stable as Mount Tai.</p><p>However, Lin Xueyi and the rest did not expect that the Duanmu family would rebel at this moment.</p><p>They destroyed the five ultimate arrays in one fell swoop and attacked the mystical sword sect crazily with the help of the ten direction sword sect.</p><p>The mystical sword sect was caught off guard and suffered countless casualties. In the end, under Lin Xueyi’s leadership, they fought back and barely stabilized the situation.</p><p>In the sky not far away from the two of them, there were also two people engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>The shockwaves from the battle between the two were not any smaller than Duanmu canghai and Lin Xueyi.</p><p>These were also two half-step King Warriors.</p><p>One was from the ten direction sword sect, and the other was from the mystical sword sect.</p><p>The mystic essence sword sect originally had three half-step Kings, but now that Duanmu canghai had betrayed them, only two were left.</p><p>In addition to the peak battle in the sky, fierce battles were also taking place in other places.</p><p>In the Vermillion Bird Hall in the South, the Vermillion Bird Hall’s director Yan LAN was engaged in a fierce battle with The White Tiger Hall’s director Duanmu pojun. They would not rest until one of them was dead.</p><p>In the Vermillion Bird Hall, Mu Lan let out a long cry. Sword light surged and killed an expert from the ten directions sword sect.</p><p>By now, Mu Lan’s cultivation had already broken through to the martial arts Grandmaster realm. Moreover, it had reached an extremely profound level.</p><p>In the Azure Dragon Court of the East, Zhang Muyun was one with his sword as he fought with an expert from the ten directions sword sect.</p><p>“Duanmu family, I swear to my death that I will never associate with you!” Ling Kong bellowed from The White Tiger Hall in the West.</p><p>Ling Kong bellowed as he charged out of The White Tiger Hall, his body covered in blood.</p><p>In the sky above Qilin court, the battle between the two young men attracted a lot of attention.</p><p>Many of the people in the battle looked over from time to time.</p><p>This was because these two people were too famous in the mystical sword sect.</p><p>Feng Wuji, one of the six heroes.</p><p>The other person was actually Duanmu Lin.</p><p>At this moment, Duanmu Lin and Feng Wuji were engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>The two of them continued to bombard each other with terrifying power.</p><p>“Duanmu Lin is too shocking. He actually managed to fight to a draw with Feng Wuji?”</p><p>“Feng Wuji has already broken through to the 4th level of the martial ancestor realm a while ago, but Duanmu Lin is not any weaker than him. This is shocking, too shocking!”</p><p>Many of the elders and deacons of the mystical sword sect could not help but feel shocked during the battle.</p><p>Duanmu Lin was a rare genius with an astonishing cultivation speed. The others were also constantly improving, but he had actually caught up.</p><p>“Feng Wuji, is this your true strength? You’ve really disappointed me. If I was born a few years earlier, I would’ve already trampled you under my feet.”</p><p>Duanmu Lin let out a long hiss and was extremely arrogant.</p><p>“Duanmu Lin, no matter how strong you are, you’re just a traitor. You’ll be punished by the world!”</p><p>Feng Wuji howled.</p><p>what a joke, Feng Wuji, you’re really a joke. The winner is the king and the loser is the villain. History is written by the winner, don’t you know this? ”</p><p>Duanmu Lin laughed.</p><p>The two of them continued to battle, and it was extremely intense.</p><p>In the sky, Lin Xueyi and Duanmu canghai’s battle was getting more and more intense.</p><p>“Duanmu canghai, you’re too naïve if you think you can destroy us with just your abilities.”</p><p>Lin Xuelin shouted angrily.</p><p>“Who said it’s only them!”</p><p>At this moment, a domineering voice came from the distance.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss</p><p>Then, a hissing sound spread out.</p><p>Upon hearing this voice, Duanmu canghai was overjoyed and he laughed, ” “Haha, we’ve finally arrived!”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>In the distance, a fiery red light flashed like lightning.</p><p>The next moment, the light disappeared, and a huge, ferocious centipede appeared in the air.</p><p>This centipede was really huge. It was more than 100 meters long and its body was red. The most shocking thing was that it had three pairs of huge wings.</p><p>The two sides of its body were covered with dense claws. The claws cut through the void like blades.</p><p>On the back of the centipede, there were dozens of people. Each of them had a strong aura, like a mountain.</p><p>The person in the lead was dressed in iron armor, and his aura was as deep as the ocean.</p><p>“Thousand-foot giant centipede, Yin moon South-conquering king!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi roared in disbelief.</p><p>On the back of the giant centipede was the yin Yue Empire’s Lord Zhennan, Yin tianjue.</p><p>“Hahaha, Lin Xueyi, how about we join forces and destroy the mystical sword sect?”</p><p>Yin tianjue laughed.</p><p>“Despicable! How dare you collude with the Dark Moon Empire!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi roared in anger.</p><p>“What collusion? [ it is only cooperation. There are no eternal enemies in the world, only eternal interests. Lin Xueyi, you are a sect leader, don’t you understand this? ] No wonder he was defeated!”</p><p>Duanmu canghai’s shriveled face revealed a sinister smile that was extremely horrifying.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
