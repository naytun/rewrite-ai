On top of the original four silver chakras, a fifth chakra was formed.</p><p>His second bloodline had advanced to the fifth tier of the king level.</p><p>When the second bloodline reached the fifth tier of the king class, the mist on the stele seemed to have thinned a little, but the words on the stele were still unclear.</p><p>He could only vaguely make out three words.</p><p>At that moment, a loud boom was heard from within Lu Ming’s body. An extremely powerful aura soared into the sky and blasted a huge hole in the three-colored primordial fire above his head.</p><p>Lu Ming broke through to the early stage of the eighth level martial arts Grandmaster realm in one go.</p><p>At this time, the energy of the pill residue was finally completely refined.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming opened his eyes and two beams of light shot out from his eyes, reaching hundreds of meters away.</p><p>“Martial ancestor 8-stage, too strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming felt the essential Qi in his body that was more than ten times stronger than before and was overjoyed.</p><p>Not only that, even the two types of blood meridians had been upgraded to the fifth level of the king level. This had saved Lu Ming a lot of blood essence.</p><p>Moreover, the nine Dragon bloodline had advanced three levels in a row, and its devouring power was more than ten times stronger. When it was used, its influence on others would also be greatly enhanced.</p><p>“What kind of pill is that? It’s just a tiny bit of residue, but it’s able to raise my cultivation and bloodline at a crazy rate. How terrifying would it be if it was a whole pill?”</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming hurriedly looked up.</p><p>A stone egg the size of a human head was floating there, emitting a strong light. Unlike before, the stone egg was filled with a strong Qi of life, unlike before, where there was only a trace of it.</p><p>“What is this egg? He’s actually able to refine an entire pill. This is too terrifying.”</p><p>Lu Ming screamed in his heart.</p><p>He had only refined a trace of the residue and he had almost burst. If the entire pill were to be consumed, Lu Ming had no doubt that he would burst instantly.</p><p>As for the stone egg, it was actually refined in its entirety. It was truly somewhat evil.</p><p>The life force within the stone egg became stronger and stronger.</p><p>“What’s inside? It can’t be about to hatch, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself and looked at the stone egg with anticipation.</p><p>Unfortunately, he was disappointed.</p><p>After the stone egg emitted a bright light, it quickly fell silent.</p><p>Even the fluctuations of life became silent.</p><p>“It didn’t hatch, but refined an entire pill without any floating essence? It can’t be?”</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p><p>At this moment, the stone egg slowly floated down and landed in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out his hand but it did not move.</p><p>“Why is it so heavy?”</p><p>Lu Ming began to exert his strength and burst out his essential Qi at the same time. At this time, the stone egg was slowly lifted up by Lu Ming.</p><p>“This … Isn’t this too heavy? Previously, it was only about a million Jin, but now it’s at least ten million Jin!”</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely shocked.</p><p>What kind of egg was this? it was ridiculously heavy.</p><p>“Collect!”</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea. He wanted to keep the stone egg in the Supreme shrine, but the stone egg was in his hand and did not move at all.</p><p>“No way? It can’t be taken in!”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He continued to try but gave up after a while.</p><p>Previously, it could still be stored in the Supreme shrine. However, now, it could not even store the Supreme shrine, let alone a storage ring. It was completely useless.</p><p>“Don’t tell me that I have to carry this stone egg that weighs ten million Jin and walk around randomly in the future? Then I’ll be dead tired!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were wide open, staring at the stone egg. He was speechless.</p><p>However, he could not bear to throw away the stone egg.</p><p>This stone egg was too strange. It might have an extraordinary origin. Lu Ming could not bear to give it up.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the stone egg in Lu Ming’s hand moved. It emitted a faint glow and flew a few rounds in the air. At the same time, the stone egg’s size began to shrink rapidly. In the end, it shrank to the size of a fingertip and landed on a strand of Lu Ming’s hair beside his ear. It hung on his hair and swayed, but he could not feel any weight at all.</p><p>“This works too?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets. After a while, he was overjoyed.</p><p>This was also good. He had solved a big problem.</p><p>“Now, people of the nether demon Palace, wait for me!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked up, his eyes shining.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming walked to the side of the furnace and climbed up the mountain.</p><p>There was an inscription formation here, so he couldn’t fly.</p><p>Lu Ming was like a monkey, climbing up the walls of the furnace. When he entered the three-colored primordial fire, the stone egg in his hair glowed faintly and a cooling sensation spread through his body. The three-colored primordial fire had no effect on Lu Ming.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming passed through the layers of flames and returned to the platform.</p><p>Above, there was no one else. The people from the nether demon Palace must have followed the two chains and entered the tunnel ahead.</p><p>Lu Ming moved. He stepped on the iron chain and dashed to the opposite side. When he reached the opposite side, he ran forward at top speed.</p><p>After a few miles, Lu Ming felt his body become lighter. The surrounding pressure had disappeared and Lu Ming could fly again.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure instantly sped up by dozens of times as he rushed forward.</p><p>After a few breaths, they had rushed through the long passage and a shout came from ahead.</p><p>quick, quick, dig up these spiritual herbs. Some of them are extinct in the outside world. If we bring them back to the sect and sell them, their value will be immeasurable!</p><p>A rough voice sounded.</p><p>From the voice, it was the voice of the tall youth from the nether demon Palace.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure dashed out and a wide grassland came into view.</p><p>The grassland was a few hundred mu wide. On the grassland, there were all kinds of spiritual herbs.</p><p>There were Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, and all the way to Level 4 spirit herbs.</p><p>There were all kinds of them, full of vitality, and some of them had strange shapes that he had never seen before.</p><p>This was a real herbal field.</p><p>However, he did not find any traces of Level 5 spiritual herbs.</p><p>“It’s you?”</p><p>The moment Lu Ming rushed out, he naturally alerted the people from the nether demon Palace.</p><p>More than twenty pairs of eyes looked at Lu Ming in unison. When they saw Lu Ming, they could not help but be stunned.</p><p>“Brat, you fell into the three-colored primordial fire and you didn’t die!”</p><p>You feishi called out in disbelief.</p><p>“If you’re not dead, how can I be dead?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and his eyes turned cold.</p><p>“Haha, kid, I don’t know if you’re stupid or brainless. I don’t know what method you used to escape from the three colored primordial fire, but since you’ve escaped, you didn’t take the opportunity to escape. Instead, you came here to die. You’re the only one in the world.”</p><p>You feishi laughed out loud, his tone was filled with contempt.</p><p>laugh, laugh all you want. As a dying man, it doesn’t matter if you laugh a little longer!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled coldly.</p><p>“Brat, you’re the one who’s going to die!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>With a cold shout, a sword light slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>An expert at the peak of the 7th level of the martial ancestor realm made his move.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
