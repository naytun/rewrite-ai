However, no assassins from the Dark Moon Empire came.</p><p>Very soon, they would arrive at Moonview city. According to the three siblings from Ming city, they would only need a few hours to reach Moonview city.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Suddenly, the earth rumbled and trembled.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>At the side, Ming Feng’s expression changed.</p><p>“There’s a large number of cavalry galloping. It looks like there’s a large number of them!”</p><p>Huaying frowned.</p><p>Huaying was well-versed in military tactics and had a very accurate judgment in the field of war.</p><p>“Could it be that my father has sent someone to pick us up?”</p><p>Ming Feng was overjoyed.</p><p>“Impossible! Judging from the sound, there are at least five thousand soldiers! How could they have sent so many people to pick us up in this situation?!”</p><p>Huaying refuted.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and the Army stopped.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming rose into the air and hid in a dark cloud to look ahead.</p><p>A dozen miles ahead, there was a long line of people running along the mountain path.</p><p>Each of them was riding on a huge Wolf. At a glance, there were definitely more than five thousand people, maybe even close to ten thousand.</p><p>One of the flags was embroidered with a Dark Moon on one side and a Wolf on the other.</p><p>“The great army of the Dark Moon Empire!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed slightly.</p><p>He then descended and explained what he had seen.</p><p>“What? How could the Army of the Dark Moon Empire appear here? Could it be that the Moonview city has already been breached?”</p><p>Ming Feng exclaimed.</p><p>“Father!”</p><p>Mingzhu’s voice trembled, filled with worry.</p><p>“I don’t think so. Judging from the number of soldiers and the direction of the March, they are most likely going to take a detour to attack the Moonview city. If I’m not wrong, there should be a big war in the city. In this case, when this Army arrives, the Moonview Army will be attacked from both the front and back!”</p><p>Huaying analyzed.</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but look at Huaying in a new light. He did not expect that Huaying’s analysis of military warfare was so good.</p><p>“Let’s lower our voices and advance stealthily. We’ll set up an ambush in front and annihilate this Army!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and gave the order.</p><p>Immediately, the 20000 strong Army dismounted and led their horses forward, setting up an ambush on a Hill two li away.</p><p>The hill was covered with weeds and small trees, and the energy was two meters high. People and horses couldn’t see it at all.</p><p>At the bottom of the hill, there was a slightly flat mountain path.</p><p>By the time Lu Ming and the rest were well hidden, the Army of the Dark Moon Empire was already approaching.</p><p>OWW! Awooo!</p><p>Wolf howls rang out, and the earth rumbled as an Army galloped over.</p><p>Each soldier was tall and burly. They wore iron armor and carried a bow and a large blade.</p><p>Beneath them were black Wolves that were two meters tall. They howled continuously and emitted a fiendish aura.</p><p>“They’re the famous Grey Wolf Corps of the yinyue Empire!”</p><p>Huaying’s expression changed slightly.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. He had heard of the Dark Moon Empire’s grey Wolf Army.</p><p>Most of the land of the Dark Moon Empire was made up of boundless grasslands and Highlands, on which countless demon beasts were born.</p><p>Therefore, the cavalrymen of the Dark Moon Empire were very famous.</p><p>Depending on the type of mount, it could be divided into multiple legions, such as the grey wolf Legion, the Bloodmoon demonic Tiger Legion, and so on.</p><p>They were extremely powerful.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Accompanied by the howls of the wolves, the front troops of the grey wolf Army charged through the mountain road below.</p><p>Lu Ming did not make a move. It was not the time yet. It would be best to make a move after more people had rushed past.</p><p>Very quickly, more than half of the grey wolf Army had charged through.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>He was the first to rush down.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>…</p><p>The 20 thousand strong Army mounted their green scale horses and roared as they charged down the mountain slope.</p><p>“Not good, enemy attack!”</p><p>The grey wolf Army roared.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and rushed down the hill in an instant. He condensed a huge spear that was hundreds of meters long and swept it out.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>In an instant, dozens of ash Wolf cavalrymen, along with their metal armors and mounts, were destroyed by Lu Ming’s spear.</p><p>Blood, flesh, and bones splattered all over the place. Even the metal armor exploded into pieces and shot out in all directions, piercing through the armor of the other soldiers of the grey wolf Army and killing them.</p><p>Lu Ming had killed more than fifty armored soldiers with one shot.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming swept his spear again and another fifty or so soldiers were killed.</p><p>“Swallow!”</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the nine Dragons ‘bloodline. His left palm was like a vortex, emitting a powerful devouring force. All the blood essence was devoured by Lu Ming.</p><p>Although most of these sergeants were at the warrior realm and some were at the master realm, and only a few of them were grandmasters, there were many of them. Lu Ming would not let them go.</p><p>There was also the blood essence of the ash Wolf.</p><p>Huhu ~</p><p>Drops of blood essence were all devoured by Lu Ming and he was refining them crazily.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At this moment, the Army on the hill had also arrived. They had cut the ash Wolf Army into several pieces and surrounded them separately.</p><p>The scene was in a chaotic battle.</p><p>“Damn it, die!”</p><p>More than a dozen generals in iron armor with powerful auras rose into the air and charged toward Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Clearly, these were the martial grandmasters of this Army.</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>Lu Ming rushed forward, and Hua Ying and the other martial Grandmaster powerhouses also went to meet him.</p><p>Lu Ming had his eyes on a fifth level martial arts Grandmaster at first sight.</p><p>This person should be the strongest person in this Army.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming swung his spear and the general’s armor was destroyed. He coughed up blood and was sent flying backward.</p><p>“This person is too strong, I can’t fight him!”</p><p>The general was so scared that his soul almost flew away. He turned around and tried to escape.</p><p>However, the next moment …</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>A long spear pierced through his heart, killing him.</p><p>Lu Ming devoured his blood essence and turned to kill the others.</p><p>The dozen or so martial Grandmaster powerhouses were not enough for them to kill. It did not take long for them to kill all of them.</p><p>They then charged at the ash Wolf cavalry.</p><p>The ash Wolf cavalry had a small number of about 10000 men to begin with. In addition, Lu Ming’s group had ambushed them, so they naturally had the upper hand. When Lu Ming and the other martial arts grandmasters joined in, the battle would be even more one-sided.</p><p>An hour later, the battle was over.</p><p>More than ten thousand Grey Wolf cavalry had been killed, their corpses strewn across the forest.</p><p>“Calculate the number of casualties!”</p><p>Lu Ming instructed. He waited while refining the blood essence.</p><p>Not long after, his body glowed with a blood-red light as his blood essence was completely refined.</p><p>“I still haven’t advanced!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart.</p><p>At this time, the number of casualties had already been reported.</p><p>Two thousand and nine people died in battle, and several thousand were injured.</p><p>This number made Lu Ming’s heart tremble.</p><p>It was beyond Lu Ming’s expectations that so many people had died in battle.</p><p>“The ash Wolf cavalry are too strong!”</p><p>At the side, Huaying sighed.</p><p>In this battle, they had launched a surprise attack and had double the number of people. Even with the help of the martial arts grandmasters, they had lost more than two thousand people. It was clear how strong the grey wolf cavalry were.</p><p>If it was a head-on battle, the elites of the royal family that Lu Ming had brought along would not be his match at all.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
