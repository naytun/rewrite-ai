It would be an invincible army.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and smiled. This was just a thought. It was too difficult to realize.</p><p>The bloodred scaled Wolf was easy to deal with, but it was too difficult to deal with thirty thousand master realm experts.</p><p>Now, including the original 60000 men in the northern Battlefront Army, Lu Ming had less than 5000 master realm martial artists under his command.</p><p>Unless it was a force like the five great sects.</p><p>For example, in the mystical sword sect, other than the young disciples, there were many martial artists over the age of thirty. The total number of master realm martial artists could probably exceed a hundred thousand.</p><p>But that was the result of many years of accumulation.</p><p>In the past few days, there was no movement in the yinyue Army. It seemed that after that battle, the yinyue Army also needed to rest.</p><p>Lu Ming simply led the blood red Cavalry and charged deep into the plateau to capture the blood red scaled Wolf.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming rode on the bloodscaled Wolf King and sprinted forward. Beside him, Xie nianqing rode on another bloodscaled Wolf King and followed closely.</p><p>On the other side, Qiu Yue was also riding on a bloodred scaled Wolf and following them.</p><p>Qiu Yue was in a good mood when she saw Lu Ming. She had a bright smile on her face every day and followed Lu Ming around, just like the little servant girl from back then.</p><p>This made Xie nianqing grit his teeth. He kept muttering that Lu Ming was a pervert, making Lu Ming smile bitterly.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>The Army of bloodred scaled wolves whizzed past, heading towards the depths of the wilderness. Lu Ming let the bloodred scaled Wolf King lead the way.</p><p>After a few hours, they arrived at a huge Valley.</p><p>OWW! Awooo!</p><p>Wolf howls rang out from the valley, and then, one after another, bloodscaled wolves appeared.</p><p>“As expected, there are more!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>It was obvious that this was another tribe of the Crimson scaled wolves.</p><p>OWW!</p><p>A loud wolf howl rang out, and an extremely huge bloodred scaled Wolf with a fiendish aura walked out.</p><p>Whether it was in terms of size or aura, this bloodred scaled Wolf was not inferior to the bloodred scaled Wolf King that Lu Ming was riding.</p><p>It was obvious that this was the king of the bloodred scaled wolves.</p><p>OWW! OWW!</p><p>The bloodscaled Wolf Kings under Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s legs howled as if they were communicating with the other bloodscaled Wolf King.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>After a while, the bloodscaled Wolf King growled at Lu Ming. Its eyes were filled with doubt, and finally, a provocative glint.</p><p>“It seems that strength speaks the loudest!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly, then his body moved and he pounced on the bloodscaled Wolf King.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The bloodscaled Wolf King also pounced forward. A man and a Wolf engaged in a fierce battle.</p><p>Half an hour later, when Lu Ming continued on his journey, there were more than five thousand Crimson scaled wolves behind him.</p><p>This was the number of bloodscale wolves that had appeared.</p><p>The bloodscaled Wolf King had become Qiu Yue’s Mount.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not satisfied and continued to search the plateau.</p><p>On the plateau, there were countless red blood Wolves. They had lived here for countless years.</p><p>In three days ‘time, Lu Ming had found five Crimson blood scaled wolves.</p><p>The strongest group of Crimson bloodscaled wolves had more than ten thousand of them.</p><p>The worst only had 2000.</p><p>Through the two bloodscale Wolf Kings at the start, Lu Ming’s strength, and the pressure from the moonhowl Wolf King’s aura on Lu Ming and Xie nianqing, these bloodscale wolves were subdued one by one.</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming’s number of Crimson scaled wolves exceeded thirty thousand, reaching about thirty-two thousand.</p><p>At this point, Lu Ming had no choice but to stop.</p><p>This was because the demonic beasts that appeared in the deeper parts of the plateau were too powerful. Some of them had reached eighth grade fourth level, and some had even reached ninth grade fourth level. If Lu Ming and the others continued to advance, they would probably suffer heavy losses.</p><p>However, 30,000 of them were more than enough.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming brought the bloodred scaled Wolf back to Moonview city.</p><p>Needless to say, it naturally caused a tsunami-like shock.</p><p>The mountain Battlefront Army was extremely envious, while the former Northern Battlefront Army who had joined Lu Ming was ecstatic.</p><p>Lu Ming was not stingy. He gave a few hundred to Ming Meng.</p><p>As for the rest, Lu Ming chose the strongest among the thirty thousand over men to form a Crimson scaled Wolf cavalry.</p><p>The number of people was 31000.</p><p>One thousand of them were called the blood red Guards. They had the strongest cultivation and were the most elite. They were Lu Ming’s guards.</p><p>The other 30000 people formed a large Army. Lu Ming temporarily handed over the management and training to Huaying.</p><p>Huaying’s Mount had also changed to a Crimson Wolf King, which made it easier to manage.</p><p>Lu Ming was happy and relaxed.</p><p>Other than sparring with Qiu Yue occasionally, he spent most of his time cultivating.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged in the Supreme shrine.</p><p>He had just refined a few hundred spiritual herbs and cultivated the ten thousand spiritual combat body to increase his physical strength.</p><p>At this moment, he stopped cultivating.</p><p>“The nine Dragons heaven treading steps is really difficult to cultivate. It has been so many days, but I still haven’t completed the first step. However, I feel like I’ve gained some insight recently. As long as I continue to comprehend it, I’ll be able to cultivate it sooner or later.”</p><p>there’s still the third palm of the three Dao palms, the heaven’s path palm. I don’t have a clue either. If I can cultivate it, it’ll definitely become my trump card!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>Now, cultivating the true war Dragon technique and comprehending force were things he had to do every day. The other thing he had to do was cultivate all sorts of martial arts techniques.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that he did not have enough time every day.</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming’s hand moved and a storage ring appeared.</p><p>“A King’s storage ring, what’s inside?”</p><p>Looking at the storage ring, Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with strong anticipation.</p><p>That’s right. The storage ring belonged to the martial King that Lu Ming had obtained in the Dongyi tribe’s ancestral ruins.</p><p>Lu Ming had even fought with Xie nianqing over the storage ring. In the end, Xie nianqing chose a small Jade sword.</p><p>There was a powerful inscription array on the storage ring. In the past, Lu Ming could not break it at all. He could only slowly grind it down.</p><p>However, recently, Lu Ming felt that the inscription array on the storage ring had loosened and was about to be broken.</p><p>“Today, I’ll completely break it!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes gleamed and his hands glowed. Powerful essential Qi surged into the storage ring.</p><p>The storage ring was suspended in the air, surrounded by a circle of light. However, the light screen had become very thin and was on the verge of collapse under Lu Ming’s essential Qi.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>charge! Lu Ming shouted. His war Dragon true Qi circulated continuously and charged toward the light screen like miniature true dragons.</p><p>Suddenly, the light curtain emitted a bright light and expanded rapidly. When it expanded to a few meters wide, it exploded with a bang.</p><p>The inscription formation on the storage ring had been broken.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He grabbed the storage ring and immersed his mind into it.</p><p>“It’s so big!”</p><p>His first impression was that the space in the storage ring was extremely huge. Lu Ming estimated that it could fit an entire mountain.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming saw the mountain-like pile of items in the storage ring.</p><p>“What is this? Spirit weapons, armors, pills, and cultivation technique manuals!”</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze and had a rough idea.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
