He stood there without moving.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, a loud roar came from the sky. A tall and burly figure descended from the sky and landed heavily between Lu Ming and the two elders, leaving a huge pit in the ground.</p><p>Golden-eyed blood corpse!</p><p>This tall figure was actually the Golden-eyed blood corpse.</p><p>“We’ve finally arrived!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile.</p><p>Just now, when he came out of the stone house, he noticed the demon suppressing token’s abnormality. He noticed that the Golden-eyed blood corpse was near su Tiancheng and was probably looking for him.</p><p>He wasn’t surprised that the Golden-eyed blood corpse was able to escape from the yin Yue Empire’s assassins.</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood corpse had already reached the early stage of martial ancestor realm level 9, and its body was like Vajra. If it wanted to escape, even a half-step King warrior might not be able to kill it.</p><p>When Lu Ming discovered that the Golden-eyed blood corpse was nearby, he immediately used the demon suppressing token to summon the Golden-eyed blood corpse. He also deliberately talked to Yin Jiufeng and the others to stall for time. Finally, the Golden-eyed blood corpse arrived.</p><p>“Goldeneye, kill them!”</p><p>Lu Ming ordered.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood corpse roared and pounced forward.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>In just one exchange, the two eighth grade martial ancestor realm elders that Yin Jiufeng had brought with him screamed and flew back.</p><p>On each of their bodies, there was an additional claw wound. Where the claws had scratched, the flesh and blood had disappeared, revealing the White bones. It was extremely horrifying.</p><p>This scene was too sudden, and Yin Jiufeng was immediately stunned.</p><p>Mo Ying, who was beside Lu Ming, was also stunned.</p><p>She realized that she could not see through Lu Ming at all.</p><p>Since the first time she saw Lu Ming and heard him call out ‘Qi is divided into yin and yang’, Lu Ming had brought her a series of surprises.</p><p>In her opinion, Lu Ming was a mystery, an unfathomable mystery.</p><p>Now, there was actually a 9th level martial arts Grandmaster taking orders from him.</p><p>“Monster, run! Take the young prince away!”</p><p>An old man roared.</p><p>He wanted to rush over and take Yin Jiufeng away, but it was already too late.</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood corpse roared and rushed out. It waved its claws and the claw rays were like heavenly blades.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>In just a few moves, the two old men were torn into two by the Golden-eyed blood zombies and died an unnatural death.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Yin Jiufeng screamed in fear, his face as white as paper and his body trembling.</p><p>The four experts his father had sent to help him had been killed just like that, leaving him all alone.</p><p>“Now, it’s your turn!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Yin Jiufeng with a smile.</p><p>However, in Yin Jiufeng’s eyes, Lu Ming’s smile was more terrifying than a demon’s.</p><p>“Mo family head, mo family head, quickly save me, quickly save me!”</p><p>Yin Jiufeng shouted with all his might.</p><p>However, the head of the mo family did not even look at him.</p><p>What a joke, to save him?</p><p>Right now, everyone from the mo family was locked in a battle with the flame spring. They could not even take care of themselves, so how could they have the time to save him?</p><p>“It seems that no one will come to save you!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled again and walked towards Yin Jiufeng step by step.</p><p>“No, Lu Ming, don’t kill me. My father is the Duke of the South, and he has a large number of soldiers. If you kill me, you’ll die too. And … And the referee.”</p><p>Yin Jiufeng shouted.</p><p>“What else is there? Last time, I let you off for the sake of the mo family. Are you going to use the mo family to threaten me this time? Besides, you’ve tried to kill me many times. How can I let you go?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression finally turned cold.</p><p>“Don’t!”</p><p>Yin Jiufeng roared, turned around, and ran.</p><p>However, Lu Ming flicked his fingers and a spear ray shot out, piercing through Yin Jiufeng’s back.</p><p>Yin Jiufeng screamed and fell to the ground. He screamed repeatedly, but he didn’t die.</p><p>Lu Ming walked over and squatted down to look at Yin Jiufeng.</p><p>“Save me, save me!”</p><p>Yin Jiufeng struggled with all his might, blood flowing out of his mouth.</p><p>“Save you? I’ll tell you another secret, and you won’t ask me to save you anymore. I have another name, and that is Tian Yun.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and whispered in Yin Jiufeng’s ear.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Yin Jiufeng’s eyes suddenly widened, revealing a look of despair. He growled, ” “Champion!”</p><p>Before he could even say the word ‘hou’, he had already died.</p><p>The blazing sun Empire’s champion, hou tianyun, was known by all in the yin Yue Empire.</p><p>He killed several powerful legions of the Dark Moon Empire and shocked the Dark Moon Empire.</p><p>Upon hearing that it was tianyun, Yin Jiufeng lost all hope and took his last breath.</p><p>The mo family’s Grandmaster realm martial artists looked at Lu Ming in horror and did not dare to attack him.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Between heaven and earth, only the sound of Yan Quan and the mo family’s battle reverberated.</p><p>The battle between Yan Quan and the mo family was still ongoing.</p><p>It had to be said that the hundred sword battle formation set up by the mo family was indeed very powerful. Even with more than thirty martial ancestor realm experts and the mo family head’s ninth level martial ancestor realm cultivation, they were still able to fight to a draw with Yan Quan, who was at the half step King realm.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, the Golden-eyed blood corpse growled beside Lu Ming, its gaze constantly looking in the direction of the stone house.</p><p>“You’re going to absorb the blood?”</p><p>Lu Ming understood what the Golden-eyed blood corpse meant. The Golden-eyed blood corpse was very thirsty for the flood dragon blood in the underground cave.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>After receiving Lu Ming’s order, the Golden-eyed blood zombie rushed toward the underground cave.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming stood still, refining the blood essence while watching the battle.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body had devoured the blood essence of a few eighth-realm martial arts grandmasters. It was too thick.</p><p>The blood essence was constantly converted into energy and refined into true Qi.</p><p>Lu Ming started to aim for the fourth level of the martial arts Grandmaster realm.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming’s body let out a dull sound. He had broken through to the fourth level of the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>Just as Lu Ming broke through to the fourth tier martial ancestor realm, the nine Dragon bloodline suddenly let out a long howl. It rushed out of Lu Ming’s body and howled towards the sky.</p><p>At the same time, the body of the nine Dragon bloodlines changed rapidly.</p><p>It was originally a Python that was more than ten meters long, but it was now rapidly growing longer and thicker. The scales on its body became more crystal clear.</p><p>Then, four claws grew out of the Python’s belly, like dragon claws.</p><p>On the top of its head, there were two horns.</p><p>A flood Dragon. This was the image of a flood Dragon.</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons had evolved.</p><p>After devouring an astonishing amount of blood essence and a flood dragon’s soul, the bloodline of the nine Dragons finally began to evolve.</p><p>From the Python form, it had evolved into the flood dragon form.</p><p>OWW!</p><p>The flood Dragon of the bloodline of the nine Dragons roared into the sky, and a bright silver chakra appeared on its body.</p><p>King level bloodline.</p><p>The great martial masters of the mo family and Mo Ying were all dumbfounded.</p><p>Even the mo family’s martial arts grandmasters in the battle and Yan Quan looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>Bloodlines could actually evolve? From ordinary to King level?</p><p>This was too shocking, simply unheard of.</p><p>He had never seen such a record in the ancient records.</p><p>“This young man is too extraordinary!”</p><p>Yan Quan’s eyes were bright, and no one knew what he was thinking.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
