You dare to hit me? You’re going against your superior, you’re disgraceful!”</p><p>Pa!</p><p>Lu Ming responded with a slap. The young prince did not even have time to react before he was slapped in the face by Lu Ming. He spun three times before he stopped.</p><p>He looked at Lu Ming in a daze, completely dumbfounded.</p><p>Lu Ming actually dared to hit him?</p><p>In the dark Moon Empire, the royal family had supreme authority. His father, Zhennan Wang, led all the troops in the South of the Dark Moon Empire. It could be said that he was a figure who was second only to one person and above all.</p><p>As the only son of the Duke of the South, his status was extremely noble. No one had ever dared to disobey him, let alone hit him.</p><p>He even suspected that he was dreaming.</p><p>However, the piercing pain on his face told him that this was real and not a dream.</p><p>Hence, he shouted hysterically, ” “Argh! You dare to hit me? You dare to hit me? You’re dead. Your whole family is dead. No one can save you.”</p><p>Pa!</p><p>Lu Ming threw another slap at the other side of his face.</p><p>The young Prince’s eyes were filled with stars, and he was completely dumbfounded. He forcibly swallowed back the long string of vicious words that followed.</p><p>you said that you have power, strength, and are high above others, that you see others as lowly ants and can bully them as you wish. But now, I’m stronger than you, so you’re also an ant in front of me. Am I wrong to say that you’re a pile of lowly dog shit? ”</p><p>Lu Ming stared at the young prince and said coldly.</p><p>“F * ck me, f * ck me!”</p><p>The Little Prince’s face was swollen like a pig’s head. He looked at Lu Ming in horror.</p><p>No matter how stupid he was, he could tell that Lu Ming was not afraid of him at all. He did not know what to say at that moment.</p><p>“What’s wrong? You don’t dare to speak? Where’s your courage?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were like two sharp swords, shining and dazzling as he stared at the young prince.</p><p>The young prince felt a chill run down his spine. He retreated and shouted, ” “What do you want to do? My father’s Army is not far from su Tian city. If you dare to touch me, not only will you die, but the mo family will also be buried with you.”</p><p>“Oh, really? Then I’ll kill you first and see what your father can do to me. ”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He was not moved at all. He took a step forward and a cold killing intent burst out, making the scene seem as if it was winter.</p><p>“Don’t!”</p><p>“Don’t!”</p><p>Two loud shouts rang out at the same time.</p><p>One of them was from the young prince. He screamed in fear, almost scared out of his wits.</p><p>The other one was from mo Ying.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned slightly and stopped.</p><p>brother Lu, he is the son of Duke of the South. If he dies in the mo family, Duke of the South will be angry and the mo family will be razed to the ground. Please spare his life, brother Lu.</p><p>Mo Ying requested.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He looked at the young prince and chided,”I’ll spare your life for the sake of miss mo Ying’s plea for you. Hurry up and get lost!”</p><p>The young prince felt as if he had been pardoned. Ignoring the pregnant old man, he turned around and ran off, disappearing from this place in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Lu Ming did not continue to attack. It was not that he let the Tiger return to the mountain. Just like what mo Ying had said, he was not afraid of killing the young prince, but it would definitely implicate mo Ying and the mo family.</p><p>“Brother Lu, I’ve implicated you!”</p><p>Mo Ying walked to Lu Ming’s side and said apologetically.</p><p>“Haha, what does this have to do with you? It’s normal to encounter such brainless idiots everywhere.”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>Immediately after, they helped ah bi heal her injuries.</p><p>Not long after, an angry roar came from a luxurious mansion in su Tian city.</p><p>“Damn little bitch, damn bastard, die! Die! Damn it, if I don’t kill you, I’m not a human.”</p><p>In a large hall, the young Prince’s face was twisted with rage as he roared and smashed the tables and chairs in the hall to pieces.</p><p>On both sides of the hall stood five or six figures, who didn’t even dare to breathe.</p><p>After a while, the young prince Yin Jiufeng gradually calmed down.</p><p>Little Prince, it’s all that little bastard Lu Ming’s doing. I don’t know what kind of drug he used on that b * tch mo Ying. The moment mo Ying saw him, she seemed to be fascinated. How hateful!</p><p>A gloomy voice was heard. It was mo Bing.</p><p>At this time, his legs were still wrapped in a thick cast. Clearly, his legs that were broken by Lu Ming had not recovered.</p><p>Hmph, that little b * tch mo Ying, I thought she was a chaste woman, but she’s just a slut. I wanted to f * ck her first since she was dying. It’s a pity that such a stunner died just like that. Now she’s with that little b * stard. I can’t wait to kill her.</p><p>The young prince Yin Jiufeng said with a sinister expression.</p><p>“Little Prince, that b * tch mo Ying won’t be able to live for long. As for that Lu Ming, I didn’t expect his cultivation to be so high. How should we deal with him?”</p><p>Mo Bing asked.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter. I’ll send a letter to my father later and ask him to send an expert over. At that time, I’ll make him beg for death!”</p><p>Yin Jiufeng gritted his teeth and said in an extremely sinister manner.</p><p>…</p><p>In the next few days, Lu Ming continued to strip mo Ying of her yang-type true Qi. Three days later, the Yang-type true Qi in mo Ying’s body had been completely expelled.</p><p>Mo Ying was relieved, and her Zhen Qi became extremely active. Every day, her face glowed, and she looked more beautiful.</p><p>The mo family’s martial arts practice field was the place where the mo family’s disciples cultivated.</p><p>Once the mo Ying Yang-type true Qi was completely expelled, he brought Lu Ming to the mo family’s martial arts field.</p><p>In the middle of the mo family’s martial arts practice field, there was a huge stone pillar. The stone pillar was crystal clear like jade, and one could tell at a glance that it was not an ordinary item.</p><p>brother Lu, this stone pillar can test my compatibility with the mo family’s ancestor’s inheritance. The higher the compatibility, the more I can obtain the mo family’s ancestor’s inheritance!</p><p>in the past, before my yang-attribute true Qi was dispelled, I was the one with the highest compatibility with the mo family’s ancestor’s inheritance among the younger generation of the mo family. Now that my yang-attribute true Qi has been dispelled, I want to see how compatible I am with the mo family’s ancestor’s inheritance.</p><p>Mo Ying obviously trusted Lu Ming and did not hold back at all.</p><p>“The inheritance of the Mohist’s ancestor?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He could not help but look into the depths of the mo family.</p><p>That place was the place that caused the nine Dragon bloodline to jump for joy. He wondered if it had anything to do with the inheritance of the mo family’s ancestors.</p><p>When mo Ying arrived in front of the stone pillar, she immediately attracted the attention of some of the nearby mo family members.</p><p>“Is mo Ying going to test the compatibility of the ancestor’s inheritance again? She’s already the most powerful person in the younger generation. The inheritance of the ancestor belongs to her, so what’s the point of testing?”</p><p>that’s right. Her compatibility with the ancestor’s inheritance is as high as five stars. Moreover, the compatibility is innate and will not increase after a period of time. I really don’t understand why she came to test it again.</p><p>In the surroundings, some of the mo family’s youngsters were discussing animatedly.</p><p>Mo Ying did not care about this. She put her palm on the stone pillar, and a bloody light flashed on her spine.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this time, the stone pillar suddenly trembled and shone with bright light. In the end, six brilliant stars condensed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
