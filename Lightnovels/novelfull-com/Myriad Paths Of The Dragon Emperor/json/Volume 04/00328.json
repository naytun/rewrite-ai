Blood filled the air and the underground cave kept shaking.</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming and Mo Ying looked at this scene in shock.</p><p>the strange movement of the nine Dragons ‘bloodline came from this blood pool. From the looks of it, there should be flood dragon blood and even flood Dragon Soul inside!</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing.</p><p>“But what’s with that old man?”</p><p>Lu Ming could not figure it out but he was certain that this was not the ancestor’s legacy that the mo family had mentioned.</p><p>Looking at mo Ying’s expression, it was obvious that she didn’t know that he and Mo Ying had been deceived.</p><p>The huge old man’s struggle became more and more intense, as if he could break free at any time.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this time, two old men with almost bald heads and wrinkled faces suddenly appeared on both sides of the cave.</p><p>As soon as the two old men appeared, bright lights flew out of their hands. The lights flew into the walls of the cave, and inscriptions appeared on the walls.</p><p>Countless inscriptions interwove together to form an inscription formation. It condensed into a band of light that flew into the blood pool.</p><p>Immediately, inscriptions appeared on the surface of the blood water and the huge Blood Dragon.</p><p>This caused the power of the blood water dragon to increase greatly, and it suppressed the figure of the huge old man.</p><p>“Argh! Despicable mo family, I’m not willing to accept this!”</p><p>The huge old man’s figure let out an unwilling roar.</p><p>“Suppress!”</p><p>The two elders from the mo family shouted. Their bodies glowed as they controlled the inscription formation to suppress the giant elder’s figure.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>No matter how hard the huge old man struggled, it was still useless, and his movements became smaller and smaller.</p><p>“Start the condensation!”</p><p>One of the elders from the mo family shouted and the other nodded. The two of them moved their palms and dozens of blood water dragons flew out of the blood pool. They roared and pounced at Lu Ming and Mo Ying.</p><p>What was different from before was that these blood water dragons had inscriptions flowing on their bodies, and they were obviously more powerful.</p><p>“Two elders, what are you doing? I’m a disciple of the mo family!”</p><p>Mo Ying was shocked.</p><p>However, the blood water dragon did not stop attacking, so mo Ying could only resist.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>But with just one move, mo Ying was sent flying. Then, a blood water dragon wrapped around mo Ying, trying to drag her into the blood pool.</p><p>“Elder, what are you doing? My mo family’s disciple mo Ying is here to accept our ancestor’s inheritance. Let me go!”</p><p>Mo Ying shouted in fear.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted and swept his long spear repeatedly. The bloody water dragons exploded one after another. Then, he grabbed the bloody water dragons on mo Ying’s body and squeezed them with force, crushing them.</p><p>On both sides of the cave, the two mo family elders ‘expressions changed. They looked at Lu Ming with murderous intent.</p><p>“Blood refining formation, kill!”</p><p>The two elders from the mo family bellowed. The light from the inscription formation in the cave became even more dazzling. In an instant, hundreds of bloody water dragons flew out and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>Of course, these blood water dragons were only a few meters long and could not compare to the huge water dragon that was entangled with the huge old man.</p><p>hahaha, Mohist girl, don’t expect to get out of here alive. What ancestor’s inheritance? I just want to use you to refine the yinyue demonic chief!</p><p>At this moment, the laughter of the old man came from the blood pool.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>These words were like thunder, exploding in mo Ying’s heart.</p><p>Her eyes were filled with disbelief as she screamed, ” “You want me to refine the yin moon devil chief? No, this can’t be true. I don’t believe it!”</p><p>“You don’t believe me? The truth is right in front of you. Little girl, just accept your fate. You’ve been deceived by a group of hypocrites.”</p><p>The old man in the blood pool said.</p><p>“No, this is impossible! Two elders, is this true?”</p><p>Mo Ying looked at the two elders of the mo family.</p><p>as a disciple of the mo family, it’s your honor to make a sacrifice for the mo family. Surrender now!</p><p>The two elders of the mo family spoke. Their faces were extremely cold and emotionless.</p><p>Mo Ying felt as if she was struck by lightning. Her body staggered backward, and her eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>“The Mohist is despicable. They want to use the blood and soul of a Dragon and the two of you as a catalyst to refine me into a puppet without a soul that only listens to orders and only knows how to kill. No way, I won’t yield.”</p><p>The old man roared in the blood pool.</p><p>it’s useless even if we don’t yield. This time, not only is there a little girl with the cloud Dragon bloodline, but there’s also a kid who is more compatible with the flood Dragon. With the two of them, we’re 100% sure that we can refine the yin moon demonic chief. The heavens are blessing our mo family. Yan Quan, this is your fate. Quickly yield!</p><p>An elder of the mo family shouted.</p><p>“I’ll f * ck your head!”</p><p>The old man roared.</p><p>Mo Ying’s body trembled and her eyes were listless. It was as if her soul had been drawn out of her body.</p><p>It was fake. It turned out that everything in the past was fake.</p><p>What genius of the mo family? What do you mean by focused training? What ancestor’s legacy?</p><p>They were all fake.</p><p>The purpose of all this was to refine the yinyue devil chief.</p><p>The reason was probably the cloud Dragon bloodline in her body.</p><p>It was no wonder that the mo family head invited Lu Ming in and said that he would help her. It was all nonsense.</p><p>It was nothing more than Lu Ming’s Blood Meridian. Everything made sense.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming kept waving his long spear, blocking the blood water dragons.</p><p>“Moying, pull yourself together. We don’t need such a family. At most, we’ll rebel.”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>Mo Ying’s body trembled, and she finally recovered a little. She gritted her teeth and said loudly, ” I decide my own fate. I will not listen to arrangements.</p><p>rebellious and stubborn, become a part of the family’s glory! Kill!</p><p>The two elders of the mo family roared and controlled the inscription formation. More blood water dragons flew out and attacked the two.</p><p>“A bunch of hypocrites, kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The aura on his body erupted like a volcano, and a huge stone tablet with four silver chakras appeared, shining brightly.</p><p>Lu Ming erupted with all his strength.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The power of wind and Fire gathered, and with a sweep of the long spear, a large number of blood water dragons exploded.</p><p>a fourth level King bloodline. Who is this kid? ”</p><p>An elder of the mo family shouted in shock.</p><p>As far as he knew, there were no geniuses with fourth level King level bloodline in the entire Dark Moon Empire. Where did Lu Ming come from?</p><p>Could he be a peerless genius from some mid-tier Empire?</p><p>who cares who he is? there’s no way out today. Let’s kill this brat first!</p><p>Another elder of the mo family shouted.</p><p>“Good, attack!”</p><p>The two elders of the mo family formed hand seals.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The huge blood water dragon that was initially wrapped around the elder let go of the elder and pounced at Lu Ming with a furious roar.</p><p>The aura was so powerful that it shook the heavens and earth.</p><p>He gave off the feeling that he was much stronger than an ordinary ninth level martial arts Grandmaster.</p><p>It couldn’t be blocked!</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils constricted. He was about to retreat when he suddenly stopped.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A blood-red light flashed behind his back, and the nine Dragon bloodline appeared.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
