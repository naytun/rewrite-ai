This kind of aura was simply earth-shaking. It was like a tsunami that was a few hundred meters tall, sweeping through the world as if it could destroy everything.</p><p>Wan Xiu’s pupils dilated rapidly, revealing an extremely frightened expression.</p><p>“These … These are the blood red Cavalry?”</p><p>His voice trembled, his face pale and cold sweat flowing.</p><p>Some of the other city Lords were also trembling, and their faces were pale.</p><p>They had been confident that Yu Tong Pass was unbreakable, but their confidence crumbled when they saw the situation in front of them.</p><p>The bloodscaled Wolf’s aura was too terrifying. Before, Wan Xiu had said that the outside world was exaggerating about the blood red Cavalry. Now, they only wanted to roar. What exaggeration? They had clearly underestimated him.</p><p>“Block it, we must block it!”</p><p>run! Wan Xiu shouted with all his might. Then, he turned around and ran.</p><p>“Wait for me!”</p><p>The other city Lords also turned around and left.</p><p>With all the generals gone, there was no suspense in this battle.</p><p>The dangerous terrain of Yu Tong Pass was not enough to stop the bloodred scaled Wolf.</p><p>One had to know that the bloodred scaled wolves lived on the Highlands and ran through the dangerous terrain as if they were on flat ground.</p><p>Half an hour later, Yu Tong Pass was razed to the ground. The blood red Cavalry whizzed past, heading straight for the imperial capital.</p><p>The blood red Cavalry had great endurance, and after galloping for half a day, they would stop to rest.</p><p>Three days later, the blood red iron cavalry had already galloped tens of thousands of miles and were getting closer and closer to the imperial capital.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>There was a violent explosion in front of them.</p><p>“There’s cavalry coming!”</p><p>Huaying said.</p><p>“Could it be that the ten direction sword sect sent people to surround us?”</p><p>Someone guessed.</p><p>However, the answer was soon revealed.</p><p>The neighing of horses could be heard in front of them. The aura of the bloodscale Wolf cavalry had shaken them, and they were thrown off their horses.</p><p>Lu Ming and the group were speechless. The combat ability of this Army was really not that good? Moreover, there weren’t many of them, probably only about 10000. Were they really sent by the Shi Fang sword sect to surround them?</p><p>You must be joking!</p><p>Lu Ming led the blood red Cavalry and stopped. They did not attack.</p><p>After a long time, the troops in front were organized, and a few burly men in iron armor galloped out on green scale horses.</p><p>“Who are you people? You dare to block our path?”</p><p>A short and fat man glared and shouted angrily.</p><p>It turned out that they had not recognized the blood red Cavalry.</p><p>That’s right, unless there were soldiers at the border, it was normal for the soldiers near the capital to not recognize the blood red Cavalry.</p><p>“I still want to ask. Who are you people? You dare to stand in my way?”</p><p>Lu Ming rolled his eyes and shouted.</p><p>we are the Army under the Heavenly King, we are ordered to capture the rebels of the royal family. Get out of the way now, if you delay the Heavenly King’s plan, even if you have ten heads, it won’t be enough.</p><p>The short and fat man shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Capture the rebels of the royal family? Could it be Hua Chi?</p><p>“Do you know where the eighth prince is?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>The short and fat man’s eyes revealed a vigilant look, and he said, ” “Speak, Who are you? Otherwise, don’t blame me for being impolite!”</p><p>“Kill! Leave the general in front alive!”</p><p>The short and stout man had just finished speaking when Lu Ming roared loudly.</p><p>OWW! Awooo!</p><p>Wolf howls rang out as the bloodscale Wolf cavalry began to charge.</p><p>Without the slightest suspense, the blood red Cavalry only needed to charge to cause this Army of ten thousand to fall apart. Those who died in battle died, those who fled, and those who submitted.</p><p>The few generals in the lead were all captured alive.</p><p>“What? you guys are blood red Cavalry?”</p><p>At this moment, the short and fat man seemed to have remembered something and shouted in horror.</p><p>your reaction isn’t too slow. Alright, tell me, where are the eighth prince and the others? ”</p><p>Lu Ming stared at the stout man and asked coldly.</p><p>“What the hell are you? you’re tianyun?”</p><p>The short and fat man’s body trembled non-stop, and his eyes were filled with fear.</p><p>“Speak!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly.</p><p>“I’ll tell you, I’ll tell you. Please spare my life.”</p><p>The short and fat man screamed.</p><p>“Speak!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s killing intent burst out and it was extremely cold.</p><p>“I’ll tell you, I’ll tell you. We received news that the eighth prince has taken his men to hide in the EastRiver mountain range. We were ordered to send our Army into the mountain range to surround and annihilate them. We’re just one of the many armies. Many other armies have set off before us.”</p><p>The short and fat man shouted.</p><p>“The eastern river Mountain range?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with anxiety as he shouted,”Lead the way. Let’s set off for the eastern river Mountain range!”</p><p>The short and stout man naturally did not dare to disobey. He immediately led the way, and the blood red Cavalry galloped towards the east River Mountain range.</p><p>The East River Mountain range wasn’t far from here. With the bloodred scaled Wolf’s speed, it would only take an hour to cover the distance of a thousand li.</p><p>The eastern river Mountain range wasn’t very famous. Although this mountain range was vast, its peaks weren’t high, and it wasn’t very dangerous. There weren’t any powerful demonic beasts either, and even ordinary people could enter.</p><p>A small hill was surrounded by an Army of at least tens of thousands of people, so tight that not even a drop of water could pass through.</p><p>In the air, there were also more than 20 powerhouses standing in the air.</p><p>“Hua Chi, I advise you to surrender. Don’t make any pointless struggles. You’ve lost, and your fate has been decided!”</p><p>In the air, a big man with fluttering sleeves and a sword on his back shouted.</p><p>That’s right, Hua Chi and the others were on the hill. There were about two thousand of them, and all of them were in tattered clothes. There were still some blood stains that had not dried up. It was obvious that they had experienced a fierce battle during this period of time.</p><p>Hua Chi stood at the forefront of the hill. Beside him, there were more than a dozen middle-aged men and elders. Each of them had a powerful aura that was as large as a mountain.</p><p>This was the imperial family’s only remaining expert.</p><p>Behind them were two figures. They were Lu Yuntian and Li Ping.</p><p>At this moment, the two of them were extremely Haggard, their faces pale, and their bodies weak.</p><p>Lu Yuntian had already lost his cultivation base while Li Ping was just an ordinary person. One could only imagine how much suffering the two of them had gone through to escape with Hua Chi and the others.</p><p>“Eighth prince, you should run away first. With these seniors leading you, there’s still a chance for you to escape. When you find Ming ‘er, ask him to take revenge for us!”</p><p>Lu Yuntian said to Hua Chi.</p><p>Uncle Lu, I, Hua Chi, am not the kind of person who would drag out an ignoble existence. Furthermore, since brother Lu has entrusted you to me and he is fighting alone at the border, I must ensure your safety. Otherwise, how can I face him? ”</p><p>Hua Chi smiled and stood up straight.</p><p>Lu Yuntian sighed.</p><p>“Brother Tian!”</p><p>Li Ping grabbed Lu Yuntian’s hand tightly.</p><p>ping ‘er, I’m already satisfied to be able to see you again. It’s a pity that I’ve implicated you.</p><p>Lu Yuntian looked at Li Ping and asked.</p><p>brother Tian, I’m not afraid. As long as I’m with you, it doesn’t matter whether I live or die.</p><p>Li Ping said.</p><p>Lu Yuntian looked at Li Ping with pity and said,”I believe that Ming ‘er will avenge us. One day, Ming’ er will flatten the ten direction Sword School!”</p><p>“I also believe that!”</p><p>Li Ping nodded.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
