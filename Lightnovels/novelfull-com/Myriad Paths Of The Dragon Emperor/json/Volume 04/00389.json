It was extremely rich and continuously transformed into the Qi of ten thousand spirits, nourishing Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was glowing, shimmering and dazzling.</p><p>Moreover, his qi and blood circulated, full of endless vitality.</p><p>A day later, a 10000-year-old blood ginseng had been completely refined.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s body trembled. His bones and bones were making crisp sounds. His muscles were as tight as steel wires, buzzing.</p><p>His physical body was beginning to break through the bottleneck.</p><p>After another half a day, the strange phenomenon disappeared and Lu Ming opened his eyes.</p><p>“Sixth-grade physical body!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were bright and he looked happy.</p><p>After refining an upper Lv 5 spiritual medicine, Lu Ming’s physical body finally made a breakthrough.</p><p>Even some martial King realm martial artists had to specially cultivate their bodies to reach the sixth-grade body.</p><p>what a powerful force. With my current physical body, how strong will I be when I combine it with my true Qi? ”</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming appeared outside the Supreme shrine.</p><p>At this time, it was already the evening of the next day outside.</p><p>last night, I was safe and sound. I was really stupid. I only couldn’t enter the Supreme shrine when it was in danger. As long as I could enter the Supreme shrine before nightfall, I wouldn’t have to avoid the attacks of those spirits!</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly stunned and secretly scolded himself for being silly.</p><p>If he didn’t use the Supreme shrine, why would he bother with those spirits every night?</p><p>“Let’s test my strength first!”</p><p>The demon subduing spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hands. Then, he shook the long spear and suddenly struck the ground.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The earth let out a violent roar and trembled violently. The ground exploded and gravel flew. A spear-shaped Gully appeared on the ground and spread forward.</p><p>It only stopped after spreading for more than 200 meters.</p><p>On the ground, a ten-meter deep and two-hundred meter long ditch appeared.</p><p>“The power of a casual attack has indeed increased a lot!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a look of joy.</p><p>The attack just now was purely the combination of genuine Qi and physical strength. He didn’t use any martial arts techniques or combine the power of wind and Fire.</p><p>“Let’s try something else!”</p><p>Next, Lu Ming added in the Wind and Fire Force and started experimenting.</p><p>After that, he continued to test out the nine Dragons heaven stomping step and the heavenly path palm.</p><p>it seems that my strongest combat strength hasn’t improved much. I can’t reach the level of five fighters!</p><p>After a round of experiments, Lu Ming came to a conclusion.</p><p>When he used the nine Dragons heaven treading steps, the physical body was still greatly affected. The breakthrough of the physical body greatly enhanced the power of the nine Dragons heaven treading steps, but it did not surpass the power of the heavenly path palm. It was only close to the power of the heavenly path palm.</p><p>However, the power of the heaven’s path palm did not increase by much.</p><p>The power of the heavenly path palm was mainly due to the mysterious heavenly path aura. It had little to do with the physical body.</p><p>Therefore, the breakthrough of the physical body did not have much effect on the improvement of the heaven’s path palm.</p><p>However, it did not mean that Lu Ming’s combat strength had not improved.</p><p>His basic combat power had increased by a large margin, and the power of any ordinary martial technique or attack would increase greatly.</p><p>It could be said that Lu Ming did not need to use the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps or the heavenly way palm. He mainly added the power of wind and Fire to his attack, and it would reach or even surpass the power of a level 4 genius.</p><p>Moreover, this was a battle that could last for a long time, unlike the heavenly path palm, which consumed a lot of energy.</p><p>Although he had not reached the level of a level five talent, Lu Ming was very satisfied.</p><p>continue to improve my physical body!</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming returned to the Supreme shrine. He took out another level 5 spiritual medicine and began to transform it into the Qi of myriad spirits to improve his physical body.</p><p>However, the amount of energy required for a sixth-grade body was simply too much. It was at least ten times more than what a fifth-grade body needed.</p><p>A day later, after Lu Ming refined the spiritual medicine, his physical body only improved a little.</p><p>He did not know how far he was from achieving rank-6.</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming started to refine the spiritual medicine continuously.</p><p>Another five days had passed. The remaining five-jeweled spiritual herbs had all been refined. Lu Ming’s physical body had only reached the peak of the initial success of the sixth stage and had not broken through to the upper tier.</p><p>the amount of energy required is too terrifying. I don’t know how much more energy is needed to cultivate a seventh-grade body. Whatever, I’ll continue to refine those low-grade spiritual herbs.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming waved his hand and a large pile of spiritual herbs appeared in front of him.</p><p>Like a small mountain, there were level two, level three, and level four.</p><p>They were all obtained from other people’s storage rings after killing them.</p><p>“Refine!”</p><p>In Lu Ming’s hands, there was an inexplicable aura that enveloped the hundreds of spiritual herbs.</p><p>These spirit herbs were too weak to be compared to Level 5 spirit herbs.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming planned to refine a few hundred of them at once.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming activated the ten thousand spirit war body. Some of the spirit herbs shook and turned into ashes. Lu Ming absorbed the medicinal effects and transformed them into the Qi of ten thousand spirits, nourishing his body.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming continued to refine the pills.</p><p>Time flew by and another ten days passed.</p><p>In ten days, Lu Ming had refined no less than ten thousand spiritual herbs of various levels. He had swept away all the spiritual herbs that he had accumulated during this period.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s physical body had reached the peak of upper-tier rank-6. He was just a step away from complete rank-6.</p><p>This made Lu Ming sigh. Cultivating the physical body was really a money-burning task.</p><p>The value of so many spiritual herbs was simply unimaginable, but they didn’t have much effect on the improvement of the body.</p><p>alright, I’ll stop here for now. Now, I’ll raise my cultivation.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He took out a Vermillion fruit and swallowed it in one gulp. The nine Dragon bloodline refined it to increase his cultivation.</p><p>The Vermillion Scarlet fruit was indeed a Supreme treasure that could increase one’s cultivation. The energy it contained was incomparably vast, and it continuously condensed true Qi.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation level increased rapidly.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming reached the later stage of the fifth level of the martial arts Grandmaster realm and continued to improve.</p><p>Three days later, all nine Vermillion fruit were refined. Lu Ming’s cultivation broke through to the early stage of the sixth level martial arts Grandmaster realm.</p><p>nine vermillion red fruits. To others, I’m afraid you can advance two levels, but to me, it’s not even one level!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly.</p><p>He needed too much energy for every step he advanced.</p><p>However, there was a benefit to it. The Scarlet Vermilion fruit’s cultivation was extremely pure and had a solid foundation. Lu Ming could continue to devour the blood essence of demonic beasts to improve his cultivation.</p><p>He didn’t need to spend time to Polish and stabilize his Foundation.</p><p>it’s been more than 20 days since I entered seclusion. It’s time to go out and take a walk!</p><p>As he thought of this, he left the Supreme shrine.</p><p>It was still daytime outside. Lu Ming turned into a ray of light and headed west.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming went on adventures during the day in search of opportunities. Before nightfall, he would enter the Supreme shrine to comprehend force and cultivate martial arts techniques.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another seven days had passed.</p><p>These seven days, there weren’t many big waves.</p><p>“Eh? There’s a city up ahead!”</p><p>Lu Ming saw a city ahead.</p><p>Lu Ming turned into a ray of light and flew toward the city.</p><p>“This city is huge!”</p><p>When Lu Ming neared, he realized that this city was very majestic. It was much larger than the previous one.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
