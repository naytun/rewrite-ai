Hua Chi, then I’ll send you to accompany your dead Imperial father!”</p><p>...</p><p>The middle-aged man from the ten direction sword sect was instantly enraged when he saw Hua Chi ignore him. A sharp killing intent exploded from his body.</p><p>“Ten direction sword sect, traitor! As long as I don’t die today, I’ll definitely flatten the ten direction mountain!”</p><p>you’re courting death! seeing the other party insult his father, Hua Chi’s eyes gleamed with cold killing intent.</p><p>“Hahaha, you think you can flatten the ten square Mountain? This is the funniest joke I’ve ever heard in all my decades of life!”</p><p>The middle-aged man laughed.</p><p>“And do you think you can escape today? The area within several li has already been completely surrounded by an Army of 100000 soldiers, and the experts of my ten direction Sword School have sealed off the sky and the ground. You can’t escape, and no one can come in, haha!”</p><p>The middle-aged man laughed mockingly.</p><p>“Oh, really? Then how did I get in?”</p><p>Suddenly, a cold voice came from above their heads.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>The swordsman suddenly raised his head and looked up.</p><p>High up in the sky, three figures stood in the air.</p><p>One was a young man, one was an old man, and the other was a burly man who was covered in a black robe and a bamboo hat.</p><p>On the hill, Hua Chi, Lu Yuntian, and Li Ping shuddered when they heard the voice. They hurriedly raised their heads and cried out in alarm.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>“Ming ‘er!”</p><p>The three people in the sky were Lu Ming, Yan Quan, and the Golden-eyed blood corpse.</p><p>As they neared the eastern river Mountain range, Lu Ming led Yan Quan and the Golden-eyed blood corpse to search for Hua Chi and the others in the sky, pointing out the direction for the blood red Cavalry.</p><p>He quickly found Hua Chi and the others.</p><p>With their cultivation, the experts from the ten direction Sword School did not notice them at all when they approached from the sky.</p><p>“Who are you? This place has already been occupied by my ten direction sword sect. You came here without permission, are you looking for death?”</p><p>The swordsman roared.</p><p>He had never heard of Lu Ming.</p><p>Just now, he had just said that no one could enter and Lu Ming and the rest had appeared. It was as if he had slapped his own face. This made him angry from embarrassment.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not even spare him a glance. With a flash, he appeared on the hill and went to Lu Yuntian and Li Ping.</p><p>“Father, mother, are you alright? I’m late.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice trembled.</p><p>When Lu Ming saw Lu Yuntian and Li Ping, he heaved a sigh of relief as the huge rock in his heart was finally lifted.</p><p>Before he met Lu Yuntian and Li Ping, he was truly worried that something would happen to the two elders.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, we’re fine. Why are you here? don’t worry about us. Hurry up and leave!”</p><p>Li Ping said anxiously.</p><p>“Mother, don’t worry. Since I’m here, they won’t be able to touch a single hair on your head. Wait a moment, we’ll leave together.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>At this time, the sword-bearing man from the ten directions sword sect was so angry that his mouth almost twisted.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>An aura as deep as the ocean erupted from his body, terrifying beyond compare.</p><p>Ninth level of martial arts Grandmaster. This burly man with a sword on his back was actually a peerless expert of the ninth level of martial arts Grandmaster.</p><p>“Kid, I’m asking you a question. Are you deaf?”</p><p>The swordsman coldly said.</p><p>“Who Do You Think You Are? You asked me and I have to answer?”</p><p>Lu Ming cast a faint glance at him.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s indifferent expression almost made him explode in anger.</p><p>With a loud roar, he unsheathed the huge sword on his back and a terrifying sword light slashed towards Lu Ming.</p><p>The entire Hill would be reduced to ashes if this sword were to land.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>The dozen or so martial arts grandmasters behind Hua Chi immediately roared and unleashed their powers, preparing to block the sword light.</p><p>There was even a 9th level martial ancestor realm expert among them who was only injured and his aura was a little weak.</p><p>This person must be a peerless expert of the imperial family.</p><p>However, there was a figure that was faster than them.</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood corpse flashed and appeared in front of everyone. With a wave of its hand, a claw radiance shot out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a loud sound, the Golden-eyed blood zombie didn’t move at all, but the swordsman’s body was sent flying 100 meters away.</p><p>“How can he be so strong? Who are you?”</p><p>The swordsman shouted in disbelief.</p><p>Even though he had not used his full strength in that attack, there were not many people in the entire blazing sun Empire who could force him back with a single strike.</p><p>However, the Golden-eyed blood corpse did not move. It was too lazy to bother with him.</p><p>“Tianyun! He’s tianyun!”</p><p>A shocked roar came from the Army at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>Obviously, someone had recognized Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming had stayed in the imperial capital for such a long time. It was normal for someone to recognize him.</p><p>“Tianyun? you’re tianyun?”</p><p>The swordsman’s face suddenly changed.</p><p>He then revealed a malevolent expression and shouted, ” “Tianyun, so what if it’s you? I admit that the person you brought is very strong, but do you think he can save more than two thousand people by himself?”</p><p>“I have a hundred thousand soldiers here. As long as I give the order, the hundred thousand soldiers will charge together. How many people can you save? As soon as you leave, I’ll exterminate them all.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>“Oh,” Lu Ming replied faintly.</p><p>As for Hua Chi and the others, their expressions were extremely unsightly.</p><p>On the hill, the other 2000 or so people had heavy expressions.</p><p>eighth prince, you should leave with Marquis champion first. Don’t worry about us. We’re members of the royal family when we’re alive, and we’ll be ghosts of the royal family when we die!</p><p>that’s right, eighth prince. Marquis champion is a peerless genius. As long as you escape, with the help of Marquis champion, you’ll definitely be able to take revenge for us in time.</p><p>“Eighth prince, you can go first!”</p><p>On the hill, more than two thousand people shouted, letting Hua Chi go first.</p><p>“If we’re leaving, we’ll leave together. I definitely won’t abandon everyone and escape alone.”</p><p>Hua Chi sternly said, his expression firm.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Seeing this, the swordsman laughed arrogantly.</p><p>“Since I’m here, I’ll definitely bring everyone out of here alive!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming spoke. His voice was firm and everyone heard it.</p><p>hahaha, tianyun, with that expert you brought with you, it’s true that I can’t stop you from taking a few people away. However, you’re dreaming if you think you can take more than 2000 people away. Hahaha!</p><p>The swordsman laughed in disdain.</p><p>“Who said I only brought two people?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The swordsman was stunned.</p><p>OWW! Awooo!</p><p>Right at this moment, wolf howls rang out, reverberating through the clouds.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Immediately, a violent rumble came from the ground.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>The swordsman’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>Hua Chi was startled, but then he seemed to think of something and revealed a look of ecstasy.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>In the forest, the earth rumbled and the sounds of battle could be heard.</p><p>“Not good! These are the blood red Cavalry! Tianyun’s blood red Cavalry! Block them! Block them!”</p><p>At this moment, the swordsman seemed to have thought of something, and his expression changed drastically as he roared.</p><p>“Blocked? Can it be blocked? Blood red Cavalry, hear my order, kill without mercy!”</p><p>Lu Ming gave a long whistle and issued an order.</p><p>“Kill without mercy!”</p><p>The blood red Cavalry roared, their killing intent surging.</p><p>In the next moment, heaven-suppressing battle cries came from the forest.</p><p>The one hundred thousand soldiers in the forest were completely stunned by the sudden charge of the blood red Cavalry, and were unable to form an effective counterattack.</p><p>In an instant, a large number of people died.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
