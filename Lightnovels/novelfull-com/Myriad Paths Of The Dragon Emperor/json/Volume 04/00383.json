But then, she thought of something and shouted.</p><p>The nether demon Palace was too powerful. Other than the young man who had escaped earlier, the other seven people were at least in the later stage of the martial arts Grandmaster sixth realm.</p><p>Among them, two of them were in the late stage of the sixth level, three of them were in the peak of the sixth level, and two of them were in the early stage of the seventh level.</p><p>The power gathered together was too strong. No matter how strong Lu Ming was, he was no match for it.</p><p>Although Song Yu was looking forward to a miracle and Lu Ming could save them, his rationality told him that it was impossible.</p><p>“Leave? Today, none of you shall leave.”</p><p>The one who spoke was a green-haired youth.</p><p>He looked to be around twenty-four or twenty-five years old. He had a slender figure and an oppressive aura. He had long green hair that reached his waist and was filled with an evil aura.</p><p>His gaze was cold and emotionless as he looked at Lu Ming.”You are the one who killed the people of my nether demon Palace? Good, very good. You will pay a heavy price for this.”</p><p>“I’m afraid you don’t have the ability!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Then I’ll let you experience it!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the green-haired youth’s body exploded with a violent aura.</p><p>“Three strikes of the spirit demon-spirit severing!”</p><p>die! the green-haired young man shouted as a dark green sword Qi shot out from his hand.</p><p>It crossed thousands of meters in an instant and slashed at Lu Ming’s glabella.</p><p>“Metal force complete!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The demon subduing spear appeared and stabbed forward. The power of wind and Fire erupted.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The spear radiance and the sword Qi collided, and a dazzling light burst out at the point of intersection.</p><p>Then, the spear radiance and the sword Qi disappeared together.</p><p>They were equally matched.</p><p>“This person is not weaker than young master Tian she!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He could roughly determine the other party’s combat strength.</p><p>Without a doubt, the other party was a genius who was in the middle of a Second Battle and a third Battle. With his cultivation in the early stage of martial ancestor seventh realm, he should be able to explode with the fighting power of a martial ancestor ninth realm late stage.</p><p>kid, you have some skills. Take this, YouMo triple kill-God-Slayer!</p><p>The green-haired youth roared.</p><p>Dark green light burst out from his body. It was extremely dazzling. Then, he became one with his sword, turning into a dazzling dark green sword radiance that charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>In an instant, it crossed a distance of several thousand meters. The sky was slashed by the sword light, and the air currents surged and split into two sides. It was extremely shocking.</p><p>The power of this sword was much stronger than the previous one. It had truly reached the combat strength of a martial ancestor realm level 9 late stage.</p><p>“Nine Dragons trampling the heavens!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and the world rumbled. A terrifying force surged forward.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The sky once again let out a terrifying roar, and the air waves swept out, sending sand and stones flying.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>A figure flew back and took three steps in the sky, causing the air to explode and emitting a violent boom.</p><p>It was the green-haired youth.</p><p>On the other side, Lu Ming’s body swayed slightly. He took a step back and then stood firmly.</p><p>Lu Ming had the upper hand.</p><p>The green-robed youth’s face instantly turned greener than his hair. His eyes were filled with disbelief as he growled, ” “How is that possible? You’re only in the early stage of the 5th level of the martial ancestor realm and you can actually block my killing move. How is this possible?”</p><p>He simply couldn’t bear it.</p><p>If Lu Ming could fight him at the early stage of the fifth level martial arts Grandmaster realm, it meant that Lu Ming had already surpassed a level four talent and was between level four and level five.</p><p>This was too shocking.</p><p>Not to mention being between a level 4 and a level 5, there was not even a level 4 talent in the nether demon Palace where geniuses were as common as clouds.</p><p>Who was this kid? Which region did he come from?</p><p>Junior Brother, let’s attack together and kill this person. Since we’re already mortal enemies, the more talented this person is, the more we have to kill him!</p><p>A figure flashed and a tall young man appeared beside the green-haired young man. This young man was the other seventh level martial ancestor realm genius.</p><p>alright, let’s attack together. We’ll set up the YouMo seven slaughter formation and kill this man!</p><p>The green-haired youth instructed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In a flash, in the city below, the other disciples of the nether demon Palace appeared behind the green-haired young man and the white-haired young man. There was a total of seven of them, and they stood in a strange posture, forming a joint attack formation.</p><p>As for the disciple of the nether demon Palace who had escaped, he stood at the side with a cold smile and stared at Lu Ming with a murderous look.</p><p>“A joint attack formation?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile.</p><p>As for Song Yu, Song Jing, and the others, they were looking at the sky nervously.</p><p>Now, they could only wait and hope for a miracle.</p><p>Kill! Kill!</p><p>Suddenly, seven voices filled with killing intent rang out. Immediately after, the seven disciples of the nether demon Palace moved.</p><p>The seven of them moved in a strange trajectory and flashed rapidly, turning into countless light shadows that surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>All of a sudden, seven beams of sword Qi shot toward Lu Ming from seven different directions.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed rapidly and dodged the six sword Qi. However, there was one that he could not avoid no matter what.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The long spear was drawn out. Of course, it contained the power of wind and Fire.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled and he could not help but retreat.</p><p>The power of this sword was even stronger than the green-haired youth’s second sword.</p><p>Lu Ming did not use the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps and was instantly at a disadvantage.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>While Lu Ming was retreating, a few more sword Qis behind him slashed at his back.</p><p>Every step was filled with killing intent, and it was unavoidable.</p><p>“Nine Dragons trampling the heavens!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long roar and a Dragon’s Roar was heard.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure instantly turned into a flash of light and disappeared in a flash. Not only did he avoid the sword light behind him, but he also directly left the joint attack formation of the nether demon Palace and appeared in the sky not far away.</p><p>“How is this possible? What kind of movement technique is this?”</p><p>Everyone from the nether demon Palace widened their eyes in shock and disbelief.</p><p>Their combined attack formation was the famous guarding technique of the nether demon Palace. When the seven of them worked together, their combat power would increase by several times. Moreover, those who were trapped would not be able to escape at all and would only be killed.</p><p>With the strength of the seven of them, even a peak ninth level martial ancestor realm warrior would be killed by this array. Only a half step King could escape.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s cultivation was only at the early stage of the fifth level martial arts Grandmaster realm. How was this possible?</p><p>“This combined attack formation is indeed amazing. Alright, I’ve seen it, so I won’t play with you anymore.”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>This caused everyone to be dumbfounded.</p><p>It turned out that Lu Ming had deliberately been surrounded by the joint attack formation. He wanted to see the power of the formation.</p><p>“Big brother, aren’t you taking this too lightly?”</p><p>Song Yu and the others all wanted to roar.</p><p>As for the few from the nether demon Palace, their faces were extremely dark.</p><p>“You’re not going to play with us? What big words. Let me tell you, even if you leave today, your friend will end up in an extremely miserable state because of you!”</p><p>The green-haired young man glanced at Song Yu and the others below and said with a ferocious expression.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s movement technique, they could not stop him if he wanted to leave.</p><p>However, Song Yu and the rest could not leave.</p><p>brother Lu, don’t worry about us. Leave quickly!</p><p>Song Yu shouted again.</p><p>“Leave? Who said I’m leaving?” Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
