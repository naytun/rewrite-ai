What about the grey wolf cavalry? Where did he go?</p><p>This new army was naturally Lu Ming’s group.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming took the lead, holding a spear in one hand and exuding a murderous aura.</p><p>The 18,000 soldiers followed closely behind, stabbing towards the Dark Moon Empire’s Army like a sharp knife.</p><p>“Kill! Sons of the mountain-suppressing Army, come with me and kill those bastards of the Dark Moon Empire!”</p><p>How could Ming Meng miss such an opportunity? he immediately roared, and his voice spread throughout the entire area.</p><p>“Kill! Kill! Kill!”</p><p>All the soldiers of the mountain-suppressing Army roared and followed Ming Meng, charging toward the yinyue Army.</p><p>The Dark Moon Empire’s face turned extremely ugly as they roared, the enemy doesn’t have many people, less than 20000. We are all elites who have been through hundreds of battles. 10000 of us should be enough to stop them.</p><p>At once, the Dark Moon Empire sent out 10000 cavalrymen to charge at Lu Ming’s Army.</p><p>“Remember, stop them! Once the ash Wolf cavalry arrive, we’ll kill them all!”</p><p>The Dark Moon general roared. His voice spread across the battlefield to encourage the soldiers.</p><p>“Hahaha, the Azure Wolf cavalry you were talking about is them, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily. With a wave of his hand, a storage ring flew out. Following that, the storage ring glowed, and the heads of wolves and humans fell to the ground.</p><p>“Those are the heads of the ash Wolf cavalry!”</p><p>“So many … Could it be that all of the grey wolf cavalry were killed?”</p><p>Immediately, the Army of the Dark Moon Empire became restless.</p><p>“We’ve already killed the ten thousand soldiers of the ash Wolf cavalry. Don’t expect too much from them.”</p><p>Lu Ming roared and charged at his opponent at top speed.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>The great general of the Dark Moon Empire roared. He found it hard to believe that ten thousand Grey Wolf cavalry had been killed just like that.</p><p>Lu Ming’s words made the Army of the Dark Moon Empire suspicious. Some soldiers did not even hold their weapons as tightly as before.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s Army of eighteen thousand had already collided with the enemy’s Army of ten thousand.</p><p>“Delude the masses with lies, kill!”</p><p>The leader of the other party was a burly man in the fifth level of the martial arts Grandmaster realm. As he shouted, he slashed his saber at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared and thrust his long spear forward. The saber beam shattered and the long spear pierced through the other party’s throat.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Spear’s radiance didn’t stop. It killed more than a dozen people behind it before it disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming rode on the green scale horse and charged past.</p><p>Behind them, Xie nianqing, the Golden-eyed blood corpse, Hua Ying, Gao Li, and the rest followed closely, leading the 18000 troops.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>With Lu Ming as the leader, the blazing sun Army’s momentum was like a rainbow. They immediately tore a huge hole in the enemy’s formation.</p><p>The Dark Moon Empire’s ten thousand strong Army was not as powerful as the ash Wolf Army. Their strength was on par with the Army that Lu Ming had led. Naturally, they could not stop Lu Ming.</p><p>Moreover, the morale of the Dark Moon Empire was low, and they were outnumbered. They were no match for the sun Army at all, and in a few moments, they had already been scattered.</p><p>On the other side, Ming Meng led the mountain suppressing Army and held the enemy back, gaining the upper hand.</p><p>“All troops, move out!”</p><p>Ming Meng let out a long hiss that spread into the Moonview city.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Suddenly, a large Army rushed out of the Moonview city and charged towards them.</p><p>It was the 20000 troops that Ming Meng had left behind to defend the city.</p><p>As a result, the Dark Moon Empire was besieged from all sides, and their morale was even lower. Large numbers of soldiers were killed by the burning sun Empire.</p><p>“Retreat, retreat!”</p><p>The great general of the Dark Moon Empire roared, extremely anxious.</p><p>He knew that today’s defeat was certain. If this continued, he was afraid that his entire Army would be annihilated.</p><p>The Dark Moon Empire’s general led the powerful Bloodmoon Devil Tiger Army and charged forward. Instantly, the mountain suppressing Army led by Ming Meng was broken through.</p><p>“Charge out!”</p><p>The Bloodmoon demonic Tiger Army took the lead, followed by the rest of the Army. They retreated frantically.</p><p>The Army that was fighting with Lu Ming’s group threw away their armor and ran wildly.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared and led the Army to pursue.</p><p>On the other side, Ming Meng also led the mountain-suppressing Army in pursuit.</p><p>The army was defeated like a landslide. Along the way, the Dark Moon Empire left behind a large number of corpses.</p><p>Half an hour later, Lu Ming and the rest finally called it a day.</p><p>In this battle, only about 20000 out of the 50000 soldiers of the Dark Moon Empire had escaped. 30000 had died, and the mountain suppressing Army had seized countless materials.</p><p>It could be said to be a big victory.</p><p>An hour later, the two armies met on the plains outside Moonview city.</p><p>“Father!”</p><p>“Father!”</p><p>The three Ming siblings rushed towards Ming Meng.</p><p>“Why didn’t the three of you stay in the imperial capital and cultivate? why did you come back?”</p><p>Ming Meng chided with a straight face.</p><p>Ming Zhu stuck out her tongue and did not make a sound.</p><p>“Father, when we heard that the yinyue Army was besieging the Moonview city, we were burning with anxiety. As father’s son, how could we not fight against the strong enemy with you?” We naturally have to come back to be with father.”</p><p>“Well, at least you have some filial piety!”</p><p>Ming Meng’s expression improved a little as he nodded.</p><p>also, this time around, the royal family has sent an Army to reinforce us. The leader is big brother tianyun. Naturally, we have to return together so that we can introduce him to father.</p><p>Ming Feng said.</p><p>“Tianyun? Could he be the tianyun who killed Qiu changlie from the ten directions sword sect? Hurry up and introduce us!”</p><p>When Ming Meng heard tianyun’s name, he was suddenly shocked and hurriedly said.</p><p>“Tian Yun pays his respects to great general Ming!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming walked up and cupped his fists.</p><p>“So you’re tianyun. Haha, you’re indeed a Dragon among men. I’m impressed, really impressed!”</p><p>Ming Meng laughed heartily and cupped his fists in greeting. He was very polite.</p><p>“Great general Ming, you’re too polite. This time, I’ve received orders to fight against the dark Moon Empire with you. If there’s anything I don’t understand, please enlighten me, great general.”</p><p>Lu Ming said politely.</p><p>“I don’t deserve your advice. As soon as you came, you annihilated the Dark Moon Empire’s grey Wolf Army and defeated the Dark Moon Empire’s Army in one fell swoop. Also, don’t call me general, just call me big brother Ming, haha!”</p><p>Ming Meng said very heroically.</p><p>“Big brother Ming?”</p><p>Lu Ming had a strange expression on his face as he swept a glance at Ming Cheng and the rest.</p><p>Ming Cheng, Ming Zhu, and Ming Feng’s faces were frozen, and they were dumbfounded.</p><p>Lu Ming addressed Ming Meng as ‘big brother’. Did that mean that they were one generation younger than Lu Ming? what should they call Lu Ming then?</p><p>Uncle?</p><p>When they thought of this, the three of them were a little mad.</p><p>haha, okay. I’ll call you big brother Ming then.</p><p>Lu Ming unkindly agreed and laughed heartily.</p><p>On the other hand, the three Ming siblings were the complete opposite. Each of them had a bitter face and were against it in their hearts.</p><p>However, Lu Ming and Ming Meng ignored them. They laughed heartily as they made their way to Moonview city. They were prepared to hold a banquet to celebrate their victory and to welcome Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
