The one hundred thousand soldiers of the Yue zhengarmy were even more shocked and envious.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming’s 18000-strong Army was extremely excited.</p><p>They knew that the Crimson scaled Wolf would definitely be assigned to them.</p><p>As expected, from the second day onwards, Lu Ming began to pick out eight thousand of the strongest soldiers from the eighteen thousand strong Army. Each of them was given a Crimson scaled Wolf.</p><p>Every single one of these eight thousand soldiers had a cultivation base of at least ninth grade warrior realm.</p><p>Two thousand of them were at the master martial realm, and about a hundred of them were at the Grandmaster martial realm.</p><p>Eight thousand of them formed a Scarlet blood scaled Wolf cavalry.</p><p>The people who were assigned to the Crimson scaled wolves were extremely excited.</p><p>A powerful Mount meant that their combat power was stronger. Not only did they have a higher chance of surviving on the battlefield, but they also had a higher chance of killing their enemies and making contributions.</p><p>Each and every one of them was extremely grateful to Lu Ming. They were deeply grateful.</p><p>Many of them even secretly swore to follow Lu Ming till death.</p><p>As for those who did not get a Crimson scaled Wolf, although they were a little envious, they were not jealous.</p><p>They knew that the reason they were not assigned to the Crimson scaled Wolf was because their cultivation was not high enough.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming was an unparalleled genius with a reputation that shook the blazing sun Empire. His future was limitless. They secretly vowed to follow Lu Ming and cultivate diligently. There would definitely be benefits.</p><p>Lu Ming did not expect that this move would make his Army more convinced of him and make him more prestigious.</p><p>Two days later.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>On the Prairie, a group of bloodscale Wolf cavalry whistled past like a Gale, their momentum shaking the heavens and earth.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were riding at the forefront. Despite the strong wind blowing and hitting their faces, the light in Lu Ming’s eyes grew brighter and brighter.</p><p>As a man, leading an Army of iron and blood, sweeping across the battlefield, making achievements, and having a beauty by his side, what could make one’s blood boil more?</p><p>OWW! Awooo!</p><p>The eight thousand cavalrymen howled as they passed by. On the grassland, the other demonic beasts saw this and ran in fear, not daring to stop at all.</p><p>In the distance, Ming Meng led the Army and watched in shock. Facing such power, most of the mountain suppressing Army revealed expressions of fear.</p><p>“Who can stop such an Army?”</p><p>Ming Meng sighed.</p><p>“It’s a pity that there are only 8000 of them, and the cultivation of each Knight is too low. Otherwise, they might be a surprise Army to fight against the dark Moon Empire.”</p><p>A Deputy general beside Ming Meng sighed.</p><p>that’s right. The Dark Moon Empire has 100000 soldiers like the Bloodmoon demonic Tiger Army and the ash Wolf Army. If they attack together, tianyun’s 8000 blood red Cavalry will not be a match for them!</p><p>Another Deputy general sighed.</p><p>don’t ask for too much. Eight thousand blood red iron cavalry is equivalent to a hundred thousand ordinary soldiers. To our Moonview city, this is a great thing.</p><p>Ming Meng said.</p><p>In the next few days, there was no movement from the Dark Moon Empire. Lu Ming led the bloodred scaled Wolf cavalry to practice on the grasslands, trying to build up the tacit understanding between the soldiers and their mounts.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, five days had passed. The 8000 soldiers and the bloodred scaled Wolf had already gotten used to each other.</p><p>On the sixth day, a piece of news suddenly came.</p><p>The northern Battlefront Army, which was three thousand miles away from the Moonview city, had sent an urgent message to the Mountaintown Army for help. They were under the frenzied attack of the Dark Moon Empire’s Army.</p><p>“General Ming, it’s urgent. I’ll lead the blood red Cavalry to ask for help.”</p><p>In the main tent of the military camp, Lu Ming, Ming Meng, and the others were discussing this matter. Lu Ming directly suggested that he lead the blood red Cavalry to rescue them first.</p><p>The northern Battlefront Army was another powerful Army of the royal family in the North. They were closely related to the mountain Battlefront Army. Once the northern Battlefront Army was destroyed, the mountain Battlefront Army would be in danger as well.</p><p>Therefore, they had to save the northern Battlefront Army when they were in danger.</p><p>The blood red Cavalry were the fastest, so they were the most suitable to go first.</p><p>“Alright. Brother tianyun will go first. The northern Army will be right behind you.”</p><p>Ming Meng said.</p><p>After a while, the blood red Cavalry rushed out of the camp like the wind and headed toward the northern Battlefront Army’s northern city.</p><p>The three thousand li journey only took four hours under the charge of the blood red Cavalry.</p><p>The blood red iron cavalry could travel tens of thousands of li in a day.</p><p>When Lu Ming and the rest were on a grassland a hundred miles away from zhenbei city, they saw countless people fighting.</p><p>There were at least 100000 people in a chaotic battle, and their shouts shook the sky.</p><p>the ash Wolf Army and the Bloodmoon demonic Tiger Army!</p><p>Lu Ming could see at a glance that there were two legions in the Army of the Dark Moon, each with about ten thousand men. They were extremely powerful and were launching a fierce attack on the northern Battlefront Army.</p><p>The northern Battlefront Army had about sixty to seventy thousand people. They were surrounded by the Army of the Dark Moon Empire and were constantly charging.</p><p>The smell of blood filled the entire grassland.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared and led the way with Xie nianqing, charging towards the 10000 soldiers of the ash Wolf Army.</p><p>Aowuu!</p><p>It was obvious that the gray wolf Army had also discovered Lu Ming and the others. They gathered their strength and charged toward them.</p><p>But halfway through, the grey wolf Army let out terrified screams.</p><p>“What’s that? Oh my God, it’s a bloodred scaled Wolf?”</p><p>“How is that possible? It’s really a bloodred scaled Wolf. It’s an Army of bloodred scaled wolves.”</p><p>Countless people in the grey wolf Army looked forward in shock.</p><p>OWW! …</p><p>The bloodred scaled Wolf howled, its eyes red as it charged forward.</p><p>Wuwuwu …</p><p>The wolves that the grey wolf cavalry rode on actually let out terrified cries and slowed down.</p><p>damn it! Charge! Charge! Don’t be afraid!</p><p>The general of the grey wolf Army roared as the saber in his hand cut the skin of the Grey Wolves, causing blood to flow.</p><p>The others did the same and cut open the Wolf’s skin. The wolf was injured, and its ferocity was triggered. It suppressed its fear and charged at the blood red Cavalry.</p><p>“Kill! Annihilate this Grey Wolf Army!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared, his voice filled with murderous intent.</p><p>When he led his Army out, the first thing he had encountered was the grey wolf Army.</p><p>In that battle, they had launched a sneak attack and had the advantage in numbers. Two thousand of them had died in the battle. Lu Ming was still brooding over that.</p><p>Now that he had seen another group of Grey Wolf cavalry, his killing intent was naturally sharp.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The rest of the blood red Cavalry were in a similar mood as Lu Ming. They roared and charged forward.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The two armies finally clashed.</p><p>However, the seemingly powerful Grey Wolf cavalry were as fragile as tofu in the face of the blood red Cavalry.</p><p>As soon as the two armies clashed, the ash Wolf cavalry were torn in half, their screams echoing through the air.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The bloodred scaled Wolf was incomparably ferocious. With a howl, it slashed out with its claws, tearing the ash Wolf cavalry in half.</p><p>In just a few moments, the formation of the grey wolf cavalry was torn in half by the blood red Cavalry, leaving thousands of corpses.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming changed his direction. The eight thousand blood red Cavalry followed him and charged towards the remaining ash Wolf cavalry.</p><p>This was a battle without any suspense. The difference in combat strength was too great, and it was a completely one-sided slaughter.</p><p>“Ah, run!”</p><p>“Help! Don’t kill me!”</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The ash Wolf cavalry howled in misery.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
