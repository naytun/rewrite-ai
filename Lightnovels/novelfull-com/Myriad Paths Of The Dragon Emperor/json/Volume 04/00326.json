She used to be a five-star.”</p><p>“Unbelievable. The compatibility with the ancestor’s inheritance can still be increased? I’ve never heard of such a thing, not even in the ancient books. It’s unbelievable!”</p><p>“I’m so envious!”</p><p>Some of the younger members of the mo family were already incoherent.</p><p>Squeak!</p><p>A white-haired old man walked out of a building next to the martial arts practice field. He was ecstatic when he saw mo Ying condensing six stars on the stone pillar. He muttered, six stars, that’s great. I’ve tried so many times and this is the most suitable one. This time, I’m sure I’ll succeed. We can look forward to great things. By then, the mo family’s status will definitely rise by a lot!</p><p>In the martial arts practice field.</p><p>Lu Ming saw the stone pillar glowing and a look of surprise flashed across his eyes.</p><p>Just now, when the stone pillar shone, he felt the nine Dragon bloodline in his body had a kind of restless feeling, which was very wonderful.</p><p>At this moment, mo Ying retracted her palm, her face revealing a happy expression.</p><p>my true Qi has become purer. It’s indeed more compatible with my ancestor’s inheritance.</p><p>Mo Ying said happily.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the stone pillar and suddenly walked forward.</p><p>“Eh? Brother Lu, what are you doing?”</p><p>Mo Ying was stunned.</p><p>Then, she saw Lu Ming stretch out his palm and press it against the stone pillar.</p><p>“Brother Lu, are you going to take the test? But this is our mo family’s testing stone pillar, what’s the use of him testing?”</p><p>Mo Ying thought.</p><p>The other members of the mo clan were even more dumbfounded.</p><p>“Who is this kid? What was he trying to do? This is the stone pillar that our mo family uses to test the compatibility of our ancestor’s inheritance. What is he doing there?”</p><p>“Could it be that this kid also wants to test the compatibility of the ancestor’s inheritance? What a joke, an outsider!”</p><p>“Brat, quickly stop!”</p><p>On the side, the people of the mo clan spoke out one after another, and some people even revealed mocking smiles.</p><p>But in the next moment-</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The testing stone pillar started to shake violently, emitting a bright light.</p><p>The dazzling light was even more intense than the one caused by the ink.</p><p>Then, the light condensed into stars in the sky.</p><p>One, two Gu</p><p>Eight stars. In the end, a total of eight stars were formed.</p><p>“This … This …”</p><p>The eyes of all the members of the mo clan almost popped out of their sockets. They were filled with disbelief.</p><p>All of them trembled and pointed at Lu Ming, unable to say a word for a long time.</p><p>Mo Ying’s reaction was similar. Her small cherry lips were so wide open that they could swallow a duck egg. Her beautiful eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>“Eight stars, eight stars, this kid’s compatibility with our ancestor’s inheritance has reached eight stars, how is this possible? How is this possible?”</p><p>“I’m dreaming, I must be dreaming!”</p><p>Pa!</p><p>A crisp slap was heard.</p><p>“Why did you hit me?”</p><p>“I was just checking to see if you were dreaming, so you weren’t!”</p><p>nest, an outsider actually has a compatibility score of eight stars with our ancestor’s inheritance. It’s really blinding.</p><p>The surrounding mo family members were already in a state of confusion.</p><p>this is God’s will, God’s will! God bless the mo family, hahaha!</p><p>The white-haired old man in the pavilion was so excited that he was trembling. His eyes were filled with ecstasy.</p><p>“I must inform the master of this matter immediately!”</p><p>The white-haired old man muttered, then turned around and left.</p><p>“As expected!”</p><p>In the martial arts practice field, Lu Ming retracted his palm, deep in thought.</p><p>Previously, he had discovered that the so-called test of compatibility with the mo family’s ancestor’s inheritance was actually related to the Dragon bloodline.</p><p>Lu Ming guessed that the mo family’s ancestor also had the bloodline of a Cloud Dragon or a flood Dragon. That was why mo Ying had such a high compatibility.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming had the bloodline of the nine Dragons and could be said to be the ancestor of all Dragons, so the compatibility was naturally high.</p><p>He had reached eight stars.</p><p>“It’s a pity that brother Lu is an outsider!”</p><p>Mo Ying sighed in her heart.</p><p>“Moying, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Mo Ying nodded and returned to the courtyard with Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, an urgent discussion was going on in a secret room of the mo family.</p><p>Two days later, a middle-aged man came to mo Ying’s courtyard.</p><p>“Greetings, patriarch!”</p><p>Mo Ying and the others quickly saluted.</p><p>This middle-aged man was the mo family’s head.</p><p>little Ying, tomorrow, you will go and inherit the ancestor’s inheritance!</p><p>The head of the mo family did not beat around the bush and went straight to the point.</p><p>“Tomorrow? so soon?”</p><p>Mo Ying was stunned, obviously a little surprised.</p><p>a long night is fraught with dreams. The sooner you inherit the ancestor’s legacy, the sooner you carry it forward, the sooner I can rest assured!</p><p>The head of the mo family smiled and was very kind.</p><p>“Thank you, master!”</p><p>Mo Ying bowed excitedly.</p><p>She was originally just a branch family member of the mo family. It was already very difficult for her to reach this stage. Furthermore, she was going to inherit the ancestor’s inheritance tomorrow. This was a Supreme honor in the mo family. At this moment, she was deeply grateful to the family head and the mo family.</p><p>“Haha, no need for such formalities!”</p><p>The head of the mo family laughed heartily. He then looked at Lu Ming and said,”You must be young hero Lu Ming, right?”</p><p>“That’s me. Greetings, mo family head!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>haha, you don’t have to be so polite, young hero Lu. Two days ago, you resonated with the testing stone pillar. This news has long spread throughout the mo family. It’s a miracle, a miracle indeed.</p><p>The head of the mo family sighed and changed his tone, ” here, I still need young hero Lu’s help with one more thing.</p><p>“You need my help? May I know what’s the matter?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little curious.</p><p>I want to invite young hero Lu and moying to go to the land of the ancestor’s inheritance and help moying get the inheritance.</p><p>The head of the mo family said.</p><p>“Me?”</p><p>This time, not only Lu Ming, but even mo Ying was a little surprised.</p><p>that’s right. To be honest, it’s not easy to inherit the ancestor’s inheritance. There might be some obstacles along the way. Young hero Lu’s compatibility with the mo family’s ancestor’s inheritance is as high as eight stars. With you following and helping mo Ying, nothing will go wrong. I hope young hero Lu can agree.</p><p>The head of the mo family cupped his fists and said.</p><p>“Mo family head is too polite. Since I can help mo Ying, I will not refuse.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>That was good. Lu Ming wanted to see what it was that made the nine Dragons ‘bloodline so excited.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming had agreed, the head of the mo family was elated. He chatted with the two of them for a while before leaving.</p><p>“Brother Lu, I’ll have to trouble you again!”</p><p>Mo Ying slightly bowed, her eyes as clear as water.</p><p>A day’s time quickly passed.</p><p>The next day, the mo family head sent someone to pick mo Ying and Lu Ming up.</p><p>Following the person who led the way, the two of them walked into the depths of the mo clan estate.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
