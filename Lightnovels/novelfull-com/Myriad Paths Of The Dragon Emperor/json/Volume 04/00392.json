According to speculation, it was the cave dwelling of an expert in the eastern nether ancient battlefield.</p><p>...</p><p>However, the cave was covered in inscriptions and there was no way to enter.</p><p>One could only enter after gathering all four keys.</p><p>Previously, three people, including the flying Ape, had arrived. They had been waiting for Ming Yan Peak’s return.</p><p>It was only today that Wu Hui of bright splendor peak arrived at this place. However, the Tiger-shaped key had fallen into Lu Ming’s hands. That was why they had come to look for Lu Ming together.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. This was more reasonable.</p><p>brother Lu, now that you have the Tiger key, you will naturally have a share of the ancient ruins. How about exploring the ancient ruins with us? ”</p><p>Coldflow wood said.</p><p>“Alright, when do we leave?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“We can set off in a few hours!”</p><p>The Coldflow tree and the others were overjoyed.</p><p>brother Lu, you can make some preparations. We will meet outside the city in three hours!</p><p>Ye Tiannan said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and the crowd dispersed.</p><p>Lu Ming strolled around casually and returned to the previous room. He closed his eyes to rest. Three hours later, his figure flashed and he left the city.</p><p>When he arrived outside the city, he found that the people from Coldflow tree, no return, and ye Tiannan had already arrived.</p><p>There were a total of 100 people from the three forces, and they were going together.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was alone. He was rather special.</p><p>If Lu Ming had not killed the flying Ape in a domineering manner a few days ago and displayed his astonishing combat strength, most likely no one would have taken him seriously.</p><p>“Brother Lu, you’re here!”</p><p>The cold flowing wood revealed a happy expression.</p><p>alright! Lu Ming nodded and said, ” let’s go then!</p><p>Immediately, more than a hundred people rose into the air and headed north.</p><p>Four hours later, the group had already flown more than a hundred thousand miles.</p><p>The surrounding environment became more and more remote, and there were mountains everywhere.</p><p>After flying for another few thousand miles, a majestic mountain range appeared in front of them. This mountain range was endless, like a Crouching Dragon.</p><p>Everyone landed at the head of the mountain range.</p><p>At the foot of the mountain, there was a huge stone door that was tightly closed.</p><p>this is the ancient ruin, and the stone door is the entrance. We tried our best, but we couldn’t break the stone door at all. We can only use the key to activate the inscriptions from the four statues to enter!</p><p>Coldflow wood pointed to the front of the stone door.</p><p>Lu Ming looked in that direction. Indeed, he saw four statues outside the stone door.</p><p>The four statues were the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and black Tortoise.</p><p>It corresponded to their four keys.</p><p>Lu Ming, Coldflow wood, ye Tiannan, and wuhui exchanged glances and flew forward.</p><p>Lu Ming came before The White Tiger statue.</p><p>Then, an iron plate appeared in each of their hands.</p><p>“Open!”</p><p>The four of them shouted and poured their Zhen Qi into the metal plate.</p><p>The four metal plates immediately emitted a hazy radiance.</p><p>In the next moment, the four statues started to glow as well. Runes appeared one after another, flowing with light and vibrant colors.</p><p>The light from the statue resonated with the light from the four metal pieces.</p><p>Then, the light from the four statues gathered together and shot towards the stone door.</p><p>Ka ka!</p><p>When the light hit the stone door, it began to make a cracking sound and slowly opened.</p><p>hahaha, the opening of the ancient ruins. We’ve spent a few days waiting. We didn’t wait in vain!</p><p>At this moment, an excited laugh came from the distant sky.</p><p>Many black figures were approaching from the distance.</p><p>not good. The Mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the Oriole behind. We’ve been targeted.</p><p>The Coldflow tree’s expression changed greatly.</p><p>“The people from the nether demon Palace!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>In the distant sky, the figures that were flying over at high speed were all wearing black skeleton robes. Weren’t they the clothes of the nether demon Palace?</p><p>“The nether devil Palace, it’s the nether devil Palace!”</p><p>The geniuses of han Shangu, Ming Yan peak, and the other two forces all exclaimed.</p><p>“Since you’ve opened the ancient monument, I can let you go. Hurry up and get lost!”</p><p>A cold voice came from afar.</p><p>The speed of the people from the nether demon Palace was extremely fast. At the start, they were still a few dozen miles away. Now, they were already close and would arrive soon.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He reached out and grabbed the Tiger-shaped key. In a flash, his figure was like a bolt of lightning as he rushed into the stone door.</p><p>“Who is it? Damn it, you still dare to rush in, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>A furious roar was heard.</p><p>“It’s him? I can see that he has killed a few junior brothers of our nether demon Palace. One of the junior brothers has sent me an image. It’s that kid!”</p><p>A cold voice sounded.</p><p>“Let’s charge too!”</p><p>Coldflow wood gritted his teeth and also rushed towards the stone door.</p><p>Then, ye Tiannan and no return’s forces both rushed towards the stone gate.</p><p>All of this happened in the span of a few breaths.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>When ye Tiannan and the others entered the stone door, more than a hundred figures appeared in front of the stone door.</p><p>All of them were experts from the nether demon Palace.</p><p>The person in the lead had a slender figure and a cold expression. He exuded a terrifying aura.</p><p>It was an aura that was several times stronger than the flying Ape.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>The cold-looking young man ordered.</p><p>In an instant, with a flash, the over 100 people from the nether demon Palace also rushed through the stone gate.</p><p>But once they entered the stone door, they could not help but stop.</p><p>That was because four paths had appeared in front of him, and he had no idea where they led to.</p><p>“Senior brother, what should we do?”</p><p>A two-meter tall young man looked at the cold young man.</p><p>This cold young man was the strongest person in the nether demon Palace, you Feiyu.</p><p>let’s chase them in groups. Junior Brother Fei Shi, take some people and chase this one. Junior Brother Fei Ye, take some people and chase this one …</p><p>You Feiyu immediately ordered.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll definitely make those who walk this path regret it!”</p><p>The tall young man shouted coldly and led the twenty young men to the far left. They chased after a road with a stone carving of a White Tiger and disappeared in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The others from the nether demon Palace also led their men and chased after the other three paths.</p><p>…</p><p>The moment Lu Ming rushed through the stone door, he did not hesitate and dashed toward the leftmost road, which had a White Tiger engraved on it.</p><p>The road was very long, and they rushed for more than ten miles before they found something strange.</p><p>There were a few stone rooms on both sides of the road.</p><p>Lu Ming walked in to take a look and was a little disappointed.</p><p>From these stone rooms, it was not difficult to tell that this should be a pill refining room.</p><p>However, too much time had passed, and everything inside had been reduced to dust. Even the pill furnace had rotted away, leaving nothing behind.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop and continued to move forward.</p><p>Suddenly, his figure stopped abruptly.</p><p>This was because he felt as if his entire body had suddenly become several times heavier. There seemed to be an endless pressure acting on his body from all around.</p><p>there’s an inscription formation in this area, and it’s extremely powerful. Let alone flying, even walking is difficult! zhang xuan said.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered to himself. He tensed his body and circulated his essential Qi to resist the external pressure and continued to move forward.</p><p>However, in this way, Lu Ming’s speed was greatly reduced.</p><p>Ten minutes later, there was a fiery red light in front of them, and a huge platform appeared.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
