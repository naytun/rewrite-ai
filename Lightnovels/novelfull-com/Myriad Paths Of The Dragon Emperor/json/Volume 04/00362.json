It was mercilessly eliminated.</p><p>Following that, a few more people came forward with a fluke mind, but they were all eliminated one by one.</p><p>The rest of the people shook their heads and sighed. No one continued to test because there was no need. They knew best whether their control force had reached large success or not.</p><p>“Alright, those who were eliminated, leave this place. Those who succeeded, follow me into myriad illusion Canyon.”</p><p>Lu Xiu shouted.</p><p>Those who had been eliminated sighed and soared into the air, ending the selection of the Ditian divine guards.</p><p>“Alright, follow me!”</p><p>Lu Xiu said, then turned around and walked back.</p><p>Ten thousand illusion Canyon was in the middle of the two mountain peaks.</p><p>That place was heavily guarded.</p><p>As he followed Lu Xiu, he was not obstructed by any obstacles and entered the canyon.</p><p>The canyon was very wide, at least a thousand meters wide, and on both sides were cliffs that were thousands of feet tall.</p><p>In front of the canyon, there was a huge light screen that separated the canyon.</p><p>Behind the light screen, it was all blurry and he could not see anything clearly.</p><p>“Behind this layer of light is a large inscription array, called the ten thousand illusionary killing array. The second round of the preliminaries will be carried out in this ten thousand illusionary killing array.”</p><p>as long as you enter the ten thousand illusionary killing array, powerful warriors or demonic beasts will be condensed inside. As long as you kill the Warriors or demonic beasts inside, you will be able to obtain the corresponding points. The two stone tablets in front of the ten thousand illusionary killing array will show your points and ranking.</p><p>only those who have scored 500 points will be considered to have passed and be able to participate in the true selection of the Emperor sky divine guards. The time limit is only half an hour. Once the time is up, you will be automatically transported out. This standard is the same in many regions in the eastern part of the Tianxuan region.</p><p>Lu Xiu briefly introduced the rules of the second round.</p><p>Sure enough, in front of the light curtain, they saw two huge stone tablets that were a hundred meters tall and dozens of meters wide.</p><p>“Alright, the rules are very simple. Next, it will depend on your strength. The ten thousand illusionary killing formation can allow fifty people to enter at a time. You can make your own choice. We can start now.”</p><p>Lu Xiu announced.</p><p>As soon as Lu Xiu finished speaking, everyone looked at each other. Then, someone strode out and walked towards the ten thousand illusionary killing array.</p><p>With someone taking the lead, the others naturally followed one by one.</p><p>In a short while, 50 people had rushed into the ten thousand illusionary killing array.</p><p>When the 50 people rushed into the myriad illusionary killing array, the two stone tablets in front of them started to emit a hazy light.</p><p>After a few breaths, a few lines of words appeared on the first stone tablet.</p><p>Wasp, one point.</p><p>Long Mao, one point.</p><p>……</p><p>Seven to eight names appeared in succession, and behind the names were the corresponding points.</p><p>After a few more breaths, some people’s points went from one to two, and then to three.</p><p>More and more names appeared on the stone tablet.</p><p>Two minutes later, 50 names appeared on the stone tablet, and behind each name was the corresponding score.</p><p>Some people’s points increased very quickly, while some people’s points increased much slower.</p><p>After a while, someone had already reached 400 points, approaching 500.</p><p>As long as they reached 500 points, they would be able to pass the preliminaries and obtain the qualifications to participate in the true selection.</p><p>At this moment, the light screen trembled, and someone flew out from inside.</p><p>Everyone could see that wounds had appeared on this person’s body, and blood was dripping.</p><p>Everyone’s heart trembled. It seemed that this formation was not that safe.</p><p>After this person flew out, his name disappeared from the first stone tablet.</p><p>This person looked defeated. Clearly, he had failed.</p><p>After this person, the light screen would shake from time to time, and people would constantly fly out.</p><p>Without a doubt, none of these people who flew out had five hundred points. They all ended in failure.</p><p>When the half an hour was about to end, 47 people had already flown out, and none of these 47 people had reached 500 points.</p><p>Only the last three people who flew out had more than five hundred points.</p><p>The highest score was 553 points.</p><p>When the last three people came out, the second stone tablet lit up, and three names appeared.</p><p>First place, Hornets, 553 points.</p><p>Second place,…</p><p>The three names were those who had reached 500 points.</p><p>These three were naturally overjoyed, while the other forty-seven people had unsightly expressions and were extremely dejected.</p><p>The rest of the people who had not entered looked extremely serious.</p><p>The elimination rate was too high. Out of the 50 people, 47 people were eliminated, and only three passed.</p><p>Although there weren’t any impressive geniuses in this group, the elimination rate still made people gasp.</p><p>alright, the first group has finished. Next group, continue!</p><p>Lu Xiu announced.</p><p>But everyone looked at each other, and for a moment, no one stepped forward.</p><p>hurry up. The result will be the same in the morning and at night. It won’t be easier to get up at night.</p><p>Lu Xiu frowned.</p><p>“What’s there to hesitate about? I’ll go!”</p><p>Yang Liuji coldly snorted and strode forward.</p><p>After that, one figure after another also walked forward.</p><p>Fifty people disappeared from the light screen.</p><p>A breath after he entered the light screen, a name suddenly appeared on the first stone tablet.</p><p>Yang six extremes.</p><p>After that, yang Liuji’s points started to soar.</p><p>One, two, five, ten …</p><p>The speed at which his points rose was terrifying. In just five minutes, his points had already exceeded 500 and were still rising.</p><p>The others were much slower than him.</p><p>Yang Liuji’s points only started to slow down when he reached 1000 points.</p><p>At this moment, the light screen trembled again, and someone flew out from inside.</p><p>Soon, half an hour had passed, and everyone in the group had come out.</p><p>This time, there were a total of six people who had more than five hundred points and passed the preliminaries.</p><p>The names of these six people also appeared on the second stone tablet. Including the three people before them, there were a total of nine names on the second stone tablet.</p><p>On the other hand, yang Liuji had obtained a total of 1210 points, ranking first.</p><p>Yang Liuji had a smug expression as he walked to the side.</p><p>After that, the third group of fifty people entered.</p><p>This time, five people passed.</p><p>In this group, there was also a genius on the cloud Emperor ranking. This person was slightly stronger than yang Liuji and had 22 points more than him. He rushed to the first place, while yang Liuji became second.</p><p>Then, the fourth group, the fifth group …</p><p>Group by group, they went in. The further they went, the more experts went in, and the more qualified people there were.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
