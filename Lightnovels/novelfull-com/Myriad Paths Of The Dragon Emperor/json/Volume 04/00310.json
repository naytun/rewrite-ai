The terrifying devouring power was attached to his left palm. His left palm was like a black hole, devouring the rolling blood essence.</p><p>Wherever he passed, be it the blood essence of humans or wolves, he would devour and refine it.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming split half of the energy to increase his cultivation.</p><p>Although the grey wolf cavalry were not very strong individually, they had the advantage in numbers.</p><p>His cultivation base was slowly rising.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The blood red Cavalry’s shouts shook the heavens as they continued to take the lives of the grey wolf cavalry.</p><p>The commotion here naturally alerted the battle on the other side.</p><p>the grey wolf Army is about to be destroyed. Our reinforcements are here.</p><p>A loud shout came from the northern Army.</p><p>As for the Army of the Dark Moon Empire, they were extremely shocked.</p><p>“Send reinforcements to the grey wolf cavalry, quickly!”</p><p>A general shouted.</p><p>Instantly, twenty thousand ordinary armored horsemen charged toward Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Kill, exterminate them!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared and took the lead in charging towards the 20000-strong Army.</p><p>The other blood red Cavalry followed closely behind.</p><p>At this moment, the ten thousand Grey Wolf cavalry were almost completely annihilated. Only a few hundred people were left, and they were fleeing in all directions.</p><p>The blood red Cavalry once again formed a knife-like formation and charged toward the enemy.</p><p>This time, it was even more one-sided. The moment they clashed, the enemy’s 20000 cavalrymen collapsed.</p><p>The bloodred scaled Wolf howled, and the enemy’s Mount trembled, its combat strength greatly reduced.</p><p>The bloodred scaled Wolf waved its claws, and several cavalrymen were torn apart.</p><p>Without any power to resist, it was still a massacre.</p><p>“Send out the signal for reinforcements!”</p><p>An exasperated roar came from the Dark Moon Empire’s Army.</p><p>Then, fireworks flew into the sky, forming a Dark Moon.</p><p>The fierce battle continued. The bloodred scaled Wolf went into battle for the first time and displayed unparalleled combat power. Facing an enemy that was several times its size, it easily tore apart the enemy’s battle formation and slaughtered the enemy cavalry.</p><p>Corpses were everywhere, truly everywhere.</p><p>In the middle of the battle, Lu Ming’s cultivation had a breakthrough and reached the middle stage of the second level of martial ancestor realm.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Not long after, a deafening sound of vibration rang out in the world.</p><p>In the distance, a tiger’s roar shook the sky. It was the Bloodmoon demonic Tiger.</p><p>The overwhelming Bloodmoon demonic Tiger Army was charging towards them.</p><p>There were a total of 20000 Bloodmoon demonic Tigers. In addition to the 10000 from before, the Bloodmoon demonic Tiger Army had a total of 30000 people.</p><p>“Kill! Annihilate that bloodscale Wolf cavalry!”</p><p>The leader of the Bloodmoon demonic Tiger Legion was a general in blood-red armor. He was extremely burly and held a Mace in his hand. His aura was as strong as a mountain.</p><p>what a strong aura! This is the aura of a seventh level martial ancestor!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and a hint of solemness appeared.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Without any hesitation, Lu Ming led the 8000 blood red iron cavalry and charged towards the 20000 Bloodmoon demonic Tiger Army.</p><p>The two armies were getting closer and closer.</p><p>“Brat, die!”</p><p>The blood-armored general roared and smashed the mace in his hand toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The mace smashed down, and the space shook violently.</p><p>“Golden Eye!”</p><p>With a thought, the Golden-eyed blood zombie beside him roared and charged at the blood-armored burly man.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood corpse and the blood-armored general clashed, causing loud rumbles.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming stabbed with his spear. The power of wind and Fire fused and exploded.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s spear pierced through the heart of a fifth-tier martial arts Grandmaster and he fell to the ground.</p><p>Lu Ming rushed over and devoured his blood essence, refining it at an extreme speed.</p><p>Then, he swept his long spear across. A hundred-meter long spear radiance swept across, and dozens of Bloodmoon demonic Tiger cavalrymen were blown up. Their flesh and blood, metal armor, and fragments scattered all over the ground.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The two sides were engaged in a great battle.</p><p>The battle was extremely brutal.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood corpse roared and attacked the blood-armored general without fear.</p><p>The blood-armored general was at a complete disadvantage.</p><p>“Beast palm!”</p><p>Lu Ming threw a huge beast palm at the blood-armored general.</p><p>“Great demonic palm!”</p><p>Not far away, Xie nianqing also sent out a few palm strikes. His ink-black palm prints were also aimed at the blood-armored general.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Although the blood-armored general was very brave, he couldn’t take the fierce attacks of the Golden-eyed blood zombie. In addition to Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s attacks, his body shook violently as he spat out blood and retreated.</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>However, the Golden-eyed blood zombie wouldn’t miss this opportunity. It pounced forward and its ten fingernails were sharper than sabers. They instantly tore the blood-armored General’s armor into pieces.</p><p>Lu Ming rushed forward and devoured his blood essence.</p><p>This was the blood essence of a 7th level martial ancestor realm martial artist. It was simply too shocking.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to refine and his cultivation level began to increase rapidly.</p><p>“The general has been killed!”</p><p>Someone from the Bloodmoon demonic Tiger Legion shouted.</p><p>The Bloodmoon demonic Tiger Army’s general had been killed, and their morale had plummeted. On the other hand, the blood red Cavalry’s morale had risen.</p><p>general tianyun is invincible! General tianyun is invincible!</p><p>The blood red Cavalry roared as they charged towards the enemy.</p><p>Slowly, the Scarlet demonic Tiger Army began to collapse.</p><p>On the battlefield, victory and defeat could be determined by a hair’s breadth.</p><p>Once it collapsed, the Army would be defeated like a landslide.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The blood red Cavalry’s eyes were bloodshot as they madly charged at the enemy.</p><p>“Hold on, hold on!”</p><p>A Deputy general of the Bloodmoon demonic Tiger Legion roared, trying to block the attack and turn the tide. However, it was all in vain. The Bloodmoon demonic Tiger Legion’s defeat was already set in stone.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In the distant sky, a series of explosions could be heard.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were like lightning as he looked in that direction.</p><p>A dozen miles away in the sky, there was also an intense battle.</p><p>That was the battlefield of the experts. That was because the people fighting there were all experts above the martial arts Grandmaster realm.</p><p>There were 40 to 50 people fighting in the sky.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that there were actually experts from the mystical sword sect and the ghost moon saber sect among them.</p><p>The others were undoubtedly powerhouses of the yinyue Empire.</p><p>“That’s Qiu Yue!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly saw a familiar figure in the crowd. It was Qiu Yue.</p><p>It was obvious that Qiu Yue had already reached the martial arts Grandmaster realm after not seeing her for such a long time.</p><p>“Huaying, I’ll leave the blood red Cavalry to you for now!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s loud shout could be heard from afar.</p><p>Huaying was stunned. Although she did not understand the reason, she immediately replied, ” “Yes!”</p><p>On the battlefield, one only had to obey.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll leave the blood red Cavalry to you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>There was no longer any suspense in the battle here. Lu Ming was assured to leave it to Hua Ying, who was well-versed in the art of commanding troops.</p><p>“Goldeneye, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed, and he rose from the bloodscaled Wolf King’s body and flew into the sky.</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood corpse followed closely behind Lu Ming.</p><p>The distance of a dozen miles was covered in an instant.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>The moment Lu Ming arrived, an expert from the Dark Moon Empire had his eyes on him.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
