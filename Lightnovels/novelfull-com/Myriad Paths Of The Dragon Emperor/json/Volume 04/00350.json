It was almost impossible to kill him.</p><p>“What about Yin tianjue? Still no response?”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang asked.</p><p>“No, the messenger he sent said that Yin tianjue didn’t see him at all.”</p><p>damn it, Yin tianjue, that old fox. He’s waiting for us to both suffer losses so that he can benefit from it!</p><p>Qiu Wuyang shouted angrily.</p><p>“Sect leader, you don’t have to worry so much. It won’t take long for us to destroy the mystical sword sect, the Crimson Cloud Valley, and Lu Ming.”</p><p>At this moment, a clear voice was heard.</p><p>As soon as he said that, everyone’s eyes turned to the person who spoke.</p><p>This man was in his twenties, and he was Qiu changkong.</p><p>“Zhangkong, do you have a way to solve this?”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang asked.</p><p>“Haha, sect leader, and all the seniors present, have you all forgotten that the day of recruitment for the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, which happens once every five years, is about to arrive?”</p><p>Qiu changkong laughed.</p><p>“The Empyrean heaven divine Palace is recruiting empyrean heaven divine guards?”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang was stunned at first, but then he seemed to have thought of something and said ecstatically, ” “Haha, that’s right. Look at how anxious I am. I’ve forgotten about this. Changkong, with the help of that person, there’s a great chance for you to join the Emperor sky divine guards. As long as you join the Emperor sky divine guards and borrow a little of the Emperor sky divine Palace’s power, the mystic essence sword sect, the Crimson Cloud Valley, and Lu Ming will all be annihilated with the flip of a hand!”</p><p>“That’s right. Haha, why didn’t I think of that?”</p><p>Some of the Golden-robed elders of the ten direction Sword School also laughed in a carefree manner.</p><p>As for the experts from heavenly fiend sect, they were a little puzzled.</p><p>“Brother Qiu, as far as I know, the Ditian divine guards only recruit once every five years. All of them are extremely rare and monstrous geniuses. Furthermore, they’re not recruiting from the 36 countries of Emperor Yun, but from the entire Eastern Region of the Tianxuan region.”</p><p>“The Eastern Region of the Tianxuan region is extremely vast. The cloud Emperor mountain range that the 36 nations of the cloud Emperor Empire are located in is merely a small part of it. There are many regions that are larger than the cloud Emperor mountain range and it can be said that geniuses are as common as clouds. It’s not that I’m looking down on nephew changkong, but your talent is naturally extremely shocking. However, it’s still a long story if you want to join the Emperor sky divine guards.”</p><p>The sect master of heavenly fiend sect said from the side.</p><p>The divine wilderness continent had many large regions. The cloud Emperor mountain range was located in the Tianxuan region.</p><p>The Tianxuan region was extremely vast and the cloud Emperor mountain range was just an unremarkable mountain range in the Tianxuan region.</p><p>Even though Qiu changkong’s strength was unparalleled in the blazing sun Empire, and countless young geniuses paled in comparison to him, he was nothing in the entire Eastern Region of the Tianxuan region.</p><p>On the other hand, Qiu changkong, Qiu Wuyang, and the elder from the ten direction sword sect seemed very confident. It was no wonder that tiansha sect leader was confused.</p><p>“Haha, there’s something that brother Zuo doesn’t know. There’s no harm in telling you. Changkong has always been talented and intelligent since young. When he was young, he was taken in as an in-name disciple by a major character from the eastern branch of the Emperor heaven divine Palace. During these years, that major character would occasionally come to the ten directions sword sect to guide changkong.”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang smiled proudly.</p><p>“What? Nephew changkong was accepted as an in-name disciple by a major character of the Emperor heaven divine Palace?”</p><p>The sect master of heavenly fiend sect stood up from his chair with a loud bang and was practically shouting.</p><p>The Heavenly King of suppression and a few other experts from heavenly fiend sect had the same expression.</p><p>Shocking, this was too shocking.</p><p>A major character in the eastern Palace of the Emperor heaven divine Palace, what kind of existence was that? He had actually taken a fancy to Qiu changkong and accepted him as an in-name disciple.</p><p>Although he was only an in-name disciple and not a true disciple, it was already shocking enough.</p><p>no wonder, no wonder Qiu changkong could be so much ahead of the other geniuses and enter the cloud Emperor ranking. He even killed a genius on the cloud Emperor ranking not long ago. I see, I see!</p><p>The tiansha sect master sighed as he looked at Qiu changkong with envy.</p><p>“Haha, we’ll pull back our forces now and maintain a stalemate with the mystical sword sect. When changkong becomes an empyrean heaven Divine Guard, we’ll be able to use a bit of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace’s power and annihilate the mystical sword sect and the Crimson Cloud Valley in an instant.”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang laughed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Lu Yuntian, the Martial Emperor’s treasure is mine. Let’s see how long you can hide!”</p><p>Qiu changkong’s eyes were filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>Ever since the news that Lu Ming was Lu Yuntian spread, Qiu changkong had deduced that Lu Yuntian was Lu Ming’s father and that Lu Ming was the one who had saved Lu Yuntian.</p><p>“Lu Yuntian has been holding back for so many years because he wants to pass on the secret of the Martial Emperor’s treasure to his son. Lu Ming, you should know about the secret of the Martial Emperor’s treasure by now, right? well, I’ll pry it out of you.”</p><p>Qiu changkong’s eyes flashed with a sinister light.</p><p>After a short while, Qiu Wuyang gave the order for the Shifang sword sect to withdraw their forces and start defending, waiting for the day when the Empyrean heaven divine Palace recruited the Empyrean heaven divine guards.</p><p>They didn’t have to wait long.</p><p>A month later, both sides stopped fighting at the same time. The higher-ups of both sides issued orders that not even small conflicts were allowed to happen. Anyone who violated this order would be executed!</p><p>Because on this day, an emissary from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace had arrived at the blazing sun Empire.</p><p>Every time the Empyrean heaven divine Palace was about to recruit the Empyrean heaven divine guards, they would send out emissaries to patrol the various countries and send out invitations to those geniuses.</p><p>Only geniuses who received an invitation letter could participate in the selection of the Ditian divine guards.</p><p>With the arrival of the emissary from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, both parties naturally did not dare to start a war, for fear of causing the emissary to be unhappy.</p><p>Both parties were waiting for the emissaries of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace to send out their invitations.</p><p>…</p><p>In a secret chamber in the ten square Mountain, Qiu Wuyang and Qiu changkong were sitting opposite each other.</p><p>“Zhangkong, Lu Ming’s talent is also extremely shocking. If he were to participate in the Ditian Divine Guard selection, he might pose a threat to you. Although this threat is very small, you can’t let him off!”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang said.</p><p>“Lu Ming, he won’t be able to receive the invitation!”</p><p>Qiu changkong said with a cold smile on his face.</p><p>“You can’t get an invitation? Could he be the master of your empyrean heaven divine Palace?”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang was overjoyed.</p><p>Qiu changkong shook his head. it’s just a small matter. There’s no need to trouble master. It’s one of my senior brothers. I’ve already sent him a message. Lu Ming won’t be able to receive the invitation!</p><p>Qiu changkong laughed coldly and said with a hint of pride.</p><p>“Haha, this is great!”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang laughed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
