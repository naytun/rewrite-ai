I’ll let you watch your disciple die in front of you!</p><p>Qiu Wuyang sneered.</p><p>At this moment, they were not in a hurry to attack. They wanted Lin Xueyi to watch as Feng Wuji was killed. This way, Lin Xueyi’s mind would be crushed and it would be easier to kill her.</p><p>“Feng Wuji, today will be your doomsday!”</p><p>Duanmu Lin’s long hair fluttered in the wind, and he was in high spirits. His entire person was filled with an aura of supremacy.</p><p>His eyes were bright and full of arrogance.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Duanmu Lin slashed out another saber and the saber Light was extremely sharp. Feng Wuji tried his best to defend but he was heavily injured and was no match for Duanmu Lin. His body was sent flying like a cannonball and a long gash appeared on his chest.</p><p>“Wuji!”</p><p>“Senior brother Wuji!”</p><p>Countless people from the mystical sword sect shouted when they saw this. They wanted to rush over to help, but everyone had an opponent. They were entangled by their opponents and couldn’t help at all.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>High up in the sky, Qiu Wuyang, Duanmu canghai, and Yin tianjue laughed out loud.</p><p>Below Feng Wuji and Duanmu Lin’s battlefield, a few figures were looking up.</p><p>One of them, with a graceful bearing, was Lu Yao.</p><p>The others were experts from the Duanmu family and were responsible for protecting her.</p><p>Lu Yao was here to witness the rise of Duanmu Lin.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Yao’s eyes had a hint of complexity.</p><p>She was also a little stunned by the Duanmu family’s betrayal of the mystical sword sect.</p><p>But on second thought, she felt relieved.</p><p>that’s even better. If the Duanmu family replaces the mystical sword sect, my status will be even higher in the future. I’ve already cultivated to the sixth grade great Martial Master realm, and it won’t be long before I can break through to the martial ancestor realm. At that time, I must awaken a King rank bloodline. That way, I can live together with brother Lin and become a legend!</p><p>“Lu Ming, Lu Ming, did you see that? Now, brother Lin had even trampled on Feng Wuji, one of the six heroes of the scorching sun sect. Even if you have some talent, how can you compare to brother Lin? How can you be worthy of me?”</p><p>“It’s a pity that you’re not in the mystical sword sect, so you won’t be able to see this. If you were to see this, how would you feel inferior?”</p><p>Lu Yao looked at Duanmu Lin, who was in high Spirits in the Sky. His eyes were bright, full of pride and anticipation.</p><p>Feng Wuji, you are the first one among the six heroes that I’ve fought. Today, I will step Over Your Dead Body and rise to the top.</p><p>“It’s your honor to be my stepping stone.”</p><p>In the air, Duanmu Lin looked at Feng Wuji with disdain and was in high spirits.</p><p>“Duanmu Lin, you won’t have the chance to do so.”</p><p>At this moment, a clear voice came from the distance.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Duanmu Lin’s eyes turned cold as he looked into the distance.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>In the distance, three beams of light shot toward them.</p><p>“Who’s there? You’re looking for death!”</p><p>An expert from the ten directions Sword School shouted and charged toward the three beams of light.</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>A few claw lights flew out and several sixth grade martial ancestor realm experts from the ten direction Sword School were torn into pieces.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>&Nbsp; the rainbow light vanished, and three figures appeared in the air.</p><p>“It’s you? The champion, hou tianyun!”</p><p>As soon as the three figures appeared, someone shouted.</p><p>Everyone in the mystical sword sect who was in the middle of a battle felt their hearts skip a beat as they couldn’t help but look over.</p><p>The champion Marquis tianyun was famous throughout the blazing sun Empire. However, why was he here?</p><p>The three people who had suddenly appeared were Lu Ming, Yan Quan, and the Golden-eyed blood corpse.</p><p>The gazing immortal pass wasn’t far from the mystical sword sect.</p><p>Lu Ming led thirty thousand blood red Cavalry. After more than a day of travel, they finally neared the mystical sword sect.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming, Yan Quan, and the Golden-eyed blood zombie had arrived at the mystical sword sect.</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but speak up when he saw Duanmu Lin’s arrogant look.</p><p>Duanmu Lin’s expression could not help but turn grave as he looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>Duanmu Lin naturally knew of Marquis champion Lu Ming. Moreover, Lu Ming had killed Qiu changlie, a genius from the omnipresent sword sect. He was extremely powerful, and Duanmu Lin did not dare to underestimate him.</p><p>“This fellow actually managed to rush here. Where are his blood red Cavalry?”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang’s expression changed slightly.</p><p>Qiu Wuyang knew that Lu Ming had led the blood red Cavalry to the North of the blazing sun Empire to rescue Hua Chi.</p><p>However, he had not sent anyone to deal with Lu Ming during this period of time because he had to deal with the mystical sword sect.</p><p>In his eyes, Lu Ming was just a small fry. After he dealt with the mystical sword sect and the Crimson Cloud Valley, he could kill Lu Ming and his blood red Cavalry with a flip of his hand.</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi’s eyes moved, revealing a complicated expression.</p><p>“Tianyun, what are you doing here?”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang’s voice came from the sky.</p><p>“I’m naturally here to kill you.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>As soon as he said that, everyone’s hearts trembled.</p><p>To kill Qiu Wuyang and the others?</p><p>What an arrogant tone.</p><p>hahaha, champion hou tianyun, you are indeed full of pride. But in my opinion, you must have been blinded by your pride. That’s right, you’ve achieved so much at such a young age. It’s normal to lose yourself. It’s ridiculous that you want to kill us.</p><p>how about this? I can see that you are a talent. If you join me now, I can consider putting you in an important position. In the future, you can become the Grand Marshal of the world’s Army and guard the burning sun Empire. It’s not a bad idea!</p><p>Qiu Wuyang said.</p><p>“What Bullsh * t Grand Marshal? do you think I care? Qiu Wuyang, to be honest, I’m more interested in your head.”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“Impudent! You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang’s face turned cold, and his eyes were filled with killing intent. He waved his hand and a shocking sword radiance slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Qiu Wuyang, you’re shameless!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi’s face changed and she was about to help.</p><p>“Lin Xueyi, your opponent is me.”</p><p>Duanmu canghai’s figure moved and blocked Lin Xueyi.</p><p>On the other side, Yin tianjue was also staring at Shangguan Ming, preventing him from helping.</p><p>“What Marquis champion? How dare you oppose this Lord, you overestimate your own abilities, die!”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang’s eyes were cold.</p><p>However, facing Qiu Wuyang’s sword radiance, Lu Ming’s expression was very calm. He stood there without moving.</p><p>it’s over. The champion, hou tianyun, a hero of his generation, is going to be killed just like that? ”</p><p>Many people in the surroundings sighed.</p><p>No one thought that Lu Ming would survive.</p><p>Qiu Wuyang was a half-step King, and only a half-step King could block his attack.</p><p>However, how many half-step Kings did the burning sun Empire have?</p><p>There were only a dozen of them.</p><p>Who could save Lu Ming now?</p><p>Then, a scene that left everyone dumbfounded appeared.</p><p>Yan Quan, who was beside Lu Ming, stepped forward and threw a punch.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The space trembled violently. Then, a terrifying fist radiance burst out.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
