He wanted to see what the other party was selling.</p><p>“Tianyun, you’ve repeatedly opposed my ten direction Sword School and killed our geniuses and experts. Do you admit your crimes?”</p><p>The old man in the lead glared at Lu Ming with a cold gaze.</p><p>“Admit to your crimes? I haven’t even said that killing a few dogshit things from your Shifang sword sect would dirty my hands, and you want me to admit to my crimes? What crime?”</p><p>Lu Ming replied indifferently. He did not take the other party seriously at all.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>The leading old man’s face turned ashen, and he exuded an ice-cold killing intent. After a long time, he calmed down, waved his sleeves, and said in a deep voice, ” “Tianyun, there are no eternal enemies in the world, only eternal interests. Today, I can give you a chance to atone for your sins. As long as you lead the blood red Cavalry and pledge your loyalty to the ten direction sword sect, and make a blood oath, I can consider letting you go. All the crimes you’ve committed in the past can be written off.”</p><p>After the old man finished speaking, everyone understood what the other party meant.</p><p>Now that the red blood Army was powerful and famous in the sun nation and the moon nation, the omnidirectional sword sect was planning to recruit Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“I want you to let me go? Who the hell do you think you are, you old thing? do you really think you’re some Big Shot? alright, are you done with your nonsense? if you’re done, you can go and die.”</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at the other party and lost his patience.</p><p>little bastard, you refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit. Then I will kill you today. After I kill you, the red blood Legion will still belong to my ten direction sword sect. Die!</p><p>The old man’s face completely darkened. He shouted angrily and slashed out with his sword.</p><p>This sword fully displayed the elder’s strength of the eighth level of the martial ancestor realm. It had the power to split mountains and break rivers, which was extremely shocking.</p><p>“Not good, be careful!”</p><p>Ming Meng roared.</p><p>“Young master!”</p><p>“Dodge!”</p><p>“Lord Marquis!”</p><p>Qiu Yue, Xie nianqing, Huaying, and the others were all shocked.</p><p>No matter how strong Lu Ming was, it was impossible for him to be a match for a martial arts Grandmaster at the peak of the eighth level.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was still riding on the Crimson scaled Wolf King.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The old man’s expression was ferocious. The sword light became even more dazzling and quickly slashed at Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>Seeing that it was about to hit Lu Ming’s head, the old man was overjoyed.</p><p>He was screaming in his heart. What peerless genius? if he hadn’t grown up, what kind of genius was he? You’re still going to die in my hands.</p><p>However, as soon as he had this thought, he saw a slap coming from Lu Ming’s side.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>This slap was on his sword light. The sword light was like tofu and instantly shattered.</p><p>The old man was stunned.</p><p>Ming Meng, Qiu Yue, and the others were also stunned.</p><p>“It’s just a fly making a big fuss here. It’s so annoying,”</p><p>Yan Quan appeared beside Lu Ming and said indifferently.</p><p>The slap just now was, of course, from Yan Quan.</p><p>“You … Who are you? I’m an elder of the ten direction Sword School, you dare …”</p><p>The elder from the ten direction sword sect was stunned for a moment before he shouted.</p><p>However, before he could finish, Yan Quan’s palm struck again.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>No one could clearly see how this slap was swung. It was too fast. They only felt their vision blur, and then they heard a clear slap.</p><p>Then, the elder from the ten direction sword sect let out a blood-curdling scream and was sent flying. In the air, his head exploded like a watermelon, and red and white matter flew everywhere.</p><p>“This … This …”</p><p>Ming Meng and the others almost bit their tongues, their eyes almost popping out.</p><p>An expert at the peak of the martial ancestor 8-dan was considered a top-notch expert in the blazing sun Empire. In the five major sects, he was definitely a high and mighty existence. His status was even higher than that of an ordinary golden-robed elder.</p><p>The average golden-robed elder was only at the 7th level of the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>A peak martial ancestor 8-dan expert had actually been killed by a single slap.</p><p>This was too shocking.</p><p>The elder beside Lu Ming was actually such a terrifying expert?</p><p>Previously, when Ming Meng and the rest saw Yan Quan, they had only guessed that he was an ordinary martial arts Grandmaster. They had never expected him to be so terrifying.</p><p>Following that, they looked at Lu Ming with even more respect. Lu Ming could actually get such a person to follow him. How did he do it?</p><p>The two remaining men from the ten direction sword sect were scared out of their wits. They roared and turned to run.</p><p>“How is it possible for you to escape in front of me?”</p><p>Yan Quan coldly smiled and threw a punch.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Two fist forces shot out.</p><p>The two burly men at the peak of martial ancestor 7-Dan were directly drowned by the fist energy. When the fist energy disappeared, not even dregs were left of the two burly men.</p><p>To be able to deal with two experts at the peak of the 7th level of the martial ancestor realm so easily, it once again left everyone dumbfounded.</p><p>Lu Ming was the only exception.</p><p>“What a waste, what a waste!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart ached terribly.</p><p>Yan Quan’s punch had even burned his blood essence clean. How could Lu Ming not feel heartache? These were two experts in the 7th level of the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>The commotion here naturally shocked the ghost metal army several miles away.</p><p>“Not good! Tianyun has made his move! Kill, kill them all!”</p><p>Of course, there were also experts from the omnidirectional Sword School in the ghost metal army. They roared and led the Army to charge at Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>“Charge, crush them!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly.</p><p>OWW! OWW! …</p><p>The bloodred scaled Wolf howled madly, and its roar shook the sky as it charged towards the ghost metal army.</p><p>The power of the aura was earth-shaking.</p><p>“Not good, the Mount is frightened.”</p><p>“Charge, animal, hurry up and charge!”</p><p>The 30,000 Scarlet blood scaled wolves howled, causing the ghost metal Army’s mounts to be frightened, and their formation to become unstable.</p><p>And in this short moment, the bloodred scaled Wolf had already arrived.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two armies collided with each other.</p><p>At this moment, the winner was decided.</p><p>The ghost metal army was like a piece of paper, while the blood red Cavalry were like a blade. As soon as they touched, a hole was torn in the ghost metal army, and this hole was rapidly expanding.</p><p>“Hold on, hold on, you trash!”</p><p>An expert from the ten direction sword sect shouted.</p><p>“What are you shouting for?”</p><p>At this moment, Yan Quan’s figure appeared beside him.</p><p>“Argh! Help me …”</p><p>Just as he was about to shout, Yan Quan’s head was cut off with a wave of his hand.</p><p>Yan Quan leaped through the tens of thousands of soldiers and killed the martial Grandmaster expert. No one could stop him.</p><p>Half-step Kings were also something that only half-step Kings could block. Fighting against an Army of ten thousand was simply cheating.</p><p>Because the difference was too great, it was no longer something that could be solved with numbers.</p><p>Unless they had the mo family’s battle formation and dozens of martial arts grandmasters, they would not be able to fight back.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons hovered above Lu Ming’s head. With a loud roar, a terrifying devouring power erupted. Immediately, the bloodline power and blood essence of hundreds of ghost Iron Legion soldiers were forcibly devoured.</p><p>Lu Ming left behind a trail of corpses wherever he went.</p><p>This was a one-sided battle. The ghost iron army could not stop the red blood Army at all.</p><p>The battle cries shook the sky, corpses were strewn all over the ground, and blood Qi filled the air.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
