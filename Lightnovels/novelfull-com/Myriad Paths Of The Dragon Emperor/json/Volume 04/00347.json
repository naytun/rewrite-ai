Xiu! Xiu!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear shook and the Spear’s radiance burst out. These fourth and fifth grade martial arts grandmasters were easily killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming appeared in a flash. He looked down and frowned slightly.</p><p>Below, Lu Yao lay limply on the ground, her face filled with despair.</p><p>Duanmu canghai, Duanmu Lin, and Duanmu pojun all died.</p><p>The Duanmu family’s higher-ups were killed one after another in front of her eyes. This completely shattered her fantasy and her future.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s all your fault. You’ve ruined me.”</p><p>Lu Yao raised her head and looked at Lu Ming with reddened eyes. Her eyes were filled with resentment.</p><p>“I destroyed you? What a joke!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Lu Yao and chided her coldly.</p><p>“From the beginning to the end, I’ve never provoked you. You’ve been lying to me and even deprived me of my bloodline!”</p><p>“When I came to the mystical sword sect, it was the Duanmu family who tried to kill me time and time again. Now, you’re saying that I destroyed you? So you’re saying that I can only let you do whatever you want to me, and I can’t fight back?”</p><p>“How laughable. Lu Yao, let me tell you, you only have yourself to blame for everything.”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Lu Yao and said slowly. His voice was very calm, and one could not tell any emotional fluctuations. He was just stating a fact.</p><p>“He asked for it? You brought this upon yourself, hahaha!”</p><p>Lu Yao muttered to herself, then burst out laughing.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At that moment, two figures appeared beside Lu Ming. They were Qiu Yue and Xie nianqing.</p><p>After Lu Yao laughed, she calmed down and looked at Xie nianqing and Qiu Yue.</p><p>Qiu Yue and Xie nianqing, one in a white dress and the other in a black dress, stood in the air like a goddess.</p><p>Lu Yao had always prided herself on her beauty, but compared to Qiu Yue and Xie nianqing, she was still not as good.</p><p>In addition, Qiu Yue and Xie nianqing exuded a powerful aura. Standing beside Lu Ming, they looked like a celestial couple.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Yao’s heart was filled with complicated emotions.</p><p>There was regret, hatred, and envy.</p><p>She had brought this upon herself. Yes, Lu Ming was right. She had brought this upon herself.</p><p>All of this was caused by herself. If she had not thought so much in the past, looked down on Lu Ming, despised him, and even deprived him of his bloodline just because he was dispirited for a moment, and did not pursue geniuses and rich families, but stayed by Lu Ming’s side obediently, then the person who was envied by countless people would not be others but her.</p><p>At this moment, she truly understood the meaning of the phrase “don’t bully the young for being poor.”</p><p>People would always have their ups and downs.</p><p>However, the low point was only temporary. As long as he didn’t die, he would rise up eventually.</p><p>“I envy the prosperity and brilliance of others, but I ignore the brilliance and potential of the people around me. In the end, it’s all for nothing. Perhaps I was wrong!”</p><p>Lu Yao suddenly let out a long sigh.</p><p>Huhu ~</p><p>All of a sudden, the true energy in Lu Yao’s body went berserk, and streams of fiery red true energy rushed out of her body.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Then, Lu Yao’s body trembled and she spat out a mouthful of blood. Her aura rapidly weakened and she finally became like an ordinary person.</p><p>His cultivation was crippled!</p><p>In a short period of time, Lu Yao had gone through a great roller-coaster ride, and her mental state had also experienced a great roller-coaster ride, which actually led to the collapse of her mental state, causing her cultivation to be completely crippled.</p><p>Lu Yao lay limply on the ground, her eyes unfocused and filled with despair.</p><p>At that moment, the scenes from her journey to this place appeared in Lu Yao’s mind.</p><p>She suddenly realized that the three years that she spent with Lu Ming were the real happiness. Later on, she pursued more and it became more tiring.</p><p>After a long while, Lu Yao suddenly burst into tears. She looked at Lu Ming and said, ” “Lu Ming, I’m sorry!”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly sighed. one must always look at the side. Although the scenery in the distance is beautiful, it’s just an illusion. It’s like a dream. It’s not a bad thing that you’ll be an ordinary person in the future!</p><p>After that, Lu Ming called over an expert from the blood red Cavalry and instructed, ” “Take her to an ordinary village nearby and let her spend the rest of her life there!”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The blood red Cavalry accepted the order, picked up Lu Yao, and disappeared in a flash.</p><p>A gentle breeze blew past and a crystal-clear teardrop floated towards Lu Ming. Lu Ming opened his palm and the teardrop landed on it.</p><p>“This is good too!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>“What’s wrong? You can’t bear to part with your old lover?”</p><p>Xie nianqing pouted.</p><p>“Old lover?”</p><p>“Aren’t you my old lover?” Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Me? Bah! Who’s your old lover!”</p><p>Xie nianqing rolled his eyes at Lu Ming and said through gritted teeth.</p><p>However, her face was a little red.</p><p>Qiu Yue blinked her watery eyes and looked at Lu Ming and Xie nianqing. She smiled gently and did not say anything.</p><p>There was no longer any suspense in this battle.</p><p>In the end, the Duanmu family was almost completely annihilated, and the ten direction Sword School also suffered heavy losses. Only a small number of people managed to escape.</p><p>As for the dozens of experts that Yin tianjue had brought with him, all of them had been killed except for himself.</p><p>The five courtyards of the mystical sword sect were covered in ruins and corpses. The ground was dyed red with blood.</p><p>The atmosphere was heavy. Although the mystical sword sect had won this battle, they had also suffered heavy losses. It could be said that the mystical sword sect’s strength had dropped by a large margin after this battle.</p><p>Due to the Duanmu family’s betrayal, The White Tiger Hall was almost crippled.</p><p>Lu Ming was walking among the ruins.</p><p>“Marquis champion!”</p><p>“Marquis champion!”</p><p>The mystical sword sect’s disciples bowed respectfully when they saw Lu Ming.</p><p>Their hearts were filled with complicated feelings.</p><p>Initially, Lu Ming was just like them, a disciple of the mystical sword sect. However, things were different now.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming was the Marquis champion, and he was in control of the Army. His own strength was extremely powerful, and he had two half-step King Warriors under him. He had already become one of the overlords of the blazing sun Empire, an Overlord that could be on equal footing with Lin Xueyi.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded in response.</p><p>“Marquis champion!”</p><p>Lu Ming met Zhang Muyun in the Azure Dragon Hall. He was covered in blood and Zhuo yirong was by his side.</p><p>“Brother Zhang, you don’t have to be so polite!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>Lu Ming was happy for Zhang Muyun and Zhuo yirong.</p><p>Although Lu Ming did not have many interactions with the two of them, he still admired their character.</p><p>“Many people have died. Duan gang also died in battle.”</p><p>Zhang Muyun sighed, his voice filled with solemness and sadness.</p><p>“Is Duan gang dead?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>Duan gang was the number one genius among the bronze-level disciples of the Onyx tortoise Hall. He had once competed with them for a place on the bronze ranking. He was a very straightforward young man.</p><p>But now, he had died in battle.</p><p>After chatting with Zhang Muyun for a while, Lu Ming left the place. He walked around and arrived at the Vermillion Bird Hall.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>With a soft cry, Mu Lan walked toward Lu Ming leisurely, her eyes filled with joy.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had already returned to his true appearance, and everyone in the blood red Cavalry already knew his true identity.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
