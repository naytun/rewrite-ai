With your cultivation, you should be able to escape even if you can’t defeat anyone below the eighth level of the martial ancestor realm!</p><p>Huaying said.</p><p>However, his eyes were filled with worry.</p><p>Ever since they had completely submitted to Lu Ming, they would naturally think of Lu Ming in all aspects.</p><p>Ming Meng, Ming Cheng, and the rest were also anxious as they looked in the direction where Lu Ming and the rest had left.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At this moment, the ground began to rumble as if thousands of soldiers and horses were galloping.</p><p>Ming Meng’s expression suddenly changed. He shouted, ” not good, a large group of demonic beasts is coming. This is a beast tide. Listen to my orders, set up the formation and prepare for battle!</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the three thousand guards that Ming Meng had brought with him got into formation. They nocked their longbows and prepared for a bloody battle.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The shaking became more and more intense, as if there were many behemoths galloping.</p><p>Ming Meng and the others ‘expressions became more and more grave.</p><p>OWW! Awooo!</p><p>At this moment, a deafening wolf howl could be heard from the depths of the plateau, piercing through the clouds.</p><p>“Not good, that’s the cry of a bloodred scaled Wolf. Why are there so many of them? Where are brother tianyun and the others?”</p><p>Ming Meng roared.</p><p>The others ‘expressions also changed. From the sound, they didn’t know how many bloodscaled wolves there were, but they were sure that they didn’t have enough people. How were they going to fight?</p><p>retreat, retreat! Let’s rush back to Full Moon City first!</p><p>Ming Meng roared.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>One by one, they turned their horses around and charged back.</p><p>“Ah? That’s the general and miss Xie nianqing!”</p><p>Suddenly, a loud shout rang out. It came from a youth from the star cluster Hall.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Ming Meng and the others hurriedly looked over.</p><p>At the end of the earth, a boundless red appeared. From a distance, it looked like a fiery red sunset.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, it was not a sunset glow, but a group of robust bloodred scaled wolves.</p><p>As far as the eye could see, the ground was filled with bloodred scaled wolves, covering the sky and covering the earth. An extremely dense murderous aura filled the air.</p><p>Some of the more timid people’s legs started to tremble.</p><p>In front of the boundless Crimson scaled wolves, there were two of the tallest Crimson scaled wolves, and their auras soared to the sky.</p><p>A person sat on each of the Scarlet blood beasts.</p><p>They were Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>“It really is brother tianyun and Lady Xie, but what’s going on? Why are the two of them riding on the Crimson scaled Wolf?”</p><p>Ming Meng was dumbfounded.</p><p>“Could it be that the general and the others are being chased by the Crimson scaled Wolf?”</p><p>“Impossible? The general and the others are riding on two Crimson scaled wolves, and they seem to have the strongest auras, but they didn’t resist. Could it be that the general and the others have already tamed the Crimson scaled wolves?”</p><p>“Tamed? That’s impossible, right?”</p><p>Hua Ying and the other young experts were discussing.</p><p>OWW! OWW!</p><p>At this moment, the bloodscaled Wolf King that Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were riding on let out two howls. Immediately, the bloodscaled wolves that covered the entire mountain slowed down. In the end, they strolled slowly towards Ming Meng and the rest.</p><p>“This Gu, this Gu is the bloodred scaled Wolf King? Could it be that the bloodred scaled Wolf King has been tamed? how is that possible?”</p><p>Ming Meng’s eyes and mouth were wide open, his face full of disbelief.</p><p>As for those who were originally from the Moonview city, their eyes and mouths were also wide open as they looked on in a daze.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were already not far away.</p><p>“Brother tianyun, you’ve tamed these two bloodscaled Wolf Kings?”</p><p>Ming Meng asked in a daze.</p><p>haha, big brother Ming Meng, we were lucky to have succeeded. We chased the two wolves from before, but we didn’t expect to chase them all the way to the lair of the Crimson scaled wolves. We encountered these two scaled Wolf Kings and were lucky to have successfully tamed them, so we got the wolf King to give the order to bring this entire nest of Crimson scaled wolves here.</p><p>Lu Ming explained.</p><p>“Zhenzhen was lucky?”</p><p>Ming Meng’s lips trembled as he tugged at his beard. Even now, he was still in shock, as if he was in a dream.</p><p>The 3,000 guards he had brought with him were not any better. They all thought they were dreaming.</p><p>Taming the bloodscaled Wolf King? However, he had never heard of anyone succeeding.</p><p>But now, Lu Ming had succeeded the moment he came and even brought back a den of Crimson scaled wolves.</p><p>big brother tianyun is invincible!</p><p>Ming Feng reacted quickly. He shouted and ran to Lu Ming’s side.”Big brother tianyun, can you give me a bloodred scaled wolf as a Mount?”</p><p>After a few days of struggle, the three Ming siblings decided to be friends with Lu Ming on their own, regardless of how their father and Lu Ming addressed each other. Otherwise, they would really have to call Lu Ming uncle.</p><p>“Of course you can, you can choose one yourself!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>thank you, big brother tianyun!</p><p>Ming Feng was overjoyed. He immediately picked a class 6 third level bloodscale Wolf and rode it.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>As soon as Ming Feng mounted it, the bloodred scaled Wolf let out a furious roar.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming patted the wolf King he was riding on. The wolf King let out a loud roar and immediately, the bloodred scaled Wolf became obedient and whimpered. Ren Mingfeng rode on it.</p><p>“Haha, let’s go!”</p><p>Ming Feng patted the Crimson scaled Wolf. The Crimson scaled Wolf immediately howled and rushed out like the wind. After a while, it ran back.</p><p>“Haha, cool, this is too cool!”</p><p>Ming Feng laughed.</p><p>This made the others unable to stand it.</p><p>“General, give this general one!”</p><p>Huaying shouted.</p><p>“General, I also want one!”</p><p>The other young men called out.</p><p>“You guys can choose!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand.</p><p>Huaying and the others were overjoyed.</p><p>The few of them were all martial arts grandmasters, so they naturally picked the level four ones.</p><p>Huaying picked a fourth grade fourth level beast, which was equivalent to a fourth grade martial Grandmaster.</p><p>The others had also picked suitable ones.</p><p>For a time, the howls of wolves could be heard continuously. Red light leaped across the grassland as they tried out their newly obtained mounts.</p><p>this is so cool! This is a real Mount! With such a Mount, killing enemies is as easy as taking something out of my pocket!</p><p>Huaying and the others laughed.</p><p>Ming Meng looked on with envy.</p><p>With his status, he was too embarrassed to ask Lu Ming for it.</p><p>“Big brother Ming Meng, this one is for you!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand, and a tall and burly Crimson scaled Wolf stepped forward, exuding a powerful aura.</p><p>It was a class 5 Lv 4 bloodscale Wolf, second only to the two Wolf Kings.</p><p>“Brother tianyun, how can I accept this?”</p><p>Although he said he was embarrassed, his eyes were already fixed on the bloodred scaled Wolf, unable to move away.</p><p>“Big brother Ming Meng, why are you being so polite with me? Take it and ride it!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Alright, then I won’t stand on ceremony!”</p><p>Ming Meng was overjoyed and hurriedly jumped onto the Crimson scaled Wolf. He controlled the Crimson scaled Wolf to run a big circle, the smile on his face so thick it couldn’t be dispersed.</p><p>“Let’s go back to the camp!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands and said.</p><p>At once, more than eight thousand Crimson scaled wolves followed Lu Ming and the rest in a grandiose manner, heading toward the Moonview city’s military camp.</p><p>Along the way, Ming Meng’s 3000 guards looked at the Crimson scaled Wolf with envy.</p><p>However, they knew that they belonged to the mountain suppressing Army and not Lu Ming. They would definitely not get a share.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
