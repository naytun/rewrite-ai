Hundreds of pairs of eyes looked at Lu Ming in unison.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s you?”</p><p>Young master Tian she, LAN Yundao, and the rest could not help but exclaim in shock when they saw Lu Ming.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, I don’t know if you’re stupid. You actually dared to walk out on your own. I really admire your intelligence. But this is good. It saves us the trouble of looking for you.”</p><p>LAN Yundao’s face was filled with ecstasy.</p><p>“Little bastard, are you here to beg for mercy? It’s too late to beg for mercy now. How about this, if you agree to be my dog for 20 years, I can plead with the heaven’s favorites of the thousand River region to spare your dog life!”</p><p>Autumn water also sneered.</p><p>The way he looked at Lu Ming was extremely cold and vicious. He could not wait to tear Lu Ming into a thousand pieces.</p><p>He had thought that Lu Ming had come out to beg for mercy. However, how could he agree so easily? he wanted to humiliate Lu Ming before killing him.</p><p>“Where did these idiots come from?”</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at LAN Yun indifferently. He glanced at autumn water and the rest and said indifferently, ”</p><p>This sentence, coupled with Lu Ming’s disdainful expression, almost made LAN Yundao and Li qiushui’s mouths twist in anger.</p><p>“You’re looking for death, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>Li qiushui roared.</p><p>“Lu Ming, leave quickly and escape. You must expose the shameless acts of young master Tian she, LAN Yundao, and the rest to the public. Don’t let the world be deceived by them!”</p><p>Jian Fengyun shouted.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>Young master Tian she, LAN Yundao, and the others ‘expressions changed drastically. Their actions must never be spread out. Otherwise, there would be no place for them in the cloud Emperor mountain range.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Young master Tian she, LAN Yundao, Ji rufeng, yang Liuji, and the rest moved and pounced on Lu Ming.</p><p>However, there was a faint smile on Lu Ming’s face. He stood there without moving.</p><p>Shadows flickered. Young master Tian she and the rest of the group surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>“Hahaha, let’s see where you can run to now!”</p><p>Young master Tian she sneered.</p><p>“AI!”</p><p>Seeing this, Jian Fengyun let out a long sigh. His eyes were filled with despair.</p><p>Lu Ming was surrounded. No one would spread the news of the despicable behavior of young master Tian she and the rest.</p><p>Was the Cloud King Mountain range going to fall into the hands of these people and be controlled by the thousand rivers?</p><p>Jian Fengyun couldn’t accept this.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you managed to escape last time. Let’s see how you can escape this time!”</p><p>LAN Yundao looked at Lu Ming with a cold smile.</p><p>“Oh? Do you think I won’t slap you to death if you do?”</p><p>Lu Ming cast a glance at LAN Yundao and said.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t be so arrogant. Watch how I kill you!”</p><p>LAN Yundao shouted with a confident expression.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A powerful aura rose from LAN Yundao’s body.</p><p>Early stage of martial ancestor 7-dan!</p><p>During this period of time, LAN Yundao’s cultivation had made another breakthrough. He had reached the early stage of the 7th level of martial ancestor realm. No wonder he was so confident.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, die! I’ll kill you as easily as killing a chicken!”</p><p>LAN Yundao laughed out loud. Blue light burst out from his body and a dazzling saber radiance slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>He was indeed much stronger than before.</p><p>The people of the thousand River region sneered and gloated.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not move in the face of such a saber gleam.</p><p>“Don’t tell me that he was shocked by LAN Yundao’s breakthrough!”</p><p>Young master Tian she chuckled.</p><p>“Die, Lu Ming! Die!”</p><p>Yang Liuji growled. He was about to see Lu Ming die in front of him, and he felt extremely comfortable.</p><p>Ever since he had met Lu Ming in the remains of the cloud Emperor Palace, he had been suppressed by Lu Ming in every way. He had been hoping that Lu Ming would die at all times.</p><p>Now, it was finally going to come true.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The blue Saber Light looked like it was condensed from blue gemstones. It was crystal clear, resplendent, and powerful. It was about to land on Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming moved!</p><p>To everyone’s shock, he actually slapped out.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A palm landed on the blue blade light. The blue blade light burst like a fragile bubble. Then, the palm did not stop and continued to slap toward LAN Yundao’s face.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>A crisp sound rang out and LAN Yundao let out a blood-curdling screech. His body spun a few dozen times in the air under the force of the slap before he fell heavily to the ground.</p><p>“F * ck me, f * ck me!”</p><p>LAN Yundao glared at Lu Ming, his eyes filled with disbelief. The next moment, with a plop, LAN Yundao’s body was torn into pieces and his blood flowed all over the ground.</p><p>He was dead! LAN Yundao was dead. He was slapped to death by Lu Ming.</p><p>“This … This …”</p><p>Young master Tian she, yang Liuji, Yan feixun, and Li qiushui’s eyes were as big as eggs, and their mouths were so wide open that they could swallow a dead rat.</p><p>“How is that possible? You’re cheating, you’re definitely cheating!”</p><p>After a while, yang Liuji reacted and shouted hysterically.</p><p>LAN Yundao, who was many times more powerful than him, was killed by Lu Ming with one slap. How could Lu Ming be so powerful? He found it hard to accept.</p><p>On the other side, the Jade God seal youth, the blue-robed youth, and the other geniuses from the thousand River region also became serious.</p><p>you’re just an ant. You’re so annoying, making a fuss all day. I’ll send you to accompany him!</p><p>Lu Ming cast a cold glance at yang Liuji.</p><p>“Don’t!” Yang Liuji was shocked and quickly retreated.</p><p>But-</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>&Nbsp; a spear light shot out and pierced through yang Liuji’s throat.</p><p>Yang Liuji clutched his throat tightly, his eyes filled with unwillingness. In the end, he fell to the ground, not breathing.</p><p>“Now, it’s your turn.”</p><p>Lu Ming turned his gaze to young master Tian she, Yan feixun, and the rest.</p><p>The expressions of young master Tian she and the others changed drastically.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t be so arrogant. The geniuses of the thousand River region are here. They won’t tolerate you!”</p><p>Young master Tian she shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength made his heart tremble.</p><p>Although he was more powerful than LAN Yundao, he could not kill him with one slap. Lu Ming’s combat strength was definitely above his.</p><p>kill him! I have to kill him with the thousand River waters. Otherwise, there will be another Jian Fengyun and the cloud Emperor mountain range. I won’t be able to stand out anymore!</p><p>Young master Tian she roared in his heart. He looked at Lu Ming, his heart filled with jealousy.</p><p>“Thousand rivers? They won’t be able to leave!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>However, his words caused an uproar among the people in the thousand River region.</p><p>“What? What did this kid mean? Do you think he’s going to spare our lives?”</p><p>what an arrogant brat. You’re really a frog at the bottom of a well. You think you’re invincible just because you have some skills!</p><p>this brat deserves to die. He dared to talk back to us even before he entered the eastern nether ancient battlefield. We can’t let him live in this world!</p><p>…</p><p>A cold voice came from the thousand River.</p><p>Even Jian Fengyun was stunned. He did not know what Lu Ming’s intention was.</p><p>However, young master Tian she, Yan feixun, and the others were overjoyed.</p><p>Lu Ming was really stupid to be so arrogant. They did not need to do anything now. The paragons of the thousand River region would definitely not let him off.</p><p>As expected-</p><p>“I’ll kill you!”</p><p>A purple-clad young man strode out with a lightning-like gaze.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
