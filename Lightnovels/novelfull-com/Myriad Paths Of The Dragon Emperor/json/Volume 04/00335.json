We’re in the North, not far from the ghost moon saber sect. We’re afraid that the ten direction Sword School will make a move on us, so we’re so heavily guarded.”</p><p>...</p><p>Huaying explained.</p><p>“The ghostmoon saber sect has been exterminated, and the Army of the yin Yue Empire has moved South and occupied a large area of the burning sun Empire’s territory. I guess this is the benefit that the ten directional sword sect has promised the yin Yue Empire. They’re really a bunch of traitors.”</p><p>Ming Meng said through gritted teeth.</p><p>has the ten direction sword sect made any new moves during this time? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Not yet!”</p><p>Huaying said.</p><p>keep an eye on the news from the outside world. The ten direction sword sect’s move has shaken the entire country. The other sects will definitely not remain indifferent. They will definitely join forces. This is not good news for the ten direction sword sect. Therefore, the ten direction sword sect will definitely make a big move next.</p><p>Lu Ming analyzed.</p><p>At this moment, Ming Meng’s expression changed slightly. He moved his hand and a Jade tablet appeared.</p><p>This was a ten-thousand-mile sound transmission talisman, and most generals would have one in their hands to transmit messages.</p><p>When Ming Meng saw the message from the ten thousand mile sound transmission talisman, his body trembled violently, and his face instantly became extremely pale, without a trace of blood.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>Ming Meng roared, his eyes filled with disbelief.</p><p>“Brother Ming, what happened?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked hurriedly, but he had a bad feeling in his heart.</p><p>the Heavenly King of suppression revolted and led the Army to break into the capital and raze the palace. His Majesty the Emperor was killed.</p><p>Ming Meng was practically trembling as he called out.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Ming Meng’s words were like a bolt of lightning on a clear day. It rang in the hearts of most of the people present, including Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming, Hua Ying, and the rest turned pale.</p><p>“Heavenly King suppression, ten direction Sword School!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared, his killing intent surging like a tide.</p><p>Heavenly King Zhen couldn’t have done this alone. Without thinking, the one controlling everything was definitely the ten direction Sword School.</p><p>“Traitor, traitor, how dare the Heavenly King, this traitor? How dare he?”</p><p>Huaying shouted hysterically, her eyes red.</p><p>He was a member of the imperial family, and he almost went crazy.</p><p>Heavenly King Zhen Tian’s banner is to get rid of the fatuous ruler and build a strong and powerful burning sun Empire. Haha, how shameless, how shameless.</p><p>Ming Meng laughed from extreme anger.</p><p>“Father, mother!”</p><p>The first people that came to Lu Ming’s mind were Lu Yuntian and Li Ping.</p><p>How were Lu Yuntian and Li Ping doing in the general Star Hall?</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming was burning with anxiety.</p><p>“Young master, young master, old master and Madam?”</p><p>At the side, Qiu Yue clutched Lu Ming’s arm tightly. Her entire body trembled slightly and she was extremely worried.</p><p>“Brother Ming, is there any more news? Did anyone from the imperial family survive?”</p><p>Lu Ming forced himself to calm down.</p><p>It had already happened, so there was no point in worrying. Only by getting more information could he decide what to do next.</p><p>“According to the news, Heavenly King Zhen Tian actually attacked. His Majesty and the experts of the royal family fought back with all their might, and in the end, the eighth prince managed to escape with a group of people. However, after the eighth prince and his group escaped from the Imperial City, there was no news of them at all.”</p><p>Ming Meng said.</p><p>“Hua Chi, Hua Chi has escaped.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he had a glimmer of hope.</p><p>If it was possible, Hua Chi would have definitely brought Lu Yuntian and Li Ping with him when he escaped. That way, Lu Yuntian and Li Ping might still be fine.</p><p>“Ten direction sword sect, if anything happens to my parents, I swear I’ll kill all of you!”</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists tightly. His eyes were filled with endless cold killing intent.</p><p>“Lord Marquis, what should we do now? From now on, the entire mountain suppressing Army will listen to Lord Marquis’s orders!”</p><p>Ming Meng cupped his fists and knelt on one knee.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not decline and agreed immediately.</p><p>In terms of rank, the Marquis champion was higher than Ming Meng, so it was normal for him to lead the mountain suppressing Army.</p><p>“All generals, hear my order!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment and began to give orders.</p><p>“Lord Marquis, please give your orders!”</p><p>Hua Ying, Ming Meng, and the others all knelt on one knee.</p><p>“Full Moon City is located in the North. To the North is the yinyue Empire, and to the South is the Shifang Sword School. It’s very disadvantageous for us, so we shouldn’t stay for long.”</p><p>Ming Meng, lead the mountain-guarding Army to the East and head to the forgotten immortal pass. The forgotten immortal pass is easy to defend and hard to attack. It’s a natural stronghold and has always been under the command of the royal family. We will never ally ourselves with the ten direction sword sect.</p><p>moreover, after we reach the forgotten immortal pass, we can form a corner with the mystical sword sect and join forces with them to resist the ten directions sword sect.</p><p>Lu Ming instructed.</p><p>He knew that the blazing sun Empire was about to fall into chaos, and a Great War was about to break out.</p><p>“Your subordinate obeys!”</p><p>Ming Meng said.</p><p>“In addition, 30000 blood red Cavalry, come with me to the imperial capital and save the eighth prince!”</p><p>Lu Ming ordered, his eyes filled with killing intent.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Huaying and the others acknowledged the order loudly, their killing intent soaring.</p><p>“Lord Marquis, you can’t. There are many experts in the Shi Fang sword sect. This trip is too dangerous.”</p><p>Ming Meng’s expression changed drastically as he opposed.</p><p>Although the blood red Cavalry were strong, they could only charge and break through enemy lines. If the omnipresent sword sect sent a top expert to assassinate Lu Ming, it would be dangerous.</p><p>The others also hesitated.</p><p>it’s fine. I’ll kill anyone from the ten direction sword sect I see!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Just then, a loud rumble came from outside.</p><p>“Report, there’s a large Army coming from outside!”</p><p>A soldier came to report.</p><p>it must be the ten directions Sword School. The ten directions Sword School is finally here. I knew they wouldn’t leave a nail like us here.</p><p>Ming Meng’s expression changed.</p><p>“Good, blood red iron cavalry, follow me to kill the enemy!”</p><p>Lu Ming ordered.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Huaying and the others accepted the order.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming rode the bloodscaled Wolf King, followed by Xie nianqing, Qiu Yue, the Golden-eyed blood corpse, Yan Quan, Hua Ying, Ming Meng, and the rest. He led thirty thousand blood red Cavalry out of the camp and arrived outside Moonview city.</p><p>In front of him, dust filled the air as a majestic Army appeared in sight.</p><p>Black warhorses, black armor, black weapons, and a flood of pitch-black steel surged through the world.</p><p>A huge flag with a divine sword embroidered on it fluttered in the wind.</p><p>that’s the ghost moon saber sect’s ghost metal army. It seems like the ghost metal army has already joined the ten direction Sword School.</p><p>Ming Meng’s expression changed.</p><p>That flag was the flag of the ten direction sword sect.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. The ghost moon saber sect had been annihilated. It was normal for some of the legions under the ghost moon saber sect to join the omnidirectional sword sect.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The ghost metal army stopped a few miles away. They had a strong aura and were densely packed. Judging from their numbers, there should be no less than 100000 people.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A few figures flew out from the ghost metal army and hovered above Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>There were a total of three people, one old man and two middle-aged men. They all carried swords on their backs and were obviously experts from the ten direction Sword School.</p><p>The three of them exuded extremely powerful auras.</p><p>“One is at the peak of the eighth level of the martial ancestor realm, and two are at the peak of the seventh level!”</p><p>Ming Meng cried out in alarm, his expression extremely ugly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
