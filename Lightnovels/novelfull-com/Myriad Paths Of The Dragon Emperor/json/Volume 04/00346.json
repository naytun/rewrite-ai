With a loud cry, he died unwillingly.</p><p>“Not good, let’s go!”</p><p>Seeing that Duanmu canghai had been killed, Qiu Wuyang let out a long howl and turned to leave.</p><p>“Qiu Wuyang, you can stay here today!”</p><p>die! Lin Xueyi roared as she charged at Qiu Wuyang with her sword. The dazzling sword Qi filled the void and blocked Qiu Wuyang’s way out.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Yan Quan and the Golden-eyed blood corpse flashed and appeared on the other two sides of Qiu Wuyang.</p><p>Qiu Wuyang’s face was gloomy and his eyes were filled with anxiety.</p><p>damn it, damn it! I can’t believe I’ve fallen into such a situation today. I never thought that this tianyun, no, Lu Ming, would have two half step King Warriors with him. It’s all Lu Ming’s fault! Damn it!</p><p>Qiu Wuyang kept roaring in his heart as he rolled his eyes, trying to think of a solution.</p><p>With Duanmu canghai’s death, the only half-step King Warriors on their side were him, Yin tianjue, and another expert from the ten direction Sword School.</p><p>On the mystic essence sword sect’s side, there was Lin Xueyi, a half step King, Shangguan Ming, Yan Quan, and the Golden-eyed blood corpse.</p><p>In terms of peak combat strength, they were already at a complete disadvantage. They could only retreat for now. Otherwise, they would all have to stay here.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>On the other side, Yin tianjue and Shangguan Ming exchanged a blow. He roared and called for the powerful cultivators he had brought with him, planning to escape.</p><p>“Yin tianjue, let’s settle this today. Where are you going?”</p><p>Seeing that Yin tianjue was about to leave, Yan Quan gave a loud roar and abandoned Qiu Wuyang to charge towards Yin tianjue.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Yin tianjue howled in anger as he burst forth with all his might.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As soon as Yan Quan left, Qiu Wuyang’s sword Qi soared into the sky. The Battle Sword in his hand slashed out, its sharpness unparalleled.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Even the powerful golden-eyed blood corpse was sent flying thousands of meters.</p><p>Qiu Wuyang seized the opportunity and was about to run away. However, on the other side, another sharp sword Qi was coming at him. It was Lin Xueyi.</p><p>“Qiu Wuyang, you won’t be able to escape.”</p><p>Lin Xueyi’s voice was cold.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang roared and fought back with all his might. However, after a few moves, he was already spitting out blood.</p><p>OWW! …</p><p>At this moment, the howls of wolves could be heard from the distant land.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The earth rumbled as countless bloodred scaled wolves charged over.</p><p>Lu Ming’s Red blood cavalry had arrived.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The blood red Cavalry roared and charged at the Army of the ten direction sword sect.</p><p>The omnipresent sword sect immediately sent out a powerful Army to stop the blood red Cavalry.</p><p>Although this Army was very strong and was the elite of the ten direction Sword School, it was not enough to face the blood red Cavalry.</p><p>The red blood cavalry was armed to the teeth. What they wore and what they held in their hands were all the best items that Lu Ming had taken from the martial King’s storage ring.</p><p>Together with the Crimson scaled Wolf, they were an Army that was born for war.</p><p>After a few charges, the Army of the ten direction sword sect was scattered.</p><p>The blood red Cavalry charged past, leaving corpses everywhere and blood flowing like a river.</p><p>Qiu Wuyang, your plan today is destined to fail. It’s impossible for the ten direction sword sect to rule the burning sun Empire!</p><p>Lin Xueyi glared at Qiu Wuyang.</p><p>Qiu Wuyang’s face was extremely dark and his eyes were filled with anger. He didn’t say anything as he tried to block Lin Xueyi and the Golden-eyed blood corpse’s attacks while looking for an opportunity to escape.</p><p>“Sect leader, let me help you!”</p><p>At this time, a loud roar was heard. A tall figure rushed over and exchanged a blow with the Golden-eyed blood corpse.</p><p>This person was the other half-step King of the ten direction Sword School.</p><p>“I’m your opponent!”</p><p>The half-step King from the mystical sword sect had also caught up.</p><p>sect leader, run! The ten direction sword sect can’t do without you. Leave this to me!</p><p>The half step King from the ten direction Sword School roared. His body emitted a strong purple light, and his originally tall body expanded again.</p><p>he’s burning his blood essence. He’s going to risk his life. Stop him!</p><p>Lin Xueyi shouted.</p><p>“Kill! Kill! Kill!”</p><p>The half-step King from the ten direction Sword School roared and slashed out three times.</p><p>The power of these three swords was beyond imagination, infinitely close to the attack power of a King.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood corpse, Lin Xueyi, and the half-step King from the mystic essence sword sect were all sent flying thousands of meters away.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Qiu Wuyang seized the opportunity and turned into a beam of light, disappearing into the horizon in a few breaths.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Lin Xueyi, I, Qiu Wuyang, will exterminate your entire family sooner or later!”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang’s murderous voice came from the distance.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>On the other side, Yin Tian Jue used some kind of secret technique and lost an arm to fight back Yan Quan and Shangguan Ming’s encirclement. He turned into a blood light and rushed out, disappearing into the horizon.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi roared as she turned her attention to the ten direction Sword school’s half step King.</p><p>Although he had burned his blood essence and increased his combat strength, he couldn’t last long. His blood essence was exhausted and he was torn into pieces by the Golden-eyed blood corpse.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed and appeared in the air. Looking at the corpse of the ten direction sword sect’s demi King, Lu Ming sighed in pity.</p><p>The other party’s blood essence had already been exhausted.</p><p>This was a half-step King. The energy contained in its blood essence was absolutely terrifying. To Lu Ming, it was a Supreme treasure.</p><p>Furthermore, the blood essence of a half-step King was extremely condensed, and its essence dissipated very slowly. Any Jade bottle could store it for a very long time.</p><p>Previously, Duanmu canghai’s blood essence had already been stored in a Jade bottle by Lu Ming. He could keep it for later consumption and refinement.</p><p>After taking a look at his surroundings, Lu Ming wiped his face with his hand and transformed back into tianyun.</p><p>“Blood red iron cavalry, hear my order. Kill the people of the ten direction sword sect without mercy!”</p><p>Lu Ming gave the order heartlessly, his voice spreading far and wide.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The blood red Cavalry roared, their killing intent soaring to the heavens.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted as well. He wielded his spear and charged at the martial arts Grandmaster from the omnidirectional sword sect.</p><p>At the same time, the Golden-eyed blood corpse, Yan Quan, Lin Xueyi, and the other half-step Kings also charged toward the ten direction Sword School.</p><p>With so many half-step Kings joining in, it was simply a massacre.</p><p>Screams of pain and agony filled the air as a large number of experts were killed.</p><p>“Run, quickly run!”</p><p>The people from the ten directions Sword School didn’t have the heart to continue fighting. Even their sect leader had escaped, and the other party had so many terrifying experts. Staying behind to fight was simply an act of courting death.</p><p>One by one, they began to flee from the mystical sword sect.</p><p>The attack of the ten direction Sword School this time could be considered a complete failure.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming was on a killing spree. With a wave of his long spear, a few experts from the Duanmu family were killed.</p><p>Lu Ming had his eyes on the Duanmu family.</p><p>In fact, it was the same for the other people in the mystical sword sect. They were also targeting the Duanmu family.</p><p>Even if the people from the ten direction Sword School were to escape, they could not let the people from the Duanmu family off.</p><p>Betrayer, only death!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
