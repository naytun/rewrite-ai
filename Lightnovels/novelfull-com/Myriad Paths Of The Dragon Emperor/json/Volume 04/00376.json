BOOM!</p><p>...</p><p>At this moment, a few terrifying auras filled the air, as deep as the ocean.</p><p>Everyone was shocked. They looked up and saw four figures above the countless stone peaks.</p><p>These four figures stood in four different directions.</p><p>Each figure was shining with a bright light, gold, red, or blue.</p><p>It was impossible to see his real body clearly, but his aura was simply too shocking.</p><p>“A King, it’s a king!”</p><p>“The king has appeared. The entrance to the eastern nether ancient battlefield is about to open.”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>The tense atmosphere between Lu Ming and the rest and the geniuses of the thousand River region also eased.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The four King tiers made their moves. One after another, dazzling beams of light shot out from their hands, entering the many stone peaks.</p><p>At this moment, countless stone peaks glowed, and countless runes flickered.</p><p>kid, you’d better hand over those treasures. Otherwise, even if I don’t kill you now, you’ll definitely die when you enter the eastern nether ancient battlefield!</p><p>Autumn water looked at Lu Ming with a cold gaze.</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips and ignored him.</p><p>Autumn water’s face turned red.</p><p>“Junior Brother li, why are you talking so much to him? Once you enter the eastern nether ancient battlefield, just kill him directly. Not only do you have to kill him, but you also have to kill everyone from the cloud Emperor mountain range that you see until they give in!”</p><p>Jiang Chun sneered.</p><p>that’s right. It’s just what I want. It’s time to let these barbarian-like things know our power!</p><p>The handsome young man also sneered.</p><p>Hearing this, all the geniuses in the cloud Emperor mountain range changed their expressions.</p><p>There were so many people in the thousand River region and countless geniuses. If they really attacked them, their trip to the ancient battlefield of the netherworld would be in danger.</p><p>“Damn it. It’s all Lu Ming’s fault!”</p><p>Yang Liuji growled in his heart. His combat power was not strong, and if he encountered an expert from the thousand River waters, he would probably be in trouble.</p><p>“You guys go ahead!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>hehe, let’s wait and see in the eastern nether ancient battlefield!</p><p>Zhao sui sneered and flew to the side.</p><p>The geniuses of the thousand River region looked at them with hostility, then followed Zhao sui and flew to the side.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the light from the countless stone peaks became even more resplendent. Countless runes appeared and gathered in the sky, gradually forming a large array.</p><p>“Open!”</p><p>The four kings roared in unison.</p><p>Suddenly, the array condensed and a Black Vortex appeared in the sky.</p><p>This vortex was extremely huge, covering the endless stone peaks.</p><p>“Is this the entrance to the ancient battlefield of the netherworld? This is too big!”</p><p>Countless people were dumbfounded.</p><p>alright, the eastern nether ancient battlefield is open. You can enter now!</p><p>A majestic voice came from one of the Kings.</p><p>“Let’s go in!”</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Immediately, the dense crowd flew toward the vortex.</p><p>remember, try your best to enter together. That way, when you arrive at the ancient battlefield of the netherworld, it is more likely that you will be teleported to a similar distance!</p><p>Lu Xiu ordered.</p><p>Everyone nodded, and the group of ninety-eight people rushed toward the vortex.</p><p>As soon as they rushed into the vortex, they felt that the world was spinning. Lu Ming and the rest had disappeared without a trace.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>…</p><p>Lu Ming began to feel dizzy. The next moment, he heard earth-shattering shouts.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes swept across the room and his pupils contracted sharply. He was shocked.</p><p>In front of him, in the sky, there were countless figures criss-crossing each other, and the smell of blood permeated the air.</p><p>There was a fierce battle going on here.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There was a giant hand that covered the sky, a sword Qi that cut across the universe, a spear radiance that pierced through the heaven and earth, and a flame that burned everything.</p><p>Strong, he was too strong.</p><p>Countless unimaginable experts were fighting. The entire world was torn apart.</p><p>One by one, the powerful experts were killed, and their corpses fell to the ground like dumplings.</p><p>“What’s going on? Where is this place?”</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely shocked.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>All of a sudden, a ray of sword light slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The sword gleam seemed to have come from the depths of the universe. The space was torn apart and it was extremely terrifying. Lu Ming’s strength was as insignificant as dust in front of this sword gleam.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl. He was not willing to be killed just like that. He wanted to resist with all his might.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>He felt his vision go black, and the next moment, he opened his eyes.</p><p>The gentle breeze and the fragrance of flowers assailed his nose.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that he was standing on a grassland that was full of wildflowers.</p><p>The terrifying battlefield had disappeared without a trace.</p><p>“Was everything just an illusion? This place is called the ancient battlefield of the netherworld. Perhaps it’s just a reflection of the real scene from back then.”</p><p>Lu Ming made a guess.</p><p>Perhaps everyone who had just entered would have seen that scene.</p><p>It was formed by an immortal fighting spirit that flowed between heaven and earth. Even time would not be able to decay it.</p><p>“This ancient battlefield is probably not simple. According to the records, the ancient battlefield of the netherworld is just a corner of another ancient battlefield. It’s separated from the original world and has been refined by the experts of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>At this moment, his expression changed, and a ten thousand mile sound transmission talisman appeared in his hand.</p><p>There was a piece of news that came from Jian Fengyun. He had gathered everyone in the Cloud King Mountain range.</p><p>it’s in the North. Since it can be received through the ten thousand mile sound transmission talisman, it means that it’s within ten thousand miles. Let’s go and take a look!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>He intended to act alone, but since it wasn’t far, there was no harm in taking a look.</p><p>He rose into the air and headed north.</p><p>The distance of less than ten thousand miles was covered in a moment.</p><p>There were already dozens of people gathered by a small lake.</p><p>All of them were geniuses from the cloud Emperor mountain range.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming arrived, everyone’s eyes were on him.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, a few figures flashed and surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>It was LAN Yundao, Yan feixun, yang Liuji, and a few others.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you actually dare to gather here. You’re really looking for death!”</p><p>it’s not easy to kill you outside, but I don’t have such concerns in the eastern nether ancient battlefield!</p><p>LAN Yun said. The voices of Yan feixun and the others were extremely cold.</p><p>“You want to kill me with just you trash? What a joke!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and he smiled faintly.</p><p>Lu Ming, don’t think that just because you scored higher than me in the preliminaries, you are more powerful than me. Now, I’ll let you know how powerful I am!</p><p>“Divine sun fist!”</p><p>Yan feixun let out a long howl. His fist glowed as he threw a punch. A dazzling sun appeared and shot towards Lu Ming.</p><p>The power was several times stronger than yang Liuji’s fist of the great sun.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming was very direct. He swept his long spear and fused the power of wind and Fire.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Yan feixun’s sun fist force was like a small flame that was extinguished. The spear radiance didn’t stop and continued to bombard Yan feixun’s body.</p><p>Yan feixun screamed and flew out like a cannonball for a thousand meters. He coughed up blood and his face was pale. His eyes were full of horror.</p><p>“You still dare to say you’re amazing?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
