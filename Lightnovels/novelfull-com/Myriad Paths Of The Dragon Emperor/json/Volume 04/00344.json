That’s a half-step King!</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>Many people were shocked. They did not expect that Lu Ming would have a half-step King following him.</p><p>“Who are you, Sir?”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang’s face turned serious.</p><p>Half-step Kings were all extremely famous and were the overlords of their own territories.</p><p>He was very clear about the appearance of each of them, but he didn’t know Yan Quan.</p><p>“Who am I? There’s no harm in saying it, I am Yan Quan!”</p><p>Yan Quan parted his mouth and smiled.</p><p>“What? You are Yan Quan? Then this little bastard is the one who destroyed the mo family and killed my son.”</p><p>As soon as Yan Quan finished speaking, Yin tianjue roared and looked at Lu Ming with a dark expression.</p><p>During this period of time, he had sent people to investigate thoroughly, but they could not find the murderer at all. They only knew that Yan Quan had escaped.</p><p>Now that the flame spring had appeared here, the answer was already obvious.</p><p>“Yin tianjue, what’s your name? Your Dark Moon imperial family is despicable and shameless. Today, I will settle this with you!”</p><p>Yan Quan looked at Yin tianjue with killing intent. He took a step forward and stood opposite Qiu Wuyang and the rest.</p><p>The auras of the six half-step Kings formed a huge domain that prevented anyone below the half-step King level from approaching.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming looked at Duanmu Lin and smiled faintly.”Duanmu Lin, I’ve just said that you don’t have the chance to rise again. You’ll die today!”</p><p>tianyun, if you and I fight, both of us will suffer. I advise you to join the ten direction Sword School. Now that the school has formed its power, even if you have a half-step King protecting you, it won’t be able to affect the overall situation.</p><p>Duanmu Lin said as he stared at Lu Ming.</p><p>With tianyun’s reputation right there, unless it was absolutely necessary, he was not willing to exchange blows with him.</p><p>“Both sides are injured? You? You really think too highly of yourself!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a mocking smile.</p><p>“I can defeat you in one move!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and closed in on Duanmu Lin.</p><p>“Arrogant! Let’s see how you can defeat me in one move! Great sun Thunder Blade slash!”</p><p>Duanmu Lin bellowed in rage and slashed his saber. The terrifying saber radiance was even more scorching than the sun as it flew toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Beast palm!”</p><p>Lu Ming said softly and struck out with his palm.</p><p>A huge beast claw appeared and charged toward Duanmu Lin.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The beast claw collided with the blade light, and the blade light was snuffed out like a wisp of smoke. The beast DAO palm didn’t stop, and it continued toward Duanmu Lin with an astonishing power.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>Duanmu Lin cried out in disbelief. Then, he frantically activated his bloodline and used all his strength to slash out.</p><p>“Block it! Block it!”</p><p>Duanmu Lin let out a deep roar as his sharp blade light condensed into a sun.</p><p>However, this sun was like a bubble that was destroyed by the beast DAO palm.</p><p>Bang! Following that, the beast DAO palm slapped onto Duanmu Lin’s body. Duanmu Lin let out a blood-curdling screech and was sent flying over a thousand meters away. Blood continuously spurted out of his mouth as his body trembled. His clothes were in tatters, and it was unknown how many bones in his body had been broken.</p><p>“Lin ‘er!”</p><p>In the sky, Duanmu canghai shouted worriedly.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>Even overlords like Yin tianjue and Shangguan Ming were shocked.</p><p>Lin Xueyi’s eyes were even more complicated.</p><p>“So strong! Tianyun is too strong!”</p><p>In all directions, Yan LAN, Mu Lan, and the others exclaimed in shock.</p><p>The battle continued, but everyone’s attention was drawn to this side.</p><p>As martial arts grandmasters, they could see the battle from dozens of miles away.</p><p>“I’ve said it before, I’ll defeat you in one move!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Impossible, impossible!”</p><p>Duanmu Lin roared, finding it hard to bear. He had prided himself as a peerless genius, but he was defeated by Lu Ming in one move. It was a huge blow to him.</p><p>Below, Lu Yao also had a look of disbelief on her face. In her eyes, Duanmu Lin, who had been unrivaled, had actually been defeated by tianyun in a single move.</p><p>“There’s actually such a genius in this world? Even Duanmu Lin was defeated in one move. The title of Marquis champion is indeed well-deserved!”</p><p>Lu Yao thought to herself as she looked at Lu Ming with a strange glint in her eyes.</p><p>“The second move will kill you!”</p><p>Lu Ming chuckled and took another step forward. At the same time, a cold killing intent burst out from his body.</p><p>“Tianyun, you dare?”</p><p>Duanmu canghai roared and wanted to help.</p><p>“Duanmu canghai, I’m your opponent!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi’s aura locked onto Duanmu canghai.</p><p>“Tianyun, there’s no enmity between us in the past, nor has there been any enmity between us recently. Why must you kill me? if you kill me, my Duanmu family will never let you off. Why must you seek trouble for yourself?”</p><p>Duanmu Lin cried out in fear.</p><p>“Hahaha, no grudges? No complaints? Duanmu Lin, your memory isn’t that good. I’ve said that I’ll definitely return to the mystical sword sect within two years and kill you. You’ve already forgotten?”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly laughed out loud. His voice also changed, returning to his original voice.</p><p>“What? You’re the referee!”</p><p>Duanmu Lin’s pupils rapidly contracted and his mind was greatly shaken.</p><p>Lu Ming reached out and wiped his face. He took off the disguise mask and revealed his handsome face. At the same time, the bones in his body moved and he returned to his original appearance.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Lu Ming, why are you here?”</p><p>Duanmu Lin shrieked hysterically when he saw Lu Ming’s face.</p><p>This was too hard for him to accept.</p><p>The champion, Marquis tianyun, was Lu Ming, the Lu Ming that he looked down on.</p><p>He would rather defeat his tianyun than Lu Ming. This was a blow to his heart that was ten times, no, a hundred times worse.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Lu Ming has returned!”</p><p>In the distant sky, Yan LAN, Mu Lan and the rest were shocked when they saw this.</p><p>Then, it was ecstasy, unbelievable ecstasy.</p><p>“Hahaha, this kid is actually tianyun? This old man is too shocked!”</p><p>Yan LAN laughed.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>Duanmu pojun, who was fighting against Yan LAN, let out a roar of disbelief.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Lu Ming, you’re finally back. I knew that you’d come back. You’d come back to fulfill your promise!”</p><p>Mu Lan’s eyes were filled with joy.</p><p>“Lu Ming is back!”</p><p>“Lu Ming is the Marquis champion, tianyun!”</p><p>All the disciples and elders of the mystical sword sect could not help but shout. The news quickly spread throughout the entire mystical sword sect and the entire battlefield.</p><p>No one would have thought that the renowned champion, hou tianyun, was actually Lu Ming, the man who had stormed The White Tiger Hall, killed Lu yunxiong, and killed dozens of people from the Duanmu family a year ago. In the end, he had been forced to withdraw from the mystical sword sect by the Duanmu family.</p><p>Many of them even remembered the determination and determination Lu Ming had when he left the mystical sword sect and the promise he made.</p><p>He would definitely return within two years and kill Duanmu Lin.</p><p>It had been less than two years. It had only been slightly more than a year and Lu Ming had returned.</p><p>Duanmu Lin had been defeated by him in one move.</p><p>The Return of the King!</p><p>A true king, no matter where he went, no matter what identity he used, was destined not to be buried. He would always shine.</p><p>Lu Ming is back. I’m indeed not as good as him!</p><p>Azure Dragon Hall, Zhang Muyun sighed.</p><p>“Haha, I knew he would come back!”</p><p>At the foot of The White Tiger Hall, Ling Kong, who was covered in blood, laughed heartily.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
