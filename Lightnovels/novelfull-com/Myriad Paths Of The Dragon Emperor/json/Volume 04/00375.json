The entrance to the battlefield has yet to open!”</p><p>Lu Xiu explained.</p><p>Everyone stopped a short distance away from Shi Feng, watching from a distance.</p><p>At this moment, Shi Feng was surrounded by a dense crowd of people.</p><p>hahaha, Lu Xiu, you’re early. How many pieces of trash did you bring this time? ”</p><p>At this moment, an arrogant laugh was heard.</p><p>After that-</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A series of air-rending sounds came over, and a large group of figures flew over here.</p><p>The number of people was unusually large. Lu Ming swept his gaze across and realized that there were at least six to seven hundred people.</p><p>The leader of the group was a skinny middle-aged man in a black robe.</p><p>The group of people stopped not far from Lu Ming and the rest. The skinny middle-aged man looked at Lu Xiu with a mocking expression.</p><p>“Zhao sui, is that you?” he asked.</p><p>Lu Xiu’s face darkened when he saw the skinny man.</p><p>“Haha, why? Lu Xiu, you don’t welcome me? That’s true. Every time the selection of the Emperor sky divine guards is held, the trash of the cloud Emperor mountain range that you led has always ended in a crushing defeat. No one from the cloud Emperor mountain range has joined the Emperor sky divine guards for two consecutive years. Compared to our thousand River waters, it’s really a tragic sight.”</p><p>The skinny man, Zhao sui, laughed mockingly.</p><p>Lu Xiu’s face turned even gloomier.</p><p>However, Zhao sui obviously didn’t want to stop here. He glanced at the people in the cloud Emperor mountain range and said, ” I didn’t expect that there are so many people from the Yundi mountain range who passed the preliminaries this time. Let me see how many there are. Tsk tsk, there are still ninety-seven people. Compared with the six hundred and eighty-nine people from our thousand River region, there are only five or six hundred people left. Not many, not many!</p><p>“Also, Lu Xiu, you’re too cruel. These 97 people should be all the geniuses in the cloud Emperor mountain range. Be careful that they don’t all die in the eastern nether ancient battlefield. If that happens, the cloud Emperor mountain range, a place where even birds don’t want to shit, will suffer even more.”</p><p>Zhao sui’s triangular eyes swept across the people in the cloud Emperor mountain range, full of ridicule.</p><p>“Zhao sui, you …”</p><p>Lu Xiu’s expression was extremely ugly.</p><p>The other people in the cloud Emperor mountain range also had ugly expressions.</p><p>hahaha, a bunch of trash wants to pass the Ditian Divine Guard selection? they really don’t know the immensity of the heavens and earth. They’re indulging in wild fantasies!</p><p>In the thousand River region, some of the young men also laughed mockingly.</p><p>The young men from the thousand River region looked at the cloud Emperor mountain range with contempt.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Young master Tian she, LAN Yundao, and the others were all proud and arrogant. How could they bear such contempt? they gritted their teeth.</p><p>“Kid, it’s you? Haha, I’ve finally found you.”</p><p>All of a sudden, a furious roar was heard from the waters of the thousand rivers. A young man flew out and stared at Lu Ming with a cold gaze.</p><p>“Autumn water!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>This young man was li qiushui. It seemed that she had already discovered him.</p><p>“Li qiushui, what are you doing? Last time you ran away so quickly, are you thanking me for not killing you this time?”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Brat, you should die. Let’s see who can save you this time.”</p><p>Autumn water roared.</p><p>“Oh, then you can try!”</p><p>Lu Ming gave him a sidelong glance.</p><p>“Junior Brother, is the kid you mentioned the trash from the cloud Emperor mountain range?”</p><p>At this moment, a blue-robed young man walked out from behind Li Qiu Shui and said indifferently.</p><p>“Senior disciple Jiang, that’s right. It’s this man. Not only did he use despicable means to Rob the treasure I got from the Heaven’s Gate, but he also ambushed me and injured me.”</p><p>Li autumn water shouted.</p><p>“Despicable methods? To plot against him?”</p><p>Upon hearing this, Lu Ming simply wanted to laugh.</p><p>This li autumn water was too shameless. Lu Ming had clearly defeated him head-on, but in his words, it was an ambush.</p><p>“You are indeed from the cloud Emperor mountain range. You only know how to plot. Kid, I’ll give you three breaths to hand over the treasure you got from Junior Brother li qiushui in the gate of heaven. Then, kneel down and admit your mistake in front of everyone. I can only cripple your cultivation and spare your dog life.”</p><p>Senior brother Jiang looked at Lu Ming coldly and spoke in a charitable tone.</p><p>“AI! When is the eastern nether battlefield going to open? I’m not in a good mood anymore after being surrounded by a few dogs barking.”</p><p>Lu Ming ignored senior brother Jiang and scanned the stone peaks.</p><p>Senior martial brother Jiang’s face turned livid.</p><p>Lu Ming actually dared to ignore him. He was simply courting death.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying aura burst out from senior brother Jiang’s body. A complete force was formed. Combined with his powerful cultivation, it formed a powerful pressure that spread across the entire area.</p><p>Aside from Jian Fengyun and Lu Xiu, everyone else in the Cloud King Mountain range was shocked.</p><p>This senior brother Jiang’s strength was extremely terrifying. He gave off the feeling that he was definitely not weaker than young master Tian she, who was ranked second on the cloud Emperor list.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression turned grave as he stared at senior brother Jiang.</p><p>“Brat, die! You won’t even have the chance to beg for mercy now.”</p><p>Senior martial brother Jiang’s face was extremely gloomy.</p><p>“So much nonsense, if you want to fight, then fight!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>He was fearless. With his current combat strength, even if he couldn’t defeat senior brother Jiang, senior brother Jiang wouldn’t be able to stop him if he wanted to leave.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the sound of a sword was heard. A figure suddenly appeared between Lu Ming and senior brother Jiang.</p><p>It was Jian Fengyun.</p><p>“Jian Fengyun?”</p><p>Seeing Jian Fengyun, senior brother Jiang’s expression turned serious.</p><p>Jian Fengyun had once adventured in the waters of the thousand rivers, and senior brother Jiang had seen him before.</p><p>There was only one person in the Cloud King Mountain range that he was afraid of-Jian Fengyun.</p><p>He didn’t care about the others at all.</p><p>“Jiang Chun, today is the day of the Ditian Divine Guard selection. If you want to fight here, aren’t you afraid that you’ll cause the unhappiness of the major characters in the Empyrean heaven divine Palace?”</p><p>Jian Fengyun looked at senior brother Jiang and said coldly.</p><p>haha, Jian Fengyun, I advise you not to interfere. Otherwise, this time, it won’t be like the last time, where I only left a scar on your face. Instead, I’ll take your life!</p><p>At this time, a loud laugh came from the waters of the thousand rivers. A young man with a Jade-like appearance walked out.</p><p>Jian Fengyun’s expression turned grim when he saw the young man.</p><p>He was injured by this person when he was wandering in the thousand River region.</p><p>This person was the 18th ranked genius of the thousand River region. Jian Fengyun had fought with him for hundreds of moves before he was defeated in one move.</p><p>“The past was the past. Now, I will definitely win!”</p><p>Jian Fengyun’s eyes were like two divine swords. He was filled with confidence.</p><p>“Certain victory? What a joke!”</p><p>The handsome young man sneered with disdain.</p><p>It looked like a great battle was about to break out.</p><p>Zhao sui watched coldly from the side, waiting to watch a good show.</p><p>Lu Xiu’s face was extremely gloomy.</p><p>The geniuses of the cloud Emperor mountain range would be like eggs hitting a stone if they fought with the geniuses of the thousand River region. They would end badly.</p><p>He wanted to stop Zhao sui, but he knew that Zhao sui would not let him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
