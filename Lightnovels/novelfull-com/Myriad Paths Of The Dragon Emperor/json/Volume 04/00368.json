The spiritual energy from all directions was gathering toward Lu Ming in a frenzy.</p><p>A moment later, Lu Ming’s body trembled slightly, and the sound of a Big River surging came from his body.</p><p>An aura that was twice as strong as before burst forth, but it quickly receded in the next moment.</p><p>“Early stage of the 5th level of the martial ancestor realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a faint smile.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation had already reached the peak of the fourth level of the martial ancestor realm a few months ago. He had been polishing his true Qi and strengthening his Foundation for the past few months. He had long reached the realm of being as one.</p><p>Just now, when he was feeling relaxed and at ease, his cultivation base had naturally broken through without the slightest hindrance or hesitation.</p><p>now, what is my ranking on the cloud Emperor board? ”</p><p>A smile appeared on Lu Ming’s face. In a flash, he flew along the river at high speed.</p><p>look! It’s a martial arts Grandmaster!</p><p>There were shadows of sails in the river. Someone on the boat saw Lu Ming and shouted.</p><p>Even in the thousand River region, martial grandmasters were high and mighty figures.</p><p>what a young martial arts Grandmaster. I want to be like him!</p><p>Some of the teenagers looked at Lu Ming in the sky with envy.</p><p>These people did not catch Lu Ming’s attention. His speed increased and the vast River crossed under his feet.</p><p>The river was many kilometers long. Lu Ming had already flown along the river for a hundred thousand kilometers but he still had not reached the end.</p><p>Along the way, they passed by countless tributaries, and countless people built their empires near the river.</p><p>Lu Ming guessed that this River was one of the main rivers in the thousand River area. It was said that there were 18 main rivers in the thousand River area and countless tributaries.</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>At this moment, a violent rolling sound came from the river below, and water splashed in all directions.</p><p>The waves rolled and Lu Ming saw countless fish in the water.</p><p>All kinds of fish jumped around. Some of them were dozens of meters long, and they were extremely huge, giving off powerful auras.</p><p>They were clearly fish-type demonic beasts.</p><p>These fish-type demonic beasts actually advanced side by side, swimming towards the front of the large river.</p><p>Lu Ming was very curious. He followed the fish-type demonic beasts.</p><p>The further they went, the more surprised Lu Ming was. There were more and more fish in the river.</p><p>There were even many shrimp and turtles, all of which were of the water race. They lined up and swam forward.</p><p>“What’s in front? It actually attracted so many Water Tribe members?”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and was extremely curious.</p><p>After traveling for about a thousand miles, Lu Ming saw a tributary.</p><p>Although it was called a tributary, it was actually about a hundred miles wide, extremely wide.</p><p>From this tributary, a large number of Water Tribe members also swam out and joined the group.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The sound of something breaking through the air could be heard. Lu Ming saw a middle-aged man and woman flying in the air. Like him, they were following the water Tribe.</p><p>The middle-aged man and woman clearly saw Lu Ming as well. Their eyes flashed but they did not say anything.</p><p>Lu Ming was more and more certain that there was a problem ahead.</p><p>After traveling for another 10000 miles or so, the water Tribe in the river was already densely packed, and there were already dozens of warriors in the Sky.</p><p>Those who could fly in the air were all martial arts grandmasters.</p><p>it seems like the Dragon Gate is about to appear again. I wonder where it will appear this time? ”</p><p>In the sky, a few young men whispered.</p><p>Lu Ming’s ears twitched and he naturally heard every single word.</p><p>it’s hard to say. The Dragon Gate, also known as the heaven Gate, is extremely magical. Every time it appears, the water area is different, and the time is not fixed. This time, it’s our lucky chance. We must seize it.</p><p>senior pan is right. It’s said that when the Heaven’s Gate appears, an extremely mysterious aura will spread out. People in that range will often be able to think more actively, especially their comprehension of Shi. It will greatly improve. This time, I must seize the opportunity and break through to the great success stage of the water Shi!</p><p>senior brother, I heard that the Heaven’s Gate spurts out all kinds of treasures. Is that true? ”</p><p>it’s true. Legend has it that the Heaven’s Gate is extremely mysterious. It’s connected to an extremely ancient and powerful world. Every time the Heaven’s Gate appears, precious items from that world will spray out!</p><p>Perhaps, these secrets were not rare in the waters of the thousand River. Therefore, when the few young people were discussing, they did not deliberately hide it. Lu Ming heard everything clearly.</p><p>“Dragon sect? Heaven’s Gate? There’s such a magical thing?”</p><p>Lu Ming secretly sighed.</p><p>Feeling even more curious, he followed them all the way.</p><p>After a few thousand miles, the water Tribe stopped.</p><p>In front of them was a huge intersection.</p><p>Three thousand-mile-wide rivers joined together to form an even wider River that flowed into the distance.</p><p>At the intersection of the Three Rivers, there was a huge Whirlpool. The river water rotated like a funnel.</p><p>The vortex was huge, at least hundreds of miles in diameter.</p><p>In the other two rivers, there were also a large number of Water Tribe members and many Warriors.</p><p>There should be about a hundred martial artists in total.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Suddenly, a violent roar came from the vortex.</p><p>In the river, countless members of the water Tribe made different sounds. They all stared at the vortex with reverence.</p><p>haha, every time the Heaven’s Gate appears, it will attract a large number of Water Tribe members. These Water Tribe members are really stupid. They really want to make the Great Leap!</p><p>One of the burly men laughed.</p><p>The others also smiled faintly, clearly used to it.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At this moment, the sound from the vortex became even louder, as if a behemoth was about to emerge from it.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The next moment, the ground suddenly trembled, and something actually rushed out from it.</p><p>It was actually a mountain peak. A mountain peak emerged from the vortex.</p><p>At first, it was the peak of the mountain, then it was the middle of the mountain, and slowly, the bottom of the mountain was revealed.</p><p>An extremely huge mountain peak appeared at the intersection of the Three Rivers, causing a large amount of river water to flow to both sides.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the mountain shook. A powerful aura spread out from the middle of the mountain, and a huge stone door appeared.</p><p>“The Heaven’s Gate, the Heaven’s Gate has appeared!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming was also extremely shocked. He looked at the mountainside from dozens of miles away.</p><p>The stone door was a hundred meters tall, and a hazy light emanated from it.</p><p>“Charge, charge!”</p><p>Someone shouted and flew toward the mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate. He followed the crowd and flew to the mountain peak. He stopped halfway up the mountain and ran toward the stone gate.</p><p>However, when he was about a thousand meters away from the stone door, Lu Ming felt a strong force acting on his body.</p><p>This was no ordinary power. It was a power that was as vast as the heavens and earth. It was very similar to Shi, but it was many times more powerful.</p><p>this … Could this be the power of the great Dao of heaven and earth? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was greatly shocked.</p><p>He could feel an extremely mysterious and all-encompassing aura from it.</p><p>It seemed to contain countless types of forces and countless types of profound meaning of heaven and earth.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Some people were pressed down by this force and directly knelt down.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
