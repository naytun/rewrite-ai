Five or six geniuses from Flying Tiger Mountain range couldn’t Dodge in time and were caught by the tongue.</p><p>“Save me!”</p><p>The five or six young men shouted in fear.</p><p>In the next moment, the tongue retracted back into the giant Toad’s mouth, and the cry stopped abruptly.</p><p>Lu Ming took the opportunity to rush into the canyon.</p><p>“Damn it, you animal, don’t even think about it!”</p><p>The long-armed young man roared and rushed into the canyon.</p><p>The remaining people scattered in all directions. Some fled to the outside of the canyon, while others rushed into the canyon.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The giant toad cried out and also rushed into the canyon.</p><p>Along the way, Lu Ming saw many corpses of demonic beasts.</p><p>Wherever there were spirit herbs, there would definitely be powerful demonic beasts guarding it.</p><p>The valley was very wide and deep, formed by two huge mountains.</p><p>The deeper he went, the stronger the medicinal fragrance became.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>At this time, more than a dozen demonic beasts rushed out of the canyon.</p><p>Each of these demonic beasts was very powerful. The weakest one was at eighth grade fourth level, seven to eight were at ninth grade fourth level, and two of them had even reached the peak of ninth grade fourth level, only a step away from the half-step Demon King realm.</p><p>This was the most powerful group of demonic beasts in the canyon. The long-armed young man and the others had been afraid of these demonic beasts and had not rushed in.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and his figure suddenly soared into the sky, appearing high in the sky.</p><p>Then, he took another step forward. This time, his target was the depths of the canyon.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Some demonic beasts roared angrily and tried to stop him, but Lu Ming was too fast and they could not make it in time.</p><p>At this moment, the giant toad rushed in again.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The giant toad roared loudly. Whether it was a human or a demonic beast, it attacked everyone.</p><p>Instantly, the giant toad and a dozen powerful demonic beasts were in a chaotic battle.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it!”</p><p>The long-armed young man roared.</p><p>The people from the flying Tiger Mountain range were the first to be affected by the demonic beasts on both sides.</p><p>A few more people died in the mouths of the demonic beasts.</p><p>“The spirit herbs are mine!”</p><p>The long-armed young man roared and used all his strength to break out of the encirclement, heading toward the depths of the canyon.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had already rushed to the depths of the canyon.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>At the sight of the scene in front of him, Lu Ming was taken aback, then he was overjoyed.</p><p>What appeared in front of them was actually a medicinal field.</p><p>That’s right, even though many years had passed, one could still vaguely see that it was a medicinal field.</p><p>There were seven to eight spiritual herbs growing in the herbal field.</p><p>Each spirit herb was shining with a faint spiritual light and emitting a strong medicinal fragrance.</p><p>that’s a ten-thousand-year-old blood ginseng and a Phoenix-shaped Lingzhi …</p><p>Lu Ming saw a few types that he recognized at a glance.</p><p>The ten-thousand-year-old blood ginseng was as thick as a child’s arm. It was blood-red in color and flickered with a blood-red light. It was extraordinary at first glance.</p><p>There was also the Phoenix-shaped Lingzhi, which actually grew like a phoenix. It was vivid and lifelike, and the medicinal fragrance was extremely strong.</p><p>These two spiritual herbs were both Level 5 spiritual herbs.</p><p>Furthermore, it seemed to be aged and its medicinal strength was extremely powerful.</p><p>There were a few other herbs that Lu Ming did not recognize. However, they did not seem to be inferior to the ten-thousand-year-old blood ginseng and the Phoenix-shaped Lingzhi. They were definitely Level 5 spiritual herbs.</p><p>upper Lv 5. These spiritual herbs are definitely upper Lv 5 spiritual herbs. Even a martial King would drool at them!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were glowing.</p><p>haha, with these spiritual herbs, my body can break through to the sixth realm.</p><p>“Wait, what’s that?”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s gaze fell on a small tree in the depths of the herbal field.</p><p>This small tree was not tall, only a little more than one meter. There was not a single leaf on the branches, but there were nine fist-sized fruits hanging on it.</p><p>The fruit was bright red and crystal clear. Around the fruit, there was a dense fiery red mist, as if a flame was burning and jumping.</p><p>“Could this be the Vermillion red fruit?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes widened. He could not hide his crazed joy.</p><p>The Vermillion Scarlet fruit was a rare treasure of heaven and earth. It was said that if martial arts grandmasters and ancient martial art practitioners consumed it, they could quickly improve their cultivation without any side effects.</p><p>haha, even the heavens are helping me. With the Vermillion fruit, my cultivation will be able to increase by a level.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the long-armed young man was flying towards them at high speed.</p><p>Then, his eyes flickered as he saw the spiritual herbs and Vermillion fruit in the herb field.</p><p>Vermilion fruit, that’s the Vermilion fruit. With these nine Vermilion fruits, my cultivation will definitely reach the 8th or even 9th level of the martial ancestor realm. Then, I won’t have to be afraid of anyone in the ancient battlefield of the netherworld.</p><p>The long-armed young man roared in his heart.</p><p>However, in the next moment, his expression became extremely ferocious and he shouted, ” “Bastard, what are you doing? These spirit herbs are mine.”</p><p>Lu Ming pounced on the spiritual herbs.</p><p>“Is this guy’s brain damaged?”</p><p>Hearing the long-armed young man’s words, Lu Ming pursed his lips speechlessly.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, a vast amount of genuine Qi gushed out and turned into genuine Qi shovels, digging out all seven spiritual herbs of different colors.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand again, and all the spirit herbs were kept in the Supreme shrine.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming pounced on the nine Vermillion fruit.</p><p>“Bastard, stop!”</p><p>The long-armed young man’s eyes turned red. He roared madly and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Heaven’s path palm!”</p><p>Lu Ming struck out with his palm, unleashing his strongest combat strength.</p><p>“Great ape King divine fist!”</p><p>The long-armed young man threw a punch.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying tremor was emitted as the heaven Dao palm print was pierced through by this punch.</p><p>However, the long-armed young man’s figure was also blocked for a moment.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming was sent flying backward by the force of the punch and happened to pass by the Vermillion red fruit tree.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, Lu Ming kept all nine Scarlet Vermilion fruits into the Supreme shrine.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body slammed heavily against the wall of the canyon. His face turned pale and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Hand over the spiritual medicine and the Vermillion fruit!”</p><p>The long-armed young man roared.</p><p>“Idiot!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and took a step into the sky. In an instant, he appeared in the sky. Then, he took another step and flew ten miles away.</p><p>“Animal, animal, stop right there!”</p><p>The long-armed young man shouted hysterically.</p><p>This was originally an opportunity that belonged to him. If he could use the Vermillion fruit to increase his cultivation, he would be able to use it as a Foundation to fight for more resources.</p><p>Now, all of them were taken away by Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming ignored him. He cast the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps continuously and disappeared into the horizon in the blink of an eye, without a trace.</p><p>damn it, damn it! When we leave the ancient battlefield of the netherworld, I will lead the experts to the cloud Emperor mountain range to find you and your family. I want them to die without a burial place!</p><p>The long-armed young man’s eyes flashed with extreme resentment.</p><p>Then, he gritted his teeth and went to save the other geniuses in Flying Tiger Mountain range.</p><p>Lu Ming was as fast as lightning. Not long after, he arrived at a quiet place ten thousand miles away. With a thought, he appeared in the Supreme shrine.</p><p>now, I’ll start cultivating the ten thousand spiritual combat body!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He picked up the ten-thousand-year-old blood ginseng that was as thick as a child’s arm and began to activate the ten thousand spiritual combat body.</p><p>Soon, the ten-thousand-year-old blood ginseng began to transform into wisps of Qi of myriad spirits and seeped into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Lu Ming’s physical body, which had already reached a bottleneck, began to improve again.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
