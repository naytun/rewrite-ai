If he had the chance, he would not mind getting rid of these people.</p><p>However, Jian Fengyun, young master Tian she, Qiu changkong, and the others were nowhere to be seen, so they probably hadn’t arrived yet.</p><p>After making a round, Lu Ming returned to his room and continued to cultivate.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of miles away from the myriad Star City, there was a Holy Land for cultivation called the hundred deities slope.</p><p>At this moment, Qiu changkong walked out of the hundred deities slope, his hair dancing in the wind.</p><p>His aura was several times stronger than before.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s see how you’re going to die this time!”</p><p>Qiu changkong’s voice was cold and sinister as killing intent flickered in his eyes.</p><p>also, Jian Fengyun of the Emperor Yun’s board should give up his first place this time.</p><p>Qiu changkong had cultivated on the hundred deities slope for several months, and his cultivation had improved greatly. Even his force had broken through to the peak stage. This made him very confident.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>An old man suddenly appeared beside Qiu changkong.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>Qiu changkong immediately bowed respectfully.</p><p>changkong, although your cultivation is not bad, you’re still not considered first-class among the geniuses in the entire Eastern Region of the Tianxuan region. There are still many variables in your path after successfully joining the Empyrean heaven divine guards!</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>“There are so many geniuses in the Eastern Region of the Tianxuan region?”</p><p>Qiu changkong asked in disbelief.</p><p>With his current cultivation and combat strength, how could he not be ranked among the top?</p><p>the Eastern Region of the Tianxuan region is extremely vast. Moreover, your generation is at its golden age. Geniuses are popping up like mushrooms after the rain. It’s going to be difficult to stand out from them.</p><p>The old man sighed and then said, ” but don’t be discouraged. Your talent can be considered as the top in the entire Eastern Region of the Tianxuan region. Some people are stronger than you in combat strength, but they have more resources than you since young and have a higher cultivation base. You are not weaker than them in a battle of the same level. As long as your cultivation base is higher, you may be able to compete with them.</p><p>the examination venue for this time’s selection should be the ancient battlefield of the netherworld. I know of a secret place in the ancient battlefield of the netherworld. There are great opportunities inside. After you enter, if you can obtain that opportunity, your cultivation will advance by leaps and bounds. It’s not impossible for you to completely enter the ranks of the top geniuses of the eastern part of the Tianxuan region!</p><p>Then, a jade talisman appeared in the old man’s hand. He handed it to Qiu changkong and said, ” the information about that secret place is in this jade talisman. Take a look!</p><p>“Chang Kong thanks master!”</p><p>Qiu changkong was overjoyed. He took the Jade talisman and knelt on the ground respectfully, kowtowing to the old man in gratitude.</p><p>go. Show off your brilliance in the Ditian Divine Guard selection this time!</p><p>The old man said with a smile.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Qiu changkong expressed his gratitude. After that, his figure flickered and he headed towards the myriad Star City.</p><p>…</p><p>Time flew by, and three days passed.</p><p>The cloud Emperor courtyard was getting more and more lively. Almost all the geniuses who had passed the preliminaries had arrived.</p><p>Jian Fengyun, young master Tian she, Qiu changkong, and the others were all revealed.</p><p>However, Xie nianqing had not arrived yet. This made Lu Ming a little worried.</p><p>Previously, Xie nianqing had said that he would find a place to cultivate in seclusion and would rush to the myriad Star City. There were still two days before the selection began, but Xie nianqing had not arrived yet. Could he have been delayed by something?</p><p>Although he was a little worried, he had no choice but to wait.</p><p>On this day, the elder leader of the cloud Emperor mountain range, Lu Xiu, gathered them together and announced some things about the selection.</p><p>The selection was held in an ancient battlefield.</p><p>This ancient battlefield was called the eastern nether ancient battlefield. It could be considered a plane and was a secret ground controlled by the Emperor heaven divine Palace.</p><p>It was full of danger, but also full of opportunities.</p><p>There were three months of free time inside. These three months would test one’s comprehensive ability.</p><p>This included intelligence, courage, combat power, and opportunities.</p><p>Opportunity was also luck, and luck was one of the most important factors for a martial artist.</p><p>Three months later, they would exit from the final exit. There were many checkpoints at the exit, and from there, they would be able to select the reserve and official empyrean heaven divine guards.</p><p>The selection of the Ditian divine guards was held once every five years, and the location of each selection was different. However, they were all filled with opportunities and dangers.</p><p>According to Lu Xiu, the ancient battlefield of the netherworld had not been used for the selection of Empyrean God guards for a hundred years. He had no idea what would happen inside.</p><p>After the announcement, Lu Xiu allowed them to move around freely and gathered them two days later.</p><p>In the following time, they went to various bookstores in the myriad Star City to search for books that recorded the ancient battlefield of the netherworld so that they could understand more information about it.</p><p>The more he understood, the more confident he would be.</p><p>Two days passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>However, there was still no trace of Xie nianqing. Lu Ming was a little anxious and worried.</p><p>Something must have happened to Xie nianqing. Otherwise, he would not have missed the Ditian Divine Guard selection.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not know where Xie nianqing had gone. Otherwise, he could look for her.</p><p>let’s not care about it for now. Xie nianqing is someone who doesn’t want to suffer losses. Nothing bad might happen to him. I’ll finish the Ditian Divine Guard assessment first!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>Today, all the geniuses in the cloud Emperor mountain range gathered in one of the courtyards of the cloud Emperor courtyard.</p><p>Out of the 97 people, Xie nianqing was the only one missing. The rest had all arrived.</p><p>Lu Xiu’s eyes swept across the room, but he didn’t say anything. It was normal for there to be fewer people.</p><p>alright, I’m sure all of you are clear about the rules of the selection. However, I’ll repeat it again. The three months in the eastern nether ancient battlefield are especially important. The eastern nether ancient battlefield is an ancient land in the ancient times. It is vast and full of dangers, but it is also full of opportunities. Some people can rise to the top in one go in these three months, while some will become stepping stones for others and be killed!</p><p>according to my experience, it’s best for all of you to work together after entering the eastern nether ancient battlefield. This is the safest way. Take these ten thousand mile sound transmission talismans and take one each. You can contact each other in the eastern nether ancient battlefield.</p><p>Lu Xiu took out a thousand mile sound transmission talisman and distributed it to them.</p><p>“Many thanks, elder Lu!”</p><p>Everyone thanked Lu Xiu.</p><p>“There’s no need to thank me. I only hope that more of you will join the Ditian divine guards. The better your results are, the more rewards I’ll receive.”</p><p>Lu Xiu was very direct and spoke his purpose.</p><p>This increased everyone’s impression of Lu Xiu.</p><p>alright, now follow me. The entrance to the ancient battlefield of the netherworld is a hundred thousand miles North of the myriad Star City.</p><p>After Lu Xiu finished speaking, he rose into the air.</p><p>The group followed him and left through the northern gate, heading north.</p><p>At this moment, the same situation was happening all over the myriad Star City. Groups of geniuses soared into the sky and headed north.</p><p>Some of them had about a hundred people, some had dozens, and some had thousands.</p><p>The dense crowd headed north in a Grand and magnificent manner.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
