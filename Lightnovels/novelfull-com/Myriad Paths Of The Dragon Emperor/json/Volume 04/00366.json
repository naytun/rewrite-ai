The screen shook and Xie nianqing came out.</p><p>...</p><p>As for Lu Ming’s score, it was still stagnant but it did not come out.</p><p>he’s really able to hold on. But this is the preliminaries, what’s the point of holding on? ”</p><p>Qiu changkong coldly laughed.</p><p>However, the next moment, his eyes popped out and his mouth opened so wide that he could swallow a dead rat.</p><p>On the first stone tablet, Lu Ming’s stagnant points suddenly soared again at a terrifying speed.</p><p>On the field, the others ‘expressions were similar to Qiu changkong’s. They were all dumbfounded.</p><p>“How is that possible? How was this possible? Why did Lu Ming’s points start to soar?”</p><p>“Could he have been hiding his strength?”</p><p>“That’s impossible, right?”</p><p>The crowd was in a heated discussion, and even Jian Fengyun was stunned.</p><p>Lu Ming’s points exceeded 2000 in an instant, then 2100,2200, and then he surpassed Qiu changkong.</p><p>When Lu Ming’s points reached more than 2400, the light screen trembled and he flew out directly. Shangguan Yunyan and the other geniuses in the top ten of the cloud Emperor ranking also flew out.</p><p>“Nest, why are you running out of time?”</p><p>After coming out, Lu Ming could not stop mumbling. He was somewhat speechless.</p><p>Previously, when he saw the black-robed men gain some insight, he couldn’t help but start to comprehend the force of the wind.</p><p>He had already reached the limit of the small success stage of wind force. With this comprehension, wind force smoothly broke through and reached the large success stage.</p><p>The force of wind and the force of fire fused together and increased their power.</p><p>Previously, the power of the Wind and Fire was one strong and one weak, and it was not balanced. Although the power of the fusion was great, it did not reach its maximum.</p><p>Now that the two types of Shi were in balance, its power was truly terrifying. It completely surpassed the power of a single ‘Shi’ at perfection.</p><p>Lu Ming’s two forces merged into the long spear. With a sweep of the long spear, the black-robed men in the middle of the eighth level martial arts Grandmaster realm were defeated one after another. It was impossible to stop them.</p><p>In just a few breaths ‘time, the 20 Black-robed men in the martial ancestor eighth realm middle stage were all defeated.</p><p>Next, there were twenty black-robed men in the later stage of the eighth level martial arts Grandmaster realm. However, they could not withstand Lu Ming’s attack and were killed in a short time.</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was about to fight the twenty black-robed men at the peak of the eighth level martial arts Grandmaster realm, the space suddenly trembled and he was teleported out.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately knew that the time was up.</p><p>“Forget it, this score should not be too bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>“Brother Lu, congratulations!”</p><p>At this moment, Feng Wuji and Ling Yanchi walked over and cupped their fists.</p><p>However, the two of them looked helpless and bitter.</p><p>Lu Ming knew that the two of them definitely did not pass the test. Their points did not reach 500 points.</p><p>Lu Ming had already guessed this and did not say much.</p><p>At this moment, the second stone tablet was shining and the ranking had changed.</p><p>The top three remained the same. They were still Jian Fengyun, young master Tian she, and Jiang hongwen.</p><p>The fourth place had changed to Shangguan Yunyan.</p><p>Fifth place, still LAN Yun said.</p><p>The top seven on the cloud Emperor board had not changed. However, the eighth place had changed to Lu Ming.</p><p>Qiu changkong, on the other hand, had dropped to the tenth place.</p><p>Yan feixun directly fell out of the top ten and was ranked eleventh.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Yan feixun trembled with anger.</p><p>Before this competition, he was full of confidence and wanted to advance a few more ranks. Now, not only did he not advance, but he even fell back a few ranks.</p><p>“Lu Ming is to blame!”</p><p>Yan feixun immediately put the blame on Lu Ming. If Lu Ming had not made it to the eighth place, he would not have dropped out of the top ten.</p><p>Although there was only a one rank difference between the 11th and the top 10, they were on two completely different levels.</p><p>On the other side, Qiu changkong’s eyes were filled with killing intent. Lu Ming had actually surpassed him. He found it hard to accept that they were both from the blazing sun Empire.</p><p>From then on, the leader of the blazing sun Empire’s geniuses was Lu Ming, not him.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>Qiu changkong roared in his heart.</p><p>Lu Ming seemed to have sensed Qiu changkong’s killing intent. He looked at Qiu changkong and sneered.”Little Kong, I’m sorry. I accidentally surpassed you. Now, in the burning sun Empire, you’re number two.”</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re a coward!”</p><p>Qiu changkong bellowed, his eyes red with anger.</p><p>What did Lu Ming call him? Little Kong?</p><p>What did he mean by not wanting to surpass him? Did he become the second child?</p><p>Every word was so infuriating that Qiu changkong felt his heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney ache.</p><p>“Lu Ming, just because you have a high score for the myriad illusionary killing array doesn’t mean that you can win a real life-and-death battle!”</p><p>Qiu changkong took a deep breath and calmed himself down after a while.</p><p>“Oh? Was it? Then let’s have a real life-and-death battle!”</p><p>Lu Ming glared at Qiu changkong with murderous intent.</p><p>Qiu changkong was someone he had to kill. It would be great if he could take this opportunity to get rid of him.</p><p>However, Qiu changkong’s eyes flickered but he didn’t agree. He snorted coldly and walked to the side.</p><p>Now, he did not have any chance of winning. He had no confidence in Lu Ming’s combat strength.</p><p>“So you didn’t dare, you’re really a coward!”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips.</p><p>Qiu changkong’s eyes turned red again, and he almost exploded in anger.</p><p>He could not wait to turn around and cut Lu Ming into eight pieces.</p><p>However, his rationality told him that he had to endure it.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll make sure you die without a burial place sooner or later.”</p><p>Qiu changkong bellowed in his heart.</p><p>The test was still going on, and there was only one group left. However, this group did not have any outstanding geniuses, so the crowd was not interested.</p><p>Very quickly, half an hour had passed and the last group was finished. The names of the preliminary qualifiers had all been announced.</p><p>A total of 98 people passed the preliminaries and obtained the qualifications to participate in the Ditian Divine Guard selection.</p><p>More than 600 people had come, but only 98 people had passed. This probability was not low.</p><p>Don’t forget, these 600 people were all geniuses on the same level as the six heroes of the scorching sun.</p><p>alright, the 98 of you have passed the preliminaries and become the Emperor sky divine guards. The selection will be held in the myriad stars city in three months. All you need to do is to get to the myriad stars city within three months.</p><p>Lu Xiu announced.</p><p>myriad stars city? ”</p><p>Many people were stunned, obviously not having heard of it.</p><p>“The myriad Star City is the branch Palace of the Emperor heaven divine Palace in the eastern part of the profound heaven region. All of you just need to rush to the myriad Star City and gather at the courtyard in the cloud Emperor mountain range. I will be waiting for you there. This is the map to the myriad Star City!”</p><p>Lu Xiu gave them a brief introduction, then took out a stack of maps and distributed them to everyone.</p><p>alright, now follow me out. You can make your own arrangements for the next three months!</p><p>Lu Xiu said.</p><p>Then, everyone followed Lu Xiu out of myriad illusion Canyon.</p><p>Then, they all dispersed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ve been surpassed by you this time. Next time, I’ll definitely surpass you.”</p><p>On the way back, Xie nianqing gritted his teeth and said to Lu Ming, ”</p><p>This time, Xie nianqing was ranked 15th, falling behind Lu Ming. She was still brooding over this.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly. Why did this chick want to surpass him every day?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
