I don’t want to play with you anymore!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“What? To deal with us?”</p><p>The people from the nether demon Palace were stunned for a moment before they started to laugh crazily.</p><p>“Hahaha, aren’t you afraid of twisting your tongue when you talk big? With you?”</p><p>this brat is talking nonsense on purpose to disturb our state of mind. Don’t talk anymore. Let’s use our full strength and kill him!</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the seven disciples of the nether demon Palace started to shine with silver light.</p><p>They were all chakra, the chakra of King-level bloodlines.</p><p>Among the seven, two of them had second-level king class bloodlines, three had third-level king class bloodlines, and the two strongest had fourth-level king class bloodlines.</p><p>Their chakra glowed and their bloodlines burst forth, raising the auras of the seven disciples of the nether demon Palace to the peak.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>…</p><p>The seven disciples of the dark Demon Palace formed a huge formation. Sword Qi glowed as they charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“I have a bloodline too!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and activated his second blood Meridian. A tall and blurry stone tablet with four silver chakras flashed and disappeared.</p><p>a fourth level King bloodline. It’s strong, but what’s the use? ”</p><p>The green-haired young man let out a long howl and his sword Qi burst forth, shrouding Lu Ming.</p><p>“What if I add this?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>Groan!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar resounded as the bloodline of the nine Dragons rushed out and roared towards the sky.</p><p>Everyone from the nether demon Palace, as well as Song Yu and the others, widened their eyes as if they had seen a ghost.</p><p>King level bloodline? how could he have two King level bloodlines? ”</p><p>“Could he be an innate King level?”</p><p>“Natural King level? It’s impossible!”</p><p>The mental array of the nether demon Palace all cried out in disbelief, and even the operation of the array stopped.</p><p>“Nothing is impossible. Swallow!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons roared and opened its mouth. A terrifying devouring power was produced from its mouth and enveloped the seven people from the nether demon Palace.</p><p>“What’s going on? I feel that my bloodline power is a little unstable!”</p><p>“My blood essence is beating!”</p><p>Everyone from the nether demon Palace shouted out in fear.</p><p>The two bloodlines of a martial Grandmaster could be activated at the same time.</p><p>However, for most martial artists, the first bloodline was only at the mortal level. For martial arts grandmasters and above, the effect of using the mortal bloodline was extremely limited and negligible.</p><p>That was why most people would only activate their second bloodline. Very few people would activate both bloodlines at the same time.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was different. Both of his bloodlines were King level and had different effects on his body. He could unleash them as much as he wanted.</p><p>it’s just a small trick. Hold on, go kill him!</p><p>The green-haired youth roared.</p><p>“Oh, really? Then let’s continue, heaven’s path palm!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and suddenly blasted a palm.</p><p>Huhu ~</p><p>The spiritual Qi of heaven and earth seemed to have been sucked out. A huge transparent palm print appeared, carrying a violent offensive power. It pressed down on the seven people from the nether demon Palace like Mount Tai.</p><p>A terrifyingly huge pressure caused the world to tremble violently.</p><p>The sword Qi from the nether demons Palace instantly crumbled.</p><p>“Argh! What kind of battle technique was this? How can it be so terrifying!”</p><p>The disciples of the nether demon Palace shouted in fear. It was simply unbelievable.</p><p>“Hold on! We’ll hold them together!”</p><p>The green-robed young man’s eyes turned red as he desperately howled.</p><p>The seven disciples of the nether demon Palace used all their strength and activated the combined formation to the extreme. The seven of them joined forces and slashed out a shocking sword Qi towards the heavenly path palm print.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The sword Qi struck the palm of the heaven Dao palm print and immediately caused an earth-shaking boom. A terrifying wave of air swept out, sweeping away all the clouds in a radius of several dozen kilometers. Even the city below began to tremble violently.</p><p>Song Yu and the others were blown against the wall by the strong wind before they could stand firm.</p><p>But they couldn’t care less about their sorry state. Their eyes were wide open as they stared at the sky.</p><p>Which side would win?</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Suddenly, the sword light shook and exploded, turning into a rain of light and dissipating.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Even though a portion of the heaven’s path palm strike’s power had been neutralized, the remaining power was still terrifying as it continued to press down.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The seven disciples of the nether demon Palace were like toads. They could not move at all and were forced to sink into the mud.</p><p>The two with the weakest cultivation screamed in pain and stopped breathing.</p><p>As for the three peak sixth level martial ancestor realm geniuses, although they were not dead, they were half-dead.</p><p>There were only two 7th level martial arts grandmasters in the world. They only spat out a mouthful of blood, but they still maintained a certain amount of combat power.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The green-robed young man roared and was about to use a secret skill to escape.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s second palm strike was immediately released.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Another huge palm print formed and pressed down on the disciple of the nether demon Palace.</p><p>“I’m not afraid!”</p><p>The green-haired youth and the others roared in despair.</p><p>The palm of the great path was incomparably mysterious. It had completely locked onto them, and they had no way to escape.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Even if the remaining two tried their best, they would not be able to resist.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Smoke and dust filled the air as the two of them were blasted into the ground, creating two huge pits. They lay in the pits, unable to move.</p><p>At that moment, Song Yu, Song Jing, and the others were dumbfounded. They could not come back to their senses.</p><p>The seven geniuses from the nether demon Palace had set up a joint attack formation, but Lu Ming had defeated them with two palm strikes. This was too terrifying.</p><p>On one side of the sky, the disciple of the you mo Palace who had escaped last time was now trembling non-stop. His lips were trembling and his face was pale without a trace of blood. His eyes were filled with fear.</p><p>demon, monster, this is my fault. Run, run, I want to get away from this monster, run!</p><p>He roared in his heart and was about to use a secret technique to escape.</p><p>At this moment …</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>A ray of spear light pierced through his back.</p><p>The disciple of the dark Demon Palace bellowed and turned his head desperately, only to see Lu Ming’s cold eyes.</p><p>“I let you escape last time. Do you think there will be a second time?” he said.</p><p>A faint voice came out of Lu Ming’s mouth.</p><p>Then, with a shake of the spear, the spear radiance destroyed the life force of the disciple of the nether demon Palace. His corpse then fell to the ground.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took another step forward and walked toward the green-haired young man and the other man.</p><p>At this moment, the two couldn’t move. They were terrified.</p><p>“Wait a minute, don’t kill us. We are disciples of the dark Devil Palace. The geniuses of the dark Devil Palace are as numerous as the clouds. This time around, there are more than five hundred geniuses who have entered. We are just a small portion of them. There are still many stronger geniuses in other cities. If you kill us, the disciples of the dark Devil Palace will not let you off.”</p><p>The green-haired youth shouted.</p><p>“Hehe, as long as I kill all of you, how will the other people from the nether demon Palace know that I killed them?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>of course I know. I might as well tell you that I have already used the shadow breathing talisman to copy your image and sent it to the strongest genius of the nether demon Palace. You can’t escape!</p><p>The green haired youth shouted.</p><p>“So it’s the shadow resting talisman?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Like the ten thousand mile sound transmission talisman, the shadow dissipating talisman was made by an inscription master.</p><p>The shadow breath talisman could copy the appearance of a certain scene or a certain person and send it to another person who also had the shadow breath talisman. It was a very magical item.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
