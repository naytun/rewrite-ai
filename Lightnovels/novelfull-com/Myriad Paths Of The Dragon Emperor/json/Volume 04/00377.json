Now, Lu Ming had beaten Yan feixun to the point where he coughed up blood with one move. How could they be on the same level?</p><p>LAN Yundao’s expression froze. His eyes were filled with disbelief and shock.</p><p>Even he could not injure Yan feixun with a single move. Could it be that Lu Ming’s combat strength was already above his? how was that possible?</p><p>On the side, yang Liuji’s face was pale and his eyes were wide open. He was so scared that he almost peed his pants.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was too scary!</p><p>“Lu Ming, what are you doing? You’ve injured your own people and reduced the strength of the cloud Emperor mountain range. What are you trying to do?”</p><p>LAN Yundao’s eyes rolled and he suddenly shouted.</p><p>“That’s right, Lu Ming. You’ve offended the people of the thousand River waters and you’re making us take the blame. I suggest that we let Lu Ming leave the team. The people of the thousand River waters want Lu Ming, not us. As long as Lu Ming is not around, the people of the thousand River waters will not make things difficult for us!”</p><p>Yang Liuji, who was hiding behind LAN Yundao, also shouted.</p><p>If he could not defeat Lu Ming, he would use his power to suppress Lu Ming and make him leave the team.</p><p>“That’s right, Lu Ming. If you’re in the team, all of us will be harmed by you!”</p><p>LAN Yundao also shouted.</p><p>The rest of the people also looked at Lu Ming with unfriendly gazes.</p><p>They felt that LAN Yundao and yang Liuji’s words made sense.</p><p>hehe, if you want me to leave, I’ll leave without you telling me. But before I leave, I’ll kill you all first!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming thrust his spear at LAN Yundao.</p><p>The Spear’s radiance burst out.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, a figure flashed and appeared in front of LAN Yundao. A jet-black sword light slashed out and clashed with Lu Ming’s spear radiance.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The force shot out in all directions. Lu Ming’s body swayed and he took three steps back.</p><p>“Young master Tian she!”</p><p>The one who suddenly attacked was young master Tian she.</p><p>Young master Tian she’s face darkened. He looked at Lu Ming and said, ” “Lu Ming, you’ve gone too far. You’ve done something wrong and implicated others. Now, you want to kill someone? do you really think you’re invincible?”</p><p>“Oh! It seems like you want to meddle in other people’s business?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“What do you mean by being a busybody? brother LAN is my best friend. Furthermore, what he said is right. You should get out of the team to avoid harming others.”</p><p>Young master Tian she said in a gloomy voice.</p><p>“Insect, let’s see if you can stop me!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s body emitted a powerful aura.</p><p>“What did you just say? You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Young master Tian she burst out with cold killing intent. Lu Ming actually dared to call him a reptile. Damn it!</p><p>Young master Tian she’s body exuded a terrifying aura, which was much stronger than LAN Yundao and the others.</p><p>Young master Tian she, ranked second on the cloud Emperor ranking list, was able to compete with Jian Fengyun. LAN Yundao was definitely no match for him.</p><p>Their combat strength was terrifying. Lu Ming was probably not their match now.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was fearless. Even if he was no match, it was impossible for young master Tian she to kill him!</p><p>everyone, this Lu Ming is a scourge. Keeping him alive will only get us killed. Why don’t we attack together and kill him!</p><p>At this moment, LAN Yundao called out to the others in the cloud Emperor mountain range.</p><p>The others ‘eyes flickered.</p><p>“That’s right, I agree with what brother LAN said!”</p><p>Someone stood out and looked at Lu Ming with killing intent.</p><p>“I also agree!”</p><p>More than a dozen people stepped forward in succession. Together with young master Tian she and LAN Yundao, they formed a powerful force and pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Among them were geniuses like Ji rufeng, who was ranked seventh on the cloud Emperor ranking.</p><p>However, there were also some people who stood still.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, you’ve become public Enemy. Surrender!”</p><p>LAN Yundao sneered.</p><p>“You think you can kill me?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered, not afraid at all.</p><p>“Everyone!”</p><p>At this moment, Jian Fengyun walked out and frowned. “The incident at the thousand River region has nothing to do with Lu Ming. The thousand River region has always looked down on us. Even without Lu Ming, I’m afraid they won’t show us any mercy!”</p><p>“What’s wrong? Jian Fengyun, are you going to protect Lu Ming?”</p><p>Young master Tian she said.</p><p>“I’m not trying to protect anyone, I’m just telling the truth!”</p><p>Jian Fengyun’s brows furrowed even more.</p><p>hehe, Jian Fengyun, if you want to protect Lu Ming, then we can’t work together anymore. Let’s leave!</p><p>Young master Tian she said coldly.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>He glanced at young master Tian she, LAN Yundao, and the others. His killing intent flickered as he said, ” “Didn’t you want me to leave? I’ll leave, but the next time we meet, I’ll definitely kill you!”</p><p>Today, Lu Ming had originally wanted to kill LAN Yundao, yang Liuji, and the others in one fell swoop to get rid of future trouble.</p><p>But with young master Tian she’s interference, it would be difficult to handle.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming predicted that Jian Fengyun would definitely intervene if a huge battle were to break out.</p><p>Jian Fengyun wouldn’t side with any of them, but it would be impossible to kill LAN Yundao and the others with his interference.</p><p>In that case, it was better to leave first and improve his cultivation and combat strength. Next time, he would kill LAN Yundao and young master Tian she.</p><p>“And Qiu changkong!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes swept across the room, but he did not see Qiu changkong.</p><p>It seemed that Qiu changkong hadn’t teleported to the nearby area.</p><p>“Next time? You’re the one who’s going to die!”</p><p>Young master Tian she sneered.</p><p>He had the intention to kill Lu Ming, but he knew that it was impossible with Jian Fengyun’s interference.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He moved and left the place quickly.</p><p>Young master Tian she, LAN Yundao, and the rest sneered as they watched Lu Ming leave.</p><p>“It’s extremely dangerous at night in the ancient battlefield of the netherworld. Lu Ming, let’s see how you’re going to survive on your own. There’s still a next time? In your dreams!”</p><p>LAN Yundao was laughing in his heart.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming soared into the sky. A moment later, he was already ten thousand miles away.</p><p>I must find a way to improve my strength as soon as possible. Otherwise, I’m afraid that I won’t be able to achieve anything in the eastern nether ancient battlefield where geniuses are as common as clouds!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>This area was full of vitality, unlike the desolate and silent battlefield that he had imagined.</p><p>It seemed that after a long time, this land had already recovered its vitality.</p><p>From time to time, he could see groups of demonic beasts.</p><p>However, these demonic beasts were not of high levels and Lu Ming had no interest in hunting them.</p><p>also, it’s best to find an ancient city before dark. Otherwise, it’ll be very dangerous!</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>Two days ago, he had also studied the ancient records regarding the eastern nether ancient battlefield.</p><p>According to the records, the eastern nether ancient battlefield would become extremely strange and dangerous at night.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to fly forward. Soon, a vast mountain appeared in front of him.</p><p>In the vast mountains, ancient trees reached the sky, and the roars of beasts echoed.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop and flew over the mountain.</p><p>Gah!</p><p>Before he could fly far, a sharp cry rang out. A giant strange bird rushed out of the forest, its wings flapping and bringing with it gusts of strong wind.</p><p>A pair of sharp iron claws clawed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“A class 7 Lv 4 demonic beast!” He exclaimed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
