Mo Ying’s servants were sent flying far away and fell to the ground. One side of their faces was already swollen and blood was flowing from their mouths.</p><p>Behind the big-bellied old man, a young man in luxurious clothes with a sinister face walked in.</p><p>“Young prince, please spare my life. This lowly one didn’t lie. Miss mo Ying is currently cultivating in seclusion and has ordered us not to disturb her no matter what.”</p><p>A maidservant in her twenties knelt on the ground and said with a trembling body.</p><p>“Can’t be disturbed? Who did mo Ying think she was? The Little Prince coming to see her was a blessing that she had accumulated over several lifetimes. What could be more important than The Little Prince? Hurry up and report this, or I’ll kill you all.”</p><p>The pregnant old man shouted coldly as he looked at the maidservant with a ferocious expression.</p><p>“Young prince, young miss, she really …”</p><p>The maidservant wanted to continue, but the pregnant old man was already impatient. He shouted, ” “You’re really looking for death!”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The pot-bellied old man slapped the other side of the maidservant’s face. The maidservant screamed and flew far away. She fell to the ground and passed out.</p><p>When the other servants saw this, they trembled in fear.</p><p>hurry up and call your miss out. Otherwise, she’ll be a role model.</p><p>The pregnant old man pointed at the maidservant and coldly said.</p><p>Squeak!</p><p>At this moment, mo Ying’s door opened. Lu Ming and Mo Ying walked out of the room one after another.</p><p>When the young prince saw Lu Ming walking out of mo Ying’s room with her, he was stunned. Then, his handsome face contorted, he pointed at Lu Ming and screamed, ” “Little bastard, little bastard, you actually dare to enter mo Ying’s room. What are you two doing inside? Damn it, damn it!”</p><p>“And you, little b * tch, I came here to see you. Not only did you stand me up, but you also closed your door and refused to see me for seven days. So you’re with this little bastard. I’m going to kill you.”</p><p>hey, Who are you? you’re barking like a Mad Dog. Have you taken the wrong medicine? also, we’re both unmarried. We’re just hiding in the room doing what we should do. It’s none of your business.</p><p>Lu Ming cast a sidelong glance at the young prince and said indifferently.</p><p>“You … You …”</p><p>The young prince was so angry that he almost spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Lu Ming actually dared to speak to him in this manner. Did he eat a flood Dragon’s gallbladder?</p><p>Also, the young prince really wanted to shout,”it’s none of my” bird “business,” but of course, he forcefully held back his words.</p><p>“Kid, do you know who I am?”</p><p>The young prince took a deep breath and spoke slowly.</p><p>He reckoned that Lu Ming did not know who he was. He wanted to announce his name and make Lu Ming feel fear, panic, and fear. Then, he would kill Lu Ming and let him know what regret was.</p><p>“Who are you? Does it have anything to do with me?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>The young prince was stunned for a moment. Then, he took a deep breath to calm himself down and continued,”You listen well, I am the only son of Zhennan Wang, the young prince of Zhennan Wang Fu.”</p><p>With that, the young prince looked at Lu Ming arrogantly, hoping to see fear, panic, and fear on Lu Ming’s face.</p><p>Unfortunately, he was disappointed. Lu Ming seemed to have heard the name of a nobody and did not have any reaction at all. Lu Ming said indifferently, ” so it’s the son of some dog shit Duke of the South. So the sons of the Duke are all idiots.</p><p>“You … What did you just say? You’re looking for death, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>The young prince was so angry that he was trembling. He pointed at Lu Ming and kept screaming.</p><p>“Abby!”</p><p>Mo Ying rushed to the unconscious servant girl and checked her injuries.</p><p>Then, he looked at the young prince angrily and said, ” “Young prince, ah bi was only following my orders. Aren’t you being too harsh?”</p><p>“Heavy-handed? Mo Ying, she’s just a lowly servant girl. She doesn’t know any respect, yet she dares to make excuses in front of me. I’m teaching her a lesson on your behalf.”</p><p>The young prince gritted his teeth and forced himself to calm down.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Mo Ying’s pretty face was livid with anger.</p><p>“What respect? You keep saying that others are lowly, but in my opinion, you’re just a trash who relies on your father’s influence.”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“Audacious, impudent, lowly ant, you dare to call me trash? You have committed a grave crime. Today, no one can save you. If I don’t kill you, I’m not a human.”</p><p>The young prince cried out hysterically.</p><p>Lu Ming actually dared to call him trash? A lowly ant actually dared to call him trash. Rebellious, rebellious.</p><p>“Isn’t it? You think you’re high and mighty, superior to others, but what do you rely on? Power or strength?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“I have power, I have strength, I was born noble, how can you lowly ants compare to me?”</p><p>The young prince shouted.</p><p>“Oh, really? Since that’s the case, you’re nothing but a pile of dog shit in front of me. ”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“What? What did you just say? Damn it, kill him, kill him for me, I want to grind his bones to dust, skin him and pull out his tendons.”</p><p>The young prince roared madly.</p><p>“Little bastard, die!”</p><p>The pot-bellied old man had been holding it in for a long time. At this time, he roared angrily and aimed a palm at Lu Ming’s face.</p><p>He might be fat, but he was as fast as lightning. His cultivation had already reached the third level of the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>In an instant, it was close to Lu Ming and was about to slap his face.</p><p>“Brother Lu, be careful! Quickly run!”</p><p>Mo Ying exclaimed.</p><p>However, Lu Ming stood there without moving.</p><p>Just as the big-bellied old man’s palm was about to land on Lu Ming’s face, Lu Ming kicked him.</p><p>It was impossible to describe how fast this kick was. The kick arrived first despite launching later, and it landed heavily on the round stomach of the big-bellied old man.</p><p>His stomach sank in like a rubber ball, and his eyes were like dead fish, popping out.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>With a scream, the old man with the big belly was sent flying backward like a swollen ball.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming moved and caught up with the pregnant old man in an instant. He slapped him.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>A crisp sound of a slap was heard. The old man with the big belly was sent spinning dozens of times in the air by Lu Ming’s slap before he fell heavily to the ground.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A human-shaped pit appeared on the ground. The old man with the big belly was lying in the pit, twitching continuously and blood kept flowing out of his mouth.</p><p>The entire place was silent.</p><p>Everyone, including mo Ying, looked at Lu Ming in a daze.</p><p>The big-bellied old man in the third level of the martial arts Grandmaster realm was beaten up by Lu Ming as if he was an ant. He was half-dead after two punches.</p><p>Lu Ming was actually such a terrifying expert?</p><p>Previously, although mo Ying knew that Lu Ming was very powerful, she had guessed that Lu Ming should be just a little stronger than her. However, at this moment, she knew that she was wrong. She was terribly wrong. Lu Ming’s ability was far beyond her imagination.</p><p>“Good hit!”</p><p>Mo Ying’s servants roared in their hearts, feeling extremely refreshed.</p><p>Previously, the pot-bellied old man had been so arrogant and regarded them as ants. Now, they were like dead dogs.</p><p>“Little bastard, how dare you hit my people! How dare you!”</p><p>The young prince reacted and shouted.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
