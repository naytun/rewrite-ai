He wanted to verify it with the heavenly Dao palm and comprehend the heavenly Dao palm.</p><p>This cultivation was indeed very effective. Lu Ming’s understanding of the heavenly Dao palm had greatly deepened. Although it was impossible to cultivate it successfully in a short time, as long as he persevered, he believed that it would not be long before he succeeded.</p><p>A few hours later, Lu Ming continued to move. He rushed to the myriad Star City according to the map.</p><p>A few days later, Lu Ming left the thousand river water area and came to another area.</p><p>This area was called the eight desolate swamp area.</p><p>As its name suggested, the eight desolate swamp area was full of swamps of various sizes.</p><p>The small ones were as small as ponds, while the large ones were tens of thousands of miles in size, and some even covered hundreds of thousands of miles.</p><p>All kinds of creatures were born in the swamp, most of which were poisonous.</p><p>At the same time, there were martial artists who had established their own countries in the eight desolate swamp. Most of them practiced poison techniques, and their overall strength was even stronger than that of the thousand River region.</p><p>Lu Ming flew in the air, secretly sighing at the wonders of nature.</p><p>In this way, Lu Ming would stop to cultivate when he was tired or when he felt something.</p><p>Sometimes he comprehended the heavenly way palm, sometimes he comprehended the power of wind and Fire, and sometimes he comprehended the second step of the nine Dragons heaven treading steps.</p><p>Therefore, his speed was not very fast. The journey that should have taken a month took him more than two months, almost three months.</p><p>When he arrived at the myriad stars city, there were still five days before the Ditian Divine Guard selection.</p><p>Along the way, his understanding of the heaven path palm deepened day by day. He was not far from successfully cultivating it.</p><p>In addition, his wind force had also broken through and reached the limit of large success, on the same level as his Fire Force. However, it was still very difficult to break through to perfection.</p><p>The one with the slowest progress was the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps, and he still hadn’t successfully cultivated the second step.</p><p>this is the myriad stars city? ”</p><p>When Lu Ming stood at the foot of a huge mountain and looked up at the sky, he was extremely shocked.</p><p>What appeared in front of him was a huge mountain that covered at least a few hundred miles.</p><p>This mountain peak was different from ordinary mountains.</p><p>The bottom of an ordinary mountain was the widest. The higher one went, the narrower the peak would be.</p><p>However, this mountain peak was like a stone stick. The foot, waist, and peak of the mountain were all equally wide.</p><p>It rose straight into the sky, reaching up to 10000 meters high, and disappeared into the clouds.</p><p>The myriad stars city was built on this mountain peak.</p><p>However, this was not what shocked Lu Ming. What shocked him was the area of the myriad stars city.</p><p>The area of the myriad stars city was more than ten times larger than the area of this mountain.</p><p>This mountain peak was only a small part of the middle of the myriad stars city.</p><p>Most of the area of the myriad stars city was suspended in the air, and it was thousands of miles wide.</p><p>The mountain peak and the myriad stars city were like an umbrella, with the mountain peak as the pole and the myriad stars city as the umbrella.</p><p>The city of ten thousand stars, thousands of miles in both length and width, covered the sky and cast a large shadow on the ground.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were sharp. He noticed that there were suspension bridges on the steep mountain peak for people below the martial arts Grandmaster level.</p><p>A martial ancestor could directly fly in.</p><p>Lu Ming rose into the air and flew toward the myriad Star City.</p><p>The closer they got to the city, the more they felt how majestic it was.</p><p>All around them, there were pitch-black city walls that were thousands of meters tall, and they were densely engraved with inscriptions.</p><p>There weren’t many soldiers on the city wall, but there was a terrifying aura.</p><p>It was just a wall, but Lu Ming could sense hundreds of powerful auras. Each of these auras was not weaker than the overlords of the burning sun Empire, such as Yan Quan and Lin Xueyi.</p><p>Half-step King … These auras were all half-step King Warriors.</p><p>There were also a few auras that were as deep as the ocean, and they were many times stronger than half-step Kings.</p><p>Lu Ming could feel the terrifying pressure and he had difficulty breathing.</p><p>King’s aura! These are definitely peerless martial King realm experts!</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely shocked.</p><p>At the same time, they were also amazed. The myriad Star City was indeed worthy of being the Emperor heaven divine Palace’s branch Palace in the eastern part of the Tianxuan region. It was simply too powerful.</p><p>It was said that the entire myriad Star City was built by the peerless experts of the Emperor heaven divine Palace.</p><p>It was just a city wall, which was nothing compared to the entire myriad stars city, but it was already so terrifying.</p><p>this is the stage for the strong. The burning sun Empire is too small!</p><p>Lu Ming took a deep breath. His eyes were shining and full of fighting spirit. Then, he flew toward a gate of the myriad Star City.</p><p>There was no one guarding the gate, only an inscription platform.</p><p>If one wanted to enter the myriad Star City, they had to pass through the platform. If someone from the enemy forces of the Emperor heaven divine Palace entered, the platform would be able to sense it.</p><p>At the main entrance, people came and went, and it was very lively.</p><p>Of course, only martial arts grandmasters were able to enter and exit this place.</p><p>He walked through the gate and arrived at the wide street.</p><p>The street was a hundred meters wide, and there were all kinds of rare beasts and martial arts powerhouses on it.</p><p>Most of them were young people. Some of them were middle-aged, and some of them were elderly.</p><p>As the selection of the Ditian divine guards neared, geniuses and experts from various regions in the Eastern Region of the Tianxuan region had gathered here. Naturally, the number of people had increased.</p><p>Experts, they were all experts.</p><p>Lu Ming casually sensed and realized that the pedestrians on the street were experts.</p><p>Many middle-aged and old people were at least at the eighth or ninth level of the martial ancestor realm. There were even quite a few who were half-step Kings.</p><p>Half-step Kings were unrivaled overlords of the blazing sun Empire.</p><p>In mid-tier empires, half-step King Warriors were also overlords, but they were no longer the strongest. Mid-tier empires had King Warriors.</p><p>And in a high tier Empire, half-step King Warriors were nothing. They could only be considered as peak experts.</p><p>As for a place like the ten thousand Star City, half-step Kings could only be regarded as ordinary experts. Kings were the true experts.</p><p>As for the young men and women on the street, they were all Dragons and phoenixes among men. When they looked around, they were in high spirits and full of confidence.</p><p>Each of them had a powerful aura, and even the weakest of them was stronger than Feng Wuji and Ling Yanchi.</p><p>These were all geniuses from all over the Eastern Region of the Tianxuan region. Those who could make it here were all geniuses who had passed the preliminaries, and none of them were weak.</p><p>Lu Ming looked left and right, sizing up his surroundings.</p><p>After that, he found a shop and asked the shopkeeper where the courtyard in the cloud Emperor mountain range was.</p><p>He didn’t expect the shopkeeper to think for a long time before he remembered the location of the courtyard in the cloud Emperor mountain range.</p><p>The reason was that the cloud Emperor mountain range was too small, so he did not have a deep impression of it.</p><p>Lu Ming followed the shopkeeper’s instructions and spent more than an hour before he found the courtyard in the cloud Emperor mountain range.</p><p>Every region would have a courtyard in the myriad Star City. The elder in charge of that region would be in charge of the courtyard, making it easier for the geniuses of that region to gather.</p><p>The courtyard was quite large, enough for thousands of people to live in.</p><p>Lu Ming walked into the courtyard and registered himself. Someone brought him to his room.</p><p>After the rooms were allocated, Lu Ming strolled around the courtyard.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
