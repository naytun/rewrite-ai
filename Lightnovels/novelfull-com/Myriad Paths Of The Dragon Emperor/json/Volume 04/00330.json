Wuwu</p><p>Many figures flew over from every corner of the mo family.</p><p>These were all martial arts Grandmaster realm experts.</p><p>As one of the top ten families in the yin Yue Empire, the mo family’s strength was not to be underestimated.</p><p>In addition to these martial Grandmaster powerhouses, there were also some martial Grandmaster realm martial artists gathered.</p><p>In an instant, the stone house was filled with people.</p><p>In the underground cave.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>die! Yan Quan roared. His true energy burst forth like an ancient beast struggling.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>With three consecutive crisp sounds, the remaining three chains were all broken by the hot spring.</p><p>hahaha, I’ve been trapped for more than ten years, and I’ve finally escaped. Mo family, accept my revenge!</p><p>Yan Quan laughed crazily, his face revealing an extremely ferocious expression.</p><p>After a while, he turned to look at Lu Ming and Mo Ying.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>He moved his body and appeared a few meters in front of Lu Ming and Mo Ying in an instant.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Mo Ying was so scared that she gasped and took three steps back.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure did not move, but his pupils shrank. He held the long spear horizontally in front of him, ready for a great battle.</p><p>“Haha, little girl, what are you afraid of? You guys saved me, why would I make things difficult for you?”</p><p>Yan Quan grinned at mo Ying, then looked at Lu Ming with surprise in his eyes, ” “Little brother, this time, it’s all thanks to you that this old man was able to escape. This is a great favor, and I can’t not repay it. However, now is not the time to talk about this. After this old man has destroyed the mo family, we will talk about this again!”</p><p>Yan Quan laughed and strode toward the exit.</p><p>“Let’s go out too!” Lu Ming’s eyes flickered.</p><p>He then followed the old man out with mo Ying.</p><p>When he passed by the corpses of the two mo family elders, Lu Ming had silently devoured their blood essence.</p><p>The three of them continued forward.</p><p>Soon, he walked out of the underground and returned to the stone house.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Yan Quan’s palm struck out, and the stone door of the stone house exploded. Broken stones flew everywhere, and a burst of exclamations came from outside.</p><p>“It seems that they are all waiting outside. Good, I don’t need to go and find them!”</p><p>Yan Quan grinned, his eyes filled with killing intent as he strode out.</p><p>Lu Ming and Mo Ying followed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed the moment he walked out of the stone house.</p><p>There were hundreds of people outside.</p><p>All of them had powerful auras and were all experts. Even the weakest among them was at the martial Grandmaster realm.</p><p>“Flame spring!”</p><p>Seeing the three of them come out, the mo family head and several elders “expressions changed drastically, and they cried out.</p><p>“Set up the formation, quickly set up the formation!”</p><p>One of the elders shrieked.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Their figures flashed wildly. At least a few dozen martial grandmasters moved and formed a battle formation.</p><p>At the forefront of the battle formation were the mo family head and a few elders.</p><p>mo Ying, how dare you release the demon that the family has been suppressing? you are unforgivable!</p><p>The head of the mo family shouted.</p><p>Mo Ying’s body trembled when she heard this.</p><p>They had lied to mo Ying and wanted to use her as a guide to refine her into the yin moon demonic chief.</p><p>But now, as soon as she came out, the head of the mo family pinned the crime of releasing the demon suppressed by the mo family on mo Ying’s head.</p><p>He was really shameless.</p><p>“Family head, you lied to me. There’s no inheritance of our ancestor down there. You want to kill me!”</p><p>Mo Ying said in a trembling voice.</p><p>shut up, little b * tch. You’re wrong. If you still dare to talk back, kneel down and accept your death!</p><p>The head of the mo family shouted, not allowing mo Ying to talk back. He was no longer as kind as before.</p><p>Mo Ying’s face was pale, and her delicate body trembled non-stop. She bit her lip so hard that it bled, and she didn’t even know it was bleeding.</p><p>Initially, she still had a glimmer of hope for the mo family, but now, she had lost all hope.</p><p>“Haha, old man, you lied to your own disciples, saying that you want to pass on the ancestor’s legacy, but it’s actually just for the order of the younger disciples to refine some Bullsh * t yinyue demonic chief. Now you’re still making it sound so Grand, are you a f * cking dog? Don’t you have any shame?”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed loudly, pointing at the mo family head and berating him.</p><p>“Little bastard, what did you say? How dare you talk to me like that?”</p><p>The head of the mo family roared, his eyes filled with killing intent.</p><p>“Who the hell are you? Do I have to give you face when I speak? Don’t flatter yourself!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and looked at the head of the mo family in disdain, as if he was looking at a pile of dog shit.</p><p>This kind of gaze almost made the head of the mo family spit out a mouthful of blood. He was so angry that his entire body trembled.</p><p>hahaha, little brother, that was a good scolding. The entire mo family is a pile of dog sh * t, haha!</p><p>Yan Quan laughed.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it! Lu Ming, you’ve ruined the refinement of the Dark Moon demonic chief and the great plan of the Dark Moon imperial family! Even if you die ten thousand times, you won’t be able to make up for it!”</p><p>At this moment, a sharp cry filled with resentment rang out. It was Yin Jiufeng.</p><p>“Oh, isn’t this the young prince? Why don’t you go home and drink your milk? do you want to get beaten up again?”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips.</p><p>One sentence almost caused Yin Jiufeng to suffer internal injuries.</p><p>“Lu Ming, if I don’t kill you today, I’m not a human!”</p><p>Yin Jiufeng shouted in a furious voice.</p><p>“If I remember correctly, you called me that last time. Why? Are you still human?”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a mocking smile.</p><p>“Argh! You f * ck you! Kill him! Kill him!”</p><p>Yin Jiufeng’s face turned ashen, and he almost exploded in anger.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The two elders behind Yin Jiufeng shouted and were about to pounce on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Who can he kill?”</p><p>Yan Quan coldly shouted as he threw a punch.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The two old men exploded, scaring Yin Jiufeng so much that he screamed repeatedly. Under the protection of the remaining two old men, he retreated frantically.</p><p>“Let’s attack together and suppress old demon Yan Quan!”</p><p>The head of the mo family roared.</p><p>“Suppress old demon Yan Quan!”</p><p>Everyone from the mo family shouted.</p><p>More than 30 martial Grandmaster powerhouses set up a large array and charged toward Yan Quan.</p><p>good. I’ll settle the score with the mo family today!</p><p>Yan Quan shouted as he charged towards the mo clan.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Yan Quan shouted with a shocking aura, like a demonic god.</p><p>He threw out a punch, and a brilliant fist force shot out toward the mo family.</p><p>Lu Ming could sense that the aura from the flame spring was not any weaker than the sect leaders of the five major sects of the blazing sun Empire.</p><p>This was the limit of zongshi realm, known as half-step King realm.</p><p>“Hundred swords formation, suppress and kill!”</p><p>The people from the mo family did not dare to be careless. More than 30 people joined forces, and their auras merged together to form a giant sword that was hundreds of meters tall, slashing down at Yan Quan.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The huge sword and the fist radiance collided, producing a shocking boom. The entire mo family shook violently, and some of the nearby buildings were blown to pieces by the shock wave.</p><p>This attack was evenly matched.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Immediately, Yan Quan and the mo family members began to fight again.</p><p>“Kill, kill this little bastard now!”</p><p>Yin Jiufeng shouted.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Behind Yin Jiufeng, the remaining two elders charged towards Lu Ming, exuding a powerful aura.</p><p>Martial ancestor 8-stage!</p><p>The two elders were both in the eighth level of the martial ancestor realm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
