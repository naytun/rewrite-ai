This girl was throwing a tantrum again.</p><p>it’s just a fake Wolf King. Let’s see if they dare to be arrogant in front of the real Wolf King!</p><p>Xie nianqing snorted and quickly formed a seal with his hands.</p><p>Immediately, Xie nianqing’s body emitted layers of black light. Slowly, the black light condensed into a giant Silver Wolf in the air.</p><p>“Moonhowl Wolf!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but exclaim.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be more familiar with this giant Silver Wolf.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing had each obtained half of a moonhowl Wolf’s beast soul in the Dongyi tribe’s ancestral ruins.</p><p>Later on, in the battle at The White Tiger Hall, Lu Ming had fused with half a beast King Soul, killed Lu yunxiong, and fought Duanmu Lin.</p><p>He was extremely familiar with this giant Silver Wolf.</p><p>He didn’t expect Xie nianqing to condense a moonhowl Wolf.</p><p>However, Lu Ming could tell that this did not seem to be a beast soul. It had been condensed and was the embodiment of a kind of cultivation technique. The aura of the sky Wolf had weakened a lot.</p><p>OWW!</p><p>The moonhowl Wolf let out a deafening howl, and a Supreme pressure radiated from it.</p><p>Although it was only half a beast and had been condensed, the moonhowl Wolf had been a true demon King, a true king, and the pressure of a superior was extremely powerful.</p><p>Wuwuwu …</p><p>Countless Crimson-scaled wolves howled and lowered their heads, looking at the moonhowl Wolf in awe.</p><p>The moonhowl Wolf’s entire body was silvery-white, and it stood in the air, howling continuously.</p><p>Slowly, some of the rank 4 demonic beasts, the bloodred scaled wolves, also knelt down.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>However, the two bloodscaled Wolf Kings kept howling. They looked at the moonhowl Wolf in the sky. Although they were a little afraid, they did not give in.</p><p>Furthermore, his eyes glowed with ferocity, as if he was ready to pounce on Lu Ming and Xie nianqing at any moment.</p><p>it seems like the two Wolf Kings are very difficult to tame!</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>OWW!</p><p>The moonhowl Wolf in the air howled into the sky, and its body glowed with a dazzling silver light.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s body began to emit a silver light. Then, the silver light condensed into a huge moonhowl Wolf in the sky.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>could it be that when I fused with the moonhowl wolf’s soul, there were traces of the wolf left in my body? now that Xie nianqing’s half of the moonhowl Wolf has activated it, it’s showing itself.</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind whirred and he thought of this.</p><p>This was the only explanation that could make sense.</p><p>The moonhowl Wolf materialized on Lu Ming’s body and howled into the sky as well. Waves of mighty pressure emanated from it.</p><p>The rest of the wolves were all lying on the ground, and some of the low-level ones were even trembling.</p><p>Even a small number of Level 4 Crimson scaled wolves were lying on the ground obediently, not daring to move.</p><p>Only the two bloodscaled Wolf Kings continued to howl, but there was finally a trace of fear in their eyes.</p><p>At that moment, the moonhowl Wolf above Xie nianqing’s head and the one above Lu Ming’s head fused together to form an even larger moonhowl Wolf.</p><p>OWW!</p><p>The moonhowl Wolf let out a long howl and emitted an extremely powerful King’s pressure. It was a pressure that was born to the wolf race. It was high and mighty and could not be provoked.</p><p>The two bloodscaled Wolf Kings began to tremble, their eyes filled with fear.</p><p>The moonhowl Wolf stood in the air, looking down at the two bloodscaled Wolf Kings.</p><p>There seemed to be a faint displeasure in his eyes.</p><p>Wuwuwu …</p><p>The two bloodscaled Wolf Kings were finally scared. They prostrated on the ground and whimpered like two dogs raised at home.</p><p>“Tamed?”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>OWW!</p><p>The moonhowl Wolf let out an angry howl. The two bloodscaled Wolf Kings trembled and stood up shakily. They crawled to Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s side and lay down obediently.</p><p>“It really is!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered, overjoyed. He moved and mounted the back of a bloodscaled Wolf King.</p><p>The bloodscaled Wolf King did not resist at all.</p><p>On the other side, Xie nianqing also mounted another bloodscaled Wolf King. The other one was also very obedient.</p><p>Lu Ming took a glance and realized that Xie nianqing’s Wolf was a female while Lu Ming’s was a male. No wonder they were two Wolf Kings.</p><p>haha, little Qing, one male and one female. They’re a perfect pair, just like you and me!</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily.</p><p>“Who’s a couple with you? you wish!”</p><p>Xie nianqing snorted and rolled his eyes at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming grinned. He was just joking and did not mind.</p><p>The moonhowl Wolf in the air howled and transformed into two rays of light. They disappeared into Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s bodies.</p><p>The powerful pressure between heaven and earth also disappeared.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The two bloodscaled Wolf Kings growled and stood up.</p><p>However, they didn’t go crazy or resist. They seemed to be completely tamed.</p><p>perhaps, there are still remnants of the moonhowl Wolf’s aura on me and Xie nianqing. That’s why we were able to subdue the two Wolf Kings.</p><p>Lu Ming made a guess.</p><p>He then patted the bloodscaled Wolf King and said, ” “Call all your subordinates and follow me!”</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>The two bloodscaled Wolf Kings were very obedient. They let out two long howls that spread out for dozens of miles.</p><p>The other bloodred scaled wolves howled and gathered from all directions.</p><p>In the end, the surroundings were densely packed with bloodred scaled wolves.</p><p>It covered the mountains and plains, and one could not see the end of it.</p><p>“So many?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little stunned, then he was overjoyed.</p><p>Lu Ming took a closer look and realized that there were more than eight thousand Crimson scaled wolves all over the mountain.</p><p>There were 8000 of them, and most of them were Rank 2 demonic beasts. A small portion of them were rank 3 demonic beasts, and there were even dozens of rank 4 demonic beasts.</p><p>A level-four demonic beast was equivalent to a martial arts Grandmaster.</p><p>“I’m rich, I’m rich!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared in his heart.</p><p>“Why are you so happy? Don’t forget, it’s all thanks to me that you were able to tame the Crimson scaled Wolf this time. If it were you, you would have run away a long time ago, you coward!”</p><p>Xie nianqing pouted and said in disdain.</p><p>“Yes, yes, it’s all thanks to you.”</p><p>Lu Ming was in a good mood and did not argue with Xie nianqing.</p><p>“You’ve lost the bet this time. You won’t go back on your word, will you?”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>hey, I’ve also contributed to taming the Wolf King. How do you say I lost? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“What kind of contribution is that? if it wasn’t for me, you wouldn’t have had the chance to tame the Wolf King. If you go back on your word, I’ll tell everyone in the camp that you’re going back on your word.”</p><p>Xie nianqing said through gritted teeth.</p><p>“……”</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming could only compromise and agree to one of Xie nianqing’s conditions.</p><p>“What condition? As long as it’s within my means, I won’t refuse!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“It’s not the time yet. When the time comes, I’ll naturally tell you.”</p><p>Xie nianqing smiled slyly and rode away on the bloodscaled Wolf King.</p><p>Lu Ming rode on the wolf King and followed.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing took the lead, followed by more than 8000 bloodred scaled wolves.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
