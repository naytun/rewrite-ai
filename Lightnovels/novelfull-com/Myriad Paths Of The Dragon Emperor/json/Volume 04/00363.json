People were constantly being surpassed, and people were constantly rushing up.</p><p>...</p><p>After the sixth group, yang Liuji had dropped to 21st place. This made his face extremely gloomy, especially when a few unknown people had surpassed him. This made his face even uglier.</p><p>There were still quite a few experts who had yet to go on stage.</p><p>Originally, yang Liuji had been very ambitious and wanted to make it to the top 30, or even the top 20, but now it seemed that there was no hope at all.</p><p>It would be good enough if he could keep his position on the cloud Emperor board.</p><p>After the sixth group was finished, it was the seventh group’s turn.</p><p>“Brother Yan, how about we attack?”</p><p>LAN Yundao looked at Yan feixun and said with a smile.</p><p>“Just what I wanted!”</p><p>Yan feixun smiled.</p><p>“Count me in!”</p><p>A young man in green stepped out. Everyone recognized him as the seventh-ranked Ji rufeng.</p><p>“The top ten geniuses are about to make their move!”</p><p>Everyone’s heart trembled as they revealed looks of anticipation.</p><p>Would there be any changes in the top ten this time?</p><p>Their bodies flickered as they charged forward.</p><p>“Young master Huo Ling has also made his move!”</p><p>“And Qiu changkong!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming looked up and saw the arrogant young master Huo Ling and Qiu changkong.</p><p>These two people had attracted a lot of attention recently. Many people were guessing whether the two could make it into the top ten.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The 50 figures charged into the myriad illusionary killing array.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were burning as they stared at the two stone tablets.</p><p>There were many experts in this group, so the competition would definitely be intense.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A breath after everyone had rushed in, the first stone tablet suddenly glowed with names.</p><p>LAN Yun said. Ji rufeng, Yan feixun, Qiu changkong, and young master Huo Ling were all here.</p><p>At the same time, the points behind their names jumped up rapidly and began to soar.</p><p>These five people’s points rose at almost the same speed, leaving the others far behind.</p><p>In just two minutes, the points of the five of them had exceeded 500 points and continued to soar.</p><p>In eight minutes, his score had exceeded 1000 points.</p><p>At this time, the speed of the five people slowly slowed down.</p><p>“This is truly shocking. Qiu changkong and young master Huo Ling are actually able to keep up with LAN Yundao’s speed. This is truly shocking.”</p><p>“Can the two of them really make it into the top ten?”</p><p>it’s hard to say. The higher the level of the ten thousand illusionary killing array, the more difficult it is. At their level, if they want to determine the winner, they will have to see the later battles!</p><p>Many young men were discussing.</p><p>Her score continued to rise. 1500,1800,2000.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, all five of them had more than 2000 points.</p><p>At this moment, it could be seen that LAN Yundao’s growth was the fastest, followed by Ji rufeng.</p><p>However, Yan feixun, Qiu changkong, and young master Huo Ling were almost the same.</p><p>When it broke through 2100 points, Yan feixun, the fire spirit young master, and Qiu changkong’s points rose at the speed of a turtle.</p><p>When the 30 minutes were up, the screen flickered and a few figures flew out.</p><p>They were Yan feixun, Qiu changkong, and the fire spirit young master.</p><p>The three of them looked pale and weak.</p><p>“Qiu changkong is in the lead. His points are actually higher than young master Huo Ling and Yan feixun.”</p><p>Someone cried out in shock.</p><p>Qiu changkong’s score was 2235 points.</p><p>Yan feixun, on the other hand, had 2205 points, 30 points less than Qiu changkong.</p><p>And the fire spirit young master had 30 points less than Yan feixun.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Yan feixun shouted angrily, killing intent flashing in his eyes.</p><p>He had actually been surpassed by Qiu changkong.</p><p>“Hmph! I was just lucky. If we were to fight face to face, I would definitely be able to kill them all!”</p><p>Young master Huo Ling coldly snorted. He was very unhappy.</p><p>When the final moment arrived, LAN Yundao and Ji rufeng also appeared.</p><p>Both of them had more than 2400 points. However, LAN Yundao had more points and was ahead of Ji rufeng.</p><p>At the same time, the second stone tablet glowed and the ranking on it changed.</p><p>LAN Yundao was temporarily in first place, followed by Ji rufeng, Qiu changkong, Yan feixun, and the fire spirit young master.</p><p>As for yang Liuji, he had already reached the 29th place.</p><p>This made yang Liuji’s face as dark as charcoal.</p><p>“Next, the eighth group!”</p><p>Lu Xiu announced.</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, a young man stepped out.</p><p>Jian Fengyun!</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>Jian Fengyun was about to make his move, and everyone was extremely excited.</p><p>Jian Fengyun was a rare genius who dominated the cloud Emperor ranking and suppressed the other geniuses in the cloud Emperor mountain range.</p><p>It was because he was too strong.</p><p>As for him, it had been almost two years since anyone had seen him in action. What level had his cultivation reached now?</p><p>haha, Jian Fengyun, you’re finally going to fight. Alright, even though this isn’t a direct fight, it’s an indirect one. Let me see how much you’ve improved during this period of time.</p><p>Young master Tian she sneered and also stepped forward.</p><p>“Since you’ve all made your moves, I’ll play with you too!”</p><p>Jiang hongwen also walked out with a smile.</p><p>Everyone felt their hearts beat faster.</p><p>The top three geniuses on the cloud Emperor board were going to fight together. This was too shocking and exciting.</p><p>Everyone seemed to be able to see countless sparks shining.</p><p>Two of the top ten geniuses had wanted to make a move, but they stopped.</p><p>If he were to attack together with Jian Fengyun, young master Tian she, and Jiang hongwen, he would only serve as a foil.</p><p>“Tian she, I will let you see that the gap between you and me is getting bigger and bigger.”</p><p>Jian Fengyun smiled faintly, his confidence was undeniable.</p><p>“Hmph, strength is not something that can be said with words!”</p><p>Young master Tian she coldly snorted.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the next moment, their figures flickered and rushed into the myriad illusionary killing array.</p><p>Immediately, the score began to soar.</p><p>Jian Fengyun, young master Tian she, and Jiang hongwen’s points were skyrocketing at a terrifying speed.</p><p>Five hundred points, one thousand points, one thousand five hundred points, two thousand points.</p><p>After two thousand points, their speed didn’t slow down and continued to soar.</p><p>Many people’s hearts were in their throats as they watched with wide eyes, afraid to miss the wonderful scene.</p><p>3,000 points</p><p>When they reached 3000 points, young master Tian she and Jiang hongwen’s speed began to slow down.</p><p>However, Jian Fengyun was still very fast.</p><p>Oh my God, 3000 points. According to my guess, after 3000 points, the opponents that appear will be in the early stage of martial ancestor realm level 9. And there are 20 of them!</p><p>that’s right. Their opponents are indeed 20 early ninth martial ancestor realm experts!</p><p>Lu Xiu gave an affirmative answer.</p><p>Everyone gasped. Lu Ming’s gaze also narrowed.</p><p>Facing the siege of 20 early stage ninth level martial ancestor realm experts, he could still keep increasing his points. The top three on the cloud Emperor list were indeed terrifying.</p><p>As time passed, it became more and more difficult for young master Tian she and Jiang hongwen to increase their points. In the end, they basically stopped.</p><p>Jian Fengyun’s points continued to rise. In the end, he was ahead of young master Tian she by more than six hundred points.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Once the 30 minutes were up, they were teleported out one by one.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
