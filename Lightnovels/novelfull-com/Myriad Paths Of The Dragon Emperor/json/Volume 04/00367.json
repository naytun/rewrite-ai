Don’t be like this. Brother Feng and brother Ling will laugh at us!</p><p>Lu Ming whispered in Xie nianqing’s ear.</p><p>“Who are you flirting with? Don’t talk nonsense!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s face turned red and she glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>we’ve already seen each other. We’re not considered an old couple. Do I really have to do you? ”</p><p>Lu Ming touched his chin and muttered.</p><p>“Lu yingming, die!”</p><p>A sharp cry rang out, piercing Lu Ming’s eardrums.</p><p>Xie nianqing gritted her teeth. If not for Feng Wuji and Ling Yanchi, she would have pounced on Lu Ming and bit him.</p><p>“Gentle, gentle, a girl must be gentle, understand? Don’t let brother Feng and brother Ling see you as a joke!”</p><p>Lu Ming put his hands behind his back and smiled evilly.</p><p>At the side.</p><p>“Argh! Brother Ling, the sky is so beautiful today, and the moon is so bright!”</p><p>“Haha, you’re right, brother Feng!”</p><p>It was broad daylight and the sun was shining brightly. Feng Wuji and Ling Yanchi looked up at the sky and lied through their teeth, pretending that they did not see Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>The few of them quarreled all the way back to the inn.</p><p>News of this test started to spread like wildfire in the cloud desolate Empire’s capital.</p><p>Jian Fengyun’s power and invincibility naturally caused a heated discussion among many.</p><p>In addition, the names of Lu Ming, Qiu changkong, and Xie nianqing were also mentioned.</p><p>This was because the three of them came from the same Empire, the blazing sun Empire, a small country.</p><p>The blazing sun Empire had produced so many terrifying geniuses, and two of them had even made it into the top ten. This was even more terrifying than many of the middle-level empires.</p><p>For example, the blood Zhao Empire did not even have a single top ten.</p><p>Two days later, on a mountain peak, Qiu changkong knelt down before an old man.</p><p>“Master, why are you here?”</p><p>Qiu changkong respectfully replied.</p><p>This old man was Qiu changkong’s in-name disciple. He was an important figure in the eastern branch of the Emperor heaven divine Palace.</p><p>Zhangkong, although you were ranked 36th on the cloud Emperor board, you were arrogant and never put the other geniuses on the board in your eyes. After this preliminary round, you should have realized that there is always someone better, right? ”</p><p>moreover, this is only the cloud Emperor mountain range. The cloud Emperor mountain range is a barren land, and the geniuses there can’t be compared to those from other regions. It’s still very difficult for you to successfully join the Emperor sky divine guards!</p><p>The old man sighed.</p><p>“Please give me some guidance, master!”</p><p>Qiu changkong respectfully replied.</p><p>“En, this time, master came here to bring you to the hundred deities slope to cultivate. This quota was obtained with great difficulty by master, so you must treasure it.”</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>“Hundred gods slope!”</p><p>Qiu changkong was ecstatic upon hearing this.</p><p>The hundred deities slope was an extremely famous sacred cultivation ground in the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. He had heard of this name long ago, but he was not qualified to enter.</p><p>This time, his master had actually helped him obtain such a precious quota.</p><p>“Changkong thanks master. I’m willing to go through fire and water for master.”</p><p>Qiu changkong knelt down once more.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>With a wave of his hand, the old man and Qiu changkong disappeared without a trace.</p><p>…</p><p>Cloud desolate Empire imperial capital, Inn.</p><p>“Little Qing, you’re leaving? Where are you going?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>Just now, Xie nianqing had said goodbye to him.</p><p>of course I’m going to find a place to seclude myself. Fortunately, I’ll surpass you in three months. Well, I’ll see you in the myriad Star City in three months!</p><p>With that said, Xie nianqing sized Lu Ming up carefully, then turned and left, disappearing in an instant.</p><p>Looking in the direction that Xie nianqing had disappeared, Lu Ming felt a slight reluctance to part.</p><p>“Little Qing, how far can you go in three months?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s identity had always been very mysterious. Lu Ming still did not know where she came from.</p><p>And her sister, Xie nianjun, was a natural-born King with terrifying talent.</p><p>Lu Ming had a feeling that when he met Xie nianqing again in three months, her cultivation would have improved greatly.</p><p>looks like I’ll have to work hard too. Otherwise, I might really be surpassed by her.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>After a long while, Lu Ming looked at Feng Wuji and Ling Yanchi.</p><p>“Brother Feng, brother Ling, what are your plans after this?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“We’re planning to return to the blazing sun Empire. What about you, brother Lu?”</p><p>Feng Wuji said.</p><p>I’m going to set off for the myriad Star City now. I’ll cultivate while I’m on the way!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>He had already seen the map. The myriad Star City was too far away from the cloud Emperor mountain range.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s current cultivation, it would take him a month to fly at full speed.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming decided to cultivate as he hurried on his journey.</p><p>He treated this journey as a kind of training.</p><p>Feng Wuji and Ling Yanchi both nodded.</p><p>“Brother Feng, please help me tell my parents that I’m safe after you return!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I’ll definitely bring it!”</p><p>Feng Wuji nodded.</p><p>After that, Feng Wuji bade farewell to Ling Yanchi and Lu Ming and left for the blazing sun Empire.</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming was the only one left.</p><p>“I should also make a move!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and left the imperial capital of the cloud desolate Empire. He rose into the air and flew towards the West, disappearing into the horizon in an instant.</p><p>The cloud Emperor mountain range was located in the easternmost part of the Tianxuan region. It was extremely far from the myriad Star City and was separated by many regions.</p><p>Back when he was travelling from the blazing sun Empire to the imperial capital of the cloud desolate Empire, Lu Ming did not use his full speed because of Feng Wuji and Ling Yanchi. Now that he was alone, he used all his strength and his speed was shocking.</p><p>Countless mountains, rivers, and plateaus flashed past Lu Ming’s feet.</p><p>In just three days, Lu Ming had left the cloud Emperor mountain range and entered another area.</p><p>In the thousand River region.</p><p>The thousand River region was a region close to the cloud Emperor mountain range, and it was several times larger than the cloud Emperor mountain range. It was extremely wide and had given birth to hundreds of empires and countless people.</p><p>Among them, the strongest Empire was called the Qianjiang Empire. It was a high-level Empire and was extremely powerful.</p><p>Back then, Jian Fengyun had trained in the thousand River region.</p><p>The terrain of the thousand River region was completely different from the cloud Emperor mountain range.</p><p>The cloud Emperor mountain range had many mountains and steep terrain.</p><p>As for the thousand River region, the terrain was flat, and the rivers flowed rapidly. There were countless large rivers scattered across the vast land.</p><p>Lu Ming was standing in the sky above a large river, dumbfounded.</p><p>This was because the river was simply too wide.</p><p>Looking down from a height of ten thousand meters, the river was a hundred miles wide. If not for Lu Ming’s amazing eyesight, he would not be able to see the end.</p><p>As for its length, it was impossible to measure it with a naked eye.</p><p>On the river, many large ships sailed on the water.</p><p>“As expected, it has a different flavor!”</p><p>Looking at the vast River, Lu Ming felt his heart open and his mood was extremely comfortable.</p><p>The true Qi in his body also began to circulate rapidly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
