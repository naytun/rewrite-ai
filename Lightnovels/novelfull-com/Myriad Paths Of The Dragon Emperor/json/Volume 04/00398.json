You Feiyu thought she was dreaming.</p><p>...</p><p>brother, let me go. I beg you to let me go. I can give you everything I have!</p><p>You Feiyu shouted.</p><p>He didn’t want to die, he didn’t want to die at all. He was the strongest expert among the younger generation in the nether demon Palace. In the future, he would definitely inherit the position of the palace Master of the nether demon Palace and become the Overlord of a large region. He would rule over the vast mountains and rivers, hundreds of millions of citizens, and countless beauties. He could get whatever he wanted.</p><p>How could he bear to die when his bright future was right in front of him?</p><p>What was face compared to life?</p><p>“Let you go? After I kill you, all your belongings will still be mine.”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“No, don’t kill me. I know a treasure. If you let me go, I’ll tell you the address of the treasure.”</p><p>You Feiyu shouted.</p><p>On the side, Coldflow wood, ye Tiannan, and the others watched this scene with complicated feelings.</p><p>You Feiyu, who had been so high and mighty and controlled their life and death, was now begging for mercy like a pug in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>The world changed so quickly, it was really amazing.</p><p>This was the change brought about by strength.</p><p>In the world of martial Dao, the strong reigned Supreme. Only the strong could dominate everything.</p><p>It was no wonder that most of the Warriors were willing to risk their lives to improve their cultivation.</p><p>“Treasure?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. then tell me the address of the treasure! he said.</p><p>“Promise to let me go first, then I’ll tell you the location of the treasure.”</p><p>You Feiyu shouted, his eyes flickering.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming seemed to be interested in the treasure, hope was ignited in his heart. He was thinking about how to negotiate with Lu Ming.</p><p>But in the next moment-</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A ray of spear light shot out and pierced through you Feiyu’s heart. The powerful force crushed you Feiyu’s heart into pieces.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>You Feiyu let out a desperate roar. His eyes popped out like a dead fish, full of disbelief.</p><p>He could not figure out why Lu Ming wanted to kill him all of a sudden.</p><p>Wasn’t he already moved?</p><p>let’s not talk about whether what you said is true or whether there is such a treasure. Even if there is such a treasure, I will not let you go. I don’t want to leave behind future trouble for myself because of an unknown treasure.</p><p>A faint voice came out of Lu Ming’s mouth.</p><p>You Feiyu roared unwillingly and stopped breathing.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he killed the remaining disciples of the nether demon Palace. At the same time, he did not let go of the storage rings and blood essence.</p><p>On the side, Coldflow wood, ye Tiannan, and the others were dumbfounded.</p><p>“Lu … Brother Lu, thank you for your help!”</p><p>The Coldflow tree stepped forward and cupped its fists to thank Lu Ming.</p><p>“Nothing much? I just did it in passing!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently. Then, he walked toward the bronze Hall’s door.</p><p>Coldflow wood and the others watched from behind, not following.</p><p>Lu Ming walked to the door and waved his hand. Four keys appeared in his hands.</p><p>Lu Ming did not return it to the Coldflow wood and the rest. He had gotten it from you Feiyu and it naturally became his spoils of war. He was not so kind as to return it to the Coldflow wood and the rest.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The moment the four keys appeared, they aimed at the four statues and flew into their mouths.</p><p>Ka ka!</p><p>The door of the bronze Hall slowly opened, revealing the dark environment inside.</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate. In a flash, he rushed into the door and disappeared.</p><p>Behind them, Coldflow wood, ye Tiannan, and the others looked at the gate with uncertain expressions.</p><p>“Brother Han, should we go in?”</p><p>Ye Tiannan asked Coldflow wood.</p><p>Cold flowing Wood’s eyes flickered continuously as if he was hesitating. After a long while, he sighed and said,”You’ve all seen Lu Ming’s strength. It’s simply unfathomable. I reckon that he’s completely hidden his strength in his battle with the flying Ape. He’s definitely a top monster in some super region.”</p><p>the temper of such a person is unpredictable. If we enter and cause him to be unhappy, we’ll only be able to die in his anger!</p><p>Coldflow wood looked into the door, his eyes filled with fear.</p><p>“I agree with Brother Han’s opinion. We can’t afford to offend such a person. Let’s leave this place.”</p><p>Wuhui also said.</p><p>Ye Tiannan sighed. Although he was unwilling, there was nothing he could do.</p><p>Immediately, Coldflow wood and the others left the place one by one and went back. They also searched for any treasures left behind.</p><p>……</p><p>The bronze Hall was deathly silent.</p><p>After Lu Ming rushed through the door, he saw a large hall. There were some huge alchemy furnaces in the hall. However, all of these alchemy furnaces had been corroded and lost their spirituality.</p><p>Lu Ming walked around the hall but found nothing.</p><p>At the back of the hall, there was another bronze door that was closed.</p><p>Lu Ming pushed hard and the bronze door opened with a click. It did not need a key.</p><p>The bronze door opened and Lu Ming walked in.</p><p>This was a secret room, much smaller than the main hall.</p><p>There were two shelves on both sides, and on the shelves, there were some bottles.</p><p>In the middle of the room, there was an alchemy furnace. On one side, there was a table.</p><p>Lu Ming was the first to walk to the shelves and pick up the bottles and jars. Unfortunately, although there were pills inside, they had turned into ashes after being eroded by the passage of time.</p><p>All the pills and spirit herbs were useless.</p><p>Lu Ming was greatly disappointed. He walked towards the table again.</p><p>On the table, there were two items. One was a box. It was made of an unknown material, and it was still intact even after so many years.</p><p>Lu Ming picked up the box and opened it.</p><p>He was stunned.</p><p>There were dozens of crystals in the box. Each of them was about the size of a longan and was of many different colors.</p><p>There were yellow ones, blue ones, red ones, green ones …</p><p>The most important thing was that each of the crystals gave off a mysterious aura. It was similar to control force, but it was many times more mysterious.</p><p>Lu Ming reached out and picked up a fiery red crystal. He examined it carefully, then his body trembled slightly and his eyes were filled with ecstasy.</p><p>this is an intent crystal. Haha, this is definitely an intent crystal!</p><p>Lu Ming almost burst out laughing.</p><p>&Nbsp; he had never imagined that he would actually obtain intent crystals here, and dozens of them at that.</p><p>Power Upanishad crystals were born from the power Upanishads of heaven and earth. It would take a long time to produce one.</p><p>Intent crystals contained dense intent of heaven and earth that could be used to comprehend intent of heaven and earth.</p><p>After their force had reached the peak, they could quickly comprehend the true intent if they used the intent crystal. On the other hand, if a martial King used the intent crystal to cultivate, their comprehension of the intent would be greatly accelerated.</p><p>It could be said that intent crystals were treasures that even martial Kings would be envious of.</p><p>Profound meaning crystals were divided into various attributes, such as wind, fire, and lightning.</p><p>However, no matter what attribute they were, they could be sold for at least one billion lower spiritual crystals on the market.</p><p>That’s right, it was a billion spiritual crystals. The price was terrifying.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
