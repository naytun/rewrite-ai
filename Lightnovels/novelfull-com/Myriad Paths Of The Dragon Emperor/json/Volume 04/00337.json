It was already good enough that they didn’t have any enmity towards the ten direction sword sect. How could they have any loyalty? once they saw that the situation was not right, they naturally surrendered.</p><p>“We won’t kill those who surrender!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared loudly, his voice spreading throughout the entire area.</p><p>“We won’t kill those who surrender!”</p><p>Ming Meng, Hua Ying, and the others also shouted.</p><p>This time, even more people from the ghost iron army surrendered. Large numbers of people dismounted and knelt on the ground.</p><p>In the Army, the people from the omnipresent sword sect saw that they had lost the battle and wanted to escape. However, they were all killed by Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>In this battle, they had destroyed the ghost metal army of 100000 without much effort.</p><p>“Ming Meng, I’ll leave the surrendered ghost metal army to you. Bring them to the forgotten immortal pass, they will be a powerful force in the future.”</p><p>Lu Ming instructed.</p><p>“Yes, Lord Marquis!”</p><p>Ming Meng cupped his fists and accepted the order.</p><p>At the side, the three siblings, Ming Cheng, Ming Zhu, and Ming Feng, had complicated expressions on their faces. This young man who used to cultivate with them in the general stars Hall had now completely surpassed them. Even their father had to listen to Lu Ming now.</p><p>However, they did not feel jealous at all. They were only happy for Lu Ming and encouraged themselves.</p><p>“Blood red Cavalry, come with me to the capital and save the eighth prince. Do you dare?”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his long spear and shouted.</p><p>“I dare! He dared! I dare!”</p><p>The 30,000 blood red Cavalry roared.</p><p>“Alright, since you dare, then we’ll break through all the obstacles and kill our way to the imperial capital. We’ll kill any God or Buddha that blocks our way!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared.</p><p>“I’m willing to chase whoever my Lord is, I’ll kill whoever stands in my way, even if God or Buddha blocks my way!”</p><p>The 30 thousand blood red iron cavalry felt their blood boil as they waved their weapons and roared.</p><p>At this moment, even Ming Meng, who had been a veteran for many years, felt his blood burning. He could not wait to follow Lu Ming and kill to his heart’s content.</p><p>However, he knew that he had more important things to do.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his spear. The bloodscaled Wolf King howled and charged forward like a gust of wind.</p><p>On the side, Qiu Yue, Xie nianqing, Yan Quan, and the Golden-eyed blood corpse followed closely behind.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>The howls of the wolves continued as the 30000 blood red Cavalry charged forward with Lu Ming, carrying a crazed aura.</p><p>“The wind is blowing!”</p><p>Ming Meng muttered to himself as he looked at the 30000 blood red Cavalry.</p><p>After which, he also started to move. He gathered his men and picked out his items. Then, he led an Army of more than 100000 soldiers toward the gazing immortal pass.</p><p>The bloodred scaled Wolf’s speed was as fast as the wind, and it could easily travel a thousand miles in an hour.</p><p>In a few hours, they had galloped for thousands of miles. The cities along the way did not dare to stop the blood red Cavalry when they saw them.</p><p>The journey was unimpeded, and they passed through dozens of big cities. Soon, they were close to Yu Tong Pass.</p><p>Yu Tong Pass was a famous pass in the North of the burning sun Empire.</p><p>This place was surrounded by continuous precipitous mountains, thousands of meters high, and Yutong pass happened to be in the middle of the two peaks.</p><p>It could be said that on Yu Tong Pass, one man could hold the pass, but ten thousand could not open it.</p><p>In history, the yin Yue Empire had also captured many cities in the North, but they were all blocked outside Yu Tong Pass.</p><p>Now, the general in charge of Yu Tong Pass was called Wan Xiu. His cultivation was at the sixth level of the martial arts Grandmaster realm. He led 120000 soldiers and guarded Yu Tong Pass. He ruled over dozens of big cities in the vicinity. He could be said to be a Big Shot with great power.</p><p>Moreover, he had long since joined the ten direction Sword School. As such, his reputation had grown even more glorious, and he was considered a top figure in the entire blazing sun Empire.</p><p>Wan Xiu had a hobby, which was to hold banquets on the walls of Yu Tong Pass and invite famous people.</p><p>Standing on the walls of Yutong pass, looking down at the vast land and listening to others ‘flattery, he felt like he was the king of the world and had thousands of miles of mountains and rivers.</p><p>He was fascinated by this feeling.</p><p>Today, on the city wall of Yu Tong Pass, he set up a banquet and invited the city Lords and martial arts powerhouses of more than a dozen nearby big cities to attend.</p><p>On the city wall, there were several tables.</p><p>congratulations, general Wan! Congratulations, general Wan!</p><p>A middle-aged man with a big belly raised his glass and congratulated Wan Xiu.</p><p>“Patriarch Shen, what’s the joy?”</p><p>Wan Xiu asked despite knowing the answer.</p><p>haha, general Wan is really humble. Everyone knows the current situation. A while ago, the ten directions Sword School destroyed the ghost moon saber sect in one fell swoop. A few days ago, the Heavenly King broke into the imperial capital and killed Hua Zhengxing. Now, the change of dynasty is already set in stone.</p><p>now, the heavenly fiend sect and the omnipresent sword sect have joined forces and occupied the imperial capital, ruling the world. Now, only the mystical sword sect and the Crimson Cloud Valley can rival the omnipresent sword sect. However, in my opinion, the mystical sword sect and the Crimson Cloud Valley are no match for the omnipresent sword sect. By then, the omnipresent sword sect will unify the blazing sun Empire and rule the world. General Wan, as the confidant of the omnipresent sword sect, Won’t You Be thriving? isn’t this worthy of congratulations? ”</p><p>The big-bellied middle-aged man laughed.</p><p>“That’s right, patriarch Chen is right. When general Wan rises to the top, don’t forget about us.”</p><p>At the banquet, the others also began to flatter him.</p><p>This made Wan Xiu feel a little smug. She stroked her sparse beard and grinned from ear to ear.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Suddenly, the ground let out a deep rumble.</p><p>The wine on the table started to shake.</p><p>Everyone’s expression changed.</p><p>“Report!”</p><p>At this moment, an armored soldier quickly came to report.</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>Wan Xiu asked.</p><p>“Reporting to the general! There might be an Army coming from the north!”</p><p>The armored soldier reported.</p><p>“An Army is coming? How was that possible? The ghostmoon saber sect has already been destroyed, and the North is now completely under the control of the ten direction sword sect. Could it be the great army of the yin moon Empire?”</p><p>Wan Xiu’s eyes moved as she thought.</p><p>impossible. I heard that the yin Yue Empire and the Shi Fang Sword School have an agreement that they won’t attack us now. Whose Army is it? ”</p><p>Wan Xiu’s eyes kept moving.</p><p>general Wan, there’s another army in the North. It’s the red blood Legion led by Marquis champion tianyun and Ming Meng’s Mountain-suppressing Army. Could it be them? ”</p><p>A city Lord of a big city guessed.</p><p>As soon as he said that, the others ‘expressions changed drastically.</p><p>“Tianyun? Could it really be tianyun? it’s said that the blood red Cavalry led by tianyun are incredibly powerful and invincible. In front of them, the yinyue cavalry are as fragile as tofu. If it really is tianyun’s blood red Cavalry, then we should run for our lives!”</p><p>Another city Lord cried out in fear.</p><p>“Why are you panicking? In my opinion, tianyun and his blood red Cavalry have been exaggerated. What ‘invincible’? they’ve only won a few battles by luck.”</p><p>“Besides, so what if he’s really as strong as the rumors say? Tianyun’s blood red iron cavalry can only obediently retreat in front of our Jade Tong Pass. If he wants to force his way in, I’ll make sure he dies without a burial ground. Men, set up the defense!”</p><p>Wan Xiu was calm and composed. She sneered and then gave the order.</p><p>Very quickly, Yu Tong Pass was filled with armored soldiers.</p><p>“That’s right, Yu Tong Pass can’t be broken. I’ve been overthinking.”</p><p>The city Lord heaved a long sigh of relief.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The rumbling grew even louder, and the entire world seemed to be shaking.</p><p>OWW! OWW!</p><p>In the distance, the howls of wolves rose and fell, connecting into one.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
