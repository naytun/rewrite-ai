There was no need to fight. If they stayed here, they would definitely die.</p><p>After the mo family head finished shouting, he turned into a ray of light and fled into the distance.</p><p>“No one can escape if they want to!”</p><p>Yan Quan roared and was the first to chase after the mo family head.</p><p>Within a few breaths, he had caught up to the mo family head.</p><p>“Flame spring!”</p><p>The head of the mo family roared in shock and launched a frenzied counterattack.</p><p>However, the difference between a normal martial ancestor realm warrior and a half-step King was extremely obvious. In just a few moves, the head of the mo family was already coughing up blood.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Yan Quan shouted as he grabbed the head of the mo family’s head and twisted it off.</p><p>“Hahaha, kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>Yan Quan laughed and continued to chase after the others.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>On the other side, Lu Ming’s long spear kept stabbing out. The Spear’s radiance burst out and a few mo family Warriors in the third and fourth grade martial arts Grandmaster realm were pierced into sieves.</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood zombie moved around and its body flashed rapidly. It waved its claws and tore the mo clan martial arts grandmasters into pieces.</p><p>This was a massacre. In front of the Golden-eyed blood corpse and Yan Quan, the many Wu Zongs of the mo clan were as weak as babies, unable to resist at all.</p><p>Even if they managed to escape, they would be caught and killed.</p><p>Lu Ming did not feel sorry for her.</p><p>The yin Yue Empire and the blazing sun Empire were at war. They were enemies.</p><p>Moreover, it was the Mohist who wanted his life first. Since they were mortal enemies, there was no need to show mercy. Being kind to the enemy was being cruel to oneself.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming held his long spear and fought a bloody battle.</p><p>Now that he had broken through to the fourth level of the martial ancestor realm, any martial artist below the ninth level of the martial ancestor realm would not pose much of a threat to him.</p><p>“Little bastard, even if I die, I’ll drag you down with me!”</p><p>A seventh grade martial arts Grandmaster elder from the mo family roared and charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons roared, and the terrifying devouring power acted on the old man’s body, causing his body to slow down slightly.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming dashed past him and the long spear pierced through his heart, blasting a huge hole.</p><p>Killed in one move!</p><p>Then, the blood essence and the power of the bloodline all flew into the mouth of the nine Dragons.</p><p>In the sky above the mo family, screams rose and fell.</p><p>Not far away, the mo family’s martial masters, Warriors, and even those with lower cultivation bases were fleeing in all directions.</p><p>Lu Ming did not kill these people.</p><p>These people did not see the evolution of Lu Ming’s Blood Meridian. They were not a threat to him and there was no need to kill them.</p><p>At this moment, su Tiancheng fell into a deathly silence. Countless people hid in their homes, shivering.</p><p>After a while, the screams stopped.</p><p>The dozens of martial arts grandmasters from the mo family were all killed.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood corpse howled as its blood Qi rose. Its body was red, but its eyes were even more golden.</p><p>Mo Ying stood there in a daze and looked around. The corpses reflected in her eyes, and her eyes were extremely complicated.</p><p>In this short period of time, her life had experienced a tremendous change.</p><p>These people used to be the elders of the family whom she respected, but now she suddenly found out that they were just using her.</p><p>For a moment, she really found it hard to bear.</p><p>Lu Ming did not say anything. He just stood there quietly.</p><p>“Miss mo Ying, I’m leaving. What are your plans?” Lu Ming spoke after a while.</p><p>Although mo Ying had also seen his bloodline evolution, he could not kill mo Ying to silence her.</p><p>Mo Ying’s body trembled as if she had come back to her senses. She squeezed out an ugly smile and said, ” “Brother Lu, I’m planning to leave the yin Yue Empire and travel the world,”</p><p>“That’s good!” Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Lu Ming knew that mo Ying more or less held a grudge against him.</p><p>No matter what, mo Ying was a member of the mo family and Lu Ming had killed so many of their members. It was normal for mo Ying to bear a grudge against him.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming did not invite mo Ying to go with him.</p><p>“Brother Lu, I’ll see you again if fate allows it!”</p><p>Mo Ying said softly. She glanced at the mo family, then turned into a rainbow light and disappeared into the sky.</p><p>“Haha, little brother, I can’t bear to.”</p><p>At this moment, Yan Quan appeared beside Lu Ming.</p><p>“No, I’m just sighing. Sometimes, fate is really unpredictable!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>that’s right. Fate is unpredictable, so we must cultivate martial arts to break the shackles of fate and fight against the heavens!</p><p>Yan Quan grinned and immediately said, little brother, it’s all thanks to your help that I was able to escape this time. If you have any requests, just tell me. As long as it’s within my power, I’ll definitely do my best.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and smiled. you’re too kind, senior. It was just a coincidence.</p><p>“That won’t do. I’ve always been a person who repays kindness with kindness and hatred with hatred. Otherwise, I wouldn’t feel at ease. This time, it’s all thanks to you. Otherwise, not only would I not be able to get out of this trap, but I would also be refined into a Yin moon demonic chief and be trapped in it forever. This is a great favor that I have to repay!”</p><p>Yan Quan stubbornly said.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>To be honest, Yan Quan’s combat power was extremely strong. It would be a lie to say that he didn’t want to ask Yan Quan for help.</p><p>“Senior, please stay by my side and help me for a while. Is that possible?” Lu Ming said after a moment of silence.</p><p>“Okay, then I’ll stay by your side and help you for ten years. After ten years, we’ll be even. How about it?” he said.</p><p>Yan Quan opened his mouth and said.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He hurriedly cupped his fists and said,”Many thanks, senior.”</p><p>The current situation in the blazing sun Empire was complicated. With Yan Quan’s help and the Golden-eyed blood corpse, Lu Ming finally had the ability to protect himself. He could then become a true Overlord in the blazing sun Empire and have the power to compete with the omnidirectional Sword School.</p><p>One had to know that in the blazing sun Empire, half-step Kings were the strongest.</p><p>The blazing sun Empire had not produced a true king for hundreds of years.</p><p>Yan Quan grinned.</p><p>In fact, Yan Quan was also very curious about Lu Ming. He was so young, but not only was he very powerful, but he also had a powerful existence like the Golden-eyed blood zombie by his side.</p><p>Yan Quan had lived for many years, but this was the first time he had encountered such a thing.</p><p>“Senior, to tell you the truth, I’m not from the yin Yue Empire, but from the blazing sun Empire. Moreover, the blazing sun and Yin Yue empires are currently at war. I wonder if senior would mind?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“A war between two countries? The royal family of the Dark Moon Empire is despicable and tried to harm me. I’m going to get even with them. I’m going to the blazing sun Empire and kill the experts of the Dark Moon Empire. That’s what I want!”</p><p>Yan Quan laughed.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Soon after, he, the Golden-eyed blood corpse and Yan Quan turned into a rainbow and disappeared in the direction of the Moonview city.</p><p>On the way, Lu Ming briefly explained his identity and the current situation.</p><p>Lu Ming also had a rough idea of the experience at the flame spring.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
