It would be better to leave earlier.</p><p>...</p><p>“Brother song, what are your plans?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Song Yu and Song Jing.</p><p>“After leaving the city, I’m sure he’ll be in trouble at night. I believe in brother Lu!”</p><p>Song Yu said firmly, planning to stay behind. Song Jing nodded and followed Song Yu.</p><p>“Alright then, you guys should rest first!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. He then randomly found a room in the city and sat cross-legged.</p><p>Recently, his understanding of the heaven path palm had become deeper and deeper, and he felt that he could make a breakthrough at any time.</p><p>Once he had a breakthrough in the heaven path palm, he would have another killer move.</p><p>In his mind, the aura that he had remembered from the Heaven’s Gate kept flowing.</p><p>He did not know why, but as time passed, the aura became weaker and weaker. It was estimated that Lu Ming would forget about the aura soon.</p><p>Yes, he had forgotten. He had disappeared from his memory.</p><p>Therefore, he had to master the heavenly path palm within this period of time.</p><p>Lu Ming closed his eyes and continued to comprehend.</p><p>The aura on the heaven Gate and the heavenly path palm were constantly corroborating and deliberating with each other.</p><p>Lu Ming’s understanding of the heavenly palm was getting deeper and deeper.</p><p>He felt that there was only a layer of paper between them. As long as he could break through this layer of paper, Lu Ming would be able to successfully cultivate the heavenly Dao palm.</p><p>Time passed, and night slowly fell.</p><p>Heaven and earth fell into darkness once again, and the sky was filled with dark clouds.</p><p>Gah gah gah …</p><p>In the outside world, strange cries were constantly heard. It was abnormally terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming ended his cultivation and walked out of his room. He looked into the distance and could see many black shadows flickering outside the city.</p><p>However, the city emitted a layer of hazy light, like a semi-circle, which enveloped the entire city.</p><p>The spirits seemed to be very afraid of this light. They were wandering outside and didn’t dare to rush in.</p><p>These radiances were formed by the inscription formation.</p><p>The Supreme experts of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace had all set up Supreme formations in all the cities in the ancient battlefield of the netherworld to facilitate the smooth progress of the selection.</p><p>Lu Ming saw that in the city, other than Song Yu and Song Jing, there were still a few people who had not left, including the burly young man. He had returned.</p><p>He saw Lu Ming and smiled brightly.</p><p>Lu Ming watched for a while and returned to his room to start comprehending the heavenly Dao palm.</p><p>Very soon, a day had passed. When night came the next day, Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly flashed.</p><p>He had finally made a major breakthrough in his comprehension of the heaven’s path palm.</p><p>He felt that he had successfully comprehended it.</p><p>“I’ll go out and test it out during the day!”</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming continued to comprehend and deepen his understanding of the heavenly path palm.</p><p>Time passed, and soon, the darkness receded, and light returned to the world.</p><p>Lu Ming left the city and flew into the distance. Very soon, he arrived at a huge mountain.</p><p>“Heaven’s path palm!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming shouted and slapped his palm towards the sky.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>An invisible wave spread out from Lu Ming’s palm. Then, a huge palm print was formed in the sky.</p><p>This palm print was transparent, like a human palm, but it had nine fingers.</p><p>The palm print was dozens of meters long and wide. It came down from the sky and hit a mountain peak that was a thousand meters tall.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With an earth-shattering boom, the thousand-meter mountain exploded. All the trees and stones were annihilated and turned into dust.</p><p>It didn’t explode into gravel, but was directly annihilated.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a thousand-meter tall mountain was gone.</p><p>“What a powerful force!”</p><p>Even Lu Ming himself was somewhat dumbfounded.</p><p>The three path Palm’s Secret book recorded the third palm, the heaven path palm. Since ancient times, only a few people had been able to master it. Once it was mastered, it would have the power infinitely close to that of a heaven grade martial technique. Moreover, it was not the first or second level, but the strongest power could be directly displayed.</p><p>haha, the power of the heavenly path palm has completely surpassed the first step of the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps. It has become my strongest killing move.</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily.</p><p>Unless Lu Ming cultivated the second step of the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps, he would not be able to surpass the power of the heavenly way palm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming started to cultivate again.</p><p>Each palm was extremely powerful. A hundred-meter-deep pit appeared on the ground. When it hit the mountain, the mountain exploded and disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to strike more than ten times before he stopped.</p><p>As the heavenly path palm consumed too much energy, with Lu Ming’s current cultivation, he could only unleash a dozen palm strikes before his essential Qi ran out.</p><p>Lu Ming took out a pile of spiritual crystals and absorbed their energy to recover his essential Qi.</p><p>Two hours later, Lu Ming’s essential Qi had completely recovered.</p><p>“Let’s go back to the city and figure it out!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>With a flash, he flew back to the city.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>When they were still some distance away from the city, a miserable scream came from the distance.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed, and he sped towards the city.</p><p>At this moment, there were eight more figures in the city.</p><p>Each one of them was wearing a black skeleton robe.</p><p>One of them was pale and had lost an arm. He was the man who had escaped from Lu Ming two days ago.</p><p>These were all experts from the nether demon Palace.</p><p>As for Song Yu, Song Jing, the burly young man and the other five people who remained in the city, they were all captured by the people from the nether demon Palace.</p><p>One of them had one of his arms cut off by a young man from the you mo Palace. The scream just now was from him.</p><p>“Speak, where did that little bastard go?”</p><p>The young man who had escaped two days ago had a cold expression on his face. He stared at Song Yu and the others like a fierce ghost.</p><p>I really don’t know. He was still here this morning, but he went out after that. I beg you, please let me go!</p><p>The youth whose arm had been cut off shrieked miserably.</p><p>“I’ll let you go. You were there in the battle two days ago. Since you were there, why didn’t you help us kill that bastard? you saw it. If you don’t help us, you’ll be sentenced to death!”</p><p>The face of the escaping disciple of the nether demon Palace turned cold. With a slash of his sword, the head of the young man flew off.</p><p>The faces of Song Yu, Song Jing, and the others were as pale as paper.</p><p>“The two of you are in cahoots with that beast. Don’t worry, the two of you won’t die so easily. I’ll let the two of you taste the greatest pain in the world before I let you die!”</p><p>The escaping disciple of the nether demon Palace said coldly.</p><p>On the side, the other seven disciples of the nether demon Palace looked on coldly. Their eyes were extremely cold.</p><p>Song Yu and Song Jing were trembling in fear.</p><p>haha, are you afraid now? if you’re afraid, then quickly think of a way to call that little bastard back.</p><p>The escapeed nether demon Palace disciple laughed madly.</p><p>“No need to shout, I’m here!”</p><p>Suddenly, a cold voice came from the sky.</p><p>Everyone hurriedly looked up.</p><p>Lu Ming stood high up in the sky and looked down. His expression was extremely cold, and his eyes were as cold as ice.</p><p>He did not expect that the people from the nether demon Palace would arrive so soon after he went out to cultivate.</p><p>“Little bastard, you’re finally back.”</p><p>After the escaping disciple of the nether demon Palace was stunned for a moment, he revealed an extremely ferocious expression.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
