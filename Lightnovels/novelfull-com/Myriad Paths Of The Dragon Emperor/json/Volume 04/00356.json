He had reached the third tier of the martial ancestor realm at such a young age. He was definitely an elite that the blue blade family had nurtured with great care. His combat strength was definitely not something that ordinary martial artists of the same realm could compare to.</p><p>However, in the hands of Xie nianqing, he couldn’t even last one move.</p><p>Many people didn’t even see when Xie nianqing made his move.</p><p>Only a small number of geniuses focused their eyes and saw how Xie nianqing attacked.</p><p>“Little b * tch, how dare you hit a member of the blue blade family! You’re looking for death! Attack! Let’s attack together! Take this b * tch down and torture him!”</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The remaining three blue-robed young men roared as powerful auras erupted from their bodies.</p><p>Each of them had the cultivation of the third level of the martial ancestor realm. When the three of them joined forces, their power was terrifying.</p><p>Feng Wuji’s and Ling Yanchi’s expressions changed. They were about to help, but Lu Ming smiled at them, telling them not to worry.</p><p>“Slap his mouth!”</p><p>At this moment, Xie nianqing shouted and waved his hands. Black lotuses appeared one after another. Then, the black petals broke the three young men’s attacks like divine blades.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Xie nianqing moved and appeared in front of the three young men. He extended his palm.</p><p>Pa! Pa! Pa!</p><p>Three loud slaps were heard and the three blue-robed young men were sent flying.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Before the three young men could land on the ground, Xie nianqing waved his hand and lotus petals flew towards the legs of the three young men.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>A furious shout came from the private room.</p><p>However, Xie nianqing didn’t care at all. The black petals didn’t stop.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>The black petals all hit the legs of the three blue-robed young men. By the time they fell to the ground, their legs were already covered in blood and wounds. Even their bones could be seen.</p><p>Si si …</p><p>Gasps could be heard all around.</p><p>What a powerful battle strength, what a ruthless method.</p><p>If he said he would break their legs, he would immediately break their legs.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this time, the sound of something breaking through the air was heard. A blue figure rushed out of the private room and appeared in the hall.</p><p>The young man looked to be around 23 or 24 years old. He was wearing a sky-blue tight-fitting robe, a blue jade belt around his waist, and a pair of blue and gold combat boots. He was full of luxury.</p><p>However, his face was as dark as winter.</p><p>“LAN Yunfei, it’s really him.”</p><p>“It’s over. That woman is finished. Even her companions are dead for sure. He even dared to beat up the people of the blue blade family. LAN Yunfei will never stop!”</p><p>although LAN Yunfei didn’t enter the cloud Emperor board, he is very close to it. I heard that he has already said that he will definitely enter the cloud Emperor board this time.</p><p>“Besides the geniuses on the cloud Emperor ranking, there are only a handful of people who can fight with LAN Yunfei.”</p><p>The other people in the restaurant looked at Xie nianqing, including Lu Ming, as if they were looking at a dead man.</p><p>“I told you to stop, didn’t you hear me?”</p><p>LAN Yunfei looked at Xie nianqing coldly. A hint of surprise flashed in his eyes.</p><p>He didn’t get a good look when he was in the room, but now that he got a closer look, he realized that Xie nianqing was even more stunning.</p><p>“I did, but Who are you? Do I have to do as I’m told?”</p><p>Xie nianqing looked at LAN Yunfei with disdain.</p><p>“Do you know the consequences of not following my orders? If I attack, I’ll either die or be injured!”</p><p>LAN Yunfei sneered and continued,”But I’ll let you go since you’re a woman. How about this, I’ll lock up the three of them first, and you’ll come back with me to serve me. If you’re comfortable with it, I’ll consider letting you go. This condition is already the biggest concession I can make.”</p><p>As LAN Yunfei spoke, his eyes flashed with lust as he scanned Xie nianqing’s body.</p><p>Xie nianqing frowned.</p><p>Lu Ming, Feng Wuji, and Ling Yanchi were all dumbfounded.</p><p>Is there something wrong with this brother?</p><p>Didn’t he see that there were four of them now, while he was alone?</p><p>He even said that they would be locked up first and asked Xie nianqing to go back and serve him. Wasn’t he too full of himself?</p><p>Lu Ming had seen many people who felt good about themselves. However, the man in front of him was definitely ranked first.</p><p>brother Feng, brother Ling, why do you think I’m so unlucky? why do I have to run into idiots everywhere I go? I’m just having a meal, and I’m actually able to run into such a weird idiot. I’m speechless.</p><p>Lu Ming picked up a glass of wine and downed it in one gulp, sighing and groaning.</p><p>Feng Wuji and Ling Yanchi looked at each other and did not say a word. They were not as bold as Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>Lu Ming did not lower his voice and it spread throughout the entire floor of the restaurant.</p><p>The scene fell into a dead silence. Everyone looked at Lu Ming in a daze.</p><p>Lu Ming actually dared to say that about LAN Yunfei?</p><p>How could these people of the burning sun Empire be so arrogant?</p><p>“He’s really a country bumpkin who doesn’t know the immensity of heaven and earth.”</p><p>Many people thought.</p><p>“Kid, who are you talking about?”</p><p>LAN Yunfei let out a furious shriek. His facial features were contorted and he looked at Lu Ming with an extremely sinister expression.</p><p>“I’ll say who answered.”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to hold up his wine glass and replied indifferently. He then drank the wine in one gulp.</p><p>you’re looking for death, you’re looking for death. Now, I take back what I just said. You’re dead. No condition can save you.</p><p>LAN Yunfei bellowed in rage. A powerful aura burst out from his body. A ray of sword light rushed up and slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“I’m your opponent!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes turned cold. She waved her hands and a Black Lotus appeared in front of the sword radiance.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The sword light struck the Black Lotus flower, causing sparks to fly in all directions. The sword light was blocked.</p><p>“If you dare to stop me, I’ll kill you as well!”</p><p>LAN Yunfei was completely enraged. His killing intent rose. His sword hummed softly and beams of sharp sword Qi shot towards Xie nianqing.</p><p>He was at the peak of the 4th level of the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>LAN Yunfei’s cultivation had already reached the peak of the fourth level martial ancestor realm. No wonder he was second only to the geniuses on the cloud Emperor ranking.</p><p>On the cloud Emperor ranking, the few people who were ranked at the bottom were only at the early stage of the fifth level of the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>“Who can you kill?”</p><p>Xie nianqing sneered as a powerful aura burst out from his body.</p><p>Martial ancestor 4-dan later stage.</p><p>During this period of time, Xie nianqing’s progress was also extremely shocking. He fully utilized the advantage of a seventh level King bloodline.</p><p>“Great demonic palm!”</p><p>Xie nianqing waved his hands and sent out palm prints towards LAN Yunfei.</p><p>He didn’t know what level Xie nianqing’s martial technique was. When she was a martial Grandmaster, she used the same martial technique. Now that she was a martial ancestor, she was using the same martial technique.</p><p>Moreover, as Xie nianqing’s cultivation level increased, the power of this martial skill became more and more terrifying.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In an instant, the palm print and the sword light collided eight times in a row, producing eight loud bangs.</p><p>Of course, in their moves, they had deliberately compressed their true energy and did not let it spread out. Otherwise, the entire restaurant would have been blown up.</p><p>To be able to build such a huge restaurant in the cloud desolate Empire’s imperial capital was not something an ordinary person could do. If he blew it up, it would probably be hard to explain.</p><p>After eight moves, LAN Yunfei retreated eight steps.</p><p>He was completely at a disadvantage.</p><p>The other people in the restaurant were dumbfounded.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
