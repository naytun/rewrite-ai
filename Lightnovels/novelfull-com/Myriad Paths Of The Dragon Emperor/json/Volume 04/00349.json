There seemed to be some words on it, but they were blurry and unclear. It seemed very mysterious.</p><p>Moreover, up until now, the second bloodline did not seem to have any other magical effects other than increasing Lu Ming’s combat strength when he activated it.</p><p>This was not in line with the level of King-level bloodline.</p><p>Lu Ming speculated that this might be because the level of the blood Meridian was still too low. As long as the level of the blood Meridian increased, the second blood Meridian would definitely show some power.</p><p>A huge stone tablet emerged, and surging blood essence energy was constantly injected into the stone tablet.</p><p>However, his second bloodline was now at the fourth level of the king tier. The amount of blood essence energy required to upgrade it was too much.</p><p>One drop, two drops …</p><p>After refining a total of seven drops, his second bloodline had only advanced to the limit of the fourth tier of the king level.</p><p>Next, Lu Ming refined two more drops in a row. Unfortunately, the second blood Meridian did not improve. It was still at the limit of the fourth level of the king tier.</p><p>right now, the increase in bloodline level is too slow. Even a half step King can only increase it by this little bit. Usually, eighth or seventh stage martial ancestors have little effect, and ninth stage martial ancestors have a better effect.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart and was rather speechless.</p><p>He really didn’t know what kind of blood essence he would need to continue upgrading.</p><p>Martial King realm?</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming was somewhat speechless.</p><p>a day has passed. Let’s go out and see the situation.</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming left the Supreme shrine.</p><p>After he came out, he received news that Lin Xueyi and the others had returned.</p><p>“So fast?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little surprised. Yan Quan then told him what had happened.</p><p>It turned out that when Lin Xueyi and the others rushed to the Crimson Cloud Valley without stopping, they actually met the people of the Crimson Cloud Valley on the way.</p><p>They were on their way to the mystical sword sect.</p><p>When the two sides met, they found out that the ten direction Sword School and the heaven fiend school had indeed sent a large number of experts to besiege the Crimson Cloud Valley.</p><p>However, the Scarlet heaven Valley had not been infiltrated by the ten directions Sword School. How could it be so easy to break through when the top and bottom were united?</p><p>However, the people of the Crimson Cloud Valley could not come out either. They were blocked and could not help the mystical sword sect.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after two days, the ten direction sword sect and the heavenfiend sect suddenly retreated. Only then did the Crimson Cloud Valley send people to the mystical sword sect for help.</p><p>Everyone guessed that the Masters besieging the Crimson Cloud Valley retreated because the ten direction sword sect had suffered a crushing defeat at the mystical sword sect.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. It was a great thing that the Crimson Cloud Valley was fine.</p><p>After Lu Ming and Yan Quan chatted for a while, Lin Xueyi sent someone to invite him to discuss some matters.</p><p>This time, of course, they were discussing their next move.</p><p>After the discussion, the mystical sword sect began to gather the various armies and experts around the mystical sword sect.</p><p>The same was true for the Crimson Cloud Valley.</p><p>Five days later, Hua Chi and Ming Meng led their armies to the mystical sword sect.</p><p>Naturally, Lu Yuntian and Li Ping were there as well.</p><p>Lu Ming arranged for Lu Yuntian and Li Ping to stay in the mystical sword sect.</p><p>This way, as long as the mystical sword sect remained standing, Lu Yuntian and Li Ping would be safe.</p><p>On the second day of Hua Chi’s arrival, he announced it to the world as a legitimate member of the royal family.</p><p>In the announcement, Hua Chi pointed out that Heavenly King Zhen had colluded with the ten direction sword sect and heavenly fiend sect to usurp the throne, kill the burning sun Emperor Hua Zhengxing, and slaughter the entire royal family. It was a great treasonous act and everyone had the right to punish him.</p><p>Therefore, they gathered all the righteous men in the world to attack Heavenly King Zhen, Shi Fang Sword School, and Tian Sha sect.</p><p>When the announcement was made, Lu Ming was the first to respond. He was willing to lead an Army to attack the omnipresent sword sect.</p><p>The Marquis champion and the blood red iron cavalry were the first to respond, and the world was shaken. Following that, the supporters gathered.</p><p>Needless to say, all the armies and forces in the mystical sword sect and the Crimson Cloud Valley’s territories obeyed their orders.</p><p>Many of the Imperial Army’s troops also rushed to the mystical sword sect’s territory in response to Hua Chi’s call.</p><p>Half a month later, Hua Chi had gathered an Army of nearly a million.</p><p>At this time, the mystical sword sect was located in the eastern part of the blazing sun Empire, forming a triangular formation with the Crimson Cloud Valley in the southern part of the blazing sun Empire. Together with Hua Chi’s Army, their strength was unprecedented.</p><p>At the same time, the ten direction sword sect and the heavenfiend sect also made their move. They gathered their armies and began to attack.</p><p>The two forces started a life-and-death battle.</p><p>This battle lasted for a month.</p><p>The blazing sun Empire did not have a true martial King. The strongest was a half-step King, so the battle between the two sides was not one-sided.</p><p>Although the omnidirectional sword sect and the malevolent sky sect were slightly stronger than the mystical sword sect, the Crimson Cloud Valley, and Lu Ming, they were still too weak.</p><p>However, since Lu Ming had brought Yan Quan and the Golden-eyed blood corpse, they were not at a disadvantage in terms of half step King Warriors. Even if the ten direction Sword School was slightly stronger, it was not by much. It was impossible to defeat Lu Ming’s side in a short time.</p><p>The two sides were in a stalemate. The total number of soldiers on both sides exceeded eight million, and there were constant small and big battles.</p><p>During this time, the blood red Cavalry were extremely eye-catching and had won every battle. They had made great contributions, causing the expressions of the ten direction sword sect to change.</p><p>However, there was a flaw, and that was that there were too few of them. There were only 30000 of them, and as the battle continued, their numbers would decrease. In a battle with millions of soldiers, it was difficult to establish a decisive advantage.</p><p>……</p><p>In the dark Moon Empire, in the South vanquishing Prince’s Mansion.</p><p>A group of people were discussing some matters.</p><p>The Duke of the South, Yin tianjue, was missing an arm. He sat at the head of the table with a gloomy expression, as if he was in deep thought.</p><p>“Your Royal Highness, why didn’t we send troops to aid the ten direction sword sect and destroy the mystical sword sect, Crimson Cloud Valley, and Lu Ming in one fell swoop?”</p><p>One of the generals asked.</p><p>“Help the ten direction sword sect? What good would that do us?”</p><p>Duke Zhennan sneered coldly, as if he had everything under control.”Isn’t it good like this? The internal battle of the ten directional Sword School will exhaust each other. When both sides have suffered heavy losses, we will lead the Army and wipe out the burning sun Empire in one fell swoop. The entire burning sun Empire will come under our command.”</p><p>“Your Highness is wise!”</p><p>……</p><p>In the conference hall of Shifang mountain.</p><p>There were dozens of people in the hall. They were all the upper echelons of the ten direction sword sect and heavenly fiend sect. Heavenly King Zhen and Qiu Wuyang were also among them.</p><p>Qiu Wuyang was sitting at the head of the table.</p><p>“How’s the situation now?”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang asked.</p><p>“Sect leader, right now the two armies are at war with each other. Neither side can truly suppress the other.”</p><p>A golden-robed elder of the ten directions Sword School reported.</p><p>and the other party is very cunning and heavily guarded. We’ve repeatedly sent assassins to assassinate their experts, but they’ve discovered us in advance and killed the assassins we sent!</p><p>Another gold-robed elder reported.</p><p>that’s right. The most difficult to deal with was Lu Ming’s blood red iron cavalry. They caused a lot of casualties on our side.</p><p>The gold-robed elder from before sighed.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Qiu Wuyang slammed the table with a gloomy face and shouted, ” “Lu Ming, Lu Ming again!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
