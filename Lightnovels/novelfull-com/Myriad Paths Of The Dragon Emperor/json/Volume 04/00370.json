Then, there was a burst of intense discussion.</p><p>...</p><p>“Who is this person? He could actually walk to the 300-meter area? He actually dared to walk into the 300-meter area? Is he not afraid that li autumn water will kill him?”</p><p>could this person be a genius in the thousand rivers top 100? ”</p><p>I don’t know. I’ve never seen this person before. I’ve never seen him before in the top 100 ranking of the Emperor sky divine guards ‘qualifying round. He shouldn’t be a genius on the thousand rivers top 100 ranking!</p><p>Many people were whispering and looking at Lu Ming curiously.</p><p>Autumn water’s face darkened and she looked at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>“Brat, this isn’t a place you should stay. If you don’t want to die, get out of here.”</p><p>Li qiushui said coldly.</p><p>Letting the red-haired water demon set foot in this area already made him very angry. Now, another person had actually come, and he was so young.</p><p>hehe, every time you open your mouth, you ask people to get lost. I want to know what kind of expression you would have if an expert stronger than you came and asked you to get lost.</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips and smiled faintly.</p><p>“There’s no” if.”Right now, I’m the strongest here. This is a fact!”</p><p>Li qiushui looked at Lu Ming with a cold gaze.</p><p>“You’re the strongest? He really knows how to put gold on his face!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a faint sneer.</p><p>“So you have the confidence to fight me? I’d like to see where you get your confidence from!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the sound of a sword rang out. A sword light as white as the Milky Way shot out from autumn water’s hand.</p><p>He was like a fairy from beyond the heavens, as fast as lightning.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. The demon subduing spear appeared in his hand and he charged forward.</p><p>If Lu Ming had not broken through to the fifth stage of the martial Grandmaster realm, he might not be a match for li qiushui, who could fight against LAN Yundao. But now, he wanted to test his own combat strength.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The spear radiance and the sword Qi collided with each other, causing a violent boom.</p><p>The two of them were pushed back in unison.</p><p>so you have some strength. Let’s see how many strikes you can take. Boundless autumn water sword!</p><p>Chi Chi Chi</p><p>The sword Qi that was like the Milky Way appeared one after another and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Wind Fire kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear trembled and the power of wind and Fire combined. Rays of spear light burst out and collided with the rays of sword Qi. Dense explosive sounds rang out in the air.</p><p>The crowd looked on in shock. They did not expect that Lu Ming could fight to a draw with li qiushui.</p><p>he’s not in the thousand River Top 100 list. Could he be a hidden genius who didn’t participate in the Ditian divine guards ‘qualifiers? ”</p><p>it shouldn’t be possible. Which young genius wouldn’t be tempted by the Ditian Divine Guard qualifiers? let’s not talk about the fact that one can cultivate in a branch Palace of the Ditian divine Palace after becoming a Ditian Divine Guard, which has endless benefits. It’s said that there are also great opportunities in the selection competition. Who would miss it? ”</p><p>that’s true. Could he be a genius from another region? ”</p><p>“It’s very possible!”</p><p>While the others were discussing, not far away, the red-haired water demon’s expression was also extremely grave. Even with his cultivation of the early stage of martial ancestor realm level 9, he did not dare to be careless.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two exchanged dozens of moves, but it was still difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>take my last move, autumn waters River sword!</p><p>Li qiushui roared. A terrifying aura spread out. A River appeared and circled around her.</p><p>Lu Ming could clearly see that the river was formed by the convergence of sword aura. The endless sword aura had condensed into a River.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Autumn water shouted and the river rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>This was li qiushui’s most powerful attack. It was extremely powerful. There was once a martial artist in the early stage of the ninth level of martial arts Grandmaster realm who was seriously injured and almost killed by this move.</p><p>so strong! If that kid doesn’t have a trump card, he’s finished!</p><p>The red-haired water demon thought.</p><p>The other spectators had similar thoughts. Their eyes were wide open as they stared at Lu Ming. They wanted to see how Lu Ming would resolve this move.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes revealed a trace of solemness. His figure suddenly soared into the sky.</p><p>“Nine Dragons trampling the heavens!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s body emitted a strange fluctuation and he suddenly took a step forward.</p><p>A faint Dragon’s Roar could be heard.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s step seemed to carry the might of heaven and earth. A terrifying wave spread out from under Lu Ming’s feet.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The nine Dragons heaven stomping steps and Li qiushui’s River of sword energy clashed together.</p><p>Heaven and earth shook violently, and a powerful Qi swept out. However, for some reason, under the aura of the Heaven’s Gate, it only spread out a few meters before disappearing.</p><p>A force that could have crushed a mountain did not cause much of a stir under the sky Gate.</p><p>Huhu ~</p><p>The force dissipated and autumn water retreated a dozen steps while Lu Ming flew backward.</p><p>They were evenly matched!</p><p>The others looked at Lu Ming in shock. There was also a hint of respect in their eyes.</p><p>Obviously, they had already regarded Lu Ming and Li qiushui as geniuses of the same level.</p><p>the geniuses from the thousand River region are indeed powerful. He’s only ranked 78th. No wonder Jian Fengyun said that he was injured by the geniuses from the thousand River region who were ranked 18th.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart and was somewhat shocked.</p><p>However, she didn’t know that autumn water’s heart was in turmoil and she was extremely shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming was only in the early phase of the fifth level martial arts Grandmaster realm, but he was able to fight to a draw with him. This was simply unbelievable.</p><p>He was a genius who could fight a battle that was more than two levels higher than him. Did that mean that Lu Ming could fight a battle that was four levels higher than him?</p><p>Li autumn water had never heard of anyone in the martial arts Grandmaster realm being able to fight someone four levels above them.</p><p>Even the monster who ranked first on the thousand River Top 100 list might not be able to fight against someone who was four levels higher.</p><p>“Where did this genius come from? how can he be so terrifying?”</p><p>Autumn water’s mind raced as killing intent flickered in her eyes.</p><p>However, he did not continue to attack. He stood at the side and looked at Lu Ming warily.</p><p>Lu Ming did not make a move. He looked at the sky Gate.</p><p>At this moment, the aura in the sky Gate was getting stronger and stronger.</p><p>Some people had already sat down cross-legged and started to comprehend the aura.</p><p>this aura contains the myriad DAOs of heaven and earth. I’ll try to comprehend the force of wind first!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered, then sat cross-legged and began to comprehend wind force.</p><p>Of course, he kept a part of his mind on his surroundings. If someone made a move on him, he could counterattack at any time.</p><p>However, no one attacked him. Li qiushui’s eyes flickered, but she didn’t attack. She also sat cross-legged and began to comprehend.</p><p>“Brat, once my Shi breaks through to perfection, it will be the time of your death!”</p><p>Li qiushui thought fiercely in her heart.</p><p>Slowly, the scene became silent. Most of the people started to comprehend and cultivate.</p><p>Not long after, someone was overjoyed. Clearly, they had gained something.</p><p>“Wind force!”</p><p>There was a faint breeze blowing around Lu Ming’s body. It was light and unpredictable.</p><p>Lu Ming successfully found the Dao of wind from the aura emitted by the Heaven’s Gate.</p><p>Instantly, his comprehension of the wind increased rapidly.</p><p>Wisps of Green Wind swirled around his body, sometimes slow and sometimes fast.</p><p>Half an hour later, the force of the wind around Lu Ming suddenly converged and disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming opened his eyes and there was a smile in his eyes.</p><p>His wind force had successfully broken through to the phenomenal stage.</p><p>It was barely at the same level as the fire Force, and the two were in balance.</p><p>Lu Ming was very much looking forward to the fusion of the two types of Shi and what kind of power would erupt.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
