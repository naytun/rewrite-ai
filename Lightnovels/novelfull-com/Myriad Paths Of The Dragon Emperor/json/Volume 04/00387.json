He immediately cast the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a loud bang, the burly young man’s body slid back for thousands of meters, leaving a deep gully along the way.</p><p>His body trembled and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Sisi Gu</p><p>Gasps of shock could be heard.</p><p>The geniuses from the flying Tiger Mountain range looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>It was unbelievable that he could injure the burly youth with one move with his cultivation of the fifth martial ancestor realm.</p><p>The long-armed young man was shocked at first, then his eyes flashed with cold killing intent.</p><p>I didn’t expect that a monstrous genius like you would appear in the cloud Emperor mountain range. I’m afraid even Jian Fengyun is far inferior to you. That’s good. I’ll kill you before you rise to power. Otherwise, you’ll be a disaster to the flying Tiger Mountain range in the future!</p><p>The long-armed young man said coldly.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, his body pounced toward Lu Ming like a cannonball and he threw a punch.</p><p>This punch was extremely terrifying. It was much stronger than the burly young man’s.</p><p>“Nine Dragons trampling the heavens!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps again and took a step forward.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a deafening sound, Lu Ming’s Nine Dragons heaven stomping steps was blocked. At the same time, a powerful force surged and Lu Ming was forced to retreat.</p><p>the cultivation of the later stage of the 7th level of the martial ancestor realm. What a strong power!</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>With a roar, a majestic giant ape appeared above the long-armed young man’s head.</p><p>There were five astonishing silver chakras on the giant ape’s body.</p><p>King class fifth level bloodline, violent steel ape!</p><p>“Great ape King divine fist!”</p><p>The long-armed young man roared and threw another punch. A ray of fist light, like the fist of a giant ape, came flying towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression turned grave. This person was definitely a three-man expert who was not weaker than Jian Fengyun.</p><p>“Heaven’s path palm!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast his strongest move without any hesitation.</p><p>The heaven’s path palm print condensed and collided with the great ape King’s divine fist.</p><p>An earth-shattering boom rang out, and the area within a radius of several dozen miles began to shake violently.</p><p>The fist and palm collided, forming a terrifying Hurricane that swept through the sky and the earth.</p><p>Some of the weaker young men from the flying Tiger Mountain range were swept away by the hurricane and were pushed back.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>After the loud noise, a figure flew back rapidly.</p><p>It was Lu Ming!</p><p>He flew for thousands of meters and stood in the air. There was a trace of blood at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>The long-armed young man was too strong. His cultivation had reached the later stage of the seventh level martial Grandmaster realm, which was more than two levels higher than Lu Ming. In addition to his three-man talent, he was more than five levels higher than Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming had not reached level five. How could he be his match?</p><p>“He didn’t die even after this?”</p><p>However, he didn’t know that the long-armed young man’s heart was in turmoil.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength shocked him so much that he had goosebumps all over.</p><p>He had also ventured to those large areas before.</p><p>But even in the larger regions, there was no such terrifying genius.</p><p>Not to mention anything else, he had only heard of a four-battle genius, but had never seen one.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he had obviously surpassed the top four.</p><p>“Die, I must die!”</p><p>The long-armed young man roared in his heart and then shouted,”I’ve already injured him. Let’s attack together. We can’t let this person leave alive!”</p><p>Having said that, he quickly attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The other people from the flying Tiger Mountain range all shouted. The scene of dozens of people attacking together was indeed shocking.</p><p>These young men were the strongest group of people in the flying Tiger Mountain range. It was as if all the geniuses on the cloud Emperor list had attacked together.</p><p>How shocking was the momentum?</p><p>“I’m too lazy to play with you guys.”</p><p>Lu Ming turned and left. He used the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps and took a step forward. In the next moment, he was already ten miles away.</p><p>What a joke. He was fighting with so many people, and one of them was a long-armed young man. Lu Ming was not stupid.</p><p>Since he was no match for them, what harm was there in temporarily retreating?</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming already had a plan in mind.</p><p>“Chase!”</p><p>The long-armed young man shouted. However, their speed could not be compared to Lu Ming’s. He disappeared without a trace in a few moments.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>The long-armed young man was filled with hatred.</p><p>let’s go back. We must get the level 5 spiritual herbs in the valley!</p><p>The long-armed young man shouted.</p><p>Then, the group of people from Flying Tiger Mountain range went back to the canyon to clear out the demonic beasts.</p><p>Lu Ming covered ten miles with a single step. His speed was so fast that he arrived outside a Valley not long after.</p><p>In this Valley, there was a half-step demonic beast King Toad.</p><p>That was right. Lu Ming came here to borrow strength.</p><p>He wanted to use the giant Toad’s power to disrupt the battle and then seize the opportunity to seize the spiritual herbs in the canyon.</p><p>Based on the herbal fragrance that the spiritual medicine was emitting, Lu Ming speculated that it was very likely a level five spiritual medicine.</p><p>This was because Level 4 spiritual herbs definitely did not have that kind of medicinal fragrance.</p><p>Level 5 spiritual medicine. Lu Ming was a little excited at the thought of it.</p><p>Level 5 spiritual medicine was a rare treasure that even kings needed. It was extremely precious.</p><p>If he had level five spiritual medicine, Lu Ming would be able to cultivate the ten thousand spiritual combat body and advance his physical body to the sixth-grade in one fell swoop.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Lu Ming dashed into the valley.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A moment later, an earth-shattering cry rang out, and the vegetation rustled and trembled.</p><p>Then, they saw Lu Ming rushing out of the valley as if his butt was on fire.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A mountain-sized Toad rushed out of the valley in pursuit of Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming cast the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps and appeared ten miles away in an instant.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The giant toad exerted force on its four limbs and its incomparably huge body shot up into the sky. In an instant, it crossed a distance of seven to eight li and landed heavily on the ground.</p><p>BOOM! Smoke and dust filled the air and the ground cracked. Then, in the smoke and dust, the giant Toad’s body rushed out once again and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming took another step forward, causing the giant toad to miss its target.</p><p>One man and one Toad, one chasing and one escaping, in the blink of an eye, they were dozens of miles away.</p><p>When the giant toad stopped and did not want to give chase, Lu Ming also stopped and shot it.</p><p>Immediately, the giant toad flew into a rage and continued to chase after Lu Ming.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming came to the huge Canyon again.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop. He dashed toward the canyon.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>With a loud shout, a few figures rushed out from below.</p><p>One of them was the burly young man who had been injured by Lu Ming earlier.</p><p>“You again? You still dare to come? You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The burly teenager roared angrily when he saw that it was Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>More than a dozen figures rushed out from below.</p><p>“Brat, I won’t let you off this time!”</p><p>The long-armed young man also rushed out.</p><p>“I brought you guys a present, don’t thank me!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The long-armed young man and the others were stunned.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A loud roar came from the distance. Then, they saw a mountain-like figure rushing over from the distance.</p><p>“That’s the referee, ah! Not good, quickly retreat!”</p><p>The long-armed young man’s expression changed and he quickly retreated.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and rushed inside.</p><p>However, there were a few people in Flying Tiger Mountain range who could not react in time and were directly crushed by the giant Toad’s figure.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Smoke and dust filled the air, and blood splattered. Those people were crushed to death by the giant toad.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
