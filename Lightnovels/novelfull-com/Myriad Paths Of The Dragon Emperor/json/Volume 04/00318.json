Lu Ming’s figure appeared outside the valley.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming moved and headed toward the valley.</p><p>Lu Ming stopped after about a thousand meters.</p><p>In front of him, there was a blood light and a huge blood cocoon floating there.</p><p>“The Golden-eyed blood corpse is about to evolve.”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>That’s right, the blood cocoon that was five to six meters tall in front of him was the Golden-eyed blood zombie.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had led the Golden-eyed blood zombies and the blood red Cavalry to kill more than a hundred thousand soldiers of the yinyue Army. The Golden-eyed blood zombies had absorbed too much blood Qi and had started to evolve halfway back to the Moonview city. They could only find a quiet place and let it evolve.</p><p>After Lu Ming returned to Moonview city and settled his matters, he rushed over to take a look at the situation.</p><p>“I don’t know how long it’ll take for the Golden-eyed blood corpse to evolve. It seems that the situation is stable now. I’ll go back to Moonview city first and come back to check it out later.”</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming turned into a ray of light and disappeared into the sky.</p><p>Not long after, they returned to Moonview city.</p><p>“Greetings, Marquis champion!”</p><p>“Greetings, Marquis champion!”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming returned to the Moonview city, the officials of the city and the general of the Yue zhenarmy saluted him respectfully.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded in response to each and every one of them. Very soon, he returned to the blood red Army camp.</p><p>Everything was normal. Hua Ying was indeed an expert in commanding troops. Under his management, the blood red Cavalry and the other soldiers were all training hard.</p><p>Regarding this, Lu Ming was very assured.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged in the Supreme shrine. A huge stone tablet was floating above his head.</p><p>The only difference was that there were four silver Chakra Rings shining around the stone tablet.</p><p>That was right. Lu Ming’s second blood Meridian had advanced.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that his nine Dragon bloodline had long reached the limit of Ordinary Level 9, but it had been difficult to advance. No matter how much blood essence he refined, it remained at Ordinary Level 9.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming had decided to use the blood essence he devoured to upgrade his second blood Meridian.</p><p>He had devoured too much blood essence in that battle, which had successfully promoted his second bloodline by one level.</p><p>His cultivation had also reached the peak of the third level of the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>I don’t know when my nine Dragon bloodline will advance to king class. Forget it, I won’t think about it anymore. When the time comes, it will naturally happen. Right now, the nine Dragons heaven stomping step is the most important thing.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>After a period of cultivation and the consecutive battles, Lu Ming finally had some progress with the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps.</p><p>Lu Ming took out the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps manual and read it carefully. Then, he closed his eyes and tried to comprehend it.</p><p>An hour later, Lu Ming suddenly stood up and casually stepped to the side.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s body seemed to have resonated with heaven and earth. His body emitted an inexplicable fluctuation, which was very mysterious.</p><p>“What a strong pressure!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming felt a terrifying pressure in the world acting on his body. He felt as if his body was about to explode from the pressure.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Finally, Lu Ming stepped onto the ground. At this moment, the entire Supreme shrine seemed to shake violently. The ground rumbled and almost exploded.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>After taking a step, Lu Ming heaved a long sigh of relief. The mysterious fluctuations on his body disappeared, and the pressure on him disappeared without a trace.</p><p>what a strong pressure. No wonder the nine suns Supreme warned me that I must break through to the martial ancestor realm and reach the fourth tier of the physical body realm before I can practice the nine Dragons heaven treading steps. If my cultivation and physical body do not meet the requirements, I’m afraid I will be crushed by the pressure.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. However, there was a look of excitement in his eyes.</p><p>“I’ve yet to complete the first step, but its power is already extremely shocking. The Supreme shrine is indestructible, yet it’s still shaking. If I were to take a step on the ground, I’m afraid the earth would explode.”</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely satisfied with the power of the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps. As expected of a divine level martial arts technique, it was undefeatable.</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming then continued to cultivate, striving to complete the first step of the nine Dragons heaven treading steps.</p><p>Time flew by, and another month passed.</p><p>In a month’s time, the red blood cavalry had improved at an astonishing rate.</p><p>Under the constant supply of pills, the remaining thirty thousand blood red scaled Wolf cavalry all broke through to the Martial Master realm, causing the strength of the blood red Cavalry to rise rapidly.</p><p>Of course, the consumption was also terrifying.</p><p>30,000 people had consumed the pills that were originally prepared for 100000 people, which was why their cultivation had increased so quickly.</p><p>Apart from the 30000 blood red Cavalry, the cultivation of the other soldiers had also increased.</p><p>The fastest had advanced three levels, and the worst had advanced one level.</p><p>The overall strength of Lu Ming’s Army of eighty thousand had improved by leaps and bounds.</p><p>In this month, the outside world was not peaceful either. It could be said that the wind was blowing and the clouds were surging.</p><p>There were two people who caught the most attention.</p><p>One of them was Duanmu Lin.</p><p>After being silent for many years, Duanmu Lin finally broke out and challenged ten extremely famous gold rank disciples of the five great sects in succession. He won in a row and won in a crushing manner.</p><p>He was just short of challenging the geniuses of the scorching sun’s six heroes.</p><p>Just when everyone thought that he would challenge the six heroes of the scorching sun, he stopped and didn’t continue. This made countless people wonder how strong Duanmu Lin was.</p><p>The other person was even more shocking-Qiu changkong.</p><p>For some unknown reason, Qiu changkong had a conflict with Gu Youyun, who was ranked 22nd on the cloud Emperor ranking list. The two of them had a showdown.</p><p>The result was shocking. In the end, Gu Youyun was killed.</p><p>Qiu changkong was ranked 36th and last on the Emperor Yun list. However, he had killed Gu Youyun, who was ranked 22nd, in a single battle. This was no longer a shock to the burning sun Empire, but to the entire Emperor Yun’s 36 empires.</p><p>Qiu changkong’s strength had exceeded everyone’s expectations.</p><p>There were eight medium empires in the 36 kingdoms of Emperor Yun. Of the 36 geniuses on the list, 32 of them came from the eight medium empires, and only four came from the low-tier empires.</p><p>The fact that Qiu changkong could be listed on the cloud Emperor board was already an extremely shocking thing.</p><p>This caused an even greater stir.</p><p>These two pieces of news naturally reached Lu Ming’s ears. However, after he heard it, he only smiled faintly and continued cultivating.</p><p>“Eh? There’s movement from the Golden Eye.”</p><p>One day, Lu Ming was cultivating when he suddenly felt that the demon suppressing token was a little unusual. It was emitting a faint light.</p><p>perhaps Goldeneye has already completed its evolution. Let’s go take a look and see how much it has improved.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with anticipation.</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood corpse was already equivalent to the peak of the 7th level of the martial ancestor realm. If it evolved further, it would definitely be stronger and would be a great help to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming left the Moonview city and turned into a ray of light, heading towards the valley where the Golden-eyed blood zombie was.</p><p>Lu Ming did not notice that not long after he left the Moonview city, a few figures were flying into the sky and following him from the grassland in the distance.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming arrived at the valley and walked in.</p><p>In front of him, the smell of blood was extremely thick, and the blood cocoon was filled with blood light.</p><p>The moment Lu Ming stepped into the valley, the blood-red light in front of him suddenly shrank.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Then, the blood cocoon cracked open, and a tall figure walked out.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
