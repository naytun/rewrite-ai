It’s been a long time since we last met. Your achievements have exceeded my imagination.”</p><p>“And now that you’re the Marquis champion, should I call you Lord Marquis when I see you?”</p><p>Mu Lan came to Lu Ming’s side with a smile and teased him.</p><p>It had been more than a year since they last met, and Mu Lan’s figure had become even more voluptuous. She was wearing a tight-fitting black chiffon dress that outlined a shocking curve on her body.</p><p>The faint fragrance of her body continuously sneaked into Lu Ming’s nose. It was filled with endless temptation.</p><p>It was completely like a ripe peach.</p><p>Senior Sister Mu Lan, you’ve laughed at me. In front of Senior Sister, I’m still that Junior Brother!</p><p>Lu Ming said with a bitter smile.</p><p>A satisfied smile appeared on Mu Lan’s face as if she was saying,’at least you know your place.’</p><p>Then, Mu Lan sized Lu Ming up carefully. A trace of longing flashed across her eyes, but no one noticed it.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, a figure appeared in the air above them.</p><p>It was a middle-aged man.</p><p>Marquis champion, the sect leader has something to discuss with you. He’s in the meeting hall!</p><p>The middle-aged man cupped his fists and saluted.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll be there immediately!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“Many thanks, Marquis champion!”</p><p>The middle-aged man cupped his fists in thanks and left.</p><p>“Senior Sister Mu Lan, let’s talk another day!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Alright!” Mu Lan nodded.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming soared into the sky and headed out of the mystical sword sect’s Mountain Gate.</p><p>The blood red Cavalry’s temporary camp was here.</p><p>“Lord Marquis!”</p><p>The blood red Cavalry saluted Lu Ming the moment he returned.</p><p>Regardless of whether it was Lu Ming or tianyun, the blood red Cavalry would not care. They only recognized one person, and that was the Marquis champion himself.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming brought the Golden-eyed blood corpse and Yan Quan to the meeting hall of the mystical sword sect.</p><p>The mystical sword sect’s meeting hall was located deep within the five great academies. It was the place where the sect leader, golden-robed elders, and golden-rank disciples cultivated. It was also the core of the mystical sword sect.</p><p>Back then, Lu Ming had stayed in the mystical sword sect for so long but he had never come here. Now, he had left the mystical sword sect and came here.</p><p>Things were really wonderful.</p><p>“The Marquis champion has arrived!”</p><p>Lu Ming had just appeared outside the meeting hall when someone announced his arrival.</p><p>Then, dozens of people walked out of the meeting hall.</p><p>The one in the lead was Lin Xueyi, and on the right was the only remaining half step King warrior of the ghost moon saber sect, Shangguan Ming.</p><p>On the left was another half-step King from the mystical sword sect.</p><p>The other dozens of people were mostly the Golden-robed elders of the mystical sword sect, as well as the deans of the Vermillion Bird, Black Tortoise, and Azure Dragon halls.</p><p>Feng Wuji was one of them.</p><p>hahaha, the Marquis champion is here. Please come in, and brother Yan as well!</p><p>Lin Xueyi laughed and cupped her fists at Lu Ming and Yan Quan.</p><p>His tone was very polite and he treated Lu Ming as a person of the same level.</p><p>“Greetings to Marquis champion and senior Yan Quan!”</p><p>The Golden-robed elders also cupped their fists and said.</p><p>Their feelings were complicated.</p><p>Lu Ming was once a disciple of the mystical sword sect and a proud Son of Heaven. He had entered the mystical sword sect and created many records.</p><p>In the end, because of the Duanmu family, they made Lu Ming leave the mystical sword sect.</p><p>However, it had only been a short while and Lu Ming had made such great achievements alone. Even they had to bow down to Lu Ming. This was simply unbelievable.</p><p>&Nbsp; ” sect leader Lin, seniors, you don’t have to be so polite!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Yan Quan’s face was expressionless.</p><p>Of course, the Golden-eyed blood corpse did not have any reaction. It followed Lu Ming closely.</p><p>A group of people walked into the meeting hall and took their seats.</p><p>this time, it’s all thanks to Marquis champion’s timely arrival. Otherwise, my mystic essence sword sect would have been destroyed by the ten direction sword sect. On behalf of all the disciples of the mystic essence sword sect, I would like to thank Marquis champion!</p><p>At the head of the hall, Lin Xueyi stood up and solemnly thanked Lu Ming.</p><p>sect leader Lin, you are too polite. I just don’t want the ten direction sword sect to unify the blazing sun Empire.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and his attitude was indifferent.</p><p>“No matter what? I still have to thank the Marquis champion!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi cupped her fists again. She sighed in her heart and was a little disappointed.</p><p>It was obvious that Lu Ming did not have a good impression of them.</p><p>He had thought that it was possible to get Lu Ming to return to the mystical sword sect. However, looking at Lu Ming’s attitude, it seemed impossible.</p><p>Lin Xueyi collected herself and continued, ” I invited Marquis champion here today to discuss the current situation and what we should do.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>this time, the ten directions Sword School has been defeated. They will definitely not let it go and will definitely make a comeback. Moreover, the ten directions Sword School has joined forces with the heavenly fiend sect. In addition, they have occupied the imperial capital. No one is the ten directions Sword school’s match. Therefore, we must join forces with the Crimson Cloud Valley to have the power to fight against the ten directions Sword School.</p><p>the most important thing now is to rescue the Crimson Cloud Valley. Previously, some experts from the heavenly fiend sect and the ten directions Sword School were missing, most likely to have gone to deal with the Crimson Cloud Valley. I wonder what Marquis champion and senior Shangguan think about this? ”</p><p>Lin Xueyi analyzed and then looked at Lu Ming and Shangguan Ming.</p><p>“I have no objections, as long as we don’t let the ten direction Sword School succeed.”</p><p>Shangguan Ming said.</p><p>“I have no objections either!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>No one had any objections, so they immediately sent experts to assist the Crimson Cloud Valley.</p><p>Lin Xueyi went personally, Shangguan Ming volunteered and Lu Ming sent flame spring.</p><p>The three half-step Kings led a large group of experts and charged toward the red Cloud Valley.</p><p>Lu Ming entered the Supreme shrine and began to devour and refine the blood essence.</p><p>In this battle, Lu Ming had devoured a large amount of blood essence and used it all to improve his nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>His cultivation had improved too quickly, and he still needed some time to Polish it.</p><p>Therefore, all the blood essence was used to improve the bloodline.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming felt that his nine Dragon bloodline had reached the limit of the first grade King level. He would soon reach the second grade King level.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, a Jade bottle appeared. Within the Jade bottle, there were nine drops of blood essence.</p><p>These nine drops of blood essence were placed together and did not mix with each other. They were like nine bright rubies.</p><p>This was the blood essence left behind by Duanmu canghai.</p><p>With a breath of genuine Qi, a drop of blood essence flew out. At the same time, the bloodline of Nine Dragons appeared. He opened his mouth and inhaled, and the drop of blood essence was swallowed by the bloodline of Nine Dragons.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>After a drop of blood essence was absorbed, it was like a volcano had erupted, erupting with terrifying energy.</p><p>The body of the nine-Dragon bloodline actually swelled up rapidly.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The nine Dragon bloodlines roared, and their voices rumbled, shaking the heavens and earth. They began to refine rapidly.</p><p>The blood essence of a half-step King was too rich. The endless energy was all absorbed by the nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Half an hour later, the bloodline of the nine Dragons trembled. Around his body, there was only one silver chakra. At this time, a second, lighter-colored silver chakra also appeared.</p><p>King Level 2.</p><p>His nine Dragon bloodline had advanced to the second rank of the king level.</p><p>the blood essence of a half-step King is indeed terrifying!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
