This had completely exceeded his expectations.</p><p>Since Mu Lan’s father was an important figure in the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, why did Mu Lan stay in the mystical sword sect instead of cultivating in the palace? the cultivation conditions in the palace were definitely not something that the mystical sword sect could compare to.</p><p>Yan LAN seemed to have read Lu Ming’s mind and continued, ” “LAN ‘er’s father is a major character in the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. He is extremely tyrannical and acts arbitrarily. Before LAN’ er turned 15, she was in the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. However, her father tried to control her. After that, without LAN ‘er’s consent, his father arranged a marriage for her.”</p><p>“The marriage partner is a peerless genius of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. However, LAN ‘er didn’t like him at all. Therefore, in a fit of anger, she ran out of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace and came to my place.”</p><p>Yan Lan’s answer cleared up many of Lu Ming’s doubts.</p><p>Lu Ming understood now. Mu Lan must have helped him get his invitation card when she returned to the Empyrean heaven divine Palace.</p><p>This made Lu Ming even more worried. He said,”Did Senior Sister Mu Lan return to the Empyrean heaven divine Palace this time? Wouldn’t that mean we’re facing marriage?”</p><p>He did not know why, but he felt a little uncomfortable at the thought of Mu Lan being engaged to someone else.</p><p>that’s right. In order to obtain that invitation, LAN ‘er has already promised her father to stay in the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. Now, the only person who can save her and prevent her from marrying someone she doesn’t like is you!</p><p>Yan LAN said.</p><p>“Me?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>“That’s right. LAN ‘er once made an agreement with her father. LAN’ er said that the person she liked would definitely be stronger than the genius of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. One day, she would bring the person she liked to the Empyrean heaven divine Palace and defeat that genius to break off the engagement. That person is you!”</p><p>Yan LAN looked at Lu Ming with bright eyes.</p><p>“Me? I’m f * cked!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes almost popped out.</p><p>The person Mu Lan likes? He?</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart was beating rapidly.</p><p>He recalled the various things that happened when Mu Lan left.</p><p>Taking a deep breath to calm himself down, Lu Ming said firmly, ” “Principal, don’t worry. I’ll definitely join the Ditian divine guards and defeat that genius to return Senior Sister Mu Lan her freedom!”</p><p>“It’s difficult!”</p><p>Yan LAN sighed and said, ” I heard from LAN ‘er that the genius had already broken through to the martial King realm three years ago. Now, I don’t even know what realm he has reached. That genius is only one year older than LAN’ er.</p><p>“Martial King!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils constricted.</p><p>Mu Lan was not even 23 years old. In other words, the genius of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace was only 24 years old. Three years ago, he was only 21 years old.</p><p>Breaking through to the martial King realm at the age of 21 was truly terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming was eighteen years old now, almost nineteen years old. However, he was not confident that he could break through to the martial King realm at twenty-one years old.</p><p>He was indeed a terrifying genius. The geniuses of the blazing sun Empire, no, even the geniuses on the cloud Emperor ranking were a pile of trash compared to him.</p><p>After a while, Lu Ming’s eyes burst with a strong fighting spirit and an unshakable determination.”Don’t worry, Dean. No matter how strong he is, I’ll defeat him sooner or later and set Senior Sister Mu Lan free.”</p><p>“Alright. LAN ‘er believes in you, and so do I. However, Lu Ming, with your current cultivation and combat strength, it’ll be very difficult for you to join the Ditian divine guards. I hope you can make another breakthrough.”</p><p>Yan Lan’s eyes seemed to reveal a trace of hope.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming chatted with Yan LAN for a while before he bade farewell and left.</p><p>A day later, the news that Lu Ming had received an invitation to the Ditian Divine Guard selection spread among the higher-ups of the mystical sword sect and the Crimson Cloud Valley.</p><p>This caused those who knew to be shocked, and then they were overjoyed.</p><p>Although they were curious as to how Lu Ming had obtained the invitation, that was not the main point. The main point was that Lu Ming could participate in the selection of the Ditian divine guards, which gave them a glimmer of hope.</p><p>At this time, the preliminaries of the 36 countries of Emperor Yun were getting closer and closer, and it was time to set off.</p><p>Lu Ming bade farewell to Lu Yuntian and Li Ping.</p><p>Qiu Yue said that she had not seen Lu Yuntian and Li Ping for a long time and wanted to stay by their side to take care of them. Naturally, Lu Ming nodded in agreement.</p><p>On the other hand, Xie nianqing wanted to go with Lu Ming. The reason was that he wanted to meet the geniuses from the 36 countries of Emperor Yun.</p><p>Two days later, Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, Feng Wuji, and Ling Yanchi left the mystical sword sect and headed west.</p><p>Lu Ming did not bring the Golden-eyed blood corpse or the flame spring.</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood corpse and Yan Quan were important forces in the battle. If they left, it would be bad for the battle.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming had the intention of leaving the Golden-eyed blood corpse behind to protect Lu Yuntian and Li Ping.</p><p>The cloud desolate Empire was one of the eight medium empires in the cloud Emperor mountain range. However, it was very powerful and was ranked first among the eight medium empires.</p><p>This was why the cloud Emperor mountain range preliminaries were held in the cloud desolate Empire’s imperial capital.</p><p>Starting from the mystical sword sect, one would have to pass through eight empires along the way. It was a long journey of more than seven hundred thousand li.</p><p>However, with everyone’s cultivation, if they flew at full speed, it was still quite easy to fly ten thousand miles in an hour.</p><p>Including the rest time, they used five days to rush to the cloud desolate Empire’s imperial capital.</p><p>The cloud desolate Empire was indeed worthy of being the strongest Empire among the 36 countries of Emperor Yun.</p><p>Just the imperial capital alone was ten times larger than the burning sun Empire’s imperial capital.</p><p>It was Grand and majestic, with no end in sight.</p><p>On the city wall, rows of armored soldiers patrolled. Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed when he saw them.</p><p>These armored soldiers were actually martial artists of the great Martial Master realm. Each of them had powerful auras and penetrating gazes.</p><p>Lu Ming secretly sighed. The number one empire in the cloud Emperor mountain range was really powerful.</p><p>After entering the city gate, the inside was extremely spacious.</p><p>The street was two hundred meters wide, and all kinds of beast roars could be heard.</p><p>Many people were riding all kinds of mounts and strolling on the streets.</p><p>Lu Ming even saw a martial artist riding a huge Python that was more than thirty meters long and as thick as a water tank, wandering on the street.</p><p>On both sides of the street, there were many shops.</p><p>A few spirit weapon shops were sparkling with treasure light.</p><p>In some spirit herb shops, the fragrance of herbs assailed the nose.</p><p>Lu Ming and the few of them walked as they watched, full of admiration.</p><p>On the way, they could see young martial artists passing by from time to time, all of them with an imposing appearance and extraordinary aura.</p><p>One look and one could tell that they were Dragons and phoenixes among people. They should all be here to participate in the qualifiers.</p><p>brother Lu, brother Feng, miss Xie, let’s find a place to eat. We’ve been hurrying on our journey these past few days and haven’t had a good meal. I’m so tired of eating!</p><p>Ling Yanchi touched his stomach and grinned.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>The few of them walked around for a while and came to the front of a restaurant.</p><p>The drunken Pavilion was the name of this restaurant. It was seven stories high and covered an area of several acres.</p><p>“Dear guests, please come in!”</p><p>At the entrance of the restaurant, a waiter came to greet them.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
