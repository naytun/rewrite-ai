Only then can he fully display his talent and achieve greater achievements. Moreover, only by doing so can we save the mystical sword sect and keep you safe, grandfather.”</p><p>...</p><p>Mu Lan said.</p><p>“LAN ‘er, are you yourself? I’ve been wronged!”</p><p>Yan LAN said worriedly.</p><p>“Grandpa, don’t you trust Lu Ming? I believe in him. As long as he joins the Ditian divine guards, he’ll be able to truly return my freedom.”</p><p>At this point, Mu Lan’s eyes glowed. It was the light of her firm belief in Lu Ming.</p><p>it’s difficult. Although Lu Ming is extremely talented, that’s only in the blazing sun Empire. In the Imperial sky divine guards, he’s very ordinary. It’s difficult to achieve that!</p><p>Yan LAN sighed.</p><p>Grandpa, I believe in my judgment. Don’t worry, I’ll be fine. I’ll be going now, Grandpa.</p><p>With that, Mu Lan bowed to Yan LAN and then floated away, disappearing from the Vermillion Bird Hall.</p><p>Lu Ming naturally knew nothing about this.</p><p>Seven days passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>In seven days, Lu Ming had refined more than 500 level 4 spiritual herbs and cultivated his physical body to the perfected fifth-grade physical body.</p><p>However, at this point, no matter how many spiritual herbs Lu Ming refined, his physical body could not break through. He was completely stuck at the perfected fifth-grade physical body.</p><p>it seems that Level 4 spiritual herbs are too low. They can’t help my body break through to Level 6.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered secretly.</p><p>do I need Level 5 spiritual herbs or other Level 5 treasures? ”</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming shook his head and smiled bitterly.</p><p>Level 5 spiritual herbs and other Level 5 treasures were equivalent to King tiers. If they were treasures that even King tiers could use, how precious would they be?</p><p>It was something that could only be encountered and not sought.</p><p>I’ll put my fleshly body aside for now. A complete fifth grade fleshly body is enough for now. Even among half-step Kings, not many people have a fifth grade fleshly body.</p><p>Many martial artists who did not focus on cultivating their bodies would not even reach the fifth grade when they reached the half-step King realm.</p><p>Only after stepping into the martial King realm and going through the power of heaven and earth, as well as the transformation of the true essence unique to Kings, could one’s body reach the fifth grade.</p><p>In other words, Lu Ming’s current physical body was no longer inferior to those martial Kings who did not specialize in physical cultivation.</p><p>Of course, that was only his physical body. His combat strength was still miles away from that of a martial King.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming began to study the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps.</p><p>The nine Dragons sky-treading steps and the last of the three Palms, the heavenly path palm, were the martial arts techniques that Lu Ming had to comprehend and cultivate every day.</p><p>However, the cultivation of these two martial arts techniques was too difficult. Up until now, Lu Ming had not succeeded in cultivating the second step of the nine Dragons heaven treading steps.</p><p>As for the heaven’s path palm, he knew nothing about it.</p><p>Time flew by and another five days passed.</p><p>There were only a few days left before the start of the Ditian Divine Guard’s preliminary competition.</p><p>On this day, Mu Lan came to look for Lu Ming.</p><p>“Senior Sister Mu Lan, I heard that you’ve been out during this period of time?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked Mu Lan with a smile.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Mu Lan hummed softly and looked at Lu Ming, seemingly deep in thought.</p><p>“Senior Sister Mu Lan seems to have something on her mind!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>However, since Mu Lan didn’t say anything, he didn’t ask.</p><p>After a long while, Lu Ming’s palm glowed and a golden piece of paper suddenly appeared.</p><p>“This is … An invitation to the Ditian Divine Guard selection?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and he could not help but blurt out.</p><p>Mu Lan nodded. She opened the invitation and revealed the words inside.</p><p>‘Blazing sun Empire, Lu Ming’.</p><p>On the invitation, there were six words in gold.</p><p>“Why is it me?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils suddenly shrank and he cried out in disbelief.</p><p>In the beginning, Lu Ming thought that Mu Lan had taken out someone else’s invitation. It was like the wind, fearless, and Ling Yanchi.</p><p>He had never expected his name to be on the invitation.</p><p>“Lu Ming, this is the invitation letter for the Ditian Divine Guard selection. Take it. I hope that you can defeat Qiu changkong and successfully join the Ditian Divine Guard.”</p><p>Mu Lan finally revealed a faint smile.</p><p>“Senior Sister Mu Lan, where did you get this invitation?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked, feeling extremely curious.</p><p>The invitation from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace couldn’t be faked because there were special inscriptions carved on it that made it easy to distinguish.</p><p>No one would dare to impersonate him unless they wanted to die.</p><p>I, your Senior Sister, have my own ways. You don’t have to worry about that. Take it and perform well. I believe in you.</p><p>Mu Lan passed the invitation to Lu Ming and said with a smile.</p><p>Lu Ming received it in a daze.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I might have to leave the mystical sword sect from today onwards.”</p><p>Suddenly, Mu Lan sighed.</p><p>“What? Senior Sister Mu Lan, you’re leaving the mystical sword sect? Are you going to gain experience, or …?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked hurriedly. He felt that things were very strange.</p><p>“None of them!”</p><p>Mu Lan shook her head and studied Lu Ming carefully. After a while, she said,”Lu Ming, as long as you join the Ditian divine guards, perhaps we’ll meet again,”</p><p>Mu Lan suddenly stepped forward and pulled Lu Ming into her arms.</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. The next moment, he felt two lumps of meat squeezed on his chest. They were shockingly elastic.</p><p>Mu Lan’s body fragrance wafted into his nose, making Lu Ming’s heart beat rapidly.</p><p>Mu Lan hugged Lu Ming tightly. After a long while, she suddenly let go of him. Her face was flushed red. She glanced at Lu Ming, then turned around and left.</p><p>“Lu Ming, join the Ditian Divine Guard. I look forward to seeing you again.”</p><p>The voice came faintly, but the beauty had already disappeared.</p><p>“Senior Sister Mu Lan!”</p><p>Lu Ming stared in the direction that Mu Lan had left in a daze. He did not come back to his senses for a long time.</p><p>Lu Ming only came to his senses after a long while.</p><p>“What’s going on? Why would Senior Sister Mu Lan have an invitation from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace? also, where is she going?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart was full of doubts.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved and he appeared in the sky. He looked into the distance and saw that Mu Lan had already left. He did not know where she went.</p><p>“Dean, yes, go and Ask the Dean!”</p><p>Lu Ming thought of Yan LAN.</p><p>Yanlan was Mulan’s grandfather, so she should know the inside story.</p><p>After a while, Lu Ming found Yan LAN in the Vermillion Bird Hall.</p><p>It had been a while since they last met and Yan LAN seemed to have aged a lot. Lu Ming’s heart tightened and he felt that something was not right.</p><p>“Lu Ming, take a seat!”</p><p>Yan LAN invited Lu Ming to take a seat and poured him a cup of tea.</p><p>“I knew you’d come looking for me. You want to ask about LAN ‘er, right?”</p><p>Yan LAN said.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and immediately asked his question.</p><p>Yan LAN was silent. He seemed to have fallen into deep memories. After a while, he sighed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll tell you everything. That girl, LAN ‘er, is stubborn. She won’t say anything!”</p><p>“Lu Ming, you know that I’m lan ‘er’s grandfather, but you’ve never met her parents, have you?”</p><p>Yan LAN said.</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned and immediately shook his head.</p><p>It was true that he had never met Mu Lan’s parents before, nor had he heard Mu Lan mention them.</p><p>“LAN ‘er’s mother passed away a long time ago. As for LAN’ er’s father, he’s an important figure in the Emperor heaven divine Palace.”</p><p>Yan LAN revealed a shocking secret.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
