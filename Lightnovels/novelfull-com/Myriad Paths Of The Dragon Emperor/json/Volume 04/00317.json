They had no choice but to retreat.</p><p>After this battle, the prestige of the burning sun Empire’s royal family had greatly increased.</p><p>This was because the blood red Cavalry, tianyun, belonged to the imperial family.</p><p>In the imperial capital of blazing sun Country, in the Imperial Palace, in the throne room, an excited laugh could be heard.</p><p>In the throne room, Emperor Hua was sitting on the Dragon Throne, and below him stood the civil and military officials.</p><p>hahaha, good, good! Tianyun is indeed a peerless genius. This battle has greatly impacted the morale of the Dark Moon Empire, and our royal family’s reputation has also soared. We have regained our popularity in the hearts of the common people!</p><p>Hua Zhengxing laughed, his eyes shining with excitement.</p><p>congratulations, Your Majesty, for finding such a genius. I’ve forgotten the rejuvenation of the royal family!</p><p>A white-haired old official came forward to congratulate him.</p><p>“Congratulations, Your Majesty, for recognizing the Pearl with your discerning eyes!”</p><p>The other officials all bowed and shouted.</p><p>“Father, tianyun has made such a great contribution, we must reward him!”</p><p>Hua Chi walked out and bowed.</p><p>reward? of course, I’ll reward you. How about this? pass on my order, I’ll confer tianyun the title of Marquis champion. He’ll be the champion of the three armies, and he’ll be able to form any Army he wants and recruit talents.</p><p>Hua Zhengxing announced.</p><p>“Many thanks, father!”</p><p>Hua Chi was overjoyed.</p><p>“Your Majesty is wise!”</p><p>All of the officials congratulated.</p><p>When the news of tianyun being conferred the title of Marquis champion spread, the blazing sun Empire was once again shaken.</p><p>Tianyun’s name was remembered by everyone, as he was the youngest Marquis in the history of the blazing sun Empire.</p><p>In the Heavenly King suppression Palace.</p><p>“The Marquis champion? Damn it, this tianyun deserves ten thousand deaths for his crimes!”</p><p>The Heavenly King’s angry roar came from the palace.</p><p>In a certain side hall of the general Star Hall, Lu Yuntian spread out a piece of white paper on a stone table in a small courtyard. He was currently focused on writing.</p><p>It was a ‘Wu’ character. Under Lu Yuntian’s brush, it was as if Dragons and phoenixes were dancing. The force of the brush was vigorous, and there was a powerful aura about it that seemed to be struggling free.</p><p>Even though Lu Yuntian’s cultivation base had been crippled, the ‘Wu’ character contained his essence, energy, and spirit.</p><p>He finished writing it in one go.</p><p>Lu Yuntian let out a long breath.</p><p>“Tian ‘GE, I believe that in the future, Ming’ er will definitely cure you and let you return to the martial path.”</p><p>Li Ping whispered as she read Lu Yuntian’s mind.</p><p>She understood how lonely it was for a martial arts genius to not be able to practice martial arts.</p><p>“Ping ‘er, as long as you’re by my side, it doesn’t matter if I can’t cultivate. Besides, Ming’ er’s talent is countless times higher than mine. I’m satisfied!”</p><p>Lu Yuntian laughed.</p><p>At this moment, a maidservant in her twenties rushed in.</p><p>Li Ping had brought the servant girl from the Lu family, and she was very loyal.</p><p>“Chun Xiang, why are you in such a hurry? what happened?”</p><p>Li Ping asked, frowning slightly.</p><p>“Master, Madam, good news, good news! The young master has won a great victory at the border. His Majesty has already made the young master the Marquis champion, and this has been announced to the world.”</p><p>Chun Xiang excitedly said.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Yuntian was stunned, and the brush in his hand fell to the ground.</p><p>Li Ping was also stunned. After a while, she finally reacted and trembled with excitement.”The Marquis champion? Ming ‘er was conferred the title of Marquis? Was it true? Is it true?”</p><p>Li Ping asked a few times, thinking that she was dreaming.</p><p>it’s absolutely true. Master, Madam, the outside world is talking about this. Everyone knows about it.</p><p>Chun Xiang said.</p><p>“Ming ‘er has been conferred the title of Marquis. Brother Tian, Ming’ er has been conferred the title of Marquis.”</p><p>Li Ping muttered. Tears rolled down her face as she leaned into Lu Yuntian’s embrace.</p><p>He was too excited.</p><p>“What are you crying for? this is a great thing. Why are you crying?”</p><p>Lu Yuntian pretended to be calm as he hugged Li Ping. However, his slightly trembling voice could not hide his excitement.</p><p>Two days later, the news reached Moonview city.</p><p>“Marquis champion, Marquis champion!”</p><p>The roars that stirred the hearts of the people resounded through the clouds.</p><p>……</p><p>On the Great Northern Plains, tens of thousands of miles away from Moonview city.</p><p>There was an endless stretch of military tents here, and one could not see the end of it at a glance.</p><p>This was the largest military camp in the southern part of the Dark Moon Empire, and it ruled most of the southern Territory of the Dark Moon Empire.</p><p>The yin moon Empire’s South vanquishing Prince, Yin tianjue, was stationed here. He was also fully in charge of the attack on the blazing sun Empire.</p><p>At this moment, in Yin tianjue’s tent, there were more than ten people sitting.</p><p>Yin tianjue sat at the highest position, looking at a figure in a black robe in the middle of the tent.</p><p>“Yin tianjue, why did your Dark Moon Empire retreat? our plan has been thrown into chaos.”</p><p>The black-robed man only revealed a pair of eyes as he gloomily looked at Yin tianjue.</p><p>“Why retreat? Nonsense, do you know how much we have lost? “The entire wild lion Legion has been destroyed, and the ash Wolf Legion is almost done for. There’s also the Bloodmoon demonic Tiger Legion and so on. Do you know how much it costs to nurture these legions? Did you know?”</p><p>Yin tianjue smacked the table heavily, almost shouting.</p><p>The black-robed man was silent for a moment. this time, it’s our fault for not being able to predict the situation. We never expected tianyun to be so difficult to deal with.</p><p>“Hehe, you want to shirk responsibility just because you didn’t expect it? You wish!”</p><p>Yin tianjue sneered.</p><p>before I came, I have already received orders that your country’s losses will be compensated by our side. However, the plan must continue, or else this loss will be in vain.</p><p>“As long as we succeed, the benefits we promised you will not be any less.”</p><p>The black-robed man said.</p><p>“Continue? You make it sound so easy, but who’s in charge of the blood red Cavalry of tianyun? We can’t afford to lose this.”</p><p>Yin tianjue sneered.</p><p>“The blood red Cavalry isn’t scary. What’s scary is tianyun. As long as tianyun dies, the blood red Cavalry will fall apart. At that time, they can be destroyed with a flip of their hands.”</p><p>The black-robed man said.</p><p>“Oh? What’s your plan?”</p><p>Yin tianjue asked.</p><p>“Assassinate tianyun,” the black-robed man said with a cold smile.</p><p>“Assassination? Tianyun is hiding among the 30000 blood red Cavalry, and he has an extremely powerful expert following him at all times. How can it be so easy to assassinate him!”</p><p>Yin tianjue said.</p><p>then we’ll wait. I don’t believe that tianyun will hide in the military camp forever. Your country is famous for assassination, and I believe that you’re more skilled than me in this. This time, we’ll also send our best assassins to cooperate with your country to kill tianyun.</p><p>The black-robed man’s voice was filled with killing intent.</p><p>“Very well. We’ll also send out our strongest assassins. We must kill tianyun in one fell swoop. Also, I’ll need to request for reinforcements from His Majesty. I’m afraid that it’ll be very difficult for us to launch a large-scale attack in the short term.”</p><p>Yin tianjue said.</p><p>it’s fine. We can still afford to wait for another month or two. It’s decided then.</p><p>After the black Sect’s people finished speaking, their figures moved and they disappeared.</p><p>Yin tianjue muttered to himself for a moment before giving the order, ” “Summon the yuan and que duo to see me.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>yes, ” one person replied and then disappeared.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
