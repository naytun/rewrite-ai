Are you guys suspecting me? Or are you doubting the Empyrean heaven divine Palace?”</p><p>...</p><p>The young man in Purple’s face turned cold as he stared at Lin Xueyi and Ling potian with hostility.</p><p>Lin Xueyi and Ling potian’s expressions changed.</p><p>However, whether Lu Ming could participate in the assessment was related to the situation in the burning sun Empire and the life and death of the mystical sword sect and the Crimson Cloud Valley. He had to be clear about this.</p><p>emissary, it’s a misunderstanding. However, Lu Ming does not have an invitation. It’s really strange. Could you please report this to the higher-ups? ”</p><p>Lin Xueyi gritted her teeth and continued.</p><p>“Impudent!”</p><p>Before Lin Xueyi could finish her sentence, the young man in purple shouted. At the same time, a terrifying aura burst out from the young man in purple.</p><p>This aura was as heavy as a mountain and as vast as the ocean. It was extremely powerful and vast.</p><p>“Half-step King!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi and Ling potian exclaimed in unison. At the same time, a powerful aura erupted from their bodies to offset this force. However, their bodies couldn’t help but sway and retreat three steps.</p><p>Strong, he was too strong!</p><p>Everyone was shocked and stared at the young man in purple with wide eyes.</p><p>No one would have thought that this purple-robed youth was actually a half-step King.</p><p>He looked like he was only twenty-six or twenty-seven years old. At such a young age, he had already reached the half-step King realm. This was truly shocking.</p><p>Moreover, it seemed that he was even stronger than Lin Xueyi.</p><p>“Is this the strength of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace? Just a random young man who came to the blazing sun Empire to deliver an invitation letter is already so powerful!”</p><p>At the side, Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed and his expression turned grave.</p><p>“Hmph! The Empyrean heaven divine Palace naturally has their own reasons for doing things. How can I allow you all to be suspicious? since this is your first offense, I won’t pursue it. But if there’s a next time, I don’t mind killing you all!”</p><p>The young man in Purple’s eyes were gloomy as he spoke coldly. He was filled with an arrogant attitude.</p><p>“Sect leader Lin, say no more!”</p><p>Lu Ming had sent a voice transmission to Lin Xueyi.</p><p>Lin Xueyi and Ling potian let out a long sigh and didn’t say anything else.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>The young man in purple snorted coldly and left with a wave of his sleeve.</p><p>Just as he turned around, he glanced at Lu Ming with a cold look in his eyes.</p><p>Although it was just a flash, Lu Ming still caught it.</p><p>“Eh? What was going on? I’ve never seen this person before, and I don’t have any grudges with the Emperor heaven divine Palace. Why does this person look at me with a hint of coldness in his eyes?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and pondered.</p><p>“What’s going on? Why didn’t the Marquis champion receive an invitation?”</p><p>Ling potian’s temper was more impatient, and as soon as the young man in purple left, Ling potian cried out.</p><p>“That’s right, this matter is too strange!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi’s brows were also tightly furrowed, full of worry.</p><p>Without an invitation, one could not take part in the Ditian Divine Guard assessment.</p><p>If Qiu changkong hadn’t joined the Ditian divine guards, it would have been fine. But if he had joined the Ditian divine guards, even if he was only a reserve, they would all be in danger.</p><p>“Sect leaders, Marquis champion, I have a guess, but I don’t know if it’s true or not!”</p><p>At this moment, an old voice was heard. An old man with white hair walked out.</p><p>“Senior Hua, do you have any guesses?”</p><p>Lin Xueyi hurriedly asked.</p><p>This old man was a senior of the royal family. Even if Hua Zhengxing was still alive, he would have to call this man ” uncle.</p><p>His seniority was extremely high, and his cultivation was at the ninth level of the martial ancestor realm. He was the only ninth level martial ancestor expert left in the imperial family.</p><p>The old Imperial uncle pondered for a moment before saying, ” I like to make friends with people from all over the world. I even have friends in the ten direction sword sect. I once heard a secret that when Qiu changkong was young, he was taken in as an in-name disciple by an important figure in the eastern branch of the Emperor heaven divine Palace!</p><p>“What? Qiu changkong is an in-name disciple of an important figure in the eastern branch of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace?”</p><p>The old Imperial uncle’s words were like a bomb, causing everyone’s minds to rumble.</p><p>All of them looked at the old Imperial uncle in shock.</p><p>“Senior, is what you said true?”</p><p>Lin Xueyi’s voice was trembling.</p><p>The old Imperial uncle nodded and said,”there shouldn’t be a mistake.”</p><p>Sisi Gu</p><p>Everyone gasped, and the atmosphere became extremely oppressive and heavy.</p><p>if that’s the case, Qiu changkong must have done something. Otherwise, with the Marquis champion’s talent, how could he not have received an invitation? ”</p><p>Lin Xueyi said in a deep voice, her eyes were filled with seriousness.</p><p>“What should we do? With such a powerful figure backing Qiu changkong, doesn’t that mean that he’ll definitely be able to join the Empyrean sky divine guards?”</p><p>A golden-robed elder said.</p><p>that’s not necessarily the case. The selection of the Ditian divine guards has its own rules. You can’t join just because you have a backer. In the end, it still depends on your own strength!</p><p>Ling potian said.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>The others all nodded.</p><p>Even so, the atmosphere at the scene was still extremely oppressive.</p><p>“Seniors, there’s no need to be so worried. At that time, it’ll just be a battle. Who will win? Before the battle, who would know?”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>There was no sign of dejection on his face. He stood straight, still confident and determined, like a divine spear that could shatter the heavens.</p><p>So what if Qiu changkong had a powerful backer?</p><p>At most, it would just be a battle.</p><p>Marquis champion is right. Things haven’t reached the worst point yet. We don’t have to be discouraged. Right now, the only way is to keep improving our strength.</p><p>Lin Xueyi said.</p><p>After that, everyone returned to the main hall and discussed for a while before leaving.</p><p>It was just that everyone’s heart was weighed down by a huge stone, and it was difficult to let go for a while.</p><p>Lu Ming returned to the blood red Army camp’s main tent and entered the Supreme shrine. He sat down cross-legged.</p><p>strength. No matter what the situation is, as long as you are strong enough, you can solve everything.</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>Then, he waved his hand and a pile of spiritual herbs appeared on the platform.</p><p>Lu Ming planned to start cultivating the ten thousand spiritual combat body.</p><p>It had been a while since he had cultivated his physical body. The reason was that he didn’t have any high-level spiritual herbs. Those level one and level two spiritual herbs were not effective in cultivating and were a waste of time.</p><p>During this period of time, there had been many battles. Lu Ming had killed a large number of martial arts grandmasters and obtained their storage rings. There were quite a number of level-four spiritual herbs.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had already achieved initial success in the fifth-grade physical body. Only level-four spiritual herbs would have a greater effect on his improvement.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, two level-four spiritual herbs were caught in Lu Ming’s hand. He began to circulate the ten thousand spiritual combat body.</p><p>Not long after, the two spiritual herbs turned into the Qi of myriad spirits and seeped into the depths of Lu Ming’s body, refining the strength of his physical body.</p><p>After refining two, he took out another two.</p><p>Time slowly passed as Lu Ming cultivated.</p><p>……</p><p>Vermillion Bird Hall, Yan Lan’s residence.</p><p>“LAN ‘er, do you really want to go to that place?”</p><p>Yan LAN looked at Mu Lan anxiously.</p><p>“Grandfather, is there any other way? Only by going to that place can we get an invitation for Lu Ming and let him participate in the selection of the Ditian divine guards!”</p><p>Mu Lan said with a determined expression.</p><p>“LAN ‘er, you have to consider this carefully.”</p><p>Yan LAN sighed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
