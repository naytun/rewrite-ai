Then, the Dark Moon Empire’s Army had seized the opportunity to attack.</p><p>With the general’s death, the northern Battlefront Army was thrown into chaos. The Dark Moon Empire took the opportunity to break into the northern Battlefront city and suffered heavy losses.</p><p>The remaining troops of the northern Battlefront Army intended to break through the siege, but they were caught up by the yinyue Army, which led to the battle just now.</p><p>Fortunately, they had the help of the ghost moon saber sect and the mystic essence sword sect’s experts during this period of time. Otherwise, they would have been defeated long ago.</p><p>Coupled with the arrival of Lu Ming’s Army, they were able to turn the tide and defeat the yinyue Army.</p><p>“Northguard city has already been occupied by the Dark Moon Empire, and they’ve deployed a large Army to defend it. It’s too difficult to attack it.”</p><p>Huang Chenlong sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming came to a realization. So this was the case.</p><p>“What are your plans next?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>Huang Chenlong and the other Deputy generals exchanged glances and nodded. They then dismounted and knelt down to Lu Ming.”If you don’t mind, we are willing to join you with the remaining Northern Battlefront Army!”</p><p>“What are you generals doing? Quickly get up and talk.”</p><p>Lu Ming quickly went to help Huang Chenlong and the rest.</p><p>“General tianyun, we’re defeated and have nowhere to go. If you don’t take us in, I’m afraid we’ll be destroyed by the Dark Moon Empire sooner or later. General, you’re a peerless talent. If you lead us, we’ll definitely avenge our brothers who died in battle. Please take us in!”</p><p>Huang Chenlong could not accept it.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll agree.”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment and nodded in agreement.</p><p>thank you, general tianyun!</p><p>Huang Chenlong and the rest were overjoyed.</p><p>“Generals, rest assured. Brothers, rest assured. I, tianyun, swear that I will lead you all to kill the people of the yin moon sect and avenge our brothers who died in battle!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. His voice traveled far and every Northern Battlefront Army soldier heard him.</p><p>“General tianyun is mighty!”</p><p>“General tianyun is invincible!”</p><p>Instantly, the crowd burst into earth-shattering cheers.</p><p>He only stopped after a while.</p><p>Lu Ming then ordered Huang Chenlong to count the remaining members of the northern Battlefront Army.</p><p>Huang Chenlong accepted the order and left.</p><p>At this moment, a ray of light flashed across the sky, and a figure appeared. It was the tall and thin man from the mystical sword sect.</p><p>“Qiu Yue, the battle here has ended. Come back to the ghost moon saber sect with me first!”</p><p>The tall and thin man said.</p><p>“Martial uncle, you can go back first. I plan to stay in the military camp to gain experience!”</p><p>Qiu Yue said.</p><p>“Stay in the military camp? You can’t!”</p><p>The tall and thin man’s expression changed greatly.</p><p>Qiu Yue’s second bloodline was a terrifying fifth level King bloodline. This was too shocking. She was much stronger than Duanmu Lin and her future achievements were unimaginable. Only a few higher-ups in the mystical sword sect knew that Qiu Yue was listed as a key training target.</p><p>Now that Qiu Yue was going to stay in the military camp to gain experience, he would not be able to explain to Qiu Yue’s master and the other higher-ups if anything happened.</p><p>“Don’t worry, uncle-master, I’ll be careful.”</p><p>Qiu Yue said.</p><p>“Senior, if lady Qiuyue remains in the camp, I will do my best to ensure her safety. I will not let a single hair on her head be harmed.”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>The tall and thin man suddenly muttered to himself, his mind running wild.</p><p>“How did Qiuyue and tianyun get to know each other? Could it be love at first sight for a hero and a beautiful woman? It’s very possible. With Qiu Yue’s talent, only a genius like tianyun is worthy of her. Fine, let her stay here first. I’ll go back and report to my senior brother and the sect leader and let them decide!”</p><p>Thinking of this, the tall and thin man bowed slightly and said, ” “In that case, I’ll have to trouble young master tianyun.”</p><p>“Senior, don’t worry!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>The tall, skinny man then transformed into a ray of light and disappeared.</p><p>“Hmph! Great general tianyun, you’re really suave. You’re leading an Army to war, and you still remember to kidnap a little beauty. It’s too cold at night, so you want to use it to warm the bed?”</p><p>At this moment, a faint voice was heard. Xie nianqing rode over on the bloodscaled Wolf King.</p><p>He looked at Qiu Yue carefully, and a dark look flashed in the depths of his eyes.</p><p>“Cough, cough. Little Qing, what nonsense are you spouting?”</p><p>Lu Ming coughed a few times, then he moved closer to Xie nianqing and said, ” “What’s wrong? You sound so jealous, don’t tell me?”</p><p>“Jealous? What the hell are you talking about? F * ck, how could I be jealous of you? dream on!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s heart skipped a beat and he quickly denied.</p><p>However, her heart was beating even faster. The inexplicable feeling in her heart made her a little flustered.</p><p>When she saw Lu Ming and Qiu Yue together, she felt an inexplicable sadness in her heart.</p><p>“Am I really jealous? No, no, that’s impossible. How could I be jealous of this guy? I just want to step on him. Yes, that must be it. I must work hard to cultivate and step on him as soon as possible!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s mind was spinning with thoughts, but he glared at Lu Ming fiercely and gritted his teeth.</p><p>Lu Ming’s hair stood on end from her stare. Was this woman sick?</p><p>At the side, Qiu Yue’s gaze shifted between Lu Ming and Xie nianqing. No one knew what she was thinking, but she remained silent obediently.</p><p>After a while, Huang Chenlong came to report the number of goods.</p><p>The northern Battlefront Army still had 60160 men.</p><p>The northern Battlefront Army had a total of one hundred thousand soldiers, but in one night, nearly forty thousand of them had died. It was a heavy loss.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming led the blood red Cavalry and more than 60000 soldiers of the northern Battlefront Army to Moonview city.</p><p>On the way, they met Ming Meng, who was leading an Army to rescue them.</p><p>After learning about the situation of the northern Battlefront Army, Ming Meng also sighed.</p><p>The group of people returned to Moonview city the same way they came.</p><p>After returning to the Moonview city, Lu Ming handed over the reorganization of the northern Battlefront Army to Hua Ying. He hid in the Supreme shrine and began to refine the blood essence.</p><p>Although he had refined a portion of the blood essence along the way, there was still a lot left.</p><p>The surging blood essence energy was transformed into essential Qi and Lu Ming’s cultivation level kept increasing.</p><p>When all the blood essence in the nine Dragons ‘bloodline had been refined, his cultivation had reached the late stage of the third level of martial ancestor realm. He was only one step away from the peak of the third level.</p><p>After he had broken through to the third level of the martial ancestor realm, he had killed a seventh level martial ancestor realm expert. However, the blood essence of this seventh level martial ancestor realm expert had not helped him improve much.</p><p>After refining the blood essence, Lu Ming left the Supreme shrine and helped Huaying to reorganize the northern Battlefront Army.</p><p>Two days later, the northern Battlefront Army had been reorganized. Lu Ming had almost 80000 soldiers under him. His strength had increased greatly.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was still not satisfied.</p><p>After this battle, Lu Ming had discovered the bloodscaled Wolf Army’s weakness.</p><p>Although the bloodscaled Wolf Army was powerful, most of them relied on their mounts. The soldiers ‘cultivation was too weak, and it was difficult for them to display the full strength of the bloodscaled Wolf Army.</p><p>Moreover, their numbers were too few. Originally, there were eight thousand of them, but after losing five or six hundred in this battle, their numbers had been reduced by a portion.</p><p>I have to think of a way to improve the soldiers ‘cultivation. Also, I have to capture some more bloodred scaled wolves!</p><p>Lu Ming considered in his heart.</p><p>Previously, they had only tamed a pack of bloodscale wolves. The endless plateau was endless, so there was no way that there was only one pack.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
