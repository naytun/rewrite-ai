It was as if he was in a furnace.</p><p>...</p><p>In front of the platform, there was a deep pit, and the road ahead was blocked.</p><p>In the deep pit, there was a hot wave of steam rising.</p><p>Lu Ming walked to the side of the platform and realized that the deep pit was round and had a diameter of at least a thousand meters. Flames filled the deep pit.</p><p>What was amazing was that this flame had three colors. The three-colored flame danced and was extremely gorgeous.</p><p>“This … Could this be the three-colored primordial fire?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered.</p><p>The three-colored true fire was a strange fire in the world. It was much more magical than ordinary flames and was also much more powerful.</p><p>On the other side of the deep pit was another platform. In front of the platform was a passage that went straight ahead, leading to an unknown place.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>If he was outside, he would be able to cover the distance of a thousand meters with a slight sway of his body.</p><p>But here, under the suppression of the inscription formation, he couldn’t even cross a hundred meters, let alone a thousand.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming found two chains on the left and right sides of the deep pit.</p><p>“Could it be that he passed through these two chains?”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>Ta ta ta.</p><p>At this moment, a series of hurried footsteps were heard.</p><p>Following that, more than twenty young men from the nether demon Palace appeared.</p><p>The leader was that tall youth, you feishi.</p><p>The moment you feishi saw Lu Ming, he immediately roared, ” “Kid, senior brother Fei Yu said that you have killed many disciples of my nether demon Palace. How dare you kill my disciples? you are courting death!”</p><p>With that, the twenty-one young experts, including the tall young man, charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>All 21 of them exuded a powerful aura.</p><p>Especially you feishi, who was the leader, his aura was extremely terrifying.</p><p>“Early 8th level of martial ancestor realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>You feishi’s cultivation had actually reached the early stage of the eighth level martial ancestor realm. The other three youths had reached the peak of the seventh level martial ancestor realm. The strength of their auras was even a little stronger than the flying Ape.</p><p>Lu Ming had no doubt that each of these people was a genius who had won three battles.</p><p>Apart from these four, the remaining dozen or so people were not weak either.</p><p>The twenty-one people quickly closed in on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Brat, die!”</p><p>You feishi revealed a hideous smile. A beam of sword light was incomparably dazzling as it charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>The terrifying attack was undoubtedly displayed. He was definitely a genius of three battles.</p><p>“You can’t take it head-on!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing.</p><p>In the early stage of martial ancestor 8-realm, coupled with three battle geniuses, her combat power had already exceeded his. If he took it head on, he would be in a very passive position.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed rapidly, trying to avoid the sword light.</p><p>Chi Chi Chi</p><p>The next moment, dozens of sword lights flew toward him.</p><p>“Nine Dragons trampling the heavens!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and the space trembled.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>More than ten sword gleams were shattered instantly, but there were still a few sword gleams that persevered and continued to slash at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed continuously.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>A sword light still hit him, leaving a sword wound on his chest, and blood flowed out.</p><p>“Dark Demon life-death Sword! Die!”</p><p>You feishi shouted and swung his sword. Two sword radiances, one black and one white, shot out and enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>He could not avoid it!</p><p>This sword was completely locked on Lu Ming. There was no way to avoid it.</p><p>“Heaven’s path palm!”</p><p>Lu Ming pushed his palm forward and a huge palm print blasted forward.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>First, it was a black sword light that exuded a sharp killing intent, clashing with the heavenly path palm print.</p><p>With a loud boom, the black sword radiance dispersed. However, the heaven path palm print was also penetrated. The White sword radiance flashed past and continued to blast toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>With a shake of the long spear, the Spear’s radiance shot out like a dragon.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Spear radiance and sword Qi swept in all directions. The demon subduing spear in Lu Ming’s hand actually bent, and an extremely powerful force surged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body could not help but retreat backward.</p><p>Behind him was the deep pit that contained the three-colored primordial fire.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body floated off the platform and was suspended in the air.</p><p>From below, a scorching aura surged up.</p><p>At the critical moment, Lu Ming waved his hand and a chain condensed from essential Qi wrapped around the iron chains on both sides of the deep pit.</p><p>“You still want to struggle? Die!”</p><p>You feishi slashed out a few more sword Qis, aiming at Lu Ming’s essential Qi chain.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The true energy chain was cut off and Lu Ming’s body fell rapidly into the deep pit.</p><p>“You dared to kill my nether demon Palace’s people. Dying in the sea of fire is already letting you off easy.”</p><p>You feishi sneered as he watched Lu Ming’s figure disappear into the sea of fire.</p><p>The temperature of the three-colored primordial fire was extremely terrifying. It was dozens of times, even hundreds of times stronger than ordinary flames.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated his essential Qi to resist but it was useless. His essential Qi actually started to burn.</p><p>One had to know that he cultivated the true war Dragon technique’s true Qi, which was much stronger than ordinary true Qi. If he couldn’t even withstand this, then ordinary true Qi would probably be burned to nothing in an instant.</p><p>Despite this, Lu Ming could not resist for long.</p><p>In all directions, there was an endless three colored true fire, burning fiercely and scorching.</p><p>Lu Ming’s essential Qi was being consumed at a rapid rate. Some parts of his essential Qi had even been burned through. The scorching flames surged in and Lu Ming’s body made sizzling sounds. If his physical body had not reached the upper tier of the sixth stage, he would have been burnt to ashes.</p><p>“What do we do? If this goes on, we’ll be dead!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was spinning rapidly as he thought of a way to escape.</p><p>It was difficult to fly in this place. Lu Ming’s body kept falling and the lower he fell, the more powerful the three-colored primordial fire was.</p><p>If this continued, he would not be able to hold on for long.</p><p>At this moment, a change occurred.</p><p>Lu Ming’s glabella glowed and something suddenly rushed out.</p><p>“This is Yi’s stone egg!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>Wasn’t this the stone egg that had shot out of the Heaven’s Gate in the Qianjiang water area?</p><p>He could sense a weak life aura from the stone egg. However, Lu Ming had used all sorts of methods but he could not make the stone egg react at all. Lu Ming thought that it was a useless egg?</p><p>However, the stone egg had rushed out of the Supreme shrine on its own. Most importantly, he had placed the stone egg in the Supreme shrine. It was unbelievable that the stone egg could rush out of the Supreme shrine on its own.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The stone egg flew out and hovered above Lu Ming’s head. It shook slightly, and a cool aura spread out and enveloped Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming felt the flames around him retreat. He felt a cool sensation all over his body, and there was no heat at all.</p><p>Although he was still falling, the three-colored primordial fire could no longer hurt him.</p><p>His body continued to fall, and in the blink of an eye, he had fallen a few thousand meters.</p><p>Suddenly, the surrounding scene changed. Lu Ming rushed out of the area of the three-colored primordial fire.</p><p>Lu Ming could see the ground tens of meters below him.</p><p>He flew down and landed on the ground.</p><p>He raised his head and looked up. There seemed to be a barrier dozens of meters above him that separated the three-colored primordial fire.</p><p>“Where is this place?”</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming sized up his surroundings.</p><p>In the next moment, his pupils suddenly shrank and his mind was greatly shaken.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
