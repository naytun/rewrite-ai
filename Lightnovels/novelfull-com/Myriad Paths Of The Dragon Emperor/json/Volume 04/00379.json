BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, a violent roar came from the front, as well as the strange cry of a ghost.</p><p>Someone was being attacked by the spirits.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he went closer. He then realized that it was a young man and woman who were surrounded by more than ten black Spirits.</p><p>These two young men and women were both at the early stage of the fifth rank and could be considered geniuses.</p><p>However, among the geniuses who had entered this time, they were considered to be at the lower end.</p><p>At this time, he was already surrounded by danger, and his body was covered in wounds. It was clearly the doing of the Black Spirit.</p><p>“Little sister, run! I’ll hold them back!”</p><p>The young man roared.</p><p>“Big brother, if you want to go, you go. I’ll hold them back!”</p><p>The young woman also called out.</p><p>However, with their battle prowess and their mastery of Shi, they did little damage to the spirits and were unable to escape the encirclement of the black Spirits.</p><p>The two of them charged left and right, but it was useless. Instead, they attracted more spirits.</p><p>“Damn things, I’m going to kill you!”</p><p>The young man roared as he crazily slashed with his saber.</p><p>However, it was useless. After the spirits were chopped apart, they gathered together again and did not shrink much.</p><p>On the contrary, he had a few more wounds on his body.</p><p>“Big brother!”</p><p>The young woman screamed in despair.</p><p>“Little sister, let’s go!”</p><p>The young man didn’t care and continued to attack the spirits.</p><p>But everything was in vain.</p><p>Just as the two of them were in despair.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the distance, Spears were shot out and stabbed the spirits.</p><p>Immediately, the spirits were scattered.</p><p>The young man and woman were stunned at first, but then they were ecstatic. They rushed out together and broke away from the encirclement of the spirits.</p><p>The next moment, the spirits gathered together again, but they were much smaller.</p><p>“It’s so much smaller?”</p><p>The two young men and women were extremely shocked.</p><p>The two of them were at the middle stages of the phenomenal success stage, but their attacks had little effect on the spirit lifeforms.</p><p>However, the spear light just now had caused the spirit to shrink by a large size. The force contained in the spear light was simply unbelievable.</p><p>Even a peak Shi couldn’t have this kind of power.</p><p>The two of them hurriedly looked in the direction where the spear ray came from.</p><p>A young figure walked over. He was too young, not even twenty years old.</p><p>This person was, of course, Lu Ming.</p><p>Gah gah …</p><p>At that moment, the spirits pounced toward Lu Ming and the other two.</p><p>“Not good, this brother, quickly leave!”</p><p>The young man’s expression changed drastically as he shouted.</p><p>“If we don’t get rid of these spirits, I’ll be able to leave, but you won’t!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“Solve? These specters are difficult to deal with. Brother, I beg you, please save my little sister. I’ll hold these specters back!”</p><p>The young man called out anxiously. He raised his saber and was about to step forward.</p><p>“No, we’ll leave together!”</p><p>The young woman also called out.</p><p>“Little sister, don’t be willful. Otherwise, you won’t be able to leave!”</p><p>The young man roared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At the same time, he slashed out with his saber. Rays of saber radiance slashed out, cutting the spirits in half. However, it was of no use. The spirits recovered immediately and continued to pounce.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The young man shouted.</p><p>“Your little sister is right. If we’re leaving, we’ll leave together!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming smiled faintly and suddenly took a step forward.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>&Nbsp; a terrifying energy began to spread forward.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>More than a dozen spirits exploded like balloons. After they exploded, they could not be condensed at all. They turned into energy and dissipated.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>The young man and woman were stunned.</p><p>With a single kick, more than a dozen spirits were crushed, and they could not even condense.</p><p>What kind of strength was this? Or rather, what kind of force was this that it was so terrifying?</p><p>According to their understanding, these specters were extremely difficult to destroy. Even a peak Shi wouldn’t have much of an effect. Those peerless geniuses had extremely profound cultivation, but if they encountered these specters alone, they would most likely be in danger.</p><p>Only those peerless geniuses who had already comprehended a trace of ‘intent’ through force could quickly kill these spirits.</p><p>However, there shouldn’t be many of such geniuses in the entire Eastern Region of the Tianxuan region.</p><p>To comprehend a trace of intent through force, as long as one’s cultivation reached the peak of martial ancestor 9-dan, they could be called a half-step King.</p><p>How many people could reach this stage in their twenties?</p><p>Could it be that this young man who was not even twenty years old was a genius of that level?</p><p>The young man and woman let their imagination run wild.</p><p>“Let’s go now!”</p><p>Lu Ming interrupted their daze and took the lead to fly forward.</p><p>The two young men and women hurriedly followed.</p><p>The reason why Lu Ming had saved the two of them was not because he had a burst of compassion. It was just that he felt that the two of them had a deep brother-sister relationship and were willing to sacrifice themselves for others in the face of danger. Lu Ming was touched and saved them in passing.</p><p>With Lu Ming leading the way, as long as they did not encounter too many spirits, it would not be a big problem. The three of them continued on their way and time passed slowly.</p><p>Five or six hours later, the first ray of light appeared on the horizon.</p><p>Purple Qi rose from the East, and a ray of sunlight shone on the earth.</p><p>The moment the sun appeared, all the spirits in the world disappeared without a trace. The dark clouds in the sky also dispersed. Then, the sound of insects and beasts could be heard. The scene was full of vitality and everything returned to normal as if nothing had happened.</p><p>The three of them heaved a sigh of relief and were secretly amazed.</p><p>This ancient battlefield of the netherworld was truly wondrous.</p><p>brother, I’m song Yu and this is my sister, Song Jing. I really have to thank you for your help this time. Otherwise, we would have died in this ancient battlefield.</p><p>The young man bowed to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Brother song, you don’t have to be so polite. I was just passing by!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“No matter what, we will always remember your kindness. Oh right, may I know your name?”</p><p>Song Yu cupped her fists and said.</p><p>Song Jing was obviously more shy. She blinked her big eyes at Lu Ming and did not say anything.</p><p>“I’m lu Ming!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“It’s brother Lu!”</p><p>Song Yu cupped her fists again.</p><p>“I don’t know what the two of you are planning to do next. To be honest, with your cultivation, I’m afraid you’ll be in trouble if you go out at night.”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“We were quite unlucky. When we were teleported here, we were separated from the people in our area. We don’t know how far away we were, so we could only find a city to hide in. According to our family elders, there should be a small city not far from this forest. We wanted to hide there, but before we arrived, the sky turned dark.”</p><p>Song Yu explained.</p><p>“Is there a small city up ahead?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“An elder of our family once participated in the selection in the eastern nether ancient battlefield a hundred years ago. According to him, there should be a small city ahead. It shouldn’t be wrong. Brother Lu, why don’t we go together?”</p><p>Song Yu explained and invited him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
