There were a total of twenty-nine intent crystals.</p><p>...</p><p>‘I’m rich, I’m rich, I’m rich.’</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were shining.</p><p>He didn’t need any other gains. Just these intent crystals were enough for him to make a killing.</p><p>Lu Ming closed the box and kept it in the Supreme shrine.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming picked up the notebook and flipped it open.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming was a little disappointed. This was not a secret cultivation technique or martial arts technique book. Instead, it was a book on the experience of refining pills.</p><p>It seemed that this ancient ruin was the residence of an alchemy Grandmaster, and everything was related to alchemy.</p><p>Lu Ming did not know much about the Dao of inscription. He flipped through a few pages and put it away.</p><p>Finally, he walked towards the pill furnace.</p><p>The pill furnace was as tall as a person. It had an ancient and simple design, and there were all sorts of flower patterns carved on it.</p><p>However, it looked pitch black. Although it didn’t decay like the other pill furnaces, it didn’t seem to have any spirituality.</p><p>forget it, I’ll keep it first. Maybe I can sell it for a good price!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and kept the alchemy furnace in his storage ring.</p><p>After making another round and finding nothing, Lu Ming walked out of the bronze Hall. He realized that hanliu mu and the rest were no longer there.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He did not mind. He randomly chose a path and headed out.</p><p>After leaving the legacy site, Lu Ming did not stay any longer. He turned into a ray of light and flew back to the city.</p><p>When Lu Ming returned to the city, he heard a piece of shocking news.</p><p>The Dragon’s Den had opened.</p><p>A Dragon’s Den?</p><p>Lu Ming was greatly shocked.</p><p>A dragon’s cave was said to be the lair of a Dragon. In the distant past, there were true dragons that rested. It was a very famous wondrous place in the ancient battlefield of the netherworld.</p><p>However, the dragon’s cave, as well as the surrounding wide area, was shrouded in runes and could not be opened at all.</p><p>It was said that even the experts of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace could not open it.</p><p>The last time it opened was a few thousand years ago. Now, it actually opened again?</p><p>It was a land of peerless treasures. It was said that there were countless spiritual medicines and even secret treasures left behind by true dragons.</p><p>Everyone’s hearts were burning with passion as they left the city and headed for the dragon’s cave.</p><p>“A dragon’s cave! I can’t miss this!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered, his eyes shining.</p><p>He cultivated the true war Dragon technique and the nine Dragons heaven-trampling steps, and he had awakened the bloodline of the nine Dragons.</p><p>Everything was related to Dragons, so how could he miss a dragon’s cave?</p><p>The true war Dragon technique had been stuck at the fifth level for a long time, and it was difficult to break through. If he could obtain a treasure related to the true dragon, he might be able to break through.</p><p>At once, Lu Ming rose into the air and headed in the direction of the dragon’s cave.</p><p>The dragon’s cave was located in a vast mountain range in the West. It was more than a million miles away from this place.</p><p>Lu Ming sped along. When night fell, Lu Ming entered the Supreme shrine.</p><p>Then, he took out the level 5 spirit herbs he had obtained from you feishi and the others and activated the ten thousand spiritual combat body to improve his physical body.</p><p>Lu Ming’s physical body was improving rapidly again.</p><p>The next day, Lu Ming continued on his journey.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>When Lu Ming passed by a forest, he heard a roar coming from ahead.</p><p>Someone was fighting!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved and he leaped into the forest like a ghost.</p><p>The rumbling sound grew louder and louder. Lu Ming approached quickly and flew onto a big tree that required several people to hug it. He hid in the branches and looked ahead.</p><p>A few thousand meters away, more than a hundred figures surrounded a figure.</p><p>“Sword wind cloud!”</p><p>Lu Ming could tell at a glance that the figure who was surrounded was the number one genius on the cloud Emperor ranking, Jian Fengyun.</p><p>“Young master Tong Tian she, LAN Yundao and Yan feixun are also here.”</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze and saw young master Tian she, LAN Yundao, and the others among the people who had surrounded Jian Fengyun.</p><p>Not only that, but there were also geniuses from the thousand River region.</p><p>Lu Ming saw autumn water, Jiang Chun, and a young man who was as elegant as Jade. This person was ranked 18th in the thousand River region and had once left a scar on Jian Fengyun’s face.</p><p>In addition, there were many experts from the waters of the thousand rivers who Lu Ming did not know.</p><p>Jian Fengyun, I advise you to stop your futile struggle. You will die today!</p><p>Young master Tian she sneered.</p><p>Tian she, you’re so despicable! How dare you surrender to the thousand River region and become their lackeys! I, Jian Fengyun, am ashamed to be on the same side as you!</p><p>Jian Fengyun roared.</p><p>At this moment, there were no less than ten wounds on his body, and he was drenched in blood.</p><p>Jian Fengyun, don’t be so rude. This is called ‘a wise man submits to circumstances’. The geniuses of the thousand rivers and waters have the potential of Dragons and phoenixes. They are all outstanding talents. You can’t compare to them. I joined them because I want to learn from them!</p><p>Jian Fengyun, if you surrender now, I can help you plead for mercy and let you Live!</p><p>Young master Tian she shouted.</p><p>Young master Tian she was originally proud and arrogant, thinking that he was a rare genius in the world. However, after entering the eastern nether ancient battlefield, he realized that he was wrong, terribly wrong.</p><p>There were too many geniuses, and any one of them was no weaker than him. There were also many who were stronger than him.</p><p>Especially when they encountered the experts of the thousand River region, he immediately surrendered. Of course, LAN Yundao, Yan feixun, and the others also surrendered.</p><p>As the lackeys of the thousand River region, they killed those on the cloud Emperor ranking who didn’t surrender and surrounded Jian Fengyun.</p><p>“This Tian she, as a dog, is quite suitable.”</p><p>Among the crowd, a young man in a blue robe with a Big River on it said with a smile.</p><p>“Brother Wan is right. The reason why I didn’t kill them is because I think I can use them to better control the cloud Emperor mountain range in the future. It’s better than killing them!”</p><p>The young man with the title of God replied. With his talent, he appeared very respectful beside this young man.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>The blue-robed youth nodded.</p><p>At this moment, Jian Fengyun’s hair stood on end as he shouted, ” “Wei tianshe, you’re shameless and afraid of death. Why would I, Jian Fengyun, be afraid of death? They’re just a bunch of lackeys!”</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>Young master Tian she shouted in anger. Being called a Lackey by Jian Fengyun, young master Tian she’s face turned red.</p><p>“Jian Fengyun, isn’t this all your fault? and that b * stard Lu Ming, you guys were blind and audacious to have offended the geniuses of the thousand River region. If you had been honest and sought refuge with the geniuses of the thousand rivers, there wouldn’t have been so many problems today!”</p><p>Young master Tian she roared hysterically.</p><p>that’s right. Jian Fengyun, you’ve brought this upon yourself. You failed to recognize a formidable person, especially Lu Ming, that little b * stard. He even dared to injure a heaven’s favorite of the thousand River region. He deserves to die!</p><p>LAN Yundao also shouted.</p><p>“Hahaha, a bunch of scum, the most shameless of them all. Back then, I should have worked with Lu Ming to kill all of you!”</p><p>Jian Fengyun laughed out loud.</p><p>“Jian Fengyun, you don’t have the chance to do so now. Prepare to die. Also, Lu Ming, that b * stard, will die sooner or later. When the time comes, you two will be companions.”</p><p>Young master Tian she sneered.</p><p>“Oh, really? I’m right here, let’s see how you kill me!”</p><p>Suddenly, a cold voice sounded.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
