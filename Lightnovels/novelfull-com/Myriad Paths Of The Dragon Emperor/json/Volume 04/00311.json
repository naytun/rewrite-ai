He thrust his spear.</p><p>Wind Fire kill!</p><p>This person was only in the third tier martial arts Grandmaster realm. He could not withstand Lu Ming’s attack at all and was pierced through the air by the spear.</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze across the battlefield and analyzed the situation.</p><p>Most of the experts of the burning sun Empire came from the mystic essence sword sect and the ghostmoon saber sect, so they were obviously at a disadvantage.</p><p>Even higher up in the sky, there was a violent explosion. A powerful aura spread down. It was the aura of a seventh level martial arts Grandmaster.</p><p>Not far away, Qiu Yue was wearing a white dress and exuded an extremely cold aura. With a wave of her hand, the cold air was threatening and everything was frozen.</p><p>After not seeing her for a while, Qiu Yue had become even more beautiful. Her curves were graceful, and her figure was even more voluptuous. However, her beautiful face was extremely cold, even colder than the aura she emitted.</p><p>Judging from Qiu Yue’s aura, she had already reached the early stage of the second level of the martial ancestor realm. Her cultivation had progressed so quickly that even Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>Her opponent was a third level martial ancestor realm expert, but he was completely suppressed by Qiu Yue.</p><p>“Absolute Frost!”</p><p>die! Qiu Yue shouted and waved her hands. Endless coldness emerged. Her opponent roared, but the next moment, he turned into an ice sculpture. Qiu Yue slapped out and the ice sculpture was shattered into pieces.</p><p>A third level martial ancestor realm martial artist had been killed by Qiu Yue with ease.</p><p>“You little b * tch, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>At this moment, a sharp sound was heard, and a bright sword light was sent toward Qiu Yue.</p><p>Qiu Yue’s expression changed and she moved quickly to avoid the sword light.</p><p>There was a flash of light and an old man with white hair appeared in front of Qiu Yue. He looked at Qiu Yue with a cold expression.</p><p>“Little slut, die!”</p><p>Old ou let out a cold cry, and his sword light flashed as he charged toward Qiu Yue.</p><p>Wu Zong 5-stage!</p><p>Old ou was at stage five. His sword light was bright and sharp, and he completely suppressed Qiu Yue.</p><p>“Rise!”</p><p>Qiu Yue shouted. A blood-red light flashed on her body, and a human figure with unclear facial features appeared. This figure was extremely cold, as if it was completely made of ice.</p><p>At the same time, five silver chakras flickered around the figure.</p><p>However, old ou and Lu Ming still saw it.</p><p>A fifth level royal bloodline. The second bloodline that Qiu Yue had awakened was actually a fifth level royal bloodline. Lu Ming was shocked beyond words.</p><p>But on second thought, it felt normal.</p><p>Qiu Yue’s first bloodline was a natural ice bloodline that was extremely powerful among the special bloodlines. It was a rank 8 bloodline.</p><p>It was normal for the second bloodline to be powerful.</p><p>However, old ou was frightened. Then, he shouted with a ferocious face, ” “Die, die, I can’t let you live in this world!”</p><p>As he shouted, a terrifying sword Qi whistled and rushed towards Qiu Yue.</p><p>After Qiu Yue’s bloodline was activated, her combat strength had increased by a large margin. Although she was still at a disadvantage, she would not lose for the time being.</p><p>However, at this moment, a black-robed figure appeared not far from Qiu Yue and stared at her coldly.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Suddenly, the black-robed man made his move. A jet-black sword light shot out from his hand towards Qiu Yue.</p><p>He was actually in the 5th level of the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>“You’re the one who’s going to die!”</p><p>The moment the black-robed man appeared, Lu Ming had already rushed over. He shouted coldly and swept his spear.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The long spear struck the black-robed man’s long sword. The long sword trembled violently and almost exploded.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>The black-robed man’s body trembled, and he quickly retreated.</p><p>“The person who will kill you!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and charged at the other party.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The power of wind and Fire wrapped around the spear, making it extremely fast and explosive.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The black-robed man was hit by the spear. He screamed and his body exploded.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming only needed one move to kill a fifth level martial arts Grandmaster.</p><p>The nine Dragon bloodline circulated and devoured the blood essence of the other party.</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming’s body trembled. He had a breakthrough in his cultivation.</p><p>He had reached the late stage of martial ancestor 2-dan.</p><p>The blood essence he had devoured was too rich, and there was still a large portion that had not been refined.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>With a breakthrough in his cultivation, Lu Ming’s combat strength had become even stronger. He moved and appeared beside old ou who was fighting Qiu Yue. He thrust his spear forward, and the Spear’s radiance was like lightning.</p><p>ah! old ou screamed in horror and wanted to Dodge, but everything was in vain. The next moment, a large hole appeared in his chest.</p><p>Lu Ming was like a god of War with his spear in hand.</p><p>“You f * ck!”</p><p>Qiu Yue looked at Lu Ming and her heart trembled.</p><p>She did not know why, but when she saw Lu Ming, she felt that he was extremely familiar.</p><p>Although their body shape and appearance were completely different, she was too familiar with that temperament.</p><p>For a moment, she was stunned.</p><p>“Why? Little girl, you don’t even recognize your young master?”</p><p>Lu Ming walked to Qiu Yue’s side and smiled.</p><p>Upon hearing this, Qiu Yue’s body suddenly trembled. Her beautiful eyes suddenly widened and she stared straight at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Young master Shaojie? It’s really you, is it really you?”</p><p>Qiu Yue’s eyes were filled with tears as she said emotionally.</p><p>“Little girl, who else could it be if not me!”</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out his finger and grazed the tip of Qiu Yue’s fair and tender nose.</p><p>Qiu Yue was so excited that her entire body trembled, and her tears immediately flowed down.”Young master, young master, Qiuyue has finally found young master!”</p><p>If there was not a huge battle here, she would have pounced into Lu Ming’s arms long ago.</p><p>Back then, she had been taken to a secret place by her master and had gone into seclusion to cultivate. Her cultivation progress had been extremely terrifying.</p><p>However, when she ended her cultivation and returned to the mystical sword sect, she heard a piece of shocking news.</p><p>Lu Ming charged into the White Tiger Hall and killed many people from the Duanmu family. In the end, he was forced by the Duanmu family to withdraw from the mystical sword sect and disappeared without a trace.</p><p>This news was like a bolt out of the blue for Qiu Yue.</p><p>If her master had not stopped her, she would have already killed her way into the White Tiger Hall.</p><p>During this period of time, she had traveled all over the world but there was no news about Lu Ming.</p><p>If it wasn’t for the fact that she couldn’t forget her master’s kindness, she would have left the mystical sword sect of her own accord.</p><p>This time, she had come with the mystic essence sword sect’s experts to support the ghost moon saber sect. One reason was to gain experience, and the other was to look for Lu Ming.</p><p>They wanted to try their luck and see if they could get any news about Lu Ming.</p><p>She did not expect Lu Ming to suddenly appear beside her.</p><p>The excitement in her heart could be imagined.</p><p>“Silly girl, why are you crying? Let’s kill the enemy first, and we’ll have a good chat after we’ve defeated them!”</p><p>Lu Ming reached out and wiped Qiu Yue’s tears.</p><p>“En, okay, young master!”</p><p>Qiu Yue’s tears turned into a smile, and her face revealed a smile that was brighter than flowers.</p><p>“You still have the mood to be so lovey-dovey at this time. Let this old man send the two of you on your way to the underworld!”</p><p>Suddenly, a dry and hoarse voice sounded.</p><p>A skinny, cold-looking old man appeared not far away and sneered at the two.</p><p>His body exuded a powerful aura.</p><p>He was in the seventh level of the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
