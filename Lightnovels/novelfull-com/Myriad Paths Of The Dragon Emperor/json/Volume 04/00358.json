He helped him calculate.</p><p>Yang Liuji’s expression changed.</p><p>Lu Ming could actually block one of his moves. His gaze turned serious.</p><p>“Fist of the great divine sun, fist radiance shatters the sky!”</p><p>Yang Liuji roared again and threw a punch.</p><p>This punch was even more terrifying. It was like a sun falling down.</p><p>Yang Liuji, who had reached the peak of the fifth stage of martial arts Grandmaster realm, had extremely terrifying combat power. An ordinary warrior at the peak of the seventh stage of martial arts Grandmaster realm would probably only have this kind of combat power.</p><p>“Beast palm!”</p><p>Lu Ming struck out another palm.</p><p>A huge beast claw appeared and grabbed at the sun-like fist energy.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The sun-like fist force was like a pitiful little flame that was extinguished by the beast’s claw.</p><p>“Two moves!”</p><p>Lu Ming said again.</p><p>The people watching the battle were stunned, especially those on the fifth floor.</p><p>Lu Ming could actually fight with yang Liuji. This was too unbelievable. The blazing sun Empire was too terrifying. Experts were emerging one after another.</p><p>“Argh! Damn it, divine fist of the great sun, incinerating the world.”</p><p>Yang Liuji roared in anger and used his strongest move. At the same time, his bloodline power exploded.</p><p>His bloodline was also at the second level of the king tier.</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>The lake water below churned and actually boiled.</p><p>A shocking fist radiance came crashing down on Lu Ming from above.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Lu Ming said softly. A long spear appeared in his hand and he thrust it upward.</p><p>Chi Chi!</p><p>The long spear pierced through yang Liuji’s fist radiance. Lu Ming’s body rushed past it and flew into the sky.</p><p>“Three moves, yang Liuji, you said you’d kill me in three moves, but it turns out that you want to kill me with just the power to scratch an itch? What a joke!”</p><p>Lu Ming said contemptuously.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it, how did this little bastard become so strong? How is that possible?”</p><p>Yang Liuji roared in his heart, his expression extremely ugly. He stared at Lu Ming and said coldly, ” “I’ll let you go today, and we’ll fight another day!”</p><p>With that, she wanted to leave.</p><p>“Another day? Did I say another day? You want to leave after a fight? how can there be such a good thing in the world? Stay here!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. A terrifying aura enveloped yang Liuji.</p><p>“What do you want to do? Do you still want to make a move on me? How dare you? I’m a disciple of the great sun mansion, do you understand? I’m a disciple of the great sun mansion!”</p><p>Yang Liuji roared.</p><p>&Nbsp; ” you don’t need to repeat that you are a disciple of great sun Prefecture. Great sun Prefecture is none of my business. I don’t care where you are from. Just take one of my attacks and you’ll die!</p><p>Lu Ming bellowed, his aura was wild as he pulled the long spear downward.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A spear light that was hundreds of meters long, carrying the power of wind and Fire, came down on yang Liuji.</p><p>While the spear radiance was still in the air, the lake below was suppressed by the force of the air. The lake water split into two, and a waterless zone that was a few hundred meters long appeared. It had the same shape as the spear radiance.</p><p>“You coward! Ah!”</p><p>Yang Liuji roared and used all his strength to punch the air a dozen times in an attempt to block the spear radiance.</p><p>However, it was useless. The dozen or so fist lights were like fireworks and collapsed in one strike.</p><p>The spear radiance’s momentum did not stop as it heavily smashed into yang Liuji’s body.</p><p>Yang Liuji’s body was like a cannonball, falling towards the lake.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>He fell heavily into the lake, causing huge waves.</p><p>Even the ground shook, and a Whirlpool appeared on the surface of the lake. Everyone saw that yang Liuji had smashed a deep hole in the bottom of the lake, and the lake water had completely flooded yang Liuji.</p><p>“This f * ck!”</p><p>The surrounding spectators were all dumbfounded.</p><p>&Nbsp; this was too violent. He had defeated yang Liuji with one move and yang Liuji had no chance to fight back.</p><p>Especially the spectators on the fifth level. Their mouths were so wide open that they could practically swallow a chicken.</p><p>this is crazy! The burning sun Empire is crazy! How can there be so many talented Warriors? ”</p><p>that’s right. The burning sun Empire has always been ranked at the bottom of the list. It’s unbelievable that so many geniuses have been born!</p><p>The people on the fifth floor shouted in disbelief.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, a figure rushed into the lake and came out again the next moment.</p><p>It was LAN Yunfei. He was holding yang Liuji in his arms.</p><p>Yang Liuji’s body was covered in blood, and his face was pale. Blood was dripping from his mouth, and his eyes were full of disbelief, shame, and anger.</p><p>Previously, he had boasted shamelessly that he would kill Lu Ming in three moves. In the end, Lu Ming easily received his three moves. Not only that, but he had also beaten him half to death in one move.</p><p>This made him want to find a hole to hide in.</p><p>“If you don’t have the strength, then keep a low profile. Don’t always act like you’re the best in the world. It’s embarrassing. This time, I’ll teach you a lesson. Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand, as if an elder was lecturing a junior.</p><p>“You win!”</p><p>Yang Liuji was so furious that he spat out another mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t be so arrogant. You’d better not run into my big brother during the Ditian Divine Guard selection. Otherwise, you’ll die an ugly death. Let’s go!”</p><p>LAN Yunfei roared in anger, then his figure soared into the sky.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and did not mind. He returned to the restaurant in a flash.</p><p>“Come, let’s continue eating!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed and sat down to eat and drink again. The rest of the people in the restaurant were dumbfounded.</p><p>“Brother Lu, we must guard against the Big Brother that LAN Yunfei spoke of!”</p><p>Feng Wuji’s face turned solemn.</p><p>that’s right, the fifth ranked genius on the cloud Emperor board also has the surname LAN, his name is LAN Yundao. I’m pretty sure he’s LAN Yunfei’s big brother!</p><p>Ling Yanchi’s expression was also serious.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s combat strength was strong, they did not think that Lu Ming could be a match for those who were ranked at the top of the cloud Emperor ranking.</p><p>Those people were too powerful. They were all monsters.</p><p>“Fifth on the cloud Emperor ranking?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and his lips curled into a smile. He did not mind and continued to eat and drink.</p><p>After a short while, the four of them left the restaurant and found an Inn to stay in.</p><p>There were still three days before the Ditian Divine Guard’s preliminary competition.</p><p>At this moment, news of Xie nianqing, Lu Ming, LAN Yunfei, and yang Liuji’s battle spread quickly.</p><p>Many people were shocked and secretly sighed. There were so many geniuses these days, and yet another unknown genius had risen.</p><p>In a room in the inn, Lu Ming sat cross-legged and thought about the battle.</p><p>Speaking of which, this was the first time that Lu Ming had a direct battle with a genius on the cloud Emperor ranking.</p><p>Although he appeared confident on the surface, he did not dare to underestimate his opponent.</p><p>Yang Liuji was only ranked 33rd on the cloud Emperor list, but his cultivation had already reached the peak of the fifth stage of martial ancestor realm. His combat strength was comparable to an ordinary peak of the seventh stage of martial ancestor realm.</p><p>In that case, how strong were the geniuses at the top of the rankings?</p><p>Especially the geniuses in the top ten, how strong were they?</p><p>Lu Ming did not dare to underestimate his opponent.</p><p>my biggest disadvantage now is that my cultivation is low. I’m only at the peak of the 4th level of the martial ancestor realm. I have to find a way to break through as soon as possible!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered secretly.</p><p>After a few months of polishing, Lu Ming’s Foundation had long been stable. As long as there was enough energy, Lu Ming’s cultivation would be able to break through.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
