When he saw the score on the stone tablet, young master Tian she’s face changed greatly and he roared, ” “Impossible, Jian Fengyun. How could your score be so much higher than mine? impossible!”</p><p>...</p><p>It was more than 600 points higher. This was not just a little bit, it was several levels higher.</p><p>Young master Tian she couldn’t believe that the gap between him and Jian Fengyun was so huge.</p><p>“Nothing is impossible. Tian she, you’ve been hiding in this corner of the cloud Emperor mountain range. You think you’re a peerless genius, but you’re just a frog in a well. There are many people like you in the world.”</p><p>Jian Fengyun said indifferently.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>Young master Tian she roared, thinking that Jian Fengyun was trying to hurt him.</p><p>Jian Fengyun sneered and walked to the side. He didn’t bother to talk to young master Tian she.</p><p>The others were extremely shocked.</p><p>Jian Fengyun was too strong. No wonder he was ranked first on the cloud Emperor board. He was way ahead of the second place and no one else could surpass him.</p><p>Lu Xiu nodded his head. The cloud Emperor mountain range would have to rely on Jian Fengyun for the Emperor sky Divine Guard selection this time.</p><p>The ranking on the second stone stele had changed.</p><p>Jian Fengyun was in first place, while young master Tian she was in second place, having more than 100 points higher than Jiang hongwen.</p><p>Jiang hongwen was third.</p><p>As for LAN Yundao and the others, they were pushed back three places.</p><p>alright, Group Nine, get ready!</p><p>Lu Xiu announced.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s go together. Let’s see who can suppress who!”</p><p>Xie nianqing glanced at Lu Ming, his eyes filled with provocation.</p><p>“I’ll keep you company!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>The two of them strode out.</p><p>Feng Wuji and Ling Yanchi also rushed forward.</p><p>Xie nianqing has made his move. Her Shi has reached a terrifying level of perfection. I wonder what rank she’ll get? ”</p><p>it’s hard to say. The myriad illusionary killing array tests one’s overall combat power. Although Xie nianqing’s control force is strong, his overall combat power might not be that strong. He also has to consider the bloodline level, cultivation method, physical cultivation, and comprehension of martial arts techniques. Xie nianqing’s cultivation is too low, so he might not be able to get too high. It’ll be good if he can make it to the 36th place.</p><p>you’re right. The top thirty-six are equivalent to being on the cloud Emperor board.</p><p>look, Shangguan Yunyan and the others have made their move!</p><p>The surrounding crowd was in a heated discussion when suddenly, a cry of surprise could be heard.</p><p>Shangguan Yunyan, the fourth genius on the cloud Emperor board, and the only woman in the top ten, was peerless.</p><p>In addition, there were a few geniuses in the top ten of the cloud Emperor board, such as the sixth and eighth.</p><p>This batch was also worth watching.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he was directly ignored.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had defeated yang Liuji, what was his ranking now?</p><p>He was about to fall out of the cloud Emperor ranking.</p><p>Even if Lu Ming could defeat him, how powerful could he be? At most, he would be able to enter the cloud Emperor board, which would not attract anyone’s interest.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The 50 people rushed into the ten thousand illusionary killing array and disappeared.</p><p>The moment Lu Ming rushed into the light screen, he suddenly felt that the sky and earth were spinning. The next moment, he realized that he was standing on a grassland.</p><p>In front of him, there was a flash of light, and demonic beasts began to form.</p><p>There were a total of twenty Black Tigers. They looked at Lu Ming with murderous intent and roared before pouncing at him.</p><p>it’s equivalent to the early stage of the fifth level of martial ancestor realm. Killing one will give you one point!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and some information flashed in his mind.</p><p>At the same time, the demon subduing spear appeared in his hand, and he swept it out.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Like fireworks, the twenty demonic beasts that were equivalent to the early stage of the fifth level martial arts Grandmaster realm were all blown up by Lu Ming’s spear. They turned into wisps of energy and dissipated in the air.</p><p>Huhu ~</p><p>After the 20 giant tigers exploded, energy swept through the air. After a few breaths, another 20 giant tigers appeared.</p><p>The only difference was that the auras of these 20 giant tigers were much stronger than before, reaching the middle stage of martial ancestor 5-dan.</p><p>In the middle stage of the martial ancestor realm, killing one would give him two points.</p><p>It was the same for everyone who entered. They would encounter 20 demonic beasts at the early stage of the fifth martial ancestor realm at the beginning. After killing all of them, stronger demonic beasts would appear.</p><p>In the early stage of the fifth level of the martial ancestor realm, killing one would give one point.</p><p>In the middle stage of martial ancestor realm Level 5, killing one would give him two points.</p><p>Later stage of the fifth level of the martial ancestor realm, each of them was worth three points.</p><p>…</p><p>And so on, for every small level, the points gained from killing one would increase by one point.</p><p>For example, the peak of the fifth level of the martial ancestor realm was worth four points, and the early stage of the sixth level was worth five points.</p><p>In order to obtain 500 points and pass the preliminaries, one had to at least reach the later stage of the sixth level of the martial arts Grandmaster realm and kill at least six existences of the later stage of the sixth level of the martial arts Grandmaster realm.</p><p>To be able to kill six of the 20 demonic beasts of the martial ancestor realm advanced stage, his overall combat strength was probably comparable to the peak of the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>The 20 giant tigers in the middle of the fifth level martial ancestor realm were still unable to fight back against Lu Ming.</p><p>Whoosh! Xiu! Xiu!</p><p>Lu Ming’s spear trembled and rays of spear radiance burst out. Twenty giant tigers were shot and exploded by the spear radiance.</p><p>On the stone tablet outside, Lu Ming’s points naturally soared.</p><p>However, it didn’t attract too much attention. In the beginning, it was normal for the points to soar.</p><p>In the myriad illusionary killing array, the killing continued.</p><p>After the 20 Tigers were killed, another 20 demonic beasts of the martial ancestor realm advanced stage appeared.</p><p>It was still an easy kill.</p><p>Then, there were 20 giant tigers at the peak of the fifth level of the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>After the 20 giant tigers at the peak of the fifth level of the martial arts Grandmaster realm were killed, the world suddenly changed. Lu Ming realized that he was in a swamp.</p><p>Whoosh! Xiu! Xiu!</p><p>From the swamp, twenty huge snakes as thick as a bowl suddenly shot out and pounced towards Lu Ming.</p><p>The strength of its aura was a lot stronger than the giant Tiger from before.</p><p>It was a demonic beast in the early stage of martial ancestor 6-dan.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was calm as he continued to stab with his long spear.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The giant snakes exploded in the air.</p><p>A sixth level martial ancestor realm demonic beast was no match for Lu Ming and could not do anything to stop him.</p><p>Lu Ming swept down with a destructive force.</p><p>His points also skyrocketed.</p><p>Very quickly, he had surpassed 500 points.</p><p>It continued to rise. 600 points, 700 points.</p><p>By the time Lu Ming had killed all 20 demonic beasts at the peak of the sixth level martial ancestor realm, his score had reached 720.</p><p>At this moment, the surrounding scene changed again.</p><p>It turned into a huge mountain, surrounded by rocks.</p><p>Suddenly, the rocks in the surroundings started to wriggle, turning into giant stone men that were three meters tall. There were twenty stone men in total.</p><p>Thump! Dong!</p><p>Each of the stone golems was equivalent to the early stage of the seventh level martial Grandmaster realm. They held a Mace made of stone in their hands. They stomped on the ground and charged at Lu Ming with a loud boom.</p><p>The mace came crashing down on Lu Ming like a huge mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and his body shot out like a cannonball. The power of wind and Fire on his long spear merged and he swept out.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>One of the golems was struck by the spear and exploded, sending debris flying everywhere.</p><p>Instantly, Lu Ming’s points increased by nine.</p><p>Even an early stage of the 7th level of the martial arts Grandmaster realm could not stop Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
