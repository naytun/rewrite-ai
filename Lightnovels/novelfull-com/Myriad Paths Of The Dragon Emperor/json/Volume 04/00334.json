This suppression had lasted for more than ten years.</p><p>If Lu Ming had not encountered this by chance, he would not have been able to escape the fate of being refined into the yinyue demonic chief.</p><p>On the way, Yan Quan’s expression suddenly changed slightly, revealing a bitter smile, I’ve been suppressed for more than ten years, and I’ve been seriously injured. I’ve also forcefully activated my secret skill earlier, and now that the time limit is up, I need to find a place to heal.</p><p>“Senior’s healing is more important!” Lu Ming said.</p><p>Immediately, the two of them found a hidden place. Yan Quan sat cross-legged and began to heal his injuries.</p><p>Lu Ming had the Golden-eyed blood corpse patrol the surroundings while he sat cross-legged.</p><p>Previously, he had devoured a large amount of blood essence, and now he was just about to start refining.</p><p>Half of it was absorbed by the bloodline, while the other half was converted into true Qi.</p><p>There were dozens of mo clan’s martial arts grandmasters. Among them, there were a few in the eighth level of the martial arts Grandmaster realm and the head of the mo clan, who was in the ninth level of martial arts Grandmaster realm.</p><p>How strong was the power of blood essence?</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation level rose rapidly again. After a day, Lu Ming’s cultivation level rose to the peak of the fourth level of the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>However, at this point, no matter how hard Lu Ming tried, he could not break through.</p><p>Lu Ming knew that his cultivation level had increased too quickly, causing his essential Qi to be impure and his Foundation to be unstable. He needed a period of time to Polish it before he could continue to improve.</p><p>Lu Ming then used the remaining blood essence to improve his Blood Meridian.</p><p>However, after refining all the blood essence, the nine Dragon bloodline was still king class and did not improve.</p><p>It was too difficult to improve one’s bloodline.</p><p>At this time, Yan Quan was still circulating his energy to heal his injuries. His entire body was suffused with waves of scarlet red aura. It was incomparably hot as he recuperated his body.</p><p>Yan Quan’s healing took seven days.</p><p>Seven days later, Yan Quan opened his eyes.</p><p>“Senior, how do you feel?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>after being suppressed for more than ten years, I have too many hidden injuries. It will be difficult to heal them in a short time. However, I have stabilized them for the time being. If I go all out during the war, it will not be a problem. As for the other hidden injuries, I will slowly recuperate. It will not take long for them to recover.</p><p>Yan Quan said.</p><p>“That’s good!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>Then, the three of them continued their journey.</p><p>With the speed of the three of them, it only took half a day to return to Moonview city.</p><p>Of course, on the way, Lu Ming put on his mask again and returned to tianyun’s appearance.</p><p>“Lord Marquis has returned.”</p><p>The blood red Cavalry in charge of patrolling the camp shouted in surprise when they saw Lu Ming.</p><p>Immediately after, the news of Lu Ming’s return spread throughout Moonview city at a crazy speed, causing a huge sensation.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Two figures flew over at high speed.</p><p>They were Qiu Yue and Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Young master!”</p><p>Qiu Yue was extremely excited when she saw Lu Ming. She was not afraid of being embarrassed and threw herself into Lu Ming’s arms. Her tears flowed like pearls and she cried like a Pear Blossom bathed in rain.</p><p>“Young master, young master, you’re finally back. We saw the traces of a battle at the Golden Eye’s cultivation place and thought you … Wuwu, it’s great that you’re back.”</p><p>Qiu Yue burst into tears and her eyes rolled down, wetting Lu Ming’s clothes.</p><p>“Silly girl, your young master is very lucky, how could something easily happen to him? Besides, I can’t bear to leave my Qiu Yue.”</p><p>Lu Ming stroked Qiu Yue’s hair and said softly.</p><p>Qiu Yue felt better and left Lu Ming’s arms. However, her eyes were red and tears were still welling up.</p><p>Xie nianqing gritted his teeth and remained silent.</p><p>Hmph, you’re so comfortable. You’re so sweet and soft the moment you come back.</p><p>Xie nianqing gritted his teeth.</p><p>little Qing, my arms are free now. Do you want to try? ”</p><p>Lu Ming blinked and smiled.</p><p>try your head! It’s good that you’re not dead!</p><p>Xie nianqing continued to snort.</p><p>haha, I still owe you one thing. How can I die before I finish it? ”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed.</p><p>“Hmph, it’s good that you remember!” Xie nianqing continued to sneer.</p><p>At this moment, Hua Ying and the other blood red Cavalry generals appeared one by one.</p><p>Then, it was Ming Meng, the three Ming siblings, and the others.</p><p>“Greetings, Lord Marquis!”</p><p>When they saw Lu Ming, they saluted him.</p><p>“No need to be so polite. Let’s go back to the camp.”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand.</p><p>On the way, Yan Quan saw the majestic and powerful blood red Cavalry, and his eyes flashed with a strange light. He was quite shocked.</p><p>However, Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>This was because he realized that the entire military camp was on high alert and the atmosphere was very heavy.</p><p>Could it be that another war had occurred recently?</p><p>“Huaying, how’s the situation recently? Could it be that another battle is about to take place? the atmosphere in the camp doesn’t feel right.”</p><p>Lu Ming asked as soon as they arrived at the camp.</p><p>“Lord Marquis, something big has happened!”</p><p>This was Huaying’s first sentence, and her face was extremely serious.</p><p>Lu Ming raised his eyebrows and swept his gaze across the room. He noticed that Ming Meng, Ming Cheng, and the rest all had grave expressions. Lu Ming had a bad feeling and asked,”Tell me, what happened?”</p><p>“Lord Marquis, the ghost moon saber sect has been destroyed!”</p><p>Huaying replied.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Even with Lu Ming’s mental fortitude, his body trembled violently at this moment, and his eyes revealed a look of disbelief.</p><p>The ghost moon saber sect was one of the five great sects of the blazing sun Empire. It dominated the North of the blazing sun Empire and was an Overlord. It was extremely powerful.</p><p>How could such a powerful force be destroyed just like that?</p><p>Even if the ten directions Sword School attacked with all their might, they might not be able to take down the ghost moon saber sect.</p><p>“What’s going on?” Lu Ming took a deep breath and calmed himself down.</p><p>master hou, ten days ago, the Dark Moon Empire dispatched two million troops to attack the ghost moon saber sect’s territory. The ghost moon saber sect sent out a large number of experts to resist, but they never expected that at this time, a large number of experts from the ten direction sword sect would suddenly attack the ghost moon saber sect. At the same time, a portion of the ghost moon saber sect’s people had long surrendered to the ten direction sword sect and attacked the ghost moon saber sect from the inside. Cooperating from the inside and from the outside, they broke through the ghost moon saber sect’s sect in one fell swoop, and a large number of ghost moon saber sect disciples were slaughtered!</p><p>after that, Shi Fang Jian sent out a large number of experts, and together with the experts of the Dark Moon Empire, they surrounded and killed the experts of the ghost moon saber sect. The ghost moon saber sect was caught off guard, and the experts were all killed and injured. The ghost moon saber sect was completely destroyed.</p><p>Huaying explained.</p><p>“So that’s how it is. I understand, I understand. This is a trap, a trap that was set up from the start.”</p><p>Lu Ming had a sudden realization.</p><p>It was obvious that the ten direction Sword School had been working with the Dark Moon Empire for a long time.</p><p>That was why the yin moon Empire’s Army had decided to attack. Their goal was to attract the powerhouses of the ghost moon saber sect and make preparations for their attack.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Dark Moon Empire suffered heavy losses due to Lu Ming’s sabotage last time and did not attract many powerhouses from the ghost moon saber sect.</p><p>Therefore, there were assassins who tried to kill Lu Ming. Moreover, there were people from the shadow Wolf Pavilion among them.</p><p>After thinking about it, everything was clear.</p><p>“Ten direction Sword School, you ten direction Sword School!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
