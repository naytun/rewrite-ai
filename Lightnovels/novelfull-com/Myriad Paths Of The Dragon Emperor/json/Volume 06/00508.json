When he reached Lv 2 martial King realm, he needed 50000 spiritual crystals.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop. He kept taking out top-grade spirit crystals.</p><p>Upgrade, upgrade, crazy upgrade.</p><p>In less than a day, Lu Ming had refined all 180000 pieces of spiritual crystals. His cultivation had also risen to the peak of the second level of the martial King realm.</p><p>If he wanted to break through to the third level of the martial King realm, he would need more resources.</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming left the Supreme shrine and looked to the West.</p><p>“Tianxuan sub-Palace, Sheng family, I, Lu Ming, am here!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>With a flash of light, Lu Ming turned into a ray of light and rushed toward Tianxuan sub-Palace.</p><p>Not long after, he passed by the place where he was ambushed by the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>At this moment, other than some blood on the ground, there was no other trace.</p><p>The corpses of the Ditian divine guards must have been taken away by the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>Lu Ming stopped for a moment, then turned into a ray of light and continued to Tianxuan sub-Palace.</p><p>Since Lu Ming was traveling alone, his speed was much faster. He took seven days to arrive at the half-month journey that he had previously scheduled.</p><p>In front of them, an ancient city appeared.</p><p>The city was black in color and there were marks left by swords, Spears, and sabers on it. It was filled with the aura of time, as if it had crossed time and space from ancient times.</p><p>The city was not large, and it was much smaller than the myriad Star City. However, the reputation of this city was much stronger than that of the myriad Star City.</p><p>This was because this city was called Tianxuan city. This Tianxuan city was the heavenly Emperor divine Palace’s branch Palace in the Tianxuan region.</p><p>It was said that Tianxuan city had existed for countless years. It had been preserved from the ancient era for over a million years.</p><p>This city had been built by human powerhouses in ancient times. The entire city was built on a super-large spirit eye and a Dao eye.</p><p>The spiritual eye could provide endless spiritual Qi.</p><p>Therefore, the spirit Qi in Tianxuan city was the densest in the Tianxuan region.</p><p>The Dao eye contained the Dao of heaven and earth.</p><p>It was said that anyone who cultivated in Tianxuan city would be able to comprehend force and intent much faster than anywhere else.</p><p>Having grown up in Tianxuan city, it could be said that he was blessed by the heavens.</p><p>Hence, there was not a single ordinary person in Tianxuan city. There were only people from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace.</p><p>If people outside the Empyrean heaven divine Palace wanted to enter, they would have to pay a huge price.</p><p>Within a thousand miles of Tianxuan city, there were eight huge satellite cities. They surrounded Tianxuan city like stars surrounding the moon, providing Tianxuan city with an endless stream of resources.</p><p>Lu Ming looked around for a while before he flew toward Tianxuan city.</p><p>When Lu Ming was within ten miles of Tianxuan city, he suddenly felt a strong pressure on his body.</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but land.</p><p>as expected, there’s an inscription formation in Tianxuan city that restricts one’s flight!</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>He was well aware of this. The entire Tianxuan city had been engraved with a powerful inscription formation by the experts of the ancient era. It was so strong that it was difficult for outsiders to break through. At the same time, there was also a flight prohibiting formation. Even a martial King would find it difficult to fly, let alone a martial Grandmaster.</p><p>Lu Ming had heard that one had to be at least a peak-tier King to fly in Tianxuan city.</p><p>Lu Ming walked toward Tianxuan city.</p><p>The gate of Tianxuan city opened, and people came in and out occasionally.</p><p>There was a group of soldiers standing guard at the gate. Each soldier exuded a powerful aura.</p><p>so strong! There are 15 of them, and five of them are lower tier King tiers. The other ten are all Lv 3 martial Kings!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat when he saw a group of soldiers at the city gate.</p><p>This was only a group of soldiers guarding the gate, yet they were already so terrifying. He really didn’t know how many powerhouses were entrenched in Tianxuan city.</p><p>There was no doubt that there were as many experts as there were clouds in the sky. Eight-tenths of the experts from the Empyrean Heavenly Divine Palace in the entire Tianxuan region were here.</p><p>Lu Ming strode toward the city gate.</p><p>“Stop, Who are you? Only disciples of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace can enter this place. If you are not a member of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, you better leave as soon as possible. If not, I will kill you without mercy!”</p><p>A soldier in iron armor stared at Lu Ming. His gaze was like two sharp swords, piercing Lu Ming.</p><p>“I am Lu Ming, a Ditian Divine Guard of the eastern Palace. This is my Divine Guard token.”</p><p>Lu Ming took out his Divine Guard token and handed it to the armored soldier.</p><p>“The Ditian divine guards from the eastern Palace?”</p><p>The armored soldier was a little confused. He took the token and scanned it with his mind. Then, his eyes calmed down.</p><p>“It’s really the Ditian divine guards from the eastern Palace, and it’s even the newest one. Could it be that you’ve been sent from the East as reinforcements? But why are you here alone?”</p><p>The armored soldier mumbled in confusion as he returned the token to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Can I enter the city now?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Since they’re Ditian divine guards, they’re naturally allowed to enter the city,”</p><p>The armored soldier said with a smile.</p><p>Lu Ming was about to enter the city when an inharmonious voice was heard.</p><p>“Little bastard, is that you? You’re not dead yet?”</p><p>A gloomy voice called out.</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned and looked at the city gate.</p><p>A few figures walked out from the city gate. One of them was staring at Lu Ming with a dark expression.</p><p>“Holy sky!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. He did not expect to encounter the Holy sky as soon as he arrived.</p><p>There were two other young men beside the Holy sky, but Lu Ming had never seen them before.</p><p>Sheng Kong, is he the guy in the East you were talking about? ”</p><p>A tall young man looked at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>“That’s right, it’s him!”</p><p>Killing intent flashed in Sheng Kong’s eyes. He looked at Lu Ming and said,”Lu Ming, I didn’t expect you to be so lucky.”</p><p>“Shengkong, what do you mean? Could it be that you knew I would be in danger?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered as he said.</p><p>Could it be that the Sheng family had really informed the heavenly corpse sect and betrayed them?</p><p>hehe, what’s so strange about that? we received news two days ago that the first batch of reinforcements sent by the eastern Palace was ambushed by the heavenly corpse sect on the way. They were completely annihilated, and none of them managed to escape. You are among the first batch of people, right? ”</p><p>Sheng Kong said with a cold smile.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“How dare you, Lu Ming! How dare you betray the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, collude with the heavenly corpse sect, and cause the death of dozens of empyrean heaven divine guards! You deserve to die! Today, I’ll cripple you as a warning to the others!”</p><p>Sheng Kong suddenly shouted.</p><p>“Sheng Kong, what nonsense are you talking about?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was calm as he said coldly.</p><p>“Nonsense? Lu Ming, how did the heavenly corpse sect know about your whereabouts? If someone hadn’t linked up with the heavenly corpse sect, how could this have happened? Furthermore, the first batch of King tiers had been completely annihilated, and there were even three lower tier King tiers among them. You’re not a traitor. Who else could you be?”</p><p>go! Sheng Kong shouted, looking righteous.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
