It actually involved the entire divine wilderness continent. It was really shocking. He wanted to ask more, but it was a pity that Fei Xue did not know much. She had only mentioned it by chance.</p><p>...</p><p>At this moment, in a magnificent palace in Hong city, Qin qingfei was discussing something with a few people.</p><p>“Second young master, are you really going to make a move on Lu Ming? However, in Hong city, you can’t make a move unless you’re in some special places. What if …”</p><p>A middle-aged man was worried.</p><p>“What are you afraid of? If anything happens, I’ll take responsibility. That kid has too much wealth. Besides the life potion, who knows how many more power Upanishad crystals he has? we can’t let him go!”</p><p>Qin qingfei’s eyes were filled with greed.</p><p>“Since that’s the case, whoever young master plans to send out must be done cleanly, and it’s best if no one can find out.”</p><p>The middle-aged man said.</p><p>let the three Phantom kills do it. All three of them are at the peak Lv 9 martial King realm, and they’re very good at coordinating assassinations. A peak King once died at their hands. The point is, no one knows that they’re our men. Even if they’re discovered, they won’t know that we did it.</p><p>Qin qingfei sneered.</p><p>good idea, second young master. I’ll do it now!</p><p>With that, the middle-aged man left in a hurry.</p><p>“Brat, no matter how many treasures you have, they will all be mine in the end!”</p><p>Qin qingfei murmured, a cold smile on his face.</p><p>In the restaurant.</p><p>The two of them ate and drank as they chatted.</p><p>It was already evening when the auction ended, but after three rounds of drinks, night had fallen.</p><p>thank you for your invitation today, brother Lu. I’ll take my leave now. I’ll bring brother Lu to the teleportation formation platform tomorrow!</p><p>Fei Xue stood up and left.</p><p>“I’ll be troubling you!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>After Fei Xue left, Lu Ming paid the bill and left as well. Lu Ming had an idea and did not return to his original Inn. Instead, he turned a few streets and went to another Inn to avoid being watched by people with ulterior motives.</p><p>Walking into the room, zhang xuan took out the elixir of life and opened the Jade bottle, upon which an intense life essence immediately gushed forth.</p><p>Life potion, this is life potion!</p><p>Lu Ming closed the bottle, a hint of excitement in his eyes.</p><p>“Father, your injuries can finally be healed!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>Lu Yuntian had been a genius martial artist back then.</p><p>As a martial artist himself, Lu Ming was well aware of the pain of not being able to cultivate. Lu Yuntian did not show it in front of them, but it did not mean that he did not yearn for martial arts and cultivation.</p><p>Lu Ming knew very well that Lu Yuntian yearned for it.</p><p>Lu Ming had been working hard for this.</p><p>Lu Ming then kept the elixir of life in the Supreme shrine.</p><p>At this moment, he felt a sense of danger.</p><p>“There’s danger!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At that moment, more than ten vines suddenly appeared in the room and wrapped around Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and the Spear’s gleam swept out. It shattered the vines and he rushed out of the room.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming had just rushed out of the room when a huge metal bottle came crashing down on him from above. A huge net shot out from the metal bottle and covered Lu Ming.</p><p>Below Lu Ming, the vines were winding around him like Vipers.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the night, three figures flickered and pounced on Lu Ming like ghosts.</p><p>Each of the three figures exuded a powerful aura of the peak Lv 9 martial King realm.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>break! Lu Ming bellowed. His aura burst out and he took a step with the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps. The heavens and earth rumbled and the vines below exploded.</p><p>At the same time, a ray of spear light, which contained the powerful cutting power of wind concept, rushed toward the large net, and the large net was shattered.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this time, the three figures made their move, striking out the strongest blow.</p><p>A wisp of sword Qi and a ray of saber radiance split into two and attacked Lu Ming’s two vital points at an astonishing speed.</p><p>However, what was more terrifying was that an arrow pierced through the night sky like a stream of light and headed straight for Lu Ming’s back. It was too fast.</p><p>The metal bottle above his head continued to press down.</p><p>This was a sure-kill situation. Even a peak-tier King would be killed if he was caught off guard.</p><p>Unfortunately, Lu Ming’s current combat strength had already far exceeded that of an ordinary peak-tier King.</p><p>“Ten thousand Dragon kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming thrust his spear forward and hundreds of three-colored true dragons flew in all directions.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Jade bottle was sent flying far away by the dozens of three-colored Dragons.</p><p>The two assassins on the left and right were attacked by dozens of true dragons. They coughed out blood and screamed twice before their bodies cracked and they died on the spot.</p><p>The arrow was the most powerful one. It destroyed dozens of three-colored true dragons, but it also disappeared.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Behind him, the expression of a figure holding a bow changed greatly, and he continued to escape into the distance.</p><p>“You tried to assassinate me, and you still want to leave?”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and cast the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps.</p><p>At this moment, the shockwaves of the battle had spread throughout the night. Countless figures appeared in the surroundings to watch.</p><p>how bold! Someone actually dares to make a move in Hong city!</p><p>“That is … That young man at the auction, as expected, someone has become greedy and wants to steal the treasure!”</p><p>looks like he’s kicked an iron plate. That young man’s battle-power is so strong. It’s too terrifying. He’s even stronger than a peak-tier King.</p><p>In the night, there were sounds of discussion. Someone recognized Lu Ming.</p><p>There were even people who were greedy for Lu Ming. At that moment, they were secretly glad that they did not make a move. Otherwise, they would only be dead.</p><p>The black shadow was extremely fast, but Lu Ming was faster. He caught up with it in a few steps.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>A ray of spear light flashed past. The figure’s angry roars were useless, and he was nailed to the ground.</p><p>In a flash, Lu Ming devoured the blood essence of the three people and kept their storage rings.</p><p>He then left the place.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming appeared two hundred miles away. He found a place with no one and entered the Supreme shrine.</p><p>No one would be able to find him in the Supreme shrine.</p><p>“I wonder who sent someone to assassinate me. Qin qingfei?”</p><p>The first person that came to Lu Ming’s mind was Qin qingfei.</p><p>He had already changed his residence temporarily, but he had been found in just a few minutes. It could be seen how powerful the person behind the scenes was.</p><p>Of course, he could not rule out other people.</p><p>There was a flash of killing intent in Lu Ming’s eyes. He then shook his head. He was leaving tomorrow anyway and he could not be bothered to add to the trouble.</p><p>Then, he closed his eyes and started cultivating.</p><p>Not long after, Qin qingfei’s angry roar could be heard from his main hall.</p><p>“What? After killing GUI yingsan, we lost track of that brat. Trash, all of them are trash!”</p><p>Qin qingfei roared.</p><p>second young master, that brat’s battle-power is far above our estimation. I’m afraid he’s not weaker than a peak-tier King. In fact, he might even be a bit stronger than ordinary peak-tier Kings!</p><p>The middle-aged man said with a frown.</p><p>Qin qingfei took a deep breath. His eyes were extremely cold.”Looks like I’ll have to ask big brother for help!”</p><p>“The second young master wants to invite the first young master?”</p><p>The middle-aged man was shocked.</p><p>“That’s right. That kid wants to use the inter-province transportation formation? Naive!”</p><p>Qin qingfei sneered and left his residence.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
