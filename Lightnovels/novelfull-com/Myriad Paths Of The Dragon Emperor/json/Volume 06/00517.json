If that’s the case, there might be a tribe of the scale demon race nearby!”</p><p>...</p><p>Mu Sen’s eyes lit up.</p><p>With a scaled Demon tribe, it meant that there was a pit of profound meaning crystals that could be dug out.</p><p>The eyes of the others also lit up.</p><p>For martial artists above the martial King realm, an intent crystal was an irresistible temptation. It could greatly increase the speed of cultivation.</p><p>“I wonder how big this tribe is and how strong it is?”</p><p>Mu Lin said.</p><p>This was something they had to consider. If it was a small tribe, they could consider it. If it was a larger tribe, they could only give up.</p><p>Putting everything else aside, if there was an existence equivalent to a lower tier King tier in this tribe, they would be dead for sure.</p><p>However, they were not willing to give up just like that.</p><p>how about this, it’s not easy to encounter a scaled Demon tribe in the vast mountains. Let’s first find this tribe and investigate their strength before making a decision.</p><p>Han man suggested.</p><p>“Alright, I have no objections!”</p><p>The others all nodded.</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ming would not object to it. He was also very eager to obtain ultimacy crystals.</p><p>Then, the five of them assigned their tasks and began to search the nearby area.</p><p>A few hours later, they made a discovery.</p><p>About 30,000 miles away from where they were, there was a tribe of the scaled demon race. The scaled demon race from before must have come from this tribe.</p><p>The group approached carefully and began to observe carefully on a mountain peak not far away.</p><p>There was a simple stone house in front of them, and within the stone house lived the scaled demon race.</p><p>High stone walls were built around the stone houses.</p><p>there are around a hundred stone houses, and the number of scaled demons should not exceed five hundred. This is a small tribe!</p><p>Han man said in a low voice.</p><p>normally speaking, a small scaled Demon tribe shouldn’t have too many experts. There shouldn’t be any King level existences. We should be able to deal with them!</p><p>Mu Sen said.</p><p>that’s right. When the time comes, we just need to kill some of the strongest scaled demon race members in the tribe. The other scaled demon race members won’t be a threat to us, and we can start digging the profound meaning crystal pit!</p><p>Han man nodded.</p><p>Lu Ming and Yao Xuan did not speak. It was their first time in the demonic scales dimension and they lacked experience. Naturally, they would not speak easily.</p><p>“Brother Lu, miss Yao, what do you think?”</p><p>Han man looked at Lu Ming and Yao Xuan.</p><p>I don’t have any objections. I’ll just follow your arrangements!</p><p>Yao Xuan whispered.</p><p>“I also have no objections!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Alright, then we’ll wait for the sky to turn dark and charge in!”</p><p>Han man said.</p><p>Then, everyone waited in silence.</p><p>Time flew by, and night soon came.</p><p>Within the tribe of the scaled demon race, everything fell into darkness.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Han man said.</p><p>“Wait a moment!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly spoke and his voice was extremely low!</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>Han man and the others were a little confused, but the next moment, their faces changed slightly.</p><p>Huhu ~</p><p>In the dark sky, five pitch-black coffins suddenly broke through the air and flew towards the tribe.</p><p>“The heavenly corpse sect!”</p><p>Yao Xuan exclaimed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. This was the first time he had met someone from the heavenly corpse sect since he entered the demonic scales dimension.</p><p>“It seems like the heavenly corpse sect has set their eyes on this tribe. What should we do?”</p><p>Mu Lin asked.</p><p>“Let’s just wait and see, and let the heavenly corpse sect test the strength of this tribe!”</p><p>Han man said.</p><p>Han man looked simple and honest, but he was actually very smart and had a strong cultivation. He was the leader of both Mu Lin and mu Sen.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the five coffins flew into the tribe.</p><p>???!</p><p>At this time, the scaled demon race in the tribe had also discovered the people of the heavenly corpse sect and let out loud roars.</p><p>Then, from each of the stone houses, a tall figure rushed out. Each of them was covered in black scales. Holding battle axes, iron staffs, and other weapons, they rushed toward the people of the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>Kachachi</p><p>The five coffins opened, and two refined corpses flew out of each coffin.</p><p>Swish Swish Swish</p><p>The iron chains flew across the sky and stabbed toward the scaled demon race. Instantly, some of the weaker scaled demon race members were killed.</p><p>???!</p><p>The scaled demon at the forefront was the tallest of them all. He was close to three meters tall and had the strongest aura. He had reached the peak of Lv 3 martial King realm.</p><p>It was obvious that this scaled demon was the leader of this tribe. After he shouted a few times, some of the scaled demons below the martial King realm retreated.</p><p>Only the members of the scale demon race who were at the martial King realm and above continued to attack the people of the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>two peak Lv 3 martial King realm refined corpses, and five at the middle and early stages of Lv 3 martial King realm!</p><p>Han man muttered, his voice filled with fear.</p><p>The power of the heavenly corpse sect had completely surpassed them and the scaled demon race.</p><p>&Nbsp; although the scale demon race had the advantage in numbers, after the war broke out, they were still in a one-sided situation.</p><p>One by one, the scaled demon race was killed.</p><p>In the scaled demon race, there were two other people who had reached the LV 3 martial King realm. The gap between them and the heavenly corpse sect was too great.</p><p>The difference in high-end combat strength was too great.</p><p>ah! the scaled demon race below the martial King realm let out a series of shrill screams.</p><p>In the end, regardless of the difference in power, they all rushed toward the refined corpse of the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>“A bunch of uncivilized animals, you still want to resist, you’re really looking for death!”</p><p>A cold voice came from one of the coffins. Then, a pale-faced young man walked out.</p><p>hehe, but these animals have pretty good bodies. It’s not bad to use them to refine into refined corpses!</p><p>A pale-faced young man walked out of the other coffin.</p><p>The corpse guards of the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>Five young corpse guards walked out of the five coffins one after another.</p><p>“Hehe, die, you animals!”</p><p>The five corpse guards sneered and then pounced toward the scaled demon Warriors below the king realm.</p><p>Corpse Qi surged as he waved his claws. One by one, the scaled demons were killed.</p><p>Wahhhhh!</p><p>&Nbsp; the leader of the scale demon race shouted and seemed to be extremely angry.</p><p>&Nbsp; when the scaled demon race below the king level heard the leader, they also cried out and turned around, running out of the tribe.</p><p>“You want to escape? die!”</p><p>The five corpse guards waved their claws and killed the scaled demons one by one.</p><p>At the same time, he controlled the refined corpse to kill the experts of the scaled demon race.</p><p>The leader of the scaled demon race was finally defeated by the two refined corpses. His scales were pierced and torn apart before he was killed.</p><p>A moment later, all the higher-ups of the scaled demon race were killed. As for those of the scaled demon race below the king level, other than a few who managed to escape, the rest of the scaled demon race were all dead, leaving behind a ground of corpses.</p><p>hehe, this trip was worth it. Not only can I get some decent corpses, but I can also get intent crystals!</p><p>A corpse guard sneered and walked towards the depths of the tribe.</p><p>“What do we do?”</p><p>On the mountain peak, Mu Lin was a little anxious.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
