It was simply an exorbitant price.</p><p>Clang clang clang!</p><p>At this moment, a clattering sound came from a pile of scrap metal. From the pile of scrap metal, an old man with messy hair crawled out.</p><p>The old man’s hair and beard were in a mess. It was unknown how long it had been since he last washed them, and they were covered in dirt.</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. The old man had been sleeping in the pile of scrap metal.</p><p>Was this the level six master of inscription?</p><p>“Little girl, don’t compare those scrap metals with the spiritual weapons that I’ve personally forged. Moreover, the sixth level spiritual weapons that you said were worth hundreds of thousands of Supreme spiritual crystals are all of the lower or middle grade. What’s the use of them? the ones that I’ve forged are definitely at the peak of the sixth level spiritual weapons, do you understand?”</p><p>As soon as the old man appeared, he ran to Mu Lan and shouted.</p><p>uncle Huang, five million Supreme spiritual crystals is too expensive!</p><p>Mu Lan said.</p><p>Not to mention them, even ordinary peak-tier Kings might not be able to take out five million Supreme-tier spirit crystals.</p><p>Even powerful beings of the spiritual ocean tier would feel pain.</p><p>if you don’t have spiritual crystals, then forget it. I don’t make a losing deal.</p><p>The old man waved his hand.</p><p>“As long as the quality of the spirit weapon is acceptable, spirit crystals aren’t a problem!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming spoke.</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>Mu Lan looked at Lu Ming in astonishment. Could it be that Lu Ming could even take out five million best-grade spirit crystals?</p><p>The old man also looked at Lu Ming in surprise.</p><p>“It’ll be easy if you have spirit crystals. Tell me, what do you want from the spirit weapon spear?”</p><p>The old man asked.</p><p>Every martial artist had different requirements for their spirit weapon according to the martial skill they cultivated.</p><p>Some people liked nimble things, while others liked heavy things …</p><p>hardness. First of all, whether it’s the spear body or the spear tip, it must be absolutely tough and able to withstand an intense explosion!</p><p>also, while the spear shaft is hard, it must also be flexible and flexible. The heavier it is, the better!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment and replied.</p><p>“Little fellow, you have quite a lot of requests!”</p><p>The old man grinned, then fell into deep thought.</p><p>After a long while, the old man said, ” there aren’t many people who use Spears. I don’t have many materials suitable for making Spears either. En, I do have a piece of indestructible steel that is suitable for making the spear tip. But the spear body? ” I do have some common materials, but I don’t have anything that can meet your requirements.”</p><p>The old man frowned and muttered.</p><p>little guy, think about it. Since you use a spear, you should have collected some materials. Think about it, do you have any materials suitable for making a spear? if you have them, I’ll take fewer spirit crystals.</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>“Me?”</p><p>Lu Ming was also racking his brains but he did not have any suitable candidates.</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He moved his hand and a broken spear appeared.</p><p>This broken spear was only half of its original size. The other half of the Spear’s tail was missing. It was the broken spear that had spurted out of the Heaven’s Gate.</p><p>This broken spear did not have any spirituality at all. However, its material was indeed very hard. Lu Ming did not know what material it was made of. Perhaps it could be of use.</p><p>“Senior, take a look at this broken spear …”</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Before Lu Ming could finish his sentence, a figure flashed. The broken spear in his hand had disappeared and appeared in the hands of the old man.</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked. This elder’s cultivation was unfathomable. He did not even see how the elder had attacked.</p><p>The old man’s eyes were now fixed on the broken spear. His originally cloudy eyes were now as bright as two light bulbs, extremely hot.</p><p>The old man’s hands gently caressed the spear handle. As his palms streaked across, strange runes appeared on the spear handle.</p><p>this is a refining technique from the ancient times. There are inscriptions from the ancient times in it. It’s a priceless treasure, a priceless treasure. Hahaha!</p><p>The old man suddenly laughed wildly.</p><p>Lu Ming and Mu Lan looked at each other. It was just a broken spear. What value did it have? Why did the old man say it was a priceless treasure?</p><p>“Little guy, where did you get this broken spear?”</p><p>The old man asked.</p><p>“I obtained it by chance in an ancient battlefield.”</p><p>Lu Ming told a lie.</p><p>hmm, this broken spear has a long history. Although it has lost its spirituality and only half of it is left, it is a priceless treasure in my hands!</p><p>The old man laughed.</p><p>The old man explained when he saw Lu Ming and Mu Lan’s puzzled expressions.</p><p>the inscriptions on this spear are long-lost ancient inscriptions. They will be of great use to me. After I study them, I might be able to improve my weapon-refining skills. Just this point alone makes it a priceless treasure!</p><p>“Little guy, give this spear to this old man. This old man will use all my strength to help you refine a spear for free. How about it?”</p><p>The old man looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming agreed readily.</p><p>Anyway, the long spear was of no use to him. If he gave it to the elder, he could save five million best-grade spirit crystals. Lu Ming was more than willing to give it away.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming had agreed, the old man was very happy. He smiled and said, ” “Little guy, I won’t let you suffer any losses. This half of the long spear contains a rare and strange metal called the infinite black Gold. If you use this metal to forge a spirit weapon, it will give it endless potential. In the future, as long as you continue to condense and melt other metals into it, this spirit weapon will be able to continuously evolve and upgrade!”</p><p>“What? It can continuously evolve and upgrade?”</p><p>Lu Ming and Mu Lan were dumbfounded and shocked.</p><p>To think that there was such a magical metal.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were shining and burning.</p><p>“That’s right. In ancient times, there was a lot of Infinite Black Gold, but now, the amount is getting smaller and smaller. It’s a great fortune for you to be able to obtain some. After this old man studies the inscriptions on it, I’ll melt this Infinite Black Gold into your spirit weapon spear.”</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming bowed and cupped his fists.</p><p>hahaha, no need for thanks. I should be the one thanking you. However, with such good materials, the other materials can’t be bad, or it would be a waste. Now, the key is the material for the spear body.</p><p>The old man frowned.</p><p>After a while, the old man’s eyes brightened.”I’ve got it. Thousand refined blood gold is the most suitable for the spear handle.”</p><p>“Thousand-refined blood gold?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>“That’s right. The thousand-refined blood gold is made from an extremely precious metal that has been refined thousands of times. Each time, it needs to be mixed with the blood essence of a demon beast. Only after a thousand times can it be forged. However, I don’t have the thousand-refined blood gold with me, so I’ll need you to make a trip here.”</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>“I wonder where I can obtain this thousand refined blood gold?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
