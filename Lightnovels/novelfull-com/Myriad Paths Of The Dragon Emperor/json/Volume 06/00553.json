Let the young people solve their own problems. We should not interfere.”</p><p>...</p><p>Xuan Yuan said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly spoke and looked at Xuan Zhong,”Since you want to fight, I’ll accompany you!”</p><p>alright, I’ve been waiting for you to say that. Let’s Have a Battle outside!</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming had accepted the challenge, a cold glint flashed in Xuan Zhong’s eyes. He strode outside.</p><p>Lu Ming followed closely behind.</p><p>Xuan long sighed and walked out of the hall with the other elders.</p><p>“This Xuan Zhong, Humph, he’s really detestable!”</p><p>Xuan Xiang coldly snorted.</p><p>Outside the main hall was a wide square, just right for a battle.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xuan Zhong stood opposite each other.</p><p>“Brother Xuan, you and I will stop here, how about it?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>After all, he was the one who had come to the weapon forging sect to ask for the thousand refined blood gold. Therefore, Lu Ming still felt a little embarrassed.</p><p>“Stop? Hehe, on the battlefield, weapons have no eyes. If you’re afraid, then quickly admit defeat.”</p><p>Xuan Zhong’s aura was overbearing.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned again.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At this moment, Xuan Zhong’s aura exploded. At the same time, runes appeared on his palm. With a wave of his hand, five spirit weapons appeared.</p><p>These five spirit weapons were all different.</p><p>There were two swords, a saber, a spear, and a dagger.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Xuan Zhong hollered and pounced towards Lu Ming. At the same time, the five spirit weapons also rushed towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The five spirit weapons flew in different directions and headed for Lu Ming’s five vital points.</p><p>His attacks were sharp and vicious. It didn’t seem like a sparring session, but more like a battle on the battlefield.</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows. With a flash of his body, he dodged a few spirit weapons and appeared in another direction.</p><p>“You want to hide? In your dreams, die!”</p><p>Xuan Zhong’s eyes were filled with vicious killing intent. He waved his hands and the five spirit weapons continued to attack Lu Ming at lightning speed.</p><p>The weapon forging sect’s method of controlling weapons was truly amazing.</p><p>Lu Ming cast his movement technique and wanted to avoid it.</p><p>At this moment, Xuan Zhong’s face revealed a trace of ruthlessness as he shook his sleeves.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>More than ten sharp air-piercing sounds were heard. More than ten sharp steel needles flew out from Xuan Zhong’s sleeves and pierced toward Lu Ming’s eyes at an extreme speed.</p><p>“Xuan Zhong, you’re despicable!”</p><p>Xuan Xiang shouted.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Xuan long also roared, but it was too late to save him.</p><p>At this moment, Xuan long was filled with regret. If he had known this would happen, he would have given Lu Ming the thousand refined blood gold and asked him to return to the Empyrean heaven divine Palace.</p><p>If Lu Ming were to die in Xuan Zhong’s hands, he really did not know how to explain it to elder Huang.</p><p>“You’re pushing it!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s cold voice was heard.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Then, a terrifying aura burst out from Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>A huge Spear’s gleam shot up from Lu Ming’s body, stirring up the wind and clouds.</p><p>The dozen or so steel needles exploded into powder the moment they touched the spear radiance.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming waved one hand and a huge spear ray swept toward Xuan Zhong.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The five spirit weapons were hit by the spear light and flew thousands of meters away. The huge spear light continued to attack Xuan Zhong.</p><p>“This … This …”</p><p>Xuan Zhong was completely stunned. In front of Lu Ming’s terrifying aura, he was like a pitiful worm.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>The first elder, Xuan Yuan, roared.</p><p>However, would Lu Ming give a damn about him?</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The spear light hit Xuan Zhong’s body directly and sent him flying. He glided for a thousand meters on the square and spurted out blood.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming had deliberately shown mercy and only used 10% of his strength. Otherwise, Xuan Zhong would have been blasted into smithereens.</p><p>“Zhong ‘er!”</p><p>Xuan Yuan hurriedly rushed over to check on Xuan Zhong’s injuries.</p><p>what powerful combat strength! He’s only at the early stage of the LV 4 martial King realm, but his combat strength should be equivalent to the late stage of the LV 5 martial King realm, or even the peak of the LV 5 martial King realm.</p><p>not bad. He’s so young, yet he has such a cultivation and combat strength. As expected of a genius among the Empyrean sky divine guards. Xuan Zhong’s defeat was not unjustified.</p><p>The elders of the weapon forging sect discussed animatedly as they marveled at the sight.</p><p>Xuan Zhong was also at the early stage of the LV 4 martial King realm, but he could not even withstand a single blow from Lu Ming.</p><p>If they knew that Lu Ming had only used 10% of his strength, he wondered what kind of expressions they would have.</p><p>Hmph, I told you that Lord Lu Ming is a peerless genius. Xuan Zhong just wouldn’t listen. He’s getting beaten up now.</p><p>Xuan Xiang snorted coldly and walked over to look at Xuan Zhong with a stern face.</p><p>Xuan Zhong’s injuries were not serious. He stood up and looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>However, a cold killing intent still flashed in the depths of his eyes, but he concealed it.</p><p>alright, since little brother Lu has won, that piece of thousand-refined blood gold belongs to little brother Lu.</p><p>Xuan long announced. He then looked at Lu Ming and smiled. little brother Lu, the thousand-refined blood gold is still being nurtured in the demonic beast blood pool. You’ll have to wait until tomorrow to take it out. Why don’t you stay in the weapon forging sect for a night and I’ll give you the thousand-refined blood gold tomorrow? ”</p><p>“It’s fine. Thank you, sect master Xuan!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists.</p><p>Then, Xuan long got someone to arrange a room for Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lord Lu Ming, I’ll show you around. There are some fun places in the weapon forging sect.”</p><p>Xuan Xiang laughed.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and nodded.</p><p>The weapon forging sect was indeed a major weapon forging sect. There were places and secret rooms for weapon forging everywhere.</p><p>Lu Ming followed Xuan Xiang and wandered around with great interest.</p><p>As for Xuan Xiang, she was also very curious and kept asking questions.</p><p>Since she was young, Xuan Xiang had always been active within tens of thousands of miles of the weapon forging sect. She had never gone far and was very curious about the outside world.</p><p>Lu Ming had a good impression of Xuan Xiang. Although Xuan Xiang was a few years older than Lu Ming, she was like a Naughty Little Sister in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming would briefly explain what he could say.</p><p>It was not until evening that Lu Ming parted with Xuan Xiang and returned to his residence.</p><p>After that, he entered the Supreme shrine and placed the path-understanding ancient tree by his side. Lu Ming continued to comprehend the creation of wind.</p><p>……</p><p>In the drawing room of the first elder of the weapon forging sect, three figures were seated.</p><p>One of them was the great elder Xuan Yuan, and the other was Xuan Zhong.</p><p>The last one was a burly man in his thirties.</p><p>father, I’ll definitely take my revenge. I’ll definitely kill that little b * stard Lu Ming!</p><p>Xuan Zhong roared, his eyes filled with hatred.</p><p>“Don’t worry, that little bastard. I don’t care if he’s old Huang’s man or not, he must die.”</p><p>Xuan Yuan’s eyes were also cold.</p><p>“Father, when are we going to execute that plan?”</p><p>Xuan Zhong asked.</p><p>“You’ve finally thought it through? Are we going to execute that plan?”</p><p>Xuan Yuan said.</p><p>Hmph, I couldn’t bear to part with that b * tch Xuan Xiang in the past. But now, that b * tch has only seen that little b * stard Lu Ming for a short time and she’s already flirting with him all day long. Damn it, all of you deserve to die!</p><p>Xuan Zhong shouted coldly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
