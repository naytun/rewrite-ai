I still want her blood as a guide. How can we let her go? capture that girl for me. Be careful, don’t kill her. ”</p><p>...</p><p>The old corpse guard waved his hand, and a few corpse guards instantly controlled the refined corpses to charge at xuanxiang.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Xuan Xiang shouted in anger and controlled a few spirit weapons to charge at the corpse guards.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming threw Xuan Zhong onto the square of the weapon forging sect. He dashed towards a few corpse guards and refined corpses and swept his long spear across, causing a few corpse guards to explode.</p><p>“Kill that brat!”</p><p>The old corpse guard shouted coldly, and more corpse guards charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>There were at least ten corpse guards with more than twenty refined corpses.</p><p>The iron chains covered the sky and wrapped around Lu Ming and Xuan Xiang.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming pulled Xuan Xiang and retreated rapidly, avoiding the entanglement of the iron chain.</p><p>At this moment, there were battles everywhere.</p><p>There were battles between weapon forging sect disciples and the sky corpse sect’s corpse guards, as well as internal conflicts within weapon forging sect itself.</p><p>“Damn traitor!”</p><p>Lu Ming saw an angry weapon forging sect disciple chopping off Xuan Zhong’s head in the square below.</p><p>In the end, Xuan Zhong still died at the hands of a weapon forging sect disciple.</p><p>All of this was seen by Xuan Xiang. She bit her red lips, her eyes red, and didn’t say a word.</p><p>“Catch that little girl!”</p><p>In the surroundings, a group of corpse guards controlled the refined corpses and rushed toward Lu Ming and Xuan Xiang.</p><p>“Why do they want to capture profound fragrance? Just now, Grandmaster Xuan had called out the ancient barren city? Could it be the desolate ancient city in the East of Tianxuan?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A battle sword pierced through the air and cut off the heads of five to six corpse guards.</p><p>It was Xuan long. He controlled the combat sword to help Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>“Lu Ming, take Xiangxiang and go to Tianxuan city quickly. I’m counting on you!”</p><p>Xuan long shouted.</p><p>In the weapon forging sect, only Xuan long and Xuan Yuan were King tiers at the upper tier.</p><p>The other elders were all lower tier King tiers. None of them had Lu Ming’s combat strength. Xuan long could only rely on Lu Ming now.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming agreed. He pulled Xuan Xiang and retreated rapidly.</p><p>“Don’t even think about leaving?”</p><p>A cold voice suddenly came from behind.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh …</p><p>The sound of iron chains breaking through the air was heard as they wrapped around Lu Ming and Xuan Xiang.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and the Spear’s radiance, which was a thousand meters long, swept out.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s expression changed drastically at the next moment.</p><p>The spear ray was pierced by the iron chain, which continued to wrap around them.</p><p>“A late stage King tier!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>It was definitely a refined corpse at the level of a King.</p><p>“With me here, you still want to leave? how is that possible? Hehe!”</p><p>Behind him, a middle-aged corpse guard controlled two refined corpses. They exuded a terrifying aura and closed in on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lord Lu Ming, leave quickly. Don’t worry about me!”</p><p>Xuan Xiang shouted.</p><p>“Let’s go together!”</p><p>Lu Ming pulled Xuan Xiang and rushed in another direction.</p><p>However, the iron chains hung in the air, sealing off all escape routes.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming exchanged a few blows with him. His body trembled and blood seeped out of his mouth.</p><p>With his current battle-power, he was still a distance away from a late-stage King.</p><p>There was a dividing line between Lv 3 and Lv 4 martial King realm, and there was also a dividing line between Lv 6 and Lv 7 martial King realm.</p><p>The seventh level of the martial King realm was considered as a King tier of the upper tier, and its combat strength was two levels higher than that of the sixth level.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The iron chain flew across the sky and kept attacking Lu Ming.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>At this time, two combat swords flew over and hit the iron chain away. It was Xuan long who controlled the combat swords to help.</p><p>Xuan long, you dare to be distracted while fighting with me? you’re looking for death!</p><p>Xuan Yuan shouted coldly. His combat weapon flew and attacked. Xuan long was distracted and was hit by Xuan Yuan’s spear. A bloody hole appeared on his shoulder. If Xuan long didn’t Dodge in time, his heart would have been pierced.</p><p>“Father!”</p><p>Xuan Xiang was shocked and extremely worried.</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>At this moment, the sound of something breaking through the air could be heard. The middle-aged corpse guard appeared behind Lu Ming and grabbed at him.</p><p>Lu Ming hurriedly turned around and thrust his spear.</p><p>This middle-aged corpse guard was also a King tier at the seventh level of the martial King realm. Although the corpse Guard’s combat strength was not strong, it was still above Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>With one move, Lu Ming’s body was sent flying backward.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but let go of Xuan Xiang’s hand.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Immediately, a few iron chains rolled up the profound incense and pulled it into the distance.</p><p>“Hehehe, I’ve got the girl, but I’m still short of the recondite steel heavy sword.”</p><p>The old corpse guard sneered.</p><p>He was also a late-stage King, and he was controlling a refined corpse to kill an elder of the weapon forging sect.</p><p>One by one, the elders died under his refined corpse.</p><p>“Fragrance!”</p><p>Xuan long let out a roar and controlled the three combat swords to slash at the chain that was holding Xuan Xiang.</p><p>However, the refined corpse that had caught Xuan Xiang was already at the level of a late stage King. How could Xuan long save it?</p><p>The iron chain flew out and knocked away the three combat swords.</p><p>“You still dare to be distracted, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>Xuan Yuan revealed a cold smile.</p><p>When Xuan long was distracted, Xuan Yuan seized the opportunity and attacked him fiercely.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>This time, Xuan Long’s arm was cut off by Xuan Yuan.</p><p>The mysterious Dragon roared like a wild lion.</p><p>“Haha, the storage ring is mine!”</p><p>Xuan Yuan was overjoyed, and Xuan long threw the arm to the old corpse guard.</p><p>“Father, father!”</p><p>In the distance, Xuan Xiang anxiously shouted.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s spear sent a few refined corpses of lower tier King level flying and he charged towards Xuan long.</p><p>“Brat, if you want to save people, die!”</p><p>The middle-aged corpse guard controlled a refined corpse to block Lu Ming’s way.</p><p>“Damn you, dan dan, smash!”</p><p>Lu Ming patted dandan.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Dandan flew out, rapidly growing in size, and smashed towards the middle-aged corpse Guard’s face.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The middle-aged corpse guard couldn’t avoid it at all and was directly smashed in the face.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>He screamed in pain. His face was almost smashed. He retreated frantically and controlled the refined corpse to block in front of him.</p><p>“Such a meticulous mind.”</p><p>Lu Ming felt that it was a pity.</p><p>Originally, he wanted to use dan Dan’s sneak attack To Kill a King level corpse guard, but this corpse guard immediately controlled the refined corpse to block in front of him, so he didn’t have a chance.</p><p>Lu Ming dashed past and charged at Xuan long.</p><p>At this moment, xuanxiang was surrounded by a pile of refined corpses. She wanted to save him, but she had no chance.</p><p>At this moment, Xuan long was in a critical situation. One of his arms had been cut off. He was no match for Xuan Yuan and was at a disadvantage.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s momentum was like a rainbow. He was practically invincible under the level of a King tier. No corpse guard or refined corpse could stop him.</p><p>“This kid is looking for death.”</p><p>The old corpse Guard’s eyes were cold. He controlled a refined corpse at the level of a King and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, he rushed toward Xuan long.</p><p>“Not good! A Gokudo path attack!”</p><p>Lu Ming became one with his spear and turned into a ray of spear light. The refined corpse and corpse guards in front of him were all sent flying. Lu Ming’s figure flashed and appeared not far from the Xuan long.</p><p>But at this time, the old corpse guard and Xuan Yuan had already surrounded and attacked Xuan long.</p><p>Xuan long was already no match for him. Now that he was besieged, he was hit again and was covered in blood.</p><p>“Dandan, smash!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The old corpse Guard’s claw clawed towards the profound dragon’s heart.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
