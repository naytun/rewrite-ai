They looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>...</p><p>Where did this guy come from? How audacious! Not only did he seriously injure Shengfeng and take his storage ring, but he also asked shengkong and the other two to pay 50000 spiritual crystals each?</p><p>This was a blatant robbery.</p><p>The crowd was already in a mess. The two people from sacred sky were even more dumbfounded. They stared at Lu Ming in disbelief.</p><p>“What did you just say? What did you just say?”</p><p>The other young man from the Sheng family thought he had heard wrong.</p><p>There was actually someone who dared to treat them this way in Tianxuan city? Even the MU family’s hero didn’t dare to.</p><p>I don’t want to repeat myself. Give me 50000 spiritual crystals in three breaths. One!</p><p>Lu Ming started to count directly.</p><p>f * ck you, don’t go too far! This is Tianxuan city, not the eastern Palace. You’re courting death!</p><p>no! Sheng Kong shouted crazily.</p><p>“Two!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop and started to count to two.</p><p>“Detestable! Damn it, you guys, hurry up and take down this kid!”</p><p>Sheng Kong shouted at the armored soldiers.</p><p>However, the armored soldiers were unmoved.</p><p>They were under the jurisdiction of the Tianxuan sub-Palace and were only responsible for guarding the city gates. As for the personal grudges of the other empyrean heaven divine guards, they would not interfere.</p><p>“Three!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s cold voice was heard.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>Sheng Kong and the other young man from the Sheng family retreated as fast as lightning.</p><p>They were fast but Lu Ming was faster.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The long spear in Lu Ming’s hands was pulled out.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The Spear’s shaft directly smacked the faces of the two.</p><p>The two of them screamed and flew far away.</p><p>now, it’s not a problem of 50000 spiritual crystals!</p><p>Lu Ming strode toward the two of them.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you deserve to die. You deserve to die!”</p><p>ah! Sheng Kong screamed hysterically. He felt as if half of his face did not belong to him.</p><p>How dare you! Who dares to hit my Sheng family? you’re courting death!</p><p>At this moment, a loud shout was heard from the city gate. Then, a figure dashed out like a gust of wind.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Before he could reach Lu Ming, a water sword formed by water currents was aimed at the area between Lu Ming’s eyebrows.</p><p>The sword of flowing water contained a powerful water concept.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. He felt a strong sense of threat from this sword.</p><p>In an instant, the true energy in his body burst out madly. His will gathered and he thrust the spear forward.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A crisp sound was heard. Lu Ming realized that the sword of flowing water was harder than an ordinary fourth-level spiritual weapon. At the same time, a vast energy burst out. Lu Ming’s body shook and he could not help but retreat.</p><p>At that moment, a figure appeared beside the two of them.</p><p>This was a young man in a blue robe. He looked to be around 25 or 26 years old and was very handsome. However, there was a hint of cold arrogance between his brows.</p><p>“Sacred river, it’s the sacred river!”</p><p>As soon as this young man appeared, a series of exclamations came from the side.</p><p>I didn’t expect the sacred river to be so close. That brat’s days are over. The sacred river has already become a lower tier King tier a year ago!</p><p>but then again, this brat is really bold. He even dared to beat up the hero of the Sheng family. I heard that he’s from the East, but he probably hasn’t heard of the Sheng family’s reputation!</p><p>Some people shook their heads and felt that Lu Ming was in grave danger.</p><p>brother Jiang, brother Jiang, you’ve come at the right time. This brat dared to hit us and insult our Sheng family. He’s unforgivable. Brother Jiang, you must cripple him for me!</p><p>When Sheng Kong saw the sacred river, he was overjoyed and shouted excitedly.</p><p>But what responded to him was a kick from Shengjiang.</p><p>Shengjiang’s kick landed on Sheng Kong’s face, stunning him.</p><p>you’re just a piece of trash. You’ve been beaten so badly by a kid from the East. You’ve really embarrassed the Sheng family!</p><p>Shengjiang cast a cold glance at Sheng Kong, then turned to Lu Ming. however, no matter how useless a member of the Sheng family is, he’s not someone an outsider can beat. Kid, since you’ve made a move, you’ll have to bear the consequences!</p><p>His eyes were contemptuous and he had a haughty expression.</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips and sneered,’Oh? So, you’re saying that I can’t fight back when they attack me? Is there such a logic in the world?”</p><p>“Of course you can fight back, but if you do, you’ll have to pay a corresponding or even more heavy price. Do you still need me to do it myself?”</p><p>Shengjiang said indifferently.</p><p>“Nonsense, if you want to attack, then attack!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly.</p><p>Shengjiang’s face darkened, and he said coldly, ” stubborn! Don’t think that you can fight me just because you can block one of my attacks! How naive! Now, I’ll show you the difference between a lower tier King tier and a lower tier King tier!</p><p>As he spoke, a powerful aura burst out of Shengjiang’s body.</p><p>The aura of the peak Lv 4 martial King realm, and the initial success of the first level water concept.</p><p>Then, holy river waved his hand, and a large amount of water suddenly condensed in the sky.</p><p>The streams of water were all transformed into water blades.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>With a wave of sacred river’s hand, at least a hundred swords of water shot towards Lu Ming.</p><p>The sword of flowing water pierced through the void, bringing with it a shocking Sonic Boom.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were solemn. He clenched his fist in the air. Between heaven and earth, endless power of lightning gathered and formed lightning Spears.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and the spear of lightning flew out, clashing with the swords of water.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>In the sky, there were more than 100 continuous thunderous sounds.</p><p>This was the collision of intent realms!</p><p>In the end, the Sword of Water and the spear of lightning disappeared together.</p><p>The people watching the battle widened their eyes in shock.</p><p>How was it possible that Lu Ming could block the attack of Sheng Jiang?</p><p>intent realm. This Lu Ming’s Thunder intent realm has already reached level one lower tier. The strength of his intent realm is not any weaker than a lower tier King’s intent realm!</p><p>impressive, impressive. This way, he will not face any bottlenecks before he breaks through to the lower tier. I think he will reach the lower tier in less than two years!</p><p>Once one’s intent realm was reached, one only needed to accumulate energy to break through. However, for an ordinary person, even if they kept refining Supreme-grade spirit crystals, it would take one or two years.</p><p>This was already very fast.</p><p>kid, it turns out that your Thunder mentality has already broken through to the first level lower class. No wonder you’re so arrogant. However, combat strength depends on a combination of various factors to form a powerful combat strength. You and I are still far from that!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Shengjiang stepped forward. The true essence on his body was boiling like a real substance, dancing like blue flames.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>A middle Lv 5 spiritual weapon sword appeared in Shengjiang’s hand. His boundless true essence and water will merged as he slashed out.</p><p>A crystal-clear blue sword gleam that was a hundred meters long slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“True dragon Strike!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and burst out with all his strength as he stabbed with his spear.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
