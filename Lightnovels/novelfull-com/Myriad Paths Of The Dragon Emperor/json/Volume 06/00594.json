I’ve been trying to send you messages, but I couldn’t get them out. I thought something had happened to you.</p><p>Fei Xue asked worriedly when she saw Lu Ming.</p><p>It seemed that feixue had received the news last night.</p><p>“They’re just a few clowns, it’s no big deal!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>He had been in the Supreme shrine for the rest of his life, so his Jade voice transmission talisman naturally could not transmit any messages.</p><p>Fei Xue’s beautiful eyes glowed.</p><p>She had received news that the assassin was not a clown, but someone with extremely powerful cultivation. Later, based on the corpse, she had determined that it was the famous triple Phantom kills.</p><p>To be able to escape the assassination of the three Phantom kills and even kill it, one could imagine the combat strength of the person.</p><p>Fei Xue was even more curious. Was Lu Ming really from the Tianxuan region?</p><p>As far as she knew, only the Saint planet on the list of top 1000 talents in the Tianxuan region could have such battle strength.</p><p>Lady flying snow, let’s go to the inter-domain teleportation array!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Fei Xue nodded and brought Lu Ming to the inter-province transportation formation.</p><p>After passing through twelve checkpoints, they arrived at a huge square.</p><p>From afar, there was a huge altar-like building in the center of the square. It was the inter-province transportation formation.</p><p>There were rows of soldiers in metal armor standing guard around the altar.</p><p>Of course, these soldiers were not ordinary soldiers. Each one of them exuded a powerful aura. Most of them were at the peak Lv 6 martial King realm, and some of them were even King tiers in the upper tier.</p><p>“This is an important place, what are you doing here?”</p><p>With a cold shout, a middle-aged man appeared in front of the two.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. This middle-aged man was Qin qingfei’s eighth uncle, the one who had appeared last time.</p><p>“I’m here to take the inter-province transportation formation!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>you’re still here. Didn’t I tell you last time that there are no more spots? hurry up and leave!</p><p>The middle-aged man said as he waved his hand.</p><p>“I have my own quota!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out the spiritual zone teleportation token.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The middle-aged man’s eyes darkened when he saw the territory crossing token in Lu Ming’s hand.</p><p>With the token, as long as one’s identity was clear, they could take the inter-province transportation formation. He had no reason to stop them.</p><p>so you managed to bid for a territory-crossing token. Alright, you’re qualified to take the territory-crossing teleportation array. Which domain you’re going to, you can’t go more than 20 domains away from the Hong domain.</p><p>The middle-aged man said.</p><p>“The Tianxuan region!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Tianxuan region?”</p><p>The middle-aged man frowned and said, ” “Sure, go up!”</p><p>The middle-aged man waved his hand.</p><p>“Wait a moment!”</p><p>At this moment, a gloomy voice sounded.</p><p>“Qin qingfei!”</p><p>Upon hearing this voice, Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold and he turned around.</p><p>Two young figures were rapidly approaching.</p><p>One of them was Qin qingfei.</p><p>The other person was wearing a green robe. He was tall and had a cold expression. He emitted a cold and terrifying aura.</p><p>“Qin Qingshan!”</p><p>Fei Xue suddenly let out a cry of surprise. Her beautiful eyes looked at the green-robed man in shock.</p><p>“Qing Fei, Qing Shan, why have you come?”</p><p>When the middle-aged man saw Qin qingfei and the other man, he smiled and went up to them.</p><p>“Eighth uncle, my big brother and I came here to capture a bold man!”</p><p>Qin qingfei laughed coldly. He looked at Lu Ming and shouted, ” “Lu Ming, how dare you steal from the Treasury of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace and steal a large number of esoteric crystals. Kneel down and wait for your punishment!”</p><p>“I’ve stolen from the Treasury? Which eye of yours saw that?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“Is there a need to look? The intent crystals you took out were all lost in the Treasury of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. There are still some in your storage ring. Hurry up and take them out to check!”</p><p>Qin qingfei shouted.</p><p>“Qin qingfei, you’re talking nonsense. The Treasury of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace is so tightly guarded that even sea of soul realm experts can’t get in, let alone Lu Ming. You’re talking nonsense!”</p><p>Fei Xue shouted in anger.</p><p>Qin qingfei was clearly trying to pin a crime on Lu Ming without any evidence. How could he not be angry?</p><p>feixue, this is the truth. Are you trying to protect him? ”</p><p>Qin qingfei shouted.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Fei Xue’s chest heaved. She had never seen such a shameless person.</p><p>“Feixue, move aside. No matter what, you can’t do it. This brat must stay and be examined. If he’s innocent, we’ll naturally let him go!”</p><p>Qin Qingshan stepped forward and spoke.</p><p>Although his voice was calm, it was filled with a commanding tone.</p><p>Qin Qingshan, you’re one of the top 1000 talents of the eastern barren territory. Are you as shameless as your brother? ”</p><p>Fei Xue shouted.</p><p>“I said, take this kid down first. When he is found innocent, we will naturally let him go!”</p><p>Qin Qingshan said indifferently. He stepped forward, and a cold aura emanated from his body, pressing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Brat, surrender without a fight, or do you want me to take action? if you want me to take action personally, don’t say that I’m too ruthless if you hurt your tendons and bones!”</p><p>Qin Qingshan looked at Lu Ming with an indifferent gaze.</p><p>Although he knew that Lu Ming had killed the three Phantom kills, he still did not think much of it.</p><p>He was ranked 999th on the list of top 1000 talents in the eastern barren territory.</p><p>“Qin Qingshan!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He remembered that he had seen Qin Qingshan’s name on the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>He was ranked 999th after the sacred constellation.</p><p>I’d like to see how amazing the geniuses on the list of top 1000 talents are.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with fighting spirit.</p><p>“You want to fight me? He he he!”</p><p>Qin Qingshan chuckled, but everyone could hear the disdain in his voice.</p><p>haha, kid, you think you can fight my big brother? you’re overestimating yourself!</p><p>Qin qingfei laughed.</p><p>“Brother Lu!”</p><p>Fei Xue called out softly. She knew how terrifying Qin Qingshan was.</p><p>“It’s fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. The fighting spirit in his eyes grew stronger.</p><p>The battle with the sacred constellation was just around the corner after he rushed back to the Tianxuan region. What harm was there in testing the strength of a sovereign on the list of top 1000 talents?</p><p>“Lu Ming, right? You’re not bad. Half a year ago, you might have been qualified to fight with me, but now, you’re far from it!”</p><p>Qin Qingshan smiled and took a step forward.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A powerful aura burst out from Qin Qingshan’s body. It was vast and mighty, filling the sky. The huge pressure was like a mountain, pressing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Peak-tier King!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>Qin Qingshan’s cultivation had reached the peak King tier.</p><p>He had just said that Lu Ming was able to fight with him half a year ago. This meant that half a year ago, he was still a King tier. Now, he had broken through.</p><p>From the looks of it, the Holy star had most likely broken through as well.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
