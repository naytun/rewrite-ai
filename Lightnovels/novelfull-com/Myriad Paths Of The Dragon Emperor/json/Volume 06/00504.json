Form the first group of reinforcements and head to Tianxuan sub-Palace. After that, there will be a few more groups heading to Tianxuan sub-Palace separately!</p><p>The middle-aged attendant said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He then left the hall of missions and returned to the eastern sky courtyard.</p><p>Sitting cross-legged in the courtyard, Lu Ming’s thoughts were running wild.</p><p>Tianxuan sub-Palace, the Sheng family. Senior Sister Mu Lan should be in Tianxuan sub-Palace too. Alright, even if Tianxuan sub-Palace is a Dragon’s pool or a Tiger’s Den, I, Lu Ming, will still go there!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming continued to study the concept of fire.</p><p>After this period of comprehension, the fire concept was about to reach the level of condensing concept runes. As long as the fire concept condensed into concept runes, then the wind, fire, fierce lightning concepts would all reach concept runes. Lu Ming’s combat strength would undoubtedly be greatly improved.</p><p>Moreover, he could even cultivate the fourth level of the Dragon God’s three absolutes.</p><p>Beside a small lake, mu Zheng was standing with his hands behind his back.</p><p>Mu xiuyuan was standing beside him.</p><p>sixth uncle, the Sheng family is so fast. They actually used this trick to summon Lu Ming to Tianxuan sub-Palace. What should we do now? ”</p><p>Mu xiuyuan said.</p><p>the Sheng family’s move is indeed brilliant. Even I can’t refuse it. Lu Ming’s arrival in Tianxuan sub-Palace is undoubtedly a dangerous move!</p><p>Mu Zheng sighed slightly.</p><p>“How about this? Yuan Xiu, you go to Tianxuan sub-Palace immediately and wait for an opportunity to take care of Lu Ming!”</p><p>Mu Zheng continued.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll set off immediately!”</p><p>Mu xiuyuan nodded, and then his figure flashed, and he disappeared without a trace.</p><p>In the lightning Palace, the lightning Palace Master laughed wildly and was extremely carefree.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, you’ll be dead by the time we get to Tianxuan sub-Palace! I’ll just wait here for your ‘good news’! ”</p><p>……</p><p>A day passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The next morning, Lu Ming arrived at the missions Hall.</p><p>There were already some people gathered in the mission Hall. Lu Ming swept his gaze across them.</p><p>There were men and women, young and old, but all of them were martial Kings.</p><p>A few of them had terrifying auras and were unfathomable.</p><p>“Lower tier King tier!”</p><p>Those people were definitely lower tier Kings.</p><p>The number of people was still slowly increasing.</p><p>More than ten minutes later, there were exactly fifty people in the missions Hall, including Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, an old man walked into the mission Palace Hall.</p><p>“Palace Master!”</p><p>“Greetings, Palace Master!”</p><p>Everyone saluted.</p><p>This old man was mu Zheng, the palace Master of the eastern Palace of the Tianxuan region.</p><p>Mu Zheng revealed a warm smile. He swept his gaze across the room and his eyes stopped on Lu Ming for a moment. well, now the first batch of fifty people heading to the Tianxuan sub-Palace has arrived. You can set off immediately. Remember, in the process of killing the enemy, you must try your best to protect your own safety. I’ll be here waiting for your return!</p><p>thank you, Palace Master. We will definitely try our best to protect ourselves. Then, we will try our best to kill the enemy and make a contribution. We will spread the divine might of the eastern Tianxuan region!</p><p>Everyone replied.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go!”</p><p>Mu Zheng waved his hand.</p><p>Lu Ming and the others bade farewell to mu Zheng and set off for Tianxuan sub-Palace.</p><p>The Tianxuan sub-Palace was located in the middle of the Tianxuan region. It was ten times the size of the eastern part of the Tianxuan region, and the spiritual Qi was extremely rich.</p><p>There were many geniuses and experts.</p><p>That place was the core of the Tianxuan region.</p><p>Over there, there was no doubt that the Empyrean heaven divine Palace would be the hegemon, controlling everything. There were also some small powers that were attached to the Empyrean heaven divine Palace.</p><p>There were two great clans in the Empyrean heaven divine Palace that controlled everything.</p><p>One was the Sheng family.</p><p>The Sheng family had an extremely long history. Even before the Emperor heaven divine Palace appeared, the Sheng family had already existed. They were undoubtedly the Overlord of the mysterious sky region.</p><p>The other clan head was the MU clan.</p><p>The current Palace Master of the heaven Mystic Palace was the MU clan’s clan master.</p><p>The MU clan could be said to be a new clan in the Tianxuan region. It had risen to power less than a hundred years ago, but its strength was extremely powerful.</p><p>The two great clans stood at the peak of the Tianxuan region.</p><p>The eastern part of the Tianxuan region was extremely far away from the Tianxuan sub-Palace. Even if all of them were martial King realm martial artists, it would still take them a month to reach the Tianxuan sub-Palace.</p><p>Everyone headed toward the Tianxuan sub-Palace at lightning speed.</p><p>Among them, some of them were smarter. They had guessed that the reason why Lu Ming was summoned to Tianxuan sub-Palace was most likely related to the Sheng family. They stayed far away from Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered and continued on his way.</p><p>Every three days, they would stop to rest and recover their true Qi.</p><p>Soon, half a month had passed, and everyone had already left the Eastern Region of the Tianxuan region and entered the central region. However, there was still a long way to go before they could reach the Tianxuan sub-Palace.</p><p>On this night, the group stopped in a Valley. Someone lit a bonfire, caught demonic beasts, and roasted their meat.</p><p>Lu Ming stood alone at the side and lit a bonfire as well. Then, he rushed into a large mountain and brought back a strong horned sheep. After cleaning the horned sheep, he began to roast the meat.</p><p>Very soon, a fragrant aroma filled his nose.</p><p>The mutton became oily and shiny.</p><p>Lu Ming took out a jar of wine and ate and drank alone.</p><p>“Haha, good wine, this is really good wine. Brother Lu, can you let me, old Zhuang, have a taste of this wine and meat?</p><p>A tall and burly man with strong arms walked to the bonfire and grinned.</p><p>“Of course you can, please!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>The burly man’s name was Zhuang Hong. He was extremely powerful and was one of the three lower tier King tiers among Lu Ming’s group of fifty people.</p><p>However, he was honest and sincere, so he didn’t think too much.</p><p>Along the way, he was the only one who would talk to Lu Ming occasionally.</p><p>Zhuang Hong grinned and sat down. He then tore off a leg of lamb and started eating.</p><p>it’s so fragrant. It’s so fragrant. The meat is fat but not greasy. So many people have roasted meat, but I still like yours the most, brother Lu!</p><p>Zhuang Hong’s mouth was full of oil as he loudly praised.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and waved his hand. A jar of fine wine appeared and he threw it to Zhuang Hong.</p><p>Zhuang Hong took it, opened the lid, and took a big gulp. He praised, ” “Good wine, it’s really good wine!”</p><p>“Please!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and started to eat and drink.</p><p>brother Lu, to be honest, I really admire you. Even in the face of the Sheng family, you can still hold your head high. You can say whatever you want and scold whatever you want. That’s a true warrior and a true man. I admire you. Come, let me toast to you!</p><p>Zhuang Hong said as he ate.</p><p>Lu Ming clinked his glass with Zhuang Hong’s and took a big gulp from the wine jar.</p><p>brother Lu, I have high hopes for you. With your talent, you will definitely be able to defeat those arrogant geniuses of the Sheng family in time!</p><p>Zhuang Hong shouted again.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming frowned and his expression changed slightly.</p><p>“There’s the smell of blood!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>“Brother Lu, we’ve killed so many demonic beasts just now. Of course, there’s a bloody smell!” Zhuang Hong was stunned.</p><p>“It’s not the smell of demonic beasts” blood, but of humans.”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons had devoured a large amount of blood essence from humans and demonic beasts. Therefore, Lu Ming could easily tell the difference between the blood of humans and demonic beasts.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Suddenly, a shrill scream came from the forest in the distance.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
