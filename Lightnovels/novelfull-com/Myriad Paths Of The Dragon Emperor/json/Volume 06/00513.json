However, the price is ridiculously high!</p><p>...</p><p>therefore, there’s a saying in Tianxuan city. If anyone can get a house, they’ll become rich overnight, and they’ll have less to work for decades.</p><p>Mu xiuyuan said.</p><p>Lu Ming was amazed.</p><p>Indeed, every inch of land in Tianxuan city was worth its weight in gold. If they could be allocated a house, they would be rich even if they rented it to others.</p><p>however, it’s very difficult for ordinary Ditian divine guards to be allocated a room unless they have made great contributions. Only the MU clan and the Sheng clan will have some people assigned to a room.</p><p>Mu xiuyuan continued.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly. He could only be envious.</p><p>No wonder there were so many geniuses and experts in the Sheng family. One could imagine how strong the geniuses of the Sheng family would be if they cultivated in such an environment every day.</p><p>On the other hand, the other empyrean heaven divine guards had to spend a large number of spirit crystals to rent a place for them to stay and cultivate. This was the difference between them.</p><p>The two of them chatted as they walked.</p><p>Soon, the two of them arrived at the second area.</p><p>Indeed, the heaven and earth spiritual Qi and intent realm here were much richer than the first area.</p><p>“Lu Ming, which area do you want to rent a house in?”</p><p>Mu xiuyuan asked.</p><p>“Let’s go to the third area!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>He didn’t have many spiritual crystals left, but didn’t he just get a storage ring from Shengfeng? He believed that there would be a lot of top-grade spiritual crystals in it, which would be a good use.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Soon, the two of them arrived at the third area.</p><p>Here, the spiritual Qi and the essence realm of heaven and earth had reached an astonishing level.</p><p>It would cost at least 10 Supreme spiritual crystals for a day, and the most expensive one would cost 100 Supreme spiritual crystals.</p><p>Lu Ming looked around for a while and stopped in front of a mansion.</p><p>“Let’s go to this one!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Mu xiuyuan nodded and said, ” Lu Ming, I won’t keep you company then. By the way, the Ditian divine guards sent by the four branches have only been here for half a month. They can rest well and don’t have to go out to fight the heavenly corpse sect. However, they’ll have to set off to fight the heavenly corpse sect in half a month’s time.</p><p>there are usually two ways. One is that the mission Hall will issue some missions related to killing the heavenly corpse sect, and there will be a reward for completing them. The second way is that if someone doesn’t accept any missions, they will be arranged to go to the battlefield and participate in the war against the heavenly corpse sect!</p><p>“Many thanks, brother mu!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists.</p><p>“Alright then, I’ll take my leave!”</p><p>Mu xiuyuan smiled, then strode into the depths of Tianxuan city.</p><p>Mu xiuyuan was a direct descendant of the MU family, and his cultivation level was unfathomable. Naturally, he lived in the deepest part, the Fourth District.</p><p>After mu xiuyuan left, Lu Ming walked toward the mansion at the side.</p><p>“This little brother, are you looking to rent a house?”</p><p>There was a middle-aged man at the entrance of the mansion. He smiled when he saw Lu Ming entering.</p><p>that’s right. I’m here to rent a house. How many crystals a day? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>50 top-grade spiritual crystals a day. How long do you want to rent it for? ” he asked.</p><p>The middle-aged man said.</p><p>“I’ll rent it for fifteen days!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out 750 pieces of top-grade spirit crystals and handed them to the middle-aged man.</p><p>The middle-aged man took it, and the smile on his face grew even wider. He took out a Jade token and said, ” little brother, this is your key. Your room is Room 19!</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming took the Jade token and walked into the mansion.</p><p>There were rooms in the mansion, and each room had a room number written on it.</p><p>Number 19. Lu Ming found room number 19 very quickly.</p><p>These rooms were made of stone. Even the door was made of stone. There was a pit on the stone door. Lu Ming placed the Jade card in the pit.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The stone door opened automatically and Lu Ming walked in.</p><p>The room was very simple, with only a bed and a table.</p><p>Lu Ming closed the door and sat cross-legged on the bed.</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming seemed to have become one with heaven and earth, quietly comprehending the concept of heaven and earth.</p><p>“The essence realm of the heaven and earth here is really clear!”</p><p>Lu Ming was rather shocked.</p><p>He felt that even though this place was still lacking compared to the Dao enlightenment Palace, it was still much, much stronger than the outside world.</p><p>This area was only worth 50 top-grade spirit crystals a day. Even if the areas worth 100 top-grade spirit crystals were not as good as the Dao enlightenment Palace, they were not far from it.</p><p>Then what was the fourth region like?</p><p>No wonder the Sheng family had such resources. No wonder they had been able to dominate the Tianxuan region for countless years.</p><p>Lu Ming took out the path-understanding ancient tree to help him comprehend the essence realm of heaven and earth at a faster speed. His main focus now was to comprehend the essence realm of fire.</p><p>……</p><p>In the fourth area, in an elegant courtyard, more than a dozen young experts of the Sheng family were gathered.</p><p>The Holy Wind, Holy sky, and holy river were all inside.</p><p>At this moment, Shengfeng, shengkong, and another young man were standing there with red faces.</p><p>the few of you are really useless. You were actually beaten up by a country bumpkin from the East. You’ve really embarrassed the Sheng family. This time, if it wasn’t for Sheng Jiang’s arrival, the Sheng family would have lost all its face.</p><p>A young man wearing a purple robe and a purple jade ring on his finger said coldly.</p><p>The purple-robed young man obviously had a high status among the dozens of young men. Shengfeng, shengkong, and the others looked terrible, but they did not dare to refute.</p><p>“This time, if it wasn’t for mu Xiu Yuan’s interference, I would have already crippled that brat and taken him down!”</p><p>Shengjiang said coldly.</p><p>Hmph, this time, it’s not your fault. Mu xiuyuan will be taught a lesson sooner or later. The most important thing now is to take down that kid called Lu Ming. This is not only about the Sheng family’s face, but also the intention of the young master of constellation!</p><p>The purple-robed youth said.</p><p>As soon as the purple-robed young man mentioned the Holy star, the other young men’s expressions immediately changed, and they became unusually serious.</p><p>It was as if they were in awe of the sacred stars.</p><p>but that kid must have rented a house in Tianxuan city. Tianxuan city is so big with so many houses. It’s hard to find him!</p><p>Another youth said.</p><p>“That’s simple. That Lu Ming came from the East to provide reinforcements. He can rest for half a month at most. Half a month later, he’ll definitely appear. By then, we’ll either accept missions or force him to take on missions. As long as we send someone to keep an eye on the mission Hall, we’ll know when he appears!”</p><p>The purple-robed youth said confidently.</p><p>“Bro Yu is so wise!”</p><p>The other young men flattered.</p><p>The purple-robed young man was called shengyu. He smiled proudly and said, ” some time ago, the young master of Star Palace had a fortuitous encounter and is now cultivating in seclusion. When the young master of Star Palace comes out of his seclusion, he will definitely be stronger. What we need to do is to take down Lu Ming before the young master of Star Palace comes out of his seclusion. That way, the young master of Star Palace will definitely value us more!</p><p>yes, that’s for sure. Lu Ming is dead for sure!</p><p>The others all agreed.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming did not know any of this. He was focused on cultivating.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, five days had passed.</p><p>He didn’t know why, but he felt that he had cultivated the concept of fire to its limit, yet he still couldn’t condense an intent rune.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
