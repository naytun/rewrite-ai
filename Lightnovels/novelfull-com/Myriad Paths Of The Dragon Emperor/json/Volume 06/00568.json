BOOM!</p><p>...</p><p>Half a day later, a series of rumbles sounded in the sky above a mountain peak hundreds of thousands of miles away.</p><p>A few figures were engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>“Gokudo path attack!”</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Lu Ming’s spear pierced through the space between the eyebrows of a middle-aged corpse guard and he died unwillingly.</p><p>it seems that I’ll have no problem killing a corpse guard at the peak of Lv 8 martial King realm with my extreme strike. However, corpse guards are weaker than ordinary martial artists. My combat strength is still no match for a King at the upper tier of Lv 9 martial King realm!</p><p>Lu Ming kept his long spear and pondered.</p><p>On the ground below, there were dozens of corpses, all of which were corpse guards.</p><p>Not long ago, Lu Ming had come here and encountered these corpse guards, and a great battle had begun.</p><p>The leader of these corpse guards was a peak Lv 8 martial King. Lu Ming had to use all his combat strength to kill all of them.</p><p>His quintessential essence swept out and collected all the storage rings.</p><p>Lu Ming found a place and started to count.</p><p>His harvest this time was even greater than last time. He had nearly thirty thousand intent crystals in total.</p><p>Crazy, this was too crazy.</p><p>Even with Lu Ming’s composure, he could not help but tremble.</p><p>Intent crystals weren’t something that could be measured by price. If they were taken out, countless people would fight for them.</p><p>“Right now, should I cultivate first, or should I go and hunt the heavenly corpse sect’s corpse guards first?”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>I’d better cultivate first. From the looks of it, I won’t be able to return any time soon. I might as well rush to the late King tier in one go. That way, I won’t have to fear anyone in this place other than those giant beasts.</p><p>Lu Ming made up his mind and then took out a piece of Thunder profound crystal.</p><p>He planned to comprehend the Thunder concept first. After all, his Thunder concept was lagging behind the other two concepts.</p><p>&Nbsp; he planned to first use low-grade lightning intent crystals to raise his lightning intent to the peak of level one small success, then use mid-grade lightning intent crystals to break through to level one large success.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming crushed a Thunder profound crystal, closed his eyes, and began to comprehend.</p><p>However, Lu Ming opened his eyes in less than a minute.</p><p>“What’s going on? Why did the intent realm threads in the intent crystals disappear for no reason?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with bewilderment.</p><p>When he was cultivating just now, he realized that he couldn’t absorb any intent at all. It had completely disappeared.</p><p>“Faster, I want to see what’s going on.”</p><p>Lu Ming took out another piece and crushed it.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming did not start to comprehend. Instead, he observed carefully.</p><p>In the end, he was dumbfounded to find that all of the intent realm threads had flown to the space between his brows and were absorbed by the lightning cauldron in his sea of consciousness.</p><p>“No way, nest?”</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p><p>&Nbsp; he had never used lightning intent crystals before, so he hadn’t noticed this problem.</p><p>This lightning cauldron was actually trying to snatch the lightning concept silk from him.</p><p>Lu Ming did not give up. He crushed a few more Thunder profound crystals, but the result was the same.</p><p>Lu Ming crushed another esoteric crystal, but the lightning cauldron did not react at all.</p><p>“Nest, you don’t have to do this. I’ll XXXX”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He had the urge to vomit blood.</p><p>This way, didn’t that mean he had to comprehend the Thunder concept honestly and couldn’t use intent crystals to rapidly increase it?</p><p>His plan to increase his cultivation base at a crazy rate was going to be ruined.</p><p>Because no matter how fast he comprehended other concepts, it would be useless if the Thunder concept didn’t catch up.</p><p>“Heavens, why are you playing with me like this!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the large pile of Thunder profound crystals in the storage ring and sighed to the sky.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s consciousness appeared in his consciousness. He looked at the lightning cauldron and gritted his teeth.</p><p>He wished he could just throw the lightning cauldron away.</p><p>However, he was just thinking about it. Let’s not talk about whether he could do it or not. Even if he could, he couldn’t bear to do it.</p><p>“Forget it, I’ll just comprehend it honestly.”</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged under the lightning cauldron and began to comprehend the lightning concept.</p><p>Fortunately, the path-understanding ancient tree was placed next to Lu Ming. Even if he was in his sea of consciousness, the effect would still be ten times that of normal.</p><p>After all, the sea of consciousness was only in the space between his eyebrows.</p><p>Lu Ming calmed his heart down and started to comprehend the concept of Thunder.</p><p>Even without the profound meaning crystals, with the help of the Thunder cauldron and the path-understanding ancient tree, Lu Ming’s comprehension of the Thunder mentality was extremely fast. It was a hundred times faster than the others.</p><p>Ten days later, Lu Ming’s comprehension of the Thunder concept had reached the peak of level one lower tier.</p><p>However, it was not easy to break through to level one upper tier. It required accumulation.</p><p>Lu Ming had been in this place for more than a month.</p><p>“I must quickly think of a way to get out of here. There are only three and a half months left until the day of Senior Sister Mu Lan’s wedding with the sacred constellation and the day of my challenge to the sacred constellation.”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>However, he was still clueless about how to get out.</p><p>Lu Ming decided to hunt corpse guards while he searched for a way to get out.</p><p>After leaving the Supreme shrine, Lu Ming flew in a straight line in one direction.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>At this moment, dandan, who was hanging in her hair, flew out. Her whole body was shining and trembling slightly. Then, she flew in one direction at an extreme speed.</p><p>“What’s going on? What did dandan find?”</p><p>Lu Ming had some doubts and flew to follow dandan.</p><p>After flying for about ten thousand miles, a huge mountain shrouded in dark red mist appeared in front of them.</p><p>The surroundings of this mountain peak were deathly silent. There were no plants nor any living beings.</p><p>The mountain was filled with dark red mist, and it was obvious that it was an evil creature.</p><p>Dandan flew to the front of the mountain, trembling slightly, as if she was very excited, and then flew into the mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming followed him and flew in.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming came into contact with the dark red mist, an earth-shattering battle cry rang out in his mind. He realized that his surroundings had changed. It had become a living hell.</p><p>Millions of corpses lay on the ground, and blood flowed like rivers. Countless powerful existences were fighting.</p><p>Lu Ming saw a true dragon flying in the sky, but it was torn into two by a demonic shadow that was as tall as the sky.</p><p>Lu Ming saw a Phoenix flying across the sky, but its wings were cut off by a demonic shadow.</p><p>A human expert slashed open the sky with a sword, but he was blasted apart by a fiend shadow with a punch.</p><p>……</p><p>An unimaginable scene appeared before Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>The terrifying killing intent almost made Lu Ming’s mind collapse.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming felt a force pulling at him. The surrounding environment changed. He was still at the edge of the mountain.</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons surrounded his body, and the devouring power burst out to resist the dark red mist.</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a long sigh of relief. This dark red mist was too strange. It was extremely dangerous just now and Lu Ming almost had a mental breakdown.</p><p>“What was that scene just now? Could it be a real war that happened in history?”</p><p>Lu Ming was very curious.</p><p>“Dandan!”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming used the nine Dragons bloodline to protect his body and rushed toward the mountain peak.</p><p>When he reached the peak, he was dumbfounded.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
