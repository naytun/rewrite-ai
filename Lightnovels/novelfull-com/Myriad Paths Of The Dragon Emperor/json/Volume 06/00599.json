Xiu Yuan, let’s go out!”</p><p>Mu Zheng pulled mu xiuyuan and similarly stepped into the air to meet those people.</p><p>“Greetings, big brother, second brother!”</p><p>Mu Zheng called out.</p><p>One of the two people in front was an old man with a head full of white hair, and the other was a burly man who looked to be in his fifties.</p><p>That burly man in his fifties was mu Zheng’s elder brother, Mu Lan’s father, and the current Palace Master of the heaven Mystic Palace, mu Tian.</p><p>The white-haired old man was mu Zheng’s second brother, mu Yi.</p><p>The age of martial arts powerhouses could not be distinguished by appearance.</p><p>Mu Tian, for example, was the oldest. However, he looked like he was only in his fifties. This was because his cultivation was the most profound and he had already broken through to the spirit ocean realm. Thus, he looked the youngest.</p><p>As for mu Yi and mu Zheng, they both looked like old men.</p><p>“Greetings, eldest uncle, second uncle!”</p><p>Mu xiuyuan stepped forward and bowed.</p><p>Mu xiuyuan’s father was the fifth child, but he had died in battle in his early years.</p><p>“Yes, let’s go up and sit!”</p><p>Mu Tian nodded and walked up to the platform.</p><p>At the top of the square, there was a row of high platforms, specially for people of status to sit on.</p><p>After they sat down, they began to chat.</p><p>“Sixth brother, I heard that Lu Ming is from your Eastern Palace. He was very arrogant before and actually challenged the sacred constellation. Now, he’s gone into hiding with his tail between his legs.”</p><p>Mu Yi looked at mu Zheng and said with a faint smile.</p><p>“Second brother, Lu Ming is most likely held up by something. He might not be in hiding. The rumors from the outside world can not be trusted.”</p><p>Mu Zheng said.</p><p>“Hehe, is that so? “I heard that Lu Ming challenged the sacred constellation because of LAN ‘er. Young man, you really don’t know the immensity of heaven and earth. You don’t have a clear understanding of your own status. Is LAN’ er worthy of you? Even if he has some talent, does my mu clan lack talented youths? The sacred constellation is a Supreme chosen!”</p><p>Mu Yi said with a cold smile.</p><p>Even if they were brothers by blood, there would still be competition and discord. Mu Yi and mu Zheng had always been at odds with each other. Thus, mu Yi would not let go of any opportunity to attack mu Zheng.</p><p>“Second uncle, I don’t think so. Lu Ming is not an Ordinary Genius. Give him a few years and he’ll definitely be on the list of top 1000 talents!”</p><p>Mu Xiu Yuan interjected.</p><p>“Get on the list of top 1000 talents? How ignorant, is it that easy to get onto the list of top 1000 talents? Just based on a kid who came from the eastern Mountain area? Young people are really whimsical. Alright, the elders are talking, don’t interrupt!”</p><p>Mu Yi chided softly, his voice filled with faint disdain.</p><p>Mu xiuyuan’s expression was a little ugly, but he didn’t continue to speak.</p><p>big brother has good eyes. Sheng Xingchen, born from the Sheng clan, is a match for our mu clan. Furthermore, he has unparalleled talent and is a peerless genius. He’s a perfect match for LAN ‘er!</p><p>Mu Yi laughed.</p><p>Mu Tian only nodded slightly and did not say much.</p><p>Mu Yi continued. the key is that the forces on the side of the sacred constellation’s mother are too strong. As long as we can get close to them after LAN ‘er and the sacred constellation are married, our Mu family will be able to develop steadily. We’ll be impregnable.</p><p>Mu Zheng’s expression changed slightly upon hearing this. It became slightly grave.</p><p>Indeed, Sheng Xingchen’s mother had an extremely great background. She came from the main palace of the Emperor heaven divine Palace and was the direct descendant of an extremely powerful clan.</p><p>Although their mu clan was extremely powerful in the Tianxuan region, they were nothing when compared to the power of the main palace of the Emperor heaven divine Palace.</p><p>The main palace of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace was the core of the palace.</p><p>The sacred constellation was not only terrifyingly talented, but it also had a terrifying background. Lu Ming was far inferior compared to it.</p><p>……</p><p>In a huge mansion in the Fourth District of Tianxuan city.</p><p>This was the Sheng family’s residence.</p><p>At this moment, a group of people gathered at the entrance of the mansion and chatted.</p><p>I wanted to see Lu Ming being tortured by the young master of stars. I didn’t expect that guy to hide and not dare to meet anyone.</p><p>that’s right. To think that I’ve waited for half a year with such high expectations. What a coward. He only knows how to talk big and show off for a moment.</p><p>Hmph, I’ve already expected this outcome. If he doesn’t hide and really challenges the young master of Xingchen, he’ll definitely die. In the eyes of that kind of person, face is nothing, his life is definitely more important.</p><p>These were all the heroes of the Sheng family. Some of them had even been beaten up by Lu Ming before. Naturally, they hoped that the sacred constellation could torture Lu Ming. However, they did not expect that Lu Ming would actually ‘hide’. This made them very disappointed.</p><p>the young master of Xingchen has come out!</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>A few people walked out of the mansion.</p><p>Sacred constellation was dressed in a festive red robe and walked in the middle. Beside him was a middle-aged couple. They were sacred constellation’s parents, the current rulers of the Sheng family.</p><p>There was another man in his forties. He was handsome and had a dignified aura.</p><p>He was Sheng Xingchen’s mother’s elder brother, Sheng Xingchen’s uncle. He had come from the main palace of the Emperor heaven divine Palace.</p><p>Xingchen, go to the MU family and welcome the bride. Your father, uncle, and I will wait for you at the banquet.</p><p>The mother of the Holy constellation said.</p><p>“Yes, mother!”</p><p>Sheng Xingchen nodded.</p><p>Then, Saint Starlight’s mother and the others stepped into the air and went to the square in the first District.</p><p>As for the sacred constellation, it was heading towards the MU clan.</p><p>In a Pavilion of the MU family, Mu Lan was dressed in a bright red robe, which made her look even more charming.</p><p>However, her brows were tightly furrowed, and there was not a trace of a smile on her face. Her eyes were listless and seemed a little empty.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what happened to you?”</p><p>Mu Lan said softly.</p><p>Mu Lan knew very well that Lu Ming had gone to the weapon forging sect. After that, news of the destruction of the weapon forging sect spread and Lu Ming had disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Mu Lan was very worried that Lu Ming would be in an accident.</p><p>She did not believe the rumors that spread that Lu Ming was afraid of the sacred constellation and that was why he was hiding and did not dare to meet anyone.</p><p>It could be said that she had watched Lu Ming grow up. She understood Lu Ming very well. He would never hide just because he was no match for her.</p><p>“LAN ‘er, are you alright?”</p><p>An old voice came from behind Mu Lan.</p><p>Mu Lan turned around and saw an old man. She forced a smile on her face.”Grandpa!”</p><p>This old man was naturally Yan LAN.</p><p>As Mu Lan’s grandfather, he naturally had to attend her wedding.</p><p>“AI!”</p><p>Yan LAN let out a deep sigh when she saw Mu Lan’s appearance.</p><p>He had hoped that Lu Ming would create a miracle. Unfortunately, Lu Ming had disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Mu Lan had resisted for more than ten years. In the end, she had to marry someone she didn’t like under her Father’s will.</p><p>Perhaps, this was fate!</p><p>“Miss Mu Lan, young master Xingchen is here to welcome you.”</p><p>A young woman walked in and said.</p><p>Mu Lan’s face revealed a sad smile.</p><p>“Tell young master Xingchen that I’ll go immediately!”</p><p>Mu Lan said.</p><p>“Lu Ming, where are you?”</p><p>Mu Lan looked out of the window and let out a long sigh. She then turned around and strode out of the door.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
