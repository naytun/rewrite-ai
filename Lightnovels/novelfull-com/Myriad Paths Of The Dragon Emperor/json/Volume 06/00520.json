It was rich in resources. In the past few days, they had found about 50 stalks of Level 5 spiritual herbs, spiritual flowers, and some Level 5 blacksmithing materials.</p><p>All of these added together were worth a lot.</p><p>However, he did not encounter anyone from the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>“Huh? what’s that?”</p><p>Suddenly, mu Sen pointed to a Valley in front of them.</p><p>The valley wasn’t big, and there were flashes of red light in the valley.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>The five of them flew towards the valley. When they flew in, they were shocked.</p><p>It was a large patch of red spiritual flowers.</p><p>Each spiritual flower was red like a burning flame, emitting a strong medicinal fragrance.</p><p>“This is a level 4 spiritual flower, fire cage flower!”</p><p>Han man said in surprise.</p><p>Level 4 spiritual flowers did not surprise them that much. The main thing was that there were too many of them.</p><p>They were densely packed, covering more than half of the valley. A rough estimate would put there at least a thousand of them.</p><p>A small valley could actually produce so many fire cage flowers. It was simply unbelievable and abnormal.</p><p>fire concept. There’s a faint fire concept here. It’s covered by these fire cage flowers.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming spoke.</p><p>Among the five of them, he was the only one who cultivated the fire concept. Although the fire concept here was very faint, Lu Ming could still sense it.</p><p>fire concept? ”</p><p>Han man and the others frowned, but their eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p>it’s very likely that there’s a pit of intent crystals below that contains fire-type intent crystals. That’s why so many fire cage flowers have been born.</p><p>Han man said in surprise.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He had the same guess.</p><p>Immediately, the five of them picked all the fire cage flowers.</p><p>After counting, there were a total of about 1200 stalks. If the five of them split it evenly, each of them would have more than 200 stalks.</p><p>After the fire cage flower was plucked, the red soil was revealed. A strong fire concept aura filled the air, extremely dense.</p><p>as expected, it’s an intent crystal pit. Hahaha, I’m so lucky!</p><p>Mu Lin laughed.</p><p>“Let’s start digging!”</p><p>Lu Ming also revealed a smile.</p><p>Immediately, the five of them began to dig.</p><p>As expected, not long after, han man was the first to discover a fire-type intent crystal.</p><p>Of course, it was low-grade.</p><p>The five of them dug even harder.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At this moment, the sound of something breaking through the air could be heard. Three figures appeared in the sky.</p><p>The three young men had cold and arrogant looks on their faces.</p><p>The three of them swept their gazes below and revealed excited smiles.</p><p>haha, we’re so lucky. There’s a profound meaning crystal pit here. We’ll make a fortune again.</p><p>One of the young men laughed.</p><p>Then, he looked at Lu Ming and the rest with a cold gaze and chided, ” hurry up and get lost. This place belongs to us now.</p><p>“Hahaha, what a joke. We were the ones who discovered this place first.”</p><p>Han man laughed.</p><p>“So what if you found out? If I say it’s ours now, it’s ours.”</p><p>A purple-robed young man sneered.</p><p>“On what basis?”</p><p>Mu Sen was furious.</p><p>“On what basis? Just because we’re the direct descendants of the Sheng family. Kid, look carefully.”</p><p>The purple-robed young man waved his hand and a token appeared. It was bright and there were two big words on the token: Shengtian.</p><p>“The sagely Sky Command token!”</p><p>Mu Sen, Mu Lin, and the others exclaimed.</p><p>As expected, he was a direct descendant of the Sheng family.</p><p>“Now, you can get lost.”</p><p>The purple-robed youth sneered.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Mu Sen growled.</p><p>“You three, so what if you are the direct descendants of the Sheng family? We found this place first, so according to the rules, it’s ours. Please go back!”</p><p>Han man took a step forward, his voice resounding.</p><p>brat, you dare to resist my Sheng family? you’re courting death!</p><p>The purple-robed youth shouted.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Three powerful auras burst out from the three young men of the Sheng family.</p><p>The purple-robed young man was at the peak Lv 3 martial King realm.</p><p>The other two young men from the Sheng family were at the early stage of Lv 3 martial King realm.</p><p>The three of them burst out with a powerful aura, which spread toward han man.</p><p>“You’re going too far!”</p><p>Han man shouted, and a powerful aura burst out from his body.</p><p>At the same time, mu Sen and Mu Lin’s bodies also burst out with a powerful aura, joining with han man to resist the young man from Sheng family.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>Yao Xuan was a little hesitant. She glanced at Lu Ming, bit her lips, and released her aura.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and an inexplicable smile appeared on his lips. Then, a powerful aura burst out from his body.</p><p>The combined strength of the five of them was no weaker than that of the Sheng family.</p><p>“How audacious! You still dare to resist? How dare you!”</p><p>The purple-robed young man shouted, and his face was filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>at most, we’ll just fight. I’m not afraid. Even if this goes to the palace Master, we’ll be in the right!</p><p>Han man shouted, not giving in.</p><p>“Good, good, very good!”</p><p>The purple-robed young man laughed out of anger and said “good” several times, but there was hesitation in his eyes.</p><p>I’ll remember you, ” the purple-robed young man said coldly after a while. I’ll let you go today. Go!</p><p>Then, he waved his hand and flew away with the other two young men. They disappeared in the blink of an eye.</p><p>let’s continue digging. We have to be quick. If the Sheng family comes again, we’ll be in trouble.</p><p>Han man said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Mu Sen and the rest responded and dug even harder.</p><p>No one noticed that the inexplicable smile at the corner of Lu Ming’s mouth had grown wider.</p><p>Half an hour later, more than half of the valley had been dug through. This time, they had dug out a total of thirty fire-attribute intent crystals.</p><p>It was a pity that the five of them had searched the entire place but did not find any middle-grade intent crystals.</p><p>Lu Ming secretly sighed in pity. If he had a middle-grade fire-type profound meaning crystal, he would be able to use it to condense a fire concept rune in one fell swoop.</p><p>It seemed that he could only go to the mystical treasure house in Tianxuan city and see if he could exchange earth-element mid-grade profound meaning crystals for a fire-element mid-grade profound meaning crystal.</p><p>Moreover, even if they could exchange for it, the handling fee would definitely not be low.</p><p>“Let’s quickly leave this place!”</p><p>Han man said.</p><p>&Nbsp; afterward, everyone divided the thirty fire intent crystals equally, then rose into the air and left.</p><p>A few hours later, the five of them were already 100000 miles away. At this time, night had fallen.</p><p>The five of them lit a bonfire and hunted a few demonic beasts in the nearby forest. They began to roast them.</p><p>There were also demonic beasts on this plane, but their levels were not very high.</p><p>Soon, the demonic beast meat was roasted to a golden yellow, and the fragrance assailed the nostrils.</p><p>haha, come, I’ve brought some fruit wine from my hometown. This fruit wine is a specialty of my hometown and is extremely famous. It’s brewed with 108 types of spirit fruits. Try it!</p><p>Han man laughed heartily and took out five jars of wine. He handed one jar to Lu Ming, Yao Xuan, and the rest.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
