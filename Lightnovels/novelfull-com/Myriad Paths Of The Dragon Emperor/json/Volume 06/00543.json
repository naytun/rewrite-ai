This made the murderous intent in his heart surge.</p><p>...</p><p>“Sacred constellation, let him go! Let Lu Ming go!”</p><p>Mu Lan then turned around and looked at the sacred constellation.</p><p>“LAN ‘er, what did you just say?”</p><p>Holy constellation’s face darkened, and a cold light flashed in his eyes.</p><p>“Sacred constellation, with me here today, don’t even think about harming a single hair on his head!”</p><p>Mu Lan said.</p><p>“Mu Lan!”</p><p>The killing intent in Sheng Xingchen’s eyes was like a storm.</p><p>Mu Lan was his fiancée from the sacred constellation. However, she was now protecting another man in front of everyone. Where was his face now?</p><p>At this moment, the killing intent in the heart of the sacred constellation towards Lu Ming had not weakened. Instead, it had become stronger.</p><p>originally, I only wanted to cripple him. But now, he must die!</p><p>A cold and emotionless voice came out of Sheng Xingchen’s mouth.</p><p>“You dare?”</p><p>Mu Lan stood in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, the surrounding audience looked at each other.</p><p>Some quick-witted ones had already noticed something and revealed strange expressions.</p><p>“Mu Lan, you think you can stop me? Get out of my way!”</p><p>With a wave of sacred constellation’s hand, Starlight burst forth like ribbons of light, entangling Mu Lan and mu xiuyuan.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Mu Lan and mu xiuyuan released their powerful auras.</p><p>After not seeing each other for a while, Mu Lan had already reached the martial King realm, and mu xiuyuan had also reached the peak of the sixth level of the martial King realm.</p><p>However, it was all in vain. Under the starlight of the sacred constellation, he had no power to resist at all. He was directly entangled by the Starlight and pulled to the side of the sacred constellation.</p><p>“Senior Sister Mu Lan!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Mu Lan also shouted.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s see who can save you now. Die!”</p><p>Under the pressure of the sacred stars, there was only cold killing intent.</p><p>Previously, he had thought that Lu Ming was talented and wanted to take him in for his own use. Now, he was determined to kill him.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A cold killing intent and a powerful aura burst out from Sheng Xingchen’s body. He clenched his fist in the air and a starry sword appeared in his hand.</p><p>“It’s still not certain who will live and who will die on the Holy star,”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were also extremely cold as he stared at the sacred constellation. Wisps of lightning swam between his eyebrows.</p><p>“You?”</p><p>Holy star sneered contemptuously. He took a step forward, and the divine guards ‘battle platform rumbled violently.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes shone brightly, and the ruthlessness in his eyes intensified.</p><p>He knew that even if he could kill the sacred constellation with the Thunder cauldron, he would not be able to survive. The other members of the Sheng family would not let him go. Furthermore, the secret of the Thunder cauldron would be exposed.</p><p>But now, he had no other choice.</p><p>stop! Holy star, I promise you. As long as you let Lu Ming go, I promise to marry you a year later!</p><p>At this moment, Mu Lan shouted.</p><p>Holy constellation’s figure paused and stopped.</p><p>He then turned around and looked at Mu Lan. it seems that this kid really has some weight in your heart!</p><p>“You don’t have to worry about that. I promise to marry you in a year’s time. As long as you let Lu Ming go, I’d rather die than marry you if you kill him!”</p><p>Mu Lan said.</p><p>“Senior Sister Mu Lan, you can’t!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared.</p><p>However, Mu Lan ignored Lu Ming. She only stared at the sacred constellation.</p><p>“Okay, I promise you, but not one year later, but half a year later. After half a year, you and I get married, and I’ll let this kid go.”</p><p>Holy star said coldly.</p><p>“Half a year?”</p><p>Mu Lan gritted her teeth. She glanced at Lu Ming and said,”Alright, I promise you.”</p><p>Seeing that Mu Lan had agreed, sacred constellation waved its hand, and the Starlight that had wrapped around Mu Lan and mu xiuyuan dissipated. The two of them regained their freedom.</p><p>Once the two of them regained their freedom, they walked toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Senior Sister Mu Lan, why did you agree to him? He might not be able to kill me. ”</p><p>Lu Ming said, his heart full of unwillingness.</p><p>Mu Lan smiled faintly. She thought that Lu Ming was speaking in a fit of anger and did not take it to heart. Lu Ming, we’re engaged after all. Perhaps this is fate. I’ve always wanted to escape but I can’t!</p><p>A long sigh sounded softly.</p><p>Giggle …</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists so tightly that cracking sounds could be heard.</p><p>He knew that Mu Lan was doing this all because of him. Otherwise, with Mu Lan’s personality, she would never agree to it.</p><p>“Lu Ming, with LAN ‘er pleading for you today, I’ll spare your life,”</p><p>Sheng Xingchen said coldly. After that, he revealed a look of contempt and continued,”Lu Ming, do you think you’re worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as me? you can only hide behind women.”</p><p>With that, he smiled contemptuously and turned to leave.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s voice was heard.</p><p>“Holy star, since that’s the case, do you dare to accept my challenge?”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was like a storm, sweeping through the entire scene again.</p><p>Many people were dumbfounded.</p><p>“What? What did I just hear? Lu Ming actually wants to challenge the sacred constellation?”</p><p>he’s so bold. He’s looking for death.</p><p>arrogant and conceited! This is what you call arrogant and conceited!</p><p>The entire place burst into an earth-shattering uproar.</p><p>It had been a few years since anyone from the younger generation in the Tianxuan region had dared to challenge the sacred constellation.</p><p>“You want to challenge me?”</p><p>Holy constellation turned around and asked. Even he was a little surprised.</p><p>that’s right. Half a year from now, you and I will fight. Do you dare? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said loudly.</p><p>“Half a year later?”</p><p>The corners of sacred constellation’s mouth curled into a cold smile. He glanced at Mu Lan and said,”Do you really think that you can catch up to me in half a year? Fight me?”</p><p>“You don’t need to worry about this.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you can’t. You don’t have to …”</p><p>Mu Lan said anxiously.</p><p>He knew that the reason why Lu Ming chose to challenge the sacred constellation in half a year’s time was definitely related to her.</p><p>However, given Lu Ming’s cultivation base, he would not be a match for the sacred constellation in half a year.</p><p>If Lu Ming could fight above his level, so could the sacred constellation.</p><p>If Lu Ming could improve, the sacred constellation would also improve continuously.</p><p>It was almost impossible to catch up to Holy constellation in just half a year.</p><p>It was not that she did not have confidence in Lu Ming. She was very confident in him. She believed that in a few years, Lu Ming would definitely be able to catch up to the sacred constellation.</p><p>However, half a year was too short.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and interrupted Mu Lan.</p><p>Senior Sister Mu Lan, this battle is inevitable. Even if it’s not for you, I’m going to pay you back for the humiliation I’ve suffered today.</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was firm and unquestionable.</p><p>“Sacred constellation, just one word. Do you dare?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were bright as he stared at the Holy star.</p><p>alright, I promise you. Half a year later, I will let you know what despair is. You will never be able to catch up to my footsteps.</p><p>Sacred constellation’s confident voice reverberated throughout the entire area.</p><p>The scene was boiling with excitement.</p><p>The Holy constellation had actually accepted Lu Ming’s challenge.</p><p>The two of them would fight half a year later.</p><p>Moreover, this battle was very interesting.</p><p>If the sacred constellation was defeated, the wedding date between him and Mu Lan would definitely be affected, or even canceled.</p><p>If Lu Ming was defeated, the Holy star would carry the momentum of victory and marry Mu Lan.</p><p>From now on, the Tianxuan region would truly be the world of the sacred constellation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
