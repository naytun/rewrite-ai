I’ll take care of it.”</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>He had nearly nine million pieces of Supreme spiritual crystals on him, which was enough to make a sixth-level spiritual weapon.</p><p>Mu xiuyuan and Mu Lan were both very surprised.</p><p>Lu Ming could even afford a sixth-level spiritual weapon? It seemed that they had underestimated Lu Ming.</p><p>that’s good. There’s a rank 6 inscriber in Tianxuan city. He’s my father’s good friend, but he’s not free these two days. How about this, I’ll come find you three days later and take you to see that inscriber master.</p><p>Mu Lan said.</p><p>“Alright, sure!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>He did not expect that there would really be a level-six inscription master in Tianxuan city.</p><p>A level six forging Grandmaster was extremely rare, and their status was even higher than that of normal sea of soul realm experts.</p><p>In the entire Tianxuan region, sea of soul realm experts were extremely rare and limited.</p><p>Every single one of them was a figure who could rule the Tianxuan region.</p><p>The Three Realms of the spiritual God were the spiritual ocean realm, the spiritual embryo realm, and the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Each realm was extremely profound. At the same time, the power one could control was also extremely terrifying. It had the power to destroy heaven and earth. It was not something that the martial King realm could compare with.</p><p>Above the spiritual God Realm was the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>The peak of the spiritual God Realm was also known as the Supreme.</p><p>The nine suns Supreme was at the peak of the spiritual God Realm, only one step away from the martial Royal realm.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming was still miles away from that level. Now was not the time to think about that.</p><p>Lu Ming then chatted with Mu Lan and mu xiuyuan for a while.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you should recuperate first!”</p><p>Mu Lan instructed with some concern, then left the place with mu xiuyuan.</p><p>After Mu Lan and mu xiuyuan left, Lu Ming sat cross-legged and started to recuperate.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had received two attacks from the Holy star and was severely injured.</p><p>He knew very well that he did not use much strength in the two moves of the Holy star. Otherwise, Lu Ming would not have been able to withstand it.</p><p>Three hours later, Lu Ming’s injuries were much better. He believed that he would be fully recovered in less than a day.</p><p>half a year. I’ll need more resources if I want to catch up to the sacred constellation in half a year.</p><p>the most important thing is the essence realm of heaven and earth. As long as I can improve the essence realm of heaven and earth, I can keep improving my cultivation as long as I have Supreme spiritual crystals.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming had the path-understanding ancient tree, he could comprehend the essence realm of heaven and earth very quickly. However, he was not satisfied.</p><p>At this rate, he would not be able to catch up to the Holy star in half a year.</p><p>intent crystals … If I have a large number of intent crystals and the path-understanding ancient tree, my comprehension of the intent realm of heaven and earth will be much faster. Only then will I be able to catch up to the sacred planet.</p><p>Lu Ming was deep in thought.</p><p>To be honest, Lu Ming was under a lot of pressure too. The main reason was that the time was too short. He only had half a year.</p><p>in half a year, I must defeat the sacred constellation. If I can’t defeat the sacred constellation, how can I fight against Martial Emperor Di Yi in the future? ”</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists tightly, his gaze determined.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took out the path-understanding ancient tree and placed it by his side. He then took out a fire-type profound meaning crystal.</p><p>He planned to improve his fire concept first.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming’s fire concept had reached the early stage of level one lower tier, which was only slightly weaker than the Thunder concept.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had three hundred and twenty fire-type esoteric crystals. He was also the fastest one to comprehend the concept of fire.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Lu Ming squeezed hard and crushed the fire-type esoteric crystal. Wisps of intent lingered around Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming closed his eyes and began to comprehend the concept of fire.</p><p>Originally, the intent realm of heaven and earth in this area was stronger than in the Dao Comprehension Palace.</p><p>Lu Ming’s comprehension of the concept of fire had reached a terrifying speed.</p><p>His comprehension of the fire concept had increased rapidly.</p><p>Kachaa! Kachaa!</p><p>A piece of fire-type esoteric crystal had been used up. Lu Ming crushed another one.</p><p>One piece after another.</p><p>A day had passed, and Lu Ming had consumed a total of twenty fire-type profound meaning crystals. Lu Ming’s fire concept had broken through in one fell swoop, reaching the middle stage of level one lower tier, catching up to the Thunder concept.</p><p>Fast, it was too fast.</p><p>A day’s time was equivalent to a year or even longer for others.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s injuries had already healed.</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming kept taking out fire-type ultimacy crystals and crushing them to continue his comprehension.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the three days he had agreed to meet with Mu Lan had already passed.</p><p>In less than three days, Lu Ming had consumed a total of sixty pieces of fire-type esoteric crystals.</p><p>Lu Ming’s comprehension of the concept of fire had already reached the peak of the middle stage of level one lower tier. He was just a step away from the late stage of level one lower tier.</p><p>The comprehension of concept became more and more difficult the further one went.</p><p>As long as his intent realm reached the later stage of level one lower tier, Lu Ming’s cultivation would be able to advance again and reach Lv 5 martial King realm.</p><p>If one’s intent didn’t improve, it would be difficult to improve one’s cultivation.</p><p>On this day, Mu Lan arrived at Lu Ming’s courtyard on time.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s go. I’ll bring you to the master of inscription!”</p><p>Mu Lan said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he was looking forward to it.</p><p>Mu Lan led Lu Ming deeper into the city.</p><p>There were very few pedestrians on the streets of the fourth area.</p><p>Presumably, he was either training outside or working hard to cultivate in seclusion.</p><p>Lu Ming followed Mu Lan and turned left and right before they arrived in front of a dilapidated stone house.</p><p>“This is the residence of that great master of inscription?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little surprised.</p><p>“Yes, this master has a strange temper, but he is a good friend of my father. He should agree to help you, right?”</p><p>Mu Lan said.</p><p>However, she didn’t sound very confident.</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but touch his nose.</p><p>The two of them walked into the stone house.</p><p>Inside was a small courtyard, but in the courtyard, there were piles of all kinds of scrap metal, like garbage.</p><p>uncle Huang, uncle Huang …</p><p>Mu Lan called out in a low voice.</p><p>“Who is it? You’ve come to disturb this old man’s dreams again!”</p><p>In the courtyard, an old voice suddenly rang out.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled. This voice seemed to ring in Lu Ming’s ears.</p><p>Lu Ming hurriedly turned around but did not see anyone.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming could not sense any aura at all.</p><p>“Uncle Huang, it’s me, Mu Lan. I need your help with something today.”</p><p>Mu Lan said in a sweet voice as her beautiful eyes looked around.</p><p>so it’s little LAN. Alright, I admit defeat. Tell me, what’s the matter? ”</p><p>The old voice sounded again.</p><p>“Uncle Huang, I’m looking for you today to help me forge a sixth level spiritual weapon spear!”</p><p>Mu Lan said.</p><p>“A level 6 spiritual spear? The little girl really dared to ask. Was she helping the young man beside her refine it? Alright, did you bring the crystals? Did you bring the materials?”</p><p>An old voice sounded.</p><p>“Senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists in the air and said, ” “I do have spiritual crystals, but I don’t have the materials to forge a sixth level spiritual weapon.”</p><p>“If you don’t have the materials to forge a sixth-level spiritual weapon, then fine. I’ll exchange them all with spiritual crystals. I’ll pay for the materials for you. It’ll be a total of five million spiritual crystals of the highest quality!”</p><p>An old voice sounded.</p><p>“Five … Five million Supreme spiritual crystals?”</p><p>Mu Lan’s eyes widened in shock.</p><p>“Uncle Huang, five million spiritual crystals of the best quality is too expensive. On the market, a sixth-level spiritual weapon is only worth a few hundred thousand spiritual crystals of the best quality!”</p><p>Mu Lan said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
