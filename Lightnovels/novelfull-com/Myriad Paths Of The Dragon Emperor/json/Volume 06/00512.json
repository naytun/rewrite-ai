In her opinion, this was only an exchange of benefits, even if the person she was engaged to was extremely outstanding.</p><p>Therefore, Mu Lan had left the profound sky sub-Palace a long time ago and ran to the mystical sword sect.</p><p>However, some time ago, because of Lu Ming, she had sent a message to her father and agreed to return to the Empyrean sky divine Palace on the condition that she would get an invitation card from Lu Ming.</p><p>Later on, the proud Son of Heaven of the Sheng family found out about this. That was why he sent people to the eastern Palace, which led to the conflict between Lu Ming and the Sheng family.</p><p>Lu Ming had a sudden realization after listening to it.</p><p>Combining what Yan LAN had told him back then, he now understood everything.</p><p>“AI, Senior Sister Mu Lan, why is she doing this? You actually ran away for my invitation.”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you don’t have to blame yourself. Actually, Mu Lan knows that she can’t hide. When the time comes, her father will definitely send someone to bring her back. In that case, why don’t I take the initiative to get you an invitation?”</p><p>Mu xiuyuan said.</p><p>However, Lu Ming still could not let it go. He frowned and said,”What do you want me to do? Only then can I help senior Sister Mu Lan?”</p><p>“It’s very difficult to help her!”</p><p>Mu Xiu Yuan sighed.</p><p>“Tell me, as long as it’s within my power, I’ll do my best!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>it’s simple. As long as you defeat the genius of the Sheng family that Mu Lan is engaged to, you’ll prove that you’re more talented than him. Then, things will naturally turn for the better!</p><p>Mu xiuyuan said.</p><p>“I just have to defeat the other party?” Lu Ming said, his spirits lifted.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s very difficult to defeat your opponent. Do you know who he is? He’s the once-in-a-century genius of the Sheng family, the genius of the Sheng family, Sheng Xingchen.”</p><p>Mu xiuyuan said.</p><p>“Oh? How strong is he?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>Mu xiuyuan didn’t answer, but muttered to himself for a moment, and then asked, ” “Lu Ming, do you know about the list of top 1000 talents in the eastern barren territory?”</p><p>the list of top 1000 talents in the eastern barren territory? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. This was the first time he had heard of it.</p><p>Mu xiuyuan’s hand moved, and a thick book appeared. On it were five large words: The list of top 1000 talents in the eastern barren territory.</p><p>the list of top 1000 talents in the eastern barren territory was written by the secret Chamber of Commerce, the No. 1 Chamber of Commerce in the continent!</p><p>the top 1000 talents of the younger generation under the age of 30 are listed here. This is the list of top 1000 talents in the East continent!</p><p>in the vast Eastern barren territory, there are countless regions, but only 1000 heaven’s favorites are listed. You can imagine that each of them is a terrifying genius!</p><p>“The Holy star is ranked 998th on the list of top 1000 talents in the eastern barren territory! He’s the only one in the Tianxuan region who’s ranked on the list of top 1000 talents in the eastern barren territory. His cultivation must have reached the upper tier of the king’s realm.”</p><p>Mu xiuyuan explained seriously.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He flipped to the last few pages of the list of top 1000 talents in the eastern barren territory and saw the name of the Holy star.</p><p>The cultivation level indicated on it was also at the upper tier of the king tier, but it did not state which martial King realm it was at.</p><p>“Is the list of top 1000 talents of the eastern barren territory accurate? The East continent is so big, and there are so many geniuses. Is it really possible to be ranked among them?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little puzzled.</p><p>Mu xiuyuan nodded and said, ” the Tianji Chamber of Commerce is the number one Chamber of Commerce on the continent. It’s extremely powerful and has branches all over the continent. It’s also the most well-informed. Although it can’t be 100% accurate, it’s close to the mark.</p><p>“The list of top 1000 talents?” Lu Ming nodded and muttered.</p><p>“That’s why it’s too difficult to defeat the sacred constellation!”</p><p>Mu xiuyuan sighed.</p><p>“I will definitely defeat him!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered in his heart but he did not say it out loud. Before he had the ability, he just had to keep it in his heart. If he said it out loud, he would be treated as a joke by others.</p><p>forget it, let’s not talk about this. Lu Ming, since you’ve just arrived at Tianxuan city, I’ll show you around. Tianxuan city is very different from other places.</p><p>Mu xiuyuan shook his head, as if he wanted to get rid of the troubles in his heart, and a smile appeared on his face.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming and mu xiuyuan headed toward Tianxuan city.</p><p>As soon as he entered Tianxuan city, Lu Ming saw layers of houses. The houses were pitch-black and built with a kind of black stone. They were filled with a primitive and ancient aura.</p><p>Most of these houses had been preserved from the ancient times along with Tianxuan city.</p><p>such dense spiritual Qi of heaven and earth. And, is that the essence realm of heaven and earth? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed and he looked shocked.</p><p>The heaven and earth spiritual Qi in Tianxuan city was much denser than in the eastern Palace. Moreover, the faint will of heaven and earth permeated the air, which surprised Lu Ming.</p><p>Cultivating here would allow one to comprehend the essence realm of heaven and earth much faster than in the outside world.</p><p>Mu xiuyuan smiled and said, ” Tianxuan city is built on top of a supermassive eye of spirit Qi and a Dao eye. It’s filled with rich spirit Qi of heaven and earth, as well as a strong will of heaven and earth. This is only the outer area of Tianxuan city. The deeper you go, the richer and stronger the spirit Qi and will of heaven and earth will be!</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Then, the two of them walked along the street toward the depths of Tianxuan city.</p><p>Along the way, Lu Ming’s eyes swept around.</p><p>There was not a single shop on both sides of the street. Lu Ming was secretly amazed.</p><p>This was the first time Lu Ming saw no shops in the city.</p><p>Mu xiuyuan seemed to have read Lu Ming’s mind. He smiled and said, Tianxuan city is different from other cities. Every inch of land in Tianxuan city is worth its weight in gold. Every mansion and room is a sacred cultivation ground. Therefore, most of the Emperor sky divine guards have to rent a house to live in Tianxuan city!</p><p>“Rent an apartment?”</p><p>Lu Ming was very surprised.</p><p>that’s right, rent a house to live in. The entire Tianxuan city is divided into four districts. The outermost ring is the first District. Generally, renting a house costs between 100000 to 1000000 lower spiritual crystals a day. Most of the houses here are rented and lived by martial arts Grandmaster realm Warriors!</p><p>go further in and enter the second area. The spiritual Qi and the essence realm of heaven and earth are more concentrated, and the rent is also much higher. One needs to rent between one to ten Supreme spiritual crystals for one day!</p><p>the rent for the third area is between 10 to 100 top-grade spiritual crystals for one day!</p><p>Mu xiuyuan explained.</p><p>Silk banner</p><p>Lu Ming gasped in shock.</p><p>This price was too expensive, it was outrageously expensive.</p><p>The Dao enlightenment Palace in the eastern sub-Palace only cost 100 Supreme spiritual crystals for a day of cultivation. However, the most expensive price on the third floor was 100 Supreme spiritual crystals for a day.</p><p>“What about the fourth region?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>If the third region was already so terrifying, how many spiritual crystals would the fourth region require?</p><p>Mu xiuyuan shook his head and said, ” the fourth region is usually not rented out. It’s occupied by some of the higher-ups of the MU clan and the Sheng clan, as well as some of the elite disciples. In addition, some of the higher-ups of the profound sky sub-Palace also live there. If ordinary Emperor sky divine guards want to rent the fourth region, not only will the rent be terrifying, but they will also have to meet special conditions.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
