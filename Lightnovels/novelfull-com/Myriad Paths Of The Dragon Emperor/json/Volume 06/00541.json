They felt that the battle was about to end.</p><p>...</p><p>At this moment, a cold voice came from the distance.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you dare?”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, a beam of divine light shot over from the distance.</p><p>The speed of the divine light was too fast. It crossed the void in an instant and shot towards the space between Lu Ming’s eyebrows.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed drastically. He could sense that this beam of divine light contained a terrifying power and killing intent.</p><p>His body instantly tensed up, and all the hair on his body stood on end. This was an instinctive reaction. He felt a fatal threat from this divine light.</p><p>Without any hesitation, he retreated. At the same time, his nine Dragon bloodline burst out, and the devouring power filled the surroundings.</p><p>The vital essence in his body circulated to the extreme, and the three heaven and earth will realms merged together and surged toward the spear.</p><p>“True dragon Strike!”</p><p>He thrust his spear forward, and a huge three-colored true dragon flew out and collided with the divine light.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A heaven-shaking boom rang out as the divine light pierced through the three-colored true dragon. The three intents of heaven and earth that it contained also collapsed.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The divine light did not stop and continued to stab Lu Ming.</p><p>“Gokudo path attack!”</p><p>At the critical moment, Lu Ming stopped his retreat. He became one with the spear and turned into a spear ray, piercing forward.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The tip of the spear accurately pierced the divine light.</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming felt a terrifying force surging towards him along the long spear. Lu Ming felt as if he had been hit by a huge hammer. His body slid back along the fighting ring in a frenzy.</p><p>It kept sliding for several miles before it stopped.</p><p>He only felt the blood in his entire body surging, and the arm holding the spear trembled slightly.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>At this moment, the tip of the demon subduing spear made a cracking sound and cracks appeared on it. Then, the cracks grew more and more. Finally, with a bang, the tip of the demon subduing spear exploded into pieces and scattered on the ground.</p><p>The demon subduing spear finally could not withstand Lu Ming’s powerful strength and the bombardment of the divine light. It exploded.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had successfully blocked the divine light.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked in the direction of the divine light.</p><p>Not only him, at this moment, everyone also looked in that direction.</p><p>A slender figure wearing a seven-star robe with his hands behind his back was approaching step by step.</p><p>Everyone’s hearts trembled. Tianxuan city had a no-fly zone, so ordinary Kings couldn’t walk in the air. Only peak-tier Kings could barely walk in the air.</p><p>This person was very young, about twenty-four or twenty-five years old. His eyebrows were like swords, his eyes were like stars, and he was extremely handsome.</p><p>The light of the stars surrounded his body, making him look like a god who had descended to the world.</p><p>“The sacred constellation, it’s the sacred constellation!”</p><p>Someone roared.</p><p>“It’s over. Lu Ming is finished. I didn’t expect that the sacred constellation would be attracted here. This time, Lu Ming is really finished.”</p><p>“Heavens, the sacred constellation’s cultivation seems to have improved. He can actually walk in the air. Could he have already broken through to the peak King tier?”</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>A peak-tier King at such a young age was simply too shocking.</p><p>that’s not right. The sacred constellation has not broken through to peak King tier. It should still be at the peak of the ninth level martial King realm, still at the level of a King tier of the upper tier. However, his strength is too strong, no weaker than a peak King tier. That’s why he can walk in the air!</p><p>A white-haired old man explained.</p><p>At the scene, there were other elders besides the elders from shengyao. This white-haired old man was one of them.</p><p>“Oh? So that’s how it is, that’s still amazing!”</p><p>The others sighed.</p><p>How old was the sacred constellation? He was only twenty-five years old, but he was already at the peak Lv 9 martial King realm. Did that mean that he had the chance to open the spiritual ocean and become a mighty warrior before the age of thirty?</p><p>Countless gazes were fixed on the young man in the sky.</p><p>“Holy star!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were bright as he stared at the sacred constellation.</p><p>Ever since he came to Tianxuan city, Lu Ming had heard this name many times.</p><p>Saint Xingchen, the number one genius of the Tianxuan region and a top talent on the list of top 1000 talents in the eastern barren territory, was the idol of many young geniuses in the Tianxuan region.</p><p>The other so-called geniuses of the Tianxuan region were like candlelight and the bright moon in front of the Holy star. They couldn’t be compared.</p><p>The Holy star stepped on the air and came to the sky above the divine Guard fighting ring. It looked down at Lu Ming, and in its eyes, there seemed to be stars shining.</p><p>“Young master Xingchen!”</p><p>When Sheng Chong, Sheng lang, and the rest saw Lu Ming, they hurriedly saluted him. Their faces were filled with apprehension, as if they were very afraid of the Holy star.</p><p>The sacred constellation was the successor of the Sheng family. In the future, he would definitely be in charge of the Sheng family. It could be said that their fates were all under the control of the sacred constellation.</p><p>They were naturally afraid of the Holy star.</p><p>Holy constellation only glanced at them indifferently, expressionless, and said indifferently, ” “All of you, retreat and recuperate!”</p><p>“Yes, yes!”</p><p>Sheng Chong and the rest helped each other down the fighting ring as if they had been granted Amnesty.</p><p>After that, the Holy star’s gaze turned to Lu Ming again.</p><p>you’re Lu Ming. You’ve got guts to hurt so many people from the Sheng family!</p><p>Saint Xingchen said indifferently. No emotions could be heard in his voice.</p><p>“It’s just a fair fight on the divine Guard battle platform!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Sheng Xingchen chuckled and said, ” you’re not bad. I just happen to need a stableman to lead the horses. You can report to work as a stableman for three years first. If you perform well, you’ll naturally be promoted!</p><p>Saint Starlight stood in the air with his hands behind his back. His voice wasn’t loud, but it was filled with a commanding tone, as if this matter had already been decided.</p><p>Many people in the surroundings were shocked.</p><p>They had never expected that the sacred constellation would let Lu Ming off so easily.</p><p>He even asked Lu Ming to be his groom.</p><p>In the eyes of many people, being able to become a coachman for the Holy constellation was a matter of Supreme glory. He was a trusted aide of the Holy constellation, and his status would rise with the tide. A casual word from him would cause many emperors of large countries to be in fear and Revere.</p><p>Moreover, he might even receive guidance from the Holy star. What an honor this was?</p><p>In the eyes of many, this was not a punishment, but a reward.</p><p>“It seems that Lu Ming’s talent has been valued by the Holy star!”</p><p>Someone sighed.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Sheng Wushuang gritted his teeth. He was extremely jealous of Lu Ming. If this opportunity were to fall into his hands, he would wake up smiling even in his dreams.</p><p>Now, this opportunity fell on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Do you think Lu Ming will agree?”</p><p>Someone asked in low voice.</p><p>“Nonsense, of course he’d agree. Who’s the Holy star? Lu Ming is a genius on the list of top 1000 talents. Although he’s very talented, I estimate that there’s still a huge gap between him and the Holy star. It’s not bad that he can become a groom for the Holy star!”</p><p>that’s right. If he didn’t agree, the Holy constellation definitely wouldn’t let him off. In such a situation, he would definitely agree!</p><p>“That’s right, being a stableman for the Holy constellation isn’t something to be ashamed of!”</p><p>Many people in the surroundings were making guesses out of curiosity.</p><p>However, no one noticed that the corners of Lu Ming’s mouth curled into a disdainful smile.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
