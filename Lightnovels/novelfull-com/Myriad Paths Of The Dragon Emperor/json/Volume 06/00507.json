Lu Ming saw that his face was already smashed to pieces. His facial features were completely deformed and had rotted into a mess. Even his head had almost exploded.</p><p>If it wasn’t for the fact that lower tier King tiers had extremely strong vitality, an ordinary person would have already lost their life from this injury.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the nine refined corpses of the lower tier King level cultivators had arrived. Some of the chains were flying towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, run! I’ll stop them!”</p><p>Zhuang Hong appeared in front of the nine refined corpses and shouted.</p><p>“Old Zhuang, let’s go together!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>let’s go together. No one can escape. You should leave quickly. We’ve been betrayed this time. Someone must escape, find the mastermind, and take revenge for us!</p><p>Zhuang Hong roared.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Immediately after, the true energy within Zhuang Hong’s body began to surge.</p><p>it’s this move again. Damn it, move aside and kill the others!</p><p>“Damn it, Dodge!”</p><p>The corpse guards all roared.</p><p>“Lu Ming, find the mastermind and take revenge for us!”</p><p>These were Zhuang Hong’s last words. As soon as he finished speaking, there was a huge explosion. Zhuang Hong had self-destructed.</p><p>The terrifying energy swept in all directions, and the corpse guards retreated.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Amidst the violent energy waves, a storage ring flew toward Lu Ming.</p><p>It was Zhuang Hong’s storage ring.</p><p>It was obvious that even if Zhuang Hong were to die, he would not want to let the heavenly corpse sect benefit.</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out his hand and grabbed Zhuang Hong’s storage ring.</p><p>die! Those from the heavenly corpse sect must die! The mastermind must die too! I, Lu Ming, swear that I will avenge you!</p><p>Lu Ming roared in his heart, bursting with an intense killing intent.</p><p>Not long ago, Zhuang Hong, this straightforward and burly man, had been drinking and eating with him. Now, he had died a tragic death, not even leaving behind a corpse.</p><p>Lu Ming’s killing intent soared to the sky.</p><p>“Dandan!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted again.</p><p>Dandan trembled slightly and rushed out again, smashing towards the corpse guard whose face had already been smashed.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>This time, it was even worse. That corpse guard was almost smashed to death.</p><p>“Gokudo path attack!”</p><p>Lu Ming turned into a ray of spear light and disappeared in a flash. The corpse guard did not have time to react and was killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>A lower tier King tier had died just like that.</p><p>With the corpse guard dead, there was no longer any obstacle in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming rushed over and devoured the other party’s blood essence. At the same time, he took the storage ring.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a few Ditian divine guards also took the opportunity to rush out and run away.</p><p>“Chase them, don’t let a single one of them escape!”</p><p>A corpse guard roared.</p><p>Nearly a hundred corpse guards took the refined corpses and split into several groups as they chased after the DI Tian divine guards.</p><p>“Brat, die!”</p><p>There were also some corpse guards who hid behind the refined corpses and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Heavenly corpse sect, I’ll remember this!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He then turned around and stepped out.</p><p>Nine Dragons heaven stomping steps!</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Using the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps, Lu Ming’s speed was so fast that he disappeared into the distance in an instant. No matter how the corpse guards chased, they couldn’t catch up.</p><p>“Damn it, this brat got away!”</p><p>A corpse guard unwillingly shouted.</p><p>“Let’s go after the others. We can’t let more people escape.”</p><p>Immediately after, these corpse guards all chased in several other directions.</p><p>Lu Ming cast the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps and moved at a terrifying speed. It did not take long for him to appear a hundred thousand miles away.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>He rushed into a mountain forest, his eyes extremely cold.</p><p>This time, it was too tragic. They had 50 people, and almost all of them were annihilated. In the end, only a few people managed to escape.</p><p>The fate of those few people was also unpredictable, because most of them were injured and might not be able to escape the pursuit of the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming had to thank dandan. Otherwise, he might not have been able to break out of the encirclement. He also had to rely on the extreme speed of the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps to escape from the heavenly corpse sect’s pursuit.</p><p>heavenly corpse sect, we’ll have to settle this score sooner or later. Also, that mastermind behind the scenes!</p><p>“Who’s the one who betrayed us? Is it the Sheng family?”</p><p>Lu Ming kept thinking in his heart.</p><p>Currently, the Sheng family was the most suspicious.</p><p>After a moment, Lu Ming had an idea and appeared in the Supreme shrine.</p><p>Then, he began to refine the blood essence.</p><p>The corpse guard was a Lv 4 martial King realm King, a King tier with rich blood essence.</p><p>Lu Ming used all of it to improve his nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>Unfortunately, after the blood essence was completely refined, the nine Dragon bloodline was still at the sixth level of the king tier.</p><p>it seems that it’s too difficult to advance to the seventh level of the king tier!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>Up until now, he had never seen anyone with a seventh level King bloodline other than Xie nianqing.</p><p>No matter if you were a genius or a demon, you were still a sixth level King. This was the highest level.</p><p>It seemed that there was a gap between the sixth and seventh level of the king level.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment. He then moved his fingers and a few storage rings appeared in his palm.</p><p>Two of them belonged to the corpse guards that Lu Ming had killed and one belonged to Zhuang Hong.</p><p>old Zhuang, I wonder if you have any relatives. When I return to the eastern Palace, I’ll definitely give your storage ring to your relatives!</p><p>Lu Ming moved his hand and kept Zhuang Hong’s storage ring. He then checked the storage rings of the two corpse guards.</p><p>The two corpse guards, one at the level three martial King realm and the other at the level four lower tier King realm, had a lot of wealth in their storage rings.</p><p>There were five to six secret manuals, one of which was specifically on how to refine corpses.</p><p>Lu Ming casually flipped through it and put it away.</p><p>What Lu Ming valued the most were the top-grade spiritual crystals. The two storage rings added up to a total of 180000 pieces.</p><p>This was already considered quite a lot.</p><p>As for the ultimacy crystals, there was not a single one. Lu Ming was a little disappointed.</p><p>After packing up, Lu Ming waved his hand and a total of 20000 pieces of top-grade spiritual crystals floated in the air.</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to continue to improve his cultivation.</p><p>His cultivation base was still too weak.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current combat strength, he could definitely crush anyone in the cloud Emperor mountain range. No one could withstand one move from him.</p><p>However, that was only in the cloud Emperor mountain range. In a bigger stage, such as the entire Tianxuan region, it was not enough.</p><p>For example, if Lu Ming had the cultivation of a lower tier King, Zhuang Hong and the rest would not have died and they would not have been nearly annihilated.</p><p>Strength, strength was Supreme!</p><p>Moreover, the heavenly profound region was only a small region among the many territories under the control of the entire empyrean heaven divine Palace.</p><p>The Empyrean heaven divine Palace was only one of the four strongest forces in the eastern barren territory.</p><p>The divine wilderness continent was divided into central continent, Eastern wilderness, Southern nether, Western Desert and Northern Plains.</p><p>The eastern barren territory was just one of the five vast regions of the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current location could only be said to be a corner of the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The 20,000 pieces of Supreme-grade spirit crystals exploded one after another. The nine Dragon bloodline opened its mouth and sucked in a huge amount of heaven and earth spiritual Qi. Then, it began to refine them crazily.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
