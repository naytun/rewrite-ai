They couldn’t get out at all. They were attracted by the sky Gate and slowly flew toward it.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The experts of the heavenly corpse sect tried to control the flood Dragon’s corpse to fly out, but it was useless and ineffective. It was also attracted by the sky Gate.</p><p>This time, not only did the Heaven’s Gate not erupt with any treasures, but it was also going to suck them in.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At this moment, the ancient desolate city started to shake violently.</p><p>Everyone was shocked to find that the ancient barren city had actually left the ground and was also flying toward the heavenly gate.</p><p>The entire ancient desolate city was about to be sucked away. It was too shocking.</p><p>“How could this be? How did this happen?”</p><p>At the entrance of the desolate ancient tomb, the old corpse guard screamed repeatedly.</p><p>They had just opened the door of the desolate ancient tomb, and this scene had appeared. It was completely different from the rumors.</p><p>However, no matter how much they struggled, it was useless. They continued to approach the sky Gate.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>All of a sudden, the gravitational force in the sky Gate exploded violently and instantly increased by dozens of times.</p><p>Lu Ming felt an irresistible force pulling him toward the Heaven’s Gate.</p><p>On the side, profound fragrance also followed.</p><p>Everyone, including the entire city of desolation, flew toward the heaven Gate at top speed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>When Lu Ming flew into the sky Gate, he felt that the world was spinning. His vision turned black and he did not know anything.</p><p>He seemed to be drifting in the endless darkness. After an unknown period of time, Lu Ming woke up and a ray of sunlight pierced his eyes.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming got up abruptly and realized that he was lying in a forest.</p><p>“Where is this place?”</p><p>Lu Ming hurriedly looked around.</p><p>There was no one in the surroundings, and profound fragrance was not by his side. All around him were huge ancient trees.</p><p>However, the ancient trees around him were simply too huge. The thousand-year-old trees he had seen before were nothing compared to the trees in front of him.</p><p>Here, any random ancient tree had a diameter of more than ten meters. They were incomparably huge and shot straight into the sky, covering the sun.</p><p>“What is this place? Could it be the world inside the heaven Gate?”</p><p>Lu Min pondered.</p><p>hmm, what dense spiritual Qi of heaven and earth!</p><p>Lu Ming realized that the heaven and earth Spirit Qi here was extremely rich. Even if it was not as rich as Tianxuan city, it was not much different.</p><p>One must know that Tianxuan city was built on top of a super large spiritual eye.</p><p>“I don’t care anymore, let’s go find Xuan Xiang and the others!”</p><p>Lu Ming rose into the air and observed his surroundings.</p><p>At a glance, there were ancient trees like this all around, extending to the end of the sky.</p><p>Lu Ming randomly chose a direction and flew forward.</p><p>Gah!</p><p>Lu Ming had not even flown a hundred miles when he let out a shrill cry. Above him, a huge wave of demonic Qi pressed down on Lu Ming. A huge bird pounced at him.</p><p>“What a big Bird!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked up and was shocked. The huge bird’s wingspan was at least fifty meters wide. Its huge claws, which were emitting a metallic luster, were grabbing at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming did not dare to be careless. The wind and thunder spear appeared and he used all his strength to strike the giant bird’s claw.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The sound of metal clashing rang out. Sparks flew in all directions at the point of collision between the wind Lightning Spear and The Giant Claw. Lu Ming felt a force as heavy as a mountain surging towards him. His body could not help but fall rapidly.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Lu Ming’s toes stepped on a branch. A huge force was directed from his toes to the big tree below.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The big tree exploded, and broken wood pieces flew everywhere.</p><p>“This Big Bird is so powerful!”</p><p>Lu Ming could sense that the bird’s level was only equivalent to a peak Lv 6 martial King, but its explosive power was not any weaker than his.</p><p>could this be a mutant with the bloodline of an ancient divine beast or ferocious beast? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>Many demonic beasts had the bloodlines of ancient divine beasts and ferocious beasts. They were extremely powerful and far stronger than demonic beasts of the same level.</p><p>For example, flood Dragons were a typical example. They had the bloodline of true dragons and were extremely powerful.</p><p>Any random flood Dragon had the strength of a martial King.</p><p>The strong ones were even more terrifying.</p><p>Gah!</p><p>The giant bird seemed to be angry that it did not manage to kill Lu Ming with one blow. It screeched and flapped its wings, causing a hurricane to sweep over and pounce on Lu Ming again.</p><p>“You’re looking for death, Gokudo path attack!”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The spear radiance pierced through the void and headed toward the giant bird.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a loud boom, blood splattered everywhere.</p><p>The spear pierced through one of the giant bird’s feet.</p><p>The giant bird was in pain and let out an angry screech. It flapped its wings rapidly and flew into the distance. It had actually escaped.</p><p>this giant bird is definitely a mutant. It’s really powerful. It’s only at Lv 6 martial King realm, but it’s only slightly injured by my Gokudo attack.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>Previously, no one below the level of a King tier could withstand Lu Ming’s extreme path attack. They were all killed by this attack.</p><p>This giant bird, on the other hand, only suffered minor injuries.</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was pondering, a shocking scene appeared.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>From the forest below the giant bird, two extremely large tentacles suddenly stretched out and wrapped around the giant bird.</p><p>The giant bird screamed in fear, but it was useless. It was pulled down, and the next moment, the cry stopped.</p><p>“This … What kind of monster is this?”</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Before Lu Ming could calm down, a deafening roar was heard from afar. Then, Lu Ming saw a black dot that was rushing toward them.</p><p>The black dot rapidly enlarged. It was actually an incomparably huge giant ape.</p><p>The giant ape was definitely over two hundred meters tall, like a mountain.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The giant ape stomped on the ground, causing the earth to shake in a terrifying manner. Waves of air rolled in all directions, and ancient trees exploded one after another, splattering wood fragments everywhere.</p><p>The giant ape grabbed with both hands and pulled out a giant octopus from the forest.</p><p>It was obvious that this was the octopus that had killed the giant bird.</p><p>He squeezed the octopus to death, then opened his mouth and bit off one of its tentacles. He chewed a few times and swallowed it.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The giant ape let out a deafening roar and stomped on the ground, causing the earth to rumble. The giant ape’s body shot into the distance like a cannonball, turning into a black dot and disappearing.</p><p>“Nest, nest, what the hell is this place?”</p><p>Lu Ming restrained his aura and hid between the branches of a big tree in the distance. He was drenched in cold sweat.</p><p>That giant ape from before was too powerful, and was infinitely close to the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>He had even reached the spirit sea realm.</p><p>With such power, he was already the peak Overlord in the Tianxuan region.</p><p>it seems like I should keep a low profile in this place. Otherwise, I won’t even know how I died.</p><p>Lu Ming landed on the ground and concealed his aura. He chose a direction and ran carefully.</p><p>Flying in the sky, wasn’t that courting death? If they were discovered by a powerful demonic beast, they wouldn’t even be enough to fill the gaps between their teeth.</p><p>As expected, there were countless powerful demonic beasts living in this land.</p><p>After traveling for about a thousand miles, Lu Ming encountered more than a dozen powerful demonic beasts. None of them were below the rank of a martial King. There were two that were not weaker than the giant ape from before.</p><p>“That’s … An intent crystal pit?”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming stopped. There was a strong intent realm of heaven and earth in front of him. Lu Ming realized that it was a profound meaning crystal pit.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
