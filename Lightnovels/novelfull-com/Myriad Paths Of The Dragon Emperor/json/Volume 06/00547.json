It just so happens that I’ve done the sect master a favor. You just have to go to the weapon forging sect and tell him that I asked you to go. The sect master will definitely give you a piece of thousand refined blood gold.</p><p>...</p><p>The old man explained.</p><p>“Oh? You’re in the weapon forging sect?”</p><p>Mu Lan nodded.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll make a trip there.”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“Little guy, take this small tower. It’s this old man’s token. This old man’s name is yellow tower. You can just call me old Huang in the future.”</p><p>The old man took out a small tower the size of a fist and threw it to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Yes, elder Huang!”</p><p>After Lu Ming kept it, his eyes flickered and he said,”Elder Huang, there’s one more thing I need your help with.”</p><p>“What is it? Speak, as long as this old man can do it, I will definitely help!”</p><p>Elder Huang laughed. He was in a good mood after getting the broken spear. In his eyes, Lu Ming was extremely cute.</p><p>A longsword appeared in Lu Ming’s hand. This longsword was very ordinary. It was only a second-level spirit weapon. It was the sky Star sword that his father had left him.</p><p>Lu Yuntian had said that the Heavenly Star sword contained the secret of the Martial Emperor’s treasure. However, there were inscriptions on the Heavenly Star sword. If the Heavenly Star sword was broken by force, the secret within would also disappear.</p><p>He needed to unlock the inscription before he could open the star sword.</p><p>In the past, Lu Ming had never looked for an inscription master to open the Heavenly Star sword, mainly because he felt that his cultivation level was too weak. The Martial Emperor’s treasure was a treasure left behind by a Martial Emperor. Without his cultivation level, even if the Martial Emperor’s treasure was placed in front of him, he would not be able to obtain it.</p><p>With his previous cultivation, if he really entered the Martial Emperor’s treasure, he would probably be killed by any danger.</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was very clear. He would not be so hot-headed as to search for the Martial Emperor’s treasure the moment he heard about it.</p><p>But now, he had an idea.</p><p>Even if he didn’t go now, he would first take a look at the secret of the Martial Emperor’s treasure and its rough location so that he could be prepared.</p><p>“Elder Huang, there is something hidden in this sword, but the sword is protected by inscriptions. I would like to ask elder Huang to remove the inscriptions on the sword.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Oh, that’s easy!”</p><p>Elder Huang took the Heavenly Star sword and looked at it. “This is just a low-level inscription, easy!”</p><p>Then, elder Huang’s palms glowed, and inscriptions glowed on his palms. He brushed them across the Heavenly Star sword, and the inscriptions on the sword appeared and then collapsed.</p><p>“Alright, the inscription has been broken, take it!”</p><p>Elder Huang returned the Heavenly Star sword to Lu Ming.</p><p>As for what was hidden in the Heavenly Star sword, old Huang had no interest in knowing at all.</p><p>Lu Ming took the star sword and was secretly amazed. The means of a level-six Alchemist were truly mysterious and unpredictable.</p><p>“Elder Huang, I would like to buy a level 5 spear. Do you have it?”</p><p>Currently, Lu Ming did not have any Spears that were of great use. Before the level-six spear was refined, he could only purchase a level-five spear.</p><p>“I do have a few Level 5 ones!”</p><p>A dark purple spear appeared in elder Huang’s hand. “This wind Lightning Spear is the highest grade among the fifth level spiritual weapons. Take it, it’s my gift to you.”</p><p>Elder Huang threw the long spear to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Wind Lightning Spear!”</p><p>Lu Ming took it and shook it slightly.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The spear trembled, causing the space to tremble slightly.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. This wind Lightning Spear was much better than the demon subduing spear. It was enough for the time being.</p><p>Lu Ming kept it and expressed his gratitude to elder Huang.</p><p>“Go and get the thousand-refined blood gold as soon as possible. I’ll help you forge a spear as soon as possible!”</p><p>Old Huang waved his hand as he stared at the broken spear.</p><p>Lu Ming and Mu Lan left elder Huang’s stone house.</p><p>“Lu Ming, the weapon forging sect is extremely far away from Tianxuan city. It’s in the North of Tianxuan region. I heard that the battle between the Empyrean Heavenly Divine Palace and the heavenly corpse sect is the most intense there. You must be careful when you go!”</p><p>Mu Lan warned, feeling a little worried.</p><p>“Don’t worry, Senior Sister Mu Lan. I’m only going to get the thousand-refined blood gold. I won’t be joining the battle. Don’t worry,”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Oh, when do you plan to leave?”</p><p>Mu Lan asked.</p><p>“Half a month later!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Since elder Huang wanted to study the inscriptions on the broken spear, he would not be able to extract the infinite black Gold so quickly to help him refine the spear. Lu Ming had the wind Lightning Spear now and was not in a hurry.</p><p>Lu Ming planned to cultivate in Tianxuan city for a period of time and refine all the remaining fire-type ultimacy crystals before he set off for the weapon forging sect.</p><p>“Well, that’s good!”</p><p>Mu Lan nodded.</p><p>The two of them chatted as they walked. After a while, Mu Lan and Lu Ming bade farewell and went back first.</p><p>Lu Ming returned to the courtyard alone. The first thing he did when he returned was to take out the star sword.</p><p>Powerful essential core surged into the surface of the star sword. Lu Ming could sense that the center of the star sword was hollow and not solid.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>His true essence shook violently.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming’s essential core was so powerful, the star sword could not withstand it at all. It cracked and shattered into pieces with a bang. Something was exposed from the star sword.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils shrank when he saw the item inside the star sword. He was shocked.</p><p>The thing inside the Heavenly Star sword was actually a Jade sword. It was very small, about the length of a finger, and crystal clear.</p><p>Most importantly, Lu Ming had seen such a Jade sword before.</p><p>Back in the blazing sun Empire, in the ruins of the Dongyi tribe, Xie nianqing had once obtained a Jade sword that was exactly the same as the one in front of her. At that time, Lu Ming had offered to exchange it with her with a King’s storage ring, but Xie nianqing had disagreed.</p><p>The Jade sword that Xie nianqing obtained was exactly the same as the one in front of him. What was the relationship between the two Jade swords?</p><p>Could it be that Xie nianqing’s sword was also related to the Martial Emperor’s treasure?</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and kept thinking in his mind.</p><p>“How do I use this Jade sword?”</p><p>Lu Ming held it in his hand and played with it for a while. Then, he carefully injected his essential core into the Jade sword.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Jade sword trembled slightly. Then, inscriptions appeared on the surface of the sword. The inscriptions glowed and a painting appeared in the air.</p><p>To be more precise, it was a map with many routes marked on it.</p><p>On the side of the map, there was a line of words.</p><p>Lu Ming took a look and came to a realization.</p><p>It was indeed a map, and the Jade sword was the key to the Martial Emperor’s treasure.</p><p>The key was that there were nine keys to the Martial Emperor’s treasure.</p><p>The Martial Emperor’s treasure could only be opened after all Nine Swords were collected.</p><p>“Nine?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly.</p><p>“It seems that Xie nianqing’s key is most likely the key to the Martial Emperor’s treasure. But where are the other keys? Had it already fallen into someone else’s hands? How can we gather?”</p><p>Lu Ming kept thinking.</p><p>If he wanted to go to the Martial Emperor’s treasure, he didn’t know how long he would have to wait.</p><p>forget it. With my current cultivation, it’ll be dangerous for me to enter the Martial Emperor’s treasure. I’d better wait and see. Right now, cultivation is the most important thing.</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming carefully put away the Jade sword and adjusted his state of mind. Then, he began to cultivate diligently.</p><p>&Nbsp; he continued to use fire intent crystals to comprehend fire intent.</p><p>Lu Ming’s concept of fire had advanced by leaps and bounds.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
