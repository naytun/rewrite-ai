His heart was empty and his mind was clear. His comprehension speed was ten times faster than usual.</p><p>...</p><p>The faster the comprehension speed, the more intent threads he absorbed.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that his comprehension of the concept of fire had reached a limit.</p><p>“Condense!”</p><p>fire! he shouted in a low voice. A strong fire concept burst out from his body, making Lu Ming look like a Burning Man.</p><p>The next moment, the fire concept was completely retracted. It gathered in Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness and began to condense crazily.</p><p>At that moment, the Thunder runes and wind runes in his sea of consciousness trembled slightly. A wave of energy emanated and prevented Lu Ming from condensing the fire runes.</p><p>nothing can stop me. Condense!</p><p>Lu Ming growled.</p><p>&Nbsp; with the help of the middle-rank intent crystals and the path-understanding ancient tree, the fire intent symbol in his sea of consciousness began to condense with an unstoppable momentum.</p><p>A moment later, an inch-long intent symbol became fiery red and crystal clear as it floated in his sea of consciousness.</p><p>The fire concept rune was formed.</p><p>However, it did not stop.</p><p>The intent of heaven and earth contained in middle-grade intent crystals was too dense and strong.</p><p>The price of a middle-grade profound meaning crystal was a thousand times that of a low-grade profound meaning crystal. This was a clear sign.</p><p>At this moment, there were still many intent threads that were being absorbed by Lu Ming. In his sea of consciousness, the fire intent runes were slowly growing longer.</p><p>One inch, one inch, one inch two …</p><p>When a piece of fire-element middle-grade profound meaning crystal was completely consumed, Lu Ming’s fire-element concept rune had actually reached two inches in length.</p><p>First level intent realm initial completion.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually cultivated the concept of fire to level one lower tier in one go.</p><p>This was all thanks to the stacked effects of the path-understanding ancient tree. If it were anyone else, even if they had middle-grade intent crystals, they wouldn’t be able to achieve this effect.</p><p>first level lower tier fire concept. Let’s go and see its effects!</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a look of anticipation.</p><p>After leaving the Supreme shrine, Lu Ming flew into the sky.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As he cast the concept of fire, endless flames appeared out of thin air between the heaven and earth, gathering madly at Lu Ming’s palm. A fireball appeared in Lu Ming’s palm. It was so hot that it distorted the space.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, the fireball flew out and then exploded. The hot flames swept across the surrounding ten miles, as if a sun had exploded.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded in satisfaction.</p><p>now, all three intents have condensed into intent runes. How strong will the power of the fusion of three intents be? ”</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming’s heart burned with passion. The demon subduing spear appeared in his hand and he thrust the spear at a mountain peak that was thousands of meters away.</p><p>The three wills gathered and formed a spear light, which pierced toward the mountain.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming only heard a soft sound and then saw a big hole that was transparent on the mountainside of the ten-thousand-foot mountain.</p><p>A thousand-feet-tall mountain peak was pierced through by Lu Ming’s spear casually.</p><p>Lu Ming did not use any essential core in this shot. He purely relied on the power of his will.</p><p>“Strong, too strong.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that the power of the three concepts was terrifying when they were combined.</p><p>Lu Ming estimated that it was more powerful than cultivating a single concept to level one upper tier. It was close to the completion of level one concept.</p><p>In other words, the power of Lu Ming’s intent was already slightly stronger than the intent of an ordinary King at the phenomenal success stage.</p><p>it seems that the power of the fusion of three intents is indeed terrifying. If I’m not wrong, the power of the fusion of two level one elementary intents is comparable to the initial success of a single intent.</p><p>the power of the fusion of three level one intents is comparable to the completion of a single intent.</p><p>as for me, two of my will have reached the first level small accomplishment. If I combine three, its power will be close to the first level completion of a single will. When my wind will also breaks through the first level small accomplishment, the combination of three will will will be completely equivalent to the first level completion of a single will.</p><p>Lu Ming speculated in his heart.</p><p>The breakthrough in the fire concept had doubled Lu Ming’s combat strength.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming was confident that he could kill an early-stage Lv 6 martial King realm martial artist in one move without using the extreme blow.</p><p>Lu Ming could easily defeat and kill a peak Lv 6 martial King realm martial artist.</p><p>Of course, it was a different story for those peerless geniuses who could fight above their level.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming was not afraid of anyone below the level of a King tier.</p><p>Now, let’s go back to Tianxuan city.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>With a flash of light, he headed for the exit of the demonic scales dimension.</p><p>Half a day later, Lu Ming returned to the high wall and headed towards the exit.</p><p>Lu Ming returned to Tianxuan city two days later.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming came to the third area and walked into a huge mansion.</p><p>“Young master, do you want to rent a house? This place costs 100 top-grade spirit crystals a day.”</p><p>An old man asked.</p><p>“I’ll rent it for a month!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He took out three thousand best-grade spirit crystals and handed them to the old man.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The old man had a smile on his face as he passed Lu Ming a Jade tablet.</p><p>Lu Ming took the Jade card and walked into the room according to the number on the Jade card.</p><p>After closing the door, Lu Ming sat cross-legged.</p><p>as expected of a room that costs 100 top-grade spirit crystals. The essence realm of heaven and earth is extremely strong!</p><p>Lu Ming sensed the environment and thought to himself.</p><p>He realized that the essence realm here wasn’t as good as the Dao enlightenment Palace in the East, but it wasn’t too far off. The heaven and earth spiritual Qi here was also extremely dense, several times denser than the eastern sky courtyard he was staying in.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed inwardly. The powerhouses of the ancient era were indeed extraordinary. They could actually build an entire city into a cultivation sanctuary. It was truly terrifying.</p><p>“Now, let’s check it first!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and more than a hundred storage rings appeared on the ground.</p><p>They were all left behind by the geniuses of the Sheng family and the corpse guards of the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>Lu Ming was already very experienced and interested in counting his spoils of war. He immediately started counting them one by one.</p><p>He placed a block of Supreme grade spirit crystals, a block of spirit herbs and flowers, a block of forging materials and spirit weapons, and a block of cultivation technique manuals.</p><p>Also, place a piece of soul-sealing crystal.</p><p>In the end, all the top-grade crystals were listed.</p><p>8.66 million Supreme spiritual crystals.</p><p>After Lu Ming took a deep breath of cold air, he was overjoyed.</p><p>8.66 million Supreme spiritual crystals. Even an ordinary King level warrior wouldn’t have that much wealth.</p><p>It was probably comparable to the wealth of a peak-tier King.</p><p>In addition, the various materials, Ling weapons, and Ling grasses could also be worth a lot of Jingshi.</p><p>Unfortunately, Lu Ming could not find a suitable long spear among all the spirit weapons.</p><p>Now, an Ordinary Level five spear was no longer suitable for Lu Ming. He wanted to find an upper level five spear to use but unfortunately, he did not have one.</p><p>There were very few people who used Spears.</p><p>“If you have time, go buy one!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and then looked at the pile of soul-sealing crystals.</p><p>There were more than fifty pieces of soul-sealing crystals here. They were Lu Ming’s.</p><p>In addition, there were more than 60 pieces, which he had obtained from the storage rings of the Sheng family.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
