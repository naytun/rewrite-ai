I thought it would fall into the Qin clan’s hands.</p><p>it’s him again. It’s that young man in guest room number 10 again. Who is this person? not only does he oppose Qin qingfei time and time again, but he also has such strong financial resources.</p><p>The entire place was filled with discussions.</p><p>“Damn it, it’s that little bastard again!”</p><p>shut up! Qin qingfei shouted in anger. His eyes were filled with killing intent as he stared at the 10th vip room.</p><p>In guest Room No. 10, Fei Xue was also extremely curious.</p><p>Was Lu Ming really from the Tianxuan region? he had asked for more than 20 million Supreme spiritual crystals. Was the Tianxuan region that rich?</p><p>“This customer has bid 26 million, is there any higher bid? if not, this bottle of rare elixir of life will belong to this customer.”</p><p>Feng Xiu shouted.</p><p>“27 million!”</p><p>Qin qingfei roared.</p><p>“28 million!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate.</p><p>“29 million!”</p><p>“Thirty million!”</p><p>Lu Ming immediately raised the price to thirty million.</p><p>At that moment, there was no sound at all. Everyone was staring at Lu Ming and Qin qingfei bidding.</p><p>kid, let me tell you. This bottle of elixir of life is highly valued by the Qin family. You’ve been going against the Qin family time and time again. Are you looking for death? ”</p><p>Qin qingfei roared.</p><p>“Hehe, repeatedly going against your Qin family? I remember that I have never provoked you. Every time, it was you who provoked me first. Now, in your mouth, it has become me repeatedly opposing your Qin family?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered in response.</p><p>kid, if I say you’re in the wrong, you’re in the wrong. Now, stop the bidding. I bid 30.2 million!</p><p>Qin qingfei roared.</p><p>what a joke! 31 million!</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with him and continued to bid.</p><p>“Dammit, dammit! President Feng, I suspect that this person is raising the price randomly and doesn’t have that many top quality spirit crystals on him.”</p><p>Qin qingfei roared.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. This time, Qin qingfei was right. He did not have that many top-grade spirit crystals on him.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming did not say anything, Qin qingfei’s eyes lit up and he said in joy, ” “President Feng, did you see that? this person doesn’t dare to speak. I don’t think he has that many spiritual crystals. I suggest we check his spiritual crystals.”</p><p>if he doesn’t have that many spiritual crystals, he’s disrupting the order of the auction. He’ll be severely punished!</p><p>Feng Xiu’s gaze also looked towards vip room 10.</p><p>The secret Chamber of Commerce had a rule that if a bidder couldn’t take out enough Supreme spiritual crystals after bidding, it would be considered a disruption of the auction order and would be severely punished by the Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>Someone had once been crippled of his cultivation and even killed for disrupting the secret Chamber of Commerce’s auction.</p><p>By now, no one dared to bid recklessly anymore.</p><p>Lu Ming was the person who put up two thousand gold-element top-grade spirit crystals for auction. Feng Xiu had known about this long ago. Therefore, he thought that Lu Ming should have spirit crystals. However, Lu Ming’s silence now meant that there was a problem.</p><p>Lu Ming opened the window of the VIP room and everyone looked at him.</p><p>I … Indeed don’t have that many Supreme spiritual crystals!</p><p>Lu Ming spoke calmly.</p><p>The scene was in an uproar.</p><p>f * ck! He really doesn’t have that many crystals. It turns out that he’s just trying to get something for nothing!</p><p>How dare you! You’re trying to get something from the secret Chamber of Commerce for nothing! You’re simply courting death!</p><p>“Young man, you’re blinded by greed. You’re dead now!”</p><p>Many people sighed.</p><p>haha, this kid really doesn’t have any spiritual crystals. Haha!</p><p>Qin qingfei was overjoyed.</p><p>He had only said it casually in a fit of anger. He had never expected that Lu Ming would be so bold as to not have any top-grade spirit crystals.</p><p>“Brother Lu, you …! Hey, don’t admit it yet. I’ll think of a way to get you a batch of spiritual crystals!”</p><p>Fei Xue’s expression changed as she whispered.</p><p>“Lady flying snow, there’s no need.”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand, his expression still very calm.</p><p>“President Feng,” he looked at Feng Xiu and asked,”how many spiritual crystals do I have left after deducting the ones I won from the auction?”</p><p>Feng Xiu was slightly surprised. Her eyes flashed as she said, you’ve bid twice, so you’ve used up 1.6 million best-grade spirit crystals. The 2000 gold-element intent crystals you’ve sold come to a total of 9 million. After deducting the 5% handling fee, you have a total of 6.9 million spirit crystals left!</p><p>Everyone was stunned by his words.</p><p>“What? Those two thousand gold-attribute intent crystals were actually his?”</p><p>f * ck, I thought it was a senior who put it up for auction. It’s actually his.</p><p>how could he have so many intent crystals? ”</p><p>Everyone was surprised and curious.</p><p>However, the remaining six million or so spiritual crystals were not enough at all.</p><p>As for Qin qingfei, he was so angry that he almost vomited blood. Never in his wildest dreams would he have thought that the two thousand gold-attribute profound meaning crystals would actually belong to Lu Ming.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had deliberately raised the price so that he had to spend nine million to buy two thousand ultimacy crystals. At the thought of this, he was so angry that his chest hurt.</p><p>kid, so what if it’s yours? it’s far from 31 million. If you can’t take out so many Supreme spiritual crystals today, I’ll see how you die!</p><p>Qin qingfei gritted his teeth.</p><p>Fei Xue’s beautiful eyes flickered continuously as she looked at Lu Ming in surprise.</p><p>She did not expect that the two thousand gold-element ultimacy crystals actually belonged to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you bid 31 million. Can you take out 31 million best-grade spirit crystals?”</p><p>Qin qingfei shouted.</p><p>it’s true that I don’t have Supreme-grade spirit crystals, but I can use intent crystals to offset it!</p><p>Lu Ming’s calm voice was heard.</p><p>using intent crystals to offset it? what a joke. You’ve already taken out two thousand crystals. I don’t believe you still have more …</p><p>Qin qingfei continued to shout, but before he could finish, he was almost blinded by a golden light.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and a pile of ultimacy crystals appeared in the air. Each piece was shimmering with golden light and exuded a strong intent aura.</p><p>All of them were gold-attribute intent crystals.</p><p>“This … So many? They’re all gold-element intent crystals. How many are there?”</p><p>nest, did he get a large-scale power Upanishad crystal mine? ”</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>Many people stared at the pile of intent crystals in the air with burning eyes.</p><p>Qin qingfei’s eyes were wide open and his tongue was tied. He was dumbfounded and swallowed the words he wanted to say.</p><p>Fei Xue’s beautiful eyes flickered as she looked at Lu Ming, her eyes filled with curiosity.</p><p>here, there are five thousand gold-attribute intent crystals. I won’t auction them off. President Feng, I wonder if you’re willing to accept them? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said to Feng Xiu.</p><p>yes, of course. How about this? five thousand intent crystals. My heaven’s Secret Chamber of Commerce will buy all of them. The price …</p><p>Feng Xiu was overjoyed and was about to state the price.</p><p>“President Feng, wait a moment!”</p><p>Before Feng Xiu could state the price, Lu Ming spoke again and interrupted her.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Feng Xiu was a bit confused.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
