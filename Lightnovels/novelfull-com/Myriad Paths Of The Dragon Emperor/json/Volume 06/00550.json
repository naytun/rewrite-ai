Kill him!”</p><p>...</p><p>The old corpse guard waved his hand.</p><p>Immediately, a Lv 3 martial King realm corpse guard controlled a Lv 3 martial King realm refined corpse and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming lifted his leg and kicked the corpse guard, sending it flying at least a thousand meters away. It crashed into a cliff and almost shattered it. The corpse guard lay there, motionless.</p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded.</p><p>A Lv 3 martial King realm refined corpse had been crippled by Lu Ming’s kick. Was it still a refined corpse with copper skin and iron bones? When did he become so weak?</p><p>Lv 4 martial King realm. You’re at Lv 4 martial King realm.</p><p>That old corpse guard called out.</p><p>They were shocked to see that he had reached Lv 4 martial King realm at such a young age.</p><p>The eyes of the young woman and the others also lit up.</p><p>With the addition of a Lv 4 martial King realm lower tier, they might have a chance to escape.</p><p>“Little brother, come and help me. Let’s rush out together!”</p><p>The peak Lv 4 martial King realm man shouted.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not seem to hear it. He smiled faintly and said,”Why are you rushing out? It’ll be fine after we kill them!”</p><p>With that, Lu Ming walked towards the old corpse guard step by step.</p><p>“Little brat, so what if you’re a Lv 4 martial King? You want to kill me? in your dreams!”</p><p>The old corpse guard roared and immediately controlled a Lv 4 martial King realm corpse guard to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>Five to six pitch-black iron chains shot towards Lu Ming.</p><p>A faint smile hung on Lu Ming’s lips. He stretched out his hand and grabbed all five to six iron chains. Then, he activated the Thunder concept and his arm shook.</p><p>Zzzzzzz …</p><p>The power of the Thunderbolt followed the iron chain and headed toward the LV 4 martial King realm refined corpse.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The refined corpse was turned into charcoal by the power of lightning.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>This time, the old corpse Guard’s expression changed. His originally shriveled and pale face turned ashen, and his eyes flashed with horror.</p><p>How was it possible for him to defeat a Lv 4 martial King realm refined corpse so easily?</p><p>This young man’s combat strength was too strong.</p><p>The eyes of the young woman and the others lit up. Perhaps, they would be saved today.</p><p>“You’re the Ditian Divine Guard, you’re the genius of the Ditian Divine Guard!”</p><p>The old corpse guard shouted.</p><p>To have such cultivation and battle prowess at such a young age, he could only be a top genius among the Ditian divine guards.</p><p>“You’re right!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Hehehe, it’s worth it to be able to kill a genius of the Ditian Divine Guard today! Do it!”</p><p>The old corpse guard sneered and suddenly roared. His voice spread far and wide.</p><p>Hu! “Hu!”</p><p>In the next moment, from the East and West, there was a loud sound as coffins flew over.</p><p>There were more than 20 coffins on each side, and there were more than 50 coffins in total.</p><p>“Ambush, there’s an ambush!”</p><p>At this moment, the young woman’s group of six faces were as pale as paper and filled with despair.</p><p>“Young hero, leave quickly, don’t worry about us!”</p><p>The young woman shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. This young woman was kind.</p><p>However, this was within Lu Ming’s expectations.</p><p>more than fifty corpse guards. En, it’s a good thing I still have quite a few soul-sealing crystals on me. After I seal the soul and bring it back, those will all be rewards!</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>Sealing the souls of the heavenly corpse sect’s corpse guards and obtaining rewards wasn’t limited to the scaled demon plane.</p><p>It was the same in other places. As long as one killed a corpse guard, sealed its soul, and took it back, there would be a reward.</p><p>“Young hero, let’s go!”</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming was standing still, the young woman became anxious.</p><p>“It’s too late to leave now!”</p><p>The old corpse guard sneered.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>The coffins from two different directions flew over everyone’s heads. They formed a dark mass and blocked the sunlight from the sky.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming stomped on the ground and his figure soared into the sky.</p><p>“He’s trying to escape, stop him!”</p><p>The old corpse guard shouted.</p><p>A few iron chains flew out from one of the coffins and wrapped around Lu Ming. He waved his hand and sent them flying. Lu Ming then rushed into the sky.</p><p>“Escape? who’s escaping?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s calm voice was heard.</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming looked down from above and took a step forward.</p><p>After taking one step, he took another step.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming took three consecutive steps.</p><p>Nine Dragons heaven trampling steps, three steps in a row.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The entire world seemed to be about to explode as a terrifying power surged towards the coffins.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>More than 50 coffins exploded as if they were made of paper. One figure after another emerged from the coffins.</p><p>Some corpse guards with weaker cultivation had their bodies directly explode and died on the spot.</p><p>Some of the corpse guards with stronger cultivation also vomited large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>“Ten thousand Dragon kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear shook as the three concepts converged. At least a few hundred spear gleams shot out and turned into a few hundred three-colored true dragons that pounced at the corpse guards.</p><p>???!</p><p>Screams rang out continuously, regardless of whether they were at the second, third, or even fourth or fifth level martial King realm.</p><p>The three-colored true dragon tore his body apart, and his body fell to the ground like rain.</p><p>For a moment, only some of the stronger refined corpses stood in the sky, unmoving like wood.</p><p>More than fifty corpse guards were all killed in an instant.</p><p>Below, everyone was stunned. They stopped fighting and stared at the sky with all their might. They were completely petrified.</p><p>Heavens, more than 50 corpse guards, including more than a dozen Lv 4 and Lv 5 martial King corpse guards, were all killed in an instant.</p><p>Not a single one escaped.</p><p>What kind of combat strength was this? Could it be a late stage King tier?</p><p>But, such a young late stage King tier? How many were there in the Tianxuan region?</p><p>Everyone felt that their minds were a little confused.</p><p>“Ah, ah, monster, monster, run, run!”</p><p>After a while, the old corpse guard reacted and screamed in fear, frantically escaping to the side.</p><p>But-</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A ray of spear light descended from the sky and nailed him to the ground.</p><p>Whoosh … Whoosh …</p><p>Immediately after, Spears descended and nailed the other corpse guards to the ground, leaving no one alive.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming waved his hand and more than fifty soul-sealing crystals flew out, sealing the souls of all the corpse guards and putting them away.</p><p>“There are only these soul-sealing crystals left. If we kill more corpse guards, we won’t have any more soul-sealing crystals.”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>If he had known earlier, he would have bought more soul-sealing crystals and brought them with him.</p><p>After keeping it, Lu Ming moved and appeared beside the young woman and the rest.</p><p>“Greetings, Lord Divine Guard!”</p><p>Other than the lady, the rest of them quickly saluted Lu Ming.</p><p>Such a young and powerful Ditian Divine Guard must have an extraordinary status in the Ditian divine Palace. Thus, they were naturally very respectful.</p><p>there’s no need to be so polite, everyone. I just happened to pass by. The heavenly corpse sect and the Ditian divine guards are mortal enemies. Since I’ve seen them, I naturally won’t let them off!</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Lord Divine Guard, you’re so powerful. Your name is Xuan Xiang, I wonder what’s the name of Lord Divine Guard?”</p><p>The young woman’s eyes lit up as she looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>It was the first time she had seen such a young and powerful genius.</p><p>“I’m lu Ming!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
