He just went to hunt demonic beasts, what happened? What kind of danger did he encounter?”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>At this time, another scream was heard.</p><p>“It’s Zhao er. He’s also hunting demonic beasts!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Someone shouted. Then, seven or eight voices flew in that direction.</p><p>They stood in the air and looked down.</p><p>However, it was night time after all, and their vision was obstructed. They seemed to be unable to see clearly, so they flew down.</p><p>In the next moment, screams of pain were heard.</p><p>In just a few breaths, there was no more sound.</p><p>Seven to eight martial King powerhouses had just disappeared without a trace.</p><p>enemies! Gather together!</p><p>“Hurry up, don’t be defeated one by one!”</p><p>A few roars rang out. It was the other two lower tier King tiers.</p><p>Lu Ming and Zhuang Hong also gathered around the crowd.</p><p>Forty people were gathered together.</p><p>“What is there? Eight martial Kings were taken care of so quickly!”</p><p>Someone said in a serious tone.</p><p>Shasha</p><p>At this time, everyone heard a rustling sound. In the middle of the night, it was particularly horrifying.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>Everyone focused their attention and widened their eyes to observe their surroundings.</p><p>“Not good, it’s under my feet!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly shouted.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The others were stunned.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Suddenly, a pitch-black beast claw stretched out from beneath the foot of one of the Ditian divine guards and grabbed one of his feet.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>The Ditian Divine Guard roared in shock. His cultivation was at the mid-stage of the first level of the martial King realm. At this moment, he unleashed his full power and slashed at the beast’s claw.</p><p>But a shocking scene happened. When the saber hit the beast’s claw, it was as if it had hit some kind of extremely hard steel, and it made a sound of metal clashing.</p><p>He couldn’t cut it!</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A beast’s roar rang out from the ground. The beast’s claw pulled and one of the Ditian Divine Guard’s legs was torn off.</p><p>All of this happened in the time it took for a spark to fly off a Flint.</p><p>By the time the crowd reacted, the Ditian Divine Guard was already dead.</p><p>“What demonic beast? Die!”</p><p>At the side, a few Ditian divine guards roared loudly, and violent attacks bombarded the demonic beast.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a few explosions, a large pit was blasted out in that area, but there was no trace of the demonic beast.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Suddenly, another scream came from another direction. A first level martial King empyrean heaven Divine Guard was killed by a beast’s claw that had extended from the ground.</p><p>“What kind of demonic beast is this? Why can’t I feel any aura?”</p><p>Someone shouted in shock.</p><p>corpse, that’s a demonic beast’s corpse. There’s no life force at all!</p><p>Finally, someone discovered the truth.</p><p>“A demonic beast’s corpse?”</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>All of a sudden, a sharp air-piercing sound rang out. From all directions, black shadows shot towards them.</p><p>It was faster than a sharp arrow.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>With a loud roar, everyone burst out with powerful Zhen Yuan. Their bodies were filled with all kinds of light, and beams of light burst out.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>With a loud boom, the black shadows were sent flying back.</p><p>“Who’s that?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. He could clearly see that those black shadows were actually black chains.</p><p>“It’s the heavenly corpse sect!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>“What? The heavenly corpse sect? How did the heavenly corpse sect know that we are here?”</p><p>Someone cried out in disbelief.</p><p>Although their departure was not a secret, the route they were going to take first was very secretive, and not many people knew about it.</p><p>How did the heavenly corpse sect find them? Could it be a coincidence?</p><p>“Kaka, I didn’t expect that the people from the eastern part of the Tianxuan region could recognize us so quickly. This is really unexpected!”</p><p>A cold voice came from the forest in the distance.</p><p>Hu! Whoosh!</p><p>Then, everyone saw coffins flying out from the surrounding forest. These coffins were big and small. They floated in the air and blocked their way out.</p><p>There were at least a hundred of them.</p><p>Kachachi</p><p>The coffins opened, and figures walked out of them.</p><p>Refined corpses. The first to walk out were all refined corpses. Their faces were pale, and within the paleness, there was a hint of black.</p><p>His body was wrapped in black iron chains.</p><p>In addition to these human-shaped refined corpses, there were also beast-shaped ones.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A few Black Panther-like demonic beasts with red eyes and fangs in their mouths roared.</p><p>However, there was no sign of life on their bodies. They were also refined corpses.</p><p>Other than human corpses, the corpses of demonic beasts could also be refined into refined corpses.</p><p>Demonic beast-type refined corpses were known as demonic corpses.</p><p>It was obvious that this was the kind of demon corpse that had been hiding underground to launch a sneak attack.</p><p>Following closely behind these refined corpses were black-robed corpse guards with pale faces.</p><p>There were more than two hundred refined corpses and close to a hundred corpse guards.</p><p>hehe, it’s no wonder that we’ve been lying in ambush here for a few days. With fifty martial King corpses, we can refine fifty powerful refined corpses!</p><p>A corpse guard sneered.</p><p>“How is that possible? How did you know we would pass by here? How could you have set up an ambush in advance?”</p><p>One of the Ditian divine guards called out in disbelief.</p><p>“Hehe, you’re going to die soon anyway, so there’s no harm in telling you. Of course, someone informed us!”</p><p>A corpse guard sneered.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>There was a traitor. A traitor had leaked their information to the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>“Damn it, who is it?”</p><p>Someone roared.</p><p>“Could it be the Sheng family?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing.</p><p>His first suspicion was the Sheng family. The Sheng family knew that he was among this group of people and wanted to use the heavenly corpse sect to get rid of him.</p><p>However, was there a need to sacrifice the lives of the other forty-nine Ditian divine guards? This was too ruthless.</p><p>“Hehe, you can all go to hell!”</p><p>Close to a hundred corpse guards started to control the refined corpses.</p><p>More than 200 refined corpses were emitting a powerful aura.</p><p>King, these refined corpses were all King-level refined corpses.</p><p>Nine of them had extremely powerful auras, and they were actually at the level of lower tier King tiers.</p><p>Everyone’s expression changed.</p><p>This was a terrifying force. There were nine lower tier refined corpses, two hundred refined corpses from Lv 1 to Lv 3 martial King realm, and almost a hundred corpse guards.</p><p>The strength of this energy was several times that of Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>In order to deal with them, the heavenly corpse sect had actually dispatched so many experts.</p><p>This was a sure kill. Lu Ming and the rest did not even have the chance to escape. It was because it was impossible to escape in such a situation with such a great disparity in strength.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression turned extremely grave.</p><p>“Charge! Let’s work together and charge in one direction!”</p><p>Zhuang Hong roared as he led the charge towards the West.</p><p>“Charge, charge!”</p><p>The other two lower tier King tiers also rushed toward that direction together with Zhuang Hong.</p><p>The others also gathered together and attacked together.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
