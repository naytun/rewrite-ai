Other than him, no one had ever reached the seventh level of the king tier in the Tianxuan region.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons opened its mouth and sucked, and its devouring power erupted. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>my devouring power has doubled. Even late-stage King tiers would be affected if I use it now!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>As expected, the devouring power had greatly increased after his nine Dragon bloodline reached the seventh level of the king tier.</p><p>I wonder what kind of changes there will be after advancing to a divine bloodline? ”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>It was said that divine level bloodlines had unimaginable power, mysterious and terrifying.</p><p>Martial artists, after entering the spirit sea realm, would have a third chance to awaken their bloodline.</p><p>In a warrior’s life, he had three chances to awaken his bloodline.</p><p>However, not every warrior could awaken their bloodline three times.</p><p>The third bloodline awakening was completely different from the previous two.</p><p>It wasn’t fixed, but random. It depended on one’s comprehension, luck, and talent.</p><p>Some martial artists awakened at the first level of the spiritual ocean tier, some at the second level of the spiritual ocean tier, and some at the third level of the spiritual ocean tier …</p><p>Some were even in the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>Most people would never be able to awaken a third bloodline in their lifetime.</p><p>The probability was frighteningly low. Out of ten thousand Warriors who broke through to the sea of soul realm, only one would be able to awaken the third bloodline.</p><p>However, once the third bloodline was awakened, it would be terrifying.</p><p>This was because those who could break through to the spirit sea realm usually had a second bloodline that was at least at the third level of the king tier, or even higher.</p><p>As for the third bloodline, it was definitely of a higher level than the second bloodline.</p><p>Some people could even awaken a divine bloodline in one go and soar to the sky.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had the nine Dragons bloodline. Even if he could not awaken a third bloodline in the future, his two types of bloodlines could be promoted to divine level bloodlines in the future.</p><p>He was filled with anticipation.</p><p>“Take a look at what’s happening outside.”</p><p>Lu Ming left the Supreme shrine.</p><p>Light flickered on dandan’s body, but she didn’t seem to move.</p><p>“Continue to wait! Eh? Who is that?”</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming saw a few light spots flying east from the distant mountain. However, they were too far away for Lu Ming to see them clearly.</p><p>“Let’s go east and take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming grabbed dandan and headed east.</p><p>After about ten thousand miles, Lu Ming slowly approached.</p><p>“It is indeed profound fragrance.”</p><p>In the distance, Lu Ming saw more than a dozen corpse guards with dozens of refined corpses. The woman in the middle was Xuan Xiang.</p><p>These corpse guards did not hide in the coffins, as if afraid of causing unnecessary trouble on the way.</p><p>After all, if a bunch of coffins were to fly, it would definitely alert others.</p><p>“So many experts!”</p><p>Among the dozen corpse guards, Lu Ming could not see through at least three of them. They were definitely all King tiers in the upper tier.</p><p>Three corpse guards at the level of a King with at least six refined corpses at the level of a King. This was not something Lu Ming could fight against.</p><p>Lu Ming could only follow them from a distance and wait for an opportunity to make a move.</p><p>But along the way, the people of the heavenly corpse sect were extremely cautious. Even when they were resting, there would be a corpse guard at the late stage King level guarding by Xuan Xiang’s side.</p><p>Lu Ming could not do it at all.</p><p>Just like that, more than ten days passed, and they were getting closer and closer to the East.</p><p>……</p><p>The ancient desolate city had always been extremely mysterious in the eastern part of the Tianxuan region.</p><p>This was because there was a legend that said that the ancient desolate city did not belong to this world and was not built by the people of this world.</p><p>Instead, it had descended from the sky in the ancient times.</p><p>There was a mysterious aura in the ancient desolate city. Other ancient martial art practitioners would not be able to cultivate or increase their cultivation if they entered.</p><p>Only members of the Xuan family could cultivate in the ancient barren city. Therefore, there were no outsiders living in the ancient barren city except for the Xuan family.</p><p>There were not many people in the Xuan family of the ancient barren city, but once someone was born, they would all be peerless geniuses.</p><p>Today, in the meeting hall of the Xuan clan, not only were there people from the Xuan clan, there were also people from the Emperor heaven divine Palace.</p><p>The palace masters of fire, earth, and Thunder were all in the meeting hall of the ancient desolate city.</p><p>Other than them, there were also some protectors of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace.</p><p>They were all powerful people.</p><p>recently, for some unknown reason, more and more people from the heavenly corpse sect have been appearing in the eastern part of the Tianxuan region. Could it be that the central Tianxuan sub-Palace is already at a disadvantage? ”</p><p>The earth Palace Master said.</p><p>especially in the ancient barren city, the sky corpse sect’s corpse guards keep coming to harass us, so the palace Master has sent us to assist. I wonder what the purpose of the sky corpse sect is? ”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master said with a frown.</p><p>“Could it be that the heavenly corpse sect’s goal is the desolate ancient tomb?”</p><p>A middle-aged man sitting at the head of the table said with a frown.</p><p>This man was the city Lord of the ancient Barrens city and the head of the Xuan family.</p><p>A young man stood beside him. It was Xuan Feng.</p><p>“Desolate ancient tomb?”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master and the others revealed doubtful expressions.</p><p>according to the ancient records of our Xuan family, the ancient barren city descended from another world. Along with it was the Tomb of the Ancients, where the corpses of unparalleled experts were buried. The ancestors of our Xuan family entered the tomb by chance and fused with a drop of blood from one of the corpses, which allowed them to cultivate in the ancient barren city.</p><p>“I suspect that the people from the heavenly corpse sect wanted to open the desolate ancient tomb and seize the corpses!”</p><p>The master of the Xuan family said.</p><p>“There’s really such a thing?”</p><p>The earth Palace Master, lightning Palace Master, and the others were dumbfounded.</p><p>In the past, he had thought that it was just a rumor.</p><p>“Then we must not let the people of the heavenly corpse sect succeed. If they really get their hands on that peerless expert’s corpse and refine it into a refined corpse, it will be a great catastrophe.”</p><p>The earth Palace Master said.</p><p>“Don’t be afraid. It’s not that easy for them to open the desolate ancient tomb. They need two keys. Our desolate ancient city only has one key. The other one was taken away by another branch of the Xuan family ten thousand years ago and left.”</p><p>The city Lord of barren city said.</p><p>“That’s good!”</p><p>The few of them heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>a few days ago, the heavenly corpse sect would occasionally attack us. But these days, they have all gone into hiding. I wonder what their purpose is? ”</p><p>The palace Master of fire said.</p><p>no matter what their goal is, we just need to set up our defenses.</p><p>Thunder Palace Master said.</p><p>After that, the crowd continued to discuss for a while and then dispersed one by one.</p><p>Only the city Lord of barren city was frowning.</p><p>“Feng ‘er, if anything happens, you must escape. Your life is more important, understand?”</p><p>The ancient barren city Lord ordered.</p><p>“Father, I …”</p><p>Xuan Feng wanted to say something but stopped.</p><p>remember, the Xuan family can’t end here. This time, I have a bad feeling!</p><p>The city Lord of barren city said.</p><p>For a moment, the hall fell into silence.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
