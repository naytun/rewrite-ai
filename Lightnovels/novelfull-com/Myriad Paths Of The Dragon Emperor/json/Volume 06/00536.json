I haven’t received my reward yet!”</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently. He then looked at the old man at the counter.</p><p>The old man took out a storage ring and handed it to Lu Ming. here are 880000 Supreme spiritual crystals. Count them.</p><p>“There’s no need to light it!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. His storage ring flashed and all the best-grade spirit crystals were transferred into his storage ring.</p><p>Lu Ming then returned the storage ring to the elder.</p><p>“Hehe, now that I’ve received the reward, I’ll have to spit it out later, right?”</p><p>Shengchuan sneered.</p><p>“Oh, really? Don’t cry Later.”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming stepped forward and walked towards the divine guards ‘fighting ring.</p><p>In all the sub-palaces of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, there was a Divine Guard battle platform.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>The people in the mission Palace Hall swarmed towards the divine guards battle stage.</p><p>There were five to six hundred people.</p><p>Some of them had even used voice transmission talismans to ask their friends and family to go to the divine guards ‘battle platform to watch.</p><p>Five or six hundred people walking together on the street naturally caused a sensation. Many people were curious and asked around. After hearing the whole story, they also followed the crowd to the divine Guard battle stage.</p><p>The number of people in the crowd increased rapidly, and soon, there were several thousand people.</p><p>Lu Ming walked to the front of the crowd. When he arrived at the divine guards ‘battle platform, he was a little stunned because he realized that the divine guards’ battle platform was surrounded by people.</p><p>It seemed that some people had received the news and rushed to the divine Guard battle platform first.</p><p>“So many young experts of the Sheng family have come!”</p><p>“Yeah? It’s no wonder. Not many people dare to offend the Sheng family. It’s normal for the geniuses of the Sheng family to come out and take a look.”</p><p>I hope that Lu Ming can withstand a few more moves. I hope he won’t die so easily. I’ve run so far for nothing.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>A series of whispers sounded in the surroundings.</p><p>The smile on Lu Ming’s face grew wider.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Arriving at the edge of the divine guards ‘fighting ring, shengchuan stepped forward and crossed a distance of more than a hundred meters. He jumped onto the fighting ring and looked down at Lu Ming.”Lu Ming, hurry up and come up!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and walked up the stairs of the divine guards battle platform step by step.</p><p>He came to the divine Guard battle platform and stood opposite the holy river.</p><p>“Hahaha, Lu Ming, I didn’t expect that you would really dare to accept my challenge. I really don’t know where you got your guts from. Three moves. I’ll defeat you in three moves.”</p><p>Shengchuan’s smile was full of disdain.</p><p>“Three moves? Shengchuan, you have the nerve to say that. If it were me, I would have defeated him in two moves!”</p><p>no, one move is enough. I’ll beat him into a pig’s head with one move. Shengchuan, if you really defeat him with three moves, it’ll be too embarrassing.</p><p>shengchuan, this kid is so arrogant. I heard that he has repeatedly challenged the authority of the Sheng family. Today, you must cripple him and let him know the consequences of offending the Sheng family!</p><p>“That’s right, cripple him!”</p><p>At the edge of the fighting ring, some young geniuses from the Sheng family shouted one after another. Their voices were full of indifference and arrogance as if Lu Ming was a pitiful worm that could be manipulated at will.</p><p>The smile on shengchuan’s face grew wider. He looked at Lu Ming with contempt and said, ” “Lu Ming, did you hear that? This is the consequence of offending the Sheng family.”</p><p>“The next stage? Just relying on the mouths of your Sheng family?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Hmph, you’ll be crying later.”</p><p>Shengchuan’s eyes were cold.</p><p>how about this? it’s boring to fight directly. Let’s make a bet.</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly said.</p><p>He still remembered that last time he had a gambling match with Xue Chao, he had made a huge profit, so he naturally didn’t want to let go of this opportunity.</p><p>“Bet? What do you want to bet on?”</p><p>Shengchuan’s eyes lit up.</p><p>let’s bet on intent crystals, twenty. If I lose, I’ll give you twenty earth-type intent crystals. If you lose, you’ll give me twenty wind-type intent crystals. How about it? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Earth element intent crystal? You have one?”</p><p>Shengchuan’s eyes lit up. He had comprehended the creation of Earth.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. With a wave of his hand, twenty pieces of earth-type profound meaning crystals appeared in the air. They exuded a strong concept of earth.</p><p>He had obtained these earth-attribute profound meaning crystals with han man and the rest from the scaled Demon tribe in the demonic scales dimension. Lu Ming also had a mid-grade earth-attribute profound meaning crystal.</p><p>After han man and the others were killed by Lu Ming, the profound meaning crystals naturally fell into Lu Ming’s pocket.</p><p>“It really is an earth element intent crystal.”</p><p>Shengchuan’s eyes glowed.</p><p>“Where’s your wind-type intent crystal? Take it out!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Hmph, Lu Ming, are you afraid that I’ll go back on my word?”</p><p>Shengchuan snorted.</p><p>“I’m just afraid you’ll go back on your word.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Sheng Chuan gritted his teeth, but he didn’t have that many wind intent crystals.</p><p>shengchuan, I have a few wind-attribute intent crystals. I’ll lend them to you first!</p><p>“I also have a few pieces here!”</p><p>The young men from the Sheng family on the side chimed in and took out a few wind-element intent crystals.</p><p>Shengchuan was overjoyed. He received them one by one and said loudly, ” brothers, I’ll borrow these intent crystals first. I’ll return them to you in a while.</p><p>From his tone, it seemed like he was about to win.</p><p>“En, quickly cripple that brat. I still have to go back and cultivate!”</p><p>The other young men of the Sheng family said.</p><p>“Don’t worry, it’ll be quick!”</p><p>Shengchuan took the ultimacy crystal and returned to Lu Ming. twenty intent crystals, not a single one less!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. Now, what he desired the most was the wind-type ultimacy crystal.</p><p>“But, twenty is a little too little!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned to the young men of the Sheng family. His eyes suddenly lit up as if he had thought of something.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, Sheng Chuan put away the wind intent crystal, and a powerful aura burst out of his body.</p><p>The aura of the middle Lv 5 martial King realm.</p><p>“Lu Ming, just lose!”</p><p>Shengchuan shouted.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>He threw a punch and a huge mountain peak appeared in the sky. It was a few thousand feet tall and it came crashing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>It was extremely majestic. Lu Ming’s body was extremely small compared to the mountain.</p><p>“Is this the first level lower tier of the creation of Earth? It’s so powerful!”</p><p>Many low-tier King tiers and even martial artists below the king tier exclaimed in shock.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and a Spear’s gleam shot up into the sky, colliding with the mountain.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The spear radiance collided with the mountain, creating a series of rumbling sounds. It lasted for a while before it exploded.</p><p>The mountain exploded, and the spear radiance also collapsed and disappeared.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Shengchuan and Lu Ming retreated seven to eight steps.</p><p>The difference was that there was a strange smile on Lu Ming’s lips, while Sheng Chuan’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Shengchuan roared in rage. He was actually forced to retreat by Lu Ming. It was a great humiliation.</p><p>they’re evenly matched. They’re actually evenly matched. Lu Ming can actually withstand a move from shengchuan. Unbelievable!</p><p>it’s indeed incredible. I didn’t expect Lu Ming’s combat strength to be so strong. No wonder he dared to fight the holy river.</p><p>Exclamations came from the surroundings.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
