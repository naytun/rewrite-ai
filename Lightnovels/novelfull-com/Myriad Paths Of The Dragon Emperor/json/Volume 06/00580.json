It seemed to have come from ancient times and was extremely lonely.</p><p>I can’t believe that after so many years, your divine eye clan is still in the heaven realm. Has the heaven realm really been defeated? ”</p><p>A long sigh came from the ancient desolate city again.</p><p>“Who is it? You know quite a lot. Let me tell you, the heaven realm is already completely under the control of the divine eye clan. Only a few people are putting up a stubborn resistance. Very soon, the divine eye clan will be able to open up the entrance to the primordial realm. By then, both the heaven and the yuan world will be under the control of the divine eye clan.”</p><p>The leader of the three-eyed creature said.</p><p>In the ancient desolate city, the voice fell silent and did not speak for a long time.</p><p>“Pretending to be mysterious, charge in!”</p><p>The three-eyed creature’s leader roared.</p><p>Immediately, dozens of three-eyed creatures charged into the ancient desolate city.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a sword cry was heard. A beam of sword Qi flashed out of the desolate ancient tomb.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Dozens of three-eyed creatures were cut in half, including two powerful spiritual ocean tier beings.</p><p>This time, the three-eyed creature’s expression changed drastically again.</p><p>Pada! “Pa da!”</p><p>From within the desolate ancient tomb came the sound of deep footsteps. The sound was not loud, but it strangely spread far and wide.</p><p>Then, three figures walked out of the desolate ancient tomb.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming’s eyesight was extremely good. He could see clearly even from hundreds of miles away.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly narrowed.</p><p>“Xuan Xiang, Xuan Feng!”</p><p>Among the three people who walked out, Lu Ming actually saw Xuan Xiang and Xuan Feng.</p><p>Xuan Xiang and Xuan Feng had been in the desolate ancient tomb all this time. What was going on?</p><p>In front of Xuan Xiang and Xuan Feng, there was a middle-aged man with disheveled hair. He was extremely handsome, but he seemed to have experienced many vicissitudes of life.</p><p>The clothes he was wearing were extremely strange, and they were definitely not what was popular now.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>The three-eyed creature’s leader roared.</p><p>“He’s just a lucky person who didn’t die!”</p><p>The middle-aged man let out a soft sigh. He then looked around and said,”Since I’ve encountered you, consider it your bad luck. I’ll send you on your way!”</p><p>you’re talking big! Let’s attack together!</p><p>The three-eyed creature’s leader roared.</p><p>Following that, all of the three-eyed creatures ‘third eyes lit up and shot out beams of divine light that pierced through the middle-aged man.</p><p>The leader of the three-eyed creatures was especially powerful. It was unimaginably powerful, and the divine light it shot out directly pierced a huge hole in the space.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the next moment, the sound of a sword rang out.</p><p>The middle-aged man didn’t move. His eyes lit up and a sword light flew out from his right eye, sweeping in all directions.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>All of the three-eyed creatures around the ancient desolate city were cut in half by a single blade, as if they were nothing more than grass.</p><p>Including the leader, he was killed with a single sword strike!</p><p>In the clouds far away, Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p><p>Heavens, this was too powerful. Who was this middle-aged man?</p><p>At this moment, the middle-aged man looked in Lu Ming’s direction and said indifferently, ” “Little guy, have you seen enough? if you’ve seen enough, come out.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly. He glanced at dandan and said,”Your inscription is useless!”</p><p>nonsense. That person is not simple, not simple at all. Why do I find him so familiar? I can’t remember, I can’t remember.</p><p>Dandan muttered.</p><p>Lu Ming ignored dandan and flew toward the ancient barren city.</p><p>“Lord Lu Ming!”</p><p>When Xuan Xiang saw Lu Ming, she was ecstatic.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Xuan Feng’s eyes flashed with surprise.</p><p>“Haha, Xuan Xiang, brother Xuan Feng, I didn’t expect to meet you here. Who is this senior?”</p><p>Lu Ming flew to the front of Xuan Xiang and the other two and cupped his fists at the middle-aged man.</p><p>Lord Lu Ming, it’s great that you’re fine. This person is the ancestor of the Xuan family. No, it should be the ancestor of the Xuan family. The Xuan family was founded by integrating this senior’s blood essence.</p><p>Xuan Xiang hurriedly explained.</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>At this moment, the middle-aged man suddenly appeared in front of Lu Ming. His eyes were like the stars in the universe as he fixed his gaze on dandan.</p><p>“Oh my God, what are you doing? I’m the head of the top ten warbeasts, unparalleled in the world. Don’t you dare have any ideas about me. ”</p><p>Seeing that the middle-aged man was staring at it, dandan was so frightened that it squalled. Its four claws clung tightly to Lu Ming’s neck, and its head shrank into its turtle shell.</p><p>“I didn’t expect this, I didn’t expect this!”</p><p>The middle-aged man sighed and looked at Lu Ming. His gaze seemed to be able to see through everything.</p><p>there’s also the bloodline of the nine Dragons. This little fellow’s luck is not shallow!</p><p>The middle-aged man sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed drastically. He was extremely shocked.</p><p>The middle-aged man had actually recognized his nine Dragon bloodline with a single glance. Didn’t the Supreme Master of the nine suns help him seal it? From the aura, wasn’t it impossible to tell that he had the bloodline of the nine Dragons?</p><p>This person was actually able to see through it with a single glance.</p><p>“Little guy, don’t be nervous. Although the bloodline of the nine Dragons is rare, it’s useless to me.”</p><p>The middle-aged man smiled.</p><p>“Lord Lu Ming, the patriarch is repairing a teleportation array and is preparing to return to the primordial realm. You came at the right time. Let’s go back together!”</p><p>Xuan Xiang walked over and said.</p><p>“We can go back?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he was overjoyed.</p><p>“That’s right. There was originally a teleportation array in the desolate ancient tomb, but it was destroyed. During this period of time, the old ancestor has been repairing it.”</p><p>Xuan Xiang said.</p><p>“You guys wait for me here. There are a few ants, I’ll go and deal with them!”</p><p>The middle-aged man said. As soon as he finished speaking, he disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming was right beside him but he did not sense how the middle-aged man disappeared. It was as if the middle-aged man was not there at all.</p><p>But the next moment, the middle-aged man suddenly appeared again.</p><p>From start to finish, it had not even been two breaths.</p><p>it’s been settled. Come with me!</p><p>Then, he walked towards the desolate ancient tomb.</p><p>“This … This is too fast!”</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p><p>Lu Ming guessed that the middle-aged man must have gone to deal with the battleships. However, the speed was too terrifying.</p><p>“Lord Lu Ming, let’s go!”</p><p>Xuan Xiang pulled Lu Ming and walked towards the desolate ancient tomb.</p><p>Xuan Feng did not say anything and followed him in.</p><p>After entering the Tomb of the Ancients, the door closed.</p><p>The desolate ancient tomb was huge and spacious, like a Hall.</p><p>In the hall, there was only one bronze coffin that was open.</p><p>Behind the bronze coffin, there was a small altar. The middle-aged man came to the side of the altar and formed a seal with his hands. Runes entered the altar.</p><p>“Lord Lu Ming, the teleportation array will be repaired in a day. Let’s wait for a while!”</p><p>Xuan Xiang said.</p><p>“Good! Xuanxiang, have you been here all this time?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
