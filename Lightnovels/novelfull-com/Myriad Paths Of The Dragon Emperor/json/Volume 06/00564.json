He did not expect to find esoteric crystals in this place.</p><p>...</p><p>Judging from the intent and aura, it should be a Water-type profound meaning crystal. Lu Ming had no use for it but he could exchange it.</p><p>Without a word, Lu Ming picked up a saber and started digging.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current cultivation, his digging speed was very fast. In just half an hour, he had dug out a huge pit and obtained thirty Water-type profound meaning crystals.</p><p>Of course, they were all low-grade. There were no middle-grade ones, but Lu Ming was already very satisfied. It was just a pit of ultimacy crystals. It was already very good to have thirty ultimacy crystals.</p><p>could this be a dimension, a dimension that no one has ever been to before, just like the scaled demon dimension? ”</p><p>Lu Ming guessed in his heart.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming continued to move forward.</p><p>Of course, they didn’t go very fast. They were afraid that they would be done for if they entered the territory of a powerful demonic beast.</p><p>However, after a few hundred miles, Lu Ming stopped again because he had discovered another pit of ultimacy crystals.</p><p>It was only a few hundred miles and there was another pit of ultimacy crystals. Lu Ming was rather shocked.</p><p>Moreover, this ultimacy crystal pit was a wind-type ultimacy crystal. Lu Ming had a use for it. He did not think too much and started digging.</p><p>&Nbsp; this time, he had dug out twenty-nine wind intent crystals.</p><p>After keeping it, Lu Ming continued to move forward.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked for the rest of the journey. There were many ultimacy crystals in this forest.</p><p>He sprinted for around ten thousand miles and came across a total of nine intent crystal pits. There were wind, fire, lightning, earth, and so on. There were a total of seven attributes, and he had obtained over two hundred different intent crystals.</p><p>haha, this is a Holy Land. How many intent crystals can we dig out if we turn this place upside down? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were shining.</p><p>However, Lu Ming discovered a problem. There were not many spiritual herbs in this place. He saw a few stalks of spiritual herbs occasionally. They were all level one or two. The high-level spiritual herbs seemed to have been picked.</p><p>eh? there’s an intent crystal pit!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming discovered another ultimacy crystal pit.</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was about to dig, he felt a strong sense of danger. The hair on his body stood on end.</p><p>There was danger!</p><p>Without thinking, Lu Ming flew to the sky and landed on a branch of a big tree.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A beam of sword aura flashed past and a bottomless sword hole appeared where Lu Ming had been standing.</p><p>“Little bastard, your reaction is quite fast.”</p><p>With a sneer, the figure of an old man appeared.</p><p>“Old man, it’s you?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold. This old man was the master of the Thunder Palace.</p><p>“What’s wrong? I’m surprised to see you. Let’s see who will save you today.”</p><p>A cold killing intent flashed in the eyes of Thunder Palace Master.</p><p>“You think you can kill me?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“Hehe, Lu Ming, I have to admit that you’re indeed very lucky. You were ambushed by the heavenly corpse sect along the way. Everyone else died, but you’re still alive. I thought you were dead a long time ago,”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master laughed coldly.</p><p>“Were you the one who informed the heavenly corpse sect?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“That’s right, it’s me!”</p><p>Lu Ming had never expected that the palace Master of the Thunder Palace would actually admit to it.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body exploded with a strong killing intent. His voice was extremely cold as he said,”Old man, I didn’t expect it to really be you.”</p><p>When he asked that question earlier, it was just a casual and probing question. He had not expected that it would really be the Thunder Palace Master.</p><p>He had always thought that it was the Sheng family who had attacked the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>“That’s right, it’s me. I was the one who leaked your information to the heavenly corpse sect. Look at me, I’ve found dozens of people to be buried with you. Unfortunately, you don’t appreciate it. However, it’s the same as sending you down now.”</p><p>The Thunder Palace Master sneered.</p><p>“Old man, I will kill you!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s killing intent soared.</p><p>In order to kill him, this old fellow was actually willing to sacrifice so many Ditian divine guards ‘lives. He was simply insane.</p><p>“Kill me? In your dreams! Die!”</p><p>The Thunder Palace Master shouted, and his Lv 9 martial King realm aura burst out. With a wave of his hand, a sword of Thunder formed in his hand.</p><p>“Dandan, smash!”</p><p>Lu Ming patted dandan.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Dandan flew out and smashed towards Thunder Palace Master.</p><p>??…</p><p>Thunder Palace master’s eyes widened, and a bolt of lightning as thick as an arm shot toward dandan.</p><p>However, it was of no use. It rushed past and continued to smash towards Thunder Palace master’s face.</p><p>Thunder Palace master’s expression changed slightly. He retreated and slapped out.</p><p>This palm was too fast, and dandan couldn’t avoid it. She was hit and flew far away.</p><p>“What’s the use of unorthodox methods? die!”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master shouted coldly.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. The cultivation level of the palace Master of the Thunder Palace was too high. Even a surprise attack was useless. Without any hesitation, he turned around and used the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps to run away.</p><p>Right now, he was still not a match for the Thunder Palace Master, so he could only retreat first.</p><p>“If you want to leave, then stay!”</p><p>The Thunder Palace Master bellowed in anger. He moved and shot towards Lu Ming like a bolt of lightning.</p><p>His speed was so fast that he was not slower than Lu Ming.</p><p>??…</p><p>A lightning sword slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“True dragon Strike!”</p><p>Lu Ming thrust his spear and a three-colored true dragon flew out, pouncing at the lightning sword.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The sword of lightning pierced through the three-colored war Dragon, crushing it in an instant. The sword of lightning did not stop and continued to shoot toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was grave as he blocked the attack with his long spear.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>With a loud boom, Lu Ming’s body was sent flying like a cannonball. He crashed heavily into the ground, creating a deep pit.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming coughed out large mouthfuls of blood. His body was injured.</p><p>If it were not for the fact that Lu Ming had already comprehended the Thunder mentality and cultivated it to the late-stage of level one lower tier, which offset a part of the power of lightning, this move alone would have severely injured Lu Ming.</p><p>Lv 9 martial King realm. You’re indeed powerful. I can’t fight you now. Let’s go!</p><p>Without any hesitation, Lu Ming rushed out of the crater and ran forward with the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps.</p><p>“I told you, you can’t escape!”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master’s Voice was cold as he chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>The Thunder concept that the Thunder Palace Master had comprehended was too fast. Lu Ming could not escape at all.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming and the Thunder Palace Master exchanged a blow. This time, it was even worse. Smoke was coming out of his body and he was almost burnt to ashes. His body seemed to be splitting apart.</p><p>Lu Ming rushed out of the huge pit and coughed up a large amount of blood. He looked at the Thunder Palace Master with a murderous look.</p><p>“Run, why aren’t you running? Let’s see where you can run to! Today, you will die!”</p><p>The master of thunder Palace walked over step by step, looking extremely cold.</p><p>“It’s still not certain who will die today.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a hint of ruthlessness, and the power of Thunder exuded from between his eyebrows.</p><p>He was going to control the lightning cauldron and launch a fatal attack on the lightning Palace Master.</p><p>After using the lightning cauldron, he would definitely fall into a weakened state. This place could be said to be extremely dangerous, but at this point, he had no other choice.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Dandan flew back and glowed beside Lu Ming.</p><p>The master of the Thunder Palace frowned. For some reason, he felt a dangerous aura from Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
