A day passed in the blink of an eye, but there was no movement at all.</p><p>...</p><p>When night fell on the second day, a series of air-piercing sounds came from afar.</p><p>“Those are the people of the heavenly corpse sect!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. In the distance, at least fifty coffins were flying over.</p><p>“It seems that these people from the Sheng family are here to ambush the people from the heavenly corpse sect. Interesting!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>More than fifty coffins headed toward the intent crystal mine.</p><p>In the next moment, they were all floating above the power Upanishad crystal mine.</p><p>&Nbsp; ka ka …</p><p>Some shrubs opened up, and a few corpse guards in black robes walked out.</p><p>hehe, it seems like the news was right. There’s an intent crystal lode here.</p><p>A corpse guard let out a cold laugh.</p><p>“Let’s start digging!”</p><p>The other corpse guard said.</p><p>At this moment, a sudden change occurred …</p><p>Around the esoteric crystal mine, inscriptions suddenly appeared and shone with a bright light.</p><p>In an instant, it formed a huge light shield, enveloping the people of the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>“Not good, it’s an inscription formation, retreat!”</p><p>A corpse guard shouted and controlled the refined corpse to rush out.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Light swords suddenly appeared on the light shield and stabbed at the corpse guard and the refined corpse.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The sound of an explosion rang out, and the corpse guard and refined corpse were blasted back.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this time, figures rushed out from the surrounding forest.</p><p>More than a hundred figures surrounded the people of the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>“Ditian divine guards! Damn it, you’re from the Sheng family? We’ve been tricked.”</p><p>A corpse guard roared.</p><p>it’s too late for you to know now. You scumbags of the heavenly corpse sect, just become my reward.</p><p>In the Sheng family, the tall young man laughed.</p><p>Obviously, they were the leaders of the Sheng family.</p><p>“Charge, charge out!”</p><p>A corpse guard roared.</p><p>&Nbsp; ka ka …</p><p>More than fifty refined corpses appeared from the more than fifty coffins, and their chains shot toward the shield.</p><p>control the array and kill those bastards from the heavenly corpse sect!</p><p>In the Sheng family, the pale-faced young man gave the order.</p><p>Immediately, thirty-six people flew around the inscription formation. True essence gushed out, controlling the inscription formation to attack.</p><p>As the inscriptions fought, the light became even more dazzling. Beams of sword Qi formed and attacked the heavenly corpse sect and the refined corpses.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>For a time, the rumbling sounds continued.</p><p>“Something’s wrong!”</p><p>At this moment, the young man with a slightly pale face spoke.</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>The tall young man asked.</p><p>the number of corpse guards is not right. There are only twenty corpse guards in the array. Although there are fifty coffins, there was only one refined corpse in each coffin just now.</p><p>The young man with a pale face frowned. Then, his eyes suddenly flashed and he shouted,”Not good, only a portion of the heavenly corpse sect’s people have entered.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The tall young man was stunned.</p><p>“Hehe, Sacred Hawk, your brain is still as nimble as ever!”</p><p>At this time, a cold laugh suddenly came from the sky.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>From all directions, the sound of air breaking came, and corpse guards in black robes appeared one after another.</p><p>In all four directions, there were at least thirty corpse guards. Each corpse guard was followed by two or even three refined corpses. They formed an encirclement, surrounding the Sheng family in the middle.</p><p>Everyone from the Sheng family turned pale.</p><p>“Hehehe!”</p><p>A corpse guard with a black mole between his brows sneered as he looked at the people of the Sheng family. when I received the news, I felt that it was a little strange. Just in case, I called a group of people to go first. As expected, this is a trap set by your Sheng family. It’s not that easy to kill us.</p><p>“Hmph, so what if you all know? A portion of your men will be trapped in the formation. If you lose a portion of your men, you’ll still die!”</p><p>The young sacred Eagle with a slightly pale face said coldly.</p><p>“Oh, really? Today, you are the ones who will die. Kill!”</p><p>The eyes of the corpse guard with the mole flashed with violence and killing intent as he roared.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The corpse guards roared as the refined corpses waved their chains and charged at the Sheng family.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The sacred Eagle also roared, and a violent aura spread out from its body. Its arms shook, and like a Goshawk, it charged toward the corpse guard with the mole between its eyebrows.</p><p>His powerful strength was on full display. His cultivation was at the middle stage of the LV 6 martial King realm.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The corpse guard with the mole between his eyebrows shouted coldly. Beside him, two refined corpses, both at the middle stage of Lv 6 martial King realm, charged toward the sacred Eagle.</p><p>At the same time, the young man with the mole between his eyebrows also charged toward the sacred Eagle. The combat strength he displayed was also very terrifying. He was also a middle stage Lv 6 martial King.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>With a few explosions, the sacred Eagle fought two refined corpses and a corpse guard of the same level alone, not at a disadvantage at all.</p><p>In terms of combat strength, the geniuses of the Sheng family had the upper hand.</p><p>The heavenly corpse sect’s advantage was their refined corpses. They had a large number of refined corpses, and they were invulnerable and unafraid of death.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>&Nbsp; explosions continued to ring out as the two sides engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>The corpse guards in the inscription formation also controlled the refined corpses to attack the inscription formation.</p><p>However, in a battle of inscriptions, they were very strong and couldn’t be broken in a short time.</p><p>“I didn’t expect that I would be caught up in a great battle.”</p><p>Lu Ming restrained his aura and stood still, watching quietly.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>&Nbsp; at this moment, the ground around the intent crystal mine began to rise and fall. Black Panther-like demonic beasts emerged from the ground, and as they waved their claws, the ground began to crack.</p><p>“Not good, these demonic corpses are trying to destroy the foundation of the formation.”</p><p>The sacred Eagle shouted.</p><p>“Attack those demon corpses!”</p><p>The tall young man from the Sheng family shouted.</p><p>Originally, the 36 youths of the Sheng family who were controlling the formation could no longer care about controlling the formation. They started to attack the demonic corpses.</p><p>However, because the formation base had already been partially destroyed, the power of the inscription formation had been greatly weakened.</p><p>In the formation, the refined corpses attacked even more crazily, causing the formation to shake violently as if it was going to collapse at any moment.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The sacred Eagle growled.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The corpse guard with the mole controlled the refined corpse and attacked the sacred Eagle.</p><p>The two corpse guards blocked in front of him and attacked fearlessly.</p><p>The sacred Eagle’s attack landed on the refined corpse, but it could only leave a slight wound. The corpse guard itself hid behind it and attacked coldly.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>At this moment, someone cried out. Someone from the Sheng family had been killed.</p><p>“Attack the corpse guards, don’t fight with the refined corpses!”</p><p>The sacred Eagle roared.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, the inscription formation below completely collapsed. The corpse guards and refined corpses inside the formation rushed out madly and joined the battle.</p><p>All of a sudden, the Sheng family was at a complete disadvantage.</p><p>From time to time, the experts of the Sheng family would be killed.</p><p>However, the heavenly corpse sect was not having a good time either.</p><p>The heavenly corpse sect’s corpse guards were relatively weak, and in a chaotic battle, they were easy to be ambushed. Therefore, corpse guards of the heavenly corpse sect were killed from time to time.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
