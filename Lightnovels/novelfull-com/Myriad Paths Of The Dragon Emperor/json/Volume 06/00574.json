It broke through the strong wind above the ocean and struck the surface of the ocean.</p><p>...</p><p>In an instant, the thousand-meter-high wave was crushed. A huge spear mark appeared in the ocean, and the sea water collapsed and split in two.</p><p>It was as if the entire sea had been split in half by Lu Ming’s spear.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>After a few breaths, a deafening roar came from the ocean. The giant wolf rolled over and covered the traces of the spear being pulled out.</p><p>my combat strength is at least five times stronger than when I was at the peak of Lv 6 martial King realm!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Now, if he were to fight with the palace master of thunder Palace, he was confident that he could kill the palace master of thunder Palace with one shot without the help of the inscription.</p><p>now, I’ll cultivate the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps and the Dragon God three absolutes in this ocean!</p><p>With the three types of intent realms at full completion, he could cultivate the Dragon God’s three absolutes to the fifth level.</p><p>When one’s third level will reached its peak, one would be able to cultivate the Dragon God’s three absolutes to the sixth level, the peak.</p><p>Thereafter, Lu Ming focused on cultivating two types of martial arts techniques.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another three days passed.</p><p>During this time, dandan looked at the sea every day in a daze, as if she was thinking about something.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming was cultivating when he suddenly heard the sounds of fighting from afar.</p><p>And the sounds of fighting were getting closer to the sea.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved and flew in that direction. Dandan hurriedly followed.</p><p>In front of them, there were five figures flying towards the sea. They were covered in blood and their faces were filled with fear.</p><p>Among these five people, three of them were experts from the Xuan family of the ancient barren city. They were all at the level of lower tier King tiers.</p><p>The other two people were the two protectors of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace.</p><p>One of them had an extremely powerful aura. He was actually a level 7 upper tier King.</p><p>The Guardians of the Empyrean divine Palace were usually at the lower tier of the peak Lv 6 martial King realm. It was obvious that this Guardian had made a breakthrough in his cultivation during this period of time.</p><p>However, his face was still filled with panic.</p><p>haha, you can’t escape. Die!</p><p>Behind them, there were dozens of corpse guards chasing and laughing.</p><p>They were not in a hurry, like cats playing with mice.</p><p>One of the corpse guards had reached the peak of Lv 8 martial King realm.</p><p>After running for a while, they were almost at the seaside.</p><p>“The ocean is ahead!”</p><p>The two protectors from the Xuan family and the Empyrean heaven divine Palace were filled with despair.</p><p>“Hahaha, let’s see where you can run to now!”</p><p>A corpse guard laughed.</p><p>“Don’t run anymore. All of you will die today. Obediently turn into our refined corpses. Didn’t that Palace Master of your empyrean heaven divine Palace already become our refined corpses?”</p><p>The corpse guard at the peak Lv 8 martial King realm sneered.</p><p>“Today, you’re the ones who will die!”</p><p>Suddenly, a cold voice came from the direction of the sea.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>Everyone was stunned. They looked in the direction of the sea and saw a flash of light. The next moment, a young man in his twenties appeared. His eyes were as cold as a sharp sword. It was Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, is that you? Run, you’re not their match!”</p><p>A green-robed Guardian shouted when he saw Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming stepped forward and faced the corpse guard of the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>“Haha, another brat who’s here to die.”</p><p>A corpse guard at the peak of the sixth level martial King realm sneered and controlled the two refined corpses to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming flicked his finger and three rays of spear radiance shot out, piercing the glabella of the corpse guard at the peak of Lv 6 martial King realm and two refined corpses.</p><p>That corpse Guard’s eyes opened wide, with a look of disbelief.</p><p>He did not expect Lu Ming’s spear to be so fast. He could not stop it at all.</p><p>“Brat, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>The corpse guard at the peak Lv 8 martial King realm roared, his killing intent surging like the tide.</p><p>The other corpse guards also surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>“What do we do?”</p><p>The people of the Xuan family and the two guardians stopped in the distance with complicated expressions.</p><p>there are two upper tier Kings and five upper tier refined corpses. Lu Ming is definitely no match for them. We’re just going to die if we go!</p><p>A protector said.</p><p>“That’s right, let’s take this opportunity to leave!”</p><p>A middle-aged man from the Xuan family said.</p><p>As for the others, their eyes flashed with hesitation.</p><p>let’s go. We won’t be able to escape once Lu Ming is dead.</p><p>The middle-aged man from the Xuan family urged.</p><p>“Good! Let’s go!”</p><p>The others gritted their teeth.</p><p>However, at this moment, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>A huge flood Dragon emerged from Lu Ming’s body. It opened its mouth and sucked. Drops of blood essence flew out of the corpse guards ‘bodies and fell to the ground like rain.</p><p>Only the two late stage King level corpse guards didn’t die, but their faces were also pale.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>The Xuan family and the two guardians were in disbelief.</p><p>“Damn it, you dare to kill my heavenly corpse sect’s people, you’re courting death!”</p><p>The corpse guard at the peak Lv 8 martial King realm roared and controlled the three refined corpses to charge at Lu Ming.</p><p>“That is … The palace Master of earth!”</p><p>Lu Ming noticed that one of the refined corpses looked extremely familiar. It was clearly the palace Master of earth.</p><p>“Hahaha, this is one of the palace Masters of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. He was killed by our experts and I’ll reward him by refining him into a refined corpse. Isn’t he very strong?”</p><p>The corpse guard at Lv 8 martial King realm sneered.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming swept his long spear and the two Lv 8 martial King refined corpses were sent flying like cannonballs for thousands of meters before they crashed to the ground.</p><p>He took a step forward and the power of the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps exploded. The other Lv 7 martial King realm martial artist and his two Lv 7 refined corpses exploded.</p><p>“Ah, how could it be?”</p><p>The corpse guard at the peak Lv 8 martial King realm shrieked in fear.</p><p>Not far away, the three people and two guardians of the Xuan family who were preparing to escape were dumbfounded as they watched the scene.</p><p>Lu Ming had killed the corpse guards that had caused them to flee for their lives without any effort. He was unimaginably powerful.</p><p>Gulu!</p><p>The middle-aged man from the Xuan family swallowed his saliva and broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>“Don’t come over!”</p><p>The corpse guard shrieked and controlled the refined corpse refined by the palace Master of earth to stand in front of Lu Ming. At the same time, he ran for his life.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and his figure flashed past the palace Master of earth. He appeared behind the corpse guard and thrust his long spear, piercing through the back of the corpse Guard’s waist and exiting from its dantian.</p><p>True essence exploded, and the corpse Guard’s dantian exploded, its cultivation completely destroyed.</p><p>With his cultivation destroyed, the body of the palace Master of earth stopped in the air, not moving at all.</p><p>“Don’t kill me!”</p><p>The corpse guard screamed and begged for mercy.</p><p>“Speak, where are the rest of you?” Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“It’s on a plain a hundred thousand miles ahead. I beg you, let me go!”</p><p>The corpse guard begged for mercy.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The long spear shook, and the corpse guard was torn into pieces.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, dozens of storage rings flew into Lu Ming’s hands and disappeared.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I didn’t expect you to have grown to this extent after not seeing you for a while.”</p><p>At this moment, the three people from the Xuan family and the two guardians flew over. One of the Guardians said with a smile.</p><p>that’s right. I’ve lived for a few hundred years. Young hero Lu Ming is the strongest genius I’ve ever seen.</p><p>The middle-aged man from the Xuan family also smiled in a flattering manner.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
