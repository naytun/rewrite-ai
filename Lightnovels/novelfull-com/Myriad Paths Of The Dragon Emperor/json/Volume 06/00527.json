He kept screaming and crawling forward.</p><p>“Shengyu, who’s dead now?”</p><p>Lu Ming sprawled on dandan’s body and flew above the Saint Jade, looking down at it coldly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ve killed so many people from the Sheng family. You’ll die too.”</p><p>Shengyu roared.</p><p>hehe, I don’t know how many times you people from the Sheng family have said the same thing. I’m tired of hearing it.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly, his eyes filled with killing intent.</p><p>“Wait, wait! Lu Ming, I’m begging you. I’m begging you not to kill me. I can swear, I can swear a blood oath that I won’t say a word about what happened today. I’m begging you to spare me this once.”</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming’s murderous intent, shengyu was afraid and actually began to beg for mercy.</p><p>“I still believe in the dead.”</p><p>Lu Ming was unmoved.</p><p>no, don’t, Lu Ming. I know that there’s an esoteric crystal vein in the demonic scales dimension. If you let me go, I’ll tell you the location of the vein.</p><p>Shengyu shouted.</p><p>“A power Upanishad crystal mine?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled and his eyes shone.</p><p>A power Upanishad crystal mine was different from a power Upanishad crystal pit.</p><p>A pit of intent crystals could only produce a few pieces, or at most a few dozen.</p><p>However, a profound meaning crystal vein was completely different. Even the smallest profound meaning crystal vein could produce more than a hundred pieces of profound meaning crystal.</p><p>And this was the smallest one. If there were more, there would be no more.</p><p>This was a huge temptation for anyone.</p><p>“Tell me, where is the power Upanishad crystal mine?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked in a deep voice.</p><p>“As long as you promise me that you won’t kill me, I’ll tell you. Otherwise, I won’t tell you even if I die.”</p><p>Shengyu shouted.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and he seemed to be hesitating.</p><p>Shengyu was on tenterhooks, afraid that Lu Ming would kill him.</p><p>After hesitating for a while, Lu Ming said, ” “Okay, I promise you. I won’t kill you. Tell me, where is the power Upanishad crystal vein?”</p><p>swear! Swear a blood oath! I’ll only believe you if you do that!</p><p>Shengyu called out.</p><p>you talk too much nonsense. Since you don’t believe me, then go to hell!</p><p>Lu Ming’s killing intent was intense.</p><p>“Wait, I’ll tell you, I’ll tell you. In my storage ring, there’s a blue jade card that records the exact location of the crystal mine.”</p><p>Shengyu shouted, then looked at Lu Ming expectantly.”I’ve already told you. You just need to take out the Jade token and you’ll know.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and patted dandan. “Smash it!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>It shook and smashed towards the head of the Saint Jade.</p><p>ah, Lu Ming, you said that you won’t kill me …</p><p>Shengyu roared, but before he could finish, he was hit by dandan, and his head burst like a watermelon.</p><p>I said I won’t kill you, but that doesn’t mean other things can’t kill you.</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>“Dandan, can you take off those storage rings?”</p><p>Lu Ming patted dandan again.</p><p>Dandan’s body trembled and a ray of light emanated from it. It swept up the Saint Jade’s storage ring and it flew into Lu Ming’s hand.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He continued to follow the law and took all the storage rings of the other Sheng family youths.</p><p>Unfortunately, their blood essence was all gone after being struck by the lightning cauldron, so they couldn’t devour it.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming found the demon subduing spear in a pile of rocks.</p><p>“Dandan, let’s quickly leave this place.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Just now, there had been a great commotion here, and it might have attracted other creatures.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming was so weak, he would be dead for sure if any scaled demon, Di Tian divine guards, or corpse guards came.</p><p>Immediately, dandan carried Lu Ming and flew into the distance.</p><p>After flying for tens of thousands of miles, Lu Ming found a rather remote place and entered the Supreme shrine.</p><p>There were many bottles and jars in the Supreme shrine, all of which were high-grade pills that he had obtained from other martialists.</p><p>Lu Ming picked up the grade one healing pill and took a big gulp from the bottle. There were a total of nine pills. He swallowed all of them and began to heal.</p><p>Lu Ming’s physical body had already reached complete rank-6 and was slowly recovering.</p><p>As the medicinal effects spread throughout his body, his body’s recovery rate was greatly accelerated.</p><p>Lu Ming’s muscles were wriggling slowly. On the wound on his chest, the muscles wriggled and new muscles grew slowly, covering the wound and finally blocking his heart.</p><p>Otherwise, one could see his beating heart from the outside, which was extremely terrifying.</p><p>After the healing pills had been consumed, Lu Ming took out another bottle and swallowed it.</p><p>An hour later, Lu Ming heaved a long sigh of relief. His injuries had finally stabilized.</p><p>“This time, it was really dangerous!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>To be honest, this time, it was beyond his expectations.</p><p>He had wanted to kill the Saint Jade after he had obtained more Supreme spiritual crystals and reached Lv 4 martial King realm.</p><p>He didn’t expect to be ambushed by the Saint Jade.</p><p>Moreover, the key point was that the Saint Jade actually had a net-like spirit weapon on her body, which perfectly countered dandan and made her lose her effect.</p><p>Otherwise, with dandan around, Lu Ming could also break out of the siege.</p><p>That was why Lu Ming was in an unprecedented danger and was almost cut in half by Saint Jade.</p><p>If it wasn’t for the lightning cauldron, he would have really died.</p><p>Lu Ming guessed that the Thunder cauldron had taken him as a temporary shelter. It did not want him to die, so it helped Lu Ming at the critical moment.</p><p>“In the future, I should be more careful. I can’t be careless, and I can’t underestimate others.”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>Soon after, he began circulating the true war Dragon technique to recover.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming’s body was empty, without a trace of essential core.</p><p>The Qi cyclone in his dantian had completely stopped circulating and was motionless. Lu Ming continuously circulated the true war Dragon technique, but the Qi cyclone remained motionless.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not stop. He kept circulating the true war Dragon technique. An hour later, under Lu Ming’s persistent efforts, the cyclone finally moved and started to spin slowly.</p><p>Slowly, a wisp of quintessential essence was born from the vortex. It flowed through Lu Ming’s meridians and circulated throughout his body.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>With a wisp of true essence, things would be much easier.</p><p>Lu Ming took out a pile of top-grade spirit crystals and started to absorb the spiritual energy in them to speed up his recovery.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming recovered his essential core while healing his injuries.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.</p><p>Three days later, Lu Ming’s condition had recovered to its peak.</p><p>The injuries on his body had also healed.</p><p>Of course, the 50 years of life that he had lost could not be recovered.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged, playing with a blue jade card in his hand, deep in thought.</p><p>This Jade tablet was the one that recorded the location of the esoteric crystal vein that Saint Jade had mentioned.</p><p>Lu Ming had taken a look earlier. There was indeed a map inside. The location of the esoteric crystal vein was marked.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not rush there immediately.</p><p>“Is shengyu really that kind to tell me the location of the esoteric crystal vein? Even if it’s for the sake of my life, I have no choice but to be careful of any traps.”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
