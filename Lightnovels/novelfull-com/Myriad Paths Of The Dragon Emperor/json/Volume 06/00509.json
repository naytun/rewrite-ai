Is there something wrong with your head? do you think I’m a traitor just because I’m alive? What kind of warped logic was this? Do you want us all to die in battle before you’ll feel good? I now suspect that you are the traitor who colluded with the heavenly corpse sect and tried to harm us!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>“You’re making irresponsible remarks and slandering me!”</p><p>Sheng Kong roared.</p><p>At this moment, there were some people at the city gate who were attracted by the two’s voices and curiously watched.</p><p>The soldiers guarding the gate had obviously recognized the identity of Sheng Kong and the others, but they did not interfere.</p><p>“Slander? Hmph, if I remember correctly, you were beaten up by me in the eastern Palace, and then you returned to the central region. Not long after that, the news spread to the Eastern Region, and you specifically asked me to come to the central region to help. I now suspect that this was all a trap set by your Sheng family. You leaked the news to the heavenly corpse sect with the purpose of killing me, right?”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted. His aura was like a dragon as he closed in on Holy sky.</p><p>“You … You’re slandering me …”</p><p>Holy sky was stunned by Lu Ming’s aura and was almost speechless.</p><p>how dare you slander the Sheng family? you’re looking for death. Sheng Kong, get out of the way. Let me cripple him!</p><p>The tall young man stepped forward and looked at Lu Ming coldly. His eyes were like lightning.</p><p>A powerful aura exuded from the tall young man’s body. It was terrifying.</p><p>The peak of the third level of the martial King realm. This tall young man’s cultivation had already reached the peak of the third level of the martial King realm. Moreover, he was not an ordinary peak of the third level of the martial King realm. He was definitely a genius among the martial Kings.</p><p>“Who’s that kid? I’ve never seen him before. How dare he offend the Sheng family?”</p><p>“I just faintly heard that they seemed to be coming from the eastern Palace.”</p><p>“What? How dare the people of the eastern Palace offend the people of the Sheng family? they are simply too audacious and are courting death.”</p><p>“I heard that kid say that shengkong suffered a loss at his hands in the eastern Palace a while ago? I don’t think that kid is easy to deal with!”</p><p>“Not a good person? So what if he defeated Sheng Kong? Shengkong is just one of the many direct descendants of the Sheng family. Shengfeng is much stronger than him.”</p><p>On the side, the onlookers were whispering to each other.</p><p>“Brat, are you going to kneel down and cripple yourself, or do you want me to do it? if I do, you’re going to suffer.”</p><p>Shengfeng was tall, half a head taller than Lu Ming. He looked down at Lu Ming with a cold and arrogant expression.</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips. The people of the Sheng family were probably used to being overlords in the Tianxuan region. Every one of them had the same conduct.</p><p>I advise you to get lost. You probably don’t know how badly I beat up shengkong in the East. Be careful that you don’t end up like him.</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at Shengfeng indifferently and said.</p><p>“Arrogant! You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Shengfeng shouted.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Holy Wind took a step forward like a giant beast, and the earth rumbled.</p><p>Then, he struck out with his palm!</p><p>“Kneel down!”</p><p>The spiritual Qi of heaven and earth gathered and formed a palm print, which slammed down on Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>Even an ordinary peak Lv 3 martial King realm expert would not dare to take this attack head-on.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A light flashed in Lu Ming’s hands and a long spear was formed. He then pulled it out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The spear struck the palm print, and the palm print instantly collapsed.</p><p>“You’re the one kneeling!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward. The long spear in his hand grew to tens of meters long and as thick as a water tank. He smashed it down on the Holy Wind’s head.</p><p>Shengfeng’s expression changed. Clearly, he did not expect Lu Ming to be able to destroy his palm print so easily.</p><p>you have some ability, but this is not enough in front of me!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Shengfeng coldly snorted. A 10-meter-tall bear appeared above his head. This bear was covered in scales, and a fierce aura filled the air.</p><p>At the same time, six silver chakras on the bear’s body were shining.</p><p>The next moment, the giant bear rushed into Shengfeng’s body, making his burly body swell up again.</p><p>“Earth overturning palm!”</p><p>The Holy Wind leaped high into the air and slammed its palm down on Lu Ming.</p><p>“True dragon Strike!”</p><p>Lu Ming thrust his spear upwards and a three-colored true dragon flew out with an imposing aura.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming’s will of wind had already condensed into an intent rune, which made the power of the three absolutes of the Dragon God even stronger.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The three-colored true dragon broke through the Holy Wind’s attack in one fell swoop, and the remaining power continued to bombard the Holy Wind.</p><p>Shengfeng screamed. His body was sent flying like a cannonball. He flew up to a hundred meters in the air and then free-fell under the effect of the no-fly formation.</p><p>“Catch me, catch me quickly!”</p><p>Shengfeng was screaming in the air.</p><p>Sheng Kong and another young man wanted to catch the Holy Wind.</p><p>However, Lu Ming held his long spear horizontally and blocked the two of them.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The other young man shouted, but he did not dare to make a move. His cultivation was only at the early stage of the third level of the martial King realm, far inferior to Shengfeng’s. It was obvious that he was no match for Lu Ming.</p><p>As for Sheng Kong, his face was already pale, and his face was filled with disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming had become stronger again. A few months ago, he was definitely not this strong when he was in the eastern Palace.</p><p>Even the Holy Wind, which had reached the peak of the third level of the martial King realm, could not fight back against Lu Ming.</p><p>How did this happen?</p><p>Bang!</p><p>With this slight delay, Holy Wind directly hit the ground.</p><p>The ground at the city entrance was the same as the city walls of Tianxuan city. They were both left behind from the ancient era and were extremely hard, a few hundred times harder than steel.</p><p>Shengfeng’s face hit the ground heavily, making a sound that made one’s teeth ache.</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere, and everyone could even see seven or eight teeth in the blood.</p><p>ah, ah, little bastard, I’m going to kill you!</p><p>Shengfeng struggled to get up and shouted frantically.</p><p>He was a peak Lv 3 martial King realm genius, but he had been seriously injured from the fall. This was a great humiliation. From now on, no matter how glorious his achievements were, this would be a stain on his body. He would become a laughing stock that would never be washed away.</p><p>The anger in his heart could burn the nine Heavens.</p><p>But what welcomed him was a long spear.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A long spear directly hit one side of his face. His body flew out directly, and the other side of his face heavily smashed onto the floor.</p><p>Blood spurted out and teeth flew everywhere.</p><p>Shengfeng was dumbfounded, completely dumbfounded, and so were the others.</p><p>Lu Ming was really ruthless. He had not even finished his sentence and he had already taken action.</p><p>This time, Shengfeng was twitching on the ground. He couldn’t get up at all.</p><p>Sheng Kong and the other young man from the Sheng family broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out his hand and sucked Shengfeng’s storage ring into his hand, putting it away without any hesitation.</p><p>Now, he was extremely lacking in resources. How could he miss such a good opportunity?</p><p>I’ll let you go if each of you hands over 50000 top-grade spiritual crystals. Hurry up and take the spiritual crystals!</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Holy sky and the other young man and shouted coldly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
