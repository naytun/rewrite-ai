No matter how talented he is, he can’t pose a threat to me. How can he make me feel threatened?’ Could it be that he has some sort of treasure on him?”</p><p>...</p><p>Thunder Palace master’s mind turned quickly, and his eyes became vigilant.</p><p>“This little bastard must be killed today. His talent is too amazing. If this continues, I’m afraid I’ll be the one who dies the next time we meet.”</p><p>Thunder Palace master’s eyes turned cold, and he was about to make his move.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, two earth-shaking roars sounded, and the earth trembled violently.</p><p>An ocean-like pressure suddenly pressed down.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Thunder Palace master’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>“Not good.” Lu Ming’s heart trembled.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, dust and wind filled the air. Two huge creatures appeared not far away and were in the middle of a frenzied battle.</p><p>It was a huge black Tiger. It was definitely more than 100 meters tall and 300 to 400 meters long. It was like a small mountain.</p><p>It was fighting with a giant ape that looked very similar to the one Lu Ming had seen before. It was extremely tall.</p><p>The two giant beasts fought wildly, rolling over and over as they rolled toward Lu Ming and the rest at top speed.</p><p>Thunder Palace master’s expression changed drastically, and he turned to run.</p><p>Lu Ming was the same.</p><p>They had just run a thousand meters when the place where they had been fighting was crushed by two giant beasts. The ancient trees were broken, and the place was in a mess.</p><p>The strong wind swept and almost blew Lu Ming away.</p><p>Lu Ming cast the concept of wind and ran with the help of the power of the strong wind. His speed was even faster.</p><p>The master of thunder Palace could not care about killing Lu Ming now. Escaping was more important.</p><p>The two giant beasts were too terrifying. Thunder Palace Master had no doubt that if he was hit by the palm, he would definitely die.</p><p>The two of them ran for their lives.</p><p>Roar! OWW!</p><p>The battle between the two giant beasts shocked the other demonic beasts and they also ran for their lives. The mountain forest was in chaos.</p><p>Bang Bang Bang!</p><p>A woolly mammoth that was tens of meters tall ran past Lu Ming and almost trampled him flat.</p><p>This woolly mammoth definitely had the strength of a peak-tier King.</p><p>“This is a good opportunity!”</p><p>The nine Dragons used the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps, and in a flash, they grabbed the long fur on the mammoth’s tail and climbed into the long fur inside the tail to hide.</p><p>The long fur on the mammoth’s tail was seven to eight meters long. Lu Ming could not be seen at all as he hid inside.</p><p>The two giant beasts continued to fight, rolling and rolling, without a fixed direction. Not long after, Lu Ming heard that the roar was getting further and further away from the mammoth.</p><p>In the distance, the Thunder Palace master’s eyes swept across the area, and he was extremely gloomy.</p><p>“That little bastard ran away again.”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master snorted coldly, then left carefully.</p><p>Lu Ming did not know how much time had passed. He estimated that he had run at least tens of thousands of miles. At this moment, the mammoth’s speed slowed down.</p><p>Lu Ming restrained his aura and slipped down from the long mammoth’s tail.</p><p>“Eh? Could it be that we’re almost out of the forest?”</p><p>Lu Ming realized that the trees around him were much smaller and not as huge as the previous one.</p><p>Lu Ming followed one direction and advanced for thousands of miles. He realized that they had indeed left the forest.</p><p>In front of them were mountain peaks and mountain ranges.</p><p>The mountain forest from before was relatively flat, and there were almost no mountains.</p><p>However, there were only mountain peaks ahead.</p><p>what is this place? other than demonic beasts, there’s not a single person here. I don’t see any other races either.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He then retracted his aura and ran toward the mountains.</p><p>Fortunately, Lu Ming did not encounter any powerful demonic beasts on these mountains. If there were, they were rather weak.</p><p>“Could it be that all the powerful demonic beasts are in that forest?”</p><p>Lu Ming relaxed slightly. He then flew high into the sky and sped up.</p><p>“Wait, what’s that?”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming stopped and flew back, landing on a small mountain peak.</p><p>“This is … Power Upanishad crystal vein?”</p><p>Lu Ming sensed it carefully and realized that the mountain peak was exuding a strong aura.</p><p>Moreover, it was the aura of wind concept.</p><p>This was actually a wind-type intent crystal mine.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>There would be at least several hundred pieces of intent crystals in the intent crystal vein, and there might even be mid-grade intent crystals.</p><p>Most importantly, they were wind-type esoteric crystals. With these crystals, Lu Ming’s concept of wind would improve rapidly.</p><p>Digging!</p><p>Lu Ming started to dig crazily.</p><p>Three hours later, the entire small mountain peak had been excavated by Lu Ming.</p><p>The harvest was rich.</p><p>There were a total of three hundred and thirty low-grade wind attribute intent crystals. Most importantly, there were two mid-grade wind attribute intent crystals.</p><p>A total of two middle-grade wind attribute intent crystals.</p><p>“Haha, I’m rich!”</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to burst out laughing.</p><p>this place is full of treasures. Keep searching. See if there are any other power Upanishad crystal veins.</p><p>Lu Ming started to search around frantically.</p><p>Indeed, there were no more powerful demonic beasts on this piece of land. Lu Ming increased his speed. Soon, he discovered a small profound meaning crystal mine tens of thousands of miles away.</p><p>haha, it’s another intent crystal vein. Previously, in that forest, it was a pit of intent crystals. Now, it’s an intent crystal vein. We’re rich, we’re rich!</p><p>Lu Ming was in an extremely good mood. He was initially a little depressed because he had entered this inexplicable place. However, all his depression was swept away at this moment.</p><p>This esoteric crystal vein was a gold-attribute esoteric crystal vein. In the end, Lu Ming had excavated more than four hundred gold-attribute esoteric crystals and two mid-grade gold-attribute esoteric crystals.</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not stop at all.</p><p>Half an hour later, Lu Ming stopped on a mountain peak and frowned slightly.</p><p>The mountain below had been completely excavated. From the faint intent realm aura that permeated the air, it must be a small power Upanishad crystal mine.</p><p>But it was discovered by others.</p><p>“I wonder if they’re from the heavenly corpse sect!”</p><p>This time, the majority of the people who had entered were from the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>“It seems like I have to be more careful!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved and he left the place.</p><p>An hour later, he stopped in front of a mountain peak and revealed a look of ecstasy.</p><p>This mountain was suffused with the lightning intent of powerful lightning, and it was a lightning-type intent crystal mine.</p><p>It just so happened that Lu Ming had a use for the Thunder-type esoteric crystals.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming started to dig.</p><p>haha, we’re so lucky. Another power Upanishad crystal lode. We’re going to be rich this time.</p><p>Lu Ming had not dug twice when a cold and dry voice was heard.</p><p>Hu! Hu!</p><p>Two coffins flew over, and six figures walked out of them.</p><p>Two corpse guards and six refined corpses.</p><p>Their bodies exuded a powerful aura.</p><p>late stage King tiers! They’re all late stage King tiers!</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>This time, the heavenly corpse sect had sent about a dozen King tiers of the upper tier into this place. Unexpectedly, Lu Ming had encountered two of them.</p><p>“Brat, you’re from the Xuan family, and you’re also from the Ditian Divine Guard. It’s your bad luck to have run into us. Hand over your storage ring obediently, and we’ll leave your corpse intact!”</p><p>One of the corpse guards sneered.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
