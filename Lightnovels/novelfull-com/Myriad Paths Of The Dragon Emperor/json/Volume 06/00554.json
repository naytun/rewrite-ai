How can you be hindered by love when you’re doing great things? ”</p><p>...</p><p>Xuan Yuan nodded and continued, ” the heavenly corpse sect only used 300 years to expand to its current strength. It’s extremely powerful. In my opinion, it won’t be long before the heavenly corpse sect’s strength surpasses the Emperor heaven divine Palace. The weapon forging sect and the Emperor heaven divine Palace are bound together. They will be destroyed by the heavenly corpse sect sooner or later. How can we die with the weapon forging sect? ”</p><p>now, the heavenly corpse sect has taken a fancy to a treasure in the weapon forging sect. They’re going to start taking action soon. At that time, we’ll work with the heavenly corpse sect from the inside and defeat the weapon forging sect with one strike. We’ll be the heavenly corpse sect’s heroes.</p><p>“A few more days? But Lu Ming, that little b * stard, will be leaving after he gets the thousand refined blood gold tomorrow.”</p><p>Xuan Zhong said.</p><p>“How about this? after Lu Ming leaves tomorrow, ask your senior brother to go with you. Kill Lu Ming on the way and take back the thousand refined blood gold!”</p><p>Xuan Yuan said.</p><p>“Yes, master!”</p><p>The strong man in his thirties responded.</p><p>haha, good. Senior brother’s cultivation has already reached the peak of the sixth level of the martial King realm. With senior brother’s help, it’s more than enough to kill Lu Ming!</p><p>Xuan Zhong laughed.</p><p>Immediately after, the few of them began to conspire again.</p><p>……</p><p>The night passed quickly.</p><p>The next day, Xuan long sent a Messenger.</p><p>Considering that Lu Ming had been back in Tianxuan city for a long time and the thousand-refined blood gold was not used for a long time, Xuan long and the rest planned to inscribe a layer of seal on the thousand-refined blood gold to seal its spirituality so that it would not lose its spirituality over time.</p><p>Therefore, it would take some time. It would probably be in the evening.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He did not care and continued to wait.</p><p>As expected, in the evening, Xuan long asked someone to bring Lu Ming to the meeting hall.</p><p>He came to the meeting hall and saw Xuan long and Xuan Xiang.</p><p>There were only the two of them here.</p><p>little brother, sorry to keep you waiting. That’s the thousand refined blood gold!</p><p>Xuan long said with a smile. After which, he pointed to the middle of the hall and said.</p><p>“You’re too kind, sect master Xuan!”</p><p>Lu Ming said, then looked to the middle of the hall.</p><p>In the middle of the hall, there was a piece of dark red metal.</p><p>This piece of metal had been polished until it was squarish, with a length, width, and height of half a meter.</p><p>On it, there were thousands of veined patterns that looked like tree rings.</p><p>There was a layer of inscriptions shining on the surface of the thousand refined blood gold. It must have been an inscription formation set up by Xuan long and the others to prevent the loss of its spirituality.</p><p>This was the thousand refined blood gold.</p><p>Lu Ming walked over to pick it up and his expression changed slightly.</p><p>This thousand refined blood gold was extremely heavy.</p><p>little brother, the thousand-refined blood gold is forged using the weapon forging sect’s Secret technique. It needs to be forged a thousand times, and each time, precious metals and demon beast blood essence are added. After three years, this piece of thousand-refined blood gold weighs 99900 Jin!</p><p>Xuan long laughed and was quite proud.</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked. This piece of thousand-refined blood gold weighed almost one million pounds.</p><p>Moreover, the process was so complicated, which showed how precious it was.</p><p>Lu Ming expressed his gratitude once again. He then kept the thousand refined blood gold in his storage ring.</p><p>“Lord Lu Ming, please come to the weapon forging sect more often in the future. I still have many questions to ask you.”</p><p>Xuan Xiang said with some reluctance.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“You little girl, you only think about going out and adventuring all day, but you don’t know how dangerous it is outside!”</p><p>Xuan long laughed and scolded.</p><p>Grandmaster Xuan, miss Xuan Xiang, take care. If there’s a chance, come find me in Tianxuan city.</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and bade farewell to Xuan long and Xuan Xiang. He then left the weapon forging sect and soared into the sky, flying in the direction of Tianxuan city.</p><p>He had finally obtained the thousand refined blood gold. Lu Ming could not wait to rush back to Tianxuan city so that he could go into seclusion to comprehend the concept of wind.</p><p>Once his wind mentality reached level one small success, it would be on par with the Thunder and fire mentality. Then, his cultivation would be able to continue improving.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, tens of thousands of miles had been covered. At this time, the sky had completely darkened.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>All of a sudden, a pale-white saber gleam in front of him slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed slightly. His body flashed and he dodged the saber gleam.</p><p>In front of them, two figures appeared, Walking in the Air and walking towards them.</p><p>“Xuan Zhong!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold.</p><p>One of them was Xuan Zhong, while the other was a brawny man in his thirties.</p><p>“Hehe, Lu Ming, let’s see where you can run to now. Go to hell. The thousand-refined blood gold is mine!”</p><p>Xuan Zhong sneered.</p><p>“Xuan Zhong, you really don’t want to give up. I originally wanted to spare your life for Xuan Xiang’s sake, but you just had to come to die!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold.</p><p>“You’re talking big. My father sent a senior brother here, so you’re dead. Also, don’t mention that bitch Xuan Xiang in front of me. That b * tch is just a b * tch. And that old man Xuan long, in two days, I want them all dead, dead!”</p><p>Xuan Zhong’s face was extremely ferocious.</p><p>“What do you want to do to sect master Xuan and the others?” Lu Ming’s face changed as he chided.</p><p>“Hehe, what are you doing? When you’re all in hell, you can discuss it together. Senior brother, kill him!”</p><p>Xuan Zhong roared.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The brawny man was walking in the void, exuding an extremely powerful aura. Every step he took in the void made a banging sound.</p><p>peak Lv 6 martial King realm!</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, my senior brother has reached the peak of the sixth level martial King realm. He’s only one step away from breaking through to the king tier upper tier. Accept your death!”</p><p>Xuan Zhong laughed excitedly.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The brawny man shouted as his muscles bulged and he slashed out.</p><p>The saber ray was mighty, and the air in the sky was split in half, bringing with it a gust of wind.</p><p>In an instant, the terrifying Saber Light was about to hit Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>At this moment, a long spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hand and he held it horizontally above his head.</p><p>Clang! The saber radiance struck the spear shaft, and energy shot out in all directions.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s body was like an archaic divine mountain. He did not move an inch.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Xuan Zhong’s and the brawny man’s faces changed dramatically.</p><p>“Peak Lv 6 martial King realm? He he he!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and stepped forward with his long spear in hand.</p><p>“Mountain-splitting slash!”</p><p>The brawny man roared and slashed again with all his strength.</p><p>This slash was twice as powerful as the previous one.</p><p>This was the brawny man’s most powerful attack.</p><p>But the next moment, he was in despair.</p><p>Lu Ming swept his long spear and the saber gleam collapsed, turning into nothingness.</p><p>“Not good, Junior Brother, run!”</p><p>The brawny man’s expression turned extremely ugly as he roared.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming became one with the spear and cast a Gokudo path attack. The Spear’s gleam flashed and blood shot out.</p><p>The brawny man’s glabella was pierced through.</p><p>Then, the devouring power burst out and devoured the brawny man’s blood essence.</p><p>“No, no, how could this be?”</p><p>Xuan Zhong was so frightened that he almost cried. He ran madly towards the weapon forging sect.</p><p>Lu Ming was simply a monster. Even a peak Lv 6 martial King realm expert was easily killed by him. He was not human at all.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
