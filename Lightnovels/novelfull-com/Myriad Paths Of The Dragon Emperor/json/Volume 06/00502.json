Bang!</p><p>Pieces of top-grade spiritual crystals exploded like fireworks, and rich spiritual Qi filled the air. They were all swallowed by the nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>The majestic energy turned into rolling essential core and Lu Ming began to break through to the second level of the martial King realm.</p><p>Not long after, he had refined all 20000 pieces of top-grade spirit crystals. Lu Ming took out another 20000 pieces.</p><p>soon, soon. I’m just one step away from breaking through to the second level of the martial King realm.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming waved his hand and took out 30000 pieces of top-grade spiritual crystals.</p><p>30,000 pieces of spiritual crystals of the highest quality contained an extremely terrifying amount of energy. It was about to break through to the second level of the martial King realm.</p><p>Half a day later-</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a loud boom, Lu Ming’s aura rose several times. He had broken through to the second level of the martial King realm.</p><p>what a powerful primordial Qi! It’s three times stronger than a Lv 1 martial King realm martial artist.</p><p>Lu Ming felt the vast essential core in his body and pondered.</p><p>It was no wonder that the gap between each level of the martial King realm was so huge.</p><p>now, I only have 10000 Supreme spiritual crystals left. This is a huge expense.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed with emotion.</p><p>Of course, this was only for him. If other people were to cultivate, they would definitely not need so many top-grade spiritual crystals.</p><p>Moreover, it was also because Lu Ming’s Thunder concept had long reached level one lower tier that he could break through his cultivation without any worries.</p><p>Most people had to work hard to comprehend the essence realm of heaven and earth. With every step forward, their cultivation would improve. Lu Ming’s essence realm of heaven and earth had improved by so much in one go.</p><p>if only I had enough top-grade spiritual crystals. My cultivation could rise all the way to Lv 4 martial King realm and become a King tier lower tier!</p><p>Lu Ming was thinking in his heart.</p><p>However, he immediately shook his head.</p><p>If he needed so many spiritual crystals to advance to Lv 1 martial King realm, then the number of spiritual crystals needed to advance to Lv 2 and Lv 3 martial King realm would definitely reach a terrifying number.</p><p>looks like I’ll have to find ways to get more resources later on.</p><p>also, this dandan, ever since she ate the heavenly Tribulation last time, she hasn’t made any movements. I wonder how she’s doing? ”</p><p>Lu Ming picked up dandan that was hanging in his hair and took a closer look.</p><p>If it were not for the layer of crystal luster on the egg shell and the life force emanating from the stone egg, Lu Ming was really afraid that something would happen to him.</p><p>After all, it had just eaten a Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s expression changed. He waved his hand and a Jade box appeared on the ground.</p><p>There were two pitch-black branches in the jade box.</p><p>And half a box of spring water.</p><p>There was originally a box of clear spring water, but now, only half of it was left.</p><p>One of the two pitch-black withered branches that were soaked in the spring actually had a tender shoot growing out of it.</p><p>That’s right, one of the withered branches actually came alive. A stretch of tender shoot grew out, and on the tender shoot, there were spots of light shining, making the tender shoot look crystal clear.</p><p>However, what surprised Lu Ming the most was that there was a mysterious aura emanating from this bud. Under this aura, Lu Ming’s mind was exceptionally clear. It was as if he had abandoned everything and was immersed in the great Dao of heaven and earth.</p><p>In the past, he was actually able to quickly figure out some of the things he didn’t understand about martial arts.</p><p>Enlightenment. In this state, Lu Ming seemed to be in enlightenment.</p><p>amazing, this is too amazing. Just what is the origin of this withered branch? it’s just a tender shoot, but it can actually help people comprehend the Dao.</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely shocked.</p><p>now, I’ll try to comprehend the essence realm of heaven and earth!</p><p>At once, Lu Ming closed his eyes and began to comprehend the concept of wind.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming could feel that his understanding of the wind concept was very clear. The speed of comprehension was at least ten times faster than before.</p><p>“Oh my God, this is too magical.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were fixed on the tender shoot.</p><p>It was then that Lu Ming noticed that there were wondrous lines on the tender shoot. They looked like true dragons, phoenixes, Qilin, and other ancient mythical beasts.</p><p>It was extremely profound.</p><p>according to the legends, there was a kind of spiritual root in the primitive times called the path-understanding spiritual root. This kind of spiritual root would grow into spiritual trees of various shapes. These spiritual trees were collectively called the path-understanding ancient tree. It was said that in the primitive times, the most powerful people in the world would plant a path-understanding ancient tree beside them to help with their cultivation. Could it be that this withered branch fell from one of the path-understanding ancient trees? ”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly thought of a legend.</p><p>At the thought of this legend, Lu Ming’s heart burned with passion.</p><p>“Is it true? If it’s true, then I’m going to be rich.”</p><p>Lu Ming found it hard to believe.</p><p>After all, the path-understanding ancient tree was too rare. In the primordial age, only the most powerful people in the world could control one.</p><p>Every one of those powerhouses was unbelievably powerful. The current Martial Emperor was like an ant in front of those powerhouses.</p><p>“It’s a secret. I must keep it a secret. No matter if it’s true or not, I can’t let anyone know. Otherwise, I’ll be dead for sure.”</p><p>Lu Ming knew very well that if this section was really the path-understanding ancient tree, the entire divine wilderness continent would go into a riot. Those martial Royal realm experts would definitely do whatever it took to seize the path-understanding ancient tree.</p><p>Now, it had only grown one bud and it could increase Lu Ming’s comprehension speed by ten times. What if it grew two, three or more?</p><p>How much help would it be to Lu Ming?</p><p>Lu Ming quickly put the jade box into the Supreme shrine and entered it.</p><p>regardless of whether it’s the real path-understanding ancient tree or not, it’s a fact that it can increase the speed of comprehension by ten times. Just this point alone is priceless. Haha, I’m rich!</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming began to comprehend various martial arts techniques.</p><p>As expected, under the mysterious aura of the tender shoot, Lu Ming’s mind became extremely clear. Regardless of whether it was comprehending martial arts techniques or the concept of heaven and earth, his speed had increased by about ten times.</p><p>cultivate, start cultivating!</p><p>Lu Ming placed the jade box beside him and started to comprehend the concept of wind.</p><p>He planned to first condense the wind concept into concept runes.</p><p>For his attacks, he temporarily had the Thunder concept. As long as he could condense the wind concept into a concept rune, his speed would increase by a large margin.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, three days had passed. Lu Ming’s comprehension of the concept of wind had improved rapidly. It was equivalent to the results of a month’s comprehension in the past.</p><p>However, Lu Ming still felt that he was too slow.</p><p>if I use this Dao Comprehension ancient tree in the Dao Comprehension Palace and combine it with that intent, wouldn’t my comprehension speed be even faster? ”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but think.</p><p>Regardless of whether this was the real path-understanding ancient tree or not, Lu Ming simply called it the path-understanding ancient tree. He did not call it for any other reason but to feel good.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately set off for the Dao enlightenment Palace.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
