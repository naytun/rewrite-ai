It would be impossible to kill a Lv 4 martial King realm corpse guard unless it was caught off guard and a sneak attack.</p><p>...</p><p>But even if it was a sneak attack, it wasn’t easy, because the corpse guards spent most of their time hiding in coffins.</p><p>Also, if one’s strength was overwhelming, one could kill the other party with great strength.</p><p>Shengchuan’s face was even more smug.</p><p>the total reward is 91000 top-grade spiritual crystals. These are the spiritual crystals. Please check them!</p><p>The old man at the counter took out a Jade box and handed it to shengchuan.</p><p>The surrounding people became even more envious. 90000 Supreme spiritual crystals! For an ordinary low rank King, this was definitely a huge amount. It was just a single task, but they could actually earn 90000 Supreme spiritual crystals. This was truly terrifying.</p><p>“There’s no need to light it!”</p><p>Shengchuan was very generous. He took the jade box and put it into his storage ring. Then, he looked at Lu Ming proudly and said loudly, ” “See, this is my harvest. I sealed the souls of twenty-one corpse guards. Actually, this isn’t much. I believe that I will definitely have an even greater harvest next time. However, for you, this is an unattainable height.”</p><p>Shengchuan looked at Lu Ming with great contempt.</p><p>At the side, Sheng Yao and Sheng Wushuang were sneering at Lu Ming. They were very pleased to see Lu Ming lose face in public.</p><p>“It’s just this little bit, and you have the nerve to take it out and embarrass yourself? Hurry up and scram to the side, let me do it. ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s face was calm as he glanced at shengchuan and said indifferently. The disdain in his tone was extremely obvious.</p><p>“You … What did you just say? I’m such a disgrace! Damn it! Can you take out more soul-sealing crystals?”</p><p>Shengchuan’s eyes were burning with fire as he roared.</p><p>The surrounding onlookers also looked at Lu Ming curiously. What made Lu Ming so confident?</p><p>Could it be that Lu Ming’s harvest was greater than the holy river?</p><p>“Take it out. Hurry up and take it out. If you can’t take it out today, I will make you swallow the words you said just now …”</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>Shengchuan was originally shouting angrily, but the next moment, Lu Ming waved his hand and a large pile of soul-sealing crystals on the counter clattered, making shengchuan’s shouting stop abruptly.</p><p>Sheng Chuan’s eyes were as big as copper bells, staring at the large pile of soul-sealing crystals on the counter, his lips trembling.</p><p>All around, the other onlookers were similar. Each and every one of their eyes almost popped out as they stared at the pile of soul-sealing crystals on the counter in disbelief.</p><p>Sheng Yao and Sheng Wushuang had similar expressions. They were dumbfounded.</p><p>“It’s fake! It’s definitely fake! Lu Ming, the souls of the sky corpse sect’s corpse guards are definitely not sealed inside. Lu Ming, are you using the souls of demonic beasts or hunting ordinary Warriors to seal their souls to cheat for rewards? How dare you! Lu Ming, you’ve committed a heinous crime that deserves to be executed!”</p><p>At this moment, shengchuan came to his senses. He pointed at Lu Ming and roared.</p><p>He immediately pinned the blame of killing ordinary martial artists to obtain rewards on Lu Ming.</p><p>Around them, the way the others looked at Lu Ming had changed. Some of them believed shengchuan’s words.</p><p>After all, the pile that Lu Ming had taken out was too much. There were at least more than a hundred pieces. Could Lu Ming kill more than a hundred corpse guards? How was that possible?</p><p>“Idiot!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently. He looked at shengchuan as if he was looking at a fool. F * ck.</p><p>This made shengchuan’s chest ache, and he almost vomited blood.</p><p>“What did you just say? What did you just say?”</p><p>Shengchuan shouted angrily.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with him. He could not even be bothered to look at him. He turned to the old man at the counter and said,”Senior, please help me check, so that I won’t be wronged!”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The old man at the counter picked up the soul sealing Jade plates and started to check them one by one.</p><p>At the scene, everyone’s eyes turned to the old man.</p><p>Shengchuan, in particular, wished that the elder would say that Lu Ming’s soul-sealing crystals were fake.</p><p>Unfortunately, he was destined to be disappointed.</p><p>The old man started to check the pieces seriously.</p><p>Slowly, the old man’s face revealed a look of surprise. Then, the more he checked, the more surprised he was.</p><p>After half an hour, the elder finally finished checking all of Lu Ming’s soul-sealing crystals.</p><p>Everyone was staring at the old man, waiting for his answer.</p><p>“A total of one hundred and ten pieces, all of which seal the souls of the sky corpse sect’s corpse guards. That’s right!”</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>As soon as the old man finished speaking, the entire place went into an uproar.</p><p>“They are all the souls of the sky corpse sect’s corpse guards, how is this possible?”</p><p>this Lu Ming, what exactly is his cultivation level? to actually be able to kill so many corpse guards, this is too unbelievable.</p><p>I heard that Lu Ming came from the East to provide reinforcements. When he entered the city, he had a conflict with Sheng Jiang of the Sheng family. I heard that his cultivation is at Lv 2 martial King realm.</p><p>“Lv 2 martial King realm? You’re joking, right? A Lv 2 martial King could kill so many corpse guards and seal their souls. Unless he was extremely lucky and all the corpse guards he encountered along the way were at Lv 1 martial King realm, and they were all alone, how could he have killed so many corpse guards?”</p><p>The crowd’s disbelieving discussion came from all around.</p><p>Shengchuan’s eyes also widened in shock.</p><p>All 110 pieces of soul-sealing crystal stones had sealed the souls of the corpse guards. Even if they were all Lv 1 martial King realm, the reward he received was much more than his.</p><p>The old man at the counter announced.</p><p>“A total of one hundred and ten pieces, all of which have the souls of the sky corpse sect’s corpse guards sealed inside.”</p><p>among them, Lv 1 martial King realm has the most, fifty-five pieces. Lv 2 martial King realm has thirty pieces, Lv 3 martial King realm has nineteen pieces, Lv 4 martial King realm has ten pieces, Lv 5 martial King realm has three pieces, and Lv 6 martial King realm has two pieces.</p><p>in total, the reward is 880000 best spiritual crystals!</p><p>The old man’s eyes were also filled with amazement.</p><p>Ever since this mission was issued, this was the first time someone had received so many rewards.</p><p>Silence!</p><p>The scene was silent.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes and mouth were wide open as they looked at Lu Ming in a daze.</p><p>A reward of 880000 Supreme spiritual crystals?</p><p>There were even ten level four martial King realm martial arts, three level five martial King realm martial arts, and even two level six martial King realm martial arts.</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>They thought they were dreaming.</p><p>impossible, impossible, impossible!</p><p>Shengchuan was completely stunned. He couldn’t stop trembling and mumbling. He couldn’t believe what he was seeing.</p><p>what’s impossible? I’ve been working in the hall of mission for 300 years and I’ve never made a mistake. You’re suspecting me.</p><p>The old man at the counter glared at him.</p><p>The old man’s words woke everyone up.</p><p>“Heavens, what did I just see? The reward of 880000 top quality spiritual crystals is terrifying.”</p><p>there are fifteen pieces for King tiers and above. How did he do it? ”</p><p>the holy river’s LV 4 martial King realm piece is really trash in comparison.</p><p>The surroundings were in an uproar as waves of discussions broke out.</p><p>Many people even stopped submitting their missions and came to watch the show.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
