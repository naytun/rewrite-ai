Then, they looked at the strong man in shock.</p><p>...</p><p>Could this person be a major character in the Emperor heaven divine Palace?</p><p>Otherwise, why would the White hair Palace Master, a regional Palace Master with spiritual ocean tier cultivation, be so respectful to him?</p><p>The robust man casually glanced at the white-haired Palace Master, took a sip of wine, and said indifferently, ” “Look over there first, look over there first!”</p><p>He pointed at the battle between Lu Ming and Qin Qingshan and continued to watch with interest.</p><p>White hair Palace Master did not dare to say anything and started watching.</p><p>The palace Masters ‘expressions changed.</p><p>“A peak Lv 9 martial King has such combat strength. Who is this man? I don’t have such a person in the great domain. Where did he come from?”</p><p>The White hair Palace Master could not help but say.</p><p>“Hehe, I heard that kid is from the Tianxuan region. How is it? You’re pretty strong, aren’t you?”</p><p>The robust man chuckled.</p><p>so, you’re from the same place as Lord Yan. The Tianxuan region is really full of talents.</p><p>The white-haired Palace Master sighed and conveniently flattered.</p><p>As for the other people on the side, they seemed to have thought of something. Their expressions changed drastically, and they looked at the strong man with eyes full of respect.</p><p>Lu Ming and Qin Qingshan did not know about any of this. Their battle had already reached the point of white heat.</p><p>Qin Qingshan had used all his strength without holding back.</p><p>He had to defeat Lu Ming today.</p><p>However, although Lu Ming was at a disadvantage, he was extremely tenacious and was forcibly held back by him.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming seemed to be getting more courageous as the battle progressed.</p><p>“Awesome, awesome. I’m getting better at controlling my own power.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>At this moment, the two of them had already exchanged more than a hundred moves.</p><p>Although Qin Qingshan was strong, he couldn’t do anything to him.</p><p>Lu Ming now had a better idea of the combat strength of the top 1000 talents of the eastern barren territory, or at least, the last few.</p><p>The sacred constellation was ranked ahead of Qin Qingshan, but it was only one rank higher. Even if it was stronger than Qin Qingshan, there was a limit to its strength.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a loud boom, the two of them were sent flying backward.</p><p>Lu Ming retreated two hundred meters while Qin Qingshan retreated one hundred and fifty meters.</p><p>“That’s right, let’s end this battle here!”</p><p>At this moment, the strong man spoke.</p><p>Qin Qingshan took a casual glance and couldn’t be bothered to pay attention to him. He roared and was about to rush toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Qingshan, stop!”</p><p>let’s go! Deputy Palace Master Qin shouted and waved his hand. A force appeared in front of Qin Qingshan.</p><p>“Father, why are you stopping me? Today, I will definitely destroy him!”</p><p>Qin Qingshan roared.</p><p>If he could not completely defeat Lu Ming in today’s battle, his reputation would definitely be greatly affected.</p><p>He was already at the bottom of the list, and it would be hard for him to accept the fact that he would fall out of the list the next time it was re-arranged.</p><p>“Qingshan, I told you to stop, so stop!”</p><p>Deputy Palace Lord Qin’s face darkened as he berated.</p><p>Qin Qingshan’s expression changed. His father rarely lost his temper at him. What was going on today?</p><p>Then, he looked around and saw the white-haired Princess standing respectfully beside the man. His eyes flashed as if he had thought of something. He looked at Lu Ming unwillingly, then went to vice Palace Master Qin’s side.</p><p>“Haha, it’s over. I’ll be leaving then!”</p><p>The man got up and stretched. With a wave of his hand, the chair on the ground disappeared. He strode toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Little brat, follow me!”</p><p>The muscular man said to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Leave with you?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and his face darkened.</p><p>To be honest, he didn’t have a good impression of this strong man. If it wasn’t for him, how could the inter-province transportation formation be destroyed?</p><p>“Brat, didn’t you want to return to the Tianxuan region? I’ll send you back.”</p><p>The muscular man said.</p><p>“You … Do you have a way to send me back to the Tianxuan region?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>“What’s wrong? You don’t believe me? It just so happens that I’m going back to the Tianxuan region as well, so it’s fine if I take you back with me. ”</p><p>The robust man drank a mouthful of wine and said.</p><p>“I do, I do!”</p><p>Lu Ming said hurriedly.</p><p>He had seen how the white-haired Palace Master and the others were respectful to this man. This man must have an extraordinary identity. Perhaps he really had a way. Lu Ming could only hold on to a glimmer of hope.</p><p>“Senior, wait for me!”</p><p>Lu Ming called out and flew towards flying snow.</p><p>Fei Xue’s beautiful eyes were filled with radiance. Lu Ming’s power had exceeded her expectations.</p><p>If he could fight against Qin Qingshan at the ninth level of the martial King realm, then Lu Ming would be even stronger when he reached the peak of the king realm. He would probably be able to fight against the top 700 or 800 on the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>lady flying snow, I’m leaving. I’m indebted to you for your help during this period of time. This is for you!</p><p>Lu Ming took out a storage ring and passed it to Fei Xue.</p><p>Fei Xue took it subconsciously.</p><p>“We’ll meet again!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and flew towards the muscular man.</p><p>The muscular man waved his hand and a stream of essential core wrapped around Lu Ming. He shouted,”Let’s go!”</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming and the muscular man disappeared.</p><p>Fei Xue’s mind entered the storage ring and her eyes flashed.</p><p>Two thousand gold intent crystals lay quietly in the storage ring, exuding a strong intent.</p><p>“Brother Lu …”</p><p>Fei Xue looked up and saw that Lu Ming had already disappeared.</p><p>“Father, who is that person? Are we just going to let him go after destroying the inter-province transportation formation?”</p><p>Qin Qingshan asked vice Palace Lord Qin.</p><p>“He …”</p><p>Deputy Palace Lord Qin pondered for a moment and looked at the white-haired Palace Lord.</p><p>The white-haired Palace Master nodded and said,”you’re right, he is Yan kuangtu!.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Everyone else at the scene widened their eyes in shock.</p><p>…….</p><p>Lu Ming’s vision blurred. The next moment, he was shocked to find that he had arrived outside great city.</p><p>Fast, so fast that it was unbelievable.</p><p>“Kid, where are you from in the Tianxuan region?”</p><p>The muscular man sized Lu Ming up curiously.</p><p>“I’m from the cloud Emperor mountain range in the eastern part of the Tianxuan region!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“The eastern part of the Tianxuan region. What a coincidence. I’m also from the eastern part of the Tianxuan region. Time really flies. In the blink of an eye, I haven’t returned to the Tianxuan region for decades. This time, I heard that something had happened to the ancient barren city, so I went back to take a look.”</p><p>The muscular man took a few sips of wine and looked to the East.</p><p>“Ancient desolate city?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed but he did not say much.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Lu Ming cupped his fists and said,”Senior, I wonder when we will return to the Tianxuan region?”</p><p>“Haha, what’s the rush? I don’t mind having a few drinks with you for a while.”</p><p>The man laughed and landed on a Hill outside Hong city.</p><p>Then, he casually sat on the ground and took out the roasted meat from his storage ring and began to eat.</p><p>Lu Ming had no choice but to sit at the side.</p><p>“It’ll be easier to travel after eating and drinking to your heart’s content. Come, have a mouthful too!”</p><p>The muscular man threw the wine gourd to Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
