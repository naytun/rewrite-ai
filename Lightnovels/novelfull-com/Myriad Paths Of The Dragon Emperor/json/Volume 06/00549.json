Then, he condensed a long spear with his vital essence. The long spear expanded rapidly and became a thousand meters long. He whipped it at the two coffins.</p><p>Its power was extremely shocking.</p><p>ah! Not good! This is a lower tier King tier!</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>Two panicked screams came from the coffin. At the same time, the coffin flew backward, trying to escape.</p><p>But, how could he escape?</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The huge spear radiance hit the two coffins directly. The coffins exploded and six figures emerged from them.</p><p>Two old corpse guards and four refined corpses.</p><p>The two corpse guards and the four refined corpses were both at the LV 3 martial King realm. However, they could not even withstand a single blow from Lu Ming’s spear.</p><p>&Nbsp; the spear light enveloped them and suppressed them. The two corpse guards cried out in pain as they were torn to pieces along with the four refined corpses.</p><p>With a roll of his Zhen Yuan, he kept the two storage rings.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop and continued to move forward.</p><p>After about a few hundred miles, a series of rumbling sounds came from ahead.</p><p>Someone was fighting.</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows and muttered to himself for a moment. Then, he walked in the direction of the sound.</p><p>Ten miles away, two parties were fighting.</p><p>On one side, it was obvious that they were from the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>On the other side, there were six people.</p><p>It was a young woman in her twenties. She was as beautiful as a flower and delicate and pleasant.</p><p>There were two young men and three middle-aged men.</p><p>But now, the six of them were completely at a disadvantage and were surrounded by the people of the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>The heavenly corpse sect had a total of eight corpse guards, but they had seventeen refined corpses, whose strength was far above those six people.</p><p>Lu Ming quietly appeared not far away. He hid in a remote place and looked ahead.</p><p>the strongest corpse guards are two in the middle stage of the LV 4 martial King realm.</p><p>Lu Ming could tell the cultivation of everyone at a glance.</p><p>On the side of the heavenly corpse sect, there were two King tiers of lower tier Lv 4 martial King realm who were controlling four refined corpses.</p><p>The other corpse guards were at the third and second level of the martial King realm.</p><p>Among the six men, only one middle-aged man was at the peak of Lv 4 martial King realm, while the other two were only at Lv 3 martial King realm.</p><p>As for the two young men and the young woman, they were both at Lv 2 martial King realm.</p><p>They had relied entirely on the middle-aged man at the peak of Lv 4 martial King realm to barely resist the attacks from all sides. However, he would not be able to hold on for long.</p><p>“Kaka, that girl is not bad. She’s pink and tender. I’ll catch her and play with her. Then, I’ll refine her into a refined corpse and bring her with me every day. It’s also a great pleasure in life. Kaka!”</p><p>An old corpse guard with dry skin let out an ear-piercing laugh.</p><p>He was one of the two corpse guards at the middle Lv 4 martial King realm.</p><p>“Old ghost, don’t even think about it. I’d rather die than submit!”</p><p>The young woman called out with a pale face.</p><p>“You’d rather die than submit? When you die, I’ll refine you into a refined corpse, hehe!”</p><p>The old corpse guard laughed strangely.</p><p>The young woman’s face turned even paler. She gritted her teeth and runes appeared on her Jade-like palms. With a wave of her hand, three combat swords danced around her and then slashed at the old corpse guard.</p><p>However, it was easily blocked by a refined corpse.</p><p>“What an amazing attack.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with curiosity.</p><p>He realized that the six of them had a very special way of attacking.</p><p>Just like that woman, inscriptions flickered on her palms, and she actually controlled several spirit weapons at the same time to attack her opponent.</p><p>Furthermore, the power that each spirit weapon unleashed was extremely powerful.</p><p>The martial artists that Lu Ming had seen in the past would usually use a spirit weapon in order to unleash the strongest power of some martial arts techniques.</p><p>For example, Lu Ming could unleash the strongest power of the spear technique when he used a long spear. On the other hand, he could unleash the strongest power of the sword technique when he used a combat sword. This was the first time Lu Ming had seen someone controlling several spirit weapons to attack at the same time.</p><p>However, even though the six of them had profound methods of controlling spirit weapons, the disparity in strength was too great, and they were not their match at all.</p><p>Not long after, the two Lv 3 martial King realm middle-aged men were injured and spat out large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>big brother, take the young lady and break out of the encirclement. We’ll block them from here!</p><p>One of the burly men shouted at the peak Lv 4 martial King realm.</p><p>“That’s right, nothing must happen to the young lady!”</p><p>The other man also shouted.</p><p>“No, we’ll leave together!”</p><p>The young woman shouted.</p><p>“Kaka, you want to leave? Today, none of you will be leaving!”</p><p>The old corpse guard sneered.</p><p>big brother, hurry up! Take the young lady and rush out to get help!</p><p>One of the burly men continued to roar.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The LV 4 martial King realm burly man gritted his teeth and rushed madly in one direction, shouting, ” “Miss, follow me and rush out!”</p><p>“You want to rush out? in your dreams! Deal with that guy with all your strength!”</p><p>The old corpse guard sneered and controlled the refined corpse to pounce at the big man fearlessly.</p><p>At the same time, the other Lv 4 martial King realm corpse guard also controlled the refined corpse to pounce on the burly man.</p><p>The burly man controlled four blades at the same time and slashed wildly, but it was useless. They were blocked.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>He roared in despair.</p><p>“Kaka, don’t even think about running away. Little beauty, be good and serve this old man. If you serve this old man well, this old man might show mercy and not refine you into a refined corpse.”</p><p>The old corpse guard sneered.</p><p>“Old man, go to hell!”</p><p>The young woman was in despair. She gritted her teeth and attacked the old corpse guard, but she was easily blocked by a Lv 3 martial King refined corpse.</p><p>The heavenly corpse sect’s corpse guards didn’t seem to be in a hurry to kill them, and were toying with the young woman and the others like a cat playing with a mouse.</p><p>“Oh, I see!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked to the East and West, a cold smile on his face.</p><p>He discovered that there were auras hidden in the East and West. Although the auras were restrained to a very weak extent, Lu Ming could still sense them.</p><p>And that aura was the aura of the sky corpse sect’s corpse guards.</p><p>they … They are trying to attract the young woman’s reinforcements and then capture them all in one fell swoop!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>however, the highest level among them is only at Lv 5 martial King realm.</p><p>A cold smile appeared on Lu Ming’s face. He stopped hiding and strode out.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming walked out, the heavenly corpse sect’s corpse guard noticed him and shouted.</p><p>“Of course it’s the people who are here to kill you.”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“Kaka, little brat, just you alone? You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The old corpse guard laughed strangely.</p><p>At this time, the young woman and the rest looked at Lu Ming. When they saw that Lu Ming was alone and that he was so young, they were immediately disappointed.</p><p>“Young hero, leave quickly, don’t worry about us!”</p><p>The young woman cried out.</p><p>Lu Ming was alone. If he did not leave now, he would also be killed.</p><p>“Beauty, it’s fine. I’ll leave after I kill these monsters of the heavenly corpse sect!”</p><p>Lu Ming flashed a bright smile at the young woman.</p><p>The young woman and the others were a little stunned.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
