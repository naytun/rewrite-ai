Lu Ming managed to break through it in one move.</p><p>However, the obstruction created by the two types of concept runes was too strong. Lu Ming could not break through it in a short time.</p><p>It was no wonder that others would say that cultivating several concepts at the same time would only get harder and harder later on, and there would be almost no achievements.</p><p>Not only would it distract him, but it would also be difficult to break through.</p><p>Lu Ming’s three concepts had been successfully integrated, but it had produced such a strong obstruction. If the integration had not been successful, the obstruction would be even stronger.</p><p>I’m afraid it’ll take a long time to Polish it if I want to condense a fire concept rune in one go. I’m afraid it won’t be possible without three to five years.</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming shook his head. Three to five years? There was too much time. Where would he find the time to waste?</p><p>If this option didn’t work, then he could only take the second option.</p><p>He used external forces to force his way through.</p><p>And among external forces, intent crystals were undoubtedly the most effective.</p><p>&Nbsp; however, normal intent crystals probably wouldn’t have much of an effect.</p><p>&Nbsp; they needed middle-grade intent crystals to succeed in one go.</p><p>But middle-grade intent crystals?</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming smiled bitterly.</p><p>&Nbsp; intent crystals were divided into low-grade, medium-grade, high-grade, and top-grade.</p><p>Lu Ming had come into contact with low-grade profound meaning crystals in the past.</p><p>The lowest price in the market was one billion lower spiritual crystals, which was 1000 Supreme spiritual crystals.</p><p>&Nbsp; but middle-grade intent crystals were a thousand times more expensive than low-grade intent crystals.</p><p>Yes, a thousand times.</p><p>&Nbsp; a middle-grade intent crystal would cost at least one million Supreme-grade spirit crystals, which was extremely terrifying.</p><p>The main thing was that middle-grade intent crystals were too rare and could only be found by luck.</p><p>However, the effects of middle-grade profound meaning crystals were still worlds apart from low-grade profound meaning crystals. They were much stronger.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming could only smile bitterly.</p><p>He only had 60000 Supreme spiritual crystals from Shengjiang.</p><p>60,000 pieces of spiritual crystals were not even enough for Lu Ming to break through to the third level of the martial King realm.</p><p>He was poor. Lu Ming felt that he was too poor. He did not have enough crystals.</p><p>Also, the demon subduing spear was not in good use anymore. Lu Ming wanted to find a King-level Alchemist to refine a long spear.</p><p>It was not cheap to find a King-level Alchemist to make a spear.</p><p>All of this required spiritual crystals.</p><p>“I’ll cultivate for a few more days and see if there are any missions!”</p><p>Lu Ming immediately continued cultivating.</p><p>This time, his main focus was to comprehend the Thunder concept.</p><p>Ten days passed quickly.</p><p>His Thunder mentality had progressed at lightning speed and was already at the middle stage of level one lower class.</p><p>At this time, Lu Ming had been staying here for fifteen days and the date for the house was up.</p><p>Lu Ming returned the Jade card and walked out of the mansion. He then headed to the mission Hall.</p><p>The mission Palace Hall was not in the third region, but the second region.</p><p>In Tianxuan city, where every inch of land was worth its weight in gold, the mission Hall was not very big. People were coming and going in the mission Hall.</p><p>There were young ones and old ones. There were people of all kinds of colors, but each and every one of them had an extremely strong aura. They were all martial Kings, and every one of them was a second-grade Emperor heaven Divine Guard. There were even third-grade Emperor heaven divine guards occasionally.</p><p>Rank 3 empyrean heaven divine guards were usually lower tier King tiers.</p><p>Lu Ming walked into the missions Hall and looked around.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly realized that there were the most people under a stone tablet that was engraved with inscriptions. Most of them were young people.</p><p>Lu Ming was a little curious and walked over.</p><p>There were lines of words on the stone tablet. These words were all introductions to a mission.</p><p>Lu Ming also started to read it.</p><p>“This mission is established!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p>This mission was very suitable for Lu Ming.</p><p>The Empyrean heaven divine Palace had discovered a brand new dimension not long ago. It had never been discovered before, and no one had ever mined it.</p><p>The experts of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace found the weakest part of the plane space and broke it down, creating an entrance.</p><p>However, he later found out that the natural laws of this plane had the inscription of time, and Warriors above the age of 30 couldn’t enter at all.</p><p>Only Warriors over the age of thirty seemed to conform to the laws of that plane and could enter.</p><p>Later on, there were Warriors below the age of thirty who entered. They discovered that this dimension was extremely vast and boundless. Not only were there native inhabitants of this dimension, but there were also a large number of extremely precious materials.</p><p>For example, intent crystals.</p><p>Yes, this dimension contained dozens or even hundreds of times more intent crystals than the outside world.</p><p>It was normal for a dimension that had never been excavated to have a large number of intent crystals.</p><p>Intent crystals contained innate intent.</p><p>For a time, the Empyrean heaven divine Palace sent out a large number of cultivators below the age of thirty to this dimension to mine for power Upanishad crystals and other precious materials. The Empyrean heaven divine Palace took a portion of the profits.</p><p>However, at this time, they discovered that the heavenly corpse sect had also discovered this dimension. They had also opened up an entrance and sent a large number of corpse guards under the age of thirty into this dimension.</p><p>Naturally, when the two forces met, a fierce battle would inevitably break out, and both sides would suffer heavy casualties.</p><p>In the next few months, the two sides carried out a brutal hunt in this dimension.</p><p>A few months later, the Empyrean heaven divine Palace had already issued out missions. Any empyrean heaven Divine Guard under the age of 30 could take on the mission to enter this dimension and hunt the corpse guards of the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>The Empyrean heaven divine Palace would not take any of the materials that he had excavated and would only buy them at a high price.</p><p>Furthermore, killing the corpse guards of the heavenly corpse sect would also give them generous rewards.</p><p>The reward for killing a Lv 1 martial King realm corpse guard was 2000 pieces of top-grade spiritual crystals.</p><p>The reward for killing a Lv 2 martial King realm corpse guard was 5000 pieces of top-grade spiritual crystals.</p><p>The reward for killing a Lv 3 martial King realm corpse guard was 10000 pieces of top-grade spiritual crystals.</p><p>The reward for killing a Lv 4 martial King realm corpse guard was 20000 pieces of top-grade spiritual crystals.</p><p>The reward for killing a Lv 5 martial King realm corpse guard was as high as 50000 pieces of top-grade spiritual crystals.</p><p>…</p><p>The reward was very generous and Lu Ming was very tempted.</p><p>Not only did this mission have a reward, but it also had intent crystals.</p><p>However, this mission was also extremely dangerous.</p><p>The Empyrean sky divine guards would be rewarded for killing corpse guards, and the heavenly corpse sect would also issue missions to corpse guards. Killing Empyrean sky divine guards would also give generous rewards.</p><p>Other than that, they also had to be wary of the natives of that dimension. The natives of that dimension were called the scaled demon race, and it was extremely dangerous.</p><p>“This is the mission!”</p><p>Lu Ming walked directly to the counter.</p><p>I want to take on a mission from the demonic scales dimension!</p><p>Lu Ming said to an old man at the counter.</p><p>The demonic scales dimension was the name of that dimension.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
