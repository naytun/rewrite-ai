His body was sent flying like a meteorite.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Instantly, a huge pit with a diameter of dozens of meters appeared on the ground. Xuan Zhong was lying in the pit, blood spurting out of his mouth.</p><p>Lu Ming appeared at the edge of the pit and looked at Xuan Zhong coldly.</p><p>“Don’t kill me, don’t kill me, I beg you to let me go!”</p><p>Xuan Zhong struggled to get up and kept begging for mercy. He was so scared that he was trembling.</p><p>Now, his life was in Lu Ming’s hands. He felt that he was drowning in endless fear.</p><p>you just said that in two days, Grandmaster Xuan and the others will all die. What did you mean? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked coldly.</p><p>“No, nothing. I was just talking nonsense.”</p><p>Xuan Zhong shook his head hurriedly.</p><p>“If you don’t want to tell me, then you can die!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were dazed and his killing intent burst out.</p><p>“No, no, wait, I’ll talk, I’ll talk!”</p><p>Xuan Zhong screamed.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at him coldly.</p><p>Xuan Zhong’s face was covered in cold sweat. the heavenly corpse sect wants to snatch a treasure from the weapon forging sect.

Please let me go.”</p><p>Xuan Zhong looked at Lu Ming with great apprehension.</p><p>Now, he only wanted to save his life. He didn’t care about anything else.</p><p>“I’ll spare you. Go and plead with Grandmaster Xuan and the others!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and a stream of vital essence surged into Xuan Zhong’s body, sealing his vital essence. Then, he carried Xuan Zhong and flew back to the weapon forging sect.</p><p>Xuan Zhong’s face paled in fear.</p><p>Not long after, they arrived at the weapon forging sect.</p><p>“Someone, someone, someone! Someone wants to kill me! Someone wants to harm the weapon forging sect!”</p><p>Right at this moment, Xuan Zhong’s crazy shout echoed far in the silent night.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Immediately, dozens of experts flew out from various parts of the weapon forging sect.</p><p>“Deacon pang, this kid wants to kill me. He wants to steal the treasure of our weapon forging sect.”</p><p>Xuan Zhong shouted, his face was filled with ruthlessness.</p><p>“It’s Xuan Zhong!”</p><p>“What? Brat, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>The people from the weapon forging sect bellowed in anger and launched attacks at Lu Ming.</p><p>get out of my way. I have no ill intentions.

He might as well take a gamble now.</p><p>As long as the people from the weapon forging sect killed Lu Ming, he might still have a chance of survival.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The people from the weapon forging sect charged at Lu Ming in a frenzy.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming bellowed angrily. He swept his spear and dozens of weapon forging sect experts were sent flying.</p><p>Lu Ming moved and dashed toward the depths of the weapon forging sect.</p><p>“Help!”</p><p>Xuan Zhong shouted.</p><p>shut up! If you scream again, I’ll kill you!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted angrily.</p><p>“Go ahead and kill. You’re going to die anyway. Just kill!”</p><p>Xuan Zhong made up his mind and shouted.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At this moment, another person was charging towards them.</p><p>This time, all of them were martial King realm experts.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to explain. He sent them all flying and rushed over. Very soon, he was approaching the meeting hall of the weapon forging sect.</p><p>“Little thief, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>At this moment, a cold voice was heard. Then, a few sharp attacks were launched at Lu Ming.</p><p>They were two Battle Blades.</p><p>“Father, save me!”</p><p>Upon hearing this voice, Xuan Zhong was overjoyed.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming exerted all his strength and swept his long spear horizontally, blocking the attack of the two sabers. However, his body shook violently and he could not help but retreat a thousand meters.</p><p>“A late stage King tier!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>In front of him, Xuan Yuan appeared with a few spirit weapons floating beside him.</p><p>Xuan Yuan’s face was extremely cold. He pounced on Lu Ming like lightning without the slightest hesitation.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, the two sabers turned into two cold electric arcs and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, there was a flash of light and three long Spears appeared. They pierced through the void and stabbed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>His first attack was like a storm.</p><p>When Xuan Yuan saw that Xuan Zhong had fallen into Lu Ming’s hands, he had a bad feeling. He had to kill Lu Ming with lightning-fast methods.</p><p>“Ten thousand Dragon kill!”</p><p>The spear shook, and hundreds of three-colored true dragons flew out, roaring.</p><p>On average, each spirit weapon was attacked by close to a hundred three-colored true dragons.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>die! Xuan Yuan shouted coldly as he controlled the spirit weapon. A terrifying aura burst out from the spirit weapon.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The three-colored true dragons exploded one by one and turned into nothingness. The five spirit weapons did not stop as they attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming brandished his long spear in an airtight manner and blocked the five spirit weapons.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>Although the five spirit weapons were blocked, the terrifying Qi tore through Lu Ming’s defense and almost tore his body apart. He retreated a few thousand meters again and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>a King tier of the upper tier of the LV 7 martial King realm is indeed powerful!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were solemn.</p><p>He had sensed that Xuan Yuan’s cultivation was at Lv 7 martial King realm.</p><p>“Still not dead, kill!”</p><p>Xuan Yuan shouted angrily. Lu Ming’s combat strength had exceeded his expectations.</p><p>Xuan Yuan, if you want your son to die, then continue to attack!</p><p>Lu Ming blocked Xuan Zhong in front of him and shouted.</p><p>“Father, father, save me!”</p><p>Xuan Zhong shouted in fear.</p><p>Xuan Yuan’s expression kept changing. In the next moment, his eyes suddenly turned cold and a hint of determination flashed in them. With a wave of his hands, the five spirit weapons turned into five bolts of lightning and shot toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Two Spirit weapons charged at Xuan Zhong.</p><p>“No, no!”</p><p>Xuan Zhong roared.</p><p>how ruthless! In order to silence him, he even killed his own son!</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. He used the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps and retreated rapidly.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Just at this moment, a cold shout rang out, and a few spirit weapons streaked across the void and collided with Xuan Yuan’s spirit weapon.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The sound of violent collisions resounded through the sky as Xuan Yuan’s spiritual weapons bounced back one by one.</p><p>A figure appeared in the sky. It was Xuan long.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The other elders of the weapon forging sect followed closely behind Xuan long. Xuan Xiang was among them.</p><p>“Lord Lu Ming? What’s going on?”</p><p>Xuan Xiang looked at Lu Ming and the Xuan Zhong in his hand, feeling extremely puzzled.</p><p>“Sect master, Lu Ming, that little b * stard, barged into the weapon forging sect and tried to kill Zhong ‘er. Fortunately, I found out about it. I suggest that we kill him now.”</p><p>Xuan Yuan roared, his eyes extremely cold.</p><p>hahaha, Xuan Yuan, you’ve done something wrong. Are you afraid that I’ll tell you and want to kill me to silence me? ”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily.</p><p>“Kid, what are you talking about? Why aren’t you dying?”</p><p>Xuan Yuan’s killing intent soared. He controlled the spirit weapon and charged at Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
