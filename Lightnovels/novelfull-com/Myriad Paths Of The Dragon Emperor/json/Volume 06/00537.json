How long has it been? It actually grew to this stage. Damn it, damn it!”</p><p>Holy light roared in its heart.</p><p>Sheng Wushuang’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets as fear flashed across his eyes.</p><p>shengchuan didn’t use his full strength just now. Lu Ming can’t be his match!</p><p>Sacred light took a deep breath and said coldly.</p><p>Many people nodded in agreement.</p><p>Shengchuan was probably just testing the waters, and Lu Ming had most likely used his full strength.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I only used 50% of my power just now. Now, take this!”</p><p>“Thousand mountains heaven suppressing fist!”</p><p>Shengchuan roared and his bloodline burst out. Without a doubt, it was also a King level six extreme bloodline. At the same time, he punched out with both fists.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Heaven and earth shook violently as the vast fist shadows turned into tall mountains.</p><p>There seemed to be thousands of mountain peaks.</p><p>“Suppress!”</p><p>The holy river roared, and the mountain in the sky crashed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Heaven rank martial arts technique, it’s a pity that I haven’t mastered it. How many levels of strength do I need? First level or half level?”</p><p>Lu Ming was in a dilemma.</p><p>He had a plan in his heart. He was going to cast a long line to catch a big fish. He was afraid that he would show too much power and scare the big fish away.</p><p>“Forget it, I’ll just use 10% of my power first!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming held the long spear and fired.</p><p>“Ah, break, break!”</p><p>Lu Ming deliberately shouted loudly.</p><p>He had only used 10% of his strength, but he had to pretend that he had used 12% of his strength. The veins on his face bulged, and he screamed until he was exhausted.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>One of the mountains that came crashing down was destroyed by Lu Ming.</p><p>However, the second mountain fell.</p><p>Lu Ming thrust his spear again and the mountain continued to collapse.</p><p>“Hahaha, Lu Ming, let’s see how many you can defeat.”</p><p>Shengchuan laughed and kept punching. The mountains in the sky kept pressing down.</p><p>Lu Ming held the long spear in his hand. The Spear’s gleam soared into the sky and turned into a thousand-meter long spear, continuously crushing the mountains.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Rumbles continued between heaven and earth. Fortunately, the divine guards ‘battle platform was wide enough. It was ten miles long and wide, enough for them to fight.</p><p>Soon, dozens of moves had passed. Lu Ming had destroyed dozens of mountains in a row and then rushed toward the holy river.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>With every step Lu Ming took on the fighting ring, the fighting ring would rumble.</p><p>??…</p><p>In Lu Ming’s hands, lightning flashed and a powerful force of lightning burst out.</p><p>“A lower tier King. Lu Ming, that little bastard, has already reached the lower tier. His combat strength is so strong that he can fight against the holy river. We can’t let him live. We can’t let this little bastard live.”</p><p>Holy light roared in its heart.</p><p>He could clearly sense that Lu Ming’s cultivation was at the early stage of the LV 4 martial King realm.</p><p>He was shocked.</p><p>fifteen tons of Thunder!</p><p>Lu Ming roared loudly in the fighting ring.</p><p>As the spear pierced out, the sky was filled with lightning. The mountains were blasted apart.</p><p>This move was not a martial art technique at all. It was Lu Ming’s random shouting.</p><p>He had no choice. If he used a martial technique like the Dragon God’s three absolutes, he would probably kill shengchuan.</p><p>He could only casually blast out a move and call out a loud name.</p><p>“Damn it, it’s not easy to pretend to be weak.”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart.</p><p>However, shengchuan was so shocked that he gasped. With a loud cry, he covered his body with black stones to block the lightning attack.</p><p>??…</p><p>As the lightning swept past, the rocks crumbled continuously.</p><p>“This … How did this happen? The holy river is actually losing?”</p><p>“Nest, that kid is actually this strong?”</p><p>“Is the holy river going to lose?”</p><p>There was another round of intense discussion in the surroundings.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it!”</p><p>Shengchuan bellowed continuously, using all his strength to fight Lu Ming.</p><p>However, shengchuan was already at a disadvantage and was slowly being suppressed by Lu Ming.</p><p>The two of them exchanged dozens of blows. Sheng Chuan was whipped by Lu Ming’s spear. He screamed and flew far away. He fell heavily on the ground and spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming rushed forward and stomped on shengchuan’s face, pressing him down on the fighting ring.</p><p>???!</p><p>Shengchuan struggled and roared madly, trying to break free, but Lu Ming was stepping on him firmly and he could not break free at all.</p><p>He was going crazy.</p><p>It’s over. Shengchuan knew that he was finished. Lu Ming had stepped on his face in public. From now on, he would never be able to lift his head in the Sheng family.</p><p>His future was also ruined.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Lu Ming, I’m going to kill you! I’m going to kill you!”</p><p>Shengchuan roared crazily.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>Lu Ming gave him a slap in response.</p><p>A slap landed directly on shengchuan’s face. Shengchuan’s scream came to an abrupt end, and he was dumbfounded.</p><p>how dare you, you little bastard. How dare you slap the face of our Sheng family’s hero? you’re looking for death. Move your stinky feet away now.</p><p>“I want you to die without a proper burial!”</p><p>The young men from the Sheng family were all shouting.</p><p>Sacred glory was so angry that its eyes were burning.</p><p>“What are you shouting for? This is the divine guards “battle stage. I should be grateful that I didn’t kill him, but what’s wrong with stepping on him?”</p><p>Lu Ming swept a glance around and shouted loudly, looking very arrogant.</p><p>The surrounding young men of the Sheng family were so angry that they almost vomited blood.</p><p>“Ah, don’t stop me, I’m going to kill him.”</p><p>A young man from the Sheng family roared.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with them. He looked at shengchuan again and said, ” now, you’ve lost. Hand over the twenty wind attribute intent crystals!</p><p>“Little bastard, you still want intent crystals? You’re dreaming.”</p><p>Shengchuan roared.</p><p>“You want to go back on your word? Hurry up and hand it over.”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted angrily.</p><p>“I won’t hand it over, what can you do to me? And you want intent crystals? dream on. ”</p><p>Shengchuan laughed.</p><p>“You … You …”</p><p>Lu Ming pointed at the holy river and gritted his teeth.</p><p>“Hahaha …”</p><p>Looking at Lu Ming’s expression, Sheng Chuan laughed heartily. However, he could not laugh anymore in the next moment.</p><p>Lu Ming bent down slowly and took off the storage ring on shengchuan’s finger.</p><p>“You … What are you trying to do? Give me back my storage ring.”</p><p>Shengchuan screamed.</p><p>“Return it to you? I’m just using my winnings as a bet.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>give it back to me. Twenty intent crystals. I’ll give them to you. I’ll give them to you.</p><p>Shengchuan shouted. This storage ring was all he had.</p><p>“It’s too late now.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s fingers glowed and he kept shengchuan’s storage ring.</p><p>“You … You’re cheating, you’re cheating …”</p><p>Shengchuan shouted.</p><p>“I’m cheating? Weren’t you the one who cheated first? Alright, you can leave now, trash!”</p><p>Lu Ming got up and kicked. Shengchuan screamed in pain. He flew out like a broken sack and slid seven to eight miles away. He fell off the divine guards ‘fighting ring and screamed in pain.</p><p>“Little bastard, How dare you! You’re courting death!”</p><p>“Hand over your storage ring, kneel down and admit your mistake, and I can spare your life!”</p><p>The young man from the Sheng family roared in anger.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
