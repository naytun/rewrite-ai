Kill, kill them all!”</p><p>...</p><p>A corpse guard with an extremely powerful aura shouted. This corpse Guard’s cultivation had already reached the lower tier of a King.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sky was filled with iron chains that looked like black poisonous snakes.</p><p>The black chains either stabbed towards the crowd like Spears or wrapped around them like ropes.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>Everyone’s attacks landed on the chains, but they were all bounced back. Only the attacks of three lower tier King tiers managed to break through dozens of chains.</p><p>But-</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The nine lower tier refined corpses roared and waved their arms. A few chains flew out from each of them and swept toward the three lower tier Kings.</p><p>With a loud boom, the three lower tier King tiers were also sent flying back, unable to break through.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>“What do we do?”</p><p>Some people panicked and couldn’t rush out at all.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The corpse guard shouted.</p><p>The refined corpse roared, and the iron chains swept across the sky, killing everyone.</p><p>Someone screamed as the chains pierced through his body and he was killed.</p><p>In a few breaths, another four to five people were killed.</p><p>“Continue charging!”</p><p>Zhuang Hong roared as he charged forward with all his might.</p><p>However, the three of them were completely blocked by the nine lower tier King level refined corpses. It was impossible for them to get out.</p><p>For a time, everyone was caught in a bitter battle, and people were constantly killed.</p><p>“What do we do?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s brows were tightly furrowed. He waved the long spear in his hands, continuously blocking the chains from all directions.</p><p>The difference between the third and fourth level of the martial King realm was the dividing line between a Lower King and a lower tier King. Therefore, the difference between the third and fourth level of the martial King realm was not a simple one, but two levels.</p><p>Therefore, although Lu Ming’s cultivation had reached the second level of the martial King realm, he was no match for a King tier of the lower tier of the fourth level.</p><p>Zhuang Hong and the other two lower tier Kings were all at Lv 4 martial King realm. If they could not break through, it would be difficult for Lu Ming to do so as well.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Screams rang out. Another person was killed, and his body was dragged out by the chains.</p><p>At this moment, their numbers were less than 30.</p><p>Furthermore, Zhuang Hong and the other two lower tier King tiers were also in a tough battle.</p><p>Being besieged by several refined corpses of the same level that were impervious to swords and Spears, they were no match for them at all. It had only been a short while, but they had a few more wounds on their bodies.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The chains danced in the air, and one of the lower tier King tiers was caught by one of them.</p><p>“Dammit, break!”</p><p>The lower tier King tier roared as he tried to sever the chains. However, after a few consecutive slashes and sparks, only a shallow dent appeared on the chains.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A metal chain pierced through his chest.</p><p>It was as fast as lightning.</p><p>The Ditian Divine Guard roared loudly and tried his best to shift his body to the side.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The iron chain was like a long spear, directly piercing through his shoulder, and blood splattered everywhere.</p><p>“Hehehe, don’t even think about resisting. Die and become my refined corpse!”</p><p>On the side, the corpse Guard’s cold laughter came.</p><p>in your dreams, scumbags of the heavenly corpse sect! Don’t even think about refining my corpse into a refined corpse! Run! I’ll block them!</p><p>The Ditian Divine Guard’s eyes were bloodshot as he roared at Zhuang Hong and the others.</p><p>At the same time, the aura on his body went berserk.</p><p>damn it, he wants to self-destruct! Stop him!</p><p>One of the Ditian divine guards shrieked.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>The Ditian Divine Guard laughed loudly.</p><p>“Charge, charge, charge this way!”</p><p>Zhuang Hong and the others gritted their teeth and suddenly changed their direction, madly rushing towards the other side.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, an earth-shattering explosion was heard, and violent energy spread in all directions.</p><p>The Ditian Divine Guard had self-destructed. The power of a fourth level lower tier King tier’s self-destruction was beyond imagination.</p><p>The nine lower tier refined corpses were sent flying, and some of the lower tier refined corpses were directly blown into pieces.</p><p>With a large number of refined corpses blocked, the pressure on Zhuang Hong and the others was greatly reduced.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Zhuang Hong, another lower tier King tier, Lu Ming, and a few other powerful Empyrean sky divine guards joined forces and blasted a huge hole in the refined corpses ‘encirclement.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Immediately, they rushed toward the gap.</p><p>Lu Ming followed closely behind Zhuang Hong and rushed out of the gap.</p><p>“Damn it, block it, block it!”</p><p>A large group of corpse guards roared. Iron chains flew across the sky, and that gap was instantly blocked.</p><p>There were still more than a dozen people who did not manage to escape and were trapped inside. In the next moment, screams rang out one after another.</p><p>However, Lu Ming and the rest could not care so much because there was still a barrier in front of them, and that was the corpse guard.</p><p>“You want to leave? impossible! Die!”</p><p>The corpse guards made their moves. Corpse Qi surged and all kinds of palm winds, claw gleams, and blade auras that contained corpse Qi blasted toward Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>As long as these corpse guards stopped them for a while, they would be in danger, because those refined corpses would immediately surround them.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Zhuang Hong and the other lower tier King level corpse guards were blocked. The other side was also two lower tier King level corpse guards.</p><p>If the corpse guards got rid of the refined corpses, their combat power would be weaker than martial artists of the same level, but it was no problem to hold them back for a short time.</p><p>“Hehe, die, bastard!”</p><p>A Lv 3 martial King realm corpse guard clawed at Lu Ming with its claws.</p><p>“You’re the one who’s going to die!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was cold. He twisted his spine like a dragon and thrust his spear forward.</p><p>An extreme strike!</p><p>After breaking through to the martial King realm, the power of an extreme strike was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>This corpse Guard’s head was directly pierced by the spear, and he died.</p><p>Once this corpse guard died, the few refined corpses he controlled stopped in the air, not moving at all.</p><p>However, there were too many refined corpses, and it didn’t matter if a few of them stopped.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed past and he was about to break out of the siege.</p><p>“Stop right there!”</p><p>A cold shout was heard. A saber ray filled with corpse Qi was aimed at Lu Ming’s waist.</p><p>Lu Ming held his long spear horizontally and blocked in front of him.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>A terrifying force gushed toward Lu Ming. His body trembled and he could not help but retreat.</p><p>A corpse guard with a pale face and a saber in his hand appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>Without a doubt, he was a King tier at the lower tier.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, nine refined corpses of the lower tier King level were madly rushing over.</p><p>The iron chains crossed the sky and rushed over.</p><p>“Dandan, smash it!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming shouted in a low voice.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Dandan, who had been hanging on the ends of her hair, trembled slightly and flew out with a Swoosh, smashing towards that corpse Guard’s face.</p><p>Ever since dandan had eaten the heavenly Tribulation last time, she seemed to have been digesting it. It was only a few days ago that she had digested it and had a reaction again.</p><p>Lu Ming fixed his gaze on it. He wondered what the effect would be after he digested the heaven’s test.</p><p>“It’s just a piece of rock, break it!”</p><p>That corpse guard sneered and slashed out a saber ray, wanting to cut dandan into pieces.</p><p>However, dandan completely ignored those blade lights and rushed past, directly smashing towards that corpse Guard’s face.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A sound that made one’s teeth ache was heard.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
