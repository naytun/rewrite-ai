You still dare to appear? you’re looking for death!”</p><p>Lu Ming! a few cold shouts were heard. The two seventh level martial King realm corpse guards instantly recognized Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Wuwuwuwu …</p><p>The air was torn as two Lv 7 martial King realm refined corpses blocked Lu Ming’s path of retreat.</p><p>This time, they had learned their lesson. They blocked the road in the beginning, afraid that Lu Ming would escape again.</p><p>“It seems that you have gained a lot during this period of time.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes shone with a fiery glow.</p><p>As far as he knew, the people of the heavenly corpse sect rarely cultivated the nine common mentalities. What the heavenly corpse sect cultivated the most was a special kind of mentalism called the death mentalism.</p><p>Therefore, the people of the heavenly corpse sect would definitely not use up all the ultimacy crystals they had excavated. Most of them were kept in the storage rings, waiting to be exchanged for resources.</p><p>hehe, not bad indeed, kid. Unfortunately, you can only be envious. Kill!</p><p>A Lv 7 martial King realm corpse guard sneered and suddenly shouted.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The two Lv 7 martial King realm corpse guards behind Lu Ming immediately attacked him.</p><p>In front of him, another Lv 7 martial King realm corpse guard was controlling two refined corpses to besiege Lu Ming.</p><p>“This time, you’re the ones who will die!”</p><p>&Nbsp; the wind Lightning Spear appeared in his hand, and he swept it.</p><p>A full moon appeared in the sky.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The spearlight accurately hit the four Lv 7 martial King refined corpses. Like four cannonballs, the four refined corpses were sent flying 10000 meters away and crashed into a few mountains.</p><p>With a series of rumbles, dust filled the air, and a few large mountains collapsed, sending gravel flying.</p><p>All the corpse guards ‘expressions changed drastically, especially the two Lv 7 martial King realm corpse guards. They could no longer sense the four refined corpses, which meant that the four refined corpses had been destroyed.</p><p>‘How is this possible? a refined corpse has copper skin and iron bones. It’s impervious to swords and Spears, especially a Lv 7 martial King refined corpse. Even a Lv 8 martial King expert can’t destroy it so easily.’</p><p>And Lu Ming had destroyed four Lv 7 martial King refined corpses with a single shot?</p><p>The faces of the two Lv 7 martial King realm corpse guards turned pale.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Without any hesitation, the two Lv 7 martial King realm corpse guards madly flew into the distance.</p><p>“It’s too late for you to leave!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and appeared behind the two corpse guards. His long spear smashed towards the two of them with the force of Mount Tai.</p><p>An enormous spear light that was thousands of meters long crushed down at the two corpse guards.</p><p>The two corpse guards roared and fought back with all their might.</p><p>However, the corpse Guard’s combat strength was weak to begin with. How could it stop Lu Ming?</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The spear light smashed down, and the two Lv 7 martial King corpse guards were smashed into meat paste.</p><p>“Ah, run!”</p><p>When the other corpse guards saw this scene, they were scared out of their wits and scattered in all directions.</p><p>“Devour!”</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons flew out and let out a long roar. A terrifying devouring power burst out of its mouth and covered the corpse guards.</p><p>“Ah, what happened? Why can’t I run anymore?”</p><p>“My blood essence, my blood essence is about to fly out, help!”</p><p>One by one, the corpse guards cried out in fear.</p><p>But in the next moment-</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Drops of blood essence were directly devoured from the body of those corpse guards, flying into the mouth of the nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>Once his blood essence was devoured, his life force would also be gone.</p><p>More than thirty corpse guards had all fallen and landed on the ground.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons swallowed the blood essence of the two Lv 7 martial King realm corpse guards.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, Lu Ming’s quintessential essence formed thin threads and took off all the corpse guards ‘storage rings.</p><p>let’s go. We’ll find a place to refine the blood essence and then count it!</p><p>Lu Ming moved and left the place.</p><p>Tens of thousands of miles away, Lu Ming entered the Supreme shrine and began to refine the blood essence.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming used all the power of his blood essence to upgrade his second blood Meridian.</p><p>The blood essence of the two Lv 7 martial King realm King tiers and more than 30 other corpse guards was extremely rich.</p><p>Not long after, the second bloodline trembled slightly, and the seventh silver chakra appeared.</p><p>King level seventh rank bloodline.</p><p>The blood essence of a late stage King was indeed extraordinary.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The second bloodline trembled slightly, and the mist that shrouded the stone tablet seemed to become lighter.</p><p>On the top of the stone tablet, there was a large, blurry word that appeared and disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming widened his eyes and observed carefully.</p><p>Suppress!</p><p>At the top of the stone tablet, there seemed to be a word ‘suppress’.</p><p>“Town? Could it be that this stele is called the suppressing stele?”</p><p>Lu Ming was very curious.</p><p>Unfortunately, he could only vaguely see this word. Lu Ming could not see the other words.</p><p>“Sooner or later, it will all appear.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with anticipation.</p><p>Then, he took out the storage rings of the corpse guards and started to count them.</p><p>There were a total of 33 storage rings.</p><p>Lu Ming first checked the storage ring of a Lv 7 martial King realm corpse guard. He was overjoyed when he saw it.</p><p>There were piles of intent crystals in the storage ring.</p><p>There were too many of them. Each pile was worth at least 500 yuan.</p><p>Not only were there nine commonly seen intent crystals, but there were also some special intent crystals.</p><p>For example, star intent crystals and berserk intent crystals.</p><p>&Nbsp; there were a total of thirteen intent crystals.</p><p>&Nbsp; of course, the number of special intent crystals was much smaller, but there were still more than a hundred.</p><p>There were a few metal boxes beside the profound meaning crystals. Lu Ming opened them and realized that they were all middle-grade profound meaning crystals. There were a total of thirty pieces of middle-grade profound meaning crystals. Lu Ming was almost drooling.</p><p>“WOWO, this place is really a peerless treasure land!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes emitted a fiery glow. He then checked the other storage rings.</p><p>There was no doubt that the two Lv 7 martial King realm corpse guards had the most number of intent crystals, but the other thirty corpse guards added together also had a lot.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming discovered that he had about twenty thousand pieces of various crystals.</p><p>Yes, more than twenty thousand intent crystals and one hundred and eight middle-grade intent crystals.</p><p>‘I’m rich, I’m really rich.’</p><p>If he were to bring these ultimacy crystals to Tianxuan city, the entire city would probably be shaken.</p><p>Other than the esoteric crystals, Lu Ming had not counted the rest. He could not be bothered to do so now. He would slowly count them when he had time later.</p><p>it’s still faster to kill these sky corpse sect corpse guards to obtain intent crystals. If I dig them up myself, how long will it take? ”</p><p>Lu Min decided to go out and hunt corpse guards to obtain intent crystals.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming turned into a ray of light and began to search the area.</p><p>Unfortunately, within a radius of more than 100000 miles, he only encountered a small team of a dozen corpse guards. The highest cultivation was only at the fifth level of the martial King realm, and they were easily killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>&Nbsp; this small team only had a little more than a thousand intent crystals.</p><p>“Looks like I’ll have to search further away.”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to fly forward at high speed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
