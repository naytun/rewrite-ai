BOOM!</p><p>In less than ten minutes, the inscription formation let out a terrifying roar and burst into a series of explosions. Then, with a violent shake, the inscription formation collapsed.</p><p>The inscription formation had been broken.</p><p>“Sigh, it’s still useless in the end?”</p><p>The city Lord of barren city sighed, and then, his life force was extinguished.</p><p>“Gather together and defend!”</p><p>The palace Master of fire roared. More than a hundred people retreated to a corner and gathered together, staring at the people of the heavenly corpse sect cautiously.</p><p>At this point, he could only fight to the death.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it! Am I going to die Here today?”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master roared in his heart. He was extremely unwilling.</p><p>“Hehehe!”</p><p>The old corpse guard led a group of experts and profound fragrance to the front of the desolate ancient tomb.</p><p>They were now in a spacious square in front of the desolate ancient tomb.</p><p>The desolate ancient tomb was like a magnificent palace. It was a hundred meters tall and extremely huge.</p><p>surround them first. It won’t be too late to kill them after the door of the desolate ancient tomb opens! The old corpse guard ordered.</p><p>Just in case, if he killed everyone from the Xuan family, no one would ask him if anything happened when he opened the desolate ancient tomb.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, a stream of energy appeared and cut a wound on Xuan Xiang’s arm. A stream of blood was attracted to the old corpse Guard’s hand.</p><p>Xuan Xiang cried out as she broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>“You guys, guard this place and stop them. You guys, follow me to open the desolate ancient tomb!”</p><p>The old corpse guard ordered.</p><p>He immediately left behind a group of experts, including the flood Dragon’s corpse. The old corpse guard took some experts and walked towards the desolate ancient tomb.</p><p>At this time, no one noticed that a figure wearing the black robe of the corpse guards had silently appeared behind the corpse guards.</p><p>This person was, of course, Lu Ming.</p><p>He killed a corpse guard, changed into the black robe of the corpse guard, and entered from the back without being discovered by the other corpse guards.</p><p>Now, the battle in the desolate ancient city was basically over. The Xuan family had suffered a crushing defeat. Most of them were dead, and only a few people were left in the square of the desolate ancient tomb.</p><p>“Hehe, little girl, be honest. Once the desolate ancient tomb is successfully opened, I’ll send you on your way.”</p><p>A level 7 King realm corpse guard grabbed Xuan Xiang’s arm and sneered.</p><p>Xuan Xiang’s arm was bleeding, and her face was pale.</p><p>“Now!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>A portion of the experts followed the old corpse guard to the desolate ancient tomb.</p><p>The remaining experts controlled the flood Dragon’s corpse and glared at the palace Master of fire and the rest. There were no experts around Lu Ming. The king who had caught the profound fragrance was the most powerful.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed past a few corpse guards, then he brazenly launched a Gokudo path attack. The Spear’s gleam turned into a stream of light, cutting through the void like a meteor. It was extremely fast as it struck towards the head of the corpse guard.</p><p>The corpse guard did not expect that someone would launch a sneak attack from behind. Before he could react, Lu Ming had already pierced through his head and he died on the spot.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Lu Ming appeared beside profound fragrance. He took a deep breath, pulled the profound fragrance, and soared into the sky.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>At this time, the other corpse guards finally reacted and roared.</p><p>The chains pierced through Lu Ming.</p><p>“Stay here!”</p><p>A Lv 9 martial King realm corpse guard standing on the head of the flood Dragon roared in anger. His body flashed and moved at an unbelievable speed. Before Lu Ming could even use the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps, the corpse guard had already closed in on him. A vast wave of corpse Qi was blasted toward Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming thrust his spear with all his might and collided with the corpse Qi. However, his body was sent flying back a thousand meters and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>“It’s Lu Ming!”</p><p>At this moment, the palace Master of lightning, Palace Master of fire, and the rest exclaimed in disbelief when they saw Lu Ming’s appearance.</p><p>They did not expect to see Lu Ming here.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming’s combat strength was unbelievably strong. With a sneak attack, he had killed a Lv 7 martial King realm corpse guard and blocked the attack of a Lv 9 martial King realm corpse guard.</p><p>Although this Lv 9 martial King realm corpse guard had not used much of his strength in a hurry, it was still terrifying enough.</p><p>Due to this delay, the refined corpses rushed over from all directions, wanting to surround Lu Ming.</p><p>“Gokudo path attack!”</p><p>Lu Ming rushed in a direction where there were no experts. With a Gokudo path attack, he sent more than ten refined corpses and corpse guards flying.</p><p>“You want to leave? stay!”</p><p>The corpse guard at the LV 9 martial King realm moved in a flash and chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>“Do it, break out of the encirclement!”</p><p>At this moment, the palace Master of fire roared.</p><p>They erupted and wanted to take this opportunity to break out of the encirclement.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>A corpse guard on the flood Dragon shouted.</p><p>They controlled the flood Dragon’s corpse and charged towards Palace Master of fire and the others.</p><p>However, a few of the people on the flood Dragon’s Back had gone to the desolate ancient tomb, and the LV 9 martial King realm corpse guard had gone after Lu Ming. There were only five people left, and it was extremely difficult for them to control the flood Dragon’s corpse, causing its movements to become slower than before.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The LV 9 martial King realm corpse guard could only turn around and fly toward the flood Dragon’s corpse to help control it.</p><p>Without the pursuit of a phenomenal-success King tier, Lu Ming was unstoppable.</p><p>He sent dozens of refined corpses flying.</p><p>“Lord Lu Ming, how’s my father?”</p><p>Upon seeing Lu Ming, Xuan Xiang’s eyes lit up and she asked weakly.</p><p>“We’ll talk about it later!”</p><p>Lu Ming channeled a stream of essential core to stop Xuan Xiang’s bleeding and rushed out with all his might.</p><p>Lu Ming was about to break out of the siege.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, a violent explosion was heard from the direction of the desolate ancient tomb.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Following that, violent rumbles continued to ring out. The entire ancient desolate city was shaking violently.</p><p>The next moment, a bright beam of light shot up from the side of the desolate ancient tomb into the sky, straight into the clouds.</p><p>“Who’s that?”</p><p>At that moment, a scene that left everyone dumbfounded appeared.</p><p>After the light pillar dispersed, a huge stone door suddenly appeared between heaven and earth.</p><p>The stone door was so huge that it reached into the clouds.</p><p>From the stone door, there was a vast and endless power of heaven’s might.</p><p>“Heaven’s Gate, Heaven’s Gate!”</p><p>Lu Ming exclaimed in shock.</p><p>This huge stone gate was very similar to the heaven Gate that Lu Ming had encountered at the waters of the thousand River. Even the aura was almost exactly the same.</p><p>However, the stone gate in front of him was extremely huge. It was many times larger than the sky Gate he had seen at the thousand River area.</p><p>How did this happen? How could there be such a huge heavenly gate here?</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>At this moment, a terrifying attractive force erupted from the sky Gate.</p><p>“Not good, I’m about to be sucked in!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He realized that he could not rush out anymore. In the sky Gate, there was a strong suction force acting on him.</p><p>He was not the only one. Everyone else in the ancient barren city was the same. They were all attracted by this force and slowly flew towards the sky Gate.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
