However, it was only a low-grade innate origin liquid and there were only nine drops.</p><p>But now, it was a mid-grade innate original fluid and a whole bottle.</p><p>The price of a mid-grade innate original fluid was many times higher than that of a low-grade one.</p><p>however, with the strength of my body, this small bottle of mid-grade innate stock solution won’t have much effect. However, I still have to buy it. It’s also good to give it to father and mother to strengthen their bodies.</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea and decided to buy it.</p><p>alright, this bottle of mid-grade primordial origin liquid has a starting price of 50000 Supreme spiritual crystals. Each bid must be at least 5000!</p><p>Feng Xiu announced.</p><p>“I bid 60000!”</p><p>“I’ll pay 70000.”</p><p>“I’ll get 80000!”</p><p>……</p><p>As soon as Feng Xiu’s voice fell, a group of people began to bid.</p><p>This bottle of connate original liquid was not useful to Lu Ming, but it did not mean that it was useless to others.</p><p>An ordinary warrior’s body was not as strong as Lu Ming’s. Even most Sea of Souls realm experts did not have a seventh-rank body.</p><p>Unless one had specially cultivated a body tempering cultivation technique.</p><p>Ordinary Kings used true origin to temper their bodies, but their bodies were only at the fourth stage.</p><p>Only a small number of them could reach rank-5.</p><p>The mid-grade innate original fluid was still very useful to them.</p><p>The price kept rising and soon reached 100000 Supreme spiritual crystals.</p><p>“150000!”</p><p>Suddenly, a clear voice was heard.</p><p>The bidder was Lu Ming.</p><p>The entire venue fell silent. Lu Ming added fifty thousand in one go, showing his determination to win.</p><p>“160000!”</p><p>Another person made a bid.</p><p>“Two hundred thousand!”</p><p>Lu Ming made another bid, adding another forty thousand in one go.</p><p>Many people shook their heads and sighed, giving up on the competition.</p><p>It was obvious that Lu Ming did not hesitate to increase the price. He increased the price as if he was playing. They did not have the confidence to compete with Lu Ming.</p><p>To be honest, Lu Ming did not care about tens of thousands of top-grade spirit crystals.</p><p>Now, he needed at least a million top-grade spiritual crystals to increase his cultivation by one level.</p><p>He had refined more than 20 million Supreme spiritual crystals.</p><p>200000 going once. Is there anyone else? ”</p><p>Feng Xiu asked.</p><p>“Two hundred and fifteen thousand!”</p><p>At this moment, a lazy voice was heard from guest room number five.</p><p>“Qin qingfei!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>That voice was Qin qingfei’s.</p><p>In guest room number five, Qin qingfei sneered and thought, ” “Kid, you want it, but I won’t let you get it so easily.”</p><p>“Two hundred and fifty thousand!”</p><p>Lu Ming increased the price to two hundred and fifty thousand Yuan.</p><p>“Two hundred and fifty five thousand!”</p><p>Qin qingfei’s voice rang out again, but he only symbolically added five thousand.</p><p>“That seems to be Qin qingfei!”</p><p>“That’s right. I wonder who’s in vip room 10? It seems like he offended Qin qingfei. Qin qingfei didn’t want to bid at all, but intentionally raised the price!”</p><p>At the scene, many people saw through Qin qingfei’s intentions.</p><p>three hundred thousand dollars. If you raise the price, I’ll let you have it.</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was heard.</p><p>haha, since you bid 300000 to buy a bottle of primordial origin liquid that costs more than 100000, how can I have the nerve to compete with you? I’ll let you have it!</p><p>Qin qingfei’s mocking voice rang out.</p><p>“300000 going once, anyone else?”</p><p>Feng Xiu asked.</p><p>No one made a sound.</p><p>What a joke. A bottle of mid-grade primordial origin liquid that cost more than 100000 Supreme spiritual crystals was already the highest price. 300000 was too expensive. Who would bid for it?</p><p>Fengxiu asked three times but no one made a bid. This bottle of primordial origin liquid naturally belonged to Lu Ming.</p><p>After a short while, a young girl delivered the innate original fluid to guest room number 10.</p><p>young master, the president has said that you can pay for your spiritual crystals after the auction!</p><p>The young girl said in a sweet voice.</p><p>“Alright, thank you, miss!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and kept the primordial origin liquid.</p><p>“Brother Lu, do you have any treasures to auction?”</p><p>Fei Xue’s beautiful eyes flashed as she said.</p><p>Only treasures that were placed on auction could be paid for after the auction was over.</p><p>“Yes, there is one!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Fei Xue didn’t ask further, but she was curious.</p><p>The auction continued, and soon, another dozen items were sold.</p><p>I believe everyone has heard of the 198th item today. It’s the inter-domain token, which is a place to take the inter-domain teleportation formation!</p><p>I believe that everyone knows that the inter-province transportation formation consumes a terrifying amount of energy. Therefore, the cost of using it is extremely high. Even the nearest region would cost 100000 Supreme spiritual crystals. The further the distance, the more expensive the cost!</p><p>“Originally, there were two slots to be auctioned this time. However, the Empyrean heaven divine Palace has transferred one slot back at the last minute, leaving only one slot left. This slot can be used up to 20 large domains. Now, the starting price is 100000 Supreme spiritual crystals, and each bid must be at least 10000 spiritual crystals higher. Let the bidding begin!”</p><p>Feng Xiu announced.</p><p>“Only one left? I must get this one!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>“I bid one hundred and ten thousand!”</p><p>“I’ll pay 120000 dollars!”</p><p>……</p><p>As soon as Feng Xiu’s voice fell, someone immediately started bidding.</p><p>After all, the Empyrean heaven divine Palace would only give out one or two slots each time. How many people were there in the entire Hong domain?</p><p>There were always people who wanted to go to other large regions, so there were naturally many people bidding.</p><p>It didn’t take long for the price to rise to 200000.</p><p>“I will pay 250000. Everyone, this old man has an important matter to attend to at the flying snowflake domain. Please give it to this old man, this old man will be extremely grateful!”</p><p>An old voice sounded.</p><p>“You have something to do? Am I fine? I want to go to Liu heaven domain, I’ll pay two hundred and eighty thousand!”</p><p>A deep voice rang out, not giving in at all.</p><p>“Three hundred thousand.”</p><p>“Three hundred and twenty thousand!”</p><p>Very quickly, the price rose to a high of 400000.</p><p>Those who bid were all above the level of King tiers. Those below the level of King tiers would not be able to take out so many Supreme-grade spirit crystals.</p><p>“I’ll pay six hundred thousand!”</p><p>Suddenly, a voice rang out, shaking the entire place.</p><p>He had added 200000 Supreme spiritual crystals all of a sudden, showing his determination to get it.</p><p>“It’s vip Room No. 10!”</p><p>Someone looked at vip Room No. 10.</p><p>The one who made the bid was naturally Lu Ming.</p><p>He was determined to get this spot.</p><p>The crowd fell silent. 600000 Yuan was too much.</p><p>Moreover, who knew if Lu Ming would continue to increase the bid?</p><p>haha, this kid finally can’t help but raise the price. 600000 is too low.</p><p>In guest Room No. 5, Qin qingfei sneered and then spoke.</p><p>“Seven hundred thousand!”</p><p>Qin qingfei called out 700000 Supreme spiritual crystals.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold and he looked at vip Room No. 5.</p><p>“It’s this guy again. I knew he would cause trouble!”</p><p>Fei Xue gritted her teeth.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
