Although it wasn’t a very high price, one couldn’t measure the value of intent crystals.</p><p>On the market, even if you had 100000 Supreme-grade spirit crystals, you might not be able to buy 100 intent crystals.</p><p>There was a price but no market.</p><p>&Nbsp; moreover, there was an extremely high chance that mid-grade intent crystals would appear in the intent crystal vein.</p><p>Lu Ming definitely did not want to miss it.</p><p>whatever. I’ll improve my cultivation first. When I reach Lv 4 martial King realm and enter the lower tier of King’s realm, there won’t be many King’s realm that can kill me.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were shining.</p><p>Then, he took out all the storage rings of the 17 young men from the Sheng family, sorted out the Supreme-grade spiritual crystals in them, and counted them.</p><p>820,000 Supreme spiritual crystals.</p><p>In the storage rings of the 17 youths from the Sheng family, there were 820000 pieces of Supreme spiritual crystals.</p><p>Lu Ming was ecstatic. This was the first time he had so many top-grade spirit crystals. The Saint Jade alone had contributed 210000 pieces.</p><p>Lu Ming kept the best-grade spirit crystal happily. He had not checked the other items yet.</p><p>alright, let’s begin the breakthrough!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He waved his hand and 50000 pieces of top-grade spiritual crystals appeared.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>All 50,000 Supreme spiritual crystals exploded, and the rich spiritual Qi was devoured by the bloodline of the nine Dragons.</p><p>The endless spiritual Qi was transformed into essential core and Lu Ming began to break through to the fourth level of the martial King realm.</p><p>There was a dividing line between Lv 3 and Lv 4 martial King realm. Breaking through would greatly increase one’s strength, but it was also very difficult.</p><p>50,000 pieces of top-grade spiritual crystals were not enough. Lu Ming took out another 50000 pieces.</p><p>In this way, 50000 followed by 50000, Lu Ming had devoured 250000 pieces of top-grade spiritual crystals in total.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s body was constantly letting out rumbling sounds. The cyclone in his dantian was spinning wildly, and the rich and condensed essential core was like the water of a large river, rumbling and rumbling.</p><p>Two hours later, Lu Ming suddenly opened his eyes. In his eyes, two spearlights burst out.</p><p>I’ve finally broken through to the fourth level of the martial King realm!</p><p>Lu Ming walked out of the Supreme shrine and appeared on a mountain peak.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming circulated his quintessential essence and stomped his foot.</p><p>The foot full of vital essence stepped on the mountain peak. The mountain peak seemed to be bombarded by hundreds of millions of pounds of weight. It gave out a violent roar and then suddenly exploded.</p><p>Gravel flew and dust filled the air. It was like the end of the world.</p><p>With a single step, a thousand-meter tall mountain peak exploded into pieces. It was terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming floated in the air, carefully feeling the essential core in his body.</p><p>Lv 4 martial King realm is indeed powerful. The strength of the genuine vitality is seven times that of Lv 3 martial King realm. However, my combat strength has not improved so much.</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>An Ordinary Level four lower tier King warrior was two levels stronger than a level three king.</p><p>For example, Shengjiang had been a peak Lv 4 martial King, which meant that his combat strength was two levels higher than an average peak Lv 3 martial King.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had broken through to Lv 4 martial King realm, but his combat strength had not increased by two levels.</p><p>The reason why a Lv 4 martial King was so strong was that his true essence was much more condensed and powerful. Another reason was that he had a will.</p><p>A lower tier King’s intent realm had already entered the first level lower tier, which greatly increased one’s battle power.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s will had already reached the lower tier of level one. Now that he had reached the fourth level of the martial King realm, there was no improvement in his will. Therefore, Lu Ming’s combat strength had not increased by two levels but by more than one level.</p><p>Lu Ming estimated that if he went all out now, he would not be weaker than an early-stage sixth level martial King.</p><p>It should not be a problem for him to escape from a peak Lv 6 martial King.</p><p>when my fire concept condenses an intent rune, my combat strength will increase by a huge amount.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>there are still 570000 pieces of top-grade spiritual crystals. I’ll keep them for now. I’ll need them in many places after I get out!</p><p>now, let’s go to that power Upanishad crystal mine and take a look.</p><p>Lu Ming turned into a stream of light and flew at top speed to the address marked on the Jade card.</p><p>After flying for about a million miles, he was surrounded by boundless mountains. In the mountains, there were many scaled demon tribes.</p><p>However, the scaled demon tribes here were all large tribes with more than ten thousand members. There were many powerful existences among them. Lu Ming did not dare to have any thoughts of attacking such a large scaled Demon tribe alone.</p><p>If a late-stage King of the scaled demon race appeared, he would be dead for sure.</p><p>“It’s this area.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>According to the marks on the map, it should be in this area.</p><p>Lu Ming flew high up in the sky and hid in a cloud. He restrained his aura and merged with the cloud. Then, his essential core surged and the cloud slowly flew forward.</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze below.</p><p>After a while-</p><p>“It’s there!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Among the mountains below, there was a small mountain peak that was very strange.</p><p>The other peaks were covered in lush green grass and trees.</p><p>All the plants on this small mountain peak were fiery red, as if the entire mountain peak was wrapped in flames.</p><p>This small mountain was the intent crystal mine that shengyu had mentioned.</p><p>Lu Ming did not rush out immediately. Instead, he continued to hide in the clouds and drift while observing his surroundings.</p><p>A moment later, he made a discovery.</p><p>On a nearby mountain peak, Lu Ming noticed a figure flashing past.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming sensed carefully. Indeed, there were a large number of martial artists ‘auras on the surrounding mountains. There were at least a hundred of them.</p><p>These people had concealed their auras. If not for Lu Ming’s careful sensing, he would not have been able to sense them.</p><p>there’s a trap indeed. These people are most likely from the Sheng family. That shengyu really has bad intentions. He tricked me here. If I rush out like this, I’ll definitely be blown to pieces.</p><p>“However, what are these people from the Sheng family trying to do by hiding on the surrounding mountains? Who are you waiting for?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and various thoughts flashed through his mind.</p><p>Immediately, he restrained his aura with all his might and tried not to emit any aura to avoid being discovered by the Sheng family.</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the cloud and circled in the sky of this area, waiting.</p><p>On one of the mountain peaks, under an ancient tree, there were a few young figures sitting cross-legged.</p><p>“What the hell is this? Why isn’t that shengyu here yet? it’s already past the agreed time.”</p><p>One of the tall young men said unhappily.</p><p>I’ve received news that that guy is chasing after a guy named Lu Ming. He’s fighting to make a contribution in front of the young master of Xingchen.</p><p>Another young man with a pale face sneered.</p><p>that guy, shengyu, just wants to flatter young master Xingchen every day. Forget it, it’s not a big deal to lose a few dozen people from his side. He can come or not.</p><p>The tall young man snorted.</p><p>Then, they started to talk about other things in low voices.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
