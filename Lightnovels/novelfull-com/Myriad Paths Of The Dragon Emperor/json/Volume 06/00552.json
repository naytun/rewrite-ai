Are you alright? You little girl, I told you not to run around, but you didn’t listen!”</p><p>Xuan long got up from his seat and walked down. He carefully sized up Xuan Xiang and scolded with a smile.</p><p>Obviously, Xuan long had already received the news that Xuan Xiang and the others had encountered the corpse guards.</p><p>“Father, your daughter’s luck is as good as the heavens, and I will naturally have the help of a noble. Come, let me introduce you. This is Lu Ming, a peerless genius among the Ditian divine guards. Those corpse guards are completely powerless against Lord Lu Ming. Any lower tier King tier is completely useless!”</p><p>Xuan Xiang pulled Xuan Long’s arm and said with a smile. Then, she looked at Lu Ming and introduced him.</p><p>Xuan long and the rest laughed. They were not too concerned about how powerful Lu Ming was.</p><p>Lu Ming looked to be around twenty years old. Even if he was a genius among the Ditian divine guards, how strong could his cultivation and combat strength be? It was already amazing to be able to reach Lv 4 martial King realm.</p><p>To them, profound fragrance was simple and didn’t go out often. They were just a little excited to suddenly see a pretty good genius.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was the Ditian Divine Guard after all. Some rules could not be ignored.</p><p>“Lu Ming, thank you for saving me this time!” Xuan long cupped his fists.</p><p>you’re too kind, Grandmaster Xuan. It’s just a small matter!</p><p>Lu Ming replied with a bow.</p><p>“I heard that little brother is looking for me. I wonder what is it?”</p><p>Xuan long said.</p><p>“Grandmaster Xuan, it’s like this, elder Huang asked me to come.”</p><p>Lu Ming did not beat around the bush. He took out the small Pagoda that elder Huang had given him.</p><p>“Elder Huang!”</p><p>This time, not only Xuan long, but the other people in the hall also had a slight change in their expressions.</p><p>“It’s really old Huang!”</p><p>Xuan long sized up the pagoda, his face filled with respect. He could not help but think more highly of Lu Ming.</p><p>From what he knew, the small tower was elder Huang’s token and he would not give it to others easily. However, he had given it to Lu Ming. Lu Ming’s status in elder Huang’s heart was not low.</p><p>back then, elder Huang had done me a great favor, and even the weapon forging sect a great favor. It’s a pity that it’s been more than twenty years and elder Huang has never visited the weapon forging sect. May I know why you’ve called little brother over this time? ”</p><p>Xuan Long’s tone was much more polite as he asked.</p><p>“It’s nothing big. Elder Huang wants to refine a spirit weapon and is lacking in materials. He asked me to come here to see if I can ask for a piece of thousand refined blood gold from the sect master!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Thousand refined blood gold!”</p><p>Xuan long and the others ‘faces changed again.</p><p>“Thousand refined blood gold! You want the thousand-refined blood gold? Impossible, I can’t give you the thousand-refined blood gold!”</p><p>A voice was heard. It was Xuan Zhong.</p><p>At this moment, Xuan Zhong’s expression was unusually ugly. He looked at Lu Ming in an unfriendly manner and said,”Kid, do you know how precious the thousand refined blood gold is? We don’t even have enough for our own people. The entire weapon forging sect takes a few years to forge a single piece of thousand-refined blood gold. Who Do You Think You Are to ask for thousand-refined blood gold the moment you arrive? no way!”</p><p>“Xuan Zhong, shut up. What’s with your attitude? why are you talking to little brother Lu like that?”</p><p>Xuan long shouted and glared at Xuan Zhong.</p><p>“Sect master, I …”</p><p>Seeing Xuan long getting angry, Xuan Zhong was shocked and kept silent.</p><p>“Little brother Lu was entrusted by elder Huang to come here. What’s a mere thousand-refined blood gold worth? Little brother Lu, a piece of thousand-refined blood gold is not a problem!”</p><p>Xuan long said.</p><p>sect master, there’s only one piece of thousand-refined blood gold left in the sect. You said that it was for me. How can you give it to him now? ”</p><p>Xuan Zhong shouted again.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>At this moment, a man in his fifties with a long beard stood up and said, ” “Sect master, since we agreed to leave it for Zhong ‘er, then it’s his. We can’t just give it to him because of old Huang’s words. If old Huang wants it, that’s fine. We’ll forge another piece of thousand-refined blood gold in a few years, and I’ll personally deliver it to old Huang.”</p><p>This long-bearded man was the great elder of the weapon forging sect and also Xuan Zhong’s father, Xuan Yuan.</p><p>Xuan long frowned and said, ” elder Huang has not only helped me but also all of you. Without him, we wouldn’t be where we are today. I haven’t repaid this favor for many years.</p><p>since elder Huang has asked for it, there must be an urgent need for it. I have no reason to refuse. I have made up my mind. This thousand refined blood gold will be given to brother Lu. As for Xuan Zhong, you can wait a few years!</p><p>“No, sect master, I’m not convinced!”</p><p>Xuan Zhong shouted, ” who knows where this kid came from? who knows if he was summoned by some old Huang? even if he is, who does he think he is? what right does he have to take my thousand-refined blood gold? impossible! I won’t agree to this!</p><p>“Xuan Zhong, that piece of thousand-refined blood gold is not yours yet. Previously, father only said that he wanted to give it to you, but it was only on purpose.”</p><p>At this moment, Xuan Xiang glared at Xuan Zhong.</p><p>“Xiangxiang, you … Even you are … Good, good, very good!”</p><p>“Good,” Xuan Zhong said. He then looked at Lu Ming with a gloomy expression.”Kid, I don’t care who you are or who asked you to come. Treasures belong to the capable. If you want the thousand-refined blood gold, fine, but let’s see what you’re capable of. I heard you’re very strong. Come, fight me. If you can defeat me, I’ll give you the thousand-refined blood gold.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly. He did not expect that asking for a piece of thousand-refined blood gold would cause such a situation.</p><p>It seemed that the thousand-refined blood Gold’s value was beyond his imagination.</p><p>Lu Ming felt a little embarrassed. brother Xuan, there’s no need for a competition. How about this? I’ll buy this thousand-refined blood gold with spiritual crystals. What do you think? ”</p><p>“Buy it with crystals? Alright, I’ll sell it to you as long as you can give me 10 million top quality spiritual crystals.”</p><p>Xuan Zhong said with a cold smile.</p><p>Xuan long frowned.</p><p>Lu Ming also frowned.</p><p>“Xuan Zhong!”</p><p>Xuan Xiang glared at Xuan Zhong. you’re obviously making things difficult for me. How can a piece of thousand-refined blood gold cost 10 million Supreme-grade spirit crystals? ”</p><p>Xuan Zhong gritted his teeth and looked away from Xuan Xiang. He looked at Lu Ming with contempt and said,”What’s wrong? Kid, you don’t have any crystals, and you don’t dare to fight? What genius of the Ditian divine guards? Bullsh * t, you can only deceive Xiangxiang, who is relatively innocent. Now, show your true form. In my opinion, that old Huang who called you here is also a fake.”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming did not say anything, Xuan Zhong became even more aggressive.”Brat, if you kneel down and apologize now, then get lost, I’ll forgive you for deceiving me this time!”</p><p>“That’s enough, Xuan Zhong. Little brother Lu has elder Huang’s token. It can’t be fake. In the Tianxuan region, no one can get elder Huang’s token if he doesn’t want it!”</p><p>Xuan long scolded.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
