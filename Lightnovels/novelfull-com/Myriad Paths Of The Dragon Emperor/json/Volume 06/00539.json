It’s not much?”</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Sheng Fei and smiled faintly.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Sheng Fei bellowed, suppressing the shock in his heart as he charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming held his spear and charged forward, fighting with Sheng Fei.</p><p>The two of them seemed to be in a stalemate, and their battle was extremely intense.</p><p>Then, just like the battle with shengchuan earlier, Lu Ming slowly gained the upper hand after a few dozen moves.</p><p>Then, after a few dozen moves, Lu Ming defeated Sheng Fei with great difficulty, causing him to vomit blood.</p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded.</p><p>Lu Ming actually won again.</p><p>you’ve lost. Hand over the intent crystals.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Sheng Fei indifferently.</p><p>“I …”</p><p>Sheng Fei roared in his heart. He really didn’t want to hand it over, but when he thought of Sheng Chuan’s fate, he shuddered. He could only grit his teeth and hand over twenty intent crystals.</p><p>Lu Ming kept it happily, not forgetting to mumble, ” “What heroes of the Sheng family? they’re all trash!”</p><p>Of course, he didn’t lower his voice and it spread far and wide.</p><p>Immediately, the people of the Sheng family were in an uproar.</p><p>“This bastard is too arrogant.”</p><p>“Die, I want him to die!”</p><p>“Dammit, who’s going to kill him!”</p><p>Some young heroes of the Sheng family roared in anger.</p><p>Even some of the older generation were so angry that their eyes turned red.</p><p>However, no one came out to challenge Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was too strange. When he was fighting shengchuan, he seemed to be only a little stronger than shengchuan. However, after the battle with shengfei, his combat strength increased rapidly and he was a little stronger than shengfei.</p><p>None of them could tell if Lu Ming was still hiding his abilities.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming was simply unfathomable in their hearts.</p><p>“It turns out that the so-called heroes of the Sheng family are just cowardly rats!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“Little bastard, what did you say?”</p><p>“Say that again!”</p><p>The Sheng family’s heroes were furious.</p><p>“Isn’t it? If you don’t want to challenge me, then fine, I’ll challenge you now.”</p><p>Lu Ming pointed his spear in the direction of the young men from the Sheng family. His fighting spirit soared as he shouted, ” now, I’ll challenge you all. All of you, come at me together!</p><p>Come at me together!</p><p>The short six words were like a storm that swept through the entire scene.</p><p>The crowd around the divine guards ‘battle stage was in an uproar.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually taken the initiative to challenge them. He had even challenged all of the Sheng family’s heroes at once.</p><p>Crazy, he was crazy.</p><p>There were at least a hundred young geniuses from the Sheng family present.</p><p>There were also over 20 King tiers above the lower tier.</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to challenge all the Sheng family’s young men by himself.</p><p>This was an insult, a blatant insult. He was looking down on the many heroes of the Sheng family.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it, this brat should die!”</p><p>arrogant and ignorant! I’m going to kill him!</p><p>The heroes of the Sheng family roared in anger.</p><p>“What’s wrong? You only know how to scream? Don’t you dare to go on stage?”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to point his long spear at the young men and provoked them. There was a hint of madness in his eyes.</p><p>The reason why Lu Ming had repeatedly provoked the Sheng family today was to establish his might.</p><p>That’s right, show your might!</p><p>Ever since he came to Tianxuan city, he had been repeatedly provoked by the Sheng family. Wherever he went, the Sheng family would provoke him.</p><p>Lu Ming was already annoyed.</p><p>Since that was the case, he might as well go all out.</p><p>He had displayed his power and intimidated the Sheng family.</p><p>In this way, the Sheng family would surely calm down for a period of time.</p><p>Lu Ming took advantage of this period of time to improve his cultivation.</p><p>This was Lu Ming’s purpose.</p><p>They were already mortal enemies anyway, so he wasn’t afraid of offending them.</p><p>“Since you’re looking for death, we’ll fulfill your wish. Brothers, let’s go and teach him a good lesson.”</p><p>One of the Sheng family’s heroes bellowed and rushed towards the divine guards ‘fighting stage at top speed.</p><p>In a few breaths, he had covered a distance of ten miles and appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>He didn’t even try to hide his aura.</p><p>Late Lv 6 martial King realm.</p><p>He was much stronger than Sheng Fei.</p><p>“Go, go!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of the air being torn could be heard from all directions. The young men of the Sheng family rushed up to the fighting ring and surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>Nineteen people.</p><p>A total of 19 people.</p><p>All of them were at least Lv 4 martial King realm, and all of them were Kings of the lower tier.</p><p>As for those below the level of a lower tier King, there was no need for them to come up as they did not pose much of a threat to Lu Ming.</p><p>“And the two of us!”</p><p>With two long howls, two more young men from the crowd rushed up to the fighting ring.</p><p>One of them was wearing a red robe, while the other was wearing a green robe.</p><p>The two of them were extremely fast. In an instant, they had rushed up to the fighting ring, and the aura they emitted was extremely terrifying.</p><p>The peak of Lv 6 martial King realm!</p><p>“It’s Sheng Chong and Sheng lang!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>I heard that the two of them started their closed-door cultivation a few months ago, trying to break through to the late-stage King level. I didn’t expect them to come out now.</p><p>looks like he hasn’t succeeded. He’s still at the initial King tier, but he’s only one step away from the late-stage King tier.</p><p>Discussions could be heard all around.</p><p>On the fighting ring, the other heroes of the Sheng family were also overjoyed to see the two.</p><p>I didn’t expect that someone would look down on the Sheng family and provoke us after I’ve only been in seclusion for a few months. Hehe, he deserves to die ten thousand times!</p><p>The blue-robed young man, Sheng Chong, said coldly as his eyes opened and closed like huge waves.</p><p>that’s good. Today is a good day to show off our might. Don’t let others think that our Sheng family has no one else.</p><p>The Holy Wolf’s eyes flashed with a fierce light, like a wild beast.</p><p>A total of twenty-one people surrounded Lu Ming. Their combined aura was extremely terrifying.</p><p>are you all here yet? if you’re all here, then let’s start the battle. I’m too lazy to bet with you all on some intent crystals.</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly. He looked calm as if he did not feel any pressure despite being surrounded by so many people.</p><p>“You’re pretending to be relaxed. I’d like to see what kind of strength you have. Make your move!”</p><p>Sheng Chong shouted coldly.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Instantly, the fighting ring went berserk. Twenty-one auras soared into the sky and the twenty-one attacks converged, crushing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Yes, crushed. Lu Ming could not avoid it and could only take it head-on.</p><p>he’s dead. Lu Ming is dead for sure. Under this move, anyone below the level of a King tier can only die!</p><p>“Who can you blame for your own death? Do you really think that you can be so arrogant after defeating Sheng Fei and Sheng Chuan?”</p><p>even if he has the combat strength of a peak Lv 6 martial King, he’s still going to die!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming exploded.</p><p>The second bloodline merged with his body, and his true Yuan circulated to the extreme.</p><p>At the same time, the fusion of the three intents erupted.</p><p>An unimaginable spear light shot up into the sky.</p><p>The spear radiance seemed to be able to pierce through the heavens and earth.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The joint attack of 21 Sheng family heroes was shattered by this spear light.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>“LAN Yue!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted, his long hair flying in the wind. The long spear in his hand grew to a thousand meters long and swept out.</p><p>A full moon appeared on the fighting ring.</p><p>The moon was a move of the fire gun execution. However, with Lu Ming’s current cultivation level, it displayed a terrifying power.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
