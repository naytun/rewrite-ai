He was a little disappointed.</p><p>The profound meaning crystal pit exuded an aura of earth intent, which meant that this deep pit contained earth element intent crystals.</p><p>He couldn’t use the earth element intent crystals directly, so he could only exchange them.</p><p>“Let’s start digging!”</p><p>let’s go, ” Lu Ming said. He walked to the big pit, took out a big knife, and started to dig.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The big knife chopped down, and it actually made a clanging sound. The stone in the big pit was actually extremely hard.</p><p>However, under Lu Ming’s powerful essential core, they were still cut off piece by piece.</p><p>“Let’s attack together!”</p><p>let’s go! han man called out. Mu Sen and the others walked into the pit, took out various weapons, and began to dig.</p><p>The five of them worked together and were very fast. Soon, they had dug out a pit that was three meters wide and ten meters deep.</p><p>At this moment, the aura of the creation of Earth beneath his feet became even more intense.</p><p>The five people’s spirits were shaken, and they began to dig even harder.</p><p>Not long after, the pit was dug to a depth of 20 meters.</p><p>there’s an intent crystal here!</p><p>A clear and excited voice rang out.</p><p>It was Yao Xuan. He didn’t expect Yao Xuan to be the first one to find an intent crystal.</p><p>Everyone looked over. On the stone wall in front of Yao Xuan, there was a khaki-colored intent crystal embedded in it. It exuded a strong aura of the intent of earth.</p><p>“Miss Yao, put it away first!”</p><p>Han man said.</p><p>Yao Xuan nodded. She carefully dug out the power Upanishad crystal and put it into a Jade box.</p><p>Then, everyone started to dig even harder.</p><p>With Yao Xuan’s good start, everyone’s harvest came. More and more intent crystals were dug out.</p><p>&Nbsp; these intent crystals had been buried deep in the earth and had only formed after countless years.</p><p>&Nbsp; the five of them continued to dig, and they found more and more intent crystals.</p><p>Two hours later, the five of them had dug the pit to ten meters wide and fifty meters deep. They had obtained a total of twenty-six earth element intent crystals.</p><p>haha, I didn’t think that there would be more than twenty intent crystals in this pit. It’s already pretty good.</p><p>Han man said with a smile.</p><p>At this point, not a single trace of the earth concept could be felt from the deep pit. This meant that they had already excavated all the profound crystal stones in this pit.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly felt that there was a stone under his feet. It was extremely special.</p><p>The stone was the size of a human head. Lu Ming had dug it out and put it aside casually. However, he realized that the color of the stone was different from the surrounding stones.</p><p>This stone seemed to be crystallized, and its surface was emitting a faint fluorescent light.</p><p>Lu Ming casually slashed the stone.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Sparks flew when the saber slashed down and Lu Ming’s saber bounced back.</p><p>“It’s so hard?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>The saber in his hand was an upper fourth level spiritual weapon. It was extremely sharp and could cut a mountain in half with a casual slash. However, the stone was not cut open and only left a mark on it.</p><p>Han man and the others also looked over curiously.</p><p>“Interesting!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. The vital essence in his body surged wildly toward the saber. At the same time, the three concepts were integrated into the saber.</p><p>Immediately, he slashed at the stone.</p><p>?…</p><p>A violent sound of friction was heard and sparks flew in all directions. The rock was still not cut open, but it cracked.</p><p>At the same time, an unbelievably strong concept of earth spread out from the stone.</p><p>“This … How can this intent be so dense?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>Han man and the others also widened their eyes in shock.</p><p>This intent of earth was simply too dense and intense. The other earth element intent crystals were like trash in front of this intent of earth.</p><p>Lu Ming could feel his heart beating faster.</p><p>With a move of his hand, the saber in Lu Ming’s hand disappeared and a big hammer appeared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sledgehammer smashed down on the rock.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Broken stones flew everywhere. The stone finally cracked completely, revealing what was inside.</p><p>It was a crystal, a glistening yellow crystal.</p><p>This crystal exuded a strong intent realm of heaven and earth. Everyone seemed to be able to see the power Upanishad threads floating in the sky.</p><p>this, this, could this be a middle-grade earth-attribute intent crystal? ”</p><p>Han man’s voice trembled as he growled. His eyes were burning with passion.</p><p>middle-grade intent crystals? ”</p><p>The others were also shocked. Their eyes were wide open as they stared at the crystal.</p><p>middle-grade intent crystals? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was also extremely shocked. Then, his quintessential essence exploded and with a sweep, he caught the esoteric crystal in his hand.</p><p>The others ‘gazes immediately gathered on Lu Ming’s palm.</p><p>alright, now, let’s distribute the intent crystals!</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>Han man, mu Sen, and Mu Lin looked at each other, and then their eyes flashed.</p><p>how about this? this time, it’s all thanks to brother Lu that we were able to enter this place. If it weren’t for brother Lu killing the heavenly corpse sect’s corpse guard, we would have had to retreat and wouldn’t have had the chance to excavate the profound meaning crystal. So, I suggest that the mid-grade profound meaning crystal will belong to brother Lu, and we’ll split the other low-grade profound meaning crystals equally. What do you think? ”</p><p>Han man suggested.</p><p>“Alright, I have no objections!”</p><p>“I also have no objections!”</p><p>Mu Sen and Mu Lin spoke one after the other. They were very straightforward.</p><p>Yao Xuan was the only one who looked at Lu Ming with a complicated gaze. She was reluctant to part with him.</p><p>After all, middle-grade intent crystals were too precious.</p><p>Finally, Yao Xuan gritted her teeth and whispered, ” “I also have no objections!”</p><p>“Then, thank you, everyone!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and unceremoniously took the middle-grade profound meaning crystal for himself.</p><p>&Nbsp; afterward, they distributed the low-grade intent crystals.</p><p>There were a total of 26 pieces, five for each of them. Han man took out 1000 top quality spirit crystals to buy the extra piece, and then split the remaining 1000 equally.</p><p>Lu Ming did not mind. He kept the esoteric crystals and spirit crystals casually.</p><p>“Let’s destroy those refined corpses. Otherwise, if the people of the heavenly corpse sect come across them and take them back, they’ll be a disaster!”</p><p>Han man suggested.</p><p>Everyone nodded.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and the Thunder concept turned into spear lights and flew out, turning the refined corpses into charcoal.</p><p>After finishing them off, the five of them rose into the air and left.</p><p>In the next two days, the five of them searched within a radius of hundreds of thousands of miles. They did encounter another tribe of the scaled demon race, but this tribe was too big. Roughly estimating, there were more than 10000 of them.</p><p>They observed from afar and discovered that there were at least five scaled demon race experts. They weren’t someone they could deal with.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
