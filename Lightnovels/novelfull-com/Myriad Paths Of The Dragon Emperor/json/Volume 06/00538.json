Now that he had been beaten so badly, they felt that they had lost all their face.</p><p>...</p><p>A murderous look flashed in sacred glory’s eyes. It really wanted to rush forward and slap Lu Ming to death.</p><p>However, this was the divine guards ‘battle platform. As an elder, he didn’t dare to make a move.</p><p>There were some rules that even the Sheng family did not dare to violate.</p><p>His Sheng clan was the Overlord of the Tianxuan region, but in the face of the entire empyrean heaven divine Palace, they were still like ants.</p><p>“A bunch of animals, what are you quarreling about?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the youths from the Sheng family and berated them loudly. He was as arrogant as he could be.</p><p>“Damn it …”</p><p>The heroes of the Sheng family were so angry that their eyes turned red.</p><p>They were the heroes of the Sheng family. Usually, they were high and mighty.</p><p>In the Tianxuan region, they were the Kings. Even if they went to some high-tier empires, the ancestors and emperors of those high-tier empires would have to be respectful in front of them.</p><p>Since when did anyone dare to scold them?</p><p>He even dared to call them animals in front of so many people?</p><p>Their killing intent was almost out of control.</p><p>“Ah, I can’t take it anymore. Little bastard, I want to challenge you. Do you dare to accept my challenge?”</p><p>A hero of the Sheng family roared.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He immediately looked at the young man and said, ” “You want to challenge me? Do you have any wind attribute intent crystals? If you don’t, don’t bother me. ”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand with an impatient expression.</p><p>“Wind attribute intent crystals? I’ll borrow it!”</p><p>The young man gritted his teeth and asked the people around him to lend it to him.</p><p>Many people had to give face to the heroes of the Sheng family. Very quickly, this person managed to borrow twenty wind attribute intent crystals.</p><p>now, I have twenty wind attribute intent crystals. Do you dare to accept my challenge? ”</p><p>The young man shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and the smile on his lips widened.”Oh? Fine, I agree to fight you!”</p><p>As soon as these words came out, there was an uproar.</p><p>Lu Ming actually accepted Sheng Fei’s challenge? ”</p><p>haha, he’s finished. He probably doesn’t know Sheng Fei’s cultivation. Sheng Fei has already reached the early stage of Lv 6 martial King realm. Shengchuan can’t even withstand a single blow from Sheng Fei.</p><p>that’s right. Lu Ming’s combat strength is only slightly higher than shengchuan’S. He’s dead. I’ll have to spit out everything I’ve just taken.</p><p>“Hahaha!” Hearing Lu Ming’s agreement, Sheng Fei was overjoyed. In a flash, he went up to the divine guards ‘battle platform.</p><p>Even within the no-fly zone of Tianxuan city, it still appeared to be very light.</p><p>Sheng Fei ascended the divine guards ‘battle platform and quickly appeared in front of Lu Ming. His eyes were filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, you shouldn’t have accepted my challenge. It’s too late to regret it now.”</p><p>Sheng Fei laughed.</p><p>just now, shengchuan seemed to be so arrogant. In the end, he still cried for his parents.</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips.</p><p>Below the fighting ring, shengchuan, who was recuperating, almost vomited blood.</p><p>Who was crying for their parents? He was just roaring angrily just now. He was not crying for his parents. Lu Ming was just spouting nonsense. If word of this got out, he would not be able to survive.</p><p>“Don’t compare me to that good-for-nothing shengchuan!”</p><p>Sheng Fei sneered.</p><p>“In my eyes, you are all trash.”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>Below the fighting ring, Sheng Chuan was trembling. He was shouting in his heart, ” if you want to fight, then fight. Don’t always drag me into it. I’m already miserable enough.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Sheng Fei bellowed. His killing intent was extremely cold. A terrifying aura burst out from his body.</p><p>At the same time, a powerful wind concept spread out from him.</p><p>It was as if a force 12 wind was blowing in the world.</p><p>The strength of his aura was several times stronger than that of the holy river.</p><p>Sheng Fei has comprehended the creation of wind. His moves are as fast as lightning and his attacks are like a storm. He’s unrivaled. With Lu Ming’s combat strength, I don’t think he can withstand ten moves.</p><p>“Ten moves? It’ll be good enough if he can withstand three moves. I reckon that Lu Ming must be regretting his decision now. He probably didn’t expect Sheng Fei to be so powerful.”</p><p>In the surroundings, many people were discussing and expressing their own opinions.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A long, thin sword appeared in Sheng Fei’s hand.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Sheng Fei’s body moved and he made his move.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>In an instant, countless sword Qi burst out from Sheng Fei’s hands, covering the entire sky and earth, sweeping toward Lu Ming.</p><p>It was too fast.</p><p>“Lu Ming is finished.”</p><p>Many people thought.</p><p>However, in the next moment, Lu Ming’s figure moved. His figure flickered continuously, shuttling back and forth between the sword Qi that filled the sky, trying his best to avoid them.</p><p>Although it was very dangerous, Lu Ming managed to avoid them one by one.</p><p>Many people were dumbfounded.</p><p>nest, I know. Lu Ming has also comprehended the concept of wind. That’s why he was able to avoid it.</p><p>it can’t be. I saw that his Thunder will had already reached level one lower tier. Could it be that he has also comprehended the wind will and condensed will runes? ”</p><p>“That’s terrifying.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s body exuded the concept of wind as he sensed the changes in the wind around him.</p><p>Although his wind concept was not as profound as Sheng Fei’s, it was enough to avoid the sword Qi.</p><p>“Hmph, then I’ll use my strength to defeat you.”</p><p>die! Sheng Fei shouted coldly, and the sword Qi that filled the sky disappeared instantly.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The sword Qi that filled the sky seemed to have condensed into a ray of crystal-clear green sword Qi. It instantly pierced through the void and stabbed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>He wanted to crush Lu Ming with his powerful cultivation of Lv 6 martial King realm.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed and he thrust his spear.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The tip of the spear and the tip of the sword collided.</p><p>Instantly, sword Qi and spear radiance burst out in all directions.</p><p>Sheng Fei’s body trembled, and his expression changed drastically. He took a dozen steps back.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming also took more than ten steps back symbolically.</p><p>In the eyes of outsiders, it was a peaceful life.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The entire place was in an uproar.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually blocked Sheng Fei’s attack in a head-on attack. How was this possible? What was going on?</p><p>Wasn’t lu Ming only a little stronger than shengchuan just now?</p><p>How could he block Sheng Fei’s attack now?</p><p>“He’s hiding his strength. Lu Ming definitely hid his strength just now.”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>Everyone came to a sudden realization. Yes, that was the only possibility.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually hidden his ability just now. What did he want to do? Could it be that he wanted to lure Saint down here to earn intent crystals?</p><p>Some quick-witted people had already thought of this, and they couldn’t help but be stunned.</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely bold. He actually used this method to earn the esoteric crystals of the Sheng family’s heroes.</p><p>“This … This …”</p><p>Among the crowd, Sheng Yao and Sheng Wushuang were the most shocked.</p><p>This was because a few months ago, when they were in the eastern Palace, Lu Ming was far from being this powerful. It had only been a short while and he had already reached this level. He was simply a monster.</p><p>Especially Sheng Wushuang, who was almost scared to death.</p><p>When Lu Ming had first joined the Ditian divine guards, he had not even been a half-step King. At that time, he could have completely crushed Lu Ming with his strength.</p><p>But now? He was not even fit to carry Lu Ming’s shoes.</p><p>“Why is it like this? Why is it like this?”</p><p>Sheng Wushuang started to doubt his life.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
