The two refined corpses paused for a moment, like wood.</p><p>Just this one moment was enough.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure dashed past and charged at the corpse guard.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>That corpse guard shouted loudly. Sensing danger approaching, he wanted to control the refined corpse to return and help while retreating at the same time.</p><p>But it was too late.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Lu Ming’s shot pierced through the corpse Guard’s heart.</p><p>A corpse guard at the early stage of the LV 6 martial King realm had died!</p><p>As soon as he died, the two refined corpses he was controlling stopped in the air.</p><p>The remaining Lv 6 martial King realm corpse guard had wanted to help, but upon seeing this, he retreated frantically.</p><p>He controlled the three corpse guards to tightly surround him.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered but he did not pursue.</p><p>Once a corpse guard controlled the refined corpse to defend with all its might, it would be more difficult to kill.</p><p>Only like just now, with the momentum of a Thunderbolt, catching them off guard, could he easily kill those corpse guards.</p><p>The four corpse guards took the nine refined corpses and fled madly, disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The final winner of this battle was Lu Ming.</p><p>This was only possible after Lu Ming had broken through to the lower tier of the king tier. Before that, he would not have been able to do it.</p><p>“Seal the corpse Guard’s soul first!”</p><p>With a wave of his hand, dozens of soul-sealing crystals appeared. Under the control of Lu Ming’s quintessential essence, they flew toward the corpse guards ‘corpses. Then, Lu Ming injected his quintessential essence through the air and the soul-sealing crystals glowed, sealing the corpse guards’ souls into the soul-sealing crystals.</p><p>When it was over, Lu Ming waved his hand and dozens of soul-sealing crystals flew back into his hands.</p><p>Lu Ming’s face was filled with joy. Just the corpse Guard’s souls in these soul-sealing crystals alone would be able to obtain many rewards.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he took off all the storage rings of the Sheng family and corpse guards.</p><p>Of course, he also devoured the blood essence of the Sheng family.</p><p>so many storage rings. How many spiritual crystals are there? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart was burning and his eyes flashed with excitement.</p><p>However, now was not the time to think about this. The esoteric crystal vein had not been excavated yet. Lu Ming did not have much time left.</p><p>Whether it was the Sheng family or the heavenly corpse sect, they would all bring people back.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming took out a huge battleaxe and swung it at the small mountain.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Broken rocks flew everywhere, and a large piece of the small mountain was split off.</p><p>This was an esoteric crystal mine and the ground was unusually hard. If it were an ordinary mountain, Lu Ming’s axe could easily split it in half.</p><p>However, now that Lu Ming’s cultivation level had improved greatly, it would be very fast for him to dig.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his battle axe and hacked continuously. Soon, large pieces of rocks were sent flying. The entire world was filled with a strong concept of fire.</p><p>“Fire concept!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He was short of fire esoteric crystals now. If he could find a middle-grade fire-element esoteric crystal, he would be able to make a breakthrough in his fire concept.</p><p>“One piece!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming saw a fiery-red ultimacy crystal embedded in the rock below.</p><p>Overjoyed, Lu Ming kept the fire-type ultimacy crystals and continued to dig with all his might.</p><p>&Nbsp; next, more and more intent crystals were excavated.</p><p>One, two …</p><p>Ten pieces, twenty pieces …</p><p>As expected of an esoteric crystal mine. There were many esoteric crystals, and the esoteric crystal pit simply couldn’t compare to it.</p><p>Two hours later, the entire mountain peak had disappeared. Lu Ming had already dug out three hundred pieces of intent crystals.</p><p>Yes, a total of three hundred fire attribute intent crystals.</p><p>He had struck it rich. Lu Ming felt that he had struck it rich.</p><p>However, he had not found any middle-grade profound meaning crystals. This was Lu Ming’s true goal.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to dig. He dug a few meters deeper into the mountain peak, but there was still nothing. He did not even see a low-grade profound meaning crystal.</p><p>“Is there really nothing? This might be a small mine, but it should still be able to produce mid-grade profound meaning crystals, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming was unwilling to give up and continued digging.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming’s battleaxe hit a hard stone but it did not split open.</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Below, a stone the size of a human’s head was revealed. The color of this stone was different from the other stones. It was deeper and more fiery red.</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly thought of the time when he obtained the earth attribute middle-grade profound meaning crystal. Didn’t he also find it in a special stone?</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He raised the battleaxe, his essential core burst forth, and he hacked at the stone.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>A crack appeared on the rock.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming changed to the back of the axe and struck the stone.</p><p>&Nbsp; ka ka …</p><p>The stone cracked, and the cracks spread like a spider web across the entire stone. More and more cracks appeared, and finally, the entire stone cracked.</p><p>An extremely powerful fire Heaven Earth concept spread out.</p><p>In the middle of the stone, there was a fiery red crystal lying quietly inside. It was crystal clear and dazzling, extremely eye-catching.</p><p>A middle-grade fire-type intent crystal!</p><p>Lu Ming looked excited. He used his vital essence and grabbed the esoteric crystal in his hand. Then, he put it into a Jade box and kept it.</p><p>“The harvest this time is not bad, not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s face was full of smiles. He was very satisfied.</p><p>now, let’s find a place to condense the fire concept runes. Then, we’ll return to Tianxuan city to complete the mission.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and swept his gaze across the room.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, the power of Thunder spread out and turned the unmoving refined corpses into charcoal.</p><p>Thereafter, Lu Ming soared into the sky and left the place.</p><p>A million miles away, Lu Ming entered the Supreme shrine and sat cross-legged, with the path-understanding ancient tree’s tender shoots placed beside him.</p><p>During this period of time, the clear spring in the jade box had decreased a lot. There was only a small layer left. The young sprout of the path-understanding ancient tree was even more lustrous and the aura it emitted was even more mysterious.</p><p>As for the other branch, it didn’t move at all.</p><p>Lu Ming estimated that the branch had most likely withered completely and could not be alive anymore.</p><p>Moreover, there were rumors that the same kind of path-understanding tree could only exist once in the world. It was impossible for two identical path-understanding trees to exist. This was the law of heaven and earth.</p><p>looks like I’ll have to look for some spiritual liquid after I get out. Otherwise, it’ll be a miracle if the path-understanding ancient tree doesn’t wither, let alone grow.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>&Nbsp; with a wave of his hand, the fire-element middle-rank intent crystal appeared.</p><p>I should be able to successfully form the middle-grade intent crystals with the help of the ancient tree of comprehension!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed and he squeezed hard.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The middle-grade profound meaning crystal exploded, and waves of extremely intense fire heaven and earth intent realm filled the entire area. Lu Ming could even see that there were dense threads of intent realm floating around him.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately closed his eyes and tried his best to comprehend it.</p><p>All around him, the intent threads continued to enter the space between Lu Ming’s eyebrows. Lu Ming’s comprehension of the intent of fire increased rapidly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
