Hehe, it’s not that easy to get the token!</p><p>Qin qingfei sneered and closed the window.</p><p>There was a gloominess in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>More and more people gathered in the hall. In the end, there were at least twenty thousand people.</p><p>One must know that there was a requirement to enter the heavenly secret auction house. One must be at least a martial King. Those below the martial King realm were not allowed to enter.</p><p>In other words, the 20000 people present were all martial artists above the martial King realm.</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly amazed. The abilities of the Grand domain were indeed powerful. It was not something that the Tianxuan region could compare to.</p><p>There were less than 20000 martial Kings in the Tianxuan region. But now, there were more than 20000 people in an auction.</p><p>There was no way to compare.</p><p>At this moment, a white-robed, refined-looking middle-aged man walked onto the stage.</p><p>“The branch president of graceful wind is here!”</p><p>As soon as this middle-aged man went on stage, the entire place fell silent, as if he had a great deterrent force.</p><p>The middle-aged man smiled and said, ” I believe many of you know me, but there are some new friends who don’t. Let me introduce myself again. My name is Feng Xiu, and I’m the president of the secret Chamber of Commerce’s branch in the Hong domain. I’m the host of this auction, ” the elder said.</p><p>this time, there are a total of 218 treasures to be auctioned. They are definitely of the highest quality. I hope everyone will be satisfied. Alright, time is limited. Let’s start the first auction of the day!</p><p>Feng Xiu went straight to the point and announced the start of the auction.</p><p>Immediately, a beautiful young lady walked over with a tray.</p><p>There was a drawing on the tray.</p><p>Feng Xiu opened the drawing and saw that it was a lightning bolt.</p><p>I believe everyone has already seen that this is an inscription scroll. As long as you inject your vital essence into it, you can activate the inscription on the scroll and launch a fatal attack. The power of this lightning inscription scroll is equivalent to the strongest attack of a peak Lv 7 martial King. The starting price is 10000 spiritual crystals of the highest quality, and the price increment must not be less than 1000 spiritual crystals!</p><p>After Feng Xiu’s introduction, she stated her starting price.</p><p>“It’s an inscription scroll. This thing is very rare. It can save your life at a critical moment.”</p><p>and its power is equivalent to the full-force attack of a level Seven martial King. If used well, it can even kill a level Seven martial King.</p><p>I’ll take it. I’ll pay 12000 Supreme spiritual crystals!</p><p>There was a wave of discussion in the venue, and someone immediately began to bid.</p><p>“It’s an inscription scroll!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>Inscription scrolls were scrolls refined by inscription Masters, but ordinary inscription Masters couldn’t refine them at all.</p><p>In order to refine an inscription scroll, the first condition was that one must be a pure inscription master.</p><p>In fact, most of the so-called inscription Masters were not pure. They mainly cultivated martial arts with inscriptions as a supplement.</p><p>Most Warriors would practice the Dao of inscription to aid their cultivation of martial arts.</p><p>None of them were pure inscription Masters.</p><p>Without a pure inscriber, one would not be able to refine inscription scrolls. In the Tianxuan region, there was not a single pure inscriber.</p><p>As the saying goes, a person’s energy is limited. If one wanted to become a pure inscriber, he would need to spend a lot of energy, and his martial cultivation would definitely not be too high.</p><p>Besides, a pure inscriber’s combat ability was extremely low before level five. They could not be compared to martial artists.</p><p>However, a pure inscriber would undergo a qualitative change once they broke through to the fifth rank. Their combat abilities would become extremely terrifying, and their combat methods would be extremely mysterious.</p><p>Therefore, there was another name for a pure inscriber, and that was ‘true’. An inscription master.</p><p>A true inscription master, a true inscription master.</p><p>Lu Ming had read about these in the books in the past. He did not expect to see an inscription talisman that was refined by a true inscription Alchemist.</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was in the process of thinking, the price rose steadily.</p><p>It had already exceeded 20000 Supreme spiritual crystals.</p><p>“What a bunch of country bumpkins. How could someone want such a trashy inscription talisman scroll? back then, I casually refined an inscription talisman scroll, and it was a hundred thousand times, a million times better than this.”</p><p>Dandan was lying on Lu Ming’s shoulder with one leg crossed. She was holding a level 5 spiritual herb that she had painstakingly soaked in Lu Ming’s water and was chewing on it.</p><p>As he gnawed, he muttered, his face full of disdain.</p><p>“Oh, then why don’t you make one for me?”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips.</p><p>“Hmph, I’m injured now. Otherwise, it would have been a matter of minutes.”</p><p>Dandan boasted shamelessly.</p><p>At the side, Fei Xue looked at dandan with interest.</p><p>“Brother Lu, your turtle demonic beast is quite fun.”</p><p>Fei Xue laughed.</p><p>When demonic beasts reached the king level, they could speak. Fei Xue did not find it strange.</p><p>“This guy, other than bragging, he only knows how to eat. He has no other use.”</p><p>Lu Ming said casually.</p><p>Upon hearing this, dandan could not take it anymore. She jumped up from Lu Ming’s shoulder, widened her eyes, and shouted, ” “Kid, what did you say? How dare you say that I’m useless? how dare you look down on me? I’m the head of the top ten war beasts, my might is unparalleled in the world, and I’m invincible!”</p><p>Dandan pointed at Lu Ming with one claw and spoke like an old man. However, her voice was young and tender, like a three-year-old child, causing Fei Xue to giggle non-stop.</p><p>“Come on, just stay here obediently.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and went to grab dandan’s small head.</p><p>“Preposterous, I’ll bite!”</p><p>Dandan bared her teeth and opened her mouth to bite Lu Ming’s finger.</p><p>“Nest, you dare to bite me!”</p><p>Lu Ming was caught off guard. Dandan bit his finger and he could not shake it off.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming surrendered and took out a level five spiritual herb. Only then did he release his mouth in anger.</p><p>“Now you know how powerful I am!”</p><p>Dandan was very pleased with herself and hid to the side to gnaw on spirit herbs.</p><p>“This guy is the reincarnation of a peerless expert?”</p><p>Lu Ming did not believe it at all.</p><p>At that moment, the inscription scroll had been sold for 35000 top quality spiritual crystals.</p><p>After all, although the inscription scrolls were powerful, they were only one-time use. They would disappear once they were used, so their price wouldn’t be too ridiculous.</p><p>Next, Feng Xiu took out the second item, an upper Lv 5 alchemy furnace.</p><p>Alchemy cauldrons were extremely rare, which was why their price was several times higher than normal spiritual weapons.</p><p>The upper Lv 5 alchemy furnace was sold for 120000 Supreme spiritual crystals.</p><p>Then, one item after another was taken out for auction.</p><p>Refining materials, spirit herbs, spirit weapons, cultivation methods, secret manuals, and even demonic beasts and battle pets were available.</p><p>However, although these treasures were precious, Lu Ming was not interested in any of them.</p><p>The other VIP rooms on the second floor also didn’t speak.</p><p>Everyone knew that these people were waiting for the treasures to come.</p><p>The further one progressed, the more precious the treasures would be.</p><p>the 156th treasure is a bottle of primordial origin liquid. It’s a mid-grade primordial origin liquid. I believe I don’t need to explain its function. Everyone knows that it’s the top sacred product for cultivating the body!</p><p>Feng Xiu held a Jade bottle in her hand and said loudly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
