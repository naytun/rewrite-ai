If you can defeat me, I don’t mind staying!”</p><p>...</p><p>A powerful aura soared into the sky, breaking through Qin Qingshan’s pressure in one go.</p><p>That’s right, Qin Qingshan’s ranking was one rank lower than sacred constellation’s. If even Qin Qingshan couldn’t be defeated, then even if they returned to Tianxuan region, they most likely wouldn’t be a match for sacred constellation. Then, what difference would it make if they returned or not?</p><p>“If you have the guts, let me see what capital you have.”</p><p>An extremely cold intent spread out from Qin Qingshan’s body. The surrounding temperature dropped rapidly, and a layer of ice even formed on the ground.</p><p>Ice concept.</p><p>What Qin Qingshan had comprehended was the ice concept.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>An ice-cold blade light rushed out of Qin Qingshan’s body. It was incomparably cold as it slashed towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fist in the air. A long spear condensed and he thrust it forward.</p><p>This spear attack only contained the intent of Wind and Fire.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The saber radiance and the spear radiance collided with each other. The force shot out in all directions. Ice and Fire filled the air, and the wind howled.</p><p>Kachakachaa!</p><p>The armored soldiers moved their bodies and stood in a row. Their bodies emitted rays of true essence light, which offset all the scattered Qi.</p><p>Qin qingfei retreated rapidly, avoiding the rapid Qi.</p><p>As for Fei Xue, she took a few steps back and dodged the force. Her beautiful eyes were fixed on the field.</p><p>As for Qin qingfei’s eighth uncle, he took two steps back and blocked the force.</p><p>After the explosion, Lu Ming and Qin Qingshan did not move at all.</p><p>so you’ve comprehended two intents. Interesting. Take this, proud snow ice blade slash!</p><p>die! Qin Qingshan shouted coldly. An even more powerful blade light burst out and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>This was a blade light that was completely condensed with intent and true essence. It was bone-chilling and wherever the blade light passed, snow-white ice crystals appeared in the space.</p><p>This blade was stronger than the previous one.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s body was surrounded by flames. In the flames, there were traces of lightning. Outside the lightning, the wind was whistling.</p><p>Wind, fire, and Thunder, all three intents erupted at the same time.</p><p>“True dragon Strike!”</p><p>A three-colored true dragon roared and flew out, clashing with the icy saber radiance.</p><p>Instantly, intent realm filled the air and true essence began to abuse him.</p><p>On Qin Qingshan’s side, waves of cold air spread out, forming a thick layer of ice crystals on the ground.</p><p>On Lu Ming’s side, the concept of three colors was raging.</p><p>This move once again ended in a draw.</p><p>“Three intents!” He exclaimed.</p><p>Qin Qingshan’s face was extremely gloomy.</p><p>As for Qin qingfei, Fei Xue, and the others, they were all dumbfounded.</p><p>Lu Ming’s strength had exceeded their expectations.</p><p>“Not bad, you can make me serious!”</p><p>Qin Qingshan’s voice resounded. His palm glowed, and a battle saber that was suffused with an incomparably cold intent appeared in his hand.</p><p>“Is it just serious?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a sneer. The wind Lightning Spear appeared in his hands. A surging fighting spirit rose and a ray of spear light soared into the sky.</p><p>“Proud snow eight slashes!”</p><p>die! Qin Qingshan shouted softly. His body brought with it a gust of cold wind as he pounced toward Lu Ming. A snow-white and icy blade light burst out from Qin Qingshan’s hand. After the first slash, the second slash followed.</p><p>Saber after saber, the power was incomparably terrifying.</p><p>At this moment, the vital essence in Lu Ming’s body was also boiling. His strong seventh-grade body also burst out. Combined with the three concepts, it turned into a dazzling spear light and blasted out.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two figures collided with each other. The saber and spear lights bombarded each other wantonly. The sky and the earth trembled slightly under the collision of the two, as if they could not withstand the power of the two.</p><p>The two of them fought from the ground to the sky, exchanging dozens of moves in an instant.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Then, the two of them separated and stood on opposite sides of the void.</p><p>Qin Qingshan’s eyes were incomparably gloomy. His killing intent was like a storm.</p><p>He was a top talent on the list of top 1000 talents in the eastern barren territory. Throughout history, he was the only one who could defeat someone of a higher level.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming, who was only at the peak of the ninth level of the martial King realm, had challenged him, and he could not even win easily.</p><p>If this were to spread, his reputation would definitely be greatly reduced.</p><p>He couldn’t bear this.</p><p>Therefore, he decided that he would not only stop Lu Ming today, but he would also take his life.</p><p>He could only redeem his reputation by killing Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Qin Qingshan roared, his aura growing stronger.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>However, at this moment, the regional teleportation formation’s altar not far away emitted a bright light. Countless rays of light gathered in the air and formed a huge vortex.</p><p>A figure suddenly appeared on the altar.</p><p>This man looked to be in his thirties. His long hair was loose, and he was wearing a gray robe. A large wine gourd hung from his waist.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>When this man appeared, the vortex in the sky didn’t disappear. Instead, it shook violently and let out a violent rumble.</p><p>“Nest, didn’t I just eat one of your eggs? Is there a need to chase after me?”</p><p>The man muttered.</p><p>But the next moment, a violent roar came from the vortex. A claw covered in scales reached out from the vortex and grabbed at the man.</p><p>The man’s figure flashed and he flew down the altar.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The claw slammed onto the altar. The altar rumbled and then exploded, sending gravel flying everywhere.</p><p>As soon as the altar shattered, the vortex shrank rapidly.</p><p>An unwilling roar came from the vortex, and the claw covered in scales also retracted and disappeared.</p><p>Aiya, the inter-province transportation formation is destroyed. It seems like I have to travel by myself. I thought I could be lazy.</p><p>The muscular man muttered as he picked up the wine gourd at his waist and took a few gulps.</p><p>At the scene, everyone was staring at this man in shock.</p><p>Who was this man? Why did he suddenly appear? more importantly, the inter-province transportation formation was destroyed because of him.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils enlarged rapidly. He could not accept it.</p><p>The inter-domain teleportation formation was destroyed. How was he going to return?</p><p>Half a year’s time was up.</p><p>someone destroyed the inter-province transportation formation. Attack and capture this person!</p><p>Qin qingfei’s eighth uncle suddenly reacted and let out a hysterical roar.</p><p>He was in charge of the inter-province transportation formation. Now that it was destroyed in front of him, he couldn’t escape punishment.</p><p>The hundreds of soldiers at the scene moved and surrounded the man. Hundreds of powerful auras converged and it was terrifying.</p><p>The weakest of these hundreds of people was at Lv 6 martial King realm, and more than 50 of them were King tiers of the upper tier. Even a peak King tier would have to retreat in fear when faced with such a force.</p><p>However, the muscular man did not seem to see it. He picked up the wine gourd and began to drink again.</p><p>“Speak, Who are you? Why did they destroy the inter-domain teleportation formation of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace? Tell me the truth, and I’ll leave you with an intact corpse!”</p><p>Qin qingfei’s eighth uncle berated.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
