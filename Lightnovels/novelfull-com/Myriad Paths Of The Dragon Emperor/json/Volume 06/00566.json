I’ll kill you first.”</p><p>A corpse guard coldly shouted.</p><p>Then, a refined corpse pounced on Lu Ming.</p><p>&Nbsp; Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Seven to eight iron chains swept toward Lu Ming like venomous snakes.</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear swept out and collided with the iron chain. His body was sent flying backward.</p><p>this won’t do. Although these two corpse guards are both at Lv 7 martial King realm, they’re still King tiers in the upper tier. I’m not their match yet. I can only retreat first!</p><p>No matter how unwilling he was, the fat meat in his mouth was about to disappear. He had no choice, his strength was inferior to others.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and cast the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps. In a few flashes, he was far away.</p><p>The two corpse guards were somewhat dazed, unable to catch up at all.</p><p>“This kid is quite fast.”</p><p>A corpse guard was somewhat unwilling.</p><p>forget it, let’s not care about him. Let’s dig up the intent crystals first. This place is truly a peerless treasure ground. I’ve never heard of a place like this before. If we can bring these intent crystals out this time, we’ll be rich.</p><p>The other corpse Guard’s eyes lit up. He immediately controlled the refined corpse and began to dig.</p><p>Lu Ming flew for thousands of miles and stopped at a hidden place.</p><p>looks like I’ll have to increase my strength first. Otherwise, I won’t be a match for these late stage King tiers.</p><p>only by increasing our strength can we obtain more resources. Sky corpse sect, Thunder Palace Master, just you wait.</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming entered the Supreme shrine.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, a pile of wind attribute intent crystals appeared on the side.</p><p>Now, as long as the wind attribute esoteric crystal was upgraded to level one lower tier, Lu Ming’s cultivation could continue to increase rapidly.</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out his hand and a middle-grade wind-type esoteric crystal appeared in his hand.</p><p>Lu Ming had to start with middle-grade profound meaning crystals.</p><p>Placing the path-understanding ancient tree by his side, Lu Ming entered a state of emptiness. Then, he clenched the intent crystal.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The wind-element middle-grade profound meaning crystal shattered. Strands of extremely strong intent realm emerged and surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming closed his eyes and started to comprehend.</p><p>The effects of middle-grade intent crystals were astonishing.</p><p>Two days later, Lu Ming had broken through the wind concept to level one lower tier.</p><p>However, the effects of the esoteric crystals were still there. Lu Ming continued to cultivate.</p><p>In a flash, three days had passed. His wind mentality had reached the middle stage of level one lower tier. The effect of the mid-tier profound meaning silk thread finally disappeared.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took out low-grade profound meaning crystals and continued to comprehend.</p><p>The effect of comprehending in the Supreme shrine was slightly worse than in Tianxuan city. After half a month, he had used up all three hundred wind-type profound meaning crystals. His wind concept had just broken through to the peak of level one lower tier.</p><p>It was only one step away from level one upper class, which was equivalent to the concept of fire.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Lu Ming opened his eyes and let out a breath of turbid air.</p><p>now, my Wind and Fire mentality is only one step away from level one upper tier, and my Thunder mentality has reached the late stage of level one lower tier. It won’t affect my cultivation anymore. I’ll start to improve my cultivation!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, 50000 top-grade spirit crystals appeared and exploded. The bloodline of the nine Dragons devoured them and refined them into vital essence.</p><p>The three concepts were almost at an equilibrium. Indeed, there was no more resistance. Lu Ming’s cultivation level began to increase rapidly.</p><p>However, after reaching the LV 4 martial King realm, the amount of spiritual crystals required to improve one’s cultivation was terrifying. From the early stage of the LV 4 martial King realm to the middle stage, it had taken 200000 spiritual crystals, which was a terrifying amount.</p><p>A small level would cost 200000.</p><p>After refining 600000 pieces of top-grade spirit crystals, Lu Ming’s cultivation had broken through to the peak of the fourth level Dao martial King realm.</p><p>Then, he refined another 500000 pieces of top-grade spiritual crystals. Lu Ming’s cultivation had broken through to the early stage of the fifth level martial King realm.</p><p>After refining 1.1 million pieces of top-grade spirit crystals, Lu Ming’s cultivation level had only increased by one level.</p><p>If it were anyone else, they would not be able to afford it.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s expression was calm. He continued to take out top-grade spirit crystals and began to devour and refine them.</p><p>The fifth level of the martial King realm required even more top-grade spirit crystals. Lu Ming had refined 900000 of them before he reached the peak of the fifth level of the martial King realm. Then, he refined 80 more and broke through to the early stage of the sixth level of the martial King realm.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not stop there. He refined another 1.5 million pieces of top-grade spirit crystals and cultivated to the peak of the sixth level martial King realm. He had reached his limit here because he could not break through the realm of heaven and earth, so it was impossible for his cultivation to break through.</p><p>In total, he had refined 4.3 million Supreme spiritual crystals in seven days.</p><p>If others knew about this, they would be scared to death. He had refined 4.3 million Supreme spiritual crystals in seven days and his cultivation had broken through several levels. He was not human.</p><p>Of course, this was also thanks to the nine Dragon bloodline’s advancement to the seventh level of the king tier, which greatly enhanced the power of devouring and refining. If it were in the past, it would not have been possible.</p><p>a peak Lv 6 martial King realm. His genuine Yuan is too strong.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that the moment he opened his mouth, all he spurted out was essential core.</p><p>“How strong is my current combat power?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes glimmered.</p><p>When the three kinds of intent realms of heaven and earth reached the first level small success, the power of the three kinds of fusion was definitely comparable to the completion of the first level of a single intent realm.</p><p>In addition, his cultivation was now at the peak of the sixth level of the martial King realm. Lu Ming did not know how strong he was.</p><p>In any case, killing a Lv 7 King realm warrior would be a piece of cake.</p><p>‘I might as well cultivate the three absolutes of the Dragon God once more and raise my strength to the limit before going out.’</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>In this place, Lu Ming had a huge advantage. He could quickly turn the intent crystals into strength.</p><p>For the others, no matter how many esoteric crystals they had, they could not use them as quickly as Lu Ming. Moreover, even if their concepts had improved, their cultivation would not improve as quickly as Lu Ming because their speed of refining crystals was far slower than his.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming was not afraid that other people’s cultivation would also increase rapidly.</p><p>Lu Ming planned to raise his combat strength to the maximum and then go out to excavate the profound meaning crystals. He would kill the people of the heavenly corpse sect and take their profound meaning crystals.</p><p>Under the path-understanding ancient tree, the speed of comprehending martial techniques was also ten times faster than normal.</p><p>In just half a month’s time, Lu Ming had cultivated the Dragon God’s three absolutes to the fourth stage.</p><p>Lu Ming’s ability had increased by another level.</p><p>“Let’s go. It’s time to reap the rewards!”</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming left the Supreme shrine and turned into a ray of light, disappearing in a flash.</p><p>Lu Ming did not control his speed at all. He flew wildly in the sky.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, he had traveled more than a hundred thousand miles. Along the way, Lu Ming saw five to six esoteric crystal veins that had been mined.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop in this area. He flew further away.</p><p>Five hours later, Lu Ming finally met a figure.</p><p>hurry up, hurry up! We’ll finish excavating this intent crystal vein and go look for the next one!</p><p>Not far ahead, a shout came out.</p><p>There were around thirty corpse guards controlling the refined corpses and excavating a power Upanishad crystal vein.</p><p>This time, the heavenly corpse sect had sent in a lot of people. There were nearly a thousand of them, and thirty of them was only a small portion.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming appeared in the sky above the esoteric crystal mine with a cold smile on his face.</p><p>What a coincidence. The leaders of this group of corpse guards were the two seventh level martial King realm corpse guards that Lu Ming had encountered earlier.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
