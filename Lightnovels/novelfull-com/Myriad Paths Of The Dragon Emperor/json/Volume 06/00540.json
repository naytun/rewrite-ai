Bang!</p><p>...</p><p>The heroes of the Sheng family were all sent flying backward like sandbags.</p><p>With Lu Ming at the center, the heroes of the Sheng family were thrown backward and then glided along the fighting ring at a high speed. They glided for several miles before they stopped, blood spurting from their mouths.</p><p>All of them were Lv 4 martial King realm martial artists, and they could not even withstand a single blow from Lu Ming.</p><p>The LV 5 martial King realm martial artists were also sent flying. They slid backward, but they did not fall to the ground. They could still stand firmly, but blood was flowing out of their mouths.</p><p>Only the LV 6 martial King realm martial artist was able to block the attack, but he was also forced to take dozens of steps back.</p><p>Even Sheng Chong and Sheng lang were forced to take seven or eight steps back.</p><p>The encirclement of the Sheng family’s heroes was shattered by Lu Ming’s attack.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Below the stage, countless people saw this scene and completely lost control of their emotions. Their auras exploded out, and their eyes widened as they roared.</p><p>three types of concepts of heaven and earth! Lu Ming has comprehended three types of concepts of heaven and earth!</p><p>three kinds of heaven and earth will, all condensed into will runes, and two of them have been cultivated to the initial level one realm. How did he do it? ”</p><p>impossible. Cultivating so many intents will create resistance between each other. How did he do it? how did it happen? ”</p><p>he’s too strong. The people from the Sheng family were no match for him at all. They were defeated in one move!</p><p>he didn’t even use his full strength just now. Otherwise, he would have killed Sheng Chuan and Sheng Fei in one move.</p><p>so, he wasn’t being arrogant. He had the ability to do so.</p><p>“I understand now, those soul sealing Jade plates, how did he get them by plotting against others, this was completely obtained by him killing the corpse guards. He completely has this strength!”</p><p>Many people around them were shouting. They couldn’t control their excitement. They didn’t even care if their words would offend the Sheng family.</p><p>It was too shocking.</p><p>“Why is it like this?”</p><p>Sacred glory’s old eyes almost popped out of their sockets. The aura from his body spread uncontrollably, and many people around him retreated in shock.</p><p>However, he did not feel anything at all. His eyes were fixed on Lu Ming, full of disbelief.</p><p>“Three … Three kinds of heaven and earth intent realms, all … He had cultivated intent runes and two types of level one lower tier. Why? Why?”</p><p>Sheng Wushuang seemed to have lost his soul. He stared at Lu Ming and kept muttering.</p><p>He found it hard to accept all this.</p><p>In the past, he had mocked Lu Ming for cultivating multiple concepts at the same time and that he would never achieve anything.</p><p>However, he had not condensed an intent rune when he cultivated one intent. Lu Ming, on the other hand, cultivated three intents and had condensed intent runes. Two of them had even reached level one lower tier.</p><p>Compared to Lu Ming, he was simply trash. No, he could not even be compared to trash. He was like dung.</p><p>In this instant, his heart of martial arts collapsed. The aura on his body fluctuated, and his eyes were listless.</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming had dealt him a series of blows.</p><p>Now, just a moment ago, this blow had finally reached its peak and shattered his heart of martial arts.</p><p>Once the heart of martial arts was broken, it would be difficult for him to advance further in martial arts. In other words, Sheng Wushuang would never be able to break through to the martial King realm.</p><p>It was ridiculous. Back then, he said that Lu Ming would never be able to break through to the martial King realm. Now, he was the one who had to accept the truth.</p><p>“You’re really trash!”</p><p>On the side, Sheng Yao noticed Sheng Wushuang’s condition and shouted coldly.</p><p>In the fighting ring, Sheng Chong, Sheng lang, and the others were also shocked.</p><p>One move. Lu Ming had only used one move, but the power contained in that move was too terrifying. It far exceeded the peak of the sixth level martial King realm.</p><p>“You want to cripple me with just this bit of strength?”</p><p>Lu Ming held the long spear in his hand, his long hair flying in the wind, his aura wild.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re quite capable indeed. How about this, let’s call this a draw?”</p><p>Sheng Chong looked at Lu Ming and shouted with a hint of fear in his eyes.</p><p>The Sheng family was completely doomed in this battle. However, if it ended in a draw, it would be better for the Sheng family’s reputation.</p><p>In the surroundings, some people revealed looks of disdain.</p><p>It was obvious that Sheng Chong was afraid.</p><p>“A draw? Haha, do you think you have the right to fight me to a draw?”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed and walked towards Sheng Chong, Sheng lang, and the rest with his spear in hand.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t refuse a toast only to be forced to drink a forfeit!”</p><p>Sheng Chong roared and retreated.</p><p>“Nonsense, either admit defeat or fight!”</p><p>Lu Ming berated.</p><p>“Lu Ming, that’s enough!”</p><p>die! holy light shouted coldly, his eyes cold.</p><p>“Old man, is it your turn to interject on the divine Guard battle platform?”</p><p>Lu Ming did not even turn his head and scolded him directly.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Sheng Yao was a peak King and an elder of the Emperor sky divine Palace. When had he ever been scolded by a junior like this? he was so angry that he almost vomited blood.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop and walked toward Sheng Chong and the rest.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it, let’s attack together!”</p><p>Sheng Chong bellowed. He knew that he could not avoid this battle.</p><p>There was only one battle.</p><p>If they didn’t even dare to fight and admitted defeat, they would definitely not become a laughingstock. They would also be punished by the Sheng family.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Sheng Chong, Sheng lang, and the others roared and unleashed their full power.</p><p>A green divine bird flew above Sheng Chong’s head. The will of wind spread out, and a Gale swept out.</p><p>On top of the sacred wolf’s head was a giant wolf. On the giant Wolf’s body, raging flames soared into the sky, and the concept of fire covered the sky.</p><p>There were also a few other Lv 6 and Lv 5 martial King realm experts. In total, there were ten of them.</p><p>Kill! Kill! Kill!</p><p>The ten attacks were aimed at Lu Ming from different angles.</p><p>“Ten thousand Dragon kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming thrust his spear forward and dozens of three-colored true dragons flew out, pouncing on the ten Sheng family heroes.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he took a step forward and rushed towards Sheng Chong and Sheng lang.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The huge spear radiance, thicker than a water tank, was blasted toward the two of them.</p><p>The two of them were shocked and tried to block it with their ultimate moves, but it was useless. They were hit by the huge spear radiance and were sent flying backward with blood spurting out of their mouths.</p><p>He flew out several miles before he finally stabilized his body.</p><p>Below the fighting ring, countless people looked at Lu Ming’s figure on the fighting ring in shock.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming was like an invincible God of War. He was undefeatable.</p><p>“A peerless genius!”</p><p>There was only one thought in everyone’s mind.</p><p>perhaps, in another three to five years, Lu Ming will be on the list of top 1000 talents!</p><p>I think so too. As long as Lu Ming maintains this momentum, he’ll be on the list of top 1000 talents in three years or five years at most.</p><p>in that case, we’ll have two geniuses on the list of top 1000 talents in the Tianxuan region.</p><p>Below the stage, some people were discussing in low voices.</p><p>“All of you, just admit defeat!”</p><p>Lu Ming stared at Sheng Chong and Sheng lang.</p><p>“You want us to admit defeat? impossible! Lu Ming, unless you throw us out of the divine guards ‘fighting ring, don’t even think about us admitting defeat!”</p><p>The sacred Wolf shouted.</p><p>“At least you have some backbone. I’ll fulfill your wish then!”</p><p>Lu Ming strode forward.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
