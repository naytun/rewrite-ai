He did not expect the news to spread so quickly.</p><p>...</p><p>The secret Chamber of Commerce’s speed was truly fast.</p><p>In fact, it wasn’t difficult to understand why the secret Chamber of Commerce would do this.</p><p>This way, he could attract even more people who needed gold-attribute intent crystals to bid for them. When the time came, the price would rise even higher, and the secret Chamber of Commerce would naturally earn more.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. This was a good thing for him.</p><p>After having his fill, Lu Ming walked out of the restaurant and returned to the inn.</p><p>There were still six days left, just enough time to cultivate.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming’s cultivation had reached the peak of Lv 9 martial King realm, it would be impossible for him to break through in a short period of time.</p><p>As for his martial technique, the Dragon God’s three absolutes, he had already cultivated it to the fifth level.</p><p>As for the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps, although he had made rapid progress recently, he still needed some time to cultivate the fourth step.</p><p>The fourth step of the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps was equivalent to the sixth level of a heaven grade upper level martial technique, and it was extremely powerful.</p><p>“Now, I can only improve my physical body.”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>As long as Lu Ming’s physical body broke through to the seventh stage, his combat strength would increase by another level.</p><p>A seventh-grade body was ten times stronger than a sixth-grade body.</p><p>There was a huge gap between the sixth-grade body and the seventh-grade body.</p><p>Lu Ming took out a stalk of common knotgrass.</p><p>The common knotgrass was originally an Ordinary Level 1 spiritual herb. However, after growing on xuanhuang silicotic soil for countless years, it had turned into the highest level 6 spiritual herb. The medicinal essence it contained was extremely rich.</p><p>Lu Ming cast the ten thousand spiritual combat body. He slowly transformed the seven-section herb into the Qi of ten thousand spirits and began to cultivate his physical body.</p><p>A top rank level 6 spiritual herb was very useful for sea of soul realm experts. The essence of the herb was too rich.</p><p>The seething medicinal essence continuously transformed into wisps of Qi of myriad spirits and seeped into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Lu Ming’s muscles, bones, internal organs, and veins were all improving rapidly, approaching a new level.</p><p>A day had passed. Lu Ming refined a stalk of common knotgrass. He took out another one and continued refining.</p><p>Day after day. In the blink of an eye, five days had passed. Lu Ming had refined all the five-story seven-section grass.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s body was shrouded in a dense layer of mist. A strong medicinal fragrance emanated from Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Crackling …</p><p>The sound of beans being fried came from Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>A gray mist was discharged from his body. It was the impurities in his body.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was covered with a layer of treasure light. It looked like a Supreme treasure.</p><p>After five days of cultivation and refining five stalks of common knotgrass, Lu Ming’s physical body had finally broken through to rank-7. His physical strength had increased tenfold.</p><p>Kachaa! Kachaa!</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming’s body emitted a sound. Then, Lu Ming’s body grew taller and his muscles swelled up.</p><p>In a few breaths, Lu Ming had transformed into a burly young man who was two meters tall.</p><p>This was the mystery of a rank-7 body. When one’s body reached rank-7, they could change the density of their muscles, bones, size, and body shape at will.</p><p>There was another explosion and Lu Ming changed back.</p><p>He took out a level-five spirit sword and slashed his arm. Lu Ming felt as if he was cutting leather. He could not cut in at all.</p><p>The level-five spiritual sword was extremely sharp, but it could not even cut Lu Ming’s skin.</p><p>One could see how strong Lu Ming’s physical defense was.</p><p>Most sea of soul realm experts couldn’t even reach the seventh stage body.</p><p>He injected his Zhen Yuan and made a cut on his arm. But before the blood could flow out, the muscles on the wound started to wriggle rapidly. In a few breaths, the wound healed, leaving a scar. The scar was also disappearing quickly. He believed that in a few hours, the scar would be completely gone.</p><p>a rank-7 body is indeed powerful. This way, my combat strength has increased by at least 20%!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>Don’t look down on 20%. Lu Ming’s combat strength was the combination of vital essence, intent, martial arts techniques, and many other aspects. Moreover, Lu Ming’s combat strength was already extremely shocking. It was already terrifying to have it increased by 20% all of a sudden.</p><p>This was also because of the magic of the ten thousand spiritual combat body. Even if other people had the highest grade Lv 6 spiritual herbs, it would be useless.</p><p>there’s still some medicinal power left in my body. There’s still one day before the auction starts, so I can refine it!</p><p>Lu Ming immediately activated his ten thousand spirit combat body and continued to refine the medicinal effects.</p><p>A day passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The next day, Lu Ming received a message. Feixue had arrived and was waiting for him downstairs.</p><p>“Lady flying snow!”</p><p>Lu Ming came downstairs and smiled.</p><p>“Brother Lu!”</p><p>Fei Xue also smiled.</p><p>She looked at Lu Ming in surprise. After not seeing him for a few days, she could feel that there were some changes in Lu Ming, but she could not put her finger on what exactly had changed.</p><p>Lady flying snow, you are also going to the auction? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>the secret Chamber of Commerce only holds an auction once every six months. I heard that there’s a rare treasure up for auction this time. Of course, I’m going to see it.</p><p>also, this time, there’ll be a stack of two thousand gold element intent crystals being auctioned. I have an elder who also cultivates the gold intent realm, and it’ll be his birthday soon. I want to buy it and give it to him as a gift.</p><p>Fei Xue laughed.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“I really don’t know who has two thousand gold attribute power Upanishad crystals. Moreover, it’s rare to see all of them being put up for auction. I guess the competition this time will be very fierce. I don’t know if I can get it or not.”</p><p>Fei Xue sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and touched his nose.</p><p>The two of them walked towards the heavenly secret auction. It didn’t take long before they arrived.</p><p>miss feixue, you’re here too. Please follow me to the VIP room!</p><p>As soon as Fei Xue arrived, a beautiful young lady welcomed her with a smile. She brought Lu Ming and Fei Xue to a vip room.</p><p>Like most auction venues, the first floor of the auction venue was a huge Hall. Above the hall was a high platform for the host of the auction.</p><p>On the second floor, there were many VIP rooms that surrounded the entire Hall. The view was excellent, and one could see the scene below.</p><p>Lu Ming and Fei Xue went to vip Room No. 10.</p><p>Lu Ming opened the window and looked out. At this moment, there were already many people in the hall. The number of people was increasing.</p><p>In guest room number five, Qin qingfei and a middle-aged man were sitting inside.</p><p>“This time, I’ll definitely get two thousand gold intent crystals.”</p><p>Qin qingfei’s eyes were burning with passion.</p><p>What he cultivated was the metal intent, and he had also reached a bottleneck. If he could get two thousand metal intent crystals, he would definitely be able to break through this bottleneck, and his metal intent would also advance by leaps and bounds.</p><p>second young master, metal intent crystals might be precious, but our goal this time is that treasure.</p><p>The middle-aged man reminded.</p><p>don’t worry. This time, my father has given me a large number of Supreme spiritual crystals. I’ll definitely be able to get that treasure.</p><p>Qin qingfei said with confidence.</p><p>Thereafter, he got up and opened the window. He immediately saw Lu Ming opposite him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
