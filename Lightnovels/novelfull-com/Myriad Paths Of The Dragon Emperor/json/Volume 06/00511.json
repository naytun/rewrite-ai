Retreat!”</p><p>Some of the spectators with weaker cultivation bases were so scared that they retreated.</p><p>When the energy hit the ground, inscriptions flashed on the ground, but not a single mark was left.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Shengjiang roared, his aura growing stronger. The power of The Blue Sword light grew stronger.</p><p>The three-colored true dragon only managed to resist for a moment before it was split into two by the sword radiance. The sword radiance did not stop and continued to slash toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming held the long spear horizontally in front of him.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The sword-light struck the Spear’s shaft.</p><p>Lu Ming felt a huge surge of energy surging towards him. His body trembled and he flew backward.</p><p>After flying for more than a hundred meters, Lu Ming’s feet finally landed on the ground. Then, he took seven steps back in a row. Every step he took caused the ground to rumble.</p><p>lower tier King tiers are indeed powerful! Lu Ming felt the blood in his body churning and he almost spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>The difference between Lv 3 and Lv 4 martial King realm was huge. It was not just one level, but two.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current cultivation was at the peak of the second level of the martial King realm. With his combat strength, it would not be difficult for him to kill a peak of the third level of the martial King realm. However, there was still a certain gap between him and a King of the lower tier of the fourth level.</p><p>This wasn’t something that could be made up for just by relying on one intent realm.</p><p>However, he didn’t know that Shengjiang was even more shocked. At the same time, a violent killing intent spread out.</p><p>Lu Ming was only at the peak of the second level of the martial King realm, but he had managed to block his attacks time and time again. This was simply unbelievable, and it made him feel embarrassed.</p><p>This was the first time he had been repeatedly blocked by a low-tier King tier.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>die! Shengjiang roared, a sharp killing intent erupting from his body. His aura exploded as he slashed his sword at Lu Ming.</p><p>This sword strike had huge waves roaring between heaven and earth. It combined with the sword momentum of the holy river, making the attack of the holy river reach its peak.</p><p>This sword was much stronger than the previous one.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A faint Dragon’s Roar could be heard from within Lu Ming’s body. He circulated his essential core to the maximum and at the same time, the power of his blood vessels fused with his body.</p><p>He also used his full strength.</p><p>Even if he couldn’t win, he would fight to the end.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>At this moment, a loud shout could be heard as a white figure rapidly approached.</p><p>Before he even arrived, a bright sword light had already slashed toward the sacred river.</p><p>Its power was shocking.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Shengjiang’s expression changed. He had no choice but to change the direction of his sword and attack the sword light.</p><p>The two sword lights collided with a loud bang. The sword Qi was overflowing. Shengjiang’s figure could not help but sway and take two steps back.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A figure appeared in the field.</p><p>He was dressed in a snow-white robe, snow-white pants, and snow-white boots. He was as pure as Jade.</p><p>“It’s him?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. He recognized him. Wasn’t this person mu xiuyuan?</p><p>He had once kindly reminded Lu Ming.</p><p>When did he come to the central section of the Tianxuan sub-Palace?</p><p>Lu Ming had some doubts.</p><p>“Mu xiuyuan, it’s you?”</p><p>When Shengjiang saw mu xiuyuan, his eyes narrowed and he asked in surprise.</p><p>Shengjiang, long time no see. How can you improve if you don’t see your abilities? ”</p><p>Mu xiuyuan smiled slightly.</p><p>“Hmph, mu Xiu Yuan, didn’t you go to the East to train? When did he come back? And why did you stop me?”</p><p>Shengjiang asked coldly.</p><p>“It’s none of your business when I want to come back. Also, Lu Ming is my friend. Of course, I have to help!”</p><p>Mu xiuyuan said.</p><p>“This kid is your friend? So, you’re going to interfere today?”</p><p>Shengjiang said with a gloomy expression.</p><p>He was quite afraid of mu xiuyuan.</p><p>The other party’s cultivation was higher than his, and he was a genius disciple of the MU family.</p><p>In the Tianxuan region, the MU family’s strength was something that even the Sheng family was wary of.</p><p>The MU clan would not give the Sheng clan any face.</p><p>“That’s right, since I’m here today, you can’t touch a single hair on his head. If you want to make a move, you can try, but don’t blame me for being impolite!”</p><p>Mu xiuyuan said with a smile.</p><p>“Good, good, very good. Mu xiuyuan, you can protect him for now, but can you protect him forever? There’s plenty of time later on, let’s wait and see!”</p><p>Shengjiang laughed in anger, then turned around and left.</p><p>Sheng Kong, Sheng Feng, and the others hurriedly followed him into the city and disappeared without a trace.</p><p>“This brat actually knows mu xiuyuan. He’s really lucky to have dodged a calamity!”</p><p>if I’m lucky, I can only avoid it once. It’s not easy to avoid offending the Sheng family. Based on my understanding of the Sheng family, they won’t let it go so easily.</p><p>that’s right. I wonder what will happen to this kid in the end? ”</p><p>In the surroundings, some people were discussing animatedly as they slowly dispersed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you alright?”</p><p>At this moment, mu xiuyuan looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Brother mu, thank you for saving me!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>haha, you’re welcome. Since you’re LAN ‘er’s friend, you’re my friend as well. It’s just a small matter. There’s no need to thank me.</p><p>Mu xiuyuan laughed heartily, very forthright.</p><p>“Little girl LAN ‘er?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>“Oh? Lu Ming, it seems that you still don’t know? I’m mu Lan’s cousin. Mu Lan once told me to take care of you. I’m ashamed to say that I haven’t been of much help to you!”</p><p>Mu xiuyuan said with a smile.</p><p>Lu Ming came to a sudden realization. Mu xiuyuan was Mu Lan’s cousin. No wonder he had been kind to Lu Ming from the beginning.</p><p>“May I know where Senior Sister Mu Lan is? I haven’t even seen Senior Sister Mu Lan since I joined the Ditian divine guards.”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had to seize the opportunity to ask.</p><p>Yan LAN had once told him that Mu Lan’s father was an important figure in the Emperor heaven divine Palace. However, Lu Ming had not seen Mu Lan even after joining the Emperor heaven divine Palace for so long.</p><p>Logically speaking, Mu Lan should’ve taken the initiative to look for him when she found out that he had joined the Ditian divine guards.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s not easy to see Mu Lan!”</p><p>Mu Xiu Yuan sighed.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked hurriedly.</p><p>Lu Ming, it seems that there are many things that you don’t know yet. Now, I’ll explain it to you. First of all, Mu Lan’s father is the current family head of the MU family and the current Palace Master of the Tianxuan sub-Palace!</p><p>Mu xiuyuan threw out a heavy piece of news.</p><p>“What? Senior Sister Mu Lan’s father is the palace Master of the profound sky sub-Palace?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked and extremely surprised.</p><p>Yan LAN had said that Mu Lan’s father was an important figure in the Emperor heaven divine Palace. He didn’t expect him to be the number one figure in the Tianxuan region’s sub-Palace, the palace Master of the Tianxuan sub-Palace.</p><p>This was indeed beyond Lu Ming’s expectations.</p><p>Then, mu xiuyuan began to talk about it in detail.</p><p>Although the MU family was known as one of the two major families in the Tianxuan region, it had only risen to power a hundred years ago. Its Foundation was still incomparable to the Sheng family. If the MU family wanted to continue to be strong and continue to be strong, they would have to rely on the strength of the Sheng family.</p><p>How could he borrow it?</p><p>A marriage alliance was the best way.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
