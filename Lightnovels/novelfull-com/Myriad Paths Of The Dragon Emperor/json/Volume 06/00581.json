Lu Ming was very curious.</p><p>...</p><p>yes, I fainted after I was sucked into the door. When I woke up, I was here with brother Xuan Feng.</p><p>Xuan Xiang said.</p><p>Xuan Xiang seemed to have noticed the curiosity in Lu Ming’s eyes and explained, the patriarch said that brother Xuan Feng and I have the thickest bloodline and have inherited the most of the patriarch’s bloodline. So, the patriarch saved us and taught us cultivation.</p><p>Lu Ming had a sudden realization. So that was the case.</p><p>“Oh right, Lord Lu Ming, how’s my father?”</p><p>Xuan Xiang suddenly asked, looking at Lu Ming with hope.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart. As expected, Xuan Xiang still asked. For a moment, Lu Ming did not know how to phrase his words.</p><p>After a moment of silence, he decided to speak frankly.</p><p>“Grandmaster Xuan has fallen.”</p><p>Then, the storage ring that Xuan long gave him before he died appeared in his hand. He said, ” “Grandmaster Xuan asked me to pass this to you before she died.”</p><p>“Father!”</p><p>Xuan Xiang let out a sad cry as tears flowed down her face.</p><p>When she was taken away and saw Xuan long being severely injured, she was already prepared. However, after she confirmed it, she was still very sad and couldn’t stop crying.</p><p>Lu Ming did not know what to say and could only stand at the side stupidly.</p><p>“The heavenly corpse sect, they really deserve to die!”</p><p>let’s go! Xuan Feng walked over, clenched his fists, and roared.</p><p>After a while, Xuan Xiang stopped crying and said, ” big brother Xuan Feng is right. One day, I will flatten the sky corpse sect.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Xuan Xiang and Xuan Feng.</p><p>The heavenly corpse sect was so huge that it could compete with the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. It was easier said than done to flatten it.</p><p>However, with the middle-aged man’s guidance, it might be possible for Xuan Feng and Xuan Xiang.</p><p>Lu Ming, Xuan Xiang, and Xuan Feng started chatting immediately.</p><p>Xuan Xiang and Xuan Feng had learned from the middle-aged man that this was the heaven realm, and their realm was called the primordial realm.</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to ask for more information, but Xuan Xiang and Xuan Feng shook their heads and did not know. The middle-aged man did not tell them more.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a day had passed.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>On the second day, the altar suddenly shone with an extremely dazzling light.</p><p>alright, the teleportation array has been preliminarily fixed. It should be enough to teleport the four of us back to the primordial realm.</p><p>however, inter-realm teleportation is extremely difficult. This teleportation formation was set up by the most powerful human beings in ancient times. It was destroyed after a Great War. Although it has been repaired, it can only be used once. After that, it will self-destruct.</p><p>also, even if we teleport to the primordial realm, the chances of returning to the Tianxuan region are very small. We will most likely be teleported to other places. Moreover, due to the instability, we will most likely be separated!</p><p>The middle-aged man explained.</p><p>“What? I can’t return to the Tianxuan region!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>There were still about ten days before Mu Lan and the sacred constellation’s wedding. If they were to be teleported to another large region, how would they be able to make it back?</p><p>Although there was an inter-province transportation formation in every region, they might not be able to get there in time.</p><p>“Lord Lu Ming, are you rushing back to the Tianxuan region?”</p><p>Xuan Xiang asked.</p><p>“That’s right, I do have something important to do!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>alright, I’ll try my best to adjust the direction, but as for where we’ll be teleported to, that’ll depend on luck. Let’s go up the altar together!</p><p>The middle-aged man said.</p><p>Everyone ascended the altar together.</p><p>The middle-aged man exuded a wondrous aura that gushed into the altar.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The altar trembled violently and gave off a bright light. Then, a vortex appeared above everyone’s head.</p><p>At the next moment, a powerful force acted on Lu Ming’s body. Lu Ming’s vision turned black and he felt as if he had entered an endless darkness.</p><p>After Lu Ming and the rest were teleported away, the altar exploded with a bang and turned into dust.</p><p>……</p><p>The Hong domain was located in the West of the Tianxuan region, separated from the Tianxuan region by sixteen large domains.</p><p>The great domain was extremely vast, seven or eight times the size of the Tianxuan region. It was filled with geniuses and experts, at least ten times stronger than the Tianxuan region.</p><p>Among the hundreds of big regions in the East continent, it could be ranked above average.</p><p>The Hong domain was also a large domain under the jurisdiction of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace.</p><p>In a remote mountain in the great domain, there was an ancient site. At this moment, a dozen young men were exploring the site.</p><p>The dozen or so young men all looked to be in their twenties. Their cultivation levels were extremely high, and each of them was at least at the LV 6 martial King realm.</p><p>Five or six of them had even reached the late stages of the king tier.</p><p>The leader was a young man in a blue robe. He had a strong aura and was a level nine upper tier King.</p><p>At this moment, they were fighting a group of khaki-colored puppets.</p><p>quick, this is the relic left behind by the puppet sect, an ancient sect. Let’s get rid of these burly figures and open the last door. The treasures of the puppet sect must be behind the last door.</p><p>“We can’t let that b * tch flying snow get ahead of us!”</p><p>The blue-robed youth shouted.</p><p>In front of them, there was a cliff. On the cliff, there was a stone door. Their goal was behind the stone door.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>One by one, the yellow puppets were destroyed by them, turning into yellow stones.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>However, a large group of khaki-colored puppets rushed out from all directions.</p><p>“Dammit, go to hell!”</p><p>The blue-robed young man shouted coldly. His hand glowed, and a scroll appeared. He opened the scroll, and on it was a drawing of a combat sword.</p><p>After the blue-robed young man injected his vital essence, the scroll emitted a dazzling light. Endless sword Qi shot out from the scroll and attacked the puppets.</p><p>A large number of puppets were destroyed.</p><p>Lu Ming fell into the darkness. He did not know how long had passed when suddenly, a hazy light pierced into his eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming opened his eyes and was slightly stunned.</p><p>He found that he was in an underground cave. The walls of the underground cave were inlaid with luminous stones that gave off a hazy light.</p><p>There was an ancient stone platform under his feet, and there were inscriptions on it.</p><p>“Where is this? how did I teleport here?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind whirred and he started to look around.</p><p>The underground cave was empty. It seemed that no one had been here for a long time.</p><p>“There’s a stone door there!”</p><p>Lu Ming saw a stone door on one of the walls at a glance.</p><p>Lu Ming walked over and gave the stone door a hard push, but it did not budge.</p><p>“There should be a switch!”</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming started to search the area.</p><p>At this time, the blue-robed young man and the others had already defeated all the yellow puppets.</p><p>hurry up, open that stone door. We have to get there before that b * tch, flying snow!</p><p>The blue-robed youth called out.</p><p>After saying this, he rushed to the stone door and gave it a hard push, but it didn’t move at all.</p><p>“What’s going on? It can’t be opened. Let’s attack together and smash this stone door!”</p><p>The blue-robed youth called out.</p><p>Ka ka!</p><p>At that moment, the stone door moved and opened automatically.</p><p>What made the blue-robed young man dumbfounded was that a young man actually walked out of the stone door.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
