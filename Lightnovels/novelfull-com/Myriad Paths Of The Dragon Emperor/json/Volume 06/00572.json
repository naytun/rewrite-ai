Lu Ming’s cultivation technique is not to be underestimated. He used this inscription to increase his power by more than two times.</p><p>Dandan muttered.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming used the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps. With one step, he appeared in the sky above the Thunder Palace Master. He looked down and smashed his spear at the Thunder Palace Master.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Under Lu Ming’s violent essential core, the spear ray was as heavy as a mountain as it smashed towards the Thunder Palace Master.</p><p>The Thunder Palace Master let out a long roar and formed a Thunder giant. He held a Thunder sword and slashed upwards like a god descending to the mortal world.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s spear radiance was unstoppable. It exploded and the lightning giant collapsed. The violent power struck the Thunder Palace Master.</p><p>Thunder Palace Master fell to the ground like a meteorite, creating a huge pit that was hundreds of meters wide and dozens of meters deep.</p><p>The next moment, Thunder Palace Master rushed out of the huge pit.</p><p>At this moment, the Thunder Palace master’s hair was disheveled, his clothes were in tatters, and there was blood at the corner of his mouth. He looked extremely pathetic.</p><p>hahaha, old geezer Zheng, to think that you’d have such a day. Hahaha, after Yan kuangtu from a hundred years ago, the eastern Tianxuan region has given birth to another unparalleled genius.</p><p>The fire Palace Master laughed heartily. Then, the life force in his body slowly dissipated and disappeared.</p><p>The palace Master of fire left while laughing.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master roared angrily, then turned around and ran.</p><p>He knew that he could no longer kill Lu Ming. He could only escape.</p><p>“Want to run? kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming used the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps and chased after him. His long spear trembled and beams of spear radiance burst out.</p><p>Thunder Palace Master was helpless and could only turn around to block with all his might.</p><p>“Watch me!”</p><p>Dandan stomped her feet and jumped off Lu Ming’s shoulders. She grinned and shouted. Then, her four heads retracted into the turtle shell. The turtle shell spun continuously in the air and smashed toward the master of thunder Palace’s face.</p><p>The master of thunder Palace struck out countless bolts of lightning, but they were completely useless against the turtle shell. The turtle shell passed through the layers of lightning and smashed towards the master of thunder Palace’s face.</p><p>The Thunder Palace Master was already experienced. He quickly used one hand to defend and wanted to slap dandan away. However, dandan spun in the air and quickly dodged the palm of the Thunder Palace Master.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A turtle shell was imprinted on Thunder Palace master’s face.</p><p>The master of thunder Palace screamed and retreated. A clear tortoise shell mark appeared on his face, and blood was flowing.</p><p>“Gokudo path attack!”</p><p>Lu Ming seized the opportunity to cast a Gokudo path attack and pierced the Thunder Palace master’s heart with his spear.</p><p>Thunder Palace Master roared, his eyes filled with unwillingness.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>With a shake of the long spear, a violent energy burst forth, destroying Thunder Palace master’s heart and internal organs.</p><p>“I’m not willing!”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master roared and died.</p><p>“You brought this upon yourself, you can’t live!”</p><p>Hmph! Lu Ming snorted coldly. His nine Dragon bloodline emerged and devoured the blood essence of the lightning Palace Master. Then, he took off the lightning Palace master’s storage ring.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and came before the palace Master of fire.</p><p>The palace Master of fire had already breathed his last, but his face still carried a carefree smile.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. It was a pity that the dignified Hall Master of the eastern Palace had died at the hands of the hall Master of the Thunder Hall, who was also a Hall Master.</p><p>senior, rest in peace. I’ve already killed that old man, the Thunder Palace Master!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. He absorbed his essential core and kept the storage ring of the fire Palace Master.</p><p>Then, he dug a hole and buried the body of the palace Master of fire.</p><p>“Profound yellow soil!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze shifted to the mound.</p><p>“Hahaha, what do you think? I wasn’t wrong, right? there’s dark yellow Obsidian soil here, which is a great fortune for you. However, the seven knotgrass will belong to me. ”</p><p>Dandan’s two front claws were placed on the turtle shell, triumphantly, but her pair of black eyes were staring at the seven stalks of seven section grass.</p><p>“No, I can’t give you the seven-section grass!”</p><p>Lu Ming rejected her directly.</p><p>“What? Lu Ming, you ungrateful bastard. I was the one who guided you to find xuanhuang Silicon soil. Do you know how precious xuanhuang Silicon soil is? Ah? Also, it was me who helped you deal with the Thunder Palace Master just now. Don’t you know how to repay me? I was seriously injured back then and needed spiritual herbs to recover. Why are you so stingy?”</p><p>Dandan was furious. She pointed one of her turtle claws at Lu Ming and spat out a bunch of words.</p><p>“I’ll give you one,” Lu Ming was speechless.</p><p>“No, two!” Dandan shouted.</p><p>“Alright, deal!”</p><p>Lu Ming immediately agreed.</p><p>“….”</p><p>Dandan grinned, as if she had been tricked by Lu Ming.</p><p>Immediately after, Lu Ming dug up the seven Tufts of common knotgrass by their roots and gave two to dandan.</p><p>Dandan picked it up as if she was eating a radish, and she ate it with a crunching sound, looking like she was enjoying it.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He could not believe that dandan was a peerless expert.</p><p>Lu Ming then took out a huge alchemy furnace.</p><p>This alchemy furnace was found in the storage rings of the others. Lu Ming stored all the dark yellow soil into the alchemy furnace.</p><p>One thousand Jin. There was a total of one thousand Jin of profound yellow soil here, enough to fill a pill furnace.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. If so much dark yellow soil were to be released to the outside world, it would definitely cause a huge commotion. Countless inscription Masters would go crazy.</p><p>Lu Ming carefully planted the path-understanding ancient tree into the mystical yellow soil.</p><p>After planting them, Lu Ming waved his hand and a large pile of spiritual herbs and flowers appeared in the air.</p><p>These were all low-level spiritual herbs that he had obtained from others. Most of them were at level one, two, three, and four. To Lu Ming, they were not of much use.</p><p>Lu Ming pressed his palm down, and a majestic vital essence burst out. The spiritual herbs were instantly destroyed and shattered into pieces. Then, Lu Ming’s vital essence transformed into two giant hands, grabbing the spiritual herb powder and squeezing it. Drops of spiritual liquid appeared and dripped on the xuanhuang silicoid soil.</p><p>The profound yellow soil could turn such a spiritual liquid into one’s own energy and nourish the spiritual herbs and herbs planted on it.</p><p>After squeezing out a few thousand spiritual herbs of various levels, Lu Ming finally stopped and kept the dark yellow Earth into the Supreme shrine.</p><p>“Dandan, do you know where we are?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at dandan.</p><p>At this time, dandan had already finished off the two stalks of common knotgrass and was lying in the air, her two front paws covering her head, her legs crossed, with a leisurely expression.</p><p>I don’t know. Although the aura of this world is very familiar to me, I was too seriously injured back then and forgot!</p><p>Dandan said leisurely.</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips. He knew that this would be the result. This guy was too boastful and his words were not reliable.</p><p>Lu Ming moved his body and flew in the direction he had come from at top speed.</p><p>He continued to look for a way out.</p><p>“Wait for me!”</p><p>Dandan ran like crazy at an extremely fast speed. One man and one turtle disappeared into the horizon in the blink of an eye.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
