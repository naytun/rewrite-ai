Kill! Kill!</p><p>Both sides were already in a killing frenzy.</p><p>Energy burst out, iron chains crossed the sky, and blood Qi filled the air.</p><p>People were constantly killed and fell to the ground.</p><p>But overall, the Sheng family was at a complete disadvantage.</p><p>Soon, dozens of people were killed.</p><p>The Sheng family had a total of a hundred or so people, while the heavenly corpse sect only had fifty corpse guards. Each corpse guard had two to three refined corpses, so their total number was close to two hundred.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The sacred Eagle wore a pair of spirit weapon gloves, and its claw radiance was shocking. Its claws continuously slashed out as if it could tear everything apart.</p><p>However, the two refined corpses held him back tightly. Behind him, the corpse guard with the mole on its forehead kept launching sneak attacks.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The sacred Eagle’s eyes were red with killing intent. It howled to the sky and rushed over, ignoring the iron chains that were coming at him.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>A metal chain pierced through his shoulder.</p><p>The sacred Eagle screeched and took the opportunity to rush past the two refined corpses and rush toward the corpse guard with the mole between its eyebrows.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The sacred Eagle’s figure was as fast as lightning, and its claws pierced through the void, clawing at the corpse Guard’s heart.</p><p>A trace of shock flashed through the eyes of the corpse guard with the mole between his eyebrows. He madly slashed out with the saber in his hand, trying his best to block the sacred Eagle.</p><p>As long as he could block the sacred Eagle’s attack, the two refined corpses would be able to arrive.</p><p>However, the battle power of the corpse guard itself was not high to begin with, and how could it compare to a genius like sacred Eagle.</p><p>The corpse guard with the mole between his eyebrows tried his best, but he still couldn’t block it. With a pfft, blood splattered everywhere. One of his arms had been torn off by the sacred Eagle.</p><p>At this moment, the two refined corpses arrived.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill him!”</p><p>The corpse guard with a mole on its forehead roared.</p><p>The two corpse guards fearlessly charged towards the sacred Eagle.</p><p>Sacred Hawk’s shoulder had been pierced by the iron chain, so his strength had been weakened a little. He could only try his best to resist.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>At this time, a shocking scream was heard.</p><p>“Sheng Chong!”</p><p>The sacred Eagle roared.</p><p>This time, there were three people in the Sheng family who had reached Lv 6 martial King realm.</p><p>Sheng Ying, that tall young man, and Sheng Chong.</p><p>However, the heavenly corpse sect also had three Lv 6 martial King realm corpse guards and seven refined corpses.</p><p>At this moment, Sheng Chong was surrounded by three refined corpses of Lv 6 martial King realm. In the end, he was pierced by the chains and turned into a sieve.</p><p>With the fall of a Lv 6 martial King, the morale of the Sheng family was greatly reduced.</p><p>More and more people were killed.</p><p>In total, more than fifty people had died on the spot.</p><p>“Retreat, retreat!”</p><p>The sacred Eagle roared.</p><p>If this continued, the Sheng family would probably be completely annihilated.</p><p>“It’s not that easy to leave!”</p><p>The corpse guard with a mole on its forehead was furious.</p><p>The corpse guards continued to control the refined corpses and kill the members of the Sheng family. The remaining fifty or so people of the Sheng family gathered together and rushed in one direction.</p><p>The people of the Sheng family gathered together and wanted to retreat. Even the people of the heavenly corpse sect could not stop them.</p><p>After leaving behind a few more corpses from the Sheng family, he successfully broke out of the encirclement and ran into the distance.</p><p>“Scumbag of the heavenly corpse sect, I, Sacred Hawk, will remember this debt.”</p><p>The voice came and the person disappeared.</p><p>“Hmph, at least you guys escaped quickly.”</p><p>The corpse Guard’s eyes were filled with fire as he continued, hurry up and collect the corpses of the Sheng family. Bring them back and refine them into refined corpses. Also, hurry up and dig out the intent crystals in this mountain.</p><p>The mole-faced young man ordered loudly. When the Sheng family returned, they would definitely send reinforcements. They had to hurry up.</p><p>The remaining corpse guards quickly moved.</p><p>Meanwhile, the corpse guard with a mole on his eyebrows stood in the air and circulated his cultivation technique to heal his injuries.</p><p>His arm had been torn off by the sacred Eagle just now, and his vitality was greatly damaged.</p><p>He didn’t even notice that a cloud was slowly floating above his head.</p><p>Lu Ming was hidden in the cloud.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered with a cold and murderous intent.</p><p>Yes, he was going to make a move.</p><p>Among these corpse guards, only a few at the LV 6 martial King realm were a threat to him. As long as he killed a few of them with a thunderous attack, the rest of the corpse guards were nothing to be afraid of.</p><p>In particular, Lu Ming would not miss such a good opportunity.</p><p>Without a sound, the demon subduing spear appeared in his hand.</p><p>The next moment …</p><p>“Gokudo path attack!”</p><p>Lu Ming turned into a ray of spear light and shot towards the corpse guard with a mole at the center of its eyebrows from the cloud at a terrifying speed.</p><p>“Ah, not good!”</p><p>The corpse guard with a mole on its forehead was suddenly alarmed, but it was too late.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The head of the corpse guard with the mole between his eyebrows exploded. He was killed by Lu Ming in one move.</p><p>“Not good, enemy attack!”</p><p>The other corpse guards reacted and roared in shock and anger. They controlled the refined corpse and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming used the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps and rushed into the sky. With a wave of his hand, the lightning in the sky gathered.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent his palm down, and lightning filled the sky, striking the corpse guards below.</p><p>No matter if it was a corpse guard or a refined corpse, they were all extremely afraid of lightning.</p><p>??…</p><p>The corpse guards below the king level screamed as they were struck by the lightning. A large amount of corpse Qi was released from their bodies, and they fell to the ground and died.</p><p>And although the corpse guards that were at the king tier and above didn’t die, they suffered injuries of varying degrees.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming held his long spear and charged into the group of corpse guards.</p><p>He deliberately avoided the two Lv 6 martial King realm corpse guards and their refined corpses, and focused on killing the LV 4 and Lv 5 martial King realm corpse guards.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming’s Nine Dragons heaven stomping steps was so fast that he easily dodged the refined corpses and attacked the corpse guards.</p><p>This made the corpse Guard’s refined corpses useless.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it!”</p><p>The two Lv 6 martial King realm corpse guards were furious.</p><p>“Scumbags of the heavenly corpse sect, die!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with murderous intent.</p><p>He thought of old Zhuang and the other 49 people who came with him from the East. He had once vowed to avenge them.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The spear radiance stabbed out violently, and another two people were killed.</p><p>“Retreat, you guys retreat, we’ll kill him!”</p><p>A Lv 6 martial King realm corpse guard shouted.</p><p>The two Lv 6 martial King realm corpse guards controlled the five refined corpses and surrounded Lu Ming. They waved the iron chains in an attempt to block Lu Ming’s escape.</p><p>The other three lower tier King level corpse guards quickly retreated.</p><p>As for the corpse guards below the king tier, they were all dead.</p><p>In the battle with the Sheng family just now, the heavenly corpse sect had only lost a dozen corpse guards, and there were still over thirty people left.</p><p>But now, in the blink of an eye, Lu Ming had killed five of them.</p><p>Lu Ming was simply their nemesis.</p><p>The main thing was that the corpse guard with the mole between his eyebrows had been killed by Lu Ming in one move. No one could hold Lu Ming back. That was why Lu Ming had killed so many people as if he was cutting melons and vegetables.</p><p>“I’ll kill you now!”</p><p>Lu Ming stared at the two Lv 6 martial King corpse guards.</p><p>The long spear swept out and broke the chains around him.</p><p>“Dandan, smash!”</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming patted dandan.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Dandan directly flew out, rushing through the iron chains, and smashed a corpse Guard’s head.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
