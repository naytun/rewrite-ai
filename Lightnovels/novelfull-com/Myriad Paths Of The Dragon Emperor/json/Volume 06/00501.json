With a wave of their hands, they formed a light screen and blocked the firestorm that was surging toward them.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Following that, terrifying rumbles sounded in the sky. Those with lower cultivation felt their eardrums rumble and their faces turned pale. They almost vomited blood.</p><p>As for those at the rank of martial King and above, they were staring at the sky.</p><p>However, most people could not see their figures clearly. They could only see a mass of green energy and a mass of red energy constantly bombarding each other.</p><p>Each time it struck, it would produce an earth-shaking boom. The blazing light simply covered the sun in the sky.</p><p>Fortunately, the two of them were fighting in the sky. If they were on the ground, the ground within a hundred miles would have been cracked.</p><p>“Is this the power of a peak-tier King? He’s really strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked up at the sky, his fists clenched tightly.</p><p>This kind of power was indeed far beyond his current strength. However, he was not discouraged at all. Instead, his eyes were burning with fighting spirit.</p><p>“As long as you give me two years, I can definitely surpass that old man!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>The battle in the sky continued, and it became more and more intense. Finally, green and red light filled the entire sky, and the people below could no longer see what was happening above.</p><p>After about two minutes.</p><p>Huhu ~</p><p>The green and red lights dissipated, and two figures flew down from the sky.</p><p>It was mu Zheng and sacred glory.</p><p>But now, sacred glory looked very embarrassed. It was panting like a bull, its face was slightly pale, and there was a trace of blood at the corner of its mouth.</p><p>On the other hand, mu Zheng’s breathing was calm, his face was ruddy, and his clothes were neat and tidy. He was completely fine.</p><p>shengyao, I’ll let you off this time. Let’s go and leave the eastern part of the Tianxuan region!</p><p>Mu Zheng said.</p><p>“Haha, good, very good. Mu Zheng, do you think that you can protect this little bastard like this? He’s too naive. If the Sheng family wants him dead, he’ll die!”</p><p>Holy light shouted.</p><p>“Sheng Yao, do you think that the Empyrean heaven divine Palace belongs to your Sheng family? The ruler of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace is Martial Emperor Di Yi. We are just helping Martial Emperor Di Yi manage the various places. Your Sheng family will be burned by fire sooner or later with such behavior.”</p><p>Mu Zheng shouted.</p><p>mu Zheng, the Sheng family is loyal. You don’t have to use Martial Emperor Di Yi to suppress me. I’ll make it clear today. You’ve helped him once, but you can’t help him a second time. You’ve offended the Sheng family, and your fate has been decided!</p><p>shut up! holy light shouted coldly. He then looked at Lu Ming and said coldly, ” “Little bastard, just you wait, you won’t have many days left!”</p><p>old man, I was just about to say the same words to you. I’ll remember what happened today. Wash your neck clean and wait for me. One day, I’ll cut off your head!</p><p>Lu Ming retorted, giving tit for tat.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Sacred glory laughed in anger. Cold killing intent burst out from his body. He stared at Lu Ming and said,”It’s useless to have a sharp tongue. Just you wait. Let’s go back to the Sheng family!”</p><p>Shengyao waved his hand and led the way to the exit of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace.</p><p>The Holy sky and Holy might glared at Lu Ming with bitter resentment, then followed the Holy brilliance and left in the distance.</p><p>“Elder, wait for me!”</p><p>Sheng Wushuang was so scared that his face turned pale.</p><p>He didn’t dare to stay here any longer. When sacred light and the others left, he would be in trouble.</p><p>Therefore, he simply left with sacred light and the others.</p><p>“This little bastard, he’s escaped again.”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master was filled with hatred. With a move, he left the place.</p><p>The storm had ended with mu Zheng’s arrival.</p><p>“Junior Lu Ming greets the palace Master. Thank you for saving me!”</p><p>Lu Ming came in front of mu Zheng and saluted with cupped fists.</p><p>However, his mind was spinning rapidly.</p><p>Mu Zheng, also surnamed mu, I wonder how he’s related to Mu Lan?</p><p>Mu Zheng revealed a warm smile and said, ” “There’s no need to thank me. This is the eastern Palace of the Tianxuan region, and you’re my Ditian Divine Guard. It’s only right for me to help you.”</p><p>At this moment, the wind Palace Master, Fire Palace Master, and gold Palace Master had also arrived.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you alright?”</p><p>The wind Palace Master asked worriedly.</p><p>thank you for your concern, Palace Master Feng. It’s just a small injury, nothing serious!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“That’s good!”</p><p>The wind Palace Master and the others heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>“Lu Ming, this rejuvenated spirit pill is very good for healing. Take it and go back to heal your injuries. Also, you have to improve your strength as soon as possible. I don’t think the Sheng family will let this go easily.”</p><p>Mu Zheng looked at Lu Ming and said.</p><p>“Many thanks, Palace Master!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not refuse. He took the pill and bowed. Then, he turned around and returned to the eastern sky courtyard.</p><p>“Go back to your own cultivation!”</p><p>Mu Zheng waved his hand slightly.</p><p>All the onlookers had left.</p><p>In the end, only mu Zheng was left.</p><p>At this moment, a young man in a white robe stepped through the air and appeared beside mu Zheng.</p><p>If Lu Ming was here, he would definitely be able to recognize that this young man was mu xiuyuan. He was the one who came to warn Lu Ming to be careful of other people’s challenges when Lu Ming first joined the Emperor sky divine Palace.</p><p>“Sixth uncle!”</p><p>Mu xiuyuan saluted mu Zheng.</p><p>Mu Zheng looked at the eastern heaven courtyard and frowned. After a while, he sighed and said, there’s a limit to what we can do to help that girl. They’ll have to rely on themselves for the rest!</p><p>“Sixth uncle, you don’t have to worry too much. I think Lu Ming’s talent is extremely terrifying. In a few years, he might be able to compete with the Holy star!”</p><p>Mu xiuyuan said.</p><p>“I’m just afraid that I won’t be able to wait a few years!”</p><p>Mu Zheng sighed.</p><p>Mu xiuyuan was silent and did not speak.</p><p>“Forget it, let’s leave it to their good fortune. Let’s go!”</p><p>Mu Zheng sighed and left the place with mu Xiu Yuan.</p><p>…</p><p>Lu Ming walked into the eastern sky courtyard and sat down cross-legged. He took out the pill that mu Zheng gave him and swallowed it.</p><p>The moment the pill entered his mouth, it turned into a crystal-like liquid and slid down his throat. Then, it turned into a warm energy that spread throughout Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Lu Ming’s injured body was recovering rapidly. His cracked bones were also healing rapidly.</p><p>what a mysterious healing elixir. This is probably an upper Lv 5 elixir!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Soon after, he circulated the true war Dragon technique and combined it with the medicinal effects of the elixir to begin healing his injured body.</p><p>Lu Ming’s injuries were recovering rapidly.</p><p>A day later, Lu Ming’s injuries had fully recovered.</p><p>Lu Ming took a bath in the small stream in the courtyard. He washed off the blood scabs on his body, revealing his bronze-colored skin.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming changed into a long black robe, looking very energetic.</p><p>“What’s the reason for the Sheng family? You’re suddenly finding trouble with me and even want to bring me to the central continent. Is it because I beat up Sheng Wushuang?”</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged and thought to himself.</p><p>This matter was a little strange. If it was because of their grudge against Sheng Wushuang, the Sheng family wouldn’t have made such a big move. They even sent out peak-tier Kings. How was this possible?</p><p>Lu Ming had some doubts about this matter.</p><p>forget it. If I can’t figure it out, I’ll stop thinking about it. Now, I’ll continue to refine spiritual crystals and raise my cultivation!</p><p>Lu Ming took out another 10000 pieces of top-grade spiritual crystals and exploded them. He then began to devour the spiritual energy in the top-grade spiritual crystals to improve his cultivation.</p><p>Soon, he finished devouring the 10000 Supreme spiritual crystals and took out another 10000 to continue devouring.</p><p>After devouring 30000 pieces, Lu Ming’s cultivation had successfully broken through to the peak of the first level martial King realm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
