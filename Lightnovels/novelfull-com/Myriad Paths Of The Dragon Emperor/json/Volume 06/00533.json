Lu Ming had really struck it rich this time.</p><p>it’s a pity that my comprehension of the essence realm of heaven and earth isn’t deep enough. Otherwise, with so many resources, wouldn’t my cultivation be able to improve rapidly? ”</p><p>Lu Ming secretly felt that it was a pity.</p><p>next, I’ll have to comprehend the essence realm of heaven and earth with all my might. There’s also the Dragon God’s three absolutes and the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps.</p><p>Lu Ming decided on the direction of his cultivation.</p><p>The nine Dragons heaven-treading steps had both offensive and physical power. It was a divine level martial arts technique. Lu Ming would not slack off and would comprehend it whenever he had the time.</p><p>As for the three absolutes of the Dragon God, Lu Ming would not let his guard down since it was his main method of attack.</p><p>“Now, let’s go to the mission Hall and hand in the mission!”</p><p>Lu Ming sorted out his thoughts and walked towards the missions Hall.</p><p>There were still many people in the mission Hall.</p><p>Lu Ming discovered that most people were connected to the demonic scales plane.</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was about to walk towards the counter to accept missions from the cross-scales demon dimension, a cold voice was heard.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s you!”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. He turned around and his eyes turned slightly cold.</p><p>Three figures walked toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The person in the lead was an elder.</p><p>The Holy Light was the peak king who had gone to the eastern Palace, the Holy Light.</p><p>Behind sacred glory, there were two young men.</p><p>One of them was actually Sheng Wushuang, and the other looked like he was in his late twenties. Lu Ming did not know him.</p><p>The voice just now was from Sheng Wushuang.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re not dead yet?”</p><p>When sacred glory saw Lu Ming, a look of disbelief flashed in its eyes.</p><p>Sacred Jade and the rest wanted to kill Lu Ming in the demonic scales dimension. Sacred glory knew about this.</p><p>He had thought that Lu Ming would have died long ago.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming actually appeared in front of him in a lively manner. One could imagine the shock in his heart.</p><p>could it be that this little b * stard didn’t go to the demonic scales plane? or perhaps, shengyu and the others didn’t find him!</p><p>Holy light’s mind was spinning rapidly.</p><p>As for the fact that Lu Ming had killed shengyu and the rest, he would not even think about it as that was impossible.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold as he looked at the sacred glory and sneered, ” “As an elder of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, you actually wished for my death. Hehe, how laughable. It’s a pity that I’ve disappointed you.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice spread far and wide, attracting the attention of a group of people.</p><p>“How dare you, kid? what kind of attitude is this? How dare you speak to the glorious God elder like that? you’re being very disrespectful.”</p><p>Behind sacred glory, the unfamiliar young man shouted, looking very arrogant.</p><p>“Great disrespect? This old man has been waiting for me to die the moment he saw me. Why should I respect him? is there something wrong with your brain?”</p><p>Lu Ming chided loudly and looked at the young man from the corner of his eyes.</p><p>“You … You …”</p><p>The young man was so angry that he was trembling.</p><p>“How audacious!”</p><p>Shengyao shouted, his face extremely ugly.</p><p>If they were not in a public place, he would have slapped Lu Ming to death.</p><p>However, there were so many people here. Given his status, what he said just now was indeed inappropriate. He had been firmly held by Lu Ming and he could not find a reason to take action.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He could not be bothered with them and walked toward the mission counter.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the young man behind sacred glory caught up with Lu Ming in a big stride and appeared in front of the mission counter before Lu Ming.</p><p>Then, he looked at Lu Ming with a mocking expression and said, ” kid, so you’re here to hand in a mission from the demonic scales dimension. Haha, what a coincidence. I entered the demonic scales dimension a while ago and was just about to hand in my mission.</p><p>He looked at Lu Ming contemptuously and continued, ” it’s not that I want to say this, but this mission is completely suitable for a rookie from the East like you. In my opinion, you’re already very lucky to be able to seal the souls of one or two Lv 1 martial King realm corpse guards.</p><p>which eye of yours saw that I’ve only sealed the souls of one or two first tier martial King realm corpse guards? ”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the young man, amused.</p><p>“Oh, could it be that there are more than one or two, two or three pieces? Hahaha!”</p><p>The young man laughed in disdain.</p><p>“Who is that person? It looks like shengchuan is going to humiliate him.”</p><p>that’s right. This kid is quite bold to talk to the elder of the divine glory sect like that. It’s normal for shengchuan to seize the opportunity to humiliate him.</p><p>but he seems quite calm. Maybe he has some stock? ”</p><p>“What goods? it’s just an act.”</p><p>In the surroundings, some people saw that there was a show to watch, so they all gathered around and whispered.</p><p>Lu Ming had also heard that the young man was called Sheng Chuan.</p><p>At the side, Sheng Yao and Sheng Wushuang looked at Lu Ming with cold smiles.</p><p>Although he could not kill Lu Ming, it was good to see him embarrass himself.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at shengchuan indifferently and said slowly, ” “If that’s the case, then you should have gained a lot?”</p><p>it’s just so-so. But it’s more than you, without a doubt.</p><p>Shengchuan sneered.</p><p>“Oh? Since that’s the case, you can hand in the mission first and let me see it. ”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“Alright! I’ll let you experience it!”</p><p>Shengchuan smiled smugly and waved his hand. A pile of soul-sealing crystals appeared on the counter.</p><p>Each piece of soul-sealing crystal was covered with a layer of faint black light. With one look, one could tell that all of them had sealed their souls.</p><p>so many pieces! There are actually more than 20 pieces!</p><p>more than twenty pieces means more than twenty corpse guards died at shengchuan’s hands. It’s really terrifying.</p><p>“It seems that shengchuan’s cultivation has improved again.”</p><p>As soon as they saw the soul-sealing crystal shengchuan took out, the crowd burst into discussions.</p><p>“Help me check!”</p><p>Shengchuan was even more proud of himself as he spoke to an old man on the mission counter.</p><p>On the task counter, the old man picked up the soul-sealing crystal and carefully examined it piece by piece.</p><p>A moment later, all the checks were completed.</p><p>there are a total of 21 soul-sealing crystals, and all of them have sealed the souls of the corpse guards. Among them, 13 are at the LV 1 martial King realm, five are at the LV 2, two are at the LV 3, and one is at the lower tier of the LV 4 martial King realm!</p><p>The old man announced.</p><p>“What? There’s even a lower tier King tier at Lv 4 martial King realm? Even a corpse guard at the lower tier King level died at Sheng Chuan’s hands, how terrifying!”</p><p>corpse guards are difficult to kill. With the refined corpse protecting them and holy river being able to kill them, his cultivation should have broken through to Lv 5 martial King realm.</p><p>Instantly, the surroundings were filled with discussions again.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
