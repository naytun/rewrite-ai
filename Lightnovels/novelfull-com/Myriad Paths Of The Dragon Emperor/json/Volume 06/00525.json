However, it was instantly dispersed by the Saint Jade’s saber flare.</p><p>Saint Jade had always been a monstrous genius, and in terms of combat strength, a Lv 5 martial King was three levels higher than a Lv 3 martial King. Lu Ming was no match for him at all and was at a disadvantage.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Shengjiang and another peak Lv 4 martial King realm expert surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>Both of them were geniuses at the peak of the fourth level of the martial King realm. When they unleashed their full power, their combat strength was extremely terrifying. They posed a fatal threat to Lu Ming.</p><p>With the three of them working together, Lu Ming was completely overwhelmed by the storm of attacks.</p><p>“Nine Dragon bloodline, devour!”</p><p>“Second bloodline, activate!”</p><p>Lu Ming was also going all out, using all his means.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons roared, and the devouring power burst out. This made the faces of the three people change slightly, because they felt the power of their blood essence in their bodies fluctuate.</p><p>Naturally, their combat strength was also reduced. If not for this, Lu Ming would not have been able to withstand it.</p><p>“What do we do? We can’t continue like this.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing.</p><p>At this moment, if Lu Ming were to use the extreme blow, he was confident that he could kill one of the two Lv 4 martial King realm martial artists. However, to use the extreme blow, he would need to unleash most of his power in an instant and would be weakened for a while.</p><p>It might only last for a few breaths, but it would still be fatal.</p><p>A figure like Saint Jade would never let go of any opportunity.</p><p>If he were to use an extreme blow on the Saint Jade, Lu Ming was not confident that he could kill it. After all, the difference was too great.</p><p>“Die, Lu Ming, die!”</p><p>In the distance, Sheng Kong growled and showed a happy expression.</p><p>No matter how talented he was, he had to die if he dared to offend the Sheng family.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming fought with all his might and blocked more than ten moves in a row. His body trembled and his qi and blood churned. He was not careful and got a knife in his back, causing blood to flow.</p><p>“Dandan, smash!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly patted dandan.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>It glowed and expanded rapidly, flying towards the Saint Jade and smashing it head-on.</p><p>Shengyu’s expression changed greatly. With a wave of his hand, a large net appeared out of thin air. It shone brightly and covered the sky as it enveloped dandan.</p><p>Obviously, dandan didn’t expect the other party to suddenly throw out a large net. She wanted to retreat, but it was too late and she was caught by the large net.</p><p>Dandan rushed here and there, but for a moment, she couldn’t get out.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. He did not expect that the other party would take out a large net and dandan was restrained by such a large net.</p><p>Dandan was not afraid of any energy-type things, but she could not rush through physical things.</p><p>“Haha, let’s see what other tricks you have. Die!”</p><p>Shengyu laughed wildly.</p><p>In fact, he was extremely shocked.</p><p>It was unbelievable that Lu Ming could withstand so many moves from the three of them.</p><p>The one who was most shocked was still Sheng Jiang.</p><p>Previously, when Lu Ming had just arrived at Tianxuan city, he had attacked Lu Ming. At that time, although Lu Ming was not weak, there was still a long way to go before he could compare to him.</p><p>But now, Lu Ming’s combat strength had already surpassed him.</p><p>How was this possible? How long has it been? This was too terrifying.</p><p>“Kill, we must kill this little bastard, this monster!”</p><p>Shengjiang roared in his heart, and his attacks became even more fierce.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming’s chest was hit and blood spurted out.</p><p>“You want to kill me? dream on!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared, a ruthless look flashing in his eyes.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The long spear trembled and all of Lu Ming’s strength surged towards the long spear. With a twist of his body, his spine drove the spear like a dragon, turning into a spear light and piercing toward the holy river.</p><p>An extreme strike!</p><p>Now, he could only risk his life.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A Gokudo path attack could penetrate everything.</p><p>Shengjiang instantly felt cold all over, and his hair stood on end, as if the god of death was approaching him.</p><p>“Retreat, retreat, retreat!”</p><p>Shengjiang roared and retreated desperately.</p><p>He knew that if he didn’t retreat, he would die!</p><p>However, at the next moment, he realized that it was useless to retreat. Lu Ming’s spear was too fast and caught up with him in an instant.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Shengjiang roared madly, his eyes almost bleeding.</p><p>However, the next moment, Puchi!</p><p>The peerlessly sharp spear ray pierced through the space between his eyebrows.</p><p>Shengjiang, dead!</p><p>However, at this moment, Lu Ming’s body felt weak because he had used up a large amount of essential core to cast the extreme blow. Although he could quickly recover a part of his essential core, it was already too late.</p><p>“Die die die!”</p><p>The Saint Jade attacked Lu Ming madly.</p><p>The terrifying blade light seemed to be able to split everything.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes widened. He gathered what little essential core he had and set up layers of defense in front of him. At the same time, the devouring power of the nine Dragons ‘bloodline spread in front of him.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming was still sent flying and he spat out a large mouthful of blood. A deep wound appeared on his chest. It was so deep that the bone could be seen and it almost split his heart open.</p><p>The terrifying saber ray burrowed into Lu Ming’s body in a frenzy. Lu Ming circulated the true war Dragon technique in a frenzy, mobilizing his vital essence to resist.</p><p>However, the result was that Lu Ming continuously spat out a few mouthfuls of blood and his face turned pale.</p><p>He had been severely injured by the attack just now.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m going to skin you alive and pull out your tendons!”</p><p>The Saint Jade roared.</p><p>The other peak Lv 4 martial King realm youth’s face turned pale with fear.</p><p>If that shot had been aimed at him, he would have been the one dead.</p><p>Thinking of this, he felt a wave of fear.</p><p>haha, bastards of the Sheng family, it’s not that easy to kill me. Come on, I’ll kill you next!</p><p>Lu Ming laughed and pointed his long spear at the other peak Lv 4 martial King realm youth.</p><p>This made his face even paler, and he couldn’t help but take two steps back.</p><p>Not far away, there were four other youths from the Sheng family. Their faces were also pale as they looked at Lu Ming in fear.</p><p>Lu Ming’s strength had exceeded everyone’s expectations.</p><p>Tragic. This time, the Sheng family was too tragic.</p><p>When they entered the demonic scales dimension, there were a total of 28 people. They were all geniuses and elites of the Sheng family. They had spent countless resources to nurture them. But now, only six of them were left.</p><p>It was too tragic. Even if they could kill Lu Ming, they would suffer a great loss. If the higher-ups of the Sheng family found out, they would all be punished.</p><p>No wonder shengyu was so angry.</p><p>“Little bastard, you won’t be able to kill any of them. Heaven-breaking blade technique!”</p><p>die! Saint Jade roared, and a terrifying blade light emitted from her body.</p><p>At the same time, his body shriveled up as if all his essence, Qi, and blood had been sucked away.</p><p>As his body shriveled, the blade light on his body became even more terrifying. It seemed as if the blade light could split the sky.</p><p>The power of the aura was twice as strong as before.</p><p>secret skill! What a powerful secret skill!</p><p>Lu Ming could tell at a glance that the Saint Jade had cast a secret skill.</p><p>Obviously, this secret technique had a strong side effect. It would extract the essence and blood of the human body, but its power was terrifying.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
