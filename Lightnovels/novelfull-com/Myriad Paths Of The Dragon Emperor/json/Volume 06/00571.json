Furthermore, he had been ravaged by the power of Thunder. He was already at his wits ‘end. If not for the palace Master of fire’s profound cultivation, he would have died.</p><p>“Lu Ming, hurry up and leave! Hurry up and run!”</p><p>The palace Master of fire shouted.</p><p>“Go, where do you want to go? Last time, you were lucky enough to escape. This time, you’re still as stupid as ever. You’ve delivered yourself to my door. He’s really seeking his own death.”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master laughed heartily.</p><p>This time, not only would he be able to obtain the dark yellow soil, but he would also be able to get rid of Lu Ming, a great threat. Naturally, he was extremely happy.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered but he did not reply. Instead, he sent a voice transmission to dandan.</p><p>“Dandan, you said you’re an unparalleled expert. Can you slap this old man to death now?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Cough, cough, Didn’t I tell you? I’ve just been reborn, and my strength hasn’t recovered yet. I’m afraid … I’m afraid I’m not his match, but you have to believe me, when I’m at my peak, not to mention this kind of trash, even if it’s a spiritual ocean tier warrior, I can kill thousands of them with a single breath. Even if it’s a Martial Emperor, I can kill a large group with a single slap.”</p><p>Dandan stood on Lu Ming’s shoulder and transmitted her voice to Lu Ming smugly.</p><p>“I …”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Suddenly, the Thunder Palace Master shouted in a low voice. With a flash of lightning, he slashed his sword at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Raging lion’s bursting flames!”</p><p>The fire Palace Master roared, and a scorching aura burst out from his body. A huge flame Lion rushed out and charged at the Thunder Palace Master.</p><p>“True dragon Strike!”</p><p>Lu Ming thrust his spear.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a loud boom, the temple master of thunder drifted backward while Lu Ming and the temple master of fire also drifted back dozens of meters.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The palace Master of fire coughed out a large mouthful of blood. His body trembled, and he actually couldn’t float in the air. Instead, he fell to the ground.</p><p>“Senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and wrapped the palace Master of fire with his vital essence, bringing him to the ground.</p><p>“Lu Ming, run! You’re not his match!”</p><p>The palace Master of fire roared and kept spitting out blood. There were even traces of lightning in the blood.</p><p>“Hahaha, old fire, he’s about to die. If he still wants to attack, he’ll only die faster. You don’t have to tell him to escape. Do you think he can escape from me?”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master sneered, his eyes cold.</p><p>“Old man, you’re the one to die today!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were extremely cold.</p><p>There were no living beings here. Lu Ming decided to take a risk and use the lightning cauldron to kill the lightning Palace Master.</p><p>“I’m the one who died? Hahaha, that’s the funniest joke I’ve ever heard in my life!”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master laughed. Then, his face darkened and he shouted, ” “Die!”</p><p>??…</p><p>Between heaven and earth, thunder and lightning gathered, forming a huge sword of lightning that slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“True dragon Strike!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation was completely unleashed. The three-colored concepts merged and he thrust his spear forward.</p><p>A huge three-colored true dragon flew out and roared.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a violent boom, Lu Ming’s body trembled and he retreated rapidly. However, the lightning Palace master’s lightning sword was also blocked by Lu Ming.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>Not far away, the palace Master of fire was extremely shocked. He had never expected that Lu Ming would be able to block the attack of the palace Master of lightning.</p><p>“Impossible? How is that possible?”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master roared in disbelief.</p><p>In such a short period of time, Lu Ming’s cultivation had soared to the peak of the sixth level of the martial King realm, and his combat strength was extremely terrifying.</p><p>His heart trembled. He had lived for hundreds of years and had never seen such a terrifying genius. No, he was like a terrifying monster.</p><p>Even Yan kuangtu, the genius who had shocked the entire Eastern barren territory a hundred years ago, was not this terrifying.</p><p>“Kill, kill him! If I don’t kill him, I’ll die!”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master felt extremely terrified.</p><p>It was the fear that Lu Ming brought to him.</p><p>as expected, I’m still a little lacking compared to a Lv 9 martial King!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>With his combat strength, he could easily kill a Lv 8 martial King realm martial artist, but there was still a gap between him and a Lv 9 martial King realm martial artist.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I have a way to increase your strength and kill that old man!”</p><p>At this time, dandan’s voice came into his ears.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>I’m the leader of the top ten warbeasts, and I’ve lived for a very long time. Not only is my combat strength invincible, but my Dao of inscription is also invincible. I’m now inscribing an inscription formation on your body, which can make your true essence instantly go berserk and double its strength. This way, you can suppress that old man. Moreover, this method has no side effects!</p><p>Dandan explained proudly.</p><p>“Nonsense, then hurry up!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>“Hold on for a few moves, I’ll inscribe it!”</p><p>Immediately, dandan’s pair of front claws glowed with light and waved continuously.</p><p>?…</p><p>With a flash of lightning, the Thunder Palace Master turned into a bolt of lightning and appeared in front of Lu Ming in an instant, slashing down with his sword.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming blocked the attack with his long spear but his body was sent flying backward.</p><p>“Lightning strike!”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master used his killer move.</p><p>The lightning sword stabbed out, and the air was instantly scorched by the power of lightning, forming a Space Zone.</p><p>“Gokudo path attack!”</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The two powerful attacks collided. A blazing light spot that was brighter than the sun burst out where the tip of the spear and the tip of the sword met.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled violently and his qi and blood churned. He was sent flying a few thousand meters and a trace of blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth.</p><p>“Dandan, are you done?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>ahem, wait a minute. I failed just now!</p><p>Dandan coughed a few times.</p><p>“Nest!”</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to curse. Dandan was too unreliable. She failed to inscribe an inscription. Was she trying to fool him?</p><p>“I failed again!”</p><p>Dandan muttered.</p><p>“I …”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He could only fight back and fight against the palace master of thunder Palace.</p><p>The booming sounds continued. After five to six moves, Lu Ming’s body was in great pain.</p><p>“Ah, die!”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master seemed to have gone crazy, and the aura on his body became stronger and stronger.</p><p>“Dandan, are you done?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>If things didn’t go well, he would use the lightning cauldron to kill the lightning Palace Master.</p><p>“Haha, it’s done!”</p><p>Dandan laughed.</p><p>At this moment, rays of light suddenly emanated from Lu Ming’s body. Lines of beautiful inscriptions emerged on his body.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming felt the essential core in his body circulating crazily and becoming violent.</p><p>Compared to before, it was a huge improvement, not just twice.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming felt that he was filled with endless energy.</p><p>At this moment, Thunder Palace Master charged over again.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared and drew his spear.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The space trembled violently. The long spear formed an arc and struck the combat sword of Thunder Palace Master heavily.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Thunder Palace Master was like a cannonball as he was sent flying for more than ten thousand meters.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
