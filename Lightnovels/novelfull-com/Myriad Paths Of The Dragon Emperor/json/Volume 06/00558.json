Xuan Yuan screamed. Even a late stage King was smashed by dandan. His face was smashed into pieces.</p><p>How could Xuan long let go of this opportunity?</p><p>“Die, traitor!”</p><p>Xuan long controlled the three combat swords and slashed at Xuan Yuan.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>In a panic, Xuan Yuan only managed to block two swords, but he failed to block the third.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The third combat sword slashed over and cut off Xuan Yuan’s head.</p><p>A late-stage King was killed just like that.</p><p>But at the same time, the old corpse Guard’s claw pierced through Xuan Long’s chest and crushed his heart.</p><p>“Damn it, dan dan, smash!”</p><p>Lu Ming bellowed and smashed the old corpse Guard’s face.</p><p>The old corpse guard screamed and quickly retreated, but he was still smashed by dandan, and his face was beyond recognition.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming rushed over, grabbed Xuan long, and broke through rapidly.</p><p>At the same time, he used his true energy to sweep Xuan Yuan’s body into the Supreme shrine.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming swept his long spear and the refined corpses were swept away one by one. He then charged out at high speed.</p><p>“Damn it! Stop him! Stop him! I want him dead!”</p><p>The old corpse guard screamed and controlled the refined corpse to surround them.</p><p>This time, the heavenly corpse sect had moved ahead of schedule and only sent two King tiers of the upper tier. There were no king tiers of the upper tier in the direction that Lu Ming was breaking out of.</p><p>There were no king tiers at the level of the upper tier. Those below the level of a King tier could not withstand Lu Ming’s attack.</p><p>The refined corpses were sent flying like sandbags.</p><p>“Gokudo path attack!”</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming cast a Gokudo path attack and rushed out five miles away.</p><p>Then, he took a deep breath, circulated his true essence, and took a step forward, appearing ten miles away.</p><p>“Chase, chase!”</p><p>The old corpse guard roared and controlled the king level refined corpse to chase after him.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s Nine Dragons heaven stomping steps continued and he was far away in an instant.</p><p>A few minutes later, Lu Ming had already covered a distance of nearly ten thousand miles.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Xuan long kept coughing out blood and his face was as pale as paper.</p><p>Lu Ming chose a hidden place and landed. He placed Xuan long on the ground.</p><p>little brother Lu, I’m begging you. You must save Xiangxiang!</p><p>The profound Dragon Transformation coughed up blood as he spoke.</p><p>His heart had been crushed, and he had only managed to hold on because of his powerful body and profound cultivation. If it had been an ordinary person, he would have died from such injuries.</p><p>“Grandmaster Xuan, I’ll help you heal!”</p><p>Lu Ming placed his palm on Xuan Long’s back. A vast amount of vital essence gushed into Xuan Long’s body.</p><p>Lu Ming’s vital essence was the war Dragon vital essence. It was very effective. Xuan Long’s face regained some color.</p><p>“Little brother, don’t waste your Zhen Yuan, your heart has exploded, there’s nothing you can do. Little brother, I have a few things to tell you.”</p><p>Xuan long panted.</p><p>“Please speak, sect master Xuan!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>if I’m not wrong, the heavenly corpse sect seized the Xuan family’s Black iron heavy sword and then kidnapped Xiangxiang. They must have gone to the eastern barren city, opened the barren ancient tomb in the city, and taken out the corpse in the tomb to refine it into a peerless refined corpse.</p><p>“They must have gone to the East. Little brother, I beg you, please help me save Xiangxiang.”</p><p>After saying that, Xuan long actually struggled and wanted to kneel down to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Grandmaster Xuan, what are you doing? I promise you, I will definitely save Xiangxiang!”</p><p>Lu Ming said firmly.</p><p>“Good, that’s good. Little brother, this storage ring was left to me by Xiangxiang’s mother. Can you pass it to him on my behalf?”</p><p>Xuan long took off his storage ring and passed it to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Don’t worry, sect master Xuan. Lu Ming will do what he says!”</p><p>Lu Ming took the storage ring and kept it.</p><p>“Grandmaster Xuan, what is your relationship with the ancient barren city?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little curious.</p><p>Lu Ming remembered that the peerless genius of the ancient barren city, Xuan Feng, had the same surname as Xuan long and the rest.</p><p>the Xuan family of the weapon forging sect used to be part of the Xuan family of the ancient desolate city. They also have two recondite steel heavy swords. According to the legends of the Xuan family, if the two recondite steel heavy swords were to be used together to open the Tomb of the Ancients, it would be a great disaster for the Xuan family!</p><p>so, 10000 years ago, our branch left the desolate ancient city with the recondite steel heavy sword and came here to prevent the two recondite steel heavy swords from meeting. Unfortunately, the heavenly corpse sect still found out about it. They will definitely bring Xiangxiang to the desolate ancient city and seize the other recondite steel heavy sword. Once the desolate ancient tomb is opened, the Xuan family will be finished.</p><p>Xuan long explained.</p><p>At this point, Xuan Long’s life force was getting weaker and weaker.</p><p>There was no turning back.</p><p>“Little brother, Xiang Xiang, I’ll leave it to you.”</p><p>In the end, Xuan long said his last words, and his vitality dissipated. He died.</p><p>“AI!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. He dug a hole at the side and buried Xuan long.</p><p>However, there was no tombstone.</p><p>If the heavenly corpse sect found the tombstone, they would probably refine the corpse into a refined corpse.</p><p>don’t worry, Grandmaster Xuan. Since I’ve made a promise, I’ll do my best to fulfill it!</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and rose into the air. He retracted his aura and returned to the weapon forging sect.</p><p>“Quick, take everything you can!”</p><p>“Hurry up!”</p><p>As Lu Ming approached the weapon forging sect, he heard shouts.</p><p>Lu Ming flew high up in the sky and looked down, but he didn’t see any trace of Xuan Xiang. Not only that, but he also didn’t see the two corpse guards of the king level.</p><p>“Where did they take the profound fragrance?”</p><p>Lu Ming was deep in thought.</p><p>After a while, some corpse guards flew towards the North.</p><p>Lu Ming followed from a distance.</p><p>They flew at least hundreds of thousands of miles North. In front of them was a huge mountain filled with smoke. Those corpse guards all flew into that huge mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming stopped a few hundred miles away.</p><p>He didn’t dare to go any further. He guessed that it was one of the heavenly corpse sect’s old nests in the Tianxuan region. There were definitely many experts inside. It would be dangerous if he got too close and was discovered.</p><p>Lu Ming found a hidden place and hid himself well.</p><p>“Could profound fragrance have been brought here? Or have they already set off for the East?”</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows in deep thought.</p><p>“I don’t care. I will wait here for two days. If I still don’t see the profound fragrance, I will rush to the East.”</p><p>dandan, you stay here and keep watch. If there’s anything, inform me. I’ll cultivate first!</p><p>Lu Ming placed dandan on the ground and entered the Supreme shrine.</p><p>Xuan Yuan’s body was on a platform in the Supreme shrine.</p><p>Lu Ming did not want to waste the blood essence of a phenomenal-success King.</p><p>The nine Dragon bloodline appeared and devoured Xuan Yuan’s blood essence. Lu Ming took off Xuan Yuan’s storage ring. Then, he waved his hand and a wisp of flame appeared, burning Xuan Yuan’s body to ashes.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged and began to refine the blood essence of the Xuan Yuan.</p><p>The blood essence of a late stage King was simply too dense.</p><p>Lu Ming used all of it to improve his nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>2 hours later, the 6 silver chakras of the 9-Dragon bloodline became extremely brilliant. Right then, with a sound of ” hum “, a new chakra appeared.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
