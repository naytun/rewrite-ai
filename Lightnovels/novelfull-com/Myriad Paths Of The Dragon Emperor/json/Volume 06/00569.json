On top of it, divine light shone, and it was extremely mysterious.</p><p>...</p><p>Most importantly, this wing was very similar to the scene that Lu Ming had just seen. A Phoenix’s wing had been cut off …</p><p>These were phoenix wings!</p><p>Lu Ming felt that his heart was about to jump to his throat.</p><p>What was a Phoenix? An ancient divine beast, an existence on par with a true dragon, an invincible existence, and incomparably powerful.</p><p>In the divine wilderness continent, it had already been extinct for many years.</p><p>But now, here, he actually saw such a wing.</p><p>What made Lu Ming most dumbfounded was that dandan was actually eating this wing.</p><p>He saw that dandan had become a hundred meters tall. On the eggshell, there was a huge crack, and it was biting the wing bit by bit.</p><p>Moreover, the speed was very fast. In a few moments, more than half of it was eaten by dandan, even the feathers on it were not spared.</p><p>“Damn, leave some for me.”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and dashed forward.</p><p>However, as soon as Lu Ming approached, he felt a terrifying aura acting on his body. Waves of tearing pain came. Lu Ming felt that his body was almost torn apart.</p><p>Lu Ming retreated hurriedly in shock.</p><p>“What a terrifying aura. This might really be a Phoenix’s wing. Even after its death, its aura has not dispersed. Ordinary people can’t get close to it at all.”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>However, dandan, that beast, was actually completely fine and was even eating in big mouthfuls.</p><p>Very quickly, an entire wing was gnawed off by dandan.</p><p>Only a few feathers were left.</p><p>“You beast!”</p><p>Lu Ming screamed in a heart-wrenching manner.</p><p>However, after it finished gnawing, it returned to the size of a human head and landed on the mountain peak, motionless. Only its surface emitted a faint light.</p><p>After the wing was eaten, the terrifying aura disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming walked over.</p><p>“Dandan!”</p><p>Lu Ming patted dandan but she did not move.</p><p>this guy, could it be that he ate too much and needs to digest? ”</p><p>Lu Ming tried to lift dandan up but realized that she was heavier than a mountain. He could not carry her at all.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. It seemed that he would have to wait here for a while.</p><p>Lu Ming sized up his surroundings.</p><p>He realized that there were still a few feathers left on the mountain peak. Lu Ming hurriedly ran over to pick them up.</p><p>There were a total of five feathers, each about half a meter long. On that wing, it was the shortest and was considered a mixed feather, which was why it fell off.</p><p>But even so, the five feathers were sparkling and fiery red, as if they were made of fire Jade. They exuded an astonishing Qi.</p><p>Lu Ming had to use all his strength to resist it.</p><p>“This is also a Supreme treasure, keep it first!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out a storage ring and kept the five feathers.</p><p>He then looked around, but unfortunately, he didn’t find anything else.</p><p>Forget it, I’ll cultivate while waiting for dandan!</p><p>Lu Ming entered the Supreme shrine and continued to comprehend the Thunder mentality.</p><p>Lu Ming’s comprehension of the Thunder concept improved by leaps and bounds every day.</p><p>This cultivation lasted for half a month.</p><p>With the help of the path-understanding ancient tree and the lightning cauldron, Lu Ming’s half a month of cultivation was equivalent to four years of cultivation for others.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that his Thunder concept was about to break through to level one upper tier. It was just a piece of paper away.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming felt something strange outside and left the Supreme shrine.</p><p>At this moment, dandan’s body was emitting an intense light, as bright as a small sun.</p><p>A terrifying life essence rippled out.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming heard a slight cracking sound from dandan’s body and a tiny crack appeared.</p><p>“Could it be that dandan is about to hatch?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Dandan was spurted out from the Heaven’s Gate, and it was extremely wonderful. It was unafraid of any energy attack and had a huge appetite.</p><p>It could even eat heavenly tribulations and phoenix wings.</p><p>Lu Ming had always been very curious. What was dandan? What kind of creature would it be after it hatched?</p><p>Now, the answer was finally revealed.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Another sound came from the eggshell.</p><p>“Treasure, there’s a treasure here!”</p><p>Suddenly, an excited shout could be heard.</p><p>hahaha, this treasure is definitely unusual. It’s ours!</p><p>The sound of air being torn sounded out as dozens of corpse guards appeared with refined corpses.</p><p>“Brat, this treasure isn’t something you can look at. Die!”</p><p>One of the corpse guards saw Lu Ming and immediately controlled a refined corpse to attack him.</p><p>“All of you are going to die!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold. His nine Dragon bloodline emerged and he opened his mouth to suck.</p><p>The dozens of corpse guards, who were below the level of a King tier, had their blood essence devoured by Lu Ming and died an unnatural death.</p><p>The remaining two corpse guards, one at Lv 7 and the other at Lv 8 martial King realm, looked at Lu Ming with a dumbfounded expression, their eyes filled with shock.</p><p>What martial arts technique was Lu Ming performing? He had actually killed dozens of corpse guards with one move.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and charged at the two corpse guards.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In less than ten moves, the two corpse guards were killed by Lu Ming and all the storage rings fell into his hands.</p><p>At this moment, more cracks appeared on dandan’s eggshell.</p><p>As Lu Ming refined the blood essence, he fixed his gaze on dandan.</p><p>A few minutes later.</p><p>With a bang, the eggshell cracked completely. Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p><p>A turtle the size of a fist appeared before Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>This turtle stood on its two legs like a human, and its two front legs were like human hands. It stretched its waist.</p><p>“Hahaha, I’m finally resurrected. I’ve returned to the world. Experts of this world, tremble! Beauties of this world, open your hearts and wait for my arrival. Hahaha!”</p><p>The little turtle could actually speak the human language and let out a long howl.</p><p>However, his voice was extremely tender, like that of a three-year-old child. It was extremely comical.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyelids were twitching and his lips were trembling.</p><p>What the hell? What the hell was this egg hatching?</p><p>Not only did it hatch a turtle, but it was also a talking, extremely narcissistic turtle?</p><p>Lu Ming was completely speechless. After a while, he said,”Dan dan …”</p><p>Before he could finish, he was interrupted.</p><p>“Dan what dan? If you call me dandan again, this Lord won’t spare you. In the past, this Lord was like a turtle under the roof, so I endured it, but in the future, you better behave yourself.”</p><p>The little turtle placed his two front legs on his turtle shell, looking like a peerless master as he berated.</p><p>It was just that his young and tender voice really did not have the slightest bit of deterrence.</p><p>“Dandan, what are you? You can actually speak the moment you’re born. Where are your parents?”</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely curious.</p><p>“Junior, shut up. I’m telling you, I’m the head of the top ten war beasts, invincible since ancient times. I live as long as the heaven and earth, and shine as brightly as the sun and the moon. Where did I get my parents from? I’ve said it before, if you call me dandan again, I’ll get angry with you!”</p><p>The little turtle stretched out one of its claws and pointed at Lu Ming, its eyes wide open.</p><p>“The top ten warbeasts? Dandan, what’s that?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>The little turtle almost coughed up blood, and he took a few deep breaths to calm himself down. Baring his fangs, he said, ” “Forget it, you’re just a little brat, this Lord won’t stoop to your level.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
