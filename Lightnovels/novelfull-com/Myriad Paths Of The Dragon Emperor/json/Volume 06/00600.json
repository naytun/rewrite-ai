He did not continue to travel through space.</p><p>“We’re here!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu’s slightly complicated voice sounded as he looked to the East.</p><p>A hundred miles away, a pitch-black city stood tall, as if it had experienced the passage of time.</p><p>That was Tianxuan city.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with excitement. They had finally arrived at Tianxuan city.</p><p>At the same time, he was also secretly shocked. Traveling through space was too fast. There were sixteen big domains between Hong domain and Tianxuan domain, and many of them were larger than Tianxuan domain. And now, they had arrived.</p><p>It would only take about an hour.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I won’t be going to Tianxuan city with you. I’m going to the ancient barren city to check out the situation.”</p><p>Yan kuangtu said.</p><p>“Senior Yan, thank you for your help this time!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and expressed his gratitude sincerely. haha, you don’t have to thank me. I destroyed the domain-teleporting formation in the Grand domain. You won’t be able to come back, so of course I have to bring you back!</p><p>Yan Kuang tu laughed.</p><p>“Senior, I’ll take my leave then.”</p><p>Lu Ming was in a hurry to return to Tianxuan city.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu took a sip of wine and waved his hand.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and headed toward Tianxuan city.</p><p>it’s not easy to go to Tianxuan city. This kid will most likely suffer a loss if he goes!</p><p>Yan kuangtu muttered. With a wave of his hand, a ray of light flew into Lu Ming’s body and disappeared. Lu Ming could not feel it at all.</p><p>With a slight smile, Yan kuangtu’s figure moved and disappeared without a trace.</p><p>“Dandan, inscribe the inscription of true essence explosion for me!”</p><p>Lu Ming said to dandan.</p><p>This time, he had to win against the sacred constellation. He could not lose. Lu Ming had to be fully prepared.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>She started to inscribe inscriptions on Lu Ming.</p><p>This time, he actually succeeded on the first try.</p><p>Lu Ming felt his essential core surge and his body was filled with energy.</p><p>The distance of a hundred miles was covered in the blink of an eye. Lu Ming landed at the city gate and entered.</p><p>As soon as he entered the city gate, he felt that something was wrong. Everywhere was decorated with lanterns and colored banners, and it was a jubilant atmosphere.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed when he found out about it. Today was the day that Mu Lan and the Holy star were getting married.</p><p>“I hope I can make it in time!”</p><p>Lu Ming rushed to the square.</p><p>The square was packed with guests.</p><p>At the top of the square, mu Tian and the others sat on one side, while the parents and elders of Holy constellation sat on the other.</p><p>“The bride and groom have arrived!”</p><p>A voice rang out, and everyone’s eyes turned to the left side of the square.</p><p>There, two figures walked over.</p><p>They were Holy star and Mu Lan.</p><p>There was a faint smile on sacred constellation’s face, while Mu Lan’s face was devoid of any smile. She was as calm as still water.</p><p>The two of them stepped into the center of the square.</p><p>A martial artist’s marriage was different from a normal person’s.</p><p>Ordinary people needed to bow to the heavens and the earth, but martial artists didn’t.</p><p>The cultivation of martial arts had always been a heaven-defying thing. Otherwise, there would not have been a lightning tribulation when he broke through to the martial King realm.</p><p>Therefore, when martial artists got married, they would not worship heaven and earth.</p><p>As long as they knelt down and paid respects to their elders and ancestors, the people of the Ditian divine Palace had one more thing to pray for, which was to pray to Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>After these steps were completed, it would be considered an official marriage.</p><p>alright, now the newlyweds will kneel down and pay respects to the parents and elders of both parties!</p><p>A voice rang out.</p><p>“Hold on!”</p><p>Just as Mu Lan was about to kowtow to the elders of both sides on the Holy star, a voice resounded throughout the entire place.</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>Who would be so bold as to disrupt the wedding ceremony between Mu Lan and Holy constellation? did they not want to live?</p><p>However, some people were different. When they heard this voice, their bodies trembled.</p><p>Mu Lan’s delicate body trembled when she heard the voice. She turned around abruptly with a pleasantly surprised expression on her face.</p><p>Similarly, mu xiuyuan and mu Zheng also followed suit. Their expressions first changed, and then revealed pleasant surprise.</p><p>The people of the Sheng family, on the other hand, looked gloomy.</p><p>At this moment, everyone’s eyes turned towards the source of the voice.</p><p>A young man was walking towards the square, step by step.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s Lu Ming!”</p><p>Suddenly, someone shouted.</p><p>“It’s really him. Didn’t he hide? Why did you appear now?”</p><p>“It can’t be that he couldn’t bear to leave miss Mu Lan at a critical moment, so he steeled his heart and ran out, right?”</p><p>“It’s possible!”</p><p>Half a year ago, when Lu Ming had challenged the sacred constellation, everyone thought that he had challenged the sacred constellation because of Mu Lan. They all thought that Lu Ming was interested in her.</p><p>Now that it had appeared, many people would naturally think in this direction.</p><p>“Lu Ming, he’s finally here!”</p><p>Mu xiuyuan muttered, his eyes filled with anticipation.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Mu Lan looked at Lu Ming. At this moment, Mu Lan seemed to be full of energy. Her eyes were shining.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Holy star muttered, his eyes as calm as an ancient well.</p><p>Lu Ming could not cause any fluctuations in him.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Shengyao and the others who had grudges with Lu Ming looked at him with a strong murderous intent in their eyes.</p><p>“This kid is Lu Ming? What was he trying to do? Disrupt the wedding? You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Mu Yi shouted coldly.</p><p>Under countless gazes, Lu Ming walked towards Mu Lan and the sacred constellation step by step. Then, he stood more than ten meters in front of them.</p><p>“Senior Sister Mu Lan, long time no see!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“I knew you would come, kid.”</p><p>Mu Lan smiled as well. Her smile was even more radiant and charming than a flower, causing many young people to be momentarily dazed.</p><p>Senior Sister Mu Lan, we’ll catch up later. Right now, we have more important things to do!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and looked at the sacred constellation. half a year has passed on the sacred constellation. Let’s Have a Battle!</p><p>“How dare you! Who is this little bastard? How dare he disrupt constellation’s wedding? he’s courting death! Men, kill him!”</p><p>On the high platform, Saint Xingchen’s mother’s eyes flashed with a cold light as she shouted.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Two middle-aged men rushed out and charged at Lu Ming at top speed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Two terrifying auras emanated from the two of them.</p><p>Level 9 martial King realm. The two burly men were both level 9 martial King realm experts, the top figures among the king tiers of the upper tier.</p><p>“Little bastard, kneel down!”</p><p>The two burly men ran on the ground like two giant wild beasts, causing the earth to rumble.</p><p>The two of them instantly rushed to Lu Ming’s sides, one on the left and one on the right, and clasped Lu Ming’s shoulders.</p><p>The Holy star did not move, but Mu Lan exclaimed,”Lu Ming, be careful!”</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not move. He seemed to be scared silly.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The two burly men grabbed Lu Ming’s shoulders with precision and grabbed one of his arms with their other hand.</p><p>hehe, you want to challenge the Holy star with just this bit of strength? what a fool’s dream!</p><p>Mu Yi immediately sneered.</p><p>“This brat really overestimates his own ability!”</p><p>The people from sacred glory also sneered.</p><p>But in the next moment, they could no longer laugh.</p><p>“Kneel down!”</p><p>The two burly men bellowed and their essential core exploded. They grabbed Lu Ming’s shoulders and pressed him down.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s posture was straight, like an ancient divine mountain, standing on the ground without moving an inch.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
