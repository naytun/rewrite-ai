I have something urgent to attend to and need to rush back to the Tianxuan region. If there’s a chance in the future, I’ll talk to Miss feixue again.</p><p>Lu Ming was indeed a little anxious. There were only a few days left until the half-year agreement. He did not know how Mu Lan was doing.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll bring brother Lu over then!”</p><p>Fei Xue smiled.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming followed Fei Xue and walked in the direction of the inter-province transportation portal.</p><p>In the center of Hong city, there was an endless cluster of palaces. Tall and majestic walls were built to block the way.</p><p>Along the way, there were many checkpoints.</p><p>Following the flying snow, they passed through seven checkpoints.</p><p>“Flying snow, you’re here. Is this the little brother who wants to use the inter-domain teleportation formation?”</p><p>A middle-aged man was waiting at the eighth scratch-and-draw booth. He smiled when he saw Fei Xue.</p><p>“Deacon Liu, that’s right. I really have to thank Deacon Liu for his help this time!”</p><p>Fei Xue smiled.</p><p>lady feixue is too polite. I’ve already made the arrangements. Follow me!</p><p>Deacon Liu said courteously.</p><p>Following that, Fei Xue and Lu Ming followed attendant Liu and continued on their journey.</p><p>“It’s you? Kid, stop right there!”</p><p>After passing through a few more checkpoints, a gloomy voice suddenly rang out.</p><p>Lu Ming looked in the direction of the voice and his face darkened.</p><p>“Qin qingfei!”</p><p>Fei Xue’s expression changed.</p><p>Qin qingfei brought a few young men and walked over. He looked at Lu Ming with a cold expression.</p><p>“Deacon Liu, what happened? You actually brought an outsider and wandered around the important place of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. How dare you!”</p><p>Qin qingfei’s gaze shifted and landed on attendant Liu.</p><p>Deacon Liu’s expression changed. He cupped his fists and said, ” “Young master Qin, this young hero is a good friend of miss feixue. Not only that, he’s also an Emperor heaven Divine Guard of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace.”</p><p>“Nonsense. What Ditian divine guards? why have I never seen them before? tell me, what do you want to do with them?”</p><p>Qin qingfei berated.</p><p>Deacon Liu’s expression was somewhat unsightly as he said, ” “This young hero wants to take the inter-province transportation formation …”</p><p>“What? Take the inter-domain teleportation formation? The inter-province transportation array is an extremely important item of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. You actually brought an unknown person to take the inter-province transportation array? what if this person is a spy? If something happens to the inter-province transportation formation, can you bear the responsibility? Even ten of your lives won’t be enough.”</p><p>Qin qingfei roared.</p><p>“This … This …”</p><p>Deacon Liu’s expression turned even uglier and he began to hesitate.</p><p>Previously, it was feixue who came to ask him for help. Feixue’s identity was no small matter. Naturally, he agreed readily. He did not think too much about it and did not suspect Lu Ming’s identity. Now that Qin qingfei said that, he was so scared that he broke out in cold sweat.</p><p>Indeed, if something went wrong, he would be finished. Even Fei Xue couldn’t protect him.</p><p>“Qin qingfei, Lu Ming is an Emperor sky Divine Guard. He’s not a spy!”</p><p>Fei Xue said.</p><p>“If you’re not a spy, show me the evidence!”</p><p>Qin qingfei sneered.</p><p>He did not believe Lu Ming at all when he said that he was from the Tianxuan region.</p><p>“You want to see evidence, right? this is my Ditian Divine Guard token. Take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out his Divine Guard token and threw it to Qin qingfei.</p><p>Qin qingfei took a look and his expression changed immediately, revealing a trace of disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming was really the Ditian Divine Guard, and it was the Ditian Divine Guard of the Tianxuan region.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had already said that he was an Emperor sky Divine Guard from the Tianxuan region, but he did not believe him at all.</p><p>Why would an Emperor heaven Divine Guard at the martial King realm from the Tianxuan region come to the Hong domain and even appear in the ruins of the puppet sect? he had thought that Lu Ming was just fooling him. He had never expected that it was true.</p><p>“Now you see, I’m an empyrean heaven Divine Guard. No matter which Palace it is, it all belongs to the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. As long as you’re an empyrean heaven Divine Guard, you’re qualified to use the inter-province transportation formation. Now, you can ‘get lost’, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming used his vital essence to roll the divine Guard token back. He said coldly, emphasizing the last two words,’get lost’.</p><p>Qin qingfei’s expression turned ugly and his expression changed rapidly. Finally, he rolled his eyes and sneered, ” “So what if you’re the Ditian Divine Guard? It’s a pity that the teleportation formation slots have been used up and we’ll have to wait for the next one.”</p><p>“The quota is gone. Impossible. I asked around yesterday. It’s not over at all.”</p><p>Fei Xue said.</p><p>“Yesterday. Sorry, I just finished today.”</p><p>Qin qingfei sneered.</p><p>impossible! Qin qingfei, get out of the way. I want to go over and ask him personally!</p><p>Fei Xue shouted.</p><p>“Ask what? The elder in charge of the inter-province transportation formation is my eighth uncle. I’ll send him a message now and ask him to come over and talk to you.”</p><p>Qin qingfei snorted. He took out a jade talisman and sent a message.</p><p>Not long after, there was a flash of light, and a middle-aged man appeared in the field.</p><p>“Qing Fei, what’s the matter?”</p><p>The middle-aged man looked at Qin qingfei.</p><p>eighth uncle, feixue brought a brat with her. She wants to use the inter-domain teleportation array. I told them that there were no more slots but they didn’t believe me!</p><p>Qin qingfei said.</p><p>The middle-aged man looked at Fei Xue and said, ” “There are indeed no more spots.”</p><p>impossible! There were still slots left yesterday!</p><p>Fei Xue’s expression was ugly.</p><p>“Feixue, you’re getting more and more daring. Are you suspecting me? I’ve been in charge of the teleportation array for many years. Do you think I don’t know if there are any spots? Please go back!”</p><p>The middle-aged man’s face darkened as he waved his hand.</p><p>Fei Xue bit her red lips.</p><p>“Then, when will the next batch of slots be available?”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming spoke.</p><p>I’m not sure about the next batch. After using it this time, the inter-province transportation formation will need to be repaired. It will probably take a year and a half.</p><p>The middle-aged man sneered.</p><p>“A year and a half?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was extremely gloomy. One and a half years, how could he make it in time?</p><p>Qin qingfei and the middle-aged man were clearly making things difficult for him.</p><p>However, this was the Hongyu Palace, and there were countless experts here. The middle-aged man’s cultivation was unfathomable, so it was impossible for him to barge in. The only path he could take was death.</p><p>However, the other party insisted that there were no more slots, so he had no choice.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Qin qingfei laughed coldly. He was extremely pleased to see the ugly expressions on Fei Xue and Lu Ming’s faces.</p><p>“Lady flying snow, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and left.</p><p>Now, he could only think of other ways.</p><p>“Brother Lu, there might be another way!”</p><p>On the way, Fei Xue said.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“In six days, the biggest auction in Hong city, the heaven secret auction organized by the heaven secret Chamber of Commerce, will be held. Every time, the Emperor heaven divine Palace will auction two slots for the inter-province transportation in the form of a token. They are known as the cross-province token. The purpose is to give those outside the Emperor heaven divine Palace the opportunity to cross-province and head to other large regions.”</p><p>as long as one’s identity is clear, they can buy the token. As long as they can buy the token and have no problems with their identity, Qin qingfei and the others will have no reason to stop them.</p><p>Fei Xue explained.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
