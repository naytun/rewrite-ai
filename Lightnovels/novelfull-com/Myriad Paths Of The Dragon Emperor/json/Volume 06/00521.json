A strong fragrance immediately assailed his nose.</p><p>...</p><p>“It’s indeed good wine!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Haha, of course it’s good wine. Come, drink!”</p><p>Han man laughed heartily and took a few big gulps of wine.</p><p>“Come!”</p><p>Mu Sen and Mu Lin also lifted their wine jars and took a few big gulps.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and picked up the wine jar as well. He took a few big gulps and felt the rich aroma of the wine. He could not help but say,”It’s indeed good wine!”</p><p>On the side, Yao Xuan also took a few sips, and her cheeks flushed red.</p><p>Following that, everyone tore off the roasted demonic beast meat and ate and drank it in large mouthfuls with fruit wine.</p><p>Not long after, the jar of wine was finished. Even Yao Xuan had drunk half a jar. Her face was red and extremely cute.</p><p>Han man’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets. A fiery light flashed in his eyes, and he quickly turned his head away.</p><p>“You guys, when do you plan to take action?”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming put down the wine jar and suddenly asked.</p><p>He was asking about han man, mu Sen, and Mu Lin.</p><p>The few of them were stunned and revealed a puzzled expression. “What do you mean? Brother Lu, what do you mean?”</p><p>“Of course you’re going to attack me?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Han man and the others ‘faces changed drastically, and a trace of panic flashed through their eyes.</p><p>brother Lu, you must be joking. Why would we attack you? ”</p><p>Han man smiled.</p><p>At the side, Yao Xuan also looked puzzled. She blinked her big eyes and looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“You’re still pretending? You think it’s flawless, but you don’t know that it’s full of flaws!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice slowly turned cold.</p><p>“Brother Lu, are you mistaken?”</p><p>Han man’s face turned ugly.</p><p>“Misunderstanding? Hehe, the moment I entered the demonic scales dimension, you guys came looking for me and invited me to join your team. What a coincidence.”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>brother Lu, this is really a coincidence. At that time, we had just invited miss Yao Xuan to join us and we were still short one person. When we saw brother Lu coming in, we invited you.</p><p>Han man explained.</p><p>okay, this point is reasonable. However, you guys were too generous when we excavated mid-rank earth element intent crystals.</p><p>middle-grade profound meaning crystals are extremely precious. One of them is equivalent to a thousand pieces of high-grade and low-grade profound meaning crystals, but you guys are so generous. You gave them to me without even thinking about it. Most people would definitely be reluctant to part with them and give me a passionate look, but you guys don’t. This is too abnormal. It’s very simple. You guys just want to win my trust.</p><p>also, when we met the people of the Sheng family, it was just a show put on by you and the Sheng family. The people of the Sheng family have always been high and mighty. They are all very proud. How could they retreat just because of a few words from you? ”</p><p>“An ordinary person wouldn’t dare to go against the Sheng family, but you guys did it. You acted as if you were fearless, and the Sheng family even retreated. Hehe, this is nothing more than you trying to lower my guard and win my trust. Unfortunately, your acting was too much.”</p><p>Lu Ming explained calmly.</p><p>Han man, mu Sen, and Mu Lin’s faces turned ugly.</p><p>At this moment, Yao Xuan’s body suddenly trembled. Her face turned pale, and her body seemed to have lost all strength. She suddenly went soft and fell to the ground.</p><p>“What’s going on? Why do I suddenly feel so weak? I can’t even use my true essence.”</p><p>Yao Xuan cried out in panic.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s expression changed as well. He turned pale and his body fell backward slightly. He roared,”You guys poisoned the wine.”</p><p>poison? no, I didn’t. Brother Lu, please don’t say that.</p><p>Han man denied.</p><p>you’re still denying it? my whole body is soft and I can’t use my true essence. I’m clearly poisoned.</p><p>Lu Ming roared angrily.</p><p>“I’ve been poisoned too, why are you all fine?”</p><p>Yao Xuan looked at the three of them in panic.</p><p>Han man and the other two were indeed fine.</p><p>Han man sized Lu Ming up carefully, his eyes shining brighter and brighter. Then, he laughed smugly. hahaha, Lu Ming, you’ve been poisoned. You’ve been poisoned by the ten fragrant tendon softening powder. Your body is weak and you can’t mobilize your vital essence. Now, you’re a piece of fish on the chopping board!</p><p>“You … You guys … You really did poison her. Why?”</p><p>Yao Xuan cried out in disbelief.</p><p>“Why? It’s all because this brat is overestimating himself. He even dared to offend the Sheng family. Isn’t he courting death? you’re just a tool that we’re using.”</p><p>Han man glanced at Yao Xuan, his face was gloomy, and he no longer looked as simple and honest as before.</p><p>Mu Sen and Mu Lin’s expressions were similar.</p><p>you’re just trying to lower my guard by bringing Yao Xuan along. But there’s one more thing that I really can’t figure out.</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Oh, what is it? I don’t mind explaining it to you!”</p><p>Han man said with a proud smile.</p><p>He was not afraid that Lu Ming would delay the time because the longer the ten fragrant tendon softening powder was used, the more powerful the effects would be.</p><p>if the Sheng family wanted to deal with me, they could have just sent experts to kill me. Why did they send you to get close to me and poison me in the dark? my cultivation is not strong enough for the Sheng family to send someone to assassinate me.</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>hehe, Lu Ming, it’s easy for the Sheng family to kill you. But wouldn’t it be too easy for you to kill you just like that? what the Sheng family wants is for your reputation to be ruined and your name to be infamous for thousands of years.</p><p>“If you did something to Yao Xuan and killed her after that, we would arrive at the right time and take you down. How do you think the higher-ups of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace would look at you? also, how would that miss Mu Lan look at you?”</p><p>Han man sneered.</p><p>Lu Ming came to a realization. It turned out that this was the Sheng family’s purpose. They wanted to ruin his reputation. They were really vicious.</p><p>Yao Xuan’s face was pale and her eyes were filled with fear. Her body trembled as she shouted, ” “I don’t know anything. I beg you, please let me go!”</p><p>“Let you go? How was that possible? If you want to blame someone, blame your bad luck!”</p><p>Han man sneered, his eyes swept over Yao Xuan’s body and revealed a burning light, ” “Lu Ming, I’ll help you with this chick’s ***. Haha.”</p><p>Han man walked toward Yao Xuan with a smirk on his face.</p><p>“Don’t, don’t come over, you beast!”</p><p>Yao Xuan’s body trembled even more as tears streamed down her face.</p><p>She had never thought that han man, who originally looked honest and kind, would be such a beast in heart.</p><p>“Yao Xuan, it’s such a pity for a beauty like you to die. Before you die, let me enjoy you!”</p><p>Han man laughed evilly.</p><p>On the side, mu Sen and Mu Lin both revealed envious expressions.</p><p>scumbags like you have deceived so many people. It’s a waste of air to live in this world!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming sighed slightly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re on the verge of death and you’re still whining. You’re looking for a beating!”</p><p>Mu Lin aimed a kick at Lu Ming’s face.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
