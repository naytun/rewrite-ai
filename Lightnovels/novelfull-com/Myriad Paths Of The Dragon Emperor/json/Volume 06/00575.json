He did not say much and flew to the corpse of the hall Master of earth.</p><p>...</p><p>Although they were a distance away, Lu Ming still heard the discussion between the three people from the Xuan family and the two guardians.</p><p>These five people’s characters were really not good. Lu Ming did not want to say more.</p><p>The five of them exchanged glances and followed behind Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his palm and a surge of vital essence covered the body of the palace Master of earth, eliminating all the aura and inscription marks left by the corpse refinement sect. The palace Master of earth was now an ordinary corpse.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming dug a hole nearby and buried the hall Master of earth.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what are your plans from now on? why don’t you join us?” he asked.</p><p>One of the Guardians said as he looked at Lu Ming with a hopeful look.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was too strong. If Lu Ming could be with them, they would be much safer.</p><p>“Okay, I’m going to the corpse guard gathering point to hunt corpse guards. Are you guys coming?”</p><p>There was a faint smile on Lu Ming’s lips as he looked at the three people from the Xuan family and the two guardians.</p><p>go to the gathering point of the corpse guards to kill them? are you crazy? there are more than 300 corpse guards there, and three of them are level nine martial King realm corpse guards. They’re controlling the flood Dragon’s corpse. You’re just going to die if you go there.</p><p>The middle-aged man from the Xuan family shouted.</p><p>“Oh? So you’re not going?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s really too dangerous there. You’d better go somewhere else with us and see if you can find a way out.”</p><p>A protector said.</p><p>“If that’s the case, then please leave!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand.</p><p>He didn’t have a good impression of these people.</p><p>“You … “Lu Ming, don’t think that you can look down on others just because you have some abilities. I won’t go to death with you.”</p><p>After the middle-aged man from the Xuan family finished speaking, he turned around and left.</p><p>The other four people’s expressions changed and they followed the middle-aged man from the Xuan family.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and did not care.</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists at the earth Temple master’s mound, then turned around and headed inland.</p><p>One hundred thousand miles away, there was a plain. On it were huge coffins, and corpse Qi filled the air.</p><p>This was the gathering point of the heavenly corpse sect’s corpse guards.</p><p>“Who’s there?”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming arrived, he was discovered. A corpse guard controlled two refined corpses to appear.</p><p>“The person who will kill you!”</p><p>An ice-cold voice sounded, and with a flick of his finger, a spear ray shot out, nailing the corpse guard to death.</p><p>“There’s a sneak attack!”</p><p>A loud roar was heard, and the entire plain was in an uproar.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The sound of the air being torn rang out as corpse guards and refined corpses flew out of the coffins one by one.</p><p>In a short while, a few hundred corpse guards and even more refined corpses appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>“A person? Why is he alone?”</p><p>you dare to ambush me alone? you’re courting death!</p><p>“Attack and kill him!”</p><p>Some corpse guards shouted and controlled the refined corpses to pounce at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming stood still in the void. With a wave of his hand, more than ten spear gleams shot out.</p><p>His speed was so fast that no one below the late stages of the king realm could react in time.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>The sound of over a dozen sharp blades piercing into bodies sounded out, and over a dozen corpse guards were killed.</p><p>Two of them were even Lv 6 martial King realm experts.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>The other corpse guards were greatly shocked and couldn’t help but retreat.</p><p>get out of the way! This person is a late stage King tier! You guys are not his match!</p><p>A shriveled voice sounded out, and an old corpse guard appeared.</p><p>Beside him, there were two middle-aged corpse guards.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>With two roars, two giant demonic corpses appeared in front of the old corpse guard.</p><p>In addition, there were two strange refined corpses. They wore armor and held long Spears. They were different from the other refined corpses.</p><p>However, they all exuded an extremely powerful aura. They were all refined corpses of the LV 9 martial King realm.</p><p>Further back, there were two ordinary refined corpses wrapped in chains. They also exuded a powerful aura of Lv 9 martial King realm.</p><p>There were three Lv 9 martial King realm corpse guards and six Lv 9 martial King realm refined corpses.</p><p>This could be said to be the peak power among the corpse guards attacking the ancient barren city this time.</p><p>“Everyone’s here. Good, it saves me the trouble of looking for them one by one!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold.</p><p>“Little guy, what big words! From your aura, I can tell that you’ve just broken through to the late King tier not long ago, and you’re already saying that you’re going to kill us? you’re really overestimating yourself! Kill!”</p><p>The old corpse guard sneered. Then, a huge demonic corpse roared and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>The demonic corpse’s eyes were blood red, and its entire body was filled with a murderous aura. It pounced forward, bringing with it a strong gust of wind.</p><p>The wind Lightning Spear appeared in his hand and swept out.</p><p>A huge spear light appeared and surrounded the three heaven and earth essences.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The huge demonic corpse looked like a doll as it was swept away by Lu Ming’s spear.</p><p>The surrounding corpse guards couldn’t Dodge in time and were sent flying by the demonic corpse’s huge body. Some of the corpse guards directly exploded.</p><p>“So strong?”</p><p>All the corpse guards on the scene, including the three Lv 9 martial King corpse guards, widened their eyes and looked dumbfounded.</p><p>A Lv 9 martial King realm demonic corpse was stronger than an ordinary refined corpse.</p><p>It was impervious to swords and Spears and had immense strength. However, it was easily swept away by Lu Ming’s spear. It was too terrifying.</p><p>“Let’s attack together and kill this man!”</p><p>The old corpse guard roared.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>With a roar, the three Lv 9 martial King realm corpse guards joined forces. The remaining five Lv 9 martial King realm refined corpses pounced toward Lu Ming with shocking power.</p><p>At the same time, some other corpse guards controlled the refined corpses to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long roar, and his true essence rumbled. His aura soared to the sky, and the nine Dragon bloodline appeared. He opened his mouth and sucked, and instantly, more than fifty corpse guards nearby had their blood essence devoured and fell to the ground.</p><p>At the same time, he brandished his spear like an invincible general.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The five Lv 9 martial King refined corpses were swept away by him.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming’s combat strength had completely surpassed Lv 9 martial King realm and was approaching the peak of King realm.</p><p>not good! He’s controlling the flood Dragon’s corpse!</p><p>The old corpse guard shrieked and quickly retreated with the other two Lv 9 martial King corpse guards. They formed a seal with their hands and corpse Qi filled the air.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar was heard, and the corpse of a huge flood Dragon rushed out from the depths of the plain.</p><p>The three Lv 9 martial King realm corpse guards flew up to the head of the flood Dragon’s corpse and controlled it to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s nine Dragon bloodline burst out with a terrifying devouring power, killing another fifty corpse guards.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming did not let go of any storage rings.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The old corpse guard roared angrily. The flood Dragon corpse clawed at Lu Ming.</p><p>The space seemed to be unable to withstand the pressure and started to shake violently.</p><p>The air was compressed and exploded wherever the claw touched.</p><p>“Let’s see how strong he is! True dragon Strike!”</p><p>Lu Ming exerted all his strength and thrust his spear.</p><p>A three-colored true dragon clashed with the flood Dragon’s corpse.</p><p>With a shocking explosion, the force rolled in all directions. Some of the corpse guards nearby were directly torn apart by the force and died on the spot.</p><p>The earth trembled and huge cracks appeared on the ground, spreading across the plain like a spider web.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
