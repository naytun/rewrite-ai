After a while, it coughed and said, ” “Back then, I experienced a bitter battle and was seriously injured. I had no choice but to turn into an egg. After countless years, I was finally reborn. As I had just been reborn, my memories are not complete. As for what the top ten Battle Beasts were, I can’t remember clearly.”</p><p>...</p><p>“You can’t remember?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at dandan suspiciously and said, ” “Then you should be very strong, right?”</p><p>cough, cough, Didn’t I tell you? I was too heavily injured back then, and I’ve just been reborn. I haven’t recovered much of my strength!</p><p>Dandan placed a turtle claw by her mouth and coughed a few times in a very human-like manner.</p><p>“Dandan, you’re not lying to me, are you?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at dandan with a look of disbelief.</p><p>In the past, dandan had been very intelligent. Lu Ming suspected that before dandan hatched, she had learned to speak. After she hatched, she pretended to be an expert to fool him.</p><p>The more he thought about it, the more he felt that it was possible.</p><p>As for the so-called top ten warbeasts, he didn’t believe it at all.</p><p>“Brat, you actually dare to doubt me? fine, in order to make you convinced, I’ll give you a good fortune now.”</p><p>Dandan put her hands behind her back, her face full of displeasure.</p><p>“Oh? What good fortune?”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>I sensed that there’s a Supreme treasure in a place not far away. I’ll Take You There now and make you convinced!</p><p>Dandan snorted coldly.</p><p>“What treasure?”</p><p>Lu Ming was very curious.</p><p>hehe, if I’m not wrong, that should be the dark yellow soil. It can absorb all the energy in the world and transform it into its own energy to grow peerless spiritual medicine!</p><p>Dandan smiled proudly.</p><p>“What? Profound yellow soil? Is that true?”</p><p>Lu Ming was greatly shocked.</p><p>Xuanhuang soil was a rare treasure that only appeared when the world was first created. It was a divine soil used to grow spiritual herbs.</p><p>In the ancient times, even the ancient times, the most powerful people in the world would use the dark yellow soil to cultivate spirit herbs.</p><p>However, the dark yellow soil was extremely rare and was sold in taels. One tael could be sold for a sky-high price.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately thought of the path-understanding ancient tree. If he had the dark yellow soil, the problem of cultivation would be much easier.</p><p>The spring water in the jade box containing the ancient tree of comprehension was almost empty, so it was crucial to find spiritual liquid to nurture it.</p><p>“Hehe, come with me!”</p><p>Dandan smiled complacently. With her hands behind her back, she spread her legs and stepped on the air, flying into the distance at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was skeptical, he still followed her.</p><p>About 50,000 miles away from Lu Ming, the area within a thousand miles was barren and desolate. Not a single blade of grass grew.</p><p>Two figures were flying within.</p><p>If Lu Ming was here, he would be able to recognize the two of them at a glance. One of them was the palace Master of lightning, and the other was the palace Master of fire.</p><p>eh, there’s a medicinal fragrance coming from over there.</p><p>Suddenly, the palace Master of fire stopped.</p><p>“Medicinal fragrance?”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master was a little confused.</p><p>there’s no mistake. I’m usually a part-time Alchemist, so I’m extremely sensitive to the smell of spirit herbs. It’s not far ahead.</p><p>The palace Master of fire said.</p><p>“I don’t even see spirit medicine in this world, and yet here it is in this barren land. It’s definitely extraordinary. Let’s go take a look!”</p><p>Thunder Palace master’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The two of them advanced at an extreme speed. Not long after, a mound appeared in front of them. The medicinal fragrance was coming from this mound.</p><p>The surroundings of the mound were also barren, but there were seven spiritual herbs growing on the mound.</p><p>“That’s the common knotgrass. What’s going on? It’s actually emitting such terrifying medicinal properties!”</p><p>When the two of them saw it, they were both shocked.</p><p>This was because the common knotgrass was a level 1 spiritual herb. To them, it was like trash.</p><p>However, the seven knotweeds in front of him were translucent and surrounded by divine multicolored light, giving off a strong medicinal fragrance.</p><p>It was definitely not a level 1 spiritual herb, but a level 6 spiritual herb.</p><p>And it was a top grade Lv 6 spiritual herb.</p><p>What kind of place was this? how could it turn a level 1 spiritual herb into a top-tier level 6 spiritual herb?</p><p>“Profound yellow soil, that’s profound yellow soil!”</p><p>The palace Master of fire looked at the bottom of the seven-section grass and his eyes suddenly widened, revealing a look of disbelief.</p><p>Below the seven-section grass was red and yellow soil. A terrifying spiritual energy was exuding from the soil.</p><p>This was xuanhuang silicoearth.</p><p>“What? Profound yellow soil!”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master was also shocked. His eyes were wide open, and then, his eyes revealed a burning greed.</p><p>Looking at the surface area, it was about one meter square. How many Jin was it?</p><p>One had to know that in the outside world, in a small domain like the Tianxuan region, treasures like the xuanhuang Obsidian could not be found. In some larger domains, it was possible to find xuanhuang Obsidian, but they were extremely rare and were sold at the price of two taels.</p><p>And here, he didn’t know how many Jin there were.</p><p>“Hahaha, I’m rich, I’m rich!”</p><p>The palace Master of fire’s mouth was about to split open from his smile.</p><p>Compared to the dark yellow soil, the seven pieces of Level 6 upper-grade common knotgrass were not as eye-catching.</p><p>“Old Huo, since the two of us have discovered it together, we’ll each take half of it. How about it?”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master said.</p><p>“Sure, no problem!”</p><p>The palace Master of fire nodded and stared at the xuanhuang silicoid soil.</p><p>old Huo, you are more skilled in alchemy. You will be in charge of excavating the dark yellow Obsidian soil. I will stand guard at the side.</p><p>Thunder Palace Master said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The palace Master of fire nodded and then flew toward the mound with a fiery gaze.</p><p>At this moment, a sinister look flashed across the eyes of the Thunder Palace Master. A sword of lightning appeared in his hand, and he stabbed the back of the fire Palace Master.</p><p>The fire Palace Master had never expected that the Thunder Palace Master, whom he had known for several hundred years, would make a move on him. He was caught off guard and was stabbed in the face.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The sword of lightning pierced through the palace Master of fire’s chest.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The fire Palace Master let out an earth-shattering roar. A fire Lion appeared and pounced at the Thunder Palace Master.</p><p>Thunder Palace Master pulled out his long sword and retreated a thousand meters, avoiding the fire lion’s attack.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>The fire Palace Master turned around. His eyes were red as he looked at the Thunder Palace Master in disbelief.</p><p>“Hehe, Isn’t It a Pity for two people to share such a large piece of dark yellow soil? I’ll take it all for myself. Isn’t that great? also, I’ve been coveting the power Upanishad crystals in your storage ring for a long time.”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master sneered.</p><p>“You, you deserve to die! You should die!”</p><p>The palace Master of fire roared in anger.</p><p>“I deserve to die? Hahaha, you’re the one who’s going to die now!”</p><p>The Thunder Palace Master laughed wildly. The Thunder on his body flashed, and his eyes were filled with killing intent.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Right at this moment, a furious roar was heard. A figure was approaching at extreme speed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A figure appeared. It was Lu Ming. The little turtle dandan was standing on his shoulder.</p><p>Under dandan’s guidance, he flew over and just happened to see the scene of the palace master of thunder attacking the palace Master of fire.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
