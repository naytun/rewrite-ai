It was far above them. If they were to forcefully charge forward, they would only end up like the scaled demon race.</p><p>forget it, let’s retreat. The heavenly corpse sect is too powerful.</p><p>Han man said with a frown.</p><p>The heavenly corpse sect had two peak Lv 3 martial King realm refined corpses and five other Lv 3 martial King realm refined corpses. They were too powerful for them to fight against, and this did not include the five corpse guards.</p><p>The five corpse guards were not a weak force.</p><p>“It’s not easy to find such a place, how can I miss it so easily!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming spoke.</p><p>Han man, Mu Lin, and the others were all stunned.</p><p>Then, he looked at Lu Ming in disbelief.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what do you want to do? You can’t be thinking of killing your way up there, right? that’s a dead end!”</p><p>Mu Sen said.</p><p>“If you haven’t fought, how do you know that you’ll die?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and stood up. He stepped on the air and headed toward the tribe of the scale demon race.</p><p>“Lu … Lu Ming!”</p><p>Yao Xuan exclaimed in a low voice. She wanted to follow Lu Ming but she did not dare to and was hesitating.</p><p>Han man, mu Sen, and Mu Lin looked at each other, but did not follow. Instead, their eyes flashed with a trace of gloominess.</p><p>Lu Ming’s speed was extremely fast. In just a few steps, he had appeared in the sky above the tribe of the scale demon race.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>One of the corpse guards shouted and looked at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>The other four corpse guards also looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“The person who will kill you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly. His voice was calm, but there was a cold murderous intent in it.</p><p>“Kill us? Haha, just you? It’s a big joke.”</p><p>A corpse guard laughed loudly, filled with disdain.</p><p>“Brat, you’re the Ditian Divine Guard, right? Hehe, a Ditian Divine Guard actually dares to appear when he sees us. He’s really looking for death. Kill him!”</p><p>A corpse guard shouted.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A refined corpse at the intermediate Lv 3 martial King realm waved its arms and chains shot out like poisonous snakes, winding around Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming released his aura and waved his spear. A few iron chains were sent flying by Lu Ming.</p><p>you’re only at the peak Lv 2 martial King realm. How dare you resist? you’re looking for death!</p><p>The corpse guard shouted and controlled the peak Lv 3 martial King realm refined corpse to charge at Lu Ming.</p><p>The other four corpse guards stood at the side and didn’t make a move, looking like they were watching a good show.</p><p>“I’m too lazy to play with you guys, die!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly. The concept of Thunder soared into the sky and combined with Lu Ming’s spear technique.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The spear turned into a Lightning Spear radiance and pierced through everything.</p><p>The refined corpse was afraid of lightning. Moreover, Lu Ming’s lightning concept had already reached the middle stage of level one lower tier.</p><p>With a bang, the refined corpse was struck by the lightning Spear radiance and turned into charcoal.</p><p>initial success of Thunder concept, you … You …”</p><p>That corpse guard shouted in shock.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming said in a cold voice.</p><p>Another Lightning Spear was thrust out.</p><p>That corpse guard wanted to retreat in fear, but how could he avoid it?</p><p>He was struck by the lightning Spear radiance, and a huge hole was blasted in his chest. Corpse Qi gushed out of his body, and he was no longer breathing.</p><p>“Dammit, let’s attack together and kill him!”</p><p>The other four corpse guards were shocked and furious. They roared and controlled the refined corpses to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>There were a total of nine refined corpses.</p><p>Six of them were Lv 3 martial King realm and above, while the remaining three were Lv 2 martial King realm.</p><p>a bunch of trash who toyed with other people’s corpses. All of you shall die!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming held the long spear in his hand. The Spear’s gleam grew to a thousand meters long and swept in all directions with the momentum of sweeping away thousands of troops.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The nine refined corpses were like nine broken gunny sacks. They were sent flying by Lu Ming without any resistance.</p><p>“This … ‘This …’ How is this possible?”</p><p>The four corpse guards were tongue-tied, and their eyes almost exploded with disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming, a mere second level martial King, his combat strength was too terrifying!</p><p>“Not good, quickly retreat!”</p><p>One of the corpse guards shouted in shock.</p><p>Without the protection of the corpse guards, their battle strength would be greatly reduced.</p><p>“It’s too late to retreat now. Gokudo path attack!”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming became one with the spear and turned into a ray of spear radiance that pierced through the void.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>A corpse guard at the peak Lv 3 martial King realm died on the spot after being pierced through the glabella.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The other three corpse guards shouted in fear and scattered.</p><p>On the mountain peak not far away, han man and the others were also dumbfounded.</p><p>“Attack and help Lu Ming!”</p><p>Han man’s eyes flashed with a trace of gloominess, and with a low shout, he rushed out.</p><p>Then, Mu Lin, mu Sen, and Yao Xuan also rushed over and attacked one of the corpse guards.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming seemed to have turned into a bolt of lightning. In a flash, he appeared behind a corpse guard and stabbed with his spear, finishing off the corpse guard.</p><p>Then, his body moved and pounced on the next corpse guard.</p><p>When Lu Ming finished off the fourth corpse guard, han man and the rest had also killed the fifth corpse guard.</p><p>Once the corpse guard died, those refined corpses all stood in the void without moving.</p><p>brother Lu, you really don’t reveal your true abilities. I didn’t expect you to be so strong. I really admire you.</p><p>Han man and the rest flew towards Lu Ming, their faces full of surprise. Han man was the first to greet him with cupped fists.</p><p>“When did such a genius like brother Lu appear in the Empyrean heaven divine Palace? we didn’t even know about it. It seems like our information is too outdated.”</p><p>Mu Sen also cupped his hands and laughed.</p><p>Yao Xuan, on the other hand, looked at Lu Ming with curiosity and admiration.</p><p>The five powerful corpse guards were actually killed by Lu Ming in a few moves. If he had not seen it with his own eyes, it would have been unbelievable.</p><p>you’re welcome. Now, seal the soul!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Lu Ming took out the soul-sealing crystal and started to seal the corpse Guard’s soul.</p><p>Normally, a warrior’s soul would not dissipate for ten minutes after death. However, after ten minutes, the soul would dissipate and it would be difficult to seal it.</p><p>Lu Ming took out a piece of soul-sealing crystal and placed it on top of a corpse Guard’s corpse, injecting his essential core.</p><p>Complex runes appeared on the surface of the soul-sealing crystal, and then it produced a suction force that pulled out a black smoke from the corpse Guard’s body.</p><p>The smoke kept twisting, and its shape was very similar to that corpse guard. This was the soul of that corpse guard.</p><p>The soul of the corpse guard flew into the soul-sealing crystal, and a layer of black mist appeared on the surface of the soul-sealing crystal. The seal was successful.</p><p>Lu Ming kept it.</p><p>On the other side, han man and the others only sealed the soul of the corpse guard they had killed. They did not touch the other corpse guards that Lu Ming had killed.</p><p>Whoever killed him would have his soul. This was the rule.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stand on ceremony. He sealed the souls of the remaining three corpse guards one by one.</p><p>alright, now, let’s go take a look at the intent crystal pit!</p><p>There was a flash of anticipation in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>Intent crystals were what he desired.</p><p>Immediately, the five of them walked towards the depths of the scaled Demon tribe.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
