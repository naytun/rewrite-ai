The cave entrance behind him collapsed and was covered by the mud at the bottom of the lake. There was no way to see the entrance at all.</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming had rushed to the bottom of the lake to block the three-eyed creature’s vision with the lake water.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Not long after Lu Ming went to the bottom of the lake, the three-eyed creature arrived. It rushed to the bottom of the lake, causing huge waves.</p><p>However, when he rushed to the bottom of the lake, he did not find any trace of Lu Ming. He could not even sense a trace of his aura.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The three-eyed creature roared in anger. Its entire body emitted an energy that was completely different from true essence. It wreaked havoc at the bottom of the lake without any restraint. The water in the lake was stirred up, and countless members of the water race were killed. Their blood dyed the water red.</p><p>Under the ground, Lu Ming activated his essential core and spun the long spear, drilling down continuously.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Deafening rumbles came from above. Lu Ming knew that the three-eyed creature had arrived.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with him. He went down at full speed. He was very fast. Not long after, he had gone down a few hundred meters. He then changed his direction and went forward parallel to the ground.</p><p>After digging for a few hundred miles, he dug a cave underground. Lu Ming planned to stay there temporarily.</p><p>“Kid, my inscription formation is pretty good, right? hehe, now I’ll carve a formation around this cave. I guarantee that even if they search the entire Island, they won’t be able to find you.”</p><p>Dandan was extremely proud.</p><p>Then, he started to inscribe inscriptions around the cave.</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a long sigh of relief, frowning.</p><p>This time, it was a good thing that it wasn’t a spiritual ocean tier three-eyed creature chasing after him. Otherwise, he definitely wouldn’t be able to escape.</p><p>She had thought that she had seen hope of getting out, but now, she was in despair.</p><p>Also, how is Xuan Xiang? With her cultivation base, it was likely that she would be in grave danger if she landed on this deserted island.</p><p>“Grandmaster Xuan, it seems like I have to let you down!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming cast aside all other thoughts and circulated the true war Dragon technique to begin healing his injuries.</p><p>Earlier, he had exchanged a few blows with the flood Dragon’s corpse and had suffered some minor injuries.</p><p>About half an hour later, Lu Ming’s injuries had fully recovered.</p><p>“Kid, the inscription formation has been carved, you can rest assured!”</p><p>Dandan appeared on Lu Ming’s shoulder and said.</p><p>dandan, you said that you were familiar with these creatures. Think about it again. Do you have any clues? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Now, he could only place his hopes on the unreliable little turtle.</p><p>sigh, I was injured that year and had problems with my memory. I can’t remember much, but I vaguely remember that they were my enemies. The place I lived should be in this realm, the heaven realm!</p><p>Dandan frowned and pondered.</p><p>heaven realm, what kind of place is heaven realm? could it be a plane? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>of course not. I vaguely remember that the heaven realm should be a main world, and the world you’re in should be called the primordial realm, which is also a main world. The two worlds are twin worlds, and the two worlds complement each other!</p><p>“Heaven realm? The primordial realm? Twin world?” Lu Ming was confused.</p><p>“Could it be that the so-called Heaven’s Gate in my world is the gate that leads to this world?”</p><p>Lu Ming made a guess. He finally knew why dandan had spurted out from the Heaven’s Gate.</p><p>sigh, I don’t remember much either. Don’t ask me anymore. When I remember, I’ll naturally tell you. For now, you should hide here and cultivate!</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. This was the only way for now.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming entered the Supreme shrine. With a wave of his hand, a large pile of storage rings appeared beside him.</p><p>There were more than two hundred of them.</p><p>Lu Ming had not counted the storage rings that he had obtained during this period of time.</p><p>Since he had time now, he decided to take a look.</p><p>How many intent crystals could there be in so many storage rings? Lu Ming was filled with anticipation. He started to count them one by one.</p><p>This inventory took more than a day to sort out.</p><p>Lu Ming was completely dumbfounded.</p><p>There were too many intent crystals.</p><p>Lu Ming counted. There were a total of eighteen types of esoteric crystals. The total number was two hundred and thirty thousand pieces. In addition to the thirty thousand pieces he had previously, he had a total of two hundred and sixty thousand pieces.</p><p>Two hundred and sixty thousand intent crystals. What kind of concept was that?</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming realized that some people had very few esoteric crystals in their storage rings while others had a lot.</p><p>&Nbsp; this was normal. This Island couldn’t be filled with intent crystals everywhere. Some places had more, while others didn’t.</p><p>The area that Lu Ming had passed by previously was most likely more populated.</p><p>There were more than two hundred and sixty thousand pieces of esoteric crystals. Lu Ming estimated that more than half of the esoteric crystals on the entire Island had fallen into his pocket.</p><p>&Nbsp; among them, there were fifteen thousand wind, fire, and lightning intent crystals each.</p><p>He also had around twenty pieces of each of the three middle-grade intent crystals.</p><p>With so many esoteric crystals, it would be enough for Lu Ming to use for a period of time.</p><p>In addition, there were more than 10 million Supreme spiritual crystals.</p><p>During this period of time, many people’s mentalities had improved, and they must have refined many Supreme spiritual crystals. Otherwise, there would be more Supreme spiritual crystals.</p><p>As for the other things, there were even more, piling up like a mountain.</p><p>with so many intent crystals, I don’t have to worry about Wind and Fire intent. It won’t be a problem for me to cultivate it to the great circle of level one, but Thunder intent will be a problem.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and pondered.</p><p>The Thunder cauldron would devour the intent tendrils of the lightning-type profound meaning crystals every time. This was a huge headache for Lu Ming. Otherwise, with so many resources at his disposal, he could have become a peak-tier King in a short time.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming could only focus on comprehending the Thunder mentality. As long as he could comprehend the Thunder mentality, his cultivation would improve rapidly.</p><p>After that, his mind sank into his sea of consciousness and Lu Ming began to fully comprehend the Thunder concept.</p><p>Time flew by like the wind. In the blink of an eye, a month had passed.</p><p>In the past month, one could often hear rumbles coming from the ground. The three-eyed creatures hadn’t left.</p><p>In a month’s time, Lu Ming had been fully focused on comprehending the Thunder concept and his progress was terrifying.</p><p>He had cultivated for a month, which was equivalent to an ordinary person cultivating for nearly ten years.</p><p>After such a long period of time, Lu Ming managed to comprehend the Thunder concept to the peak of level one upper tier in one go.</p><p>He was only one step away from the great circle of the first rank.</p><p>However, this step was not so easy to break through.</p><p>Lu Ming stopped when he reached this point in his comprehension of the Thunder concept. He started to use the esoteric crystals to attack the Wind and Fire concepts.</p><p>Lu Ming directly used middle-grade profound meaning crystals.</p><p>&Nbsp; seven days later, he had used two middle-grade intent crystals each, and his Wind and Fire intents had also reached the great circle of level one.</p><p>now, I’ll start to improve my cultivation!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and a large number of top-grade spiritual crystals appeared. He began to use the top-grade spiritual crystals to improve his cultivation.</p><p>The amount of spiritual crystals required to reach Lv 7 martial King realm was even more terrifying. It would take 800000 pieces to reach the next level.</p><p>He had spent 2.4 million top-grade spiritual crystals to reach the peak of Lv 7 martial King realm, and another two million top-grade spiritual crystals to break through to Lv 8 martial King realm.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming continued to improve. The speed of his improvement was enough to scare other martial artists to death.</p><p>In half a month’s time, Lu Ming had used up all the best spiritual crystals he had. His cultivation had finally advanced to the peak of the LV 9 martial King realm.</p><p>He was only one step away from peak-tier King tier. This cultivation was no weaker than that of the Holy star.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
