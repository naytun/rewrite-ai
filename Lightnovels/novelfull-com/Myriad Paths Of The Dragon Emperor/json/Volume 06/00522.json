He fell to the ground and spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>Han man’s forward step stopped in the air, his face showing a horrified expression, and his whole body stiffened.</p><p>Mu Sen’s face was filled with shock.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming stood up slowly. His pale face had turned rosy. Vital essence filled his body and a powerful aura was exuded.</p><p>Han man’s eyes widened as if he had seen a ghost. He shouted, ” “How is that possible? You’ve clearly drunk a jar of wine and been poisoned by the ten fragrant tendon softening powder. Even a King tier at the upper tier would go soft if he were to consume the ten fragrant tendon softening powder. How are you still fine?”</p><p>Han man screamed in disbelief.</p><p>“I forgot to tell you that poison is ineffective Against Me!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently. His voice was extremely cold.</p><p>He had the bloodline of the nine Dragons, so he could devour any poison that entered his body.</p><p>Although the ten fragrant tendon softening powder was colorless, odorless, and hard to detect, the nine Dragon bloodline could sense it when Lu Ming took the first sip of the wine and immediately swallowed the ten fragrant tendon softening powder.</p><p>Lu Ming pretended not to know anything and deliberately finished the jar of wine. He wanted to see what han man and the rest were up to.</p><p>Han man and mu Sen’s bodies trembled slightly.</p><p>They had already witnessed Lu Ming’s combat strength against the people from the heavenly corpse sect. He was not someone they could fight against.</p><p>let’s go, let’s go quickly. Inform the Sheng family.</p><p>Han man roared and retreated at the same time.</p><p>On the other side, mu Sen was also retreating rapidly.</p><p>As for the forest, they couldn’t care less.</p><p>“It’s not that easy to leave. Die!”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A Lightning Spear light instantly crossed ten miles of void space and pierced through mu Sen’s chest.</p><p>He was killed in one move.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming cast the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps and chased after han man.</p><p>“No, no!”</p><p>Han man’s face changed. He waved his hand and a beam of light shot up into the sky.</p><p>This was a signal!</p><p>“Help, help!”</p><p>Han man shouted as he ran.</p><p>At this moment, he was almost scared out of his wits.</p><p>Usually, he had won the trust of many people by looking simple and honest. He had secretly harmed many people. He felt extremely refreshed when he saw those who had started to trust him die in front of him.</p><p>Now, when he saw that mu Sen had been killed, he felt a chill all over his body and was extremely frightened.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The nine Dragons heaven stomping steps was so fast that he caught up with han man in an instant.</p><p>“No, don’t kill me, don’t kill me, help!”</p><p>Han man shouted hysterically and ran for his life.</p><p>However, it was all in vain.</p><p>The terrifying Lightning Spear pierced through the air and blasted a huge hole in han man’s chest.</p><p>“No, no, I don’t want to die. Save me, save me!”</p><p>Looking at the huge hole in his chest, han man was still alive, and he screamed in fear.</p><p>His eyes were filled with regret.</p><p>If he had known that this would happen, he would never have agreed to the Sheng family to deal with Lu Ming.</p><p>Unfortunately, there was no medicine for regret in this world.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at him coldly.</p><p>haha, Lu Ming, you’ve offended the Sheng family. You won’t be able to live. You’ll have to come down and accompany me sooner or later. I’ll be waiting for you down there!</p><p>Seeing that he was not going to live, han man cursed madly.</p><p>Then, his life force dissipated, and his body fell to the ground.</p><p>Lu Ming’s vital essence rolled up and han man’s storage ring was taken. Then, the devouring power burst out and devoured han man’s blood essence.</p><p>In a flash, he appeared beside Mu Lin.</p><p>As Mulin screamed in fear, he was stabbed to death.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At this time, a violent rumbling sound came from the distance. It was the sound of sonic booms caused by the martial artists flying too fast.</p><p>Some people had come, and there were quite a few of them, dozens of them.</p><p>All of them were experts. There were five or six auras that were unfathomably deep and incomparably thick.</p><p>the people from the Sheng clan came pretty quickly. Moreover, there are actually five lower tier King tiers!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and his figure flashed. He took mu Sen’s blood essence and storage ring.</p><p>“Save me, save me!”</p><p>Yao Xuan called out.</p><p>Lu Min’s expression changed and she appeared beside Yao Xuan. She hugged her waist and flew into the sky, flying into the distance.</p><p>Yao Xuan was implicated because of him. It was not Lu Ming’s style to leave her behind.</p><p>damn it, it’s Lu Ming, han man, and the rest of the trash. They can’t even do such a thing. Chase after him and kill him!</p><p>A furious roar sounded.</p><p>“Chase!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>There were at least twenty people who were chasing after Lu Ming at high speed.</p><p>Saint air, Saint might, Saint wind, and Saint River!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed and he saw a few familiar faces in the crowd.</p><p>“I won’t play with you guys now, but once my cultivation improves, I won’t let any of you off!”</p><p>Lu Ming snorted coldly and immediately cast the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps.</p><p>With the nine Dragons heaven treading steps, his speed was unbelievably fast, and he could fly a hundred miles in an instant.</p><p>A moment later, the people from the Sheng family had been left behind by Lu Ming and disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop. He continued to fly for about one hundred thousand miles before he found an extremely hidden underground cave and entered it.</p><p>The people from the Sheng family stopped a hundred thousand miles away from Lu Ming.</p><p>The one leading them was Saint Jade.</p><p>At this moment, shengyu’s face was extremely ugly. He roared, ” “Search. We must find Lu Ming, this b * stard.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Immediately, the twenty-odd geniuses of the Sheng family split into five teams. Each team was led by a lower tier King. They scattered and continued to pursue.</p><p>……</p><p>Lu Ming carried Yao Xuan and entered an underground cave.</p><p>“Lu … Brother, let me down!”</p><p>Yao Xuan called out softly.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and put Yao Xuan down gently.</p><p>“Cough, cough, miss Yao Xuan, the effects of the ten fragrant tendon softening powder will wear off in three days. You can stay here for now and leave on your own three days later!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“You … Where do you want to go?”</p><p>Yao Xuan asked.</p><p>“Me? Of course, I’m looking for the Sheng family’s trash.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled coldly.</p><p>“Find the Sheng family?”</p><p>Yao Xuan exclaimed in shock. Lu Ming actually dared to look for the Sheng family? Now, shouldn’t they be avoiding the Sheng family?</p><p>She could not figure it out.</p><p>“Miss Yao, farewell!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and left the underground cave. He appeared on an ancient tree.</p><p>After a moment, Lu Ming had an idea and appeared in the Supreme shrine.</p><p>I don’t know how many spiritual crystals there are. It should be enough for me to break through to the third level of the martial King realm!</p><p>Lu Ming took out the storage rings of han man and the other two and muttered to himself.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
