Lu Ming flew for three days in a row, covering a distance of several million miles.</p><p>...</p><p>Along the way, Lu Ming did not find any esoteric crystal vein that could be excavated.</p><p>Although this piece of land was extremely rich in ultimacy crystals, there was a limit to it. Some areas had more, while some areas had less. Along the way, Lu Ming noticed that there were many traces of digging. It was obvious that they had been dug away.</p><p>In the process of flying, Lu Ming transformed the blood essence of the Thunder Palace Master into the power of the blood Meridian.</p><p>Although the blood essence of a Lv 9 martial King was extremely powerful, it still couldn’t make the nine Dragon bloodline break through to the eighth level of the king realm.</p><p>The amount of blood essence required for the advancement of his Blood Meridian was getting more and more terrifying. Therefore, the blood essence that Lu Ming devoured was not used to improve his cultivation but to improve his Blood Meridian.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming felt a salty and wet wind blowing. He was stunned and sped up.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>In front of them, a series of rumbling sounds could be heard, as if huge waves were sweeping across the sky. At the same time, the salty and wet wind became stronger.</p><p>As Lu Ming flew, the rumbling sounds became more intense and deafening.</p><p>Not long after …</p><p>“Could this be the ocean?”</p><p>Lu Ming stood on a cliff and looked into the distance. He was dumbfounded.</p><p>In front of him was an endless ocean with huge waves that were extremely violent.</p><p>The lowest waves could reach a height of hundreds of meters, and the higher waves could even reach more than a thousand meters.</p><p>In the sky, dark clouds gathered, Thunder rumbled, and the wind howled. It was a scene of doomsday.</p><p>“Is this really the ocean?”</p><p>Lu Ming had never seen the sea since he was young. He had heard of it but he had never heard of it being so violent.</p><p>Even martial arts powerhouses would not be able to stand in this ocean, let alone ordinary people.</p><p>Lu Ming looked around for a while. Occasionally, he could see the figures of huge sea beasts in the sea.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He looked around for a while and then flew at high speed along the coastline.</p><p>However, the ocean they saw along the way was the same. They were all violent.</p><p>Lu Ming flew for three days and the results were the same.</p><p>“This coastline is round. Could it be an Island?”</p><p>Lu Ming speculated.</p><p>“Lu Ming, based on my experience, this should be an Island. You’re all tied to the same Island.”</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>“An Island. Then if we rush out of the island, we might be able to see the others. Maybe we can find our way back.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he flew toward the sea.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The raging waves slapped the shore and the strong wind swept across. Lu Ming’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>He realized that the strong winds on the sea were extremely terrifying. They were like divine weapons that kept slashing at Lu Ming. Lu Ming had used his vital essence to protect himself, but his vital essence was being depleted.</p><p>At this rate, Lu Ming’s essential core would be depleted before he could fly far.</p><p>Lu Ming had no choice but to fly back to the shore.</p><p>“I don’t believe that the ocean around us is this violent.”</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth and continued flying along the coastline.</p><p>Ten days. Lu Ming had flown for a full ten days. He estimated that he had circled half the island, but the ocean he saw was the same. It was extremely violent. This made Lu Ming rather speechless.</p><p>Lu Ming was a little anxious. There were still two and a half months before Mu Lan’s wedding, but he had yet to find the way out.</p><p>“Lu Ming, all you can do now is cultivate in peace. Perhaps one day, an outsider will come to this Island, and you’ll be able to leave.”</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>“I can only do this!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>No matter what, it was best to hint at his strength.</p><p>Moreover, with his current cultivation, even if he could go out, he wouldn’t be a match for the sacred constellation. Only by increasing his strength and going out by chance would he be able to fight the sacred constellation.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming stopped at the seaside and entered the Supreme shrine to comprehend the Thunder concept in peace.</p><p>Lu Ming’s Thunder will had already reached the limit of level one lower tier. After another five days, Lu Ming’s Thunder will had a breakthrough and reached level one upper tier.</p><p>This was a threshold. The intent realm of level one upper tier was the symbol of a King tier who had reached the upper tier.</p><p>first level complete Thunder intent. Now, I’ll use intent crystals to upgrade the other two intents!</p><p>Lu Ming first took out a middle-grade wind-type esoteric crystal.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming was rich and generous, he planned to break through with middle-grade profound meaning crystals.</p><p>He crushed the middle-grade wind-type ultimacy crystal and closed his eyes to cultivate.</p><p>Two days later, Lu Ming opened his eyes. Strong winds were howling around him, forming wind blades.</p><p>Level one wind concept was complete.</p><p>Moreover, it was at the middle stage of the first level upper tier.</p><p>The effects of middle-grade intent crystals were simply too powerful.</p><p>Normally speaking, middle-rank intent crystals were used by sea of soul realm experts to cultivate and comprehend level two intent domains of heaven and earth. Naturally, it would have a great effect on level one intent domains of heaven and earth.</p><p>This was also the reason why Lu Ming had the path-understanding ancient tree. If an ordinary person used a middle-grade profound meaning crystal at the martial King realm, they would probably waste 70 – 80% of the middle-grade profound meaning crystal. No one would be so wasteful.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had the path-understanding ancient tree, so he had only wasted ten to twenty percent of it.</p><p>now, it’s the fire concept!</p><p>Lu Ming took out a middle-grade fire-type ultimacy crystal, crushed it, and began to comprehend it.</p><p>Two days later, his fire concept had also broken through to the middle stage of level one upper tier.</p><p>The completion of three types of concepts had caused the power of Lu Ming’s three types of concepts to reach a terrifying level. It had completely surpassed the peak of a single concept.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming could now aim for the level of a King tier.</p><p>“A late stage King tier!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with anticipation.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, a pile of top-grade spiritual crystals appeared. There were a total of 200000 pieces.</p><p>With a shake of vital essence, all the Supreme-grade spirit crystals exploded. The nine Dragon bloodline opened its mouth and absorbed all the energy of these spirit crystals.</p><p>Very soon, two hundred thousand pieces of top-grade spirit crystals were refined and Lu Ming took out another two hundred thousand pieces.</p><p>The vital essence in Lu Ming’s body was getting more and more vigorous and powerful. It was about to break through to the seventh level of the martial King realm.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The true essence in his body exploded like the ocean outside.</p><p>“Not enough, it’s still not enough!”</p><p>When Lu Ming had refined 1.4 million pieces of top-grade spirit crystals, he realized that he was still lacking a lot.</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth and exploded 600000 pieces of top-grade spirit crystals in one go. He devoured all of them and began to break through.</p><p>Three days passed by in a flash.</p><p>Three days later, Lu Ming suddenly let out a long howl. A terrifying aura burst out from his body and soared into the sky.</p><p>If they were not in the Supreme shrine, they would probably be able to stir up the wind and clouds in the sky.</p><p>I’ve finally broken through to the seventh level of the martial King realm!</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily.</p><p>Now, he was finally standing on the same level as the Holy star realm.</p><p>Of course, he had already reached the peak of Lv 9 martial King a few months ago on the Holy star. He was only one step away from the peak of King tier and could break through at any time.</p><p>Lu Ming was still under a lot of pressure.</p><p>But at least it was approaching quickly.</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming left the Supreme shrine and appeared at the seaside.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fist in the air and a long spear was condensed. He then whipped the spear at the vast sea.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
