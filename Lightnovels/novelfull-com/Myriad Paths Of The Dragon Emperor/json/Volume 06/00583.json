Furthermore, feixue and the rest did not seem like Qin qingfei. They seemed easy to get along with. Hence, Lu Ming had the intention to befriend them.</p><p>Fei Xue took the token and looked at it. She was surprised.</p><p>“You really are the Ditian Divine Guard from the Tianxuan region!”</p><p>Even though Fei Xue was extremely surprised, the information recorded in the divine Guard token was irrefutable.</p><p>The token of the divine Guard was made in a special way, and it was extremely difficult for outsiders to imitate.</p><p>The other women were also extremely surprised. They didn’t expect that the Ditian divine guards of the Tianxuan region would appear here.</p><p>“They’re actually Ditian divine guards from another region. I’ve never seen anyone from another region in my entire life.”</p><p>“Is the Tianxuan region fun? Was it the same as the great domain? He looks similar to us, and he’s quite handsome!”</p><p>“Hehe, are you infatuated again? you can’t move when you see a beautiful man?”</p><p>……</p><p>More than ten young and beautiful women surrounded Lu Ming and chattered. More than ten pairs of beautiful eyes surrounded Lu Ming and sized him up as if they were looking at a rare animal.</p><p>Lu Ming was a little speechless. He smiled bitterly and touched his nose.</p><p>alright, don’t look at brother Lu like that. We’re all girls. Don’t be afraid of brother Lu making fun of us.</p><p>Fei Xue said awkwardly. The girls then backed away, but their beautiful eyes were still darting around Lu Ming.</p><p>“Brother Lu, since we’re here by chance, why don’t we head to Hong city and take a look?”</p><p>Fei Xue looked at Lu Ming, her beautiful eyes filled with curiosity.</p><p>Of course, she knew about the Tianxuan region. It was a small region that was far inferior to the great domain. However, it was obvious that Qin qingfei had suffered a great loss at the hands of Lu Ming.</p><p>A person who came from the Tianxuan region could easily defeat Qin qingfei. He was definitely not an ordinary person. It was very likely that he was one of the top geniuses in the Tianxuan region. She also wanted to make friends with him.</p><p>After all, one more friend meant one more path.</p><p>“Miss flying snow, may I know where the Emperor heaven divine Palace branch in the Hong domain is? I have something important to do and need to rush back to the Tianxuan region. I need to use the inter-province transportation formation.”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>The Empyrean heaven divine Palace had an inter-domain teleportation array in every sub-Palace of a large region. The profound sky sub-Palace also had one, and it was located in the profound Sky City.</p><p>After all, each region was too vast. If They Flew Alone, it would take a long time.</p><p>It was much more convenient with the teleportation formation.</p><p>“Brother Lu wants to use the inter-province transportation array. It just so happens that Hong city is a branch Palace of the Emperor heaven divine Palace in the Hong domain. The inter-province transportation array is located in Hong city and it’s three days ‘journey from here to Hong city. Brother Lu just so happens to be going to Hong city with us. I’ll help you arrange the matter of the inter-province transportation array!”</p><p>Fei Xue said.</p><p>then, thank you very much, lady flying snow!</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He cupped his fists to express his gratitude.</p><p>however, brother Lu just injured Qin qingfei. This person is narrow-minded and definitely won’t let this matter rest. It’s best not to bump into him on this trip. Otherwise, I’m afraid it will cause trouble for nothing.</p><p>Fei Xue reminded.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming followed flying snow and the rest and flew towards Hong city.</p><p>Three days later, they arrived at Hong city.</p><p>Hong city was where the branch Palace of Hong domain was located. It was a Grand and magnificent place.</p><p>He saw eight huge mountains piercing through the clouds like divine swords.</p><p>The eight peaks were in eight different locations, separated by thousands of miles.</p><p>And the vast territory in the middle of the eight peaks was Hong city.</p><p>Some of the city walls around great city were directly made of eight mountains. The city walls were only cultivated in the areas between the mountains.</p><p>It was huge. This was the largest city Lu Ming had ever seen. It was like a country.</p><p>One city was one country.</p><p>Following Fei Xue and the rest, they easily entered Hong city.</p><p>the spiritual Qi of heaven and earth is so dense. Moreover, the will of heaven and earth is also extremely strong.</p><p>Lu Ming was a little surprised when he entered great city.</p><p>“Brother Lu, beneath great city itself is a Dao eye. As for the spiritual Qi of the heavens and earth, it’s because the Almighties of the Emperor heaven divine Palace used those eight mountain peaks as the foundation of the formation and set up a huge spirit gathering formation. That’s why the spiritual Qi is so dense.”</p><p>Fei Xue introduced.</p><p>Lu Ming was amazed. The mighty people of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace were really generous. They had actually used eight mountains as the base of the formation to set up a spirit gathering formation. How huge was this inscription formation?</p><p>In grand city, the density and intensity of the spiritual energy and essence realm of heaven and earth were not as high as in Tianxuan city.</p><p>However, Tianxuan city was too small. Its area was only one-thousandth of Hong city’s.</p><p>The streets of Hong city were bustling with people and all kinds of shops were available.</p><p>“Brother Lu, why don’t you stay at this Inn for the night? I’ll go and arrange for the inter-province transportation formation.”</p><p>After walking around for a while, Fei Xue said to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll have to trouble lady flying snow.”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Inter-province transportation formations were very important and had strict rules.</p><p>One’s identity had to be thoroughly investigated. Usually, people outside the Empyrean heaven divine Palace were not allowed to use it.</p><p>The inter-province transportation formation was the lifeline of a force. During a Great War, it could quickly gather high-level Warriors. Otherwise, it would be too late to fly.</p><p>Therefore, one had to make a reservation in advance. It was impossible for one to use it whenever one wanted to.</p><p>Lu Ming was also clear about this.</p><p>alright then. Brother Lu, keep this Jade voice transmission talisman. If you need anything, you can find me at any time. I’ll give you a day at most. Brother Lu should be able to set off tomorrow.</p><p>Fei Xue passed a voice transmission jade talisman to Lu Ming, who accepted it and kept it.</p><p>Following that, Fei Xue and the rest left first. Lu Ming had rented a room at an Inn nearby. Then, he started to stroll around Hong city alone.</p><p>Since he had come to the great domain by chance, it would be good for him to take a stroll and broaden his horizons.</p><p>There were indeed many strange things in great city that he had never seen in Tianxuan region.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were dazzled and he bought some strange materials.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming did not have many spiritual crystals left. The ones he bought were cheap.</p><p>go get some spiritual crystals. Otherwise, you won’t even have the money to take the inter-province transportation formation.</p><p>Previously, he had used up all his spirit stones to break through to the next realm. Now, Lu Ming only had tens of thousands of top-grade spirit crystals.</p><p>After asking around for the location of the market, Lu Ming walked towards it.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming arrived at the city square of great city. He found a shop called the myriad Pavilion and entered it.</p><p>Lu Ming sold some of the unused spirit weapons, refining materials, and some martial arts techniques below the heaven level. He obtained about eight hundred thousand top-grade spirit crystals.</p><p>800,000 Supreme spiritual crystals should be enough to pay for the inter-province transportation formation.</p><p>He wandered around for a while more before he returned to the inn.</p><p>The night passed uneventfully. At noon the next day, Fei Xue came to look for Lu Ming.</p><p>brother Lu, I’ve already reserved the quota for the inter-province transportation formation for you. You can set off immediately!</p><p>Fei Xue smiled.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. It seemed that feixue was quite influential in the great domain branch Palace since she was able to book a spot in the inter-province transportation formation so quickly.</p><p>thank you, aunty flying snow. If there’s anything that I can help with in the future, I’ll definitely not decline!</p><p>Lu Ming expressed his thanks.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
