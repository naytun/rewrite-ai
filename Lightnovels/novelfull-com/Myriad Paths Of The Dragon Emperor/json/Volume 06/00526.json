He and the blade seemed to merge into one, turning into a terrifying blade light. It pierced through the void and appeared in front of Lu Ming, slashing down at his head.</p><p>Lu Ming used his long spear to block the attack from above.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The demon subduing spear began to move rapidly. Lu Ming felt a terrifying force crash into the demon subduing spear, causing it to vibrate rapidly. The terrifying force numbed Lu Ming’s arms and he could not hold the demon subduing spear.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The demon subduing spear was sent flying.</p><p>The Saint Jade’s blade light continued to slash at Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared. His eyes were bloodshot as he unleashed all his strength.</p><p>His left hand contained the devouring power of the nine Dragons bloodline, and his right hand contained the power of the second bloodline. At the same time, the three wills were integrated into his hands.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming clasped his hands and caught Saint Jade’s saber.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The terrifying force sent Lu Ming plummeting to the ground.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming stepped on the ground, and the earth gave out a violent roar. The ground was like a wave, shaking violently. Within a radius of five miles, it was swept by the wind storm and leveled.</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm was still gripping Saint Jade’s saber.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The Saint Jade roared and the saber radiance expanded. The saber carried a terrifying power and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>??…</p><p>Lu Ming’s palms clamped the saber and it actually emitted a sizzling sound and four-colored sparks.</p><p>Unfortunately, he could not catch it in the end. The saber was still slashing toward Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>“Am I going to die Here?”</p><p>Lu Ming had a thought.</p><p>“No, no, I can’t die!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared in his heart.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s glabella suddenly shone with rays of light and traces of lightning swam around.</p><p>“This is … The lightning cauldron!”</p><p>Lu Ming had a thought.</p><p>Ever since Lu Ming had obtained the lightning cauldron, it had been lying dormant in his consciousness. There was no movement at all.</p><p>Now, at the moment when Lu Ming was facing life and death, the lightning cauldron finally moved.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming seemed to be able to communicate with the lightning cauldron. A wisp of his mind seemed to be connected with the lightning cauldron. He could control the lightning cauldron at any time and launch a fatal attack.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Without any hesitation, Lu Ming controlled the lightning cauldron and blasted it outward.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In his sea of consciousness, the Thunder cauldron let out a sound as if the world was being split open. Then, it flew out.</p><p>At the same time, a terrifying suction force erupted from the lightning cauldron. At that moment, Lu Ming’s true vitality and essence energy were all absorbed by the lightning cauldron.</p><p>Other than his essential core and essence, Lu Ming even felt that a portion of his life essence had been absorbed by the lightning cauldron.</p><p>Life essence represented lifespan.</p><p>In other words, even Lu Ming’s life force had been absorbed by the lightning cauldron.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>After absorbing Lu Ming’s essential core, essence, and life essence, the lightning cauldron flew out from the space between his eyebrows.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Saint Jade’s saber was turned into ashes by the Thunder cauldron. Saint Jade was shaken and spat out blood. She was sent flying thousands of meters.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The lightning cauldron flew into the sky and became as big as a mountain. Thunder rumbled, and it was like the might of the heavens.</p><p>Then, the Thunder cauldron pressed down. Endless lightning enveloped all the disciples of the Sheng family.</p><p>“Run, run, run!”</p><p>The Saint Jade roared and ran away desperately.</p><p>“Run, run!”</p><p>Sheng Kong and the others did the same. They ran away with all their might.</p><p>At this moment, they were extremely terrified.</p><p>Never in their wildest dreams would they have thought that such a terrifying lightning cauldron would suddenly appear in Lu Ming’s body. They felt as if they were ants in front of this lightning cauldron. No, they were not even ants. They were as insignificant as dust.</p><p>At this moment, they were extremely frightened. They only had one thought in their minds, and that was to escape.</p><p>&Nbsp; the next moment, the lightning cauldron pressed down, and thick bolts of lightning began to wantonly dance about.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>After a breath’s time, the lightning cauldron shrunk rapidly and flew back to Lu Ming’s glabella, disappearing.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming felt extremely weak. His body was empty, without even a trace of essential core. He had lost a lot of essence energy and his body was extremely weak.</p><p>He couldn’t even fly up, and he fell to the ground.</p><p>this lightning cauldron is too terrifying. Not only does it extract true Yuan and normal spiritual essence, but it also extracts life essence.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly.</p><p>A King had a thousand years of life. However, Lu Ming felt that he had lost fifty years of his life just now.</p><p>50 years of life was a huge loss.</p><p>huh? a wisp of my consciousness seems to be connected to the lightning cauldron.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>He realized that a wisp of his consciousness could be connected to the lightning cauldron. In other words, Lu Ming could control the lightning cauldron and launch an attack if he wanted to.</p><p>However, the next moment, Lu Ming shook his head with a bitter smile.</p><p>Controlling the lightning cauldron to attack? what a joke.</p><p>Putting aside the fact that one attack from the lightning cauldron could drain all of his true Yuan and essence Qi, he would be completely weakened and at the mercy of others.</p><p>Furthermore, he had lost fifty years of his life at once. Even if Lu Ming was a King, he would not be able to use it many times before his life was exhausted and he died.</p><p>this lightning cauldron can not be used unless it is absolutely necessary. However, it can be considered as an additional life-saving method.</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the sound of something breaking through the air was heard, and dandan flew back.</p><p>Dandan was indeed amazing. Just now, he was also under the cover of the lightning cauldron, but nothing happened to him.</p><p>dandan, take me to see if the Sheng family is dead!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>At this moment, he was so weak that he could not even walk.</p><p>Dandan’s entire body emitted a faint light, and it trembled slightly. Then, it rapidly grew to the size of a water tank.</p><p>Lu Ming lay on dandan, and dandan carried Lu Ming and flew in all directions.</p><p>Within a radius of ten miles, it was a complete mess, with traces of being struck by lightning everywhere.</p><p>On the messy ground, there were corpses.</p><p>The remaining youths of the Sheng family had all been killed by the lightning cauldron.</p><p>In a place, Lu Ming saw the body of the sacred sky.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly saw a figure at the edge of the lightning coverage, crawling forward desperately.</p><p>The figure was in tatters and all his hair had been cut off by the lightning. However, Lu Ming could tell at a glance that it was a Saint Jade.</p><p>When the lightning cauldron flew out of Lu Ming’s glabella, the Saint Jade was knocked thousands of meters away. It then fled frantically, almost escaping the area covered by the lightning cauldron.</p><p>Therefore, he suffered the least damage and didn’t die for a while.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
