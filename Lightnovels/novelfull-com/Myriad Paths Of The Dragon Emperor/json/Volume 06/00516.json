They should be people who could cooperate. Therefore, Lu Ming agreed.</p><p>...</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming had agreed, han man was overjoyed. that’s great! Brother Lu, let me introduce you!</p><p>Han man immediately introduced.</p><p>Han man himself was a late Lv 3 martial King.</p><p>Yao Xuan, peak Lv 2 martial King realm.</p><p>The other two young men were really a pair of brothers. Their names were Mu Lin and mu Sen.</p><p>One of them was at the early stage of the LV 3 martial King realm, while the other was at the peak of the LV 2 martial King realm.</p><p>Everyone’s artistic conception was different. Some were good at defense, some were good at attacking and killing.</p><p>“Alright, everyone’s here. Let’s go!”</p><p>Han man said.</p><p>Immediately, the group of five walked towards the huge wall.</p><p>Under the high wall, there was a huge stone door. The five of them walked out of the stone door, and beyond the high wall was a vast mountain.</p><p>&Nbsp; ” the areas around the gathering point have all been explored, and all the treasures and intent crystals have been plundered. We can only go to a wider area to find some opportunities and treasures! Zhao Feng said.</p><p>however, the bigger the place, the more treasures there are, but it also means that it is more dangerous. That’s because there are a large number of scaled demon race members that haven’t been exterminated. What are your thoughts? ”</p><p>Han man asked everyone.</p><p>“We have no objections!</p><p>The two brothers Mu Lin and mu Sen nodded.</p><p>“I don’t have any objections even if I win!”</p><p>Yao Xuan said timidly.</p><p>“I have no objections either!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>alright, let’s set off. It would be best if we could encounter a small scaled Demon tribe. We would be rich then!</p><p>Han man’s eyes lit up.</p><p>According to his experience during this period of time, there would usually be a pit of profound meaning crystals in the scaled demon race’s tribe where one could dig out some of the profound meaning crystals.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The five of them rose into the air and headed deep into the demonic scales dimension.</p><p>The demonic scales dimension was extremely huge. It was definitely one of the top small dimensions and could even be considered a medium dimension.</p><p>It was so vast that it could be described as boundless.</p><p>The Empyrean Heavenly Divine Palace and the heavenly corpse sect had already discovered the scaled demon dimension for a few months, but they had yet to explore its borders. In fact, there was still a large area that they had yet to explore.</p><p>The five of them continued to fly, and after a day, they had already flown close to a million miles.</p><p>When they arrived here, their speed slowed down. This was because there were fewer people from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace investigating this place, and the danger level was also higher.</p><p>“Look, that’s the Black Forest grass!”</p><p>Suddenly, Mu Lin pointed at a mountain peak in front of them and shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming looked over. Indeed, he saw a patch of black spiritual herbs on the cliff of the mountain.</p><p>There were about a dozen of them, and they were like black jade, shining with light.</p><p>It was the Black Forest grass, a medium Lv 5 spiritual herb, which was very expensive.</p><p>hahaha, I didn’t expect to see more than a dozen medium Lv 5 spiritual herbs as soon as we came in. We’re so lucky!</p><p>Han man said with a smile.</p><p>Lu Ming also sighed in his heart.</p><p>As expected of a newly discovered plane, it was rich in resources. If it was outside, Level 5 spiritual herbs were extremely rare.</p><p>It was very difficult to find level 5 spiritual herbs in the wild, and they had all been picked by people.</p><p>Some of them were artificially cultivated, or they could only appear in some deep mountains, lakes, or dangerous places.</p><p>There were also some secret realms and planes.</p><p>“Let’s pick them and split them equally!”</p><p>Han man said.</p><p>The five of them flew towards the cliff, and with a sweep of their Zhen Yuan, they plucked all the black grass from the ground.</p><p>we’re so lucky. There are exactly 15 stalks. We’ll each take five stalks!</p><p>Han man said with a smile.</p><p>After that, each of them took five of them, and all of them revealed a smile.</p><p>“Let’s take a look around and see if there are any other spiritual herbs!”</p><p>Han man suggested.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Everyone nodded in agreement and immediately began searching the nearby mountains.</p><p>Lu Ming also rushed into a mountain peak alone and swept his gaze around.</p><p>“Eh? Could this be a thousand-year violet mushroom?”</p><p>Lu Ming found a purple mushroom under an ancient tree. Rich spirit Qi essence was exuding from the mushroom.</p><p>The strength of the spiritual energy essence was even stronger than the Black Forest grass.</p><p>It was a spiritual herb of upper Lv 5, one level higher than the Black Forest grass.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed as he kept it.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current physical body had already reached complete grade six. If he wanted to make a breakthrough, level five spiritual herbs were almost useless. He needed level six spiritual herbs.</p><p>Although the level 5 spiritual medicine could not help Lu Ming to break through, it was very expensive to sell. The more such things, the better.</p><p>Lu Ming was in high spirits and was about to continue his search.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>On a mountain peak not far away, a violent boom suddenly erupted.</p><p>“Scaled demon race!”</p><p>A loud roar came from Mu Lin.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved and he rushed in that direction.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>From a mountain peak, a figure rushed out in a sorry state. Behind him, more than a dozen burly figures, more than two meters tall, were chasing him.</p><p>These figures looked very strange. Their facial features were similar to that of humans, but they were covered in pitch-black scales that covered their bodies like armor.</p><p>This was the scaled demon race.</p><p>Waa! Waa!</p><p>These scaled demons were shouting and shouting. No one could understand what they were shouting about. They were waving their battle axes and iron rods toward the forest.</p><p>One was equivalent to the peak of the second level of the martial King realm, three were equivalent to the early stage of the second level, two were equivalent to the first level of the martial King realm, and the rest were all half-step King Warriors.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>&Nbsp; no wonder Mu Lin had to flee. His cultivation was only at the peak Lv 2 martial King realm. He was no match for so many scaled demons.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming rushed over directly.</p><p>Wahhhhh!</p><p>One of the early Lv 2 martial King realm scaled demons bellowed and charged at Lu Ming with his battle axe.</p><p>The battleaxe was swung out with a terrifying force.</p><p>The physical strength of this kind of scaled demon race was extremely terrifying, and it had a strange power that was similar to true Yuan yet different.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear shook, turned into a flash of lightning, and shot out.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>This scaled demon’s forehead was pierced through.</p><p>The scaled demon race member roared and fell to the ground.</p><p>“Such hard scales!” Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>Even the face of the scaled demons was covered in scales. They were extremely hard. Lu Ming felt a great resistance when he thrust his spear.</p><p>At this time, han man, mu Sen, and Yao Xuan had also arrived and were attacking the scaled demons.</p><p>Han man was at the peak Lv 3 martial King realm, so his combat strength was extremely powerful. The peak Lv 2 martial King realm scaled demon was completely suppressed by him and was killed by han man after a few moves.</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear thrust forward and turned into a spear ray.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>&Nbsp; five to six scaled demons were pierced by the spear light and fell to the ground.</p><p>&Nbsp; it didn’t take long for them to all be killed.</p><p>according to our past experiences, these ten or so scaled demons should be a hunting team from a scaled Demon tribe. They came out to hunt and just happened to run into us!</p><p>Han man said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
