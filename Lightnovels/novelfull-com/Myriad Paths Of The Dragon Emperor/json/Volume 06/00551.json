The geniuses of our weapon forging sect are so much weaker than you.”</p><p>...</p><p>Xuan Xiang’s eyes were burning as she looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Cough cough!”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little embarrassed from being stared at. He coughed a few times and then came to his senses.”You’re from the weapon forging sect?”</p><p>“That’s right, my father is the sect master of the weapon forging sect.”</p><p>Xuan Xiang did not have any ulterior motives and said it directly. She stared at Lu Ming with a very curious gaze.</p><p>“Ahem, miss, please pay attention to your manners!”</p><p>The burly man on the side reminded.</p><p>“Notice what? Lord Lu Ming is one of us.”</p><p>Xuan Xiang laughed.</p><p>Lu Ming also smiled. This Xuan Xiang was obviously a young lady without any experience and no scheming.</p><p>“Miss xuanxiang, everyone, I’m not happy with what you’re saying. I’m also heading to the weapon forging sect to look for your sect master!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“You’re going to the weapon forging sect to look for my father? That’s just right, let’s go together.”</p><p>Xuan Xiang’s eyes brightened as she said with great joy.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>The others were overjoyed as well. With such a powerful existence like Lu Ming with them, they would not have to fear the people from the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>After that, the group of people set off together and headed north.</p><p>“Lord Lu Ming, you’re really amazing. You’re so young and you’re already so powerful. How did you cultivate?”</p><p>“Lord Lu Ming, you’re so powerful. What’s your ranking among the Ditian divine guards? How many more formidable geniuses like you are in the Ditian Divine Guard?”</p><p>“Lu Ming, do you have a girlfriend? How about I introduce you to someone? I’ll just introduce myself. Hehe, I’m just joking!”</p><p>“Lord Lu Ming, I’ve heard that Saint Xingchen is the number one genius in the Tianxuan region and a proud Son of Heaven on the list of top 1000 talents. How does Lord Lu Ming compare to Saint Xingchen? Has Lord Lu Ming seen him before?”</p><p>……</p><p>Along the way, Xuan Xiang followed Lu Ming and asked him questions non-stop.</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but smile bitterly. He cast a pleading look at the others at the side.</p><p>However, they all showed an expression of helplessly wanting to help, turning their heads and pretending not to see.</p><p>Lu Ming felt a huge headache.</p><p>After flying for a few hundred miles, Xuan Xiang had asked at least a few dozen questions.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s reinforcements arrived.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>In front of them, there were more than 50 people flying towards them at an extremely fast speed. Each of them had a strong Qi, and they were obviously experts.</p><p>The leader of the group was a young man in a white robe.</p><p>“It’s Xuan Zhong!”</p><p>A burly man on the side said.</p><p>Soon, more than fifty people arrived.</p><p>“Xiang Xiang, are you alright?”</p><p>As soon as the young man in the lead arrived, he looked at Xuan Xiang with concern and asked.</p><p>Hmph, it’d be a wonder if we’re fine. If we were relying on you guys, we would’ve been dead long ago. You’re so late!</p><p>Xuan Xiang’s lips curled up and she snorted.</p><p>“You guys ran into the people from the heavenly corpse sect?” Xuan Zhong’s expression changed.</p><p>nonsense! Of course we met. If it wasn’t for Lord Lu Ming, you wouldn’t have been able to see me. Let me introduce you. This is Lord Lu Ming, the Ditian Divine Guard.</p><p>Lord Lu Ming is a peerless genius. Those corpse guards were killed by Lord Lu Ming in a few moves. This is the first time I’ve seen such a powerful genius!</p><p>Xuan Xiang stood beside Lu Ming and introduced him to everyone with a look of admiration.</p><p>However, he didn’t see the cold glint in Xuan Zhong’s eyes.</p><p>“Ditian divine guards? Don’t be deceived by him. Perhaps he’s the heavenly corpse sect’s member who’s intentionally trying to get close to you. You also know that the heavenly corpse sect’s members have been appearing more and more frequently around the weapon forging sect recently.”</p><p>Xuan Zhong cast an unfriendly glance at Lu Ming and said coldly.</p><p>“You’re talking nonsense. Lord Lu Ming is so powerful, so he must be a genius among the Ditian divine guards. Moreover, he killed so many corpse guards in a few moves. If he’s from the heavenly corpse sect, why would he kill so many corpse guards?”</p><p>moreover, those disgusting guys from the heavenly corpse sect are all so ugly. How can they be as good-looking as Lord Lu Ming? ”</p><p>Xuan Xiang retorted loudly.</p><p>At the side, Lu Ming smiled bitterly.</p><p>Profound fragrance was really innocent and simple-minded.</p><p>It was obvious that Xuan Zhong was interested in Xuan Xiang. However, Xuan Xiang still praised Lu Ming. This made Xuan Zhong even more unhappy.</p><p>As expected, Xuan Zhong’s face turned even gloomier. A trace of killing intent flashed across his eyes as he looked at Lu Ming and said, ” “Lu Ming, right? Now that I’ve arrived, we’ll be returning to the weapon forging sect. Please leave!”</p><p>In other words, he wanted Lu Ming to leave.</p><p>“Hey, Xuan Zhong, how can you be like this? Lord Lu Ming saved my life before. Moreover, he has something to do at the weapon forging sect to see my father. He’ll be coming back with us.”</p><p>Xuan Xiang’s small face immediately sank, and she said somewhat unhappily.</p><p>“He’s also going to the weapon forging sect? No, what if this person has any evil intentions …”</p><p>Xuan Zhong said with a gloomy expression.</p><p>“This is my Divine Guard token, do you want to take a look?”</p><p>Before Xuan Zhong could finish his sentence, Lu Ming interrupted him and took out the divine Guard token.</p><p>Lu Ming had gone to the weapon forging sect to ask for the thousand refined blood gold. He could not be bothered to waste his breath on Xuan Zhong.</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming take out the divine Guard token, Xuan Zhong’s face turned even gloomier.</p><p>The weapon forging sect was a subsidiary sect of the Emperor sky divine Palace. Since Lu Ming was really an Emperor sky Divine Guard, Xuan Zhong had no reason not to let Lu Ming join the weapon forging sect.</p><p>“Hmph, I told you that Lord Lu Ming is a genius among the Ditian divine guards, but someone didn’t believe me. Hmph!”</p><p>Xuan Xiang coldly snorted.</p><p>This made Xuan Zhong’s face even uglier.</p><p>“Go! Let’s go back to the weapon forging sect!”</p><p>Xuan Zhong waved his hand and left with his men.</p><p>The group continued to head north.</p><p>On the way, Xuan Xiang followed Lu Ming and chatted with him.</p><p>From Xuan Xiang, Lu Ming learned that Xuan Zhong was the only son of the weapon forging sect’s great elder. He was also the number one genius among the younger generation of the weapon forging sect. At the age of twenty-eight, he had already reached the lower tier of the LV 4 martial King realm.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Even in the Emperor sky divine Palace, where geniuses were as common as clouds, such talent would be considered superior.</p><p>Lu Ming could also tell that Xuan Xiang had some feelings for Xuan Zhong.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming did not think that Xuan Xiang liked him.</p><p>Xuan Xiang was just a simple-minded girl who idolized the strong. It was her first time seeing a genius like Lu Ming. Naturally, she idolized him and was very curious. However, this was not love.</p><p>At the front, Xuan Zhong’s face turned even gloomier when he saw Xuan Xiang and Lu Ming chatting so happily. Killing intent kept flashing in his eyes.</p><p>They chatted as they traveled.</p><p>Not long after, they had flown ten thousand miles.</p><p>In front of him, a huge and majestic mountain appeared.</p><p>This was the weapon forging sect.</p><p>Following profound fragrance, they entered the weapon forging sect and arrived at the peak of the mountain.</p><p>miss Xuan Xiang, young master Xuan Zhong, you’re back. The sect master and the elders just happened to be discussing matters in the meeting hall. I’ll go and inform them.</p><p>A white-haired old man appeared in front of them and said.</p><p>“En, alright. Grandpa Zhang, please tell my father that this Ditian Divine Guard, Lu Ming, of the Ditian divine Palace, has something to see him about!”</p><p>Xuan Xiang nodded.</p><p>“Oh, okay!”</p><p>The white-haired old man nodded and went to the meeting hall.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
