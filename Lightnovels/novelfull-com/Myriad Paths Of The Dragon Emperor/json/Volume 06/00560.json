Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Early in the morning, a series of air-piercing sounds rang out in the sky. At least a thousand coffins were flying towards the ancient desolate city from all directions.</p><p>“Not good, the heavenly corpse sect has launched an attack. There are so many coffins!”</p><p>arghh! a scream came from within the ancient desolate city and spread throughout the entire city.</p><p>“Prepare to face the enemy!”</p><p>The city Lord of barren city appeared in the sky and ordered loudly.</p><p>In the ancient desolate city, there were at least thousands of people running.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>More than a dozen figures appeared beside the palace Master of the ancient barren city. They were the palace Master of the Thunder Palace, the palace Master of the fire Palace, and some other experts of the ancient barren city.</p><p>“What’s going on? Why did the heavenly corpse sect launch an attack today? and why did they send so many people?”</p><p>The palace Master of earth roared, full of doubt.</p><p>“Perhaps, the person that the heavenly corpse sect has been waiting for has arrived.”</p><p>The city Lord of barren city sighed.</p><p>“What do you mean by the person we’re waiting for? Who are they waiting for?”</p><p>Everyone was puzzled.</p><p>&Nbsp; ka ka …</p><p>Thousands of coffins were opened, and corpse guards appeared in the air with refined corpses.</p><p>hehe, city Lord of desolation city, hand over the recondite steel heavy sword and let us Open the tomb of desolation. We can consider letting you go!</p><p>An old corpse guard laughed coldly.</p><p>in your dreams. Besides, even if you get my recondite steel heavy sword, you won’t be able to open the catacomb.</p><p>The city Lord of barren city said.</p><p>“Oh, really? Do you think we don’t know? We’ve already done our research. There are two keys to the desolate ancient tomb. If we don’t have them, would we attack rashly? Bring him up!”</p><p>The old corpse guard waved his hand, and a corpse guard appeared with a beautiful young woman.</p><p>This woman was Xuan Xiang.</p><p>“This is the descendant of the branch that left your Xuan family 10000 years ago. We’ve already obtained the key. As long as we combine the two keys, we’ll be able to open the desolate ancient tomb. Hand over your black iron heavy sword,”</p><p>The old corpse guard sneered.</p><p>The expression of the ancient barren city Lord was extremely ugly.</p><p>“You want me to hand it over? impossible, unless I die!”</p><p>The ancient barren city Lord roared.</p><p>you’re so stubborn. Since that’s the case, kill!</p><p>The old corpse guard waved his hand, and instantly, the corpse guards that covered the sky and the earth controlled the refined corpses, charging towards the ancient desolate city.</p><p>A tragic battle instantly broke out.</p><p>Thousands of guards controlled more than 2000 refined corpses and launched a frenzied attack on the ancient desolate city.</p><p>Although the Xuan family of the ancient barren city had fewer people, they still had thousands of people. With the addition of the reinforcements from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, they started an intense battle with the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The palace master of thunder, Palace Master of fire, Palace Master of earth, and Palace Master of desolation city all released extremely powerful auras. They were as dazzling as four small Suns.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, dazzling lightning and scorching flames spread in all directions, and dozens of refined corpses were instantly smashed into pieces.</p><p>hehe, four Lv 9 martial King realm. Good. After killing them, I can make four more powerful refined corpses.</p><p>A sneer was heard.</p><p>Then, four figures pounced on Thunder Palace Master and the others.</p><p>Among the four figures, two of them were huge demonic beasts. They were demonic corpses, and their bodies emitted extremely powerful auras.</p><p>Two of them were human corpses, but they were wearing iron armor and holding long Spears. They charged towards Thunder Palace Master and the others.</p><p>These two refined corpses were completely different from the other refined corpses.</p><p>Thunder Palace Master and the others didn’t dare to be careless. They fought with these refined corpses, but for a while, it was only a draw.</p><p>“Ah!” “Ah!”</p><p>From time to time, screams could be heard from all over the ancient desolate city. Someone was being killed.</p><p>Lu Ming was hiding on a mountain peak outside the ancient barren city.</p><p>there are so many experts. I didn’t expect the Empyrean heaven divine Palace to have so many Hall Masters. Adding on the strength of the ancient barren city, there are eight King tiers at the upper tier!</p><p>Lu Ming sensed the aura in the distance and pondered.</p><p>In the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, other than the three Hall Masters, there were two other late stage King tiers.</p><p>The ancient desolate city itself also had three late stage King tiers.</p><p>However, the heavenly corpse sect had clearly come prepared. They had more than eight King level corpse guards, and with the refined corpses they controlled, their strength was clearly above that of the ancient barren city.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s cultivation level, he would not be of much use if he were to participate.</p><p>I’ll just wait and see. I’ll grab the opportunity to save xuanxiang.</p><p>Lu Ming made up his mind. He hid there, restrained his aura, and remained motionless.</p><p>As time passed, the battle became even more intense. In the ancient desolate city, people were constantly killed, and the blood Qi filled the entire city.</p><p>The palace master of thunder Palace and the other late stage Kings were also under even greater pressure.</p><p>Other than the four refined corpses from before, there were even more refined corpses surrounding them.</p><p>Instantly, they were completely at a disadvantage.</p><p>charge! Let’s work together and charge out!</p><p>Thunder Palace Master roared.</p><p>“No, if we rush out, the others will all die. Also, the desolate ancient tomb can not be opened!”</p><p>The ancient barren city Lord roared.</p><p>we can’t care about that now. If we don’t rush out, we’ll all die!</p><p>Thunder Palace Master roared.</p><p>He was starting to regret taking on this mission.</p><p>&Nbsp; but the ancient Barrens city Lord and the fire Palace Lord simply refused to listen to him.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The Thunder Palace Master roared. With a wave of his hand, Thunder rolled and struck forward. The two refined corpses that were besieging him were forced to retreat. He rushed forward, trying to break out of the siege.</p><p>“You actually fled in the face of battle!”</p><p>The palace Master of fire shouted angrily.</p><p>“A bunch of fools, who would be willing to stay here and die!”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master sneered and rushed forward.</p><p>But …</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The iron chains hung in the air and two powerful refined corpses appeared, blocking The Path of Thunder Palace Master. Behind him, the two refined corpses rushed up again.</p><p>There was no way to retreat!</p><p>“Ah, detestable!”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master roared angrily but was forced back.</p><p>I’ve already sent a message to the palace Master and asked for reinforcements. We just need to hold on for an hour, and the palace Master will be able to come!</p><p>The palace Master of fire shouted.</p><p>there’s a way. We can retreat to the side of the tomb of desolation. Our Xuan family has been inscribing inscription formations around the tomb for generations. After so many years, the inscription formations there have become quite powerful. If we retreat there and open the inscription formations, we can definitely hold on for an hour!</p><p>The city Lord of barren city said.</p><p>“Alright, let’s do that!”</p><p>The palace masters of fire and earth both agreed.</p><p>The Thunder Palace Master helplessly followed them and charged towards the desolate ancient tomb.</p><p>gather, gather! We’ll retreat and defend the catacomb together!</p><p>The city Lord of the barren city shouted as he retreated. He gathered the remaining members of the Xuan family and retreated to the tomb of the barren ancients together.</p><p>However, the heavenly corpse sect was trying their best to stop them. There was killing everywhere, and not many people could shake off their opponents and come to meet up.</p><p>In the end, only a hundred or so people made it to the side of the desolate ancient tomb.</p><p>“Activate the formation!”</p><p>The ancient barren city Lord roared, his eyes filled with pain.</p><p>Once they activated the Grand array, then the people from the other parts of the ancient desolate city would only have a dead end.</p><p>But now, they had no choice but to do so.</p><p>The inscriptions glowed and a light screen appeared in front of the tomb.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
