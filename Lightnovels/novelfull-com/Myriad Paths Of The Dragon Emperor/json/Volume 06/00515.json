How many soul-sealing crystals do you need? ”</p><p>...</p><p>The old man asked.</p><p>The soul-sealing crystal could seal the soul. As long as he killed the heavenly corpse sect’s cultivators and sealed their souls in the soul-sealing crystal, he could bring them back to the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. Then, he would naturally know how many heavenly corpse sect corpse guards he had killed.</p><p>Besides, some inscription Masters could also use the souls of Warriors to refine some strange things.</p><p>Normally, it was not allowed to kill other cultivators and seal their souls for inscribing. However, the heavenly corpse sect was the enemy of the Emperor heaven divine Palace and they cultivated evil techniques, so there was naturally no problem.</p><p>“I’ll buy 100 pieces of soul-sealing crystal!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment and said.</p><p>“A hundred Yuan? Little guy, you have a big appetite!”</p><p>The old man was slightly taken aback. He cast a few more glances at Lu Ming in surprise.</p><p>“I’m just buying a few more pieces in case I need them!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>well, okay. 10 pieces of top-grade spiritual crystals for one soul-sealing crystal. 100 pieces. That’s 1000 top-grade spiritual crystals in total!</p><p>As the old man spoke, he took out a box that contained a dark red crystal with sharp edges.</p><p>This was the soul-sealing crystal.</p><p>Lu Ming also took out a thousand pieces of top-grade spirit crystals and handed them to the old man. He then kept the soul-sealing crystal and walked out.</p><p>After a while, Lu Ming left Tianxuan city and turned into a bolt of lightning, heading north.</p><p>The entrance to the demonic scales dimension was five million miles North of Tianxuan city.</p><p>Even with Lu Ming’s speed, he would need a few days.</p><p>In Tianxuan city, in shengyu’s courtyard, someone was reporting the news to him.</p><p>Lu Ming has already received a mission from the missions Hall!</p><p>A young man reported to shengyu.</p><p>Shengjiang and a few other experts were also at the side.</p><p>just as I expected, Lu Ming has indeed accepted the mission from the demonic scales dimension. Now, the news has spread. Also, we should set off!</p><p>Shengyu said, the killing intent in his eyes flickering.</p><p>“It’s finally here. Lu Ming, let’s see who can save you this time. Not only will I kill you, but I’ll also destroy your reputation!”</p><p>On the side, Sheng Kong gritted his teeth.</p><p>Among the people of the Sheng family, he was the one who hated Lu Ming the most. He had already been abused by Lu Ming twice.</p><p>In addition, Shengfeng was in a similar situation. All his belongings had been taken away by Lu Ming. How could he not hate Lu Ming?</p><p>“Lu Ming, how dare you snatch my storage ring? I’ll make you pay ten times the price!”</p><p>Shengfeng roared in his heart.</p><p>……</p><p>Three days later, Lu Ming had crossed a distance of five million miles and appeared in a small city.</p><p>The entrance to the demonic scales plane was in this small city.</p><p>The city was clearly newly built, built for the entrance to the demonic scales plane. It had only been a few months.</p><p>Lu Ming walked into the small city and headed to a huge Palace in the center of the city.</p><p>The entrance of the palace was guarded by the experts of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. Not only the entrance, but also some of the stone houses in the surroundings were guarded by some experts to prevent the heavenly corpse sect from launching a sneak attack.</p><p>halt! If you want to enter the demonic scales dimension, verify your identity first!</p><p>At the door, a burly man blocked Lu Ming’s way.</p><p>Lu Ming took out the divine Guard token and handed it to the burly man. After the burly man checked it, he nodded and said, ” “You can go in now!”</p><p>Lu Ming kept the divine Guard token and walked into the hall.</p><p>The main hall was very spacious. There was only a Black Vortex around which inscriptions were shining.</p><p>This was the entrance to the demonic scales plane.</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate and stepped in.</p><p>The world spun and in the next moment, Lu Ming found himself in a huge square.</p><p>A burst of noise entered Lu Ming’s ears.</p><p>Lu Ming then realized that there were many people in the square.</p><p>All of them were young men and women under the age of thirty. They were gathered in groups of three to five. Some were chatting with each other, while others were sitting cross-legged with their eyes closed.</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze across the crowd and discovered that there were hundreds of people.</p><p>In front of the square, there was a majestic high wall that was 300 meters tall, surrounding the entire square.</p><p>This high wall was built to defend against the scale devil race’s attacks.</p><p>This was because this was the place where the Ditian divine guards would set off, as well as the place where they would rest, adjust, and gather.</p><p>To the scaled demon race, they were outsiders and invaders. The scaled demon race naturally hated them and would attack them.</p><p>come, come, come. Our team is still short of one person. Anyone who is willing to join us? you only need to reach Lv 2 martial King realm. Once everyone is here, we’ll set off immediately!</p><p>come on, our team is lacking a martial artist who comprehended the creation of wood. As long as you know a few healing techniques, you can join.</p><p>our team is lacking a martial artist who comprehended the concept of earth and is skilled in defense. Which brother is coming? ”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming heard shouts.</p><p>This was the Ditian Divine Guard forming a team to hunt the corpse guards of the heavenly corpse sect and search for treasures.</p><p>Each attribute’s intent realm had a different aspect that they were good at.</p><p>Wind specialized in speed, and fire had terrifying explosive power.</p><p>For example, the intent of wood specialized in healing and healing, while the intent of earth and mountain specialized in defense.</p><p>Only when many people formed a team and complemented each other could they unleash the strongest power.</p><p>After all, it was too dangerous to go alone.</p><p>brother, you don’t look familiar. Is this your first time in my dimension? ”</p><p>At this moment, four young men and women walked toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Three men and one woman.</p><p>The one walking in front was a burly young man. He looked simple and honest, and he looked at Lu Ming with a sincere smile.</p><p>It was this young man who had just spoken.</p><p>“Yes, it’s my first time here.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Oh, I’m han man. How should I address you, brother?”</p><p>Han man cupped his fists and said with a smile.</p><p>“I’m lu Ming!”</p><p>Lu Ming answered.</p><p>so it’s brother Lu. Brother Lu, our team just happens to be short of one person. I wonder if brother Lu can join us and hunt the corpse guards of the heavenly corpse sect together? ”</p><p>Han man said, his eyes full of sincerity.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment and hesitated.</p><p>brother Lu, this is Yao Xuan. She has just joined our team. We are now short of one person. After all, four people is too weak. With brother Lu, we can set off.</p><p>Han man pointed at the woman.</p><p>The lady looked to be around twenty-three or twenty-four years old. She had a petite figure and an extremely delicate and beautiful appearance. She was looking at Lu Ming timidly.</p><p>furthermore, this is brother Lu’s first time in the demonic scales dimension. You might not be familiar with everything here. Join our team and we can discuss things with each other! han man continued.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll join!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment and nodded.</p><p>It was just as han man had said. It was his first time in the demonic scales dimension, so there were many things he did not know. He was completely clueless about the geographical location of the demonic scales dimension.</p><p>It was necessary to join a team first and get familiar with it.</p><p>He would consider acting alone after he was more familiar with the demonic scales plane.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
