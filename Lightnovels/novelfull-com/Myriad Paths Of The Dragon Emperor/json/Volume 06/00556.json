Why don’t we hear what exactly happened? Let’s make things clear first.”</p><p>Xuan long said.</p><p>“Sect master!”</p><p>Xuan Yuan was a little anxious.</p><p>“Alright, there’s no need to say more!”</p><p>Xuan long waved his hand and said.</p><p>The gloominess in Xuan Yuan’s eyes intensified. He knew that he could not kill Lu Ming with Xuan Long’s help.</p><p>Secretly, he gave a look to one of the elders. The elder nodded slightly and slowly retreated, disappearing into the darkness without anyone noticing.</p><p>“Little brother Lu, what’s going on?”</p><p>Xuan long looked at Lu Ming and asked.</p><p>“Yes, Lord Lu Ming, what’s going on? then, how is Xuan Zhong?”</p><p>Xuan Xiang also asked, looking at the Xuan Zhong in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>“Sect master Xuan, when I left the weapon forging sect, I met this Xuan Zhong with one of his senior brothers. They tried to kill me on the way.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“What? Xuan Zhong, How dare you?”</p><p>Xuan long roared when he heard that.</p><p>“Xuan Zhong, you … You actually did such a thing …”</p><p>Xuan Xiang also looked at Xuan Zhong with a face full of disappointment.</p><p>Xuan Zhong lowered his head. His eyes were full of dejection, and he didn’t say anything.</p><p>nonsense! Little bastard, it’s clearly you who wanted to kill Zhong ‘er …</p><p>Xuan Yuan shouted again.</p><p>“Shut up, old man. If you don’t have a f * cking brain, do the others have one too? I just barged in from the outside and a group of people saw it. According to what you said, I barged in first and took Xuan Zhong away. Then, I barged in from the outside with Xuan Zhong and let you block my way?”</p><p>Lu Ming berated loudly.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Xuan Yuan’s face turned red.</p><p>He had just wanted to pin a crime on Lu Ming at the last minute. He did not expect that there would be so many flaws. How could he continue at this moment?</p><p>“Xuan Yuan, were you the one who ordered this?”</p><p>Xuan long looked at Xuan Yuan with an ugly expression.</p><p>wait a minute, Grandmaster Xuan. Trying to kill me on the way is a small matter. Just now, I learned something from Xuan Zhong, which is a big matter.</p><p>Lu Ming said loudly.</p><p>Xuan Yuan’s expression changed drastically as soon as he heard this. He slowly retreated.</p><p>“Oh? Big event? What’s the big deal?”</p><p>Xuan long asked.</p><p>great elder Xuan Yuan has already colluded with the heavenly corpse sect. In two days, they’ll work with the heavenly corpse sect and break through the weapon forging sect!</p><p>Lu Ming said loudly.</p><p>His words were like a thunderclap that exploded in the minds of everyone from the weapon forging sect.</p><p>“What? What did you just say?”</p><p>Xuan long was in disbelief.</p><p>The others also looked at Lu Ming in disbelief.</p><p>This was too shocking.</p><p>“Sect master Xuan, this is what Xuan Zhong said himself!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Nonsense! You’re slandering him! Sect master, Lu Ming is trying to sow discord between us. I suggest that we kill him immediately!”</p><p>Xuan Yuan roared.</p><p>Xuan Yuan, you still dare to quibble until now. However, you are really ruthless. Just now, you even wanted to kill Xuan Zhong to silence me. He is your biological son.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>After that, he said to Xuan Zhong,”Xuan Zhong, are you still going to help your father hide the truth? he’s such an unscrupulous father.” When the heavenly corpse sect raze the weapon forging sect to the ground, everyone you know will die. What’s the point of your life then?”</p><p>“Also, there’s nothing going on between me and Xuan Xiang. On the contrary, she told me that she likes you, but you always misunderstand her.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s words made Xuan Zhong’s body tremble slightly. He raised his head and looked at Xuan Xiang.</p><p>“Xuan Zhong, what happened? Tell me!”</p><p>Xuan Xiang shouted.</p><p>Xuan Zhong’s eyes flickered. Then, he looked decisive and said to Xuan Yuan, ” “Father, let’s stop. We’ve made great contributions to the weapon forging sect for generations. I believe that the sect master and the elders will forgive us. Let’s stop!”</p><p>His words were like a sudden clap of thunder.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes turned to Xuan Yuan.</p><p>“Xuan Yuan, How dare you!”</p><p>Xuan long roared, his hair and beard all standing up.</p><p>evil creature, you’re really useless. You can’t achieve great things when you’re trapped by love. If I had known this earlier, I would’ve killed you.</p><p>Xuan Yuan looked at Xuan Zhong coldly.</p><p>Then, he looked at Lu Ming and sneered.”Little bastard, you ruined my plan. I want you to die without a burial place!”</p><p>With that, Xuan Yuan quickly retreated.</p><p>“Not good, he’s leaving!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>“Stay here!”</p><p>The Xuan Dragon roared and chased after Xuan Yuan.</p><p>Xiang Xiang, please forgive me, forgive me!</p><p>Xuan Zhong shouted.</p><p>Xuan Xiang looked at Xuan Zhong with disappointment. Her face gradually turned cold as she said, ” “This time, if not for Lord Lu Ming, you and your father would have colluded with the heavenly corpse sect and attacked the weapon forging sect. How can I forgive you?”</p><p>Xuan Xiang turned her head and no longer looked at Xuan Zhong.</p><p>Xuan Zhong’s face was filled with despair.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>At this moment, Xuan long and Xuan Yuan had already exchanged a blow, and Xuan Yuan retreated rapidly.</p><p>Hu hu hu …</p><p>At this moment, the sound of something breaking through the air rang out around the weapon forging sect.</p><p>Pitch-black coffins appeared around the weapon forging sect.</p><p>“The heavenly corpse sect is attacking!”</p><p>“The heavenly corpse sect is attacking!”</p><p>……</p><p>From all directions, a series of screams rang out.</p><p>“Hahaha, now, you’re all going to die!”</p><p>Xuan Yuan laughed crazily.</p><p>“Damn it, activate the formation, activate the formation!”</p><p>Xuan long roared.</p><p>But …</p><p>In the next moment, the sounds of explosions and screams rang out from the surroundings of the weapon forging sect.</p><p>“Ah!” “Ah!”</p><p>At the scene, a few elders suddenly made a move and tried to assassinate the other elders of the weapon forging sect.</p><p>The elders were instantly killed.</p><p>“You guys …”</p><p>Xuan long roared, and his eyes were about to spit fire.</p><p>It was obvious that these people had all defected.</p><p>haha, Xuan long, I’ve been in the weapon forging sect for many years. How can I not have anyone? ”</p><p>Xuan Yuan sneered.</p><p>“Traitor, traitor, kill!”</p><p>The weapon forging sect was in a state of chaos as shouts of killing could be heard.</p><p>At this moment, the coffin of the heavenly corpse sect opened, and corpse guards and refined corpses flew out. They charged into the weapon forging sect and began a great battle.</p><p>In an instant, the weapon forging sect was plunged into the flames of war.</p><p>“Xuan Yuan, you deserve to die!”</p><p>The Xuan Dragon roared and pounced toward Xuan Yuan.</p><p>“Don’t think I’m afraid of you!”</p><p>Xuan Yuan roared and started fighting with Xuan long.</p><p>Both of them were at the upper tier of the LV 7 martial King realm, and their battle was extremely intense.</p><p>“Xuan long, hand over the recondite steel heavy sword and I’ll leave your corpse intact!”</p><p>An old corpse guard in a black robe silently appeared not far away and said coldly.</p><p>“So what you want is the recondite steel heavy sword, you … You guys are going to the ancient desolate city?”</p><p>Xuan long seemed to have thought of something, and his face changed.</p><p>“Hehe, hurry up and hand over the recondite steel heavy sword. I know it’s in your storage ring.”</p><p>The old corpse guard roared.</p><p>“Little brother Lu, quickly take Xiangxiang away!”</p><p>Lu Ming! Xuan long suddenly shouted at Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
