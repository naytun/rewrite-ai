It was because he had been feeling more and more anxious recently and he could not continue cultivating.</p><p>There were only about ten days left until the day of Mu Lan’s wedding with the sacred constellation.</p><p>Lu Ming could not calm down.</p><p>no, I still have to find a way out. I can’t just be trapped here.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and decided to go out and investigate.</p><p>With his current battle prowess, as long as he didn’t run into a sea of soul realm expert, he would definitely have no problem escaping.</p><p>“Brat, you’re finally going out. After all this time of thinking, I’ve finally thought of a possible way to get out.”</p><p>Dandan lay on Lu Ming’s shoulder, crossed her legs, and said leisurely.</p><p>“Think of a way to get out. What way?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes shone brightly.</p><p>“When you guys came here, it should be because of the desolation ancient city. Then, you can only rely on the desolation ancient city to get out. You just need to find the desolation ancient city and then I will study it. Perhaps, I can find the way out.”</p><p>Dandan explained.</p><p>“Ancient desolate city?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up, but he then frowned. although the ancient barren city has also entered this world, I wonder where it landed? ”</p><p>“It should be on this Island. It’s up to you to find it.”</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Now, he could only rely on this method.</p><p>A long spear condensed in Lu Ming’s hands. The long spear spun, burrowed into the ground, and shot upward.</p><p>After a moment, Lu Ming emerged from the ground.</p><p>Lu Ming restrained his aura and observed his surroundings.</p><p>They gathered together, but there was no movement.</p><p>“Could it be that the three-eyed creature has already left?”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and was about to soar into the sky.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s expression changed. He retracted his aura and hid himself.</p><p>In the sky, a tall figure was flying toward the island at high speed.</p><p>Wasn’t that the three-eyed creature?</p><p>The three-eyed creature still hadn’t left.</p><p>The three-eyed creature had not left. Lu Ming’s search for the ancient desolation city would be a little difficult.</p><p>At this moment, a few more figures flew over from the distance.</p><p>It was also a three-eyed creature.</p><p>quick, the leader has found an ancient city in the depths of the island. It’s very likely to be related to the appearance of those reptiles here. Let’s hurry over!</p><p>“Hurry up!”</p><p>A few voices could be heard from the sky. Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>“Ancient city? Oh no, could it be that the three-eyed creature has found the ancient desolate city?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was extremely ugly. If the ancient barren city was discovered by the three-eyed creature, he would be in trouble.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth and used his movement technique. He stuck close to the ground and followed the three-eyed creature at top speed.</p><p>They flew at an extremely fast speed. In one day, they had covered a distance of two million miles.</p><p>A huge forest appeared in front of them.</p><p>“It’s that mountain forest!”</p><p>Lu Ming could tell at a glance that the forest in front of him was the same forest that he had appeared in when he first entered.</p><p>Lu Ming became more careful and restrained his aura.</p><p>This was because there were extremely powerful demonic beasts in this mountain forest.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not encounter any powerful demonic beasts along the way. The ones he encountered were all extremely weak.</p><p>“Who’s that?”</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming passed by a place and discovered that the place was in a mess. Ancient trees had collapsed, and there were huge potholes everywhere. He could even see huge palm prints on the ground.</p><p>There were still some bloodstains on the ground.</p><p>“Could it be that the three-eyed creature has already killed all the powerful demonic beasts here?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>Sure enough, along the way, they could see some potholes from time to time, all of which were traces of a great battle.</p><p>After travelling for half a day, the three-eyed creatures suddenly stopped.</p><p>Lu Ming could sense that there were waves of terrifying and powerful auras coming from not far ahead.</p><p>There were at least two hundred shares.</p><p>There were dozens of auras that were extremely terrifying and unfathomable like the ocean.</p><p>Lu Ming did not dare to move forward and retreated a hundred miles.</p><p>“Dandan, help me inscribe the inscription that conceals my aura!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>alright, I’ll help you again. But in the future, if you encounter high-grade spiritual herbs or natural treasures, don’t forget me. I need to recover!</p><p>Dandan took the opportunity to bid.</p><p>don’t be so long-winded! Hurry up, or I’ll throw you out!</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at dandan and threatened her.</p><p>“You … Kid, you’re ruthless!”</p><p>Dandan gritted her teeth. In the end, she had no choice but to help Lu Ming inscribe inscriptions while cursing.</p><p>After three failed attempts, he finally succeeded. Runes appeared on Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Lu Ming rushed to the sky and hid in a cloud, looking into the distance.</p><p>In front of them was a huge, pitch-black ancient city that sat in the middle of the forest.</p><p>ancient barren city, it’s really the ancient barren city!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>However, the current barren ancient city was different from before. Now, the surroundings of the barren ancient city were filled with light. A layer of light barrier enveloped the barren ancient city.</p><p>And around the ancient desolate city, there were many tall figures.</p><p>There were more than two hundred tall figures, all three-eyed creatures.</p><p>The weakest of the two hundred three-eyed creatures was equivalent to a peak-tier King. When they gathered together, their aura was extremely terrifying.</p><p>alright, we’re almost there. Let’s attack together and break the light shield on the city!</p><p>A voice rang out.</p><p>“Yes, leader!”</p><p>The other three-eyed creatures all responded.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Following that, terrifying auras burst forth. Over two hundred three-eyed creatures emitted terrifying black light from their bodies. All sorts of weapons appeared, and terrifying attacks bombarded the light shield of the ancient barren city.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>More than two hundred three-eyed creatures attacked at the same time. The scene was extremely shocking. The entire world was boiling as it was completely submerged by the powerful attacks.</p><p>However, the light shield was able to withstand it. It rumbled continuously and rippled like water, but it was indeed able to withstand it and was not broken.</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>With a loud roar, the three-eyed creature once again launched a frenzied attack.</p><p>Wave after wave of attacks landed on the light shield, causing it to shake more and more violently, as if it would collapse at any time.</p><p>“Use the divine eyes to attack!”</p><p>The voice gave another order.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming saw that the third eye of each three-eyed creature was emitting a dazzling light. They shot out beams of light, which were like divine swords that bombarded the light shield.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The light shield seemed to finally be overwhelmed and collapsed with a loud bang.</p><p>haha, we’ve finally broken through. Let’s rush in and see what the secret is!</p><p>A three-eyed creature laughed and strode into the ancient desolate city.</p><p>But just as he rushed into the ancient desolate city, a look of horror appeared on his face. With a scream, his burly body actually exploded.</p><p>The other three-eyed creatures who were about to charge in were all shocked.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Many three-eyed creatures stopped in their tracks, bewildered.</p><p>“Who’s in there?”</p><p>The burliest three-eyed creature roared as he stared coldly at the ancient barren city.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
