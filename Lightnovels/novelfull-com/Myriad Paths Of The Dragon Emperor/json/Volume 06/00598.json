Boom! Boom!</p><p>Immediately after, the mouthful of wine transformed into waves of terrifying and scorching energy that crashed around in Lu Ming’s body like stormy waves.</p><p>From the outside, one could see that Lu Ming’s body was expanding rapidly as if he would explode at any time from this energy.</p><p>Too powerful, this energy was too powerful.</p><p>It was rare for the man to look at Lu Ming with a serious expression. If Lu Ming could not withstand it, he would help.</p><p>“Devour!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming let out a low growl. A powerful devouring force was emitted from his spine, devouring all the boundless energy in his body.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged and circulated the true war Dragon technique at full force to refine it.</p><p>Half an hour later, Lu Ming heaved a long sigh and opened his eyes. A flash of lightning flashed across his eyes, filled with a terrifying aura.</p><p>“Such pure and majestic energy!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly amazed.</p><p>He felt that the energy from that mouthful of wine was more terrifying than the energy from refining millions of top-grade spirit crystals. If it was not for the fact that Lu Ming’s intent realm had not broken through, he felt that he could use the energy from that mouthful of wine to break through to peak-tier King.</p><p>Of course, this was just an illusion. He couldn’t break through to peak-tier King realm with just a few million Supreme-grade spirit crystals.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s essential core had become thicker and purer. It had reached its limit.</p><p>A mouthful of wine had more terrifying energy than millions of top-grade spirit crystals. Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>He had seen the muscular man gulping down the wine.</p><p>not bad, not bad. You’ve refined a mouthful of my wine in only half an hour. It’s my first time to meet a little guy like you!</p><p>The muscular man looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>“Many thanks for senior’s wine!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Do you want a few more mouthfuls?”</p><p>The muscular man said.</p><p>“No… I don’t want it. ”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands repeatedly.</p><p>His intent realm had not broken through yet, so drinking it would be a waste.</p><p>“I’m lu Ming. How should I address you, senior?” Lu Ming asked after a moment of silence.</p><p>“Me? Yan kuangtu, I wonder if you’ve heard of it?”</p><p>The robust man said with a slight smile.</p><p>“What? You’re Yan Kuang tu!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes widened in shock.</p><p>Yan kuangtu was a name that not many people in the Empyrean heaven divine Palace did not know.</p><p>This was especially true for the Ditian divine guards of the Tianxuan region.</p><p>Yan kuangtu’s entire life was a legend.</p><p>Yan kuangtu came from a humble background. He came from an unknown small village in the eastern part of the Tianxuan region.</p><p>However, with his unparalleled talent, he grew up from a young man in a small mountain village, step by step, and finally became a rare heaven’s favorite in the Tianxuan region. Later, he was even valued by the Supreme Lord of the nine suns and accepted as a disciple.</p><p>After being taken in as a disciple by the nine suns Paragon, he displayed an even more terrifying talent. Countless geniuses and demon-level geniuses were all suppressed by him. He stepped on all the geniuses and rose up, becoming a peak expert of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace.</p><p>It was said that Yan kuangtu’s cultivation was no longer weaker than his master, the nine yang supremacy.</p><p>This legendary person was standing in front of Lu Ming alive and well.</p><p>Lu Ming had the most special feelings.</p><p>This was because the remnant soul of the nine suns Supreme Being was currently in the Supreme shrine.</p><p>The nine suns supremacy could be considered as half of Lu Ming’s master. Without the nine suns supremacy, Lu Ming would not be where he was today.</p><p>Since Yan kuangtu was the disciple of the nine suns Supreme, Lu Ming felt closer to him.</p><p>“Should I tell Yan kuangtu about the nine suns Supreme? No, no, I can’t say it. This matter involves too many people. I can’t take the risk!”</p><p>A thought flashed across Lu Ming’s mind but he immediately rejected it.</p><p>First of all, this matter was too outrageous.</p><p>Also, Yan kuangtu was now valued by Martial Emperor Di Yi. What if he was on his side? If he said it, wouldn’t he be courting death?</p><p>Lu Ming decided not to say anything. At least, he would not say anything before he was powerful enough.</p><p>“So it’s senior Yan. Senior’s name reverberates like thunder in my ears.”</p><p>Lu Ming gathered his thoughts and cupped his fists in a salute.</p><p>haha, you’re welcome. Alright, I’ll take you back to the Tianxuan region now!</p><p>Yan kuangtu laughed.</p><p>“Go back? How do we go back from here?”</p><p>Lu Ming was full of doubts.</p><p>“Of course we’re flying back!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu smiled. In the next moment, a terrifying aura emanated from his body.</p><p>This aura was even more majestic than the vast ocean, as deep as the universe.</p><p>The moment this aura appeared, Yan kuangtu immediately retracted it.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was still shocked.</p><p>He felt that in front of this aura, peak-tier Kings were like ants or dust.</p><p>At this moment, dandan shrank her head back in fear, her palms grabbing Lu Ming’s shoulders tightly.</p><p>Huala!</p><p>Yan kuangtu stretched out his hand and drew a line in the air. The space was torn apart like a piece of paper, revealing a deep, pitch-black spatial crack.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu grabbed Lu Ming’s arm and stepped into the spatial crack.</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming felt the world spinning around him. It was pitch-black all around him and he could not see anything.</p><p>After a while, the sky suddenly brightened. Lu Ming realized that they had appeared in the sky above a vast mountain range.</p><p>Then, Yan kuangtu stretched out his hand and drew a line in the air. The space cracked open again. Yan kuangtu brought Lu Ming along and stepped into the spatial crack.</p><p>He tore through space. He was tearing through space.</p><p>If one’s strength had not reached an unbelievable realm, it would be extremely difficult to do so.</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely shocked.</p><p>Not long after, they appeared above another Lake. Yan kuangtu continued to tear through space.</p><p>This process repeated as they headed towards the Tianxuan region.</p><p>……</p><p>Tianxuan region, Tianxuan city.</p><p>These days, it was extremely lively. Everywhere was decorated with lanterns and colored banners, and the atmosphere was joyous.</p><p>This was because the number one genius of the Tianxuan region, Saint Xingchen, the top one on the list of top 1000 talents of the eastern barren territory, was about to marry the daughter of the Tianxuan sub-Palace Master.</p><p>Countless people from all over the Tianxuan region came to congratulate him.</p><p>In the past few days, Tianxuan city’s city gates had been opened wide, and everything was free of charge.</p><p>On the first level of Tianxuan city, there was a huge square. Thousands of tables had already been set up.</p><p>Today was the wedding day of Mu Lan and the sacred constellation.</p><p>Many people were heading towards the square. Those who could enter here were all famous people in the Tianxuan region. Ordinary people did not have the qualifications to enter.</p><p>At the edge of the square, on a Pavilion, mu xiuyuan and the palace Master of the eastern Palace, mu Zheng, stood side by side, looking at the lively crowd below.</p><p>sigh, it seems that nothing can be changed. LAN ‘er, that girl, wanted to resist, but in the end, she still ended up like this!</p><p>Mu Zheng sighed.</p><p>“Lu Ming has disappeared for half a year. I wonder why? Many people in the outside world are saying that Lu Ming is afraid and knows that he’s no match for the sacred constellation, so he’s hiding. I don’t believe this at all. With Lu Ming’s personality, even if he’s no match for the sacred constellation, he’ll still fight!”</p><p>Mu xiuyuan said.</p><p>“There’s too little time. It’s true that it’ll be difficult for Lu Ming to defeat the sacred constellation. It’s good that he didn’t appear. It’s also good for Lu Ming.”</p><p>Mu Zheng sighed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
