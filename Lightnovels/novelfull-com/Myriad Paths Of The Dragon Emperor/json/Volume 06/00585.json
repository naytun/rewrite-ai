In six days?”</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes darted around.</p><p>Six days later, it was too late. It was already the agreed date.</p><p>However, there was no other way now.</p><p>“Alright, I must get a territory crossing token in six days!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered in a firm voice.</p><p>As they walked, they chatted. Soon, the two of them walked out of the palace.</p><p>brother Lu, if you need anything, just let me know. I’ll auction off a territory crossing token, which is very valuable. If you need the help of spirit crystals, I can help you temporarily!</p><p>Fei Xue said.</p><p>there’s no need for that, miss flying snow. I still have to thank you for your help this time. I will definitely obtain the territory crossing token six days later.</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and then left.</p><p>six days later. Even if I manage to get the token, I can only use it on the second day, which means seven days later. I hope I can make it in time!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart.</p><p>Lu Ming did not return to the inn immediately. He asked around and headed to the Tianji auction house.</p><p>He did not have many Supreme spiritual crystals on him now. 800000 Supreme spiritual crystals were probably not enough.</p><p>According to what Fei Xue said, the price of two cross-domain quotas would be very high.</p><p>Lu Ming planned to take out some items and put them up for auction at the secret Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>“What should we use to bid?”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered as he walked.</p><p>He had a lot of low-level items on him, but they were not worth much.</p><p>The high-level ones, such as the true war Dragon technique, the cultivation method of the Dragon God’s three absolutes, the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps, and the path-understanding ancient tree, were not things that could be taken out for auction.</p><p>He could take out some of the dark yellow soil to auction, but Lu Ming was reluctant to do so.</p><p>There were also five pieces of the highest grade level-six common knotgrass. Lu Ming could not give them away because he planned to use them to break through to the seventh-grade physical body.</p><p>As for heaven level martial arts techniques, Lu Ming had seven to eight of them on him, all of which were heaven level low-rank.</p><p>However, it was impossible to sell seven or eight heaven grade low level martial arts techniques for too high a price.</p><p>it seems like I’ll have to sell some intent crystals.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>&Nbsp; he had a lot of intent crystals right now, so there was no harm in selling some that he didn’t use.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming arrived at the heavenly secret auction house.</p><p>The secret Chamber of Commerce was the number one Chamber of Commerce on the continent, and its reputation was unquestionable.</p><p>“Young master, are you auctioning a treasure?”</p><p>As soon as they entered the heavenly secret auction house, a beautiful young lady walked up to them and asked with a smile.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Those who came to the heaven’s secrets auction house were usually there to auction their treasures.</p><p>young master, please follow me. Your treasure needs to be appraised by an appraiser!</p><p>The young lady brought Lu Ming to a counter.</p><p>“Lord appraiser, this young hero wants to put up a treasure for auction!”</p><p>The young girl said to a white-haired old man on the counter.</p><p>mm, I know. You may leave!</p><p>The old man waved his hand, and the young girl left.</p><p>“Little brother, what treasure do you want to auction?”</p><p>The old man looked at Lu Ming with a smile. He was very kind and made people feel like they were bathing in the spring breeze.</p><p>As expected of the secret Chamber of Commerce, its quality was truly different.</p><p>“I want to put up an auction for intent crystals.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Oh? How many were they auctioning? According to the rules, you can’t put it up for auction for less than ten Yuan.”</p><p>The old man smiled.</p><p>There were too few of them. The treasures auctioned by the secret Chamber of Commerce all had a base price of more than 10000 Supreme spiritual crystals.</p><p>I’m auctioning two thousand low-grade intent crystals!</p><p>Lu Ming said. He then took out a storage ring and passed it to the old man.</p><p>“What? Two thousand?”</p><p>The old man’s voice suddenly rose, his face full of shock.</p><p>Gao Keng’s voice attracted some people’s attention.</p><p>Some of the girls even guessed that there was some particularly valuable treasure. Otherwise, why would the appraiser be so surprised?</p><p>&Nbsp; intent crystals were consumables. Warriors who obtained them would use them as long as their attributes matched to increase their strength. It was extremely rare for someone to put up two thousand intent crystals for auction.</p><p>The old man’s consciousness entered the storage ring to take a look, and his eyes widened.</p><p>two thousand gold-attribute intent crystals. All of them are gold-attribute intent crystals.</p><p>The old man exclaimed.</p><p>He initially thought that even if Lu Ming took out two thousand esoteric crystals, they would be a mix of all kinds of attributes.</p><p>If that was the case, the price would be much lower. He didn’t expect them to all be gold-attribute intent crystals.</p><p>The price of the same type of intent crystal would be much higher.</p><p>Those who cultivated the creation of gold would probably bid like crazy.</p><p>The market price of an intent crystal was 1000 top-grade spirit crystals, but in reality, 1000 top-grade spirit crystals were not enough to buy one intent crystal.</p><p>It could often be fried to a few thousand Yuan, or even more.</p><p>And the fewer intent crystals there were, the cheaper the price.</p><p>If there were a lot of them and they were sold in groups, the price would be even higher.</p><p>A warrior refining one or two intent crystals could only speed up the comprehension of intent.</p><p>However, if he used it continuously, not only would the effect be good, but it could also help him break through to the realm of intent.</p><p>For example, if one’s intent realm encountered a bottleneck, one or two intent crystals wouldn’t be of much use, but one hundred might be enough to break through the bottleneck.</p><p>&Nbsp; thus, the more there were, the higher the average price of each intent crystal would be.</p><p>If two thousand metal intent crystals were to be auctioned off at the same time, the price would definitely be terrifyingly high.</p><p>“Little brother, I’ll help you register!”</p><p>The old man quickly helped Lu Ming to register and then handed him a proof of auction.</p><p>“Little brother, according to the rules, after the auction is done, there’s a 5% commission fee.”</p><p>The old man laughed.</p><p>“I understand!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He kept the consignment certificate and left the Tianji auction house.</p><p>After making a few rounds around Hong city, Lu Ming found a restaurant and walked up to a table by the window. He ordered some food and wine and started eating.</p><p>“Did you hear? there’s going to be a great treasure being auctioned at the heavenly secret auction this time.”</p><p>I’ve heard about the secret Chamber of Commerce’s promotion a few days ago. I wonder what kind of treasure it is? ”</p><p>“I don’t know exactly what treasure it is, but an elder of my clan works in the heaven’s secrets auction house. According to him, it’s a rare treasure.”</p><p>“Oh, I’m really looking forward to it!”</p><p>In the restaurant, some other people were eating and drinking while chatting.</p><p>A short and chubby young man said the loudest with a smug look on his face.</p><p>At this moment, the chunky young man’s expression changed. He took out a Jade voice transmission talisman and his expression changed when he saw it.</p><p>big news, big news! I just received news that there’s another treasure up for auction. Can you guess what it is? ” he shouted.</p><p>how can you guess? tell me!</p><p>The others said.</p><p>haha, let me tell you. This time, it’s intent crystals, ” ye mo said.</p><p>The short and fat youth said.</p><p>“Intent crystals? What’s so strange about that? it’s not a treasure.”</p><p>The others were disdainful.</p><p>although the power Upanishad crystals aren’t a great treasure, once you have enough of them, they’ll become a great treasure. I heard that this time, a set of two thousand gold power Upanishad crystals will be auctioned off at the same time. The secret Chamber of Commerce has already started to publicize it.</p><p>The short and fat youth shouted.</p><p>“What? Two thousand gold intent crystals?”</p><p>The others were all shocked.</p><p>……</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
