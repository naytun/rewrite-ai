He first cleared out all the best-grade spiritual crystals.</p><p>Han man, mu Sen, and Mu Lin had a total of about 100000 top quality spiritual crystals.</p><p>In addition to the 60000 that Lu Ming originally had, he now had a total of 160000 pieces of top-grade spiritual crystals.</p><p>160000 spiritual crystals of the best quality is enough for me to break through to the LV 3 martial King realm!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He waved his hand and 20000 pieces of top-grade spiritual crystals floated in the air.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>All 20,000 pieces of top-grade spiritual crystals exploded. Lu Ming controlled the nine Dragon bloodline and devoured all the spiritual Qi in the top-grade spiritual crystals. He then began to break through to the third level of the martial King realm.</p><p>Soon, 20,000 pieces of top-grade spirit crystals were refined and Lu Ming took out another 20000.</p><p>Twenty thousand and twenty thousand.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming had refined a total of 120000 pieces of top-grade spirit crystals.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The vital essence converted from 120000 pieces of Supreme spiritual crystals was extremely vast and rich.</p><p>The vast true energy surged and charged towards the LV 3 martial King realm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A moment later, there was a loud boom and the aura on Lu Ming’s body expanded rapidly.</p><p>He had broken through to the third level of the martial King realm!</p><p>After spending 120000 pieces of top-grade spiritual crystals, Lu Ming’s cultivation finally broke through to the third level of the martial King realm, and his strength had increased greatly.</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming simply took out the last forty thousand pieces of top-grade spirit crystals and devoured them all to improve his cultivation.</p><p>Soon, the last 40000 pieces of top-grade spirit crystals were all converted into Lu Ming’s essential core.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation had reached the peak of the early stage of the third level martial King realm, but he had not broken through to the middle stage.</p><p>At Lv 3 martial King realm, the number of Supreme spiritual crystals required for a breakthrough had increased.</p><p>early stage of Lv 3 martial King realm. I wonder how he’ll fare against a lower tier King? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. In the next moment, he left the Supreme shrine and soared into the sky, flying back the way he came.</p><p>Soon, tens of thousands of miles were covered in a flash.</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming stopped.</p><p>In front of him, there were six figures flying at high speed.</p><p>Suddenly-</p><p>“Lu Ming, that’s Lu Ming in front!”</p><p>“Lu Ming is in front. Speed up. Don’t let him escape!”</p><p>A few loud roars were heard and six figures rushed toward Lu Ming at lightning speed.</p><p>These six people were the six young men from the Sheng family.</p><p>Lu Ming stood in the void, motionless.</p><p>The space trembled and six youths from the Sheng family flew over, surrounding Lu Ming.</p><p>A surging aura emerged from the young man of the Sheng family without any concealment.</p><p>one middle-stage Lv 4 martial King realm, three Lv 3 martial King realm, and two Lv 2 martial King realm!</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze across the six youths from the Sheng family and was very clear about their cultivation.</p><p>haha, this guy actually didn’t run. Could it be that he’s scared silly? ”</p><p>“No matter what? This credit is ours!”</p><p>The few youths from the Sheng family laughed and looked at Lu Ming with a mocking expression as if they could manipulate Lu Ming at will.</p><p>“Be careful when you attack later. This guy is not simple!”</p><p>The lower tier King tier frowned.</p><p>“With you around, brother Qiang, this guy won’t be able to do much.”</p><p>Another young man laughed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was strong, but there was still a gap between him and a lower tier King. They were very assured.</p><p>“Are you done with your nonsense? if you are, you can die!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming spoke.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The six young men of the Sheng family were slightly stunned.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation erupted and a huge Spear’s gleam swept out.</p><p>The Spear’s radiance swept in all directions.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The six young men’s expressions changed drastically. The leader of the group, a lower tier King Saint, burst out with a terrifying aura. He slashed out with his blade, and the first level lower tier earth will burst out.</p><p>The other five young men also unleashed their full strength.</p><p>This was because Lu Ming’s shot made them feel danger.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>After six consecutive booms, the five young men of the Sheng family were forced back like cannonballs.</p><p>Even Sheng Qiang’s body trembled. He took nine steps back in the air before he stopped.</p><p>“With your battle prowess, how is this possible?”</p><p>Sheng Qiang’s eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming could actually force him back with one shot? How was that possible?</p><p>It was a King tier at the lower tier.</p><p>“An initial King tier is only so-so! Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly and took a step forward.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure suddenly disappeared after he took that step.</p><p>He didn’t charge towards Sheng Qiang, but towards the other five.</p><p>“Not good, retreat, you guys quickly retreat!”</p><p>Sheng Qiang’s expression changed drastically. He roared and flew after Lu Ming.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s speed was too fast. In an instant, he appeared in front of the two third level martial King realm youths. Two rays of sharp spear light were sent out toward the two of them.</p><p>“Ah!” “Ah!”</p><p>no! the two of them roared in shock and used all their strength to block it.</p><p>However, now that Lu Ming had reached the third level of the martial King realm, how could they possibly resist him?</p><p>The difference was too great.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Two spear lights pierced through the throats of two people.</p><p>Blood gushed out of the two, and they immediately died.</p><p>The devouring power burst forth and devoured their blood essence. At the same time, Lu Ming used his essential core to sweep up their storage rings and put them into the Supreme shrine.</p><p>Then, in a flash, he charged towards the remaining three.</p><p>The three of them were horrified and ran for their lives. However, Lu Ming’s Nine Dragons heaven treading steps was too fast for them to escape.</p><p>With three consecutive screams, the remaining three youths of the Sheng family were all killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming would not let go of the storage ring and the blood essence.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it! How dare you kill the hero of the Sheng family! Lu Ming, no one can save you!”</p><p>Sheng Qiang cried out hysterically as he watched the five young men of the Sheng family being killed.</p><p>“Now, it’s your turn!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Sheng Qiang.</p><p>“Haha, you still want to kill me? I admit that your combat strength is indeed powerful and has surpassed mine, but it’s only by a little. I’m determined to leave, so how can you keep me here? Lu Ming, just wait for the Sheng family’s revenge!”</p><p>Sheng Qiang laughed coldly and was about to retreat.</p><p>“Die! A Gokudo path attack!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s body swayed like a dragon. He became one with the spear and launched a shocking attack.</p><p>This strike pierced through the void and instantly appeared in front of Sheng Qiang.</p><p>Sheng Qiang’s pupils contracted sharply. Lu Ming’s shot made him feel a fatal threat.</p><p>“Block it, block it!”</p><p>Sheng Qiang roared in his heart as he circulated his first level lower tier earth concept to the extreme. The earth spiritual energy in the world gathered madly, forming stone tablets that blocked in front of him.</p><p>In an instant, Sheng Qiang had laid down 99 stone tablets.</p><p>The earth concept was most skilled in defense.</p><p>But …</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The stone tablets were like paper under Lu Ming’s spear ray. In an instant, ninety-nine explosions rang out and ninety-nine stone tablets were pierced through, leaving holes that were bright from the front and back.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Blood light shot out and a hole appeared between Sheng Qiang’s eyebrows.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
