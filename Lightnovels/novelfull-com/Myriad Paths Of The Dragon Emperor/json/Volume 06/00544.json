In half a year’s time, the Holy star would have entered the peak King’s realm. How could Lu Ming have any hope? There’s no hope at all.”</p><p>“I think so too, but I’m still looking forward to it.”</p><p>me too. We can’t miss this opportunity in half a year!</p><p>The crowd was in a heated discussion. At this moment, sacred constellation did not say anything more. It turned around and stepped into the air, disappearing into the horizon in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“This Lu Ming has escaped again!”</p><p>Sheng Wushuang said through gritted teeth.</p><p>“Hmph, so what if you escaped this time? He’ll still die in half a year, so I’ll just let him live for another half a year.”</p><p>Sacred light snorted.</p><p>“But …”</p><p>Sheng Wushuang was still worried.</p><p>Lu Ming was simply too freakish. During this period of time, Lu Ming’s cultivation would increase explosively every once in a while. Sheng Wushuang was already a little afraid.</p><p>He was afraid that the next time they met, he would not know what level Lu Ming had reached.</p><p>“Even if Lu Ming has some talent, do you really think that he can catch up to the young master of Xingchen in just half a year? That’s impossible.”</p><p>Sheng Yao said.</p><p>“Not bad, not bad!”</p><p>Sheng Wushuang kept consoling himself, but he was still very nervous.</p><p>Then, the crowd slowly dispersed.</p><p>However, the news of Lu Ming challenging the Holy star in half a year’s time, as well as the news of Sheng Wushuang and Mu Lan’s marriage, spread like a hurricane.</p><p>It caused an earthquake-like sensation.</p><p>On the divine Guard battle platform.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you shouldn’t have challenged the sacred constellation.”</p><p>Mu Lan cast a reproachful glance at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, she did not know why, but she was happy. She knew that Lu Ming had challenged Sheng Wushuang mostly because of her.</p><p>“Senior Sister Mu Lan, why do you have so little confidence in me? Don’t worry, I’ll beat Sheng Wushuang up so badly that he can’t marry you in half a year.”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“You’re still so confident.”</p><p>Mu Lan rolled her eyes at Lu Ming, a smile tugging at the corners of her lips.</p><p>“AI, Senior Sister Mu Lan, by the way, why don’t you want to marry the sacred constellation? This guy, although he has an arrogant expression that makes me unhappy, but to be honest, he’s quite capable, and he’s not bad looking either. Wait, don’t tell me you’re not marrying him because you like me?”</p><p>Lu Ming stared at Mu Lan with a smile.</p><p>“Look … Take a fancy to you? Stop dreaming.”</p><p>Mu Lan pouted and her face turned red.</p><p>He then sighed. no one wanted their fate to be decided since they were young. Moreover, it’s hard to say when it comes to matters of the heart. Although the sacred constellation is a genius, it just doesn’t have any feelings for him.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Lu Ming seemed to be smiling.</p><p>“Cough cough!”</p><p>At this moment, mu xiuyuan, who was at the side, coughed a few times and said,”Shouldn’t we leave this place first?”</p><p>“Yes, yes, let’s go!”</p><p>Mu Lan’s face reddened as she hastily said.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze and smile made her a little overwhelmed.</p><p>Then, Mu Lan beckoned for the eagle in the sky to leave. She, Lu Ming, and mu xiuyuan walked down the fighting ring and headed to a Street.</p><p>“Lu Ming, where are you staying now?”</p><p>Mu Lan asked.</p><p>“You’re blocking houses in the city!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Oh, how about this? you can move to the Fourth District. You can cultivate faster in the Fourth District. I’ll arrange a courtyard for you!</p><p>Mu Lan said.</p><p>Mu Lan’s father was the palace Master of the profound sky sub-Palace, so he had the authority to arrange a courtyard in the fourth area.</p><p>Then, the three of them walked toward the fourth area.</p><p>The fourth region was separated by city walls, and experts were guarding the city gates. Ordinary people were not allowed to enter, or they would be killed without mercy.</p><p>However, with Mu Lan and mu xiuyuan leading the way, Lu Ming naturally entered the fourth area without any obstacles.</p><p>what a strong spiritual Qi of heaven and earth! What a strong will of heaven and earth!</p><p>As soon as he entered the fourth area, Lu Ming was amazed.</p><p>He found that the spiritual Qi here was so dense that it was almost tangible.</p><p>The intent realm of heaven and earth was even stronger than the Dao enlightenment Palace in the East.</p><p>It was hard for one’s cultivation not to improve after living here for a long time.</p><p>It was no wonder that there were so many experts and martial King realm experts in the younger generation of the Sheng family.</p><p>In such an environment, even a pig would be able to cultivate to a decent realm.</p><p>Mu Lan and mu xiuyuan led Lu Ming deeper into the fourth area.</p><p>Soon, they arrived in front of a courtyard.</p><p>“Miss Mu Lan!”</p><p>An old man bowed to Mu Lan at the entrance of the courtyard.</p><p>“Yes. Elder Qian, Lu Ming will be staying in this courtyard in the future.”</p><p>Mu Lan pointed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Elder Qian glanced at Lu Ming, a hint of surprise flashed in his eyes. He then nodded and said,”Yes!”</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s go in and take a look at the environment!”</p><p>Mu Lan smiled.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>The three of them walked into the courtyard.</p><p>In terms of size, this courtyard wasn’t as big as the East heaven courtyard in the East. This was normal. This was the fourth region of Tianxuan city. Its value was terrifyingly high. Naturally, it wouldn’t be that big.</p><p>However, the decorations were very elegant and very suitable for cultivation, comprehension of intent and martial arts techniques.</p><p>Lu Ming was very satisfied.</p><p>The three of them walked around and returned to the courtyard.</p><p>“Lu Ming, this token is for you. With this token, you can freely enter and exit the fourth area.”</p><p>Mu Lan took out a purple token and handed it to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming took it and kept it.</p><p>Senior Sister Mu Lan, I wonder if there are any inscription Masters in Tianxuan city. I would like to ask them to help me forge a spear.</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>The demon subduing Spear’s tip had already shattered.</p><p>As for the ordinary lower level five Spears, Lu Ming still had two of them which he had gotten from others. However, they were of lower level five and were not of much use.</p><p>of course, there are inscription Masters in Tianxuan city, and there’s more than one. What grade of spiritual weapon do you want to make? ”</p><p>Mu Lan asked.</p><p>“It’d better be a Lv 6 one!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Level 6?”</p><p>Mu Lan and mu xiuyuan were both shocked.</p><p>A sixth level spirit weapon was a spirit weapon used by sea of soul realm experts. Its power was extremely terrifying, but the materials it required were also frighteningly expensive.</p><p>Lu Ming actually wanted to refine a level-six spear?</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>His cultivation was progressing very quickly, and his true essence was too abundant, ten times that of an ordinary person. The martial skills he cultivated were also extremely overbearing, and the requirements for spirit weapons were extremely high.</p><p>Normal spirit weapons wouldn’t be able to withstand his explosive power.</p><p>The material of the demon subduing spear was already very good, but it still couldn’t withstand it.</p><p>Only a sixth-level spiritual weapon would be enough for Lu Ming to use for a while.</p><p>“Lu Ming, the price of refining a sixth-level spiritual weapon is terrifyingly high. I don’t have that many spiritual crystals on me.”</p><p>Mu Lan said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
