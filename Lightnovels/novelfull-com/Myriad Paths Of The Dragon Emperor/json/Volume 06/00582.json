He did not expect to see more than ten young men staring at him with wide eyes when the stone door opened.</p><p>“Cough, cough, excuse me, excuse me!”</p><p>Lu Ming coughed a few times and was about to walk out.</p><p>“Wait a minute, kid, Who are you?” he asked.</p><p>The blue-robed young man in the lead shouted coldly and glared at Lu Ming with hostility.</p><p>“I’m lu Ming. May I know what this place is? Um, which region is it in?”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said politely.</p><p>Since he had just arrived, Lu Ming wanted to find someone to inquire about the situation.</p><p>He prayed silently in his heart, hoping that it would be in the Tianxuan region. Even if it was not in the Tianxuan region, it would be best if it was in a large region near the Tianxuan region.</p><p>The blue-robed young man’s eyes turned even colder as he said, ” “Kid, do you think I’m an idiot? Stop talking nonsense and hand over all the treasures you’ve obtained inside.”</p><p>“Treasure? What kind of treasure?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>“Don’t play dumb with me. Hand over your storage ring and let me check it. Otherwise, don’t even think about leaving here today.”</p><p>The blue-robed youth said in a cold voice.</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows and said, ” “I didn’t take any treasures, and there’s nothing inside. Now, move aside, I’m leaving.”</p><p>“Brat, you’re asking for it the hard way. Young master Qin tried to negotiate with you, but you’re always hesitating. Are you looking for death? I’ll give you three breaths of time to hand over your storage ring!”</p><p>Beside the blue-robed young man, a skinny young man took a step forward and shouted.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes widened. There seemed to be a flash of lightning and a storm in his eyes.</p><p>The skinny young man’s expression changed drastically, and he couldn’t help but take three steps back.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and strode forward.</p><p>“You … You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The skinny young man reacted. He was actually forced to retreat by Lu Ming’s glare. He immediately felt embarrassed. He shouted angrily and clawed at Lu Ming’s throat.</p><p>The skinny young man was a King tier at the peak of Lv 7 martial King realm. He was extremely powerful and would definitely be a top genius in Tianxuan city.</p><p>However, he had encountered Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming lifted his leg and stomped.</p><p>This kick contained the power of the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps.</p><p>The skinny young man screamed and his body flew far away. He fell flat on his face and couldn’t get up for a while.</p><p>“Little brat, you have some strength. No wonder you were able to break into the core area of the puppet sect. I’ve never seen you in Hong city before. Which power are you from? how dare you hit the genius of my empyrean heaven divine Palace?”</p><p>The blue-robed young man’s eyes were like lightning as he stared at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>“The Empyrean heaven divine Palace!”</p><p>“I’m lu Ming from the Tianxuan region. I’m also an Emperor heaven Divine Guard!” Lu Ming’s eyes flickered.</p><p>“Nonsense, Tianxuan region? Why would someone from the Tianxuan region come here? do you think I’m an idiot? how dare you pretend to be the Empyrean sky Divine Guard? you’re so bold! Are you a spy sent by the sky corpse sect? If you tell me the truth, I can spare your dog life.”</p><p>The blue-robed youth berated.</p><p>it’s fine if you don’t want to tell me. Get out of my way, I’m in a hurry.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands and strode forward.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The blue-robed young man made his move. The sharp sword light was like a fairy from the heavens, and it was aimed at Lu Ming’s throat.</p><p>Fast, accurate, and ruthless!</p><p>The blue-robed young man cultivated the metal concept and had reached the early stage of Lv 9 martial King realm. His combat strength was extremely powerful.</p><p>“You’re speaking so nicely, do you really think I’m a soft persimmon?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold. A long spear appeared in his hand and he swept it across.</p><p>As the spear swept out, the entire world trembled. The blue-robed young man’s attack was instantly destroyed.</p><p>“Not good, retreat!”</p><p>The blue-robed young man’s expression changed drastically and he retreated rapidly. However, he was still one step too slow and was hit by Lu Ming’s spear. His body was sent flying like a cannonball and he only managed to stabilize himself after flying a thousand meters.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The blue-robed young man spat out a mouthful of blood and his face turned pale.</p><p>The others ‘expressions changed drastically, and they looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>The blue-robed young man was at the LV 9 martial King realm. Even in hongcheng, where geniuses were aplenty, he was considered a top-tier genius. However, he was sent flying by Lu Ming’s spear and spat out blood.</p><p>This young man who had suddenly appeared was so powerful that it shocked them.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At this moment, the sound of something breaking through the air could be heard. More than a dozen figures flew over, and in the next moment, more than a dozen beautiful women appeared in the field.</p><p>That’s right, those who had just arrived were all young women in their twenties. They had graceful figures and were beautiful.</p><p>In particular, there was a woman in a white dress in front of them. She looked to be in her early twenties, and her skin was as smooth as Jade. She was extremely beautiful.</p><p>Her white dress fluttered in the wind, like a fairy from the nine Heavens descending to the mortal world.</p><p>hehe, Qin qingfei, it seems like you’ve hit an iron wall? ”</p><p>The lady in the white dress swept her gaze across the room and stopped at Lu Ming for a moment. Then, she looked at the blue-robed young man and said with a smile.</p><p>Hmph, flying snow, you’re too late. The treasures of the puppet sect have all been taken by this brat.</p><p>The blue-robed young man, Qin qingfei, wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and snorted.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Fei Xue looked at Lu Ming, deep in thought.</p><p>the treasure of the puppet sect is no small matter. Feixue, don’t you plan to take it? ”</p><p>Qin qingfei rolled his eyes and asked Fei Xue.</p><p>He was planning to incite flying snow to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>Fei Xue smiled and said, ” there are countless treasures in the world. To get them, one needs luck and strength. Since this young hero got them first, it means that my luck is not here yet. Why should I force it? ”</p><p>How could feixue not know what Qin qingfei was thinking? How could he fall into Qin qingfei’s trap?</p><p>Seeing that Fei Xue didn’t fall into his trap, Qin qingfei was very disappointed and his face darkened.</p><p>“Brat, I don’t care which force you’re from. You’ll remember this for hurting me.”</p><p>Qin qingfei looked at Lu Ming again and left a cold sentence before turning to leave.</p><p>The young men followed behind him.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and did not mind. He had already shown mercy just now. If the other party still did not know what was good for him, then he could not be blamed.</p><p>“Young hero, how may I address you?”</p><p>Fei Xue walked towards Lu Ming and cupped her fists.</p><p>“I’m lu Ming. Miss, may I ask which region this is?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Fei Xue and the other young women were also stunned.</p><p>Fei Xue looked at Lu Ming suspiciously and asked, ” this is the Hong domain. Young hero, are you from another domain? ”</p><p>“The Grand domain?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was a little ugly.</p><p>After joining the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, Lu Ming had naturally studied the geographical distribution of the divine wilderness continent. Naturally, he knew about the Hong domain.</p><p>The Grand domain was 16 large domains away from the Tianxuan domain.</p><p>It was unknown how many tens of thousands of miles away they were. How were they supposed to return?</p><p>“To tell you the truth, I’m from the Tianxuan region and I’m also an empyrean heaven Divine Guard. I accidentally entered an ancient ruin and ended up here.”</p><p>Lu Ming came up with a random reason. If he said that he had entered another world and then came here, most people would not believe him.</p><p>“You’re from the Tianxuan region, and you’re also an empyrean heaven Divine Guard?”</p><p>Fei Xue and the others looked at each other in disbelief.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
