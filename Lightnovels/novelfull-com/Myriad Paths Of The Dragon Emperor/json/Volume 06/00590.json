That damned little bastard!”</p><p>...</p><p>Qin qingfei roared.</p><p>How could he not know that Lu Ming was trying to raise the price with him? this was a means to take revenge on him for raising the price previously.</p><p>“Eight million!”</p><p>Qin qingfei roared and called out a high price of eight million.</p><p>“Eight million and one hundred thousand!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to add another hundred thousand.</p><p>“Damn it, kid, you’re deliberately raising the price and disrupting the order of the auction!”</p><p>Qin qingfei couldn’t help but shout.</p><p>hehe, how laughable. Who said that I was trying to raise the price? this is a normal auction. You’re allowed to bid, but I’m not? ”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>This was what Qin qingfei had said to Lu Ming and feixue previously. Now, Lu Ming had returned the favor.</p><p>“Damn it, 8.3 million!”</p><p>“Eight million four hundred thousand!”</p><p>……</p><p>“Nine million!”</p><p>Qin qingfei shouted out the number hysterically.</p><p>This was already all he had. He could not add any more.</p><p>Although he still had a large number of spiritual crystals on him, they were all transferred to him by his father to bid for that precious treasure.</p><p>“Nine million? Young master Qin is indeed rich and generous. I admire you. Then, young master Qin, I will let you have it!”</p><p>Lu Ming chuckled and backed out of the auction.</p><p>Nine million was already a very high price. If he continued to raise the price, Lu Ming was afraid that Qin qingfei would not want it anymore.</p><p>In the end, the 2000 pieces of metal intent crystals were won by Qin qingfei with a price of 9000000 Supreme-grade spirit crystals.</p><p>“Good, time is fast. We’ve come to the last item for today. This item is a rare treasure.”</p><p>Feng Xiu’s voice resounded throughout the entire scene, and everyone’s spirits were lifted.</p><p>Most of the people knew that they were not qualified to participate in the final bidding, but they wanted to watch the show and broaden their horizons. In the future, they would have an extra capital to brag to their acquaintances.</p><p>Many people opened their eyes wide, waiting for Feng Xiu to take out the last treasure.</p><p>Lu Ming was also looking at it with great interest. He wanted to see what the last treasure was.</p><p>At this moment, Feng Xiu’s palm glowed and a Jade bottle appeared in her hand.</p><p>“A Jade bottle? Could it be some kind of medicinal pill or spiritual liquid?”</p><p>Everyone guessed in their hearts.</p><p>“Haha, I won’t keep you all in suspense. This bottle is … The elixir of life!”</p><p>Feng Xiu’s eyes swept across the entire scene as she spoke word by word.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>As soon as Feng Xiu’s words fell, the entire place burst into an uproar.</p><p>“What? Life potion? The legendary water of life that can resurrect the dead?”</p><p>the elixir of life is a peerless treasure. No matter how serious the injury is, the elixir of life can heal it very quickly? ”</p><p>“How is that possible? Oh my God, is this for real?”</p><p>……</p><p>At the scene, there were countless exclamations and shocked voices.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In guest Room No. 10, Lu Ming stood up abruptly and looked outside, his eyes glowing with a scorching light.</p><p>Elixir of life, it was actually the elixir of life, he had to get it.</p><p>With the elixir of life, the injuries to Lu Yuntian’s meridians would definitely be able to heal, and he would be able to embark on the path of martial arts once more.</p><p>He had long since made a vow to find the treasure that could cure Lu Yuntian. However, he had never encountered such a natural treasure. Now, he had.</p><p>elixir of life, it’s actually the elixir of life. Haha, father has great foresight. This time, I must get it!</p><p>In guest Room No. 5, Qin qingfei stood up as well. His eyes were burning with passion.</p><p>Everyone was boiling with excitement, their eyes burning with passion.</p><p>everyone, this bottle of elixir of life is not pure. It’s diluted, and the concentration is only one-tenth of the pure elixir of life.</p><p>besides, reviving the dead is just a rumor. No matter how much pure elixir of life you use, it’s impossible, let alone diluted elixir of life. But there’s one thing I’m sure of, even diluted elixir of life can heal any physical injury. Even if your arm is cut off, as long as you put a drop of diluted elixir of life on the wound, it can be reconnected and healed perfectly!</p><p>Feng Xiu loudly introduced.</p><p>Even so, everyone’s enthusiasm was still high.</p><p>A diluted elixir of life was a Supreme treasure.</p><p>alright, let’s start the bidding. The starting price is 5000000 Supreme spiritual crystals. Each increment must be at least 200000 Supreme spiritual crystals!</p><p>Feng Xiu announced.</p><p>“Five million five hundred thousand!”</p><p>“Five million eight hundred thousand!”</p><p>“Six million!”</p><p>…….</p><p>Instantly, someone made a bid.</p><p>The secret Chamber of Commerce had long since announced that there would be a Supreme treasure up for auction. Although they hadn’t clearly stated what treasure it was, it still attracted the interest of many people.</p><p>Many rich people had already prepared spiritual crystals and were waiting here.</p><p>Just like Qin qingfei.</p><p>No one had placed a bid before, but now that the elixir of life had appeared, people began to place their bids.</p><p>The elixir of life, even if it was diluted, if used well, it was equivalent to having one more life.</p><p>Who wouldn’t be tempted?</p><p>With the elixir of life, he would be able to explore even more dangerous Forbidden lands and ruins in search of even more precious treasures.</p><p>The price was skyrocketing at a terrifying speed.</p><p>Not long after, it broke through the sky-high price of nine million for two thousand gold element intent crystals and charged up to ten million.</p><p>“Eleven million!”</p><p>Qin qingfei roared.</p><p>“Eleven million five hundred thousand!”</p><p>Immediately, someone raised the bid by 500000, not giving in at all.</p><p>manager Wu, quickly send a message to my father and ask him to transfer another 20 million Supreme spiritual crystals to me. I must get the elixir of life today!</p><p>Qin qingfei said to the middle-aged man.</p><p>“Yes, second young master!”</p><p>The middle-aged man quickly took out a voice transmission jade talisman and began to transmit his voice.</p><p>The price continued to rise.</p><p>Very quickly, the price shot up to a terrifying 15 million. However, there were still many people competing.</p><p>“Fifteen million five hundred thousand!”</p><p>Qin qingfei roared.</p><p>“16 million!”</p><p>The price was still rising.</p><p>When the price reached 20 million, the number of bidders finally decreased.</p><p>Many people sighed. 20 million. This price was too terrifying. Even if they wanted to, they had no way of competing.</p><p>Those who did not have the financial resources to compete were also excited.</p><p>20 million Supreme spiritual crystals was an astronomical figure for most people.</p><p>However, it was extremely rare to see so many people paying such a price for a treasure. Being able to see it with their own eyes was also a form of bragging.</p><p>At this moment, there were only three people left in the competition.</p><p>Qin qingfei was one of them.</p><p>“23 million!”</p><p>When Qin qingfei called out the sky-high price of 23 million, another person backed out.</p><p>When Qin qingfei called out 25 million, the last person also backed out.</p><p>haha, the elixir of life is mine. You want to compete with the Qin family in wealth? dream on!</p><p>Qin qingfei laughed.</p><p>“26 million!”</p><p>At this moment, a clear and firm voice was heard.</p><p>Lu Ming finally started to bid.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
