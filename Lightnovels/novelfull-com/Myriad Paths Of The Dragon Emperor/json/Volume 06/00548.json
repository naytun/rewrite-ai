Lu Ming’s concept of fire had reached the peak of level one lower tier in one go.</p><p>...</p><p>The next step would be level one upper tier.</p><p>the fire concept is at the peak of lower Lv 1 cultivation realm. Does that mean I can raise my cultivation to the peak of Lv 6 martial King realm now? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes sparkled and he was full of anticipation.</p><p>If his cultivation had reached the peak of the sixth level of the martial King realm, Lu Ming was absolutely confident that he could fight against a King of the upper tier. Even a King of the upper tier of the seventh level of the martial King realm would not be his match.</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming immediately took out a large number of top-grade spirit crystals. He planned to increase his cultivation level first before going to the weapon forging sect.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>A total of 50000 pieces of top-grade spirit crystals exploded. The nine Dragon bloodline roared and devoured all the energy of the 50000 pieces of top-grade spirit crystals.</p><p>Then, he began to refine it crazily.</p><p>However, an hour later, Lu Ming opened his eyes and stopped cultivating. His eyes were full of doubts.</p><p>“What’s going on? Why is it that 90% of the energy in the spirit crystal has dissipated and can’t be absorbed? why is it that the improvement of cultivation level is extremely slow?”</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his eyebrows tightly.</p><p>When he was cultivating just now, he realized that most of the energy converted from the spiritual crystals could not be absorbed and converted into vital essence. Instead, it overflowed from his body and dissipated.</p><p>Most of the 50000 spiritual crystals had been wasted.</p><p>Lu Ming had never encountered such a situation before.</p><p>mentality, wind mentality. When I was training just now, the fire and Thunder mentality were too strong, while the wind mentality was too weak. It formed a huge gap, which led to the loss of energy!</p><p>Lu Ming kept thinking in his mind and finally came to this conclusion.</p><p>but in the past, my Thunder concept was the only outstanding one. The other two concepts didn’t condense any concept runes, and I didn’t have this situation? What’s going on?”</p><p>could it be that the other two intents didn’t form intent runes at that time, so there was no problem? but once they both formed intent runes, this situation occurred? ”</p><p>“Yes, that must be it.”</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming shook his head and smiled bitterly.</p><p>The disadvantages of cultivating many different intents were finally starting to show.</p><p>When all of the intents condensed into intent runes, all of the intents had to be maintained at a rough balance in order to increase cultivation. If multiple intents lost their balance, it would be very difficult to increase cultivation.</p><p>Right now, the fire concept was much stronger than the wind concept. It had exceeded a certain level.</p><p>It was no wonder that others said that cultivating several concepts at the same time would become more difficult in the later stages.</p><p>This didn’t just mean that there would be a huge resistance when forming intent runes. That was only one of the reasons.</p><p>And when many wills were condensed into will runes, an even greater disadvantage appeared.</p><p>He had to cultivate many different intents at the same time to maintain balance in order to raise his cultivation.</p><p>“If you give up on other domains and only cultivate one domain after you form all the domain runes, then no matter how high your domain is, it will be very difficult for your cultivation level to increase.</p><p>If someone wanted to improve one intent first, then improve their cultivation, and then go back to improve the other intent, it would not work.</p><p>This was equivalent to stepping on a road of no return. Once you set foot on it, you would have to walk to the end.</p><p>However, a person’s energy was extremely limited, and so was his lifespan.</p><p>He had to maintain multiple intents at the same time in order to raise his cultivation. This speed was too slow.</p><p>In history, there were people who cultivated many intents at the same time, but in the end, because they had to comprehend every intent, their cultivation speed was extremely slow. In the end, their lifespans ran out, and they died.</p><p>Some people were also peerless geniuses. If they cultivated only one intent realm, their achievements would be limitless. However, in the end, they were too ambitious and died on this path.</p><p>There were too few people who could walk this path, and they were all rare geniuses.</p><p>nest, if I had known, I wouldn’t have cultivated the concept of fire to such a high level.</p><p>Lu Ming was somewhat speechless.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not too worried. He had the path-understanding ancient tree. Even if he cultivated three concepts at the same time, he would be faster than others.</p><p>Moreover, as long as the path-understanding ancient tree grew, the speed of his comprehension of the essence realm of heaven and earth would be even faster.</p><p>forget it. Next, I’ll focus on comprehending the wind mentality. I wanted to put the wind mentality aside, but it seems that I can’t.</p><p>“I’d better head to the weapon forging sect first. I’ll cultivate as I travel!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>Lu Ming got up and left the courtyard.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming left Tianxuan city, rose into the air, and flew North.</p><p>The weapon forging sect was located in the North of the Tianxuan region, at the intersection of the central and Northern parts of the Tianxuan region. It was extremely far from Tianxuan city.</p><p>Now, the northern part of the palace had long been occupied by the heavenly corpse sect, and the vast territory was completely under the control of the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>Right now, the region where the weapon forging sect was located was at the forefront of the battle between the Empyrean divine Palace and the heavenly corpse sect. It was extremely chaotic there.</p><p>Lu Ming was not in a hurry. Not long after he left Tianxuan city, he rushed into a huge mountain and captured a Storm Eagle at the half-step King realm. He sat cross-legged on the storm Eagle and headed towards the weapon forging sect.</p><p>The speed of the gale Eagle was extremely fast. A Gale Eagle of the half-step King realm was not any slower than some of the martial Kings. It also had excellent endurance. Lu Ming could use it to travel while cultivating and comprehending the intent of wind at the same time.</p><p>Lu Ming took out the path-understanding ancient tree and placed it by his side. He then took out a wind ultimacy crystal.</p><p>He had a total of forty wind intent crystals on him, all of which he had won from the bet with the Sheng clan.</p><p>He crushed the esoteric crystal and started to comprehend the concept of wind.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming hurried on his journey and cultivated at the same time. Time flew by and in the blink of an eye, a month had passed.</p><p>In a month’s time, he’d refined all forty wind attribute intent crystals, and his wind intent had also made a breakthrough. He was only one step away from the initial stage of level one.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had also arrived at the territory near the weapon forging sect. This territory was in the middle of the war between the Empyrean divine Palace and the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>The weapon forging sect was also a subsidiary force of the Emperor heaven divine Palace. Naturally, they would stand on the side of the Emperor heaven divine Palace and oppose the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Lu Ming patted the gale Eagle that he had been riding for a month. Then, he moved and flew forward alone.</p><p>At this point, the gale Eagle was no longer of any use.</p><p>Hu! Hu!</p><p>Lu Ming had not flown for long when he heard the sound of something breaking through the air. Two huge coffins stopped in front of him.</p><p>They were from the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>hehe, I’m in luck today. I just came out for a walk and met a little brat. He seems to have a good cultivation level. I can take him back and use him as a new corpse refining target!</p><p>A dry laugh came from the coffin.</p><p>“This one should be mine today. The next one should be yours!”</p><p>An unpleasant voice came from the other coffin.</p><p>alright, I’ll let you have it. Let’s finish this quickly and get rid of this little brat. Then, we’ll go elsewhere to see if there’s any prey!</p><p>The voice from the coffin came out again.</p><p>“The prey you’re talking about, is it me?”</p><p>Lu Ming had a faint smile on his face.</p><p>nonsense. Who else could it be if not you? little brat, don’t even think about escaping. You can’t escape from the two of us.</p><p>The shriveled voice from before sounded again.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
