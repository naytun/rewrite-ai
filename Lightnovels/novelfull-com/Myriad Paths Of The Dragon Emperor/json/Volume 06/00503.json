Lu Ming booked the place for two months and spent 6000 top-grade spiritual crystals.</p><p>...</p><p>After entering the Dao enlightenment Palace, the Dao of heaven and earth floated. In the end, the intent realms of wind, fire, and Thunder appeared particularly clearly.</p><p>Lu Ming took out the path-understanding ancient tree and placed it in front of him. Then, he cast aside the fire and Thunder concepts and focused on comprehending the wind concept.</p><p>After a long while, Lu Ming opened his eyes and there was a flash of joy in his eyes.</p><p>As expected, the effect of the ancient tree of comprehension could be superimposed with the artistic conception here. It made Lu Ming’s comprehension speed faster. It was at least thirty times faster than before.</p><p>Thirty times. In other words, one day of Lu Ming’s current comprehension was equivalent to one month of his previous comprehension.</p><p>One day was equivalent to one month. How shocking was this?</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming seized every minute and second to comprehend.</p><p>As the days went by, Lu Ming’s comprehension of the concept of wind was rapidly improving.</p><p>A month later, it was equivalent to two and a half years of Lu Ming’s cultivation in the past.</p><p>After two and a half years of comprehending the wind concept, he had finally comprehended the wind concept to the point where he could condense concept runes.</p><p>start! Condense intent runes!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The concept of wind filled the air and then completely converged. It began to condense in Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness.</p><p>Two hours later, an inch-long green rune was formed.</p><p>This time, there was no Heavenly Tribulation. Everything was calm. Just like that, Lu Ming’s second concept rune was successfully condensed.</p><p>it’s so cool. It’s so cool to comprehend here. If I have enough Supreme-grade spirit crystals, I can cultivate in seclusion here for a few years. Will I be able to comprehend a will to the completion of level one? ”</p><p>Lu Ming secretly sighed.</p><p>however, I’m still too slow. I don’t have much time. It’s been more than a year and a half since the ten-year deadline. It’s almost two years now. Even at this speed, I won’t have the strength to compete with Martial Emperor Di Yi by the time the ten-year deadline is up!</p><p>I need to be faster. The more leaves the path-understanding ancient tree has, the stronger its ability to help people comprehend the path. It seems that in the future, I need to find more treasures like spiritual liquid that can cultivate spiritual herbs to speed up the growth of the path-understanding ancient tree.</p><p>All sorts of thoughts flashed through Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>Shaking his head, Lu Ming suppressed these thoughts for the time being and continued to comprehend.</p><p>This time, he began to comprehend the concept of fire.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, more than twenty days had passed. Lu Ming’s fire concept had also begun to improve rapidly.</p><p>On this day, the space around them started to tremble.</p><p>“They’re trying to teleport me out. What’s going on? It’s clearly not time yet, there’s still a few more days!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and put away the martial arts ancient tree. He was full of doubts.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>After a dozen breaths, the space trembled and Lu Ming disappeared. The next moment, he appeared outside the Dao enlightenment Palace.</p><p>Lu Ming, the messenger from the profound sky sub-Palace is here to look for you. You have to come out earlier. You have six days. I’ll return the 600 Supreme spiritual crystals to you!</p><p>One of the Dao enlightenment Palace’s Guardian elders waved his hand and 600 top-grade spirit crystals flew towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming reached out to take it, but his heart was full of doubts.</p><p>an emissary from the profound sky sub-Palace? ”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>The profound heavens sub-Palace was the main headquarters of the Emperor heaven divine Palace in the profound heavens region.</p><p>It was said that in the early days, there was only one branch Palace of the Emperor heaven divine Palace in a large region. For example, in the Tianxuan region, there was only one branch Palace set up in the most prosperous place in the central part of the Tianxuan region.</p><p>Later on, because the territory of a large region was too vast, a few small sub-palaces were set up in various places.</p><p>The Tianxuan region had set up a small palace in each of the four directions to help manage the four territories.</p><p>However, the real core was still in the Tianxuan sub-Palace.</p><p>The four sub-palaces had to obey the orders of Tianxuan sub-Palace.</p><p>Now, the Tianxuan sub-Palace had actually sent an emissary to look for him?</p><p>“Could it be the Sheng family?”</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea and thought of the Sheng family.</p><p>That was the only possibility.</p><p>“The Sheng family is finally going to make a move? I’d like to see what kind of tricks you’ll use.”</p><p>There was a sharp glint in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a figure rushed over from the distance and appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re finally out of seclusion. Go to the missions Hall now, there’s a mission for you!”</p><p>The person who came was a Deacon of the mission Hall. He looked middle-aged and spoke.</p><p>“Senior, what kind of mission is it that you want me to come out of seclusion in such a hurry?”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>“AI! A few months ago, the heavenly corpse sect launched a large-scale invasion into the Tianxuan region. In the central region of the Tianxuan region, they have already fought many battles with the Tianxuan sub-Palace and suffered heavy losses.”</p><p>this time, the profound sky sub-Palace has issued a mobilization order to the four sub-palaces to transfer a portion of the Emperor sky divine guards to the central region as reinforcements. Your name is also on the list of people to be transferred!</p><p>The middle-aged Deacon had a good impression of Lu Ming and explained everything to him in detail.</p><p>“My name was indicated?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>According to common sense, Tianxuan sub-Palace only needed to tell the eastern sub-Palace a specific number for this kind of selection task. The eastern sub-Palace would arrange the number of experts by themselves. Why would they specify the name of the person?</p><p>This was obviously intentional.</p><p>Lu Ming was certain that this was definitely the Sheng family’s doing.</p><p>Then, the two of them walked toward the mission Palace Hall.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Lu Ming saw the wind Palace Master at the entrance of the missions Hall.</p><p>“Hall Master!”</p><p>The middle-aged Deacon bowed to the wind Palace Master.</p><p>yes! the wind Palace Master nodded and said, ” you can go in first. I have something to say to Lu Ming!</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The middle-aged attendant bowed and walked into the mission Palace Hall.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m sure you already have a rough idea of the matter!”</p><p>The palace Master of wind said.</p><p>“It’s probably clear now!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>this time, you must be careful. The profound sky sub-Palace has asked you to go with them. This is definitely the doing of the Sheng family. Moreover, the Sheng family used the excuse of supporting the profound sky sub-Palace and destroying the sky corpse sect as an excuse. Even the palace Master can’t refuse!</p><p>as for the central continent, the Sheng family is extremely powerful. They just want to call you to the central continent so that they can deal with you however they want!</p><p>The wind Palace Master said with a grave expression.</p><p>“They won’t let a few of the older generation Kill me, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>of course not. Although the Sheng family is strong, they still have some scruples. However, the younger generation doesn’t have such scruples. Furthermore, if they play any tricks, it’s impossible to guard against them!</p><p>The palace Master of wind said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. The older generation would not make a move openly. It was much easier for the younger generation.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately thanked the wind Palace Master.</p><p>The wind Palace Master had repeatedly reminded Lu Ming to be careful in the middle region and to keep a low profile.</p><p>Lu Ming naturally nodded in agreement and walked into the missions Hall.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
