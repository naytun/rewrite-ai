This altar was clearly destroyed by that claw. What does it have to do with me?”</p><p>...</p><p>The muscular man said. After he finished speaking, he took a few more sips of wine.</p><p>He was unruly and wild.</p><p>nonsense! You’re the one who attracted that claw. No, I suspect that you’re using a smokescreen. You’re the one who condensed it. Now, surrender!</p><p>Qin qingfei’s eighth uncle shouted.</p><p>The robust man’s eyes swept around, and he actually laughed, it seems that you have a good show to watch here. Come on, let’s do it one by one. When you’re done, we can talk about my business!</p><p>Then, he took out a chair, sat down, and drank a few more mouthfuls of wine.</p><p>good wine, it’s really good wine. Do you guys want a few sips? it’s free!</p><p>The robust man looked around and said.</p><p>playing the fool! Attack and take him down!</p><p>Qin qingfei’s eighth uncle roared.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Hundreds of iron-armored soldiers shouted, and their momentum was like a rainbow. Hundreds of powerful Zhen Yuan converged and actually formed a huge palm, which grabbed at the robust man.</p><p>This was a combined attack. With hundreds of soldiers working together, even a peak-tier King would be suppressed without any chance of escape.</p><p>However, the muscular man did not even bat an eyelid. He opened his mouth and took another sip of wine. Then, a drop of wine flew out. The muscular man flicked the drop of wine with his finger, and it flew towards the huge palm in the sky.</p><p>There was no sound at all, but a shocking scene appeared. When the drop of wine touched the huge palm, the huge palm dissipated without a sound.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes widened in shock.</p><p>A drop of wine could easily Destroy the Joint attack of hundreds of armored soldiers. What kind of cultivation was this?</p><p>“Spiritual ocean tier, you’re a powerful being of the spiritual ocean tier!”</p><p>Qin qingfei’s eighth uncle shouted in shock.</p><p>The muscular man did not comment and did not answer. He took two more sips of wine and said, ” continue with your business. When you’re done, we can talk about my business!</p><p>Qin qingfei’s eighth uncle’s expression was uncertain. He took out a jade talisman and sent out a few messages. Then, he said to Qin Qingshan,”Qingshan, quickly capture that brat. I’ve already sent a message to the palace Master and the others. They’ll be here soon!”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Qin Qingshan nodded and looked at Lu Ming again.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I didn’t expect that there would be an expert like you in the Tianxuan region other than the Saint planet. Now that the inter-province transportation formation has been destroyed, you can’t return to the Tianxuan region. Let’s have a good fight!”</p><p>Qin Qingshan’s fighting spirit soared to the sky, and the blade light became even more resplendent.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was fixed in the direction of the altar, feeling a little indignant.</p><p>The altar had been destroyed. It seemed that he would not be able to return in a short period of time.</p><p>Then, he looked at Qin Qingshan and said with determination, ” “If you want to fight, I’ll accompany you!”</p><p>alright, I’ll show you my peak combat strength, ice transformation technique!</p><p>Qin Qingshan shouted.</p><p>In the next moment, an even colder aura spread out from his body. His entire body seemed to become transparent, as if he had turned into a block of profound ice. Even his hair had turned white.</p><p>However, his aura had become even more powerful.</p><p>“Tianxuan region?”</p><p>The man’s eyes lit up when he heard the words ‘Tianxuan region’. He looked at Lu Ming with interest.</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>Lu Ming held the long spear in his hand, his long hair flying in the wind, and his aura was imposing.</p><p>Without saying anything else, Lu Ming took a step forward. His long spear emitted a dazzling light and expanded rapidly, becoming as huge as a mountain, blasting towards Qin Qingshan.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Qin Qingshan opened his mouth and spat out an Ice River, which rushed toward the spear radiance.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>An earth-shattering boom was heard, and the spear radiance was sent flying upward.</p><p>Lu Ming borrowed the force and flew high into the sky.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>The next moment, Qin Qingshan slashed out a vast blade light. It was extremely terrifying, and the void trembled as if it was going to be split in half.</p><p>“Nine Dragons trampling the heavens!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and took a step forward.</p><p>Then, it was the second and third step.</p><p>With three steps, the space exploded, and the blade light scattered in the air.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Qin Qingshan became one with his saber and pounced toward Lu Ming like a ray of Saber Light.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two of them crashed into each other. Their bodies retreated slightly before they crashed into each other again.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Qingshan was much stronger than before. The blade light whistled and unceasingly swept toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming wielded his spear like a dragon. The long spear danced in the air, and the Dragon’s roars reverberated as he engaged in an intense battle with Qin Qingshan.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was slowly falling into a disadvantageous position.</p><p>A peak King was also known as a half-step sea of soul realm expert. He was only half a step away from the sea of soul realm, and was extremely powerful.</p><p>In terms of combat strength, a peak King tier was two levels stronger than a peak Lv 9 martial King.</p><p>As for Qin Qingshan, he was a peerless heaven’s favorite to begin with, and he could fight against opponents two levels above him.</p><p>Qin Qingshan could kill an ordinary peak-tier King with a single move.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was strong, his cultivation was only at the peak of the ninth level of the martial King realm. He was still suppressed by Qin Qingshan.</p><p>However, it would not be easy for Qin Qingshan to defeat Lu Ming.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, dozens of moves had passed. Although Lu Ming was at a disadvantage, he still managed to withstand the attacks.</p><p>“Is this the talent on the list of top 1000 talents in the eastern barren territory? It is indeed powerful!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing.</p><p>“Brat, do you want me to inscribe an inscription for you to use true Yuan?”</p><p>Dandan whispered in Lu Ming’s ear.</p><p>“No need!”</p><p>Lu Ming responded.</p><p>His cultivation had been improving too quickly during this period of time. It could be described as crazy. His power had increased too quickly. It wasn’t so easy to control it completely. He needed some time to adapt and get used to it. Now, he could use Qin Qingshan to train his own power so that he could control it perfectly.</p><p>The battle continued, but at this moment, three figures appeared silently, exuding a terrifying aura.</p><p>Palace Master, vice Palace Master Qin, vice Palace Master Wang, you’re here. This is the person who destroyed the teleportation altar!</p><p>Qin qingfei’s eighth uncle was overjoyed when he saw the three of them. He flew over and bowed respectfully.</p><p>The person in the lead was an old man with white hair but a ruddy complexion. He was the palace Master of the Hong Yu sub-Palace of the Ditian divine Palace.</p><p>The other two were middle-aged. One was a burly middle-aged man and the other was a middle-aged woman.</p><p>The three of them had extremely gloomy expressions as they looked at the muscular man.</p><p>However, when the palace Master of the great domain sub-Palace saw the strong man, his expression changed abruptly. He was a little surprised and a little reverent.</p><p>“How dare you destroy the inter-domain teleportation array of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace? tell me, Who are you?”</p><p>On the side, the middle-aged man looked at the robust man with a gloomy expression and scolded.</p><p>“Vice Palace Lord Qin, don’t be rude!”</p><p>The white-haired Palace Master suddenly called out.</p><p>The others were stunned and looked at the White hair Palace Master in confusion.</p><p>“Haha, Lord Yan, why have you come to the Hong domain?”</p><p>The White hair Palace Master came to the man’s side, bowed, and smiled.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
