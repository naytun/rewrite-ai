Otherwise, why would he keep targeting him? ”</p><p>“Qin qingfei is obviously doing this on purpose.”</p><p>“This is getting interesting!”</p><p>There were all sorts of expressions on the scene.</p><p>Some were unhappy with Qin qingfei’s character, while others were gloating and watching the show.</p><p>“Detestable! Qin qingfei, what do you mean by this? Are you deliberately raising the price?”</p><p>Fei Xue opened the window angrily and shouted at guest room number five.</p><p>that’s flying snow. No wonder. Flying Snow’s bloodline and Qin qingfei’s bloodline are enemies. No wonder Qin qingfei would purposely increase the price.</p><p>Someone immediately recognized Fei Xue.</p><p>“Hehe, feixue, don’t you slander me. I’m bidding normally. You’re allowed to bid for the treasures, but I’m not allowed to bid? The heavenly secret auction house doesn’t have such a rule.”</p><p>Qin qingfei opened the window and sneered. He even threw a provocative look at Lu Ming with a mocking expression on his face.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>The flying snow closed the crystal window and she gritted her teeth.</p><p>“It’s fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly. He looked calm as he continued to bid, ” “One million two hundred thousand!”</p><p>In any case, 2000 pieces of gold element intent crystals would at least be worth two million top quality spirit crystals.

If you increase the price again and the other party doesn’t want it, we will have to spend more than 1.3 million Supreme spiritual crystals. I’m afraid that it will affect our future plans!</p><p>The middle-aged man advised.</p><p>Qin qingfei’s eyes flickered a few times, and he finally stopped bidding. He said in a teasing voice, ” 1.3 million for a spot. Hehe, I’ll give it to you!</p><p>Since Qin qingfei had withdrawn from the bidding, there was naturally no one else who placed a bid. The spot ended up in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>After a while, a young girl took out a token and passed it to Lu Ming.</p><p>With this token, Lu Ming could use the inter-domain teleportation array.</p><p>Lu Ming kept the token.</p><p>His face had always been calm, but beneath that calmness, there was an endless storm.</p><p>The auction continued.</p><p>The more he progressed, the more precious the treasures were.</p><p>Especially after the 210th treasure, each of them was the best of the best.

Each bid can not be less than one hundred thousand.</p><p>“Two million one hundred thousand!”</p><p>“Two million two hundred thousand!”</p><p>……</p><p>As soon as Feng Xiu’s voice fell, someone immediately began to bid. Most of the people who bid were from the VIP rooms on the second floor.</p><p>After all, more than two million Supreme spiritual crystals was an astronomical figure for most people.</p><p>The secret Chamber of Commerce had started to spread the news five or six days ago. Many people had come specifically for the two thousand gold intent crystals.</p><p>Therefore, there were many people bidding, and the competition was extremely fierce.</p><p>Fei Xue was also tempted and joined the competition.</p><p>In guest room number five, Qin qingfei’s eyes were shining with passion. no one can compete with me. The two thousand gold intent crystals are mine.</p><p>He wasn’t in a hurry to bid, and was waiting for the right moment.</p><p>The price rose steadily and soon reached the three million mark. It was still rising.</p><p>“Three million five hundred thousand!”</p><p>Fei Xue bid.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Fei Xue in surprise. It seemed that Fei Xue’s identity was not ordinary. It was considered a big deal for her to be able to fork out 3.5 million best-grade spirit crystals to celebrate a senior’s birthday.</p><p>However, someone immediately called out a price that exceeded flying Snow’s.</p><p>“Three million six hundred thousand!”</p><p>“Three million seven hundred thousand!”</p><p>……</p><p>“Four million!”</p><p>In a short while, it had broken through the four million mark.</p><p>sigh, forget it. This price is too high!</p><p>Fei Xue sighed and withdrew from the competition.</p><p>At this moment, there were still about a dozen people bidding.</p><p>These people definitely had extraordinary identities. Some of them had very old voices, and they were definitely seniors who had lived for a long time.</p><p>“Five million!”</p><p>All of a sudden, a voice reverberated through the entire area, causing the entire place to fall silent.</p><p>He had added one million Supreme spiritual crystals all of a sudden, which was terrifying.</p><p>“Qin qingfei!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. He could tell that the person who had bid was Qin qingfei.</p><p>five million. Is there anyone else? ”</p><p>Feng Xiu asked.</p><p>“Five million one hundred thousand!”</p><p>After a moment of silence, someone finally made a bid.</p><p>“Five million two hundred thousand!”</p><p>Qin qingfei raised the bid without hesitation.</p><p>“Five million three hundred thousand!”</p><p>Someone continued to bid.</p><p>The price continued to rise, and soon, it exceeded six million.</p><p>At this price, most people backed out of the bidding. Only one person was still bidding against Qin qingfei.</p><p>“Six million eight hundred thousand!”</p><p>Qin qingfei called out this terrifying price.</p><p>The man was silent for a while. In the end, he sighed and didn’t speak.</p><p>Qin qingfei’s face was filled with joy.

Naturally, he could recognize Lu Ming’s voice.</p><p>“Seven million two hundred thousand!”</p><p>Qin qingfei immediately added 200000 pieces of Supreme spiritual crystals.</p><p>“Seven million three hundred thousand!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and added another 100000 pieces of top-grade spiritual crystals.</p><p>“Seven million five hundred thousand!”</p><p>Qin qingfei added.</p><p>“Seven million six hundred thousand!”</p><p>Lu Ming added one hundred thousand Yuan each time.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
