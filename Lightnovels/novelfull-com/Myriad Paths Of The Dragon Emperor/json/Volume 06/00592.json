Heavens, it’s intent crystals again! They’re no less than that pile of gold-element intent crystals!</p><p>“How is that possible? Who was this person? I’ve never seen him before, could he be a peerless genius from some super large domain?”</p><p>“Possible? He just bid for the cross-domain token, so he must be a genius from another domain. No wonder he has so many intent crystals!”</p><p>There was another round of intense discussion.</p><p>Fei Xue, Qin qingfei, and the rest looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>President Feng, there are five thousand water attribute profound meaning crystals and five thousand gold attribute profound meaning crystals, a total of ten thousand pieces. Sell them all!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Alright, alright, I’ll take them all. I’ll pay 40 million Supreme-grade spirit crystals for 10000 intent crystals. What do you think? ”</p><p>Feng Xiu said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming agreed immediately.</p><p>40 million was not a low price. On average, 2000 Yuan was equivalent to 8 million Supreme spiritual crystals.</p><p>Although two thousand Yuan was sold for nine million Yuan previously, that was because Lu Ming was raising the price. Under normal circumstances, it might not be sold for nine million Yuan.</p><p>But now, there were even more of them, 5000 Yuan a set.</p><p>If the secret Chamber of Commerce bought it and publicized it, it would definitely sell for a higher price when it was auctioned.</p><p>After all, the more intent crystals there were, the more the price would increase.</p><p>5,000 Yuan for a set was much more tempting than 2000 Yuan for a set.</p><p>Lu Ming took out a storage ring and kept the ten thousand esoteric crystals in it. He then threw it to Feng Xiu.</p><p>Many people’s eyes were burning with desire. If this was outside, someone would have already made a move to snatch it. However, this was the secret Chamber of Commerce. Who had the courage to do so? Unless he didn’t want to live.</p><p>If they offended the secret Chamber of Commerce, even the Empyrean heaven divine Palace would not be able to protect them.</p><p>Some people looked at Lu Ming with burning eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming actually had so many ultimacy crystals on him. Did he have more?</p><p>Many people had other thoughts.</p><p>Lu Ming did not want to be so ostentatious but he could not do it. He had to get the elixir of life.</p><p>Moreover, he was going back tomorrow, so he wasn’t too worried about leaving this place.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming looked at Qin qingfei again and sneered, ” “Now, I have crystals to bid, right?”</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Qin qingfei growled. His eyes were filled with anger and killing intent.</p><p>“32 million!”</p><p>Qin qingfei gritted his teeth and continued bidding.</p><p>“33 million!”</p><p>Lu Ming increased the bid without any hesitation.</p><p>“34 million!”</p><p>“35 million!”</p><p>……</p><p>“40 million!”</p><p>In a few moments, Lu Ming had raised the price to forty million.</p><p>At this moment, Qin qingfei’s entire body was trembling. His eyes were bloodshot as he glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>quick, send a message to my father and ask him to transfer another batch of spiritual crystals!</p><p>Qin qingfei shouted at the middle-aged man.</p><p>He was no longer fighting for the elixir of life. Instead, he was competing with Lu Ming.</p><p>second young master, it’s better for you to give up. Old master just sent a message to tell you to give up. 4000000 is too high. You can’t compete for it!</p><p>The middle-aged man said.</p><p>“What? No more competition? How can we not fight?”</p><p>Qin qingfei’s body trembled, and he gritted his teeth. “What’s wrong? Are you out of crystals? If you don’t, then obediently give up!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>This made Qin qingfei so angry that he felt pain in his chest. He had lost the auction today.</p><p>“Kid, just you wait!”</p><p>Qin qingfei left these words and left with the middle-aged man.</p><p>“40 million, is there any higher bid?”</p><p>Feng Xiu’s gaze swept across the audience.</p><p>However, how could anyone bid 40 million?</p><p>Feng Xiu asked three times and finally decided that the elixir of life was bought by Lu Ming.</p><p>With the end of the elixir of life, the soul-stirring auction also came to an end.</p><p>“Haha, little brother, how should I address you?”</p><p>After everyone had left, Feng Xiu took the elixir of life and walked into guest room 10, laughing heartily.</p><p>“Junior Lu Ming greets senior Feng!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>haha, brother Lu, you’re welcome. This is your elixir of life.</p><p>Feng Xiu passed the elixir of life to Lu Ming.</p><p>He then took out a storage ring and handed it to Lu Ming. the 40 million spirit crystals for the elixir of life is just enough to offset the 10000 intent crystals. Here are 6.95 million Supreme-grade spirit crystals. Please check them!</p><p>“No need!”</p><p>Lu Ming took the storage ring and kept it.</p><p>The secret Chamber of Commerce was spread all over the continent. It had existed for countless years and its reputation was unquestionable. Lu Ming was not worried about this.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming, Fei Xue, and Feng Xiu bade their farewells and left the heavenly secret auction house.</p><p>brother Lu, you shouldn’t reveal your wealth. You’ve taken out so many intent crystals this time, so I’m afraid some people will be after you. You have to be careful!</p><p>On the way, Fei Xue warned.</p><p>“They dare to make a move in Hong city?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>in Hong city, most people wouldn’t dare to do so. However, we can’t rule out the possibility of someone taking a risk out of desperation. It’s better to be careful!</p><p>Fei Xue said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>lady feixue, I’ll be the host today. Do you want to give me face? ”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and looked at Fei Xue.</p><p>He and feixue had met by chance but she had taken care of him many times. Lu Ming felt that he could make friends with feixue.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Fei Xue also agreed.</p><p>The two of them found a restaurant and started eating and drinking to their heart’s content.</p><p>brother Lu, with your cultivation at such a young age, I’m afraid it won’t be a problem for you to be listed on the list of top 1000 talents in the eastern barren territory.</p><p>After a few glasses of wine, Fei Xue’s cheeks were red and her eyes were watery. She was extremely beautiful.</p><p>the list of top 1000 talents of the eastern barren territory? ”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered, a glint of light flashing in his eyes.</p><p>Soon, he would have a battle with Saint constellation, who was on the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>with brother Lu’s talent, I believe it’s only a matter of time before you enter the list of top 1000 talents in the eastern barren territory. Maybe you can even participate in the battle of Providence in two years? ”</p><p>Fei Xue smiled, as beautiful as a flower.</p><p>To be honest, Fei Xue’s appearance and aura were not inferior to Xie nianqing, Qiu Yue, or Mu Lan.</p><p>She was one of the most beautiful women Lu Ming had ever met.</p><p>“A battle of karmic luck?”</p><p>Lu Ming had some doubts.</p><p>This was the first time he had heard of it.</p><p>that’s right. The battle of Providence is of utmost importance. All the geniuses in the entire East barren will be participating. Not only humans, but even demons will be participating. Brother Lu, have you not heard of it? ”</p><p>Fei Xue said.</p><p>No. All the geniuses in the East continent will attend? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was very curious.</p><p>I’m not too sure myself. I only know that the battle of Providence is held once every 20 years. It doesn’t only involve the eastern barren territory, but also the central continent, Southern nether, Western Desert, and Northern Plains. However, there won’t be any competition between them. It’ll be a competition within each region. At that time, the four Overlord forces of the eastern barren territory and countless small forces will have intense competition.</p><p>“I heard that anyone who can rise above the rest in the war of Providence will become an unparalleled expert of the continent.”</p><p>Fei Xue explained.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
