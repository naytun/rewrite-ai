More than half of them were definitely peak-tier Kings, and the other half were simply terrifying. Their auras were like the abyss, and they were many times stronger than peak-tier Kings.</p><p>...</p><p>Spiritual ocean tier. Those were definitely all peerless experts at the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>The sudden appearance of so many spiritual ocean tier elites was simply terrifying.</p><p>“Not good, let’s go!”</p><p>At this moment, the expressions of the corpse guards of the heavenly corpse sect changed drastically. They screamed repeatedly and frantically fled backward.</p><p>But where could he escape?</p><p>A huge hand covered in scales came down and grabbed the flood Dragon’s corpse without any resistance. The two Lv 9 martial King corpse guards on it were like little bugs. They were grabbed and thrown into a bottle by the three-eyed creature.</p><p>The bottle wasn’t big, but the 200-meter-long flood Dragon was thrown in.</p><p>stop! Let’s talk this out! We are disciples of the heavenly corpse sect!</p><p>A corpse guard shouted.</p><p>what heavenly corpse sect? a bunch of pathetic primordial realm insects. The primordial realm will be conquered by my race sooner or later!</p><p>A tall three-eyed creature laughed loudly. He grabbed with his hand, and a few corpse guards were caught and thrown into a bottle.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate. He turned and ran.</p><p>If they were caught by these living beings, they would definitely not have a good ending.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart sank.</p><p>Lu Ming had obtained some information from the conversation between the few three-eyed creatures.</p><p>Heaven realm? The primordial realm?</p><p>Could it be that this place belonged to the heaven realm? What was heaven? Wasn’t it the world he came from?</p><p>Then how could he go back?</p><p>What were these three-eyed creatures?</p><p>Lu Ming had many doubts in his heart but he could only escape. If he was caught by the other party, he would definitely not have a good ending.</p><p>“Eh? It looks like there are many primordial realm reptiles on this deserted island. Let’s split up and capture all of them, not leaving a single one alive!”</p><p>A three-eyed creature with a terrifying aura instructed.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The other three-eyed creatures acknowledged the order.</p><p>At this time, the dozens of corpse guards had already been captured, and the dozens of three-eyed creatures scattered and flew towards the island.</p><p>Not only that, dozens of three-eyed creatures flew out of a warship and into the island.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>A three-eyed creature was flying behind Lu Ming at an extreme speed. It was so fast that the space trembled.</p><p>However, he did not notice Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming did not fly in the air. Instead, he concealed his aura and continued to fly close to the ground.</p><p>“I can see you!”</p><p>The three-eyed creature behind him let out a loud roar and struck out with its palm. A huge palm print blasted not far from Lu Ming’s right.</p><p>“Go, quickly go!”</p><p>Instantly, a few horrified roars came from that place. Five figures appeared and fled in a frenzy.</p><p>“Yes, it’s them!”</p><p>The five figures were the three people from the Xuan family and the two guardians from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace.</p><p>Obviously, the five of them had also seen Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, help, help!”</p><p>The middle-aged man from the Xuan family roared and moved closer to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Nest!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared in his heart. The other party wanted to drag him down in order to survive.</p><p>Initially, the three-eyed creature did not notice Lu Ming. However, he was discovered.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared in anger and soared into the sky. He used the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps and his speed increased dramatically.</p><p>But this way, the risk of being exposed was also greatly increased.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you left me in the lurch. You’ll die a horrible death!”</p><p>The middle-aged man from the Xuan family shouted in despair when he saw Lu Ming leaving.</p><p>“You’re so noisy!”</p><p>A huge hand grabbed the five of them and threw them into a bottle.</p><p>interesting reptile, you’re quite fast. Let’s see if you can escape from my palm!</p><p>A cold glint flashed across the three-eyed creature’s eyes as it chased after Lu Ming. Its speed was terrifyingly fast, not slower than Lu Ming’s.</p><p>“Lu Ming, hurry up. The other party is catching up.”</p><p>Dandan urged.</p><p>“I know! Don’t be noisy!”</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth and used the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps to its maximum. He took three steps in a row and his speed was unbelievably fast.</p><p>However, the three-eyed creature was still following closely behind.</p><p>that three-eyed creature is extremely powerful. Judging from its aura, it’s infinitely close to the spiritual ocean tier. I’m definitely not its match. Once I’m entangled by it, I’ll be dead when the other three-eyed creatures come.</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing.</p><p>“Dandan, aren’t you the reincarnation of a peerless expert? Is there any way?”</p><p>Lu Ming could only focus his attention on dandan.</p><p>“Of course there’s a way. I’ll now inscribe an inscription formation on your body to conceal your aura. This way, your aura will be completely concealed, and the other party won’t be able to sense you at all. Then, you can find a place to hide, and I’ll inscribe an inscription formation on you to isolate your aura.”</p><p>Dandan rolled her eyes and said.</p><p>“Then hurry up!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>Immediately after, dandan waved its claws and began to inscribe. Lu Ming continued to chase and escape.</p><p>haha, Tanbu, you can’t even catch up to a worm like you. Do you want me to help you? ”</p><p>Right at this moment, a voice rang out from nearby, and another three-eyed creature appeared.</p><p>“There’s no need for you to interfere. I’m enough!”</p><p>The three-eyed creature that was chasing after Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>“Oh, then I’ll leave it to you!”</p><p>The other three-eyed creature laughed and flew off in another direction.</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a long sigh of relief and continued to flee.</p><p>Not long after, they had flown a distance of several hundred thousand li.</p><p>“Dandan, why aren’t you done yet?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>cough, cough, I just failed. Hold on a little longer!</p><p>Dandan coughed a few times in embarrassment.</p><p>“F * ck!”</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely speechless. Along the way, dandan had already failed five times.</p><p>Lu Ming seriously doubted whether dandan could do it. Was she fooling him?</p><p>“Hey, kid, what’s with your expression? Are you doubting me? I’m one of the top ten warbeasts, with unparalleled combat strength. Inscriptions, alchemy, refining, there’s nothing I don’t know, and you dare to doubt me? If I hadn’t been injured back then, I could’ve killed these ants with a single breath.”</p><p>Dandan shouted.</p><p>“I believe you, I believe you. Hurry up!”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He could only grit his teeth and run.</p><p>After a short while.</p><p>“Alright, haha, I’ve succeeded!”</p><p>Dandan shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was covered with lines of inscriptions, which were extremely beautiful.</p><p>“Is it really useful?”</p><p>Lu Ming expressed his doubts.</p><p>“Nonsense, of course it’s useful! You can’t feel it yourself, but others definitely can’t feel the slightest bit of your Qi, not even the spiritual ocean tier, unless you’ve surpassed the spiritual ocean tier.”</p><p>Dandan said with confidence.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll believe you.”</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth and continued flying. Soon, a Lake appeared in front of him. Without thinking, Lu Ming plunged into the lake.</p><p>The lake was very deep, reaching a depth of a thousand meters.</p><p>After Lu Ming rushed into the lake, he descended to the bottom of the lake at a rapid speed. A long spear condensed in his hand and spun rapidly, like a drill, drilling into the bottom of the lake.</p><p>A hole was dug out of the bottom of the lake as if it was tofu. Lu Ming rushed in.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
