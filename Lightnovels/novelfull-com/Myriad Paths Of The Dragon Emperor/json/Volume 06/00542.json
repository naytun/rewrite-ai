Everyone looked at Lu Ming to see how he would answer.</p><p>Holy star, I think you’re not bad either. My family’s courtyard is lacking a gatekeeper. Pack up and quickly go report!</p><p>A clear voice came out of Lu Ming’s mouth, but it was like a storm that swept the entire scene.</p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p>After a long while, there was a loud noise.</p><p>“Lu Ming, he rejected it!”</p><p>not only did he refuse, he even asked the sacred constellation to guard the door for him. Heavens, how dare he.</p><p>this is just adding fuel to the fire. Not only did he refuse, but he also asked the Holy constellation to guard his door. Does he have the qualifications? ”</p><p>……</p><p>All around, there was a wave of excited discussion.</p><p>“How dare you, Lu Ming? how dare you speak to the young master of the Sheng family like that? The young master of Xingchen is looking up to you by letting you be his coachman. Many people seek knowledge but can’t get it. You actually dare to speak like this. You’re simply arrogant, ignorant, and stubborn.”</p><p>On the side, sacred glory scolded loudly.</p><p>As for Sheng Wushuang, he was about to die from laughter. He was overjoyed. He was really afraid that Lu Ming would agree to it.</p><p>“You … Rejected it?”</p><p>Saint constellation’s face was still calm, and no expression could be seen as he asked indifferently.</p><p>“Nonsense. It’s their business if the others are willing to be your dogs, but why would I, Lu Ming, do that? In this world, no one can make me a horse groom, including you, Holy star!”</p><p>Lu Ming said loudly.</p><p>As soon as this remark came out, it caused a wave of curses for a short time.</p><p>nest, how ignorant and arrogant. Who does he think he is? ”</p><p>you’re a little talented, but you really think you’re number one in the world. How ridiculous!</p><p>“He’s comparing himself to the sacred constellation.”</p><p>who does he think he is? what right does he have to be mentioned in the same breath as the young master of Xingchen? ”</p><p>At this moment, Holy star’s expression finally turned cold. With a wave of his hand, as if there was a huge magical power, the entire scene immediately quieted down.</p><p>“I gave you a chance, but you didn’t know how to cherish it. Since that’s the case, I’ll cripple you!”</p><p>A cold voice came out of Sheng Xingchen’s mouth.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the next moment, the Starlight on the Holy constellation burned like a flame, illuminating the entire sky.</p><p>“This is … Star intent realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered.</p><p>In the world, other than the nine common concepts of heaven and earth such as wind, fire, and Thunder, there were also many special concepts.</p><p>However, these special concepts were usually extremely difficult to comprehend, but their power was usually extremely powerful.</p><p>The star intent realm was such a special intent realm.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>In the next moment, the light of the stars condensed into dozens of long swords. They pierced through the air and aimed at Lu Ming’s vital parts.</p><p>Wherever the stars passed, terrifying sonic booms were created.</p><p>“You can’t take it head-on!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils suddenly constricted.</p><p>The sacred constellation was too powerful, and it was not something he could resist at all.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>Without hesitation, Lu Ming turned around and used the nine Dragons heaven-trampling steps. He took a step forward and retreated at an extreme speed. His speed was terrifying.</p><p>“You still want to leave in front of me?”</p><p>Sheng Xingchen shouted. The Starlight on his body became even more dazzling. At the same time, above Lu Ming’s head, streams of Starlight fell from the sky, condensing into a huge hand that pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>This huge hand seemed to have appeared out of thin air above Lu Ming’s head. He could not avoid it.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>Lu Ming growled. Two types of blood vessels burst forth and a lower Lv 5 spear appeared in his hand. His vital essence circulated wildly and three types of concepts burst forth. He thrust the spear at the star hand.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a deafening boom, Lu Ming’s body fell from the sky like a meteorite. He crashed heavily at the edge of the fighting ring and coughed up blood.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The lower Lv 5 spear in Lu Ming’s hands shattered into pieces.</p><p>“A Mantis trying to block a car, overestimating your own strength. It’s just a meaningless struggle!”</p><p>Holy star’s eyes were indifferent. He stood in the void with his hands behind his back, looking down at Lu Ming from above, like an Emperor who ruled over everything.</p><p>“Holy star, what the hell are you pretending for? Do you really think you’re a heaven’s favorite who can look down on everything? you’re only ranked 998th on the list of top 1000 talents, and there are a lot of people who are stronger than you. What are you so arrogant for?”</p><p>“Also, how old are you? you’re five years older than me. What’s there to be proud of? if I cultivate for another five years, I can defeat you with one finger!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared. He stood up straight and stared at the sacred constellation with bright eyes.</p><p>His words made many people’s eyes light up.</p><p>Indeed, how old was Lu Ming now? At the age of the sacred constellation, it would be too exaggerated to say that a finger could suppress the sacred constellation, but it might not necessarily be unable to reach the height of the sacred constellation.</p><p>Previously, everyone had witnessed Lu Ming’s combat strength and talent.</p><p>Some people felt that Lu Ming had the potential to be on the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>“You’re quite self-confident. On the path of martial arts, one step is stronger than the other. You will never be my opponent. Hehe, I’m not interested. So, I’ll just cripple you first!”</p><p>A cold voice came out of Sheng Xingchen’s mouth. Starlight surged around him, and he was about to launch the next wave of attack.</p><p>it seems that I can only use the Thunder cauldron. With my current cultivation, I can definitely kill the sacred constellation with a single strike if I use the Thunder cauldron. However, I’ve also lost the power to resist. But now, I have no choice!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with ruthlessness. He immediately focused his mind and communicated with the lightning cauldron.</p><p>Between Lu Ming’s brows, a faint light flickered with wisps of lightning energy. He could control the lightning cauldron at any time to deliver a fatal blow.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>At this moment, a soft shout was heard.</p><p>Gah!</p><p>Immediately after, a bird’s cry was heard.</p><p>Everyone saw a large green Eagle flying over at high speed.</p><p>Two figures were standing on the Eagle.</p><p>“Mu xiuyuan, and Senior Sister Mu Lan!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>The two people on the Eagle’s back were Mu Lan and mu xiuyuan.</p><p>“That’s miss Mu Lan!”</p><p>“What is miss Mu Lan doing here?”</p><p>Many people were curious.</p><p>Sacred constellation’s eyes flickered slightly, and the Starlight on his body also calmed down, not continuing to attack.</p><p>Gah!</p><p>The Condor screeched, and in the next moment, it appeared in the sky above the divine Guard fighting ring.</p><p>Mu Lan and mu xiuyuan jumped down from the Eagle’s back and appeared on the divine Guard fighting ring.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you alright?”</p><p>Mu Lan immediately walked toward Lu Ming with a look of concern in her eyes.</p><p>“It’s just a small injury. I’m fine. Senior Sister Mu Lan, it’s been a long time since we last met.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>It had been more than a year since he last saw Mu Lan. She had become more mature and charming. The curves on her body were even more shocking. One look at her and one would be unable to suppress the urge in their heart.</p><p>Countless eyes were fixed on Mu Lan from all around.</p><p>it’s been a long time indeed. Lu Ming, I didn’t expect you to come this far. You didn’t disappoint me.</p><p>Mu Lan revealed a faint smile.</p><p>LAN ‘er, get out of the way. This brat has injured many of our Sheng family’s heroes. He’s too arrogant. Let me cripple this brat first.</p><p>Holy constellation coldly spoke.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
