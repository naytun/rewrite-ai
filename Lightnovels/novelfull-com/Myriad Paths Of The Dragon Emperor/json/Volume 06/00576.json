Lu Ming retreated a thousand meters. His qi and blood churned, and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>...</p><p>what powerful strength! When this flood Dragon was alive, it was definitely a peak existence at the spiritual ocean tier!</p><p>Lu Ming wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and stared at the flood Dragon’s corpse with a grave expression.</p><p>The flood Dragon’s corpse was extremely powerful and invulnerable. The three corpse guards didn’t even use much of the flood Dragon’s strength, but that attack should have reached the peak-tier King level.</p><p>Previously, in the ancient desolate city, more than a dozen Kings from the big cities had controlled it together, which was powerful and almost close to the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>Such a powerful refined corpse would only be able to display its true strength when it controlled more people.</p><p>“So strong?”</p><p>The three corpse guards on the flood Dragon’s corpse were also extremely shocked.</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>The old corpse guard roared angrily and controlled the flood Dragon’s corpse to continue attacking Lu Ming.</p><p>“Do you think I’ll still go head to head with you?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a mocking smile. His figure flashed and he charged at the other corpse guards.</p><p>The devouring power of the nine Dragons ‘bloodline erupted madly, and the corpse guards’ blood essence was devoured one after another, dying here.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The flood Dragon’s corpse controlled by the three corpse guards could not catch up with Lu Ming’s speed at all.</p><p>Lu Ming used the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps. With one step, he traveled ten miles in an instant. Large swaths of corpse guards were harvested by Lu Ming like wild grass.</p><p>Before long, Lu Ming had killed more than two hundred corpse guards.</p><p>A total of over three hundred corpse guards, how long had it been? More than two hundred died.</p><p>The remaining corpse guards cried out in alarm and scattered in all directions.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming took two steps forward. In a flash, he appeared above the flood Dragon’s corpse and thrust his spear at a Lv 9 martial King corpse guard.</p><p>The corpse guard roared in shock and exploded out with corpse Qi, forming dozens of corpse Qi shields in front of him.</p><p>However, it was useless. The spear radiance pierced through and the shield exploded. The head of the corpse guard also exploded like a watermelon.</p><p>At this moment, the claws of the flood Dragon’s corpse reached out to grab Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming swept his spear horizontally and hit the claw of the flood Dragon. He borrowed the force to retreat backward, a trace of blood flowing from the corner of his mouth.</p><p>“Not good, let’s go! Hurry up and run!”</p><p>There were still two Lv 9 martial King realm corpse guards on the flood Dragon’s corpse. They were so shocked that they did not dare to fight Lu Ming. They controlled the flood Dragon’s corpse and chose a direction to escape in a hurry.</p><p>The three of them were controlling the flood Dragon’s corpse, but Lu Ming had killed one of them. Now, there were only two of them left. The power of controlling the flood Dragon’s corpse was even weaker. They did not dare to fight Lu Ming anymore. If they did not escape, they would probably die.</p><p>Dozens of corpse guards also followed the flood Dragon corpse and fled in the direction of the ocean.</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a sneer. Those people were in a panic and actually ran in the direction of the sea. They were simply courting death. He was in no hurry to give chase. He used the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps and chased after the corpse guards in the other directions.</p><p>After a while, Lu Ming killed dozens of corpse guards. He then chased in the direction of the sea.</p><p>He used the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps, and his speed was extremely fast. Soon, he saw the people of the heavenly corpse sect who were fleeing.</p><p>“He’s coming! Run! Run!”</p><p>The old corpse Guard’s expression was very unsightly as he madly controlled the flood Dragon’s corpse to escape.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Deafening rumbles of waves came from ahead.</p><p>“Ocean!”</p><p>The old corpse Guard’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>He was similar to the other corpse guards.</p><p>“Charge, charge into the ocean!”</p><p>The old corpse guard roared in anger. They had the flood Dragon’s corpse and planned to charge into the sea to gamble.</p><p>As long as they hid in the flood Dragon’s corpse, they might be able to survive in the sea.</p><p>They charged towards the sea at top speed, but stopped when they reached the shore.</p><p>The ship!</p><p>They saw the ship.</p><p>In the depths of the ocean, they saw three huge ships sailing toward them.</p><p>Even Lu Ming stopped in his tracks, his eyes filled with shock.</p><p>Did having a boat mean that they could leave this damn place?</p><p>Lu Ming stopped his pursuit of the corpse guard.</p><p>The three ships were heading in their direction at high speed. They were getting closer and closer. Lu Ming and the rest were more and more shocked.</p><p>Those were no ordinary ships. They were clearly three warships, each of which was huge and awl-shaped. The deck alone was more than a thousand meters above the water.</p><p>It was black in color and seemed to be made of a strange metal. There were some strange creatures carved on it that Lu Ming had never seen before.</p><p>The terrifying waves and strong winds had no effect on the three warships.</p><p>Three battleships were riding the wind and waves.</p><p>haha, we’re saved! We can go out!</p><p>Some corpse guards laughed wildly and rushed towards the seaside in ecstasy, getting closer and closer to the sea.</p><p>“Wrong, wrong!”</p><p>On Lu Ming’s shoulder, dandan’s eyes were filled with suspicion as she mumbled to herself.</p><p>“What’s wrong? If someone is here, it means we can leave this Island.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with anticipation.</p><p>“No, no. I’m familiar with the auras of these three battleships. They’re the auras of my enemies.”</p><p>Dandan muttered, as if she was trying hard to recall something.</p><p>But he couldn’t think of anything at the moment.</p><p>“Lu Ming, trust me. It’s dangerous to retreat!”</p><p>Dandan said in a rare serious tone.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered as he muttered to himself. In the end, he retreated a few dozen miles and appeared on a cliff, looking into the distance.</p><p>At this moment, the battleship was getting closer and closer. As it got closer, the terrifying pressure emitted by the battleship could be felt even more.</p><p>The flood Dragon’s corpse was huge enough, but in front of this huge warship, it was like a worm.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The waves were broken apart, and the three warships stopped dozens of miles away from the sea.</p><p>Many corpse guards looked on with eager eyes.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At this time, many figures flew out of the warships and appeared in the sky above the ocean.</p><p>“Who’s that?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly narrowed, revealing a look of shock.</p><p>Because the figures that rushed out of the warship were not human at all.</p><p>Although they were in the form of humans, each of them was more than two meters tall. Their bodies were covered in black scales. In terms of body size, they were similar to the scaled demons in the scaled demon dimension that Lu Ming had seen before.</p><p>What was different was that these figures had two sharp horns on their heads that emitted a sharp light. In the middle of their brows, there was a third eye.</p><p>the general is right. There is indeed an abnormality on sky horizon Island. Some reptiles have appeared.</p><p>A burly three-eyed creature spoke. His words were exactly the same as Lu Ming’s.</p><p>how did these crawlers appear? could they have come from the primordial realm? ”</p><p>it’s very possible. Amazing, really amazing. The worms of the primordial realm actually came to the heaven realm. Haha, take them down and hand them to the general. You must ask them how they came here. Maybe you can find the entrance to the primordial realm!</p><p>The other three-eyed creatures chimed in.</p><p>After saying that, dozens of three-eyed creatures rushed to the shore. They waved their hands, and their claws suddenly enlarged and grabbed at the people of the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils contracted rapidly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
