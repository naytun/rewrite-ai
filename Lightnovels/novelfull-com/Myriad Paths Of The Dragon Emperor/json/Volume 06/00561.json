BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The powerful refined corpses kept bombarding the light curtain. The light curtain trembled but was not broken. It was firmly blocked.</p><p>“Damn it, attack!”</p><p>A late stage King level corpse guard roared and ordered the other corpse guards to control the refined corpses to attack.</p><p>However, the inscription formation was extremely strong and couldn’t be broken.</p><p>city Lord of desolation city, are you really that heartless? are you going to hide inside and watch your clansmen get killed? ”</p><p>An old corpse guard appeared and sneered.</p><p>“Ah!” “Ah!”</p><p>Around them, there were constant screams from the Xuan family.</p><p>Giggle …</p><p>The city Lord of the barren city clenched his teeth, his eyes filled with tears.</p><p>“Ah, damn it!”</p><p>The other members of the Xuan family, such as Xuan Feng, who had entered the formation, stared outside with red eyes.</p><p>don’t kill those Xuan family people first. Capture them and bring them here to kill.</p><p>The old corpse guard ordered.</p><p>Not long after, the Xuan family members were injured one by one and brought to the side of the desolate ancient tomb.</p><p>“City Lord, save me!”</p><p>Some of the more timid ones started to plead.</p><p>However, the ancient barren city clenched its fists and did not say anything.</p><p>It was said that once the desolate ancient tomb was opened, there would be a great disaster.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The corpse guard gave the order.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The iron chains were like long Spears that pierced through the air, killing all the Xuan family members.</p><p>“Ah, ah, damn it, damn it!”</p><p>Xuan Feng and the others roared.</p><p>However, not long after, another member of the Xuan family was brought over and killed on the spot.</p><p>Not only the Xuan family members, but even the palace Master of fire and the others were furious.</p><p>“Open the inscription formation and hand over the recondite steel heavy sword, and we can spare their lives.”</p><p>The corpse guard sneered.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>The ancient barren city Lord roared. His eyes were bloodshot and filled with killing intent.</p><p>“Alright, let’s continue!”</p><p>Then, more people from the Xuan family were brought in.</p><p>“Father, father, save me!”</p><p>A loud shout came from a beautiful girl in her twenties.</p><p>“Min ‘er!”</p><p>The city Lord of barren city shouted.</p><p>“Hahaha, so this is your daughter. Good, good.”</p><p>“City Lord of barren city, I wonder what kind of experience it would be to let you see your daughter and the heroes of my heavenly corpse sect having fun in public? I’m really looking forward to it. You, go. I’ll leave this beautiful task to you.”</p><p>The old corpse guard pointed at a pale-faced middle-aged corpse guard and said.</p><p>“Many thanks, elder!”</p><p>The middle-aged corpse guard was ecstatic. His eyes emitted light as he walked towards the beautiful woman.</p><p>“Don’t, don’t come over!”</p><p>The beautiful woman’s face was filled with despair.</p><p>“Bastard, you damn bastard!”</p><p>The palace Master of fire roared.</p><p>“Min ‘er, kill!”</p><p>run! Xuan Feng roared and was about to rush out, but he was pushed back by the city Lord of barren city.</p><p>remember, don’t let them enter the desolate ancient tomb. Defend the place with the formation and wait for reinforcements!</p><p>shut up! the city Lord of barren city shouted at Xuan Feng. Then, his eyes turned cold and he rushed out of the formation toward Xuan min.</p><p>“Father!”</p><p>Xuan Feng roared.</p><p>“Hehe, you’re finally willing to come out? Attack and take him down!”</p><p>The old corpse guard waved his hand, and a few late-stage King tiers controlled the refined corpses to charge at the city Lord of the barren city.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The ancient barren city Lord’s entire body emitted a blazing light. The Battle Sword in his hand slashed down, and that middle-aged corpse guard was cut into two.</p><p>With a wave of sword Qi, a Lv 7 martial King realm refined corpse was cut in half.</p><p>The city Lord’s aura was much stronger than before.</p><p>a secret technique that burns essence, Qi, and spirit. Do you want to die? ”</p><p>The old corpse guard roared.</p><p>The burning of essence, Qi, and spirit of the city Lord of desolation city was a secret skill of the Xuan family. His combat power would increase dramatically, but he would definitely not be able to last for ten minutes before he died.</p><p>“Min ‘er, follow father. Father will take you out!”</p><p>The city Lord of barren city said to the beautiful lady. He held her hand and rushed out.</p><p>“Stop him!”</p><p>The old corpse guard roared.</p><p>Immediately, the experts of the corpse guards made their move. There were five refined corpses, equivalent to Lv 9 martial King realm, and they charged toward the city Lord of the barren city.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The ancient barren city Lord held his sword with one hand and his aura was shocking. He slashed out with his sword and a shocking sword radiance burst out. A Lv 9 martial King realm demonic corpse was sent flying and was almost cut in half.</p><p>The secret skill of burning his essence, Qi, and spirit had greatly increased the combat power of the city Master of barren city. He was infinitely close to a peak-tier King. His sword Qi swept across and sent several refined corpses at Lv 9 martial King realm flying.</p><p>There were even seven to eight corpse guards on the side that were swept by the sword Qi and killed.</p><p>&Nbsp; ” die! the city Lord of barren city brought Xuan min and charged out.</p><p>retreat! Let’s work together to control the Dragon corpse!</p><p>The old corpse guard roared.</p><p>Hu …</p><p>In the sky, an incomparably huge coffin flew down. This coffin was hundreds of meters long and more than 50 meters wide. It came crashing down on the city Lord of the barren city.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>die! the ancient barren City Master slashed out with his sword, causing the coffin to explode. However, from within the coffin, a huge object emerged.</p><p>It was a hundred meters long and was covered in scales. It had two horns on its head and four claws under its belly.</p><p>The corpse of a flood Dragon. This was the corpse of a flood Dragon.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At least ten corpse guards flew onto the flood Dragon’s corpse, and corpse Qi filled the air.</p><p>These ten corpse guards were all late-stage King level corpse guards, and they were controlling the flood Dragon corpse together.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>roar! suddenly, the flood Dragon’s corpse let out a deafening roar. The roar formed a huge storm that rushed toward the city Lord of barren city.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>you … the ancient barren city Lord’s expression changed drastically. He slashed out with his sword, and the dazzling sword Qi split the storm apart. However, he also retreated frantically.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>The flood Dragon’s body moved. Its 200-meter long body rushed toward the city Lord of barren city and clawed at him.</p><p>His speed was as fast as lightning.</p><p>The ancient barren city Lord roared in anger and slashed out with a shocking sword. However, it was useless. The sword Qi was dispersed by the flood dragon’s claw. The flood dragon’s claw heavily struck the ancient barren city Lord’s body.</p><p>The city Lord of the desolate ancient city was sent flying like a cannonball, crashing heavily into the light screen of the great inscription formation in front of the desolate ancient tomb. Fresh blood spurted out from his mouth.</p><p>As for Xuan min, it went without saying that she was torn into pieces by this attack.</p><p>“Ah, ah, how could this be?”</p><p>die! the city Lord of barren city roared. He could not bear it.</p><p>“Father, min ‘er!”</p><p>Xuan Feng also roared.</p><p>In the inscription formation, everyone was in despair.</p><p>The heavenly corpse sect even had the corpse of a flood Dragon.</p><p>From the exchange just now, the flood Dragon’s corpse was too powerful, and its battle prowess was unparalleled. It was probably infinitesimally close to the spiritual ocean tier. Could this inscription formation block it?</p><p>The old corpse guard waved his hand and collected a wisp of Xuan min’s blood. He sneered, ” I have the blood of the Xuan family’s descendant. All I need is the black iron heavy sword. Continue attacking!</p><p>The old corpse guard waved his hand.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The flood Dragon’s corpse continued to attack.</p><p>&Nbsp; the ancient barren city Lord used all his strength to block this attack, but the difference was too great. He was beaten until blood spurted out, and all his bones were broken. He lay on the ground, his aura rapidly weakening.</p><p>“Get back!”</p><p>Xuan Feng roared and wanted to rush out, but he was stopped by the city Lord of the barren city.</p><p>&Nbsp; the old corpse guard walked to the city Lord’s side and used his Zhen Yuan to take the city Lord’s storage ring. In the next moment, a black iron heavy sword appeared in his hand.</p><p>hahaha, I’ve got two keys. Now, let’s attack the inscription formation!</p><p>The old corpse guard ordered.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
