He took away his storage ring and left the place.</p><p>A moment later, Lu Ming appeared tens of thousands of miles away and entered the Supreme shrine.</p><p>He sat cross-legged and began to refine the blood essence.</p><p>All the blood essence that Lu Ming had devoured during this period of time was used to improve his nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>This was because with Lu Ming’s current cultivation, the blood essence of Warriors whose cultivation levels were lower or similar to his would not be of much help to his cultivation. He might as well try his best to improve the level of his Blood Meridian.</p><p>The refined blood essence could also be used to increase the grade of his bloodline.</p><p>The nine Dragon bloodline floated above Lu Ming’s head. Its winding body was suffused with a bloody light. Six silver chakra glowed with a silver light and was resplendent.</p><p>Half an hour later, the power of the blood essence had been completely refined.</p><p>Unfortunately, his nine Dragon bloodline still hadn’t advanced. It was still at the sixth level of the king level.</p><p>almost, I feel like I’m just a little bit away!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>He felt that his bloodline of the nine Dragons was just a little bit away from advancing.</p><p>“Let’s see how many crystals there are!”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took out the storage rings of Sheng Qiang and the other six youths from the Sheng family and piled all the best-grade spiritual crystals together.</p><p>One hundred and eighty thousand!</p><p>There were a total of 180000 Supreme spiritual crystals in the storage rings of the six young men from the Sheng family.</p><p>alright, let’s continue to improve our cultivation!</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming began to refine Supreme-grade spirit crystals frantically to improve his cultivation.</p><p>After reaching Lv 3 martial King realm, the amount of energy required to advance was even greater.</p><p>Lu Ming had refined a total of 80000 pieces of top-grade spiritual crystals to advance from the early stage of the third level of the martial King realm to the middle stage.</p><p>He refined another 80000 pieces and advanced to the late Lv 3 martial King realm.</p><p>He only had 20000 Supreme spiritual crystals left.</p><p>“Sheng family, continue!”</p><p>After that, Lu Ming left the Supreme shrine and flew in the sky, planning to continue hunting the people of the Sheng family.</p><p>Since the Sheng family was hunting him, he would hunt them back.</p><p>Two hours later, Lu Ming killed five Sheng family youths in a forest.</p><p>One of them was a lower tier martial King realm advanced stage martial artist.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming received one hundred and fifty thousand pieces of top-grade items.</p><p>After finding a place, Lu Ming continued to refine Supreme-grade spirit crystals.</p><p>Not long after Lu Ming left, more than a dozen figures appeared in the sky above the forest. They were shengyu and the others.</p><p>At this moment, shengyu’s eyes were extremely cold, and the strong killing intent almost materialized.</p><p>“Damn it. Could it be that Lu Ming, that little b * stard, did it? You should die!”</p><p>Shengyu said in a cold voice.</p><p>no matter who did it, they must die. Now, call a group of people to act as bait and lure the enemy out. You guys follow me and lie in ambush in the surroundings.</p><p>Then, shengyu ordered.</p><p>Then, the dozen of them scattered and disappeared into the sky.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was fully focused on refining the Supreme-grade spirit crystal.</p><p>Not long after, another 80000 pieces of spiritual crystals were refined. Lu Ming’s cultivation had broken through to the peak of the third level of the martial King realm. After that, Lu Ming refined the remaining 70000 pieces of spiritual crystals and raised his cultivation to the limit of the peak of the third level of the martial King realm. The next step was to break through to the fourth level of the martial King realm.</p><p>Once he reached Lv 4 martial King realm, he would be a King tier in the lower tier.</p><p>However, he didn’t know how many Supreme spiritual crystals he would need to break through to the lower tier.</p><p>“Sheng family, you’ll be responsible for all the top-grade spiritual crystals I need.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. He then left the Supreme shrine and flew in the sky in search of the Sheng family.</p><p>Half an hour later.</p><p>“The Sheng family!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked ahead.</p><p>In front of him, there were five young men of the Sheng family flying at a high speed in the sky.</p><p>Lu Ming! That’s Lu Ming!</p><p>“Surround him, don’t let him escape!”</p><p>The five youths from the Sheng family surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>The person in the lead was someone Lu Ming was familiar with, Shengjiang.</p><p>“Lu Ming, where can you run to now?”</p><p>Shengjiang’s face was gloomy.</p><p>“Run? why should I run? With you guys giving me crystals, why would I run?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“What do you mean by that?”</p><p>Shengjiang’s eyes turned cold, and killing intent burst out. He shouted, ” “Could it be that you killed those two groups of people?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled but did not say anything. It was considered a silent agreement.</p><p>damn it, Lu Ming. You’ve eaten the Dragon’s gallbladder. How dare you kill so many heroes of the Sheng family? let me tell you, no one can save you. Even if the palace Master comes forward, you’re dead!</p><p>Shengjiang roared in anger.</p><p>“Hmph, your Sheng family is bent on killing me. Can’t I fight back and wait to be killed by you? How laughable. As long as I kill all of you, who will know that I did it?”</p><p>Lu Ming snorted coldly, his eyes flashing with killing intent.</p><p>“Lu Ming, who can you kill?”</p><p>At this time, an angry roar sounded in the sky.</p><p>In the clouds high up in the sky, the sound of air breaking rang out, and twelve figures appeared.</p><p>The leader was Saint Jade, and beside him was a lower tier King tier, a peak Lv 4 martial King realm expert.</p><p>Behind them, the Holy sky, holy power, and Holy Wind were all among them.</p><p>A group of people spread out in all directions and blocked all of Lu Ming’s escape routes.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze changed slightly.”So you’re trying to lure me out.”</p><p>“It’s too late to know now. This time, I won’t let you escape.”</p><p>Shengyu’s eyes were filled with killing intent, and a terrifying aura emanated from him.</p><p>peak Lv 5 martial King realm!</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze turned extremely solemn.</p><p>There was a small divide between Lv 3 and Lv 4 martial King realm. Although there was a one-level difference in cultivation, there was at least a two-level difference in combat strength.</p><p>As for the peak of the LV 5 martial King realm, it was undeniable that he was even more powerful and Lu Ming could not defeat him.</p><p>“You guys work together to set up a formation to prevent him from escaping. I’ll kill him … You … You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Shengyu had just given the order, but before he could finish, he roared.</p><p>That was because Lu Ming had suddenly made a move.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The spear radiance pierced through the air. A total of more than ten spear radiances stabbed at more than ten young men from the Sheng family.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current cultivation at the peak of the third level of the martial King realm, no one below the lower tier of the martial King realm could resist his fierce attacks.</p><p>Even if the young men of the Sheng family were all prepared to defend, it was still not enough.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere and screams were heard. In an instant, ten young men of the Sheng family were pierced by the spear radiance and fell to the ground while screaming.</p><p>Among them were Saint wind and Saint might.</p><p>On the other hand, as Sheng Kong’s cultivation was weak, he had been standing at the back earlier and thus managed to escape. However, at this moment, his face was pale and his body was trembling non-stop.</p><p>Watching the ten geniuses of the Sheng family who were stronger than him being killed, Sheng Kong was so scared that he almost peed his pants. He retreated frantically.</p><p>“Ah, damn it, die, die!”</p><p>die! the Saint Jade roared hysterically, and a terrifying aura burst out of her body. A crystal-clear and terrifying blade light slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming blocked it with his long spear, but he was struck by the saber and his body trembled.</p><p>“Kill, kill!”</p><p>The Saint Jade sword had the advantage. The sword gleams behind it swept toward Lu Ming like a storm, completely drowning him.</p><p>Lu Ming did not even have the chance to escape.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
