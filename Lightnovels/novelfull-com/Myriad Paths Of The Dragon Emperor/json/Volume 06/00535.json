Compared to Lu Ming’s smug look, there was a world of difference. There was no way to compare. They were so many levels apart.</p><p>Lu Ming was right when he said that he was a disgrace.</p><p>“How is that possible? How did this kid manage to obtain such a great harvest? he was even able to seal corpse guards at level five and level six martial King realm?”</p><p>Shengchuan couldn’t figure it out.</p><p>“How dare you, Lu Ming! What should you do?”</p><p>At this moment, sacred light suddenly roared, and the sound shook the entire scene.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were focused on the sacred glory, and they were all confused.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered as he looked at the sacred glory and said, ” “What crime have I committed?”</p><p>“What crime? You can hide it from others, but can you hide it from me? Lu Ming, with your cultivation level, can you kill a Lv 4, Lv 5, or even Lv 6 martial King corpse guard? How was this possible? If you have the ability, tell me, how did you kill him?”</p><p>Holy light said coldly.</p><p>“Hehe, I don’t think I need to explain to you how I killed them. Moreover, there’s no rule in the Empyrean heaven divine Palace that requires the Empyrean heaven divine guards to tell me how they completed their mission, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“Haha, you’re still trying to quibble? Lu Ming, with your cultivation, it’s impossible for you to kill so many corpse guards. There’s only one possibility, and that is that these soul-sealing crystals belong to someone else. They belong to other Empyrean heavens divine guards. He simply deserves to die!”</p><p>Shengyao shouted.</p><p>Everyone present was shocked and fell into deep thought.</p><p>They felt that what the sacred glory said made a lot of sense. This was the only possibility that could explain why Lu Ming had obtained so many soul-sealing crystals.</p><p>how dare you, Lu Ming! You’ve done something unforgivable. You deserve to die.</p><p>Sheng Chuan seized the opportunity and shouted.</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. He said coldly, ” “Where’s the evidence?”</p><p>“Evidence? There’s no need for evidence, this is the truth, damn it!”</p><p>Holy light shouted.</p><p>“Hahahaha!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly burst out laughing and said,”shengyao, is this how you should be an elder of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace?” Everything was just your wild speculation, and you want to convict me of a big crime. It’s simply ridiculous. According to you, in the future, as long as you don’t like the look of someone, you can convict them?”</p><p>laughable, extremely laughable. Alright then, I’ll say that you bullied the Ditian divine guards outside of the Sheng family. You’re a big bully, and you’ve forcefully taken a girl. Shengyao, how should you be punished? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice spread across the entire venue with an imposing manner.</p><p>how dare you, you little bastard! You dare to slander me!</p><p>The Holy Light roared.</p><p>haha, what venomous slander? this is the truth. You should also quickly kneel down and admit your guilt!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“You’re looking for death, little bastard. I’ll cripple you now!”</p><p>A terrifying aura burst out of the sacred glory, and its eyes were fierce, as if it was about to eat someone.</p><p>Sheng Yao, are you going to kill all the other Ditian divine guards who don’t listen to you? are you trying to get rid of all the other Ditian divine guards and dominate the Tianxuan region? are you looking down on Martial Emperor Di Yi? ”</p><p>Lu Ming circulated his quintessential essence and was ready to escape. However, he shouted and put a lot of blame on the Holy brilliance.</p><p>“Little bastard, you … You dare to slander me?”</p><p>attack! sacred glory roared, but for a moment, it did not attack.</p><p>Tianxuan city was different from the eastern Palace.</p><p>In the eastern Palace, he would be fine even if he killed Lu Ming.</p><p>However, in Tianxuan city, there was not only the Sheng clan, but also the MU clan.</p><p>On the surface, the Sheng family and the MU family were still considered good, but in the dark, they were competing with each other.</p><p>Shengyao had a lot of enemies. Not to mention the MU family, even in the Sheng family, shengyao had enemies. If he did something out of line and was caught by his enemies, he would have a hard time.</p><p>Therefore, if he attacked Lu Ming in public without any concrete evidence, he was afraid that his opponent would really catch hold of something and use it to attack him.</p><p>For a moment, his old face turned red, but he did not make a move. He was somewhat hesitant.</p><p>“Damn it, this little bastard, I’ll definitely find an opportunity to make him die without a burial place in the future!”</p><p>Holy light roared in its heart.</p><p>how dare you, Lu Ming! How dare you be so rude to the elders of the sacred glory sect! Kneel down and admit your mistake!</p><p>At this moment, shengchuan jumped out and shouted.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Lu Ming only sneered in response.</p><p>Sheng Chuan gritted his teeth and roared, ” Lu Ming, I think the divine glory elder has a point. Did you secretly harm the other Empyrean sky divine guards and take their soul-sealing crystal? ”</p><p>how about this? I challenge you now. If you can defeat me, I will admit your strength and prove that you have the ability to obtain those soul-sealing crystals.</p><p>Shengchuan said loudly, his eyes rolling as he thought of evil thoughts.</p><p>Holy light’s eyes also lit up.</p><p>He looked at shengchuan with admiration, wondering if he was muddled from anger or if this kid was smart.</p><p>In that case, if Lu Ming still did not accept the challenge, it would mean that he had a guilty conscience. They could use this as an excuse to investigate Lu Ming.</p><p>If Lu Ming accepted the challenge and ended up losing to the holy river, needless to say, he would be further convicted.</p><p>Was it possible that Lu Ming had defeated shengchuan?</p><p>Lu Ming had just arrived at Tianxuan city and was only a Lv 2 martial King. How could he be a match for the holy river?</p><p>The holy river had already reached the middle stage of the LV 5 martial King realm.</p><p>This move could be said to be vicious.</p><p>Shengchuan also saw the look of admiration in shengyao’s eyes. He was overjoyed. He thought to himself that he was smart enough to think of such an idea. As long as he did this well today, he would definitely be valued by shengyao in the future.</p><p>“You really want to challenge me?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was a little strange. He looked at shengchuan with a faint smile.</p><p>“Nonsense, don’t you have ears? Hurry up, do you dare to accept the challenge or not? if you don’t, hehe, then your strength is worthy of doubt.”</p><p>Shengchuan sneered.</p><p>“Oh? Since that’s the case, I’ll accept your challenge!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a cold glint in his eyes.</p><p>As soon as these words were spoken, a wave of intense discussion broke out in the audience.</p><p>Lu Ming actually agreed. He actually agreed to shengchuan’s challenge. That’s really unwise.</p><p>“What unwise? He’s riding a Tiger and can’t back down now. How do you explain taking out so many soul-sealing crystals at once?”</p><p>that’s right. He can only blame himself for being too high-profile and not knowing how to endure. If he had endured it just now, he would have lost some face at most. Then, he would have sneaked in to hand in the mission and nothing would have happened. If it were me, I would have done the same. Only by enduring humiliation can I achieve great success.</p><p>“That’s right, I was thinking the same.”</p><p>“You agree?”</p><p>Shengchuan’s eyes also lit up with ecstasy.</p><p>Lu Ming actually accepted his challenge. That was great.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>The Holy Light sneered.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you can’t escape this time!”</p><p>Sheng Wushuang’s eyes were filled with viciousness.</p><p>“Let’s go. We’ll fight on the divine guards” battle platform!”</p><p>Shengchuan called out.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
