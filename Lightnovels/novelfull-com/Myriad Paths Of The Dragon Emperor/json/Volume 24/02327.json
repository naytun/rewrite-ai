Cold killing intent emanated from their bodies, and they could not wait to slap Lu Ming to death.</p><p>However, when they saw the eternal universe heavenly Emperor, the body cultivators, and the nine heavenly emperors of the primal Chaos Palace, they held back.</p><p>With so many heavenly Emperor powerhouses, there were even peerless powerhouses. This force was enough to wipe the LAN family off the face of the earth.</p><p>Therefore, they did not dare to kill Lu Ming. In fact, if they wanted to kill Lu Ming in the future, they would not dare to let anyone know. Otherwise, this force would be enough to kill them.</p><p>They were mad with hatred, but now, they could only hold it in.</p><p>“Hand him over!”</p><p>Lu Ming spoke indifferently again.</p><p>Lan Cheng was so angry that he almost vomited blood. The other members of the LAN family were the same.</p><p>The LAN family’s patriarch’s face was extremely gloomy as he squeezed out a word,” “Hand over!”</p><p>“Go and find those people who attacked Lu Ming back then!”</p><p>Lan Cheng ordered.</p><p>Not long after, a few true Emperor realm powerhouses from the LAN family arrived. They were the ones who had killed Bai tai and Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, these people looked at Lu Ming in horror.</p><p>“Yan family, where are your people?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the Yan family’s celestial Thearch and said coldly.</p><p>“The Yan family’s people are not here. It will take time to call them over!”</p><p>The Yan clan’s heavenly Emperor spoke.</p><p>“I’ll be waiting here!”</p><p>Lu Ming spoke calmly and really started to wait there.</p><p>At the scene, everyone was discussing in low voices. No one left and they all waited here.</p><p>Time passed day by day. Finally, a ray of light rushed over from the distance. The Yan clan had arrived.</p><p>Some of them were the ones who had attacked Lu Ming back then.</p><p>When they saw Lu Ming, their expressions changed drastically. They were in disbelief.</p><p>They had thought that Lu Ming was dead. They did not expect that Lu Ming was not dead and was still alive and well.</p><p>Then, an expert from the Yan family explained everything to the Yan family. He didn’t tell them before because he was afraid that they would resist and escape.</p><p>Upon hearing this, the Yan family members were horrified. They could not believe that Lu Ming had actually forced the Yan family’s celestial Thearch to hand them over.</p><p>Back then, it was the Yan family’s celestial Thearch who ordered them to attack Lu Ming. Now, the Yan family’s celestial Thearch was going to hand them over for self-protection.</p><p>However, they didn’t dare to make a sound. This was the heavenly Emperor’s decision, and they couldn’t go against his orders. They still had their family and friends.</p><p>There were dozens of people from the LAN and Yan families.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across these people. He remembered each and every one of them very clearly.</p><p>When Lu Ming’s gaze swept over them, these people revealed looks of fear.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and the void trembled.</p><p>I can give you a chance to fight me. As long as you can kill me, you can live!</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>The eyes of the LAN family and the Yan family lit up.</p><p>Even the eyes of the LAN family’s patriarch, Lan Cheng, and the Yan family’s celestial Thearch lit up.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had defeated Xuanyuan Yi, Xuanyuan Yi’s combat strength was only at the level of a rank 15 true Emperor. These people, on the other hand, had the combat strength of a rank 17 true Emperor. One of them had even made a breakthrough in the past two years and reached the level of a rank 18 true Emperor.</p><p>Among them, there were more than ten with the battle strength of a level 16 and level 15 true Emperor.</p><p>Such power was enough to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>This was a great opportunity. Lu Ming was courting death. If he killed Lu Ming like this, the heavenly Emperor of the primal Chaos Palace, the body cultivator heavenly Emperor, and the others would have nothing to say.</p><p>promise him that you’ll kill him when you have the chance. I’ll reward whoever kills him handsomely. I’ll do my best to help you become a great emperor!</p><p>Lan Cheng transmitted his voice to those people.</p><p>The eyes of those people lit up, especially the eyes of the strongest experts.</p><p>This time, it might be a blessing in disguise. As long as he killed Lu Ming, he would be heavily rewarded.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming stepped in the air as if he was a prehistoric giant beast. With every step he took, the air rumbled and he charged toward the true emperors of the LAN and Yan families.</p><p>“Do it!”</p><p>One of them suddenly roared and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>A single move would affect the whole body. One person took action and led the others to charge toward Lu Ming.</p><p>There were dozens of true emperors, and even the weakest of them had the battle power of a tenth level true Emperor. With so many of them attacking together, the power was astonishing.</p><p>Dozens of attacks were launched at Lu Ming from all directions, trying to drown him.</p><p>“Can Lu Ming be his match?”</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were fixed on the scene.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming made his move. He completely ignored the attacks in front of him and charged forward in an overbearing manner.</p><p>The attacks landed on Lu Ming’s body and were destroyed.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and swung his fists continuously.</p><p>Streams of terrifying fist force blasted forward. In front of him, there were five to six figures whose bodies were as big as watermelons. They were directly blown up in the air by Lu Ming.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>Many people’s hearts trembled. Those five to six people were all at least at the tenth level of the true Emperor realm. There was even one at the fifteenth level of the true Emperor realm. However, they were still blown up by Lu Ming with one punch.</p><p>After killing five to six people, Lu Ming did not stop and continued to kill his way forward.</p><p>Lu Ming exerted the strength of his body to the extreme. At the same time, he also unleashed the power of the world and used a few types of laws.</p><p>Lu Ming had only used four types of laws, but these people were no longer his match.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A fist force as thick as a mountain blasted a big hole in the void and crushed forward. Where the fist force passed, another five or six people were killed.</p><p>One of them was a rank 16 true Emperor.</p><p>This made everyone gasp.</p><p>Everyone finally understood that Lu Ming had not used his full strength in his battle with Xuanyuan Yi. Otherwise, he could have killed Xuanyuan Yi in one move.</p><p>Xuanyuan Yi’s expression was terrible.</p><p>“Those below level 15 of the true Emperor stage, retreat and attack from a distance. Those above level 15 of the true Emperor stage, attack!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>Instantly, they formed a temporary formation. Those below rank fifteen true Emperor would retreat and attack Lu Ming from the back.</p><p>Those with the combat strength of a level 15 true Emperor started to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>In particular, there were two level 17 true emperors and one level 18 true Emperor. Their combat strength was the most shocking and they launched a sure-kill attack.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not Dodge but threw a punch.</p><p>An expert with the combat power of a level seventeen true Emperor was directly defeated by Lu Ming. Lu Ming’s fist force did not stop and crushed his body.</p><p>He let out a cry of despair as his body was torn apart.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body spun and his right leg swept out like a long whip towards another rank-17 true Emperor powerhouse.</p><p>This person could not withstand a single blow. Just like the previous one, he was sent flying tens of thousands of miles away by Lu Ming’s leg and exploded.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>In particular, those who had fought with Lu Ming were shocked. They looked frightened and incredulous.</p><p>The two powerhouses with the combat power of a rank 17 true Emperor could not even withstand a single blow from Lu Ming. They were like babies.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was too terrifying!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
