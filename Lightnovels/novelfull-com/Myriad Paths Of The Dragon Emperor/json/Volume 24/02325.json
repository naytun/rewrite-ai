What a terrifying force this was.</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile. These nine people were earth One, gold one, and the others.</p><p>They had been in the vicinity for a long time. They only appeared when Lu Ming sent them a voice transmission.</p><p>so it’s the Dao brothers of the primal Chaos Palace. The daughter of my LAN family is getting married today. I didn’t expect that all of you would be here. It’s an honor!</p><p>Lan Cheng had a bright smile on his face as he greeted Earth One and the rest.</p><p>However, Earth One and the rest ignored Lan Cheng and flew directly to Lu Ming. They then bowed to Lu Ming.”This subordinate greets the young master!”</p><p>What?</p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p>Most of the people had a dazed look on their faces. Their eyes were wide open, and their mouths were agape. At this moment, they seemed to have become idiots.</p><p>What did the nine heavenly emperors of the chaos hall call Lu Ming? Young master?</p><p>The nine heavenly emperors of the chaos Hall were Lu Ming’s subordinates?</p><p>At this moment, many people felt that their brains had turned into mush, and it was difficult for them to think. They even thought that they were dreaming.</p><p>Lan Cheng’s expression also froze. His eyes were wide open with disbelief, followed by a trace of fear.</p><p>Even the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor and the other elders were a little surprised.</p><p>They did not expect that Lu Ming had so many terrifying powerhouses behind him.</p><p>“Lu Ming is Lu Ming indeed!”</p><p>Long Chen, desolate li, and the others sighed.</p><p>nest, I want to hang out with Lu Ming. I’ll follow him no matter what in the future. I’m not a dog!</p><p>The unscrupulous monk chanted the name of Buddha madly.</p><p>“Is this my father?”</p><p>Lu shenhuang mumbled as he looked at the figure standing among the many heavenly emperors. It was as if the stars were surrounding the moon. At this moment, Lu shenhuang felt a little proud.</p><p>This was because this person was his father.</p><p>Although it was the first time they had met, he still felt proud and excited.</p><p>Primal Chaos Hall, damn it! All of this should have been mine! Mine!</p><p>In the crowd, Yuan Xin was roaring in her heart. Her eyes were red with jealousy.</p><p>Yuan Xin had seen Earth One and the rest back then.</p><p>Back then, Yuan Xin and the others had told him that he had to defeat Lu Ming in order to become the young master of the chaos Hall. However, Lu Ming had defeated him in the end, and he had naturally lost the right to inherit the chaos Hall.</p><p>What he didn’t expect was that Earth One and the rest were actually powerhouses of the heavenly Emperor realm. This made him go crazy with jealousy.</p><p>How great would it be if he inherited all of this?</p><p>But now, he could only roar in his heart and didn’t dare to make a sound. He was extremely sullen.</p><p>“Seniors, there’s no need to be so polite. I’ve troubled all of you today!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Young master’s enemies are our enemies!”</p><p>Tu Yi said. He then turned around and looked at Lan Cheng and the others.</p><p>The nine heavenly emperors ‘auras were so terrifying that Lan Cheng and the others’ expressions changed drastically as they retreated.</p><p>The difference was too great. There were more than a dozen heavenly emperors on Lu Ming’s side. They completely crushed Lan Cheng and the others. Their expressions were extremely ugly.</p><p>“Hand over those people from back then, not a single one less!”</p><p>Lu Ming stared at Lan Cheng and said coldly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re the one who killed them and stole their treasures. The people of the LAN family are only following the rules of the heaven realm. That’s why we’re hunting you down. Yet, you Harbor a grudge and want to kill them. This is outrageous. How can there be such a reason in the world?”</p><p>Lan Cheng bellowed angrily and continued to quibble. He used the heaven realm’s rules to pressure Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered!</p><p>He had already lost his patience and was too lazy to argue with the other party.</p><p>“Lan Cheng, you don’t have to quibble here. You’re using the heaven realm’s laws to pressure me. I’m not here to reason with you today. I’m here to take someone back. You have to hand him over even if you don’t want to. Do you understand?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>These words made many people’s hearts tremble, and they were shocked beyond words.</p><p>Lu Ming’s words were very obvious. They were not here to reason but to demand for the person. The LAN family had to hand the person over regardless of whether they wanted to or not.</p><p>This was to force the LAN family to hand over their people. A junior was actually forcing a heavenly Emperor … No, not just a heavenly Emperor, but several powerful forces.</p><p>This was extremely domineering. Many young people’s blood boiled as they watched.</p><p>In the city of LAN, the Yan family’s celestial Thearch and the others looked terrible. If not for the fact that there were too many experts standing beside Lu Ming, they would have slapped him to death long ago.</p><p>But now, they could only endure it.</p><p>hurry up and call for reinforcements. If the LAN family doesn’t hand over their people today, I will slaughter 10000 people from the LAN family and 10000 people from the Yan family to be buried with senior Bai tai!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He had already lost his patience.</p><p>“You dare?”</p><p>In LAN city, the Yan clan’s celestial Thearch bellowed.</p><p>“Why not? Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and rushed to the LAN family’s area where countless LAN family disciples were gathered.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Lan Cheng bellowed in anger and wanted to deal with Lu Ming. However, Earth One threw a punch and mountains appeared, forcing Lan Cheng to retreat.</p><p>A great emperor from the LAN family was about to make a move. Gold one appeared, and a terrifying aura burst out. All the great emperors from the LAN family vomited blood and retreated.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and threw a punch.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>There were seven to eight true Emperor realm powerhouses from the LAN family who were blown up by Lu Ming, their flesh and blood flying everywhere.</p><p>Lu Ming showed no mercy to the LAN family.</p><p>Bai tai was killed by the LAN and Yan families. He must take revenge.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re crazy. You killed the heaven realm’s experts. These people are the forces against the alien race, but you killed your own people. Are you a spy for the alien race?”</p><p>Lan Cheng roared. He was about to go crazy. Lu Ming was too decisive. He attacked immediately and killed the LAN family’s experts.</p><p>At this moment, the people of the LAN family scattered in fear.</p><p>“Hahaha, these pieces of trash can’t even kill a few outsiders. I alone can kill a thousand times, ten thousand times the number of non-humankind beings. I alone can fight against an Army of ten thousand men and horses. Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and threw another punch. A few LAN family experts were blown up.</p><p>“Run, run!”</p><p>LAN Yun was also mixed in with the crowd. He was running away in fear. To him, Lu Ming was simply a lunatic.</p><p>However, at the next moment, he shouted in horror because Lu Ming had his eyes on him. Lu Ming appeared above his head in a flash and stomped on LAN Yun’s face. LAN Yun screamed in pain and his body fell heavily to the ground. He kept screaming in pain.</p><p>“Let go of LAN Yun!”</p><p>Lan Cheng bellowed, his eyes red. LAN Yun wasn’t an ordinary person, he was a peak grade heaven’s pride expert and had the potential to become a heaven sovereign in the future. He couldn’t die!</p><p>He charged at Lu Ming with all his might but he was blocked by tu Yi.</p><p>“Hand him over!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s reply was a simple word, his voice resounding and powerful.</p><p>At this moment, the scene was silent, and time and space seemed to have frozen.</p><p>There was only one person in everyone’s eyes, and that was Lu Ming.</p><p>Who would have thought that such a scene would happen today? Lu Ming killed the LAN family’s experts in front of LAN city and the heavenly Emperor, while LAN city was helpless..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
