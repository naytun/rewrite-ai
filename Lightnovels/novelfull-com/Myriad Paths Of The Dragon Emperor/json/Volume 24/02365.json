The alien was like a baby, struggling madly. His legs, limbs, and arms were constantly waving. His face was flushed and his eyes were bulging.</p><p>“A two star great emperor can’t even withstand a single blow!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss…</p><p>The heavenly realm was still fine, but the non-humans gasped.</p><p>A two star great emperor with astonishing speed was as vulnerable as a baby in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>How was that possible?</p><p>Everyone’s pupils contracted, including the four star great emperor.</p><p>“It seems like you’re the one who broke through to four star great emperor?”</p><p>The four star great emperor said.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and did not comment.</p><p>It was normal for the other party to think that he was that four star great emperor.</p><p>Other than a four star great emperor, who else had the strength to easily take down a two star great emperor? Not even three star great emperors.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm burst with force and killed the skinny alien.</p><p>On the side, Emperor formless, huntian, and Sky Fire Emperor sighed.</p><p>Unknowingly, Lu Ming had already grown to such a level. Killing a two star great emperor was as easy as crushing an ant.</p><p>This was a two star great emperor! In the yuan mountain, he would be the Overlord of a region, a figure who was high and mighty and could suppress all directions.</p><p>“Then let’s fight to the death!”</p><p>The four-star great emperor non-human stepped forward. A battle-axe appeared in his hand, and a powerful aura burst out.</p><p>“I don’t want to play with you guys anymore. Let’s end this!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. The muscles on his body suddenly trembled.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure burst out at a speed so fast that no one could react in time. In an instant, he was in front of the four star great emperor.</p><p>“Why would 1?”</p><p>The non-human four star great Emperor’s pupils suddenly contracted, and he was almost scared to death. Then, he used all of his power to defend.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and the overwhelming force of his fist blasted toward the alien in front of him.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The foreign being’s body was sent flying, and a large hole appeared on his body. He spat out a large mouthful of blood and his aura was weak. He had been severely injured by Lu Ming in one move.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>The other alien races reacted and were almost scared to death. Then, they turned around and ran.</p><p>They understood that they had met an opponent that they couldn’t defeat. Even a four star great emperor had been injured by a single move. If they were to face him, they would only die.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long hiss and charged forward, his fists constantly blasting out.</p><p>A series of fist forces streaked through the air and headed toward the demonic humans.</p><p>A few three star great emperors among the alien races were hit by Lu Ming’s fist force. They were killed immediately and exploded in the air.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Emperor formless roared as he charged toward the alien race with huntian Emperor and Sky Fire Emperor.</p><p>“Let’s attack together!”</p><p>The other beings in the heaven realm also roared and charged toward the outsiders.</p><p>They could only leave after killing all the alien races. This was a matter of life and death, so they had to use all their strength.</p><p>This was a massacre, without a doubt.</p><p>Lu Ming seemed to have entered a no man’s land. His figure flashed continuously. Every time he flashed, a few alien races were killed by him. He then put away the alien races ‘storage rings.</p><p>“You can’t escape!”</p><p>Lu Ming fixed his eyes on the four stars great emperor. This alien wanted to escape, but he was severely injured by Lu Ming and could not escape at all.</p><p>Lu Ming rushed forward and killed the alien in two moves. After putting away the alien’s storage bracelet, he turned around and attacked the other alien races.</p><p>The alien races ran for their lives but they could not escape. Lu Ming and the rest caught up and killed them one by one.</p><p>A moment later, all the alien races at the scene were killed by Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>take a look and see if there are any formation disks in their storage bracelets!</p><p>Lu Ming instructed. He took out the storage ring that he had obtained from the alien race and checked it.</p><p>Without a doubt, Lu Ming had the most storage bracelets. He had a total of fifty to sixty of them. In the end, he found three array discs.</p><p>As for the others, they had found a piece.</p><p>The eight array disks were complete!</p><p>that formation spirit said that we have to kill the other side before we can leave. There might be some alien races that have escaped and are hiding somewhere. During this time, you should search everywhere and find them!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The others nodded.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming was undoubtedly the most powerful person. The others naturally obeyed his words.</p><p>The heaven realm beings split up into groups of a few and spread out to search for the alien races that had escaped.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming could not be bothered with such matters. He found a place to cultivate and comprehend the laws in peace.</p><p>Now that the Samsara law and primordial chaos law had both reached the third realm, Lu Ming began to plan on comprehending other ultimate laws.</p><p>Next, Lu Ming chose the eternal law and began to comprehend it.</p><p>The more laws he comprehended, the more successful Lu Ming’s comprehension of the laws became. It was very smooth. A few days later, he had reached the beginner level of the eternal laws.</p><p>Time passed day by day, and in the blink of an eye, three months had passed.</p><p>In the past three months, the people of the heaven realm had searched the entire area. As expected, there were some alien races that had escaped the net, and they had found and killed them one by one.</p><p>Now, they were certain that no one from the foreign tribes had escaped.</p><p>At this time, everyone gathered and flew towards the door that they had entered from.</p><p>They had just arrived when that young formation Spirit’s figure appeared.</p><p>“I didn’t expect you to complete my request so quickly. How boring!”</p><p>That formation spirit sighed.</p><p>Everyone’s hearts jolted. This formation spirit wouldn’t go back on its word and make some strange requests, right?</p><p>“You won’t go back on your word, will you?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>of course 1 won’t. Although I’m bored, I’m a man of my word. Take out your array discs!</p><p>The formation spirit said, curling its lips.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and eight array discs appeared.</p><p>The formation spirit extended a hand and pointed. A ray of light flashed, and the eight formation disks started to shake. They emitted a brilliant light and flew towards that door. Then, they flew into the door and actually fused together with it.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The door opened.</p><p>Everyone was ecstatic!</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Someone was overjoyed and rushed out first. This time, there was no resistance. That person rushed out of the door and disappeared.</p><p>“Go, go!”</p><p>The rest of the people, including Lu Ming, Emperor formless, and the others, also rushed toward the gate.</p><p>When they rushed out of the door, they found that they had already left the giant tower and were outside.</p><p>“It’s so boring!”</p><p>The formation Spirit’s voice came from the giant tower. Then, the door of the giant tower closed.</p><p>Deans, let’s go!</p><p>Lu Ming said and left the place with the three Deans.</p><p>The others also left the place.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming, formless Emperor, huntian Emperor, and Sky Fire Emperor headed towards the depths of the island.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>However, they didn’t fly very far before an earth-shaking roar came from the front. The entire world shook as a terrifying aura spread out..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
