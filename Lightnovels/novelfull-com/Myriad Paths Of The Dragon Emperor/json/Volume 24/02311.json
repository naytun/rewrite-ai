It was the figure of the chaos Thearch.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming entered, the figure turned into a ray of light and rushed into the space between Lu Ming’s eyebrows. Instantly, a message appeared in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>“The chaos Scripture!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. This piece of information was the latter part of the chaos Scripture. It recorded the derivations of the chaos Scripture, a series of superpowers, and the combination of various laws.</p><p>Among them, the Laws of Chaos were the main.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged and comprehended it in detail.</p><p>the chaos Scripture contains 18 types of laws, which is similar to the indestructible ancient scroll. Unfortunately, it only focuses on one type of chaos law, which is not suitable for me. However, there are many things in it that 1 can learn from!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered!</p><p>The chaos Scripture contained 18 laws.</p><p>Among the 18 types of laws, Lu Ming only had four of them.</p><p>In the future, if Lu Ming wanted to master more laws, he could deduce other laws based on the chaos Scripture. It would be faster than comprehending them alone.</p><p>Also, Lu Ming could try to cultivate some of the divine abilities in order to increase his means of fighting his enemies.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming’s main cultivation direction still had to rely on himself to comprehend and explore.</p><p>After all, he controlled many ultimate maxims. If he wanted to exert the strongest power of these maxims, he had to explore on his own.</p><p>After all, since ancient times, no one had mastered multiple ultimate maxims at the same time.</p><p>A day later, Lu Ming stopped his comprehension.</p><p>He was not in a hurry now. When he had time in the future, he would choose a few magical power techniques to cultivate!</p><p>Lu Ming returned to the main hall where Earth One and the other nine were waiting.</p><p>“Tu Yi, what’s your cultivation level?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>the nine of us belong to nine different elements, and we are all in the heavenly Emperor realm!</p><p>Tu Yi replied.</p><p>“Eh? Ah? Heavens … The celestial Emperor?”</p><p>Lu Ming started to nod subconsciously. However, he immediately came to his senses and his mouth was wide open.</p><p>He was dumbfounded!</p><p>Earth One, gold one, wood one …</p><p>There were a total of nine people, and they were all in the form of puppets. Lu Ming had previously thought that Earth One and the rest might be at the great emperor realm. He had even thought that they might be peak great emperors. However, he had never expected that they were all at the heavenly Emperor realm!</p><p>Nine heavenly emperors, what kind of terrifying power was this?</p><p>The primal Chaos Hall was only one of the nine great halls of the Hunyuan sect. Even if the primal Chaos Emperor was extremely powerful, it was still shocking to see nine heavenly Emperor realm puppets.</p><p>From this, it could be seen how shocking the Hunyuan sect’s strength was at its peak.</p><p>“Hahaha, good, that’s great!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>With the help of Earth One and the rest, he was like a tiger that had grown wings.</p><p>“Primal Chaos Hall, is there anyone else other than you?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>yes, but they’re all puppets. There are 1000 of us in each of the nine elements. Our names are from one to 1000, from the martial Royal realm to the heavenly Emperor realm!</p><p>Earth One said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Back then, tu Yi had sent tu Qian to follow him to the divine wilderness continent. Even now, tu Qian was still guarding the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>seniors, I’ll go back first. 1 have something that 1 need your help with. In. few days,, ‘ll go to the LAN family in the central region of the Tai Qing heavenly region…</p><p>Lu Ming told them about the LAN family and invited Earth One and the rest to help.</p><p>Earth One and the rest naturally agreed.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. With Earth One and the rest helping him, he would definitely make the LAN family pay the price this time.</p><p>After that, a wave of energy enveloped his body. Not long after, Lu Ming returned to his original place.</p><p>it seems like there’s something similar to a teleportation array on the mixed energy token. As long as it’s activated, it’ll activate the teleportation array on it!</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>In the next few days, Lu Ming did not cultivate. He had a good rest.</p><p>A few days later, Lu Ming, the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor, and the four Grand Supreme elders of the Archean body cultivators headed for the central part of the Tai Qing heavenly region with Lu Ming.</p><p>The Tai Qing heavenly region was vast and boundless, not smaller than the entire Yuan continent. It was roughly divided into five regions.</p><p>North, South, East, West, and central!</p><p>The LAN family was in the central region!</p><p>The Heng Yu heavenly Emperor brought Lu Ming along. With the speed of the heavenly emperors, they arrived at the Blue Moon City where the LAN family was located in a few hours.</p><p>Blue Moon City was an ancient city that completely belonged to the LAN family!</p><p>This was the LAN family’s headquarters. The LAN family had been rooted here for countless years.</p><p>During this period of time, Blue Moon City was unusually lively and packed with people.</p><p>The marriage of the LAN family’s proud daughter of heaven and the second-ranked genius of the nine uniques was a big event. Moreover, they heard that the LAN family had invited a large number of geniuses. Many people guessed that there would be a grand event, so they naturally came to watch the fun.</p><p>The eternal universe heavenly Emperor and the others concealed their auras and walked into the blue Moon City like ordinary people. They found an Inn and asked for information.</p><p>there are so many heaven’s favorites this time. Most of the famous heaven’s favorites from the primordial realm are here!</p><p>the LAN family actually has such a big face to be able to invite so many heaven’s favorites?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>“What do you know? It’s been a long time since the heaven realm has had such a grand event. Since the selection of the nine uniques more than a decade ago, some of the top heaven’s favorites haven’t fought with each other. This time, 1 can take advantage of this opportunity to fight with each other!”</p><p>also, I heard that the LAN family has paid a huge price this time. Whoever can get first place this time will be rewarded with loo chaos gems!</p><p>“What? loo chaos gems, what a great deal!”</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>The LAN family actually wanted to take out loo chaos gems as a reward for the first place. This was definitely a big deal.</p><p>Back then, outside two world city, Lu Ming had captured the Prince of the other party in exchange for a hundred chaos gems.</p><p>the LAN family has really put in a lot of effort. Does the LAN family want to push Xuanyuan Yi to the throne of number one?”</p><p>that’s right. Xuanyuan Yi is ambitious and has long wanted to challenge Lin Xiaofeng and take the first place. This time, he most likely wants to take this opportunity to defeat Lin Xiaofeng. This way, the loo stones of chaos will not be wasted, and his reputation will be pushed to the peak!</p><p>“The LAN family has a good plan, but aren’t they afraid that Xuanyuan Yi will lose to Lin Xiaofeng? If that’s the case, we’ll suffer a double loss!”</p><p>that’s why this time, there will most likely be a peak confrontation. That’s why so many people have come, and also why so many heaven’s favorites have come!</p><p>In the restaurant, many people were drinking and talking loudly. Lu Ming and the rest had obtained a lot of information.</p><p>loo chaos gems! 1 can’t miss this!</p><p>A glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes and he smiled.</p><p>It seemed that there would be extra gains this time.</p><p>seniors, it seems like we don’t have to rush to visit. Let’s get the loo chaos gems first.</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>After drinking for a while, they left the place and found a restaurant to stay in.</p><p>Days passed, and soon, it was the day of LAN Xia and Xuanyuan Yi’s wedding.</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming used the divine breath technique to change his appearance and aura..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
