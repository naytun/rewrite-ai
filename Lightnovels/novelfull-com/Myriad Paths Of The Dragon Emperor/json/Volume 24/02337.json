The closer they got to the island, the more they felt how vast it was.</p><p>It was one-tenth the size of the Tai Qing heavenly region. It was too vast. There were Endless Mountains, endless plains, rivers, and lakes.</p><p>As they neared the edge of the island, they could feel a terrifying pressure pressing down on them.</p><p>It was as if they were carrying an endless weight on their bodies. They couldn’t help but fall down at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>The six people’s expressions changed. They circulated their world force with all their might and slowly stabilized themselves.</p><p>Lu Ming used the world force. At the same time, his muscles were constantly vibrating, vibrating the air to stabilize himself. Otherwise, he would have fallen directly.</p><p>“What a terrifying pressure!”</p><p>The six people’s faces were all very ugly.</p><p>Although the eternal universe heavenly Emperor and the others had warned them that the pressure here was astonishing, they were still shocked when they actually felt it.</p><p>Among the six of them, five of them were great sovereigns. Lu Ming also had the combat strength of a great sovereign. With their cultivation base, they were almost unable to fly due to the pressure. One could only imagine how terrifying the pressure was.</p><p>If a true Emperor were here, they wouldn’t even be able to fly. They would be crushed by this pressure and fall to their deaths.</p><p>“This pressure, this aura …”</p><p>The more the six sensed, the more shocked they were.</p><p>This pressure and aura seemed to be even higher than the heavenly Dao. It seemed to transcend everything and dominate everything.</p><p>Even the heavenly Dao would be suppressed by this aura!</p><p>It was as if there was a Supreme Being in the center of the island that was emitting an aura that suppressed the universe.</p><p>However, a few years ago, someone had already set foot on this Island. In these few years, everyone speculated that this Island had been left behind for who knew how many years. The owner of the island had left long ago.</p><p>The aura on the island should be the aura left behind by the island’s owner when he preached here and went into seclusion.</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming and the rest were even more shocked.</p><p>However, the aura that was left behind was still so terrifying even after so many years. Even the heavenly Emperor couldn’t enter.</p><p>After stabilizing their bodies, they slowly descended to the ground.</p><p>Soon, they were only tens of thousands of meters above the ground.</p><p>“What’s that?”</p><p>Suddenly, someone looked forward.</p><p>There, a dark cloud was flying towards them at an astonishing speed.</p><p>Swoosh Swoosh Swoosh…</p><p>Following that, ear-piercing screeches could be heard.</p><p>not good, it’s crows, all crows …</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Their expressions changed. They turned around and quickly rushed down.</p><p>Swoosh Swoosh Swoosh…</p><p>The flock of crows covered the sky and the sun. It was unknown how many of them there were.</p><p>Each one of them gave off a terrifying aura.</p><p>Among them, there were true Emperor realm and empty Emperor realm. The key was that there were too many of them, so they could only retreat.</p><p>However, the crows were also very fast, and they were quickly closing in.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, a black stream of light shot toward Lu Ming and the others from below.</p><p>These black streams of light were all crows. They were black all over and were the size of a head. They looked as if they were cast from black iron.</p><p>why are we so unlucky? we’ve just entered and we’ve already encountered such a Crow…</p><p>One of them roared.</p><p>According to what they knew, there were some terrifying strange beasts living on the island, and these crows were one of them. They were extremely terrifying and formed groups. Some people were unlucky and encountered these crows the moment they landed. It was extremely dangerous, and many people died in their mouths.</p><p>However, the void God Island was so vast, and the chances of encountering one were not very high. One could only say that their luck was too bad.</p><p>“Kill our way out!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and a long spear condensed in his hand, shining with nine colors of radiance.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The long spear burst out and turned into a spear light, clashing with the crows.</p><p>The spear radiance was extremely sharp. Each of the spear radiance could penetrate a Crow.</p><p>The others also made their moves.</p><p>Of the other six, only one was a one star great emperor. Of the other four, three were two star great emperors, and one was a three star great emperor. Their attack power was much stronger than Lu Ming’s.</p><p>As soon as the six of them attacked, a large number of crows were killed, and their corpses fell to the ground.</p><p>However, there were too many crows, and they kept charging from below.</p><p>The flock of crows in the distance had also rushed over. There were too many of them.</p><p>Lu Ming and the group were suddenly surrounded by the crows.</p><p>“Let’s join forces and kill our way out!”</p><p>The three star great emperor was a middle-aged man with amazing combat strength. He held a battle-axe in his hand, and each time he swung it, a tens of thousands of meters long axe light would be sent out, killing a large number of crows.</p><p>The void Emperor, the crow of the true Emperor realm, could not stop him at all.</p><p>With him as the leader and the others as support, they worked together and instantly tore a path out of the crows, continuously charging out.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this time, an ear-piercing sound was heard, and a fiery red light pounced toward the middle-aged man.</p><p>The middle-aged man struck out with his axe and collided with the fiery red light. A violent explosion was heard and the fiery red light was sent flying.</p><p>It was a fiery-red Crow. Its feathers were bright red, like burning flames.</p><p>The crow was shockingly strong. It was struck by the middle-aged man’s axe, but it didn’t die.</p><p>This was a great emperor level Crow.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Ear-piercing sounds rang out continuously. Everyone saw fiery red light flash continuously among the crows. They were all fiery red crows, and there were more than a dozen of them. They were all great emperor realm crows.</p><p>The six people’s faces changed!</p><p>There were more than a dozen great emperor crows. This kind of strength was too shocking.</p><p>“Charge, quickly charge!”</p><p>Someone roared. They erupted with all their strength. At this moment, no one was hiding anything. They used all their strength and continuously attacked, wanting to rush out.</p><p>However, the dozen or so fire-red crows were already approaching at an astonishing speed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>An ear-piercing sound resounded through the firmament. They flapped their wings as fast as lightning, and their claws were indestructible as they pounced toward Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his long spear and swept it out, colliding with a fiery red Crow.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The long spear trembled continuously and a terrifying force surged along the long spear. Lu Ming’s body trembled and he took a few steps back. The long spear that was condensed from the world’s energy and the laws was almost scattered.</p><p>“What powerful strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>The crow was only sent flying by Lu Ming’s attack but it was not injured. Its eyes glowed coldly as it flapped its wings and pounced at Lu Ming again.</p><p>The other five were also in a tough battle.</p><p>Even the weakest of these crows had the battle prowess of a one star great emperor, and the strongest was no weaker than the middle-aged man.</p><p>The six of them were caught in a bitter battle..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
