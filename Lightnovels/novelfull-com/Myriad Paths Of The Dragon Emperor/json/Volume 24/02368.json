They had to increase their strength. Otherwise, they would probably be exterminated by the evil god tribe after they killed the Four Divine Beasts.</p><p>Lu Ming bade farewell to Emperor notionless and the others and headed in one direction. After flying a long distance, they arrived at a Mountain Valley.</p><p>This place was relatively hidden.</p><p>When Lu Ming arrived, he realized that there were already many people gathered here.</p><p>“Over 300!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He was somewhat shocked.</p><p>There were already more than 300 heaven realm beings gathered here. This number could be said to be very shocking.</p><p>One had to know that almost all the people here were advanced great emperors.</p><p>These people were from all races.</p><p>There were many humans and all sorts of divine beasts. Although most of them were in human form, Lu Ming could still sense them based on their aura.</p><p>“He is … Lu Ming!”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming arrived, someone recognized him and was shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming actually dared to come here. One should know that those who could come here were almost all advanced great emperors. Could it be that Lu Ming already had the strength of an advanced great emperor?</p><p>That was impossible!</p><p>Most of the people shook their heads, thinking that Lu Ming was only here to try his luck.</p><p>However, there were a few people who had serious expressions.</p><p>This was because the news of Lu Ming easily killing a four star great emperor in the huge tower had spread. Some people had heard of this.</p><p>Lu Ming arrived and walked to the side, waiting with peace of mind.</p><p>As time passed, more and more people came.</p><p>Gradually, the number exceeded five hundred.</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>He saw a little Daoist looking around sneakily. If it wasn’t dandan, who could it be?</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile. Dandan had indeed come to the void God Island. If there were any treasures, this fellow would definitely be there.</p><p>“Dandan!”</p><p>Lu Ming called out.</p><p>“Who is it?” Dandan was shocked. She jumped up and scanned her surroundings. When she saw Lu Ming, she smiled and flew over.</p><p>“So it’s you. What, you’ve broken through to the heavenly Emperor realm? You dare to come here?”</p><p>Dandan smiled and her pair of sneaky eyes darted randomly at Lu Ming. Then, her eyes widened and she said in surprise,” kid, what a strong qi and blood. You’ve cultivated an ancient body cultivator, so your physical body is shockingly strong…</p><p>This fellow was indeed one of the top ten war beasts. It was very knowledgeable and could tell some of Lu Ming’s secrets at a glance.</p><p>“You’ve also improved a lot!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed, a hint of surprise flashed in the depths of his eyes.</p><p>Because in his eyes, dandan’s cultivation was unfathomable.</p><p>Needless to say, this guy had probably reached the great emperor realm a long time ago, and he had even reached an extremely deep realm.</p><p>“Hahaha, then why don’t you take a look at who I am!”</p><p>Dandan grinned.</p><p>Of course, the two of them talked through telepathy to prevent their secrets from being overheard by others.</p><p>The two of them hadn’t seen each other for a long time and were chatting.</p><p>In the end, the number of people who came here gradually decreased.</p><p>Three days later, more than six hundred people had gathered here. They were all experts above advanced great emperor. Any one of them was an expert in a region.</p><p>“Everyone!”</p><p>At this moment, a group of people stepped out.</p><p>There were about a dozen of them, and each of them had a deep and unfathomable aura.</p><p>“They are all peak great emperors!”</p><p>Dandan sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming, who nodded secretly. These people were probably the strongest group of people in the heaven realm.</p><p>A burly man with a long beard, who looked like a lion, looked around and said,”Let me introduce myself, 1 am Hong Shi!”</p><p>After saying this, he paused for a moment before continuing, I’ll talk about what we need to do now. In the depths of void God Island, there’s a place that’s very likely to be the true Dao ground left behind by the island’s owner. However, it’s guarded by Four Divine Beasts. The Four Divine Beasts have the bloodline of the legendary divine beasts of the four directions, and their combat strength has barely reached the heavenly Emperor realm!</p><p>first of all, our goal is to get rid of the four godly beasts. Two of them are guarding the core area, and the other two are patrolling outside!</p><p>“So, we only need to take care of two of them. They’ve been wandering around, so we just need to send someone to attract them!”</p><p>“Send people to attract them?”</p><p>Many people’s faces sank. It was definitely very dangerous to send people to attract the two wandering divine beasts. Who would be willing to go?</p><p>Hong Shi saw through everyone’s thoughts and smiled: you don’t have to worry about this. We’ve already sent people out, and they’re all experts in speed and life-saving abilities. They’ll be enough to attract that divine beast for a while! as for the other one, I’ll leave it to the evil god tribe!</p><p>this time, we’ve discussed with the evil god tribe. We’ll deal with two of the four godly beasts on each side. Now that we’ve taken care of the one outside, we’ll deal with the two godly beasts that are guarding the core area!</p><p>similarly, the evil god tribe and we will each face one of them. In the end, we will enter the core area and fight for the treasures with our own abilities!</p><p>Hong Shi said a long string of words, and everyone nodded, basically understanding.</p><p>it’s almost time. Let’s go now!</p><p>After Hong Shi finished speaking, he took the lead and flew towards the island.</p><p>More than 600 powerhouses followed him.</p><p>They had already sent people to attract the attention of a godly beast, so they naturally knew the safe route. Thus, they were extremely fast as they flew towards the void God Island. They did not need to be afraid of encountering that godly beast.</p><p>A day later, they had already arrived at the central region of the void God Island.</p><p>At this point, they slowed down. Not long after, they arrived at a mountain peak and looked into the distance.</p><p>In front of them, there was an area that was misty as if it was covered by a thick fog. Even with their eyesight, they could not see through the fog.</p><p>In the South, there was a huge arched door. This arched door was open, and from a distance, one could see a stone staircase behind the arched door.</p><p>this is the core area. However, the fog is formed by a large array. We can’t enter it at all. The only way in is through that arched door!</p><p>however, as soon as we appear, the two godly beasts will also appear. Therefore, we have to deal with them first!</p><p>Hong Shi explained.</p><p>the people from the evil god race should have arrived by now. I’ll contact them now. We’ll act together later and take care of one divine beast each!</p><p>A white-haired old man said. Then, his figure flashed and he left the place.</p><p>Not long after, the white-haired old man returned.</p><p>the evil god tribe has arrived. We’ll attack together in ten minutes!</p><p>The white-haired old man said.</p><p>Everyone nodded and waited patiently.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, ten minutes had passed.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Hong Shi said.</p><p>Everyone concealed their auras and flew toward the core area.</p><p>In another direction, they saw a large group of evil god tribe members flying toward the land of fog..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
