I don’t want to be a bully!1‘</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head slightly. Xuan Lin’s cultivation base was not worth mentioning in his eyes.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you don’t dare to fight, do you?1‘</p><p>Xuan Lin stepped out in an overbearing manner.</p><p>Back in the battle of the ten lands, he was still young and his cultivation was not high enough. He could not compete with Lu Ming and the others, which was a regret.</p><p>He was very ambitious. He wanted to defeat Lu Ming to prove that he could also become the number one prodigy in the world if he were in that era.</p><p>“If you want to fight, then I’ll fight with you!”</p><p>Qiu Yue said.</p><p>Hmph, Lu Ming, are you going to hide behind a woman? you’re indeed a cripple, a piece of trash. You actually won rhe title of world champion in the first battle of the ten lands. What a joke. Attack, I’ll defeat you in ten moves!</p><p>Xuan Lin shouted coldly and continued to step forward. His powerful aura pressed down on Lu Ming. Finally, he punched out and a giant turtle as large as a mountain was formed. It pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>“If you want to fight, then I’ll play with you!1‘</p><p>let’s go, ” Lu Ming said indifferently. He took a step forward and rushed toward the Xuan forest.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming didn’t make a move. His figure rushed past and the giant tortoise that Xuan Lin attacked exploded. Lu Ming’s figure didn’t stop and appeared in front of Xuan Lin in an instant. The two of them were less than a meter apart.</p><p>Xuan Lin’s pupils contracted rapidly as he roared in fear and retreated frantically.</p><p>However, he suddenly realized that he couldn’t move his body. He couldn’t move at all. The space around him seemed to have been frozen.</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out a hand and clasped Xuan Lin’s throat.</p><p>Everyone at the scene couldn’t help but widen their eyes.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>He did not see Lu Ming make a move and there was no powerful aura permeating the air. How did Lu Ming grab Xuan Lin’s throat?</p><p>It was as if Xuan Lin had been waiting there motionlessly for Lu Ming to do it.</p><p>No one could figure it out!</p><p>“You want to challenge me with your strength?1‘</p><p>Lu Ming spoke indifferently, his voice full of disdain.</p><p>Xuan Lin struggled madly, and his eyes were filled with fear.</p><p>“Get lost!1‘</p><p>Lu Ming swung his arm and Xuan Lin’s body directly smashed into the ground. With a loud bang, a huge pit appeared on the ground. Xuan Lin lay in the pit and spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>The others were dumbfounded!</p><p>One move, no, Lu Ming did not even make an official move, and Xuan Lin was defeated. He could not even withstand one blow.</p><p>Wasn’t lu Ming unable to become a Martial Emperor? why did he have such strong combat abilities?</p><p>Could it be that Lu Ming had already become a Martial Emperor?</p><p>Thinking of this, many people’s hearts beat wildly.</p><p>Lu Ming, who was below the rank of a martial Supreme, had mastered many types of laws and even different ultimate laws. He was really going against the heavens.</p><p>The celestial Thearch had asserted that Lu Ming would not be able to break through and become a Martial Emperor for his entire life.</p><p>However, if Lu Ming could create a miracle and defy the heavens to become a divine Emperor, how powerful would his combat strength be?</p><p>“Lu Ming, I want you dead! Kill him! Kill him!”</p><p>Below, Xuan Lin shouted hysterically.</p><p>As the number one genius of the divine land, he had never lost a battle against his peers. He had never known what defeat felt like.</p><p>Earlier, he had come in a domineering manner and said that he would defeat Lu Ming in ten moves. However, he was easily defeated by Lu Ming now and could not even withstand a single blow.</p><p>He could not accept such an outcome at ail. He was so mad with hatred that he could not wait to cut Lu Ming into eight pieces.</p><p>“The flowers in rhe greenhouse can’t stand the wind and waves!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head, showing a strong sense of disdain.</p><p>It seemed that Lu Ming’s generation was the true golden generation. There were many geniuses and they competed with each other. Many of them were very intelligent and had experienced many storms.</p><p>As for this generation, it seemed like there were a lot fewer geniuses. This Xuan Lin’s path had been too smooth. Although his talent was not bad, his mind was not good. He was far inferior to Tianming and the others.</p><p>The moment he met with failure, the moment he met with a setback, he immediately couldn’t take it. He couldn’t bear it.</p><p>“Kill, kill him!”</p><p>Xuan Lin roared. Lu Ming’s words pierced his heart.</p><p>“Lu Ming, kneel down and accept your death!”</p><p>The few people who had followed Xuan Lin here charged at Lu Ming, exuding a terrifying aura.</p><p>True Emperor!</p><p>Three of them were true Emperor realm experts. They were surrounded by world divine light and looked like gods.</p><p>“Kneel down!1‘</p><p>The terrifying pressure of the true Emperor realm pressed down on Lu Ming, trying to force him to his knees.</p><p>bet your sister! All of you, get lost!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and threw a punch.</p><p>The air exploded and the terrifying fist force rushed toward the three true emperors.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>The three true emperors were almost scared to death when they felt Lu Ming’s terrifying fist force.</p><p>That level of power was not what they could contend with at all.</p><p>It was too late for them to retreat.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>As the fist force crushed over, the three people’s bodies exploded and turned into flying flames.</p><p>The scene suddenly quieted down. There was no sound at all.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were wide open in disbelief.</p><p>Three true emperors. That was three true emperors. They were actually turned into ashes by Lu Ming with one punch. How was this possible?</p><p>How could Lu Ming’s combat strength be so powerful?</p><p>Dongfang Xue Yu stood there in a daze, her little mouth slightly open, as if she was in a dream.</p><p>Xuan Lin was also stunned. His eyes were filled with fear and disbelief.</p><p>“I’ll send you on your way!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Xuan Lin and stomped his foot. A huge foot condensed by the power of the world stomped down on Xuan Lin.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Xuan Lin was so frightened that he kept screaming.</p><p>At this moment, a figure flashed as fast as lightning and swept Xuan Lin away before Lu Ming’s huge foot could land.</p><p>There was a flash in rhe sky in the distance, and an old man with white hair and a white robe appeared. He was holding on to Xuan Lin, who was still in shock.</p><p>“Great emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>it’s one of the elders of the Xuan family, a great emperor!</p><p>the great emperor of the Xuan family has appeared. I guess he’s going to deal with Lu .Ming!</p><p>Lu Ming is still too impulsive. The Xuan family is one of the strongest forces in Aeon city. They are unfathomable. Let’s see how Lu Ming will deal with the great emperor!</p><p>Some people recognized the old man.</p><p>After Xuan Lin reacted, he was overjoyed.</p><p>“Founding elder, hahaha, you’re here just in time. Kill Lu Ming for me. Kill that b * stard!”</p><p>Xuan Lin shouted.</p><p>Today, Lu Ming had embarrassed him. He must kill Lu Ming to vent the hatred in his heart.</p><p>The elder of the Xuan family exuded a powerful aura.</p><p>It was the pressure of a great emperor. Within a radius of ten thousand miles, it was filled with a terrifying pressure. Some of the weaker cultivators had to kneel down.</p><p>Ordinary people were too weak to fight against great emperors.</p><p>“It seems like you want to die too! ”</p><p>To everyone’s surprise, Lu Ming’s expression was calm and he spoke indifferently. He was actually threatening the great emperor.</p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded.</p><p>They had thought that Lu Ming would be afraid and terrified when he faced the great emperor and would run away.</p><p>He did not expect Lu Ming to threaten the great emperor.</p><p>Lu Ming1 s eyes flickered with a cold glint as he swept a glance at the other party.</p><p>The elder’s heart started to beat wildly as if he was being stared ar by a terrifying prehistoric beast. In the next moment, he was going to be torn apart and killed.</p><p>This feeling shocked him greatly.</p><p>“What’s going on? What a terrifying feeling. Could it be that Lu Ming’s abilities are already far above mine? no, I’ll retreat today!”</p><p>The Xuan family elder’s mind turned quickly, bur he didn’t dare to make a move.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
