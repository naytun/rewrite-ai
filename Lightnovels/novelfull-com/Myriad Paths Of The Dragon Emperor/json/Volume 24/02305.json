Many of them had the fighting strength of the great emperor realm. Some even had the fighting strength of the heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p>These zombies were all top powerhouses among body cultivators when they were alive.</p><p>In addition, there were also people from the Archean body cultivator lineage who were fighting with countless foreign races.</p><p>More than a dozen elders and a large number of body cultivators rushed out and attacked the foreign kinds.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Those old men had white hair. When they shouted, their qi and blood soared into the sky like smoke. Terrifying power burst out of their bodies, as if ancient barbaric Dragons were awakening.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Their attacks were simple. They simply punched out and the fist force shattered the void, killing a large number of alien races.</p><p>As for the zombies, they were even more direct and unafraid of death. They ignored defense and attacked madly.</p><p>For a time, the Archean body cultivators had the advantage.</p><p>The alien race attacked for a while, but they were forced back and retreated into the depths of the land of dusk.</p><p>However, the immemorial body cultivators didn’t dare to slack off and sent people to guard it.</p><p>As expected, every few days, the foreign races would attack again, and their overall strength was stronger than before.</p><p>The two sides were caught in a heated battle, and they fought continuously. After fighting for a while, the alien races would retreat, but after a while, they would attack again.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he had been cultivating.</p><p>Previously, he had spent two months to successfully cultivate the first three levels of the seven Gods mysterious technique.</p><p>After that, he used another month to successfully break through and step into the early stage of the fourth level.</p><p>After that, he spent another month cultivating the seven Gods mysterious technique to the middle of the fourth level.</p><p>Lu Ming had no choice but to stop cultivating at this point.</p><p>This was because he felt that his previous accumulation had been used up. He had reached a bottleneck and could not break through for the time being. He needed to Polish himself for a period of time.</p><p>Moreover, almost half of the energy of the ancestral dragon blood had been refined.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming opened his eyes and heaved a long sigh.</p><p>“My strength is so strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming felt the power in his body and was extremely excited.</p><p>This was physical strength, pure physical strength. Lu Ming could feel that his physical strength was dozens of times stronger than before.</p><p>the middle stage of the fourth level. Now, 1 should be able to fight against a level 13 true Emperor with just my physical strength!</p><p>Lu Ming speculated in his heart.</p><p>One should not underestimate this level of power. It was extremely terrifying, because this was purely the power of the physical body without any other factors.</p><p>In the past, although Lu Ming’s physical strength was strong, it was far inferior to what he had now.</p><p>At that time, Lu Ming’s physical strength, the world Energy, and the law would increase his strength.</p><p>However, it was impossible to rely on the strength of his physical body alone. At most, he would be equivalent to a low-level void Emperor.</p><p>But now, Lu Ming did not need to do anything. He could fight against a rank-13 true Emperor with his physical strength alone.</p><p>If he were to add the power of the world and the various laws, Lu Ming’s strength would reach a shocking level. It would far exceed the combat power of a rank 18 true Emperor.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming was facing a rank-18 true Emperor, he could completely crush his opponent.</p><p>Body cultivators, when combined with the nomological system, would burst forth with astonishing power.</p><p>my body’s defensive and recovery abilities have also been greatly enhanced. With the indestructible ancient scroll, I wonder what kind of shocking level it will reach!</p><p>Lu Ming could not imagine how amazing his combat power would be if he were to unleash his full power now.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what realm have you cultivated the seven Gods mysterious technique to?”</p><p>Honglu asked as he walked over.</p><p>“Middle stage of the 4th level!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Oh my God, you’ve reached the middle stage of the fourth level so quickly. You’re abnormal. I’ve been cultivating for decades and I’m only at the middle stage of the fourth level. You’re abnormal!</p><p>Honglu howled in grief, looking like he had suffered a blow.</p><p>Lu Ming touched his nose, speechless.</p><p>The reason why he had improved so quickly was mainly due to his previous accumulation.</p><p>In the past, his body had been tempered many times and was already very strong. With the help of the ancestral dragon’s blood and the perfection of the little heaven mysterious skill, he was able to be so fast.</p><p>In the future, the speed would slow down.</p><p>Besides, cultivating the body required a large amount of heaven and earth spiritual materials, including all kinds of spiritual herbs, Saint herbs, and Emperor herbs.</p><p>This time, he was completely relying on the energy of the ancestral dragon’s blood. That was why he didn’t need any medicinal herbs.</p><p>“Right, where are the seniors?”</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze across the room and asked.</p><p>they went to fight against the alien races. In the past two months, the alien races have been attacking more and more frequently. Many of our people have died in the battle!</p><p>Speaking up to here, Honglu’s expression was rather unsightly.</p><p>have the alien races already attacked?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression turned grave.</p><p>we can’t continue like this. The foreign tribes are too powerful and their numbers are endless. It’s not that I’m underestimating the strength of the Archean body cultivator, but if this continues, we won’t be able to hold on any longer!</p><p>Ren Chan also said.</p><p>“Then what should we do?”</p><p>Honglu was also a bit anxious.</p><p>“Let’s go to the front line. I want to talk to the seniors!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go!”</p><p>Hong Lu nodded, and immediately, the three of them headed towards the small world’s exit.</p><p>With their speed, it didn’t take long for them to arrive near the exit of the small world.</p><p>Near the exit of the small world, many buildings had been temporarily built. A large number of ancient body cultivators were stationed here.</p><p>When Lu Ming and the rest arrived, it was obvious that a huge battle had just taken place outside. Many people had just retreated from the outside.</p><p>In a huge stone Hall, a few Grand elders and more than 20 elders of the immemorial body cultivator lineage were having a meeting.</p><p>However, they all looked serious and frowned. The atmosphere in the stone Hall was very oppressive.</p><p>At this moment, a person reported that Honglu, Lu Ming, and the others were requesting an audience.</p><p>“Let them in!”</p><p>One of the Grand elders at the top spoke.</p><p>The Grand Supreme elders of the immemorial body cultivators were all powerhouses in the heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p>After a while, Lu Ming, Ren Chan, and Hong Lu walked in.</p><p>All eyes were on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kid, what level have you reached with the seven Gods mysterious skill?”</p><p>An old man asked curiously.</p><p>“Middle stage of the 4th level!”</p><p>Lu Ming answered honestly.</p><p>“Middle stage of the 4th level!”</p><p>The old men and some middle-aged men in the stone Hall widened their eyes.</p><p>They knew when Lu Ming had started cultivating. It had only been a few months and he had already cultivated the seven Gods mysterious technique to the middle of the fourth stage.</p><p>Even the elders and Grand elders, who had lived for a long time, could not help but be dumbfounded at this speed. They were so shocked that they could not speak..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
