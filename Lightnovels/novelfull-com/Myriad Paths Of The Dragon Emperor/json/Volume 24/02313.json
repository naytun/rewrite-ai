Whoever wants to fight can come up and challenge whoever you want!</p><p>“There are no rules. It’s a free-for-all battle!”</p><p>Lan Cheng explained with a smile. Then, he waved his hand and a huge fighting ring appeared in the middle of the square.</p><p>There was no banquet in the middle of rhe square. It was obvious that it was for sparring.</p><p>“Now, who’s going to fight first?”</p><p>Lan Cheng said.</p><p>“Then I’ll start by throwing the brick to guide the Jade!”</p><p>A voice was heard. Then, a young man in white rushed up the fighting ring.</p><p>This young man s gaze swept across the area of the younger generation, and his voice resounded throughout the entire place. “Fang Han, come up and fight!”</p><p>“I’m not afraid of you!”</p><p>The person who was challenged shouted and rushed up the fighting ring.</p><p>Without any unnecessary words, the two of them engaged in a fierce battle.</p><p>The two of them were just ordinary heaven” s favorites. They were not top-tier heaven’s favorites because they did not control an ultimate law. The laws they controlled were King path laws.</p><p>Both of them were at the empty Emperor realm. They exchanged blows and the battle was extremely intense.</p><p>The two of them exchanged hundreds of moves. In the end, the young man in white who went up the stage was more skilled and won.</p><p>The challenges continued, but the ones who started were all Ordinary Geniuses. The geniuses who had mastered an ultimate law did not fight.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming saw Long Chen, desolate force, and Huang Ling all challenge others.</p><p>Long Chen, Feng Ling, and the others had not comprehended an ultimate law. They had only comprehended King path laws.</p><p>After not seeing each other for many years, their strength had also made great progress. They had mastered three to four King path laws and their cultivation had reached the level of a four-star void Emperor.</p><p>Those who were not born to be children of God would not be able to comprehend an ultimate law after becoming a sovereign. The difficulty was extremely high.</p><p>However, as long as Long Chen, Feng Ling, and the others had not become emperors, they would have the opportunity to comprehend the ultimate Maxim.</p><p>Around the square, many important figures were drinking and chatting, watching with interest.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, three days had passed!</p><p>Three days later, almost all the ordinary paragons had fought. Finally, a Paragon who had mastered an ultimate law came to fight.</p><p>Many people immediately perked up and watched carefully.</p><p>A battle between top heaven’s favorites was more exciting. At the same cultivation level, one s combat power was stronger than normal heaven’s favorites.</p><p>Lu Ming saw LAN Yun, Yan Xi, and Xing Henghe making their moves.</p><p>Their talents were definitely top-notch, and they had all defeated their opponents one by one.</p><p>This was especially true for Heng Xinghe, who had challenged several people in a row and won.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not make a move. His goal was a hundred chaos gems. There was no use in making a move now. He just had to wait until the end.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, a tall and burly figure rushed up the fighting ring. His entire body was black, like an iron tower.</p><p>Violent virtue!</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>After not seeing him for many years, Bao de had become many times stronger. His muscles bulged, and he was filled with explosive power.</p><p>body cultivators. I didn’t think that there would be a prodigy of the body cultivator branch outside!</p><p>Beside Lu Ming, a few elders who were Archean body cultivators suddenly became interested. They stared at Bao de and sized him up curiously.</p><p>Bao de was like a wild dragon, and his gaze finally swept to a gray-robed young man.</p><p>“You, come up and fight!”</p><p>Bao de s voice echoed throughout the entire area.</p><p>The gray-robed young man was the one who had followed heavenly Emperor Kong Yin to the primordial realm. Furthermore, he had also cultivated the primordial cultivation system.</p><p>Back then, the gray-robed youth had challenged Bao de, ao ke, and the ancient devil by himself and had easily defeated them.</p><p>Bao de had always been brooding over this. Now that he had cultivated for many years and his strength had increased greatly, he naturally wanted to challenge the other party and regain his face.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The gray-robed young man rushed up the fighting ring.</p><p>“This time, I will defeat you alone!”</p><p>Bao de s eyes were filled with ferocity. He was like a giant beast with a terrifying aura.</p><p>“Make your move!”</p><p>The gray-robed young man spoke, and a powerful aura burst out from his body.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two of them moved at the same time, and they collided fiercely.</p><p>A deafening boom erupted in the fighting ring, and the two figures were forced to retreat.</p><p>The first move was a tie!</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>The two of them clashed again.</p><p>Many people were watching with great interest. Even some of the great emperor realm and heavenly Emperor realm powerhouses were watching seriously.</p><p>That was because the two of them cultivated the immemorial system!</p><p>Bao de, an immemorial body cultivator!</p><p>The gray-robed young man, primordial martial arts!</p><p>The two of them fought the strong head-on and exchanged dozens of moves in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Over the years, Bao de had become much stronger than before. He was actually able to fight with the gray-robed youth, and it was difficult to determine the victor in a short time.</p><p>One had to know that the gray-robed young man had easily defeated them back then.</p><p>This reminded Lu Ming of Celestial Emperor Kong Yin’s words. Some of the primordial realm’s top prodigies were as talented as the heaven realm’s prodigies. It was just that they had limited resources, so their cultivation levels were weaker. That was why their combat strength was far inferior to the heaven realm’s prodigies.</p><p>But now, the primordial realm’s prodigies had received the heaven realm”s resources, and their cultivation levels had quickly caught up. Now, they could truly fight against the heaven realm’s prodigies.</p><p>“This brat hei is not bad!”</p><p>An old Archean body cultivator next to Lu Ming said with an interested expression.</p><p>he’s indeed not bad. The physical cultivation technique he practices isn’t very brilliant, but he has such achievements. He’s indeed a peerless talent in physical cultivation. If he’s properly trained, his achievements will be limitless!</p><p>Another old man said.</p><p>It was obvious that the elders had a strong interest in brutal virtue.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>On the fighting ring, Bao de roared like a mad beast. His attacks were crazy. Towards the end, he even ignored his own defense and attacked crazily, adopting a fighting style where both sides would suffer.</p><p>This made the gray-robed young man’s face turn serious. In the end, he exchanged a few moves with Bao de in a row, and then floated backward, out of the fighting ring.</p><p>“I’m done, I admit defeat!”</p><p>The gray-robed youth said before returning to his seat.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Bao de grinned and laughed wildly. Finally, his gaze swept over the other young men.</p><p>He still wanted to fight!</p><p>“Bao de, that’s enough. Now it’s my turn!”</p><p>A voice was heard. Then, a figure rushed into the fighting ring. It was creak.</p><p>Bao de chuckled and got off the fighting ring. Then, he challenged a heaven realm’s proud Son of Heaven.</p><p>Furthermore, he had also defeated his opponent.</p><p>“What do these people from the primordial realm want to do? You all want to challenge the heaven realm’s prodigies?”</p><p>In the area for Young heaven’s favorites, a young man said coldly.</p><p>The expressions of many heaven realm paragons changed slightly as they looked at the primordial realm paragons, such as Tian Ming, Yuan Xin, and bubbles.</p><p>However, Tianming and Yuan Xin didn’t say anything. They just stared at the fighting ring.</p><p>Meanwhile, bubbles turned her head and looked around, not looking at the others..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
