They were extremely terrifying as they blasted toward the body cultivator Grand Elder.</p><p>The other non-human celestial emperors also launched a fierce attack.</p><p>The Grand Supreme elders who cultivated physical strength found it difficult to retreat to the ancient warship.</p><p>Among the immemorial body cultivators, there was an old man who was a peerless expert. His battle prowess was terrifying. Unfortunately, the foreign race also had such an expert who was able to hold him back.</p><p>&Nbsp; in the end, they had no choice but to order a few powerful zombies to launch a suicidal attack to temporarily hold back the enemy. The Grand elders seized the opportunity to board the sky-reaching warship.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>However, a few powerful zombies were blocked by the other party and were besieged. Their indestructible bodies were torn apart.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The heavenspan battleship rumbled and sailed toward the depths of the yellow spring.</p><p>“Stay!”</p><p>A total of six to seven foreign races were chasing after them. They were all heavenly Emperor existences.</p><p>They didn’t give up and unleashed terrifying attacks, wanting to blow up the sky-reaching battleship and bury all of them in the yellow Springs.</p><p>However, the body cultivators ‘Grand elders joined forces and blocked the other party’s attack.</p><p>Moreover, one of the most powerful Grand elders punched through the space, causing a heavenly Emperor alien to spit out blood. He fell back toward the yellow spring River.</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>The waves of the yellow spring River rolled up, and one of them hit the non-human heavenly Emperor. The heavenly Emperor shrieked miserably as his body flew around in the sky. His burly body quickly withered.</p><p>In the end, the celestial Emperor managed to block the corrosion of the netherworld’s water, but his aura was weak and he almost died.</p><p>The crowd gasped. The yellow spring water was indeed terrifying. Even a heavenly Emperor would be severely injured if hit by the yellow spring’s waves. What was the origin of this yellow spring water? how was it formed? Isn’t that too terrifying?</p><p>A heavenly Emperor stood at the peak of this world. Although the foreign heavenly Emperor was probably just an ordinary heavenly Emperor, it was shocking that some netherworld water could seriously injure him.</p><p>The other foreign celestial emperors all revealed looks of fear and didn’t dare to pursue.</p><p>If they were blasted into the yellow spring River, the consequences would be unpredictable.</p><p>If a heavenly Emperor was seriously injured by the waves, he would definitely die if he fell into the yellow spring River.</p><p>The non-humans could only watch as the warship sailed into the depths of the yellow Springs.</p><p>Everyone heaved a long sigh of relief. They had finally gotten rid of the pursuit of the non-humans.</p><p>At the same time, they were secretly surprised. They didn’t know what material the sky-reaching warship was made of, but it could actually sail on the yellow spring River without being damaged by the water.</p><p>Among the Archean body cultivators, a Grand Supreme elder informed them that the sky-reaching battleship was found in an ancient ruin by an Archean body cultivator ancestor.</p><p>Everyone could only let their imaginations run wild. What kind of ruin could obtain a treasure like the heavenspan battleship?</p><p>The sky-reaching warship was extremely huge. It sailed in the yellow spring River and followed the direction of the river water. No one knew where it was flowing to.</p><p>Everyone could only wait patiently.</p><p>A month later, the sky-connecting battleship had traveled a long distance, and there was nothing in front of it.</p><p>He had reached the edge of the netherworld realm.</p><p>However, the yellow spring River didn’t stop. Instead, it flowed into the void.</p><p>A River that wasn’t on the ground but connected to the void was truly shocking.</p><p>Everyone looked on in a daze.</p><p>He couldn’t help but sigh at the wonders of the heavens and earth.</p><p>The sky-reaching warship followed the yellow spring River and sailed into the void.</p><p>They looked around and saw the dark void in all directions. The yellow spring River was like a passage, and they had no idea where it flowed to.</p><p>At this point, all the Grand elders perked up.</p><p>It was recorded in the ancient books that the yellow spring River would pass through the battlefield between the taiqing heavenly region and the Hunyuan heavenly region. They had to concentrate and seize the fleeting opportunity to get out of here.</p><p>Time passed day by day.</p><p>They had no idea how far they had traveled in the dark void.</p><p>The place was silent, as if it was eternal.</p><p>“Look, what’s that?”</p><p>Suddenly, someone exclaimed and looked ahead in shock.</p><p>The others also looked over.</p><p>“That’s…”</p><p>Lu Ming was also shocked at what he saw. His eyes widened.</p><p>In front of the yellow spring River, at an unknown distance, a mountain emerged.</p><p>The mountain was in front of them, but no one was wrong. There was really a mountain.</p><p>there’s actually a huge mountain above the yellow spring River. I’ve never heard of it!</p><p>An old man sighed. He was the Grand Elder of body cultivators, but he had never heard of such a thing.</p><p>There was no such saying in the rumors about the yellow spring River in the past.</p><p>There were mountains on the yellow spring River?</p><p>The heavenspan battleship continued forward, but the mountain was still floating in front of it. It didn’t seem to be getting any closer.</p><p>“Could it be that that is the end of the yellow Springs?”</p><p>Someone mumbled.</p><p>The others were shocked!</p><p>The end of the yellow Springs was a mountain? This sounded really outrageous.</p><p>“We’re here, attack!”</p><p>At this moment, a Grand Elder roared. His blood and Qi were in turmoil as he threw a punch at the void to his right.</p><p>The power of this punch was shockingly strong. As it was thrown out, the space exploded continuously like paper.</p><p>At the same time, the other Supreme elders also made their moves, constantly blasting in that direction.</p><p>With so many experts attacking at the same time, the power was terrifying. The space was completely torn apart, and the situation outside could be seen.</p><p>Outside, it was a deathly silent land.</p><p>the battlefield! It’s that battlefield!</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He could tell that it was the battlefield between the taiqing heavenly region and the Hunyuan heavenly region. He could not be wrong.</p><p>As expected, the yellow spring River would pass through the battlefield between the taiqing heavenly region and the Hunyuan heavenly region. The distance between this place and the battlefield was very thin, and it was forcibly opened by several Supreme elders.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>A Grand Supreme elder was steering the sky-reaching battleship toward the spatial gap.</p><p>The cracks in the space were healing on their own. The other Grand elders kept bombarding the cracks in the space.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The sky-reaching warship successfully left the yellow spring River and rushed into the gap.</p><p>Not long after, the heavenspan battleship charged out of the spatial gap and landed on a piece of land, stirring up a cloud of dust.</p><p>“I’m back!”</p><p>Lu Ming sensed it carefully and was overjoyed.</p><p>This was definitely the battlefield. After going around in a big circle, Lu Ming returned to the battlefield again and brought back a large number of experts.</p><p>With the addition of this group of Archean body cultivators, the strength of two world city would also increase.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, we will follow you now!”</p><p>One of the Grand Supreme elders waved his hand and the heaven-connecting battleship shrunk rapidly. He put it away and smiled at Lu Ming..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
