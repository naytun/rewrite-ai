Lu Ming’s puppet is shockingly powerful. In my opinion, it’s even stronger than a five star great emperor. He can protect himself. If we stay, we’ll only be a hindrance to him!</p><p>One of the twins said.</p><p>that’s right. Let’s leave first so that Lu Ming can fight with all his might. We can’t help much even if we stay!</p><p>The other of the twin brothers said.</p><p>The old man sighed. He knew that what the twin brothers said made sense. Then, the few of them took advantage of the terrain below and quickly left this place.</p><p>High up in the sky, Lu Ming and the five stars great emperor realm fiery red Crow had already turned into white heat from the battle.</p><p>Lu Ming did not care about defense and completely suppressed the crow. They exchanged dozens of moves and the crow was already covered in blood.</p><p>!!..</p><p>One of its wings was almost cut off by Lu Ming, leaving only a thread hanging on it.</p><p>At the same time, his chest was also stabbed by Lu Ming and blood was flowing out.</p><p>With only one wing left, the crow’s speed was greatly reduced. It was no match for Lu Ming and could not even retreat.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a blow from the other party. His body swayed slightly, then he backhanded and stabbed with his sword.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>This sword had pierced through the other party’s heart.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The other party wailed and struggled violently. Its entire body was covered in fiery-red flames that surged toward Lu Ming. However, it had no effect on the celestial Thearch’s physical body.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming bellowed. Energy exploded wildly. The celestial Emperor sword trembled continuously and sword Qi whizzed out.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming slashed horizontally and finally split the crow’s body into two. Its soul was also annihilated by this attack.</p><p>The five star great emperor Crow had fallen.</p><p>not good! I’ve consumed too much energy!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>He had already used up a lot of energy to kill so many fiery red crows, and the amount of energy he had used to fight this five star great emperor was even more terrifying.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming felt that the energy in the celestial Thearch’s physical body was about to be exhausted. He had no more energy to continue killing the remaining crows.</p><p>A ray of light emanated from Lu Ming’s body and enveloped the crow’s corpse. He then kept the crow’s corpse into his small world.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming dashed in the direction of the ground at top speed.</p><p>The crows that blocked his way were killed one by one. Lu Ming had successfully broken out of the encirclement.</p><p>However, at this moment, the celestial Thearch’s body trembled and shrank rapidly. Lu Ming’s body flew out of the celestial Thearch’s body.</p><p>The energy in Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body had been completely exhausted.</p><p>Lu Ming put away the celestial Thearch’s physical body and fled frantically.</p><p>When the crows saw Lu Ming put away the celestial Thearch’s corporeal body, they let out ear-piercing cries and chased after him.</p><p>Among them, there were more than a dozen great emperor fire-red crows. Many of them were even two star great emperor crows. If Lu Ming was surrounded, he would be in great danger.</p><p>Lu Ming spread his six-feathered divine wings and flew into the distance at top speed. The crows were chasing after him at top speed.</p><p>The two sides, one running and one chasing, crossed a long distance.</p><p>The crows bit Lu Ming’s tail, but he was extremely fast when he used his six-feathered wings. Only the great emperor crows could barely keep up with him.</p><p>Not long after, a boundless desert appeared in front of them.</p><p>The ground was covered in fine golden sand, and there were waves of heat coming from far away.</p><p>Lu Ming dashed into the desert area.</p><p>The strange thing was that after Lu Ming rushed into the desert area, the crows actually stopped. They wandered around for a while and then left one after another.</p><p>This made Lu Ming very curious.</p><p>“These crows aren’t going to enter the desert. Is it because of the area they’re in, or is there something terrifying in the desert that makes them afraid?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was filled with thoughts. He did not dare to be careless. He cast the divine breath technique and completely concealed his aura.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming headed deeper into the desert.</p><p>This desert was filled with fine golden sand. It stretched as far as the eye could see, and the temperature was shockingly high.</p><p>The temperature here did not come from the sun in the sky, but from underground.</p><p>Under the ground, the temperature was constantly rising, and the heat was unbearable.</p><p>In addition to the pressure from the heaven and earth, if a true Emperor were here, he would definitely not be able to withstand it or resist it. However, it was still fine for Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming walked for a while and realized that the desert was dead silent. There was no vegetation or living creatures.</p><p>Other than fine sand, there was still fine sand.</p><p>Fortunately, there was always a sun hanging in the sky above the center of this Island.</p><p>This sun would never change its position, so it could be used as a basis for determining the direction.</p><p>As long as he walked towards the sun, he would be walking towards the center of the island.</p><p>Lu Ming had been walking in the desert for three days. There was nothing unusual or dangerous.</p><p>“Eh, a plant!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He saw a plant in front of him.</p><p>It had been three days since he entered the desert. This was the first time Lu Ming saw a plant.</p><p>There were still plants in such a high temperature. Lu Ming was interested and flew over.</p><p>It was a purple plant that was sparkling and resplendent, and its medicinal fragrance assailed the nostrils.</p><p>Emperor’s medicine. Without a doubt, this was an Emperor’s medicine.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was more interested in the root of the emperor’s medicine. There was a small pond there. There was some liquid in it that emitted a shocking energy essence.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He knew that this Emperor’s medicine was nurtured by the liquid in this small pool.</p><p>This liquid was very valuable.</p><p>this liquid contains a powerful life essence. Even in such a dangerous place, it can produce an Emperor’s medicine. It’s extraordinary. I need this spiritual liquid to cultivate the seven Gods mysterious technique, or it’ll be difficult for me to break through!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered!</p><p>At present, there was not much energy left in the drop of ancestral dragon blood in his heart. If he wanted to break through his physical body and cultivate the fifth level of the seven Gods mysterious technique, the remaining ancestral dragon blood was not enough. He needed other energy.</p><p>Of course, sacred medicine and Emperor’s medicine could also assist in the cultivation of the body. However, given Lu Ming’s current realm, he would need an extremely high-level Emperor’s medicine to be effective.</p><p>Lu Ming carefully dug out the emperor’s medicine and planted it in his small world. He then took out a Jade bottle and collected all the liquid in the small pool.</p><p>this liquid is enough for me to cultivate for a while. I’ll find a place to refine this liquid and see if 1 can break through to the fifth level of the seven Gods mysterious technique!</p><p>Many thoughts flashed through Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>At the moment, he did not plan to break through to the great emperor realm so quickly in his law system. He wanted to completely comprehend all the other ultimate laws before breaking through.</p><p>If he wanted to increase his combat power quickly, he could only cultivate an immemorial body cultivator and break through his physical body..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
