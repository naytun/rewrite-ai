All he could see were vast mountains.</p><p>“According to senior Hengyu, this should be Yuan mountain. I just don’t know where it is. Let’s find a place with people and ask!”</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming’s figure moved and he broke open space. He shuttled through the void at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>A few minutes later, Lu Ming saw a city. He went in and asked around, only to discover that this was the North of Mount Yuan.</p><p>Lu Ming found a large force nearby and borrowed their teleportation array to head to one of the nine great Holy Lands of Mount Yuan, the ancient Moon Holy Land.</p><p>It did not take long for Lu Ming to return to the ancient Moon Holy Land.</p><p>When Lu Ming walked out of the teleportation array outside the ancient Moon sanctuary, he immediately caused a commotion and was recognized by the people nearby.</p><p>Lu Ming was too famous in the ancient Moon Holy Land.</p><p>Back then, Lu Ming had joined forces with more than ten powerful forces in the ancient Moon Holy Land to destroy the Wind Clan in one fell swoop. There were also the Sirius tower, the Golden Crow clan, the WAN family, and other powerful forces, causing the power structure of the ancient Moon Holy Land to reshuffle and changing the situation.</p><p>Lu Ming was well-known in the ancient Moon Holy Land.</p><p>However, after that, Lu Ming disappeared. Now, after so many years, Lu Ming’s reappearance naturally caused a stir. Not long after, all the forces in the ancient Moon Holy Land knew that Lu Ming had returned.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had already arrived at the Dayan elixir Palace and met with uncle Kong.</p><p>After not seeing him for so many years, uncle Kong seemed to have aged even more. His face was filled with wrinkles.</p><p>Uncle Kong’s cultivation base should be at the two star great emperor realm, but according to him, he had been seriously injured in the last Heavenly Tribulation, and his origin had been injured. He had yet to recover, so his battle prowess was only slightly stronger than a one star great emperor, but not by much.</p><p>Otherwise, the Emperor of the Daluo heaven sect wouldn’t have dared to be so arrogant in front of uncle Kong.</p><p>And now, there weren’t many years left until uncle Kong’s next Heavenly Tribulation. With uncle Kong’s current condition, he wouldn’t be able to pass it.</p><p>“Hall Master, your cultivation …”</p><p>The moment uncle Kong saw Lu Ming, he felt that Lu Ming was extraordinary.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s cultivation base was only at the peak of the true Emperor stage, his qi and blood were extremely thick. He was like a prehistoric giant beast, giving off a terrifying feeling.</p><p>Even Uncle Kong could feel the pressure.</p><p>This caused uncle Kong to be extremely shocked, but at the same time, he was overjoyed.</p><p>The more powerful Lu Ming was, the happier he would be.</p><p>“Uncle Kong, I went to the heaven realm a while ago and had a fortuitous encounter. I cultivated an immemorial body cultivator, and my fleshly body is now equivalent to the great emperor realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming gave a simple explanation and uncle Kong was even more delighted.</p><p>“Uncle Kong, the MU clan hasn’t come looking for trouble all these years, has it?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>Back then, a great emperor from the MU clan had died here, and he had always been afraid that the MU clan would come looking for trouble.</p><p>the MU family is here to find trouble and avenge their Emperor. However, a powerful force in the divine destiny land has intervened. The MU family has been holding back all these years!</p><p>Uncle Kong explained.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded, the MU family. It’s fine if they don’t come. But if they don’t give up, I can only make a trip to the MU family!</p><p>With that, a storage ring appeared in Lu Ming’s hand. He handed it to uncle Kong and said,”Uncle Kong, this is for you!”</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Uncle Kong took it and scanned it with his spiritual sense. He couldn’t help but widen his eyes.</p><p>a fragment of the great path. This is a fragment of the great path. Hall Master, it’s a waste to give such a treasure to an old man like me. You should keep it for yourself!</p><p>Uncle Kong quickly passed the storage ring to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled, uncle Kong, please accept it. 1 have a lot of Dao fragments. 1 have enough for myself!</p><p>However, uncle Kong still wanted to return the fragment to Lu Ming. But Lu Ming was determined. In the end, uncle Kong accepted it.</p><p>Lu Ming gave uncle Kong a total of eighteen great Dao fragments, which was enough for uncle Kong to break through to the three star great emperor or even the four star great emperor.</p><p>As long as uncle Kong’s cultivation broke through, the injuries in his body would naturally heal, and he would be able to pass the next Heavenly Tribulation with 100% certainty.</p><p>After that, he chatted with uncle Kong for a while.</p><p>The next day, Lu Ming went to meet some old friends.</p><p>Lu Ming still had some friends in the ancient Moon Holy Land, such as mu Qingxue, ye Dongfang, and so on. Their talents were limited and they did not go to the heaven realm.</p><p>Lu Ming stayed in the ancient Moon Holy Land for more than ten days to talk about martial arts with his good friends. With Lu Ming’s current realm and understanding of the laws, he was unfathomable to ye Dongfang and the rest.</p><p>Lu Ming’s casual advice could enlighten them and they benefited a lot.</p><p>More than ten days later, Lu Ming left some resources for ye Dongfang and the rest, then bade farewell to uncle Kong and left the ancient Moon sanctuary, heading towards the Cang state.</p><p>The most important thing on his return trip was to return to the Azure continent and take a look at the divine wilderness continent. After that, he would move his family and friends to another cultivation place.</p><p>A few days after Lu Ming returned to the ancient Moon Holy Land, the news spread to the Heng family and he family of the heaven Emperor City, as well as the Daluo heaven sect of the ancient sun Holy Land.</p><p>The he family and the Heng family had been mortal enemies, but now they had gathered together to discuss something.</p><p>Emperor he, Emperor Heng, and Emperor Tian Luo were sitting in a Great Hall of the Heng family.</p><p>“You two, Lu Ming has disappeared for many years. I’m afraid it’s not good for us to see him now that he has suddenly reappeared!”</p><p>Said the Emperor of the Heng family with a serious expression.</p><p>Lu Ming can’t become a celestial Thearch. He’s not afraid of himself. However, it’s troublesome that he can control the celestial Thearch’s physical body!</p><p>The tianluo Emperor said. He had seen the power of the heavenly Emperor’s corporeal body before. Even the two-star great emperor of the MU family had been killed.</p><p>“Then what should we do? Back then, we all wanted to kill him. We are already mortal enemies with Lu Ming. He will definitely not let us off!”</p><p>The great emperor of the he clan said.</p><p>The three of them had a serious look on their faces. For a moment, they didn’t know what to do.</p><p>The three of them were one star great emperors, but Lu Ming controlled the celestial Thearch’s physical body and could even kill two star great emperors. Even if they joined forces, they would still be in danger.</p><p>At this moment, someone outside reported that there was important news. The great emperor of the Heng family had asked that person to come in.</p><p>“Master, young master Xinghe is back!”</p><p>An old man came in and said excitedly.</p><p>Xinghe is back! Hurry, please!</p><p>Emperor Heng was overjoyed.</p><p>The Heng Xing River led to the heaven realm, and he had been gone for decades. Now that he had returned, he didn’t know what realm he would be at. The Emperor of the Heng clan was filled with anticipation.</p><p>The three of them went out together and soon saw the Galaxy.</p><p>A person from the star River stood with his hands behind his back, giving off a feeling of superiority.</p><p>“The three great emperors are here, just nice!”</p><p>When he saw the three great emperors, Xing Chen only nodded slightly. He no longer had the respect he had in the past.</p><p>He had seen too many great emperors in the heaven realm, including many heavenly emperors. Naturally, he did not have that kind of respect for great emperors.</p><p>The three emperors of the Heng family were not surprised. When Lu Ming saw the Galaxy, he was shocked.</p><p>“True Emperor, Xinghe, you’ve broken through to the true Emperor realm?”</p><p>The Heng clan Emperor said excitedly.</p><p>“I just broke through not long ago!”</p><p>Xinghe nodded with a faint sense of pride on his face.</p><p>“Good, hahaha!”</p><p>The Emperor of the Heng family laughed and was extremely excited.</p><p>On the side, the great emperors of the he family and the Tian Luo Emperor were filled with envy.</p><p>To reach the true Emperor realm at such a young age, such talent was simply astonishing. In the future, breaking through to the great emperor realm was a sure thing, or even higher.</p><p>How could people not be envious of the Heng family for having such a genius?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
