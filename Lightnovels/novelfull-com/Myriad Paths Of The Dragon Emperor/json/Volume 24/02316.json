If you don’t make a move, then 1’11 make a move!”</p><p>Paopao mumbled before suddenly charging towards the other party. His speed was extremely fast, as though he was travelling through the void.</p><p>Ou yabing did not dare to be careless. He used the divine weapon seal technique and surrounded his body with all sorts of weapons.</p><p>The weapon trembled and shattered the void, stopping the bubbles from attacking.</p><p>Ou yabing’s strength was indeed much stronger than Yuan Xin’s. His combat strength was shocking and could already affect bubbles ‘spacetime law.</p><p>Therefore, bubbles naturally could not defeat ou Yeming as easily as she did with Yuan Xin.</p><p>However, after the two of them exchanged blows, bubbles still had the upper hand.</p><p>Bubbles ‘figure flickered. No matter how ou Yeming attacked, he could not hit bubbles. In fact, under the influence of bubbles’ spacetime laws, ou Yeming’s speed had slowed down significantly. The speed at which he could form the divine weapon seal had also slowed down significantly. After a few dozen moves, he was sent flying by bubbles and was severely injured.</p><p>Ou yabing had been defeated again!</p><p>He was so angry that he wanted to vomit blood.</p><p>He had suffered two consecutive defeats today, both at the hands of the primordial realm’s elites.</p><p>the space-time spirit mouse’s talent is indeed amazing. It’s only been a few years, and it’s already reached this level!</p><p>that’s only natural. The top ten beasts will all be peak experts when they mature!</p><p>what do you guys think of the space-time spirit rat’s combat strength compared to Tianming’s?”</p><p>it’s hard to say. I feel like the space-time spirit mouse is stronger!</p><p>“Not necessarily!”</p><p>Many people discussed animatedly. While they were shocked, they couldn’t help but compare Tianming with Papa.</p><p>Both of them had defeated ou yabing. It could be said that they were standing at the peak of the empty Emperor realm.</p><p>However, it was really hard to compare who was stronger.</p><p>&Nbsp; in terms of laws, the fate laws were indeed stronger, even stronger than the spacetime laws.</p><p>However, a law also depended on who was using it.</p><p>The space-time spirit mouse was born with the ability to control the space-time laws. No living creature could compare to the space-time spirit mouse in the use of the space-time laws.</p><p>Those so-called sons of God could control the laws of time and space, but they were far inferior to the space-time spirit rat in the use of the laws.</p><p>Therefore, it was hard to say who would win.</p><p>Many people were curious. Would Pao Pao challenge the heavens next?</p><p>However, everyone was disappointed. Bubbles did not challenge Tianming. As if she had had enough fun, she left the fighting ring in a flash.</p><p>After the bubble disappeared, no one at the empty Emperor realm went up to challenge him.</p><p>Many people revealed looks of anticipation.</p><p>Next, it was the main event, the battle between the nine Jue.</p><p>This time, the reason why so many people had come was to watch the battle between the nine absolutes.</p><p>More than a decade ago, the nine uniques had fought each other and ranked each other. In the past ten years, the nine uniques had rarely fought.</p><p>Everyone wanted to see if there had been any changes in the ranking of the nine uniques in the past ten years.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A figure rushed up the fighting ring.</p><p>It was the Black Tortoise forest!</p><p>as expected, he is the first one to make a move. The Black Tortoise forest is ranked last among the nine absolutes!</p><p>“I wonder if he’ll be able to charge up this time!”</p><p>it’s hard to say. None of the nine absolutes are weak. We’ll only know after we fight!</p><p>Everyone expressed their own opinions.</p><p>Next, the Xuanwu forest began to issue challenges. The heaven’s favorite he challenged was ranked eighth among the nine absolutes.</p><p>The two of them exchanged many moves, but in the end, the Black Tortoise forest was defeated. He was no match for the other.</p><p>The Black Tortoise forest wasn’t willing to give up. After taking a pill to adjust his condition to the peak, he challenged the seventh-ranked genius, but he was still defeated.</p><p>In the end, he was helpless and did not continue to challenge. His ranking remained at ninth place.</p><p>Following that, it was all the duels between the nine absolutes, and the intense battles continued.</p><p>The nine absolutes were all existences who had stepped into the true Emperor realm a long time ago. Their powerful combat strength attracted everyone’s attention.</p><p>This was especially true for the heaven’s favorites below the void Thearch level. They could learn a lot by watching carefully.</p><p>The exciting battles continued one after another.</p><p>However, there were very few changes in the rankings.</p><p>In the past, those who were ranked higher would indeed have stronger combat strength. It was still the same until now.</p><p>There was only one change. The fifth-ranked heaven’s favorite defeated the fourth-ranked heaven’s favorite and replaced his position.</p><p>As for the others, the rankings basically didn’t change.</p><p>Soon, the third-ranked genius defeated his opponent. He turned his eyes to Xuanyuan Yi and Lin Xiaofeng.</p><p>In the end, he challenged Xuanyuan Yi, who was ranked second.</p><p>“You’re overestimating yourself!”</p><p>Xuanyuan Yi stepped forward and landed on the fighting ring.</p><p>“I will defeat you within ten moves!”</p><p>Xuanyuan Yi said indifferently, full of confidence.</p><p>ten moves? Xuanyuan Yi, you’re overconfident!</p><p>The third-ranked genius. His expression was a little unsightly.</p><p>I’m already giving you too much credit by saying ten moves. Do you understand?”</p><p>let’s go! Xuanyuan Yi said indifferently as he charged toward the third-ranked youth.</p><p>The person in third place was a young man in blue. He had fought with a Prince of a foreign race outside of two world city and was defeated.</p><p>Back then, he had the battle power of an eighth level true Emperor.</p><p>Now, his combat strength had undoubtedly become stronger.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The young man in blue exploded with all his strength and attacked with a terrifying sacred art.</p><p>“Tenth level true Emperor battle power!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>The young man in blue was much stronger than when he fought the non-human Prince. His fighting power had increased by two stages, reaching the fighting power of a tenth stage true Emperor.</p><p>It was already extremely shocking to have such combat strength at this age.</p><p>Unfortunately, he had run into Xuanyuan Yi!</p><p>World power surged from Xuanyuan Yi’s body, and nomological laws permeated the air. A heavenly halberd appeared in his hand.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The heavenly halberd was incomparably huge. It became the size of a mountain and slashed towards the blue-robed young man.</p><p>The heavenly halberd was indestructible and extremely powerful. As it slashed down, all of the attacks and defenses of the young man in blue were completely destroyed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The blue-shirted young man’s body retreated frantically. He was directly blasted tens of thousands of meters away, and his face was abnormally pale.</p><p>A deep wound appeared on his body. It was so deep that his bones could be seen, and blood was flowing out.</p><p>One move and he was severely injured!</p><p>I’ve already shown you mercy. Otherwise, you’d be dead. I’ve said it before. I’ll defeat you in ten moves. Otherwise, I’ll defeat you in one move!</p><p>Xuanyuan Yi said, and the blue-robed youth’s expression turned ugly.</p><p>One move. Xuanyuan Yi had really defeated him in one move. The difference in combat strength between the two was too great.</p><p>The scene was silent, and many people were tongue-tied. This result was far beyond their expectations.</p><p>The young man in blue, ranked third among the nine absolutes, had been defeated in one move despite the huge difference in combat strength between him and Xuanyuan Yi.</p><p>Everyone had thought that even if the young man in blue was no match for Xuanyuan Yi, they would still be able to fight. However, the result was completely one-sided.</p><p>he’s a tenth level true Emperor, but he couldn’t even withstand a single blow and was easily crushed. What level is Xuanyuan Yi’s combat strength? ”</p><p>at least a rank 12 true Emperor. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to defeat them so easily. In fact, he might even have more than that!</p><p>no wonder the LAN family offered 100 stones of chaos as a reward. Could it be that Xuanyuan Yi can really defeat Lin Xiaofeng? ”</p><p>Many people were discussing and guessing in shock..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
