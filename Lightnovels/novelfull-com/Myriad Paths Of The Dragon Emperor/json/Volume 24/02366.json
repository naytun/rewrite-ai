A terrifying killing intent spread from the front.</p><p>Lu Ming, Emperor notionless, huntian Emperor, and Sky Fire Emperor’s expressions changed drastically.</p><p>That was because the roar was so terrifying that it made people’s hair stand on end.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming and the rest saw streaks of rainbow light flying over at high speed from the distant sky. They were all flying over from the depths of the void God Island.</p><p>There was an expert in each of the rainbow lights. Each of them was very terrifying, and none of them was weaker than LAN Kang.</p><p>This meant that these people were all advanced great emperors. Some of them had extremely terrifying auras, which made Lu Ming feel apprehensive.</p><p>Peak Emperor!</p><p>Lu Ming could tell that a few of them had already reached the peak Emperor realm. There were heaven realm beings and evil god race beings among them.</p><p>But now, these people seemed to have encountered something terrifying and were fleeing at high speed.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Another roar came from the depths of the island. Then, a huge creature appeared in the sky.</p><p>A giant white Tiger stood on the ground. Its back was taller than the mountains. With a roar, the mountains exploded. Even though they were far away, Lu Ming and the others could feel a terrifying pressure coming from it.</p><p>“This … Could it be The White Tiger, one of the legendary divine beasts of the four directions?”</p><p>Emperor formless cried out in alarm.</p><p>“What? The divine beasts of the four directions!”</p><p>The expressions of Lu Ming and the rest changed drastically.</p><p>The Four Divine Beasts, the four legendary divine beasts, the Azure Dragon, the Vermillion Bird, The White Tiger, and the Black Tortoise!</p><p>It was said that the Four Divine Beasts were very ancient divine beasts in the heaven realm. They were extremely powerful and were no weaker than the top ten Battle Beasts. They were on the same level as the top ten Battle Beasts.</p><p>There were legends of the divine beasts of the four directions everywhere. There were even divine beasts of the four directions that appeared, but those weren’t the four of them in the legends. They only had the bloodline of the Four Divine Beasts.</p><p>Now, could it be that one had really appeared?</p><p>impossible! The true divine beasts of the four directions aren’t any weaker than the top ten Battle Beasts. Although this one is powerful, it’s not that powerful!</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The White tiger’s roar was like thunder. Its four limbs stomped on the ground, causing mountains to collapse and rocks to shake the sky. Its huge body rushed towards the fleeing experts.</p><p>Its eyes turned silver, and two silver sword lights slashed out.</p><p>A shrill scream was heard. An existence that was at least a five star great emperor was killed by the two sword lights in the air. He couldn’t resist at all. “Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared, turned around, and ran away with Emperor Wu Xiang and the rest.</p><p>However, the people behind them, as well as The White Tiger, were astonishingly fast. The distance between them was constantly closing.</p><p>“How unlucky!”</p><p>Lu Ming, Emperor notionless, and the other two sighed in their hearts. They had just escaped from the formation, and they had already encountered such a terrifying White Tiger. They were truly too unlucky.</p><p>“We don’t want to go in the same direction as those people!”</p><p>Emperor formless called out.</p><p>There must be a reason why The White Tiger was chasing those people. They immediately changed their direction and rushed to the side.</p><p>It was risky to do so. Once The White Tiger set its eyes on them, it would be easier for it to catch up to them.</p><p>However, they had no other choice now. With their strength, they couldn’t outrun the five star great emperors, six star great emperors, and even peak great emperors.</p><p>If he continued to run and was caught by The White Tiger, he would probably be killed with a single slap.</p><p>They could only take the risk.</p><p>They had made the right bet. The White Tiger let out a long roar and did not target them. Instead, it was chasing after the few strongest experts.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest did not stop. They ran for a distance before they stopped.</p><p>At this moment, The White Tiger had already run far away while chasing the others.</p><p>it seems that The White Tiger has its eyes on the strongest people. I guess those people have offended The White Tiger!</p><p>Huntian Emperor speculated.</p><p>I didn’t expect that there would be such a terrifying White Tiger on this Island. This White Tiger’s strength is definitely above the great emperor realm. Could it be an existence of the heavenly Emperor realm?”</p><p>Emperor Wu Xiang said.</p><p>Their expressions were grave.</p><p>Heavenly emperors could not enter the island. If The White Tiger was really at the heavenly Emperor stage, it would be terrifying and invincible.</p><p>Immediately, they left the place and headed into the distance, wanting to get as far away from The White Tiger as possible.</p><p>However, a few hours later, their expressions changed drastically.</p><p>That was because a shrill cry came from ahead. It was extremely sharp and pierced through time and space.</p><p>A large group of people ran for their lives. Some were from the heaven realm, and some were from the evil god race.</p><p>And behind these people, a huge Phoenix spread its wings and chased after them.</p><p>“Vermillion Bird!”</p><p>Lu Ming and the other three looked at each other, their voices hoarse.</p><p>First, he saw The White Tiger, and now, he saw the Vermilion Bird. Could it be that the Four Divine Beasts had all appeared?</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Without any hesitation, the four of them turned around and ran. This time, they were experienced and ran in the other direction. As expected, the Vermilion Bird was specifically targeting the strongest group.</p><p>Not long after, they successfully escaped.</p><p>“The White Tiger and the Vermillion Bird have both appeared. What’s happening in the depths of the island?”</p><p>Lu Ming and the other three were full of doubts.</p><p>Next, they found a hidden place to hide. For the next few days, they would hear terrifying roars from time to time. It was only after a few days that the roars disappeared.</p><p>At this moment, they came out of their hiding place and met some experts. Many of them were advanced great emperors.</p><p>They asked the other party, and as expected, they knew a lot.</p><p>In the past few years, the great emperor of the heaven realm and the great emperor of the evil god tribe had been wandering around the void God Island, killing and searching for treasures.</p><p>Even though the void God Island was huge, it had been almost completely searched over the past few years.</p><p>Some time ago, everyone had discovered a hidden place. That place was suspected to be the core of the void God Island, and it was very likely to be the place where the master of the void God Island would truly preach his Dao.</p><p>This discovery was amazing.</p><p>The master of the void God Island was a figure who should have surpassed the heavenly Emperor. If this was really the place where he taught Dao, he would probably have an incredible opportunity.</p><p>Many powerhouses gathered and planned to enter the place to explore. However, there were four terrifying divine beasts guarding the place, which were exactly the same as the legendary divine beasts of the four directions.</p><p>However, their combat strength was not as strong as the four legendary divine beasts. They should have barely reached the heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p>Even if they managed to reach the heavenly Emperor realm, they were not something that a great emperor could fight against. The Four Divine Beasts went on a rampage, causing a large number of experts from the heaven realm and the evil god tribe to fall. The remaining people were chased around by the Four Divine Beasts.</p><p>This was the reason why Lu Ming and the rest had encountered that scene earlier.</p><p>right now, the Four Divine Beasts are roaming in the depths of the island. All the experts have retreated to the depths of the island. They don’t dare to go in anymore, or it’ll be extremely dangerous!</p><p>A high-level great emperor sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart.</p><p>Originally, after his battle prowess had improved greatly, he had planned to go to the void God Island to try his luck. It seemed like he could only cancel this plan and stay in the outer region of the void God Island.</p><p>there must be some opportunities in that core area. Right now, there are many experts hiding in the outer regions of the void God Island, waiting for an opportunity to strike!</p><p>The expert left another sentence and then left..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
