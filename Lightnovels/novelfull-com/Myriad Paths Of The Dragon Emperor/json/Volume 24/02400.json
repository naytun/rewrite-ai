Whoosh!…</p><p>In the depths of the death god nation’s ancient city, more than 30 great emperors appeared.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>When they saw Lu Ming’s appearance, someone exclaimed in shock.</p><p>More than 30 great emperors stopped in their tracks, their eyes filled with fear. They did not expect Lu Ming to be the one to kill his way here.</p><p>The death god nation naturally knew about the battle at Aeon city. They never expected that Lu Ming would be able to find the headquarters of the death god nation.</p><p>They looked at Earth One and Thunder one behind Lu Ming and were even more frightened.</p><p>“Leave, leave this place!”</p><p>One of them roared and retreated.</p><p>There were heavenly Emperor powerhouses beside Lu Ming. How could they fight? they would only die if they went up to fight.</p><p>Now, they only wanted to escape, to escape from this place.</p><p>“Senior Earth One, senior Thunder one, I’ll have to trouble you!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Earth One and Thunder one.</p><p>With so many great emperors, if he wanted to kill them all, he could only ask Earth One and Thunder one to help.</p><p>“I alone am enough!”</p><p>let’s go! Lei Yi said first. Then, he turned into a bolt of lightning and rushed out.</p><p>Earth One laughed but didn’t make a move.</p><p>Zzzzzzz…</p><p>After Lei Yi rushed out, the sky suddenly filled with endless lightning.</p><p>Bolts of lightning, thicker than an arm, covered the sky like a spider web and shot towards the thirty-odd great emperor assassins.</p><p>These Thunderbolts were naturally not ordinary Thunderbolts. They were divine powers that Lei Yi had condensed with the heavenly Dao, and they were extremely powerful.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The great emperor realm assassins were struck by the lightning and turned into ashes before they could even scream.</p><p>Ordinary great emperors would be killed instantly by the heavenly Emperor.</p><p>More than thirty great emperor realm assassins were killed in an instant.</p><p>“All of you, die!”</p><p>Lei Yi did not stop. He waved one hand and a ball of lightning appeared in the sky. This ball of lightning floated in the sky above the ancient city and then exploded into countless Thunderbolts. Like raindrops, they bombarded the assassins in the ancient city.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>In an instant, countless assassins in the ancient city were killed by the lightning and turned into ashes.</p><p>There were countless assassins in the death god nation’s headquarters, but at this moment, almost all of them were wiped out.</p><p>“Also…”</p><p>At this moment, a cold light flashed in Lei Yi’s eyes as he headed deeper into the ancient city.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest followed him at top speed.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>In the depths of the ancient city, there were seven or eight figures that were moving extremely fast. They were running in another direction at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>“Peak Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>They were all peak great emperors.</p><p>The power of the death god nation was terrifying. One had to know that even a major force like the MU family only had two peak emperors.</p><p>There were a total of eight peak great emperors in the death god nation.</p><p>Moreover, their speed was astonishing. If it was only Lu Ming and dandan, they would not be able to stop them.</p><p>But now, with Earth One, Thunder one, and the others here, it was different.</p><p>“You still want to run in front of me?”</p><p>Lei Yi sneered and took a step forward. His figure turned into a flash of lightning and rushed out. He rushed out in an instant and caught up with the other party.</p><p>Zzzzzzz …</p><p>Lightning filled Lei Yi’s hand, forming a spear of lightning that pierced through.</p><p>“Quickly destroy that crystal Pagoda…”</p><p>At this time, one of the eight people shouted.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The next moment, the eight of them were pierced by the lightning Spears. Although the eight of them were peak great emperors, they were completely useless against a heavenly Emperor’s attack.</p><p>“All!”</p><p>A few of them let out ear-piercing shrieks as a black shadow twisted violently in their bodies.</p><p>There was a third eye in the middle of the black Shadow’s eyebrows.</p><p>“Evil god tribe!”</p><p>At the sight of this black shadow, Lu Ming was shocked. In an instant, he thought of many things.</p><p>Back then, the evil spirit religion and the demon spirit religion were also founded by the evil god race.</p><p>It was obvious that the death god nation was the same as the evil spirit religion and the demon spirit religion. They were all created by the evil god race.</p><p>No wonder they often assassinated the experts and proud Children of Heaven in the primordial realm.</p><p>The figures twisted a few times before turning into ashes and dissipating.</p><p>The crystal Pagoda…</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming thought of the crystal Pagoda.</p><p>Before the evil god tribe’s expert died, he shouted,’quickly destroy that crystal Pagoda!’ For an expert of the evil god tribe to still think about it even before his death, that crystal Pagoda must be very important.</p><p>“Find that crystal Pagoda!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>“I found it!”</p><p>Bubble spoke. Then, she waved her hands and a space-time Tunnel appeared in the air. On the other side of the space-time Tunnel was a three-meter tall Crystal Tower. It was shining and covered in all sorts of runes.</p><p>Two assassins in black were heading toward the crystal Pagoda at top speed.</p><p>They were obviously going to destroy it.</p><p>“In front of this old master, don’t even think about it!”</p><p>Zzzzzzz …</p><p>Lei Yi rushed through the space-time Tunnel. Two bolts of lightning burst out and killed the two men in Black.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming, dandan, bubbles, and tu Yi also rushed over through the space-time Tunnel and arrived at the crystal Pagoda.</p><p>The crystal Pagoda was covered in symbols and was extremely colorful.</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at it carefully and was somewhat puzzled.</p><p>Could it be the base of a great formation?</p><p>“So it’s this kind of thing!”</p><p>Dandan touched her chin and revealed a thoughtful look.</p><p>“Dandan, do you know what this is?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>of course I do. This is the most ancient tool for transmitting information. It has almost been lost. It seems like the evil god tribe still has this tool for transmitting information!</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>a tool to send messages? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. dandan, ” he said, can you interpret the information inside? ”</p><p>The evil god tribe’s information-transmitting tool was something that they valued so much. There might be some incredible information inside.</p><p>“Young master, I’ll go and deal with the rest!”</p><p>Lei Yi’s figure flickered and he left the place.</p><p>As for dandan, she was wandering around the crystal Pagoda and began to study it.</p><p>After a while, Lei Yi returned. Apparently, he had killed all the assassins and brought back all their storage rings.</p><p>This was an extremely huge harvest. The death god nation had accumulated so many resources over the years and they were shockingly abundant. All of them now belonged to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming kept all of them.</p><p>In the future, if the Dragon Alliance wanted to develop, it would definitely need</p><p>a huge amount of resources. The more they accumulated, the better.</p><p>Dandan continued to study it. After a few hours, dandan finally began to work.</p><p>Runes entered the crystal Pagoda one after another.</p><p>“Open!”</p><p>After dandan circled the Crystal Tower Three hundred and sixty times, she let out a low growl and took a step forward. Countless runes covered the Crystal Tower.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The crystal Pagoda buzzed and glowed brightly. Then, information began to spread out from the crystal Pagoda.</p><p>It was very strange. They stood by the crystal Pagoda and could clearly access the information.</p><p>In fact, there were even images emerging.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>When Lu Ming came into contact with some information, his pupils suddenly widened and he was shocked.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
