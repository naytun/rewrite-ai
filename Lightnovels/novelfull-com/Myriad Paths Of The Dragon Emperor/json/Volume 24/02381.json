Your cultivation has improved quite quickly!”</p><p>Lu Ming touched bubbles ‘head.</p><p>After not seeing each other for many years, Lu Ming realized that bubbles ‘cultivation was almost at the peak of the true Emperor stage. There were not many people in the younger generation in the heaven realm who could match her cultivation.</p><p>This cultivation speed was already very terrifying. Of course, it was still incomparable to dandan.</p><p>After all, dandan was the divine turtle from the ancient times. Although bubbles was one of the top ten war beasts, she was a newborn and had to rely on herself to comprehend everything.</p><p>“I can’t be compared to brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>The bubble hung on Lu Ming’s neck and swayed.</p><p>“The LAN family and the Yan family are here!”</p><p>At this moment, a voice was heard. Many people looked in the same direction.</p><p>A group of people flew over from the other side.</p><p>The one leading them was the LAN family’s old ancestor, a peerless expert.</p><p>Behind the LAN family patriarch was the patriarch of the LAN family, Lan Cheng, and the celestial Thearch of the Yan family.</p><p>Behind them were some higher-ups of the two families.</p><p>Almost all the higher-ups of the LAN family and the Yan family were present. They landed on the square and walked toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The LAN family’s patriarch’s face was full of smiles. He cupped his fists at Lu Ming and said,”We’re late. Brother Lu Ming, please forgive us!”</p><p>“You’re welcome!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a faint smile on his face.</p><p>“I’ll cut to the chase. I’m here today to apologize to little brother Lu Ming. All these years, the LAN family has gone too far in certain aspects and offended little brother Lu Ming. 1 hope that little brother Lu Ming can forgive us!”</p><p>The LAN clan’s ancestor cupped his fists.</p><p>Although they knew that the LAN family would apologize, many people were still stunned when they saw the patriarch of the LAN family talking to Lu Ming in an affable manner. They thought that they were in a dream.</p><p>One should know that the LAN family’s patriarch was a peerless expert, a four-star heavenly Emperor.</p><p>Such a person was already standing at the peak with shocking combat strength. But now, he was bowing down and apologizing to a junior. It was rare since ancient times.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not want to accept the other party’s apology so easily.</p><p>“Oh, I’d like to know, in what way have you offended me? Clan head LAN, why don’t you help me memorize it?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and looked at LAN city.</p><p>Lan Cheng’s face turned ugly.</p><p>However, he still squeezed out a smile and stepped forward. “The LAN family has indeed offended brother Lu Ming in some ways in the past. Please forgive us!”</p><p>“Forgive? Let me ask you, in what way have you offended me? tell me clearly, do you not understand?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>Lan Cheng’s heart was filled with anger. If any other junior dared to speak to him like this, he would have slapped them to death.</p><p>However, he did not dare to do so to Lu Ming.</p><p>He dared to bet that there were many heavenly emperors in the vicinity. If he made a move, he would be the one to be slapped to death.</p><p>In the end, he could only suppress his anger and answer honestly.</p><p>“Back then, it was the LAN family’s prodigy, LAN Yun, who offended little brother Lu Ming and targeted him time and time again. That’s why both parties were at odds with each other!”</p><p>Lan Cheng answered honestly.</p><p>“What else?”</p><p>Lu Ming continued asking.</p><p>also, also, back then, 1 was blinded by greed. I coveted your indestructible ancient scroll, and I sent people to kill you on the battlefield outside two world city!</p><p>Lan Cheng gritted his teeth and told him about this matter.</p><p>He knew that Lu Ming wanted them to apologize in public because he wanted to make everything public. If he did not say it today, Lu Ming would definitely not let it go.</p><p>As soon as he said this, the crowd was in an uproar. Everyone suddenly realized.</p><p>Back then, the LAN family said that Lu Ming killed heaven realm powerhouses on the battlefield of true emperors in order to snatch the treasure. All of this was false.</p><p>It was all because of the Yan family’s celestial Thearch in LAN city, who coveted Lu Ming’s indestructible ancient scroll and wanted to kill him. “Despicable, truly despicable!”</p><p>so this is the LAN family’s true colors. Despicable scoundrels. We were all deceived by them!</p><p>“I knew it. Lu Ming would not do such a thing!”</p><p>Many people roared and glared at the LAN family.</p><p>Lan Cheng gritted his teeth. However, he could only swallow this bitter fruit.</p><p>It was his fault for offending a pervert like Lu Ming.</p><p>“The LAN family has offended you. Please forgive us, brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>“The Yan family has offended you. Please forgive us, brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>In LAN city, the Yan family’s heavenly Emperor cupped his fists and saluted Lu Ming.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, this is a small gift from the LAN family and the Yan family. Please accept it!”</p><p>The LAN family’s patriarch smiled apologetically and took out a storage ring. With a wave of his hand, the storage ring flew slowly towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming reached out and took it. He scanned it with his spiritual senses and found that there were exactly five hundred chaos gems inside.</p><p>“Remember, if people don’t offend me, I won’t offend them. 1 can write off the past, but if you offend me again, 1’11 definitely exterminate your entire family!”</p><p>Lu Ming put away the storage ring and turned to leave. He did not look at the LAN family and Yan family anymore.</p><p>Huang Ling, Long Chen, brother Ouyang… Let’s go for a drink, today’s harvest is not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Long Chen, Feng Ling, and the rest.</p><p>1’11 drink, 1’11 definitely drink, and I’ll drink to my heart’s content!</p><p>The unscrupulous monk was the first to cry out.</p><p>“What are you drinking, monk!”</p><p>Desolate power looked down on them. Everyone laughed. Amidst the laughter, the group of young people left.</p><p>Lu Ming bought a large amount of fine wine and came to his residence. He took out a lot of divine beast flesh.</p><p>Over the years, Lu Ming had hoarded a lot of divine beast flesh and blood, all of which were at least Overlord-tier. Everyone started to work and soon, the smell of meat filled the air.</p><p>Everyone was eating meat and drinking wine, chatting about the interesting things they had encountered over the years.</p><p>During this period, Lu Ming took out a large number of resources and distributed them to everyone.</p><p>For example, Supreme-grade raw gemstones, primordial chaos stones, and chaos stones.</p><p>The crowd started to reject it because it was too precious.</p><p>However, when Lu Ming took out a bunch of them, they did not reject him. They accepted some from each of them. These resources could indeed greatly speed up their cultivation.</p><p>It wasn’t until the evening of the second day that the crowd dispersed.</p><p>“I should return to the primordial realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. He then looked for heavenly Emperor Heng Yu and asked for the way back to the primordial realm.</p><p>It was relatively easy to go to the primordial realm in the taiqing heavenly region, as there were many passages.</p><p>Two world city had such a passage.</p><p>Alone, Lu Ming and the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor arrived at a Valley, which was guarded by powerful cultivators.</p><p>The space in the valley was extremely unstable. Spatial cracks kept appearing. One could clearly see that behind the spatial cracks was a void passage.</p><p>The passage was not large, but it was enough to accommodate dozens of people at the same time.</p><p>“Senior Hengyu, take care!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and stepped into the space crack. In a flash, he was in the void channel.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward. He seemed to see an endless void passing by him.</p><p>After an unknown period of time, a bright light appeared in front of him. Lu Ming rushed out and found himself standing in the sky.</p><p>Below him was the boundless earth.</p><p>Primordial realm, Lu Ming had returned!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
