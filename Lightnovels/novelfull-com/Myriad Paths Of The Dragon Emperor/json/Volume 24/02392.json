Their auras were as vast as the ocean, filling the entire Aeon city with a terrifying pressure.</p><p>This lineup made the surrounding onlookers ‘faces change and their hearts tremble.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s expression was calm as if he didn’t see so many great emperors. His gaze swept across the MU family and he frowned.”There’s no need to hide anymore. Those families, come out!”</p><p>The families he was talking about were the Heng family, the he family, and the Daluo heaven sect.</p><p>However, the MU family master sneered and did not answer Lu Ming’s question. Instead, he asked, ” “Lu Ming, you attacked the MU family for no reason today. Do you really think that the MU family is easy to bully? If you don’t give me an explanation today, don’t even think about leaving!”</p><p>“Don’t you know why I’m here? You, the MU family, the Heng family, the he family, and the Daluo heaven sect hired people from the death god nation to kill me. It’s time to settle the score today!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was heard by everyone.</p><p>“What? The MU family had hired people from the death god nation to kill Lu Ming? Is that true?”</p><p>“It’s very possible. Back then, Lu Ming killed the MU family’s most powerful genius, Mu yang. This is a blood feud. How could the MU family let this matter rest?”</p><p>“Indeed. I’m afraid it’s true. Otherwise, Lu Ming wouldn’t have come to the MU family!”</p><p>“Lu Ming is really bold to come to the MU family on his own. What do you think will be the result today?”</p><p>“It’s hard to say. If Lu Ming wasn’t confident, he wouldn’t have dared to come here. However, the MU family has been around for countless years and their Foundation is unfathomable. The outcome can’t be predicted!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s words caused an uproar. Many people were discussing it.</p><p>“Nonsense! If the MU family wants to kill you, we don’t need to hire people from the death god nation. Any one of them can kill you!”</p><p>The head of the MU family sneered.</p><p>“Anyone can kill me? Then I’d like to see if your Mu family has the ability to do so!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. Then, he stepped out and headed toward the MU family.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>With every step Lu Ming took, the void trembled and rays of light shone from his body.</p><p>It was the radiance of the laws.</p><p>One, two, three…</p><p>All sorts of laws appeared.</p><p>When more than ten laws appeared, the scene was deathly silent. Everyone was tongue-tied and their eyes almost popped out.</p><p>“Heavens, what did the heavens just see? Chaos law, death law, life law, and reincarnation law. He has mastered four Supreme laws!”</p><p>no, that’s not right. There are also eternal laws, void laws, primordial chaos laws, and space-time laws. Eight. He controls eight Supreme laws!</p><p>there are still nine kinds of King path laws and seventeen kinds of laws. He has mastered seventeen kinds of laws!</p><p>furthermore, he has cultivated all 17 types of nomological laws to the limit and reached the third realm. How is this possible? how is this possible? he’s abnormal. He’s abnormal!</p><p>When they saw Lu Ming displaying all the laws, everyone in all directions screamed hysterically, unable to control their emotions.</p><p>This could no longer be described as shock. Their emotions were ten times, a hundred times, a thousand times stronger than shock…</p><p>The truth of cultivation was that a person could only master one type of ultimate law at most. Not everyone could master an ultimate law. Those who could master one were the top geniuses in the world.</p><p>But now, there was a person who had not only mastered an ultimate Maxim, but it was not just one, two, or three, but eight.</p><p>This was not only breaking the truth, but also trampling the truth to pieces. It was easy to imagine the feelings of everyone.</p><p>The people of the MU family were also dumbfounded. Their eyes were wide open and they were horrified.</p><p>In the depths of the MU family, the Masters of the Heng family, the he family, and the Daluo heaven sect, who were hiding in the dark, were almost scared to death when they saw this.</p><p>Lu Ming was shrouded in seventeen different lights. He stood in the air like a god who had descended to the mortal world. He was extraordinary.</p><p>“Come, let’s see which one of you can kill me!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up as he stared at the people of the MU family.</p><p>so what if you can control 17 types of laws? you’re still only in the true Emperor realm. I’ll kill you!</p><p>From the MU family, a burly old man stepped out, like a lion.</p><p>This old man’s cultivation had reached the three star great emperor realm.</p><p>In the end, the MU family did not dare to underestimate Lu Ming. Although Lu Ming seemed to be at the true Emperor realm, he had mastered seventeen types of laws. Most importantly, he had eight ultimate laws.</p><p>With so many laws combined, Lu Ming’s combat strength could not be measured with common sense. It was possible that he could fight a one star great emperor or even a two star great emperor.</p><p>However, they had sent out a three star great emperor.</p><p>The difference between a true Emperor and a three star great emperor was too great.</p><p>They did not believe that Lu Ming could kill a three star great emperor.</p><p>Even if a three star great emperor was no match for him, he could at least keep his life and test Lu Ming’s true combat strength.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The elder, who was as strong as a lion, had a wild aura. He stepped in the air and his speed increased as he charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>All of a sudden, a saber appeared in the elder’s hand and he slashed it at Lu Ming. The saber Light was shocking and lit up the sky as if it was going to split Aeon city’s sky in half.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently. Before he could finish his sentence, a long spear appeared in his hand. It was a long spear condensed by the law and the power of the world.</p><p>The muscles on Lu Ming’s arms bulged and he threw the long spear out.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The long spear flew out like a ray of light, faster than lightning.</p><p>The long spear not only contained the power of Lu Ming’s world force, the power of the law, but also the power of his physical body.</p><p>The moment the spear collided with the saber-light, the saber-light was destroyed. The speed of the spear did not decrease at all, and it continued to stab toward the opponent.</p><p>The MU family’s three-star great emperor did not expect that his all-out attack would be so vulnerable in Lu Ming’s hands. He was stunned for a moment. His fate had been decided.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear pierced through his dantian and destroyed his small world. He flew out with his body and into the depths of the MU clan, crashing into a Hall.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The palace exploded, and a large group of people flew out from it.</p><p>These people were from the Heng family, the he family, and the Daluo heaven sect.</p><p>The MU clan’s three star great emperor was impaled by Lu Ming’s spear and nailed to the ground, screaming in pain.</p><p>“My cultivation base, my cultivation base …”</p><p>A shrill scream reverberated through the entire area.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss…</p><p>Gasps could be heard in the audience.</p><p>A three-star great emperor was pinned to the ground by Lu Ming with one move and his cultivation was crippled. This scene was too impactful.</p><p>A three star great emperor couldn’t even withstand one blow!</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>Had Lu Ming’s combat strength already reached such a terrifying level? Everyone felt like they were in a dream.</p><p>In the crowd far away, there were also people from the Xuan family watching. There were a few elders, including Xuan Lin and Dongfang Xue Yu.</p><p>At this moment, they were completely petrified and kept gasping.</p><p>“How is that possible? How is that possible?”</p><p>Xuan Lin seemed to be in a daze as he kept muttering.</p><p>He had crippled a three star great emperor with one move.
