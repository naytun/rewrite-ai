A huge pit had been dug out in this plain, and in the pit, there was a huge Palace.</p><p>This was a Palace that was buried underground, and it had actually been discovered.</p><p>The palace’s door opened, and the few people in front flew in.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Not far away, a few more figures flew over. They were actually from the evil god tribe.</p><p>The few evil god tribe members cast a few cold glances at Lu Ming and the rest. They did not make a move and instead rushed into the door of the hall.</p><p>it seems like this underground Palace is quite impressive. It has attracted the experts from both sides!</p><p>Emperor Wu Xiang said.</p><p>The others nodded. They had been trapped in this formation for a year, and seven of the formation disks had already been found. Most likely, all the corners that could be searched had been searched.</p><p>It was very likely that the last array disc was in this underground Palace.</p><p>Furthermore, this Palace was hidden deep underground. Perhaps, it contained a great opportunity.</p><p>“Let’s go in and take a look!”</p><p>Skyfire Emperor said.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>let’s go! Lu Ming said and flew toward the palace’s door.</p><p>Behind the door was a huge passage that extended all the way forward. As soon as they flew in, they saw a light shining in front of them.</p><p>The few members of the evil god race who had flown in earlier were being attacked. The walls on both sides of the passageway were glowing, and mysterious runes appeared on them. They condensed into rays of light that shot toward the evil god race members.</p><p>The few evil god race members tried their best to defend as they advanced.</p><p>“There’s a formation here!”</p><p>Lu Ming reminded them and the four of them were on high alert.</p><p>As soon as they entered the passage, the walls on both sides of the passage emitted a dazzling light that blasted toward them.</p><p>These radiances were like rays of divine light, their power shocking.</p><p>The four of them set up layers of defense to resist the light.</p><p>Fortunately, although the light was powerful and could even pose a threat to one star great emperors, it wasn’t much of a threat to them. The four of them quickly advanced into the depths of the tunnel.</p><p>The faces of the few evil god tribe members in front changed drastically when they saw how fast Lu Ming and the others were. They exerted all their strength and wanted to pass through the passageway quickly, afraid that Lu Ming and the others would catch up to them.</p><p>However, there were a total of three of them. Two of them were two star great emperors, and the other one was a one star great emperor. Their speed couldn’t keep up with Lu Ming’s group at all. After more than ten minutes, Lu Ming’s group had caught up with them.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>kill them! Lu Ming said coldly. There was nothing to say when they encountered the evil god tribe. They could only kill them.</p><p>“You’re the one who’s going to die!”</p><p>A two star great emperor from the evil god race roared in anger and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s current combat strength was not any weaker than a three star great emperor. He was extremely powerful. After one move, the evil god tribe members were sent flying while vomiting blood.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming stepped forward and killed the evil god with one move.</p><p>Emperor formless and the other two had also forced the remaining two members of the evil god tribe into a precarious situation.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and killed his way back. The remaining two members of the evil god race were easily dealt with by them.</p><p>After packing up, the four of them continued forward. This time, it only took them a few minutes to pass through the passage.</p><p>After the passage, there were six corridors leading in different directions.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other three randomly chose one and rushed forward.</p><p>Not long after, they found some rooms, but these rooms were all empty. They had been moved.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest understood that they were late. Most likely, many people had already entered.</p><p>Following that, they came across a few more rooms, and they were all empty.</p><p>Immediately, they didn’t stay any longer and rushed forward at full speed.</p><p>“All!”</p><p>Suddenly, they heard a shrill cry.</p><p>The four people’s expressions changed. Someone had been killed.</p><p>The four of them quickly concealed their auras and continued forward.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In front of him, there was a fierce roar.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>There were also roars of anger.</p><p>Lu Ming and the group passed through a corridor and came to a wide hall. They discovered that a group of people was being besieged.</p><p>There were people from the evil god tribe and also people from the heaven realm. The two sides did not attack each other, as they had a common enemy.</p><p>In the hall, black light flickered continuously at an astonishing speed.</p><p>This was a type of bat. Its entire body was pitch-black, as if it was made of black iron. However, its eyes were completely red, like fresh blood.</p><p>The enemies of the evil god tribe and the living beings in the heaven realm were these bats.</p><p>In the hall, there were already some corpses of the evil god tribe and heaven realm beings lying on the ground. Furthermore, every single one of them was dried up, as if their blood had been devoured.</p><p>&Nbsp; buzz…</p><p>A strange fluctuation spread out, causing Lu Ming, Emperor formless, and the others ‘expressions to change.</p><p>“It’s a sound wave attack, be careful!”</p><p>Emperor formless warned.</p><p>The few of them hurriedly circulated their inner Qi to defend themselves against the invisible fluctuations.</p><p>The invisible fluctuations were extremely terrifying. Once hit, it would directly attack the soul and cause one to be dizzy.</p><p>Clearly, many people had been hit. After being attacked by these bats, their minds went dizzy. How could they still fight back? they were directly attacked by these bats and died on the spot.</p><p>&Nbsp; Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>There were dozens of black bats roaming around the hall. The living beings of the evil god race and heaven realm were all blocked here and were unable to advance. Even their own survival was in danger.</p><p>Opposite the hall, there was a door that seemed to lead straight through.</p><p>“Let’s charge over!”</p><p>Lu Ming said as he rushed forward with the three of them.</p><p>Immediately, a few black bats stared at them. Their blood-red eyes swept over them and they flew towards them.</p><p>&Nbsp; buzz…</p><p>The invisible fluctuation was rushing toward them.</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the laws. Eleven types of laws covered his entire body, especially his ears, which had the strongest defense.</p><p>But even so, Lu Ming felt that the power of the law still swayed but he blocked it.</p><p>However, Emperor formless and the other two weren’t as relaxed. Their bodies trembled slightly, and their faces paled.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>A few bats pounced toward Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly. He stepped forward and threw a few punches.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The void trembled violently. The invisible fluctuations were directly crushed by Lu Ming’s fist force. The terrifying fist force crushed over and the few bats ‘bodies exploded.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming took the lead and rushed forward.</p><p>Emperor formless and the others followed behind Lu Ming.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s cultivation and his powerful physical energy, his defense was amazing. Even the bat’s sound wave attack could not hurt him.</p><p>With Lu Ming as the leader, the four of them dashed forward like a pair of scissors. On the way, Lu Ming killed a few more bats.</p><p>that’s Lu Ming. He’s actually so powerful!</p><p>Someone recognized Lu Ming and was shocked.</p><p>“Lu Ming, give us a hand!”</p><p>Someone shouted and looked at Lu Ming in anticipation.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He could not be bothered with these people..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
