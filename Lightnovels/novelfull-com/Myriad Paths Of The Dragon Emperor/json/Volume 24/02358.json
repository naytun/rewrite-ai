Furthermore, between the heaven realm beings and the evil god race, only one side could leave. At that time, both sides would definitely have to kill each other. In that case, let them fight. For now, increasing their strength was the most important thing.</p><p>Without strength, if the heaven realm won, it would still be fine. However, if the evil god tribe won, they would definitely be killed. At that time, they could only be slaughtered.</p><p>As for Lu Ming’s physical body, it had just broken through not long ago. With the liquid fire, he had advanced to the peak of the early stage of the fifth level. It was impossible for him to break through again in a short period of time.</p><p>If he wanted to increase his strength now, the only way was to comprehend the laws!</p><p>Lu Ming was comprehending an ultimate Maxim. Every time he comprehended an ultimate Maxim and linked it with the other maxims, his combat strength would definitely improve.</p><p>The four of them sat in four different positions and began to cultivate.</p><p>Notionless Emperor, Sky Fire Emperor, and huntian Emperor each took out a fragment of the great Dao and started refining it.</p><p>It was not easy to refine a fragment of the great path. It would take a long time.</p><p>Lu Ming, on the other hand, was comprehending the laws in peace.</p><p>Now, his main goal was still the Samsara laws and primordial chaos laws.</p><p>He planned to cultivate these two laws to the third realm first before comprehending the other laws.</p><p>Cultivation knew no time. Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, half a year had passed.</p><p>Comprehending the laws here was very fast. Even without experiencing a life-and-death battle, Lu Ming had still broken through to the third realm in the primordial chaos laws. Furthermore, he had perfectly fused it with the original nine laws to form a divine power Technique.</p><p>The law of reincarnation had also reached the limit of the second realm.</p><p>However, Emperor formless and the other two were still refining the fragments of the great Dao.</p><p>They had each refined a fragment of the great path and were now refining the second one.</p><p>“Let’s go out and see what’s the situation outside!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>He didn’t know what the situation was like outside in the past six months. Had the eight array disks been found?</p><p>Lu Ming immediately left the cave and headed outside.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Not long after he left the cave, Lu Ming saw people fighting. It was the heaven realm creatures and the evil god tribe.</p><p>There were more than a dozen people. Both sides continued to kill each other, and the rumbles continued.</p><p>“Could it be that the eight array disks have been found?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Now that the eight formation disks had been found, the two sides would definitely have to fight.</p><p>After observing for a while, Lu Ming realized that this was not the case. Instead, both parties were fighting over a Palace.</p><p>Lu Ming squinted his eyes and cast the divine breath technique to completely conceal his aura. He was like a rock.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s body sank into the ground and he quietly headed toward the palace.</p><p>Lu Ming had successfully entered the palace without anyone noticing.</p><p>Unfortunately, there were no treasures in the palace. Lu Ming searched around but found nothing.</p><p>It seemed that the treasures they had obtained the last time were really something that could only be encountered by luck.</p><p>“Eh, that’s…”</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming’s expression changed. He had made a discovery in the last side room of the palace.</p><p>A ball of light floated in the air. In the ball of light, there was an array disc floating, emitting a dusky light.</p><p>“A formation plate!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. Could this be the array disc that the array spirit had mentioned?</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and the power of law condensed into a large hand. He grabbed the array disc in his hand.</p><p>The formation plate was extremely ancient and had been around for countless years. There were eight pits on it, and five of them were shining.</p><p>“Congratulations, you’ve obtained an array board!”</p><p>Suddenly, a voice rang out, and then, a youth appeared. It was precisely that formation spirit.</p><p>now, you’ve found five array disks. There are three more. Keep it up. I’ll remind you again that only one of you can leave. 1 look forward to your performance!</p><p>Finished talking, the formation Spirit’s figure directly disappeared.</p><p>there are five of them. In that case, the five shining pits on the array disc are the number of array discs that have been found!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Then, he put away the array disc and continued to conceal his aura as he left the hall.</p><p>Outside, the two parties were still fighting. Lu Ming had left quietly.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took a stroll outside and returned to the place where he had previously cultivated in seclusion. He did not find anything.</p><p>Now that he had an array disc in his hands, he felt much more at ease.</p><p>In any case, even if the other seven array discs were to appear, without the one in his hand, the others would not be able to leave. He could then cultivate in seclusion with peace of mind.</p><p>Lu Ming returned to his place of seclusion and continued to study the laws in seclusion.</p><p>Lu Ming did not try to comprehend the new laws. Instead, he focused on the law of reincarnation. At the same time, he kept trying to figure out the divine power Technique.</p><p>His divine power techniques were all self-created, so every time he comprehended a new divine power Technique, he had to sort it out and explore it again.</p><p>Only by constantly exploring could his sacred art become more exquisite and powerful.</p><p>Time flew by, and another half a year passed.</p><p>It had been more than two years since Lu Ming had entered the void Island. At this time, he had finally cultivated the reincarnation law to the third realm. Furthermore, it complemented the other laws very well and formed a New Sacred Art.</p><p>It was a divine power Technique formed by five ultimate laws and six King path laws.</p><p>The moment he attacked, the sacred art formed from the interweaving of 11 types of laws erupted with astonishing power.</p><p>There was no doubt that Lu Ming’s combat strength had increased again.</p><p>Now that he had unleashed his full power, he was confident that he could even fight a three star great emperor without fear.</p><p>What was worth mentioning was that after refining three fragments of the great Dao each, Emperor formless and the other two broke through to become two-star great emperors.</p><p>The three of them had been stuck at the one-star great emperor realm for a very long time, and they had finally broken through to the two-star great emperor realm.</p><p>In addition to Lu Ming’s combat strength, the strength of the four of them was considered to be not bad.</p><p>congratulations to the three Deans!</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Hahaha, luck, luck, but it’ll be difficult for us to break through to the three-star great emperor realm. Our talent is limited, and it won’t be easy even with the fragments of the great Dao!”</p><p>Emperor formless laughed in a carefree manner.</p><p>The bottleneck that had not been loosened for many years had been broken through in one day, so he was naturally in a good mood.</p><p>The three of them chatted for a while and decided to go out and take a look.</p><p>Seven formation disks had already appeared. As soon as the eighth appeared, the two sides would probably start fighting.</p><p>Moreover, now that Lu Ming and the other three’s abilities had improved greatly, they wanted to go out and try their luck to see if they could obtain some more opportunities.</p><p>The four of them left the place of seclusion and headed towards the depths of this region.</p><p>Not long after, they made a discovery.</p><p>This was because they realized that there were people continuously heading deeper into the area.</p><p>“The crowd is gathering. There must be a major discovery ahead!”</p><p>Emperor Wu Xiang said.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>The sky Fire Emperor was the most impatient..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
