They could not see through his real appearance.</p><p>Lu Ming did not plan to reveal his true form right from the start. If he did, the LAN family would definitely not let him get the one hundred stones of chaos.</p><p>He had to change his identity and get the chaos gem first.</p><p>The Heng Yu heavenly Emperor went first, followed by him and the few body cultivators.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming and the rest arrived at a square.</p><p>The square was hundreds of miles long and wide, but it was already filled with feasts.</p><p>Many people were casually sitting at the banquet.</p><p>“Guys, look over there! That’s The Prodigy area!”</p><p>On the side, people were chatting.</p><p>Lu Ming looked over and noticed that there was an area to the North of the square where many young talents were seated.</p><p>“Long Chen, Phoenix spirit, desolate power, and bubbles …”</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze and saw many familiar faces.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. Apart from bubbles, he had not seen the others for many years.</p><p>However, now was not the time to reminisce. It would not be too late to reminisce after this matter.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming also saw other people.</p><p>For example, the eternal Star River, Yuan Xin, Bao de, ao ke, Tian Ming…</p><p>Most of the top geniuses of the primordial realm had come.</p><p>The others were all from the heaven realm, such as those who had followed heavenly Emperor Kong Yin to the primordial realm during the battle of the ten lands.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming realized that there were countless banquets in the square and they were divided into many different areas.</p><p>The place they were sitting in was just an ordinary area.</p><p>Lu Ming did not mind and waited quietly.</p><p>“Look, it’s one of the nine absolutes, the Black Tortoise forest!”</p><p>“There’s also Fu Liu and Wang Yi…”</p><p>Suddenly, someone exclaimed.</p><p>Lu Ming looked up at the sky. A few figures were flying in the air, full of a high and mighty attitude.</p><p>They looked down at the crowd and landed in the area where the young geniuses were.</p><p>Lu Ming had seen a few of them before.</p><p>Black Tortoise forest, bald youth, Fu Liu …</p><p>They were all heaven’s favorites among the nine absolutes. Their talents were shocking and their future achievements were unimaginable.</p><p>it’s Lin Xiaofeng. Lin Xiaofeng really came!</p><p>Immediately after, there was an even greater uproar.</p><p>Almost everyone’s eyes were on a young man in the sky.</p><p>Lin Xiaofeng was ranked first among the nine uniques. In the past, he was the strongest heaven’s pride expert in the heaven realm. He stood at the peak of countless heaven’s pride experts and was invincible.</p><p>He was also someone Xuanyuan Yi had always wanted to defeat.</p><p>Lin Xiaofeng, dressed in black and carrying a long knife on his back, landed in the area of the younger generation with a cold face.</p><p>“Brother Lin!”</p><p>“Brother Lin!”</p><p>Many people went up to say hello to Lin Xiaofeng.</p><p>Lin Xiaofeng nodded slightly in response, then sat there and closed his eyes to rest.</p><p>Many people were excited. Lin Xiaofeng was here. This time, he would definitely have a duel with Xuanyuan Yi to determine the winner.</p><p>More than a decade ago, the two of them had a clash and had a battle of their best. In the end, Lin Xiaofeng won and defeated Xuanyuan Yi.</p><p>Xuanyuan Yi had always wanted to defeat Lin Xiaofeng and prove that he was the best in the world.</p><p>This time, the LAN family had mobilized so many people and had really taken out a hundred chaos gems to push Xuanyuan Yi to the peak. They were very confident.</p><p>Therefore, many people wanted to know who would win this time.</p><p>“The Yan clan’s Celestial Emperor has descended!”</p><p>“The heavenly Emperor of the Luo clan has descended!”</p><p>“The Lord of the vast expanse Hall has arrived!”</p><p>At this time, voices spread across the entire area.</p><p>Everyone fell silent.</p><p>The heavenly Emperor descended, and all living beings were silent.</p><p>In the sky, many figures stepped on the air and arrived.</p><p>From the East, the heavenly Emperor of the Yan clan was leading the experts of the Yan clan.</p><p>From the West, the heavenly Emperor of the Luo clan arrived with his experts.</p><p>These celestial emperors and the powerhouses who had come with them descended in the northernmost area.</p><p>That was the VIP area, and only those of high status could sit there.</p><p>These forces were all on good terms with the LAN family.</p><p>For example, the Yan family and the Luo family were all related to the LAN family by marriage.</p><p>After that, more and more powerful forces descended. Some of them even sent a heavenly Emperor.</p><p>During this period of time, the foreign tribes had retreated and did not attack again, which was why these heavenly emperors had the time to come here.</p><p>“Hahaha, thank you all for coming. I’m sorry I didn’t come out to welcome you!”</p><p>At this moment, a loud laugh was heard.</p><p>Then, a group of people flew over from the depths of Blue Moon City.</p><p>The leader of the group was the LAN family’s master, the heavenly Emperor powerhouse, Lan Cheng.</p><p>Behind Lan Cheng was a large number of LAN family experts.</p><p>Among them, LAN Yun was shockingly among them.</p><p>Beside Lan Cheng, there were two young men and women, who attracted the attention of many people.</p><p>They were the main characters of the day, LAN Xia and Xuanyuan Yi, two of the nine Jue.</p><p>brother LAN, congratulations! Congratulations to the LAN family for getting a son-in-law!</p><p>The Yan clan’s celestial Thearch and the others stood up to congratulate him.</p><p>“Many thanks! Everyone, please take a seat!”</p><p>Lan Cheng waved his hand.</p><p>today, LAN Xia, the LAN family’s prodigy, is married to Xuanyuan Yi. Everyone, please don’t stand on ceremony and enjoy your meal!</p><p>Lan Cheng said with a smile. Immediately after, countless people flew out and served wine and food on all the tables.</p><p>After that, it was time for the Grand wedding.</p><p>The crowd waited patiently. They all knew that the main event was only after the ceremony.</p><p>Not long after, the ceremony was over. Lan Cheng stood up, faced everyone, and said, this time, I would like to thank everyone for coming, especially the young geniuses. Since most of them are here, why don’t we take this opportunity to spar and let us old guys see the glory of the young generation?” “That’s good!”</p><p>after the battle more than ten years ago, the geniuses rarely fought with each other. They were all cultivating. Today is a good time to see the results of their cultivation!</p><p>today is the golden age, and the prodigies have gathered. Now, there are even more prodigies from the primordial realm. The stars are truly dazzling!</p><p>Many people nodded and revealed looks of anticipation.</p><p>The young heaven’s favorites were also sizing each other up. Faint battle intent was spreading out.</p><p>For example, Xuanyuan Yi’s gaze fell on Lin Xiaofeng, and he did not hide his strong fighting spirit.</p><p>In his eyes, only Lin Xiaofeng was worth his time.</p><p>this time, the LAN family will also take out some prizes as a reward. The first place winner will be rewarded with 100 chaos gems!</p><p>“No matter who lives first, my LAN family will not go back on our word!”</p><p>Lan Cheng continued, and his voice echoed throughout the entire area.</p><p>Lin Xiaofeng’s eyes lit up.</p><p>He had come for the 100 chaos gems. Who wouldn’t be tempted by 100 chaos gems?</p><p>However, the other elites sighed. They understood that they were not fated to get the 100 stones of chaos. With Lin Xiaofeng and Xuanyuan Yi around, they would not be able to get first.</p><p>Most of the paragons were not here for the 100 chaos gems. They were only here to spar with the other paragons..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
