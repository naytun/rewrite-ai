It’s Lu Ming!</p><p>it’s too shocking. How many years has it been since Lu Ming became a Martial Emperor? he’s actually able to suppress Xuanyuan Yi and is invincible in his generation. It’s simply unbelievable!</p><p>he only used his physical strength just now. He didn’t use the power of laws!</p><p>“Indeed, hiss!”</p><p>The surroundings were in a clamor, and the sounds of discussion converged.</p><p>The main thing was that Lu Ming’s reputation was too great. Back then, he had become a great emperor with many laws. This was unprecedented. As soon as he became a great emperor, he defeated one of the nine absolutes, the Black Tortoise forest, and shook the entire heaven realm.</p><p>A few years later, he defeated and captured a Prince of the alien race outside two world city. That battle pushed Lu Ming’s reputation to the peak.</p><p>However, it was nothing compared to today’s battle. In today’s battle, Lu Ming had defeated Xuanyuan Yi and ascended to the throne of number one among the younger generation of the Tian Yuan world and the yuan world.</p><p>It seemed that every time Lu Ming appeared, his combat strength would increase by leaps and bounds at a shocking speed.</p><p>“Fa… Father!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu shenhuang stood up and stared at Lu Ming without blinking. His face was filled with surprise, surprise, anticipation, curiosity, and other emotions.</p><p>Lu Ming also heard Lu shenhuang’s voice. He turned to look at Lu shenhuang and their eyes met.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded slightly and smiled.</p><p>Lu shenhuang took in a deep breath and suppressed his excitement. He stepped forward onto the fighting ring and faced Lu Ming.</p><p>His mother’s comments about his father rang in his mind.</p><p>Unparalleled and unparalleled in the world …</p><p>Seeing it today, it was indeed so!</p><p>“Father…”</p><p>Lu shenhuang spoke again.</p><p>“Your mother is Xie nianqing?”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but ask.</p><p>Even though he already knew that Lu shenhuang’s mother was definitely Xie nianqing, he still could not help but ask to confirm.</p><p>“Yes, I am!”</p><p>Lu shenhuang nodded his head firmly.</p><p>A smile appeared on Lu Ming’s face. Looking at Lu shenhuang, who looked 70 – 80% similar to him, he had an inexplicable feeling in his heart.</p><p>She didn’t expect to have a son after a short separation with Xie nianqing.</p><p>divine wilderness, retreat to the side. After I settle the matter here, I will go with you to find your mother!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Mm, okay!”</p><p>Lu shenhuang nodded and retreated to his seat.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and faced Lan Cheng.</p><p>At this moment, Lan Cheng’s face revealed a ferocious expression, and his eyes were filled with killing intent.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you still dare to appear here? Good, very good!”</p><p>Lan Cheng said coldly.</p><p>“Why can’t I be here?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked with a cold smile.</p><p>a few years ago, on the battlefield outside the two world city, you killed the beings of the heaven realm and seized their treasures and resources. This is a serious crime, and you have to pay with your life!</p><p>Lan Cheng coldly said.</p><p>hahahaha, what a good ‘thief crying thief caught thief’. In that case, I’ll explain everything today!</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily. Then, he recounted how the LAN family and the Yan family had besieged him and how Bai tai and the rest had arrived, but the LAN family and the Yan family had killed them to keep their mouths shut.</p><p>“There’s actually such a thing!”</p><p>Many people’s gazes flickered, and they revealed thoughtful expressions.</p><p>Back then, the LAN family had announced to the public that Lu Ming had killed people and robbed them of their treasures. The LAN family and the Yan family had come across them and attacked Lu Ming according to the rules of two world city.</p><p>Could it be that there was such a secret?</p><p>“Simply a bunch of nonsense!” Lan Cheng berated.</p><p>“Nonsense? I suspect that the people of the LAN family were ordered by you, Lan Cheng, to seize my indestructible ancient scroll. In the end, when they were discovered, you killed them and framed me. Such an act is not worthy of being called a big family in the heaven realm. In my opinion, the one who should be punished is you, the LAN family!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>“Impudent! How dare you slander me! Today, no matter how glib your tongue is, you’ll be punished. Men, take Lu Ming down, cripple his cultivation, and put him in jail!”</p><p>Lan Cheng shouted.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Immediately, two experts from the LAN family stepped out. They exuded a powerful aura and rushed towards Lu Ming.</p><p>These were two great emperors, and they were extremely powerful.</p><p>“Let’s see who dares to?”</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu shouted coldly as a terrifying aura erupted from his body. With a wave of his hand, a huge hand formed and pressed down on the two LAN clan heavenly emperors.</p><p>“Hengyu, I’m afraid that it’s not up to you to protect Lu Ming!”</p><p>Lan Cheng roared and rushed out. His heavenly Emperor realm cultivation base also burst out. He pressed his big hand and a heavenly Lion roared and pounced toward the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor’s big hand.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A deafening explosion was heard, and Lan Cheng’s expression changed drastically. His body was sent flying, and he looked at the eternal universe heavenly Emperor in shock.</p><p>He was no match for heavenly Emperor Heng Yu, and he was forced to retreat with a single strike.</p><p>At the same time, the two great emperors of the LAN clan were also sent flying by the residual force of the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor’s attack.</p><p>“Hengyu, do you think you can break the rules of the heaven realm by yourself? Did he want to fight against everyone? Lu Ming has committed a crime and must be punished!”</p><p>Lan Cheng roared.</p><p>the ones who are guilty are the LAN family. The ones who are going against the heaven realm are the LAN family!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>“What a load of nonsense!”</p><p>Lan Cheng said.</p><p>“Hehe, if what I said is a bunch of nonsense, then what you said, isn’t it all bullshit?”</p><p>Lu Ming berated coldly.</p><p>“How audacious!”</p><p>Lan Cheng bellowed. Lu Ming was a junior, yet he dared to go against him and talk back to him at every turn. How presumptuous! He was so furious that he wished he could kill Lu Ming with a slap.</p><p>“Fellow Daoists, give me a hand!”</p><p>Lan Cheng’s gaze turned to the Yan family’s heavenly Emperor, the Luo family’s heavenly Emperor, and the vast expanse shrine master.</p><p>These forces were all on good terms with the LAN family, and even had marriage relations with the LAN family.</p><p>Lu Ming killed his fellow Daoists in the heaven realm and seized their treasures. In my opinion, he could rise so quickly because of this method. He is guilty of a great crime and should be punished!</p><p>The Yan clan’s heavenly Emperor stepped out and stood side by side with Lan Cheng. Their powerful auras burst forth as they fought against the eternal universe heavenly Emperor together.</p><p>“That’s right. We must capture Lu Ming today, cripple his cultivation, and interrogate him strictly!”</p><p>The heavenly Emperor of the Luo clan also stepped out.</p><p>Then, two more people stepped out. They were both at the heavenly Emperor realm. One of them was the Lord of the vast expanse Palace and the other was the master of the Xing Xing River. They were both terrifying heavenly Emperor powerhouses.</p><p>The five heavenly Emperor powerhouses stood together, and their aura was shocking.</p><p>“Hengyu, I’ve said it before. You can’t stop US alone today. We must take Lu Ming down!”</p><p>Lan Cheng sneered and glared at Lu Ming. He stretched out his hand and the terrifying power condensed into a huge hand that grabbed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“You dare?”</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu roared..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
