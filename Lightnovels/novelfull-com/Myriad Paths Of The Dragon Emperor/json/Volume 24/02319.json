If he didn’t even dare to accept the challenge, he wouldn’t be able to survive in the future and would be laughed at by others.</p><p>“Since you want to fight, i’ll fulfill your wish!”</p><p>let’s go! LAN Yun said coldly as he stepped out and landed on the fighting ring.</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fist. He was worried for the teenager. He was ready to take out the fallen star bow at any time. If the teenager was in danger, he would help.</p><p>Bubbles and the others were also staring at the scene, especially bubbles. He would not let anything happen to the young man.</p><p>you’re so arrogant at such a young age. I’d like to see what you’re capable of!</p><p>LAN Yun said coldly. The youth was only fifteen or sixteen years old, and he did not believe that the other party could match him.</p><p>He was also a top-notch heaven’s favorite. He had only achieved this after decades of bitter cultivation.</p><p>He had never heard of a fifteen or sixteen-year-old who could have such achievements. There had never been one in history.</p><p>“Make your move. Once you make your move, you’ll naturally be able to see my ability!”</p><p>The youth said indifferently, his expression calm and indifferent, as if he didn’t care about LAN Yun at all.</p><p>The anger in LAN Yun’s heart grew heavier and heavier.</p><p>“Since you’re looking for death, I’ll fulfill your wish. Kill!”</p><p>you’re courting death! LAN Yun roared in anger, and light burst out from his body. Then, the endless light converged into a giant lion that pounced toward the youth.</p><p>The lion was as large as a mountain, and its aura was astonishing.</p><p>LAN Yun used his ultimate move the moment he made his move. If he was hit, the youth would die without a doubt.</p><p>Since the teenager said that he was Lu Ming’s son, he would send him on his way!</p><p>LAN Yun’s eyes flashed with a malevolent expression.</p><p>Seeing that the giant lion was about to pounce on the young man, the young man made his move.</p><p>A layer of black light emanated from his body, and then a black sword light burst out and slashed at the giant lion.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The giant lion formed by the blue cloud sacred art seemed to be made of tofu. It couldn’t withstand a single blow and was directly destroyed by the black light that the young man shot out.</p><p>Furthermore, the black light did not stop and continued to charge towards LAN Yun.</p><p>The black light’s speed was astonishingly fast, and LAN Yun had no way to avoid it.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>die! LAN Yun bellowed in rage and continuously punched out with his fists. One giant lion after another pounced out, but they were all swept away by the black light and fell apart.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The black light struck LAN Yun, causing him to scream in pain. His body retreated frantically, but it was useless. His body was directly cut in two by the black light, and he fell to the ground, wailing in pain.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss…</p><p>Many people gasped and looked at the young man in shock.</p><p>One move, with just one move, the young man had cut LAN Yun into two.</p><p>This was too shocking.</p><p>One should know that LAN Yun was a top notch heaven’s favorite who had mastered an ultimate law. His current cultivation had even reached the level of a five-star void Emperor.</p><p>It was too shocking that he couldn’t even withstand a single move from the young man.</p><p>Some of the older generation saw even more.</p><p>what kind of power is that? it’s so terrifying! This young man’s cultivation base is at the three-star void Emperor realm, but the power he cultivates is so powerful that it’s terrifying!</p><p>that’s right. It’s similar to the power of the ancient cultivation system, but it’s more condensed, sharper, and more terrifying!</p><p>Some of the older generation were discussing.</p><p>It was already extremely shocking for a youth to have reached the three-star void Emperor realm at his age.</p><p>However, the power that the young man cultivated was even stranger.</p><p>The youth’s attack did not have any nomological fluctuations. Clearly, the youth did not cultivate in the nomological system.</p><p>However, it was not because of the ancient cultivation system, as the youth’s power was even more terrifying than the power cultivated by the ancient cultivation system.</p><p>Some of the older generation discussed in surprise.</p><p>nest, that’s amazing. You’re too awesome. As expected of Lu Ming’s son!</p><p>he defeated LAN Yun in one move. He’s really amazing!</p><p>The unscrupulous monk, Long Chen, and the others were also discussing in shock.</p><p>“This power…”</p><p>Only Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>He had seen this power once before.</p><p>Back then, after he had sex with Xie nianqing, the next day, Xie nianqing seemed to have changed into a different person and attacked him.</p><p>This was the power that Xie nianqing was using.</p><p>It was indestructible, and its attack power was extremely powerful. It could even penetrate laws.</p><p>“He’s really my son!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming concluded. He felt inexplicably excited.</p><p>The sudden appearance of a son made it difficult for anyone to remain calm. Lu Ming could not wait to rush out and acknowledge the young man so that he could find out Xie nianqing’s whereabouts.</p><p>Since the young man was here, Xie nianqing must be in the Tai Qing heavenly region.</p><p>He had to get to the bottom of this matter.</p><p>However, there was no rush. It would not be too late to talk about it after the matter with the LAN family was resolved.</p><p>At this moment, there were already experts from the LAN family who had saved LAN Yun. With LAN Yun’s cultivation, being cut in two was a small matter and could be easily healed.</p><p>The biggest blow to him was that he was defeated by the youth in one move.</p><p>“Impossible, impossible!”</p><p>LAN Yun kept roaring in his heart, finding it hard to accept.</p><p>He had actually been defeated by a fifteen or sixteen-year-old youth in one move. This was a great humiliation.</p><p>“Can’t even withstand a single blow!”</p><p>The young man shook his head and turned to look at the Black Tortoise forest.</p><p>“Now, we can fight!”</p><p>The young man said.</p><p>Xuanwu Lin’s eyes narrowed slightly. He took a step forward and stepped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Stars spread out from Xuanwu Lin’s body. There were a total of 360 stars that covered his entire body.</p><p>The Black Tortoise forest didn’t dare to be careless when facing the young man.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A pitch-black sword appeared in the young man’s hand.</p><p>“Remember, the one who defeated you is Lu shenhuang!”</p><p>The young man’s voice rang out, and the sword light whizzed out, piercing through the void and slashing toward the Black Tortoise forest at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>“Divine desolate Lu!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled slightly.</p><p>Was this the name Xie nianqing had given the young man?</p><p>The divine wilderness referred to the divine wilderness continent. It also meant that it was the place where Lu Ming and Xie nianqing met and fell in love. They had experienced unforgettable years in the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>“Heavenly cycle stellar fist!”</p><p>Xuanwu Lin shouted and waved his hands. One star after another flew towards Lu shenhuang.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu shenhuang’s sword trembled and sword Qi howled. Streaks of black sword radiance slashed towards the stars.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The stars exploded like fireworks.</p><p>Xuanwu Lin’s expression changed, and he burst forth with all his might. More stars were blasted toward Xuanwu Lin.</p><p>Every star contained the power of his laws. However, Lu shenhuang’s sword radiance was shockingly powerful and could easily tear apart his laws.</p><p>The two of them quickly attacked. The sky was filled with sword light and Starlight. In the blink of an eye, the two of them had exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>what a terrifying strength! He’s a genius, a genius!</p><p>Some of the older generation sighed. Of course, it was because of Lu shenhuang’s combat strength.</p><p>His cultivation base was only at the three-star illusionary divine stage, but he was able to compete with the Black Tortoise forest. This kind of combat strength was not only shocking, but also unimaginable.</p><p>Everyone present was stunned and shocked beyond words..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
