If they were to fight later and not get anything, wouldn’t it be a loss?</p><p>perhaps this statue has a secret!</p><p>After a while, someone spoke up and stared at the statue again.</p><p>There was nothing here other than the statue. If there was a chance, it could only land on the statue.</p><p>“I’ll break him!”</p><p>A cold voice rang out as an extremely burly member of the evil god race stepped out. In his hand was a battle axe that was as black as ink, but it exuded a terrifying sharpness.</p><p>Heaven Dao soldiers!</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>10,000 DAOs returning to one. Be it the nomological system, the ancient cultivation system, or the evil god race, all of them would come into contact with the heavenly Dao at the end of their cultivation.</p><p>In other words, after reaching the heavenly Emperor realm, the various systems were actually very similar. The heaven Dao soldiers contained the heaven Dao and were the Supreme divine weapons shared by all systems.</p><p>The Supreme weapon used by the evil god race was also the heaven Dao soldier!</p><p>“Help me!”</p><p>The muscular evil god race member looked at rhe other members of the evil god race.</p><p>Instantly, five to six members of the evil god race walked out. They were all peak great emperors.</p><p>A total of seven peak great emperor experts from the evil god race were controlling the battle-ax at the same time.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The battle-axe trembled violently, revealing its sharp edge. The aura of the heavenly Dao emanated from it, causing everyone to feel a huge pressure.</p><p>But at this moment, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>The battleaxe, which had been growing rapidly, seemed to be frightened by something and began to shrink again. Finally, it became the size of an ordinary battleaxe and fell to the ground. There was no tyrannical aura at all. It was like an ordinary axe.</p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded!</p><p>the pressure here is too strong. The Qi of the heavenly Dao from the heaven Dao soldiers is being suppressed by the pressure here!</p><p>Some people speculated.</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>It was very likely that this was the case.</p><p>The pressure on the void God Island was Supreme and transcended the heavenly Dao. It could suppress the heavenly Dao and prevent heavenly Emperor realm existences from entering.</p><p>And here, the pressure was extremely strong. It was normal for it to be able to suppress the heaven Dao soldiers.</p><p>The expressions of the experts who had borrowed the heaven Dao soldiers turned unsightly.</p><p>They had originally wanted to use the heaven Dao soldiers to suppress everyone and take the top spot, but now, they couldn’t use the heaven Dao soldiers at all and could only rely on their own strength.</p><p>The eyes of those who didn’t have heaven Dao soldiers lit up.</p><p>For Lu Ming and the rest, without the heaven Dao soldiers, they had nothing to fear.</p><p>‘Hmphj I won’t use rhe heaven Dao soldiers, I’ll still chop you up!11</p><p>die! one of the evil god race members hollered in anger as he brandished a huge metal rod and charged up, smashing toward the statue.</p><p>The metal cudgel grew rapidly, becoming tens of thousands of meters long. It was extremely shocking, shattering the void and smashing towards the statue.</p><p>The evil god race member who attacked was a peak Emperor.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The huge metal rod smashed onto the statue’s head. The metal rod shook violently, but the statue was completely fine. Not even a trace was left behind.</p><p>“It’s so hard…”</p><p>Many people were shocked. A peak great Emperor’s full-power attack had the power to destroy the heavens and earth, but this statue was completely fine.</p><p>“Look, the statue is reacting…”</p><p>Suddenly, someone shouted.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes lit up. The statue had indeed reacted.</p><p>Previously, this statue seemed to be carved out of an ordinary Boulder. The material seemed to be very ordinary.</p><p>But now, a layer of milky white light appeared on the statue. It was Holy and pure.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>All of a sudden, the milky-white light transformed into a sword light that pierced through the sky. Its target was the evil god tribe member who had just attacked the statue.</p><p>The evil god race member was shocked. However, being suppressed by the terrifying pressure here, his speed had become extremely slow. There was no way for him to Dodge at all, and he could only take it head-on.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>He swung the iron rod in his hand again.</p><p>The iron rod pierced through the void and headed toward the milky-white sword light.</p><p>However, the result was unexpected.</p><p>The sword light flashed past, and with a PU sound, the metal rod was directly sliced apart. The sword light did not stop and continued on toward the evil god race with an unbelievable speed.</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere as the evil god tribe member’s glabella was pierced through by the sword light.</p><p>His eyes were wide open and filled with disbelief, but he was no longer breathing.</p><p>His soul was destroyed!</p><p>A single strike had destroyed the evil god tribe’s soul.</p><p>Many people gasped.</p><p>This was a peak great emperor, but he was killed just like that without any power to resist.</p><p>“Nor good!”</p><p>Many people were shocked and retreated frantically, afraid that they would end up the same way.</p><p>However, after killing the evil god tribe member with the sword light, it dissipated on its own, and the milky-white light on the statue disappeared without a trace.</p><p>It was as if the light had appeared to kill the evil god tribe.</p><p>He couldn’t be humiliated!</p><p>This statue was a statue of a Supreme existence that could not be humiliated!</p><p>The evil god race members who had wanted to use their heaven Dao soldiers to attack the statue were all drenched in cold sweat.</p><p>Buzzzzzzl</p><p>Right at this moment, the statue emitted a slight vibration, causing everyone’s hearts to suddenly shake and be on tenterhooks.</p><p>Then, everyone saw the eyes of the statue change.</p><p>At this moment, the eyes of the statue were no longer made of stone. Instead, they had turned into two vortexes.</p><p>His left eye was milky white.</p><p>His right eye was pitch-black.</p><p>In the next moment, light extended from each of the eyes and turned into two paths.</p><p>Two paths, one to his left eye and the other to his right eye!</p><p>Why did the eyes of the statue suddenly turn into two paths?</p><p>Could it be that there was something else in the eyes of the statue? The treasure is inside?</p><p>Many people starred to think.</p><p>“The left is the path of life, the right is the path of death. Life can be death, death can be life, choose one between life and death!”</p><p>Suddenly, a voice rang out from within the statue.</p><p>Everyone was shocked. It seemed that this statue was not as simple as it seemed. It seemed to know that they were coming.</p><p>“Two paths, one to live, one to die!”</p><p>Everyone’s eyes flickered as they examined the two paths.</p><p>It was very likely that there was an opportunity inside. This was an opportunity left behind by someone who surpassed the heavenly Emperor. How precious would it be?</p><p>For such a Supreme Being to be able to craft heaven Dao soldiers, even if they left behind some trash’, it would probably be an unimaginable treasure to them.</p><p>Many people’s eyes were filled with greed.</p><p>However, for the time being, no one made a move, because no one knew if there would be any danger on the two paths.</p><p>On the path of life and death, life could be death, and death could be life. No one could figure it out, so they all wanted others to go first.</p><p>The crowd fell silent and looked at each other.</p><p>Finally, someone couldn’t take it anymore. He gritted his teeth and stepped forward.</p><p>This was a God beast from the heaven realm, and he headed toward the path of survival with his left eye.</p><p>The result was unexpectedly smooth.</p><p>He stepped onto the path and nothing unusual happened. When he reached the statue’s left eye, he took a step and entered the milky white vortex, disappearing..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
