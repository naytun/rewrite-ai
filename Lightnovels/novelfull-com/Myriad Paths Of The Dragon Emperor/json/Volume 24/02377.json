BOOM!</p><p>Just as the turtle shell rose, the attacks from all directions arrived.</p><p>Each attack was from a peak Emperor, but they were all blocked by the turtle shell. None of the attacks could break through the turtle shell.</p><p>hahaha, you want to break the formation I set up? although it’s only for a short time, it’s still possible to set up a formation that can protect you all!</p><p>Dandan laughed out loud, extremely proud.</p><p>“Dammit, watch me break your turtle shell!”</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The rest of the peak emperors shouted and used their ultimate moves to attack dandan and Lu Ming.</p><p>However, there were so many turtle shells that they blocked all the gaps. When all the attacks landed on the turtle shells, they only trembled but couldn’t be broken.</p><p>“Everyone, attack one point!”</p><p>Someone shouted, wanting to concentrate everyone’s attack on one point and break the turtle shell.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Everyone’s attacks were focused on the turtle shell.</p><p>Sure enough, this move was effective. The turtle shell shook violently, and then cracks appeared on it.</p><p>Those people were overjoyed, but their faces were very calm, and even had a faint mocking look.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The turtle shell was shattered, but in the next moment, a new turtle shell was formed.</p><p>Those people were stunned for a moment, and then their anger soared to the sky, and they launched an attack again.</p><p>But it was no use. Every time they broke a turtle shell, a new one would float out.</p><p>Dandan revealed a faint smile and a leisurely expression, which almost made those people vomit blood.</p><p>After attacking for a while, there was no effect at all, and those people had to stop.</p><p>“What’s the point of hiding in the turtle shell? we’ll just wait here. He’ll come out sooner or later, and once he does, we’ll tear them to pieces!”</p><p>The Royal member of the evil god tribe said coldly.</p><p>The others also revealed cold gazes.</p><p>“Have you all forgotten what 1 said before?”</p><p>At this moment, the formation spirit in the air spoke, its clear voice ringing in everyone’s ears, I’ve already given you the items. After you get them, I’ll send you out. You have half an hour more. After that, I’ll send all of you out at the same time!</p><p>“Half an hour, damn it!”</p><p>The rest of the People’s expressions changed drastically. Then, they launched their attacks one after another, attacking dandan and Lu Ming.</p><p>They had to break through dandan’s formation within half an hour.</p><p>However, everything was in vain. It was completely useless.</p><p>There were even people who bombarded the void, smashing it into pieces, trying to destroy the formation base of the formation.</p><p>However, this kind of formation that imprinted runes in the void couldn’t be broken at all. Unless the power was extremely strong and annihilated all the particles in the void, it was impossible to break through the void.</p><p>Time passed quickly, and half an hour was up.</p><p>alright, Time’s Up. You can all leave!</p><p>At this moment, the formation spirit spoke. After she finished speaking, her body emitted a dazzling radiance.</p><p>An incomparably powerful force was applied to Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Their bodies were repelled by an extremely powerful force, and they flew out of the statue in an instant. Then, they flew out of the island.</p><p>At this moment, an extremely terrifying and supreme power erupted from the statue and spread in all directions.</p><p>Everyone on void God Island was pushed by this force and was sent flying out of the island.</p><p>However, the strange thing was that the demonic beasts and mutated beasts that had originally lived on the island were completely fine.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was in the air. He could not control his body at all. It was as if he was being pushed by a huge wave in the sea and was flying backward rapidly.</p><p>At the same time, he saw many other figures being pushed in all directions from the other corners of the island.</p><p>The scene was extremely spectacular.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming and the rest were pushed to the edge of the void God Island. They stood in the void, and at this time, the force disappeared.</p><p>At the edge of the island stood many figures. There were beings from the evil god race and the heaven realm.</p><p>Other than Lu Ming and a few people, most of the people looked at each other, not knowing what had happened.</p><p>Ah~!</p><p>Suddenly, a scream was heard. Someone had made a move.</p><p>One of the evil god race members suddenly attacked and tore apart a heaven realm expert.</p><p>That was because, at the edge of the island, the living beings of the evil god race and heaven realm were all mixed together. After being stunned for a moment, someone finally reacted and made a move.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Immediately, someone from the heaven realm retaliated. At the edge of the void God Island, a chaotic battle immediately broke out.</p><p>Two two-star and three-star great emperors attacked Lu Ming and were killed by him with one punch.</p><p>“Dandan, let’s go first!”</p><p>Lu Ming rushed toward dandan because dandan happened to appear not far from him.</p><p>Soon, the two of them met up and rushed out into the void, trying to meet up with heavenly Emperor Heng Yu.</p><p>“Stay here!”</p><p>With a loud roar, one of the evil god race members charged toward Lu Ming and the other man with a burning gaze.</p><p>This evil god race member was a peak Emperor.</p><p>There were almost twenty peak great emperors left in the statue, but they were scattered by the force.</p><p>There was only one peak great emperor here.</p><p>“You want to keep me here alone? die!”</p><p>A ferocious look flashed in dandan’s eyes as she charged toward this peak great emperor from the evil god race.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he had already put away the celestial Emperor’s body. Without it, he was no match for a peak great emperor, so he did not make a move.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Dandan’s battle-power was extremely strong, and after a few moves, she made the peak Emperor spit out blood.</p><p>The other party was shocked and retreated, not daring to fight Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming and dandan met up and rushed outside.</p><p>“Let’s go. Now is not the time for the final battle!”</p><p>On the side of the heaven realm, someone shouted and then flew out one by one.</p><p>The people from the evil god race didn’t dare to chase after them, because the heaven realm’s people were flying in the direction that the heaven realm’s celestial Thearch was receiving. If they chased after them, they would only be met with death.</p><p>the evil god race members turned around and flew in another direction.</p><p>Slowly, the battle at the edge of the void God Island came to a stop. Everyone chose the right direction and left the void God Island.</p><p>Lu Ming and dandan flew at top speed. The void God Island was getting further and further away from them, and it was getting smaller.</p><p>Finally, they saw the figures in front of them. It was the heavenly Emperor from the heavenly realm, and there were more than a dozen of them.</p><p>Lu Ming saw the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor among them.</p><p>These heavenly emperors were all looking at the void God Island anxiously. Clearly, they had also sensed the change on the island.</p><p>The Hengyu heavenly Emperor’s eyes lit up when he saw Lu Ming, and he flew over.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what happened on the void God Island?”</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu asked.</p><p>The other celestial emperors also turned to look at him curiously..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
