Lu Ming came from the primordial realm, and he had a deep relationship with Lu Ming. He was happier to see Lu Ming’s achievements than to see him break through.</p><p>“Lu Ming, given your current combat strength, I’m afraid that the training in two world city won’t be very effective!”</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu said.</p><p>I’m planning to cultivate for a while and raise my cultivation to the peak of true Emperor. Then, I’ll go to the battlefield of emperors to gain some experience!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“The battlefield of emperors? If we go now, I’m afraid it won’t have much effect!”</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu said.</p><p>“No effect?” Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>In the battlefield of great emperors, weren’t there many great emperors from both sides fighting and tempering themselves?</p><p>now, there’s no one left in the battlefield of great emperors. The great emperors from both sides have gone to the void God Island!</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu said.</p><p>“Void God Island?” Lu Ming was puzzled. This was the first time he heard this name.</p><p>that’s right. The void God Island is a mysterious place that was discovered a few years ago. It’s located in the eternal void and contains countless treasures. Now, many great sovereign realm figures have entered the void God Island!</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu explained.</p><p>“Even outsiders can enter?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>that’s right. That Island is located in the void and is eternally suspended. Both parties can reach it. It contains countless treasures, all kinds of heavenly materials and earthly treasures, chaos stones, primordial chaos stones, Supreme-grade rough stones, great Dao fragments, heavenly Dao marks, and even heavenly Dao soldiers!</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu’s eyes lit up with a fiery light as he spoke.</p><p>“We even have heaven Dao soldiers!”</p><p>Lu Ming was also shocked.</p><p>Heaven Dao soldiers were Celestial Emperor weapons, and they contained heaven Dao.</p><p>Once a figure in the heavenly Emperor realm controlled a heavenly Emperor weapon and activated the power of the heavenly Dao inside, the combat strength of a heavenly Emperor would be greatly enhanced.</p><p>However, Celestial Emperor weapons were extremely rare.</p><p>Celestial Emperor weapons weren’t like great sovereign weapons. Heavenly sovereigns could forge great sovereign weapons, and even some powerful great sovereigns could.</p><p>However, the celestial Thearch himself was unable to create the heaven Dao soldiers.</p><p>The celestial Thearch could only borrow the power of the heavenly Dao. It was impossible for him to forge a weapon that contained the heavenly Dao.</p><p>Celestial Emperor weapons could only be forged by Supreme powerhouses who had surpassed the celestial Emperor realm.</p><p>In addition, some Celestial Emperor weapons that contained the heavenly Dao could also be nurtured in nature, but the number was extremely small.</p><p>In fact, most of the celestial emperors still used Emperor-level weapons.</p><p>Once a Celestial Emperor controlled a Celestial Emperor weapon, his combat strength would skyrocket.</p><p>As such, the price of a Celestial Emperor weapon was astonishingly high.</p><p>Lu Ming did not expect that the void Island actually contained a celestial Thearch weapon.</p><p>that’s right, and there’s definitely a lot of them. In the past few years, some people have already brought out Celestial Emperor weapons, which caused a sensation!</p><p>The fire in heavenly Emperor Heng Yu’s eyes became even more intense.</p><p>He didn’t have a celestial Thearch weapon.</p><p>For example, the celestial Thearch’s sword in Lu Ming’s hand was not a celestial Thearch weapon. It was only a great emperor weapon and did not contain the heavenly Dao.</p><p>wouldn’t even the celestial emperors be envious of such a treasure land? what’s the point of a great emperor entering? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>the void God Island contains a shocking pressure that can suppress the heavenly Dao. Heavenly emperors can’t enter at all. Only those below the heavenly Emperor level can enter. Therefore, it’s the most suitable for a great sovereign to enter!</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu said.</p><p>“What? It can even suppress the heavenly Dao. This …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes widened in shock.</p><p>In this world, what was the highest? It was the heavenly Dao!</p><p>The heavenly Dao controlled all things in the world, and all things in the world existed and evolved under the operation of the heavenly Dao.</p><p>The celestial Thearch was at the peak of martial arts, but he could only borrow the power of the heavenly Dao. Now that Lu Ming heard that there was a pressure that could suppress the heavenly Dao, he was naturally shocked.</p><p>Could he be at the level of the ancestral Dragon?</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he thought of the ancestor Dragon!</p><p>Dandan had once said that the ancestral Dragon’s Realm had surpassed the celestial Emperor’s and reached a completely different realm, a Supreme realm.</p><p>many people speculated that the void God Island was a ritual ground of a Supreme figure in the distant past, floating in the eternal void. That figure had already transcended the heavenly path, and even the heavenly path was suppressed by him. That’s why he had such a terrifying might!</p><p>this also explains why there are so many celestial Thearch weapons on the island. A person like that can definitely forge a celestial Thearch weapon!</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu explained.</p><p>Lu Ming was deeply shocked. It was hard to imagine what kind of treasures would appear in such a place.</p><p>I’m here to ask you if you’d like to go to the void God Island. However, it’s very dangerous. There are already some dangerous places on the island, and with the great emperors of the alien races and the heaven realm, it’s very dangerous. If you don’t want to go, you can just cultivate in two world city!</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu said.</p><p>“I’ll go, I’ll go!”</p><p>Lu Ming immediately nodded, his eyes determined.</p><p>Lu Ming would definitely not miss such a treasure trove.</p><p>There were all sorts of heavenly materials and earthly treasures on it, such as chaos stones, primordial chaos stones, great Dao fragments, and so on. These would definitely be of help to Lu Ming’s cultivation.</p><p>Moreover, training on it and fighting in life-and-death situations would be even more beneficial to Lu Ming.</p><p>If he wanted to catch up to or even surpass Xie nianqing, he couldn’t cultivate normally. He had to take risks.</p><p>alright, 1’11 make the arrangements for you. However, you have to remember one thing. On the void God Island, there are times when danger will come from the people of the heaven realm. There are no restrictions when it comes to snatching treasures there, and people on your side will also attack people on your side!</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He had experienced so much. He was naturally clear about this.</p><p>during this period of time, try your best to increase your strength. I will inform you after I have made the arrangements!</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu left after he finished speaking.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he returned to his residence and thought about the direction of his cultivation.</p><p>Next, Lu Ming planned to raise his cultivation level to seven-star true Emperor.</p><p>This was the fastest way to increase his combat strength.</p><p>Once his cultivation reached seven-star true Emperor, he could try to break through to great emperor realm.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not plan to break through to the great emperor realm so soon.</p><p>Once he broke through to the great emperor realm, his great Dao would be fixed. It would be difficult to integrate more laws!</p><p>Lu Ming was ambitious. He wanted to successfully cultivate all ten ultimate maxims to the third realm and then break through to the great emperor realm. If that happened, he did not know what level his great Dao would reach.</p><p>This was something that ordinary people did not even dare to think about. However, Lu Ming was completely capable of doing it.</p><p>After thinking for a while, Lu Ming took out a few pieces of the world-core and started to refine it to increase his World Energy.</p><p>He had refined all the chaos gems in his possession. Now, he could only refine the world core and orirocks to increase his world power. The speed was naturally much slower.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s cultivation base was already at the limit of a six-star true Emperor. He was only one step away from becoming a seven-star true Emperor. It was not difficult for him to make a breakthrough.</p><p>Lu Ming spent a month’s time and finally broke through the bottleneck. He raised his cultivation level to seven-star true Emperor. Lu Ming’s combat strength had undoubtedly become stronger..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
