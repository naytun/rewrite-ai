Since they don’t welcome us, then let’s go, Deans!</p><p>Lu Ming said. He was very straightforward and turned to leave.</p><p>Emperor formless and the other two followed Lu Ming.</p><p>Hmph! Let’s hope that the evil god tribe can kill him!</p><p>The middle-aged man from the LAN family sneered. His name was LAN Kang and he was an uncle of LAN Yun.</p><p>Back then, at the LAN family, Lu Ming had humiliated the LAN family in public and even killed LAN Yun. Many people in the LAN family harbored a grudge against Lu Ming.</p><p>LAN Kang was even more so!</p><p>If not for the celestial Thearch backing Lu Ming up, he would have killed Lu Ming himself.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>After Lu Ming and the others left, the people from the heaven realm flew toward the mountain range.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other three did not fly. Instead, they walked along the ground. Not long after, they arrived at the foot of a huge mountain. Then, they took out some rough stones and began to refine them to restore their strength.</p><p>They had just experienced a great battle and needed to recover.</p><p>Not long after, they completely recovered.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what’s your plan next?”</p><p>Emperor Wu Xiang said.</p><p>this area should be the abode of an expert, and there might be some opportunities left behind. Wouldn’t it be a pity if we miss it? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>So what if he had left the crowd? Lu Ming was not worried.</p><p>His current battle-power was enough to kill a two star great emperor, and with the indestructible ancient scroll’s powerful recovery ability, he wouldn’t be afraid even if he were to face a three star great emperor.</p><p>Immediately, the four of them also rushed towards the palace on the mountain.</p><p>Not long after, they arrived at a mountain peak. There was a Palace on this mountain peak, but there were figures flickering in the palace. They were other creatures from the heaven realm. It was obvious that they had already been occupied.</p><p>The four of them left the place and changed direction.</p><p>This area was extremely vast, and one couldn’t see the end of it.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at another mountain peak with a Palace, which was also occupied.</p><p>The four of them didn’t stop and continued to move forward. Slowly, they deviated from their original direction and moved closer to the left.</p><p>“There’s someone in front!”</p><p>After a while, Lu Ming muttered. He noticed some movement in front of him.</p><p>The few of them found a hidden place and looked forward.</p><p>There was a cliff in front of them. It looked very ordinary and there was nothing unusual about it.</p><p>&Nbsp; but at this moment, there were a few evil god race members that were wandering around the bottom of the cliff.</p><p>“Could there be something unusual here?”</p><p>Lu Ming and the other three had an idea. They then observed patiently.</p><p>At the bottom of the cliff, a total of four members of the evil god tribe were searching the cliff.</p><p>“Are you sure there are treasures here?”</p><p>One of the evil god race members asked with uncertainty.</p><p>it shouldn’t be wrong. 1 can sense that there’s something extraordinary here. Keep looking. There’s definitely something fishy!</p><p>One of the four-armed evil god clansmen said. He was very agile and kept flashing under the cliff.</p><p>“There it is!”</p><p>what? ” the four-armed evil god race member suddenly cried out in joy. He lay on a broken cliff and pointed out with his fingers, sending beams of light into the stone wall.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The stone wall suddenly split open, and a crack appeared.</p><p>“Haha, it’s here!”</p><p>The evil god tribe members were overjoyed.</p><p>In the distance, the eyes of Lu Ming and the rest lit up.</p><p>He didn’t expect that an ordinary cliff would have another world.</p><p>This place was so well-hidden, so there might really be treasures inside.</p><p>there are four members of the evil god tribe, but only one of them is a two star great emperor. We can deal with him easily!</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Emperor Wu Xiang and the other two.</p><p>The three of them nodded, and a light flashed in their eyes. Then, the four of them restrained their Qi and ran along the ground toward the broken cliff.</p><p>In a few breaths, the four of them were close to the cliff.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>When they got close, one of the alien races noticed them and immediately shouted.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming immediately made his move and rushed towards the two star great emperor.</p><p>Emperor formless and the other two also charged toward the other three members of the evil god tribe.</p><p>Four versus four!</p><p>“Human, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>The two star great emperor from the evil god tribe had four arms. Four sharp blades appeared on his four arms. His body flashed, and the four sharp blades slashed toward Lu Ming at an astonishing speed.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Four sharp edges were aimed at Lu Ming’s vital points at an alarming speed!</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The muscles and bones in Lu Ming’s body vibrated. In an instant, the frequency of the vibrations exceeded one billion times.</p><p>A powerful vibration burst out with terrifying power. The void exploded and endless void storms swept in all directions. The opponent’s sharp blade was destroyed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming threw out a punch, and the force of his fist crushed over. The evil god race member let out a muffled groan, and his body flew out like a cannonball. He spat out a large mouthful of blood, and his face was pale.</p><p>One move and he was seriously injured.</p><p>“Not good, let’s go!”</p><p>The evil god race member knew that he had met an opponent he couldn’t defeat. He let out a loud roar and wanted to escape.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s speed was faster than his. With a flash, he caught up with the other party.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming punched continuously. Eleven types of light shone on his body. It was eleven types of laws erupting at the same time.</p><p>The other party did not have the strength to resist at all. He was crushed by Lu Ming’s fist force. He screamed in pain and his body was torn into pieces.</p><p>After killing this evil god, Lu Ming did not stop at all. With a flash, he charged toward the other three members of the evil god race.</p><p>The three evil god tribe members were merely one-star great emperor realm experts. The difference between them and Lu Ming was too great. They could not escape even if they wanted to. Lu Ming killed them all with a single punch.</p><p>After killing the four evil god tribesmen, Lu Ming kept their corpses into the small world.</p><p>Then, the four of them came to the crack.</p><p>There seemed to be a passage behind the crack.</p><p>Without much hesitation, the four of them entered the passage.</p><p>The passage was not very long, only a few thousand meters. After passing through the passage, the front suddenly opened up.</p><p>In front of him was a huge stone chamber. However, this stone chamber was empty.</p><p>“There’s an entrance there!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked ahead. There was a half-open stone door in the stone room.</p><p>They walked over and found that there was a stone staircase behind the stone door.</p><p>They walked down the stone stairs and soon came to a huge underground secret room. The secret room was very spacious, with only two iron boxes in the middle.</p><p>The eyes of the few people lit up.</p><p>The few of them carefully approached the metal box, worried that there was a large formation on it. However, when the four of them approached, there was nothing unusual.</p><p>Lu Ming took the lead and came to a metal box. He opened one of the metal boxes and immediately discovered rings inside.</p><p>There were a total of nine storage rings.</p><p>Lu Ming picked one up and scanned it with his spiritual senses. He was overjoyed.</p><p>There were raw gemstones in the storage ring, and they were all Supreme-grade raw gemstones. He had no idea how many there were.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming picked up another storage ring and discovered that there were also raw gemstones in it. Moreover, they were all top-grade raw gemstones of the highest grade..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
