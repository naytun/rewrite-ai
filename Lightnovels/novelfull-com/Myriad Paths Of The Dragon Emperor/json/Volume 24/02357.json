The pressure of a great emperor was like a storm, pressing down on Lu Ming and the other three.</p><p>The two two star great emperors ‘auras were even more astonishing. They made the three emperors tremble and take two steps back.</p><p>“Lu Ming, surrender and hand over your storage ring!”</p><p>LAN mo sneered.</p><p>“If you have the ability, come and take it yourself!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly. His expression did not change at all when he was facing the seven experts.</p><p>“Stubborn! Attack and cripple him!”</p><p>kill him! LAN mo said coldly. He took a step forward and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>In his opinion, Lu Ming was only slightly stronger than him. With him and one or two people assisting him, they would be able to take Lu Ming down in a few moves.</p><p>He rushed toward Lu Ming. However, in the next moment, his pupils suddenly shrank because Lu Ming’s figure had suddenly disappeared. When he reappeared, he was already in front of him.</p><p>“How could it be so fast? not good!”</p><p>This thought flashed through LAN Mo’s mind. He wanted to retaliate but it was too late. He saw Lu Ming’s palm rapidly enlarging in front of his eyes and pressing on his face.</p><p>A terrifying force gushed out from Lu Ming’s palm. The blue membrane could not resist this force at all. He could even hear the sound of his neck bones breaking.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming pressed his palm on LAN Mo’s face, causing him to crash to the ground.</p><p>With a violent boom, the earth shook and the mountain rocks trembled. A huge pit appeared in the ground. LAN mo lay in the pit, twitching and spitting out large mouthfuls of blood. His bones and armor were all broken.</p><p>He wasn’t dead yet, but his eyes were filled with fear and disbelief!</p><p>How long had it been since he last fought with Lu Ming?</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming could barely defeat him. In terms of direct combat, Lu Ming was not stronger than him. In the end, Lu Ming was able to win because of the indestructible ancient scroll.</p><p>But now, he could not fight back at all in front of Lu Ming. He was more fragile than a baby and was pressed to the ground by Lu Ming with one move.</p><p>The remaining six people were also shocked!</p><p>“Let’s join forces to deal with him!”</p><p>A two star great emperor shouted.</p><p>Instantly, the two two star great emperors rushed toward Lu Ming at the same time.</p><p>Lu Ming had beaten LAN mo to a half-dead state in one move. Such combat strength made them tremble with fear and they decided to join forces to take Lu Ming down.</p><p>“You came just in time!”</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. The glow of eleven types of laws emanated from his body. The muscles in his body trembled and he charged at his opponent.</p><p>“This is … Eleven maxims and five ultimate maxims …”</p><p>When the two two-star great emperors saw the glow on Lu Ming’s body, they were shocked and in disbelief.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>While the two of them were in shock, Lu Ming’s attack had already arrived. Lu Ming’s fist force was like a storm, blasting towards the two of them.</p><p>The terrifying fist force made it hard for the two to breathe.</p><p>The two of them growled and attacked with all their might. The aura of the great Dao filled the air as they cast their divine abilities to fight against Lu Ming.</p><p>A series of deafening explosions rang out, and two figures were forced to retreat.</p><p>They were two star great emperors!</p><p>At this moment, the two of them were extremely shocked.</p><p>They felt as if the bones in their arms were about to crack. Lu Ming’s attack was shockingly powerful. Even with the two of them working together, they were at a disadvantage.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>After Lu Ming pushed the two of them back, he did not give them any chance to catch their breath. He launched a series of attacks. Moreover, Lu Ming did not care about his own defense at all. He fought with all his might. This allowed Lu Ming to unleash his full combat strength.</p><p>The two two-star great emperors attacked with all their might, but they were no match for Lu Ming. Every time they collided with Lu Ming, their bodies trembled violently and they were forced to retreat. Their qi and blood were in turmoil, and blood flowed from the corners of their mouths.</p><p>They were shocked. Lu Ming’s combat strength was already on par with a three star great emperor. If they were alone, they would have been defeated long ago.</p><p>“Lose!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and rushed towards one of the two star great emperors, completely ignoring the attacks of the other.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Two clashing sounds rang out. One of the two star great Emperor’s attacks hit Lu Ming, but at the same time, Lu Ming’s attack hit the other two star great emperor.</p><p>The two-star great emperor who was hit by Lu Ming let out a blood-curdling screech as his body flew out and crashed into the wall of the cliff. He spat out a mouthful of blood as a large hole appeared in his chest. He was severely injured.</p><p>Lu Ming was hit. Although he was sent flying, he only spat out a mouthful of blood. His aura was still strong and he was not seriously injured.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and kicked the two star great emperor behind him like a steel whip. His body was sent flying like a cannonball, and he was severely injured.</p><p>The two two-star great emperors had only exchanged a few blows with Lu Ming, but they were already severely injured by him.</p><p>The remaining one-star great emperor, who had been fighting against Emperor formless and the other two, turned pale with fright and retreated at top speed.</p><p>The most shocked person was LAN mo. His eyes were wide open and he was almost scared to death.</p><p>Two two star great emperors were severely injured by Lu Ming in an instant. What kind of combat strength did Lu Ming have? How could his improvement be so fast?</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold gaze swept toward LAN mo, causing him to tremble and his face to turn pale.</p><p>spare me, spare me!</p><p>LAN mo actually struggled to get up on his knees and begged Lu Ming for mercy.</p><p>It was rare for a great emperor like him to kneel down and beg for mercy from a junior.</p><p>this time, I’ll spare your lives. If there’s a next time, I’ll definitely kill you!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. Then, he, Emperor formless, and the other two left the place in a flash.</p><p>It wasn’t that he was soft-hearted, but that their greatest opponent in this formation was still the evil god tribe.</p><p>If they killed LAN mo and the others, it would weaken the strength of the heaven realm’s side, which would be disadvantageous to them.</p><p>However, if the other party was insatiable, he would not hold back.</p><p>Lu Ming’s group of four left the place and headed to the right. They arrived at a rather remote mountain peak.</p><p>The four of them opened up a cave, sealed the entrance, and entered the cave.</p><p>Then, he took out all his raw gemstones, chaos stones, primordial chaos stones, and great Dao fragments.</p><p>“Lu Ming, take these chaos gems and primordial chaos gems. They’ll be very useful to you!”</p><p>Emperor formless handed the storage ring with the chaos gems and primordial chaos gems to Lu Ming.</p><p>how can we do that? we obtained these things together. We should split them equally!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>no, Lu Ming. Without you, the three of us wouldn’t have been able to get such a great opportunity. Moreover, we’re already so old. Our potential is limited. It’s a waste to occupy a large amount of resources. We’ll only be able to make the most out of it if we leave it to you. We’ll just take a few great Dao fragments!</p><p>Huntian Grand Emperor said.</p><p>1 don’t have a fragment of the great Dao for the time being. The three Deans are of use to me, so take them all!</p><p>Lu Ming pushed the thirty great Dao fragments to Emperor notionless and the other two.</p><p>However, Emperor formless and the other two shook their heads. The three of them took 18 fragments of the great Dao and gave the remaining fragments to Lu Ming.</p><p>The three of them each took one of the raw gemstones from the eight storage rings. They gave the remaining five to Lu Ming.</p><p>The three of them were determined. Lu Ming had no choice but to keep it..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
