They realized that the evil god tribe had a total of 800 to 900 people, which was a few hundred more than them.</p><p>The powerhouses from both sides quickly approached the core.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Just as Lu Ming and the rest were about to reach the core area, there was a violent roar in the fog. The ground was shaking continuously. Then, a huge creature appeared.</p><p>It was a huge turtle!</p><p>This turtle was even bigger than a mountain. It had a thick shell on its back, a dragon’s head, and a snake’s tail. It was very similar to the legendary Xuanwu, one of the Four Divine Beasts.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Black Tortoise let out a loud roar. It opened its mouth and howled, causing the ground to shake. Countless rocks actually squirmed and transformed into stone swords that slashed towards them.</p><p>“Heaven worshiping Dao soldiers!”</p><p>Hong Shi shouted and waved his hand. A purple-gold combat sword floated out, emitting a shocking aura and pressure.</p><p>Six peak emperors attacked at the same time, injecting their DAOs and world power into the purple-gold sword.</p><p>The purple-gold combat sword let out a sword cry. It became bigger and bigger, and the sword cry was shocking.</p><p>This was the heaven Dao soldier!</p><p>Five to six peak great emperors working together to control the heaven Dao soldiers might not be able to unleash their full power, but it was still terrifying.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The purple-gold combat sword trembled, and a faint pressure of the heavenly path spread out. At the same time, purple sword Qi burst out, shattering the stone swords of Xuanwu.</p><p>There were also some peak emperors who took out another heaven Dao soldier.</p><p>This time, he had borrowed a total of two heaven Dao soldiers.</p><p>The second heaven Dao weapon was a round bead that was as black as ink, but it was also extremely powerful.</p><p>die! seven or eight peak emperors controlled the black bead and crushed it toward the Black Tortoise.</p><p>A dozen peak emperors controlled two heaven Dao soldiers to attack the Black Tortoise.</p><p>roar! the Xuanwu gave a long roar and exploded out with a shocking aura. The ground continuously trembled, and rocks and dirt formed all sorts of attacks that attacked the two heaven Dao soldiers, causing an intense battle to break out.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At the same time, a Dragon’s Roar rang out from another direction as an incomparably huge Azure Dragon appeared. Its body wriggled as it charged toward the evil god race with an overbearing aura.</p><p>On the evil god tribe’s side, they also took out two combat weapons that were extremely powerful and started to fight with the Azure Dragon.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>On the heaven realm’s side, the two heaven Dao soldiers erupted with terrifying power. This power had completely surpassed the level of great emperors and entered the level of heavenly emperors.</p><p>The two heaven Dao soldiers struck out at the same time, instantly destroying some of the Xuanwu’s attacks and blasting them towards it.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A purple-gold sword light slashed at the Xuanwu, but the Xuanwu moved its body and the sword light only hit the turtle shell, leaving a shallow mark. “Such a strong defense!”</p><p>The people from the heaven realm all had ugly expressions.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this time, the black bead also came down, but the Black Tortoise still avoided its vital parts. When the bead hit the tortoise shell, the Black Tortoise only trembled a little and took a few steps back, but it was not seriously injured.</p><p>At this moment, a wail rang out from afar. The Azure Dragon had been struck by the evil god race’s combat weapon, and a deep wound had appeared on its body.</p><p>The Azure Dragon was injured, and the evil god tribe had the advantage.</p><p>damn it, we’re so unlucky to have encountered the Black Tortoise!</p><p>Hong Shi roared angrily, somewhat unwilling.</p><p>It wasn’t that the Xuanwu was stronger than the Azure Dragon. The difference in strength between the two wasn’t that great. With two heaven Dao soldiers, they should be able to suppress or even kill the other.</p><p>However, the Black Tortoise’s defense was too strong.</p><p>The Black Tortoise was known for its defensive power.</p><p>The Black Tortoise’s defensive power was far above the Azure Dragon’s. It had a tenacious vitality and was even more difficult to deal with.</p><p>Before they made their move, they were afraid of encountering the Black Tortoise. They didn’t expect to really encounter it.</p><p>“Everyone, attack together!”</p><p>Hong Shi roared, calling for everyone to attack.</p><p>“Kill, kill!”</p><p>All six hundred of them were advanced great emperors, and their combined attacks were shockingly powerful.</p><p>Beams of dazzling light shot toward the Black Tortoise.</p><p>However, the Black Tortoise’s head and limbs retracted into its shell. All the attacks landed on its shell, and only a violent boom could be heard. The Black Tortoise was completely fine, and it couldn’t break through the other party’s defense.</p><p>A dozen peak emperors controlled the heavenly Dao soldiers to attack, but they were also blocked.</p><p>However, as soon as the heaven realm’s people stopped attacking or their attacks weakened, Black Tortoise would immediately counterattack. With Black Tortoise’s strength, he was a great threat to them.</p><p>Not far away, the Azure Dragon wailed as another wound appeared on its body.</p><p>The Azure Dragon’s defensive power was far inferior to the Black Tortoise’s. It was retreating step by step, and it was only a matter of time before it was defeated and killed.</p><p>“Hahaha, this treasure land will belong to us!”</p><p>hahahahaha! the evil god tribe members laughed out loud, extremely carefree.</p><p>As long as they killed the Azure Dragon first and entered the core area first, the treasures in the core area would be theirs.</p><p>“Let’s attack together!”</p><p>The evil god tribe also called for everyone to attack together. With 800 to 900 high-tier great emperors attacking at the same time, it was simply enough to destroy the world.</p><p>Instantly, the Azure Dragon’s injuries became even more severe. Wounds kept appearing on his body, and his aura became weaker and weaker. He was becoming less and less of a match.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>On the side of the heaven realm, many people were roaring in anger. If this continued, they wouldn’t be able to get anything at all. Wouldn’t the evil god race benefit from this?</p><p>No matter who it was, the evil god race was the last to benefit!</p><p>“Looks like I’ll have to personally make a move!”</p><p>At the side, dandan spoke.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. Dandan was the divine turtle of the world, one of the top ten war beasts. It was also a turtle, and it was at the peak of the turtle species.</p><p>Even the real Xuanwu was only comparable to dandan, not to mention that this one only had some of the bloodline of the real Xuanwu.</p><p>Dandan soared into the sky, and his body underwent a drastic change. He turned into a giant turtle, and his body grew larger and larger, almost filling the entire sky.</p><p>The turtle shell was covered with mysterious patterns, as if it was a world.</p><p>“Junior, why aren’t you kneeling after seeing me?”</p><p>Dandan looked at the Black Tortoise, and a huge pressure pressed down on the Black Tortoise.</p><p>The Black Tortoise’s eyes were filled with shock and fear.</p><p>This was the fear of a lower person facing a higher person.</p><p>Although dandan’s cultivation base was not as high as the other party’s, the divine turtle of the world was definitely at the top among all turtles.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>At this moment, Hong Shi and the others seized the opportunity and controlled the heaven Dao soldiers to attack the Black Tortoise.</p><p>The Black Tortoise was intimidated by dandan’s aura. Its mind was shaken, and its movements slowed down a lot. Suddenly, its head was hit.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The purple-gold heaven Dao soldier was extremely huge, and the entire blade was inserted into the Xuanwu’s head.</p><p>The defense of the Xuanwu’s shell was amazing, but its head and limbs were very weak. They were weaker than the other godly beasts and were its vital points.</p><p>The Black Tortoise’s head was pierced and it was severely injured. It wailed in pain..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
