Instead, it looked like a paradise.</p><p>“There’s definitely a great opportunity here!11</p><p>Many people’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“Look, what’s that?”</p><p>Suddenly, someone pointed at the sky and exclaimed.</p><p>Everyone looked up at the sky and saw that there were lines of runes in the sky. Those runes were like runes, emitting a bright light.</p><p>Then, a teenager appeared.</p><p>“There’s actually someone here?”</p><p>no, this person isn’t a physical body. He’s an illusionary body!</p><p>The appearance of this youth shocked many people. However, they also discovered that this youth wasn’t a real entity and didn’t have any life aura.</p><p>hahaha, it’s been so many years since someone came in. Now, someone finally came in. Finally, there’s something to play!</p><p>The teenager widened his eyes and looked at Lu Ming and the rest. He seemed to be unusually excited.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>“Me? I’m the formation spirit of this place. Don’t tell me you didn’t notice that this place is enveloped by a great formation?”</p><p>The young man smiled as his eyes darted around. He seemed to be even more interested.</p><p>“Formation spirit!”</p><p>Many people’s hearts moved and they were very surprised.</p><p>Only some extremely profound and powerful array techniques, and after a long period of time, could give birth to an array spirit. The array spirit had intelligence and was no different from ordinary people.</p><p>“I’ll tell you something. Once you enter this place, you won’t be able to leave!”</p><p>The young man continued to smile.</p><p>Everyone’s expression changed.</p><p>Can’t get out? what did that mean?</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>An expert from the evil god tribe spoke with an ugly expression.</p><p>“If you can’t get out, then you can’t. You’ll have to stay here for the rest of your lives!”</p><p>The young man pouted and explained again.</p><p>I don’t believe it. Since we can come in, we can also go out. As long as we break this formation, it will be fine!</p><p>The three star great emperor of the LAN family shouted.</p><p>Many people’s eyes lit up. That’s right. If they could break through the formation and enter, they could also break through the formation and leave.</p><p>“Everyone, let’s work together to break through the formation and open the gate!”</p><p>The LAN family’s three star great emperor called out.</p><p>“Good, attack!”</p><p>The others responded.</p><p>BOOM! boom!</p><p>On the heaven realm’s side, more than 100 great emperor realm experts attacked at the same time. Beams of brilliant light shot towards the door.</p><p>This time, the door also shone with light, and a light screen appeared.</p><p>All the attacks landed on the light screen, but it was like a sea of mud. There was no movement at all, not even a ripple.</p><p>Everyone’s faces turned ugly.</p><p>Previously, when they were outside, they could at least cause the light shield to shake violently when they attacked the door. It was not like now, where there were no waves at all.</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>The three star great emperor from the LAN clan roared. Everyone continued to attack, but the result was the same. There was no change at all.</p><p>“Everyone, let’s attack together. Otherwise, you’ll all have to stay here!”</p><p>Some people looked at the experts from the evil god tribe.</p><p>“Alright, let’s attack together!”</p><p>The expert from the evil god tribe nodded. In the face of such a situation, both sides had no choice bur to join forces once again.</p><p>In the sky, the young man was smiling as he looked on with a slight disdain.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>This time, the evil god race and the heaven realm beings attacked together, and their momentum was extremely shocking.</p><p>However, the result was the same as before. Their attacks didn’t cause any ripples on the light screen.</p><p>There wasn’t even a ripple.</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>Someone shouted. They kept attacking, but it was useless.</p><p>“It’s useless!”</p><p>Lu Ming s expression was a little ugly and he stopped.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>Someone shouted in disbelief.</p><p>Just now, they had broken through the formation outside, opened the door, and rushed in.</p><p>Why couldn’t they do it now?</p><p>I’m telling you, I did it on purpose when you broke the formation outside. The power of the formation back then was only one percent of what it is now. The formation here can’t be broken without the cultivation of the heavenly Emperor realm!</p><p>The young man said indifferently.</p><p>“What? Only those at the heavenly Emperor realm can break it!”</p><p>Everyone’s faces were extremely ugly.</p><p>“I cant!”</p><p>Someone shouted and rushed towards the door. However, he was blocked by a light screen halfway.</p><p>He continued to attack, but the terrifying energy disappeared after it hit the light screen.</p><p>“Since we can’t attack the gate, then we ll attack this formation spirit, take him down, and force him to open the gate!’1</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>“That’s right, take down this formation spirit!”</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>Instantly, at least a hundred experts rushed into the sky. There were beings from both the evil god tribe and the heaven realm.</p><p>Lu Ming did not move. He had a feeling that it would not be that simple.</p><p>Sure enough, when the hundred experts approached the formation spirit, veined patterns appeared in the sky, and a layer of light covered the formation spirit.</p><p>Over a hundred experts attacked, all kinds of attacks bombarding the formation spirit.</p><p>However, just like the previous attacks on the door, all the attacks were blocked by the light screen and did not cause any waves.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Many people roared, but it was useless. No matter how they attacked, they couldn’t hit the formation spirit.</p><p>it’s useless. Just give up. Without the cultivation of a Celestial Emperor, we can’t break this formation!</p><p>“It’s been countless years since anyone has come in. You can stay here and accompany me in peace, hahaha!”</p><p>The young man laughed out loud, extremely excited.</p><p>Ever since he had gained sentience, it had been countless years since any living being had entered. He had been lonely, so now that someone had entered, he was naturally excited.</p><p>“Are we really going to be trapped here forever?”</p><p>Some people were in despair.</p><p>Only a celestial Thearch could break through it. The entire void God Island had an unparalleled pressure that prevented the celestial Thearch from entering.</p><p>If the celestial Thearch couldn’t enter, no one could save them.</p><p>“You don’t have to think about other exits. This is the only exit! ”</p><p>The formation spirit laughed very happily, as if he found it interesting to see the others in despair.</p><p>“Is there really no way to get out?”</p><p>Someone asked unwillingly.</p><p>of course, it’s not that there’s no other way. Back then, my master, who was also the one who laid down this formation, left a way out!</p><p>At this time, the formation spirit pondered for a moment, and said.</p><p>Everyone was ecstatic!</p><p>“What way out?”</p><p>Someone asked excitedly.</p><p>As long as there was a way out, there would be hope to get out. As long as there was hope, there would be a way out.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were on the young man, waiting for his answer..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
