He roared and unleashed his full power, launching a move at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming threw a punch and LAN Kang’s attack was destroyed. The terrifying fist force was like a storm, blasting towards LAN Kang.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Lu Ming’s fist landed on LAN Kang’s fist. LAN Kang’s fist exploded, turning into flesh, blood, and bones that flew everywhere.</p><p>The surging fist force didn’t stop, bombarding LAN Kang’s body. LAN Kang screamed and his body flew hundreds of miles away, breaking a mountain peak.</p><p>LAN Kang had just broken through to four star great emperor. Lu Ming was too far behind him. He could completely crush him.</p><p>how is this possible? how is this possible? ”</p><p>LAN Kang shouted hysterically, and his body was retreating crazily.</p><p>At the same time, his aura erupted without any concealment, alarming the beings of the heavenly realm in the distance.</p><p>In the distance, the living beings of the heaven realm discovered the commotion and rushed over.</p><p>From afar, they saw a shocking scene. LAN Kang was being chased by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Everyone, save me! Lu Ming is filled with hatred and wants to kill me!”</p><p>LAN Kang roared.</p><p>A faint smile hung on Lu Ming’s face the entire time. He walked towards LAN Kang at a steady pace.</p><p>Didn’t lan Kang want him to know what despair was? Then let him taste what despair is!</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The beings in the distant heaven realm were dumbfounded and had expressions of disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to kill LAN Kang!</p><p>Didn’t lan Kang already break through to four star great emperor? How did he end up like this?</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>“Scream, scream! Let’s see who can save you today!”</p><p>Lu Ming remained calm and unruffled, slowly approaching LAN Kang.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you can’t kill me. I’ve broken through to four star great emperor. I’m the main force in fighting against the evil god tribe. You can’t kill me. If you kill me, everyone in the heaven realm will die!”</p><p>LAN Kang shouted crazily.</p><p>“You’re really stupid. Without you, all the people in the heaven realm will die? Where did you get your logic? are you treating me like a decoration?”</p><p>Lu Ming spoke with a strong sense of mockery.</p><p>i j ••</p><p>LAN Kang was tongue-tied.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s combat strength and LAN Kang’s help, he would be able to annihilate the evil god tribe by himself.</p><p>In the distance, the people from the heaven realm stopped and even changed their direction to avoid LAN Kang.</p><p>That’s right. Lu Ming was the only hope now. With Lu Ming, they could get out of here alive. As for LAN Kang, he could go to hell.</p><p>“Everyone, LAN Kang has been targeting me time and time again. Just now, he even ran to kill me. Tell me, should I kill him?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the heaven realm beings.</p><p>damn it! Such a despicable person deserves to die!</p><p>Immediately, someone spoke up. He looked at LAN Kang with a look of disdain and then bowed to Lu Ming in an attempt to please him.</p><p>“That’s right, he should be killed. If it wasn’t for the fact that my cultivation level is low, I would have killed him long ago!”</p><p>“That’s right, that’s right!”</p><p>The others chimed in.</p><p>What a joke. Now that Lu Ming’s ability far exceeded LAN Kang’s, they needed to rely on Lu Ming to survive. Naturally, they would rely on Lu Ming.</p><p>As for LAN Kang, what was he?</p><p>“You guys … You guys …”</p><p>LAN Kang roared, his eyes filled with despair.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch. The terrifying force of the punch crushed toward LAN Kang like an avalanche.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>LAN Kang’s body was like a broken sack, flying far away and hitting a mountain peak. He spat out a large mouthful of blood and his breath was extremely weak.</p><p>“Now, do you know what despair is?”</p><p>Lu Ming stood on top of LAN Kang’s head and said coldly.</p><p>LAN Kang continued to spit out blood, the despair in his eyes growing stronger.</p><p>At this moment, he was not only worried about his own life, but also for the LAN family.</p><p>Lu Ming was too abnormal and he had great luck.</p><p>Before they entered the void Island, Lu Ming’s abilities were only about the same as LAN Mo’s. It would take a lot of effort to defeat LAN mo.</p><p>But now, he had only been on the island for two years, and Lu Ming’s strength had soared to such an extent that he could suppress a four star great emperor. This was simply shocking.</p><p>Two years passed in the blink of an eye for a great emperor.</p><p>A great emperor would need tens of thousands of years to break through a realm, or even hundreds of thousands of years.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had grown to this level in just over two years. If he continued to grow, the LAN family would definitely be destroyed.</p><p>At this moment, he really wanted to tell the celestial Thearch of the LAN family that the patriarch of the LAN family should bury the hatchet with Lu Ming and resolve their grudges.</p><p>If he could not resolve it, he would have to get rid of Lu Ming at all costs.</p><p>Otherwise, in a few years, the LAN family would be the one to be destroyed.</p><p>Unfortunately, he was destined to never bring these words out.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He took a step forward and a terrifying power exploded, drowning LAN Kang.</p><p>LAN Kang, dead!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming kept LAN Kang’s storage ring. He scanned it with his spiritual senses and found an array disc in LAN Kang’s storage ring.</p><p>“Who else has a formation plate? give it to me!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze shifted to the living beings in the heaven realm.</p><p>“I have it!”</p><p>“I have one!”</p><p>Two beings from the heaven realm walked out, each holding a formation plate.</p><p>In this way, Lu Ming had four array discs in his hands.</p><p>it seems like the other formation disks are in the hands of the evil god tribe. It’s time to leave this place!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. He then looked at Emperor notionless and the other two with a smile.”Deans, let’s make a trip to the alien races!”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Emperor formless and the other two were excited.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately took the lead and they headed in the direction where the alien races were gathering.</p><p>“Lu Ming went to kill the alien races. Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>“Haha, we can go out now!”</p><p>The beings in the heaven realm were overjoyed and quickly followed behind Lu Ming.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at the place where the foreign races gathered.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A figure flashed in front of them. Nearly a hundred alien races gathered together and looked at Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>ants from the heaven realm, you’ve finally come. Let’s have a showdown!</p><p>I’m not afraid,” an extremely burly member of the evil god race said coldly.</p><p>The aura around him was extremely shocking, and he was equivalent to a four star great emperor.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop at all when he arrived. He stepped on the void and walked toward the alien race.</p><p>a little brat is actually so bold. He’s really looking for death. Let me kill him!</p><p>A skinny alien with four arms dashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>This alien race was known for their speed. In a few flashes, he had disappeared from his original spot. The next moment, four sharp lights suddenly appeared beside Lu Ming and slashed at his vital points.</p><p>However, Lu Ming just stood there as if he did not know that someone was attacking him.</p><p>Just as the four streaks of light were about to land on Lu Ming, he suddenly stretched out his hand and grabbed at the air.</p><p>All of a sudden, all the sharpness disappeared, and a shocking scene appeared.</p><p>Lu Ming grabbed the alien’s neck with one hand..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
