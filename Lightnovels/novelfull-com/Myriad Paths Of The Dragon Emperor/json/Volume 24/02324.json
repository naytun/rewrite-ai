It was terrifying to the extreme.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Heng Yu heavenly Emperor made his move. A combat sword appeared in his hand, and he slashed at Lan Cheng.</p><p>“Hengyu, I’ll fight you!”</p><p>The master of the eternal Star River was a gray-robed elder. He made his move and struck out a palm toward the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor.</p><p>The two of them exchanged a blow and were evenly matched.</p><p>The master of the eternal Star River was also an extremely terrifying existence. He was an expert even among the heavenly emperors and was not weaker than the eternal universe heavenly Emperor.</p><p>At this moment, the huge hand from LAN city was already approaching Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming stood calmly on the fighting ring. His expression did not change, as if he had not seen Lan Cheng’s attack.</p><p>At this moment, an old man suddenly appeared beside Lu Ming.</p><p>The old man’s face was calm as he threw out a punch.</p><p>This punch did not have the slightest surge of energy, nor did it contain any power of laws. It was just pure strength.</p><p>However, when this punch was thrown out, Lan Cheng’s big hand directly exploded. The terrifying fist force continued to blast toward Lan Cheng.</p><p>Lan Cheng’s expression changed, and he hurriedly used a Divine Art. A heavenly Lion pounced out.</p><p>There was a loud boom and Lan Cheng’s body trembled. He could not help but retreat. He looked at the old man beside Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>immemorial body cultivator, you’re an immemorial body cultivator, a body cultivator of the heavenly Emperor realm. Who are you?”</p><p>Lan Cheng roared in shock.</p><p>He did not expect that Lu Ming would have a heavenly Emperor with him. Moreover, it was a body cultivator that he had never seen before.</p><p>“A heavenly Emperor realm body cultivator!”</p><p>In the crowd, Bao de’s eyes emitted an excited light.</p><p>At the scene, the others were also shocked.</p><p>There was a heavenly Emperor-level body cultivator by Lu Ming’s side, helping him at the critical moment.</p><p>Ancient body cultivators were almost lost to the present day. There were very few people who cultivated it, and even fewer who could successfully cultivate it.</p><p>Today, in the heaven realm, there was only one known physical cultivator who could reach the heavenly Emperor realm, but it was definitely not the person in front of him.</p><p>could it be that this body cultivator hasn’t come out and has been living in seclusion?”</p><p>Someone guessed.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, are you going to make an enemy out of me and the LAN family just because of a junior?”</p><p>Lan Cheng stared at the old man and spoke coldly. His words revealed a hint of threat.</p><p>“Whoever dares to touch him, I’ll kill him with one punch!”</p><p>The old man pointed at Lu Ming and said indifferently. It was very simple and clear, but it made people stunned.</p><p>He would kill anyone who dared to touch Lu Ming with one punch!</p><p>This caused many people to gasp. This was something that a heavenly Emperor had said, so no one would doubt it.</p><p>Lan Cheng’s face also darkened. He said,” “I’m afraid that you alone won’t be enough!”</p><p>The Yan, Luo, and vast expanse Palace Lords also unleashed their terrifying auras toward the elder.</p><p>However, in the next moment, three more elders appeared beside Lu Ming. They were dressed in the same way as the previous elder. Their faces were calm, but a terrifying aura burst out, crushing the auras of the Yan family’s celestial Thearch and the others.</p><p>In the city of LAN, the celestial Thearch of the Yan family and the others narrowed their eyes in disbelief.</p><p>Heavenly Emperor, all of them were heavenly Emperor realm powerhouses, and they were all body cultivators. How was this possible?</p><p>At the scene, the others were also shocked and dumbfounded.</p><p>Lu Ming had so many heavenly Emperor powerhouses by his side. This force was too terrifying. The LAN family could not do anything to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Damn it, how is this possible? where did these experts come from?”</p><p>Lan Cheng roared in his heart.</p><p>As a heavenly Emperor, he had seen or heard of all the heavenly emperors in the Tai Qing heavenly region. However, he had never heard of these elders.</p><p>So many heavenly Emperor realm body cultivators, where did they come from? “Could it be one of those old monsters hiding in the dark?”</p><p>Lan Cheng couldn’t help but think.</p><p>There were naturally some hidden old monsters in the taiqing heavenly region or the primordial realm. Their cultivation strength was terrifyingly strong, and they usually cultivated in seclusion. Only when the alien races launched a truly terrifying war would these strong cultivators come out.</p><p>At this moment, many thoughts flashed through Lan Cheng’s mind.</p><p>“Blue City, hand over all the people who tried to kill me on the battlefield, as well as the people who killed senior Bai tai and the others. Also, hand over all the people from the Yan clan. I want to see them all!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and glared at Lan Cheng. His voice spread throughout the entire area.</p><p>Lu Ming would not let off any of those who had attacked him. All of them had to die.</p><p>preposterous! Those people were clearly killed by you, and now you actually want me to call for help!</p><p>Lan Cheng roared. At this moment, he still insisted that Lu Ming killed him and snatched his treasure.</p><p>“Lu Ming, although I don’t know where you found your helpers, the LAN family is not afraid of you!”</p><p>Lan Cheng continued to speak loudly, and a shocking aura burst out from his body.</p><p>The Yan, Luo, and vast expanse Palace heavenly emperors also raised their auras to the maximum. The heavens and earth were filled with the terrifying pressure of the heavenly Dao.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>A few body cultivators took a small step forward. This small step caused the entire ground to shake, and the fighting stage under their feet turned into dust.</p><p>Lan Cheng’s group’s expressions changed slightly, and they couldn’t help but take a few steps back.</p><p>In the clash of auras, they were at a disadvantage, and this made their expressions extremely ugly.</p><p>everyone, are you going to just watch as Lu Ming acts arrogantly? this guy killed people and stole their treasures. His character is extremely vile, but he’s very talented. We can’t let him continue to grow!</p><p>Lan Cheng looked at the others.</p><p>Today, there were not only heavenly emperors from the Yan family and the Luo family. There were also a few other heavenly emperors, but they didn’t have a good relationship with the LAN family, so they didn’t attack.</p><p>At this moment, the eyes of these people flickered.</p><p>They were considering whether to help the LAN family or not.</p><p>The talent that Lu Ming had displayed was too shocking. If this continued, he would become a peak expert sooner or later. Moreover, he had the help of many powerful experts by his side.</p><p>They had offended Lu Ming. If Lu Ming did not die, they would be the ones in trouble in the future.</p><p>Therefore, these people were hesitant.</p><p>“Hehe, I’m definitely going to get those people today!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly and then sent a message.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Just as Lu Ming sent out the news, a violent roar came from the depths of the sky.</p><p>Then, the sky split open, and a huge Palace appeared in the depths of the sky. Above it, there was a gray fog.</p><p>“This is … Primal Chaos Palace!”</p><p>Many people’s pupils contracted in shock.</p><p>The primal Chaos Palace of the primal Chaos Emperor was extremely famous in the heaven realm.</p><p>Although the primal Chaos Thearch had died long ago, he had left behind some powerful puppets. More than ten years ago, they had fought in another battlefield and displayed terrifying strength.</p><p>Why had the primal Chaos Hall suddenly appeared here?</p><p>Everyone was puzzled.</p><p>At this moment, nine beams of light flew out from the primal Chaos Palace. They were nine figures, each of them exuding an astonishing aura.</p><p>The celestial Emperor!</p><p>The aura of the heavenly Emperor. The nine figures were all heavenly emperors..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
