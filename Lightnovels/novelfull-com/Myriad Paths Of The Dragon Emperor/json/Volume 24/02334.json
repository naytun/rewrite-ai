The great Dao that LAN mo comprehended should only be an ordinary great Dao, but it’s so powerful. 1 wonder how powerful the strongest great Dao is? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was filled with all kinds of thoughts.</p><p>There were two types of great DAOs!</p><p>In the true Emperor realm, those who had not comprehended an ultimate law and only evolved a great Dao from a King Dao law and ordinary laws were ordinary great DAOs.</p><p>As for those who comprehended the ultimate laws, they were great DAOs evolved from one type of ultimate law and all the other King Dao laws. They were called the ultimate great Dao.</p><p>Among those of the same level, the strongest great Dao was much more powerful than ordinary great DAOs.</p><p>LAN mo had only comprehended an ordinary great Dao and was a one star great emperor. He was definitely considered weak among great emperors.</p><p>If it was a one-star great emperor who had comprehended the strongest great Dao, Lu Ming would most likely be hard-pressed to defeat him.</p><p>“Then let’s change our strategy!”</p><p>There was a flash in Lu Ming’s eyes. He suddenly changed his offensive to a full-force attack, completely disregarding defense.</p><p>This was a desperate fight.</p><p>Lu Ming’s attack changed and increased sharply, suppressing the blue film in an instant.</p><p>damn it, you don’t care about defense. You think I’m afraid of you? kill!</p><p>LAN mo roared. He also gave up on defense and attacked with all his might.</p><p>Normally, when people fought against each other, they would reserve some of their strength for defense. Now that they were going all out to attack, both of them were instantly hit.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>LAN Mo’s punch landed on Lu Ming’s shoulder, and Lu Ming’s palm also hit LAN Mo’s shoulder.</p><p>The two of them trembled and retreated.</p><p>The difference was that there was a dent on Lu Ming’s shoulder. However, not a single drop of blood flowed out. The wound was healing rapidly.</p><p>As for LAN mo, he was in a much worse state. It was as if his shoulder had been cut by a battle blade, almost chopping off one of his arms. A deep wound was revealed, and blood was flowing out. Even his bones had been shattered.</p><p>LAN Mo’s face was slightly pale.</p><p>Although the great Emperor’s recovery ability was also extremely shocking, it could not be compared to Lu Ming’s.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not give the blue membrane any time to recover and launched another attack.</p><p>LAN mo was injured and it was almost impossible for him to move one of his arms. His combat strength was greatly reduced and he was at a complete disadvantage. He was no match for Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Following that, LAN mo was hit continuously by Lu Ming and spat out large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>Although he managed to hit Lu Ming, Lu Ming was not seriously injured and his combat strength was not affected.</p><p>“Indestructible ancient scroll!”</p><p>LAN mo roared, extremely unwilling.</p><p>He knew that Lu Ming had used the indestructible ancient scroll and was not afraid of being injured.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming seized the opportunity and landed a palm on LAN Mo’s face. LAN mo screamed and his body was sent flying. Blood mixed with his teeth flew out and he hit the light shield.</p><p>LAN Mo’s brain was buzzing, he was completely stunned.</p><p>Lu Ming would not let go of such an opportunity. He rushed over and punched and kicked LAN Mo’s face and body.</p><p>The blue membrane was like a sandbag. It was instantly bombarded by Lu Ming with dozens of moves.</p><p>After a few dozen moves, the blue membrane flew out and fell to the ground. It was covered in blood and twitched non-stop.</p><p>Hiss… Hiss…</p><p>Gasps of shock could be heard. Outside the light barrier, whether it was the void Emperor, the true Emperor, or the great emperor, all of them were so shocked that their mouths were wide open.</p><p>A great emperor had been defeated by a young true Emperor!</p><p>Furthermore, he had lost so badly. He had been madly abused. He had been abused so badly that even his mother couldn’t recognize him.</p><p>It was really tragic!</p><p>Needless to say, LAN mo would definitely become a laughing stock and Lu Ming’s reputation would be pushed to the peak.</p><p>A true Emperor had defeated a great emperor. This had completely broken the truth and created a miracle.</p><p>haha, not bad. I’ve had a great time today!</p><p>Lu Ming laughed.</p><p>He had basically figured out his own combat strength.</p><p>Of course, if he used the indestructible ancient scroll and fought with all his might, he would be able to suppress his opponent. He should be able to compete with a one-star great emperor who had comprehended the most powerful great Dao.</p><p>His main purpose in this battle was to test his abilities. Now that the test was over, Lu Ming decided to leave.</p><p>LAN Mo’s mind was initially clearer. However, after hearing Lu Ming’s words, he was so angry that he spat out a mouthful of blood. He roared and fainted. “I’m dizzy!”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips. He then took a step forward and left the light shield.</p><p>When the others saw Lu Ming coming out, they automatically made way for him. This was an invisible force.</p><p>Lu Ming was so young, but his combat strength had already entered the great emperor realm. In a few years, he would be even more impressive and would definitely become an Invincible Overlord.</p><p>Lu Ming left the place and returned to his residence. With a thought, his soul appeared in the small world. It appeared on a mountain peak and looked into the distance.</p><p>The current small world had a radius of 600000 miles and was boundlessly vast.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming had planted many spiritual and sacred herbs in the small world. He had also scattered the seeds of various plants.</p><p>Now, there were many places in the small world that were covered in green grass and flowers.</p><p>There were also some small trees in some places.</p><p>It was not very old yet, and there were no large trees.</p><p>Similarly, there were no animals or demonic beasts.</p><p>However, the small world was becoming more and more similar to the outside world. Lu Ming planned to let some animals, demonic beasts, and the like in in the future. That way, it would be no different from the outside world.</p><p>Of course, although Lu Ming’s cultivation level had improved very quickly, there was still a large area of territory that was deathly silent and lifeless.</p><p>This required time for the vegetation in the small world to slowly multiply.</p><p>With a thought, Lu Ming came to the path-understanding ancient tree.</p><p>The path-understanding ancient tree had been planted on a plain. It was now five hundred meters tall.</p><p>This was all due to the five-colored soil.</p><p>The 500-meter-tali path-understanding ancient tree shot up into the sky. Its trunk was extremely thick, and between its branches, there was a great Dao. Cultivating here would greatly increase the speed of comprehending nomological laws.</p><p>With the ancient martial tree as the center, the plain was covered in green grass and fresh flowers. The fragrance of the flowers assailed the nose.</p><p>It was mainly because of the five-colored soil that the vegetation in this area was particularly strong. There were also many spiritual and sacred medicines that smelled good.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged under the path-understanding ancient tree, cultivating quietly.</p><p>The news that Lu Ming had defeated LAN mo was spreading like wildfire.</p><p>Everyone who heard the news was first shocked, then overjoyed, shocked, jealous, and angry. There were all kinds of expressions and emotions.</p><p>Lu Ming had caused another wave in the vast land of the Tai Qing heavenly region.</p><p>Seven days passed in the blink of an eye. On this day, the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor came to Lu Ming’s residence.</p><p>The Heng Yu heavenly Emperor did not conceal his aura. Lu Ming sensed his arrival the moment he arrived.</p><p>Lu Ming ended his cultivation and met with the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor. “Senior Hengyu, may 1 know why you are looking for Lu Ming?”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Lu Ming, i heard that you defeated LAN mo, so 1 came to take a look. Hahaha, you’re really amazing. Even i was shocked!”</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu said with a smile..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
