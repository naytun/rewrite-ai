Naturally, they had to rely on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Seniors, follow me!”</p><p>Lu Ming identified the direction and headed in the direction of two world city. The rest of the people followed him.</p><p>The battlefield they were in was not the battlefield of the illusionary emperors, the battlefield of the true emperors, or the battlefield of the great sovereigns. It was an ordinary battlefield.</p><p>Their auras were too powerful as they charged through the air with astonishing might.</p><p>On the way, some alien races encountered them, and their expressions changed. They turned and ran, but they were killed with a single punch by the Archean body cultivator.</p><p>They had encountered several waves of foreign races, but they were all killed by the enraged immemorial body cultivators.</p><p>Right now, all of the Archean body cultivators were furious. Because of the foreign races, they had lost their homes and ancestral lands. Naturally, they were furious.</p><p>Not long after, two world city finally appeared in front of them.</p><p>Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>When Lu Ming and the rest approached, deafening war drums reverberated above two world city. On the city walls, there was a flash of light and figures appeared one after another.</p><p>It was obvious that the experts above two world city had already discovered them. However, there were too many of them, and many of their auras were too strong. This naturally raised the alert of two world city.</p><p>“Everyone, we’re on the same side, we’re the living beings of the heaven realm!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>“Who are you people?”</p><p>A voice rang out from two world city.</p><p>The people in two world city were also very surprised.</p><p>Although there were many heaven realm creatures on the battlefield outside the two world city, there were not as many of them. Furthermore, some of them had extremely strong auras, and they were all unfamiliar to him.</p><p>This was shocking!</p><p>“Everyone, I’m lu Ming!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming walked out and said loudly.</p><p>“What? Lu Ming!”</p><p>The people in two world city were clearly shocked!</p><p>“Didn’t lu Ming die? He actually appeared again!”</p><p>could it be that he’s not dead and the rumors are false? then who are those people beside him?”</p><p>The two world city was abuzz with discussion.</p><p>“Everyone, these are our own people. Open the formation and let us in!”</p><p>Lu Ming said loudly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you can come in, but we need to report the others. We don’t know where they come from. If we let them in rashly, we can’t bear the consequences if something happens!”</p><p>A tall and sturdy man said.</p><p>“1’11 take responsibility!”</p><p>At this moment, a voice came from two world city. As soon as the voice fell, a few figures appeared on the two world city.</p><p>The leader was the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor!</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu looked at Lu Ming, his face filled with joy.</p><p>they’re all humans or divine beasts from the heaven realm. They’re definitely not from the foreign races. Activate the formation and let them in!</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu said.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The others obeyed.</p><p>The eternal universe heavenly Emperor was a heavenly Emperor, and not an ordinary one at that. His combat strength was extremely powerful, second only to those at the heavenly venerable rank. No one dared to disobey his orders.</p><p>Soon, the light shield outside two world city began to ripple, and a huge gap appeared.</p><p>“Enter!”</p><p>Lu Ming was the first to rush in. The others followed suit.</p><p>Not long after, everyone had entered two world city. The light shield outside the two world city closed up again.</p><p>hahaha, Lu Ming, I knew you would be fine. There were rumors that you were dead but 1 didn’t believe it at all!</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu walked over and laughed heartily. He was extremely happy.</p><p>Then, he looked at the Archean body cultivator, Ren Chan, and the others, and asked,” “Lu Ming, who are they?”</p><p>The eternal universe heavenly Emperor was extremely shocked.</p><p>Because some of them made his heart palpitate, and he felt a strong pressure.</p><p>He had never seen these people before, which made him quite shocked and curious.</p><p>they’re from ten thousand spirit heavenly region. They’re from the immemorial body cultivators…</p><p>Lu Ming gave a brief introduction. At the same time, he told them about his experience.</p><p>“The immemorial body cultivator lineage!”</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu’s pupils contracted as he cupped his fists at the Supreme elders of the Archean body cultivator. “I’m Hengyu. Greetings, fellow Daoists.”</p><p>“You’re welcome!”</p><p>The old body cultivator also nodded politely.</p><p>Lu Ming, 1 didn’t expect that you would come to the ten thousand spirit realm when there were rumors that you had died. It’s amazing!</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu sighed.</p><p>“Senior Hengyu, were the people who said 1 had died from the LAN family or the Yan family?”</p><p>Lu Ming said, a cold glint flashing in his eyes.</p><p>that’s right. They also said that you killed your fellow cultivators in the heaven realm for treasures. They saw you and wanted to take you down, but they accidentally rushed into a broken small world, and that small world collapsed in the end!</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu said.</p><p>hehe, the LAN family and the Yan family are really shameless. They were the ones who wanted to kill me and take my indestructible ancient scroll. They also killed the people in the heaven realm and put the blame on me!</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was cold. He was filled with killing intent at the thought of Bai Tai’s death.</p><p>“I knew it. As expected, the LAN and Yan families are doing very well!”</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu was also enraged upon hearing this, and his eyes were filled with killing intent.</p><p>since I’ve returned, I must take revenge. I’ll make a trip to the LAN family and the Yan family!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>Even if it wasn’t for anything else, he must avenge Bai Tai’s death. He wouldn’t let off a single one of those who had attacked him.</p><p>“Lu Ming, the LAN family and the Yan family are not in two world city now!”</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu said.</p><p>“Not in two world city?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>that’s right. The headquarters of the LAN family and the Yan family are not in the two world city, but in the central region of the Tai Qing heavenly region. The two world city is just their station. In the past two years, the alien races have stopped their attacks and the number of Wars has decreased. Therefore, some of the experts of the LAN family and the Yan family are not here!</p><p>recently, LAN Xia, the pride of the LAN family, is going to marry Xuanyuan Yi. They’ll hold a grand banquet and countless experts will gather in the LAN family. They’ll all be in the central region of the taiqing heavenly region!</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu explained.</p><p>“LAN Xia and Xuanyuan Yi, two of the nine absolutes!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>He had heard of these two names before. They were two of the nine absolutes of the heaven realm’s younger generation. They were both peerless geniuses.</p><p>Especially Xuanyuan Yi, who was ranked second among the nine absolutes. Many people said that he had the chance to become the first among the nine absolutes and stand at the peak of the younger generation in the Tian Yuan world!</p><p>LAN Xia is the proud daughter of the LAN family and LAN Yun’s elder sister. Her marriage with Xuanyuan Yi can be said to be a powerful Alliance and has attracted everyone’s attention. I heard that the LAN family has invited most of the heaven realm’s proud children. There will be a grand event!</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu said.</p><p>“When will they get married?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Half a month later!” Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu said..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
