They did not expect Lu Ming to really challenge a great emperor. Furthermore, he was taking the initiative.</p><p>A true Emperor fighting a great emperor, this was enough to shock the world!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The middle-aged man took a step forward and stepped into the light shield, standing opposite Lu Ming!</p><p>“Who do you think will win, Lu Ming or LAN mo?”</p><p>Outside, some people started to discuss in low voices.</p><p>“I think LAN MO will win for sure. Although Lu Ming’s combat strength is strong and he could easily kill a level 18 true Emperor five years ago, the difference between a true Emperor and a great emperor is too great. I’ve never heard of a true Emperor fighting a great emperor. Even the strongest true Emperor is no match for the weakest great emperor!”</p><p>that’s right. Lu Ming is definitely not his match. I’m guessing that Lu Ming will be defeated within twenty moves!</p><p>“Twenty moves? If Lu Ming has not made much progress in the past five years, I don’t think he can even withstand ten moves!”</p><p>Many people were discussing but no one thought that Lu Ming could fight against the great emperor. The gap between them was too big.</p><p>“Blue membrane? It seems that you are from the LAN family!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently, a cold glint flashing in his eyes. No wonder he was ridiculed by LAN mo the moment he appeared here. It turned out that he was from the LAN family.</p><p>that’s right, Lu Ming. You’re really arrogant. Although I can’t kill you here, no one will say anything if I abuse you!</p><p>LAN mo said maliciously.</p><p>“Oh, really? Let’s see if you have the ability to do so!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>then let me see what you, the number one heaven’s pride in the heaven realm, have.</p><p>LAN mo said coldly. Then, with a loud boom, LAN Mo’s figure charged towards Lu Ming at an astonishing speed. He threw a punch at Lu Ming with the force of Mount Tai.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming squinted his eyes. The power of his physical body and the power of the world burst out.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming struck out with his palm. There were six types of lusters on his palm, which contained six types of laws.</p><p>Chaos laws, death laws, devouring laws, smithing laws, array laws, and pill laws.</p><p>This was a sacred art.</p><p>Lu Ming had obtained the advanced version of the ancient chaos Scripture. It recorded many supernormal abilities and contained many types of laws.</p><p>One of the palm techniques contained nine types of nomological laws. It was an evolved version of the chaos Divine palm.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had only cultivated four of the nine types of laws. Over the years, Lu Ming had made improvements to them by integrating the death law and other laws into them. It had become Lu Ming’s unique divine power, and its power was even more shocking.</p><p>Lu Ming was casting this kind of divine power.</p><p>Boom ~!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm and LAN Mo’s fist collided with a deafening boom. A terrifying force shot out in all directions from the collision of their palms and fists. It hit the light shield but was blocked.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Their bodies trembled and they both took a dozen steps back. The ground they stepped on exploded.</p><p>What?</p><p>Everyone’s eyes widened in shock.</p><p>In the first move, Lu Ming managed to block the blue membrane’s attack. The two of them were evenly matched.</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>LAN mo hasn’t used his full strength yet. He’s just testing the waters!</p><p>A great emperor spoke. A great emperor was actually forced back by a true Emperor. This was extremely embarrassing. Even the other great emperors felt ashamed.</p><p>Within the light barrier, the blue membrane was furious.</p><p>He had actually been forced back by a true Emperor. A great emperor being forced back by a true Emperor had never happened before.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ve successfully angered me. Kill!”</p><p>LAN mo roared and pounced toward Lu Ming like a cannonball. He kept punching with both fists. Before his fists even reached Lu Ming, a terrifying pressure was already pressing down on him.</p><p>That was the pressure of the great Dao!</p><p>Great emperors could control great DAOs and borrow the power of great DAOs to become shockingly powerful.</p><p>The great Dao was a profound meaning that was even stronger than laws. It was extremely powerful.</p><p>Lu Ming was not afraid at all. He waved his palm to meet the attack. This time, there was one more law in Lu Ming’s palm. There were seven types of laws.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The two of them clashed continuously, and in the blink of an eye, they had exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>It was still difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>“The power of a great Dao is indeed amazing!”</p><p>In the middle of the battle, Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current divine power contained seven types of laws. However, under the bombardment of the other party’s great Dao, it was in imminent danger. It felt as if it was going to be penetrated and torn apart.</p><p>If not for the fact that Lu Ming’s physical strength was extremely strong and made up for this deficiency, he might not be able to fight against the other party.</p><p>The two of them fought with speed, constantly colliding with each other. The terrifying force bombarded the light shield, causing it to shake violently.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>LAN mo roared angrily. He had made so many moves but he could not take down Lu Ming. He felt that he had lost face.</p><p>If he could not defeat Lu Ming today, he would definitely become a laughingstock among the great emperors. On the contrary, he had helped Lu Ming achieve his goal and raised his reputation.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Suddenly, LAN Mo’s body let out a deafening roar, and a giant lion appeared above his head.</p><p>This was a Golden Lion with golden fur that shone with life. It was extraordinarily majestic.</p><p>This wasn’t a real Lion, but a Divine Art formed from the great Dao.</p><p>This Lion was covered by the blue membrane, and the blue membrane was in the center of the lion, as if it had transformed into a Golden Lion.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Golden Lion roared and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>“You’ve finally used your ultimate move?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. At this moment, nine different radiances emanated from Lu Ming’s palm.</p><p>He used all nine types of laws.</p><p>The power of this divine power Technique was not any weaker than the infinite Dragon Spear. It was most suitable for close combat.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure also rushed out. He struck out with his palm and the void was shattered, revealing a dark void.</p><p>His palm seemed to pass through space and struck out.</p><p>As for LAN mo, he waved a lion’s claw and clawed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The two of them collided once again. This time, the boom was even more intense, and a terrifying force was triggered.</p><p>However, the result was that the two of them were still evenly matched, and they were forced to retreat.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>LAN mo roared in disbelief.</p><p>He had already used all his strength, but he could not take down Lu Ming. He was shocked.</p><p>He roared in anger and charged at Lu Ming. The two of them fought fiercely.</p><p>The people watching the battle outside the light barrier were equally stunned and shocked.</p><p>Oh my God, Lu Ming can actually fight against LAN mo and not be at a disadvantage at all!</p><p>“This is too terrifying. He’s only a true Emperor, but he’s this strong. How is this possible? What’s going on?”</p><p>“He’s also a true Emperor, but the other true emperors can’t even withstand a single blow from him!”</p><p>Many people couldn’t believe it. A true Emperor couldn’t be a match for a great emperor. This was the truth. But now, the truth had been broken.</p><p>As a true Emperor, Lu Ming’s cultivation base was no weaker than a great Emperor’s.</p><p>Abnormal. As expected, he was an abnormal being who had become a saint Emperor with many laws. He could not be measured with common sense.</p><p>In the end, everyone could only comfort themselves like this..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
