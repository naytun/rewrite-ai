He could only retreat. His life was the most important.</p><p>“It’s too late to leave now!”</p><p>A cold voice was heard. Then, a bolt of lightning flashed, and a figure appeared behind the nine demon Celestial Emperor.</p><p>This figure was covered in lightning. It was Lei Yi.</p><p>The nine demon celestial emperors ‘figures stopped in an instant, and their faces were extremely ugly.</p><p>Not only did Earth One follow Lu Ming, but also Thunder one. There were two celestial emperors in total.</p><p>With two heavenly emperors surrounding him, he was in danger.</p><p>The Galaxy was in despair.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what happened today was a misunderstanding. How about I apologize to you in public another day?”</p><p>The nine demon celestial emperors revealed a flattering smile.</p><p>“Misunderstanding? Hehe, kill him!”</p><p>Lu Ming spoke calmly and gave the order.</p><p>He would not give the nine demon celestial emperors any chance. The nine demon celestial emperors must die!</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lei Yi let out a long roar, and his body was filled with endless thunder and lightning. He directly struck out a palm toward the nine demon celestial emperors.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s see who’s the one who’s dead.”</p><p>The nine demon Celestial Emperor’s eyes were ferocious. He brought the star</p><p>River and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Earth One stepped out and punched at the nine demon Celestial Emperor.</p><p>But at this moment, the nine demon Celestial Emperor waved his hand and actually threw the eternal Star River towards Earth One.</p><p>“Master…”</p><p>The Galaxy let out a desperate cry.</p><p>rest in peace. Your master will take revenge for you…</p><p>The nine demon Celestial Emperor’s cold voice rang in Xing Chen’s ears.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Xing Chen let out an unwilling scream. His body was turned into dust by Earth one’s terrifying fist force. He had no power to resist.</p><p>The nine demon celestial emperors took the opportunity to dash toward Lu Ming in a flash.</p><p>He wanted to capture Lu Ming and use him as a hostage to escape. He wanted to obtain all the resources from Lu Ming, such as the indestructible ancient scroll.</p><p>“You’ re looking for death!”</p><p>Earth One roared, and a meteor hammer appeared in his hand. With a wave, the meteor hammer was like a shooting star, blasting towards the nine demon Celestial Emperor at an unbelievable speed. It also emitted a terrifying heavenly Dao pressure.</p><p>The nine demon Celestial Emperor’s pupils contracted sharply, and he let out a desperate roar. “Heaven Dao soldiers…”</p><p>This meteor hammer was naturally the heavenly Dao soldier that Lu Ming had given to Earth One.</p><p>The speed of the meteor hammer was unbelievably fast. It caught up with the nine demon Celestial Emperor in an instant. He did not have time to attack Lu Ming and could only turn around to defend himself.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>A long sword appeared in the hands of the nine demon celestial emperors. In an instant, he stabbed out hundreds of times. Hundreds of sword lights converged into one sword and blasted toward the meteor hammer.</p><p>However, it was useless. He couldn’t block it at all.</p><p>Earth one’s strength was stronger than the nine demon celestial emperors to begin with. With the addition of the heaven Dao soldier, his strength skyrocketed, and his combat power was far above the nine demon celestial emperors.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a violent boom, the meteor hammer crushed the nine demon celestial emperors ‘sword light with unstoppable momentum and blasted toward them.</p><p>At the critical moment, the nine demon celestial emperors could only block with his sword.</p><p>However, when the meteoric hammer collided with the combat sword, the topnotch Emperor-level weapon exploded. The terrifying power struck the nine demon celestial emperors heavily.</p><p>arghh! the nine demon Celestial Emperor screamed as his body was sent flying. His body was split into two. Although he wasn’t dead yet, he was severely injured. His aura was weak, and his face was pale.</p><p>After being struck by the heaven Dao soldiers, the nine demon celestial emperors ‘strength was reduced to less than 10%.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Lu Ming, I surrender. Don’t kill me. I’ll acknowledge you as my master and follow your orders!”</p><p>The nine demon celestial emperors roared in horror.</p><p>He was truly afraid now. Against tu Yi who was controlling the heaven Dao soldier, he had no chance and would definitely be killed.</p><p>This was the first time in countless years that he had felt such fear.</p><p>“I’m not interested, kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Earth One roared ferociously, and the meteoric hammer blasted toward the nine demon celestial emperors again.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ll die a terrible death… Ah…”</p><p>run! Celestial Emperor Jiu mo roared hysterically. He used all his means to escape, but it was useless. Under the attacks of the heaven Dao soldiers, all his means were useless.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The nine demon celestial emperors ‘bodies exploded in the air, and their souls were also annihilated by the heaven Dao soldiers’ attacks.</p><p>The nine demon celestial emperors, a heavenly Emperor-level figure, had died just like that.</p><p>At that moment, the crowd was already numb. They could not make a sound and were completely stunned as they looked at Lu Ming in a daze.</p><p>The celestial Thearch was dead. A celestial Thearch was killed by Lu Ming’s subordinates.</p><p>This scene, this image, was too impactful, too shocking.</p><p>The celestial Thearch was a legendary figure in the primordial realm. He was Supreme and would never face any heavenly tribulations. He had an endless lifespan, as long as heaven and earth, and his combat power was boundless.</p><p>It was extremely difficult to even meet such a figure. However, one of them had fallen in front of them.</p><p>Moreover, it was all because of a young man.</p><p>“Young master, that guy’s storage ring!”</p><p>Earth One flew back and handed Lu Ming a storage ring, which was left behind by the nine demon Celestial Emperor.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and kept the storage ring.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming opened his mouth and was about to leave.</p><p>“Young hero Lu Ming, please wait!”</p><p>At this moment, a voice was heard. Lu Ming was slightly stunned. He stopped in his tracks and turned around.</p><p>Five to six figures walked over. Lu Ming recognized two of them. They were the eastern snow region and Xuan Lin.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Does your Xuan family still want to find trouble with me?</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>Xuan Lin, Dongfang Xue Yu, and a few of the elders of the Xuan family shivered. A wrinkled elder had a smile on his face as he cupped his fists, ” “Brother Lu Ming, you must be joking. How would we dare to fight with you? we are here to apologize to you!”</p><p>“Xuan Lin, Dongfang Xueyu, why don’t you come forward and apologize to little brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>In the end, the old man’s cold eyes turned to Xuan Lin and Dongfang Xue Yu.</p><p>They were almost scared to death when they saw the MU family being annihilated and even a celestial Thearch being killed. They were afraid that Lu Ming would attack the Xuan family because of Xuan Lin and the Xuan family would be annihilated.</p><p>Therefore, when he saw that Lu Ming was about to leave, he quickly came out and apologized to Lu Ming.</p><p>Xuan Lin and Dongfang Xue Yu stepped forward with pale faces. Cupping their fists, they bowed and said, ” we were blind before and offended you. Please forgive us and not lower yourself to our level!</p><p>Lu Ming was noncommittal. He waved his hand casually and left without saying a word.</p><p>Qiu Yue, bubbles, dandan, tu Yi, and Lei Yi followed Lu Ming and disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Xuan Lin, Dongfang Xue Yu, and the rest of the Xuan family were panting uneasily. They did not understand what Lu Ming meant. After a while, they went back in a daze. The entire Xuan family was filled with uneasiness, afraid that Lu Ming would come to them.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
