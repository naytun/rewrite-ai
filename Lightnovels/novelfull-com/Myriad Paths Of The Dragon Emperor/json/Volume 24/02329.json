Take Me To Your Mother!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Then, the group left Blue Moon City. Hundreds of thousands of miles away, Lu Ming, Long Chen, Earth One, gold one, the eternal universe heavenly Emperor, and the others bade farewell and headed in a certain direction with Lu shenhuang.</p><p>Along the way, the father and son talked a lot. Lu Ming also found out that Xie nianqing had come to the Tai Qing heavenly region more than ten years ago. All these years, he had been cultivating in the Tai Qing heavenly region and had even taught Lu shenhuang how to cultivate.</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly amazed.</p><p>In just a dozen years, Xie nianqing was able to bring Lu shenhuang’s cultivation to the three-star illusionary Emperor stage. His combat strength was even more shocking.</p><p>Lu shenhuang’s talent was undeniably shocking, but it had a lot to do with Xie nianqing’s method of teaching.</p><p>divine wilderness, has there been anything unusual about your mother all these years?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“There are!”</p><p>Lu shenhuang nodded his head and his face turned serious,” in mother’s body, there seem to be two people who sometimes love me dearly, and sometimes treat me coldly. But they have one thing in common, and that is that they will seriously teach me how to cultivate!</p><p>“Like this?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered, his heart heavy.</p><p>He recalled the time in the land of infinite demons. Wasn’t Xie nianqing the same? the day before, they were fine. But after that, he wanted to kill him. It seemed like a different person.</p><p>Until now, Lu Ming still did not know what was going on.</p><p>This was exactly what Lu shenhuang had said.</p><p>The two of them chatted as they traveled.</p><p>This was the first time the father and son had met. At first, they were a little distant, but as they chatted, they felt that their relationship had become closer.</p><p>Their speed was very fast, and after a few days, they arrived at a mountain range. On the peak of the highest mountain, there was a Lake.</p><p>The lake was like a mirror, adorning the peak of the mountain, making this place look like a peach forest.</p><p>There was a figure standing by the lake, wearing a black dress.</p><p>Her long black hair reached her waist and fluttered in the wind, making her look like a goddess who had descended to the mortal world.</p><p>Little Qing!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled and a sense of joy welled up in his heart.</p><p>That figure was definitely Xie nianqing. Lu Ming would not mistake him for someone else. Even if it was just his back, Lu Ming would not forget it.</p><p>It had been more than ten years. It had been more than ten years since they had parted ways in the land of myriad demons.</p><p>“Mother!”</p><p>Lu shenhuang shouted and flew towards Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Divine wilderness, you are back. Did you gain anything from this trip? What kind of heaven’s favorite did I encounter …”</p><p>Xie nianqing said in a clear voice before turning around.</p><p>She looked exactly the same as before. After not seeing her for more than ten years, Xie nianqing’s face had not changed at all.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Xie nianqing in a daze.</p><p>When Xie nianqing turned around, he saw Lu Ming.</p><p>Her words came to an abrupt end and she looked at Lu Ming in a daze.</p><p>“Lu … Lu Ming …”</p><p>Xie nianqing muttered in disbelief. She could not believe that she would meet Lu Ming here. Furthermore, Lu Ming came with Lu shenhuang. This was beyond her expectations.</p><p>“Mother, look who I’ve brought!”</p><p>Lu shenhuang flew over.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Xie nianqing murmured. Tears welled up in her eyes as she missed Lu Ming dearly. Then, she stepped into the air and flew toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming also flew over.</p><p>However, when Xie nianqing was halfway through her flight, her delicate body trembled. At that moment, her gaze changed. It became as cold as a knife. When she looked at Lu Ming, she was filled with murderous intent.</p><p>“Lowly ant, die!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s voice was as cold as a knife. A jet-black sword light slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed drastically. Xie nianqing’s move was a fatal threat to him.</p><p>He felt that if he was hit by this move, he would definitely die.</p><p>Retreat!</p><p>Lu Ming retreated rapidly!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming burst out with all his strength and retreated like a bolt of lightning. However, the jet-black sword light was like a bone-piercing awl, following closely behind Lu Ming at a speed faster than his.</p><p>Block!</p><p>A long spear was condensed in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>This long spear was formed by nine types of laws. It was Lu Ming’s most powerful abhijna, the infinite Dragon Spear.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming’s physical strength and world Energy burst out.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The long spear trembled. At this moment, Lu Ming stabbed out hundreds of times in a row. Hundreds of spear gleams stabbed at the jet-black sword gleam.</p><p>This could be said to be Lu Ming’s most powerful combat ability at the moment.</p><p>No true Emperor could block this move.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>A few hundred spear radiances struck the black sword radiance in succession, causing continuous explosions.</p><p>However, the jet-black sword gleam was extremely sharp. Lu Ming’s spear gleam exploded inch by inch and was swept away.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Although Lu Ming resisted with all his might and retreated rapidly at the same time, there was still a sharp gleam that swept past him.</p><p>Even though Lu Ming had activated the imperishable golden body and his physical defense, he could not withstand the attack. His body was almost cut in half and a deep wound appeared. Even his bone armor was broken.</p><p>Lu Ming spat out a mouthful of blood, his eyes filled with shock.</p><p>Great emperor!</p><p>He could clearly sense that Xie nianqing’s cultivation had already reached the great emperor realm.</p><p>This speed was too fast.</p><p>One must know that Lu Ming’s cultivation speed was already astonishingly fast. It could be said that he was advancing at a tremendous pace.</p><p>However, Xie nianqing’s speed of improvement was even faster than his.</p><p>He had already entered the great emperor realm. Coupled with that terrifying power, Lu Ming was no match for him at all. The difference was too great.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Xie nianqing was surprised to see that his attack did not kill Lu Ming. He shouted and charged at Lu Ming again.</p><p>“Mother, don’t, don’t!”</p><p>At this moment, shenhuang Lu shouted and rushed over in a panic.</p><p>Hearing Lu shenhuang’s voice, Xie nianqing’s body trembled and she stopped her pursuit. Her eyes were filled with struggle.</p><p>“Mother, don’t kill father. Don’t!”</p><p>Lu shenhuang shouted as he rushed forward and stood in front of Xie nianqing.</p><p>Lu Ming seized the opportunity to circulate the indestructible ancient scroll with all his might and focus on recovering from his injuries.</p><p>His wounds were recovering at an astonishing speed.</p><p>“Little Qing, wake up, it’s me!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>“Mother, it’s father!”</p><p>Lu shenhuang also shouted.</p><p>The struggle in Xie nianqing’s eyes grew stronger and stronger. Finally, he shouted,” “Lu Ming, leave quickly. Leave quickly!”</p><p>With that, Xie nianqing turned around and disappeared in a flash of light.</p><p>“Little Qing!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and chased after him at top speed. However, Xie nianqing was too fast. He was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>“Damn it, what’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming roared angrily.</p><p>He really could not figure it out.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s condition didn’t seem like he had been possessed. When they first met, it was indeed Xie nianqing. However, it was as if he had become a different person.</p><p>Lu shenhuang was also at a loss. He did not expect that the meeting between his parents would end up like this..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
