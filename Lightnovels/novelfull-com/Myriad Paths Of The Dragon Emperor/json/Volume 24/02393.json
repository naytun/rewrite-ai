Today, you must pay the price!”</p><p>Mu clan Emperor roared.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, more than twenty great emperors of the MU family attacked at the same time. There were one-star great emperors and five-star great emperors. When they attacked together, the void collapsed instantly, and terrifying attacks were launched toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was far beyond their imagination. They were terrified. They wanted to kill Lu Ming in an instant and make him disappear without a trace.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s muscles vibrated suddenly, vibrating billions of times in an instant. The void shattered and Lu Ming’s figure burst out.</p><p>The moment Lu Ming charged out, he used the six-feathered divine wings to increase his speed. In an instant, he dodged the joint attack of his opponents and rushed toward the twenty-odd great emperors of the MU family.</p><p>“Gather, gather!”</p><p>The master of the MU family roared. More than twenty great emperors of the MU family gathered together in a circle. This way, they could prevent Lu Ming from breaking them one by one.</p><p>“Is there any use in joining hands?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold voice was heard and a long spear appeared in his hand again. However, this long spear was not condensed by Lu Ming’s law. It was a real long spear.</p><p>Great desolation spear!</p><p>Heaven Dao soldiers!</p><p>Although Lu Ming could not unleash the power of the heaven’s path in the heaven Dao soldier, the great desolation Spear’s material was sturdy and immortal. It allowed Lu Ming to unleash all his strength and also increased his combat strength.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming held the great desolation spear and unleashed his power to the extreme, sweeping the spear out.</p><p>The sky exploded continuously as the great desolation spear swept up endless void storms and blasted towards the 20-odd great emperors of the MU clan.</p><p>It was so powerful that it looked like it was going to crush all the great emperors of the MU clan.</p><p>“Let’s join hands!”</p><p>The master of the MU family roared. All the emperors of the MU family joined forces and launched attacks at Lu Ming.</p><p>Among the more than twenty great emperors of the MU family, there were quite a few five star great emperors with astonishing strength.</p><p>With so many people working together, they could definitely fight against a six-star great emperor.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Their attacks collided with Lu Ming’s long spear, resulting in a terrifying boom and a shockwave that swept in all directions.</p><p>“Retreat, retreat!”</p><p>the spectators all retreated in a frenzy to create enough distance.</p><p>Most of the people who were watching the battle did not have the cultivation of a great emperor. They did not dare to get too close. Otherwise, if they were swept up by Lu Ming and the others, they would only be dead.</p><p>After the boom, Lu Ming’s body trembled and he retreated.</p><p>However, the more than 20 powerhouses of the MU family were also forced to retreat. Those with weaker cultivations even trembled and spat out blood. They were severely injured.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current combat strength, physical body, World Energy, law energy, and the great desolation spear were enough to compete with a six-star great ’ emperor.</p><p>How could those one-star and two-star great emperors withstand a head-on collision?</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a few steps back and stomped on the void to stabilize his body. He held the great desolation spear and once again charged at the MU clan Emperor. BOOM!</p><p>This time, Lu Ming held the great desolation spear with both hands and smashed it down with the force of Mount Tai.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The great desolation spear rapidly grew in size and became as heavy as a mountain, as if it could crush everything.</p><p>More than 20 great emperors from the MU family roared and used their strongest power to attack the great desolation spear.</p><p>The attacks from both sides collided once again.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The great desolation spear trembled continuously before it was sent flying.</p><p>However, the people of the MU family were in an even worse state. A few one star great emperors were shaken, and their bodies were cracked by the terrifying backlash. They were covered in blood, and their auras were weak. They no longer had the strength to fight.</p><p>“You guys recuperate first!”</p><p>The head of the MU family roared.</p><p>However, at this moment, Lu Ming’s third move arrived.</p><p>The MU family’s two-star great emperor was also shaken by this collision, and he was almost killed.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>Lu Ming was like a Martial Emperor God of War, his attacks were like a storm.</p><p>The number of Mu family’s great emperors decreased and they were no match for Lu Ming. In the end, they were at a disadvantage every time they clashed.</p><p>In the end, even three and four star great sovereigns started to get injured, and five star great sovereigns “faces were pale and they were gasping for breath.</p><p>The hearts of the people watching the battle were in a state of shock.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was too strong. He completely suppressed the MU family.</p><p>Was the MU clan going to be destroyed today?</p><p>In the depths of the MU family, the emperors from the Heng family, the he family, and the Tian Luo family were even paler. Their eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>It was hard to believe that Lu Ming’s combat strength had reached such a level. With his current combat strength, he could kill them in a second with one move.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>They roared in their hearts, unable to accept this fact.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming kept attacking, and his attacks became more and more violent. In the end, even the MU clan’s five star great emperor was injured. He was no match for Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s attack changed. He bypassed the five stars great emperor and shook the great desolation spear. In an instant, he shot out dozens of spear lights.</p><p>His target was the low-ranked great emperors.</p><p>“Not good, he blocked it!”</p><p>The advanced emperors of the MU family were shocked. They used all their strength to block Lu Ming’s attack.</p><p>But no matter how hard they tried, they only managed to block half of the spear light. The rest of the spear light continued toward the low-tier emperors.</p><p>The low level great emperors, especially the one and two star great emperors, tried their best to resist, but it was to no avail.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>The one-star and two-star great emperors ‘foreheads were pierced through by the spear light, and their souls were destroyed.</p><p>He was dead!</p><p>The one-star and two-star great emperors of the MU family were all killed in an instant, and eight of them were dead.</p><p>The eight great emperors were annihilated in an instant.</p><p>This shocked everyone, but at the same time, it also made the MU clan furious and filled them with killing intent.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I want you to die without a burial ground!”</p><p>The MU family’s head roared. His eyes were blood red, and his face was ferocious.</p><p>Eight great sovereigns, what a great loss this was, his heart was bleeding.</p><p>The MU family had been around for countless years, and they had only managed to accumulate so many great emperors over time.</p><p>But now, eight of them had died.</p><p>This was a loss that was hard to bear.</p><p>“Now you know how painful it is. If you had known this would happen, you wouldn’t have thought of this day when the MU family wanted to kill me. At this moment, it’s impossible that you’re the only ones killing others in this world, and others won’t come to kill you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He did not have the slightest bit of pity or sympathy.</p><p>He and the MU family were mortal enemies. Either he died or he died!</p><p>One side had to be destroyed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
