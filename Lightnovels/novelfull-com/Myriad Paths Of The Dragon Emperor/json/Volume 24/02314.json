He also defeated an opponent.</p><p>This made some of the heaven realm’s elites ‘faces turn ugly.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Another figure rushed up the fighting ring.</p><p>“Yuan Xin!”</p><p>Many people’s gazes moved, especially those who knew the inside story. In the primordial realm, Yuan Xin was the top genius, ranked third.</p><p>Over the years, as the primordial realm’s prodigies continued to grow, their influence in the heaven realm also grew.</p><p>Lu Ming had become a saint Emperor with many laws. This was unprecedented and shook the heaven realm.</p><p>As for Tianming, bubbles, and the others, their strength increased rapidly and their fame grew among the younger generation in the heaven realm.</p><p>Naturally, there were more people who went to understand the geniuses of the primordial realm. The battle results of the ten lands battle back then were also exposed, and many people knew about it.</p><p>Yuan Xin was ranked third in the primordial realm back then, second only to Lu Ming and Tianming. His talent was absolutely shocking, and even in the heaven realm, he was the top.</p><p>Some people even thought that he might be able to stand shoulder to shoulder with the nine-Jue in the future.</p><p>Who was he going to challenge now?</p><p>Yuan Xin’s eyes fell on Tian Ming.</p><p>“Tianming, come out and fight!”</p><p>Yuan Xin’s voice rang out.</p><p>Many people were surprised.</p><p>Many people thought that Yuan Xin would also challenge the heaven realm’s proud sons of heaven. They didn’t expect that he would challenge Tianming. that year, in the battle of the ten lands of the yuan continent, Yuan Xin was defeated by Tianming. He must want to challenge and defeat him!</p><p>“Indeed!”</p><p>Many people nodded.</p><p>Tianming, dressed in white, was elegant and handsome, attracting the attention of many young women.</p><p>He stood up, took a step forward, and landed on the fighting ring.</p><p>yuanxin, you weren’t my match back then, and now, you’re even less of a match for me!</p><p>Tianming said indifferently. He was full of confidence in himself.</p><p>don’t be too full of yourself. Today, I will defeat you and prove that I’m stronger than you. It’s a pity that Lu Ming is dead. Otherwise, I would also defeat him and prove to everyone who is the number one in the primordial realm!</p><p>Yuan Xin said, her eyes shining with a strong desire to fight.</p><p>His ambition was higher than the sky, but he could only get third place in the battle of the ten lands back then. He was unwilling to give up, and he wanted to take back his throne as the number one in the primordial realm.</p><p>“Make your move!”</p><p>Tianming said indifferently. His face was calm and indifferent, as if he didn’t take Yuan Xin’s words to heart.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Yuan Xin burst out with a powerful aura. It was much stronger than when he fought Lu Ming in yaoguang ancient city.</p><p>There were four different types of laws on his body, and they rushed toward Tianming. With the chaos laws as the leader, the four different types of laws formed a terrifying super power.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Yuan Xin threw a punch, and mountains of chaos pressed down on Tianming.</p><p>A dazzling white light spread out from Tianming’s body. He pointed out a finger, and a bright light burst out, blasting toward those mountains.</p><p>BOOM! boom! BOOM!</p><p>The mountain created by Tianming fell apart and exploded.</p><p>“Defeat!”</p><p>Then, Tianming suddenly took a step forward and pressed down with his finger.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying pressure pressed down on Yuan Xin. At the same time, a bright light spread toward Yuan Xin like a stormy sea.</p><p>This was also a terrifying divine ability. With the laws of fate as the main source and the addition of other laws, the power was astonishing.</p><p>die! Yuan Xin roared as he unleashed all his strength and attacked madly.</p><p>However, his attacks were constantly being shattered and disintegrated by the light emitted by the Heaven’s Will finger.</p><p>In the end, those rays of light hit Yuan Xin.</p><p>Yuan Xin’s body trembled violently, and she spat out a large mouthful of blood as she was sent flying out of the battle platform.</p><p>The entire venue fell silent!</p><p>Many people looked at Tian Ming in shock, especially the proud Children of Heaven from the primordial realm. They were the most surprised.</p><p>Tianming’s strength was too terrifying!</p><p>He had actually defeated Yuan Xin in just a few moves.</p><p>Back then, during the battle of the primordial realm’s ten lands, Tianming had to use many moves to defeat Yuan Xin. He had even used his ultimate move to defeat Yuan Xin.</p><p>But now, he had easily defeated Yuan Xin. Obviously, Tianming’s improvement speed had far surpassed Yuan Xin’s.</p><p>“No, that’s impossible!”</p><p>Standing in the air, Yuan Xin was at a loss, clearly unable to accept all this.</p><p>This time, he had wanted to defeat Tianming and prove to everyone that he was the number one in the primordial realm. However, the final result was that he had suffered a crushing defeat. Furthermore, it had only been a few moves, and he had lost miserably.</p><p>His strength was far from Tianming’s.</p><p>“Yuanxin, you’re too weak!”</p><p>Tianming said indifferently. His words caused Yuan Xin to spit out another mouthful of blood, and her body swayed.</p><p>Then, Tianming stopped looking at him and looked at the other Young heaven’s favorites.</p><p>When Tianming’s gaze swept over them, except for Jiu Jue, the other young men’s faces all changed.</p><p>From the attack just now, Tianming’s strength was simply unfathomable. No one knew what level he had reached.</p><p>Who would he challenge next?</p><p>In the end, the heavenly General’s eyes fell on one of the young men!</p><p>Ou Yeming!</p><p>He had always been known as the strongest void Emperor among the younger generation of the heaven realm!</p><p>Of course, ever since Lu Ming rose to power, he was no longer the strongest void Emperor. Back then, when Lu Ming became a void Emperor, he defeated him with a single spear.</p><p>Was Tianming going to challenge ou Yibing?</p><p>“Ou yabing, come out and fight!”</p><p>As expected, Tianming’s voice sounded.</p><p>“You’re overestimating yourself!”</p><p>Ou yabing said coldly. He took a step forward and appeared on the fighting ring.</p><p>A sharp light flashed in his eyes.</p><p>Back then, he had suffered a crushing defeat at Lu Ming’s hands, and his reputation had been greatly reduced. Therefore, he did not have a good impression of the prodigies from the primordial realm, who were the same as Lu Ming.</p><p>Now, Tianming actually wanted to challenge him again. He would give Tianming an unforgettable lesson.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Tianming took a step forward, and his body burst out with a shocking light.</p><p>Following that, he pointed out with his finger. A dazzling light shot towards ou Yeming.</p><p>“Divine weapon seal technique!”</p><p>heaven’s will! ou yabing shouted as he quickly formed a seal with his hands. A giant tower was formed and pressed down on Tian Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The giant tower and the light from the Heaven’s Will finger clashed together, creating a shocking explosion. After that, the giant tower formed by ou yabing started to shake crazily. It emitted a cracking sound and was covered in cracks.</p><p>Ou yabing’s expression changed. His hands quickly formed a seal, and a vase appeared. From the mouth of the vase, a large amount of sword Qi was spat out.</p><p>Then, another saber appeared and slashed toward Tianming.</p><p>“The river of fate!”</p><p>At this moment, Tianming used his ultimate move, the river of fate. He stood in the river of fate as if he was immortal and could control fate.</p><p>Tianming’s move was much stronger than before!</p><p>Back then, it had only been a single law of fate, but now, other laws had been added in, and its power was astonishing.</p><p>BOOM! boom! boom!</p><p>Tian Ming and ou yabing were engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>The two of them each used their own techniques and ultimate moves, constantly clashing. On the fighting stage, all kinds of weapons flew around and all kinds of light burst forth..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
