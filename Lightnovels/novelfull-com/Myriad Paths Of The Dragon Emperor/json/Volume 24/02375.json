It was like a heavenly River, but also like a battle sword.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The evil god tribe’s royal member’s body glowed with a dazzling purple light as a combat sword appeared in his hand.</p><p>The evil god tribe usually used battle axes, giant hammers, maces, and iron rods. They rarely used swords.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sword howls did not stop. The Royal member of the evil god tribe slashed out twice at the same time, and two purple sword gleams slashed toward Lu Ming and dandan respectively.</p><p>A purple sword light collided with the long river that dandan spurted out. There was a loud bang and the two disappeared.</p><p>However, dandan’s figure was already close to her opponent and she struck out a palm.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he did not take the other party’s sword gleam head on.</p><p>A head-on confrontation would consume a lot of energy. Lu Ming had to try his best to conserve his energy.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he dodged the sword light. Then, he charged at the other party.</p><p>At this moment, dandan and the two members of the evil god tribe’s royal tribe had already exchanged their second blow.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This time, it was a head-on collision. The two of them trembled and retreated.</p><p>However, the Royal tribe of the evil god tribe had retreated even more. He was at a disadvantage.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>The Royal member of the evil god tribe was extremely shocked.</p><p>The Royal tribe of the evil god tribe was extremely powerful to begin with. In a battle of the same level, their strength far exceeded that of the other evil god tribes.</p><p>On the other hand, dandan was clearly only a six star great emperor and hadn’t even reached peak great emperor yet, but her battle-power was stronger than his, which shocked him.</p><p>“Die, you bastard!”</p><p>Dandan charged at the other party again, her killing intent extremely cold.</p><p>Dandan hated the evil god tribe to the core. In ancient times, he had been severely injured by the evil god tribe and had barely turned into an egg. He had only been reborn after meeting Lu Ming.</p><p>Therefore, he had to kill the evil god tribe whenever he saw them.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming had also arrived. With the two of them working together, the royal family of the evil god tribe was even more vulnerable.</p><p>Although he had used all his strength, he was still heavily injured and was frantically retreating.</p><p>“Quickly come and help me!”</p><p>The Royal member of the evil god tribe roared.</p><p>The Royal tribe had an extremely high status among the evil god tribe.</p><p>Even in such a situation where everyone wanted to take the heaven Dao soldier, there was still a peak great emperor who charged towards Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>“No one can save you!”</p><p>Dandan roared and launched a storm of attacks.</p><p>Lu Ming also launched a crazy attack.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The Royal member of the evil god tribe managed to block a few moves, but he was no match for Lu Ming in the end. One of his arms was cut off by Lu Ming’s sword.</p><p>The other party’s storage bracelet was worn on this arm. Lu Ming used the power of the world to roll up the arm and kept it.</p><p>“Ah, ah ah, bastard, damn it!”</p><p>The Royal member of the evil god race howled in rage. All of his treasures were in his storage bracelet, including the two heaven Dao soldiers.</p><p>No, it was three!</p><p>He had even borrowed one from the heavenly Emperor stage powerhouse of the evil god tribe, which he had used to kill the Azure Dragon.</p><p>His eyes were red, and his heart was bleeding. Unfortunately, he didn’t dare to stay and could only retreat frantically.</p><p>At this moment, the 19 heaven Dao soldiers had all been taken away.</p><p>Lu Ming and dandan had the greatest gains. They had obtained a total of six items.</p><p>At the scene, there were more than 20 more bodies.</p><p>A few of them, even peak great emperors, had fallen here.</p><p>The remaining people’s eyes flickered. Someone had his eyes on Lu Ming.</p><p>It was because Lu Ming and dandan had indeed gained a shocking harvest just now.</p><p>However, there were even more people who were staring at that formation spirit, their eyes flickering with thick greed.</p><p>How many treasures were in the bag in the formation Spirit’s hand?</p><p>A four-armed member of the evil god race had a greedy look in his eyes. His mind had been blinded by his greed, and he took the lead to attack the formation spirit.</p><p>“Hand over that bag!”</p><p>The four-armed evil god race member was also a peak Emperor, and his speed was extremely fast. At the same time, the four weapons in his four arms slashed toward the array spirit.</p><p>you actually want to attack me? interesting. Then I’ll send you on your way!</p><p>The formation spirit muttered. It then opened its small mouth and slightly spat.</p><p>It was as though a stream of air had been spat out from the mouth of the formation spirit. Then, a shocking scene happened. The four-armed evil god tribe member let out a blood-curdling screech as his body exploded and turned into dust, not leaving behind anything.</p><p>Everyone’s heart trembled violently. It was as if a basin of cold water had been poured on them, extinguishing the fire of their greed.</p><p>He killed a peak great emperor in one breath. What kind of strength was this?</p><p>he’s really courting death. This is the array spirit produced by the great array set up by a Supreme expert. If he can borrow the power of the great array here, even the heavenly Emperor will die, let alone him!</p><p>Dandan gloated at Lu Ming’s misfortune through voice transmission.</p><p>The other people’s expressions were unsightly, and they no longer dared to have any ideas about the formation spirit.</p><p>I have one last treasure left. I’ll give it to you!</p><p>The formation spirit spoke again, and then the bag toppled over, a ball of light flying out.</p><p>This time, there was only a ball of light that was extremely dazzling. It was ten times more dazzling than the light of the heaven Dao soldiers.</p><p>In the light was a token.</p><p>It looked very simple and seemed to be very ancient. However, it did not give off any aura and looked very ordinary.</p><p>However, everyone’s eyes were burning.</p><p>The formation spirit was the last one to take out the token. The light on the token was ten times brighter than the light on the heaven Dao soldiers.</p><p>According to his previous judgment, it seemed that the more precious a treasure was, the more dazzling the light would be.</p><p>Although he couldn’t tell what was so special about this token, it was definitely extremely precious.</p><p>At this moment, everyone moved and rushed towards the token.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>a terrifying battle instantly broke out, and the secret room shook.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Several six star great emperors were torn apart and died on the spot.</p><p>The remaining six star great emperors were scared, and they kept stepping back, not daring to interfere.</p><p>So many people were fighting for a token. The battle was too intense. All the peak great emperors were attacking madly. A six star great emperor would only die if he was caught in the battle.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming and dandan did not make a move.</p><p>They were preserving their strength, and it was obvious that if they attacked now, they would definitely face a tragic battle.</p><p>Although Lu Ming and dandan were powerful, they would definitely face the attacks of the other peak great emperors if they were to fight for the token.</p><p>The best strategy was to wait and see.</p><p>Of course, it wasn’t easy to do so in the face of such a treasure. Who could remain calm when faced with a treasure that was ten times more precious than a heaven Dao soldier? even the celestial Thearch would go crazy if he were here.</p><p>But dandan, this old monster who had lived for who knew how many years, had a strong heart and at this time, she forcefully endured it.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he was no ordinary person either. He had experienced too many things along the way and his heart was stronger than many old monsters who had lived for countless years. At this moment, he had to endure it.</p><p>At the same time, he also took out a large number of energy crystals to replenish the energy of Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body.</p><p>The celestial Thearch’s corporeal body had lost a large amount of energy in the battle just now, and it was a good time to replenish some..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
