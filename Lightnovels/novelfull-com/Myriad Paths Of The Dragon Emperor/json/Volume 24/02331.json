He could understand this.</p><p>It was just like how he had fused with some of the nine Dragons ‘memory fragments back then, but that didn’t affect him. It only meant that he had some more memories, but he was still himself and wouldn’t become another person.</p><p>It was the same for Xie nianqing. As long as Xie nianqing’s memories of this life prevailed and she devoured the memories of her previous life, she would only have some more memories. Not only would she be fine, but she would also obtain a great opportunity.</p><p>“What should I do to make little Qing’s memories of this life devour the memories of her previous life?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“It’s simple!”</p><p>Xie nianjun smiled slyly and said,” actually, you have the advantage now. You have a son, the son of Xie nianqing and you. With a son by her side, it can greatly affect Xie nianqing’s memory of this life. It will make her more obsessed and reluctant to let go. That’s why her memory of this life can’t be combined with her memory of her previous life!</p><p>from now on, as long as you can stay by Xie nianqing’s side and accompany her, her obsession will naturally become stronger. You can even get to know her more and sleep with her more. Her memories of this life will naturally take over and then devour the memories of her previous life!</p><p>“All?”</p><p>Lu Ming was somewhat dumbfounded.</p><p>Sleep with more?</p><p>It was that simple?</p><p>“How is it? Don’t you feel happy? the method I taught you was not bad, right?”</p><p>Xie nianjun smiled.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly.</p><p>the memories of her previous life make her hate me to death. I’m afraid she’ll kill me before I can even get close to her, let alone sleep with her!</p><p>Lu Ming touched his nose and said.</p><p>that’s why your cultivation is too weak. You should focus on your cultivation. As long as your cultivation surpasses Xie nianqing, you will be able to suppress her and subdue her. Then, you will be able to do whatever you want!</p><p>Xie nianjun smiled slyly.</p><p>Lu Ming was completely speechless. He felt immense pressure.</p><p>It was mainly because Xie nianqing’s cultivation speed was too fast. As the reincarnation of an expert of unknown strength, even if the memories of his past life and present life were not merged, his cultivation speed was still shocking. Now, he was already in the great emperor realm.</p><p>It was too difficult for Lu Ming to catch up or even surpass Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Is there no other way besides this?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked, unwilling to give up.</p><p>“No more!”</p><p>Xie nianjun shook his head.</p><p>“So you’re saying that it’s impossible for little Qing to recover in a short time?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>“Yes, I am!” Xie nianjun nodded.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed helplessly. In the end, his cultivation level was too weak.</p><p>“Why are you helping me?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously after a while.</p><p>it’s simple. Once Xie nianqing devours the memories of her previous life, her cultivation speed will definitely slow down. In the future, she will no longer be my match. Hehehe!</p><p>Xie nianjun chuckled as she spoke.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. It turned out that this was the reason.</p><p>With the memories of his past life taking over, Xie nianqing would become a terrifying expert. His cultivation speed would naturally be shocking.</p><p>However, the memory of this life devouring the memory of the previous life would only give him some more memories. Although it was also a Supreme opportunity, there would still be a huge gap.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming stayed behind and accompanied Lu shenhuang for a period of time. He gave Lu shenhuang some cultivation resources.</p><p>What Lu shenhuang cultivated was not the system of laws. It was the system that Xie nianqing cultivated. Lu Ming had never seen it before, but it was extremely exquisite and its power was shocking.</p><p>Lu Ming stayed for another month. However, Xie nianqing did not appear during this month.</p><p>Lu Ming was helpless. He left a month later.</p><p>Lu shenhuang did not leave with Lu Ming. He continued to stay by Xie nianqing’s side.</p><p>cultivation, I must speed up my cultivation and help little Qing’s memories of this life to devour her memories of her previous life!</p><p>On the way back, Lu Ming secretly swore.</p><p>He had thought that his cultivation speed was already very fast. He had even defeated Xuanyuan Yi and suppressed all the other geniuses to obtain first place. This made him feel like he was standing at the peak.</p><p>But now, he was under great pressure.</p><p>Because of Xie nianqing!</p><p>Xie nianqing’s cultivation speed was faster than his. It was easier said than done to catch up or even surpass Xie nianqing. This forced Lu Ming to keep moving forward.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming contacted Earth One and the rest.</p><p>Lu Ming brought Earth One and the rest, as well as the physical cultivators, back to two world city.</p><p>With the addition of these experts, two world city’s strength had increased greatly.</p><p>The news of the battle in Blue Moon City had spread throughout the Tai Qing heavenly region. Lu Ming’s reputation had reached its peak.</p><p>After defeating Xuanyuan Yi, there was no doubt that Lu Ming stood at the peak of the younger generation. Furthermore, the number of celestial thearchs standing behind Lu Ming was even more shocking.</p><p>There was no doubt that Lu Ming had a great influence in the heaven realm.</p><p>His influence was even greater than some of the celestial thearchs.</p><p>After Lu Ming returned to two world city, he devoted himself to cultivation.</p><p>Meanwhile, Long Chen, Huang Ling, and bubbles had also come to two world city to cultivate. Sometimes, they would go to the battlefields outside the city to train themselves.</p><p>In addition, people like Heng Xinghe, Yuan Xin, and Tian Ming, as well as the other heaven realm’s proud Children of Heaven, including Jiu Jue, were all cultivating desperately.</p><p>The battle at Blue Moon City had let them see Lu Ming’s combat strength. Lu Ming had given them unimaginable pressure and made them understand their own shortcomings, forcing all the paragons to cultivate with all their might.</p><p>In this great era where geniuses were as common as clouds, if one did not progress fast enough, they would be surpassed and crushed by others.</p><p>Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, five years had passed.</p><p>To some Emperor-ranked powerhouses, five years was merely a blink of an eye.</p><p>However, to prodigies like Lu Ming and the rest, five years was of great significance.</p><p>In the past five years, Lu Ming had made great progress in all aspects.</p><p>First of all, Lu Ming had already cultivated the seven Gods mysterious technique to the late-stage of the fourth realm.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming could defeat and even kill a rank-18 true Emperor powerhouse with only his physical strength.</p><p>This was just pure physical strength.</p><p>However, the drop of ancestral dragon blood at his heart had almost been consumed. There was only a little left.</p><p>Also, Lu Ming’s remaining laws had all reached the third realm.</p><p>Lu Ming’s nine types of laws had all reached the third realm.</p><p>Over the years, Lu Ming had refined all the one hundred chaos gems he had obtained from the LAN family. His cultivation had reached the peak of a six-star true Emperor and he was not far from becoming a seven-star true Emperor.</p><p>This was an improvement in all aspects. Lu Ming did not know how strong his combat strength was now. Anyway, he could kill a rank-18 true Emperor with a snap of his fingers.</p><p>“I wonder how my current strength is compared to a great emperor?”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>A great emperor was much, much stronger than a true Emperor.</p><p>A great emperor cultivated all nine types of nomological laws to the third realm, then used the nine types of nomological laws to develop a great Dao.</p><p>Great emperors could use the power of great DAOs. Their battle-power was far greater than a true Emperor’s. The difference was too great..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
