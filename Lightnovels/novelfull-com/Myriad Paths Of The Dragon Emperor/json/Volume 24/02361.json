With a punch, the purple radiance condensed into a Lion that pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>LAN Kang’s eyes were filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>At the scene, other than the LAN clan’s people, there were only Lu Ming and his group. He had already decided to kill Lu Ming on the spot, as well as Emperor formless and his group.</p><p>Since the people present were from the LAN family, no one would know that they were the ones who killed Lu Ming if they did not tell anyone. The celestial Thearch behind Lu Ming could only assume that Lu Ming had died while taking a risk or that he was killed by the evil god tribe.</p><p>In that case, not only could he obtain the fragment of the great Dao, but he could also kill Lu Ming. It was killing two birds with one stone.</p><p>LAN Kang’s eyes were filled with excitement.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming also made his move.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming did not retreat. Instead, he met the attack head-on and threw a punch at LAN Kang.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The sharpness in LAN Kang’s eyes became even stronger.</p><p>He had heard from LAN mo about Lu Ming’s strength. He was very strong and could defeat a two star great emperor.</p><p>However, according to his speculations, it was impossible for him to be a match for a three-star great emperor. After all, the gap between each star was extremely large.</p><p>If Lu Ming had chosen to retreat or dodge, he might have had to exert more effort. However, Lu Ming chose to fight him head-on. He was simply courting death.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two of them collided with a deafening boom. The place where their fists collided was filled with a dazzling light that made it hard for people to open their eyes.</p><p>Then, the two figures trembled as if they had been electrocuted and retreated.</p><p>Lu Ming and LAN Kang were equally matched in this move.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>LAN Kang was forced back five to six steps before he steadied himself. He roared in his heart and his eyes widened, revealing a look of disbelief.</p><p>With this move, he felt that Lu Ming’s power was as deep as the sea and unfathomable.</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>How could Lu Ming have such strong powers?</p><p>11 different colors of light of law, what was that? 11 laws?</p><p>LAN Kang’s heart was in turmoil!</p><p>As for the other members of the LAN family, they were extremely shocked, especially LAN mo, whose eyes almost popped out of their sockets.</p><p>“A three star great emperor is nothing more than this!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“I haven’t used my full strength yet, don’t be too proud!”</p><p>LAN Kang said coldly. His eyes were cold as he said to the other members of the LAN family,”You guys take down those three old fellows first. Leave Lu Ming to me!”</p><p>“Yes, leave these three old men to us!”</p><p>The other members of the LAN clan said before charging toward Emperor formless and the other two.</p><p>But as soon as he made his move, these people were shocked.</p><p>This was because the three emperors were all two star great emperors.</p><p>Three two star great emperors joining forces had an astonishing battle prowess, and they were focused on defense. The LAN family couldn’t take them down in a short time.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>LAN Kang bellowed and personally charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>He used all his strength and roared continuously.</p><p>Lu Ming was not afraid at all. He continued to fight with him. In the blink of an eye, they had exchanged more than ten moves, but it was still difficult to win.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current combat strength, he was no weaker than a three star great emperor in a head-on battle.</p><p>Just as the two sides were fighting intensely, a figure flashed. Someone else had arrived.</p><p>This time, more than twenty people had come, all of whom were creatures from the heaven realm.</p><p>Needless to say, everyone was shocked to see that Lu Ming could actually fight LAN Kang to a draw.</p><p>LAN Kang’s face was extremely gloomy.</p><p>Now that the other people from the heaven realm were here, he did not dare to kill Lu Ming openly.</p><p>“Everyone, let’s attack together! Lu Ming has obtained a large number of great Dao fragments!”</p><p>LAN Kang roared, wanting to get the others to attack together.</p><p>“What? A fragment of the great Dao!”</p><p>Many people’s eyes were burning as they looked at Lu Ming with greed.</p><p>The great Dao fragment was too tempting for great emperors.</p><p>whoever dares to attack me, if 1 don’t die, when I return to the Tai Qing heavenly region, I will bring people to visit your forces one by one!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>Many people felt a chill.</p><p>The strength behind Lu Ming was too shocking. There were more than a dozen people at the heavenly Emperor realm. No one could stand up to them.</p><p>If Lu Ming did not die, they would be the ones to die.</p><p>At the thought of this, although many people were burning with passion, they didn’t dare to make a move.</p><p>“LAN Kang, without anyone to help you, you will be the one to die today!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had completely erupted. He did not care about defense and used all his might to launch a storm of attacks.</p><p>In this way, Lu Ming was directly hit by LAN Kang. LAN Kang’s punch landed on Lu Ming’s chest, causing it to cave in.</p><p>However, Lu Ming seized the opportunity and punched LAN Kang’s shoulder.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The sound of bones breaking could be heard. LAN Kang’s shoulder exploded. He staggered backward, his face pale.</p><p>His defense could not be compared to Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a heavy step forward. He did not care about his injuries and continued to charge toward LAN Kang.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what do you want to do? You’re only at the true Emperor realm, so you don’t have any Dao fragments left. My cultivation has already reached the peak of three star great emperor. As long as you give me the Dao fragment, I’ll be able to break through to four star great emperor very soon!”</p><p>as long as I break through to the four star great emperor realm, our heaven realm will be able to annihilate the evil god tribe, seize the eight array discs, and leave this place. Otherwise, we might all die. You’re so selfish that you don’t care about the lives of others!</p><p>LAN Kang shouted, still trying to drag the others down with him.</p><p>Many people’s expressions changed.</p><p>Indeed, their number one opponent in this array was the evil god tribe.</p><p>LAN Kang’s cultivation base had indeed reached the peak of three star great emperor, and he was the one with the highest chance of breaking through in the heaven realm.</p><p>If he were to obtain the fragment of the great Dao, he might really be able to break through. If that were the case, they would have the confidence to defeat the evil god tribe.</p><p>Some people’s eyes flickered.</p><p>hehe, don’t think too highly of yourself. Even without you, 1’11 still exterminate the evil god race. Kill!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and attacked crazily.</p><p>After Lu Ming went all out, LAN Kang was at a complete disadvantage.</p><p>He was confident that he could hit Lu Ming, but the price was that he would be hit by Lu Ming too.</p><p>His vitality and defensive abilities were inferior to Lu Ming’s. He was at a great disadvantage in this way of fighting where both sides would suffer.</p><p>“Damn it!” LAN Kang bellowed in his heart. He could only give up the opportunity to hit Lu Ming and put all his effort into defense and dodging.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming took a heavy step forward. He changed his direction and no longer attacked LAN Kang. Instead, he attacked LAN mo and the rest.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>LAN Kang’s expression changed.</p><p>As for LAN mo and the rest, they did not expect Lu Ming to suddenly change his direction. They were shocked and wanted to Dodge but it was too late.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure appeared behind LAN mo in an instant. His palm was like a sharp sword and he stabbed it into LAN Mo’s dantian.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This palm directly penetrated LAN Mo’s dantian and tore apart his small world..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
