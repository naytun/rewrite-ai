Lu Ming turned around and saw a graceful figure in a long white dress. She looked almost the same as Xie nianqing, peerless in beauty.</p><p>“Thank you, nianjun!”</p><p>Lu Ming was at a loss for words. He had never expected that Xie nianjun would be nearby.</p><p>Back at Yuan mountain, Lu Ming had gone to the ancient sacred clan to look for Xie nianjun. His purpose was to find out about Xie nianqing. However, the people of the ancient sacred clan told him that Xie nianjun had left and no one knew where he was.</p><p>It turned out that Xie nianjun had also come to the heavenly realm.</p><p>“Aunt!”</p><p>Lu shenhuang let out a smile and flew over.</p><p>It was obvious that Lu shenhuang and Xie nianjun knew each other.</p><p>Xie nianjun flew in the air and stopped in front of Lu Ming. He sized him up curiously.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I haven’t seen you for many years. Your cultivation has improved a lot!”</p><p>Xie nianjun smiled.</p><p>“I can’t compare to you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. He sized up Xie nianjun and the surprise in his eyes intensified.</p><p>Unfathomable!</p><p>In his eyes, Xie nianjun was unfathomable. He had no idea what Xie nianjun’s current realm was.</p><p>However, he was definitely not a true Emperor, nor was he a true Emperor. He was definitely above a true Emperor.</p><p>Great emperor realm!</p><p>It was very likely that Xie nianjun’s cultivation was also at the great emperor realm.</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p><p>What was going on? How could Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun’s cultivation speed be so fast? Lu Ming had to go through countless hardships to reach his current cultivation level.</p><p>The other heaven realm heaven’s pride experts were even weaker. For example, Xuanyuan Yi only had the combat power of a level 15 true Emperor. However, he was the strongest after Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun, who were about the same age as Lu Ming and the rest, had already broken through to the great emperor realm.</p><p>If this were to spread out, it would probably scare people to death.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t you want to know why Xie nianqing is like this now?”</p><p>Xie nianjun smiled.</p><p>“You know?” Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“Of course 1 know. Let’s go to the side and talk. Little guy, don’t follow me!”</p><p>Xie nianjun said to Lu shenhuang before he walked towards the center of the lake. Lu Ming followed behind him.</p><p>The two of them came to the center of the lake and stood on the surface.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Xie nianjun, waiting for her answer.</p><p>“Do you know about your past and present life?”</p><p>Xie nianjun retorted.</p><p>“Past and present life?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>Xie nianjun did not answer. He only smiled at Lu Ming.</p><p>“You mean reincarnation, past life and present life?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“That’s right, reincarnation, past life and present life!”</p><p>Xie nianjun nodded.</p><p>“How is that possible? As far as 1 know, although the world has the law of reincarnation, no one can be reincarnated. Once you die, your body dies and your Dao vanishes, everything becomes nothing!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>At Lu Ming’s current cultivation level, he understood more. No one in the world could reincarnate. At most, one could possess a body.</p><p>Even a peak heavenly Emperor invincible powerhouse would not be able to reincarnate.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming had once asked the reincarnation Emperor about it, and the reincarnation Emperor had given him a similar answer.</p><p>they can’t be reincarnated because those people are too weak. As long as their cultivation realm is high enough, anything is possible!</p><p>Xie nianjun said with a hint of disdain.</p><p>Lu Ming was tongue-tied and did not know how to answer for a moment.</p><p>Too weak? a peak heavenly Emperor was too weak in Xie nianjun’s words?</p><p>A peak heavenly Emperor was already an unrivaled powerhouse in this world. According to Lu Ming’s knowledge, only the ancestral Dragon was above the heavenly Emperor.</p><p>Could it be that there was reincarnation above the heavenly Emperor?</p><p>“You’re saying that little Qing is the reincarnation of an expert, and her memories of her past life have been awakened?”</p><p>With Lu Ming’s intelligence, he immediately thought of many things.</p><p>that’s right. Xie nianqing is indeed the reincarnation of a powerful figure. Moreover, the memories of her previous life have been awakened. That’s why when you see Xie nianqing, it’s as if there are two people in her body!</p><p>originally, the awakening of the memories of my previous life should be melded with the memories of this life. In the end, with the memories of my previous life as the dominant factor, it’s highly possible that I’ll once again step onto the unparalleled path, and even surpass my previous life!</p><p>however, Xie nianqing didn’t want to merge his previous life with his current life. Once he did, he would have to use his previous life’s memories as the main focus. If that happened, he wouldn’t be the Xie nianqing he is now. That’s why this is happening!</p><p>Xie nianjun explained.</p><p>“So it’s like this, so it’s like this!”</p><p>After Xie nianjun’s explanation, Lu Ming had a sudden realization.</p><p>Reincarnation actually existed in this world. Xie nianqing had awakened the memories of his past life, but he was unwilling to merge them together.</p><p>Xie nianqing definitely couldn’t let go, so he didn’t want to merge with her. Therefore, it was as if there were two people in Xie nianqing’s body.</p><p>One moment, he was controlled by the memories of his previous life, and the other moment, he was controlled by the memories of this life.</p><p>Xie nianqing must have been an extremely powerful expert in his past life. However, Lu Ming had taken possession of his body and his chastity. Xie nianqing felt humiliated, so he wanted to kill Lu Ming the moment he saw him.</p><p>Many thoughts flashed through Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>Also, back in the demonic sea of the land of infinite demons, those black-robed men had stolen the ancient demon coffin and placed Xie nianqing inside. It was very likely that they were trying to help Xie nianqing regain his memories.</p><p>Lu Ming had figured everything out.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Lu Ming took a deep breath and looked at Xie nianjun.”You’re also a reincarnation of an expert, right?”</p><p>“Not bad! In my previous life, Xie nianqing and I were sisters!”</p><p>Xie nianjun smiled.</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly taken aback. In his previous life, Xie nianjun and Xie nianqing were biological sisters. They had both reincarnated and were still sisters after reincarnation. No wonder they looked so similar.</p><p>And it was obvious that Xie nianjun’s memories of his past life and present life had merged.</p><p>However, in the history of the heaven realm, were there such two strong people?</p><p>“What level were you at in your previous life? Could it be the realm above heavenly Emperor?”</p><p>Lu Ming was very puzzled. More questions emerged in his heart.</p><p>“Above heavenly Emperor? Hehe, forget it, 1 won’t talk about this anymore. You won’t understand anyway. 1’11 teach you how to help Xie nianqing!”</p><p>Xie nianjun said.</p><p>“You have a way?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>of course. You just need to help her and let her memories of her past and present life merge together. That’s all!</p><p>Xie nianjun said.</p><p>no, according to what you said, the memory of the previous life and the current life will merge, and the previous life will be the dominant one. At that time, little Qing will not be little Qing. No!</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head.</p><p>This was hard for him to accept.</p><p>“Who said that after the fusion, the previous life must be the dominant one?”</p><p>Xie nianjun pouted, right now, Xie nianqing has two memories. He’s fighting for control. Whoever has the upper hand and has the absolute advantage in devouring the other’s memory will naturally be the dominant one!</p><p>for example, if Xie nianqing’s memory of this life prevailed and he devoured the memory of his previous life, it would only mean that he had an extra memory. It would have no effect on his personality. Xie nianqing would still be Xie nianqing. Do you understand? ”</p><p>Xie nianjun explained..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
