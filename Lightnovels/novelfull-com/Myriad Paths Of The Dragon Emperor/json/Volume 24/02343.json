After a while, a two star great emperor from the evil god tribe suddenly rushed into the cave.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A furious roar suddenly came from the cave. This roar was like a Dragon’s Roar, but also like a Python1 s hiss. It was extremely ear-piercing.</p><p>Immediately after, a loud boom came from the cave, and the entire Valley began to shake.</p><p>In less than a minute, the member of the evil god tribe who had rushed into the cave earlier rushed out. Outside the cave, the four members of the evil god tribe had grave expressions on their faces as they waited in formation.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>With a loud roar, a huge and slender body rushed out of the cave.</p><p>This is …”</p><p>In the distance, Lu Ming’s eyes moved.</p><p>It was a strange beast that looked like a real Dragon. Its body was covered in scales, but it only had four claws. On its back, there was a pair of wings that were extremely huge when spread out.</p><p>!!..</p><p>This was a type of exotic beast that Lu Ming had never seen before.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The mutant beast roared, and its body was covered in blazing flames. Its wings flapped out, and it pounced toward the evil god race member with lightning speed.</p><p>The evil god tribe member from earlier charged toward the other four members of the evil god tribe.</p><p>“Do it!”</p><p>One of the members of the evil god race roared out. All of the members of the evil god race attacked together. Four beams of destructive light shot out from their third eyes before transforming into various attacks.</p><p>Some of them turned into swords, some into sabers, and some into various beasts.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The dragon-like beast flapped its wings and sliced through the air like a heavenly blade, trying to block the evil god race’s attack.</p><p>However, they only managed to block a portion of the attacks. There were still a few attacks that broke through the encirclement and struck the strange beasts, causing them to stop in their tracks.</p><p>“Attack with all your might and kill this beast!”</p><p>A two star great emperor from the evil god race shouted, and the five members of the evil god race surrounded the strange beast.</p><p>The beast’s combat strength was extremely powerful, stronger than any two star great emperor from the evil god race. However, it wasn’t much stronger, and it was instantly at a disadvantage against the five of them.</p><p>The beast’s defensive power was astonishing, and its scales were extremely tough. Even a one star great emperor from the evil god tribe would find it difficult to break through its defenses. Only a two star great emperor from the evil god tribe would be able to cause any damage to it. Thus, although the beast was injured, it was still able to hold on.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>The strange beast roared. It seemed to be very unwilling and extremely furious. The flames on its body became hotter and hotter. Finally, its huge body began to shrink. Its originally hundred-meter-long body finally shrank to three meters in length.</p><p>However, its body began to glow with a crystalline light. The biggest change was in its wings, which had become fiery red and crystalline, as if they were made of fiery red jade.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The mutant beast flapped its wings, and its speed was much faster than before. Like a streak of light, it soared into the sky and broke out of the evil god tribe’s encirclement in an instant.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>One of the evil god race members roared.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The strange beast roared and pounced down from the sky like a bolt of red lightning. It pounced toward one of the one-star great emperor realm evil god tribe members with extreme speed.</p><p>The evil god race member was shocked and wanted to retreat. However, it was already too late.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The strange beast s sharp claws broke through the opponent’s defense and directly tore off one of his arms. At the same time, one of its wings slashed out horizontally, sharper than a heavenly blade.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>That evil god race member was directly split into two.</p><p>A one star great emperor from the evil god race was killed in an instant.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The other members of the evil god tribe roared and launched all sorts of attacks at the mutant beast.</p><p>The strange beast’s speed was extremely fast. It tried its best to Dodge, but it was still cut by an axe. Scales flew, and a wound was left on its body, blood flowing our.</p><p>The mutant beast was injured, and it became even more furious. Ir roared continuously and pounced toward the remaining one-star great emperor realm evil god tribe member.</p><p>The exotic beasts were too fast, it was almost impossible to Dodge if they wanted to attack.

However, when three of them joined forces, the mutated beast would not be a match for them.</p><p>The two sides exchanged more than a dozen moves.</p><p>One of the members of the evil god race was almost torn in half by the beast and was severely injured. However, the beast itself was also covered in blood and its injuries were also quite serious.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the end, the mutant beast set its eyes on the heavily injured evil god tribe member and pounced toward him in a frenzy, starting a fierce killing spree.</p><p>The entire body of a mutated beast was a weapon that could be used to attack. Its attacks were like a storm, and it was impossible to defend against.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The evil god tribe member was already heavily injured and was no match for the beast.

The strange beast’s bone armor made a cracking sound, and its body was smashed into the valley.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The earth trembled and dust filled the air. A large pit appeared on the ground.</p><p>This time, the strange beast suffered a heavy injury and was on the verge of death.</p><p>“Kill, kill!”</p><p>The eyes of the remaining two members of the evil god tribe were extremely cold.

Its tail had been cut off, and one of its sharp claws had been chopped off.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The strange beast was powerless to turn the situation around. It fell heavily to the ground and was no longer breathing.</p><p>“Evil creature, you dare to kill my clansmen? today, I’ll treat you as a dish of wine!”</p><p>One of the evil god race members said coldly as he flew toward the mutant beast.</p><p>When he got close to the Dragon-shaped beast, he swung his axe down, trying to cut off the Dragon-shaped beast’s head.</p><p>However, at this moment, the Dragon-shaped beast suddenly let out a loud roar.
