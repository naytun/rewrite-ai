The LAN and Yan families will have to pay the price eventually!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered, his voice getting colder and colder.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t act rashly. The LAN family is by no means comparable to ordinary forces. The LAN family is an extremely ancient family with a deep foundation and many experts. There’s not only a heavenly Emperor in LAN city. It’s said that the LAN family also has an old ancestor who’s a peerless powerhouse in the four-star heavenly Emperor realm!”</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu said with a serious expression.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s eyes were firm and he was unmoved!</p><p>in addition, the LAN family has existed for countless years and is on good terms with many major forces. For example, the Yan family. The Yan family is just an ordinary major force. They have a celestial Thearch in charge and have a marriage relationship with the LAN family. The two families are very close!</p><p>in addition, there are many forces similar to the Yan family who are on good terms with the LAN family. This time, they will all rush over. If you rush over, I’m afraid you will suffer a great loss!</p><p>so, if you want to go, you must be careful. If you really want to go, i’ll go with you. However, the other celestial emperors of the primordial realm have to guard two world city, so I’m afraid they can’t leave!</p><p>The Heng Yu heavenly Emperor explained the structure of the LAN family’s forces and their general strength to Lu Ming. However, seeing the determination in Lu Ming’s eyes, he knew that Lu Ming had already made up his mind and had agreed to go with him.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior Hengyu!” thank you! Lu Ming expressed his gratitude, if i want to go, I naturally have to be confident!</p><p>After saying this, he walked towards the Supreme elders of the immemorial body cultivators and cupped his fists.”Seniors, this junior has a matter that he would like to ask you for help with!”</p><p>“If there’s anything you need our old bones for, just say it!”</p><p>An old man laughed heartily. He was very forthright.</p><p>“I would like to invite the few seniors to follow me to a place …”</p><p>Lu Ming told her that he was going to the LAN family.</p><p>“No problem!”</p><p>The Supreme elders of the Archean body cultivators agreed.</p><p>Ever since Lu Ming had displayed his unparalleled talent in physical cultivation, they had regarded him highly.</p><p>Moreover, it was all thanks to Lu Ming that they were able to enter two world city this time. If Lu Ming was in trouble, they would naturally help him.</p><p>The eternal universe heavenly Emperor also smiled. He knew that these old men were extremely terrifying. With their help, their chances of success would be much greater.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll help them arrange a place to stay!”</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu said.</p><p>“Senior Heng Yu, is there any place that’s vast and uninhabited? this time, quite a few body cultivators have come, and they’re all in our small world!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Oh, how many people are there?”</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu asked.</p><p>about 30 billion people! Lu Ming said.</p><p>Oh, only 30 billion? that’s easy. There’s a vast, uninhabited mountain range not far from two world city. It’s enough for them to live in!</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu pondered for a moment before he thought of a place.</p><p>Thirty billion people seemed like a lot, but to the vast territory of the Tai Qing heaven, it was just a drop in the ocean.</p><p>The population of the Tai Qing heavenly region was simply uncountable. Any small region would have more than tens of billions of people.</p><p>Not long after, they set out and came to a vast and boundless mountain range.</p><p>This mountain range stretched for millions of miles and accommodated thirty billion people.</p><p>At once, Lu Ming and the people from the small world moved their minds and a large number of people appeared in the mountain range.</p><p>Then, an archaic body cultivator went up to make arrangements. Everyone cut down wood, moved stone, and repaired the houses.</p><p>Most of the immemorial body cultivators were extremely powerful, so it was extremely easy for them to do this. He believed that in a few days, they would be able to completely settle down here.</p><p>Ren Chan and the others also chose a place to settle down.</p><p>Their eyes were somewhat sad. Their small world had a large population, but now, not many had come. Many had died in battle.</p><p>In particular, some of the top experts were not here!</p><p>Lu Ming discussed with the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor and the rest. They decided that it would not be too late to visit the LAN family in a few days!</p><p>Lu Ming returned to two world city and met Mu Lan.</p><p>Mu Lan was naturally overjoyed to see Lu Ming.</p><p>The two of them reminisced for a while before Lu Ming returned to his residence, planning to have a good rest.</p><p>“I wonder if the primal Chaos Hall can be contacted now?”</p><p>Lu Ming then thought of the chaos Hall and took out the primordial chaos token.</p><p>He didn’t expect the mixed energy token to move.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed and he channeled the world Energy into it.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The primordial chaos token vibrated and a beam of light appeared, enveloping Lu Ming.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s figure disappeared from the spot.</p><p>Lu Ming seemed to be traveling through the void. That feeling was as if he was taking a long-distance teleportation array.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming arrived at a Hall.</p><p>It was the primal Chaos Palace!</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming appeared, there was a flash of light in the chaos Palace.</p><p>There were a total of nine figures, each of them emitting different colors.</p><p>Earth One, gold one …</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“Greetings, young master!”</p><p>Earth One, gold one, and the rest bowed to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Seniors, there’s no need to be so polite!”</p><p>Lu Ming quickly waved his hands.</p><p>courtesy can not be disregarded. Young master has already defeated Yuan Xin, the son of chaos. Furthermore, you have become a great emperor with many types of nomological laws and even mastered many types of ultimate laws. Such talent is unprecedented. In the future, you will be the master of the chaos Palace and our young master!</p><p>Earth One said with a serious expression.</p><p>“You guys, have you heard of me?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>of course. The primal Chaos Palace is in the Tai Qing heavenly region. The young master’s reputation has spread throughout the Tai Qing heavenly region. Of course, we’ve heard of him!</p><p>Earth One said with a smile.</p><p>“The primal Chaos Hall is in the Tai Qing heavenly region? Then why couldn’t I contact you guys before?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>The primal Chaos Hall was in the Tai Qing heavenly region. This wasn’t hard to guess. Back then, he was able to enter the primal Chaos Hall from the origin continent. It wasn’t hard to guess that the primal Chaos Hall was in the Tai Qing heavenly region.</p><p>That was because only the Tai Qing heavenly region had a passageway that was connected to the yuan continent.</p><p>Hunyuan sect was probably also in the Tai Qing heavenly region!</p><p>Lu Ming was curious. Previously, he could not contact Earth One and the rest. Now, he could contact them.</p><p>young lord, there are two battlefields in the Tai Qing heavenly region. The chaotic Palace is near one of them!</p><p>more than ten years ago, the foreign races suddenly launched a large-scale invasion. An intense battle broke out on that battlefield. We brought the primal Chaos Palace to participate in the battle and cut off the outside world’s senses. That’s why you didn’t attack us!</p><p>Tu Yi explained.</p><p>The other eight people also nodded.</p><p>Lu Ming had a sudden realization. So that was the case!</p><p>Recently, the alien races had not invaded. Therefore, Lu Ming could contact Earth One and the rest again.</p><p>seniors, 1 would like to ask you about the chaos Scripture …</p><p>Lu Ming asked. The chaos Scripture that he had seemed to be incomplete.</p><p>young master, the chaos Sutra you have is indeed incomplete. There’s only the part before you become a divine Emperor. The part after you become a divine Emperor was supposed to be given to you after you become a divine Emperor, but now that you’ve become a true divine Emperor, it’s natural that 1 give it to you. Young master, follow me!</p><p>With that, tu Yi walked in one direction. Lu Ming followed him and came to a secret room..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
