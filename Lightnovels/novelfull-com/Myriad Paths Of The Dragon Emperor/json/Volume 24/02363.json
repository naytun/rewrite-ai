Fie had finally made a breakthrough in the seven Gods mysterious technique and reached the middle of the fifth stage.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming’s physical strength also increased tremendously.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming could suppress a four star great emperor with just his physical strength.</p><p>With every breakthrough of the seven Gods mysterious technique, his physical strength would skyrocket, and the increase was extremely shocking.</p><p>For example, at the early stage of the fifth level of the seven Gods mysterious technique, he could suppress an ordinary one-star great emperor with his physical strength alone.</p><p>Once he reached the mid-stage of the fifth level, he could suppress four star great emperors, and when he reached the late-stage, he could suppress peak great emperors.</p><p>Every time he broke through, his strength would increase explosively.</p><p>Now, with the strength of his physical body and the power of the law, it would not be too difficult for Lu Ming to kill a four star great emperor. He could even fight against a five star great emperor.</p><p>the time has come. With my current strength, it’s enough to wipe out everyone in this formation!</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a confident expression.</p><p>However, the three emperors were still cultivating. Lu Ming was in no hurry to leave. He continued cultivating and consolidating his cultivation.</p><p>On a mountain peak ten thousand miles away from Lu Ming’s group, a powerful aura suddenly burst out.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A figure soared into the sky, and his aura swept in all directions like a Gale.</p><p>“I’ve finally broken through!”</p><p>The man muttered to himself, his eyes shining with a terrifying light.</p><p>This person was LAN Kang!</p><p>After several months of bitter cultivation and refining a few Dao fragments, he finally broke through the bottleneck and became a four star great emperor.</p><p>A four star great emperor was already a high-level great emperor, and his battle-power had greatly increased.</p><p>LAN Kang’s shocking aura also alerted the people nearby.</p><p>“What a shocking aura! It’s a four star great emperor!”</p><p>“LAN Kang has broken through and become a four star great emperor!”</p><p>this is great! A four star great emperor has appeared! We can finally annihilate the evil god tribe!</p><p>One voice after another was heard. Some were shocked, and some were overjoyed.</p><p>Before this, whether it was the evil god tribe or the heaven realm beings, the strongest was the three star great emperor.</p><p>The birth of a four star great emperor would definitely break the balance and give the heaven realm an absolute advantage.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>However, at this moment, a terrifying aura rushed out from the distance. This aura was extremely shocking and soared into the sky like smoke.</p><p>This aura was equivalent to a four star great emperor!</p><p>“This … This is someone from the evil god tribe! Someone from the evil god tribe has also broken through!”</p><p>On the side of the heavenly realm, someone exclaimed, his face pale.</p><p>How did this happen?</p><p>LAN Kang had just broken through and become a four star great emperor. He had thought that he would be able to annihilate the evil god tribe, but he didn’t expect that someone from the other races had also broken through and become a four star great emperor.</p><p>This made everyone’s hearts sink.</p><p>In this case, it was hard to predict the outcome.</p><p>LAN Kang’s face also darkened.</p><p>someone from the alien race has also broken through to four star great emperor. I’m not sure if I can defeat him, so I have to improve my cultivation!</p><p>right, let’s go and find Lu Ming. This kid has a large number of great Dao fragments. I’ll sneak over, kill him, and take his great Dao fragments. Then, I’ll find a place to cultivate in seclusion. When 1 break through to five star great emperor, 1 can easily deal with the alien race!</p><p>LAN Kang’s eyes glowed with a cold light.</p><p>now is not the time to start a war. 1 have just broken through and need to consolidate my strength. You all keep an eye on the movements of the foreign tribes. If there is any news, inform me immediately!</p><p>LAN Kang ordered the others.</p><p>Now, his cultivation had reached the four star great emperor realm, and he had become the strongest expert in the heaven realm. Naturally, he had a lofty appearance.</p><p>“Alright, we will!”</p><p>The others quickly nodded, trying to please him.</p><p>Now, if they wanted to leave this place alive, they could only rely on LAN Kang. Without LAN Kang, they would be slaughtered by the alien races.</p><p>The non-humankind didn’t attack. Apparently, they sensed LAN Kang’s breakthrough and were a little afraid.</p><p>LAN Kang flew rapidly toward the mountain peak where Lu Ming and the rest were.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest occupied the highest peak in the vicinity. This was already known to the others. Naturally, LAN Kang had also heard the news.</p><p>Not long after, LAN Kang arrived at the mountain peak where Lu Ming and the rest were.</p><p>Lu Ming, who was sitting cross-legged on the mountain peak, opened his eyes. His gaze was like the stars as he looked at LAN Kang.</p><p>“LAN Kang, I didn’t go looking for you, but you came!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, hand over all the fragments of the great Dao that you have!”</p><p>LAN Kang said coldly.</p><p>“Let’s see if you have the ability to take my Dao fragment!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>LAN Kang stood in the sky with his hands behind his back, looking like he was the only one in the world.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Then, LAN Kang suddenly took a step forward. As he took this step, a terrifying aura burst out from LAN Kang’s body.</p><p>Emperor formless, huntian, and Sky Fire had already woken up when LAN Kang arrived. Their eyes widened in shock as they exclaimed,”Four star great emperor! You’ve broken through to the four star great emperor realm!”</p><p>“Flehe!”</p><p>LAN Kang chuckled and looked down at Lu Ming and the rest.”Lu Ming, are you in despair now?”</p><p>“Despair? Are you talking about yourself?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled, his expression calm.</p><p>He did not know why, but when he saw Lu Ming’s smile, LAN Kang’s heart trembled for no reason. He had a bad feeling.</p><p>he’s just pretending to be calm. Although he’s strong, he’s definitely no match for a four star great emperor!</p><p>LAN Kang warned himself.</p><p>His cultivation had been at the limit of three star great emperor, and with the help of the Dao fragment, he had been able to break through so quickly.</p><p>On the other hand, although Lu Ming’s combat strength was strong, he was only a true Emperor. It was impossible for him to break through to the four star great emperor realm so quickly.</p><p>LAN Kang was relieved after thinking this through.</p><p>“Deliberately mystifying. If you don’t hand it over, then 1’11 take it myself!”</p><p>LAN Kang said. Then, in a flash, he charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The lion’s roar reverberated through the sky. LAN Kang threw a punch at Lu Ming. A purple sky Lion formed and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>The expressions of Emperor formless and the others changed drastically.</p><p>“This move again, I’m tired of seeing it!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s faint voice was heard. He then struck out with his palm.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm was like a heavenly blade, cutting through the void. The apparition of the Sky Lion that LAN Kang had condensed burst like a bubble.</p><p>LAN Kang’s pupils contracted rapidly.</p><p>Although he didn’t use his full strength, he could definitely injure a three star great emperor.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s ability, he should have been severely injured by his one move. However, Lu Ming had effortlessly destroyed his attack.</p><p>“No, something’s not right!”</p><p>LAN Kang roared in his heart. His eyes were filled with uncertainty, and he was already thinking of retreating.</p><p>“Lu Ming, we’ll fight another day!”</p><p>LAN Kang shouted, turned around and ran.</p><p>“It’s too late to leave now!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He cast the six-feathered divine wings, and a pair of wings appeared on his back.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s muscles vibrated at least a few billion times per second. His body dashed forward at an indescribable speed. In a split second, he was close to LAN Kang..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
