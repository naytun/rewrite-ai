After decades of reproduction, green grass was everywhere and the trees had grown up. Some of them were even more than a hundred meters tall.</p><p>There were also all kinds of spiritual and sacred herbs among the mountains.</p><p>Lu Ming had even bought a large number of low-level demonic beasts and sent them to his small world, making it look lively.</p><p>It seemed like it was no different from a normal world.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master left a small group of people behind in the Azure region. The rest entered Lu Ming’s small world, planning to move.</p><p>After he was done with the Azure continent, Lu Ming made another trip to the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>Lu Ming’s appearance naturally caused a stir in the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>Now that the divine wilderness continent was completely under the control of the Dragon Alliance, Lu Ming asked the higher-ups of the Dragon Alliance to gather all the talented people in the Alliance.</p><p>After asking for everyone’s opinion, those who were willing to leave with Lu Ming entered Lu Ming’s small world.</p><p>Naturally, most of them were willing to leave.</p><p>On the path of cultivation, everyone wanted to climb higher mountains, leave the divine wilderness, and enter a better place for cultivation. Who would not be willing?</p><p>Once everything was ready, Lu Ming left the divine wilderness continent and returned to the Azure continent. He did not even look back as he headed towards the ancient Moon Holy Land.</p><p>He planned to first go to ancient Moon Holy Land, then head to heaven Emperor City to deal with the Heng clan and he clan.</p><p>However, just as Lu Ming was about to approach the ancient Moon sanctuary, his gaze suddenly flickered.</p><p>This was because Lu Ming could sense a cold killing intent in the sky.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, a sword light suddenly pierced out of the void at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>This sword was a one-hit kill. It was fast, accurate, and ruthless. Its power was extremely strong.</p><p>The sword light contained the aura of the great Dao.</p><p>The assassin was a great emperor!</p><p>As soon as the sword-light appeared, a terrifying murderous aura gushed out, and the sword-light was already approaching Lu Ming’s glabella.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s expression was very calm!</p><p>He had limited the timing of his attack. Before the other party’s sword light could reach his forehead, he had already caught the sword light between his two fingers.</p><p>Then, the sword light was fixed in place, unable to move forward.</p><p>The person who had stabbed out with the sword was a Man in Black. He wore a mask on his face-the mask of the Grim Reaper.</p><p>At this moment, the black-clothed man’s pupils contracted sharply.</p><p>The sure-kill move that he had been preparing for a long time was caught between two of Lu Ming’s fingers. No matter how he unleashed his power, Lu Ming’s fingers and his long sword could not move at all.</p><p>What a terrifying strength!</p><p>He understood that Lu Ming’s ability was too terrifying. It did not match the information they had received.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>He let out a loud roar, then let go of the long sword in his hand and retreated as fast as he could.</p><p>He had the cultivation of a great emperor and he was extremely fast.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was faster than him.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed and appeared behind him. He extended a palm and clasped his neck. A terrifying power surged into the Man in Black. His body was sore and he could not move at all.</p><p>At this moment, he was extremely frightened!</p><p>His cultivation base was one star great emperor.</p><p>With his cultivation level, he could not put up any resistance at all in Lu Ming’s hands. How was this possible?</p><p>How could Lu Ming’s ability be so strong?</p><p>“The death god nation, hehe, it’s too late to leave now!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and looked ahead. Then, the muscles in his body trembled and his figure burst out. In an instant, he had covered an unknown distance.</p><p>There was also a Man in Black in front of him. He was wearing a mask of the Grim Reaper and was fleeing frantically.</p><p>This person’s cultivation was stronger than the Man in Black in Lu Ming’s hands. He was actually a two star great emperor.</p><p>However, he didn’t dare to stay any longer.</p><p>A one star great emperor was as weak as a baby in Lu Ming’s hands. Lu Ming’s strength was definitely far above that of a two star great emperor.</p><p>He could only run, or else he would die.</p><p>However, escaping was also a dead end.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and a terrifying fist force crushed the void. The Man in Black, who was running away, felt a fatal threat. He exploded with all his strength and slashed backward.</p><p>This sword was not weak, but it could not withstand a single blow from Lu Ming’s fist force.</p><p>The fist force crushed over and the sword Qi collapsed. The black-clothed man’s body also exploded under this attack and turned into ashes.</p><p>A two-star great emperor was killed in one hit.</p><p>The eyes of the Man in Black in Lu Ming’s hands widened.</p><p>“Damn it, I’ve been tricked!”</p><p>The man roared in his heart.</p><p>They had received news that Lu Ming’s strength was only equivalent to that of a one-star great emperor. However, he had a celestial Thearch’s physical body, which was extremely powerful.</p><p>However, in the eyes of these assassins, what they valued was the other party’s own strength. External forces were useless.</p><p>They could kill in one strike, but even with the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body, they couldn’t use it.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s strength was far beyond that of a one star great emperor.</p><p>Even a three-star great emperor wasn’t that powerful. He was practically a high-tier great emperor.</p><p>the death god nation. Hehe, speak. Who sent you to kill me? ”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the man in Black in his hands and said coldly.</p><p>“Don’t even think about getting any information from me!”</p><p>The Man in Black said.</p><p>“Oh, really?”</p><p>I’m sorry,” Lu Ming said indifferently. He used his World Energy and the other party’s mask turned to dust, revealing a pale middle-aged man’s face.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly made a move. The power of the law was like a knife and cut off one of the other party’s arms.</p><p>However, the other party only grunted and didn’t even frown.</p><p>These assassins had gone through strict training and had a tough mind.</p><p>Moreover, the other party was a great emperor.</p><p>“You don’t have to waste your time, just kill me!”</p><p>The other party looked at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>“It’s not that easy to die!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly, then punched the person’s dantian.</p><p>The terrifying power directly tore the person’s small world apart and completely crippled his cultivation.</p><p>With his cultivation crippled, the man let out a furious roar and glared at Lu Ming with bloodshot eyes.</p><p>To a great emperor, having his cultivation crippled after a lifetime of bitter cultivation was worse than death.</p><p>“Are you going to tell me or not?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“I won’t tell you, just give up!”</p><p>The Man in Black roared.</p><p>“If you don’t tell me, I’ll have to search your soul!”</p><p>Having said that, Lu Ming pointed his finger between the other party’s eyebrows and a powerful force surged in.</p><p>He was going to search her soul and find out the secrets she knew.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming wanted to find the headquarters of the death god nation and destroy this force in one fell swoop.</p><p>This was not the first time that this faction had sent people to assassinate him.</p><p>Back then, before the battle of the ten lands, he had been assassinated by this force and he had almost died.</p><p>If Xie nianqing had not given him the scapegoat demon chief, he would have been in real danger.</p><p>He had long wanted to get rid of this force..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
