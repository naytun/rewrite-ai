Chapter 2347-body tempering</p><p>Translator: 549690339</p><p>As Lu Ming flew, he attacked with the fallen star bow.</p><p>The falling star bow’s attack range was extremely far. Wu Xiu and Wu Bo’s figures were blocked. Lu Ming took the opportunity to fly forward for a while, increasing the distance between the two of them.</p><p>1, Lu Ming, will remember what happened today. 1’11 keep your heads for now. 1’11 take them back with my own hands in the future!</p><p>A cold voice came out of Lu Ming’s mouth.</p><p>Lu Ming had to kill Wu Xiu and Wu Bo!</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Wu Bo and Wu Xiu were both extremely anxious.</p><p>They knew that Lu Ming was not just saying it. He would definitely do it.</p><p>Most importantly, given Lu Ming’s talent, he would definitely be able to do it in the future. There was no doubt about it. It would not be long before Lu Ming’s combat strength surpassed theirs.</p><p>Not to mention Lu Ming’s talent, even the power behind Lu Ming was extremely terrifying. The LAN family’s incident had long spread to all parts of the heaven realm, making everyone aware of Lu Ming’s powerful abilities.</p><p>!!..</p><p>Any one of the celestial Thearch behind Lu Ming could kill them.</p><p>Therefore, he must not let Lu Ming leave.</p><p>At that moment, the two of them felt a little regretful. They did not regret attacking Lu Ming. Instead, they regretted that they were too confident and gave Lu Ming too much time after they attacked.</p><p>To deal with a person like Lu Ming, once he made a move, he had to kill him with a thunderous momentum. Any delay would cause unforeseen circumstances.</p><p>They had given Lu Ming a few minutes and he had escaped right under their noses.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was too late for them to realize it now!</p><p>Wu Xiu and Wu Bo unleashed all their strength and chased after Lu Ming, biting him tightly and not letting go.</p><p>Lu Ming was definitely injured and could not hold on for long. As time passed, they would definitely catch up to him.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>At this time, two more arrows were shot at them, and they could only wave their hands to block the arrows.</p><p>As a result, their figures were blocked again and the distance between them and Lu Ming was greatly widened.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it!”</p><p>The two of them roared in their hearts and chased after him madly. However, they could not change the fact that the distance between them and Lu Ming was increasing.</p><p>Just like that, after Lu Ming shot a few arrows, they had already flown out of this scorching land and arrived at a more normal place.</p><p>This place had beautiful mountains and clear waters, and peaks were everywhere.</p><p>After arriving at this place, Lu Ming rushed down to the ground and ran along the mountain forest. Not long after, Wu Xiu and Wu Bo completely lost track of Lu Ming.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Wu Xiu and Wu Bo stopped on a mountain peak and let out a beast-like roar. They slammed their palms randomly, and the terrifying palm prints bombarded the mountain peak, shaking the mountain and sending gravel flying-</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had already entered a hidden cave and went deep underground. He walked along the ground and there was not a trace of aura coming from his body.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>As he moved forward, Lu Ming spat out a mouthful of blood and his face turned pale.</p><p>Although his defense was astonishing and his vitality was extremely strong, Wu Xiu and Wu Bo were two star great emperor realm existences after all. Their combined attack was extremely terrifying. Lu Ming’s injuries were still very serious.</p><p>He had used all his strength to draw the fallen star bow continuously, so his injuries had naturally worsened.</p><p>However, it didn’t matter. With the profoundness of the indestructible ancient scroll, no matter how serious his injuries were, it didn’t matter.</p><p>Deep underground, Lu Ming kept moving forward. He had no idea how far he had traveled. Then, he entered the mountain and river diagram and began to circulate the indestructible ancient scroll to heal his injuries.</p><p>Lu Ming’s injuries were recovering at an alarming rate.</p><p>In the distance, Wu Xiu and Wu Bo were frantically looking for Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming must be hiding somewhere to recuperate. We must find him and kill him!”</p><p>Wu Xiu roared.</p><p>If they did not kill Lu Ming, the best ending for them would be to hide on the void God Island. Once they returned to the heaven realm, they would definitely be killed by the celestial Thearch behind Lu Ming.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming must die!</p><p>Time passed day by day!</p><p>Three days later, Lu Ming’s injuries had fully recovered and he was at his peak.</p><p>Then, with a thought, a huge cauldron appeared between his brows and landed in front of him.</p><p>It was the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, which contained liquid fire.</p><p>liquid fire can be said to be a top-notch treasure for tempering the body. If I can refine this liquid fire, 1’11 definitely be able to make a breakthrough in the ‘Seven Gods mysterious technique’!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. He then controlled the world Energy and rolled out a ball of liquid fire.</p><p>Chi Chi Chi…</p><p>The liquid fire had an astonishingly high temperature. Even the power of the world was about to burn, making sizzling sounds.</p><p>Lu Ming withdrew the world Energy and grabbed the liquid fire in his hand.</p><p>Chi Chi Chi…</p><p>Immediately, a burning smell came from Lu Ming’s palm, as if it was going to burn his palm.</p><p>However, the strength of Lu Ming’s physical body was extremely shocking. Coupled with the imperishable golden body, it was comparable to an ordinary great emperor weapon.</p><p>At the same time, he circulated the indestructible ancient scroll. Although Lu Ming’s body was burning, he was recovering at an even faster speed.</p><p>Next, Lu Ming controlled the power of the world and spread out the liquid fire, enveloping Lu Ming’s entire body evenly.</p><p>Lu Ming began to circulate the” Seven Gods mysterious technique ” to refine the liquid flame. With the power of the liquid flame, he began to temper his body.</p><p>Three days later, the liquid fire was refined by Lu Ming. His physical body had improved but he had not broken through the bottleneck.</p><p>this way of cultivation is too slow and too gentle. I’ll just enter the cauldron. With the strength of my body, I should be able to withstand it!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered, his eyes flashing with madness.</p><p>He planned to enter the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron directly and soak in the liquid fire. This way, his cultivation speed would definitely increase greatly.</p><p>It could be said that this was an extremely crazy idea. If others were to know about it, they would be scared to death.</p><p>The liquid fire could even burn a sovereign weapon, so any body that entered it would probably be burned to death.</p><p>Of course, this was only for ordinary people, not Lu Ming.</p><p>With the strength of his body and the recovery ability of the indestructible ancient scroll, he could completely withstand it.</p><p>Lu Ming put his thoughts into action immediately. He entered the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron. Of course, he had already taken off his clothes.</p><p>With a ‘plop’, Lu Ming’s entire body was submerged in the liquid fire. At that moment, waves of tearing pain enveloped Lu Ming’s entire body.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s physical body was very strong, the liquid fire was still slowly burning him, trying to burn him to ashes.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately circulated the indestructible ancient scroll and his physical body began to recover rapidly. However, the pain did not seem to ease at all.</p><p>Lu Ming focused his mind and cleared his mind of distracting thoughts. He focused on circulating the seven Gods mysterious technique and began to cultivate.</p><p>The liquid flame contained a huge amount of energy essence. Lu Ming was constantly absorbing it. At the same time, the burning of the liquid flame could also help to temper his body.</p><p>Under the dual effects, Lu Ming’s physical body was improving rapidly.</p><p>Half a month later, his Seven Gods mysterious technique finally broke through and reached the fifth level.</p><p>After breaking through to the fifth level, Lu Ming’s physical strength and strength increased rapidly.</p><p>At this stage, Lu Ming’s physical strength alone was comparable to a great emperor.</p><p>This was a qualitative leap.</p><p>His body was shockingly strong, and it was even harder than a normal Emperor weapon. He could feel that his body was filled with endless power..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
