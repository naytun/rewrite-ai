He looked like an invincible God of War.</p><p>On the contrary, Lin Xiaofeng’s face was pale and full of dejection.</p><p>He had lost. From now on, he was no longer the number one in the world.</p><p>The number one chosen of the younger generation had changed hands!</p><p>“Hahaha, good, good, good!”</p><p>Lan Cheng laughed so hard that flowers bloomed.</p><p>Everything was just as he had expected. Nothing had changed. Xuanyuan Yi had indeed defeated Lin Xiaofeng and won the title of the number one genius. His prestige would reach its peak, and the LAN family’s prestige would rise as well.</p><p>is there anyone else who wants to fight? if not, this battle is over!</p><p>Lan Cheng stood up with a face full of smiles. His voice resounded throughout the entire area.</p><p>‘Til do it!”</p><p>At this moment, a clear voice was heard. Outside the square, a beam of light flew over at high speed and landed on the fighting ring.</p><p>This was a fifteen or sixteen-year-old teenager with an elegant demeanor and extraordinary temperament.</p><p>However, when they saw the young man’s appearance, many people were stunned.</p><p>“Lu… Ming!”</p><p>Long Chen, Huang Ling, desolate li, bubbles, and the others were all stunned.</p><p>At the same time, LAN Yun, Heng Xing He, Yuan Xin, and the others, including Lan Cheng and the others, were also in a daze.</p><p>Even Lu Ming himself almost bit his tongue. His eyes widened.</p><p>It was because this teenager was too similar to Lu Ming!</p><p>He looked 70 – 80% similar to Lu Ming, but he was more delicate.</p><p>no, he’s not Lu Ming. He’s only fifteen or sixteen years old. It can’t be Lu Ming!</p><p>Someone immediately said.</p><p>A person’s appearance could be changed at will.</p><p>However, their aura, or life aura, would not change. One could clearly tell a person’s age from their life aura.</p><p>This teenager was definitely not old. He should be around fifteen or sixteen years old. Of course, he could not be Lu Ming.</p><p>damn it. Could this young man be Lu Ming’s illegitimate son?”</p><p>The unscrupulous monk muttered the name of Buddha and muttered softly.</p><p>However, everyone present was an expert, so they naturally heard it clearly.</p><p>Many people were moved. Perhaps this was really possible, because the two of them were really too similar.</p><p>“This monk…”</p><p>Lu Ming touched his nose speechlessly and looked at the unscrupulous monk in disdain. He was really overthinking, Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>However, at this moment, the young man turned to the unscrupulous monk and cupped his fists. “Master, you know Lu Ming?”</p><p>“Of course. Lu Ming is my brother. We’ve known each other for decades. Young man, what’s your relationship with Lu Ming?”</p><p>The monk said.</p><p>“It’s my father!”</p><p>The young man said.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming had been drinking a mouthful of wine but he spat it out at that moment. He looked at the teenager, dumbfounded.</p><p>The young man actually said that he was his son?</p><p>Son?</p><p>He had a son?</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded. At the same time, his mind was racing.</p><p>“Little Qing!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He thought of Xie nianqing.</p><p>He had only had sex with Xie nianqing, and the timing matched the young man’s age.</p><p>Furthermore, Lu Ming looked at the teenager carefully and realized that he did have some resemblance to Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Could it be … Is he really my son?”</p><p>Lu Ming had an inexplicable feeling in his heart. This feeling was very wonderful and indescribable.</p><p>The others, such as Long Chen, Feng Ling, and bubbles, were also dumbfounded.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, you have a son. Little Lu Ming? It really does look like it, chirping!”</p><p>Pao Pao cried out.</p><p>nest, I was just randomly guessing at the beginning. I didn’t expect that I would be right!</p><p>The unscrupulous monk’s eyes almost popped out.</p><p>“Lu Ming…”</p><p>Huang Ling sighed and felt complicated.</p><p>“Lu Ming’s son…”</p><p>The eyes of LAN Yun, Heng Xinghe, Yuan Xin, and the others glowed with a cold light.</p><p>The eternal universe heavenly Emperor, the primordial body cultivators, and the Grand Supreme elders all looked at Lu Ming with strange expressions.</p><p>Lu Ming resisted the urge to rush out.</p><p>It wasn’t the time yet. Even if he was really his and Xie nianqing’s son, it would be the same when they acknowledged him later.</p><p>If he went out now and showed his true form, he would probably lose the 100 stones of chaos. Lan Cheng and the others would definitely not let him challenge Xuanyuan Yi.</p><p>Many thoughts flashed through everyone’s mind.</p><p>“Senior, do you know where my father, Lu Ming, is now?”</p><p>The young man looked at the unscrupulous monk and continued to ask.</p><p>“This … He’s cultivating in seclusion in a secret place and won’t be able to come out for the time being!”</p><p>The unscrupulous monk made up stories.</p><p>“What closed-door training? I’m telling you, Lu Ming is already dead!”</p><p>A cold voice sounded. It was LAN Yun.</p><p>The teenager was actually Lu Ming’s son. He was unhappy just by looking at him.</p><p>“What did you just say? My mother said that my father is unparalleled in the world. No one in the younger generation can defeat him. How could he have died?”</p><p>The youth glared at LAN Yun.</p><p>what dogshit unparalleled? you’re just deceiving yourself!</p><p>LAN Yun said in disdain.</p><p>in my opinion, you must have been defeated by my father before. You must have even been tortured miserably. Otherwise, you wouldn’t belittle him on purpose!</p><p>The young man’s eyes flashed as he said coldly.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>LAN Yun’s face was flushed red. The youth’s words just happened to poke his sore spot.</p><p>He had been abused by Lu Ming more than once. He was miserable every time and he had lost all his face.</p><p>hahaha, little Lu Ming, you’re right. He’s been tortured by Lu Ming. He’s practically begging for mercy on his knees and crying for his parents. He has betrayed his ancestors!</p><p>The unscrupulous monk exaggerated, directly implicating the LAN family. This made Lan Cheng’s face turn ugly, and he wanted to slap the unscrupulous monk to death.</p><p>As for LAN Yun, his face was alternating between green and green.</p><p>alright, young man. You want to challenge me? who do you want to challenge?</p><p>Lan Cheng quickly changed the topic.</p><p>The young man’s gaze scanned the crowd of Young heaven’s favorites and finally landed on the Black Tortoise forest.</p><p>“I want to challenge him!”</p><p>The young man pointed at the Xuanwu forest.</p><p>What?</p><p>Everyone was shocked. The young man actually wanted to challenge the Xuanwu forest.</p><p>The young man was only fifteen or sixteen years old. How strong could he be at this age? it was already rare for him to become a great emperor, but he actually wanted to challenge the Xuanwu forest.</p><p>No matter what, the Black Tortoise forest was still one of the nine absolutes.</p><p>Its cultivation had long broken through to the true Emperor realm, and now, it even had the combat power of a sixth stage true Emperor.</p><p>How could he challenge Jiu Jue at such a young age?</p><p>Black Tortoise Lin’s expression darkened. He was actually challenged by a fifteen or sixteen-year-old youth. It was truly embarrassing.</p><p>you’re so young, but you’re so overconfident that you want to challenge jiujue. You really don’t know your own place. You’re no different from your father!</p><p>LAN Yun was very unhappy. He seized the opportunity to mock and ridicule.</p><p>“Oh, in that case, I’ll challenge you first. Come down and fight me!”</p><p>The young man turned his gaze towards LAN Yun.</p><p>“You want to challenge me?”</p><p>LAN Yun’s expression changed slightly.</p><p>nonsense. You, come down and fight me. Don’t tell me you don’t even dare to accept my challenge!</p><p>The young man said..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
