It was nine-colored and dazzled the eyes, but its speed was unbelievably fast and its power was shocking.</p><p>The non-human Emperor roared as a destructive light shot out from his third eye. At the same time, he slashed out with his battle-ax.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The nine-colored arrow landed on the battle-ax of the non-human Emperor for the second time. The battle-ax trembled violently, and then flew out of his hand.</p><p>The non-human Emperor’s body trembled violently as he was forced back continuously. The web between his thumb and forefinger was torn open, and blood flowed freely from it. One of his arms had completely lost all feeling!</p><p>Now, Lu Ming’s cultivation had reached the level of a seven-star true Emperor and his nine types of laws had all reached the third level. When he pulled the bowstring, the power was many times stronger than before.</p><p>Ordinary one star great emperors would find it hard to resist.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming drew his bow continuously and shot two more arrows.</p><p>The non-human Emperor let out an unwilling roar as he used all of his strength to block, but it was all in vain.</p><p>!!..</p><p>Of the two arrows, one pierced through the chest of the non-human Emperor, nailing him to the ground. The second arrow pierced through his forehead, killing him instantly.</p><p>A great emperor was killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>This was the first time he had done so without borrowing the celestial Thearch’s corporeal body.</p><p>Lu Ming also sighed in his heart.</p><p>He had unknowingly grown to the point where he could kill a great emperor.</p><p>More than ten years ago, when he was in the yuan continent, the great emperor was so high up in his eyes that he could not climb up.</p><p>At that time, Lu Ming could not compete with the great emperor at all except by relying on the celestial Thearch’s physical body. The great emperor could kill him with one slap with his true strength.</p><p>But now, things were different. Unknowingly, his strength had grown to an astonishing height.</p><p>After killing the non-human Emperor, the nine-colored arrow turned into energy and disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming was just about to fly over and collect the corpse of the alien Emperor when two beams of light flickered in the distance and flew over at high speed.</p><p>“It’s them!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>The two streaks of light were actually the twin brothers.</p><p>The two of them had obviously discovered Lu Ming from afar. Hence, they flew at a very fast speed and arrived at Lu Ming’s side in an instant.</p><p>The two of them looked at the non-human Emperor with surprise.</p><p>brother Lu Ming is really amazing. You killed a great emperor with your own abilities. I’m impressed, I’m impressed!</p><p>One of them said, his eyes revealing a look of surprise.</p><p>“I was just lucky!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and walked over to collect the body of the non-human Emperor.</p><p>“Brother Lu, did you kill all the crows that day?”</p><p>The person who had spoken earlier asked again.</p><p>“No, I just rushed out!”</p><p>Lu Ming answered casually.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>The twin brothers looked at each other and nodded. “Brother Lu Ming, it seems like we are fated. Why don’t we work together next?”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment and nodded.</p><p>He was not familiar with this place. Moreover, the two people before him had rather high cultivation levels. Lu Ming could not use the celestial Thearch body now. If he had more people with him, they would be of more help if he were to encounter any danger.</p><p>“You two, do you know how big this desert is?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>this desert is huge. We’ve been wandering in this desert for the past few days. It’s deathly silent, and there are no opportunities. We’re just wasting our time here. As long as we keep going into the depths of the island, we’ll definitely be able to leave this desert!</p><p>One of the twins said.</p><p>This person was the elder brother of the twin brothers.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Indeed, there was not much to be gained in this desert. He had wandered around for many days and had only obtained an Emperor’s medicine and some spiritual liquid.</p><p>Immediately, the three of them discussed for a while before heading towards the center of the island.</p><p>On the way, Lu Ming found out the two people’s names.</p><p>One of them was called Wu Xiu, and the other was called Wu Bo. Both of them were two star great emperors.</p><p>Along the way, they encountered a wave of non-humans, but there were only two of them. One was a two star great emperor while the other was a one star great emperor.</p><p>Naturally, he was besieged by Lu Ming and the other two and eventually killed.</p><p>Later on, they encountered a group of seven to eight people from the foreign tribe. At first, Wu Xiu suggested that Lu Ming take out his “puppet” and kill these foreign tribes, but Lu Ming turned around and left.</p><p>The puppet that Wu Xiu was referring to was the celestial Thearch’s physical body. However, the energy in the physical body had been exhausted, so there was no way he could kill the enemy. Naturally, Lu Ming turned and left.</p><p>Fortunately, they were fast enough, so they didn’t get surrounded by the alien races and successfully escaped.</p><p>Just like that, they flew for half a month before leaving the desert area.</p><p>The main thing was that the pressure in this area was too strong. Their flying speed was thousands of times slower than outside.</p><p>That was why it took so long to cross the desert.</p><p>After passing through the desert, they came to a Crimson land.</p><p>The temperature of this land was astonishingly high, and lava could be seen flowing out from the ground from time to time.</p><p>An astonishingly high temperature was constantly spreading from the ground.</p><p>Logically speaking, such an environment was even more deathly silent than the desert from before. There was even less vegetation, but the truth was the opposite.</p><p>Vegetation could be seen here from time to time.</p><p>All kinds of fiery red vegetation were rooted in the hot ground. Some of them were even rooted in the lava.</p><p>“That’s the flowing flame wood, and the Fire Stone grass …”</p><p>Not long after they arrived on this land, Lu Ming discovered several kinds of Emperor’s medicine. They were all very valuable and were taken away by the three of them.</p><p>This Land of Fire was simply a treasure land. The three of them began to search with blazing eyes.</p><p>A few days later, each of the three of them had obtained more than ten Emperor’s herbs.</p><p>One day, the three of them suddenly stopped after crossing a mountain.</p><p>That was because a few figures had appeared in the canyon ahead. The three of them quickly hid and watched from afar.</p><p>The evil god race!</p><p>The valley was filled with the evil god tribe, and there were a total of five of them.</p><p>In the canyon, there was a pitch-black cave. The five members of the evil god race were pacing back and forth outside the cave, and their bodies were emitting powerful auras.</p><p>“Three two star great emperors and two one star great emperors!”</p><p>Wu Bo’s expression was grave as he muttered.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, these five members of the evil god tribe have been loitering outside the cave. 1 reckon that there must be some treasure in the cave. We can’t miss such an opportunity. However, the other party has three two star great emperors and two one star great emperors. They are much stronger than us. We can’t deal with them!”</p><p>brother Lu Ming, why don’t you take out that puppet and kill these five members of the evil god race? if there are really treasures, you can take the biggest share!</p><p>Wu Xiu said.</p><p>this plan won’t work. Let’s just observe for a while!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Wu Xiu and Wu Bo looked at each other again, and a bright light flashed in their eyes.</p><p>The three of them waited quietly..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
