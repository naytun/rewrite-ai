At this moment, Tian Ming was actually starting to gain the upper hand.</p><p>“Tianming, what terrifying combat strength. He can actually suppress on Yeming!”</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>One must know that ou yabing was the strongest illusionary Emperor among the younger generation in the heaven realm!</p><p>Back then, although he was defeated by Lu Ming, it was only because Lu Ming was too freakish and not because ou Yibing was weak.</p><p>And now, even destiny was able to suppress ou Yibing!</p><p>Tianming, as expected of the second-ranked genius of the primordial realm. He’s too shocking, and his talent is terrifying!</p><p>that’s right. If the primordial realm had not produced an even more abnormal Lu Ming, he would have been invincible!</p><p>“The laws of fate, every single one of them is abnormal. Once they grow, their achievements will be limitless!”</p><p>The surroundings were filled with the sound of discussion.</p><p>Many people sighed. Destiny talent was terrifying, in the future, he would definitely be able to stand shoulder to shoulder with the nine-Jue and even surpass some of the nine-Jue. However, everyone thought of Lu Ming immediately.</p><p>Although destiny was strong, it was still suppressed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Everyone sighed. It was not that destiny was not strong, but Lu Ming was too abnormal and could not be understood with common sense.</p><p>“Ah!11</p><p>Ou yabing roared in anger. He was actually being suppressed by the heavenly fate. He was unwilling to accept this and wanted to erupt with all his strength. He attacked madly, wanting to turn the situation around.</p><p>He formed all kinds of divine weapons and attacked Tian Ming. Unfortunately, these divine weapons kept exploding and shattering under the attack of Tian Ming.</p><p>The more Tianming fought, the stronger he became. His advantage continued to increase and he completely suppressed ou Yeming!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In the end, ou yabing was sent flying. He spat out a large mouthful of blood as he was sent flying out of the battle stage.</p><p>Ou yabing had been defeated!</p><p>This heaven’s favorite, who had been known as the number one void Emperor, had been defeated once again.</p><p>what powerful strength. The primordial realm really produced a few prodigies!</p><p>“Other than Lu Ming, Tianming should be the strongest among the void thearchs!”</p><p>“Yes, among the void emperors, no one is a match!”</p><p>Many people were discussing that Tianming’s reputation had reached its peak.</p><p>Some of the nine absolutes looked at Tianming with a serious expression.</p><p>When Tianming became a true Emperor in the future, he would definitely be a huge threat to them.</p><p>However, Xuanyuan Yi and Lin Xiaofeng’s eyes were calm and revealed great confidence.</p><p>Tianming didn’t continue the challenge. He left the fighting ring and returned to his seat.</p><p>“Now, it’s time for the battle between the nine absolutes!”</p><p>Many people thought in their hearts and became more and more expectant.</p><p>However, at this moment, a small figure appeared on the fighting ring in a flash.</p><p>“That is … A space-time spirit mouse!”</p><p>Many people”s eyes moved.</p><p>“Bubble!”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile.</p><p>Bubbles was about to make a move.</p><p>It had been many years since he had seen bubbles in action. Lu Ming wanted to see how strong bubbles combat strength had become.</p><p>The top ten warbeasts had amazing talent. Now that they had received guidance from a mighty figure of the heaven realm, their progress would definitely be amazing.</p><p>Bubbles gaze swept around and finally landed on Heng Xinghe and Yuan Xin.</p><p>“The two of you, come up. 1’11 let you join forces! Chirp chirp! ”</p><p>Bubbles pursed her lips, and the crisp sound reverberated throughout the entire area.</p><p>this guy is indeed going to challenge the star River and Yuan Xin!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Heng Xing River and Yuan Xin had a grudge against Lu Ming. In the past, they had been targeting Lu Ming. Bubbles naturally remembered it.</p><p>Heng Xinghe and Yuan Xin’s expressions turned ugly.</p><p>“Hmph, I alone am enough to deal with you, the one I defeated back then. Why do I need two people?”</p><p>Yuan Xin said indifferently and rushed up the fighting ring.</p><p>“You can’t do it. I’ll defeat you in one move! ”</p><p>He pouted indifferently, revealing a look of disdain.</p><p>“Hahaha, defeat me in one move? Ridiculous, simply ridiculous!”</p><p>Yuan Xin laughed crazily.</p><p>Bubbles actually said that she wanted to defeat him in one move. She couldn’t even fulfill her destiny. Who did she think she was? what a joke.</p><p>you make the first move. 1’11 let you make the first move. Otherwise, you won’t have the chance anymore, chirpy!</p><p>Paoba said, as if she did not care about Yuan Xin at all.</p><p>Yuan Xin was furious!</p><p>“Then I’ll fulfill your wish! ”</p><p>Yuan Xin shouted and rushed toward the bubble. At the same time, he unleashed his strongest combat strength.</p><p>Yuan Xin did not dare to be careless in the face of the space-time spirit rat. He used his strongest combat power in his first attack.</p><p>He was surrounded by all sorts of laws as he charged towards bubbles.</p><p>However, when he was halfway there, his body froze in mid-air.</p><p>The various laws that covered his body disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Yuan Xin’s expression changed drastically. With a furious roar, she once again controlled the laws, but rhe moment the laws appeared, they disappeared.</p><p>“Time law, it s time law!”</p><p>using time laws to control the power of time, traveling through time, returning to the moment when the other party didn’t use any laws. Therefore, once Yuan Xin’s laws came out, they disappeared!</p><p>“How terrifying!”</p><p>Many people saw the trick and were shocked.</p><p>This was already mobilizing the power of time. He was only an empty Emperor, but he could do this. He was indeed worthy of being a space-time spirit rat.</p><p>At this moment, bubbles appeared in front of Yuan Xin and kicked her in the face. Yuan Xin was sent flying out of the fighting ring like a broken sandbag and landed heavily on the ground. She spat out a mouthful of blood and her face was completely swollen.</p><p>She had lost. Yuan Xin had lost. Bubbles had really only used one move!</p><p>Many people were shocked. Bubbles ‘combat strength had exceeded their expectations.</p><p>Tianming’s eyes narrowed slightly as he looked at bubbles with a solemn expression.</p><p>“Useless!”</p><p>Paoba muttered, no longer looking at Yuan Xin. This caused Yuan Xin to spit out another mouthful of blood.</p><p>That was anger!</p><p>Today, Yuan Xin had suffered a huge blow.</p><p>He had wanted to defeat Tianming and take revenge for the humiliation he had suffered back then.</p><p>However, in the end, he was easily defeated by destiny. Now, he was defeated by bubbles in one move.</p><p>Back then, bubbles had been his defeated opponent. Now, however, she had defeated him with a single move. This was hard for him to accept.</p><p>Bubbles ignored him and swept his gaze across the remaining young men. Those who were caught by his gaze had a change in expression.</p><p>“Will he challenge the heavenly mandate realm?”</p><p>Many people thought so.</p><p>In the end, bubbles did not challenge heaven’s will. Instead, her gaze fell on ou Yibing.</p><p>“You, come out and fight!”</p><p>Bubbles pointed at ou yabing and said.</p><p>Ou yabing’s face was extremely dark.</p><p>Bubbles actually challenged him?</p><p>But today, he had to fight the challenge. He couldn’t back down, or his reputation would be completely ruined.</p><p>He stepped out and landed on the fighting ring.</p><p>although your space-time nomological laws are profound, it also depends on the opponent. If the opponent’s strength is greater than yours, your space-time nomological laws will not work. I’m not Yuan Xin. I’Ll use a powerful force to directly break your space-time nomological laws!</p><p>Ou yabing said.</p><p>Many people were moved. That was indeed the case!</p><p>&Nbsp; rhe spacetime laws were extremely profound and unpredictable. They could manipulate the power of time and space, making them terrifying.</p><p>However, there was no law that was truly invincible. When one’s power reached a certain level, one could break all laws.</p><p>As long as one s strength was strong enough, one could break through the spacetime laws..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
