Lu Ming took a step forward and his body merged with the stone statue.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of the sword reverberated through the sky.</p><p>A stone sword burst out with dazzling sword Qi and slashed out.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>The two fire-red crows that were surrounding Lu Ming were cut into two by the stone sword.</p><p>The two one star great emperor crows were killed instantly.</p><p>In the past five years, the celestial Thearch’s body had absorbed a large amount of energy, but Lu Ming had not used it. Now, the energy stored in the celestial Thearch’s body had reached 80%.</p><p>The power of eighty percent of the energy was already extremely terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming speculated that if the energy stored in the celestial Thearch’s body reached one hundred percent, it would be enough to compete with a peak great emperor.</p><p>Therefore, when the stored energy reached eighty percent, it was enough to kill an ordinary five star great emperor.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and controlled the celestial Thearch’s physical body. Rich energy exploded and the celestial Thearch’s sword seemed to be indestructible.</p><p>The sword howled unceasingly, and the ear-piercing sound of sword Qi cut through the void.</p><p>A few more crows were killed one after another, and even the two star great emperor Crow was killed in an instant.</p><p>This lightened the pressure on the others, and they revealed looks of ecstasy.</p><p>They did not expect Lu Ming to have such a treasure. They immediately looked hopeful.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>When the other crows saw Lu Ming cutting down a few of the fiery red crows, they immediately let out sharp cries and launched various attacks at Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>The twenty or so terrifying crows behind them also approached Lu Ming and the rest rapidly. From a distance, they flapped their wings, and their feathers were like sharp swords, shooting at them.</p><p>Lu Ming slashed with his sword. The sword ray cut through the void and blocked all the feathers.</p><p>“Charge out!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and took the lead to rush down, the others following closely behind.</p><p>The fire-red crows didn’t give up and continued to chase.</p><p>There were more than thirty fiery-red crows coming from behind and in front. They attacked Lu Ming and the rest with all kinds of attacks.</p><p>Lu Ming could only turn around and block the attacks.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming charged into the crows alone.</p><p>Instead of wasting energy blocking the crows ‘attacks, it was better to kill them all.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his sword and the sword aura was indestructible. In an instant, five fiery red crows were killed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The remaining crows screeched, as if they were extremely furious.</p><p>A few of the strongest crows pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming swung his sword and a violent boom erupted. He exchanged a blow with the few strongest crows.</p><p>A few crows were sent flying by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Three four star great emperors and one five star great emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Through the exchange of moves, Lu Ming could roughly judge the combat strength of the few crows.</p><p>Three four star great emperors and one five star great emperor … This was definitely a terrifying force.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The few crows retreated and charged at Lu Ming again.</p><p>“Then I’ll kill you all!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold. The rich energy in the celestial Thearch’s body burst out and rushed toward the crows.</p><p>Lu Ming completely ignored his own defense and attacked with all his might.</p><p>BOOM! boom! boom!</p><p>The attacks landed on Celestial Emperor’s body, but they only left shallow marks on it.</p><p>After all, the heavenly Emperor’s corporeal body was left behind by a heavenly Emperor realm expert. It was extremely strong, and even a peak great emperor would find it difficult to break it. Four star great emperor and five star great emperor naturally couldn’t break it.</p><p>As for the other crows, it was even more difficult for them to leave even a trace.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming did not care about defense and focused on killing. He slashed with his combat sword with all his might, cutting off one of the wings of a four star great emperor realm Crow. On the other hand, a two star great emperor realm Crow was swept by the sword light and was cut in half, its feathers flying everywhere.</p><p>The four star great emperor Crow cried out in pain. Its blood splattered in the air as it retreated.</p><p>How could Lu Ming let the other party off? he chased after him with all his might.</p><p>The other crows ‘attacks landed on Lu Ming’s body continuously and exploded with’ Dong Dong Dong ‘sounds.</p><p>However, it could only slow down Lu Ming’s speed slightly. Lu Ming forced himself to rush over and slashed with his sword, beheading the crow.</p><p>The soul in the skull was also destroyed by Lu Ming.</p><p>With a flash of light, Lu Ming kept the crow’s corpse into his small world.</p><p>A great emperor crow’s entire body was a treasure. Its value was shocking, and he couldn’t waste it.</p><p>After killing a four star great emperor, Lu Ming turned around and targeted the other crows, killing them at top speed.</p><p>Anyone below the four star great emperor level could not withstand Lu Ming’s sword at all. They were killed by Lu Ming and their corpses were kept in his small world.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Not long after, another wail was heard. Another four star great emperor realm Crow was killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>In total, Lu Ming had already killed more than ten fiery red crows.</p><p>However, there were still about twenty of them left.</p><p>After Lu Ming killed many of their comrades, the crows became even more frenzied. Those below the great emperor level pounced at Lu Ming without any regard for their lives.</p><p>Although these crows couldn’t break through the defenses of Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body, they could continuously drain the corporeal body’s energy.</p><p>this can’t go on. I have to kill the strongest crows first!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>The celestial Thearch’s body had stored eighty percent of its energy. Although it was extremely powerful, it was still being consumed at an alarming rate as it fought against the great emperor realm beings and the crows attacked it.</p><p>If this continued, it wouldn’t be long before the energy in the celestial Thearch’s corporeal body was completely exhausted.</p><p>If the energy of the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body was used up while the three, four, and five star great emperors were still alive, they would be in danger.</p><p>Therefore, before the energy of Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body was exhausted, he had to kill some of the strongest existences on the other side.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming ignored the other crows and set his sights on the existence above three star great emperor.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere and dyed the sky red. Two three star great emperor fiery red crows were killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>This way, there were only two fire-red crows above the three star great emperor level.</p><p>One was a four-star and the other was a five-star!</p><p>Lu Ming put all his effort into dealing with these two.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his sword crazily and attacked the two crows. Terrifying rumbles and continuous explosions were heard. The sky was smashed into pieces. The scorching temperature wanted to burn everything, including the space.</p><p>After more than ten moves, the four-star Crow was finally killed by Lu Ming. All of a sudden, only the five-star great emperor Crow was left.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming ignored the other attacks and charged at the crow crazily.</p><p>This Crow was as large as a mountain and had extremely powerful combat strength. Its sharp claws and wings were all-conquering and extremely terrifying.</p><p>However, Lu Ming happened to be its nemesis. He did not need to be afraid of its attacks. His combat sword continued to slash at its vital points.</p><p>Lu Ming had the upper hand..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
