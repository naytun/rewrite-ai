Coupled with the blush on her cheeks, she was even more moving.</p><p>Dongfang Xue Yu, on the other hand, was trembling with anger.</p><p>Lu Ming actually told her to get lost?</p><p>Who was she? She was the pride of her generation and her fiance was the number one pride of the divine land. Lu Ming actually told her to get lost?</p><p>He was looking for death, he was looking for death!</p><p>Dongfang Xue Yu roared in her heart. Especially after seeing Qiu Yue’s beauty, her jealousy grew to the point of madness.</p><p>Women were naturally jealous.</p><p>As for Dongfang Xue Yu, she had always been proud of her beauty. But now, when she was compared to Qiu Yue, she was completely overshadowed.</p><p>“B* tch, you dare to wear my hairpin? I’ll tear your face apart!”</p><p>Dongfang Xue Yu let out a shrill cry and her body shot out like a bolt of lightning towards Qiu Yue. Her claws were like blades as she slashed towards Qiu Yue’s face.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly and slapped him.</p><p>Lu Ming’s speed was so fast that Dongfang Xue Yu could not Dodge at all. She was directly slapped in the face by Lu Ming.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>A crisp sound rang out and Dongfang Xue Yu screamed out in pain. Her body flew out and fell to the ground, her face swollen.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming had shown mercy. Otherwise, she would not even leave behind ashes.</p><p>Dongfang Xue Yu was dumbfounded, and so were the others in the shop.</p><p>Lu Ming actually dared to slap Dongfang Xueyu. Did he not want to live?</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill him, kill this bastard!”</p><p>Dongfang Xue Yu was stunned for a moment before she reacted and screamed.</p><p>“Brat, you’re looking for death. Kneel down and admit your mistake immediately!”</p><p>There were two elders who had followed Dongfang Xue Yu. At this moment, one of them let out a loud shout and pounced towards Lu Ming. A terrifying aura burst out with a loud bang, and a powerful pressure pressed towards Lu Ming.</p><p>At the side, the others retreated.</p><p>A martial Supreme!</p><p>This old man was a Martial Emperor, but he was only a one-star void Emperor, which was the weakest Martial Emperor.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly and kicked the other party’s face at lightning speed.</p><p>The old man let out a blood-curdling screech and was sent flying, following in Dongfang Xue Yu’s footsteps. His face was now as swollen as a pig’s head.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>To be able to defeat a one-star great emperor with a single move… This kind of battle prowess was extraordinary.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming did not look very old. There were not many people in the entire divine destiny land who could reach the Martial Emperor realm at this age.</p><p>“Get lost. If you don’t get lost, kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly, his cold killing intent exuding.</p><p>“Lu Ming, he’s Lu Ming!”</p><p>Suddenly, someone on the side shouted.</p><p>Back then, Lu Ming had won first place in the battle of the ten lands and his reputation was well-known. Many people had seen Lu Ming before and now, he was finally recognized.</p><p>“What? Lu Ming? Which Lu Ming?”</p><p>of course, it’s the Lu Ming who dominated the first battle of the ten lands and won first place!</p><p>it’s him! He’s been missing for decades. I didn’t expect to see him again!</p><p>All of a sudden, the people around them started to discuss and size up this legendary figure curiously.</p><p>Lu Ming’s reputation was very well-known. As long as one’s cultivation was higher, they would have heard of the divine land.</p><p>The first battle of the ten lands was top, he was extremely talented but he couldn’t become an Emperor.</p><p>“So you’re Lu Ming, a useless body, a useless body that can never become an Emperor. How dare you hit me? don’t leave if you’re so capable. I’ll tear you into a thousand pieces!”</p><p>At this moment, Dongfang Xue Yu screamed again.</p><p>Oh, is that so? I’d like to see howyou’re going to dismember my body into a thousand pieces. I’ll wait for you here!</p><p>Lu Ming said and sat down on a chair at the side.</p><p>you useless body, trash, just you wait!</p><p>Dongfang Xue Yu let out a few shrieks and hurriedly left with her men.</p><p>young master Lu, you’d better leave quickly. Dongfang Xue Yu will definitely go to the Xuan family to look for Xuan Lin. The Xuan family is one of the strongest forces in Aeon city and their strength is unfathomable!</p><p>The shopkeeper hurriedly warned.</p><p>“It’s fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>It’s good that the matter is blown up so that the MU clan can make proper preparations.</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to give the other party time to prepare.</p><p>Seeing that he couldn’t persuade him, the shopkeeper shook his head and retreated.</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue started to wait leisurely.</p><p>The news here quickly spread.</p><p>The champion of the ten lands battle, Lu Ming, had reappeared.</p><p>Furthermore, he had even slapped Dongfang Xue Yu in public. This was no small matter.</p><p>Dongfang Xue Yu’s fiance was the number one genius of the divine land. Would the two of them clash?</p><p>Moreover, the Xuan family would not let the matter rest. How should Lu Ming deal with this?</p><p>Immediately, countless people who had heard the news rushed over and surrounded the shop to take a look.</p><p>“Xuan Lin is here!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not have to wait long before he heard a cry of surprise from outside.</p><p>A group of people walked through the air.</p><p>The leader was a young man. He was very handsome and wore a black iron battle suit. He looked very mighty.</p><p>This man was the number one genius in the divine fated land, Xuan Lin.</p><p>Dongfang Xue Yu was right beside Xuan Lin. At this moment, her face had already swollen and was covered in tears. She looked as if she had suffered a great injustice.</p><p>There were some people behind them, all of whom were experts from the Xuan family.</p><p>“Lu Ming, get out here!”</p><p>Xuan Lin came to the door of the shop and shouted.</p><p>“A three-star illusionary Emperor, about fifty years old, far younger than Tianming and the others!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not go out. With a sweep of his spiritual senses, he knew Xuan Lin’s cultivation and age.</p><p>A three-star illusionary Emperor at the age of fifty was indeed far inferior to Tianming Yuan Xin and the others.</p><p>“Qiu Yue, let’s go and meet this number one genius!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and walked out of the shop with Qiu Yue.</p><p>All of a sudden, everyone’s eyes were on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Xuan Lin’s gaze also fell on Lu Ming.</p><p>“How do you want to solve this?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Xuan Lin.</p><p>“Fight me!”</p><p>Xuan Lin stepped out and his voice spread far and wide, revealing a strong battle intent.</p><p>Many people’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Xuan Ling wanted to challenge Lu Ming.</p><p>One was the current number one heaven’s favorite, while the other was the number one heaven’s favorite from decades ago.</p><p>Who was the stronger one between the two?</p><p>“Who do you think is stronger, Lu Ming or Xuan Lin?”</p><p>it’s hard to say, but I think it’s Xuan Lin. Lu Ming can’t become a great emperor. His cultivation is stuck at the quasi great emperor realm for his entire life. No matter how long it has been, it’s difficult for him to improve. According to Lu Ming’s strength back then, he’s not Xuan Lin’s match!</p><p>“Yes, I think so too!”</p><p>Many people were discussing and felt that Lu Ming was not Xuan Lin’s match.</p><p>The celestial Thearch had personally said that Lu Ming could not become a Martial Emperor. There was no mistake about this.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was strong in the past, he could only fight with a two-star illusionary Emperor. On the other hand, Xuan Lin’s cultivation was at the three-star illusionary Emperor level. The law he controlled was also an ultimate law. His combat strength was extremely powerful, and it was not a problem for him to suppress Lu Ming in the past.</p><p>This was a collision between the strongest geniuses of two generations. In the past, there was no comparison. It was because Lu Ming could not break through in his cultivation that this happened.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
