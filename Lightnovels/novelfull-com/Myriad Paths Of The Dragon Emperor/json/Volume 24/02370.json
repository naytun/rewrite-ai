The Black Tortoise’s desperate counterattack was so powerful that if they were hit by it, they would definitely be crushed into pieces.</p><p>Everyone quickly made way.</p><p>The Black Tortoise took this opportunity to shrink its four limbs and head into its shell. Then, like a ball, it rolled into the distance and escaped.</p><p>Everyone looked at each other. They didn’t expect the Black Tortoise to escape directly. They thought the Black Tortoise would protect this place with its life.</p><p>Perhaps it was the effect of the World Turtle!</p><p>Everyone’s eyes looked at dandan as they guessed in their hearts.</p><p>The Black Tortoise might have been frightened by the divine turtle of the world and was seriously injured, which was why it escaped.</p><p>Dandan had been adventuring in the heaven realm over the years, and many people already knew his name.</p><p>haha, the Black Tortoise has escaped. Let’s go in!</p><p>Someone laughed and rushed toward the arched door.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>damn it! the people from the evil god race roared in anger. They had thought that they would have the upper hand, but they didn’t expect that the heaven realm would have the upper hand instead.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>The people from the evil god race were anxious and attacked with all their might. In an instant, the injuries of the Azure Dragon became even more serious, and even its dragon claws were cut off.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest had already arrived at the entrance.</p><p>The arched door was extremely huge and was at least 10000 meters tall. The few hundred of them could easily pass through it.</p><p>Their eyes were burning with passion as they charged into the arched door.</p><p>At this moment, dandan had already transformed into her human form. Together with Lu Ming, she also rushed into the arch.</p><p>Behind the arched door was a mountain. In front of them, there was a stone ladder that led to the top of the mountain.</p><p>As soon as they entered the arch, they immediately felt a terrifying pressure.</p><p>This pressure was similar to the pressure in other places on the island and could suppress the heavenly Dao. However, it was even stronger here.</p><p>In other places, they could still fly, but here, they found that they could not fly, and even walking was difficult.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Someone took a step forward and climbed up the stone stairs with great difficulty.</p><p>Since he couldn’t fly, he could only walk.</p><p>Lu Ming and dandan also climbed up the stone stairs.</p><p>The pressure was too strong, and their walking speed was very slow.</p><p>Only the peak emperors were the fastest and climbed up one step at a time.</p><p>Some of the four star great emperors were as slow as a snail. Lu Ming’s speed was above average among these people.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you can’t keep up with your speed!”</p><p>Dandan took a few steps and her speed was no slower than peak great emperors.</p><p>“Dandan, you’ve reached the peak great emperor realm?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“No, I’m a six star great emperor, but I’m definitely not weaker than them!”</p><p>Dandan said with confidence.</p><p>Everyone used all their strength to climb up, but not long after, the evil god tribesmen still rushed in. Clearly, they had also dealt with the Azure Dragon.</p><p>Eight or nine hundred evil god race members also started to climb, but they were also under great pressure. However, some peak great emperors were still very fast and kept moving forward. Soon, they surpassed the four star great emperors of the heaven realm.</p><p>“What’s that? A statue!”</p><p>After walking for a while, they saw a body at the end of the stone stairs. It was obviously a statue.</p><p>The statue was of a middle-aged man. Although it was just a statue, it still had a domineering and Supreme aura.</p><p>“That pressure seems to be coming from that statue!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>He really did have this feeling. It was as if the pressure was coming from that statue, and it was even spreading across the entire Island.</p><p>After a while, the peak Emperor of the heaven realm who was at the front had finished walking the stone stairs. He walked to the top and disappeared.</p><p>Everyone became anxious and climbed with all their might.</p><p>A moment later, Lu Ming finally reached the end of the stone staircase, at the top.</p><p>There were also some peak great emperor experts from the evil god tribe who were similar to him.</p><p>At the end of the stone stairs was the peak of the mountain. However, there was nothing there except for a statue.</p><p>The statue exuded a terrifying pressure.</p><p>The dozen peak great emperors from the heaven realm who were the first to step onto the stone stairs stood under the statue with dark expressions.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Here, the pressure was even stronger. Every step he took would cause the ground to rumble.</p><p>“What’s going on? What did you get here?”</p><p>An expert from the evil god tribe was forcing an expert from the heaven realm to answer.</p><p>there’s nothing here. Other than this statue, there’s nothing else here!</p><p>A peak great emperor from the heaven realm said.</p><p>“There’s nothing!”</p><p>The evil god tribe’s expert’s face turned dark.</p><p>They had borrowed the heaven Dao soldiers and spent a lot of effort to come here, but in the end, there was nothing. It would be strange if they looked good.</p><p>“This statue … What kind of race is it?”</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he was sizing up the statue curiously.</p><p>He could now confirm that the terrifying pressure that could suppress the heavenly Dao on the entire Island was coming from this statue.</p><p>It was just a statue, yet it was able to emit such a terrifying pressure. It was truly shocking. Needless to say, this statue was most likely carved of the master of the void God Island, that Supreme existence.</p><p>In fact, it was even carved by that Supreme existence himself.</p><p>Moreover, the statue looked very strange.</p><p>This statue was in the form of an adult. It was a handsome middle-aged man.</p><p>However, there was a pair of snow-white wings on his back. The wings were full of snow-white feathers, and when they were spread out, they were full of pressure.</p><p>He pressed his hands on the hilt of a huge combat sword, which was stuck in the ground.</p><p>“Could the master of this statue be a bird-type divine beast?”</p><p>Lu Ming made a guess.</p><p>that’s not right. Normally, if a divine beast leaves a statue, it will leave a statue of its divine beast body. However, a human-shaped creature with wings like this one will not leave a statue like this. 1 speculate that this existence’s body looks like this!</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>“The original body is like this? There doesn’t seem to be such a race in the heaven realm and the primordial realm. There shouldn’t be such a race in the evil god tribe either!”</p><p>Lu Ming was full of questions.</p><p>maybe it’s a race that has appeared in the past countless years, or maybe it’s from another world. No one knows if there are other worlds in the world besides the heaven realm, the primordial realm, and the evil god Realm!</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>“Other worlds?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled and his imagination ran wild.</p><p>While they were chatting and observing, more people climbed up the stone stairs and looked around curiously.</p><p>Unfortunately, he gained nothing.</p><p>There was really nothing on the peak of the mountain other than this statue.</p><p>After half an hour, everyone from the heaven realm and the evil god tribe had reached the top of the mountain. They stood on both sides and were on guard against each other..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
