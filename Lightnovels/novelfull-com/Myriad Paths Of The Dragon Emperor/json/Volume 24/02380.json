We’re not at the point where we can’t rest until one of us dies with Lu Ming. Therefore, we should ask for his forgiveness. We should make peace with him and resolve the grievances between us. This is the best plan!</p><p>The LAN clan’s old ancestor said.</p><p>we’re asking for forgiveness. Lu Ming has killed so many of our people. We’re still asking for forgiveness!</p><p>Lan Cheng shouted in disbelief.</p><p>Back then, in the Blue Moon City, not only did Lu Ming ruin their plan, but he also killed the LAN family’s top genius, LAN Yun, and many of their true emperors in public.</p><p>And this time, on the void God Island, Lu Ming had killed many great emperors from the LAN clan.</p><p>The LAN family had suffered heavy losses!</p><p>Now, the LAN family actually wanted to ask Lu Ming for forgiveness?</p><p>They found it hard to accept.</p><p>“If we don’t do this, do you have any better ideas?”</p><p>The LAN family’s ancestor said coldly.</p><p>Lan Cheng and the others looked confused.</p><p>Indeed, other than that, did they have any better ideas?</p><p>Lu Ming is a world-shaking genius with unparalleled destiny. He’s the main character who suppresses an era. Such a person has appeared in history before. Once you make an enemy of such a person, you have to kill him before he grows up. Otherwise, you’ll be the one who dies!</p><p>“Now, Lu Ming has already become powerful and he has a large number of powerhouses behind him. At this point, it’s unwise to make an enemy of him. It’s foolish and suicidal. The best strategy now is to resolve the grudges with him. Only then can the LAN family continue to survive!”</p><p>otherwise, the LAN family will be like those forces that have been destroyed and will disappear forever in the long river of history. Pass on my order. Prepare a valuable gift and ask for Lu Ming’s forgiveness!</p><p>The LAN family’s patriarch immediately gave the order.</p><p>One day, Lu Ming was cultivating when the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor came to look for him.</p><p>The Heng Yu heavenly Emperor looked at Lu Ming with a strange expression.</p><p>“Senior Hengyu, what’s the matter?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s hair stood on end under the Hengyu heavenly Emperor’s gaze.</p><p>hahaha, of course it’s something good. Just now, the LAN family and Lan Cheng asked me to pass on a message to you. The LAN family and Yan family want to apologize to you and prepare a generous gift for your forgiveness. They want to resolve their grudges with you!</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu said with a smile.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned when he heard that. His expression turned strange.</p><p>He did not expect that the LAN family would actually ask for his forgiveness and resolve their grudges.</p><p>He had thought that the LAN family would secretly send people to kill him.</p><p>“The LAN family’s people are quite bold!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>It was obvious that the LAN family had already found out about the incident on the void God Island. They must have been shocked by his improvement speed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s rate of improvement was too terrifying. If this continued, it would not be long before he became an unparalleled figure.</p><p>The LAN family was afraid!</p><p>“Haha, I didn’t expect that the LAN family would have such a day. This is a big matter. Lu Ming, what does he plan to do? Do you accept or not?”</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu said with a smile.</p><p>“Since they’re so sincere, why not accept it? however, I have conditions. Senior Hengyu, please help me pass a message to the LAN family. It’s fine if they want to apologize and resolve the grudges, but I have two conditions!”</p><p>first, the LAN and Yan families, prepare 500 chaos gems!</p><p>second, the LAN family and the Yan family will announce this to the world. Then, in two world city, they will publicly apologize to me!</p><p>if you can fulfill these two conditions, I’ll agree to it. Otherwise, there’s no need to talk!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>To be honest, Lu Ming was not interested in the 500 chaos gems. He had more than 20000 chaos gems on him and more than 20000 primordial chaos stones.</p><p>500 chaos gems were just a drop in the bucket.</p><p>However, five hundred chaos gems were nothing to Lu Ming. It was enough to make the LAN family and the Yan family bleed.</p><p>hahaha, I’ll tell them your conditions now. 1 really want to know their expressions!</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu laughed heartily before turning around to leave.</p><p>Lan Cheng’s furious roar came from the LAN family’s main hall.</p><p>500 chaos gems? why doesn’t he just Rob someone? ”</p><p>also, tell the whole world and ask for forgiveness in public. He can dream on.</p><p>Where will the face of our LAN family be in the future? ”</p><p>Lan Cheng’s eyes were blood red, like a crazy Lion.</p><p>The Yan clan heavenly Emperor’s expression was not any better.</p><p>The other members of the LAN family also had ugly expressions, but they didn’t say anything.</p><p>Now, did they still have a way out?</p><p>The strong preyed on the weak, who told them to be weak?</p><p>“Agree to his request!”</p><p>The LAN clan’s ancestor coldly spoke.</p><p>“Old ancestor…”</p><p>Lan Cheng roared. He was extremely unwilling, and his eyes were red.</p><p>“If you want to die, don’t drag the LAN family down with you!”</p><p>The LAN family’s ancestor shot a cold glance at Lan Cheng.</p><p>Lan Cheng immediately shut his mouth. His chest heaved up and down rapidly. After a long time, he let out a long sigh.</p><p>Of course, he didn’t want to die. As a heavenly Emperor, he had no disasters and tribulations. His lifespan was endless. How could he want to die?</p><p>Previously, he just couldn’t let go of his face.</p><p>“What do you say?”</p><p>The LAN family’s patriarch turned to the Yan family’s celestial Thearch.</p><p>“Whatever the LAN clan does, the Yan clan will do!” The Yan clan celestial Thearch sighed.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>“Spread the word that the LAN family will seek Lu Ming’s forgiveness in two world city ten days later and resolve our grudges with him!”</p><p>The LAN family’s patriarch gave the order.</p><p>Then, a piece of news spread like a whirlwind in the heaven realm, causing a great shock.</p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded.</p><p>The LAN family and the Yan family actually wanted to apologize to Lu Ming in public and resolve their grudges.</p><p>An ancient family with an unparalleled expert backing them up had to ask for forgiveness from a junior. This had never happened since ancient times.</p><p>In the heavenly realm, there seemed to be an earthquake of more than a dozen magnitude in the Tai Qing heavenly region.</p><p>Everyone was discussing this matter.</p><p>There were also many people who rushed to two world city, wanting to witness this with their own eyes.</p><p>Countless people gathered in two world city.</p><p>Soon, the time that both sides agreed on arrived!</p><p>On this day, a huge public square in two world city was filled with people. Countless figures had gathered.</p><p>The human race, as well as the divine beasts and other races, had all transformed into human forms to watch the show.</p><p>damn, Lu Ming is really awesome. If I can reach his level, I will die without regrets!</p><p>In the crowd, the unscrupulous monk chanted the name of Buddha and said enviously.</p><p>“Master, aren’t monks supposed to be emotionless and not care about fame and fortune?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>“That’s the other monks, not me!”</p><p>The monk was very thick-skinned.</p><p>Around them, Long Chen, Feng Ling, Ouyang Wushuang, and the others looked at them with disdain.</p><p>They had also heard the news and came to watch the show. They also gathered with Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming is here!”</p><p>Someone shouted, and everyone looked in one direction.</p><p>On the other side, Lu Ming stepped through the air and landed on the square.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was the focus of everyone’s attention.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>A figure flashed and bubbles appeared on Lu Ming’s shoulder.</p><p>After not seeing each other for so many years, bubbles finally seemed to have grown up a little. She looked like she was four or five years old and was extremely cute..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
