In addition to the bubble’s time backtrack, it projected the other party’s memories. It was as if time had turned back as they were displayed one by one.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming saw an image.</p><p>It was the black-clothed man himself, and he was discussing some matters with a few others.</p><p>“The great emperor of the Heng family, the great emperor of the Luo dynasty</p><p>Lu Ming could tell at a glance that a few of them were the great emperors of the Heng family, the great Luo, and the he family.</p><p>There were two other people that Lu Ming did not recognize. Other than them, the remaining people were the Men in Black from the death god nation.</p><p>“It’s indeed the people from the Heng and he families!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a cold glint.</p><p>“Also, the MU clan!”</p><p>Although there was no sound coming from the memory, he could clearly judge what the other party was saying by the shape of their mouths.</p><p>Heng family, he family, Daluo heaven sect, Mu family, I didn’t go to you, but you tried to kill me time and time again. There’s no need for you to stay in this world!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>The memory images continued to flash back and forth.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>He saw what he wanted to see, and that was how to find the headquarters of the death god nation.</p><p>The death god nation’s headquarters was actually an underground city, an ancient underground city. Furthermore, this ancient city wasn’t stationary, but moving.</p><p>After a period of time, it would move to another place.</p><p>The way to the underground city was also very complicated. They would not be able to find it if they were just one step away.</p><p>no wonder no one has found the death god nation’s headquarters for so many years!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered, his eyes filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>He also wanted to destroy the death god nation’s headquarters.</p><p>“All!”</p><p>Suddenly, the Man in Black let out a loud roar. His entire body twitched, and he fell to the ground, foaming at the mouth.</p><p>the restriction placed on his soul spirit has been activated. His soul spirit has been destroyed and his nerves are dead. We can’t see his memory anymore!</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>enough! I’ve seen everything I wanted to see!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Bubbles finished her work and sat on Lu Ming’s shoulder to circulate her energy to recover.</p><p>Using time backtrack was very draining on bubbles.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you going to deal with the MU family and the Heng family first or the death god nation?”</p><p>Dandan asked.</p><p>let’s destroy the MU family and the Heng family first so that we don’t alert the enemy. The death god nation is in no hurry. They definitely don’t know that we’ve found a way to their headquarters!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming turned the corpses of the death god nation’s assassins into ashes and continued on his way to the heavenly Emperor City.</p><p>It didn’t take long for them to arrive at heavenly Emperor City.</p><p>When Lu Ming arrived at the Heng family and the he family, he realized that the two major families had already been deserted. Only a few people with low cultivation levels were left to guard the place.</p><p>“They’re walking quite fast. They’ve probably reached the MU family!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and then his aura burst out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s aura was like that of a prehistoric beast. His blood and Qi were boiling and it was extremely terrifying.</p><p>The terrifying aura was like a tsunami that pressed down on the Heng family’s Palace.</p><p>The remaining members of the Heng family couldn’t withstand this pressure.</p><p>They knelt on the ground in fear as if they were facing a God.</p><p>“Who is that? What a terrifying aura!”</p><p>it’s Lu Ming! It’s Lu Ming!</p><p>“What? Lu Ming, didn’t you say that he can’t become a great emperor? this aura is simply boundless and unfathomable!”</p><p>I’m afraid Lu Ming has already become a Martial Emperor. His cultivation is unfathomable!</p><p>the surrounding people noticed the situation and began to discuss in shock.</p><p>Obviously, Lu Ming had made some progress in his cultivation and was back to cause trouble for the Heng family.</p><p>This news spread like a hurricane. In the heavenly Emperor City, countless figures flew toward the Heng family.</p><p>The Heng family was surrounded by a tight crowd.</p><p>strange. Why isn’t anyone from the Heng family coming out? ”</p><p>there’s not a single strong aura in the Heng family. They’re all very weak. Could it be that the Heng family knew that Lu Ming was coming and all the experts in the Heng family have retreated? ”</p><p>“It’s very possible!”</p><p>“It looks like the Heng family will be destroyed today!”</p><p>Many people speculated and then became excited.</p><p>The Heng clan and the he clan were the two strongest forces in the heavenly Emperor City. They were usually arrogant and domineering with the great emperor in charge. The other forces had to give them face.</p><p>Now that it was really going to be destroyed, it was simply very satisfying.</p><p>everyone in the Heng family, listen up. From now on, the Heng family belongs to me. All of you, leave. I’ll give you one hour. If you don’t leave, I’ll kill you without mercy!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming spoke, his voice spreading to every corner.</p><p>They were all weaklings. Lu Ming did not bother to attack them.</p><p>This was because there were too many of these weak people. There were hundreds of thousands or even millions of them.</p><p>Lu Ming was not a bloodthirsty person and he would not kill these weaklings.</p><p>If he wanted to kill, he would kill the strongest group of people.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The Heng family members did not hesitate. As soon as Lu Ming finished speaking, they rushed out of the Heng family.</p><p>Facing an enemy like Lu Ming, it was impossible for them to resist given their cultivation. If they resisted, they would only be met with death.</p><p>The higher-ups of the Heng family had already left, so there was no need for them to protect the Heng family with their lives.</p><p>Not long after, not a single person was left.</p><p>“Dandan, help me set up the formation!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to dandan.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Dandan nodded, her figure moved, and she flew out. She waved her hands, and endless runes filled the air.</p><p>This time, it took three days to set up the formation. A huge formation was formed, covering the endless Palace of the Heng family.</p><p>With dandan’s current cultivation, it took her three days to set up the formation. Unless the heavenly Emperor came, no one could break it.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming entered the small world and discussed with Xie Luan, the valley master of Cloud Dragon Valley, and the others about sending people to guard the Heng family.</p><p>In the end, the cloud Dragon Valley master led the Dragon God Valley people to guard the he family.</p><p>“What a dense origin Qi!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master and the rest came out of Lu Ming’s small world and looked around excitedly. They felt the surrounding essential Qi and were extremely excited.</p><p>The heavenly Emperor City was the top of the nine cultivation sanctuaries in the yuan mountain. The cultivation environment was many times better than the Cang region.</p><p>They were naturally excited.</p><p>Moreover, the Heng family’s territory was wide and open. Although there were many people in Dragon God Valley, they could easily stay there.</p><p>After the arrangements were made, Lu Ming went to the he residence.</p><p>The he clan was the same as the Heng clan. All the experts had left, and Lu Ming easily occupied the he clan. He had dandan set up a great formation, and then Lu Ming released the people of Dragon God Valley, as well as his parents, to live in the he clan.</p><p>Although there was the path-understanding ancient tree in his small world, the original Qi of heaven and earth was far less than that of the heavenly Emperor City.</p><p>For the time being, the cultivation environment in heavenly Emperor City was better.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming did not intend to house so many people in his small world. He had encountered many dangers along the way and he did not know what would happen in the future. If he were to encounter danger, the people in his small world would be in danger as well.</p><p>“From now on, the businesses of the Heng family and the he family will be under my name!”</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming’s voice spread throughout the heavenly Emperor City.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
