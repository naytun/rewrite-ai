A few days later, the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor arrived.</p><p>Everything has been arranged and we can set off immediately.</p><p>Not long after, the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor brought Lu Ming along as they tore through space and rushed to a place.</p><p>An hour later, Lu Ming and the group appeared on a boundless ocean.</p><p>This sea was an inland sea of the Tai Qing heavenly region. It was vast and boundless.</p><p>At this moment, there were already some people waiting.</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze across the crowd. Apart from the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor, there were three other heavenly emperors. In addition to the three heavenly emperors, there were five other great emperors.</p><p>Among the five great emperors, there were elders and middle-aged men. Two of them caught Lu Ming’s attention.</p><p>Because the two of them looked exactly the same. It was obvious that they were twins.</p><p>The twin brothers had both reached the great emperor realm. This was extremely rare.</p><p>It was obvious that these great emperors were also heading to the void God Island.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes swept across the sea again.</p><p>Up ahead, there was a space that was extremely unstable. It was constantly twisting, and spatial cracks would occasionally appear.</p><p>This was the spatial tunnel that led to the void God Island.</p><p>On the way here, the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor had already told Lu Ming about the spatial passageway in detail.</p><p>In fact, two world city was not the only way to come to the Tai Qing heavenly region from other heavenly regions. There were two other passages from another battlefield.</p><p>There were also other hidden void passages that could lead to other heavenly regions. Some could even lead to other worlds, such as the evil god World.</p><p>However, these passages were usually extremely small, unstable, and chaotic. Usually, only one person could pass through at a time, and a little more than that could fit two or three people.</p><p>Any more than that would not do.</p><p>Furthermore, these passageways were extremely chaotic and dangerous. Even great emperors could get lost in them.</p><p>Only the celestial Thearch could pass through safely.</p><p>At the entrance of these passages, on the side of the heaven realm, there were naturally terrifying experts guarding it.</p><p>Although there was nothing in the surroundings except for them, Lu Ming was sure that there was a terrifying powerhouse guarding this area. Once a foreign tribe powerhouse crossed the passage, he would be killed.</p><p>Moreover, this kind of passage usually only allowed one, two or three people to pass through. If the alien races dared to come over, they would be surrounded and killed by the Masters of the heaven realm.</p><p>In fact, there were several such passages in the Tai Qing heavenly region, and they were all guarded by experts to prevent foreign tribe experts from breaking in.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were on Lu Ming, full of surprise.</p><p>He did not expect that Lu Ming would also want to Enter the Void God Island.</p><p>as people of the heaven realm, I hope that you can help each other when you Enter the Void God Island!</p><p>One of the celestial thearchs said as he looked at Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Naturally!”</p><p>“Definitely!”</p><p>The great emperors nodded one after another. Lu Ming nodded as well.</p><p>“It’s almost time, let’s go!”</p><p>Another great emperor said.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, a wave of energy enveloped the twin brothers.</p><p>At this moment, the space above the sea twisted and a spatial crack appeared. The heavenly Emperor’s figure moved, and he rushed into the spatial crack with the twin brothers, disappearing from sight.</p><p>This passageway could only allow three people to travel at a time.</p><p>The others waited quietly. After a while, another Celestial Emperor led two people into a spatial Rift.</p><p>The third group was a Celestial Emperor, and he led a woman in a Palace dress into a spatial Rift.</p><p>Only the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor and Lu Ming were left at the scene.</p><p>They waited for a moment.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s go!”</p><p>The eternal universe heavenly Emperor waved his hand and a wave of energy enveloped Lu Ming. In a flash, he brought Lu Ming into a spatial Rift.</p><p>As soon as they entered the spatial Rift, endless spatial storms swept toward them. The eternal universe heavenly Emperor ignored them and rushed into the spatial storm. Soon, they passed through the spatial storm and arrived at a small void passageway.</p><p>This void passage was extremely small, and it could only allow three people to walk in at most. It was surrounded by chaos and darkness, and a powerful pressure was pressing down on them.</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu brought Lu Ming along at an astonishing speed. They flew past the void around them.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, the path ahead suddenly became a dead end, turning into darkness.</p><p>The void passage was broken.</p><p>The Heng Yu heavenly Emperor brought Lu Ming to a stop. He closed his eyes and sensed carefully. Suddenly, the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor brought Lu Ming to the right and broke through the darkness. After a while, they arrived at another void passageway.</p><p>Only the powerhouses of the heavenly Emperor realm could sense it and find the right path. If it were an ordinary person, even a great emperor, he would probably be lost in the dark void. If he was unlucky, he would never be able to get out and would be forever wandering in the dark void.</p><p>Just like that, he walked and stopped. A few days passed. Suddenly, a bright light came from the front.</p><p>In the eternally silent dark void, there was actually a glow. Lu Ming was slightly shocked. At the same time, he knew that he was about to reach his destination.</p><p>Sure enough, in the next moment, they entered the void tunnel and came to a vacuum area.</p><p>Yes, this area seemed to have been forcibly opened up in the dark void by someone. There was no spatial storm in this area, as if it was the sky outside.</p><p>This area was shockingly large.</p><p>In the center of this area, there was an Island floating. From a distance, there seemed to be a sun hanging in the sky directly above the island. The light was scattered down from that sun.</p><p>The celestial Thearch, the twin brothers, and the others who had entered earlier were all waiting there. When they saw the Heng Yu celestial Thearch and Lu Ming, they nodded and flew toward the island.</p><p>This area was extremely vast and shockingly large. With the speed of the heavenly Emperor realm, it took them quite a long time to fly there.</p><p>When they got close to the island, they realized that the island was shockingly large.</p><p>It was not an Island, but a continent.</p><p>this void God Island is extremely vast. Some people have estimated that it might be one-tenth the size of the Tai Qing heavenly region!</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu said.</p><p>The others were secretly shocked. It was one-tenth the size of the Tai Qing heavenly region. This was only a human Daoist Rite temple, but it was really a big deal.</p><p>However, when they were a certain distance away from the island, the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor and the others stopped.</p><p>we can’t go any further. We’ll be suppressed by that pressure. Next, you can go on your own!</p><p>A heavenly Emperor said.</p><p>with your cultivations, don’t go too deep into the island. You can move around in the periphery of the island because many high-level great emperors have gone into the depths of the island!</p><p>Another advanced heavenly Emperor.</p><p>Everyone nodded their heads before flying towards the void God Island by themselves.</p><p>“Senior, farewell!”</p><p>Lu Ming bade farewell to the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor.</p><p>“Lu Ming, be careful!”</p><p>The Heng Yu heavenly Emperor said solemnly.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded, then turned and flew toward the void God Island..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
