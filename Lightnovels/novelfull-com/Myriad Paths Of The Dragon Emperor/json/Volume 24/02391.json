In an instant, they disappeared. They retreated?</p><p>All the onlookers were dumbfounded!</p><p>They thought that the elder of the Xuan family would make a move. They didn’t expect him to retreat.</p><p>Why would the elder of the Xuan family retreat? They were afraid of Lu Ming and did not dare to take action?</p><p>That’s impossible, right?</p><p>No one could figure it out.</p><p>Lu Ming did not pursue him.</p><p>His purpose in Aeon city was not the Xuan family, but the MU family.</p><p>If the Xuan family didn’t want to die, he wouldn’t care.</p><p>the MU family should have gathered all their forces this time. I hope the Heng family, the he family, and the Daluo heaven sect are also here. I didn’t come here in vain!</p><p>Lu Ming looked in the direction of the MU family and chuckled.</p><p>In the crowd, some people’s eyes flickered, and then they left the place.</p><p>These people were naturally the MU clan.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming and Qiu Yue strolled around for a while before returning to their residence.</p><p>The news of Lu Ming’s return, how he defeated Xuan Lin with one move, how he killed three true emperors with one punch, and how he even scared off one of the Xuan family’s great emperors spread rapidly.</p><p>Not only did it spread throughout Aeon city, but it also spread throughout the divine mandate land, shocking countless people who heard the news.</p><p>Lu Ming had broken through!</p><p>Many people knew that Lu Ming had already broken through to the Martial Emperor realm. The celestial Thearch’s claim had been shattered.</p><p>Would the Xuan family make a move on Lu Ming next?</p><p>Many people were guessing!</p><p>Lu Ming’s residence naturally attracted more attention.</p><p>Many people were constantly paying attention to Lu Ming’s residence and the progress of the situation.</p><p>There were even many people who had rushed over from other places.</p><p>In the meeting hall of the Xuan family, a group of people were discussing something.</p><p>These were the higher-ups of the Xuan family. Most of them were great emperor realm experts.</p><p>“Kill! We must kill Lu Ming! Elders, please help!”</p><p>Xuan Lin shouted.</p><p>His eyes were bloodshot and filled with malevolent killing intent.</p><p>During this period of time, the news that he was easily defeated by Lu Ming spread like wildfire. His reputation had plummeted and was no longer what it used to be.</p><p>He hated Lu Ming to the core and could not wait to grind his bones and scatter his ashes.</p><p>I also feel that we should kill Lu Ming!</p><p>Someone else said.</p><p>“Ninth brother, tell us why you retreated!”</p><p>At the head of the table was an extremely old man. At this moment, he was looking at the elder who had saved Xuan Lin.</p><p>The elder from before was one of the nine elders of the Xuan family.</p><p>The nine elders frowned and pondered for a while before saying, ” “I can sense a terrifying aura from Lu Ming. I have a feeling that if I attack, I will die in his hands!”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The others were shocked, and Xuan Lin’s eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p>“How is that possible? Could Lu Ming be a threat to the Emperor? Even if he has broken through to the Martial Emperor realm, it’s impossible for him to break through to the great emperor realm so quickly. Impossible!”</p><p>Xuan Lin couldn’t accept this and shook his head.</p><p>“Could it be that Lu Ming has really reached such a shocking level?”</p><p>The other doyens all muttered, their gazes solemn.</p><p>The higher one’s cultivation was, the more accurate one’s intuition would be. A great Emperor’s intuition would usually not be wrong.</p><p>we can’t measure Lu Ming with common sense. Once he breaks through to the martial Supreme realm, he’ll be like a Dragon in the Sea. There will be no restraints. It’s not impossible for him to have the combat strength of a great emperor!</p><p>I suggest that we do not attack Lu Ming for the time being. We should observe the situation first!</p><p>The oldest elder said.</p><p>“I agree!”</p><p>“I also agree!”</p><p>The other elders nodded.</p><p>Although the remaining doyens and Xuan Lin wanted to attack, most of the doyens didn’t agree to do so, so they had no choice.</p><p>Time flew by and five days passed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s residence!</p><p>brother Lu Ming, I’ve found out that the people from the Heng family, the he family, and the Daluo heaven sect are all in the MU family!</p><p>also, almost all the great emperors of the MU family have returned to the MU family headquarters. They seem to be on guard!</p><p>Bubbles conveyed some information to Lu Ming.</p><p>In the past few days, bubbles and dandan had gone out to investigate the MU family and finally had some results.</p><p>Lu Ming arrived at Aeon city. Needless to say, the two groups of assassins from the death god nation had already failed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s abilities shocked the MU family. It was natural for them to gather experts to deal with the MU family.</p><p>it’s time. The MU family, the Heng family, the he family, and the Daluo heaven sect will all be destroyed today!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He then strode toward the MU family.</p><p>Lu Ming’s actions naturally alerted those who were paying attention to him.</p><p>“Where is Lu Ming going?”</p><p>his body is full of killing intent. Is he going to kill his way to the Xuan family? that’s impossible, right? ”</p><p>“No, this direction is not the Xuan family!”</p><p>In the dark, many people were discussing animatedly and secretly following behind Lu Ming.</p><p>Not long after, mountains and countless palaces appeared in front of them. This was the MU clan.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly took a step forward. In the sky, endless energy gathered and formed a giant foot that covered the sky. It stomped down on the MU family headquarters. The mountains trembled under the giant foot.</p><p>Lu Ming actually wanted to attack the MU family?</p><p>All the people who had followed him were dumbfounded and shocked.</p><p>The MU family was even stronger than the Xuan family.</p><p>What shocked them even more was Lu Ming’s strength. That kick was like the kick of a God. It was unbelievably powerful.</p><p>Great emperor!</p><p>This was the strength of a great emperor!</p><p>Everyone sucked in a cold breath.</p><p>Lu Ming actually had the strength of a great emperor. No wonder the patriarch of the Xuan family had retreated.</p><p>Figures flew out of the MU family’s Palace. They were terrified by the giant foot and flew everywhere.</p><p>“Impudent!”</p><p>A long howl came from the MU family. A huge palm flew out from the MU family and turned into a huge palm that reached the sky, clashing with Lu Ming’s huge foot.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The mountains trembled and the void collapsed. A terrifying force swept in all directions.</p><p>The giant foot and hand disappeared together.</p><p>A middle-aged man appeared in the sky above the MU family. His aura was extremely terrifying.</p><p>“The MU family’s head!”</p><p>In the distance, someone muttered as he recognized this person.</p><p>Oh my God, the MU family’s master is said to be a three star great emperor. He only managed to block one of Lu Ming’s attacks just now, and Lu Ming has already become so powerful!</p><p>“Quick, spread the news. Something big has happened. Lu Ming is going to attack the MU family!”</p><p>“Hurry up!”</p><p>Many people were discussing in shock, and the news spread out one by one.</p><p>Aeon city immediately exploded, and countless people rushed toward the MU family.</p><p>When the Xuan family received the news, they were also dumbfounded. They then sent experts to the MU family to pay attention to the development of the situation.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>After the MU family head appeared, more and more figures rushed out from the depths of the MU family.</p><p>Each of these figures exuded a vast and endless aura. The pressure of the great path filled the world. These were all great emperor realm experts.</p><p>There were more than twenty of them!</p><p>The MU family had more than 20 great emperors.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
