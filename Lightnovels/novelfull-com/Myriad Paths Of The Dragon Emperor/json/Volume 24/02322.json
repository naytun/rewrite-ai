Wherever it passed, the air was split in half, revealing a terrifying black crack.</p><p>This kind of attack power was invincible among the younger generation. No one could stop it. Even Lin Xiaofeng would be defeated by this move.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s expression was calm. To be honest, he did not take such an attack to heart at all.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The muscles and bones in Lu Ming’s body trembled violently at a rate of hundreds of millions of times per second.</p><p>The vibration of his muscles caused intense friction with the Air and Space. Lu Ming’s body dashed out and he threw a punch.</p><p>The fist once again collided with the halberd. With a violent boom, the halberd exploded. Lu Ming’s body swayed slightly, but he threw another punch.</p><p>The punch pierced through space, bringing with it a spatial storm that swept toward Xuanyuan Yi.</p><p>Lu Ming did not use the power of the world or other divine powers. He only relied on the strength of his physical body and the imperishable golden body.</p><p>Xuanyuan Yi’s expression changed drastically. His body glowed, and a heavenly halberd materialized in his other hand. He swung the halberd and blocked Lu Ming’s fist force, but he was forced to retreat.</p><p>Xuanyuan Yi was at a disadvantage, and his attacks were suppressed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s muscles and bones trembled. He did not even need to take a step as he charged toward Xuanyuan Yi.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming kept swinging his fists. The terrifying power smashed the space into pieces. Moreover, Lu Ming did not care about defense at all. He only focused on attacking.</p><p>Xuanyuan Yi roared. He wielded a heavenly halberd in each hand and slashed wildly, engaging in an intense battle with Lu Ming.</p><p>After a few moves, Xuanyuan Yi’s halberd struck Lu Ming’s shoulder. However, Lu Ming’s muscles and bones trembled rapidly, and most of the force was reflected back.</p><p>At the same time, the imperishable golden body’s defense also blocked most of the force. The halberd attack could only leave a faint white mark on Lu Ming’s skin. It could not even break through Lu Ming’s defense.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming’s fist landed on Xuanyuan Yi.</p><p>Xuanyuan Yi’s body trembled violently, and the sound of bones breaking came from his body. He retreated rapidly and spat out large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>Many people gasped in shock.</p><p>Lu Ming’s defense was too shocking. Xuanyuan Yi was no match for him.</p><p>The two of them had similar combat strength. Each of them had managed to land a blow on the other, but Lu Ming was completely fine. On the other hand, Xuanyuan Yi was severely injured.</p><p>“Number one in the world? With this kind of battle power?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. In the next moment, he charged toward Xuanyuan Yi and launched a new round of fierce attacks.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Outside the fighting ring, Lan Cheng was roaring in his heart. His eyes were filled with anger and coldness.</p><p>Xuanyuan Yi could not be defeated. If he was defeated, his plan would be ruined. Moreover, he would have to give 100 yuan to Lu Ming. He would not allow that.</p><p>A cold glint flashed in his eyes. He took a step forward and a surge of energy rushed toward Lu Ming along the ground.</p><p>On the side, the heavenly emperors of the other major forces sensed this, and their gazes flickered slightly, but no one said anything.</p><p>Just as the force was about to hit Lu Ming, heavenly Emperor Heng Yu snorted coldly and took a step forward. A force gushed out from the ground and intercepted Lan Cheng’s force.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two forces collided, and the ground suddenly exploded, creating a huge pit. The force was wanton.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>“Lan Cheng, as the celestial Thearch, you actually secretly attacked a junior. You’re really shameless. Or are you unwilling to give up the 100 stones of chaos because Xuanyuan Yi is about to lose? Since you can’t bear to, don’t say it in advance!”</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu said coldly.</p><p>Many people turned to look at LAN city. When they saw the gloomy expression on LAN city’s face, they came to a sudden realization.</p><p>It seemed that Lan Cheng had secretly made a move when he saw that Xuanyuan Yi was about to be defeated, but he had been intercepted by heavenly Emperor Heng Yu.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Lan Cheng roared in his heart, but he couldn’t do anything. He could only keep his face dark and not say anything.</p><p>At this moment, the battle on the fighting ring was completely one-sided.</p><p>Lu Ming launched a storm of attacks. He completely ignored defense and only attacked.</p><p>Xuanyuan Yi was no match for him. Even if he used all his strength to block, he wouldn’t be able to take more than a few moves.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s punch landed on Xuanyuan Yi’s chest, almost piercing it. Xuanyuan Yi spat out a mouthful of blood and retreated.</p><p>Lu Ming chased after him and threw another punch.</p><p>Xuanyuan Yi’s body was sent flying like a cannonball. Half of his body had exploded, and he flew out of the fighting ring towards the crowd.</p><p>Lan Cheng’s face was gloomy. With a wave of his hand, a force wrapped around Lan Cheng and caught him. At the same time, it helped Lan Cheng to heal his injuries.</p><p>He was defeated!</p><p>Xuanyuan Yi had been defeated. Lu Ming had defeated Xuanyuan Yi with an absolute advantage.</p><p>Everyone’s heart was filled with complicated feelings. They knew that an even more terrifying heaven’s favorite had been born.</p><p>The poor Xuanyuan Yi had just defeated Lin Xiaofeng and ascended to the throne of the first of the nine absolutes. He had not even warmed up his seat before he was kicked off the throne.</p><p>“Is there anyone else who wants to challenge me?”</p><p>Lu Ming did not look at Xuanyuan Yi again. He turned to look in another direction.</p><p>No one responded!</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was so terrifying that even Xuanyuan Yi could not withstand a single blow. Who else could be his match?</p><p>“Since no one is willing to accept the challenge, then I’ll be the first place this time!”</p><p>Lu Ming turned to look at Lan Cheng and said, master LAN, since I’ve won first place, the 100 chaos gems are mine, right?”</p><p>Lan Cheng’s heart ached. 100 chaos gems was not a small amount. Even for the large LAN family, it was not easy to take out 100 chaos gems.</p><p>He’d thought that Xuanyuan Yi would definitely win first place. Giving the 100 chaos gems to his son-in-law in LAN city would help him improve his cultivation.</p><p>However, he couldn’t bear to give away 100 chaos gems to someone else.</p><p>“Kid, Who are you? I know you used a disguising technique to hide your face. You didn’t even tell me your name and you still want to get 100 chaos gems. What a joke!”</p><p>Lan Cheng sneered.</p><p>He started to find excuses!</p><p>hahaha, Lan Cheng, you’re going back on your word. That’s not what you said before. You released the news that whoever ranked first among the younger generation would receive 100 chaos gems. Now you’re finding so many excuses!</p><p>I know that you must have thought that Xuanyuan Yi would definitely get first place, so you took out the 100 stones of chaos for him. However, you used the 100 stones of chaos as a gimmick to attract others and set off Xuanyuan Yi. You’re toying with everyone in the world like monkeys!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>nonsense! How dare you slander me? How dare you! Show your true form. I want to confirm your identity. Otherwise, don’t even think about getting the 100 stones of chaos!</p><p>Lan Cheng said.</p><p>“Alright, since you want to see, then go ahead!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. With that, his appearance changed rapidly and he returned to his original appearance.</p><p>His aura also recovered.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>After seeing Lu Ming’s original appearance, Lan Cheng roared..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
