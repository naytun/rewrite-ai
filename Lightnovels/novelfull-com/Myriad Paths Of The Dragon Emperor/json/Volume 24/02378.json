Let’s go back first!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright, 1’11 bring you guys back!”</p><p>The eternal universe heavenly Emperor nodded. Then, with a wave of his hand, he led Lu Ming and dandan toward the passageway that they had come from.</p><p>That passageway was also guarded by the celestial Thearch.</p><p>The Heng Yu heavenly Emperor brought Lu Ming and dandan through the passage and returned to the Tai Qing heavenly region.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you guys wait for me here. I have to go and bring the others back!”</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu said.</p><p>There were many great emperors that entered the island, but the number of heavenly emperors was limited. Naturally, each heavenly Emperor would have to make many trips.</p><p>“Senior Hengyu, how about this? we’ll wait for you in two world city first.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“That’s good too. You guys can return to two world city first!”</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu nodded before turning around and entering the passageway.</p><p>Lu Ming and dandan flew toward two world city.</p><p>Back when the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor had brought them from two world city, it had only taken them an hour. However, their speed was naturally not as fast as the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor’s. The two of them had flown at full speed, but it had still taken them two full days to return to two world city.</p><p>In Lu Ming’s residence in two world city, Lu Ming and dandan began to divide the treasures they had obtained.</p><p>What they split was mainly the heaven Dao soldier and the token.</p><p>The two of them took out all their heaven Dao soldiers.</p><p>The two of them had worked together to snatch six heaven Dao soldiers, and the other one had been brought in by the evil god race’s Royal clan. There were a total of seven of them.</p><p>The seven Heaven Dao soldiers gave off a terrifying aura, scaring dandan so much that she hurriedly set up a formation to cover up the aura.</p><p>In addition, there was also that token.</p><p>“Dandan, what will you choose?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at dandan.</p><p>Dandan’s eyes swept between the heaven Dao soldier and the token with a fiery gaze, wishing she could take both for herself.</p><p>“I’ll study this token first!”</p><p>Dandan grabbed the token in her hand and studied it carefully.</p><p>However, dandan had used all kinds of methods, but she had found nothing.</p><p>“Why would I?”</p><p>Dandan revealed a puzzled expression.</p><p>“Let me see!”</p><p>Lu Ming took the token and studied it carefully. However, he realized that there was nothing special about the token except that it was made of special materials and was sturdy.</p><p>“It’s a very ordinary token. Is it really more important than a heaven Dao soldier?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>Dandan was also scratching her head, unable to figure it out.</p><p>“Dandan, how about this, Seven Heaven Dao soldiers, each person will get three, each person will get four, but the three heaven Dao soldiers plus this token, how about it?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at dandan.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Dandan nodded, but her eyes were rolling around, obviously hesitating about what to choose.</p><p>“How about this, I’ll take three heaven Dao soldiers and this command medallion!”</p><p>Lu Ming was the first to speak.</p><p>“You chose this token? You sure know how to choose!”</p><p>Dandan gritted her teeth.</p><p>dandan, this token might not be of any use at all. You’ve studied it before. I took it out purely out of curiosity. Heaven Dao soldiers are so precious. You’ve made a big profit by letting you take one more!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Go, go, go, you’re trying to trick a three-year-old kid. This token is extremely mysterious, and it was taken out last by the formation spirit. It might contain the secret of the heavenly Dao. You want to keep it for yourself, kid, but don’t think 1 don’t know!”</p><p>Dandan gritted her teeth and stared at the token, reluctant to look away.</p><p>“Dandan, how about this, I always feel that I have some fate with this token. I’ll take it first, and if I discover any secrets in the future, I’ll definitely take you with me, how about it?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>He really couldn’t bear to give this token to dandan. To be honest, he really had a feeling that this token might be of great use in the future.</p><p>This was a kind of intuition!</p><p>Dandan gritted her teeth, obviously still reluctant. Finally, she gritted her teeth and said,” “Brat, if you discover any secrets in the future, you must tell me. Otherwise, I won’t let you off!”</p><p>After saying that, dandan began to pick out the seven Heaven Dao soldiers.</p><p>dandan, this spear is more suitable for me. You can choose the rest!</p><p>Lu Ming kept one of the long Spears.</p><p>Dandan was unconcerned. A heaven Dao soldier in the form of a spear was not of much use to him.</p><p>In the end, dandan chose four heaven Dao soldiers and kept them, leaving two for Lu Ming.</p><p>The remaining two items were a sword and a meteor hammer.</p><p>Lu Ming kept all of them, feeling satisfied.</p><p>This time around, he had obtained three heaven Dao soldiers. This was a huge harvest.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll be cultivating in two world city for this period of time. If you discover anything, remember to look for me!” He said.</p><p>After dandan put away the things, her figure flashed and she left the place.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled, then took out two storage rings and checked them.</p><p>He had obtained the two storage rings from the array spirit. Lu Ming was very curious about what was inside.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up as he used his spiritual senses to scan the area.</p><p>The items in the storage ring were all over the place.</p><p>Orirocks, all sorts of blacksmithing materials, pills, and so on.</p><p>“Chaos gem!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He found chaos gems in one of the storage rings. This time, there were a shocking number of them, more than ten thousand pieces.</p><p>This was an astonishing harvest.</p><p>“Also, the fragment of the great Dao!”</p><p>Next, Lu Ming found more fragments of the great Dao. They were locked in a box and there were more than a hundred pieces.</p><p>Even though Lu Ming was mentally prepared, he was overjoyed.</p><p>If this wealth was taken out, it would make people go crazy.</p><p>I’m rich, I’m really rich.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current wealth was already more than many of the heavenly emperors.</p><p>Three heaven Dao weapons was no joke. After all, most of the celestial emperors didn’t even have heaven Dao weapons.</p><p>this trip to the void God Island has truly been a great harvest!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>After cultivating on the void Island for seven to eight years, Lu Ming had made great progress in all dimensions.</p><p>Lu Ming had already cultivated eight of the ten ultimate maxims to the third realm. He had also cultivated three of the king path maxims to the third realm.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming had also cultivated the seven Gods mysterious technique to the middle of the fifth stage. His abilities had improved in all aspects.</p><p>what a pity. If I had cultivated in there for a while, I might have been able to successfully cultivate the remaining two ultimate maxims!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>Out of the ten strongest laws, he had only just started learning the law of cause and effect. As for the law of fate, he had yet to learn it.</p><p>The speed of comprehending the laws on the void Island was dozens of times faster than it was outside. Lu Ming was really tempted.</p><p>It was a pity that he couldn’t go in in the future.</p><p>“It’s already very rare for me to have such a great harvest. 1 can’t be too greedy!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and kept his things. He sat cross-legged and his soul entered the small world to begin comprehending the laws of karma.</p><p>Time flew by and half a month passed.</p><p>On this day, Emperor Hengyu had arrived. It was clear that all the great emperors who had entered the island had been brought out.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately recounted what had happened on the island to Emperor Hengyu..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
