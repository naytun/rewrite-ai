Lu Ming’s physical qualities had improved in all aspects.</p><p>Every cell in his body had been tempered and was extremely powerful.</p><p>Honestly speaking, with his physical body at this level, even without the indestructible ancient scroll, his life force was still extremely strong. Even if his body were to be torn apart, he would be able to recover very quickly.</p><p>Now, even if Lu Ming did not circulate the indestructible ancient scroll, he could withstand the burning of the liquid fire.</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and continued to circulate the ” Seven Gods mysterious technique ” to refine the liquid flame.</p><p>There was still some liquid fire in the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron. Lu Ming planned to refine all of them before he came out of seclusion.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another half a month had passed. Lu Ming had refined all the remaining liquid fire and his Seven Gods mysterious technique had already reached the peak of the early fifth stage.</p><p>However, without breaking through to the middle stage of the fifth level, the improvement of the physical body was limited.</p><p>Only by breaking through the bottleneck of the seven Gods mysterious technique could one’s strength soar.</p><p>!!..</p><p>If one broke through from the primary stage to the middle stage, their strength would increase dramatically. If one did not break through, even if one was at the peak of the primary stage, the increase in strength would be limited.</p><p>However, compared to before the breakthrough of the seven Gods mysterious technique, Lu Ming’s abilities had improved greatly.</p><p>Hu…</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a sigh of relief and ended his cultivation. He walked out of the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, which shrank rapidly and flew into the space between Lu Ming’s eyebrows, disappearing.</p><p>“With my current battle prowess, I should be able to kill two star great emperor realm experts!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>Before his breakthrough, he could suppress an ordinary one star great emperor with all his techniques.</p><p>Now that his Seven Gods mysterious technique had reached the peak of the early fifth level, he could kill a one-star great emperor with his physical strength alone. He could even kill a one-star great emperor who had mastered the most powerful great Dao.</p><p>Combined with his World Energy and various laws, he was now completely capable of killing a two-star great emperor.</p><p>“Wu Xiu, Wu Bo, don’t let me see you!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a cold glint.</p><p>Thereafter, Lu Ming exited the mountain and river diagram and went to the ground.</p><p>After reaching the surface, Lu Ming headed deep into the void God Island.</p><p>Lu Ming did not deliberately look for Wu Xiu and Wu Bo. The void God Island was too big. A month had passed. Who knew where the two of them had gone?</p><p>“Eh? The laws here are so gentle, and it seems to be especially easy to comprehend!”</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming stopped in his tracks, a look of surprise on his face.</p><p>He sensed it carefully. Indeed, the laws here were very gentle and easy to comprehend.</p><p>He didn’t have this feeling when he was in the land of fire and the desert, but now that he was in this normal land, this feeling was very obvious.</p><p>“Could it be because of that terrifying pressure?”</p><p>Lu Ming made a guess and felt that it was very likely.</p><p>That terrifying pressure was Supreme. Even the heavenly Dao would be suppressed, let alone the laws.</p><p>Under that kind of pressure, the laws became extremely docile and extremely easy to comprehend.</p><p>It was like taming a horse. In the outside world, laws were like wild horses with violent personalities. They were extremely difficult to tame, and naturally difficult to comprehend.</p><p>But here, laws were like docile domestic horses. They were easy to come into contact with, easy to tame, and naturally easy to comprehend.</p><p>Holy Land, this is a Holy Land for comprehending the laws!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with a fiery glow.</p><p>Lu Ming took a moment to gain some insight and realized that the speed of comprehending the laws here was at least tens to hundreds of times faster than the outside world.</p><p>For cultivators below the great emperor realm, this was the Supreme Holy Land for cultivation.</p><p>Unfortunately, the pressure here was too strong. True emperors couldn’t enter, but great emperors could. However, great emperors had already passed the stage of comprehending the laws.</p><p>This place could not be more suitable for Lu Ming.</p><p>The path that Lu Ming wanted to take was different from the rest. He wanted to comprehend all the other ultimate maxims before breaking through to the great emperor realm.</p><p>If it was outside, it would have taken a long time, but here, time was saved greatly.</p><p>To Lu Ming, this was a great opportunity.</p><p>“Let’s find a place and go into closed-door cultivation to comprehend it!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed an excited look.</p><p>In Lu Ming’s heart, the fragments of the great Dao and the heavenly Dao soldiers were not as important as comprehending the laws.</p><p>Lu Ming had no use for those things for the time being. However, comprehending the laws would greatly improve his strength.</p><p>Lu Ming really wanted to know how amazing it would be if he could fully comprehend all ten types of ultimate maxims and evolve them into great DAOs!</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming moved and flew forward. He planned to find a quiet place with rich origin Qi to meditate in seclusion.</p><p>Lu Ming’s speed was very fast. It did not take long for him to fly hundreds of thousands of miles.</p><p>As Lu Ming flew past a mountain range, two streaks of light suddenly flew out from the mountain range.</p><p>The speed of the rainbow was extremely fast. In a flash, two figures appeared, one in front and one behind, surrounding Lu Ming in the middle.</p><p>“Wu Xiu, Wu Bo!”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled up slightly, revealing a strange expression.</p><p>He did not expect that he would run into Wu Xiu and Wu Bo not long after he came out of seclusion. What a coincidence.</p><p>hahaha, Lu Ming, you’re really unlucky. The two of us were lying in ambush here to try our luck and see if we could bump into you. We didn’t expect you to really go in this direction!</p><p>Wu Xiu laughed, but his voice was cold and his eyes were filled with killing intent.</p><p>They had been searching for Lu Ming for more than half a month but to no avail. They decided to wait here to see if they could bump into Lu Ming. They did not expect to really bump into him.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>However, Wu Xiu and Wu Bo did not take action immediately. They looked at Lu Ming cautiously.</p><p>They had their misgivings about Lu Ming’s puppet.</p><p>Back then, they had witnessed the power of the puppet with their own eyes. They were afraid that Lu Ming would fill the puppet with energy again in the past month.</p><p>it shouldn’t be possible. That kind of puppet is so powerful. The energy it needs must be shocking. I don’t believe he can replenish it so quickly!</p><p>Wu Xiu sent a voice transmission to Wu Bo, his eyes filled with greed.</p><p>“Not bad! If that puppet could be used, I’m afraid he would have already taken action!”</p><p>Wu Bo also said.</p><p>Lu Ming had too many treasures on him. They could not give up. Their hearts were completely occupied by greed.</p><p>However, they did not make a move immediately. Instead, they slowly approached Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The aura on Lu Ming’s body burst out completely and nine types of laws revolved around him.</p><p>He still had the aura of a peak true Emperor!</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming rushed toward Wu Xiu.</p><p>“Lu Ming, no matter how strong you are, you’re only a true Emperor. How dare you fight with me? die!”</p><p>Wu Xiu shouted coldly, a vicious glint flashing in his eyes. His palms turned transparent as he charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>A transparent palm shot towards Lu Ming, and Lu Ming threw a punch at the same time. Seeing that their fists were about to collide, Wu Xiu was overjoyed.</p><p>Lu Ming did not use a puppet. He was not afraid at all since he was relying on his own abilities..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
