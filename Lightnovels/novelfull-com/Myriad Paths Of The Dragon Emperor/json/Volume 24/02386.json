A powerful force and Lu Ming’s own soul energy surged into the man’s sea of consciousness and rushed to his soul to search it.</p><p>However, when Lu Ming’s soul neared the other party’s soul, his expression changed.</p><p>This was because he felt a terrifying dark power near the other party’s soul.</p><p>When Lu Ming’s soul force approached, the dark energy burst out and devoured the man’s soul.</p><p>The Man in Black let out a shrill scream and his body struggled violently. In just a few breaths, his soul had disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Lu Ming’s energy was withdrawn and his expression was a little gloomy.</p><p>Someone had set up a restriction near the soul of the Man in Black. Once someone searched his soul, the restriction would explode and destroy the soul of the person being searched.</p><p>No wonder the death god nation was so mysterious. For so many years, no one had been able to find the death god nation’s headquarters.</p><p>At this moment, the Man in Black had completely turned into an idiot.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and threw the Man in Black away. He then fell into deep thought.</p><p>the death god nation wouldn’t attack me for no reason. Someone must have hired an assassin from the death god nation. Who is it? ”</p><p>in the primordial realm, the most likely ones are the Heng family, the he family, and the Daluo heaven sect. However, the death god nation is a huge force in the land of divine destiny, with many experts. The Heng family, the he family, and the Daluo heaven sect don’t have such power, so the MU family…</p><p>Many thoughts ran through Lu Ming’s mind as he deduced the matter, however, 1 can’t rule out the possibility that other forces want to get rid of me, or that it’s an expert from the heaven realm who wants to get rid of me. I have to investigate this matter clearly. The death god nation failed to kill me this time, but I guess there will be a next time. I’ll find someone to help me!</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming continued to move forward and entered the ancient Moon Holy Land. He returned to the Dayan elixir Palace to let everyone know that he was back.</p><p>Then, he used the divine breath technique to change his appearance and left the Dayan elixir Palace. He came to the passage he had returned from the heaven realm last time.</p><p>Through the passage, Lu Ming arrived at the Tai Qing heavenly region and directly sent a voice transmission to dandan.</p><p>Dandan was full of tricks and had many means, so she might have a way to find out.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming also sent a voice transmission to bubbles.</p><p>Bubble’s current spacetime law was already extremely profound, so she might be able to help.</p><p>Not long after, dandan and bubbles arrived one after another.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>Bubbles hung around Lu Ming’s neck the moment she saw him.</p><p>“Lu Ming, why are you looking for me?”</p><p>Dandan asked casually.</p><p>It had only been a short time since they last met, but dandan’s cultivation had broken through again and reached seven stars great emperor.</p><p>“I need your help!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Hahaha, 1 knew you had something to ask me for help. You’ve come to the right person. Tell me, what is it?”</p><p>Dandan grinned, looking very proud of herself.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately told him what had happened.</p><p>there’s actually someone who wants to harm brother Lu Ming. Let’s go and destroy them!</p><p>Bubbles was extremely displeased after hearing that.</p><p>“Brat, you want me to search your soul and find the mastermind behind this and the headquarters of the death god nation?”</p><p>Dandan asked.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“It’s very difficult to set up a restriction in the soul to search it!”</p><p>Dandan frowned.</p><p>“Didn’t you say I found the right person?”</p><p>Lu Ming was full of disdain.</p><p>Dandan’s eyes widened and she said,”what?” You’ve underestimated me. Let me tell you, although this matter is difficult, it’s not difficult for me. However, I still need the help of this little fellow.”</p><p>Then, dandan looked at bubbles.</p><p>“You need bubbles ‘help?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>“That’s right, we’ll know when the time comes. Let’s go!”</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>“Wait a minute, just in case, let’s get two more helpers!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. Then, he sent another message.</p><p>Not long after, the void flickered and two figures appeared.</p><p>The two figures were earth One and Thunder one.</p><p>Lu Ming was worried that there were powerhouses from the heaven realm involved. Therefore, he had called for Earth One and Thunder one just in case. “Greetings, young master!”</p><p>Earth One and Thunder one bowed.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately told him what had happened.</p><p>Earth One, Thunder one, the two of you enter my small world first to avoid alerting the enemy!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Earth One and Thunder one nodded and then entered Lu Ming’s small world.</p><p>Lu Ming asked dandan to enter the small world as well. He brought bubbles along and returned to the primordial realm through the passage. He returned to the Dayan elixir Hall quietly.</p><p>After returning to the Dayan elixir Palace, Lu Ming stayed for more than ten days before he set off for the heavenly Emperor City.</p><p>He was deliberately giving the other party time to react.</p><p>Lu Ming swaggered around without hiding his appearance and aura.</p><p>As expected, he encountered another assassination on the way.</p><p>This time, the death god nation had dispatched three experts with shockingly high cultivation.</p><p>One was a four star great emperor, while the other two were three star great emperors.</p><p>It was obvious that the last time the death god server failed in their assassination attempt, the two experts had not returned. This made them cautious, and this time, they sent out three experts.</p><p>Even a four star great emperor would be in danger if they were to be assassinated by such a lineup. There was a high chance that they would die.</p><p>Unfortunately, they had encountered Lu Ming.</p><p>This battle was also a crushing defeat.</p><p>The four star great emperor was killed by Lu Ming with a few punches.</p><p>The two three star great emperors were also severely injured by Lu Ming’s punches.</p><p>One of them had his cultivation crippled by Lu Ming. He had all his movements sealed and was thrown on the ground.</p><p>Lu Ming interrogated the other party. As expected, the other party did not say a word.</p><p>With a thought, dandan’s figure appeared.</p><p>“Dandan, what should we do?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>there are restrictions in their souls, so it’s very difficult to search their souls. Once any force approaches their souls, their souls will self-destruct, so my method doesn’t go through their souls!</p><p>every living being’s brain has countless tiny meridians. Some meridians are called memory meridians and have the ability to remember. My method is to control the person’s consciousness through an array and let bubbles use the time backtrack technique. Through the person’s memory nerves, I can see what happened in the past!</p><p>Dandan explained.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. Indeed, this method was definitely feasible.</p><p>With bubble’s control over the space-time law, it was not a problem for her to perform time backtrack.</p><p>“You guys…”</p><p>On the side, the three star great emperor who wasn’t crippled was shocked. He wanted to struggle, but he was stomped to death by dandan.</p><p>Then, dandan began to set up the formation.</p><p>One rune after another entered the other’s body.</p><p>A moment later, the other party’s eyes became unfocused, as if he was suffering from dementia.</p><p>“Little guy, attack!”</p><p>Dandan shouted.</p><p>“Chirp chirp!”</p><p>Bubbles made his move and a powerful Time Force enveloped the Man in Black. Then, with a wave of his hand, images appeared in the void.</p><p>These images were the memories of the other party.</p><p>For example, the scene of the other party ambushing Lu Ming and the scene of them on their way here.</p><p>The images seemed to be turning back time..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
