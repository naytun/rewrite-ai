The first was to deal with the death god nation.</p><p>The second matter was about the Hunyuan sect’s inheritor.</p><p>Back then, he had passed the Hunyuan sect’s assessment and obtained the position of the Hunyuan sect’s gold inheritor. At that time, he had received a list.</p><p>The name list recorded the inheritors of Hunyuan sect since ancient times, such as the silver and bronze inheritors.</p><p>According to the rules, these inheritors had to listen to Lu Ming.</p><p>However, in the past, Lu Ming did not dare to rely on his identity as a golden inheritor to look for these people and order them around.</p><p>This was because most of these people were at the Martial Emperor realm. There were even true emperors and even great emperors among them.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s previous abilities, he would most likely be slapped to death by these people if he went to look for them.</p><p>But now, it was possible!</p><p>Lu Ming planned to subdue all these people first, then he would eliminate the death god nation.</p><p>However, in order to subdue those people, he had to wait for a while. After the matter of Aeon city was spread, it would be much easier to do so.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest stayed in Aeon city.</p><p>The news about the battle of Aeon city spread like a hurricane.</p><p>Not only did it spread in the divine land, but it also spread to other regions. In an instant, a magnitude 12 earthquake occurred in the primordial realm. Lu Ming had returned in a domineering manner and destroyed the MU family, the Overlord force of Aeon city, in one fell swoop. He killed all the experts of the MU family and displayed his terrifying combat strength.</p><p>However, the most shocking thing was that in the end, a heavenly Emperor tried to kill Lu Ming, but he was easily killed by Lu Ming’s subordinates. Lu Ming actually had a terrifying heavenly Emperor as his subordinates.</p><p>Everyone who heard this news was shocked.</p><p>They knew that Lu Ming had defied the heavens and rose to power.</p><p>Back then, Lu Ming was declared by the celestial Thearch that he would never become a Thearch in this life. Many people called him trash and a cripple.</p><p>But how many years had passed? Lu Ming rose to power and his combat strength was terrifyingly powerful. He killed more than ten great emperors of the MU family alone.</p><p>That was a dozen great emperors. What kind of battle record was this? it was simply frightening.</p><p>The more terrifying thing was that Lu Ming had the celestial Thearch as his subordinate.</p><p>After hearing this, everyone was dumbfounded and speechless.</p><p>Everyone knew that an unrivaled figure had risen with unstoppable momentum.</p><p>Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, a month had passed.</p><p>In the past month, the entire Yuan continent was talking about Lu Ming.</p><p>it’s time. The first one will be the Liu family. They’re in Aeon city!</p><p>In an Inn in Aeon city, Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile. He then led dandan and the rest in a direction.</p><p>The Liu family was a powerful force in Aeon city, and their strength was not weaker than the Xuan family.</p><p>On the Hunyuan sect’s list, it was recorded that the Liu family’s patriarch was the Hunyuan sect’s inheritor. Furthermore, he was a silver inheritor.</p><p>The Liu Clan was considered one of the strongest forces above the Hunyuan sect’s inheritors.</p><p>The moment Lu Ming moved, he was immediately noticed by those who had been paying attention to him at all times. Immediately, countless people followed Lu Ming from a distance.</p><p>” Where is Lu Ming going?</p><p>“This direction seems to be the direction to the Liu family!”</p><p>“Could it be that Lu Ming is going to the Liu family?”</p><p>Many people were guessing.</p><p>Now, it could be said that Lu Ming’s every move touched people’s hearts. The Liu family had also received the news long ago. The entire Liu family’s higher-ups were alarmed. Some of the Liu family’s elders who had been in seclusion came out one after another.</p><p>The Liu family was in a tense atmosphere.</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to come to the Liu family? What was he doing? Could it be that someone from the Liu family had offended Lu Ming?</p><p>The higher-ups of the Liu family were extremely anxious.</p><p>Lu Ming’s speed was neither fast nor slow. Not long after, he arrived at the Liu residence.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming arrived, a large group of figures flew out from the Liu family. The ones leading them were all white-haired old men. They were all experts from the Liu family and there were more than ten great emperors. “Welcome, brother Lu Ming. I’m sorry for not coming out to welcome you!” The head of the Liu family stepped forward and cupped his fists repeatedly. He was full of smiles and was very polite.</p><p>Putting everything else aside, Lu Ming’s ability alone was enough for him to be polite to him.</p><p>Now, no one would treat Lu Ming as a young junior. Instead, they would treat him as a great emperor with unfathomable abilities.</p><p>“You’re welcome!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists casually.</p><p>“I wonder what is the matter that little brother Lu Ming has come to the Liu family?”</p><p>The head of the Liu family asked tentatively.</p><p>“I want to see Liu Gao!”</p><p>Lu Ming went straight to the point. Liu Gao was the patriarch of the Liu family.</p><p>“You want to see the forefather?”</p><p>Master Liu’s expression changed.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Can’t I?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Of course, but the patriarch is in seclusion. We can go and inform him. Brother</p><p>Lu Ming, why don’t you come in and have a seat first?”</p><p>The head of the Liu family said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and followed the people from the Liu family into the Liu residence. The Liu family immediately served the fine wine and delicacies.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. This was the change brought about by strength.</p><p>If he had not fought with the MU family, had not made a name for himself, and had no power, Lu Ming would have been killed by the Liu family’s experts with one slap if he had rashly gone to the Liu family and asked to meet their ancestor.</p><p>But now, the other party was going to serve him courteously, so all he had to do was wait.</p><p>Lu Ming, Qiu Yue, and the rest chatted while they waited.</p><p>They didn’t have to wait for long before the Liu family’s master and the others came over with an old man with a face full of wrinkles.</p><p>“This old man is Liu Gao. Greetings, little brother Lu!”</p><p>As soon as the old man arrived, he greeted him with a smile.</p><p>This old man was the Liu family’s patriarch, Liu Gao. He was also the Hunyuan sect’s Silver inheritor.</p><p>It was obvious that he had heard about Lu Ming. That was why he was so polite. “Senior is too polite!”</p><p>Lu Ming also smiled faintly.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, may I know why you’ve come to find me?”</p><p>Liu Gao asked, his eyes filled with doubt.</p><p>“Senior, do you remember what this is?”</p><p>A token appeared in Lu Ming’s hand. It was the Hunyuan sect’s golden inheritor token.</p><p>Seeing this token, Liu Gao’s expression suddenly changed, and he blurted out, ” Hunyuan sect’s gold inheritor!</p><p>“Senior, do you still remember the oath you made back then?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked with a smile.</p><p>Liu Gao’s expression changed rapidly.</p><p>With his cultivation, the oath from back then could not restrain him at all. He could completely break free from the shackles of the oath.</p><p>However, the person in front of him was Lu Ming!</p><p>He was a heaven’s favorite with unparalleled talent who had just destroyed the MU family, and he had several terrifying heavenly emperors behind him.</p><p>He had to be cautious.</p><p>“Liu Gao naturally remembers the oath he made back then!”</p><p>With that, Liu Gao waved his hand, and a token appeared in his hand. It was the Hunyuan sect’s Silver-ranked inheritor token.</p><p>Lu Ming did not say anything and waited for Liu Gao to continue.</p><p>Liu Gao’s eyes flickered, as if he was thinking. In the end, his eyes calmed down, as if he had made a decision.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
