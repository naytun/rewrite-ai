Otherwise, the LAN family would not have offered a hundred stones of chaos as a reward.</p><p>However, they were still shocked to see the third-ranked genius collapse at Xuanyuan Yi’s hands.</p><p>Perhaps, Xuanyuan Yi could really fight Lin Xiaofeng!</p><p>Lan Cheng and some of the LAN family’s older generation experts were all smiling. Lan Cheng, in particular, was stroking his beard with a face full of smiles and confidence.</p><p>Xuanyuan Yi stood on the fighting ring. He was tall and full of confidence.</p><p>He looked at Lin Xiaofeng, and a firm and confident voice came out of his mouth.</p><p>“Lin Xiaofeng, come up and fight!”</p><p>Xuanyuan Yi’s voice reverberated through the entire area.</p><p>“As you wish!”</p><p>As soon as Lin Xiaofeng’s voice fell, his figure was already on the fighting ring.</p><p>Lin Xiaofeng, more than ten years ago, you were lucky enough to win against me. Today, 1 will step on you and let everyone know who the strongest heaven’s favorite is, whether it is the heaven realm or the primordial realm. Xuanyuan Yi spoke with pride and confidence.</p><p>100 chaos gems, I’m definitely taking it!</p><p>This was Lin Xiaofeng’s answer, which was also full of confidence.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes fell on the two young figures on the fighting ring.</p><p>These two people were the strongest heaven’s favorites in the heaven realm and the primordial realm.</p><p>Their future achievements were limitless and unpredictable.</p><p>More than a decade ago, the two of them had a great battle. That battle left a deep impression on everyone and was still unforgettable. After more than a decade, the two of them were about to fight again.</p><p>Who was stronger this time?</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>A powerful aura burst out of Xuanyuan Yi and Lin Xiaofeng. Their auras met in the void, making a violent roar.</p><p>“Explosive divine slash!”</p><p>A heavenly halberd appeared in Xuanyuan Yi’s hand. The halberd grew rapidly and pierced through the clouds. Laws revolved around it, and its aura was astonishing.</p><p>Then, the heavenly halberd slashed down at Lin Xiaofeng.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of the blade resounded through the entire area.</p><p>Lin Xiaofeng’s sword was unsheathed, and a ray of sword light rushed up and slashed at the other party.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two terrifying attacks collided with each other, causing the air to shake and the fighting ring to rumble.</p><p>Endless energy swept out in all directions to the West.</p><p>Both Xuanyuan Yi and Lin Xiaofeng trembled and took a few steps back.</p><p>However, the two of them stopped and stomped heavily on the fighting ring. Their figures were like two rainbows as they rushed toward each other.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two of them collided in the middle of the fighting ring, as if two stars had collided.</p><p>The light of the blade and the halberd swept in all directions.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>Following that, the two of them engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two of them had exchanged dozens of moves, what a strong combat power. This level of combat power is already at the thirteenth stage of true Emperor!</p><p>that’s right. You indeed have the fighting power of a level thirteen true</p><p>Emperor. You’ve actually reached such a level of fighting power at such a young age. It’s really amazing!</p><p>Many of the older generation sighed.</p><p>In the past, among the younger generation, it would be considered good if one could become a true Emperor at this age, let alone reach the battle power of a rank 13 true Emperor.</p><p>This era was truly an era that made people go crazy.</p><p>The two of them fought intensely on the fighting ring. As they fought, their auras became stronger and stronger, and the combat power they displayed became stronger and stronger.</p><p>In the end, their battle strength surpassed the thirteenth stage of true Emperor and entered the fourteenth stage of true Emperor.</p><p>This made many people gasp!</p><p>Lin Xiaofeng and Xuanyuan Yi’s combat strength had already reached rank 14 true Emperor.</p><p>The battle became even more intense. The two of them exchanged more than</p><p>200 moves, but neither of them had a clear winner.</p><p>“Lin Xiaofeng, is this your maximum combat power? What a disappointment!” Xuanyuan Yi’s voice was heard.</p><p>“You’re only so-so, it’s impossible for you to defeat me!”</p><p>Lin Xiaofeng said.</p><p>“Oh, really? Lin Xiaofeng, today is the day 1 rise. From now on, I’m the number one in the world!”</p><p>Xuanyuan Yi shouted and howled.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The power of the heavenly halberd in his hand suddenly soared. The halberd struck out and collided with Lin Xiaofeng’s saber.</p><p>Lin Xiaofeng’s saber trembled violently and finally exploded with a loud boom. Lin Xiaofeng retreated rapidly to the edge of the fighting ring before stopping. His chest heaved rapidly as he looked at Xuanyuan Yi in shock.</p><p>“A rank 15 true Emperor. You’ve reached rank 15 true Emperor?”</p><p>Lin Xiaofeng said in disbelief.</p><p>The scene was also in an uproar.</p><p>Xuanyuan Yi’s combat power had reached the fifteenth level of true Emperor. This was too terrifying. He was so young, but he had already reached this level.</p><p>A rank 15 true Emperor was almost at the peak of the true Emperor realm. Once he reached the peak of the true Emperor realm, he would be able to break through to the great emperor realm.</p><p>Many of the older generation had to spend an unimown amount of time to reach this step.</p><p>Xuanyuan Yi, on the other hand, had reached this stage in less than a hundred years. It was too shocking.</p><p>The third place, the youth from the Blue Mountain, was only a tenth level true Emperor.</p><p>The difference between them and a level fifteen true Emperor was too great, terrifying, this is too terrifying. Is this Xuanyuan Yi’s true combat power? ” no wonder the LAN family is so confident. At this age, they have the battle power of a level fifteen true Emperor. Who can match them?”</p><p>the LAN family’s offer of 100 stones of chaos may seem generous, but they’re actually confident that Xuanyuan Yi will definitely get it and push him to the top. This is a brilliant move!</p><p>Many people discussed and admired the LAN family’s methods.</p><p>Lan Cheng stroked his beard, his face filled with a proud smile.</p><p>After this, the LAN family would have two geniuses among the nine absolutes.</p><p>One of them would be the number one genius in the world. The reputation of the LAN family would be even stronger and reach the peak.</p><p>In his hands, the LAN family would also become stronger and stronger.</p><p>Lan Cheng’s heart was extremely comfortable!</p><p>it’s a pity that Lu Ming is dead. He didn’t get the indestructible ancient scroll. What a pity!</p><p>Lan Cheng sighed in his heart.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, Xuanyuan Yi stepped forward, and his powerful aura pressed down on Lin Xiaofeng.</p><p>Lin Xiaofeng, I’ve said it before. This time, I’ll step on you and prove to everyone that I’m the number one in the world!</p><p>Xuanyuan Yi shouted, and the halberd in his hand grew more and more powerful.</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>Lin Xiaofeng shouted, unwilling to be defeated. He became one with his saber and charged at Xuanyuan Yi.</p><p>However, the difference in combat strength was there, and it was difficult to cross.</p><p>The difference between a level 14 true Emperor and a level 15 true Emperor was a real difference in combat power, not in cultivation.</p><p>The two of them exchanged a few more moves, but Lin Xiaofeng was completely outmatched. He was blown away and spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>In the end, Xuanyuan Yi’s attack landed on his body and he was sent flying off the fighting ring.</p><p>Xuanyuan Yi had won.. He had defeated Lin Xiaofeng, who was originally in first place!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
