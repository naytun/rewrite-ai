She actually forced back a royal member of the evil god race, who was a peak Emperor.</p><p>The eyes of the Royal member of the evil god tribe flashed with purple light as he stared at dandan and said coldly,” divine turtle of the world, that’s good. I’ll get rid of you today to prevent you from becoming a disaster in the future!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A brilliant purple light burst forth from the body of the evil god tribe’s royal tribe member. It was extremely dazzling, like a purple flame that was burning.</p><p>On dandan’s body, countless runes shone, and a world slowly emerged.</p><p>The battle between the two sides started at once!</p><p>But at this moment, the storage rings and bracelets that the formation spirit had poured out had all been snatched away.</p><p>“Don’t worry, there’s still more!”</p><p>In the air, the formation spirit chuckled, picked up the bag, and poured it again.</p><p>This time, balls of yellow light flew out from the bag.</p><p>This time, there weren’t many balls of light. There were only a dozen of them, but each one of them was ten times more dazzling than the previous ones.</p><p>Each ball of light was a weapon.</p><p>There were nearly twenty pieces, and each one of them exuded a terrifying aura.</p><p>That was the aura of the heavenly Dao!</p><p>Heaven Dao soldiers!</p><p>Everyone’s heart trembled, and their eyes burned with fire as they stared at the 20 weapons.</p><p>To be precise, it was nineteen weapons!</p><p>Nineteen heaven Dao soldiers!</p><p>“It’s mine, it’s mine!”</p><p>“The heaven Dao soldiers are mine!”</p><p>Many people’s eyes were filled with burning greed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Everyone moved at the same time and rushed into the sky.</p><p>Heaven Dao soldiers were simply too precious, and even many celestial emperors didn’t have them.</p><p>Everyone here was a six-star great emperor, and their next step was to break through to the heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p>Once he successfully broke through to the heavenly Emperor realm, with the addition of the heaven Dao soldiers, his strength would skyrocket, and he would be able to stabilize his position among the heavenly emperors.</p><p>Even if he couldn’t break through to the great emperor realm, he could still sell it to the celestial Emperor for a great price.</p><p>Who wouldn’t be tempted by such a treasure?</p><p>A terrifying battle instantly erupted.</p><p>In the previous battle, more than ten people had died, but there were still about sixty people left.</p><p>Sixty people, but only nineteen heaven Dao soldiers. It was destined that they would fight to the death.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>This time, it was even more brutal. The peak great emperors attacked with full power, and several six star great emperors were instantly killed.</p><p>Lu Ming and dandan also soared into the sky at the first moment and chose their respective targets.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming did not hesitate to summon the celestial Thearch’s physical body.</p><p>Lu Ming merged with the celestial Thearch’s physical body. His speed was extremely fast as he rushed toward a long spear.</p><p>There were three other people who were also charging at the spear.</p><p>Two six star great emperors and one seven Star great emperor.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and slashed out with the stone sword in his hand.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A six stars great emperor was hit by Lu Ming and was sent flying. He spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>The energy in the celestial Emperor’s body had reached 100%, and it was no weaker than a peak Emperor.</p><p>The other six star great emperor was also sent flying by the other peak great emperor. Then, he pounced toward the long spear with Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming was one step ahead. He stretched out his large hand and grabbed the long spear.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>die! the peak Emperor shouted and attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not Dodge.</p><p>This was the celestial Thearch’s physical body. It was sturdy and immortal with astonishing defensive power. Unless the celestial Thearch made a move, Lu Ming did not believe that any great emperor could break it.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The opponent’s attack landed on Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body, causing it to shake violently. However, it successfully blocked the opponent’s attack without leaving a single mark on it.</p><p>Lu Ming withstood the attack. He grabbed the long spear and kept it in the small world.</p><p>“Hand over the heaven Dao soldiers!”</p><p>The peak Emperor was furious and launched a storm of attacks.</p><p>“Don’t think I’m afraid of you!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly. He completely disregarded his defense and charged straight at the man.</p><p>The other party’s attack landed on Lu Ming, but it could only shake him for a moment. It did not stop and rushed past him, slashing out with its sword.</p><p>The other party was shocked and quickly retreated. However, he was still a step too slow and was swept by Lu Ming’s sword. A deep wound appeared on his body and he was almost cut in half.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly and seized the opportunity to attack.</p><p>Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body had 100% of its energy, and its battle-power wasn’t weaker than a peak great emperor.</p><p>However, the defensive power of the celestial Thearch’s physical body was astonishing. Lu Ming could completely ignore his defense. In this way, he could completely crush a peak great emperor in a head-on battle.</p><p>The other party was injured and his combat strength was weakened. He was not Lu Ming’s match. After a few moves, he was sent flying by Lu Ming and half of his body was cut in half.</p><p>The other party was shocked. He did not dare to fight with Lu Ming and retreated rapidly.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>At this moment, a figure suddenly appeared behind the other party. A palm covered in runes blasted towards the other party.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>run! the other party roared. He didn’t expect to be ambushed from behind. It was too late to Dodge.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The other party was hit directly, and his body was torn into pieces, dying on the spot.</p><p>A peak great emperor was killed just like that.</p><p>The one who killed him was naturally dandan.</p><p>Dandan had already seized a heaven Dao soldier, and that person had just retreated to dandan’s side, so dandan directly attacked the other party.</p><p>“Dandan, let’s join forces!”</p><p>Lu Ming flew over.</p><p>“Alright, there’s one over there!”</p><p>Dandan shouted and flew toward one of the heaven Dao soldiers, Lu Ming following closely behind.</p><p>Over there, a few people were fighting fiercely.</p><p>The two of them charged over and attacked a peak great emperor.</p><p>This peak Emperor was from the evil god race.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Dandan struck out with his palm, and countless runes filled the air. There seemed to be a small world in his palm, and it pressed down on his opponent.</p><p>The other party was shocked and quickly counterattacked.</p><p>However, Lu Ming also rushed over. He fought with no regard for his life. He completely disregarded defense and slashed out with his sword.</p><p>Being besieged by the two of them, that person was instantly no match for them. He was cut in half by Lu Ming’s sword.</p><p>The other party wasn’t dead yet, and he retreated in fear.</p><p>The two of them didn’t chase after him. One of them kept the heaven Dao soldier, and then charged towards the other one.</p><p>The two of them joined forces and were invincible.</p><p>The next heaven Dao soldier was also obtained.</p><p>This way, the two of them would each receive two heaven Dao soldiers.</p><p>The two of them joining hands had also raised the vigilance of the others.</p><p>Those who were on good terms with him started to work together, especially the peak emperors.</p><p>The 19 heaven Dao soldiers were getting fewer and fewer as they were all taken away.</p><p>“That fellow has obtained two heaven Dao soldiers!”</p><p>Dandan’s gaze turned to a purple-haired middle-aged man.</p><p>That person was the Royal member of the evil god tribe.</p><p>This person’s battle-power was shocking and stronger than normal peak great emperors.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming was very direct as he rushed toward the Royal member of the evil god tribe.</p><p>The energy in Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body was limited, so he had to end the battle as soon as possible.</p><p>Dandan’s figure flickered and she also charged at this person..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
