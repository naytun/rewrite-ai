They were almost scared to death, especially the rank-18 true Emperor expert.</p><p>He could easily kill two rank-17 true emperors, but he could not. Lu Ming’s combat strength was far above his.</p><p>“Run, run!”</p><p>The remaining people only had this thought in their minds. They turned around and ran. The one with a rank 18 true Emperor’s combat power was the fastest to run.</p><p>“You want to leave?”</p><p>A cold glint flashed across Lu Ming’s eyes. His six-feathered divine wings appeared. With one flap, Lu Ming caught up with the man who had the combat power of a rank 18 true Emperor.</p><p>Seeing that he could not escape, the rank-18 true Emperor turned around and roared. He exploded with all his power and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, it was all in vain. Lu Ming’s punch landed and directly destroyed the opponent’s attack. It pierced through the opponent’s body and the terrifying force tore the opponent’s body apart.</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out his hand and grabbed the other party’s world-core.</p><p>A rank 18 true Emperor was also killed instantly.</p><p>Many people were so shocked that they could not speak. This kind of combat strength was truly terrifying.</p><p>What was the combat power of a rank 18 true Emperor?</p><p>That was, one had to have an ultimate law and control nine King path laws at the same time to have the battle power of a rank 18 true Emperor.</p><p>Those who could reach this step were all top-tier heaven’s favorites.</p><p>Some people only comprehended an ultimate Maxim after becoming a monarch, but they were also terrifying geniuses. Their future achievements would be limitless.</p><p>It was obvious that the other party was such a character.</p><p>The hearts of Lan Cheng and the others were bleeding.</p><p>Today, they lost LAN Yun one after another, and also that expert just now. This was an absolutely unimaginable loss.</p><p>However, they could only watch helplessly as those people were killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and flapped his six-feathered wings continuously. He was extremely fast as he charged towards the remaining people.</p><p>Those people screamed and begged, but it was useless. It was too late for them to regret. They were hunted down by Lu Ming one by one.</p><p>Not long after, dozens of powerhouses had all fallen and the world core was dug out by Lu Ming.</p><p>what kind of combat strength is this? an eighteenth level true Emperor can’t even fight back. This is too shocking!</p><p>from now on, no one in the younger generation will be able to compete with Lu Ming. His opponents will be those of the older generation!</p><p>“The so-called nine absolutes can’t even withstand a single blow from him!”</p><p>Countless people were discussing, and their hearts were in turmoil.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>Stellar River, Yuan Xin, and the other prodigies who had grudges with Lu Ming were all dumbfounded. Their eyes were wide open in disbelief.</p><p>During the ten lands battle, although Lu Ming was strong, there was a limit to how much stronger he was.</p><p>Moreover, even if Lu Ming could not become a Martial Emperor, they were confident that they would surpass him and crush him in the future.</p><p>However, it had only been a few years and Lu Ming’s ability had already reached a height that they could not hope to reach. The gap was too great.</p><p>The current Lu Ming could kill them with one finger.</p><p>They were still at the empty Emperor realm, while Lu Ming could even kill a rank-18 true Emperor. They were completely incomparable.</p><p>he’s awesome! I’ll definitely follow him in the future!</p><p>The unscrupulous monk kept calling out.</p><p>we have to work hard too. Otherwise, Lu Ming will leave us in the dust!</p><p>“Indeed!”</p><p>Long Chen, Feng Ling, and the others sighed.</p><p>father, father, mother is right. Father is indeed unparalleled in the world! No one can compare to you!</p><p>Looking at Lu Ming in the air, Lu shenhuang clenched his fists in excitement.</p><p>In LAN city, the Yan family’s celestial Thearch, the LAN family’s patriarch, and the others were all furious and filled with killing intent. However, they could only hold back their anger.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The LAN family’s old ancestor snorted coldly and turned around to take a step forward, wanting to leave.</p><p>Lan Cheng and the others were the same!</p><p>“Wait a moment!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was heard.</p><p>The LAN family’s ancestor and the rest stopped.</p><p>“What else do you have to say?”</p><p>Lan Cheng asked, suppressing his anger.</p><p>master LAN is really forgetful. I won first place, so where are the 100 chaos gems? give them to me!</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Lan Cheng was so angry that he almost vomited blood. Lu Ming had killed so many people from the LAN family today. Now, he was actually asking him for stones of chaos. This was preposterous.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Your LAN family said it yourself, don’t tell me you don’t want to admit it? Or perhaps, you’re toying with the others like monkeys?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>Lan Cheng was so angry that his lungs were about to explode.</p><p>“Give it to him!”</p><p>The LAN clan’s old ancestor said.</p><p>In the end, Lan Cheng had no choice but to take out a storage ring and throw it to Lu Ming. Lu Ming took it and saw that there were 100 chaos gems inside, thank you, thank you. These chaos gems can help my cultivation level improve again. Haha!</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily.</p><p>Lan Cheng’s eyelids and lips trembled non-stop.’Thankyou, my ass. If not for the circumstances, why would I give Lu Ming a hundred chaos gems?’</p><p>It was for Xuanyuan Yi.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lan Cheng squeezed out a word from the depths of his throat and turned to leave.</p><p>The people from the LAN family, the Yan family, and those who were related to the LAN family all left and entered the large Palace in the depths of the LAN family.</p><p>Lu Ming did not let Earth One, gold one, or other body cultivators to keep the other party.</p><p>With their strength, they were enough to flatten the LAN family. However, the LAN family and the Yan family were, after all, major forces with ancient inheritances. With a few heavenly emperors, they would be of great use to the heaven realm.</p><p>If Lu Ming completely razed the LAN family to the ground because of Bai Tai’s matter, he was afraid that the other celestial emperors in the heaven realm would intervene and stop him.</p><p>Moreover, the LAN family’s old ancestor was a peerless expert. If they were to run for their lives, they had no confidence in keeping him here. If a berserk peerless expert were to take revenge, that would be too terrifying.</p><p>But now, the other party was worried about Lu Ming’s strength and definitely did not dare to take revenge. At least, they would not dare to take revenge openly.</p><p>Everyone in the surroundings sighed. They didn’t think that today’s matter would turn out like this.</p><p>The LAN family and Xuanyuan Yi were supposed to be the stars of the day.</p><p>Xuanyuan Yi had defeated Lin Xiaofeng and reached the top, becoming the number one genius in the world.</p><p>However, everything had changed drastically because of Lu Ming’s appearance.</p><p>In the end, the LAN family and the Yan family suffered heavy losses and left dejectedly. Lu Ming became the main character of the day.</p><p>“Hahaha, Lu Ming, long time no see!”</p><p>The heartless monk rushed out with a face full of smiles.</p><p>Long Chen, Huang Ling, Huang Li, Ouyang Wushuang, and the others also stepped into the air and came to Lu Ming’s side.</p><p>Lu Ming greeted everyone one by one.</p><p>“Brother long, this is for you!”</p><p>A jade bangle appeared in Lu Ming’s hand and he passed it to Long Chen.</p><p>This was long Chen’s fiancee, and Xie nianlin had asked Lu Ming to give it to Long Chen.</p><p>When Lu Ming was in the divine wilderness continent, he had taken the time to meet Xie nianlin and told her about Long Chen’s current situation. She then asked Lu Ming to help Long Chen wear a bangle.</p><p>Long Chen’s eyes flickered. He took the bangle and cupped his fists at Lu Ming.”Many thanks!”</p><p>“You’re welcome. Xie nianlin asked me to pass you a message. She said that she’ll wait for you, no matter how many years it takes!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Long Chen didn’t say much, but his eyes were teary.</p><p>“Father!”</p><p>At this moment, a voice was heard. Lu shenhuang walked over..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
