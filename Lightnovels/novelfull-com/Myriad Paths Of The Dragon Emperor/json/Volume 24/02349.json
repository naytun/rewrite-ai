Wu Xiu had full confidence that he could suppress Lu Ming and even kill him.</p><p>Lu Ming actually dared to confront him head-on. He was overestimating himself!</p><p>Wu Xiu raised his strength to the maximum. He wanted to severely injure Lu Ming with one move.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Their fists and palms clashed together.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>When their fists and palms collided, an earth-shattering boom erupted. The boom was accompanied by the sound of bones breaking.</p><p>“Your strength…”</p><p>Wu Xiu’s body retreated rapidly as he roared in disbelief.</p><p>He was actually no match for Lu Ming in a head-on clash. The bones in his hand were broken by Lu Ming’s punch, and the terrifying power was like an avalanche, forcing him to retreat.</p><p>He was in disbelief. Lu Ming was only at the true Emperor realm and his cultivation level had not increased. It had only been a month. How could his strength have increased so much?</p><p>His mind was unable to process this for a while.</p><p>Lu Ming would not miss such an opportunity. Taking advantage of Wu Xiu’s momentary daze, Lu Ming launched a sure-kill attack.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>All the muscles and bones in Lu Ming’s body trembled rapidly. In an instant, it trembled at least one billion times!</p><p>In an instant, one billion times. This was a terrifying frequency. Lu Ming’s muscles and space trembled, producing a terrifying driving force. Lu Ming’s figure instantly rushed toward Wu Xiu at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming threw a punch.</p><p>Lu Ming had used all his strength in this punch.</p><p>The fist shattered the space and pierced through the void, blasting towards the small world in Wu Xiu’s dantian.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Wu Xiu’s hair stood on end, and his liver and guts were torn apart. At this moment, he felt the threat of death.</p><p>However, it was too late for him to counterattack. He could only retreat quickly and set up layers of defense on the surface of his body.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s fist landed accurately on Wu Xiu’s dantian. The terrifying force rushed into Wu Xiu’s dantian.</p><p>The power of great DAOs that enveloped Wu Xiu’s body was torn apart by Lu Ming’s power in an instant. The surging power bombarded Wu Xiu’s small world.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Wu Xiu’s small world started to shake violently, and many cracks appeared on it. Then, the entire small world exploded.</p><p>Wu Xiu’s body flew out like a meteorite and crashed into a mountain, creating a huge crater.</p><p>Wu Xiu lay in the pit and shouted crazily.</p><p>“No, no, no…”</p><p>Wu Xiu shouted as he vomited blood.</p><p>He could not accept that his small world had been shattered by Lu Ming.</p><p>His small world had been shattered, and his cultivation was completely crippled. Moreover, he didn’t have long to live.</p><p>On the other side, Wu Bo was also dumbfounded.</p><p>From the fight between Lu Ming and Wu Xiu to the moment Wu Xiu was crippled, it had only happened in an instant.</p><p>The time was very short, and in an instant, Wu Xiu was crippled.</p><p>“Now, it’s your turn!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Wu Bo coldly.</p><p>Earlier, he had intentionally revealed his true Emperor cultivation to make Wu Xiu and Wu Bo careless.</p><p>This way, he could cripple one of them in an instant.</p><p>If Wu Xiu and Wu Bo joined forces, Lu Ming was confident that he could defeat them. However, it would be difficult to kill both of them.</p><p>However, now that Lu Ming had crippled one of them, it was much easier to deal with the other.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s muscles trembled and his body charged towards Wu Bo.</p><p>die! Wu Bo was prepared for this. He let out a furious roar and unleashed his full power. He struck out with his palm continuously. The transparent palm pierced through the void and headed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming kept swinging his fists. In an instant, he had thrown hundreds of punches, clashing with Wu Bo.</p><p>The two of them exchanged hundreds of blows in an instant. Then, Wu Bo’s body was sent flying back, and he spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>His palms and arms were completely deformed. The bones inside had been shattered by Lu Ming.</p><p>Wu Bo’s face was deathly pale. He gritted his teeth, turned around, and ran. Right now, he could no longer care about Wu Xiu.</p><p>“You want to leave? can you?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. His muscles and bones trembled. With the enhancement of the six-feathered wings, Lu Ming’s speed had completely surpassed Wu Bo’s.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming caught up to Wu Bo and threw a punch.</p><p>Wu Bo’s arm had been broken, and he was unable to defend himself at all. He wanted to Dodge, but his speed was not as fast as Lu Ming’s. The punch landed on his head, and his head exploded like a watermelon. His soul was also crushed into ashes by the force of Lu Ming’s fist.</p><p>Wu Bo, dead!</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out his claws and grabbed Wu Bo’s dantian. He took out a piece of the core of the world from his dantian.</p><p>The realm core of a great emperor was a rare treasure that contained powerful energy.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming kept Wu Bo’s storage ring and walked toward Wu Xiu.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ll die a horrible death. 1 curse you to die a horrible death …”</p><p>Wu Xiu knew that he was going to die, so he started to curse madly.</p><p>hehe, what a joke. All of this is just your own doing. Originally, we could have split the liquid fire equally!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>Speaking of which, Lu Ming was their Savior. Without him, they would have been torn to pieces by those crows when they first entered the void Island.</p><p>However, not only were Wu Xiu and Wu Bo not grateful to Lu Ming, but they were also greedy for his treasures and attacked him. Now that they had been defeated by Lu Ming, they were cursing him with resentment. Wasn’t that ridiculous?</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Wu Xiu laughed out loud, a hint of regret flashing across his eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming was right. They had brought this upon themselves. If they were not greedy, they would not have ended up like this. Not only would they not, but they would also get some liquid fire.</p><p>They had brought this upon themselves.</p><p>With a punch, a fist force drowned Wu Xiu. The fist force disappeared, and Wu Xiu also turned into ashes.</p><p>The punch earlier had shattered Wu Xiu’s small world and destroyed his world-core at the same time. Lu Ming felt that it was a pity.</p><p>After putting away Wu Xiu’s storage ring, Lu Ming soared into the sky and left the place.</p><p>Lu Ming kept flying and only stopped after flying for a million miles.</p><p>The origin Qi here was very rich. Lu Ming opened up a cave on a tall mountain peak. He flew into the cave and sealed the entrance. He sat cross-legged in the cave and began to comprehend the laws.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming wanted to comprehend a new law.</p><p>which of the remaining seven ultimate maxims should 1 comprehend first? ”</p><p>Lu Ming started to think.</p><p>The remaining seven Supreme laws were fate, spacetime, Samsara, primordial chaos, nothingness, eternity, and karma.</p><p>Of these seven, the strongest was, without question, the law of fate.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had no intention of comprehending the law of fate for the time being.</p><p>The law of fate was the most difficult to comprehend. Lu Ming planned to comprehend the other laws first and leave the law of fate as the last.</p><p>After a while, Lu Ming made up his mind to study the primordial chaos laws first.</p><p>The primordial chaos laws were very similar to the chaos laws. Lu Ming had already cultivated the chaos laws to the highest level. He would definitely be able to get twice the result with half the effort in comprehending the primordial chaos laws..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
