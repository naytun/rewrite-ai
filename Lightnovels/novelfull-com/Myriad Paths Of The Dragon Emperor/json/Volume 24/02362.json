The terrifying force tore LAN Mo’s dantian into pieces.</p><p>“All, ah, ah, my dantian, my cultivation…”</p><p>LAN mo screamed hysterically, his eyes filled with despair.</p><p>“I said last time that if there was a next time, I would definitely kill you. Do you really think that I don’t dare to kill you or that I can’t kill you?”</p><p>Lu Ming spoke coldly, causing the despair in LAN Mo’s eyes to deepen. In the despair, there was also a strong sense of fear.</p><p>“No… I want it!”</p><p>LAN mo let out a roar.</p><p>“Rest in peace!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently. He shook his palm and a terrifying force burst out. LAN Mo’s body was torn into pieces.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and charged towards the rest of the LAN family.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A two-star great emperor was almost smashed into pieces by Lu Ming’s punch. He was sent flying backward, blood spurting from his mouth. He was extremely frightened.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming continued to punch out. Like a tiger falling into a flock of sheep, he slaughtered his way through. One-star great emperor realm experts could not withstand a single move from Lu Ming and were killed in an instant.</p><p>Even though he was a two star great emperor, he was still seriously injured by Lu Ming’s punch even though he was defending with all his might.</p><p>As a result, Emperor formless, huntian, and Sky Fire Emperor were free to kill several people while their opponents were heavily injured.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>LAN Kang roared, his eyes red,”Lu Ming, you’re killing people from the heaven realm. Are you trying to disregard the lives of everyone in the heaven realm?” They’re the backbone of the fighting force against the evil god tribe!”</p><p>LAN Kang wanted to use this method to incite the others to unite against a common enemy and attack Lu Ming together.</p><p>However, no one made a move at the moment. Lu Ming’s combat strength was shocking.</p><p>“Disregard the lives of others? Hehe, why didn’t you think of this when you attacked us? Also, trash like you won’t be of much use even if you’re left alive. 1’11 deal with the evil god tribe!”</p><p>kill him! Lu Ming said coldly. He was engulfed by the dazzling light. He punched out and killed a two-star great emperor who was already seriously injured.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you better remember this. The LAN family will not let you off.”</p><p>LAN Kang roared, turned around and ran. He rushed out of a tunnel and disappeared.</p><p>LAN Kang actually ran away without a fight.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The remaining members of the LAN family roared in despair.</p><p>“The LAN family is full of such people!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and showed no mercy. With the help of Emperor notionless and the others, the remaining members of the LAN clan were all killed in no time.</p><p>Lu Ming, Emperor formless, and the others took the LAN family’s storage ring and left the place with a flash.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming and the rest continued to explore the palace. However, they did not find anything after that.</p><p>During this period of time, they encountered the evil god tribe and had a huge battle. Lu Ming and the others killed more than ten evil god tribe members and forced them to retreat.</p><p>In the end, they came to the deepest part of the palace. There, they had another harvest.</p><p>They had obtained some chaos stones and raw gemstones here. Most importantly, Lu Ming had obtained a rare natural treasure.</p><p>“Divine wood liquid!”</p><p>Lu Ming recognized the rare spirit liquid in one of the Jade bottles. He was overjoyed.</p><p>This spiritual liquid contained extremely rich life essence, which was not inferior to liquid fire. If Lu Ming cultivated with it, he had a chance to break through to the middle of the fifth stage of the seven Gods mysterious technique.</p><p>Initially, if Lu Ming cultivated step by step, he would need a long time to break through the middle stage of the seven Gods mysterious technique.</p><p>It was not easy to cultivate an immemorial body cultivator. It was very difficult.</p><p>It was the same for the cultivation of the seven Gods mysterious technique. Every breakthrough was extremely difficult.</p><p>However, it would be a different story if they could obtain some rare treasures.</p><p>For example, rare treasures such as liquid fire and divine wood liquid contained rich and huge life essence, which could help the body to improve and break through quickly.</p><p>How could Lu Ming not be happy? as long as his Seven Gods mysterious technique broke through to the middle of the fifth stage, his combat strength would increase dramatically.</p><p>At that time, with the combination of his body and laws, he would be able to kill even a four star great emperor, let alone a three star great emperor.</p><p>The four of them put away their things and left the place in a flash, heading out of the palace.</p><p>They had already gained a lot from this trip. The most important thing now was to find a place to cultivate and improve their strength.</p><p>In a secret chamber in the palace, LAN Kang’s figure flickered and turned into a huge hand, grabbing the balls of light.</p><p>These balls of light were actually fragments of the great Dao, and there were more than ten of them.</p><p>“Hahaha, God bless me. With these ten great Dao fragments, my cultivation will definitely break through to four star great emperor. Lu Ming, it will be the time of your death!”</p><p>LAN Kang’s eyes glowed with a cold light.</p><p>The four of them left the hall and flew into the distance. On the way, Lu Ming suddenly stopped and an array disc appeared in his hand.</p><p>The eight pits on the array board all lit up.</p><p>all eight formation disks have been found!</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>all eight array disks have appeared. It looks like a storm is coming!</p><p>Emperor Wu Xiang said.</p><p>The eight array discs had all appeared. Next, it would be a battle between the two sides. Whoever won would be able to leave alive. This was bound to be a tragic battle.</p><p>let’s find a place to cultivate first and let the others fight first. Right now, increasing our strength is the most important thing!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Emperor formless and the others nodded.</p><p>In any case, they had an array disc in their hands, so they were not afraid that they would not be able to leave if someone else went out first.</p><p>Not long after, they arrived at the peak of a mountain.</p><p>This mountain peak was the highest peak in this area. Standing at the peak of the mountain peak, one could see far into the distance.</p><p>They planned to cultivate on the peak of this mountain. This way, they could look into the distance, know the situation outside, and grasp the situation.</p><p>They immediately divided the items they had obtained earlier.</p><p>Emperor formless and the other two also only took a portion of the great Dao fragments and left the rest of the treasures to Lu Ming.</p><p>After the distribution, they began to cultivate here.</p><p>Lu Ming took out the divine wood liquid, poured out a portion, and began to refine it.</p><p>The strength of his physical body began to increase rapidly again.</p><p>However, the situation in the outside world was a little different from what Lu Ming and the rest had guessed.</p><p>Both sides did not engage in a battle. Instead, they disappeared one by one, hiding themselves.</p><p>During this period, after Lu Ming refined some divine wood liquid, he went out to inquire about the situation. After discovering this situation, he was a little surprised.</p><p>perhaps, everyone has gained something during this period of time. They have the same idea as us and plan to cultivate in seclusion first before annihilating the other party!</p><p>Lu Ming made a guess. He walked around and returned to the mountain peak to continue washing his face.</p><p>A few days later, some people came to their mountain peak. Initially, they wanted to occupy this mountain peak. However, when they saw Lu Ming and the others, their expressions changed drastically and they retreated.</p><p>The news that Lu Ming had killed many of the LAN family’s powerhouses in succession had spread among the people in the heaven realm. When the others saw Lu Ming, they naturally retreated in fear..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
