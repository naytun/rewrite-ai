I didn’t expect it to be you. I’m Liu Gao. Greetings, young master!</p><p>With that, Liu Gao cupped his fists and bowed deeply to Lu Ming.</p><p>On the side, the Liu family’s master and the others were dumbfounded.</p><p>“Senior, there’s no need to be so polite. Please rise!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile.</p><p>Liu Gao’s action was equivalent to submitting to Lu Ming.</p><p>“What are you guys doing? From now on, our Liu family will follow young sect master’s lead. If young sect master has any instructions in the future, the Liu family swears to follow you with our lives!”</p><p>Liu Gao looked at the Liu family’s head and the others.</p><p>so, it’s the gold inheritor of Hunyuan sect!</p><p>The higher-ups of the Liu family had already guessed what was going on.</p><p>They looked at each other and then bowed to Lu Ming.</p><p>If it was an ordinary heaven’s favorite with the Hunyuan sect’s gold inheritor token, they would have chased him out even if they did not kill him on the spot.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was different. Lu Ming’s talent was too shocking. Now that his abilities were extremely profound, his future was limitless. It was not a problem for the Liu family to submit to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Everyone, please rise!”</p><p>Lu Ming quickly helped the senior members of the Liu family up.</p><p>Since the other party was willing to submit to him, he naturally saw his strength and potential. Naturally, he would not put on an overbearing appearance.</p><p>it’s fine as long as you all remember this. I still have to go somewhere else. Goodbye!</p><p>With that, Lu Ming stepped into the air and left.</p><p>After Lu Ming and the rest came out, many people started to make guesses. They did not know what had happened to Lu Ming in the Liu family.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop. Not long after, he left Aeon city and headed to his next destination.</p><p>The Tianwen sect was a huge force in the land of the divine fate. Their strength was not inferior to the Liu family.</p><p>One of the Tianwen sect’s patriarchs was also the Hunyuan sect’s Silver inheritor.</p><p>After Lu Ming arrived, everyone in the Tianwen sect was very polite to him.</p><p>This trip was also very smooth, and the old ancestor of the Tianwen sect was willing to submit.</p><p>The main thing was that he had killed a heavenly Emperor in the battle of Aeon city. This intimidating power was too strong, and those sects and forces did not dare to resist or disobey.</p><p>If Lu Ming wanted to destroy them in a fit of anger, they would not be able to resist.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming visited one force after another according to the list.</p><p>There were both big and small powers, and they were not limited to the divine mandate realm. There were other regions as well.</p><p>Lu Ming spent a total of three months before he managed to visit all the forces.</p><p>In the past three months, Lu Ming had almost traveled all over the yuan continent.</p><p>None of those forces dared to fight back. They all submitted to him obediently.</p><p>In this way, Lu Ming’s invisible power was already extremely terrifying and spread all over the yuan continent.</p><p>At that time, as long as Lu Ming waved his arms, powerful people would definitely gather and the world would be shaken.</p><p>After settling these matters, Lu Ming returned to the heavenly Emperor City and asked Qiu Yue to stay there.</p><p>It’s time to deal with the death god nation!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a cold glint.</p><p>He would never be at ease if he did not get rid of this force.</p><p>He then brought dandan, bubbles, Earth One, and Thunder one back to the divine land.</p><p>After arriving at the divine land, Lu Ming headed to a barren place according to the memory of the assassin from the death god nation that he had seen.</p><p>Here, they found a remote teleportation array. Through this teleportation array, they arrived at a hidden cave.</p><p>However, this was far from the end. They left the cave and found another teleportation formation in a hidden place tens of thousands of miles away.</p><p>Just like that, they went through nine teleportations in total. After the ninth teleportation, they finally arrived at their destination.</p><p>On the ground, a huge square suddenly emitted a dazzling light. The figures of Lu Ming, dandan, bubbles, Earth One, and Thunder one appeared.</p><p>“Who are you people?”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming and the rest appeared, they heard a cold shout.</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze across the square and discovered a few figures looking at them in shock.</p><p>“The person who will kill you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly and threw a punch.</p><p>These few people had just entered the Martial Emperor realm. How could they withstand Lu Ming’s punch? they were directly blasted into pieces.</p><p>“What a huge city!”</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest looked in front.</p><p>In front of them, a huge city stood tall. On the city walls, there were pieces of shining stones, which gave this place a little light.</p><p>The ancient city was underground.</p><p>It was the headquarters of the death god nation, the ancient city in the memory of the assassins.</p><p>They were now in a square in front of the ancient city’s Gate.</p><p>“Enemy attack!”</p><p>At this moment, a sharp cry came from the ancient city, startling the entire city.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the ancient city, there were black shadows constantly flashing. They were all assassins from the death god nation.</p><p>“Today, I will destroy the death god nation!”</p><p>Lu Ming was the first to step forward.</p><p>The group of them moved quickly and arrived at the ancient city in an instant.</p><p>There were no defensive formations on the ancient city. This was because no one had ever found one in the death god nation’s countless years of history, so there was naturally no need for any defensive formations.</p><p>They easily passed through the city wall.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill them!”</p><p>As soon as they entered the ancient city, sharp sword lights shot at them from all directions.</p><p>However, these sword beams stopped midway, frozen in midair by the bubble’s space-time laws.</p><p>“Let’s go back!”</p><p>Bubbles waved her hand and the sword lights shot back at an even faster speed.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere, and screams rang out. Dozens of assassins in black died on the spot, killed by their own sword lights.</p><p>However, black shadows flickered in the ancient city, and more assassins were rushing over.</p><p>Seventeen different types of light emanated from Lu Ming’s body. These lights condensed into spear rays and shot out in all directions.</p><p>At the same time, bubbles and dandan also made their moves, attacking in all directions.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>More and more assassins were killed, and their bodies fell to the ground like rain.</p><p>The strongest of the assassins was only at the true Emperor realm. Naturally, they were no match for them and were killed in large numbers.</p><p>Earth One and Thunder one didn’t make a move.</p><p>He had brought them here just in case. They didn’t need to do anything to deal with these assassins.</p><p>They kept moving forward like tigers in a flock of sheep. They killed more and more black-clothed assassins as they kept pushing toward the center of the city.</p><p>“You guys, retreat!”</p><p>A voice came from the center of the city. In an instant, the assassins in black retreated and disappeared without a trace.</p><p>At the center of the city, a terrifying killing intent spread out.</p><p>One, two, three…</p><p>There were more than 30 auras, each of which was extremely terrifying and exuded an extremely cold killing intent.</p><p>Great emperor!</p><p>These auras belonged to great emperor realm experts.</p><p>The death god nation was indeed terrifying. There were more than 30 great emperors as soon as they appeared, and they were even stronger than the MU family.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
