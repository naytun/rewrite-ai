He said that he had completed his mission and was about to leave this world and return!</p><p>The formation spirit said after trying hard to recall.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Everyone was even more confused.</p><p>He left this world? He went back? Go back to where?</p><p>Did this world refer to the heaven realm, the primordial realm, the evil god Realm, or all of them?</p><p>Only dandan revealed a trace of shock and a trace of anticipation in her eyes, but she hid it very well and no one discovered it.</p><p>“When master left, he said that after he left, the dojo he was cultivating in would be found sooner or later. If someone entered, they could give away some of the useless things he left behind. It could be considered a kind of fate!”</p><p>also, let me tell you, you can only get it if you enter the right eye. If you enter the left eye, you will get nothing!</p><p>The formation spirit continued, and slyly blinked its eyes like a young girl.</p><p>Many people’s eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p>The useless item left behind by that great figure was a Supreme expert. It was useless to him, but it was probably a Supreme treasure to him.</p><p>once you’ve obtained the treasures, you should all leave this place. Leave this divine Island, master’s Dao field. I don’t want to be disturbed by anyone. When the time comes, all of you must leave!</p><p>The formation spirit spoke again, and this time, when she finished speaking, a small silver-white bag appeared in her hand.</p><p>She opened the bag and poured it out. Suddenly, balls of yellow light flew out of the bag.</p><p>They were storage rings and bracelets covered in a layer of yellow light, like the stars in the night sky.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were burning with excitement.</p><p>These storage rings and bracelets were definitely not empty. They most likely contained treasures.</p><p>“It’s mine!”</p><p>“It’s mine!”</p><p>go! a loud roar rang out. Everyone couldn’t hold it in any longer and burst out towards the storage rings and bracelets.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Suddenly, a great battle broke out, and a tragic battle began.</p><p>Here, there was no distinction between the evil god race and the beings of the heaven realm. Everyone had their own selfish motives and wanted to take the treasures for themselves.</p><p>A civil war had broken out among the evil god tribe, and they were killing each other.</p><p>There were also civil wars between the beings of the heaven realm, killing each other.</p><p>“All!”</p><p>A blood-curdling screech rang out as one of the six star great emperor realm evil god race members was cleaved into two by another member of the evil god race’s axe.</p><p>Another human from the heaven realm had his body torn apart by a true dragon from the heaven realm.</p><p>Tragic!</p><p>In this place, there were only treasures and no factions.</p><p>Lu Ming and dandan also moved.</p><p>Lu Ming dashed forward and grabbed a storage ring that was shining with a yellow light. On the other hand, dandan pounced on a storage bracelet.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>One of the evil god race members bellowed and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>This evil god was a six-star great emperor, and his battle strength was extremely shocking.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The muscles all over Lu Ming’s body trembled rapidly. At the same time, he used the six-feathered divine wings to increase his speed to the maximum.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming dodged the evil god tribe member’s attack in a flash and appeared beside the storage ring. He grabbed the storage ring in his hand.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The evil god race member was furious and charged toward Lu Ming in a frenzy.</p><p>A destructive light burst out from his third eye and he transformed into a ferocious beast. He roared and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming did not take it head-on. Instead, he continued to use his movement technique to avoid the other party’s attack.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s own combat strength, although he could put up a fight against a six-star great emperor, he was most likely not the opponent’s match. There was no need to waste his energy.</p><p>As for the celestial Thearch’s physical body, Lu Ming did not want to use it yet.</p><p>That was because the formation spirit was still hovering in the air, still holding onto the bag.</p><p>Who knew if there was a higher grade treasure in the bag?</p><p>He would think about it when he had more high-level treasures.</p><p>On the other side, dandan had also successfully seized a storage bracelet. His combat strength was extremely strong, and he made a six star great emperor spit out a large mouthful of blood in just a few moves. He had easily seized the storage bracelet.</p><p>After he got the storage bracelet, he set his eyes on another storage bracelet.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed extremely quickly, avoiding the evil god tribe member’s attack. He then rushed toward another storage ring.</p><p>There were two six star great emperors fighting over the storage ring.</p><p>Of the two six star great emperors, one was from the evil god tribe, and the other was an expert from the heaven realm. The two of them were fighting intensely, and both of them were injured.</p><p>Lu Ming rushed over, alarming the two of them.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>The two of them launched an attack on Lu Ming at the same time.</p><p>Lu Ming increased his speed to the maximum. His muscles trembled billions of times per second and his six-feathered wings flashed rapidly, successfully avoiding one of the attacks.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not manage to avoid the other one and was hit.</p><p>There was a flash of ruthlessness in Lu Ming’s eyes. He charged forward and took the blow head-on.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming was struck and his body trembled violently. It was as if his body was about to be torn apart. However, Lu Ming gritted his teeth and withstood the attack. At the same time, he circulated the indestructible ancient scroll to recover with all his might.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming appeared next to the storage ring in a flash and grabbed it.</p><p>Lu Ming successfully obtained two storage rings.</p><p>“Hand over your storage ring!”</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The three powerhouses ‘storage rings had been taken away by Lu Ming. Each of them was filled with cold killing intent as they charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the indestructible ancient scroll to heal his injuries while dodging the other party’s attacks.</p><p>At this moment, the entire secret room was in a state of killing.</p><p>Six star great emperor and Seven Star Peak great emperor were fighting each other, and people were dying one after another.</p><p>As for the storage rings and bracelets, they were all taken away.</p><p>Very quickly, there were not many storage rings left.</p><p>“Brat, hand over the treasure!”</p><p>A purple-haired middle-aged man had his eyes on Lu Ming and charged towards him. His combat strength was shocking.</p><p>This was a peak great emperor!</p><p>Furthermore, he was a member of the Royal race of the evil god race, and his strength was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. If he did not use the celestial Thearch’s physical body, he would not be a match for such an expert.</p><p>“Now is not the time!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. His body flashed rapidly and he dodged the other party’s attack.</p><p>“Do you think you can escape? you will die in my hands!”</p><p>kill! the evil god tribe’s royal member said coldly as he charged toward Lu Ming. The three six star great emperors who were chasing after Lu Ming earlier were frightened and stopped.</p><p>die your sister! I’ll fight you!</p><p>At this moment, a disdainful voice rang out. Then, a huge palm slammed down towards the evil god tribe’s royal tribe.</p><p>His palm was covered with all kinds of runes, which intertwined with a terrifying power.</p><p>The Royal member of the evil god tribe slapped out with his palm and clashed with the palm, causing a deafening boom to ring out.</p><p>After that, the body of the evil god tribe’s royal member trembled violently, and he retreated continuously.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Dandan appeared beside Lu Ming..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
