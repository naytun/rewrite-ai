If you sell it, the price will be immeasurable. 1 can’t accept it!”</p><p>Although heavenly Emperor Heng Yu was tempted, he still shook his head.</p><p>Lu Ming had risked his life to obtain this. How could he accept it?</p><p>“Senior Hengyu, please accept it. I’ve gained a lot this time, and 1 have my own heaven Dao soldier. I have no use for this sword!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Indeed, he had gained a lot this time. He had all kinds of resources.</p><p>There was no need for him to sell the heaven Dao soldiers. He didn’t lack resources.</p><p>Along the way, the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor had been of great help to him, especially the heavenly Emperor’s physical body, which had helped Lu Ming escape danger many times. It was only right to give the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor a heaven Dao soldier.</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming’s firm attitude, the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor hesitated for a moment before putting it away.</p><p>“Lu Ming, if you need anything, just tell me. I’ll definitely help you if it’s within my means!”</p><p>The Heng Yu heavenly Dao said.</p><p>“Senior Heng Yu, you’re too serious!”</p><p>Lu Ming said hurriedly.</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu looked at the sword in his hand carefully, and the more he looked at it, the more he liked it, and a smile appeared on his face.</p><p>His cultivation was at the three-star heavenly Emperor realm. With this heaven Dao soldier, his combat strength would increase by a large margin. Even if he encountered a peerless expert at the four-star heavenly Emperor realm, as long as the other party didn’t have a heaven Dao soldier, he would be able to fight against them.</p><p>He could even make use of the heavenly Dao contained in the heavenly Dao soldiers to improve his cultivation, break through the bottleneck, and break through to the four-star heavenly Emperor level, becoming a peerless powerhouse, a figure at the heavenly venerable level in the heavenly realm.</p><p>This heaven Dao soldier was too useful to him.</p><p>After a while, the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor kept the heaven Dao soldier and left after chatting with Lu Ming for a while.</p><p>He needed to refine the heaven Dao soldier as soon as possible so that he could unleash its full power.</p><p>After the Heng Yu celestial Thearch left, Lu Ming made a trip to the chaos Hall and gave the remaining heavenly Dao soldier, the meteor hammer, to tu Yi.</p><p>Earth One was naturally overjoyed to obtain the heaven Dao soldier.</p><p>Actually, the primal Chaos Palace had also left behind heaven Dao soldiers. However, there were only two of them, and they weren’t suitable for the earth element.</p><p>One was in gold one’s hands and the other was in Lei Yi’s hands. The others had long been envious. Now that Earth One had one, he was naturally overjoyed and extremely grateful to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. Earth One and the rest were completely under his command. The stronger they were, the better it was for him.</p><p>After Lu Ming returned to his residence, he had an idea and entered the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Then, a long spear appeared in his hand.</p><p>This long spear was the heaven Dao soldier.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>All of Lu Ming’s power erupted. The power of his physical body, the power of the world, and the power of the laws were all unleashed. The long spear emitted a dazzling radiance and swept out.</p><p>The void was instantly shattered, and an endless space storm howled. It was simply destructive.</p><p>“Cool, this is too cool!”</p><p>After waving it a few times, Lu Ming stopped.</p><p>With his current cultivation, he naturally couldn’t unleash the full power of the heaven Dao soldiers, nor could he activate the power of the heaven Dao within.</p><p>However, the material of the heaven Dao soldiers was extremely sturdy and once activated, they would be heavier than a mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming could unleash all his power without any restraint.</p><p>Previously, when Lu Ming condensed the infinite Dragon Spear with the law, he could not unleash all of Lu Ming’s power. At the very least, he could not use his physical strength to his heart’s content. Once there was a strong collision, the infinite Dragon Spear would collapse.</p><p>Therefore, most of the time, Lu Ming simply used his fists to fight the enemy. In that case, he would be able to unleash his abilities more.</p><p>But now, with this long spear, Lu Ming’s strength could be unleashed to his heart’s content.</p><p>Moreover, the long spear had more or less increased Lu Ming’s combat strength.</p><p>On the handle of the spear, there were three words: Great desolation spear!</p><p>“Great desolation spear, accompany me in my world War!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and kept the great desolation spear.</p><p>“After a while, I’ll go back to the primordial realm to take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming started to think.</p><p>It had been many years since he had entered the heaven realm from the passageway in the divine wilderness continent’s ninedragons. Now that his strength had improved rapidly, it was time for him to go back and take a look.</p><p>Also, he had to go back and settle some scores.</p><p>For example, the Heng family, the he family, and the Daluo heaven sect of the heavenly Emperor City.</p><p>The MU family in the divine land.</p><p>These people wanted to kill him back then. It was time to settle the score.</p><p>However, before Lu Ming returned, he planned to look for bubbles, Long Chen, Feng Ling, and the rest. He had too many resources on hand now and he planned to give them some. This way, their cultivation speed would also increase.</p><p>Lu Ming found a few acquaintances and asked them about bubbles and the rest. He waited while asking.</p><p>At the same time, in a Great Hall of the LAN family, the higher-ups of the LAN family and the Yan family were discussing something.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ve gone too far!”</p><p>The heavenly Emperor of the LAN family, Lan Cheng, let out a furious roar filled with endless killing intent.</p><p>The other members of the LAN family were the same. However, as they were emitting killing intent, their eyes were also filled with fear.</p><p>This was because they had already learned that some of the great emperors of the LAN family had been killed by Lu Ming on the void Island.</p><p>After all, there were many people who were still alive in the heaven realm. When those people came out, they immediately passed the news to the LAN family.</p><p>The upper echelons of the LAN family were shocked when they heard this news. They immediately gathered the upper echelons and the Yan family’s celestial Thearch for a discussion.</p><p>“Master, what should we do now?”</p><p>Someone asked Lan Cheng.</p><p>kill him! We must kill him! We can’t let Lu Ming grow. Otherwise, we’ll all die!</p><p>Lan Cheng said coldly.</p><p>“Foolish!”</p><p>Right at this moment, an aged voice sounded out, causing the expressions of everyone present to change.</p><p>In the next moment, a white-haired old man in coarse clothes appeared in the hall.</p><p>Everyone in the LAN family quickly stood up and bowed,” “We pay our respects to the ancestor!”</p><p>The Yan clan’s heavenly Emperor also stood up and said,” “Greetings, exalted celestial!”</p><p>Above the four-star heavenly Emperor, they were known as heavenly venerates.</p><p>The LAN family’s patriarch’s gaze swept across the crowd before finally landing on Lan Cheng.”Now, you still want to kill Lu Ming?”</p><p>“Old ancestor, Lu Ming has killed so many great emperors of the LAN family. How can we not kill him? moreover, if we let him go on like this, the LAN family will be in danger!”</p><p>Lan Cheng said.</p><p>“Oh, then tell me, how do we kill them?”</p><p>The LAN clan’s old ancestor said.</p><p>“How?”</p><p>Lan Cheng was stunned.</p><p>“With Lu Ming’s current strength, are you confident in sending a great emperor? If the great emperor wasn’t confident, would you and I do it personally? If we make a move and someone notices, will the celestial Thearch behind Lu Ming go crazy?”</p><p>“Also, everyone in the heaven realm now knows that Lu Ming is an enemy of the LAN family. If Lu Ming is secretly killed, will the others suspect that we did it? I’m afraid that the celestial emperors behind him will also come to our LAN family!”</p><p>The LAN family’s ancestor said coldly..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
