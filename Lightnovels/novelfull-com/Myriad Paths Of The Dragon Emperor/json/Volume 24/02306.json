After a while, they calmed down.</p><p>“Why have you come to find us?”</p><p>One of the Grand elders asked with a smile.</p><p>“Seniors, now that the outsiders have set their eyes on this place, they will definitely not let this place go. If this continues, the battle will be very unfavorable!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>we know this as well. Do you have any countermeasures? ”</p><p>One of the Grand elders said.</p><p>“Charge out, leave this place. Otherwise, this place will be broken through sooner or later. At that time, no one will be able to escape!”</p><p>Lu Ming said, directly expressing his thoughts.</p><p>“Leave this place!”</p><p>Everyone in the stone Hall paled.</p><p>we immemorial body cultivators have been living in seclusion here ever since we were defeated in the immemorial era. We’ve lived here for countless years and have already taken root here. You want us to abandon this place? ”</p><p>One of the burly men said.</p><p>The others were also silent. Indeed, their bloodline had lived here for countless years. Who would be willing to give it up just like that?</p><p>seniors, it’s not that I’m looking down on the strength of the body cultivators, but the foreign tribes are too powerful. Only a small portion of them are attacking from the outside!</p><p>in the ancient times, the heaven realm was extremely prosperous. Strong people gathered and the invincible strong people dominated the world. But in the end, it was still broken through and countless strong people died in battle. Of the nine Heavens regions, only the Tai Qing heaven region is left, barely holding on!</p><p>if the alien races send some powerful cultivators from the battlefield of the Tai Qing heavenly region, we will definitely not be able to defend it!</p><p>Lu Ming advised.</p><p>The people from the immemorial body cultivator lineage had grave expressions as they thought seriously.</p><p>They also understood that Lu Ming was right.</p><p>Their branch was only one of the branches of the ancient body cultivators.</p><p>Their strength was far from comparable to the ancient body cultivators at their peak during the ancient era.</p><p>However, the body cultivators of the primordial age, who were at their peak, had still been defeated by the nomological system.</p><p>Later on, after many years of development, the nomological system flourished to the extreme, but it was still broken through by the alien races. It could be seen how strong the alien races were. They would definitely not be able to withstand it.</p><p>there’s actually another exit in this pocket dimension. If you want to retreat, you can retreat from the other exit!</p><p>After a long time, a Grand Elder spoke, his voice filled with helplessness.</p><p>“There’s another exit?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. This was much better than rushing out.</p><p>“Everyone, what do you say? should we retreat?”</p><p>The Grand Elder who spoke earlier looked at the others.</p><p>“I agree to retreat!”</p><p>“I also agree. Our bloodline can’t be cut off like this!”</p><p>“I agree!”</p><p>The remaining elders and Grand elders all expressed their willingness to retreat.</p><p>Only a few people were silent and unwilling.</p><p>I have a question. Our small world has such a large population. How do we bring them out when we retreat? ”</p><p>One of them asked.</p><p>that’s easy. Those in our nomological system can condense a small world when they reach the true Emperor realm. Even a one-star true Emperor can condense a small world with a radius of 100000 miles, which is enough to bring everyone out!</p><p>Ren Chan said.</p><p>“Then where do we go after we retreat?”</p><p>One of the burly men asked.</p><p>“To the Tai Qing heavenly region!”</p><p>One of the Grand elders said.</p><p>“Tai Qing heavenly region?”</p><p>This time, not only were many of the elders of the Archean body cultivators stunned, but even Lu Ming and Ren Chan were stunned.</p><p>Could it be that there was a way to get to the Tai Qing heavenly region from the ten thousand spirit heavenly region?</p><p>If there was, why didn’t the alien races discover it after so many years?</p><p>“How can I go to the Tai Qing heavenly region?”</p><p>The eyes of many elders lit up.</p><p>It would be great if he could go to the Tai Qing heavenly region.</p><p>there’s an ancient book in our physical cultivation sect. It says that if you start from the yellow spring in the nine nether heavenly domain, you can reach the passage between the Tai Qing heavenly domain and the Hunyuan heavenly domain!</p><p>“According to Lu Ming, the passage between the Tai Qing heavenly region and the Hunyuan heavenly region has become a battlefield. As long as we get there, we can enter the two world city and enter the Tai Qing heavenly region!” Another grand Elder said.</p><p>Doesn’t that mean that we have to go to the netherworld realm first?”</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>“This is the only plan now!”</p><p>One of the Grand elders said.</p><p>seniors, this is totally possible. There is a passage connecting the nine nether heavenly domain and the ten thousand spirit heavenly domain. As long as we rush through the passage and enter the nine nether heavenly domain, we can reach the netherworld and then head to the Tai Qing heavenly domain!</p><p>moreover, the alien tribes ‘cultivation energy is different from ours. In the heaven realm, although they can also absorb the original Qi for cultivation, the speed is very slow and the efficiency of refining it is very low. Therefore, except for the battlefield in the Tai Qing heaven, the alien tribes in the other heaven regions are not many. With your strength, you can kill your way to the netherworld!</p><p>Ren Chan said.</p><p>His words made everyone’s eyes light up.</p><p>alright, we’ll do that then. I’ll have to trouble you to put everyone below the martial Supreme realm into the small world and then retreat!</p><p>One of the Grand elders announced and gave the order.</p><p>Immediately, everyone got into action.</p><p>The people who cultivated the nomological law system started to move. They kept all the people in the small world into the small world, leaving those above the martial Supreme realm outside.</p><p>After so many years of development, the population of the immemorial body cultivator lineage had already reached tens of billions.</p><p>However, this was not a problem at all!</p><p>A small world of a one-star true Emperor was a hundred thousand miles in radius.</p><p>A great Emperor’s small world had a radius of a million miles, and it was a piece of cake for it to contain tens of billions of people.</p><p>After a few days, the people in this small world and all the resources had been collected.</p><p>At this moment, they began to retreat.</p><p>However, they still left a group of people to guard the exit and control some zombies to fight against the alien races.</p><p>There was no other way. Someone had to stay behind, or the alien races would find out.</p><p>Those who stayed behind would die without a doubt.</p><p>Meanwhile, all the martial Supremes and above from the body cultivators had brought a portion of the powerful zombies to the other side of the small world. There was another exit here.</p><p>They passed through this exit and came outside, out of the land of dusk.</p><p>Then, they flew toward the passage in the netherworld realm at top speed.</p><p>However, they still ran into some alien races on the way.</p><p>Although these foreign races had been easily killed by the ancient body cultivators, they were still weak.</p><p>However, there were still some alien races who managed to spread the news before they died.</p><p>The foreign races in the land of dusk received the news and were furious. They launched a fierce attack on the depths of the land of dusk.</p><p>The Archean body cultivators who were left behind to cover the retreat were naturally no match and were all killed in the end.</p><p>When the foreign races rushed into the small world of the Archean body cultivators and found that they were all gone, they were furious and ordered all the foreign races in the ten thousand spirit heavenly region to surround and kill the Archean body cultivators.</p><p>However, it was too late!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
