They could only look at Lu Ming with killing intent.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He held the long spear and charged forward again.</p><p>Today, he would not spare a single higher-up of the MU clan.</p><p>“Evil creature, die!”</p><p>At this moment, a loud roar came from the depths of the MU family. The voice was filled with vicissitudes of life, and then a terrifying Saber Light slashed out from the depths of the MU family. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>“Peak Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed slightly as soon as the saber Light was released.</p><p>The MU family was indeed unfathomable. There were still experts that hadn’t made a move, but there was a peak Emperor hiding.</p><p>“Hahaha, I’ve been waiting for this moment!”</p><p>A loud laugh was heard. Then, a huge turtle shell appeared out of thin air and blocked the saber Light.</p><p>It was dandan who made her move!</p><p>Previously, he and bubbles had been watching from the side and had no intention of making a move, in case the MU family had an even stronger existence.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The saber Light struck the turtle shell, causing it to shake and dissipate. However, the saber Light was also blocked.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Then, a terrifying aura burst out from the depths of the MU family.</p><p>A total of five auras burst out, and a terrifying pressure filled the air.</p><p>Then, five old men stepped out and appeared in front of the crowd.</p><p>These five old men were very old. Their hair was white and their skin was dry and wrinkled, like five skeletons.</p><p>“Forefather!”</p><p>The MU clan’s patriarch was overjoyed.</p><p>it’s the patriarchs. The patriarchs really didn’t die. They’ve come out of seclusion!</p><p>“This time, let’s see how they die!”</p><p>The other members of the MU family were also overjoyed.</p><p>“The MU family indeed has a strong foundation. These must be the old monsters of the MU family who have been in seclusion!”</p><p>Someone from the distant spectators said in a serious tone.</p><p>The MU family was definitely one of the most powerful forces in Aeon city. They had a deep foundation.</p><p>It was said that in the distant past, the MU clan even had a heavenly Emperor, but the MU clan’s heavenly Emperor died in battle.</p><p>However, this also showed how powerful the MU family was.</p><p>It had always been said that some old monsters in the depths of the MU family were cultivating in seclusion, ignoring the outside world. They only wanted to improve their cultivation, fight the heavenly Tribulation, and even break through to the heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p>He wouldn’t come out unless it was a matter of life and death for the MU family.</p><p>Today, after the MU family’s great emperors were killed one after another, these old guys came out.</p><p>“The MU family’s Foundation is indeed deep. We’re saved today. Lu Ming must die!”</p><p>Emperor Heng, Emperor tianluo, and the others were also overjoyed.</p><p>“Three six-star great emperors and two seven-star great emperors. Dandan, I’ll leave them to you!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to dandan.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I’ll clean it up soon!”</p><p>Dandan was very confident.</p><p>When he was on the void God Island, he was only a six star great emperor, but he could suppress other peak great emperors and even kill them.</p><p>Furthermore, dandan had already broken through to the peak of Seven Star great emperor realm, and it would be a piece of cake for him to kill someone at the same level as him.</p><p>The five elders of the MU family looked at Lu Ming with lightning-like eyes and said in cold and dry voices, ” “You killed my Mu family’s people, kill without mercy!”</p><p>kill your sister! Try my invincible turtle fist!</p><p>Dandan charged out with extreme speed and punched at a peak Emperor from the MU family.</p><p>Countless runes flickered on its fist, as if it had condensed into a world.</p><p>The ancestor of the MU clan was shocked and hurriedly set up layers of defense.</p><p>However, these defenses were completely useless as they were directly punched through by dandan. Then, dandan’s fist ruthlessly smashed into the old face of the MU clan’s ancestor.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The sound of bones breaking reverberated throughout the entire place. The ancestor of the MU clan let out a blood-curdling scream as his body flew far away, smashing a Hall of the MU clan into pieces.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded.</p><p>One of the MU family ancestors had a terrifying aura. He was a peak great emperor, and his appearance shocked everyone.</p><p>However, he was sent flying by a punch before he could even show off for a few seconds.</p><p>Moreover, the one who had sent him flying was a teenager in a Daoist robe.</p><p>A young Daoist priest in his teens.</p><p>Dandan, this fellow, with his appearance, would really make people ignore him because he really wasn’t that good?</p><p>But at this moment, the impact on everyone was the greatest.</p><p>Lu Ming really has a helper. His combat strength is shocking. He sent a peak Emperor flying with one punch. No wonder he dared to come to the MU family! how terrifying! Could it be that the MU clan is really finished today? ”</p><p>Many people were discussing.</p><p>Among them, the Xuan family was the most shocked.</p><p>Xuan Lin and Dongfang Xue Yu both swallowed their saliva as cold sweat dripped down their faces.</p><p>Their clothes were drenched in cold sweat. At that moment, they were secretly glad that they did not lay a hand on Lu Ming. Otherwise, the Xuan family would be finished.</p><p>The Xuan family’s strength couldn’t compare to the MU family’s, so they were really going to die.</p><p>pervert, pervert! I’ll never provoke this pervert again!</p><p>Xuan Lin roared in his heart. He was truly afraid.</p><p>At this moment, the remaining four elders of the MU family had goosebumps all over their bodies. They instinctively backed away like crazy to increase the distance between them and dandan.</p><p>in front of this Lord, you still dare to take advantage of your seniority. You simply don’t know what’s good for you. Kill!</p><p>Dandan waved the sleeve of her Daoist robe like a peerless expert, and then charged toward the MU clan ancestors.</p><p>a huge world appeared, vast and boundless. It exuded a Grand pressure and pressed down on the other party.</p><p>Even if other people condensed a small world, they couldn’t use it to fight their enemies directly because the condensed small world wasn’t that stable and would be easily destroyed by others.</p><p>But dandan could.</p><p>He was the divine turtle of the world. The word ‘world’ wasn’t given to him for nothing.</p><p>His control of the world had reached the peak. The small world was extremely stable and had great power and an indestructible defense.</p><p>A small world blotted out the sky and suppressed them. The ancestors of the MU family couldn’t escape and could only fight head-on.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The old man of the MU family made his move. Four attacks were aimed at dandan’s small world. Behind him, the old man who was almost killed by dandan’s punch also made his move.</p><p>However, the five people’s attacks only made dandan’s small world shake a little. It couldn’t be broken or blocked at all.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The three six-star great emperors screamed and spat out mouthfuls of blood as their bodies cracked and were covered in blood.</p><p>The two peak emperors were slightly better off, but they were also heavily injured.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Dandan turned into a Phantom and directly rushed over, carrying out a bloody slaughter.</p><p>A series of screams sounded as the three six-star great emperors were killed by dandan in an instant.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>The head of the MU family and the others cried out in horror, unable to accept this outcome.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming let out a long howl and launched a violent offensive.</p><p>Although the MU family’s experts fought back with all their might, the outcome was already decided.</p><p>Shrieks were heard continuously as the great emperors of the MU clan died at Lu Ming’s hands one after another.</p><p>As for the two peak emperors of the MU family, they were no match for dandan at all. They barely managed to block a dozen moves before being killed mercilessly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
