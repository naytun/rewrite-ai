However, none of them made a move. The forces that Lu Ming had brought were too powerful. If they made a move against more than ten celestial thearchs, they would only be courting death.</p><p>“Young man, you’ve gone too far!”</p><p>At this moment, a voice suddenly rang out.</p><p>The voice came from the depths of the LAN family.</p><p>The voice was old and seemed to be filled with the aura of time. It was nothing to ordinary people, but when the Heng Yu celestial Thearch, Earth One, gold one, and the others heard this voice, their faces changed drastically and revealed a grave expression.</p><p>This was because this voice brought them great pressure.</p><p>“Ancestor, ancestor!”</p><p>Lan Cheng shouted in excitement.</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>Legend had it that the LAN family had a peerless expert guarding it. He had been hiding in the depths of the LAN family and was in seclusion all year round.</p><p>That was a four-star heavenly Emperor. Could it be this one?</p><p>Was the LAN family’s peerless expert about to be born?</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Just as everyone was lost in their thoughts, an aura burst out from the depths of the LAN family. This aura was ancient and powerful, shaking the world. Even the heavenly Emperor realm figures could feel the terrifying pressure, and their faces turned extremely serious.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>It was as if an ancient heavenly Dao was pressing down on everyone’s hearts. Many of the weaker cultivators had to kneel down.</p><p>Then, a figure appeared in the depths of the LAN family.</p><p>It was an old man wearing a coarse linen robe. His white hair fluttered in the wind as he walked through the air.</p><p>Every step he took seemed to be stepping on people’s hearts, making their hearts beat faster.</p><p>“We pay our respects to the ancestor!”</p><p>The people of the LAN family saluted one after another, their faces revealing wild joy.</p><p>“Hahaha, the LAN family’s old ancestor has been born. Lu Ming, you dare to kill a member of the LAN family? you’re dead! You’re dead! I’m going to skin you alive and pull out your tendons so that you’ll never be able to reincarnate!”</p><p>LAN Yun roared, his face filled with madness and malevolence.</p><p>“Is that so? in that case, I can’t let you go even more!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was calm as he spoke indifferently. His voice was filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what are you trying to do?” LAN Yun’s expression changed drastically as he roared.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming stomped down hard on LAN Yun’s face. A terrifying force burst out. LAN Yun screamed in pain. All the bones in his body were shattered by Lu Ming. His meridians were also blasted into pieces by Lu Ming.</p><p>LAN Yun turned into a pile of mud and collapsed on the ground. His eyes were wide open and filled with disbelief.</p><p>He wasn’t dead, but he couldn’t even scream.</p><p>The others gasped and looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>They thought that Lu Ming would not dare to make a move now that the unparalleled expert of the LAN family had appeared. However, he had severely injured LAN Yun with one kick in front of the unparalleled expert of the LAN family.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re courting death!”</p><p>Lan Cheng roared.</p><p>The LAN family’s patriarch’s face darkened.</p><p>The other party actually severely injured LAN Yun right in front of him. This was completely smacking his face!</p><p>young people are young and impetuous, not knowing the severity of things. Now, let go of LAN Yun, kneel down and cripple your cultivation!</p><p>The LAN clan’s ancestor coldly spoke.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s response was only one word, get lost!</p><p>This word made everyone’s expression change drastically. Lu Ming was simply too audacious. He actually asked a peerless expert to get lost?</p><p>The LAN family’s patriarch’s face turned completely dark as he said coldly,” you’re so young, yet you don’t know your place. I’ll teach you a lesson on behalf of your elders!</p><p>As soon as the LAN family’s patriarch finished speaking, he took a step forward and charged toward Lu Ming at an astonishing speed.</p><p>However, the next moment, an old man appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>He was a Grand Elder of the body cultivators.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The LAN family’s ancestor shouted coldly as he stretched out a large hand and grabbed at the body cultivator Grand Elder.</p><p>He was a peerless powerhouse, and ordinary heavenly emperors were no match for him.</p><p>However, this body cultivator Grand Supreme elder had a calm expression as he threw a punch.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The physical cultivator Grand elder’s fist collided with the LAN family patriarch’s palm. However, the result was beyond everyone’s expectations. The LAN family patriarch’s expression changed drastically, and his body trembled as if he had been electrocuted. He retreated continuously.</p><p>One of his arms was deformed.</p><p>As for the body cultivator Grand Elder, his body didn’t even shake.</p><p>Everyone couldn’t help but widen their eyes.</p><p>This body cultivator was actually able to force back the LAN family’s peerless expert with one punch. This was too shocking. Could he also be a peerless expert?</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was calm. There was indeed an unparalleled expert among the body cultivators. He was the most powerful Grand Elder of the immemorial body cultivators.</p><p>so you’re a fellow Daoist. I’d like to experience it today!</p><p>The LAN family’s patriarch spoke coldly as he pushed his strength to the limit.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The LAN family’s patriarch’s body enlarged rapidly, turning into a giant that could support the heavens and earth. He struck out a terrifying move. A divine light slashed down violently at the body cultivator elder.</p><p>Heavenly Emperor powerhouses were able to borrow the power of the heavenly Dao to launch terrifying attacks. This beam of divine light contained the power of the heavenly Dao, which was indestructible and could destroy everything.</p><p>However, the body cultivator Grand Elder still only threw a punch.</p><p>This punch seemed to be able to pierce through the universe and destroy the heavenly Dao.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The divine light that the LAN family patriarch had sent out was pierced through. The terrifying fist force pierced through the heavens and earth.</p><p>The LAN family’s ancestor let out a muffled groan as his body retreated rapidly. After retreating tens of thousands of miles, his body trembled and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Everyone sucked in a breath of cold air, their hearts in turmoil.</p><p>The LAN family’s ancestor had been defeated. He had been beaten by a body cultivator to the point where he spat out blood in one move. He was completely outmatched.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>LAN city, the other members of the LAN family, and the Yan family’s celestial Thearch were all shocked and in disbelief.</p><p>Even the LAN family’s old ancestor was no match for him and was injured by a single punch.</p><p>LAN Yun’s eyes revealed a look of despair.</p><p>“Hand him over!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming continued to speak, his voice getting colder.</p><p>Al!</p><p>The LAN family’s ancestor sighed and revealed a helpless expression.</p><p>He understood that he was no match for the old body cultivator. If he were to fight, he would definitely be the one to die.</p><p>“Lu Ming, the LAN family can hand over the person, but you have to let LAN Yun go!”</p><p>The LAN family’s patriarch looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Let LAN Yun go? Are you waiting for him to take revenge on me? Didn’t you hear him shouting that he wanted me to suffer a fate worse than death? Moreover, in the past, LAN Yun wanted to kill me at every turn. I’ve already let him off a few times, but he didn’t know how to cherish the opportunity. Then, there will be no future!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>LAN Yun revealed an expression of fear and despair, wanting to struggle with all his might.</p><p>However, all the bones and meridians in his body had been shattered by Lu Ming. He could not move at all.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s energy burst forth and bombarded LAN Yun’s body. LAN Yun’s body immediately exploded, turning into ashes and dissipating.</p><p>A top-notch genius was killed by Lu Ming just like that.</p><p>The eyes of LAN city and the other experts of the LAN family turned red, and their hearts were bleeding.</p><p>The LAN family had produced many heaven’s favorites in this generation. They only had two top heaven’s favorites, but now, one of them was killed in front of everyone.</p><p>Moreover, he did it in front of LAN city, the LAN family’s ancestor, and countless experts.</p><p>This was a slap in the face..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
