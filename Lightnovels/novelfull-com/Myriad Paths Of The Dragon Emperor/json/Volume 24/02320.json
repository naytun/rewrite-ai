This is too heaven-defying!”</p><p>The unscrupulous monk was already spouting nonsense.</p><p>he is indeed Lu Ming’s son. He is so young and more powerful than Lu Ming!</p><p>Long Chen sighed.</p><p>If that was the case, Lu shenhuang’s ability to fight above his level was even stronger than Lu Ming’s in the past.</p><p>When Lu Ming broke through to the Martial Emperor realm back then, he became a four-star illusionary Emperor in one fell swoop. Then, he fought against the Black Tortoise forest and finally defeated the Black Tortoise forest by merging nine types of laws.</p><p>However, the Xuanwu forest at that time was not as strong as it was now. At that time, the Xuanwu forest’s battle strength was only at the third stage true Emperor realm.</p><p>Clearly, Lu shenhuang’s combat power was stronger than Lu Ming’s back then.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming’s mastery of various laws had deepened. He had also cultivated an immemorial body cultivator and his physical strength had increased tremendously. His ability to fight above his level was much stronger than it had been in the past.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed to see how powerful Lu shenhuang was.</p><p>“Damn it, how did this happen?”</p><p>Some were happy, some were worried.</p><p>Heng Xinghe, Yuan Xin, Lan Cheng, and the others were all roaring in their hearts. They couldn’t believe it.</p><p>Lu Ming was already abnormal enough, but his son was even more abnormal. Why did this happen?</p><p>They roared in their hearts and went crazy with jealousy.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu shenhuang and Xuanwu Lin were engaged in an intense battle, and the rumbles continued.</p><p>However, the more he fought, the stronger shenhuang Lu’s combat strength became. His entire body emitted a layer of black light and became one with his combat sword. The sword light was extremely sharp as it continuously destroyed the stars from the Xuanwu forest.</p><p>In the end, the speed at which the sword light destroyed the stars was even faster. Before the Xuanwu forest could condense the stars, Lu shenhuang had already rushed in front of the Xuanwu forest and slashed out with his sword.</p><p>With a shrill cry, Black Tortoise Lin coughed up blood and retreated out of the fighting ring. A deep wound was left on his body, and blood was flowing.</p><p>Xuanwu forest, defeated!</p><p>He was defeated by Lu shenhuang in a head-on battle. From then on, the position of the nine-Jue would be replaced by Lu shenhuang.</p><p>Xuanwu Lin’s expression was extremely ugly. This was a huge blow to him.</p><p>Lan Cheng’s face was also very ugly. He said coldly,” “Shenhuang Lu, do you still want to continue the challenge?”</p><p>“I won’t fight!”</p><p>Lu shenhuang shook his head and rushed down the stage. He landed on a seat and closed his eyes to regulate his breathing.</p><p>“Is there anyone else who wants to challenge me? If not, then the first place today will go to Xuanyuan Yi!”</p><p>Lan Cheng stood up and announced, his voice reverberating throughout the entire area.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>Lan Cheng’s voice had just fallen when he was interrupted.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming stood up, took a step forward, and landed on the fighting ring.</p><p>Many people’s gazes fell on Lu Ming, but they were slightly stunned when they saw his appearance.</p><p>They had not seen Lu Ming’s appearance before. Another prodigy that had not appeared before?</p><p>Some of the heavenly emperors were surprised.</p><p>With their cultivation base at the heavenly Emperor realm, they could sense that Lu Ming had disguised himself. However, they could not see through Lu Ming’s original appearance.</p><p>“What a brilliant disguising technique!”</p><p>A heavenly Emperor spoke in a low voice.</p><p>“You want to challenge? Who do you want to challenge?”</p><p>Lan Cheng asked.</p><p>of course, I’m going to challenge the first place. Xuanyuan Yi, come down and fight!</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Xuanyuan Yi.</p><p>What?</p><p>Many people were shocked!</p><p>Someone actually wanted to challenge Xuanyuan Yi!</p><p>Xuanyuan Yi’s battle strength was obvious to all. He had reached rank 15 true Emperor. There was no doubt that no one in the younger generation could match him.</p><p>But now, someone wanted to challenge Xuanyuan Yi. He must be crazy!</p><p>Many people had thought that Lu Ming would be like Lu shenhuang, challenging a few experts to train himself or to gain fame.</p><p>However, Lu Ming wanted to challenge Xuanyuan Yi, which was beyond everyone’s expectations.</p><p>this kid is definitely trying to attract attention by playing to the gallery. He wants to challenge Xuanyuan Yi to increase his reputation. Even if he loses, he’ll still gain fame!</p><p>“That’s right, that’s definitely the case!”</p><p>Some people were discussing.</p><p>Xuanyuan Yi’s eyes narrowed as he rushed up the fighting ring.</p><p>brat, swords and sabers have no eyes. You challenged me. If I fail and cripple or kill you, then you’ll only have yourself to blame!</p><p>Xuanyuan Yi said coldly.</p><p>He was not in a good mood. He had already defeated Lin Xiaofeng and taken first place. Everything had been perfect.</p><p>But now, someone had actually challenged him. This caused all of this to seem flawed and imperfect.</p><p>Therefore, he had the intention to kill. Later on, he would kill Lu Ming in one move as a warning to everyone and let them know the consequences of challenging him.</p><p>“Little guy, what’s your name?”</p><p>Lan Cheng asked.</p><p>“Nameless fellow, let’s not mention him!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>a nameless person dares to challenge brother Xuanyuan. He really doesn’t know his own place. In my opinion, this person is just trying to please the crowd. Brother Xuanyuan, you don’t need to accept the challenge. Just ask someone to throw him out!</p><p>A voice rang out. It was the Black Tortoise forest.</p><p>Xuanwu forest had just been defeated by Lu shenhuang in public and was probably going to be removed from the list of the nine absolutes. He was in a bad mood and would bite whoever he saw.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming rushed out. He was extremely unhappy with Lu Ming and directly mocked him.</p><p>“You’re not even as good as a fifteen or sixteen-year-old boy, and you still have the face to make a fuss here. If I were you, I’d just destroy my own cultivation!” Lu Ming looked at the Black Tortoise forest and mocked.</p><p>“You … Brat, brother Xuanyuan doesn’t need to do anything today. Let me teach you a lesson!”</p><p>Xuan Wulin was furious. He rushed up to the stage and cupped his fists at Xuanyuan Yi. brother Xuanyuan, you don’t have to deal with a nameless person personally. I’ll teach him a lesson on your behalf!</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Xuanyuan Yi nodded and retreated to the edge of the fighting ring.</p><p>In his opinion, it would be best if the Black Tortoise forest team could take action, so that he would not have to do anything.</p><p>“You’re going to make a move?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the Black Tortoise forest and said.</p><p>that’s right. I’d like to see what kind of ability you have to dare challenge brother Xuanyuan!</p><p>Black Tortoise forest said coldly.</p><p>you can’t. You’re too weak. I don’t want to torture you!</p><p>Unexpectedly, Lu Ming shook his head with a look of disdain.</p><p>Xuanwu Lin’s lungs were about to explode from anger.</p><p>Who was he? he was one of the nine absolutes.</p><p>But today, he was first defeated by Lu shenhuang. Now, even a nameless person looked down on him. He was furious and filled with killing intent.</p><p>“Brat, who doesn’t know how to talk big? show me your ability!”</p><p>The Black Tortoise forest roared. Hundreds of stars appeared all over his body. The hundreds of stars gathered together and blasted towards Lu Ming. The power was extraordinary.</p><p>As soon as he made his move, the Black Tortoise forest used his killer move to blast Lu Ming into ashes.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The huge star was like a falling meteorite, dragging a long tail with terrifying power.</p><p>But at this moment, Lu Ming moved!</p><p>There were no energy fluctuations on his body, nor were there any fluctuations of laws. It was just a simple punch.</p><p>This punch relied on pure physical strength..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
