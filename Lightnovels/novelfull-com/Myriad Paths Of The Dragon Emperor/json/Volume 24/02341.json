His combat strength would definitely increase tremendously.</p><p>Lu Ming moved and left the place.</p><p>Tens of thousands of miles away, Lu Ming rushed into the desert. He went a hundred miles deep into the desert and then entered the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>After entering the mountain and river diagram, Lu Ming immediately took out the liquid that he had obtained previously and started to refine it.</p><p>The liquid contained a huge amount of life essence. Lu Ming circulated the seven Gods mysterious technique to absorb the life essence and strengthen his body.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>All the muscles and bones in Lu Ming’s body were shaking violently. In an instant, they shook hundreds of millions of times.</p><p>The vibration produced a terrifying energy that absorbed the essence of the spirit liquid. It seeped into his muscles, bones, internal organs, blood cells, and every tiny corner of his body, strengthening Lu Ming’s physical strength.</p><p>Half a month later, Lu Ming had refined and absorbed all the spirit liquid.</p><p>However, his Seven Gods mysterious skill had not broken through. It was still at the late stage of the fourth level, but it had reached its limit.</p><p>!!..</p><p>“What a pity, I’m still so close!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>It was too difficult to reach the fifth level of the seven Gods mysterious skill.</p><p>The cultivation of the immemorial cultivation system, be it the immemorial body cultivation lineage, the immemorial martial arts, the immemorial demonic path, or the immemorial fiend path, was more difficult than the nomological system.</p><p>It also consumed more resources. Otherwise, the immemorial cultivation system would not have been defeated by the nomological system in the immemorial era.</p><p>If he wanted to break through to the fifth level of the seven Gods mysterious technique, he would need more resources.</p><p>However, the spiritual liquid was not wasted. Although Lu Ming did not make a breakthrough, the strength of his body had increased by a level. His strength had also become stronger.</p><p>the void God Island has many heavenly treasures. I’ll definitely be able to find enough resources to allow my fleshly body to break through!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He then exited the mountain and river diagram and continued to search the desert.</p><p>However, for the next few days, Lu Ming did not gain anything and did not meet anyone else.</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming was hurrying on his way when the desert suddenly exploded. A terrifying axe gleam slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He retreated rapidly and threw a punch at the same time.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There was a loud noise and Lu Ming slid along the desert for a distance before he stopped.</p><p>In front of him, a burly figure appeared.</p><p>The evil god race!</p><p>It was a member of the evil god tribe. His entire body was covered in purple scales. He was tall and held a battle axe in his hand as he looked at Lu Ming with a cold gaze.</p><p>a true Emperor actually dared to Enter the Void God Island and even blocked my attack. It seems that you are a peerless genius of the heaven realm. Haha, it seems that my luck is not bad!</p><p>The evil god tribe member grinned, and his eyes were extremely cold.</p><p>“One star great emperor!”</p><p>Based on the other party’s aura and the exchange of blows just now, Lu Ming could determine the other party’s realm.</p><p>The other party was only a one star great emperor, but he was a noble of the non-human race, and his battle strength couldn’t be underestimated.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not afraid. He had hastily blocked the attack just now and was forced to retreat. He was far from using his full strength.</p><p>“One-star void Emperor, I’ll take you on!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“What did you just say? You want to use me as an example?”</p><p>The evil god race member grinned. A mere heaven realm true Emperor realm ant actually said that he wanted to take him down. What a joke.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The evil god race member took a step forward, causing sand and dust to fill the sky. He charged at Lu Ming, the battle-ax in his hand slashing at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body glowed with nine colors. He circulated his physical strength and world force to the maximum and charged at his opponent.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two of them exchanged a blow, and the force spread in all directions like water waves. The sand was swept up and spread in all directions like sea waves.</p><p>Below the two of them, a deep pit that was thousands of miles wide appeared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A figure retreated continuously. This time, it was not Lu Ming but the evil god tribe.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>The evil god tribe’s three eyes were wide open as they looked at Lu Ming in disbelief.</p><p>He found it hard to believe that he would be forced to retreat by a true Emperor.</p><p>“Your strength is only so-so, kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and charged at the other party.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The two of them turned into two streams of light and continued to collide. In the blink of an eye, they had exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>However, the evil god tribe was at a complete disadvantage. They were no match for Lu Ming. Their bodies trembled and their arms ached.</p><p>Before entering the void Island, Lu Ming had already defeated LAN mo in his battle.</p><p>At that time, Lu Ming’s cultivation base was only at six-star true Emperor.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming’s cultivation level had reached seven-star true Emperor, and the strength of his physical body had become stronger.</p><p>Although this non-human Emperor was slightly stronger than LAN mo, he was still no match for Lu Ming. He was completely suppressed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm was like a divine sword. He thrust it out and stabbed the alien.</p><p>Their bodies were covered in purple scales, and their defensive power was astonishing.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s palm was covered with nine types of laws. The laws intertwined and combined to form a divine power with even more terrifying power.</p><p>Coupled with Lu Ming’s physical strength, he broke through the other party’s scales and left a hole in the other party’s body, causing blood to flow.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The non-human Emperor howled in anger as he retreated with a look of fear in his eyes. He then turned around and ran.</p><p>He understood that he was no match for Lu Ming. If he forced himself to continue fighting, not only would he not be able to kill Lu Ming, but he would also be killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>“How could there be such a terrifying heaven’s pride expert in the heaven realm? he’s just a true Emperor, but his combat strength is stronger than mine. This is too terrifying. No, I must spread this news and let others kill this brat. Otherwise, if he grows up, it will be a disaster for our race!”</p><p>This non-human Emperor thought to himself.</p><p>However, how could Lu Ming let him escape? he spread his six-feathered divine wings and chased after him.</p><p>“Although you are stronger than me, it is impossible for you to kill me!”</p><p>The non-human Emperor roared.</p><p>Lu Ming was stronger than him, but not by a ridiculous margin. As long as he wanted to escape, Lu Ming could not kill him.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled up slightly and a large bow appeared in his hands.</p><p>It was the fallen star bow!</p><p>Lu Ming pulled the fallen star bow with all his might and the bowstring of the fallen star bow bent.</p><p>Currently, Lu Ming was still unable to fully draw the fallen star bow. He had only pulled it halfway. The nine types of nomological laws and the power of the world were constantly pouring into the fallen star bow.</p><p>The fallen star bow glowed with a brilliant light, and a nine-colored arrow was formed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming let go of the bow, and the bowstring vibrated violently. The nine-colored arrow flew out and burst toward the non-human Emperor.</p><p>The non-human Emperor roared as he swung his axe down toward the nine-colored arrow.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>A heaven-shaking boom sounded out, and the non-human Emperor’s body trembled as he was forced to retreat. He almost lost his grip on his battle-ax. “How is that possible?”</p><p>The non-human Emperor was shocked by the power of the fallen star bow.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming drew the fallen star bow again and shot another nine-colored arrow at the other party..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
