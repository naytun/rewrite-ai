The others were all competitors.</p><p>In such a tragic battle, there were casualties in a short while.</p><p>A slightly weaker peak Emperor was torn apart by two other peak emperors.</p><p>There was also a very powerful peak great emperor who broke out of the encirclement and rushed towards his token. When he was about to get close to the token, he was turned into ashes by everyone.</p><p>Peak great emperors fell one after another.</p><p>The others who didn’t die were also injured to varying degrees.</p><p>Tragic, extremely tragic!</p><p>This was a peak great emperor! If the heavenly Emperor didn’t appear, who could compete with him?</p><p>They were all powerhouses who had the potential to become heavenly emperors. However, they were worthless now. Some of them had been killed by their enemies, while others had died at the hands of their own powerhouses.</p><p>The more they killed, the crazier they became. Their eyes were already red from all the killing!</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Finally, someone rushed to the side of the token and grabbed it.</p><p>This was a true dragon, its entire body was golden. It was the most powerful golden true dragon among the true dragons, and its strength was shocking.</p><p>When he grabbed the token in his hand, he roared and tried to break out of the encirclement.</p><p>However, a few extremely powerful experts immediately rushed over and attacked the Golden true dragon with all kinds of attacks.</p><p>Although the Golden true dragon was strong and had amazing defense, it couldn’t withstand it. Wounds appeared on its body and it almost tore it apart.</p><p>Its eyes revealed a look of fear as it threw the token away. The scene fell into a chaotic battle again.</p><p>“Lu Ming, hurry up and recover. 1’11 make some arrangements!”</p><p>Dandan sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming. Then, her figure flashed quickly. Runes emerged from dandan’s hands and disappeared into the void.</p><p>Lu Ming knew that dandan was setting up a big array.</p><p>Dandan’s control of the Dao of runes had reached an incredible realm. As long as he was given a little time, he would definitely be able to arrange a powerful formation.</p><p>Lu Ming kept taking out energy crystals and Supreme-grade rough stones to speed up the storage of energy in the celestial Thearch’s body.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Piles and piles of energy crystals he had obtained from the evil god tribe and Supreme-grade rough stones exploded and turned into energy that was absorbed by the celestial Thearch’s body. Of course, some of them were wasted and dissipated in the void. However, Lu Ming did not care.</p><p>Usually, Lu Ming would not use such an overbearing method to let the celestial Thearch’s body store energy as it was too wasteful. Some of the energy would dissipate because it could not be absorbed. However, he could not care so much now.</p><p>In the air, the formation spirit swept a glance at dandan, a trace of a smile hanging on the corner of its mouth, as if it had seen something, but did not say much.</p><p>At the scene, the battle for the tokens had entered a white-hot stage, and the killing was extremely fierce.</p><p>Many peak great emperors were killed and died here!</p><p>There had been around thirty peak great emperors at the start, but only twenty remained.</p><p>The remaining twenty or so peak great emperors were all injured.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, dandan appeared beside Lu Ming and said,” “How is it? Can you make a move?”</p><p>“Sure!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>alright, let’s attack together. We’ll seize that token as quickly as possible!</p><p>Dandan nodded.</p><p>Almost at the same time, the two of them moved.</p><p>The two of them rushed out at the same time.</p><p>“Endless world!”</p><p>Dandan roared loudly. He revealed his true form, and his entire body was covered with countless symbols. Then, he opened his mouth and spat out a world.</p><p>It was really a world. However, it was not a small world that was condensed. It was a kind of magical technique.</p><p>The power of this sacred art was extremely terrifying. It was as if an entire world was suppressing the enemy.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A peak great emperor in front of dandan was already injured and she suddenly attacked. He didn’t have time to react and was killed.</p><p>Another two peak great emperors were sent flying.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming seized the opportunity and rushed over, waving his hand to grab the token.</p><p>He and dandan worked together seamlessly. Lu Ming grabbed the token in his hand.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>“Release the token!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! the other peak emperors roared and attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming was instantly overwhelmed by all kinds of attacks. The celestial Thearch’s physical body trembled wildly and was sent flying. He flew thousands of miles away and crashed into the wall of the secret chamber.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was fine. The celestial Thearch’s physical body had blocked the other people’s attacks.</p><p>If it was any other peak Emperor, they would’ve been killed by this many attacks.</p><p>However, Lu Ming used the celestial Thearch’s physical body to block these attacks and successfully kept the token into the small world.</p><p>“Still not dead!”</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>The others were shocked as well. Then, they charged toward Lu Ming in a frenzy.</p><p>“Lu Ming, come here and enter the formation!”</p><p>Dandan’s voice rang in Lu Ming’s ears. At the same time, she waved her hands rapidly. Sword-lights appeared in the void and attacked the peak emperors.</p><p>Half of the peak great emperors were stopped by dandan’s formation.</p><p>The rest of them continued to charge at Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s feet stomped heavily on the wall. His body was like a cannonball, rushing towards dandan.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>One attack after another was directed at Lu Ming, but he did not care and allowed the attacks to land on his body.</p><p>No one under the celestial Emperor realm could break through the defense of the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body.</p><p>Lu Ming rushed past her and approached dandan at high speed.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>A purple-haired middle-aged man appeared in front of Lu Ming and slashed his sword at him.</p><p>It was the Royal member of the evil god tribe. His arm had been cut off by Lu Ming and his storage bracelet had been snatched away. He was constantly thinking of getting it back.</p><p>At that moment, his arm had regrown. He seized the opportunity and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and slashed with his sword.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The two swords clashed and a violent boom erupted. Lu Ming’s figure was blocked and he stopped.</p><p>However, Lu Ming took another step forward and charged toward the Royal member of the evil god tribe.</p><p>Not only his sword, but his entire body also charged toward the other party. There were no moves or spells at all, only a brutal impact.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The evil god tribe’s royal member stabbed out hundreds of times in an instant. The hundreds of sword gleams were extremely sharp. However, Lu Ming did not seem to see them as he crashed into them.</p><p>The sword gleam could only leave a few shallow marks on Lu Ming’s body. Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming and his sword crashed into the evil god tribe’s royal member. The Royal member grunted as his body was sent flying. Lu Ming, on the other hand, rushed past him and arrived near dandan.</p><p>“Great formation, rise!”</p><p>He shouted daringly and waved his hands. Countless runes appeared and pieces of turtle shells appeared out of thin air, shrouding Lu Ming and him in the middle..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
