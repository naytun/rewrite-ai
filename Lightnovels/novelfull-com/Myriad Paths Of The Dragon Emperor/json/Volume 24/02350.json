Finally, it appeared above Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>The small world looked to be only one meter in size, but if one looked carefully, one could vaguely see the mountains and lakes.</p><p>On a vast plain, an ancient tree of comprehension pierced through the clouds.</p><p>Now, the path-understanding ancient tree was almost 800 meters tall. Cultivating under the path-understanding ancient tree would be very effective.</p><p>Lu Ming’s soul condensed in the small world and he sat cross-legged under the path-understanding ancient tree.</p><p>In this way, the small world and the outside world would be connected. The power of the law from the outside world would surge into Lu Ming’s small world and the effect of the path-understanding ancient tree would be put to play-</p><p>In this way, Lu Ming’s speed of comprehending the laws had greatly increased.</p><p>In just a few days, Lu Ming’s comprehension of the primordial chaos laws had already reached the beginner level.</p><p>One of the reasons why he was so fast was that primordial chaos laws and chaos laws were extremely similar and had something in common.</p><p>The second reason was that Lu Ming’s current realm was high. He had already cultivated nine types of laws to the third realm and could fuse different ultimate maxims. This showed that Lu Ming’s understanding and application of laws had reached an extremely profound realm.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming’s comprehension of other laws was much faster than before.</p><p>With the combination of various advantages, Lu Ming’s cultivation speed was very fast.</p><p>As the days passed, Lu Ming’s control of the primordial chaos laws rapidly improved.</p><p>In just two months, Lu Ming had cultivated the primordial chaos laws to the second realm.</p><p>In the meantime, Lu Ming also tried to merge the primordial chaos laws with other ultimate maxims. Otherwise, he would have been even faster.</p><p>Half a year later, Lu Ming had already comprehended the primordial chaos laws to the limit of the second realm.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming began to comprehend the law of reincarnation.</p><p>Lu Ming’s speed of comprehension slowed down as he comprehended two types of laws at the same time. At the same time, he had to try to integrate the different laws as he comprehended them.</p><p>Even so, Lu Ming had cultivated the law of reincarnation to the second realm after a year of seclusion.</p><p>Moreover, the primordial chaos law and the reincarnation law could already be combined with other ultimate laws to form a new divine power Technique. Lu Ming’s strength had also improved greatly without using his physical body.</p><p>After all, it was an ultimate Maxim. Every time he comprehended an ultimate Maxim and formed a divine power, Lu Ming’s strength would increase by a large margin.</p><p>Lu Ming was completely immersed in his cultivation and had forgotten everything.</p><p>To him, cultivating here was his greatest opportunity. It could save him a lot of time. If he were to cultivate outside, the time he would need would be dozens of times more.</p><p>A year here was equivalent to decades of bitter cultivation outside.</p><p>Lu Ming had no intention of stopping. He continued to comprehend.</p><p>Not far from where Lu Ming was in seclusion, three figures were fleeing at high speed.</p><p>If Lu Ming were to see it, he would definitely be shocked.</p><p>This was because one of the three was Emperor formless.</p><p>The other two were huntian Emperor and Sky Fire Emperor.</p><p>At this moment, they were being chased.</p><p>All three of them were injured and their bodies were dyed red with blood. Sky Fire Emperor was especially pale and his breath was unstable. He was the most severely injured.</p><p>The three of them flew at high speed, but there were some figures chasing them.</p><p>The ones chasing them were the experts of the foreign races.</p><p>“You won’t be able to escape, you’ll die!”</p><p>A non-human shouted from behind.</p><p>let’s go, don’t stop. If we’re lucky enough to meet a heaven realm expert, we might still be saved!</p><p>Emperor formless called out. He and huntian Emperor had brought Sky Fire Emperor with them as they flew at top speed. However, their speed had been reduced, and they were slowly being caught up by the non-human race.</p><p>With one chasing and the other fleeing, they approached the area where Lu Ming was in seclusion.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Behind them, there were a total of five foreign races.</p><p>One of them was a two star great emperor, while the other four were one star great emperors.</p><p>As for Emperor formless and the other three, they were all one-star great emperors.</p><p>At this moment, the two-star Emperor was the fastest, and he quickly approached the three emperors. A destructive light shot out of his third eye, which transformed into a sword that slashed toward the three emperors.</p><p>Emperor formless had no choice but to stop. He unsheathed his sword and slashed.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The two sword-lights collided, and sword Qi spread in all directions. Emperor formless’s body trembled violently as he was sent flying, his face pale.</p><p>Although Emperor formless had reached the peak of one star great emperor, he was still far from being a two star great emperor.</p><p>“Go, you guys hurry up and leave!”</p><p>Emperor formless roared.</p><p>“If you want to leave, none of you will be able to leave today!”</p><p>The two-star great emperor coldly said as he launched another attack toward the formless Emperor.</p><p>“I’ll help you!”</p><p>Huntian great emperor said. He charged toward Emperor formless, and the two of them joined forces to fight.</p><p>Even so, they were still no match for him and were forced to retreat. They were completely at a disadvantage.</p><p>The four one-star great emperors of the other side had also arrived and surrounded them. They were in a desperate situation.</p><p>“I didn’t expect that the three of us would die Here today!”</p><p>Emperor formless and the other two looked at each other and sighed.</p><p>However, they wouldn’t just wait to be captured. Even if they had to risk their lives, they had to give it a try.</p><p>At this moment, not far away, inside a mountain peak, Lu Ming sensed the movements outside and ended his cultivation.</p><p>“There’s a huge battle outside. Wait, this aura …”</p><p>Lu Ming started to whisper and his eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p>That was because there were three auras outside that Lu Ming was extremely familiar with.</p><p>Immediately, three figures appeared in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>Emperor formless, Emperor huntian, and Emperor Skyfire!</p><p>However, didn’t huntian Emperor and Sky Fire Emperor use the world-gazing gate to send some emperors into the heaven realm to solve the problem of the alien race?</p><p>Why would he appear here?</p><p>Many thoughts emerged in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>However, there was no time for him to think too much at this moment. With a thought, Lu Ming’s small world entered his dantian. His muscles trembled and he rushed out directly.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The mountain rocks exploded, and crushed rocks flew everywhere. Lu Ming rushed out of the mountain peak and stood high in the sky.</p><p>The commotion here naturally alerted Emperor formless and the other two, as well as the evil god tribe.</p><p>Everyone could not help but look at Lu Ming.</p><p>With a single glance, Emperor formless, huntian, and Sky Fire were all stunned.</p><p>“Lu… Lu Ming?”</p><p>The three of them were completely dumbfounded. They did not expect to meet Lu Ming here.</p><p>This was the void God Island, and only great emperors could enter.</p><p>They had actually bumped into Lu Ming here. Could it be that Lu Ming had already broken through to the great emperor realm? that was too fast!</p><p>The three of them couldn’t quite wrap their heads around it..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
