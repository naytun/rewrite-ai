Even if he could enter this place, how strong could his battle power be?</p><p>“One of you is here to die!”</p><p>One of the evil god race members sneered.</p><p>The faces of Emperor formless, huntian, and Sky Fire changed drastically.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s go, let’s go!”</p><p>“Hurry up and leave, don’t worry about us!”</p><p>Emperor formless and the other two yelled in panic.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s talent, he would have a bright future. They could not implicate him.</p><p>However, Lu Ming looked relaxed.</p><p>“Long time no see, Deans!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and stepped forward, walking toward Emperor notionless and the others.</p><p>“Lu Ming, hurry up and leave!”</p><p>Emperor formless became even more anxious.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter. It won’t be too late to leave after I kill these foreign kinds!” Lu Ming chuckled as if those alien races were lambs that he could kill at will, how arrogant! A true Emperor wants to kill us? 1 think he’s just bluffing. Let me kill him!</p><p>A one-star great emperor from the evil god tribe stepped out and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming stood there without moving. A cold glint flashed in the depths of his eyes.</p><p>Doubt flashed through the eyes of Emperor formless and the other two.</p><p>They knew that Lu Ming would not be so arrogant. He must have something to rely on.</p><p>Could it be that puppet?</p><p>A thought flashed through Emperor formless’s mind. He had seen Lu Ming use that puppet to defeat the great emperor of the he clan.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The evil god tribe’s Thearch held a Mace in his hand and smashed it toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s muscles trembled and his body burst our. He appeared in front of the other party in an instant and threw a punch.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Under this punch, the other party did not have the slightest ability to resist. He was directly torn apart by Lu Ming’s violent power, and his body exploded into pieces.</p><p>One punch, instant kill!</p><p>Emperor formless, huntian, and Sky Eire were all stunned.</p><p>The other members of the evil god tribe were stunned as well.</p><p>A one star great emperor was killed in a second by a single punch. What kind of battle strength was this? Even an ordinary two-star great emperor couldn’t do that!</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming bellowed and increased his speed to the maximum, charging toward the remaining evil god tribe members.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, he was close to the other party.</p><p>“Join hands, join hands, kill him!”</p><p>The two star great emperor from the evil god tribe roared and attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>The other evil god tribe members also launched their attacks.</p><p>“Do it!”</p><p>Notionless Emperor, Sky Fire Emperor, and huntian Emperor also made their moves. Their attacks were directed at the two star great emperor realm evil god tribe member, preventing him from attacking Lu Ming with all his might.</p><p>BOOM! boom! boom!</p><p>Lu Ming continued to punch out. The terrifying fist force brought about an intense spatial storm that drowned the few members of the evil god race. Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The three one-star great emperor realm experts of the evil god race exploded, leaving nothing behind.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>The remaining two star great emperor from the evil god race roared in disbelief.</p><p>A true Emperor could kill a great emperor as easily as chopping vegetables. How was that possible?</p><p>Of course, this was just Lu Ming’s cover up. His law system was only at the true Emperor realm, but his physical body was already at the great emperor realm. Otherwise, no matter how powerful a true Emperor was, he wouldn’t be able to kill a great emperor so easily.</p><p>Of course, this was Lu Ming’s intention. He had deliberately concealed his aura to shock the evil god tribe. In this way, their combat strength would naturally be weakened.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming unleashed his full power and charged toward the two star great emperor realm evil god tribe member.</p><p>The fate of the evil god tribe was already decided.</p><p>Lu Ming alone was enough to kill him. With the help of Emperor notionless, huntian Emperor, and Sky Fire Emperor, this evil god tribe member would not be able to escape even if he wanted to.</p><p>Lu Ming kept swinging his fists. Nine-colored radiance glowed. He was like an invincible God of War, completely crushing his opponent.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The terrifying fist force landed on the evil god tribe member’s body, breaking his bones and breaking his tendons before his body finally exploded.</p><p>The five members of the evil god race were all killed in a flash after Lu Ming made his move.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Emperor formless, Sky Eire Emperor, and huntian Emperor looked at each other with shock in their eyes.</p><p>Previously, they had thought that Lu Ming had something to rely on and a powerful external force, which was why he was so calm. They had never expected that Lu Ming had killed five members of the evil god race with his own combat strength.</p><p>More importantly, he had completely crushed them. He had killed five members of rhe evil god race as easily as crushing dry weeds and smashing rotten wood.</p><p>Compared to the time when he killed Wu Xiu and Wu Bo, Lu Ming’s abilities had improved a little.</p><p>The law of reincarnation and the law of primordial chaos had already reached a high level of mastery, so it was naturally much easier for him to kill an ordinary two-star great emperor when he fused them together.</p><p>“Three Deans, how have you been?”</p><p>Lu Ming walked over and cupped his fists.</p><p>Back then, Wuxiang, tianhuo, and huntian, the three great emperors, established the yuan mountain sacred Academy with the purpose of cultivating the geniuses of the yuan mountain sacred Academy. They were selfless.</p><p>Back then, Lu Ming had also received a lot of help in the yuan mountain sacred Academy. Otherwise, he would not have achieved what he had today.</p><p>Therefore, he still respected the three Deans.</p><p>“Lu Ming, 1 didn’t expect that in just over twenty years, your combat strength has already reached this level. You’re already far above us!”</p><p>Huntian Emperor sighed.</p><p>Twenty years passed in the blink of an eye for a great emperor.</p><p>Back when they first met Lu Ming, although he was very talented, he was just a young fellow in their eyes. He was still a long way from rhe great emperor realm.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s ability was already above them. They could not imagine it even in their dreams.</p><p>They sighed. Of course, they were also happy for Lu Ming’s achievements.</p><p>“If not for the guidance of the three Deans, Lu Ming would not have his achievements today!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and said,”Deans, where did you appear when you entered the realm looking gate?” Why are you here on rhe void God Island?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>we re lucky. After we entered the Overlord gate, we happened to appear in the Tai Qing heaven region. Those great emperor alien races were also killed by rhe strong cultivators of the Tai Qing heaven region!</p><p>Huntian Emperor explained.</p><p>What happened next was simple. Emperor formless found chaos heaven and Heavenly Fire, and the three of them cultivated together. When the void God Island appeared, the three of them came together to explore.</p><p>when we first entered this place, our luck was pretty good. We also obtained some fortuitous encounters and treasures. However, some time ago, when we were about to head to rhe void ancient Pagoda, we encountered these foreign races and were hunted down by them!</p><p>Emperor formless continued to explain.</p><p>“Void God Pagoda?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned and somewhat curious.</p><p>This was the first time he had heard of this name..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
