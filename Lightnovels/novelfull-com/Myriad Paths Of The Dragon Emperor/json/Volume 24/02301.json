They will send a large number of experts to guard the place where the ancestor is slumbering. At the same time, the elders are also thinking of other countermeasures. Alright, I’ll bring you to your living quarters first!</p><p>Then, the young man turned around and flew in one direction. Lu Ming and the rest followed him.</p><p>On the way, they found out the young man’s name. He was called Honglu.</p><p>Not long after, they came to an empty land. There were large stone houses here and no one was living in them. Lu Ming and the rest stayed there for the time being.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, more than ten days had passed since Lu Ming and the rest arrived.</p><p>Honglu was very curious about Lu Ming and the rest, mainly about the outside world. Therefore, he often came to look for them.</p><p>Lu Ming, Ren Chan, and Hong Lu were all young people. Naturally, they could get along well with each other. After a while, they became familiar with each other.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest also had a better understanding of this world.</p><p>Ever since their lineage was defeated in the primordial war, they had been living in seclusion in the depths of the land of dusk.</p><p>The land of dusk was the most dangerous forbidden area in the land of ten thousand spirits. There was a terrifying energy field everywhere. For so many years, no one had discovered that there were actually a large number of primordial body cultivators living in seclusion here.</p><p>The exit of this world, which was the place where the ancient body cultivators had said their ancestors were slumbering, was indeed the place where the ancient body cultivators ‘ancestors were buried.</p><p>Many Archean body cultivators who had fallen would be buried there. Under the effect of the wonderful field energy there, the bodies of those experts would turn into zombies.</p><p>Although the zombies had no intelligence, the ancient body cultivators had a special technique that allowed them to communicate with the zombies and control them to form a powerful combat force.</p><p>Back then, when the foreign tribe attacked the depths of the land of dusk, they had alarmed those zombies. Those zombies had awakened and defeated the foreign tribe.</p><p>The awakening of the zombie had also alarmed the Archean body cultivators, which was why they had sent people out to investigate. They had just happened to run into Lu Ming and the others, and mistook them for attacking that area.</p><p>During this period of time, Honglu had also been inquiring about the outside world’s information. Lu Ming told him what he knew.</p><p>the alien race is so vicious. They deserve to be killed!</p><p>Honglu roared angrily, filled with righteous indignation.</p><p>“Brother Lu, miss Ren Chan, shall 1 show you around? Enjoy the scenery and customs of our side!”</p><p>Honglu invited.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Ren Chan said. She was also very curious about this place. It was just that it was her first time here, so she did not dare to walk around.</p><p>Lu Ming also nodded.</p><p>Immediately, they led the way, and everyone began to walk around.</p><p>Most of the Archean body cultivators were simple and honest. When they saw Lu Ming and the rest, they sized them up curiously, smiled, and nodded.</p><p>They walked around the city and came to a wide area.</p><p>This was a cultivation field, a cultivation field of the immemorial system.</p><p>The cultivation field was very wide, and there were many people cultivating there. However, most of them were quite young.</p><p>There were two to three year old kids, five to six years old kids, seven to eight years old kids, and the oldest was a teenager.</p><p>What surprised Lu Ming and the rest was that the strength of these little brats was shockingly great.</p><p>Lu Ming saw a four to five-year-old kid running around with a huge cauldron weighing more than ten thousand catties.</p><p>A seven or eight-year-old child was carrying a small mountain and walking as if he was flying.</p><p>Each and every one of them was shockingly powerful.</p><p>Lu Ming and Ren Chan were dumbfounded.</p><p>we Archean body cultivators have to lay our foundations from the age of one. We’ll soak our bodies in spiritual liquid to Polish our bodies. From the age of three, we’ll have to cultivate body-tempering techniques. All our cultivation is focused on the physical body, so we’re stronger!</p><p>Honglu explained with a smile, feeling rather pleased with himself.</p><p>“Amazing, he’s indeed amazing!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>The immemorial body cultivator had an unparalleled physical body and was indeed extremely powerful.</p><p>Those who cultivated in the nomological system would temper their bodies and become stronger as their cultivation level increased. After reaching the martial Royal realm, cultivating a spirit body would have all kinds of wonderful effects and a strong vitality.</p><p>However, when it came to physical strength, Lu Ming realized that even the bodies of many martial Saints were not as strong as the bodies of the seven-or eight-year-old children here, let alone martial emperors.</p><p>As for those teenagers, their bodies were even more astonishing.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>In the sky, two figures were engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>The two fifteen or sixteen-year-old youths kept clashing in the sky like two rainbows, their speed shocking.</p><p>it’s equivalent to the battle strength of a bright Saint. Also, this kind of use of the physical body is too amazing!</p><p>Lu Ming sized it up carefully and was amazed.</p><p>These two young men were only fifteen or sixteen years old, but they already had the battle strength of a bright Saint. This was already very good.</p><p>Furthermore, their use of their physical bodies was extremely profound.</p><p>Their muscles were vibrating rapidly, resonating with the Air and Space, allowing their bodies to fly at an amazing speed.</p><p>The vibration was very subtle. If not for Lu Ming’s amazing eyesight, he would not have noticed it.</p><p>The two’s attack method was very simple. It was a collision of power. Each punch hit the flesh.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The two of them exchanged a few hundred moves before stopping. They each found a place to resume their cultivation.</p><p>brother Lu, I can feel that your blood Qi is extremely rich and your body is strong, far beyond other cultivation systems. I’m very curious. Have you also cultivated body cultivation techniques? ”</p><p>Honglu sized Lu Ming up and asked curiously.</p><p>Hong Lu was an expert in body cultivation. He was very sensitive to people with powerful physical bodies.</p><p>He could naturally sense that Lu Ming’s physical body was extremely powerful.</p><p>I’ve never cultivated body cultivation before. It’s just a coincidence that my body is stronger!</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>His spiritual body was a superior-grade heavenly spiritual body and he had refined the chaotic Qi inside, so he was extremely powerful.</p><p>After that, he had been tempered by the nine types of laws forming a River. In addition, he had refined a portion of the ancestral dragon’s blood’s energy. This made Lu Ming’s physical body shockingly powerful.</p><p>In the nomological system, none of the martial artists of the same level could compare to Lu Ming’s physical body.</p><p>“Brother Lu, why don’t we have a competition?”</p><p>Honglu said expectantly.</p><p>He had never sparred with experts from other cultivation systems before. He had always been very curious about how strong the nomological system was. It could actually defeat other cultivation systems in the ancient era.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He was also very curious about how strong the pure physical cultivators of the immemorial era were.</p><p>Bao de was also an immemorial body cultivator and was very powerful. Lu Ming had fought with Bao de in the primordial realm’s ten lands battle and had a deep impression of him.</p><p>The two of them moved and arrived in the sky.</p><p>The youths and children in the cultivation field were all attracted.</p><p>“Big brother Honglu is going to make his move!”</p><p>big brother Honglu is invincible among the younger generation. It’s been a long time since he fought. I can learn well this time!</p><p>The youths and children all called out in excitement.</p><p>Even some of the older ones were attracted.</p><p>As the strongest genius of this generation’s immemorial body cultivators, there was no need to doubt Honglu’s combat strength. They also wanted to see how powerful the geniuses of the nomological system were..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
