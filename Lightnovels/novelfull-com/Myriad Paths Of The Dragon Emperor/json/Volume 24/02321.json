The huge star was like a bubble, unable to withstand a single blow. It exploded with a single punch.</p><p>After shattering the star, Lu Ming’s fist momentum did not stop and continued to blast toward the black martial arts world.</p><p>Wherever the fist force passed, the space would explode and shatter, forming a terrifying spatial storm that swept toward the Black Tortoise forest.</p><p>The Black Tortoise forest was completely enveloped by Lu Ming’s fist aura. It was as if the space in the surroundings had frozen, making it difficult for him to move.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>The Black Tortoise forest had this thought. Then, Lu Ming’s fist landed heavily on his face.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Xuanwu Lin was sent flying out of the battle stage and landed heavily on the ground. He sprawled on the ground and spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>His face was completely deformed and swollen to the point where he could not be recognized.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Everyone was stunned and they looked at Lu Ming in a daze.</p><p>One punch. With just one punch, he had defeated the Xuanwu forest team.</p><p>They were not on the same level at all. They were completely crushed.</p><p>One must know that the Black Tortoise forest’s combat strength was also at the sixth stage true Emperor realm. However, it was still suppressed. Who was this person? They had never seen him before. How could he have such strong combat strength?</p><p>the power of the physical body! He’s an immemorial body cultivator!</p><p>Suddenly, someone exclaimed.</p><p>Everyone’s heart skipped a beat as they reacted.</p><p>Just now, there were no fluctuations of laws on Lu Ming’s body. He had relied purely on his physical strength.</p><p>Only immemorial body cultivators could cultivate their physical strength to such a level.</p><p>Bao de’s eyes lit up.</p><p>He was also an archaic body cultivator, so he was naturally curious and excited to suddenly see another archaic body cultivator with such shocking battle prowess.</p><p>I said, you’re too weak. I don’t want to torture you, but you’re looking for it!</p><p>Lu Ming spoke indifferently and cast a disdainful glance at the Black Tortoise forest.</p><p>The Black Tortoise forest spat out a few more mouthfuls of blood from his anger.</p><p>Today, he was really too miserable. He had been defeated by two people in succession. One was a fifteen or sixteen-year-old youth, and the other had dealt with him easily with a single punch.</p><p>Today, he was destined to become a laughingstock and be ridiculed by others.</p><p>“Is there anyone else who would like to stand up for Xuanyuan Yi?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the young talents present.</p><p>No one spoke.</p><p>Lu Ming was able to defeat Xuan Wu Lin with a single punch. His combat strength was unfathomable. If others were not confident, who would stand up for Xuanyuan Yi?</p><p>“Since you don’t have one, Xuanyuan Yi, let’s fight!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Xuanyuan Yi.</p><p>“Hehehe, you have some ability, but if you want to fight with me, you’re still far from it!”</p><p>Xuanyuan Yi stepped forward and sneered.</p><p>In his opinion, it was not a big deal to defeat the Black Tortoise forest with a single punch.</p><p>The Black Tortoise forest’s cultivators only had the combat strength of a stage six true Emperor. As long as they had the combat strength of a stage eight true Emperor or above, they would be able to defeat him in one move.</p><p>He, on the other hand, had the combat power of a rank 15 true Emperor, which was much higher than that of the Xuanwu forest.</p><p>Therefore, even though Lu Ming had defeated the Black Tortoise forest in one move, he did not take Lu Ming seriously.</p><p>“You talk too much, make your move!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>I’ve said it before. Swords and sabers have no eyes. If you accidentally go too far, you’ll only have yourself to blame!</p><p>Xuanyuan Yi said coldly, a halberd appearing in his hand.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Xuanyuan Yi took a step forward and swung his halberd at Lu Ming.</p><p>In the process of slashing down, the heavenly halberd enlarged rapidly. It expanded to a thousand meters in length and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and the fighting ring rumbled. He dashed forward and threw a punch.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated his physical strength to the maximum for this punch.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s fist and the heavenly halberd collided heavily.</p><p>With a terrifying boom, Lu Ming’s body was sent flying backward. He only stopped after he had retreated a few hundred meters.</p><p>this person actually blocked Xuanyuan Yi’s move!</p><p>Many people were shocked. Although Lu Ming was at a disadvantage and was pushed back, everyone was still shocked.</p><p>who is this person? he has at least the battle strength of a level 13 true Emperor. There is actually such a heaven’s favorite among the younger generation in the heaven realm? ”</p><p>A rank thirteen true Emperor was also impressive.</p><p>Among the nine absolutes, only Lin Xiaofeng and Xuanyuan Yi had reached a level 13 true Emperor. The one ranked third only had a level 10 true Emperor’s combat strength.</p><p>This was almost the peak combat power of the heaven realm’s younger generation.</p><p>An immemorial body cultivator actually had such a heaven’s favorite.</p><p>Xuanyuan Yi’s eyes narrowed, and a sharp glint flashed in them.</p><p>He was also very surprised that he did not defeat Lu Ming in one move.</p><p>“Let’s see how many moves you can take. Kill!”</p><p>die! Xuanyuan Yi bellowed. Wielding his halberd, he charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>“My physical body alone is still a little lacking!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>Now that he had cultivated the seven Gods mysterious technique to the middle stage of the fourth level, his physical strength alone was equivalent to a level 13 true Emperor. He was still no match for Xuanyuan Yi.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw another punch!</p><p>However, this time, Lu Ming used the ” indestructible golden body” from the indestructible ancient scroll.</p><p>The inextinguishable golden body could turn one’s body into a divine weapon. Not only did it possess a terrifying defensive power, but it also possessed a powerful offensive power.</p><p>The combination of the imperishable golden body and the powerful physical body of the immemorial body cultivator complemented each other, and the power that erupted was extremely shocking.</p><p>law, it’s the power of law. He cultivates the law system!</p><p>that’s not right. His physical body is too shocking. He’s clearly an immemorial body cultivator. He’s cultivating both his physical body and nomological laws!</p><p>Someone exclaimed in disbelief.</p><p>Cultivating one of them would take a lifetime of effort for many people. However, Lu Ming had cultivated two and seemed to have achieved amazing results in both.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming and Xuanyuan Yi clashed for the second time.</p><p>There was another violent boom. This time, Lu Ming and Xuanyuan Yi’s bodies trembled violently and they retreated.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss…</p><p>Gasps could be heard and many people could not help but widen their eyes.</p><p>They were evenly matched!</p><p>Lu Ming and Xuanyuan Yi were actually evenly matched in this move.</p><p>There was actually someone in the world who could fight against Xuanyuan Yi.</p><p>They could feel that Xuanyuan Yi had just unleashed the combat power of a rank 15 true Emperor. Even Lin Xiaofeng would find it hard to fight against such a combat power.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was able to contend with him and they were even. This meant that Lu Ming’s combat strength was also at the fifteenth level of true Emperor.</p><p>To think that there was actually a heaven’s favorite in this world who had reached such a realm. It was simply shocking.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Lan Cheng roared in his heart and became a little worried.</p><p>He was worried that if Xuanyuan Yi lost, his plan would be ruined. And wouldn’t he have to give away the 100 chaos gems?</p><p>“I must win!”</p><p>Lan Cheng gritted his teeth and muttered.</p><p>Xuanyuan Yi’s eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>He didn’t expect that there would be another young man in the world who could reach this level.</p><p>“I’m invincible. This person must die!”</p><p>Xuanyuan Yi roared in his heart, and his eyes were filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>There was actually a heaven’s favorite who could fight with him in this world. He definitely couldn’t leave him behind. He wouldn’t allow such a person to appear.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Xuanyuan Yi charged at Lu Ming with his heavenly halberd..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
