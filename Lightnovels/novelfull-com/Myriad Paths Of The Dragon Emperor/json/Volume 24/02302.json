The muscles on his body bulged slightly, and a terrifying whistling sound came from his body.</p><p>That was because his blood Qi was too rich. The fluctuations produced when he circulated it were like the angry roar of a true dragon.</p><p>When one’s blood Qi reached such a level, it was absolutely terrifying. Even without the life law and the indestructible ancient scroll, one’s vitality was still astonishingly strong. Most injuries would be able to heal quickly.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Honglu’s muscles trembled. His body rushed towards Lu Ming, and he threw a punch at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming squinted his eyes and circulated the world Energy in his body to the extreme. The strength of his physical body was also mobilized by Lu Ming.</p><p>In addition, Lu Ming used a law, the law of chaos.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming also threw a punch.</p><p>This punch was a combination of Lu Ming’s physical strength, the power of the world and the power of the law of chaos.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current cultivation and his third-realm Laws of Chaos, the power of this punch was extremely shocking.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The two fists collided.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s expression changed slightly. He felt that Honglu’s fist was like a few hundred mountains. Waves of terrifying power rushed towards Lu Ming. Even the third-realm Laws of Chaos trembled and were almost pierced through. Lu Ming’s body could not help but retreat.</p><p>Honglu’s body only swayed slightly before stabilizing!</p><p>“What powerful strength, what powerful battle strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little shocked.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current cultivation base, even if he only used one type of chaos law, his combat power was extremely shocking. Few people of the same level in the Tai Qing heavenly region could block him. However, Honglu had forced him back with one punch.</p><p>Honglu’s combat strength was top-notch even in the Tai Qing heavenly region.</p><p>“Amazing, brother Honglu is amazing!”</p><p>The children and youths all began to shout in excitement.</p><p>But Honglu himself, his expression was very grave.</p><p>Although he had forced Lu Ming back with a punch, he could sense that Lu Ming had not used his full strength. There was a terrifying power in his body, brother Lu, I don’t think you’ve used your full strength. Use your full strength! Honglu said.</p><p>“Come!”</p><p>Lu Ming only said one word. At the same time, his body was constantly glowing.</p><p>Array Dao law, artifact Dao law, penetration law, and extreme law.</p><p>Lu Ming had used four types of laws in succession. Among them, the array Dao law and the smithing Dao law were at the third realm, while the penetration law and the extremity law were at the second realm!</p><p>Lu Ming’s aura was stronger.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The five types of laws fused and supplemented Lu Ming’s fist. Lu Ming threw another punch.</p><p>Honglu also charged toward Lu Ming, throwing a punch.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The two of them collided for the second time. The space where their fists met kept exploding, revealing cracks that looked like spider webs.</p><p>This time, the two of them swayed at the same time and took a few steps back.</p><p>Then, the two of them started fighting again.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The collision of the fists was very direct, and they continued to bombard each other.</p><p>Lu Ming did not use his divine ability, life law, or death law. The two of them exchanged hundreds of moves and ended up in a draw.</p><p>After another exchange of blows, the two of them retreated, and Honglu panted heavily.</p><p>awesome, awesome! The system of laws is indeed wonderful. Brother Lu, did you use your full strength? tell me!</p><p>Honglu stared at Lu Ming.</p><p>uh, almost, just a little bit more. Haha!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>He didn’t use his full strength, mainly because he wanted to save some face for Honglu in front of the child.</p><p>After all, Honglu was the strongest heaven’s favorite of this generation of immemorial body cultivators, and was the idol of these children. If they defeated Honglu, it would inevitably be a blow to these children’s confidence.</p><p>“You bastard, I knew it. Let’s fight again next time!”</p><p>Honglu was rather forthright. He chuckled and did not take it to heart. He stared at Lu Ming and said, your physical body is really strong. It’s not weaker than some body cultivators. Why don’t you try to cultivate some body cultivation techniques?”</p><p>“A body cultivation technique?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>“Look over there!”</p><p>The Honglu road pointed to the North. There was a huge cliff at the edge of the cultivation field. From a distance, one could see dense words written on the cliff.</p><p>what’s written on it is a body cultivation technique. Let’s go and take a look!</p><p>Honglu said.</p><p>“Brother Hong, this is a body cultivation technique. I’m afraid it’s not appropriate for us to take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Every system had its own cultivation technique, many of which were not taught to outsiders. They were not body cultivators ‘inheritors, so it would be bad if they violated a taboo.</p><p>“It’s fine. That body cultivation technique is only used to strengthen one’s Foundation. Everyone can cultivate it. It’s not a core technique!”</p><p>Honglu said as he walked towards the cliff.</p><p>Lu Ming and Ren Chan were very curious and followed him to the bottom of the cliff.</p><p>“Little heavenly Mystery Art!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at it carefully and realized that there was a body-tempering technique recorded on the cliff. It was called the ” little heaven mysterious skill H</p><p>the minor heavenly mystery technique is the most widespread among the ancient body cultivators. It’s also the most suitable body-tempering technique to build a foundation. Anyone can cultivate it. It has a total of twelve levels. If you’re interested, you can try cultivating it. It’ll be very helpful in improving your body!</p><p>Honglu said.</p><p>“Many thanks!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Ren Chan thanked him and then began to read it carefully.</p><p>this is really amazing. It turns out that there are so many things to pay attention to in the physical body…</p><p>Lu Ming sighed as he read. Soon, he had memorized all the content. He then sat cross-legged and comprehended it quietly.</p><p>Two days later, Lu Ming began to cultivate.</p><p>First, he activated the first level of the little heavenly mysterious art.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>His muscles, his bones, and even his internal organs all let out a buzzing sound.</p><p>The buzz turned into a wondrous energy. It was like a sound wave that seeped into every part of Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming felt his entire body go numb as if he had been electrocuted. His body was trembling slightly according to a strange pattern.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that his physical body was slowly becoming stronger. Some of the areas that were difficult to temper in the past were also becoming stronger.</p><p>Although the extent of this increase was very small, it was indeed becoming stronger.</p><p>It was as if his physical body was being thoroughly baptized and polished.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming felt that he had successfully cultivated the first stage of the little heaven mysterious skill.</p><p>“Next, the second level!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to cultivate the second level.</p><p>At the second level, Lu Ming realized that the tempering of his body was more thorough. His muscles and bones were vibrating at a mysterious frequency. His entire body was numb and itchy. His muscles and bones were slowly transforming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s physical body was already very powerful to begin with. However, it was already very shocking that he could still transform.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming had cultivated to the second level and then the third level..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
