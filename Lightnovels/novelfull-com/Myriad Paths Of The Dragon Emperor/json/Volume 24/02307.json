Together with some Archean body cultivators, they were very powerful. Although they encountered some foreign tribes blocking them, the foreign tribes that had gathered in a hurry were no match for them. They were easily killed.</p><p>A few days later, they arrived at the passageway between ten thousand spirit heavenly domain and abysmal heavenly domain.</p><p>The passageway here was very vast, similar to that between taiqing heavenly realm and Hunyuan heavenly realm.</p><p>However, there weren’t many foreign races guarding this place.</p><p>Other than the Tai Qing heavenly region, the other eight heavenly regions were all under the control of the foreign tribes. They naturally did not need to leave too many people to guard these passages.</p><p>Without much resistance, they broke through the passage and rushed to the netherworld realm.</p><p>Abysmal heavenly domain was the legendary netherworld. It was filled with the Qi of the netherworld and was an extremely powerful heavenly domain in ancient times.</p><p>The name of the netherworld shook the heavenly realm, and experts were as numerous as clouds.</p><p>In the end, it was still broken through by the foreign races, and the experts suffered heavy casualties.</p><p>The legendary yellow spring and the bridge of helplessness were both in the nine Serenities heavenly domain.</p><p>Back then, when Lu Ming entered the tomb of the reincarnation Emperor, he had seen the netherworld helplessness. It was the nine lives devilish silkworm, created based on the netherworld helplessness of the nine Nether Realm.</p><p>There were many ancient books among the body cultivators that recorded many secrets, including the territory of the nine nether heavenly region.</p><p>After they entered the nine nether heavenly domain, they rushed towards the yellow spring.</p><p>Along the way, they encountered some other races, but they were easily defeated.</p><p>The nine nether heavenly domain was very vast. Although it was not as big as the Tai Qing heavenly domain, it was not much different.</p><p>After flying for several days, a large river stretched across the land in front of them.</p><p>The river was extremely wide, and one could not see the other side at a glance.</p><p>The water in the river was yellow, sticky, and filled with a nauseating stench.</p><p>This was the netherworld!</p><p>It was said that the water of the yellow spring had a terrifying corrosive, devouring, and cursing power.</p><p>Once they fell into the yellow spring, only death awaited them. It was said that even the heavenly Emperor realm powerhouses would be in danger if they fell into the yellow spring.</p><p>As for the yellow spring, no one knew how long it was.</p><p>No one really knew. No one knew where the source was, and no one knew where it flowed.</p><p>Some people walked along the yellow spring and found that the yellow spring flowed into the eternal void. Along the void, it would pass through the passage between the taiqing heavenly realm and the Hunyuan heavenly realm, which was the current battlefield.</p><p>This was their hope, and they were going to advance along the yellow Springs.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>A dense crowd of alien races had gathered by the yellow spring River, and they were charging toward them.</p><p>not good! It seems that the foreign tribes have guessed that we are coming to the yellow Springs and have gathered a large number of experts here!</p><p>Someone’s expression changed.</p><p>“Kill them from the other side!”</p><p>One of the Grand elders of the immemorial body cultivators shouted, and everyone rushed in another direction.</p><p>However, not long after, a large number of foreign races also came from that direction.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>A Grand Elder shouted, and everyone rushed over.</p><p>They were already at the edge of the yellow spring. There was only hope if they rushed over.</p><p>The powerhouses from both sides collided fiercely.</p><p>On Lu Ming’s side, everyone below the rank of a martial Supreme had been kept into the small world. Those who were left outside were all powerhouses above the rank of a martial Supreme.</p><p>With some of the strongest body cultivators, the Grand Supreme elders, as the vanguard, they were like a sharp blade, charging into the non-humankind Army.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Countless alien races were killed and exploded.</p><p>However, there were also powerhouses in the alien race, including those in the heavenly Emperor realm. The heavenly Emperor realm was too terrifying. Once they made a move, they could destroy the world.</p><p>Lu Ming and the group’s attacks were immediately blocked and their speed slowed down.</p><p>Behind them, a large number of alien races charged forward, and the two sides were engaged in a bloody battle.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared and went berserk.</p><p>The nine types of laws covered Lu Ming’s body. At the same time, Lu Ming activated the imperishable golden body.</p><p>The inextinguishable golden body, coupled with Lu Ming’s current physical strength, burst out with infinite power.</p><p>Lu Ming completely ignored his defense. Like a war beast, he charged into the alien races and punched out with both fists.</p><p>With every punch, at least a few alien races were blown up by Lu Ming.</p><p>As long as he was not a great emperor, no matter what rank true emperor he was, he would be killed in an instant by Lu Ming.</p><p>Even if it was a rank 18 true Emperor, it was the same!</p><p>Lu Ming was now truly invincible among true emperors!</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming had already killed countless alien races and his body was bathed in their blood.</p><p>Slowly, they broke through the non-humankind’s defense and came to the shore of the yellow spring.</p><p>“Bring out the heavenspan battleship!”</p><p>One of the Grand elders shouted. At the same time, he waved his hand and a battleship flew out, floating above the yellow spring.</p><p>you guys control the ancestral battle bodies to defend against the alien races. We’re going to activate the sky warship!</p><p>A voice spread in all directions.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Following that, the Grand Supreme elder’s body rumbled as a stream of vital energy and blood gushed out and entered the sky-reaching warship.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The warship trembled and buzzed. A terrifying aura emanated from it as it rapidly grew in size.</p><p>It was impossible to leave the yellow Springs without a powerful treasure.</p><p>Once a person entered the netherworld and touched the water of the netherworld, only death awaited them. Even the celestial Thearch would be in danger.</p><p>Only by relying on the ancestral treasure of the immemorial body cultivators, the sky-reaching battleship, could one enter the netherworld and ride on the sky-reaching battleship to the eternal void.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Following that, a few more Grand Supreme elders who were body cultivators stimulated their blood Qi and surged it into the sky-reaching battleship. The trembling of the sky-reaching battleship became more and more intense, and its entire body glowed as it rapidly expanded.</p><p>“Stop them! Kill! Kill!”</p><p>kill! the alien race members roared. They charged over from all directions.</p><p>There were five to six foreign races who were astonishingly powerful. They were all powerhouses of the heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p>They walked in the air, emitting terrifying fluctuations. With a single blow, the heavens and earth would shatter. Their power was unimaginable.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>Some of the elders of the immemorial body cultivators roared.</p><p>They were no match for them, so they could only rely on those zombies.</p><p>They controlled the zombies and charged forward.</p><p>Some of the zombies had the battle strength of the heavenly Emperor realm and were able to resist the heavenly Emperor of the alien race.</p><p>However, they were outnumbered and were suppressed the moment they met.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Some of the great emperor realm zombies were hit by the non-human heavenly Emperor and exploded in the air.</p><p>But now, he had no choice but to sacrifice these zombies to buy time for the Grand Elder.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>After a while, the sky-reaching warship expanded to tens of thousands of meters in size and landed on the yellow spring River.</p><p>get on the sky connecting battleship! We’ll cover you!</p><p>One of the Grand elders roared and charged over to fight with the non-human Celestial Emperor.</p><p>The other Grand elders also rushed over.</p><p>As for those with weaker cultivation bases, they charged towards the heavenspan battleship.</p><p>This was especially so for those who cultivated nomological laws. As their small worlds had a large population, the Archean body cultivators protected them and allowed them to board the sky-reaching warship first.</p><p>Lu Ming, Ren Chan, and the rest also boarded the warship.</p><p>Then, the others boarded the warship one after another. Only the Grand Supreme elder and some powerful zombies fought with the other party..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
