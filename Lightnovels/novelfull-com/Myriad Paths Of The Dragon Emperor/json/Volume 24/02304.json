They looked like they were ready to draw their swords. However, when they looked at Lu Ming, their eyes were burning with passion.</p><p>Lu Ming only reacted after a long while.</p><p>well, seniors, I cultivate the nomological system. I don’t have any plans to abandon the nomological system and focus on cultivating my physical body!</p><p>Lu Ming still answered honestly.</p><p>It was not easy for him to achieve his current achievements in all kinds of laws. He had paid too much.</p><p>Furthermore, his nomological system was unprecedented and unprecedented. In the future, he could master even more ultimate maxims. How could he give them up just like that?</p><p>“You still want to cultivate the system of laws? Kid, let me tell you, your talent in body cultivation is definitely higher than the system of laws, do you understand?”</p><p>it’s a waste if you don’t cultivate your physical body. Don’t ruin your future!</p><p>More than ten old men panicked and tried to persuade Lu Ming.</p><p>“Seniors, I’ve already decided and 1 won’t change my mind, but…”</p><p>Lu Ming rolled his eyes and a smile appeared on his face, however, I can have dual cultivation. I can cultivate both the nomological system and my physical body. Seniors, what do you think?”</p><p>“Cultivate together?”</p><p>The dozen or so old men quieted down and looked at each other.</p><p>boy, the path of cultivation is extremely difficult. It takes a lot of energy to cultivate one of them. Many people can’t reach the peak of one of them in their entire lives. If you want to cultivate two, I’m afraid you can’t bite off more than you can chew!</p><p>“That’s right, you won’t be able to cultivate either!”</p><p>More than ten old men criticized Lu Ming severely.</p><p>senior, I understand that, but I’m different from other people. With my unprecedented talent, it’s definitely not a problem for me to cultivate the system of laws and the body together!</p><p>Lu Ming said ‘shamelessly’. His face did not turn red and his heart did not beat fast.</p><p>this kid is simply shameless!</p><p>however, what he said makes sense. With his talent, it’s indeed difficult for anyone to compare with him!</p><p>“Are we just going to teach him the seven Gods mysterious technique?”</p><p>he doesn’t specialize in physical cultivation. It’s not good to teach him like this. The ‘Seven Gods mysterious skill’ is the highest secret of physical cultivation. It can be cultivated to the legendary Supreme realm. In my opinion, we should ask the Grand Elder for instructions!</p><p>“That’s right, I think so too!”</p><p>More than ten old men gathered to discuss. After a while, one of them said to Lu Ming, kid, you wait here. We’ll go and ask the Grand Elder!</p><p>After saying that, the old men left.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ve actually cultivated the little heaven mysterious skill to perfection in a month’s time. How did you do it?”</p><p>Honglu walked over, extremely surprised.</p><p>Ren Chan also sized Lu Ming up curiously. She had cultivated it before, but she could only cultivate to the third level. If she wanted to continue to improve, she would have to spend a lot of energy. She knew the difficulty.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was able to cultivate it to the peak in one go. This was simply a miracle.</p><p>I don’t know either. 1 just casually cultivated for a while and I reached perfection. Is it that difficult?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked in surprise.</p><p>Ren Chan and Hong Lu’s eyelids kept twitching, their mouths agape and tongue tied, completely unable to speak, so depressed that they wanted to vomit blood.</p><p>He was completely shocked.</p><p>“Um, it’s not difficult…”</p><p>After holding it in for a long time, Honglu squeezed out such a sentence.</p><p>“It should be related to the ancestral dragon’s blood …”</p><p>Lu Ming was thinking.</p><p>He felt that the reason he was able to cultivate the little heavenly mystery technique to perfection in one go was largely related to the drop of ancestral dragon blood.</p><p>As he cultivated to the later stages, the energy in the ancestral dragon’s blood was constantly being refined. This was how Lu Ming managed to cultivate the minor heaven mysterious skill to perfection in one go.</p><p>Then, Ren Chan asked Lu Ming about the cultivation method of the minor heaven mysterious skill. They chatted while waiting.</p><p>They didn’t have to wait long before the dozen old men returned.</p><p>kid, we’ve already asked the Supreme elder. He thinks that your talent is rare, and it would be a pity if you don’t cultivate your body. So, the Supreme elder has agreed to teach you the seven Gods mysterious skill. Take it!</p><p>One of the elders said. He then took out a roll of animal skin and handed it to Lu Ming.</p><p>the cultivation method of the seven Gods mysterious technique is recorded on it. Remember this and return this beast skin to us!</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming expressed his gratitude and was overjoyed. He took the animal skin and looked at it carefully.</p><p>Not long after, he had memorized all the contents of the beast skin and returned it to the elders.</p><p>Lu Ming closed his eyes and carefully comprehended the contents.</p><p>The seven Gods mysterious technique was a Supreme technique in physical cultivation, and it was much more exquisite than the minor heavenly mysterious technique.</p><p>The seven Gods mysterious technique was divided into seven levels. Each level was further divided into the early stage, middle stage, and late stage. Lu Ming spent a total of seven days before he roughly understood the contents of the first few levels. Then, he began to cultivate.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>His muscles, bones, internal organs, and even every drop of blood were giving off a wonderful vibration. Waves of wonderful power seeped into every corner of Lu Ming’s body and every cell.</p><p>Lu Ming’s physical body was undergoing a transformation.</p><p>The first two stages of the seven Gods mysterious technique were also for building a solid foundation. It was very similar to the later stages of the minor heaven mysterious technique. Lu Ming was very successful in cultivating the first two stages and very soon, he succeeded.</p><p>Seven days later, Lu Ming had attained the third stage of the seven Gods mysterious technique.</p><p>When the seven Gods mysterious skill was cultivated to the third level, he could compete with the void Emperor with his physical strength alone.</p><p>At the fourth level, one could fight against a true Emperor with just the strength of their body.</p><p>The fifth level corresponded to great emperors!</p><p>The sixth level corresponded to the celestial Thearch!</p><p>And the highest seventh level corresponded to the Supreme realm!</p><p>After attaining the third stage, Lu Ming’s cultivation speed had slowed down. He kept on circulating the seven Gods mysterious technique, and the drop of ancestral dragon blood in his heart was constantly circulating energy throughout Lu Ming’s body. As the seven Gods mysterious technique circulated, it seeped into every cell in Lu Ming’s body, continuously strengthening his physical body.</p><p>Time passed day by day. Lu Ming was also constantly breaking through.</p><p>The early stage of the third level, the middle stage, the late stage …</p><p>After two months, Lu Ming had finally cultivated the seven Gods mysterious technique to the late-stage of the third level.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not stop. He felt that he could continue to break through.</p><p>In the past two months, Ren Chan, Hong Lu, and a dozen elders had been watching nearby.</p><p>genius, what a genius! He cultivated the seven Gods mysterious skill to the late-stage of the third level in one go, and he didn’t show any signs of stopping!</p><p>“This has never happened since ancient times!”</p><p>The dozen or so old men exclaimed in admiration.</p><p>At this moment, a few burly men flew over with grave expressions and reported,” elders, there’s bad news. Outside the exit, where our ancestor is slumbering, a large number of alien races have gathered. They’ve already launched an attack, and they’re very powerful!</p><p>“They’re here. Let’s go and gather all the experts!”</p><p>An elder’s eyes were cold, and he exuded a powerful aura..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
