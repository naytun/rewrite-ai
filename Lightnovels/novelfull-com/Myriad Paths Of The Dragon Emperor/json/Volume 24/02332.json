Could he fight against the great emperor?</p><p>“Let’s go and try!”</p><p>Lu Ming ended his cultivation and flew in one direction of two world city.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming came to an extremely open area.</p><p>It was a drill ground in two world city. The Army and experts of two world city usually trained here.</p><p>From afar, Lu Ming could see a few huge light barriers that looked like a few big bowls that were upside down on the ground.</p><p>All around the light barrier, there were different living beings.</p><p>There were humans and all sorts of divine beasts.</p><p>Lu Ming looked over and saw more than ten true dragons circling the body. They were suspended in the air and were looking at one of the light shields seriously.</p><p>There were also eight to nine phoenixes and more than ten Qilin…</p><p>Here, divine beasts that were rarely seen in other places could be seen everywhere.</p><p>The two world city had gathered almost half of the Supreme pure heaven region1 s powerhouses.</p><p>BOOM! boom!</p><p>Violent rumbles came from the few light barriers. Someone was fighting inside.</p><p>Lu Ming flew over and came to one of the light shields.</p><p>Inside, a human powerhouse and a huge heavenly snake were fighting against each other.</p><p>Both of them were true emperors with the battle power of a level fifteen true Emperor. They were considered top experts among true emperors.</p><p>The living beings standing around the light barrier were ail at the true Emperor realm.</p><p>“This is the place where the true emperors fight!”</p><p>Lu Ming s heart stirred.</p><p>These light barriers were like battle platforms. They were places for the cultivators of two world city to battle and train themselves.</p><p>The light shield was formed by a formation and was firm and immortal. One could unleash their power as much as they wanted in the battle.</p><p>After all, it was too dangerous to train on the battlefield outside two world city. A single mistake could cost him his life.</p><p>Therefore, many people fought and killed each other here to train themselves.</p><p>Of course, the effect was definitely not as good as on the battlefield, because it was impossible to kill the other party here. At most, they would be seriously injured.</p><p>“Lu Ming…”</p><p>“It’s Lu Ming!”</p><p>The moment Lu Ming arrived, many people recognized him and caused a commotion. Many people s faces changed.</p><p>Could it be that Lu Ming was going to make a move? who in the true Emperor realm could be his match?</p><p>Five years ago, Lu Ming could already kill a rank-18 true Emperor with ease. Now that five years had passed, Lu Ming must have become even more unfathomable.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had no intention of making a move.</p><p>He had no interest in the true Emperor realm, as it was of no use to him.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at it for a while and walked towards another light shield.</p><p>This light barrier was more than ten rimes larger than the previous one. Light flowed and flickered with a metallic luster.</p><p>Inside, there were two figures constantly clashing with each other. Terrifying rumbles shook the hearts of the people.</p><p>The energy shot out in all directions, but it was blocked by the light shield. The light shield kept shaking, but it was not shattered.</p><p>“Great emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming s eyes lit up.</p><p>The ones fighting within the light barrier were great emperor realm experts.</p><p>There were also a few people watching around the light barrier, but the number was much smaller.</p><p>In the heaven realm, there were many true emperors, no less than void emperors.</p><p>This was because it was not particularly difficult to break through to the true Emperor realm from the void Emperor realm.</p><p>As long as he had three types of laws, reached the second realm, and his cultivation reached the peak of the seven-star void Emperor realm, he would be able to make a breakthrough.</p><p>As long as one s talent wasn’t too bad, it wouldn’t be difficult to break through after a long time.</p><p>However, breaking through to rhe great emperor realm wasn’t something that could be endured.</p><p>To break through to the great emperor realm, one had to have nine types of laws and reach the third realm. At the very least, one of them had to be a King path law.</p><p>Those who were not talented enough would never be able to reach this level in their entire lives.</p><p>Not to mention, he had comprehended a great Dao with nine types of nomological laws.</p><p>There might not even be one great emperor out of a hundred true emperors.</p><p>A great emperor was considered a first-class expert in the heaven realm. He would be respected wherever he went.</p><p>Therefore, it was normal for great emperors to be rare here.</p><p>“Lu Ming…”</p><p>The great emperors gazes flickered when they saw Lu Ming walking over.</p><p>Could it be that Lu Ming wanted to spar with the great emperor?</p><p>Not only did rhe great emperors think so, but the true emperors from before also thought so.</p><p>Lu Ming went to the Emperor battlefield. Does he want to spar with the Emperor?”</p><p>Someone in the true Emperor area exclaimed.</p><p>that’s impossible. The difference between a true Emperor and a great emperor is too great. Even if Lu Ming can easily kill a level 18 true Emperor, it’s hard to fight against a great emperor!</p><p>“In history, no one has ever been able to fight a great emperor with the cultivation of a true Emperor!”</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Many true emperors were flying toward the battle.</p><p>Even the battle between the void thearchs in the distance was alarmed. Many void thearchs also flew over to watch from a distance.</p><p>Lu Ming did not speak. He stared at the two people inside the light shield.</p><p>The two people inside the light shield should be two star great emperors, and their battle was extremely intense.</p><p>BOOM! boom!</p><p>The two of them controlled rhe power of the great path and continued to bombard it, developing terrifying attacks. Soon, the two were evenly matched, and neither could win. It was a draw, and they were forced out of the light shield.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what are you doing here? Don’t tell me you’re looking for a great emperor to fight!”</p><p>At this moment, a voice was heard. A burly middle-aged man walked over.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and did not hide anything.</p><p>He had come to find a great emperor to fight and test his combat power.</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming actually wanted to fight a great emperor. He was so confident.</p><p>“A true Emperor fighting a great emperor? hehehe, I’ve never heard of that. Aren’t you being too arrogant?”</p><p>The middle-aged man sneered and revealed a mocking expression.</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes slightly.</p><p>This person ridiculed him the moment he arrived. It seemed like he was very unhappy with him.</p><p>Which force are they from?</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>“What’s your cultivation level?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“One star great emperor!”</p><p>The middle-aged man replied.</p><p>alright, it’s you then. I challenge you now. Come in and have a fight!</p><p>Lu Ming was very direct. He challenged the other party directly. With that, he stepped into the light shield.</p><p>If one entered from the outside, the light shield would not have the slightest reaction. However, if there was a force inside, the light shield would produce a strong defense.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming actually challenged him, the middle-aged man’s eyes glowed with a cold light.</p><p>“Everyone, Lu Ming was too arrogant and challenged me first. I didn’t bully rhe weak or the strong!”</p><p>The middle-aged man said with an excited expression.</p><p>Initially, he wanted to find a reason to challenge Lu Ming. He did not expect Lu Ming to challenge him first. It was exactly what he wanted.</p><p>Although he was only a one-star great emperor and had comprehended an ordinary great Dao, he was confident that he could easily suppress Lu Ming.</p><p>A great emperor wasn’t someone a true Emperor could compare to.</p><p>The top heaven’s favorites who mastered one supreme law, eight King path laws and cultivated them to the third level only had the battle power of a rank 18 true Emperor.</p><p>Even the weakest great emperor was much stronger than a rank 18 true Emperor.</p><p>A true Emperor couldn’t be a match for a great emperor.. This was the truth!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
