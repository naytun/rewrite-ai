They found a hidden place and hid, planning to cultivate in peace here.</p><p>To Lu Ming, who was at his current stage, it was a great opportunity for him to comprehend the laws here. It could save him a lot of time.</p><p>Even if he could not get any other opportunities, Lu Ming was satisfied.</p><p>Lu Ming was comprehending the laws in peace, while Emperor formless and the others were focused on refining the fragments of the great Dao, hoping to take a step further and become three star great emperors.</p><p>Time passed day by day.</p><p>During this period, Emperor formless, huntian, and Sky Fire Emperor would take turns to go out and gather information and investigate the current situation.</p><p>Right now, on the island, whether it was the heaven realm beings or the foreign race experts, they were all like them. They had all hidden themselves and did not dare to move.</p><p>That was because there were four terrifying godly beasts in the depths of the island. Two of them were guarding the core area, while the other two were wandering around. Once they discovered any living being from the heaven realm or the evil god race, they would immediately start a massacre.</p><p>Therefore, it was impossible for those powerhouses to have any ideas about the core area.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he cultivated in peace and did not care about anything else.</p><p>To Lu Ming, the void Island was more useful than any cultivation sanctuary. Where else could he find such a good cultivation sanctuary after leaving the void Island?</p><p>However, there was one thing that Lu Ming would not forget.</p><p>That was the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body.</p><p>Previously, in the giant tower, Lu Ming had killed a large number of evil god tribe members. There were fifty to sixty of them.</p><p>The evil god race’s storage rings were all in his hands.</p><p>These evil god race members were all Emperor realm figures. There were large amounts of black crystals in their storage rings. Furthermore, they were of extremely high quality and contained powerful energy.</p><p>Although it was difficult for the beings in the heaven realm to absorb these crystals, the celestial Emperor’s body could absorb and store energy.</p><p>Lu Ming diverted some of his attention to control the celestial Thearch’s physical body to absorb the energy of these crystals and store them.</p><p>Just like that, time flew by. Spring went and autumn came. Five years had passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>This could be said to be the longest closed-door cultivation Lu Ming had ever done since he started cultivating.</p><p>Lu Ming had gained a lot from this closed-door cultivation.</p><p>Lu Ming had cultivated the eternal law, the void law, and the space-time law to the third level.</p><p>However, the remaining two of the top ten laws, the law of fate and the law of cause and effect, were very difficult to cultivate.</p><p>The law of fate was extremely mysterious and difficult to grasp. Lu Ming had tried a few times but could not get a grasp of it.</p><p>As for the laws of cause and effect, normally only people from the Buddhist faction could comprehend it.</p><p>Buddhism emphasized the cycle of karma. Without that state of mind, it was very difficult to comprehend.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had already cultivated the eight types of ultimate laws to the third realm. His comprehension of the laws had reached an astonishing level. With his amazing comprehension, Lu Ming had managed to gain a basic understanding of the laws of karma.</p><p>Not only that, but Lu Ming had also comprehended other King path laws in the past five years.</p><p>For example, Lu Ming had cultivated a total of three laws to the third level, including the law of eternal flame, the law of Vajra, and the law of kings, which were required to cultivate the indestructible ancient scroll.</p><p>Furthermore, Lu Ming had spent a lot of time to merge these laws and develop them into a divine power.</p><p>In five years, not only had he comprehended three strongest nomological laws and three king path nomological laws to the third realm, but he had also managed to turn them into divine powers. This was definitely impossible in the outside world. It would probably take more than a hundred years.</p><p>But here, he had done it in five years.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming already had seventeen types of laws and had reached the third realm. The power of the seventeen types of laws fused together was shocking.</p><p>However, there was not much improvement in Lu Ming’s combat strength.</p><p>The main thing was that Lu Ming’s current physical realm was too high. He could suppress a four star great emperor with his physical body alone.</p><p>In the great emperor realm, the further one advanced, the stronger one was, and the greater the gap between them.</p><p>However, nomological laws were just nomological laws. They couldn’t be compared to the great Dao, no matter how many nomological laws there were.</p><p>Lu Ming might be able to rely on a large number of laws to challenge one star great emperors or even two star great emperors. However, it would be very difficult to challenge them with laws alone as he advanced.</p><p>Unless Lu Ming could use these laws to break through to the great emperor realm and evolve them into great DAOs, the power would increase dramatically.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had no intention of breaking through to the great emperor realm now. At the very least, he wanted to cultivate all ten of his ultimate maxims to the third realm.</p><p>He could even cultivate even more of his King path laws to the third realm. When he broke into the great emperor realm, his great Dao would be shocking.</p><p>Lu Ming found it hard to imagine and he was filled with anticipation.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming estimated that if he went all out now, he should be able to suppress an ordinary five star great emperor, but he would definitely not be a match for a six star great emperor.</p><p>As for the celestial Thearch’s body, it had absorbed a large amount of the evil god tribe’s Black crystals and had been filled with energy a long time ago.</p><p>That’s right, the energy stored in the heavenly Emperor’s corporeal body had reached one hundred percent. Now, with the corporeal body, it was enough to compete with a peak great emperor.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this time, a figure flickered over. It was Emperor notionless. He had gone out to inquire about news earlier.</p><p>With the return of Emperor formless, huntian Emperor and Sky Fire Emperor also opened their eyes.</p><p>“Everyone, there’s important news outside!”</p><p>Emperor formless said hurriedly as soon as he returned.</p><p>“What news?”</p><p>Lu Ming was interested.</p><p>during this period of time, the powerhouses from the heaven realm and the evil god tribe have reached an agreement. They plan to join forces to deal with the Four Divine Beasts and enter the core area!</p><p>Emperor Wu Xiang said.</p><p>“Join forces? The Four Divine Beasts have reached the heavenly Emperor realm. Even the weakest heavenly Emperor is far more powerful than a great emperor. Even if the two of them join forces, they can’t be a match for a heavenly Emperor!”</p><p>The sky Fire Emperor was suspicious.</p><p>that’s right. However, this matter has already alerted the various celestial emperors outside the island. The celestial emperors here in the heaven realm are planning to send two heaven Dao soldiers to kill the Four Divine Beasts!</p><p>Emperor Wu Xiang said.</p><p>“Heaven Dao soldiers!”</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest widened their eyes in shock.</p><p>What a huge investment, to actually support two heaven Dao soldiers. Clearly, the various heavenly emperors outside the void God Island placed great importance on the core region of the void God Island.</p><p>it’s said that the heavenly emperors borrowed them from a few peerless powerhouses. The heavenly Emperor powerhouses of the evil god tribe also took out a few combat weapons of the same level to deal with a few divine beasts!</p><p>Emperor Wu Xiang said.</p><p>“When do we make our move?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>in at most half a month. Right now, the heaven realm and the evil god tribe’s powerhouses are discussing their plan of action!</p><p>Emperor Wu Xiang said.</p><p>Lu Ming muttered to himself. In the end, he decided to make a trip.</p><p>He couldn’t miss the core area.</p><p>The Four Divine Beasts ‘combat strength had barely reached the level of a Celestial Emperor. If multiple peak great emperors activated the heaven Dao soldiers, they might be able to kill the Four Divine Beasts and enter the core area.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was not weak to begin with. His ability to survive was even stronger. Furthermore, he had the celestial Thearch’s physical body. It was not impossible for him to try his luck.</p><p>“Lu Ming, if you’re going, you must be careful!”</p><p>Emperor formless and the others warned.</p><p>With Emperor formless and the others ‘cultivation, they definitely couldn’t go. Anyone below the level of a high-level great emperor would only be courting death..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
