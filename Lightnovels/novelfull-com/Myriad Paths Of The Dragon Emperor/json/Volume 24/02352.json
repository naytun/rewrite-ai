Naturally, there were many ancient ruins and buildings on it.</p><p>Many of them were left behind by the disciples of that unparalleled existence, and they usually contained some treasures.</p><p>As for the void Divine Tower, it was a famous building within a large region. It was discovered by experts from both the evil god race and heaven realm at the same time. Right now, both sides were fighting for the control of the void Divine Tower. When many people heard the news, they all rushed over to the void Divine Tower.</p><p>Emperor formless and the other two had also rushed there after hearing the news. They didn’t expect to encounter the evil god tribe on the way and be chased all the way.</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded after hearing that.</p><p>To be honest, he had been on the void God Island for more than a year, yet he had never seen the buildings here. He could not help but feel curious.</p><p>Lu Ming, do you want to go and take a look together? there might be many treasures inside. There might even be heaven Dao soldiers!</p><p>Emperor Wu Xiang said.</p><p>At the mention of the heaven Dao soldier, even Emperor Wuxiang and the others ‘eyes burned with passion. The heaven Dao soldier was too precious. Even the celestial Emperor would fight for it, so how could ordinary people not be tempted?</p><p>alright, I’ve been in closed-door cultivation all this time. I’m thinking of going around!</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Emperor formless and the other two immediately led the way. The group of four headed in the direction of the void God Pagoda.</p><p>&Nbsp; their luck was pretty good, and they didn’t encounter the evil god race for the next few days.</p><p>Three days later, they arrived at their destination.</p><p>From far away, they could see a huge tower that seemed to be made of bronze. It pierced through the sky and reached into the clouds.</p><p>When Lu Ming and the rest arrived at the bottom of the giant tower, they discovered a large number of people.</p><p>On one side, there were over 100 people from the evil god tribe.</p><p>On one side, there were more than 100 heaven realm beings.</p><p>These were all great emperor realm existences. At this moment, the two sides were in a confrontation, swords drawn and bows bent. The atmosphere was extremely oppressive.</p><p>Lu Ming’s group of four swept their gazes around and discovered that the bottom of the giant tower was full of potholes. They were all traces left behind by the great battle. They even saw the corpses of the evil god tribe and heaven realm beings who had died in battle.</p><p>It was obvious that a great battle had just taken place here not long ago.</p><p>Many people’s eyes were on Lu Ming’s group of four when they arrived.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s you!”</p><p>A cold voice sounded.</p><p>Lu Ming looked over and realized that there was a ‘familiar person’ in the crowd.</p><p>LAN mo was a great emperor from the LAN family. He had been defeated by Lu Ming in the two world city’s drill ground.</p><p>There were a few other people beside LAN mo. Their gazes were cold as they looked at Lu Ming. There was a faint killing intent in their eyes.</p><p>“Are they all from the LAN family?”</p><p>Lu Ming made a guess.</p><p>The moment they saw him, they revealed killing intent. Lu Ming guessed that those people were most likely from the LAN family or the Yan family.</p><p>Lu Ming ignored them and flew toward the heaven realm’s crowd with Emperor notionless and the other two to join them.</p><p>Some people were overjoyed. After all, the more people there were from the heaven realm, the stronger they would be.</p><p>Lu Ming sized it up and realized that there was a huge door on the giant tower. The door was closed and did not open.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest asked around and found out that there were many arrays around the gate. Previously, both parties had attacked the giant tower but they did not manage to break through.</p><p>Later on, a conflict broke out between the heaven realm and the evil god tribe, and both sides fought a great battle. However, the strength of both sides was similar, and there was no clear winner. Both sides suffered losses.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Not long after Lu Ming and the others arrived, the sound of air being torn rang out again. A few figures flew over. They were the people from the evil god tribe.</p><p>It was obvious that both sides had heard the news and rushed over.</p><p>As time passed, the number of people on both sides increased, but they did not make a move.</p><p>Both sides had similar strength, so they had their concerns.</p><p>Just like that, the tense atmosphere continued for seven to eight days.</p><p>everyone from the heaven realm, if this continues, none of us will be able to enter this giant tower. Why don’t we join forces and break the gate of this giant tower first? after we enter the giant tower, we’ll decide the winner.</p><p>At this moment, a burly member of the evil god race stepped out and spoke.</p><p>On the side of the heavenly realm, many people looked at each other, seeking the other’s opinion.</p><p>I think it’s feasible. It’s just a waste of time. It won’t be too late to kill the alien races after we enter the tower!</p><p>A blue-robed middle-aged man said.</p><p>This man was an expert from the LAN family. It was said that he had reached the three star great emperor realm and was one of the top experts in the heaven realm.</p><p>“I also think it’s feasible!”</p><p>Another three-star Emperor said.</p><p>Soon, both sides came to an agreement. They were going to break the door of the giant tower first, then talk about other things.</p><p>Both sides took up positions and started to attack from a distance.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>One attack after another broke through the void and blasted toward the gate of the giant tower.</p><p>There were a few hundred great emperors on both sides. The momentum of their combined attack was terrifying.</p><p>A few hundred attacks bombarded the gate. However, just as these attacks were about to land on the gate, the gate glowed and strange patterns appeared on it, forming a light shield.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>When the attacks landed on the light shield, they were all blocked by it. The light shield trembled continuously, but it was not broken.</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>Someone shouted, and everyone continued to attack.</p><p>On the evil god tribe’s side, almost all of them were using their third eye to launch attacks. Beams of destructive light transformed into all sorts of weapons and beasts that pounced toward the door.</p><p>On the side of the heaven realm, there were all kinds of Sacred Arts.</p><p>The great Dao interweaved, dazzling and colorful. There were all kinds of divine abilities, dazzling Lu Ming.</p><p>The formation was also shocking. So many great emperors had attacked it together, but it hadn’t been broken.</p><p>However, the light shield was shaking violently. It didn’t look like it could last much longer.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>A moment later, cracks began to appear on the light shield.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the end, the light shield exploded.</p><p>The attacks landed on the gate of the giant tower.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The door shook, but strangely, despite so many attacks, the giant tower did not shake at all. It was as steady as a rock.</p><p>Creak!</p><p>Then, under the barrage of attacks, the door slowly opened. A moment later, the door was fully opened.</p><p>However, behind the door, it was a blur. He couldn’t see what was behind the door at all.</p><p>“Enter!”</p><p>Someone from the evil god tribe shouted and rushed in.</p><p>“Let’s go in too!”</p><p>The heaven realm’s people roared and rose into the air one after another, rushing towards the gate.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest mixed in with the crowd and rushed in.</p><p>Hundreds of people rushed into the gate in an instant.</p><p>After Lu Ming and the rest rushed into the main door, they felt as if they had passed through a misty wall and appeared in an empty space.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>After they entered, the door automatically closed..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
