As long as you find the eight array discs, you can open this door!</p><p>The young formation spirit said.</p><p>“Eight formation disks? May I ask where the eight formation disks are?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>“In these mountains and rivers, in this Palace!”</p><p>The young man pointed at the mountains and palaces in front of them and said,” there could be formation disks in ail of these places, and all eight of them are in different locations!</p><p>“Alright, we’ll go get these formation disks!”</p><p>Someone said. Even though this place was vast, it shouldn’t be difficult to find the eight array discs.</p><p>“Wait, don’t worry, 1 still have one more condition!”</p><p>The formation Spirit’s gaze turned, and it swept toward the evil god race and the heaven realm’s people, you people should be divided into two groups. My condition is that only one group of people can go out!</p><p>in other words, only one group of you can survive and collect the eight array discs before leaving this place!</p><p>After saying this, the formation spirit laughed very happily, as if it was looking forward to it.</p><p>“Only one group of people can get out alive!”</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, everyone exuded a shocking aura and killing intent as they looked at each other.</p><p>“Just in time, let’s kill all these heaven realm beings and get out of here!”</p><p>Someone from the evil god race maliciously spoke.</p><p>“Kill us all? You’re the ones who will die!”</p><p>On the side of the heavenly realm, there were also people with cold killing intent.</p><p>The two sides were already at each other’s throats, and now, with the formation spirit setting such conditions, the situation could be imagined.</p><p>Instantly, the smell of gunpowder filled the air.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“You’re the one who’s going to die!”</p><p>The people closest to each other from both sides suddenly started fighting.</p><p>It was like a fuse that instantly ignited the entire scene.</p><p>kill! Kill the evil god race!</p><p>“Kill all these heaven realm bastards!”</p><p>&Nbsp; the people from both sides charged at each other and began an intense battle.</p><p>The scene continued to rumble. In the next moment, someone cried out miserably as he was killed.</p><p>Lu Ming, Emperor notionless, huntian Emperor, and Sky Fire Emperor were also engaged in battle with a few members of the evil god tribe.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not unleash his full power.</p><p>He realized that the difference in combat strength between the two sides was not big, so it should not be a life-and-death battle now.</p><p>Sure enough, after fighting for a while, more than a dozen people from both sides died in battle. The experts from both sides retreated one after another and began to confront each other.</p><p>The strength of the two sides was about the same. If they continued to fight, they were afraid that both sides would suffer losses, and at that time, no one would be able to leave.</p><p>The two sides confronted each other, swords drawn and bows bent!</p><p>in my opinion, let’s go look for formation disks first. Also, there must be some opportunities in this place. We’ll find the formation disks while looking for opportunities to kill the alien races and weaken their strength. Then, we’ll annihilate them all!</p><p>that’s right, I think it’s feasible too. If we encounter any opportunities, it can also enhance our strength. Then, it will be much easier to kill the alien races!</p><p>Some people were discussing in secret.</p><p>In the end, the heavenly realm came to an agreement.</p><p>However, the evil god tribe seemed to have a similar thought. After a short confrontation, both sides retreated.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>&Nbsp; in the end, the evil god race members headed to the right and charged towards the mountain and Palace.</p><p>“Let’s go too!”</p><p>The people from the heaven realm rushed to the right.</p><p>“I hope you guys have a good time!”</p><p>In the sky, the young formation spirit revealed a smile of anticipation, and with a flash, he disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming and the group flew for a distance.</p><p>“Wait a moment!”</p><p>Suddenly, someone called out. Everyone stopped and looked at the person who had just spoken.</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. It was the LAN family’s three star great emperor who had asked everyone to stop.</p><p>“Brother LAN, what’s the matter?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>“Among us, there are some who are not qualified to walk with us!”</p><p>The three-star great emperor from the LAN family, the middle-aged man, said coldly as he looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered, and the faces of notionless Emperor, huntian Emperor, and Sky Fire Emperor darkened.</p><p>The rest of the people also looked at Lu Ming and the rest with a look of realization.</p><p>The feud between Lu Ming and the LAN family was widely known in the heaven realm. Not many people did not know about it.</p><p>Now, the LAN family was going to make trouble.</p><p>Lu Ming, you guys should leave. You’re not welcome here!</p><p>The middle-aged man from the LAN family said coldly.</p><p>At the side, LAN mo sneered and stared at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>The people of the LAN family did not dare to kill Lu Ming openly because there were too many celestial thearchs standing behind him. If word of this got out, the LAN family would not be able to handle it.</p><p>However, they only asked Lu Ming to leave. In this way, the celestial Thearch behind Lu Ming could not say anything.</p><p>Right now, the heaven realm beings and the evil god race were at war with each other.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest had separated from the main group. Once they encountered the evil god tribe, they would definitely not let them off. They would kill them and weaken the strength of the heaven realm.</p><p>This was the LAN family’s plan.</p><p>let us leave. There are so many people here. The LAN family doesn’t have the final say!</p><p>Emperor formless replied.</p><p>“Oh? Is that so?”</p><p>The three star great emperor from the LAN family sneered. He then looked at the others and said,”Everyone, do you want to work with Lu Ming or the LAN family? if you want to work with Lu Ming, then go ahead. The LAN family will not play along!”</p><p>A group of people stood beside the LAN family’s three star great emperor. There were more than ten of them.</p><p>Among these people, there were people from the LAN family’s headquarters, and also people like the Yan family who had good relations with the LAN family.</p><p>Many people’s eyes flickered when they heard the words of the middle-aged man from the LAN family.</p><p>“I’m willing to cooperate with the LAN family!”</p><p>“I’m naturally willing to cooperate with brother LAN!”</p><p>Not long after, some people walked towards the LAN family with smiles on their faces.</p><p>This area was the outer region of the void God Island, and only low level great emperors were active here.</p><p>The four star great emperors and above had already entered the depths of the island to look for better opportunities.</p><p>This time, the person with the highest cultivation level among those who entered the formation was a three star great emperor.</p><p>There were only a few three star great emperors among them.</p><p>Each and every one of them was at the peak of their combat strength. Each and every one of them was extremely important in the fight for the array disc and the hunt for the evil god tribe.</p><p>The evil god tribe also had a few three star great sovereigns, and without them, they wouldn’t be able to fight against the evil god tribe.</p><p>This three star great emperor of the LAN family was almost at the peak of the three star great emperor realm, and his battle prowess was extremely shocking.</p><p>Cooperate with Lu Ming? What a joke, are you looking for death?</p><p>Now, they naturally chose to cooperate with the LAN family. In their impression, Lu Ming was merely a true Emperor. Although his combat strength was astonishing, he was at most equivalent to a one star great emperor. He would not affect the overall situation.</p><p>One by one, the heaven realm beings stood beside the LAN family. Lu Ming, Emperor formless, and the other two were slowly isolated.</p><p>The middle-aged man from the LAN family, LAN mo, and the others all smiled.</p><p>Lu Ming had left the team and was later killed by the evil god tribe. They could not be blamed for this..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
