Even though he knew that Lu Ming’s physical strength was very strong to begin with, Honglu was still shocked. This speed was too fast.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not stop. He was completely fascinated.</p><p>At every moment, he could feel his body becoming stronger and stronger. His muscles and bones were numb and itchy. There was a strange fluctuation. This feeling was too pleasurable and wonderful.</p><p>Lu Ming was completely immersed in his cultivation. He had completely forgotten himself and the time.</p><p>After the third level, Lu Ming began to cultivate the fourth level, then the fifth level, the sixth level…</p><p>The higher the level of cultivation, the greater the improvement Lu Ming had.</p><p>The minor heavenly mystery technique was originally cultivated for body cultivators to lay their foundations and strengthen their Foundation.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he had never cultivated any physical cultivation techniques in the past. His physical body was completely enhanced by external objects.</p><p>Such an improvement would inevitably lead to an unstable foundation. For example, there were some dead spots in the body that had not been tempered, which would lead to flaws.</p><p>And now, Lu Ming had reorganized his body.</p><p>Although his physical strength hadn’t improved much, the strength and quality of his body had a qualitative difference from before.</p><p>Furthermore, after reaching the sixth tier of the minor heavenly mystery technique, his Foundation had become very solid, and the strength of his physical body had begun to improve.</p><p>The seventh, eighth, ninth …</p><p>Lu Ming had used half a month to cultivate the little heaven mysterious skill to the ninth realm. Moreover, Lu Ming had no intention of stopping and was already attempting to break through to the tenth realm!</p><p>This caused Honglu to be extremely shocked.</p><p>“How is that possible? To be able to reach the ninth level of the little heavenly mystery technique in just half a month, and still continue to do so, he’s a peerless genius, a peerless genius in physical cultivation. We must report this to the elder!”</p><p>Hong Lu muttered to himself, then quickly left the place and reported this matter.</p><p>Not long after, streaks of light appeared here. More than a dozen old men had come, all of whom were elders of the ancient body cultivator lineage.</p><p>When these people saw Lu Ming, their eyes widened.</p><p>he’s already at the tenth level. Unbelievable!</p><p>a person who cultivates the nomological system is able to cultivate the little heavenly mysterious art to the tenth level in such a short time. He’s definitely a peerless genius!</p><p>1 wonder if he can successfully cultivate all twelve stages of the little heavenly mystery technique!</p><p>The dozen or so old men discussed excitedly and in shock.</p><p>Although the minor heavenly mystery technique was a technique that could solidify the foundation of body cultivators, it was also the most important technique. Only when the minor heavenly mystery technique was cultivated to a high enough level could one cultivate the core technique of body cultivators.</p><p>However, not everyone could cultivate the little heavenly mysterious skill to perfection. In fact, it was already very good to be able to cultivate it to the ninth level. He could be considered a genius in the physical cultivation line and his future achievements would be extraordinary.</p><p>As for the twelfth level, which was the highest level, there had not been many body cultivators since ancient times. Every one of them was a rare genius.</p><p>For example, Honglu was such a prodigy, but he took much longer than Lu Ming.</p><p>There was no one else who could cultivate the little heavenly mysterious art to this level in such a short time.</p><p>Everyone waited in silence.</p><p>After that, Ren Chan also ended her practice. She had only completed the third level so far. If she continued, she felt that she was not strong enough and needed time to slowly Polish it.</p><p>When she saw more than ten old men staring at Lu Ming without blinking, she was shocked.</p><p>After asking around, Xiang Honglu finally understood the whole story of the matter.</p><p>“What a pervert!”</p><p>Ren Chan sighed.</p><p>The physical cultivators might not know how freakish Lu Ming was, but she did. Lu Ming had mastered three ultimate maxims. He was an unprecedented figure in the system of maxims.</p><p>She could not help but sigh when she saw that Lu Ming was so perverted when he cultivated the body cultivation technique.</p><p>Lu Ming was unaware of everything that was happening outside. He was immersed in his cultivation.</p><p>Very quickly, he completed the cultivation of the tenth level and broke into the eleventh level.</p><p>He felt that his body was constantly strengthening and becoming tougher. His strength was also increasing.</p><p>In particular, there was a drop of ancestral dragon blood in his heart. As Lu Ming cultivated the little heaven mysterious skill, traces of energy surged into Lu Ming’s body from that drop of ancestral dragon blood. Lu Ming refined it and strengthened his physical body.</p><p>The eleventh level was not difficult for Lu Ming and he cultivated it successfully very quickly!</p><p>Then, it was the twelfth level!</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>It was also the last stage of the little mysterious heaven skill. At this stage, Lu Ming’s body was constantly trembling and buzzing. He could feel that his physical strength had reached an extreme.</p><p>A month after Lu Ming cultivated the minor heaven mysterious art, he finally cultivated it to perfection.</p><p>he’s succeeded! He’s succeeded! Heavens, he’s cultivated the little heavenly mystery technique to perfection in just a month! This kind of talent is too shocking!</p><p>we can’t waste his talent in physical cultivation. 1 think we should teach him the seven Gods mysterious technique!</p><p>“I agree!”</p><p>More than ten old men spoke excitedly one after another. Their eyes were shining. When they looked at Lu Ming, it was as if they were looking at a rare treasure.</p><p>Even Honglu was greatly shocked!</p><p>The elders actually wanted to pass the seven Gods mysterious technique to Lu Ming.</p><p>The seven Gods mysterious technique was completely different from the minor heavenly mysterious technique. The minor heavenly mysterious technique was only a technique used to build the foundation for physical cultivators. It was widely spread and everyone could cultivate it.</p><p>However, the ” Seven Gods mysterious technique ” was a core technique of the body cultivation lineage and one of the top secret techniques. Generally, only the geniuses of the body cultivation lineage could cultivate it. Honglu himself was cultivating this technique.</p><p>It could be seen how much the elders admired Lu Ming.</p><p>There was no one in the history of body cultivation who could cultivate the little heavenly mystery technique to perfection in just a month. This kind of talent was too shocking. It would be a waste if he did not cultivate the body cultivation technique.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming let out a long breath and opened his eyes.</p><p>my strength has doubled!</p><p>Lu Ming felt his strength and revealed a look of excitement.</p><p>His physical body had become much stronger and his strength had doubled. Coupled with the world force and various laws, Lu Ming’s combat strength had undoubtedly increased by another level.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that if he were to unleash his full power now, he could already reach the combat strength of a rank 18 true Emperor.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming swept his gaze across the room and was shocked. There were more than ten pairs of bright eyes staring at him.</p><p>“Little guy, how do you feel? Is your body much stronger?”</p><p>you’re a peerless genius in the world of body cultivators. How about this? in the future, you don’t have to cultivate the nomological system. Change to cultivating the body cultivation lineage. This old man will take you in as a disciple!</p><p>“Get lost, he’s my disciple!”</p><p>More than ten old men glared at him and started to fight over him. They all wanted to take Lu Ming as their disciple.</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
