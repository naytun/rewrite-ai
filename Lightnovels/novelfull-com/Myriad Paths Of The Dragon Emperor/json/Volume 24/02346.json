At the same time, he cast the indestructible ancient scroll to heal himself.</p><p>Of course, on the surface, he still had to pretend to be ‘weak’ to confuse them.</p><p>of course. In the beginning, we didn’t dare to attack you. However, when we encountered the evil god tribe a few times, I intentionally mentioned it and asked you to control that puppet to kill the evil god tribe. However, you didn’t do it. This made me suspect that your puppet requires energy. When you faced so many crows back then, I reckon that its energy must have been exhausted!</p><p>Wu Xiu sneered.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression darkened.</p><p>there’s no need to say anything more. Let’s kill him first. This person is a peerless heaven’s favorite. If we delay, things will change!</p><p>Wu Bo said.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Wu Xiu also nodded, his eyes flashing with a cold light.</p><p>!!..</p><p>They did not dare to be careless when it came to Lu Ming. The ambush just now was done by the two of them together and they used their full strength.</p><p>wait a minute, 1 was the one who saved you when we met those crows. Speaking of which, I’m also your Savior. Is this how you treat your Savior? ”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>“Savior? Hahaha, what kind of bullshit Savior is this? you’re a heaven’s pride expert, yet you still believe in this. In this world, benefits come first, do you understand?”</p><p>Wu Xiu laughed sarcastically.</p><p>Wu Bo sneered as well. The two of them walked toward Lu Ming.</p><p>However, the two of them were very cautious. They set up layers of defense around their bodies, afraid that Lu Ming would counterattack before he died.</p><p>Although the two of them had used their full strength in the surprise attack just now and the power was shocking, they were confident that it was a miracle that Lu Ming was not dead. They definitely had no way to resist.</p><p>However, they had to be cautious with Lu Ming’s reputation.</p><p>“Al!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming heaved a long sigh.</p><p>you don’t need to sigh. We will help you carry forward the fortuitous encounter you have!</p><p>Wu Xiu sneered.</p><p>“I’m sighing because I’m sighing that the ancient scripture I have will be lost from now on!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Ancient scripture?”</p><p>The eyes of Wu Xiu and Wu Bo lit up.</p><p>that’s right, the chaos ancient scripture!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Wu Xiu and Wu Bo’s eyes were burning with fire.</p><p>hand over the chaos ancient scripture and we can give you a quick death!</p><p>Wu Xiu said.</p><p>no, unless you promise to spare my life, I will give you the chaos ancient scroll and all my treasures. Otherwise, you can only take my treasures. Don’t even think about taking the chaos ancient scroll!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Wu Xiu and Wu Bo’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“What do we do?”</p><p>Wu Bo sent a voice transmission to Wu Xiu.</p><p>pretend to agree to give him two minutes to engrave the ancient chaos Scripture into the Jade talisman. He’s severely injured and won’t recover for a few days. He won’t be able to play any tricks in a few minutes!</p><p>Wu Xiu sent a voice transmission to Wu Bo, and the two of them nodded silently.</p><p>alright, we promise not to kill you. You can engrave the ancient chaos Scripture into the Jade talisman!</p><p>Wu Xiu said.</p><p>do you think I’ll believe you? swear, swear a blood oath!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>kid, you’re still negotiating with us. You should understand your situation. You’re not qualified to negotiate with us. If you keep talking nonsense, we’ll just give up the chaos ancient scroll and kill you right now. Your treasures will still be ours!</p><p>Wu Xiu said coldly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, hurry up and inscribe it. We don’t have time to waste on you!”</p><p>Wu Bo shouted coldly, his killing intent growing colder and colder.</p><p>“Alright, I hope you keep your word!”</p><p>Lu Ming said, pretending to be helpless. He took out a jade talisman and started to inscribe it.</p><p>Very soon, two minutes had passed but Lu Ming was still inscribing.</p><p>“Kid, why are you so slow? You better not play any tricks!”</p><p>Wu Xiu said coldly.</p><p>the chaos ancient scripture is the ancient scripture of the chaos Emperor. It is extremely profound. How can it be so easy to inscribe? if you want an incomplete ancient scripture, 1 will give it to you now!</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips in disdain.</p><p>“Lu Ming, we’ll give you three more minutes. If you’re still not done in three minutes, don’t blame us for being merciless!”</p><p>Wu Xiu said coldly.</p><p>He was still worried and felt that he could not delay any longer.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to inscribe.</p><p>Very quickly, three minutes had passed.</p><p>“Alright, I’m done!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming spoke. Then, he waved his hand and the Jade talisman flew towards Wu Xiu.</p><p>Wu Xiu was ecstatic. He reached out to take it and quickly checked it.</p><p>With one look, Wu Xiu was stunned, and then revealed a look of Fury.</p><p>“It’s empty. Lu Ming, how dare you lie to us …”</p><p>Wu Xiu roared.</p><p>However, at this moment, Lu Ming’s figure suddenly dashed out at an astonishing speed.</p><p>Behind Lu Ming, a pair of wings flapped rapidly. He charged straight into the passage and out of the cave.</p><p>“Damn it, chase!”</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Wu Xiu and Wu Bo were furious and chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>The three of them were extremely fast. They rushed out of the cave in an instant and flew into the distance.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s speed was extremely fast. Although Wu Xiu and Wu Bo tried their best, they could not catch up to Lu Ming at all.</p><p>“Damn it, why does he still have energy left?”</p><p>Wu Xiu and Wu Bo roared.</p><p>The two of them had joined forces to launch a surprise attack earlier, and their power was so astonishing that even the other two star great emperors would’ve died without a doubt.</p><p>It was already a miracle that Lu Ming did not die. They thought that Lu Ming must have been severely injured and would not have the energy to escape. They did not expect that Lu Ming could still burst out with such a shocking speed.</p><p>In fact, Lu Ming’s injuries were not as serious as they had thought.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current physical body was already extremely powerful. His defense and vitality were astonishingly strong.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming did not have much trust in Wu Xiu and Wu Bo. Secretly, Lu Ming had been circulating the imperishable golden body at all times, making his body as hard as a divine weapon.</p><p>The inextinguishable golden body coupled with his originally strong physical body had an astonishing defense. Even if Wu Xiu and Wu Bo suddenly launched a surprise attack and Lu Ming was severely injured, it was not to the point where he could not retaliate.</p><p>In addition, Lu Ming had deliberately wasted time by talking nonsense with the other party. He had circulated the indestructible ancient scroll to heal his injuries with all his might. Lu Ming’s injuries had already recovered a lot.</p><p>Just now, Lu Ming had pretended to inscribe the ancient chaos Scripture and handed the Jade talismans to the other party. As expected, Wu Xiu and Wu Bo were overjoyed and relaxed. Lu Ming took the opportunity to make a sudden move and successfully escaped.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you can’t escape. I’ve caught up to you, and I’m going to tear you into pieces!”</p><p>Wu Xiu roared.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He spread his six-feathered wings and flew at top speed. At the same time, the fallen star bow appeared in his hand.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Two nine-colored arrows flew toward Wu Xiu and Wu Bo. The two of them could only launch attacks to block the arrows. With their strength, although they could block the nine-colored arrows, it was inevitable that their bodies would be blocked, and their speed would be slowed down.</p><p>Lu Ming took the opportunity to distance himself quickly. The distance between the two of them was greatly widened..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
