Their temperature was astonishingly high, like more than a dozen small Suns. They kept pouncing at Lu Ming’s group of six at an astonishing speed and with terrifying power.</p><p>Lu Ming’s group of six tried their best to resist, but they were still in a precarious situation.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, there were two fiery red crows attacking Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming exerted all his strength and did not hold back at all. The long spear in his hand was constantly thrust out.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The sharp claws of the two fire-red crows collided with Lu Ming’s long spear. The long spear trembled continuously, and Lu Ming’s body trembled violently as he retreated continuously.</p><p>The two fiery-red crows had the combat strength of a one star great emperor. If there was only one, Lu Ming could still deal with it. However, with two of them, Lu Ming was at a disadvantage. His arms were numb from the shock. “Fight!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with fighting spirit. He circulated the indestructible ancient scroll and fought the two fiery-red crows.</p><p>With the indestructible ancient scroll’s terrifying defense and recovery ability, Lu Ming could still resist.</p><p>But the others were in danger.</p><p>The other one star great emperor realm old man was caught by one of the crows. A piece of his flesh was torn off and a deep wound appeared on his body. Blood flowed out from the wound, causing his face to turn pale and his aura to weaken.</p><p>The others were also surrounded by danger and could not even take care of themselves.</p><p>“Charge out!”</p><p>let’s go! someone shouted. They rushed down with all their might, trying to reach the ground and use the complicated terrain to get rid of the crows.</p><p>However, there were too many crows.</p><p>There were more than ten fiery red crows, all of which were at the great emperor realm. Crows below the great emperor realm formed groups and attacked continuously. To Lu Ming and the rest, they were a huge problem.</p><p>Therefore, they couldn’t get out at all.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Another person was hit by a fiery red crow’s wing and was almost cut in half at the waist. It was extremely dangerous.</p><p>“Everyone, in such a situation, let’s each take care of our own matters!”</p><p>At this moment, the middle-aged man suddenly spoke, causing the others ‘expressions to change.</p><p>“What do you want to do?”</p><p>An old man shouted with an ugly expression.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, the middle-aged man attacked with all his might.</p><p>The middle-aged man was a three star great emperor, and he was the strongest among them.</p><p>At this moment, he had knocked back a fiery-red Crow that was as powerful as a three star great emperor with one move. He seized the opportunity and rushed to the side.</p><p>He wanted to escape alone.</p><p>If he stayed behind with Lu Ming and the rest, he would only be exhausted to death by so many crows. However, with his strength, if he were to escape alone, a three star great emperor Crow would not be able to hold him back.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The others roared in anger. If this middle-aged burly man were to escape and the three star great emperor Crow attacked them, they would be in real danger. They might all die Here.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The crows screeched, and several fiery red crows surrounded the middle-aged man.</p><p>However, the only thing that could really pose a threat to him was the three star great emperor Crow. Therefore, under the desperate attack of the middle-aged man, a few crows were sent flying. After paying a little injury, he forcibly rushed out.</p><p>The middle-aged burly man turned into a streak of light and sped away. The others ‘hearts began to turn cold.</p><p>Without the middle-aged man, they would be finished.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p>Could it be that he was going to use the celestial Emperor corporeal body now?</p><p>Over the years, Lu Ming had given most of the black crystals that he had obtained from the alien races to the celestial Thearch’s body to absorb. The energy stored in the celestial Thearch’s body was extremely abundant.</p><p>If he were to use the celestial Thearch’s corporeal body, he would have no problem killing these crows.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had initially planned to keep the celestial Thearch’s body and use it when he entered the void Island.</p><p>A large number of great emperor experts had gathered on the island. There were people from both the heaven realm and the alien race. There were even quite a few peak great emperors.</p><p>In addition to the dangers of the void Island itself, Lu Ming planned to keep the celestial Thearch’s body and use it when he encountered danger.</p><p>It would be a pity to use it before entering the void God Island.</p><p>But now, it seemed that he had no choice but to use it.</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was thinking about this, a series of shrill screams rang out in the distance.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>It was the same crow’s cry, but this cry had the power to pierce through gold and crack rocks, as if it could tear space apart.</p><p>In the distance, a group of fiery red crows appeared.</p><p>Yes, it was a group of about twenty of them. They were all fire-red crows and all of them were at the great emperor realm.</p><p>Some of them had terrifying auras that were even stronger than the three star great Emperor’s Crow.</p><p>High-tier great emperors were above three star great emperors.</p><p>Other than Lu Ming, everyone’s faces turned pale.</p><p>They were already in a desperate situation, and now a group of even more terrifying crows had appeared. It was simply a dead end.</p><p>The dozen or so crows that came from behind all rushed towards the middle-aged man.</p><p>The middle-aged man’s face was pale and bloodless.</p><p>run! he roared, and his body emitted a brilliant light. His speed increased explosively as he tried to escape.</p><p>He was burning his life potential, causing his strength to increase by a large margin.</p><p>However, those crows were too terrifying. A few of them were extremely powerful. With a flap of their wings, they chased after the middle-aged man like red lightning.</p><p>Not long after, the middle-aged man was caught up.</p><p>Chi Chi…</p><p>A Crow, as large as a mountain, with its sharp claws, clawed at the middle-aged man.</p><p>The middle-aged man roared and exploded with all his power. He used his strongest move in an attempt to block it, but his attack was torn apart by the crow’s sharp claws, directly tearing half of his body off.</p><p>The middle-aged man screamed in pain and retreated. He let out a desperate roar.</p><p>Following that, the other terrifying crows had already arrived. The middle-aged man was unable to turn the situation around. Under the attack of the terrifying crows, his body was torn apart and then swallowed by them.</p><p>The middle-aged man wanted to escape alone, but he was the first to die.</p><p>The others were not happy that the middle-aged man had been killed. At this time, they only felt despair.</p><p>“We’re finished!”</p><p>Someone growled.</p><p>Now that the middle-aged man was dead, it was their turn.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what a pity!”</p><p>An old man looked at Lu Ming with a face full of pity.</p><p>Lu Ming was so young and so talented. His future achievements were limitless. It was very likely that he would become an invincible powerhouse in the heaven realm. It was a pity that he was going to die Here.</p><p>“Even if 1 die, I’ll kill a few!”</p><p>Another person shouted, planning to fight with his life on the line.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At that moment, the fiery-red Crow that had killed the middle-aged man had its eyes on Lu Ming and the rest. It flapped its wings and flew towards them at top speed. Its blood-red eyes were filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>it seems like I can only use the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. Then, a small stone statue appeared in his palm.</p><p>The stone statue rapidly grew in size, and it held a huge sword in its hand..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
