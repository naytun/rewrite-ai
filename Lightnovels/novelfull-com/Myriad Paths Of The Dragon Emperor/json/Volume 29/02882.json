Then, it looked extremely frightened.</p><p>He had never expected that Lu Ming, who was only at the ninth stage of true God Realm, would attack so quickly. He did not even see clearly how Lu Ming attacked, and the long spear in Lu Ming’s hand had already pierced his heart.</p><p>He knew that he had encountered a terrifying heaven’s favorite, a heaven’s favorite whose combat strength could not be measured by cultivation.</p><p>“Spare … Spare … My life …”</p><p>Blood kept oozing out of sanque’s mouth as it tried to beg for Lu Ming’s mercy.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. With a shake of the long spear, sanque’s body was torn into pieces and he died on the spot.</p><p>“Brat, you’re looking for death …”</p><p>The burly man who had attacked Lu Ming’s interplanetary warship earlier roared and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>His fourth-level celestial deity aura crushed towards Lu Ming violently, wanting to kill him.</p><p>“Divine Dragon phenomenon!”</p><p>A deep voice came out of Lu Ming’s mouth. Then, two nine-clawed divine Dragons appeared in the sky. The nine-clawed divine Dragons slithered and pounced toward the other party.</p><p>The two nine-clawed divine Dragons had eighteen claws in total. They tore through the air with astonishing power.</p><p>The burly man’s expression changed drastically. His palm turned pitch-black as he continued to slash out to clash with the nine-clawed Divine dragon’s claws.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Terrifying collisions continued to ring out. In an instant, they had exchanged dozens of blows.</p><p>The burly man’s expression changed drastically as he retreated. Blood spurted from his mouth as he was severely injured.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current cultivation, even if he did not transform into the ancient God Body, the power of the battle formula would be terrifying. It was not something that the other party could withstand.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>The two nine-clawed divine Dragons roared and continued to pounce at each other. Their dragon claws tore down and tore each other into pieces.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>Lu Ming had killed two experts in a row. The others were finally shocked. They exclaimed one after another, their faces full of disbelief.</p><p>At first, they thought that Lu Ming was only at true God-level and did not take him seriously at all. At this moment, Lu Ming’s unbelievable combat strength made them extremely frightened.</p><p>“Good, good …”</p><p>The seductive woman and the others were also at a loss for words at first, but they immediately revealed ecstatic expressions.</p><p>Lu Ming actually had such strong combat abilities. They were saved.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming changed his direction and shouted. Another nine-clawed Divine Dragon appeared in the sky. A total of three nine-clawed divine Dragons pounced on the others.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming waved his long spear and cast the three apocalyptic strikes at another person.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The crescent-shaped spear light struck down and a fourth-level heavenly God expert was split into two. Then, the three nine-clawed divine Dragons joined forces and killed the other fourth-level heavenly God.</p><p>It was a complete suppression!</p><p>“Go, quickly leave …”</p><p>The others were shocked and retreated in all directions.</p><p>Lu Ming rushed forward and killed two more people. He did not continue to pursue them. Soon, those people disappeared into the vast mountains.</p><p>The seductive woman and the rest looked at Lu Ming with eyes full of shock and horror.</p><p>They knew that they had met a peerless genius.</p><p>“Lu Ming, thank you for your help just now. I can’t thank you enough!”</p><p>The few of them thanked Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re really amazing. I was wrong about you. I apologize to you!”</p><p>The seductive woman turned her gaze and smiled sweetly. She twisted her slender waist and walked toward Lu Ming. She even threw him flirtatious looks, as if she was trying to seduce him.</p><p>Lu Ming cast an indifferent glance at the other party. He could not be bothered to say a word and turned to leave.</p><p>This woman had a snobbish look on her face. Previously, when she saw that Lu Ming’s cultivation was only at true God-level, she ridiculed and ridiculed him. Now that Lu Ming had revealed his amazing abilities, she immediately came to Lu Ming.</p><p>It could be said that he was extremely shameless.</p><p>brother Lu Ming, where are you going? I’ll go with you!</p><p>The seductive woman quickly followed Lu Ming.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and shouted coldly. His eyes were sharp and exuded a cold killing intent.</p><p>The seductive woman’s face turned pale and she stopped in her tracks, not daring to approach.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he turned into a ray of light, leaving the place.</p><p>this Lu Ming must be from the Qin heaven thirteen clans. He might even be a peerless genius from the three overlords. We’ve been wrong.</p><p>that’s right. People like you have very high standards. You’re delusional to think that you can seduce others with your kind.</p><p>The others looked at the seductive woman with ridicule, making the seductive woman so ashamed that she wanted to bleed.</p><p>……</p><p>After Lu Ming set out alone, he headed straight into the depths of the desolate mountain range.</p><p>Along the way, there were more scares than dangers. Not long after, Lu Ming was already halfway into the desolate mountain range.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming noticed that there were people constantly rushing in one direction.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered and he followed in that direction.</p><p>After flying for a while, a Lake appeared in front of them. Many people were gathered around the lake.</p><p>Everyone was staring at the lake.</p><p>“Could it be that the heart of desolation is here?”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>The water in the lake churned and the waves rose to the sky, creating thousands of waves.</p><p>Then, a shocking scene appeared. A violent explosion suddenly erupted from the bottom of the lake, blasting the water in the entire Lake into the sky.</p><p>The lake water splashed everywhere, revealing a dark cave below.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Tentacles suddenly reached out from the bottom of the cave.</p><p>However, these tentacles weren’t the tentacles of a living being. They were made of energy. After they were waved, they were like paths that paved the sky.</p><p>There were a total of 81 fish.</p><p>this is the path of vital Qi, and the heart of desolation is inside. Only by stepping on the path of vital Qi can one enter the cave and obtain the heart of desolation!</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>“The heart of desolation is mine,”</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Immediately, some people rushed towards the path of Origin Energy and landed steadily on it.</p><p>“Why, why can’t I step on it?” he asked.</p><p>“I can’t either!”</p><p>I understand now. A Yuan Qi path can only accommodate one person. Once one person steps on it, the other person can’t go up.</p><p>Someone saw through the trick.</p><p>Once one person in front of them stepped onto the path of vital Qi, if others wanted to continue, they would be blocked by a powerful force and be stopped outside the path.</p><p>One path of vital Qi could only accommodate one person.</p><p>There were a total of eighty-one paths, and only eighty-one people could enter the cave.</p><p>However, there were thousands of people here.</p><p>Out of thousands of people, only eighty-one people could enter.</p><p>After thinking this through, everyone’s eyes shone with a fiery light and they immediately made their moves.</p><p>“This path is mine, get lost!”</p><p>Someone exploded and launched a powerful attack at the person who stepped on the road.</p><p>Although they couldn’t enter, there was no obstruction to attack from the outside.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>arghh! a blood-curdling screech rang out. One of the vital Qi paths, a person with insufficient cultivation, was directly killed, and fresh blood splattered onto the vital Qi path.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
