The person who set up the array didn’t completely seal Lu Ming off. When he set up the array, he left a possibility behind, which is the array plate!</p><p>according to the speculations of several array Masters, there should be twelve array plates in the Galaxy. As long as we hold the array plate, we can enter the galaxy without any obstructions and obtain the star core!</p><p>therefore, your mission this time is to enter the galaxy and find an array plate. You must at least obtain an array plate!</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain said.</p><p>“Don’t worry sect master, this disciple will definitely do my best. Even if I have to risk my life, I will obtain an array plate!”</p><p>The Supreme Holy Son was the first to speak again.</p><p>the task this time won’t be easy. The other forces have also sent out all their geniuses. So, I’ll give you an array plate, at least one. Of course, the more the better!</p><p>also, those array plates are scattered on different planets in the Galaxy. It won’t be easy to find them.</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain said.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were silent and they started to think.</p><p>“It seems that the star core is very important to the Dragon Boat Mountain.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>however, although entering that Galaxy this time is dangerous for you, it’s also an opportunity!</p><p>countless years ago, there was an Almighty who set up an array here to refine the star into a star core. Now that the star core is formed, other treasures will appear in the Galaxy along the way, such as some extremely precious refining materials, and even star core fragments may appear.</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain said.</p><p>“A star core fragment?”</p><p>Lu Ming, the Supreme Holy Son, Ouyang Qingxiang, and the others ‘eyes lit up with a fiery light.</p><p>that’s right, it’s a star core fragment. After all, we’re going to refine this star into a star core. During the refining process, it’s very possible that some star core fragments will appear. If you can get a star core fragment, it’ll be a great opportunity.</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain said.</p><p>This made Lu Ming and the rest even more excited.</p><p>“Lu Ming, this is a great opportunity for you. If you can get some star core fragments, you’ll have a great chance to break through to the celestial God-level in one go. Don’t say I didn’t give you a chance!”</p><p>The Dragon Boat Mountain’s cold voice rang in Lu Ming’s ears.</p><p>There was a cold glint in Lu Ming’s eyes. He did not say anything.</p><p>Long Zhou’s boat naturally did not have good intentions when he warned Lu Ming. He wanted Lu Ming to break through to the heavenly God Realm so that he could be of use to him and help him break the trapping Dragon Rising to the heaven formation.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming was also very tempted by the star core fragment. He also had the intention to use the star core fragment to break through to the celestial God-level.</p><p>Naturally, the higher his cultivation level was, the better it would be for him in this battle with Dragon Boat Mountain.</p><p>“Whoever gets the array plate, I’ll definitely reward you handsomely. Alright, follow me!”</p><p>After Dragon Boat Mountain finished speaking, he turned around and headed in the direction of the Galaxy.</p><p>Lu Ming, Ouyang Qingxiang, the Supreme Holy Son, and the rest followed.</p><p>In another direction, the other geniuses of the Qin heavenly thirteen clans also arrived at the edge of the Galaxy under the lead of their respective sect leaders.</p><p>“The task I gave you is to get at least three out of the twelve array plates. Do you understand?”</p><p>The Dean of the unique demon Academy warned the geniuses of the unique demon Academy. He did not hide his voice and it spread far and wide, allowing everyone to hear him.</p><p>“Don’t worry, principal. We’ll definitely get three out of the twelve array plates!”</p><p>“No problem!”</p><p>The geniuses of the unique devil Academy spoke one after another. They were all very confident.</p><p>your unique demon Academy is quite confident. However, if I don’t destroy the sword sect, I will at least obtain three array plates. Are you confident? ”</p><p>Who are you? ” the sect leader of the eternal sword sect laughed coldly and asked the paragons of the eternal sword sect.</p><p>“There are!”</p><p>“Three array plates, I must get them!”</p><p>The Paragon of the indestructible sword sect roared with confidence.</p><p>On the other side, the boundless sacred land’s geniuses roared as well. Their target was also at least three array plates.</p><p>There were a total of twelve array plates. The three Overlord forces were all confident that they would get three array plates each. This made the top ten sects ‘faces solemn and they didn’t speak.</p><p>Their appetites naturally weren’t that big. Their goal was an array plate. As long as they could get an array plate, they would be satisfied.</p><p>“Alright, you guys can set off!”</p><p>The college chief of the unique devil Academy waved his hand.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The geniuses from the unique devil Academy replied and flew toward the Galaxy in front of them.</p><p>There were a total of 18 planets in the Galaxy in front of him, revolving around the star.</p><p>There might be array plates on all 18 planets, so they could only rely on luck and randomly choose a star to fly up.</p><p>However, in the beginning, they could only choose to fly to the outermost planet and start their search from the outer planets.</p><p>The geniuses of the unique demon Academy chose a Black Planet and flew up.</p><p>Then, the indestructible sword sect and the boundless Holy Land each chose a planet and flew up.</p><p>In this way, the three Overlord forces each occupied one of the outer planets.</p><p>“You guys should also set off!”</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain instructed Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Let’s go to that planet first!”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang pointed at one of the blue planets. This planet was not the planet that the three Overlord forces had entered. The others had no objections and all started flying toward it.</p><p>The eyes of the people from the other sects flickered, and they also chose to fly down to the planet realm.</p><p>Some sects chose to fly to the same planet.</p><p>After all, the surface area of a planet was extremely large. Even if they landed on the same planet, they might not necessarily touch it.</p><p>Lu Ming, Ouyang Qingxiang, and the rest flew into the Galaxy. There was nothing unusual.</p><p>Originally, the divine King experts would be blocked by the Galaxy array at this distance. However, Lu Ming and the rest were not affected.</p><p>“It is indeed effective …”</p><p>The eyes of many God kings brightened.</p><p>Seeing that there was nothing unusual, Lu Ming and the rest increased their speed and flew toward the Blue Planet like streaks of rainbow light. As they approached, the planet grew larger and larger in front of them. At the same time, they felt a strong gravitational force acting on them.</p><p>“What a strong gravitational force …”</p><p>Everyone’s expression changed slightly.</p><p>They could feel that the gravity of this planet was shockingly strong.</p><p>Moreover, the closer they got to the planet, the more terrifying the gravity became. In the end, when they appeared tens of thousands of meters above the star system, the gravity was already shockingly strong. They had to constantly circulate their divine power to maintain flight in order to resist the gravity.</p><p>“Get down!”</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang took the lead and flew down. The others followed her and landed on the ground.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>In the end, they landed heavily on the ground, creating huge pits.</p><p>“What a hard ground …”</p><p>Everyone’s heart jolted and they were very surprised.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
