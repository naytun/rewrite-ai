For a moment, neither of them made a move.</p><p>They knew that if the two of them were to fight, it would not be decided in a short time. Moreover, if both of them were injured, the black-robed youth and the others would take advantage of it.</p><p>Gah gah …</p><p>At this moment, a few large birds were chirping as they pounced towards four eye void court and Zhuo Buzhu.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Four eyes void court and Zhuo Wu fa attacked at the same time. In an instant, a few large birds were killed by the two of them. They then turned into rolling energy that surged into their bodies and were absorbed.</p><p>“Cool, this is too cool!”</p><p>Four-eyed Kong ting’s face was filled with an intoxicated expression.</p><p>Zhuo Buzhu was almost the same.</p><p>If they absorbed the giant bird, their cultivation would improve rapidly. Absorbing one giant bird would be equivalent to a thousand years of their bitter cultivation. What could be more satisfying than that?</p><p>four eyes, let’s compete fairly for the star core fragment. Whoever gets it will get it. How about it? ”</p><p>Zhuo Wu fa stared at the four-eyed empty court.</p><p>“Alright, let’s do that. But before that, we still need to get rid of some miscellaneous people!”</p><p>After saying that, four-eyed void court swept his cold gaze toward the black-robed youth and the others.</p><p>“That’s right, get lost, or else, die!”</p><p>Zhuo Wu fa said even more coldly.</p><p>The black-robed youth’s group of five had extremely unsightly expressions, but they didn’t dare to refute.</p><p>In this world, strength was the most important. If one talked too much without strength, only death would await them.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The black-robed youth shouted angrily and turned to leave.</p><p>Although the other four heaven’s favorites from the multi-story sect were unwilling, they had no choice but to follow the black-robed youth and leave.</p><p>“There are still two ants. Aren’t you going to get lost?”</p><p>After the black-robed young man and his group of five left, he looked in the direction of Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang with his cold eyes and said coldly, ”</p><p>“It seems that we’ve been discovered!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and walked out with Ouyang Xiangxiang.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s you guys …”</p><p>When he saw that it was Lu Ming and Ouyang Xiangxiang, four-eyed void court bellowed in anger. His four eyes flickered with cold killing intent.</p><p>Lu Ming, it’s you. Hahaha. Good, very good. You killed a Holy Son of my indestructible sword sect in the world of ancient gods. Now, leave your life behind.</p><p>A terrifying sword intent rushed out of Zhuo Wudi’s body. As soon as he finished speaking, a snow-white sword light flew towards Lu Ming with terrifying power.</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate. He immediately used the ancient God tactic and turned into a green-armored ancient God. He thrust his spear and broke Zhuo Buzhu’s sword radiance.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted, his fighting spirit soaring. With his combat power being quadrupled, Lu Ming’s body was filled with energy. He held the spear and charged towards Zhuo Buzhu.</p><p>Zhuo Buzhu’s pupils contracted. It was obvious that Lu Ming’s abilities had far exceeded his expectations.</p><p>“Undying sword principle!”</p><p>Zhuo Wudi shouted and used a terrifying divine skill to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In an instant, the two of them exchanged more than a dozen moves. The others could only see the sky full of spear and sword rays. In the beginning, the spear and sword rays clashed with each other, and it was difficult to tell who was stronger.</p><p>However, after a few breaths, the spear radiance began to suppress the sword radiance. The sword radiance trembled non-stop and finally exploded with a loud boom. A figure was seen retreating continuously.</p><p>The one who retreated was naturally Zhuo Wudi.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>Zhuo Wu’s eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>He had never expected Lu Ming to be so powerful that he could not even defeat him.</p><p>Four-eyed void had exchanged blows with Lu Ming before and was not too surprised.</p><p>“Zhuo Buzhu, this Lu Ming is really abnormal. I’m afraid you can’t take him down by yourself. How about we join forces and kill him together?”</p><p>Four-eyed Kong ting said to Zhuo bu Dong.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Zhuo Wudi directly nodded his head and released a terrifying sword essence.</p><p>Four eyes void court and Zhuo Buzhu formed a horn and charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“You two want to join forces to kill me? good, very good. However, do you think you can kill me so easily? If I go all out, I can take one of you down with me. Even if I can’t kill you, I can at least heavily injure you!”</p><p>“If one of you is seriously injured, would the other let him go?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>The moment he said this, four eyes void court and Zhuo Buzhu’s figures stopped. They looked at each other and saw the wariness in each other’s eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming was right. Even if the two of them joined forces to deal with Lu Ming, given Lu Ming’s abilities, it was not impossible for him to take one of them down with him if he retaliated before he died.</p><p>Even if he couldn’t kill them, he would definitely be able to severely injure them.</p><p>If one of them was seriously injured, would the other let the other go? It was impossible!</p><p>Who wouldn’t want to keep the star core fragment for themselves?</p><p>For a moment, neither of them made a move.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t you dare try to sow discord!”</p><p>Four-eyed Kong ting said in a deep voice.</p><p>“Hehe, trying to sow discord? I’m just telling the truth. If you want to fight, I’ll keep you company!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>Four eyes void court and Zhuo Buzhu still didn’t attack.</p><p>They naturally knew that Lu Ming was telling the truth.</p><p>For a time, the three sides were in a stalemate.</p><p>“The star core fragment will belong to anyone who sees it. Let’s have a fair competition. Whoever can get it will get it. By the time the others arrive, we won’t have a share, especially your divine sons …”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Four eye Kong ting and Zhuo Wu FA’s eyes flashed, they were clearly moved.</p><p>In the unique demon Academy or the immortal sword sect, the divine sons and Holy Sons were also competitors, just like the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>Four eyes void, he had always been suppressed by mo jiuye. It would be a lie to say that he did not want to replace mo jiuye and defeat him.</p><p>If mo jiuye found this place, the star core fragment would definitely belong to mo jiuye.</p><p>Compared to killing Lu Ming, it was more important for him to obtain the opportunity.</p><p>alright, let’s have a fair competition. Whoever has the strength and the opportunity will get the star core fragment!</p><p>The four-eyed empty court finally gave in. After saying those words, it turned around and rushed forward with the people from the unique demon Academy.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>How could Zhuo Buzhu fall behind? he also led the few geniuses of the indestructible sword sect and charged forward.</p><p>“Let’s go too!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded at Ouyang Qingxiang. In a flash, the two of them also moved forward.</p><p>They didn’t walk far in this direction before large birds pounced out to kill them.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his long spear and pressed down. A Big Bird was killed by him.</p><p>At once, the huge bird dispersed and turned into rolling energy that rushed into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let me do it first. I’ll transfer it to you after I devour it!”</p><p>He said the ” measure ” word art. Then, a powerful suction force erupted and devoured all the energy that the big Bird had transformed into. The next moment, an extremely pure energy surged out from the ” measure ” word art and gushed into Lu Ming’s limbs and bones.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the universe thousand Dao mantra to absorb this energy and convert it into divine power.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
