He could tell that the cultivation of the descendants of the ancient gods focused on the divine body and divine power as secondary.</p><p>All of them had astonishing strength.</p><p>The ancient God’s heart could continuously improve the divine body. It was normal for him to be a peerless genius among the descendants of the ancient gods.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I don’t think you’ve cultivated the ancient God tactic and have yet to awaken your ancient God Body, right?”</p><p>The old man, Guyuan, sized Lu Ming up and continued.</p><p>“Ancient God tactic? Ancient God Body?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He was rather curious. He pondered for a moment and shook his head.”No, I didn’t!”</p><p>it’s normal that you haven’t awakened the ancient God Body. After all, to awaken the ancient God Body, you have to enter the blood pool and absorb the energy of the blood pool. You’re the descendant of an ascetic. Where did you get the blood pool? ”</p><p>Gu Hongshan laughed.</p><p>” that’s right. Once the ancient God Body awakens after the ancient God heart is formed, it’ll be terrifying. At the very least, it’ll be an orange-armored ancient God Body. It’s not impossible for him to even awaken the yellow-armored ancient God Body.”</p><p>“I’m really looking forward to it!”</p><p>The others also discussed animatedly, revealing envious expressions.</p><p>“Yellow-armored ancient God Body? An orange-armored ancient God Body?”</p><p>Lu Ming had more doubts in his heart.</p><p>“Lu Ming, come back to the eighth tribe with us. The tribe is preparing to send a group of people into the blood pool soon. You can go with them and awaken your ancient God Body. That way, your strength will increase again.”</p><p>Gu Hongshan said.</p><p>“Ancient God Body? Was it the gigantic body that they had transformed into? The increase in power is truly astonishing.”</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming’s heart was burning.</p><p>He had also seen that when Gu Hongshan and the others turned into that ‘giant’ form, their combat strength was indeed very powerful.</p><p>Be it his strength or defense, they had improved a lot. If Lu Ming could cultivate this secret skill, his combat strength would also increase sharply.</p><p>kid, agree to their request. Quickly agree to their request. This is a great opportunity for you.</p><p>Bone shouted in his sea of consciousness.</p><p>“En, good. In any case, I’ve been wandering outside for many years. I was just looking for a tribe to rest for a while.”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Gu Hongshan and the rest were overjoyed. Lu Ming was so talented. If he could join their eighth tribe, it would mean that the eighth tribe would have another unparalleled genius. They were naturally overjoyed.</p><p>“Alright, let’s return to the tribe first.”</p><p>Gu Hongshan said.</p><p>“Big brother Hong Shan, please hold on. I have a matter that I would like to ask for your help with.”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly said.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>Gu Hongshan asked.</p><p>I was chased by a group of outsiders and almost died at their hands. I have to take revenge.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a cold glint.</p><p>He wanted to make use of the descendants of the ancient gods to get rid of the experts from the unique devil Academy who were chasing after him.</p><p>Lu Ming was not the kind of person who would not take revenge. Since there was a grudge, he would immediately take revenge as long as he had the chance.</p><p>“An outsider? Where is he?”</p><p>Gu Hongshan, Gu Yuan and the others also revealed a cold light in their eyes.</p><p>“It’s in a Valley a few hundred thousand miles away. But I’m afraid we’re not enough.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had sensed that there should be many experts from the unique demon Academy gathered in the valley. Those who had chased after him previously were only a small portion.</p><p>that’s easy. We’ll contact some of our clansmen and wipe them out.</p><p>Gu Hongshan said.</p><p>Then, they took out a strange stone. It was similar to the voice transmission Jade talismans outside, but it looked much older.</p><p>They spread the news and then waited quietly.</p><p>Not long after, many figures flashed over. They were all from the eighth tribe of the ancient God descendants.</p><p>It didn’t take long for a group of ancient God descendants to gather here. There were more than thirty of them.</p><p>Gu Hongshan introduced Lu Ming and everyone was shocked.</p><p>“Everyone, follow me.”</p><p>Lu Ming said. Then, he brought Gu Hongshan and the rest to the valley where the unique devil Academy had gathered.</p><p>That Valley was very well hidden. If one did not search carefully, it would not be easy to find it. Previously, Lu Ming had come here by accident.</p><p>They stopped not far from the valley.</p><p>At the entrance of the valley, there was indeed a figure that flashed by.</p><p>It was obvious that the people from the unique devil Academy were still here. Furthermore, they had sent people to be on guard.</p><p>“Let’s just kill our way over.”</p><p>Gu Hongshan said maliciously.</p><p>“You can’t!”</p><p>Lu Ming stopped him. we don’t know how many people they have. It’ll be dangerous for us to attack them directly. Moreover, they have people on guard. If we attack them directly and they escape immediately, I’m afraid we can’t catch them all in one fell swoop.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, do you have any good ideas?”</p><p>Gu Hongshan said.</p><p>I’ll go lure them here. They tried to kill me before but failed. Now that they see me, they’ll definitely chase after me. You guys can lay in ambush around here and wait for them to catch up. Then, you can attack and kill them in one fell swoop. When they’re weakened, you can kill your way to the valley and capture them all in one fell swoop.</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Good idea, it’s really a good idea,”</p><p>“Not bad, let’s do that.”</p><p>The other descendants of the ancient gods nodded.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, you have to be careful when you do this,”</p><p>Gu Hongshan reminded.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I have a gun.”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Lu Ming was confident that he could draw the other party away.</p><p>Gu Hongshan and the rest immediately set up an ambush in the surroundings. After they were done, Lu Ming flew towards the valley in front.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>A loud roar was heard. As soon as Lu Ming approached, he was discovered.</p><p>“It’s Lu Ming. It’s this kid again!”</p><p>“Take him down. This time, don’t let the other party get away.”</p><p>Instantly, a series of explosive roars came from the valley.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and ran towards the place where Gu Hongshan and the rest were ambushing.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>More than a dozen figures rushed out of the valley.</p><p>They were all experts from the unique devil Academy, including the few people who had chased after Lu Ming previously.</p><p>“Let’s see where you can run to this time!”</p><p>An expert from the unique devil Academy said ferociously.</p><p>This time, they had sent more than ten experts. They were afraid that Lu Ming would run away due to the interference of the demons like the previous time.</p><p>This time, more than a dozen people were dispatched to see where Lu Ming could run to.</p><p>“Let’s be careful. This brat left and came back, so be careful of any tricks!”</p><p>that’s right. If he runs to some strange place, we’d better not chase him.</p><p>There were also people who were cautious in the unique devil Academy.</p><p>Lu Ming had been chased the last time and he had come back this time. They were afraid that Lu Ming would lead them to some dangerous places and kill them with the help of the power of the dangerous places.</p><p>However, they would never have expected that Lu Ming was not trying to kill them with the help of a land of peril. Instead, he was trying to borrow the strength of the descendants of the ancient gods.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming naturally would not run to some place with wonderful terrain.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>The two sides, one chasing and the other escaping, soon arrived at the place where the ancient God was hiding.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
