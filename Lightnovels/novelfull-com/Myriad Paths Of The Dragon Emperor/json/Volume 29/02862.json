They activated them with divine power, sending energy fluctuations far and wide.</p><p>The few of them just waited like that.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a few hours had passed.</p><p>Squeak …</p><p>A sharp voice came from the distance.</p><p>“They’re here!”</p><p>The eyes of Ouyang Qingxiang and the others lit up.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>In the distance, a few figures rushed over like lightning.</p><p>There were a total of five planet devourers, all of which were bronze-level.</p><p>Hard work paid off. This method was really useful, and five of them were attracted at once.</p><p>“Kang Chong, Liu Jie, the two of you will deal with one planet Devourer each. Leave the remaining three to Holy Son Lu Ming and me.”</p><p>After Ouyang Qingxiang assigned everyone their tasks, she flashed and rushed out. A green sword light bloomed in her hand as she attacked the two bronze planet devourers.</p><p>As for Kang Chong, Liu Jie, and Lu Ming, they each charged at one.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the process of rushing out, Lu Ming activated the fourfold combat power of the battle formula and thrust his spear forward.</p><p>A ray of spear radiance stabbed at a planet Devourer.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The planet Devourer waved its sharp claws and slashed at Lu Ming like a divine knife. It collided with the long spear and a violent tremor erupted. Lu Ming felt a sharp and terrifying force surging towards him and he could not help but take a few steps back.</p><p>The planet Devourer was also sent flying by Lu Ming.</p><p>“His strength is indeed shocking.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. Then, nine ice chains flew out and wrapped around the other party.</p><p>Lu Ming did not use his ancient God Body.</p><p>Although the ancient God Body was powerful, it also consumed a lot of physical strength. After using it once, he had to rest for at least two days before he could use it again.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming would not use his ancient God Body under normal circumstances.</p><p>After casting the ice chain, Lu Ming cast the divine Dragon materialization art. A nine-clawed Divine Dragon flew out and pounced at the bronze Devourer.</p><p>Apart from the ancient God Body, Lu Ming had used all his tricks. He was able to suppress the bronze planet Devourer.</p><p>The two of them engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not use his ancient God Body. His combat strength was not as strong as Ouyang Xiangxiang’s. It would not be easy to kill the bronze Devourer. After exchanging dozens of moves, Lu Ming seized an opportunity and used the moon slash. He broke the bronze Devourer’s stomach and severely injured it.</p><p>Then, the nine ice chains took the opportunity to bind the bronze planet Devourer tightly, causing its body to stiffen.</p><p>“Moon slaying!”</p><p>Lu Ming swept his long spear across. A crescent-shaped spear ray flashed and the bronze Devourer’s head was cut off.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, he kept the bronze Devourer’s head and looked in another direction.</p><p>At this moment, Ouyang Xiangxiang had already taken care of two bronze devourers, but Kang Chong and Liu Jie were each fighting a bronze planet Devourer.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang and Lu Ming each rushed to one person to help the other kill the bronze planet Devourer.</p><p>Very quickly, the remaining two were also killed by them.</p><p>In total, they had killed six bronze-grade planet devourers and gained six points.</p><p>This amount of points was naturally too little. However, this method of attracting people was useful. They continued to attract more.</p><p>Unfortunately, for the rest of the day, not a single planet Devourer came.</p><p>it seems that all the planet devourers nearby have come. Let’s change locations.</p><p>Lu Ming suggested.</p><p>They nodded and put away the divine crystals and gemstones. Then, they chose a random direction and flew away.</p><p>After flying for more than ten million miles, they estimated that they were close enough. They stopped, put down the divine crystals and gemstones, and continued to attract the planet Devourer in this way.</p><p>“They’re here! So many!”</p><p>Kang Chong suddenly exclaimed.</p><p>This time, in less than an hour, squeaking sounds could be heard from the distance, coming from different caves.</p><p>Then, from some of the caves, many planet devourers rushed out.</p><p>Ten!</p><p>This time, there were ten of them, all of them bronze-grade planet devourers.</p><p>Their expressions were grave.</p><p>“Kang Chong, Liu Jie, the two of you join forces and pay attention to your own safety.”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang instructed Kang Chong and Liu Jie.</p><p>Facing so many bronze-grade planet devourers, with Kang Chong and Liu Jie’s strength, they were in danger.</p><p>“Holy maiden, don’t worry. Don’t worry about us.”</p><p>Liu Jie said.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming was very straightforward. He held the spear and charged at the bronze Devourer. As he charged, Lu Ming’s body expanded rapidly, turning into a green-armored ancient God that was a hundred meters tall.</p><p>With so many planet devourers coming at once, Lu Ming could not care less about holding back his strength. Otherwise, it would be difficult for Ouyang Qingxiang to fight against so many bronze-grade planet devourers alone.</p><p>After transforming into an ancient God, Lu Ming’s strength skyrocketed. His long spear swept out like a mountain range.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>One of the planet devourers was sent flying by Lu Ming’s sweep. It crashed into a mountain and the mountain shattered. The planet Devourer was already half-dead.</p><p>Lu Ming’s strength was stronger than Ouyang Qingxiang’s after he used the ancient God Body. He could completely crush the bronze-grade planet Devourer.</p><p>Squeak …</p><p>There was a shrill sound. Five planet devourers pounced on Lu Ming from five directions at an alarming speed.</p><p>“Break the air, break the air …”</p><p>Lu Ming cast the three apocalyptic strikes in a row. Five spearlights burst out and stabbed the five planet devourers.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Although the power of the five consecutive strikes had weakened, it still suppressed the five planet devourers and sent them flying.</p><p>“Three apocalyptic strikes, moon-cutting!”</p><p>Lu Ming rushed to one of them. He swept his spear and killed the planet Devourer. Then, he attacked the other one.</p><p>At the same time as Lu Ming made his move, Ouyang Qingxiang also made her move.</p><p>She performed the green Lotus Sword Song, and green Lotus flowers appeared one after another. The sky was filled with sword Qi, and the four planet devourers were shrouded in it.</p><p>At the same time, Kang Chong and Liu Jie also went up to help Ouyang Xiangxiang. In an instant, a bronze-grade planet Devourer was killed by Ouyang Xiangxiang.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming alone killed the other planet devourers and completely crushed them. With every move, one planet Devourer was killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>In a short while, the five planet devourers were all killed by Lu Ming. Including the first one, Lu Ming had killed six of them.</p><p>At this moment, Ouyang Qingxiang and the others were about to end their battle.</p><p>Out of the four planet devourers, three had been killed. Only one was left.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang slashed with her sword, and the last planet Devourer was beheaded.</p><p>However, at this moment, Lu Ming’s pupils constricted and he roared, ” “Be careful!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
