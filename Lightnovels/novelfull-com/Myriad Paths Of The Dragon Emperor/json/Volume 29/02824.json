My unique devil Academy was the first to discover this place.”</p><p>An expert from the unique devil Academy roared furiously.</p><p>“So what if you found it first? If you want the treasure, let’s see if you have the strength to do so.”</p><p>An expert from the eternal sword sect sneered.</p><p>“Then I’ll kill you.”</p><p>The experts from the Yimo Academy immediately charged towards the experts from the immortal sword sect.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Before the people of the four forces reached the big tree, they had already started a chaotic battle. They killed each other and in an instant, someone was killed.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The battle was extremely brutal, and everyone’s eyes were red as they fought with all their might.</p><p>At this moment, the purple-robed young man, Lu Ming, and the others who were slightly behind just now had also arrived.</p><p>Their figures flashed past, not participating in the battle, but rushing to the top of the tree.</p><p>Just as they neared the big tree, there was another change.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The leaves of the tree began to shake, and the clanging of swords could be heard.</p><p>Then, some of the leaves fell off. Like pitch-black iron swords, they attacked Lu Ming and the group.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>An expert from the boundless Holy Land couldn’t Dodge in time and was cut in half by a leaf. Blood splattered everywhere as his corpse fell to the ground.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>Many people’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>There was also a leaf that charged at Lu Ming like an extremely sharp divine sword.</p><p>Lu Ming did not dare to be careless. He thrust his spear.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The long spear struck the leaf, producing a metallic clang. The leaf was sent flying by Lu Ming’s strike, but the long spear in Lu Ming’s hand continued to vibrate. Lu Ming could feel waves of terrifying sword Qi flowing along the long spear towards him and into his palm.</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm was in excruciating pain, as if it was about to be torn apart by the sword aura.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted. The divine power in his body surged and surged into his palm, forcing the sword Qi.</p><p>Whoosh … Whoosh …</p><p>The sword Qi was forced out of Lu Ming’s palm. It turned into streaks of sword Qi and flew into the sky before disappearing.</p><p>“What a terrifying sword Qi, what a terrifying leaf …“</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>If even Lu Ming was in such a state, it was even worse for those with insufficient cultivation.</p><p>“Ah!” “Ah!”</p><p>There were continuous screams.</p><p>Although some people managed to block the leaves, the sword Qi entered their bodies and burst out. Their bodies were torn apart, and even their souls couldn’t escape.</p><p>In an instant, dozens of people died.</p><p>“Those below the sky celestial level, retreat!”</p><p>The purple-robed youth roared.</p><p>Those below the sky celestial realm couldn’t block the sword Qi of these leaves. They would die if they rushed up.</p><p>Those who were below the sky celestial realm all retreated and didn’t dare to charge forward.</p><p>The purple-robed young man, the ice Soul clan’s third young master, the Saint of the indestructible sword sect, and the rest of the strongest group kept charging forward. Their combat strength was astonishing, and they sent the leaves flying.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>As everyone approached the fruit, the entire tree shook even more violently.</p><p>More and more leaves were shaking, making a dense sword cry. Then, more leaves fell, and the sword Qi soared to the sky, heading toward the purple-robed young man and the others.</p><p>The most shocking thing was that these leaves seemed to form a sword array with infinite power.</p><p>Saint children like the purple-robed young man and the ice Soul clan’s third young master were all blocked and could not rush forward.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>These people’s expressions were very ugly.</p><p>The treasure was right in front of him, but it was blocked by some leaves.</p><p>“This kind of tree is really unique …”</p><p>Lu Ming retreated a distance and did not rush forward. He looked at the leaves and was secretly amazed.</p><p>It was unheard of for a tree’s leaves to be as sharp as a divine sword, with sword Qi soaring into the sky and forming a sword formation.</p><p>Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s heart was beating faster.</p><p>Lu Ming had a feeling that he could avoid the attacks of the leaves. It was a wonderful feeling.</p><p>I’ll try to control the ancient God’s heart!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He then controlled the ancient God’s heart and made it beat faster. A wondrous aura enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>This was the aura of an ancient God.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming dashed towards the crown of the big tree again.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Immediately, a few leaves whizzed out and flew towards Lu Ming. The sword Qi whistled, causing Lu Ming’s body to tense up.</p><p>“Don’t tell me it’s useless!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed and he was about to block it.</p><p>However, at this moment, when the leaves were close to Lu Ming, they suddenly changed direction and flew past him.</p><p>“It’s really useful!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>Lu Ming increased his speed and dashed toward the fruit at the top of the tree. The leaves seemed to have eyes when they rushed toward Lu Ming and all of them went around him.</p><p>“This … What’s going on?”</p><p>The eyes of the purple-robed youth and the others almost popped out.</p><p>The leaves did not attack Lu Ming.</p><p>Without the obstruction of the sword-shaped leaf, Lu Ming was only a few kilometers away from the fruit. In an instant, Lu Ming had reached the fruit.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not dare to be careless. As he activated the ancient God’s heart, he also set up layers of defense on the surface of his body. Then, he reached out to pick the fruit.</p><p>To Lu Ming’s surprise, he plucked the fruit very easily. It was light as a feather and seemed to be weightless.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He kept the fruit in his storage ring. Then, in a flash, he retreated quickly and left the attack range of the leaves in an instant.</p><p>“Kid, hand over the treasure!”</p><p>The purple-robed young man’s eyes turned red. With a roar, he jumped off a few leaves and retreated, chasing after Lu Ming.</p><p>“You dare to snatch the treasure? you’re courting death!”</p><p>“Take him down!”</p><p>The Saints of the inextinguishable sword sect and the boundless Holy Land roared and chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, the other experts from the major forces also chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>“The agreement just now belongs to whoever gets it. You want to go back on your word?”</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s third young master shouted. He struck out with his palm at the same time. The icy power of his palm shot toward the boundless sacred land’s Saint, cutting off his path of retreat.</p><p>The other ice Soul Clan experts also moved to stop the boundless sacred land.</p><p>However, no one from the unique demon Academy or the immortal sword sect stopped them.</p><p>Under the lead of the purple-robed young man and the Holy Son of the indestructible sword sect, they quickly chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had already rushed up to the stone pillars. He leaped from the stone pillars and escaped outside.</p><p>“Lu Ming, hand over the treasure. Otherwise, I’ll kill you even if you have to run to the ends of the earth!”</p><p>The purple-robed young man’s voice was filled with killing intent. He sped up and rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The people from the indestructible sword sect and the unique devil Academy also rushed into the stone pillar.</p><p>The most powerful group of people from the two forces were far more powerful than Lu Ming. They were approaching Lu Ming at an alarming speed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
