Some of them looked puzzled while others sneered.</p><p>alright, since you’ve agreed to it, let’s do it this way. Ouyang Qingxiang, sacred son of reflection, do you have any objections? ”</p><p>The Supreme martial artist said.</p><p>“I have no objections!”</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang’s eyes flickered. In the end, she nodded in agreement and chose to believe Lu Ming.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming’s strength had improved greatly this time. He might be able to fight against the Supreme Holy Son.</p><p>“I don’t have any objections either.”</p><p>The sacred son of reflection also nodded.</p><p>In the first round, his points were last. Whether it was compared to the Supreme Holy Son or Lu Ming and the others, the difference was too great. This change would be beneficial to him.</p><p>If he were to fight with his own strength, he might be able to fight with the Supreme Holy Son if he gathered the strength of the other three Holy Sons and holy virgins. How could he not agree?</p><p>“Brother Yue, you see, they themselves have already agreed, are you still going to object?”</p><p>The Supreme martial artist’s gaze shifted to Ouyang Qingxiang’s grandfather.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang’s grandfather was against it, but since Ouyang Qingxiang and the others had agreed, he couldn’t say anything more. He could only keep quiet with a gloomy face.</p><p>“Alright, then it’s decided. You guys can go up the stage and fight.”</p><p>The Supreme martial artist announced.</p><p>During this entire process, Dragon Boat Mountain didn’t say anything, as if they didn’t want to interfere.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>In a flash, the Supreme Holy Son, the transient light Holy Son, Lu Ming, and the others all rushed up to the fighting ring.</p><p>Four people from each side stood in three different directions of the fighting ring, forming a triangular formation.</p><p>“The competition, begin!”</p><p>The Supreme martial artist announced.</p><p>However, none of the three parties moved.</p><p>All three parties wanted to wait for the other two parties to make the first move so that they could reap the benefits.</p><p>No one would make the first move to help others.</p><p>For a moment, the three parties were sizing each other up and confronting each other.</p><p>Everyone around the fighting ring held their breath.</p><p>They understood that none of the three parties would easily make a move. However, once they did, they would use a thunderous strike and erupt into an astonishing battle.</p><p>Everyone was looking forward to it.</p><p>The Supreme Saint had a calm smile on his face as his gaze swept across Lu Ming, Ouyang Qingxiang, the transient light Saint son, and the others.</p><p>Among these people, the only one that he was slightly afraid of was Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming always gave her an unfathomable feeling. He was the only person he valued.</p><p>As for the others, he didn’t even put them in his eyes.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Ouyang Qingxiang, why don’t we join forces and blast the floating light down first? then, we’ll decide who’s the winner. What do you think?”</p><p>Suddenly, the Supreme Holy Son sent a message to Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang.</p><p>“Let’s join forces first?”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang’s eyes flashed as she considered the possibility of this suggestion.</p><p>If they worked together with the Supreme Saint son to eliminate the transient light Saint son’s side, they would have to face the Supreme saint’s challenge alone. It would be impossible to find anyone to work with.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang was initially thinking of teaming up with the sacred son of reflection to deal with the Supreme-being together. Then, they would have a showdown.</p><p>However, she was afraid that the sacred son of reflection would team up with the Supreme sacred son to deal with them first. Thus, she hesitated.</p><p>“Alright, I promise you.”</p><p>Lu Ming responded directly.</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang’s gaze flickered but she did not object. She could only choose to believe Lu Ming now.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The Supreme Saint son’s eyes flickered as he looked at the transient light Saint son. He suddenly stepped forward, and a powerful aura burst out from his body.</p><p>At the same time, the three people behind the Supreme Saint son also released powerful auras, pressing down on the transient light Saint son.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming, Ouyang Qingxiang, and the other two also released powerful auras that surged toward the sacred son of reflection and the others.</p><p>The expressions of the sacred son of reflection and the others changed.</p><p>“The universe God, Lu Ming, you’re despicable. You actually want both sides to join forces against us.”</p><p>The sacred son of reflection roared.</p><p>floating light, you have four Holy Sons and holy virgins. We have four Holy Sons and holy virgins in total. It’s a good time to fight and decide who’s stronger. That’s the fairest way.</p><p>The Supreme Holy Son sneered.</p><p>He was right. There were two Saint-level characters on his side. In addition to Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang, they had four Saint-level characters, the same as the transient light Saint and the others.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>The sacred son of reflection’s expression was ugly.</p><p>“Enough nonsense, let’s fight!”</p><p>die! the Supreme Saint son shouted. His body emitted violent divine power. The violent aura formed a storm that pressed down on the transient light Saint son.</p><p>“Paragon divine fist!”</p><p>The Supreme Saint son roared, and his fists glowed with a golden light. He punched out continuously, and brilliant fist prints bombarded the transient light Saint son.</p><p>“Yan Kong, you and I will hold off Supreme universe and the others. I’ll leave Xue Tan, Zhi Xia, Lu Ming, and Ouyang Qingxiang to you.”</p><p>The sacred son of reflection roared.</p><p>At this time, he had no choice but to fight.</p><p>The floating light Saint son’s figure moved and pounced towards the Supreme Saint son. His fifth-level celestial deity strength completely erupted.</p><p>“The divine light from beyond the heavens!”</p><p>The sacred son of reflection howled, and his body was covered in blinding light that was brighter than the sun.</p><p>The dazzling light turned into a terrifying palm print and blasted toward the Supreme Holy Son.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two attacks collided, creating thousands of waves. The sky was filled with dazzling light, silver-white and golden.</p><p>However, the golden light clearly had the upper hand.</p><p>In the end, the silver-white light shook and exploded. The sacred son was forced back.</p><p>He was completely suppressed by the Supreme Holy Son in a direct confrontation.</p><p>At the same time, the Yan Kong Saint son and the Supreme Saint son’s number one subordinate were locked in a fierce battle. That person’s strength was no weaker than the Yan Kong Saint son’s.</p><p>As for the other two, they were weaker than the Saints, so they didn’t make a move. Instead, they stood on the side as a lookout.</p><p>On the other side, Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang were fighting against Holy Son Zhi Xia and Holy maiden Xue Tan.</p><p>“Song of the green Lotus sword!”</p><p>die! Ouyang Qingxiang shouted and slashed out a green sword light toward Holy maiden Xue Tan.</p><p>Saintess Xue Tan also used all her strength to resist.</p><p>However, after one move, Xue Tan’s body trembled and she retreated. She was no match for him.</p><p>Originally, Ouyang Xiangxiang and Holy maiden Xue Tan’s strength were on par. However, now that Ouyang Xiangxiang had broken through to the fifth level heavenly God Realm, her strength was completely above Holy maiden Xue Tan’s.</p><p>Having gained the upper hand in one move, Ouyang Qingxiang continued to perform the song of the green Lotus sword. Green Lotus flowers enveloped saintess Xue Tan, bursting out with thousands of sword Qi.</p><p>Saintess Xue Tan tried to block, but it was useless. After a dozen moves, she was pushed to the edge of the fighting ring with a few sword wounds on her body.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>An ancient God’s roar was heard. It was from the ancient God Body that Lu Ming had transformed into.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not use his full strength. He did not turn into a green-armored ancient God, but a green-armored ancient God.</p><p>After cultivating the ancient God tactic, he could control what level of ancient God he wanted to become.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
