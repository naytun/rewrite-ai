I’ll show you my real trump card, the divine Dragon phenomenon. Come out!</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son roared, and his divine power surged. Half of the sky was dyed golden.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Then, a Dragon’s Roar shook the nine Heavens. A huge true dragon appeared above the Tian Hong Saint son.</p><p>No, it shouldn’t be called a true dragon. In the primeval universe, all true dragons who had reached the martial God Realm were called divine Dragons.</p><p>Seeing this Divine Dragon, Lu Ming was in a daze. He thought that he had returned to the era when the divine wilderness continent was fighting for supremacy. This was because this move was very similar to the move of fusing the body with the blood when one was below the martial Royal realm.</p><p>However, this was clearly not a bloodline technique, but a secret technique.</p><p>He had used a secret technique to form a Divine Dragon with a terrifying aura.</p><p>What surprised Lu Ming the most was that this Divine Dragon did not have five claws but six.</p><p>“Six-clawed, what happened? Could it be a mutated Divine Dragon?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing.</p><p>Back then, when Lu Ming had just gone to the yuan continent, he had met Qiu Ying Ying. Her bloodline was a six-clawed true dragon.</p><p>In the heaven realm and the primordial realm, Dragons had six claws. Those with seven claws and above were considered mutants of the true dragons, such as the nine Dragons.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming naturally thought that the divine Dragon that the Tian Hong Saint son had condensed was also a variant.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The six-clawed golden divine Dragon roared as it pounced toward Ouyang Qingxiang with its tens of thousands of meters long body.</p><p>“Song of the green Lotus sword, sword out to kill the spirit!”</p><p>Facing the secret technique of the Tian Hong Saint son, Ouyang Qingxiang’s expression was extremely grave. She also used her ultimate technique.</p><p>Countless green sword lights burst out of her body and gathered into a Green Lotus flower. It spun and flew toward the six-clawed golden divine Dragon.</p><p>The six-clawed golden divine Dragon bellowed and struck out with its claws. The green Lotus exploded with a deafening boom. The sky was boiling and the terrifying energy surged in all directions like a tsunami.</p><p>This was the most powerful collision between the Holy Sons and holy virgins. The scene was shocking.</p><p>However, at this moment, Lu Ming’s body felt like it was boiling. The blood in his body seemed to be boiling, and there were even Dragon roars coming from his blood.</p><p>“This is … The voice of the nine Dragons!”</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming had once refined nine drops of blood essence from the nine Dragons. As Lu Ming’s cultivation level continued to improve, these nine drops of blood essence fused with Lu Ming’s blood and had been hidden in his body.</p><p>The Tianhong Saint son’s Secret skill had actually triggered the nine dragon blood essence.</p><p>this secret skill is so powerful. If I can get it, I’ll definitely be able to cultivate it to an extremely high level.</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was filled with thoughts and his eyes were burning with passion.</p><p>He had a feeling that the Tian Hong Saint son’s Secret technique was very suitable for him. It was a desire that came from the nine dragon blood essence.</p><p>The battle between the Tian Hong Saint son and Ouyang Qingxiang became even more intense. However, Ouyang Qingxiang was already at a disadvantage.</p><p>The Tianhong Saint son’s Secret technique, the divine Dragon materialization art, was shockingly powerful. It had already begun to suppress Ouyang Qingxiang.</p><p>Of course, it wasn’t that Ouyang Qingxiang’s Green Lotus Sword Song wasn’t powerful. It was terrifyingly powerful, but her cultivation was slightly weaker than the Tianhong Saint son’s.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son’s cultivation base was at the peak of the fourth level heavenly God Realm, while Ouyang Qingxiang was at the early stage.</p><p>At the start of the battle, it was not obvious, but as the battle went on, this gap would naturally slowly show.</p><p>If this continued, it would be disadvantageous for Ouyang Xiangxiang.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang, I’ve said it before. Don’t even think about stopping me!</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son roared and used the divine Dragon materialization art with all his might. The six-clawed golden divine Dragon’s power became more and more terrifying.</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang did not say a word and resisted with all her might.</p><p>It would not be easy for the Tian Hong Saint son to win in a short time.</p><p>Below, Lu Ming’s eyes darted around, and he suddenly revealed a look of determination.</p><p>“Tianhong, aren’t you just trying to attack me? I’ll give you a chance.”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted loudly, his voice reverberating throughout the entire area.</p><p>Hmm?</p><p>Many people, including the Tian Hong Saint son and Ouyang Qingxiang, looked at Lu Ming curiously.</p><p>“I’ll make a bet with you, how about it?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“What bet?”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son said.</p><p>“If you attack me, I’ll take one of your moves, but only one. After that, you’ll have to leave,”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The moment he said that, there was an uproar.</p><p>“What? Lu Ming is going to take one of the Tian Hong Saint son’s moves?”</p><p>“Crazy, he’s crazy, he’s looking for death!”</p><p>that’s right. The Tian Hong Saint son’s one move is so terrifying. With Lu Ming’s cultivation, he’s dead for sure.</p><p>he saw that the Tian Hong Saint son wouldn’t back down today and wanted to take a gamble!</p><p>Everyone looked at Lu Ming in disbelief.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you can’t!”</p><p>Yue Linglong called out.</p><p>that’s right. Brother Lu, the Tian Hong Saint son’s cultivation is too strong. You can’t take the risk!</p><p>Wu Zifeng also said.</p><p>Lu Ming had received the Tian Hong Saint son’s attack. He was doomed.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son’s eyes flashed with cold killing intent. “What you said, is it true?”</p><p>of course it’s true. However, I have a condition. If I can take one of your moves and not die, you have to give me your Divine Dragon materialization technique!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>This was his plan. He wanted to obtain the Tian Hong Saint son’s Divine Dragon materialization art.</p><p>“You want my Divine Dragon materialization art? Delusional!”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son’s voice turned extremely cold.</p><p>“Why can’t I? I’m betting my life with you. If I can’t take one of your moves, I’ll be dead. Isn’t it worth it for me to use such a big price to bet a secret skill with you?”</p><p>also, are you not confident in yourself? do you think you can’t kill me in one move? ”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“I’m not confident? What a joke. Fine, I’ll bet with you.”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son shouted.</p><p>With his cultivation, he could kill Lu Ming with a casual move, let alone using his full strength. Why would he not dare to take the risk?</p><p>He could take the opportunity to finish off Lu Ming completely.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you don’t have to take the risk. I can stop him.”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>it’s fine. I’m confident. Don’t worry, Holy maiden Qingxiang.</p><p>Lu Ming replied.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang’s eyes flickered. Then, she quickly retreated and put some distance between her and the Tianhong Saint son. The two of them stopped fighting.</p><p>“Nest, Lu Ming, what do you want to do? do you want to die? Even if you want to die, don’t drag me along …”</p><p>At this moment, in Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness, the bone demon was in a rage.</p><p>“Senior bone demon, this Junior’s life is in your hands,”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>look at me? look at my ass. You’re looking for death. Go and bear it yourself.</p><p>The bone Devil roared.</p><p>“Senior bone demon, are you going to just watch as this junior is killed? if this junior is killed, I’m afraid that this junior will never be able to accomplish senior Jing Yu’s mission.”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>“You … You’re threatening me …”</p><p>The bone Devil roared.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
