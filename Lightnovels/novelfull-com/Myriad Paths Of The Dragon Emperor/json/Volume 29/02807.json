Since he had made his decision, he would not hesitate anymore. He did not have time to hesitate. If Ouyang Qingxiang could not hold the Tian Hong Saint son’s men outside, he would be in trouble when the experts returned.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming no longer hesitated. He dashed out and headed for the stairs.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son noticed Lu Ming the moment he rushed out.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s you!”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son roared, and his killing intent exploded.</p><p>However, he was on the stairs and could not kill Lu Ming even if he wanted to.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming landed heavily on the first step of the staircase, causing a heavy boom.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming felt a powerful force coming from the top of the stairs. It was as if it could topple mountains and overturn the seas. It pressed down on Lu Ming, trying to blast him off the stairs.</p><p>Hmph, you want to climb the Holy Dragon stairs without the divine dragon’s bloodline in your body? you’re daydreaming …</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son sneered and took a few steps down.</p><p>He was waiting for Lu Ming to be blasted out of the Holy Dragon steps, then he would go and kill Lu Ming.</p><p>This time, he wanted Lu Ming to die a miserable death.</p><p>However, in the next moment, his body froze.</p><p>This was because Lu Ming did not get blasted down the stairs as he had expected. Instead, he stood firmly on the stairs.</p><p>“You … You have the bloodline of a Divine Dragon?”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son asked gloomily.</p><p>in this world, your Dragonman race isn’t the only one with the bloodline of the divine Dragon.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>It turned out that only those who had the bloodline of the divine Dragon could climb the stairs.</p><p>If one did not have the bloodline of the divine Dragon, they would be blasted down the stairs by the power of the stairs.</p><p>Just now, when Lu Ming had just stepped onto the stairs, he had almost been blasted off. At the critical moment, the nine Dragons ‘blood essence in his blood boiled and he was able to stand on the stairs.</p><p>“Hmph, so what if you have the bloodline of the divine Dragon? Can you ascend it? You can’t go up there. When you’re exhausted, it’ll be the time of your death!”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son said coldly, then strode down the stairs. He was very relaxed when he returned.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son soon reached the first step and came to Lu Ming’s side. However, there was a force guarding the steps, so he could not do anything to Lu Ming.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son cast a murderous glance at Lu Ming and stepped out of the staircase. He landed outside the staircase and stood guard there. He was waiting for Lu Ming to exhaust his strength and fall down. Then, he could kill Lu Ming.</p><p>“You can just wait!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled contemptuously. He then turned around and strode up the stairs.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>With every step he took, the stairs would rumble. Lu Ming’s speed was very fast and he had taken hundreds of steps in no time.</p><p>He was even faster than the Tian Hong Saint son.</p><p>“This kid … How can he be so fast?”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son looked terrible.</p><p>the pressure behind is getting greater and greater, and the difficulty is also getting higher and higher. This kid definitely can’t go up, definitely can’t!</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son kept shouting in his heart.</p><p>He was a heaven’s favorite of the Dragonman race and the divine Dragon bloodline in his body was very thick. It was comparable to the six-clawed Divine Dragon among the divine Dragons. He did not believe that Lu Ming, a human, could have a thicker Divine Dragon bloodline than him.</p><p>However, the truth slapped him in the face.</p><p>Lu Ming’s speed did not slow down at all. Very soon, he had crossed half of the steps, followed by two-thirds.</p><p>This was already the limit of the Tian Hong Saint son’s journey, but Lu Ming had managed to reach this point in one go.</p><p>At this point, Lu Ming’s speed slowed down.</p><p>The pressure here was already very shocking.</p><p>The blood in Lu Ming’s body churned rapidly, as if it was about to burn.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar could be heard from the blood. A nine-headed Dragon shuttled through the blood in a lifelike manner.</p><p>A layer of blood mist covered the surface of Lu Ming’s body. Then, the blood mist gathered into a nine-Dragon in the air and roared into the sky.</p><p>“Nine … A nine-clawed Divine Dragon, it’s a nine-clawed Divine Dragon …”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son yelled in disbelief. He was so shocked that he almost jumped.</p><p>Never in his wildest dreams would he have thought that Lu Ming’s body contained the bloodline of the nine-clawed Divine Dragon, the highest level among the divine Dragons.</p><p>no wonder this boy can walk so fast. It turns out that he has the bloodline of a nine-clawed Divine Dragon in his body. If I can snatch the bloodline of a nine-clawed Divine Dragon from his body and use it for my own use, my talent will be improved by many times.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son’s eyes were filled with greed.</p><p>The manifestation of the nine Dragons lightened the pressure on Lu Ming and he sped up again.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming was only a hundred steps away from the end of the stairs.</p><p>However, the pressure on the last 100 steps was also the most terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled with every step he took.</p><p>“Divine Dragon materialization art!”</p><p>break! Lu Ming growled and activated the divine Dragon materialization art. An eight-clawed Divine Dragon formed above his head. The divine Dragon roared and pounced forward, helping Lu Ming break the pressure on the stairs.</p><p>Instantly, the pressure was reduced again. Lu Ming quickly went up.</p><p>“Divine Dragon materialization art, damn it!”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son gritted his teeth when he saw Lu Ming use the divine Dragon materialization art.</p><p>He was both shocked and jealous.</p><p>It had only been a short while, but Lu Ming had already cultivated the divine Dragon materialization technique and even cultivated an eight-clawed Divine Dragon.</p><p>He had been cultivating the divine Dragon materialization art for tens of thousands of years, but he had only managed to cultivate one six-clawed Divine Dragon.</p><p>This made him even more greedy for Lu Ming’s nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The rumbling sounds on the stairs continued. Lu Ming was getting closer and closer to the top of the stairs.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son’s face grew gloomier.</p><p>With the last boom, Lu Ming successfully stepped onto the platform above the stairs.</p><p>Above the stairs was a majestic palace. The palace’s door was open, and it was impossible to see what was inside.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. Without any hesitation, he strode forward and walked through the door.</p><p>After stepping through the door, the light suddenly brightened. Lu Ming could see the situation behind the door clearly.</p><p>Behind the door was a wide hall.</p><p>There was nothing else in the hall. It was empty. Lu Ming looked around but did not find anything.</p><p>However, the center of the hall attracted Lu Ming’s attention.</p><p>In the middle of the hall, there was a stone pillar that was more than a meter tall. Above the stone pillar, there was a scroll floating, emitting a gentle light.</p><p>What was amazing was that there was a small Divine Dragon made of energy flying around the scroll.</p><p>“Could it be the complete divine Dragon materialization art?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he stepped forward.</p><p>“Kid, there’s a defensive formation on this scroll!”</p><p>Bone warned.</p><p>“A defensive formation? Then how do we break it?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>it’s simple. You have the blood essence of a nine-clawed Divine Dragon in your body. You just need to drip a drop of your blood on the scroll, and you’ll naturally be able to break the formation on it.</p><p>Bone said.</p><p>“That’s simple!”</p><p>Lu Ming forced out a drop of blood and dripped it on the scroll.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
