You’ve killed two Holy Sons of the unique devil Academy and the immortal sword sect. I’m afraid that the people from these two forces will not let you off!”</p><p>Bing Qing said, a little worried for Lu Ming.</p><p>People at the Saint level were the top geniuses of any force, and there would not be many of them.</p><p>Every one of them had the chance to compete for the position of sect leader in the future. Their future achievements were limitless.</p><p>Any force would feel heartache when such a person was killed. The experts from the two major forces would probably go crazy and hunt Lu Ming down.</p><p>Even if Lu Ming were to train in the wilderness, the other party would most likely send a large number of experts to hunt him down.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He had not thought about this clearly.</p><p>It was not safe to return to the base of Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>The Kong Xuan sect was only one of the top ten sects in the Qin heaven Galaxy. Although it was the leader of the top sects, there was still a gap between its strength and the three Overlord forces.</p><p>At that time, the unique demon Academy and the indestructible sword sect would attack the base of the Kong Xuan sect, and the Kong Xuan sect might not be able to protect him.</p><p>brother Lu, why don’t you come with us to the ice Soul clan’s base first? the unique devil Academy and the immortal sword sect might be strong, but the ice Soul Clan is not afraid of them.</p><p>Bing Qing invited.</p><p>that’s right. You’re the ice Soul clan’s benefactor. The ice Soul Clan will protect you with all our might.</p><p>The third young master of the ice Soul Clan said.</p><p>Lu Ming had helped the ice Soul Clan retrieve the ice jade cold heart. This was a great help to the ice Soul Clan. The ice jade cold heart could help the ice Soul Clan produce more geniuses. It was the hope for the rise of the ice Soul Clan.</p><p>They were very grateful to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Then, thank you, everyone!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>He thought about it and decided that it was indeed the best time to go to the ice Soul clan’s base.</p><p>The group set off immediately and headed for the ice Soul clan’s base.</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s base was also built in a forbidden land. It was tall and majestic. A large number of ice Soul Clan members were active in the base, turning it into a big city.</p><p>As soon as they arrived at the ice Soul clan’s base, Bing Qing and the ice Soul clan’s third young master brought Lu Ming to meet the only Divine King expert of the ice Soul Clan there and told him what had happened.</p><p>brother Lu Ming, you can stay here. If the indestructible sword sect and the unique devil Academy want to touch you, they’ll have to go through the ice Soul Clan first.</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s Godking was very forceful and promised.</p><p>“Many thanks, Your Majesty!”</p><p>Lu Ming expressed his thanks.</p><p>……</p><p>At this moment, furious roars could be heard from the bases of the unique devil Academy and the immortal sword sect.</p><p>Lu Ming, how dare you kill the Holy Son of our unique demon Academy? How dare you! Men, come with me to the base of the Kong Xuan sect!</p><p>A roar came from the base of the Yimo Academy.</p><p>Then, a large number of experts charged towards the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>At the same time, a roar came from the base of the eternal sword sect. Then, a large number of powerful cultivators flew out from the base and headed for the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>Kong Xuan sect’s base was bustling with activity.</p><p>Since the exit had disappeared and they couldn’t get out, everyone could rest easy and stay in this world to cultivate.</p><p>Thump! Thump! Thump!</p><p>All of a sudden, the dull sound of war drums rang out in the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>“The war drums have sounded. What’s going on?”</p><p>could it be that a large number of demons are attacking the city? no way, we’ve never encountered such a thing before!</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>The battle drums were set up in the base of the Kong Xuan sect just in case. If something big happened, the drums would be sounded to get everyone to prepare for battle.</p><p>However, ever since the base was built, the war drums had never been sounded.</p><p>Why did they suddenly sound the war drums now?</p><p>There was no time to think. Everyone in the Kong Xuan sect’s base started to move and flew toward the city wall.</p><p>They flew up to the city wall and saw a large group of experts in the distance. They were flying over in a menacing manner, each and every one of them filled with killing intent.</p><p>“The unique devil Academy. It’s the people from the unique devil Academy!”</p><p>“Why are so many people from the Yimo Academy heading toward our Kong Xuan sect’s base?”</p><p>“I don’t know, but it looks like they’re here with bad intentions.”</p><p>“You guys, there’s still … That’s the inextinguishable sword sect!”</p><p>The people of Kong Xuan sect discussed animatedly. Suddenly, someone shouted.</p><p>The crowd was even more shocked and their faces turned grave. That was because, from another direction, another group of people was flying over with murderous intent. This group of people all carried long swords on their backs. They were from the indestructible sword sect.</p><p>In the Yimo Academy, the Army of the immortal sword sect stopped outside the base of the Kong Xuan sect. A cold aura and a terrifying pressure spread toward the base of the Kong Xuan sect, causing the expressions of many people to change drastically.</p><p>“May I know why you’ve gathered so many people to come to my Kong Xuan sect’s base?”</p><p>A deep voice came from the depths of the Kong Xuan sect’s base. Then, the figure of a middle-aged man appeared in the sky.</p><p>“Your Majesty!”</p><p>The people from the Kong Xuan sect felt at ease when they saw this figure.</p><p>This middle-aged man was the Godking that the arcane void sect had sent over.</p><p>Wuwei, we’re here today for a disciple of your Kong Xuan sect. His name is Lu Ming. Hand him over!</p><p>A cold voice came from the direction of the unique demon Academy. Then, a figure appeared in the sky above the people of the unique demon Academy, and his body was covered with vast divine light.</p><p>Godking. He was also a Godking, the Godking of the unique devil Academy!</p><p>“What? I’m here for Lu Ming!”</p><p>the unique devil Academy is here for Lu Ming. What did Lu Ming do to cause the people of the unique devil Academy to mobilize so many people? even the godkings have come.</p><p>When the people from Kong Xuan sect heard that, they started to make wild guesses. They were curious about what Lu Ming had done.</p><p>“What about you guys?”</p><p>Kong Xuan sect’s Divine King Wu Wei looked in the direction of the eternal sword sect.</p><p>“I’m here for Lu Ming too. Hand him over!”</p><p>A figure appeared in the sky above the inextinguishable sword sect. This was the Godking of the inextinguishable sword sect.</p><p>The godkings of the two major powers had appeared.</p><p>The disciples of Kong Xuan sect were even more shocked. The two major forces had come together for Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what’s the matter with you?”</p><p>In the base of Kong Xuan sect, Ouyang Qingxiang muttered.</p><p>At the same time, Yue Linglong, Wu Zifeng, an hai, and Liu Chang were also present, and they all looked worried.</p><p>This time, the godkings of the two major factions had come. They knew that something major had definitely happened.</p><p>Lu Ming is just a junior disciple of my Kong Xuan sect. What did he do to make the two of you come here? ”</p><p>Kong Xuan sect’s Divine King, Wu Wei, also asked curiously.</p><p>“There’s no harm in telling you. The Holy Son of our unique devil Academy died in Lu Ming’s hands in a secret battle!”</p><p>The Godking of the unique devil Academy said coldly.</p><p>the Saint of the inextinguishable sword sect, Jian Xing, was also killed by Lu Ming. Lu Ming must pay with his life!</p><p>The God King of the indestructible sword sect spoke with a sonorous voice.</p><p>As soon as he said that, the base of Kong Xuan sect was in an uproar.</p><p>Almost everyone from the Kong Xuan sect was dumbfounded.</p><p>The two Holy Sons of the indestructible sword sect and the unique demon Academy were killed by Lu Ming? Really?</p><p>That was a Saint-level figure. Could Lu Ming kill a Saint-level figure?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
