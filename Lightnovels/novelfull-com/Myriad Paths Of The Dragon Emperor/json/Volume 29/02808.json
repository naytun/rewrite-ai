Then, the scroll emitted a dazzling light that only disappeared after a long while.</p><p>At the bottom of the stairs, the Tian Hong Saint son was extremely anxious. He was even more anxious when he suddenly heard the Dragon’s Roar and the light above.</p><p>damn it. Did that kid already get the complete divine Dragon materialization technique? ”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son thought anxiously. He rushed up the stairs, but the pressure on the stairs stopped him. He could only step back unwillingly.</p><p>Hmph, I’ll wait here. Lu Ming, even if you get the complete divine Dragon materialization art, you’ll just be making a wedding dress for me. Haha, this is good too. It saves me trouble.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son laughed coldly. He felt better at the thought of this.</p><p>In the hall, after the light on the scroll disappeared, Lu Ming reached out and grabbed the scroll.</p><p>There was nothing unusual. Lu Ming opened the scroll in anticipation. There were many small words in the scroll, densely packed.</p><p>Lu Ming read it carefully. After a while, he put down the scroll.</p><p>the complete divine Dragon materialization art. It’s really the complete divine Dragon materialization art.</p><p>Lu Ming’s face was filled with ecstasy.</p><p>This scroll indeed recorded the complete divine Dragon materialization technique. It was extremely mysterious, much more so than the incomplete Divine Dragon materialization technique.</p><p>If it could be cultivated to major accomplishment, its power would definitely be shocking. It could become Lu Ming’s trump card and even surpass the ice chain.</p><p>“How do I get down?”</p><p>Lu Ming kept the scroll and started to think.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son must be guarding the bottom of the stairs. If he went down, the Tian Hong Saint son would definitely not let him go.</p><p>forget it, I’ll wait for a while. If it really doesn’t work, I’ll just cultivate here for a while. I wonder how Holy maiden Qingxiang is doing? ”</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea in his mind. He then started to wander around the palace.</p><p>There were other doors around the palace. Lu Ming walked around but found nothing. Then, he walked to the door at the end of the hall. Behind the door at the end of the hall, there was a long corridor that went straight ahead.</p><p>After passing through the corridor, a beam of light suddenly shot down from above.</p><p>Lu Ming looked up and realized that it was a door of light. The light was shining through the door of light.</p><p>“Could this be a teleportation gate?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>this is the teleportation gate. It should be an escape route that leads to the outside world.</p><p>The bone Devil’s voice sounded.</p><p>haha, the heavens are on my side. Tianhong, just wait!</p><p>Lu Ming laughed out loud. He then rose into the air and rushed towards the light door.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure disappeared into the door of light. The next moment, Lu Ming appeared in a Canyon.</p><p>it’s out, it’s really out. Let’s go find Holy maiden Qingxiang now.</p><p>Lu Ming turned into a beam of light and left the place.</p><p>This Canyon was not far from the entrance. Very soon, Lu Ming heard a violent roar coming from the front.</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang was currently engaged in an intense battle with a group of experts.</p><p>More than ten elders were all heavenly gods. Among them, there were even one or two fifth level heavenly gods and a few fourth level heavenly gods.</p><p>Facing so many experts, Ouyang Qingxiang mainly focused on defense and was not at a disadvantage at all.</p><p>Lu Ming flew over and shouted from a distance, ” “Holy maiden Qingxiang, let’s go!”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>When she saw Lu Ming suddenly appear from behind, Ouyang Qingxiang was clearly stunned and very surprised.</p><p>Lu Ming had clearly entered the cave from the entrance. Why did he suddenly run to the back?</p><p>However, she didn’t think too much about it and started to attack.</p><p>“Song of the green Lotus sword!”</p><p>die! Ouyang Qingxiang shouted as she waved her sword. Green lotuses appeared in the air, each of which emitted a terrifying sword Qi that forced the elders to retreat.</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang took the opportunity to break out of the tight encirclement and flew toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Are we going to chase them?”</p><p>An old man said.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang is too powerful. Even if we catch up with her, we can’t do anything to her. Our duty is to guard here and report this situation to the Saint.</p><p>Another old man said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The others nodded. They did not know that Lu Ming had sneaked in and even obtained the complete divine Dragon materialization technique that the Tian Hong Saint son had been dreaming of. If they had known, they would not have let Lu Ming and his companion leave so easily.</p><p>An elder rushed into the cave to report to the Tian Hong Saint son.</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang had already arrived beside Lu Ming.</p><p>“Let’s go back to the Kong Xuan sect!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang did not ask any further. She and Lu Ming soared into the sky and took out the starry sky battleship. They boarded the battleship and left dragon head planet.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son was still standing guard at the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>“Kid, let’s see how long you can stay here.”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son snorted. His eyes were filled with killing intent and passion.</p><p>After a while, an old man rushed in.</p><p>“How is it? How’s that b * tch Ouyang Xiangxiang?”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son asked.</p><p>“He’s gone. He’s already left.”</p><p>The old man replied.</p><p>“He left? You’re all really trash. If it wasn’t for the fact that I couldn’t leave this place, I would have personally suppressed her. ”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son snorted, which made the elder’s face turn ugly.</p><p>“Is it just Ouyang Qingxiang? Are there any others?”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son said.</p><p>y-yes, there’s one more person. It’s Lu Ming. He left with Holy maiden Qingxiang …</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>However, before the elder could finish, the Tian Hong Saint son yelled in disbelief.</p><p>“What? What did you just say? You mean Lu Ming?”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son jumped up and yelled at the elder as if he was going to eat him.</p><p>The elder was shocked. He did not understand why the Tian Hong Saint son had such a huge reaction when he heard Lu Ming’s name. He was confused.</p><p>look carefully. That’s really Lu Ming and not anyone else.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son asked, his eyes wide.</p><p>“There’s no mistake. It’s definitely Lu Ming!”</p><p>The old man said firmly.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it, there’s still a way up there. Damn it, chase, quickly chase …”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son roared. He turned into a beam of light and chased after them.</p><p>Outside the cave, the Tian Hong Saint son led his subordinates and chased after the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>However, it was already too late. Lu Ming and the rest had long left.</p><p>In the Starship.</p><p>“Lu Ming, have you already obtained the complete divine Dragon materialization technique?”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang asked curiously.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He did not hide anything and told her what had happened in the cave.</p><p>“This time, I have to thank Holy maiden Qingxiang for her help. Otherwise, it would be very difficult for me to help. In the future, if Holy maiden Qingxiang needs anything, feel free to ask. Lu Ming will definitely not refuse.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>you’re welcome, ” ye mo said. but I’m afraid Tianhong will find out soon and will come after you. He has been trying to get the complete divine Dragon materialization technique. Now that you’ve got it, I’m afraid he’ll go crazy.</p><p>“We need to hurry back to Kong Xuan sect to make preparations.”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
