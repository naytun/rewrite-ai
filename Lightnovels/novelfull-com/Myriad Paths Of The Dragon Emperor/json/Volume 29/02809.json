I hope she doesn’t come out during this time.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had kept a low profile when he brought Qiu Yue to the Kong Xuan sect. Not many people knew about his relationship with Qiu Yue, so she should be fine.</p><p>After Ouyang Xiangxiang returned to her residence, she gathered many experts from her faction and stationed them on the mountain peak where she lived.</p><p>Not long after Lu Ming and the rest returned, the Tian Hong Saint son returned with his men.</p><p>The moment he returned, he rushed to Lu Ming’s residence. When he did not find Lu Ming, he went to an hai. The residences of Liu Chang and the others were also empty.</p><p>Hmph, you’re definitely hiding at that b * tch Ouyang Qingxiang’s place. Don’t think that you’ll be fine just because you’re hiding there. If you don’t hand over the divine Dragon materialization art, I’ll kill you even if you hide at the ends of the earth.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son’s furious roar was heard. He then gathered a large number of experts and charged toward Ouyang Xiangxiang’s residence.</p><p>why did the Tian Hong Saint son suddenly gather so many experts? ”</p><p>something big has happened. Something big must have happened. He is heading towards where saintess Qingxiang lives. Does he want to start a war with her? ”</p><p>“Quick, inform the Saint!”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son had gathered so many experts and rushed toward Ouyang Xiangxiang’s residence in an overbearing manner. Naturally, this could not be hidden from the others. The people from the other Saint son’s factions soon found out and many of them rushed toward Ouyang Xiangxiang’s residence.</p><p>At Ouyang Xiangxiang’s residence, Lu Ming, Ouyang Xiangxiang, and the rest were having a meeting.</p><p>“They’re here!”</p><p>An old woman suddenly spoke and looked outside.</p><p>The old woman was an inner court elder from Ouyang Qingxiang’s faction. She was extremely powerful.</p><p>“They came quite quickly. Let’s go out and ‘welcome’ them.”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang sneered.</p><p>They walked out of the courtyard and stood in the air.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>In the distance, there was a rumbling explosion, and then waves of terrifying divine power surged over like thousands of soldiers.</p><p>However, there were also many experts gathered at Ouyang Xiangxiang’s residence. All of them released their auras, and their auras shot up into the sky like smoke, crushing the surging waves of divine power.</p><p>On the horizon, a black mass of people appeared. There were more than a thousand people.</p><p>The person in the lead was the Tianhong Saint son.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son and his people stopped a thousand miles away.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son’s eyes fell on Lu Ming, filled with murderous intent and greed.</p><p>“Tianhong, what do you want to do by bringing so many people here in such an aggressive manner?”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang asked despite already knowing the answer.</p><p>“What do you want? It’s very simple. Hand Lu Ming over to me and I’ll leave with my men immediately.”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son said.</p><p>“Give you Holy Son Lu Ming? What a joke, Lu Ming is also a Saint. He can’t be taken away by just anyone.”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang sneered.</p><p>“Today, I must take Lu Ming away. Whoever stops me will be my enemy. I will not hesitate to fight.”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son said coldly.</p><p>Not only did Lu Ming take the complete divine Dragon materialization art, but he also had the bloodline of the nine-clawed Divine Dragon. To the Tian Hong Saint son, Lu Ming was a huge treasure trove.</p><p>As long as he could obtain Lu Ming’s nine-clawed Divine Dragon bloodline and the complete divine Dragon materialization technique, his combat strength would definitely be elevated to an astonishing level.</p><p>He could even surpass the Supreme Holy Son and become the number one Holy Son of the Kong Xuan sect. In that case, the position of the future sect leader of the Kong Xuan sect would be in his pocket.</p><p>When he thought of this, his heart was burning with passion.</p><p>He had to get Lu Ming.</p><p>“If you want to fight, then fight. Do you think I’ll be afraid of you?”</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang was extremely domineering.</p><p>“Good, very good. Today, I’ll destroy your sect. Attack and take down Lu Ming.”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son roared.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The experts from the Tianhong Saint son’s faction and Ouyang Qingxiang’s faction all unleashed terrifying auras. They clashed in the air, creating powerful shockwaves.</p><p>There were quite a few inner sect elders here. They were all peak heavenly God Realm existences. At this moment, the clash of auras was earth-shaking.</p><p>Then, a few figures soared into the sky. In an instant, they had rushed out of the atmosphere and were fighting in the starry sky.</p><p>A peak heavenly God was too terrifying. If they fought within the atmosphere, the damage to the earth would be unimaginable.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The most powerful people fought beyond the starry sky, while the Tian Hong Saint son and the others attacked Ouyang Qingxiang and Lu Ming.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang and the others did not back down and also charged over.</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang once again engaged the Tian Hong Saint son in battle.</p><p>“Capture Lu Ming!”</p><p>“Take him down!”</p><p>A few heavenly God-level powerhouses charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Fortunately, Ouyang Qingxiang also had an expert by Lu Ming’s side who blocked the other party’s attack.</p><p>Thousands of experts from both sides were engaged in a fierce battle.</p><p>And this area was already surrounded by people.</p><p>Even Saint son Zhi Xia and saintess Xue Tan had come.</p><p>what exactly happened? Tian Hong actually led his men to fight Ouyang Xiangxiang? ”</p><p>Saint son Zhi Xia said, full of doubts.</p><p>I don’t know, but it must be something big. Otherwise, the Tian Hong Saint son wouldn’t be so crazy. He’s bent on capturing Lu Ming. I guess Lu Ming has offended him again.</p><p>Holy maiden Xue Tan said.</p><p>However, they would not stop them. They were looking forward to the battle between the Tianhong Saint son and Ouyang Qingxiang. It would be best if both of them were seriously injured. That way, they would have less competition.</p><p>The battle was getting more and more intense, and there were even people who had fallen.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, a huge hand suddenly appeared in the starry sky.</p><p>This huge hand was boundlessly huge, and it pressed down on the inner sect elders who were fighting.</p><p>“Godking …”</p><p>The inner sect elders screamed in horror. Then, they were crushed by the big hand, and they were blasted into the atmosphere like meteorites, falling to the ground.</p><p>Then, a figure suddenly appeared in the sky, exuding a terrifying pressure that pressed down on the people from the Tianhong Saint son’s and Ouyang Qingxiang’s factions.</p><p>the people of the two factions were immediately locked in the air by this energy, unable to move.</p><p>“Brat, a Godking has appeared. I’m going to hide.”</p><p>Bone’s voice rang out before disappearing into Jing Yu’s portrait.</p><p>“God King, what a terrifying pressure!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the figure in the sky, his eyes filled with shock.</p><p>At this moment, his body couldn’t move at all under the pressure.</p><p>Even the high-leveled divine realm experts couldn’t move an inch.</p><p>it’s the Deputy Hall Master of the enforcement Hall!</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>The Tianhong Saint son, Ouyang Qingxiang, and the others also looked serious.</p><p>Clearly, their battle had alerted the Tribunal Council. Even the divine King vice Hall Master had come personally.</p><p>as Holy Sons and holy virgins, you actually led your fellow disciples to kill each other. How can you do that? ”</p><p>The authoritative voice of the enforcement Hall’s vice Hall Master sounded.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
