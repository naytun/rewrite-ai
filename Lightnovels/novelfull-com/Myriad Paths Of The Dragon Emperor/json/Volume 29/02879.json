Lu Ming had already left the Great Hall and quickly returned to his residence.</p><p>“Senior bone demon, do you know of the rising Dragon array?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked the bone demon as soon as he came back.</p><p>of course I know the rising Dragon array. Hahaha, so it’s the rising Dragon array. I know what that kid is going to do!</p><p>Bone laughed.</p><p>“Senior bone demon, do you know the true purpose of the Dragon Boat Mountain?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he asked.</p><p>that’s right. If I’m not wrong, the reason why the Dragon Boat Mountain placed the dark Dragon blood Curse in your body was to use you to refine the dark Dragon blood Curse and then use it to save someone, someone who was trapped in the rising Dragon formation.</p><p>“And I’m guessing that your sect master is no longer the real person.”</p><p>Bone said.</p><p>“It’s not the real person?”</p><p>Lu Ming was surprised.</p><p>that’s right. His own soul has probably been destroyed long ago. Now, his body is occupied by someone else. If I’m not wrong, the person who occupied his body is the existence trapped by the rising Dragon array. He wants to use you to escape and regain his freedom.</p><p>“Once he succeeds, you will also die.”</p><p>Bone analyzed the situation clearly, as if he had seen through everything.</p><p>“It’s actually like this …”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned by the bone demon’s analysis.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the real Dragon Boat Mountain had already died long ago. The current Dragon Boat Mountain was only an existence whose body had been occupied by someone else.</p><p>“As expected, he didn’t have good intentions.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was cold. The Dragon Boat Mountain’s goal was indeed to sacrifice him to save him.</p><p>“Senior bone demon, do you have any countermeasures?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Since I know his goal, I naturally have a plan to deal with it. We still have ten years. Lu Ming, do as I say. First, we need to buy some materials and refine an array disc. Then, we’ll fight him.”</p><p>The bone demon said. Then, a series of material names appeared in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>“These materials …”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. He had not heard of many of the materials that the bone demon had mentioned.</p><p>“Kid, hurry up and get these materials!”</p><p>Bone said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and left the place. He also left Kong Xuan sect and headed towards planet thousand spirits.</p><p>Myriad spirit star was the gathering place of the entire Qin Tian Starfield’s Chamber of Commerce. All kinds of strange materials could be bought here.</p><p>After arriving on planet thousand spirits, Lu Ming finally bought most of the materials he needed after many inquiries. However, there were still three kinds of materials that he had not bought.</p><p>These three materials were extremely rare and precious.</p><p>The three materials were the nine-clawed Divine Dragon’s bone, the evil energy stone, and the desolate chaotic grass.</p><p>the bone of a nine-clawed Divine Dragon? where can we find it? senior nine Dragon has long passed away.</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his eyebrows.</p><p>I wonder if the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron contains the bones of a nine-clawed Divine Dragon? ”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly thought of the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron had been forged by the nine Dragons and the ancestral Dragon with all their strength. It was just a little bit away from being promoted to a divine artifact, and was the Natal magic weapon of the nine Dragons.</p><p>Natal Dharma Treasures were usually forged from one’s own flesh, blood, and bones in order to display their strongest power.</p><p>Back in the heaven realm, the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron had been of great help to Lu Ming.</p><p>However, ever since Lu Ming came to the primeval universe, his combat strength had skyrocketed. The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron was no longer of any use to him. However, Lu Ming had never thrown it away. Instead, he had kept it.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming waved his hand and the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron flew out from a storage ring.</p><p>“Senior bone demon, take a look at these nine Cauldrons. Do they contain the bones of a nine-clawed Divine Dragon?”</p><p>Lu Ming consulted the bone demon.</p><p>The bone demon flew out from between Lu Ming’s eyebrows and stopped above the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron. It studied it carefully.</p><p>that’s right. The nine Cauldrons contain the bones of the nine-clawed true dragon. The bones of the nine-clawed Divine Dragon are the foundation of the nine Cauldrons.</p><p>Bone nodded.</p><p>“It really is …”</p><p>Lu Ming was also very surprised.</p><p>He had only been guessing before, but he didn’t expect it to come true.</p><p>One could imagine that the nine Dragons had paid a huge price in order to refine this huge cauldron, and they had actually used their own bone armor to forge it.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. In this case, Lu Ming was only left with two of the three most difficult materials to find.</p><p>Lu Ming came to a place that was specially used to gather information. After some inquiries and paying a high price, Lu Ming finally found out the whereabouts of the last two materials.</p><p>the evil profound stone is in an evil clan in the rushing void galaxy. I’ll go to that clan first!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took the teleportation array and rushed to the rushing void galaxy.</p><p>On the surface, the Luo family of the virtual Galaxy was a normal cultivation family. However, they were actually an evil family. Their cultivation technique was extremely evil. They specialized in digging out the eyes of other cultivators to cultivate their evil technique.</p><p>Lu Ming had also paid a huge price to find out this information from the organization that was investigating.</p><p>“Such a family doesn’t need to exist anymore.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold.</p><p>After a long journey, Lu Ming arrived at the Luo family’s residence.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming appeared in the sky above the Luo family’s residence, his vast aura erupting.</p><p>“Who dares to appear in the sky above my Luo family?”</p><p>With a loud shout, a few strong men flew out.</p><p>These few brawny men had peak true God cultivation bases. When they saw that Lu Ming was also peak true God cultivation bases, they instantly revealed ferocious expressions.</p><p>kid, Who are you? tell me the truth, or you won’t be able to leave.</p><p>One of the burly men shouted. He stared at Lu Ming’s eyes with an evil and greedy look.</p><p>He wanted to dig out Lu Ming’s eyeballs to cultivate.</p><p>“The person who will kill you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. Then, a violent divine power surged towards the other party.</p><p>Lu Ming’s divine power was extremely strong. To the few burly men, it was simply a perilous situation.</p><p>The divine power crushed over and the few burly men screamed in pain. Their bodies were crushed by Lu Ming’s divine power and finally turned into ashes and dissipated in the air.</p><p>He was also at the peak of true God. However, the other peak true gods were like ants in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>“How dare you kill my Luo family’s people?”</p><p>“A mere true God Realm, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>At this moment, the entire Luo family was in an uproar. Powerful auras shot up into the sky. Powerful figures rushed up into the sky and headed for Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s expression was calm.</p><p>He had long inquired about it. In the Luo family, the strongest was only a fourth level celestial deity.</p><p>There were only about thirty heavenly God-level powerhouses in total. Lu Ming did not take them to heart at all.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>ancient God Body! Lu Ming roared. He used his ancient God Body and turned into a giant ancient God, charging at the Luo family experts.</p><p>As the long spear was swung, a large number of Luo family experts exploded and died on the spot.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
