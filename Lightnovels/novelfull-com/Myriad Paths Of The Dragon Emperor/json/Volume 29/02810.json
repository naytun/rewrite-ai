He suddenly sent people to attack me. I could only lead my men to resist.</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang was the first to speak.</p><p>“Bullsh * t! You and that Lu Ming kid joined forces and snatched my treasure. It’s only right and proper for me to take Lu Ming and take back my treasure.”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son roared.</p><p>“What a joke, what treasure? That’s a secret technique from a relic. As long as you haven’t obtained anything from the relic, you’ll get a share.”</p><p>“You’re the useless one who can’t get it, and now that I’ve got it, I have to give it to you?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mocking voice was heard.</p><p>“I’ve already discovered the ruins.”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son roared, bursting with cold killing intent. He glared at Lu Ming ferociously, wanting to cut him into pieces.</p><p>“Hahaha, laughable, even more laughable. You’re a Saint child, yet you actually said such laughable words. According to your logic, as long as I explore all the ruins, once I find it, it’ll be mine, and no one else is allowed to enter? Is that even possible?”</p><p>“I’m really suspicious. How did you become the Saint with such a brain? There are still so many people who want to join you? Hey, all of you who have submitted to Tian Hong, think carefully. There’s no future in following such a person. Why don’t you all come and submit to me!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily.</p><p>“What did you just say? Piece of sh * t, I’m going to kill you …”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son was furious. His eyes were burning with rage. He wanted to rush up and kill Lu Ming. Unfortunately, he could not move under the pressure of the Vice Hall Master of the law enforcement Hall.</p><p>alright, no matter what grudges you have between yourselves, you’ll be severely punished for killing your fellow sect members within the sect!</p><p>The Vice Hall Master of the enforcement Hall spoke. His voice was filled with dignity and killing intent, causing many people to shiver.</p><p>The Vice Hall Master of the law enforcement Hall was famous for his strictness in law enforcement. Even the Tian Hong Saint son felt his heart turn cold and suppressed his anger.</p><p>Tianhong, you started the fight first. It’s your fault. I’ll give you three days to hand over 200000 points, then go to the wall-facing cliff and face the wall for 20 years. Do you agree? ”</p><p>The Vice Hall Master of the law enforcement Hall looked at the Tian Hong Saint son coldly.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son was very unconvinced, but he didn’t dare to say no.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son lowered his head. His killing intent had reached its peak.</p><p>“Lu Ming, if I don’t kill you, I’m not a human. The bloodline of the nine-clawed Divine Dragon and the divine Dragon materialization art are all mine.”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son roared in his heart.</p><p>Qingxiang, since you were on the defensive and you are not in the wrong, you will be punished to face the wall for ten years. Are you willing to accept this? ”</p><p>The Vice Hall Master of the enforcement Hall looked at Ouyang Qingxiang.</p><p>“This disciple is sincerely convinced.”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang nodded.</p><p>“Alright, now, let’s all disperse!”</p><p>The Vice Palace Master of the enforcement Palace waved his hand, and the pressure disappeared without a trace.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son growled and left with his men.</p><p>“It’s over.”</p><p>The Holy Sons Zhi Xia and Xue Tan were a little disappointed and left one after another.</p><p>“Holy Son Qingxiang, Lu Ming has implicated you.”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Ouyang Qingxiang apologetically.</p><p>It was all because of Lu Ming that Ouyang Qingxiang was punished. Moreover, some people from her faction had fallen and many people were injured. Lu Ming felt a little apologetic.</p><p>it’s okay. I’ll just have to face the wall for ten years. It’ll pass in the blink of an eye. I can train my state of mind. However, the Tian Hong Saint son has also been punished. He won’t dare to make a move in the sect for a while. However, you still have to be careful outside the sect. Tian Hong won’t let this go easily.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming bade farewell to Ouyang Qingxiang and returned to his residence.</p><p>The days after that were indeed peaceful. The Tian Hong Saint son did not send anyone to deal with Lu Ming.</p><p>I still have to increase my strength as soon as possible. Now that QiuQiu has broken through to the eighth-stage true God Realm, it’s a great help for me. If QiuQiu can break through to the celestial God Realm, it’ll be great. I’ll go exchange for some divine weapon fragments for QiuQiu to eat.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and then sorted out all the storage rings he had on him.</p><p>During this period of time, he had killed many powerful enemies and obtained many storage rings. The number of treasures and divine crystals he had collected was shocking.</p><p>Lu Ming exchanged most of the treasures and divine crystals for points. He then used the points to exchange for a large number of fragments of the divine artifact.</p><p>Even the lowest grade was a fragment of a middle grade level nine divine artifact.</p><p>There were even some fragments of high-grade divine artifacts.</p><p>The price of a high-grade divine artifact, even if it was just a fragment, was astonishingly high. As such, Lu Ming did not have many points left.</p><p>After returning to his residence, Lu Ming gave all the divine artifact fragments to QiuQiu and let it eat them slowly. As for himself, he began to comprehend the complete divine Dragon materialization technique.</p><p>The complete divine Dragon materialization technique was much more difficult to cultivate, and it also took a lot more time.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had only used half a year to successfully cultivate the complete divine Dragon materialization technique.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar was heard, and a Divine Dragon condensed above his head. This Divine Dragon had nine claws and was extremely similar to the nine Dragons.</p><p>It was a nine-clawed Divine Dragon.</p><p>Lu Ming had finally cultivated the nine-clawed Divine Dragon Dharma power. As long as Lu Ming willed it, the nine-clawed Divine Dragon Dharma power would pounce out to attack the enemy. Its power was astonishing.</p><p>Of course, the divine Dragon materialization art was still far from completion.</p><p>As Lu Ming’s understanding deepened, he could cultivate a second, third, and even more Divine Dragon phenomenon in the future.</p><p>In the days that followed, Lu Ming cultivated in peace.</p><p>They took turns to cultivate all kinds of divine skills and secret techniques.</p><p>Cultivation knew no time. To Immortals, a few decades was too short. It would pass in the blink of an eye.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, more than twenty years had passed.</p><p>In the past twenty years, Lu Ming had entered a period of stability. He did not improve much in all aspects. His main focus was to stabilize and build a solid foundation.</p><p>On the other hand, QiuQiu had swallowed a large number of divine weapon fragments, and its cultivation had improved a step further, reaching stage nine true God.</p><p>As for Qiu Yue, she had been cultivating in a secret room in the divine pulse tower for more than 20 years.</p><p>Lu Ming had also gone to take a look. The secret chamber exuded Qiu Yue’s life aura. Everything was normal, so Lu Ming had nothing to worry about.</p><p>At this moment, a piece of news spread like a hurricane to the Qin heaven thirteen clans and some other powerful forces.</p><p>On the ancient God Star, the array on the bronze door was finally broken.</p><p>Some of the strongest formation Masters in the Qin heaven Starfield, after decades of hard work, finally broke the formation above and opened the bronze door.</p><p>Many people had already gone in to explore, but the results were shocking.</p><p>Behind the bronze door was a world, an ancient world. Inside, there were many heavenly treasures, many of which had already gone extinct in the outside world.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
