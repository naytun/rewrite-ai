Although the many experts had destroyed Lu Ming’s ice chains and nine-layered Crimson Gold armor, they could not break through the defense of the green scales.</p><p>Although some of the scales were broken and blood seeped out of his body, Lu Ming managed to block the attack.</p><p>Lu Ming had a rough idea of his own defense.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. He no longer cared about his own defense. He waved his long spear and charged at the old woman.</p><p>The old woman was already severely injured by Lu Ming and did not have the strength to fight back at all. At this moment, she retreated frantically in fear and shouted, ” “Save me, save me …”</p><p>However, Lu Ming had resisted the other people’s attacks and was charging toward him. The others wanted to save him but they were too late.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The long spear thrust out, and a huge spear light crushed toward the old woman. In front of the huge spear light, the old woman’s body was as small as an ant. She exploded and turned into ashes.</p><p>A seventh-level celestial deity powerhouse was killed by Lu Ming just like that.</p><p>After killing the old woman, Lu Ming changed the direction of his spear and attacked the others.</p><p>In the process of attacking the others, Lu Ming’s body kept flashing with various kinds of lights.</p><p>He had nine layers of Crimson Gold armor, ice chains, and even three divine Dragons.</p><p>Lu Ming did not use these godly skills and secret skills to attack. Instead, he used them for defense.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>One attack after another landed on Lu Ming’s body. His body trembled. The ice chains, the nine-layer Crimson Gold armor, and the divine Dragon phenomenon all crumbled. However, in this way, the power of the attacks that really landed on Lu Ming’s body was reduced by a lot. Lu Ming had blocked all of them.</p><p>Lu Ming looked like he was covered in blood, but his vital parts were not injured.</p><p>Lu Ming blocked the attacks of the others, but the others could not block Lu Ming’s attacks. Lu Ming specifically targeted a seventh-level celestial deity and launched a fierce attack. Very soon, this person followed in the old woman’s footsteps and was killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>After killing two seventh level celestial deity existences in a row, the others were finally a little afraid. Their eyes were filled with fear. Some of them even slowed down their attacks, planning to escape if something went wrong.</p><p>Lu Ming, on the other hand, became more and more courageous as the battle progressed. His fighting spirit soared. A terrifying spear radiance was continuously thrust and swept out. Not long after, two more people were killed.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>Some of them were terrified. Seeing Lu Ming coming, they did not dare to fight back and retreated, afraid that Lu Ming would target them.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming did not chase after him. With a sway of his body, he rushed directly towards the heart of desolation. When he was close to the heart of desolation, no one was competing with him.</p><p>Lu Ming grabbed the heart of desolation and kept it in his storage ring.</p><p>“Damn it …”</p><p>“Damn it, my chaotic heart!”</p><p>Many people were roaring in their hearts. They watched helplessly as Lu Ming kept the heart of desolation. They were extremely envious but no one dared to step forward to stop him.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was too strong. The main thing was that his defense was too strong. They could not break through Lu Ming’s defense and could not give him a fatal blow.</p><p>If it was another expert who had similar attack power as Lu Ming but did not have such a strong defense, he would definitely not be a match for so many of them. He would be killed by their joint attack.</p><p>It was a pity that after Lu Ming transformed into the ancient God’s body, his defense was too strong. He could withstand their attacks and then chase after one person. This made them frightened.</p><p>“The heart of desolation, I’ve finally gotten it!”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s mouth curled into a smile. He then rushed in the direction he came from.</p><p>No one stopped Lu Ming wherever he went.</p><p>Although the heart of desolation was precious, it was far less valuable than his own life.</p><p>Lu Ming left the place unimpeded and went outside.</p><p>Outside, many people cast suspicious glances at Lu Ming.</p><p>“You’re out? What was going on inside? Did anyone get the heart of desolation?”</p><p>“You seem to be heavily injured. You must have been seriously injured and withdrawn from the competition, right?”</p><p>Many people saw that Lu Ming was the first one to come out and immediately started asking questions.</p><p>that’s right. They’re fighting for the heart of desolation and there’s a great battle going on inside. My cultivation base is too weak and I can’t defeat them. I’m lucky to have survived.</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Everyone nodded and believed that Lu Ming was telling the truth. No one suspected that Lu Ming had obtained the heart of desolation.</p><p>Therefore, no one suspected Lu Ming. He left the place without any obstacles and headed out of the desolate mountain range.</p><p>“Hahaha, Lu Ming, you’re quite lucky. You didn’t get the desolate grass, but you got the heart of desolation. If you use the heart of desolation to refine a formation disk, its power will be even more astonishing. At that time, you’ll have a higher chance of dealing with that Dragon Boat.”</p><p>In his sea of consciousness, the bone demon laughed heartily, sighing at Lu Ming’s luck.</p><p>Lu Ming was very happy. Now that he had found all the things that the bone demon had mentioned, he could return to Kong Xuan sect and refine the array disc.</p><p>If the Dragon boats mountain wanted to sacrifice him to break the rising Dragon formation, it wouldn’t be that easy!</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming left the mountains of desolation. After spending some time, he returned to the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>After returning to Kong Xuan sect, Lu Ming went to look for Ouyang Qingxiang.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you want to see my grandfather?”</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang asked in surprise.</p><p>“Yes, I have something that I would like to ask senior Yue for help.”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>The disk array that bone demon had mentioned was extremely profound. With Lu Ming’s current cultivation base, he could not refine it at all. Only a God King could refine it completely and unleash its full power.</p><p>However, it was easier said than done to get a God King to help. Therefore, Lu Ming immediately thought of Ouyang Qingxiang’s grandfather, Yue Wuya.</p><p>Lu Ming had helped Ouyang Qingxiang to become the zongzi of the Kong Xuan sect. There was no reason for Yue Wuya to reject Lu Ming.</p><p>I’m asking my grandfather for help. It’s a small matter. Come with me.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang nodded, then brought Lu Ming to Yue Wu Ya’s cultivation place.</p><p>When they arrived at Yue Wu Ya’s cultivation place, Lu Ming waited outside while Ouyang Xiangxiang went in to look for Yue Wu Ya.</p><p>Not long after, Ouyang Xiangxiang came out with a smile on her face. “Lu Ming, my grandfather just came out of seclusion. I’ll bring you to see him!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and followed Ouyang Qingxiang to a large hall where he met Yue Wu Ya.</p><p>“Junior Lu Ming greets senior Yue!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and saluted. After all, the other party was a Divine King expert, a top-notch expert from the Qin heaven Star Zone. He still had to show some courtesy.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re welcome. Sit!”</p><p>Yue Wuya smiled and invited Lu Ming to take a seat.</p><p>Lu Ming had helped Ouyang Xiangxiang obtain the zongzi position, and Yue Wuya’s impression of Lu Ming was extremely good. The more he looked at Lu Ming, the more he liked him. He was even thinking about how to match Lu Ming and Ouyang Xiangxiang together. This way, Ouyang Xiangxiang’s position in the Kong Xuan sect would be as stable as Mount Tai in the future. Therefore, he was naturally very polite to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang took their seats and someone came to make tea.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
