He saw a group of ancient gods in this starry sky.</p><p>Yes, not one, but a group.</p><p>This group of ancient gods, each of their bodies was indomitable and incomparably huge.</p><p>Each one of them exuded a terrifying aura. The entire universe trembled under such pressure.</p><p>These ancient gods seemed to be fighting with something. It was simply destructive. The universe’s starry sky shattered and exploded one after another.</p><p>Lu Ming even saw the galaxies exploding and being destroyed.</p><p>Such a scene was truly shocking.</p><p>However, the next moment, the scene changed again.</p><p>Lu Ming saw a purple bronze coffin floating in the starry sky. It kept floating and he did not know where it was floating to.</p><p>Lu Ming had been drifting in the starry sky. He did not know how long it had been. He was sleepy and slowly fell into a deep sleep.</p><p>He didn’t know how much time had passed before he woke up again. What greeted his eyes was an underground cave.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you alright?” A crisp sound was transmitted to Lu Ming’s ears.</p><p>Lu Ming turned his head and saw Ouyang Qingxiang’s concerned gaze.</p><p>“I’m fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and then looked around.</p><p>He was still in the same underground cave, but the mutant gold planet Devourer was dead.</p><p>His entire body was shriveled, and the Golden armor on his body was extremely dim. There was no sign of life, as if all the essence in his body had been sucked away.</p><p>The purple copper coffin was still suppressing the mutated Golden Planet Devourer.</p><p>However, the lid of the coffin, which had been slightly open, was now completely closed without a single gap.</p><p>“What were those things I saw just now? Was it the strange phenomenon in the purple copper coffin? Also, why is the mutated gold planet Devourer dead, but I, Ouyang Qingxiang, am fine?”</p><p>Many thoughts flashed through Lu Ming’s mind and he had many questions.</p><p>it’s dangerous, kid. It’s really dangerous this time. I’m in big trouble because of you …</p><p>Bone demon’s voice came from his sea of consciousness.</p><p>Lu Ming’s inner consciousness discovered that the bone demon was lying on the scroll. The bone armor, which was originally shiny, had dimmed and looked listless.</p><p>“Senior, what’s wrong?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“It’s all because I helped you close that purple gold coffin.”</p><p>Bone shouted.</p><p>“Purple copper coffin? Senior, what exactly is in that purple copper coffin? The mutated gold planet Devourer, did it die because of the purple gold coffin?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked the question in his heart.</p><p>that’s right. The mutated gold planet Devourer died because of the purple copper coffin. As for what’s inside the purple copper coffin, I don’t know either. Maybe there’s the corpse of an unparalleled master buried inside, or maybe there’s an entire world or a part of history buried inside …</p><p>Bone muttered, his eyes shining with a serious light.</p><p>“Buried an entire world, a piece of history?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>It was understandable to bury an expert, but to bury an entire world, a piece of history, what was going on?</p><p>my guess is that the origin of this purple copper coffin is shocking. I don’t know what’s in it, but it’s very dangerous. No, extremely dangerous.</p><p>“It’s a good thing that I only opened a small crack this time. Otherwise, God knows what would have happened. It would have been extremely terrifying, and you and I would have both died. Kid, don’t try to open this purple copper coffin so easily in the future.”</p><p>Bone warned.</p><p>MMH!</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“Kid, this time I really suffered a great loss in order to cover the purple copper coffin. You, on the other hand, got a great bargain.”</p><p>Bone said unhappily.</p><p>“I picked up a big bargain?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled. However, he was stunned at the next moment.</p><p>He realized that his body was filled with power. His ancient God heart was beating with great strength, and his qi and blood were surging to the extreme.</p><p>Previously, he had burned the ancient God’s heart and almost used up all of its energy. But now, it had recovered and was even more powerful than before.</p><p>Lu Ming had a feeling that his ancient God Body had made a breakthrough. If he could turn into an ancient God Body now, he might not only be a green-armored ancient God, but a level five green-armored ancient God Body.</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming’s heart thumped. He planned to give it a try.</p><p>After greeting Ouyang Qingxiang, Lu Ming’s body continued to grow. In the end, he turned into an ancient God that was two hundred meters tall.</p><p>The scales all over his body were no longer green, but had turned blue.</p><p>It really was the green-armored ancient God.</p><p>Lu Ming was ecstatic. At that moment, he felt that he had an endless amount of energy in his body. He was many times stronger than before.</p><p>my cultivation has also broken through and reached the limit of stage nine true God Realm.</p><p>Lu Ming was pleasantly surprised to discover that his cultivation had also broken through. Not only did he reach the ninth stage true God, but he had also reached the limit of the ninth stage true God. He was not far from the celestial God-level.</p><p>“What’s going on? Could it be related to the strange phenomenon I saw earlier?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s imagination ran wild. What he had just seen was all about the ancient gods.</p><p>An ancient God destroyed one planet after another with a single punch and traversed the starry sky. It was terrifying to the extreme.</p><p>In another scene, a group of ancient gods was fighting with the enemy. The scene was even more shocking. The universe’s starry sky was shattered, and the entire Galaxy collapsed.</p><p>All of this was definitely related to the purple copper coffin.</p><p>A blessing in disguise, it was really a blessing in disguise.</p><p>Lu Ming’s face was full of smiles.</p><p>Previously, he had burned his ancient God’s heart and fought fiercely with the gold planet Devourer. It was best that the energy of the ancient God’s heart was almost exhausted. Lu Ming thought that he would never use the ancient God Body again. He did not expect that not only could he use the ancient God Body, but it had also evolved to the green-armored ancient God.</p><p>He had even broken through in his cultivation, saving him a lot of time.</p><p>The bone demon was right. Lu Ming had really picked up a great bargain. At that moment, Lu Ming felt that he had let the bone demon down.</p><p>Lu Ming gathered his thoughts and transformed back into his human form.</p><p>At the side, Ouyang Qingxiang had been in a state of shock. It took a while before she regained her senses.</p><p>“Miss Ouyang, let’s pack up and go out!”</p><p>Lu Ming told Ouyang Qingxiang.</p><p>“En, Okay, okay …”</p><p>Only then did Ouyang Qingxiang nod her head repeatedly.</p><p>This time, it was really a great harvest. Previously, Lu Ming had killed eleven gold planet devourers. The mutated gold planet devourers did not give specific points. Lu Ming and the rest just treated it as an ordinary gold planet devourers.</p><p>However, the mutated gold planet devourers had three heads, which was equivalent to three gold planet devourers. In total, there were 14 gold planet devourers.</p><p>This was an astonishing harvest. Needless to say, they definitely had the most points in this competition. They didn’t believe that the Supreme Saint son and the transient light Saint son would have so many points.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
