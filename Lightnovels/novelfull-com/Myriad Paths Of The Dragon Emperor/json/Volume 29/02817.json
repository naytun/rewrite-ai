Then, it shone brightly and waves of extremely pure energy surged into Lu Ming’s body from the ” measure ” formula.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the universe myriad Dao mantra at full force to refine the waves of energy.</p><p>The energy refined by the ” quantity ” formula was too pure. He only needed to refine it casually and it would be completely transformed into Lu Ming’s divine power.</p><p>The six divine flames in his dantian continued to grow.</p><p>Originally, the sixth divine fire, a divine fire condensed by the mysterious divine power, was not particularly strong and had not reached the level of the other divine fires. But now, this divine fire was also growing rapidly and catching up with the other divine fires at an amazing speed.</p><p>When the mysterious divine fire caught up with the other divine fires, a loud boom came from Lu Ming’s body. The six divine fires burned fiercely and doubled in size in an instant.</p><p>The divine power in Lu Ming’s body also increased rapidly.</p><p>Fourth stage true God Realm!</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation had broken through to the fourth-stage true God Realm, but it did not stop. His cultivation was still increasing rapidly.</p><p>Back then, the descendants of the ancient gods had planted too many ancient God flowers and absorbed the flesh and blood of many experts. The energy contained in them was extremely rich.</p><p>Back then, most of the energy had been used to condense the ancient God’s heart. However, the remaining energy in the ” quantity ” formula was still extremely strong.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation was rapidly charging towards the peak of the fourth stage of true God Realm. Not long after, he reached the peak of the fourth stage of true God Realm and started to charge towards the fifth stage of true God Realm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Not long after, there was another roar in Lu Ming’s body. He had broken through to the fifth stage of true God!</p><p>It was only when he broke through to the fifth stage true God Realm that the energy that surged out from the quantity formula was completely refined by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Cool, this is too cool!”</p><p>Feeling the surging divine power in his body, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he was filled with confidence.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation had broken through two levels in a row, and his abilities had skyrocketed.</p><p>One must know that secret skills would improve with the breakthrough of cultivation.</p><p>Moreover, the mysterious divine power had also reached the level of other divine powers. The strength of Lu Ming’s divine power had reached an astonishing level, far beyond that of martial cultivators of the same level.</p><p>with my current strength, I can kill that Toad King even if I’m alone!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. He was indeed confident.</p><p>With his current strength, he was completely unafraid of ordinary first level heavenly gods. He could completely kill them.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At the same time, a powerful energy fluctuation was also transmitted from QiuQiu’s side.</p><p>QiuQiu was about to begin its evolution and break through to the heavenly God Realm.</p><p>QiuQiu’s body was filled with a blinding radiance. Tiny bolts of lightning covered its entire body like tiny snakes that slithered around.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The aura on QiuQiu’s body suddenly skyrocketed, as if it had broken through a limit and pierced through the clouds.</p><p>A powerful pressure spread out.</p><p>Heavenly God Realm. This was the pressure of a heavenly God.</p><p>QiuQiu had successfully broken through to the heavenly-god level. It took a long time before the aura on QiuQiu’s body finally stabilized and was completely concealed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>QiuQiu rushed in front of Lu Ming and spun around. It shouted, ” “Lu Ming, do you want to have a competition?”</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head firmly. QiuQiu had reached the heavenly God-level and its combat strength must have increased tremendously. He had suffered a loss when he fought QiuQiu previously. Only a fool would suffer a second loss.</p><p>“Hahaha, you don’t dare to compete with me, do you?”</p><p>QiuQiu was very pleased with itself. It turned its round body around Lu Ming and after a long while, it turned into a bangle and put it on Lu Ming’s hand. Lu Ming then followed the original path and walked outside.</p><p>Whoosh …</p><p>After walking for a while, a Toad appeared in front of Lu Ming and stared at him fiercely.</p><p>Lu Ming could tell that this Toad had the cultivation of the ninth tier true God Realm.</p><p>“I’ll use you to test my strength.”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and activated the double combat power of the battle character formula. He struck out with his palm.</p><p>At the same time, the toad also launched an attack. However, given Lu Ming’s current strength, his palm force whistled like the sea and destroyed the Toad’s attack like a piece of rotten wood. Then, it bombarded the Toad’s body.</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming activated the divine force of Absolute Frost. A layer of ice crystals immediately appeared on the Toad’s body, completely sealing it in ice.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s palm force shook and the Toad’s body shattered into pieces like a piece of ice.</p><p>With one palm, a powerful true God ninth stage Toad was killed by Lu Ming in seconds.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current abilities, he could be said to be invincible among true God-level powerhouses.</p><p>Unless he encountered a peerless genius who also controlled divine-grade divine power and had terrifying secret skills, a true God would definitely be killed in seconds when facing Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was very satisfied with his own strength. He moved and rushed outside.</p><p>Along the way, they encountered toads from time to time but they were all killed by Lu Ming in seconds.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming came out of the Toad’s nest.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had no intention of returning to the base to rest. He was full of divine power and was not injured. Moreover, his abilities had improved greatly. There was no need for him to return to the base to rest. It would be best for him to train in the savage mountains and obtain natural treasures.</p><p>In the next few days, Lu Ming had been training in the desolate mountains and had obtained more natural treasures.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not let the ” quantity ” formula consume all the divine medicine. He kept some of the divine medicine that was rarely seen in the outside world.</p><p>These godly medicines were not only valuable outside, but they might also be useful in the future.</p><p>“Lu Ming, someone’s approaching you at high speed. It’s the people who tried to kill you last time.”</p><p>Suddenly, bone’s voice echoed.</p><p>“These people are really persistent. Alright, I’ll play with you guys this time.”</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>He didn’t leave, but stayed and waited.</p><p>Now, his cultivation base had improved greatly, and QiuQiu had broken through to heavenly God, so he was very confident.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>In just a few breaths, there was a loud sound of air being torn in the distance. Seven to eight figures appeared and charged at Lu Ming at an alarming speed.</p><p>“This kid is here, as expected.”</p><p>“Surround him, don’t let him escape.”</p><p>The moment these people saw Lu Ming, their eyes lit up and they sped up. Their figures flashed and they surrounded Lu Ming from all directions.</p><p>There were a total of eight people. They were the people the Tian Hong Saint son and the transient light Saint son had left behind to pursue Lu Ming. They had not given up and had been wandering around the area for the past few months. Unexpectedly, they had run into Lu Ming.</p><p>The eight of them surrounded Lu Ming. Their powerful auras filled the air and sealed off all directions, afraid that Lu Ming would escape again.</p><p>“What are you doing? All of you look so ferocious. Why aren’t you kowtowing to me?”</p><p>Lu Ming said casually.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>The eight of them laughed.</p><p>One of them laughed and said,”Holy Son?” You’re on the verge of death and you still want to show off? Lu Ming, today is the day you die.”</p><p>“My death? Do you think you can kill me with your pathetic abilities?”</p><p>Lu Ming said in disdain.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
