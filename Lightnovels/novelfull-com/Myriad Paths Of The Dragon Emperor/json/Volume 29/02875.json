Leave this to me. Otherwise, I won’t be able to take care of you guys when the battle starts.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>Kang Chong and Liu Jie hesitated for a moment, then nodded. They moved and arrived at the edge of Zhan Tian.</p><p>They knew that given their abilities, they could not help Lu Ming at all. Instead, they would only drag him down.</p><p>“Hehe, Lu Ming, it seems like you’re really confident in your ability to fight me alone.”</p><p>The Supreme Holy Son glanced at Kang Chong and Liu Jie and sneered. Then, he suddenly took a step forward and rushed toward Lu Ming, throwing a punch.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Golden fist force seemed to have split the void in half. It was as huge as a small mountain and was crushing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was still in the form of the green-armored ancient God. With a shake of his long spear, he pressed down on the Supreme Holy Son with the force of Mount Tai.</p><p>In the process of suppressing it, Lu Ming’s cultivation exploded to the limit of the ninth stage true God Realm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The spear and the Golden fist force collided in the void, creating a deafening boom and scattering the energy in all directions.</p><p>The two of them triggered countless tiny spear lights and Qi, which bombarded the fighting ring. The fighting ring shook violently, and runes appeared on it, forming a large array to block all the Qi.</p><p>However, everyone’s eyes were wide open. Through the light that filled the sky, they watched every move on the field.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the light that filled the sky, the two figures trembled and staggered back.</p><p>Lu Ming and the Supreme Holy Son both retreated. The difference was that Lu Ming retreated more, while the Supreme Holy Son retreated less.</p><p>However, this scene still caused a huge uproar.</p><p>People were shocked. Lu Ming could actually resist the Supreme Holy Son and force him to retreat. This was something that the other Holy Sons could not do.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation base is at the peak of true God. He’s been hiding his abilities!</p><p>he is indeed at the peak of true God Realm. When he was fighting with the Holy Son Zhi Xia, he only revealed his cultivation of the eighth tier of true God Realm. Now, when he is facing the Supreme Holy Son, he only revealed his cultivation of the peak of the ninth tier of true God Realm.</p><p>but, even if he’s at the peak of the ninth stage of true God Realm, his combat power is too terrifying. You should know that the Supreme Holy son’s cultivation is at the sixth stage of celestial deity realm.</p><p>The scene was in an uproar, and the Supreme Holy son’s face turned grave.</p><p>“Lu Ming, so you’ve been hiding your cultivation level. But this is your limit. You’re dreaming if you think you can fight me with this level of cultivation. Supreme divine fist!”</p><p>The Supreme Saint let out a long howl and waved his fists.</p><p>The speed at which he swung his fists was much slower than before. It was as if he was pushing a mountain. However, a loud rumbling sound could be heard in the void.</p><p>It was as if the entire void was being pushed and pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming could feel a few terrifying fist forces pressing down on him.</p><p>“Divine Dragon phenomenon!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s hands moved at an alarming speed. Two nine-clawed divine Dragons appeared in the sky. They were ten thousand meters long and looked very life-like.</p><p>However, in the next moment, another nine-clawed Divine Dragon was formed next to the two.</p><p>The third one!</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming had broken through his limit. In such a state, he had actually condensed the third Divine Dragon phenomenon.</p><p>Three nine-clawed divine Dragons that were 10000 meters long pounced toward the Supreme Holy Son.</p><p>it’s the Tianhong Saint son’s Divine Dragon materialization technique!</p><p>As soon as the divine Dragon phenomenon appeared, it was recognized.</p><p>it’s really the Tianhong Saint son’s Divine Dragon materialization art. Lu Ming can actually cultivate the divine Dragon materialization art. He actually has the divine Dragon bloodline in his body.</p><p>the scariest thing is that he’s much stronger than the Tianhong Saint son. The Tianhong Saint son has only condensed a six-clawed Divine Dragon, while the Lu Ming Saint son has condensed a nine-clawed Divine Dragon, and three of them at that.</p><p>terrifying! He’s simply unfathomable!</p><p>Everyone present was deeply shocked.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The Supreme Holy Son let out a long roar and pushed his fist force, constantly bombarding the three divine Dragons.</p><p>Another terrifying tremor erupted in the sky.</p><p>The three nine-clawed divine Dragons and the Supreme Holy Son let out a deafening roar that seemed to be able to split the sky.</p><p>Whoosh … Whoosh …</p><p>In such an intense confrontation, Lu Ming also used the three apocalyptic strikes to attack the Supreme Holy Son with all his might. The terrifying spear radiance was aimed at the Supreme Holy son’s vital parts.</p><p>At the same time, the nine ice chains would also try to wrap around the Supreme Holy Son.</p><p>It could be said that Lu Ming had used all his means. Their cooperation was flawless, and their destructive power was shocking. For a moment, he was actually on par with the Supreme Holy Son.</p><p>“Lu Ming’s abilities have become stronger.”</p><p>The sacred son of reflection’s face was extremely dark.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current combat strength had already surpassed his. If he were to fight Lu Ming, he would most likely be no match for him.</p><p>The others were also silent.</p><p>Lu Ming’s abilities had far exceeded everyone’s expectations. He could totally compete with the Supreme Saint.</p><p>“Divine-grade divine energy. The divine energy that Lu Ming controls is definitely divine-grade divine energy.”</p><p>Someone muttered.</p><p>of course, I don’t need you to tell me that. It must be divine grade divine power. However, divine grade divine power can’t be this strong. With the cultivation of peak true God, he can fight with the Supreme Holy Son.</p><p>secret skill. He must have mastered some amazing secret skill to increase his combat strength. It’s so terrifying. I can see that he has already used several secret skills.</p><p>he’s definitely an unparalleled genius. It’s a pity that he’s given too little time. If he were given a few more years, the Supreme Holy Son would definitely not be his match.</p><p>Many people were convinced by Lu Ming’s combat strength. At the same time, they could also guess why the person behind the Supreme Holy Son had proposed to compete for the zongzi position. They must be afraid of Lu Ming.</p><p>The Supreme martial artist’s expression was ugly. The stronger Lu Ming was, the more fearful he was.</p><p>Hmph, Qian Kun still has a trump card that he hasn’t used. This time, Qian Kun will definitely win.</p><p>Grandmaster Dong coldly snorted in his heart.</p><p>At that moment, the Supreme Holy Son let out a long howl.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re not weak at all. You’re qualified to see my ultimate move, Supreme Vajra.”</p><p>die! the Supreme Saint son roared. His body burst out with even more dazzling golden light and started to swell.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the Supreme Holy son’s body had grown to 200 meters tall. His entire body was golden, like an ancient invincible giant.</p><p>This was one of the Supreme Holy son’s strongest secret techniques. When he transformed into the legendary Supreme Vajra, his combat strength would skyrocket.</p><p>Originally, Lu Ming had transformed into a green-armored ancient God and was a hundred meters tall. But now, the Supreme Holy son’s Supreme King Kong was twice as tall as Lu Ming.</p><p>“It’s the secret ancient technique of the Supreme clan, the Supreme Vajra!”</p><p>I heard that the Supreme Saint clan’s ancient secret technique, the Supreme King Kong, is extremely difficult to cultivate. No one from the Supreme clan has successfully cultivated it for many years. I didn’t expect that the Supreme Saint son would be able to successfully cultivate it. His talent is indeed amazing.</p><p>Many people around the fighting ring exclaimed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
