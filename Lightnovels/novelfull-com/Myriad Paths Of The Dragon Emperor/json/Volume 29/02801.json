With your current strength, there’s only one way for you to fight against the Tian Hong Saint son in a short time, and that’s to burn the ancient God heart completely. That way, you’ll gain great power for a short time.“</p><p>however, the consequence is that your ancient God’s heart might disappear completely. The price to pay is extremely great!</p><p>Bone sighed.</p><p>“Burning the ancient God heart? Will it completely disappear?”</p><p>Lu Ming also frowned.</p><p>To be able to condense the ancient God heart was a great opportunity. This kind of opportunity could only be encountered and not sought. If it was lost, there would be no more.</p><p>Lu Ming could not bear to part with it. With the ancient God’s heart, his divine body could grow at all times. In the long run, the benefits were very amazing.</p><p>However, if there was really no other way, he could only take a gamble.</p><p>“Lu Ming, first of all, kneel down!”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son looked down from above. His aura was as vast as the ocean, pressing down on Lu Ming. At the same time, he extended a palm and pressed down.</p><p>A huge palm, like an ancient divine mountain, pressed down on Lu Ming. The palm had not even reached him, but the terrifying pressure was already making Lu Ming’s body creak.</p><p>Unable to fight, completely unable to fight. The gap between the two sides was too great.</p><p>Both Lu Ming and QiuQiu seemed very weak in front of the Tian Hong Saint son.</p><p>it seems like I can only burn my ancient God heart.</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a determined look.</p><p>Although the ancient God’s heart was precious, it was nothing compared to his life.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>Lu Ming made up his mind. He was ready to go all out and burn the ancient God heart.</p><p>At this moment, a delicate voice shouted, ” Tian Hong, you’re a heavenly God Realm Saint, but you’re actually dealing with a third stage true God. You’re really shameless. If you want to fight, I’ll be your opponent!</p><p>Before he finished speaking, a sword light had already flown over from the distance, like a flying immortal.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The sword radiance hit the Tianhong Saint son’s palm print and a loud boom was heard. The palm print shook and was split in half by the sword radiance.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, a figure appeared in the distant sky.</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang!</p><p>At the crucial moment, Ouyang Qingxiang made her move. She slashed open the Tianhong Saint son’s palm print.</p><p>It was not that Ouyang Qingxiang was much stronger than the Tianhong Saint son. It was just that the Tianhong Saint son had not used his full strength in the previous attack. In order to save Lu Ming, Ouyang Qingxiang had used even more strength to break the Tianhong Saint son’s palm print.</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a sigh of relief. Ouyang Qingxiang had arrived. It seemed that he did not need to burn the ancient God’s heart.</p><p>After all, the ancient God’s heart was too precious. Lu Ming could not bear to waste it unless he had no other choice.</p><p>“Ouyang Qingxiang, are you trying to meddle in my business?”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son’s face turned cold as he stared at Ouyang Qingxiang.</p><p>“What do you mean by being a busybody? Lu Ming and I are friends. If you want to deal with him, you’ll be dealing with me. ”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang said.</p><p>“Hmph, do you think you can stop me?”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son snorted. Golden divine power radiated from his body, and his aura grew stronger.</p><p>you’ll know once you try. Although you’ve become a saint earlier than me, you might not be able to defeat me.</p><p>Ouyang Qiang said coldly. An extremely powerful sword Qi burst out from his body and pierced through the sky.</p><p>saintess Qingxiang and the Tianhong Saint son are about to make a move.</p><p>it’s been a long time since the Holy Sons and holy virgins fought each other. I’m looking forward to it. I wonder who’s stronger? ”</p><p>I don’t know. Although Holy maiden Qingxiang became a Holy maiden later, her talent is amazing. She might not be weaker than the Tianhong Saint son.</p><p>I didn’t expect Lu Ming to be friends with Holy maiden Qingxiang. Speaking of which, Lu Ming is indeed terrifying. If he grows up, I’m afraid he will surpass all the other Holy Sons and holy virgins. Only the Supreme Holy Son can fight him.</p><p>“That’s right. I wonder how today’s matter will be resolved.”</p><p>More and more people were gathering in this area.</p><p>Even some of the inner sect elders had appeared and were watching from afar.</p><p>“Divine Dragon’s great palm!”</p><p>Suddenly, the Tian Hong Saint son let out a long roar. His divine power burst forth, and his hands formed seals continuously. With a wave of his hand, a huge Dragon Claw formed. It was incomparably huge and grabbed toward Ouyang Qingxiang.</p><p>“Song of the green Lotus sword!”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang murmured. Her sword momentum soared to the sky as she swung her sword. A green sword light burst forth and slashed at the huge Dragon Claw.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The terrifying collision caused thousands of waves. It was as if the entire inner gate area was shaking violently.</p><p>“Let’s go up and fight!”</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang’s voice was heard as her body turned into a green sword light and shot into the sky.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar was heard from the Tian Hong Saint son’s body. His body suddenly changed drastically.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son’s body became burly. His muscles bulged, and he was twice as big as before.</p><p>A layer of golden scales appeared on the surface of his skin. Under the sunlight, they glowed.</p><p>They were dragon scales. What was even more shocking was that the Tian Hong Saint son had grown a tail. A Dragon Tail.</p><p>“Dragonman race!”</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes slightly. He recognized the Tian Hong Saint son’s race.</p><p>The Tianhong Saint son was from the Dragonman race. Lu Ming had seen this race before. In the yellow spring world of Mount netherworld, there was a country formed by the Dragonman race.</p><p>“Divine Dragon’s great palm!”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son revealed his true form, and his combat power was even stronger. He kept using the Dragon God’s giant palm print. Nine Golden Dragon claws formed in the sky and grabbed toward Ouyang Qingxiang.</p><p>“Song of the green Lotus sword, sword shaking the world!”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang turned around, and a green sword Qi shot out, slashing toward the Golden Dragon Claw.</p><p>The two of them were engaged in an intense battle, and the scene was extremely shocking.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was grave. With his current abilities, he was still far from being comparable to the Tian Hong Saint son and Ouyang Qingxiang.</p><p>“It’s just a fourth level celestial deity. Lu Ming, don’t belittle yourself. With your talent, you’ll be able to catch up to them in a few years.”</p><p>The bone demon’s voice was heard. It seemed to have seen through Lu Ming’s thoughts.</p><p>“Fourth level heavenly deity?”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He wondered what the cultivation levels of the other Holy Sons and holy virgins of Kong Xuan sect were like.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this time, two figures flew over from the distance. They were Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you alright?”</p><p>Yue Linglong asked.</p><p>I’m fine. Were you the ones who informed Holy maiden Qingxiang? thank you!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred. He knew that Ouyang Qingxiang must have rushed over after receiving the notice from Yue Linglong and the rest.</p><p>“It’s good that you’re fine!”</p><p>Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng both nodded and looked up at the battle in the sky.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
