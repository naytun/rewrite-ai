A powerful divine power rushed out madly and exploded in the gold planet Devourer’s body.</p><p>Squeak …</p><p>The gold planet Devourer let out an ear-piercing shriek. It waved its two front claws wildly and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. He could not be bothered to pull out his long spear. He retreated rapidly and avoided the attack of the Golden Planet Devourer.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The Golden Planet Devourer went completely crazy. Its front claws slashed wildly, instantly destroying the green Lotus sword domain. It then turned into a golden stream of light and fled into the distance.</p><p>“This beast has such a strong life force!”</p><p>Lu Ming was also shocked.</p><p>Just now, his spear had pierced through his opponent’s body, and his divine power had exploded from his body, but he had not been able to kill him.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you going to give chase?”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang asked.</p><p>“Chase! Of course we’re going after him, let’s go!”</p><p>let’s go, ” Lu Ming said. He moved and chased in the direction of the gold planet Devourer.</p><p>One gold planet Devourer was worth 50 points. Now that the other party was seriously injured, this was a once-in-a-thousand-years opportunity. How could he miss it?</p><p>If the Golden Planet Devourer was in perfect condition, they would definitely not be able to kill it.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang, Kang Chong, Liu Jie, and the rest also chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>The two sides, one chasing and one fleeing, flew hundreds of thousands of miles in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Lu Ming cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique and was extremely fast. He was slowly closing the distance between him and the Golden Planet Devourer.</p><p>But at this moment, the Golden Planet Devourer rushed into a hole on the ground and disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed and he rushed into the cave. However, he had no choice but to stop.</p><p>That was because the cave was densely packed and criss-crossed like a maze, and the Golden Planet Devourer had disappeared without a trace.</p><p>“What a pity!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed to himself. The other party had actually escaped and he had lost 50 points.</p><p>Lu Ming flew out of the cave. Ouyang Qingxiang, Kang Chong, and Liu Jie chased after him.</p><p>“Lu Ming, how is it?”</p><p>Ouyang asked in a delicate voice.</p><p>there are many other tunnels under this cave. The Devourer has disappeared into the cave.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and smiled.</p><p>“It can’t escape!”</p><p>At this moment, Liu Jie suddenly spoke.</p><p>that’s right. I was born with a star-Sky Seal, and its greatest use is to track. When you were fighting, I secretly attached a star-Sky Seal to the Golden Planet Devourer. I can track its whereabouts with the star-Sky Seal!</p><p>Liu Jie said confidently.</p><p>“Really!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>“It’s true. Liu Jie has indeed mastered the starry sky Seal.”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang said.</p><p>alright, then we’ll track him immediately. When his injuries recover, he’ll be hard to deal with.</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Liu Jie nodded her head and began to perform the seal technique. On her body, Starlight constantly shone, forming a mysterious rune.</p><p>This was what Liu Jie had since she was born.</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly amazed. Indeed, there were all kinds of people in the chaotic universe.</p><p>“This way, let’s go!”</p><p>After a while, Liu Jie spoke and flew in one direction.</p><p>Everyone followed Liu Jie. They had been chasing for half a day before they finally stopped in the air above a dark crack.</p><p>I can feel it. The gold planet Devourer is right under this crack.</p><p>Liu Jie said.</p><p>Lu Ming, Ouyang Qingxiang, and the others sized up the crack.</p><p>The crack wasn’t wide and it was dark. He couldn’t see what was below, but it was obvious that this crack was very deep.</p><p>“Why do I have a vague feeling of danger?”</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang frowned.</p><p>I have the same feeling. I’m afraid there are other devourers down there.</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Then what should we do?”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang asked. Unknowingly, Ouyang Qingxiang had already paid more attention to Lu Ming’s opinion.</p><p>“How about this, the two of us will go down, Kang Chong and Liu Jie will stay on top.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>He and Ouyang Xiangxiang were powerful and had many trump cards. If anything happened, they could save their lives. If Kang Chong and Liu Jie went down, they would be in danger.</p><p>“How can the two of us stay up there alone? we have to go down together.”</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Kang Chong and Liu Jie spoke one after another. They were very loyal to Ouyang Qingxiang.</p><p>“No need, you guys stay up there!”</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang waved her hand, cutting through metal and leaving no room for doubt.</p><p>Kang Chong and Liu Jie could only nod in agreement.</p><p>However, Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang could not go down immediately.</p><p>As Lu Ming had transformed into an ancient God Body, he had used up a lot of energy and had not recovered yet.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged in the air. He took out a few divine pills and swallowed them. These divine pills could restore one’s strength extremely quickly.</p><p>If Lu Ming were to recover normally, he would need two days to recover his physical strength to its peak. However, with this divine pill, Lu Ming had recovered to his peak in just two hours.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang stepped out and floated down to the crack.</p><p>The two of them didn’t dare to be careless. They both activated their defensive divine skills, which covered their bodies.</p><p>Lu Ming activated the nine-layer Crimson Gold armor. A Crimson Gold armor covered his body.</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang’s body was enveloped by a Green Lotus.</p><p>The crack was very deep, and the two kept going down. The deeper they went, the bigger and wider the space below.</p><p>Squeak …</p><p>An ear-piercing scream suddenly came from the walls on both sides of the crack.</p><p>“Be careful …”</p><p>Lu Ming reminded.</p><p>Before Lu Ming could finish his sentence, the wall on one side suddenly exploded. A silver light slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Silver Planet Devourer!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed and he thrust his long spear forward.</p><p>The long spear was lost on the gold planet Devourer. However, Lu Ming had more than one long spear.</p><p>Before this, Lu Ming had already purchased several long Spears. They were all high-grade divine artifacts that were specially used by heavenly God-level powerhouses.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The spear collided with the silver Planet Devourer, creating a loud boom and forcing both parties to retreat.</p><p>“Song of the green Lotus sword!”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang seized the opportunity and charged over. Her sword Qi swept across and enveloped the silver Planet Devourer.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming conjured the divine Dragon materialization art. Two nine-clawed divine Dragons pounced at the silver Planet Devourer. At the same time, Lu Ming cast the three apocalyptic strikes at the silver Planet Devourer.</p><p>Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang joined forces. In addition, Lu Ming’s strength had increased a little. Very soon, they began to suppress the silver Planet Devourer.</p><p>Just as they were about to kill the silver Planet Devourer, another shrill scream came from not far away. Then, with another flash of silver light, another Silver Planet Devourer came at them.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang’s faces darkened.</p><p>There were two silver Planet devourers here.</p><p>The two of them could deal with one silver Planet Devourer, but it would be difficult to deal with two.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
