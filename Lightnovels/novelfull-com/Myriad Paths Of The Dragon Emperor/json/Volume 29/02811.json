When he found out, it was already a month later. It was Ouyang Qingxiang who told him.</p><p>One day, Ouyang Qingxiang found Lu Ming and told him the news.</p><p>the bronze gate of the ancient God Star has opened? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was very interested after hearing that.</p><p>The bronze door had appeared in the Holy Land of the descendants of the ancient gods, so it must have something to do with them. Lu Ming had condensed the heart of the ancient God, so he was very interested in it.</p><p>“That’s right. It was opened a month ago. I was also in seclusion. I just received the news that there is an ancient world inside with countless natural treasures. Many experts from all the major forces have entered. I’m looking for you because I want to join hands with you and go in together. What do you think?”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate and nodded in agreement.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming led an hai, Liu Chang, and Zhao Feng. Ouyang Xiangxiang led a group of experts from her faction. Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng were also in the group as they headed toward the ancient God Star.</p><p>After a long journey, they arrived at a place not far from the bronze gate of the ancient God Star.</p><p>Lu Ming was rather emotional when he came here again.</p><p>“So many experts!”</p><p>Lu Ming sensed that there was a terrifying aura looming around the bronze door.</p><p>Each of these auras was extremely powerful and gave off a pressure as deep as the ocean.</p><p>God King!</p><p>These auras were all divine kings, no less than a dozen of them.</p><p>There were dozens of Divine King experts gathered near the bronze door.</p><p>“Didn’t they say that most of the experts have already entered the world behind the bronze door? Why are there so many divine kings here?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“I’ve heard that it’s very hard for Divine King experts to enter the bronze door.”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang said.</p><p>“Oh? Godkings are not allowed to enter?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“It’s not that they can’t enter at all. It’s said that there’s another layer of energy above the bronze door that can stop divine kings from entering.”</p><p>“This power is extremely mysterious. Even the strongest group of formation Masters in the Qin heaven star region would not be able to break it. However, they managed to create a formation that can only send a dozen or so godkings into the bronze door.”</p><p>after some discussion, the Qin heaven thirteen clans, the ice Soul Clan, and the Scarlet Flame clan, a total of fifteen forces, will send one Godking in each.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang said.</p><p>Lu Ming finally understood. It turned out that the divine kings could not enter in large numbers. The fifteen strongest forces of the Qin heaven Star Zone had each sent one divine King in.</p><p>As for those below the God King realm, they could enter and leave as they pleased.</p><p>Lu Ming felt a little helpless. He had thought that after most of the people had entered the bronze door, he could take the opportunity to let QiuQiu bite the bronze door. Now, it seemed that this idea would not work.</p><p>With so many Divine King peerless experts guarding it, how could he have the chance to let QiuQiu bite the bronze door? if he really did that, QiuQiu would probably be taken away by those experts for research immediately.</p><p>it is said that the world behind the bronze door is vast and boundless. However, there are also terrifying dangers inside. There is an evil creature that lives inside. It’s like a demon and a devil at the same time. It’s called the demon.</p><p>now, every force has built a city inside as their base. The godkings are guarding the city against the demons.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang explained.</p><p>As they flew, they walked towards the bronze door.</p><p>No one stopped them. In fact, anyone below the God King realm would not be stopped if they wanted to enter. Even those from small factions would not be stopped.</p><p>However, without a Godking, it would be extremely dangerous for a faction that had built a city as a base to enter. There was a high chance that they would die at the hands of yaomo.</p><p>The huge bronze door was open, and it was pitch black inside.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang said, and the group flew toward the bronze door.</p><p>In addition to them, there were many other people from other forces. They flew into the gate with them.</p><p>After a moment of dizziness, Lu Ming realized that they had appeared on a huge platform.</p><p>Lu Ming looked up. There was a huge vortex in the sky above his head. This vortex was the entrance and the exit.</p><p>Lu Ming saw many people covered in blood. They rose into the air and disappeared into the vortex. They must have gone out from here.</p><p>these people should be from some small forces. They didn’t build a base here and didn’t have a God King. They were injured from fighting with the demons and had no place to recuperate, so they could only leave.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang explained.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Those who went out now should be people from small forces. For example, the Qin heaven thirteen clans, the ice Soul Clan, and the Scarlet Flame clan all had bases. If they were injured, they could recuperate in the bases and did not need to go out at all.</p><p>boundless sacred land, come to me. I’ll take you to the base …</p><p>people of the winged demon Academy, come to me. I’ll take you to the base …</p><p>people of Kong Xuan sect, come to me. I’ll bring you to the base …</p><p>Around the platform, voices rang out. It turned out that there were people from the major forces around the platform, while the people from the small forces could only watch in envy.</p><p>that’s the person from the Kong Xuan sect. Let’s go over …</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang and the others walked in one direction. There were many powerful cultivators from the Kong Xuan sect there.</p><p>“Holy maiden Qingxiang, Holy Son Lu Ming, come with me.”</p><p>One of the elders was an inner sect elder of the Kong Xuan sect. He recognized Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang at a glance.</p><p>The group followed the inner sect elder and flew away.</p><p>But at this moment, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>In the sky, the vortex shook violently and let out a deafening roar.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>why is the space gate suddenly shaking? ”</p><p>Many people’s expressions changed drastically.</p><p>But then, the vortex shook even more violently.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Then, there was a terrifying explosion. The vortex began to collapse.</p><p>That’s right, it started to collapse. A terrifying power spread out and wreaked havoc in all directions.</p><p>“Not good, quickly leave!”</p><p>“Quickly retreat!”</p><p>Many people shouted and flew around the platform.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest also left far away. When everyone had flown far enough, they turned back and were completely dumbfounded.</p><p>The vortex was gone!</p><p>That’s right, that vortex had already disappeared without a trace.</p><p>“The spatial path is gone.”</p><p>we’re doomed. Are we going to be trapped here forever? ”</p><p>what’s going on? does anyone know what’s going on? ”</p><p>The scene was in an uproar, and many people were shouting in fear.</p><p>Without the spatial path, they would be trapped here for the rest of their lives.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
