Some are third level celestial deities, and two are fourth level celestial deities.”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang said.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>“Holy maiden Qingxiang, can you help me distract those people? I’ll sneak into the cave.” Lu Ming’s eyes flickered.</p><p>it’s not a problem to lure those people away. However, Tianhong is very likely to be in that cave. There might be other experts in there. It will be very dangerous for you to go in.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang said.</p><p>I won’t be impulsive. I’ll sneak in and hide myself. I won’t expose myself if I’m not confident.</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright, let’s do that.”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang was also a decisive person. She immediately nodded and the two of them approached the cave.</p><p>The cave was very big and dark, so he couldn’t see what was inside.</p><p>Outside the cave, there were more than a dozen people who looked listless.</p><p>There were no other living beings here at all. They were only guarding this place just in case.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, Ouyang Xiangxiang immediately rushed out.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Immediately, an old man shouted.</p><p>“It’s Holy maiden Qingxiang!”</p><p>“She wants to enter the ruins. Stop her.”</p><p>The guards roared and charged toward Ouyang Qingxiang.</p><p>Over a dozen people, half of them were celestial deity realm. There were even two fourth level celestial deities, their combat strength very strong.</p><p>However, Ouyang Qingxiang was a saintess. She had control over Saint grade divine power and was extremely powerful. She easily blocked the attacks of these people.</p><p>“Go and report to the Saint that Ouyang Qingxiang is here.”</p><p>“I’ll go!”</p><p>An elder immediately rushed into the cave and disappeared. The rest of the people focused on dealing with Ouyang Qingxiang.</p><p>Seizing the opportunity, Lu Ming quickly flashed along the ground, using the obstacles on the ground to hide his figure. The other party did not notice him.</p><p>Lu Ming successfully rushed into the cave.</p><p>The cave was dark and deep. Lu Ming slid down slowly along the wall of the cave.</p><p>After sliding down for tens of thousands of meters, he finally reached the bottom of the cave.</p><p>At the bottom of the cave, there was a passage that was a few thousand meters high. It was huge, and the walls were inlaid with some luminous stones that emitted a faint glow.</p><p>Lu Ming dashed into the passage and kept moving forward.</p><p>“There’s someone!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming had an idea. He quickly hid in a groove on the wall.</p><p>The walls of the tunnel were uneven. Some of them were protruding while others were sunken. It was easy to hide.</p><p>After hiding themselves, a few figures flashed through the passage.</p><p>Lu Ming could clearly see that they were a few elders. They must have gone to support Ouyang Qingxiang. They were in a hurry and did not notice Lu Ming.</p><p>After the few elders left, Lu Ming continued to walk forward in the passage.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming passed through the passageway and came to a huge underground space.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>After Lu Ming arrived, he was stunned.</p><p>The underground space was extremely vast. At the very front, there was a huge stone staircase that was 10000 meters tall. Above the staircase was a Palace that looked like the legendary dragon Palace.</p><p>At the bottom of the stairs, there were a few figures standing.</p><p>Lu Ming saw at a glance that one of them was the Tian Hong Saint son.</p><p>The other two people were two old men.</p><p>the two of you, go out together and take down that b * tch, Ouyang Qingxiang.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son’s cold voice was heard.</p><p>“But Saint, once we leave, you’ll be the only one left.”</p><p>An old man said hesitantly.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter. I’m about to climb the sacred Dragon’s stairs. On the sacred Dragon’s stairs, no matter who it is, they will be under terrifying pressure and will be protected. No one who enters will be able to hurt me. You can put it down!”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son waved his hand.</p><p>“Alright, then we’ll be going out!”</p><p>The two old men nodded. Then, their figures flashed and they rushed outside.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son’s eyes were burning with desire as he looked at the stairs.</p><p>“I don’t believe that I can’t climb up. I can definitely.”</p><p>The Tianhong Saint son growled. His body swelled up and transformed into the form of the Dragonman race. Golden divine power emanated from his body. He stepped onto the stairs.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>When the Tianhong Saint son stepped onto the stairs, there was a huge boom, as if a mountain had fallen to the ground.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son landed steadily on the first step and stepped up to the second.</p><p>Every step he took caused the stairs to rumble. It was as if every step he took was extremely heavy.</p><p>there is indeed a powerful pressure on the stairs.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>He took a look and understood what was going on.</p><p>He had encountered this type of test many times.</p><p>The Tianhong Saint son was very fast at first. Soon, he had covered half the distance and started to slow down.</p><p>It was obvious that the more he advanced, the greater the pressure he felt.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Dragon roars came from the Tian Hong Saint son’s body. The Golden Dragon scales on his body glowed even more brightly. His eyes were determined as he slowly climbed up.</p><p>Unfortunately, after walking for a while, the Tian Hong Saint son’s figure almost stopped.</p><p>I don’t believe it. I don’t believe I can’t make it. My dragon blood, boil!</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son roared. Blood-red light covered his body, and a six-clawed Divine Dragon appeared above his head.</p><p>He had even used the divine Dragon phenomenon, which allowed the Tianhong Saint son to continue moving up. Unfortunately, when he was two-thirds up the stairs, he stopped completely and could not take another step.</p><p>“Damn it, why? Is my Divine Dragon bloodline not strong enough? Why?”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son roared angrily. He was extremely unwilling.</p><p>is there the complete divine Dragon materialization technique on it? ”</p><p>Lu Ming made a guess.</p><p>Since the Tianhong Saint son wanted to climb the stairs so badly, it was very likely that the complete divine Dragon materialization art was on it.</p><p>“Come closer!”</p><p>Lu Ming followed the obstacles at the side and slowly approached the stairs. He was getting closer and closer to the palace above the stairs.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming actually felt that his blood was slowly boiling. At the same time, there was a kind of desire.</p><p>Yes, it was a desire, a feeling that appeared in his blood.</p><p>It was as if there was something on the stairs that deeply attracted Lu Ming.</p><p>“I must go to the top of the palace!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. His eyes were firm as he made a decision.</p><p>There was a strong pressure on the stairs. The others seemed to be unable to go up. The Tian Hong Saint son was on top and had no power to attack. Lu Ming was not afraid.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
