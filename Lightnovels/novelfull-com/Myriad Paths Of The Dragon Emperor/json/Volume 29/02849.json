Lu Ming succeeded.</p><p>“Hahaha, the ancestor’s soul has come out.”</p><p>the ancient ancestor sealed the soul of the ancestor in order to save our clan when we were in danger. Now, it has finally appeared.</p><p>The ten clan patriarchs were all overjoyed. At the same time, they were also secretly rejoicing.</p><p>The ancient God’s soul was sealed by the Almighties of the ancient God’s descendants to prevent the ancient God clan from facing a great calamity in the future.</p><p>However, the talents of the ancient God clan had withered up until now. No one could break the seal. If not for Lu Ming, they would not have been able to release the soul of the ancient God even if they had it.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The soul of the ancient God stepped on the ground. With every step, the ground rumbled as he walked out.</p><p>This also alarmed the people of the ancient gods tribe.</p><p>what’s going on? why is there such a violent tremor coming from the depths of the tribe? ”</p><p>“Could it be that something has happened in the depths of the tribe?”</p><p>Many of the descendants of the ancient gods started to panic.</p><p>don’t worry.

He waited there with peace of mind.</p><p>As for the ancient God Soul, step by step, it was not far from the first tribe.</p><p>“Great formation, activate!”</p><p>The ten clan patriarchs started to activate the formation at the same time. The formation gave off endless light and finally condensed into an ancient God’s shadow. This ancient God’s shadow turned into a rainbow light and flew towards the ancient God’s soul. In the end, it entered the glabella of the ancient God’s soul and disappeared.</p><p>“Ancient God Soul, kill!”</p><p>The first tribe’s master shouted. They took control of the formation, and then the ancient God’s soul rose into the air and stepped out of the first tribe.</p><p>“That is … Ancient God?”</p><p>The descendants of the ancient God clan were all shocked.
