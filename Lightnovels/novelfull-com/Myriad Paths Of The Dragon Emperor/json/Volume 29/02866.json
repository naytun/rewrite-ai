She was completely suppressed by the planet Devourer behind her, and her situation was precarious.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The silver Planet Devourer’s claw cut through Ouyang Qingxiang’s protective Green Lotus and almost cut her in half. Although she managed to avoid it, a bloody gash still appeared on her body, and she was bleeding.</p><p>“This is bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>But now, he was being held back by a Silver Planet Devourer and could only protect himself. It was almost impossible to save him.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang was injured and her situation was even more dangerous. She was forced to retreat by a northern bank planet Devourer.</p><p>“Green Lotus awakens!”</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang’s eyes were filled with determination as she shouted. Her body emitted a blinding radiance as boundless sword Qi gathered into a huge Green Lotus that enveloped her.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The silver Planet Devourer’s sharp claws slashed at the green Lotus. The green Lotus trembled and sparks flew, but it was still blocked.</p><p>However, the silver Planet Devourer attacked crazily. Its two sharp claws were like lightning, slashing out hundreds of attacks in an instant. The green Lotus around Ouyang Qingxiang’s body trembled more and more violently. If this continued, it would not be able to hold out for long.</p><p>“What do we do?”</p><p>As Lu Ming fought with the silver Planet Devourer, he quickly thought of a countermeasure.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang definitely wouldn’t be able to hold on for too long. If this continued, her defeat was only a matter of time.</p><p>Now, there was only one path before Lu Ming, and that was to burn his ancient God heart.</p><p>By burning the ancient God’s heart, Lu Ming’s strength would definitely soar, but the consequences would also be very serious.</p><p>After the ancient God’s heart was burned, it would be reduced to nothing. It was even hard to say if Lu Ming could still transform into an ancient God Body in the future.</p><p>It was possible that if the ancient God’s heart was burned, he would not be able to transform his ancient God Body in the future. That would be a great loss to Lu Ming.</p><p>However, if she didn’t burn her ancient God heart, Ouyang Qingxiang would most likely die Here.</p><p>Lu Ming was a little hesitant.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The silver Planet Devourer’s attacks landed on Ouyang Qingxiang’s Green Lotus flower, causing it to shake more and more violently.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Finally, a crack appeared on the green Lotus, and the number of cracks increased rapidly.</p><p>“I don’t care!”</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth. He could not leave them to die in such a situation. He decided to start burning his ancient God heart.</p><p>However, at this moment, the green Lotus around Ouyang Qingxiang exploded with a loud bang. At the same time, a powerful aura burst out.</p><p>Without a doubt, this aura belonged to Ouyang Qingxiang. However, it was much stronger than before.</p><p>“This is … Fifth level heavenly deity!”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>At the moment of crisis, Ouyang Qingxiang actually broke through, breaking through to the fifth level celestial deity in one go.</p><p>In the celestial deity realm, the gap between each level was huge. Every breakthrough of a level would increase one’s battle strength by a large margin.</p><p>Furthermore, for a genius like Ouyang Qingxiang, the power of her secret skills and divine skills had also increased sharply.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A green sword Qi bloomed from Ouyang Qingxiang’s hand and slashed toward the silver Planet Devourer.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Sparks flew in all directions as the silver Planet Devourer was sent flying by Ouyang Xiangxiang’s slash. It crashed into a wall, and gravel flew everywhere.</p><p>“Green Lotus Sword Song, kill!”</p><p>die! Ouyang Qingxiang shouted. A bright sword light exploded and slashed at the silver Devourer.</p><p>When she was at the fourth-level celestial deity realm, Ouyang Qingxiang’s strength was not as good as the silver Planet Devourer. However, after her breakthrough, her strength was completely above the silver Planet Devourer and even Lu Ming.</p><p>The sword light enveloped the silver Planet Devourer.</p><p>The situation was completely different from before. Previously, Ouyang Qingxiang was at a disadvantage against the silver Planet Devourer, but now, Ouyang Qingxiang was completely suppressing the silver Planet Devourer.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>The sword light and the silver Planet Devourer kept colliding. After dozens of collisions, Ouyang Qingxiang seized the opportunity and cut open the silver Planet Devourer’s abdomen with one strike, severely injuring it.</p><p>Then, a ray of sword light swept out and killed the silver Planet Devourer.</p><p>After killing the opponent, Ouyang Xiangxiang rushed toward Lu Ming and the silver Planet Devourer that Lu Ming was fighting. The two of them joined forces and naturally crushed the planet Devourer. After a few moves, they killed the other party.</p><p>Then, he put away the two silver Planet devourers ‘heads.</p><p>Holy maiden Qingxiang, you’re amazing. You managed to break through at the critical moment.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>I was lucky this time. I had no choice but to risk my life just now, but I didn’t expect to succeed.</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang smiled.</p><p>With Ouyang Xiangxiang’s breakthrough, they were more confident. As long as they did not encounter too many Silver Planet devourers at once, they had nothing to fear.</p><p>Hence, they slowly descended again.</p><p>After that, they didn’t encounter a single planet Devourer. It seemed like the two silver Planet devourers from before were all the planet devourers.</p><p>Not long after, the two of them finally arrived at the crack.</p><p>There was a huge underground space under the crack. It was very spacious and there were many passages leading in all directions.</p><p>On the other side of the space, they saw the gold planet Devourer.</p><p>It was the one that they had injured earlier. The long spear that Lu Ming had stabbed the Devourer with had been pulled out and thrown aside.</p><p>Its wound had already stopped bleeding, but its breathing was still very weak.</p><p>In Lu Ming’s previous move, the divine power had exploded directly in its body, blowing up the internal organs of the gold planet Devourer. If it had not been for its strong vitality, it would have died.</p><p>Squeak …</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang, the gold planet Devourer let out a sharp cry. Its eyes were filled with hatred and cold killing intent.</p><p>Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang slowly approached the gold planet Devourer, ready to launch a fatal blow.</p><p>Squeak …</p><p>At this moment, a sharp cry was heard from one of the side passages. Then, Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang saw a huge planet Devourer crawling out.</p><p>This planet Devourer was also golden in color.</p><p>It was another gold-grade planet Devourer, and this one looked like it was in its best condition and was not injured.</p><p>Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang’s expressions changed drastically.</p><p>Even if Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang joined forces, they would not be a match for the Golden Devourer at its peak.</p><p>“Not good, we’re retreating!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Ouyang Qingxiang. The two of them soared into the sky, planning to leave this place.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
