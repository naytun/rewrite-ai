The three nine-clawed divine Dragons suddenly exploded and formed a terrifying wave of energy. The Supreme Vajra, which was transformed by the Supreme Holy Son, was pushed back continuously.</p><p>Lu Ming took the opportunity to break out of the encirclement and charged toward Ouyang Qingxiang.</p><p>At that moment, Ouyang Xiangxiang was fully focused on defense. Green Lotus flowers floated around her to block the attacks from the outside, but she was still in a precarious situation.</p><p>This was because there was an existence stronger than Ouyang Xiangxiang in the unique demon Academy. Even if Ouyang Xiangxiang focused on defense, she would still be in great danger.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had arrived. The long spear pressed down, turning into a dozen huge spear shadows that pressed down like a mountain range.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The spear radiance pressed down, emitting a terrifying vibration.</p><p>The expressions of the floating light Holy Son, Zhi Xia Holy Son, Yan Kong Holy Son, Xue Tan Holy maiden, and the six Holy Sons and holy virgins of the unique demon Academy all changed. Then, with a long roar, each of them burst out with their strongest attack, blasting toward Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying tremor erupted, and then more than ten figures retreated.</p><p>The sacred son of reflection and the other top ten experts were forced back by Lu Ming’s attack. They were at least 100 meters away. Some of them with weaker cultivations even trembled and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“How terrifying!”</p><p>The same thought emerged in their hearts.</p><p>They were also Saints, but even with so many of them joining forces, they were still repelled by Lu Ming in one move. Some of them were even injured. Lu Ming’s strength shocked them.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming rushed past her. A stream of divine power wrapped around Ouyang Xiangxiang and they ran forward madly.</p><p>“Where are you going?”</p><p>“Chase!”</p><p>Universe master and four eyes void court shouted and chased after Lu Ming, followed by the others.</p><p>The two sides, one chasing and one escaping, covered thousands of miles in the blink of an eye.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s speed was even faster. He was like a flying ROC, and the distance between him and universe master, four-eye void, and the others was constantly widening.</p><p>“Damn it …”</p><p>Supreme universe bellowed. The killing intent in his heart was already incomparably thick.</p><p>Lu Ming had to die. Otherwise, the fact that he had joined forces with the people from the unique demon Academy to kill Lu Ming would definitely be exposed. By then, even if he had someone to protect him, he would never be able to stand out in the Kong Xuan sect. He would be spurned by everyone.</p><p>Therefore, he had to kill Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang.</p><p>“Don’t worry, just let him run in this direction!”</p><p>His four eyes were empty, but his face was calm.</p><p>“Don’t tell me it’s in that direction …”</p><p>Supreme universe seemed to have thought of something, and his eyes lit up.</p><p>that’s right. Mo jiuye is coming from that direction. If he runs in that direction, he’ll be walking right into a trap. So, we just have to keep chasing him and let him run forward.</p><p>Four-eyed Kong ting sneered.</p><p>“That’s great!”</p><p>Paragon universe was overjoyed.</p><p>Of course, their conversation was transmitted to Lu Ming for fear that he would overhear it.</p><p>The chase continued for another half an hour. The distance between the two parties had widened. Supreme universe and the rest could barely see Lu Ming’s figure.</p><p>“Not good. Lu Ming, stop!”</p><p>At this time, bone’s voice echoed.</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he could not help but stop.</p><p>“There’s an expert in front of us, and he’s coming at a high speed. This person’s cultivation is extremely strong, and you’re definitely not his match. He’s so fast, he’s almost here. Quickly change direction.”</p><p>Bone demon shouted, somewhat anxious.</p><p>“Could it be mo jiuye?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. The first person he thought of was mo jiuye.</p><p>Since simu kongting and the others had appeared, mo jiuye was most likely on this planet as well.</p><p>Without thinking, Lu Ming immediately changed his direction and dashed to the left.</p><p>“Damn it, why did he change direction? Could he have already discovered mo jiuye? Chase!”</p><p>The four-eyed void beast roared in anger and chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Lu Ming had just changed his direction. After running for a short while, he sensed a terrifying aura coming from the direction he came from.</p><p>The speed of the aura was shocking. When it first appeared, it was still very far away, but in a few breaths, it was not far away.</p><p>“It’s mo jiuye indeed!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across and he saw mo jiuye’s figure.</p><p>A layer of black light appeared around mo jiuye’s body, making him look like a dark cloud. He chased after Lu Ming at an astonishing speed.</p><p>Its speed was even faster than Lu Ming’s.</p><p>The distance between him and Lu Ming was closing.</p><p>In the beginning, the two sides were still separated by several thousand li, but soon, the distance between the two sides was less than a thousand li.</p><p>After running for a while more, the distance between the two sides was reduced to less than three hundred miles.</p><p>If this continued, Lu Ming would be caught up to very soon.</p><p>“Lu Ming, die!”</p><p>Mo jiuye’s cold voice was heard. The black light around his body surged and turned into a pitch-black Claw. It crossed a distance of hundreds of miles and grabbed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Divine Dragon phenomenon!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast the divine Dragon materialization art and three huge nine-clawed divine Dragons condensed and pounced towards mo jiuye’s claws.</p><p>“Small tricks, break!”</p><p>die! mo jiuye shouted coldly as his pitch-black claws swiped down.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>With three loud bangs, the three nine-clawed divine Dragons were shattered. They could not stop Lu Ming at all. The black claws continued to claw at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. He turned around and attacked with all his might.</p><p>Lu Ming cast the second move of the three apocalyptic strikes, moon-cutting.</p><p>He held the spear with both hands and swung it down with all his might. A crescent-shaped spearlight blasted towards the pitch-black Claw. When the crescent-shaped spearlight struck the pitch-black Claw, a violent boom was heard. The crescent-shaped spearlight trembled continuously before it exploded.</p><p>Lu Ming felt an extremely powerful force surging towards him from his spear. His body trembled and his huge body retreated frantically.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming spat out a mouthful of blood. Furthermore, he felt a jet-black energy covering his body. It had a terrifying corrosive power that was about to corrode his body.</p><p>“What terrifying divine power!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was grave. The six divine flames in his body circulated at full force. Divine power rushed to the surface of his body continuously to block the divine power.</p><p>The divine power that mo jiuye controlled was a divine-grade divine power, and it was shockingly powerful.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop. He ran forward while resisting the divine power.</p><p>“You have some strength, but it’s not enough. Kill!”</p><p>die! mo jiuye shouted coldly and attacked again.</p><p>Lu Ming ran while blocking the attacks.</p><p>Mo jiuye’s strength was truly shocking.</p><p>Lu Ming could already sense that mo jiuye’s cultivation was at the sixth-level celestial deity realm. However, he controlled divine-grade divine energy and was much stronger than Supreme universe and four-eye void. Lu Ming was no match for him at all.</p><p>Even if it was a long-distance attack, the power was still extremely shocking.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
