Its strength was too shocking. In addition, it was extremely fast. It could kill ordinary divine kings as if they were vegetables.</p><p>In a short period of time, ten demonic Devil Kings and five godkings of the Qin heaven star region were killed by the ancient God Soul. Their battle results could be said to be brilliant.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The soul of the ancient God attacked another god King.</p><p>This person was the Godking of the ice Soul Clan.</p><p>“I’m going to die!”</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s Godking roared in his heart, thinking that he was dead for sure.</p><p>However, when the soul of the ancient God arrived in front of him, it didn’t continue to attack. Instead, it glanced at him coldly and rushed past him. Then, it attacked the godly King of the red flame tribe and killed him in a few moves.</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s Godking had escaped death. He was on the verge of collapse, but he was also very confused.</p><p>“Why didn’t the ancient God Soul kill me? Strange. Forget it, let’s retreat with our clansmen first.”</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s Godking rejoiced inwardly. He then led some of the ice Soul Clan members and quickly left the place. They fled in the direction of the base they had built when they came.</p><p>Naturally, he did not know that the ancient God Soul did not kill him because of Lu Ming.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had given the images of some people he wanted to protect to the ten clan chiefs. The ten clan chiefs controlled the ancient God’s soul and could see what the ancient God’s soul saw.</p><p>The divine King of the ice Soul Clan was one of the images that Lu Ming had depicted. That was why the ancient God’s soul had let him go and did not kill him.</p><p>“Kill, kill our way out, kill all the demons and devils!”</p><p>At that moment, an elder from the first tribe shouted.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Following that, the ancient God descendants ‘Army swarmed out and attacked the troops of the monster race and demon race.</p><p>At this moment, the troops of the monster race and demon race were defeated like a landslide. They had no power to resist and were fleeing in all directions. Not long after, the troops of the descendants of the ancient gods caught up to them and started killing them.</p><p>The godkings of the ten great tribes also worked with the ancient God Soul to kill the demonic Devil Kings, the godkings of the Qin heaven star system.</p><p>This was a massacre that lasted for half a day before it came to an end.</p><p>As the ancient God’s soul was too far away from the first tribe, it was difficult for the ten patriarchs to control it, so they stopped the pursuit.</p><p>The Army of the ancient gods tribe returned to the capital.</p><p>The first tribe was in a sea of cheers.</p><p>This battle could be said to be glorious as more than 20 demons and devils were killed.</p><p>One had to know that all the demons and Devil Kings in the northern desolate demon Plains added up to around forty. With more than half of them dead, the demons and devils were greatly weakened and were no longer a match for the descendants of the ancient gods.</p><p>Over ten of the godkings from the Qin heaven star region had died.</p><p>The rest had all escaped.</p><p>When Lu Ming walked out of the forsaken land, the first tribe was in a celebratory mood.</p><p>“It seems like we’ve won.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>After that, the clan leaders of the ten great tribes met Lu Ming and expressed their gratitude. They even gave him a pile of heavenly materials and earthly treasures. There were many ancient God flowers among them, which Lu Ming accepted without any hesitation.</p><p>Not long after, the armies of the other tribes started to return to their own tribes.</p><p>Lu Ming followed the eighth tribe and returned to the eighth tribe.</p><p>The demons and devils of the eighth tribe and the experts of the Qin heaven Starfield had left long ago.</p><p>The eighth tribe was in a state of loaning. All of their treasures had been plundered. Even the blood pond had been taken in, and the blood pond had almost dried up.</p><p>someone has entered the blood pool to awaken the ancient God Body.</p><p>The chief of the eighth tribe frowned.</p><p>“He can awaken the ancient God Body even if he’s not a descendant of an ancient God?” Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>However, Lu Ming immediately thought of himself.</p><p>He wasn’t a descendant of an ancient God. After a series of opportunities, he had awakened an ancient God Body of a shockingly high level.</p><p>yes, but it’s very difficult. Talent, willpower, and luck are all indispensable.</p><p>The leader of the eighth tribe nodded.</p><p>Then, he gave the order to sort out the eighth tribe.</p><p>Lu Ming stayed in the eighth tribe for another ten days.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming bade farewell to the clan leader of the eighth tribe.</p><p>After all, he did not belong here. Sooner or later, he would have to leave.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ve been working hard to guard the clan and the gate to this world. If there’s an opportunity in the future, you can send some geniuses here to cultivate.”</p><p>The eighth clan leader said.</p><p>“Alright, thank you, chief.”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He wondered if the eighth patriarch would kill him with a slap if he knew that he was not a descendant of an ancient God.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming bade farewell to Gu Ming, Gu Hongshan, and the rest. Then, he headed in the direction where they had first entered this world alone.</p><p>Lu Ming returned to the ice Soul clan’s base after half a month without any trouble.</p><p>Here, another base had been built.</p><p>The ice Soul Clan was guarding this place.</p><p>During this period of time, the ten large tribes of the descendants of the ancient gods didn’t pursue the experts of the Qin heaven star system. During this period of time, the armies of the ten large tribes headed north and were fighting with the remnants of the demonic forces.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Someone shouted as soon as Lu Ming approached.</p><p>It was a critical period, so the ice Soul Clan was naturally on high alert.</p><p>“It’s me, Lu Ming. I want to see your ninth young master.”</p><p>Lu Ming said loudly.</p><p>“It’s you, young master Lu Ming!”</p><p>The ice Soul Clan members recognized Lu Ming.</p><p>wait a moment. We’ll report this to the ninth young master.</p><p>Someone from the ice Soul Clan went in to report. Soon, Bing Qing flew out with some people.</p><p>Seeing that bingqing was fine, Lu Ming was slightly relieved.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re alright. That’s great!”</p><p>When Bing Qing saw Lu Ming, she was also delighted.</p><p>“Brother Bing, how have you guys been all these years …”</p><p>Lu Ming and Bing Qing entered the base and started chatting.</p><p>After the chat, Lu Ming more or less knew about bingqing’s experiences over the years.</p><p>Back then, after they were scattered, Bing Qing followed a few experts of the ice Soul Clan and hid in the forest. Later, they were summoned by the ice Soul clan’s Godking and gathered together to act in secret. Later, they joined in the attack on the ancient God descendant. After they were defeated, Lu Ming escaped here and had been on guard.</p><p>the major forces in the Qin heaven star realm suffered heavy losses in the siege of the ancient God descendant this time. There are 15 forces and a total of 15 godkings. A total of 10 died in battle and only five survived. Fortunately, the Godking of my ice Soul Race is still alive. We’re really lucky!</p><p>Bing Qing sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He knew it clearly in his heart and did not say much.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming learned that the godkings of the unique demon Academy, the immortal sword sect, and the Scarlet Flame tribe were all dead.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered in his heart. This was just collecting some interest. Lu Ming would not let go of their past grudges.</p><p>” however, although the factions suffered heavy losses this time, the survivors also gained a lot. Many of them attacked the ancient God descendant tribes and obtained great opportunities.   the ancient God Emperor continued.</p><p>Bingqing said.</p><p>“A great opportunity?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>yes, some people are so lucky that they have cultivated the ancient God’s descendant’s Secret technique, the ancient God Body. Once they use it, they can transform into the ancient God’s body and their power will increase greatly.</p><p>Bing Qing explained, her eyes filled with envy.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
