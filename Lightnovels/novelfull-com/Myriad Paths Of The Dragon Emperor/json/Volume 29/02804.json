You don’t have the blood of the divine Dragon. Even if I give it to you, you won’t be able to cultivate it.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son said.</p><p>you don’t have to worry about that. You just have to give me the divine Dragon materialization technique.</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son gritted his teeth. In the end, he had no choice. His palm glowed and a scroll appeared.</p><p>“Here you go …”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son waved his hand, and the scroll flew out with a terrifying howl. Needless to say, the scroll contained terrifying power.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang’s figure flashed as she caught the scroll. She came to Lu Ming’s side and passed it to him.</p><p>“Many thanks!”</p><p>Lu Ming thanked him and took the scroll. He opened it and read it.</p><p>Lu Ming’s face darkened after he took a look. He looked at the Tian Hong Saint son coldly and said, ” the divine Dragon materialization art you gave me is incomplete. Do you want to go back on your word? ”</p><p>Although he had never come into contact with the divine Dragon materialization art, he could still tell whether a secret art was complete or not.</p><p>the divine Dragon materialization art I obtained was incomplete. Otherwise, how could you stop me? ”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son said coldly.</p><p>Tianhong, if you want to go back on your word, just say it. There’s no need to find such an excuse!</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a mocking expression.</p><p>I’ve said that the divine Dragon materialization technique I obtained is incomplete. Don’t you understand? ”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son’s face turned even uglier.</p><p>“Lu Ming, that’s true. I’ve heard before that Tianhong’s Divine Dragon materialization technique was obtained from an ancient relic. It’s indeed incomplete.”</p><p>At this moment, Ouyang Qingxiang spoke.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. It seemed that the Tian Hong Saint son was not lying.</p><p>“Hmph, let’s go!”</p><p>In the air, the Tian Hong Saint son snorted, waved his sleeves, and turned to leave.</p><p>Today, he had really suffered a great loss.</p><p>Not only did he fail to kill Lu Ming, but he also lost a Divine Dragon materialization technique.</p><p>In his heart, he had already put Lu Ming on his must-kill list.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son and his people left in dejection.</p><p>“Holy maiden Qingxiang, thank you for saving me this time.”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists at Ouyang Qingxiang to express his gratitude.</p><p>This time, without Ouyang Qingxiang, he would not have had the chance to gamble with the Tian Hong Saint son.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son had agreed to the bet because he could not take down Ouyang Qingxiang in a short time.</p><p>“You’re welcome. This time, it’s all on you.”</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang’s beautiful eyes flickered. She was even more curious about Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was only at the third stage true God Realm, but he could actually take a blow from the Tian Hong Saint son and not die.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son’s cultivation base was at the peak of the fourth-level heavenly God Realm.</p><p>by the way, saintess Qingxiang, why does the divine Dragon Dharma form that the Tian Hong Saint son condensed have six dragon claws? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked the question in his heart.</p><p>that’s a six-clawed Divine Dragon. Don’t tell me you don’t even know that? ”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang said.</p><p>“A six-clawed Divine Dragon? Well, I don’t really know much about the dragon clan.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled awkwardly.</p><p>in the dragon clan, the most ordinary dragon clan has five dragon claws. The dragon clan of a higher grade has six or even seven dragon claws …</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang explained.</p><p>“Six dragon claws? seven dragon claws? Isn’t it because of the mutation?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>“Mutation? The more dragon claws a Dragon has, the purer their bloodline is, the higher their level, and the more powerful they are.”</p><p>in the dragon clan, most of the divine Dragons are five-clawed divine Dragons, and six-clawed divine Dragons are already high-level divine Dragons. There are very few of them. The more there are, the more talented and powerful they are, and the fewer they are. I heard that the highest-level Divine Dragon in the dragon clan has nine claws and is called the nine-clawed Divine Dragon. It is extremely terrifying.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang explained.</p><p>so it’s like this, it’s like this. It seems that my understanding of the Dragon race was wrong.</p><p>Lu Ming mumbled to himself and came to a sudden realization.</p><p>In the past, in the heaven realm and the primordial realm, all true dragons were five-clawed, so the occasional six-clawed or even nine-clawed Dragon was thought to be a mutation.</p><p>In fact, that was not the case. The more dragon claws there were, it was not a mutation. It just meant that the ancient bloodline in the Dragon claws was thicker.</p><p>it seems that the nine Dragons aren’t mutated. It’s just the manifestation of the ancient bloodline in their bodies that has reached an extreme level. What a pity, what a pity …</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>It was a pity that Jiulong was born in the heaven realm, a small chiliocosm. His talent might not have been fully activated.</p><p>The nine-clawed Divine Dragon was the highest level of Divine Dragon in the primeval universe. If the nine Dragons were born in the primeval universe, their achievements would be limitless.</p><p>“Lu Ming, if you’re interested in the dragon clan, you can look for some related books to read. These are common knowledge in the prehistoric universe.”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang said.</p><p>“Alright,” he said. Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>However, he thought to himself,”I’m afraid common sense is not necessarily the case. In a place like the chaotic astral River, I’m afraid that the understanding of the dragon clan is very limited.</p><p>Otherwise, the ancestor of technique and even the ancestral Dragon would have known about the origins of the nine Dragons. They all thought that the nine Dragons were the mutants of the true dragons.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming, Ouyang Qingxiang, Yue Linglong, and Wu Zifeng all left the place.</p><p>Lu Ming first went to an Hai’s residence to help him and the rest heal.</p><p>A few days later, when an hai and the others ‘injuries were no longer a problem, Lu Ming returned to his residence to cultivate and heal his injuries.</p><p>He had taken the Tian Hong Saint son’s attack head-on and had been severely injured. It took him half a month to recover.</p><p>After his injuries were healed, Lu Ming took out the secret technique, Divine Dragon materialization technique, and read it in detail.</p><p>The divine Dragon materialization technique was extremely mysterious. After successfully cultivating it, one could condense the divine Dragon materialization when they circulated it. Its power was extremely shocking.</p><p>Moreover, the strength of the divine Dragon phenomenon that was cultivated had a lot to do with the concentration of the divine dragon’s bloodline in the cultivator’s body.</p><p>The higher and purer the bloodline, the more terrifying the power of the divine Dragon phenomenon cultivated would be.</p><p>After a few days, Lu Ming had almost figured out the divine Dragon materialization art. He then cultivated it according to the records on it. Unexpectedly, Lu Ming’s cultivation was extremely smooth and without any difficulty.</p><p>In just half a month, Lu Ming had successfully cultivated it.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged in the courtyard and circulated the divine Dragon materialization technique. A Dragon’s Roar came from his body, and a Divine Dragon condensed above his head.</p><p>This Divine Dragon was only a few meters long. The size of the divine Dragon phenomenon could be controlled at will. Lu Ming could also change the divine Dragon phenomenon to tens of thousands of meters long.</p><p>What was shocking was that it had eight dragon claws on its abdomen.</p><p>It was an eight-clawed Divine Dragon.</p><p>The Tianhong Saint son had only cultivated a six-clawed Divine Dragon Dharma power, while Lu Ming had cultivated an eight-clawed Divine Dragon Dharma power.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not satisfied. He frowned slightly.</p><p>The divine Dragon phenomenon that he had cultivated was supposed to be a nine-clawed Divine Dragon.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
