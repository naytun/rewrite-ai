If it was complete, I would definitely be able to cultivate the nine-clawed Divine Dragon phenomenon. I might even be able to cultivate more than one, two, three, four, or even more.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart. He was extremely eager for the complete divine Dragon materialization art.</p><p>Think about it, once he made a move, he could directly condense dozens of divine Dragons. How amazing would his power be?</p><p>The divine Dragon materialization art was simply too suitable for him.</p><p>There was no doubt that condensing the divine Dragon phenomenon would consume a lot of divine power. However, Lu Ming cultivated the universal Dao mantra and could cultivate many divine flames. His divine power was much stronger than others.</p><p>Also, he had the quantity formula and did not have to worry about not having enough Shen power.</p><p>the Tianhong Saint son’s Divine Dragon materialization technique was obtained from an ancient relic. Does that relic have a complete divine Dragon phenomenon? ”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered. He really wanted to obtain the complete divine Dragon phenomenon. Once he obtained it, his combat strength would be greatly improved.</p><p>go and ask Ouyang Qingxiang. Let’s see if she understands.</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming left the courtyard and headed to Ouyang Qingxiang’s residence.</p><p>The place where the saintess lived was naturally extraordinary. It occupied an entire mountain peak and was guarded.</p><p>how impressive. Unfortunately, there are too few people who came to me. Otherwise, I could also apply for a mountain to live on.</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>Of course, he only had two or three subordinates now. It would be a joke if he applied for a mountain with no one living in it.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>When Lu Ming came to the front of the mountain peak, he was blocked by a few young women.</p><p>However, when the few young women saw Lu Ming’s appearance clearly, they revealed looks of admiration.</p><p>“Holy Son Lu Ming, it’s you!”</p><p>“Holy Son Lu Ming, are you here to see our Holy maiden?“</p><p>A few young and beautiful women blinked their big eyes and sized Lu Ming up curiously.</p><p>Lu Ming had only joined the sect for a few decades and had become the Holy Son with his true God-level cultivation. He was simply a legend in the Kong Xuan sect. Since ancient times, beauties loved heroes. Naturally, they were curious and worshiped him.</p><p>yes, I’m here to see Holy maiden Qingxiang. I’ll have to trouble you to inform her!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Alright. Please wait a moment, Holy Son Lu Ming.”</p><p>Immediately, a young woman flew towards the mountain peak. After a while, a few figures flew out. The person in the lead was Ouyang Xiangxiang.</p><p>“Lu Ming, why are you looking for me today? Come, please come in!”</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang smiled and flew toward the peak with Lu Ming. They arrived at a Pavilion and sat opposite each other.</p><p>I’m here today to ask about Tianhong’s Divine Dragon materialization technique. Saintess Qingxiang said that Tianhong’s Divine Dragon materialization technique came from an ancient ruin. I wonder where that ruin is? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>it seems that brother Lu has remembered the complete divine Dragon materialization technique. However, if you want to cultivate it, you need a rich Divine Dragon bloodline. Otherwise, even if you get it, you can’t cultivate it. What does brother Lu want the divine Dragon materialization technique for? A gift?”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang asked curiously.</p><p>“Of course I’m going to train by myself.”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Cultivate on your own?” Ouyang Xiangxiang was even more curious. However, the next moment, her beautiful eyes widened as a Divine Dragon suddenly appeared above Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>“Divine Dragon phenomenon, and it’s an eight-clawed Divine Dragon phenomenon!”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang’s Red lips widened in shock, and she only recovered after a long while.</p><p>brother Lu, I’ve really underestimated you. I didn’t expect you to have the bloodline of a Divine Dragon in your body. Furthermore, you’ve managed to cultivate the divine Dragon phenomenon in just a month. It’s even an eight-clawed Divine Dragon. I wonder what Tian Hong’s expression will be like when he sees this? ”</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang exclaimed.</p><p>unfortunately, the divine Dragon materialization technique that Tianhong gave me was incomplete.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang finally understood why Lu Ming wanted the complete divine Dragon materialization technique.</p><p>Tianhong found the divine Dragon materialization technique in an ancient ruin, ” ye mo said. he’s been keeping the ruin a secret all these years and has been excavating it secretly. I guess he wants to get the complete divine Dragon materialization technique, but he hasn’t succeeded.</p><p>I once sent people to investigate and found out where the ruins were.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang said.</p><p>“I know!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang nodded. the ruins are in a rather remote place in the Qin heaven star system. It’s a place called the yellow wind Galaxy. Lu Ming, if you want to go, I can go with you.</p><p>“Thank you!”</p><p>Lu Ming stood up to thank him.</p><p>With Ouyang Xiangxiang going with him, his confidence would be much greater.</p><p>“There’s no time to waste. Let’s go now.”</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang was also a decisive person. She immediately went to the teleportation array of the Kong Xuan sect with Lu Ming. They took the teleportation array and rushed to the yellow wind Galaxy.</p><p>The yellow wind Galaxy was very far away from the Kong Xuan sect. It took the two of them a month and a half to arrive at a planet in the yellow wind Galaxy by using the teleportation formation.</p><p>After that, the two of them boarded the interplanetary warship and flew toward their destination.</p><p>After flying for a few more days, a strange planet appeared in front of them.</p><p>From afar, this planet looked like a dragon’s head. It was like a gigantic Divine Dragon that had its head chopped off. Its head was floating in the air, forming a planet.</p><p>this is Dragonhead planet, ” ye mo said. there are no living creatures on this planet. It’s a desolate place. The relic of the divine Dragon materialization technique that Tian Hong obtained is on this planet.</p><p>now, Tianhong is probably on this planet. We should be careful not to alert him.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Immediately, the two of them exited the interplanetary warship and appeared in the starry sky.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current cultivation, he could still fly in the starry sky for a short time.</p><p>As for Ouyang Xiangxiang, she was a heavenly God and could cross the starry sky with her own strength.</p><p>The two of them concealed their auras and flew toward Dragonhead star.</p><p>Not long after, the two of them entered the atmosphere of Dragonhead planet and landed on a mountain.</p><p>the ruins should be in the East. Let’s go.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang said.</p><p>Dragon head planet wasn’t very big. It was much smaller than the other life planets. In a short while, they had flown past more than half of the planets.</p><p>A huge mountain range appeared in front of them, like a Divine Dragon lying on the ground.</p><p>Suddenly, they saw a figure flash by. The two of them quickly hid and watched from afar.</p><p>At the head of the mountain range, there was a huge cave. A group of people were guarding the cave.</p><p>There were young people and old people.</p><p>it’s Tian Hong’s men. It seems that Tian Hong is indeed here.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang said.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned slightly. The people from the Tian Hong sect were guarding the entrance of the cave. How were they going to enter?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
