It didn’t belong to the sacred son of reflection or the Supreme sacred son.</p><p>Kacha Kacha …</p><p>A voice came from one of the caves. Then, a huge figure crawled out of the cave.</p><p>Without a doubt, this huge creature was a planet Devourer, and it was completely golden.</p><p>Another gold-tier planet Devourer.</p><p>Moreover, this gold-grade planet Devourer was very different from the gold-grade planet Devourer that had appeared before.</p><p>This gold-grade planet Devourer actually had three heads and six extremely sharp front claws. It looked very horrifying.</p><p>not good, it’s a mutated gold-grade planet Devourer. Its strength is several times stronger than a normal gold-grade planet Devourer.</p><p>Bone shouted in his sea of consciousness.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart sank.</p><p>This one was actually a mutated gold-grade planet Devourer, which was several times stronger than a normal gold-grade planet Devourer. How could they fight it?</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s current physical condition, he was not even a match for a silver-grade planet Devourer, let alone a gold-grade one.</p><p>Furthermore, this planet Devourer could speak, unlike the previous planet devourers.</p><p>“Hehehe, human brat, you’re really powerful. You have so many trump cards. Luckily, I’m smart enough to let those idiots come out first. Hehe, now, what do you have to fight me with? go to hell!”</p><p>The mutated Golden Planet Devourer shrieked. It waved its sharp claws and slashed at Lu Ming. A Golden ray of light slashed at him.</p><p>“Song of the green Lotus sword!”</p><p>die! Ouyang Qingxiang shouted and stood in front of Lu Ming. She used all her strength to cast the song of the Azure Lotus sword. A huge sword Qi slashed forward.</p><p>With Ouyang Xiangxiang’s current cultivation at the fifth-level celestial deity realm, her full power was astonishing.</p><p>However, when her sword light clashed with the mutated gold rank Devourer’s light, her sword light instantly shattered. Ouyang Qingxiang groaned and her body flew far away. She hit the wall and spat out a large mouthful of blood. One of her battle armors was split open, revealing a wound that was so deep that her bones could be seen.</p><p>With just one move, Ouyang Qingxiang was severely injured and no longer able to fight.</p><p>you want to stop me with such strength? you’re simply looking for death. Hehehe!</p><p>The mutated Golden Planet Devourer let out a sharp laugh and looked at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>kid, your cultivation is very low, but you’re so powerful. There must be a secret. I can feel that your flesh and blood are full of energy. It must be delicious. As long as I eat you, my strength will definitely rise by a large margin. Hehehe!</p><p>The mutated gold-grade planet Devourer’s Scarlet tongue sneered and it walked towards Lu Ming unhurriedly.</p><p>“Senior bone, what should we do now?”</p><p>Lu Ming was seeking help from the bone demon.</p><p>kid, don’t count on me. With my current condition, I can’t beat this mutated gold-grade planet Devourer. Your only hope now is that purple-copper coffin.</p><p>Bone said.</p><p>“That purple-copper coffin?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>“That’s right, that purple copper coffin is as heavy as a mountain. If we use it to sneak attack, we might be able to heavily injure it. You guys can take the chance to escape.”</p><p>Bone said.</p><p>“Alright … Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. This was the only plan they had now.</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming’s glabella lit up and the scroll flew out, flying towards the mutated gold-grade planet Devourer and above its head.</p><p>“A broken painting scroll, break for me!”</p><p>The mutant Golden Planet Devourer let out a sharp laugh, its sharp claws slashing towards the painting, trying to tear it apart.</p><p>“Smash it!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared and controlled the scroll. The scroll shook and a purple bronze coffin fell from the scroll, smashing heavily towards the mutated gold-level planet Devourer.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>The mutated gold-grade planet Devourer’s sharp claws kept slashing at the purple copper coffin, making clanking sounds. However, it could not slow down the speed of the purple copper coffin’s descent at all.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The purple coffin was as heavy as a mountain. It fell on the mutated Golden Planet Devourer, almost crushing one of its heads.</p><p>The mutant gold planet Devourer was pressed to the ground, its 6 claws flailing about madly, struggling.</p><p>“It’s really useful!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He did not expect the purple copper coffin to be so heavy that it could crush the mutated gold planet Devourer.</p><p>“This is a good opportunity!”</p><p>How could Lu Ming miss this opportunity? he mustered all his remaining strength and charged at the mutated gold planet Devourer with the long spear in hand.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming aimed his spear at the neck of the mutated Golden Planet Devourer.</p><p>However, the other party’s head tilted to the side. Lu Ming did not stab his neck. Instead, he stabbed the carapace on the other party’s head. There was the sound of a nail being nailed and sparks flew in all directions. Lu Ming did not penetrate the other party’s defense.</p><p>Lu Ming was not in his ancient God Body state. There was a huge difference between their abilities. As long as he did not hit his opponent’s vital points, he could not even break through his opponent’s defense.</p><p>“You want to hide? let’s see how you can hide.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear continued to thrust out, specifically aiming for the other party’s soft vital points such as the eyes and neck.</p><p>“You want to kill me? Don’t even think about it, don’t even think about it, die, die …”</p><p>The mutated Golden Planet Devourer roared madly. Its three heads writhed and its six sharp claws reached out randomly. A few of its claws grabbed onto the purple copper coffin, trying to push it open.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Suddenly, a cracking sound came from the purple copper coffin.</p><p>That was because the mutated Golden Planet Devourer’s sharp claws had grabbed the lid of the purple copper coffin. Just now, the lid had been pushed a little.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Then, the lid of the coffin was pushed a little bit more, and there was a small gap between the lid and the body of the coffin.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, a roar came from the gap of the purple copper coffin.</p><p>This roar was earth-shattering, causing Lu Ming’s eardrums to ring and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Then, a terrifying aura emanated from the purple-copper coffin, enveloping Lu Ming and the mutated Golden Planet Devourer.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>The roars from the purple bronze coffin became even more terrifying. A terrifying force pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming could not move at all. It was as if he was being controlled. Even his senses were being controlled. Everything before his eyes was pitch black.</p><p>However, in the next moment, his eyes lit up again. Then, he realized that he had actually arrived in the universe.</p><p>In the starry sky, there was an incomparably huge giant whose fist was bigger than a planet.</p><p>Ancient God!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart was beating wildly. This was clearly an ancient God.</p><p>The ancient God roared and punched out. In the starry sky, planets exploded one after another. The scene was extremely terrifying.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
