That array can refine a star into a star core. Therefore, the planets surrounding the star are also affected. They are much smaller than other planets, but their density is also many times higher. The density of the objects on them is also many times higher!</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang said.</p><p>Lu Ming and the group nodded. They had also thought of this.</p><p>In such an environment, this planet was naturally dead silent. There were no living creatures. Everywhere he looked, he could only see bare rocks that gave off a metallic luster.</p><p>Moreover, these rocks were fiery red, like pieces of rubies. Of course, these rocks would be treasures in the mortal world. However, they were of no use to Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Although this planet is much smaller than the planets in the outside world, its surface area is still astonishingly large. I think it’s better for us to split up so that it’ll be easier to find the array plates!”</p><p>At this moment, the Supreme Holy Son spoke coldly.</p><p>that’s right. I think so too. Supreme universe, let’s join forces!</p><p>The sacred son of reflection said.</p><p>“Good, just what I want!”</p><p>The Supreme Holy Son laughed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>With a flash, the floating light Saint son, Zhi Xia Saint son, Yan Kong Saint son, and Xue Tan Saint daughter appeared beside the Supreme Saint son.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Ouyang Qingxiang, let’s have a competition and see who can get the array plate!”</p><p>The Supreme Saint sneered and then turned around to leave with the drift light Saint son and the others.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop them or say anything. The departure of the Supreme Holy Son and the rest was exactly what Lu Ming wanted. He could not be bothered to move with them.</p><p>Even if the other party didn’t leave on their own, he would find an excuse to leave.</p><p>Only Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang were left at the scene.</p><p>The two of them discussed for a while, then randomly chose a direction and ran along the ground.</p><p>The ground here was made of fiery red Rocks, some of which had already crystallized. They were extremely hard, and not even a blade of grass grew on them.</p><p>The two of them ran for tens of thousands of miles, but the situation was the same. They didn’t find anything.</p><p>The two of them were helpless and could only continue moving forward. They had no idea where the array plate was, so they could only try their luck in the dark.</p><p>Just like that, a few hours passed, and they still found nothing.</p><p>“There’s something on the ground …”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He felt a slight vibration from the ground.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Just as Lu Ming finished his sentence, the rocks on the ground exploded with a bang. Then, a fiery red light rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming did not think. His divine power burst out and he threw a punch at the fiery red light. There was a loud explosion and the fiery red light was blown away. It hit the ground and created a huge pit.</p><p>“There are actually living beings here …”</p><p>Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang were both stunned.</p><p>At this moment, they could clearly see what the fiery red light was. It was a living creature that looked very similar to a pangolin. Its entire body was covered in a layer of fiery red armor, and on its two claws, there were two sharp, ice-cold claws.</p><p>Squeak …</p><p>The pangolin squeaked and looked at Lu Ming with burning greed in its eyes.</p><p>“Flesh, flesh and blood …”</p><p>The pangolin shouted. With a sway of its body, it charged at Lu Ming again.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming threw another punch and the pangolin was sent flying. It crashed onto the ground but the pangolin shook its body and stood up.</p><p>“What a strong defensive power …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>He could tell that this pangolin was roughly at the first level heavenly deity realm, but its defensive power was much stronger than other first level heavenly deity realm creatures.</p><p>An ordinary first-level celestial deity would have been torn to pieces by Lu Ming’s punch. However, the pangolin seemed to be fine after being hit by Lu Ming’s two punches.</p><p>“Flesh, flesh and blood …”</p><p>The pangolin let out a sharp cry and pounced at Lu Ming again.</p><p>This time, a long spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hands and he thrust it forward.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The long spear pierced through the pangolin’s mouth and pierced through it. This time, the pangolin struggled a few times before it stopped moving. There was no sign of life left.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and kept the pangolin.</p><p>The scales of this pangolin were extremely hard. If they were used to make armor, it would be difficult for anyone below the heavenly God Realm to break through it. This was a good item.</p><p>there are still living beings on this planet. How amazing!</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang also sighed.</p><p>I’m guessing that it’s the remaining living beings on this planet …</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>He speculated that this planet must have had many living beings, but with the formation, the star gradually died out, and the environment outside changed greatly. Many living beings went extinct or left this place.</p><p>However, some creatures had extremely tenacious vitality. They might evolve with the changes in their environment and survive tenaciously, such as the pangolin.</p><p>The appearance of the pangolin caused the two of them to raise their guard.</p><p>Since the pangolin could exist, there might be more creatures. There might even be extremely terrifying creatures. They had to be careful.</p><p>The two of them retracted their auras and continued to advance in the same direction. Not long after, they encountered another pangolin attack. However, its strength was similar to the previous one. The two of them used their full strength and easily killed it.</p><p>there are living beings here. Perhaps they know where the array plate is!</p><p>Suddenly, Ouyang Qingxiang’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“That’s right, why didn’t I think of that!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>With this thought in mind, the two of them felt a fire burning in their hearts. They continued to move in this direction, and sure enough, not long after, they encountered a few more pangolins.</p><p>The two of them severely injured one of the pangolin creatures, while killing the rest.</p><p>“Speak, do you know if there are any array plates here?”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped on the pangolin’s body and looked down at it, asking coldly.</p><p>“Flesh, flesh and blood …”</p><p>The pangolin kept struggling and growling. It did not answer Lu Ming’s question.</p><p>“This kind of living being seems to have very low intelligence. It only knows how to devour flesh and blood …”</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang frowned.</p><p>It was obvious that there were no other living creatures on this planet. These pangolin creatures were very thirsty for flesh and blood. That was why they kept attacking Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>However, its spiritual intelligence was extremely low.</p><p>“Since spiritual intelligence is not enough, then I’ll search your soul!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. Then, he cast the soul-searching art and began to search his soul.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming managed to obtain some useful information from the pangolin’s soul.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
