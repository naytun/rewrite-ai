Because the energy of the blood pool was limited, the opening time was fixed.</p><p>It would open once every 100 years.</p><p>Lu Ming wandered around the eighth tribe and unknowingly came to a wide open space. At this time, his path was blocked.</p><p>More than ten young men, each of them burly and dark-skinned, blocked Lu Ming’s path.</p><p>He was an expert of the younger generation in the eighth tribe.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I heard that you’re the descendant of an ascetic?”</p><p>A young man with a square face and a height of about two meters stared at Lu Ming and asked.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>there’s always a rumor that every ascetic has extremely powerful combat strength that far surpasses his peers. I wonder if this rumor is true. Today, we’ll see it for ourselves.</p><p>The square-faced young man said, revealing a strong desire to fight.</p><p>It turned out that these young men wanted to spar with Lu Ming.</p><p>With a sweep of his gaze, he discovered that the square-faced young man’s cultivation was only at the seventh stage true God Realm. Lu Ming shook his head and said, ” “You’re not my match!”</p><p>Lu Ming was speaking the truth. A seventh stage true God was indeed not his match.</p><p>“Presumptuous! Your cultivation is clearly lower than mine. How do you know that I’m not your match? we haven’t awakened our divine bodies either. My cultivation is higher than yours, so I can suppress you. Come, let’s fight!”</p><p>The square-faced young man was very persistent. His combat strength was strong as he charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The other young men were also staring at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly. He knew that he had no choice but to take action.</p><p>In the legends of the descendants of the ancient gods, ascetics were people with extremely powerful combat strength. These people were obviously very curious and did not believe it. They wanted to test Lu Ming’s skills.</p><p>In the surroundings, figures appeared one after another. They were the descendants of the other ancient gods. Gu Hongshan’s figure had also appeared. However, they didn’t stop him. Instead, they looked on with anticipation.</p><p>The descendants of the ancient gods loved to fight. They wanted to see Lu Ming’s combat strength!</p><p>“Alright, then let’s have a spar.”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. His body rose into the air and he stood high in the sky.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The square-faced young man took a step forward and soared into the sky as well, standing face to face with Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The square-faced young man was the first to move. Facing Lu Ming, he didn’t dare to be careless and used his full strength. The power of a seventh tier true God erupted completely and he threw a punch at Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming also threw a punch.</p><p>This punch had triggered the double combat power of the battle formula.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The two fists collided with a violent boom. Then, the square-faced young man’s body shook violently and was blown away like a cannonball. He flew hundreds of miles away. His face turned pale and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>The square-faced young man looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>One move. It was only one move and he was defeated. He was no match for Lu Ming at all.</p><p>amazing. As expected of the descendant of a bitter cultivator. His cultivation is obviously two levels lower, but in terms of strength, he completely overpowers me.</p><p>Gu Hongshan exclaimed.</p><p>that’s true. I also feel that he didn’t use his full strength. I wonder how strong he will be if he uses his full strength.</p><p>The others also sighed, feeling even more curious.</p><p>“Thanks for letting me win!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists at the square-faced young man.</p><p>amazing, he’s indeed amazing. I’m convinced!</p><p>The square-faced young man sighed and flew down to the ground.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>After the square-faced young man flew down, another young man flew up to look at the sky and stood in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>I’m gu Zhuo, at the stage nine of true God Realm. I’d like to have a look.</p><p>The young man cupped his fists.</p><p>“Please!”</p><p>Lu Ming raised his hand.</p><p>since the other party wanted to spar, he would accompany him to the end. He would make the ancient God completely convinced and show his strength. Only then would he be able to gain more benefits from the ancient God descendants.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Gu Zhuo made his move. His muscles bulged, and his body seemed to have turned into steel. Although he hadn’t awakened his ancient God Body, the power of his divine body was extraordinary.</p><p>He attacked continuously, his fists tearing through the air and blasting toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming did not take out his long spear. He also used his fist to fight the enemy.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s fist contained six types of divine power. Furthermore, it was the explosive power of the battle character formula that tripled his combat power. Lu Ming’s strength was already astonishingly strong and he could completely suppress his opponent.</p><p>Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>The two of them exchanged a few moves in a row. Gu Zhuo could not withstand Lu Ming’s attacks and retreated frantically.</p><p>It was almost the same as the square-faced young man earlier. He was also crushed by Lu Ming.</p><p>amazing, really amazing. Gu Zhuo, a stage nine true God, is hard to match.</p><p>the ascetic’s strength is truly terrifying. Can he fight against a heavenly God? ”</p><p>Many descendants of the ancient gods were shocked by Lu Ming.</p><p>The dozen or so youths who had challenged Lu Ming earlier looked at each other.</p><p>Among them, Gu Zhuo was the strongest. If he couldn’t defeat Gu Zhuo, the other sects didn’t need to fight.</p><p>“Is there anyone else who wants to give me a lesson?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked. The dozen or so youths were silent. They had already acknowledged Lu Ming’s ability.</p><p>the descendant of the ascetics. As expected of the descendant of the ascetics. Your strength is amazing. How about I experience it? ”</p><p>At this moment, a voice came from afar. Then, a figure flashed and a rather handsome young man appeared in the sky.</p><p>This young man’s aura was vast and mighty. He actually reached the celestial deity realm, a first level celestial deity.</p><p>“Big brother Gu Ming, it’s big brother Gu Ming.”</p><p>The youths from before were shocked.</p><p>“Gu Ming, you’re one of the strongest geniuses in the eighth tribe. You’re also a first-tier celestial God and have awakened the ancient God Body. It’s a little inappropriate for you to spar with Lu Ming.”</p><p>Gu Hongshan stood out and said.</p><p>“Big brother Hong Shan, I can see that Lu Ming is very powerful and I can’t help but feel a little itchy to learn from him. If Lu Ming doesn’t want to spar, I won’t force him.”</p><p>Gu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>He was indeed itching for a fight. Seeing that Lu Ming was so powerful, he could not help but want to compete with Lu Ming and see what other tricks the descendants of the ascetics had.</p><p>“But …”</p><p>Gu Hongshan was still hesitant. After all, Gu Ming was much more powerful than Lu Ming.</p><p>big brother Hong Shan, it’s fine. I was just thinking of sparring and understanding the power of the ancient God Body.</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>He had seen Gu Hongshan and the others use the ancient God Body before. He only knew that it was very powerful. He had never tried it himself. He was very curious about how powerful the ancient God Body was.</p><p>if that’s the case, why don’t you two have a match? but be careful, Lu Ming. Gu Ming has an orange-armored ancient God Body.</p><p>Gu Hongshan reminded.</p><p>“An orange-armored ancient God Body? Come on!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a strong fighting spirit.</p><p>haha, brother Lu Ming, you’re so forthright. But if you want me to use the orange-armored ancient God Body, you’ll have to see if you can force me to do so.</p><p>Gu Ming laughed. His heavenly God Realm aura burst out. A two-meter long mace appeared in his hand. It was extremely ferocious.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
