In the next moment, they appeared in midair.</p><p>Above their heads, there was a vortex that was slowly spinning.</p><p>Three months later, they would be able to return to the Kong Xuan sect as long as they returned to this place.</p><p>“It seems that the three of us were teleported to different locations.”</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze across the room.</p><p>He was with Ouyang Qingxiang and the other two, but he didn’t see the Supreme Saint son or the transient light Saint son. It was obvious that they had separated after being transported here.</p><p>that’s good. Let’s go and find the planet Devourer.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang said.</p><p>The four of them flew down.</p><p>The ground below was deathly silent.</p><p>A planet Devourer was a terrifying creature in the primeval universe. This kind of creature would be born naturally when a planet was about to dry up.</p><p>They would devour the energy of the planet and accelerate the aging and exhaustion of the planet.</p><p>There were no trees on the ground and the divine Qi was very thin. There were many caves on the ground, densely packed like a beehive. These caves were dug out by the planet Devourer after devouring the energy of the planet.</p><p>let’s go into these caves. The planet Devourer must be hiding in one of them.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang said.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest nodded and flew towards a cave.</p><p>At this moment, a figure flickered in one of the caves, and then, a figure rushed out.</p><p>Squeak …</p><p>The figure let out an ear-piercing sound.</p><p>“It’s the planet Devourer.”</p><p>The four people’s eyes lit up.</p><p>He did not expect to encounter a planet Devourer as soon as he arrived.</p><p>The body of the planet Devourer was extremely large. It was at least ten meters tall and looked like a huge insect. The two claws in front of its body were like two divine blades.</p><p>Especially its mouth, it was big and sharp, full of fangs, very ferocious.</p><p>Its body was bronze in color.</p><p>This was the bronze planet Devourer.</p><p>a bronze planet Devourer. Let me destroy him. The young man behind Ouyang Qingxiang stepped out with a battle-axe in his hand. He was about to attack the bronze planet Devourer.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang had brought a man and a woman with her. Their names were Kang Chong and Liu Jie. They were the most talented heaven’s pride talents under Ouyang Qingxiang.</p><p>Although the divine power that the two of them controlled was not divine grade divine power, it was still the top king grade divine power. Moreover, their cultivation was at the fourth level heavenly God Realm.</p><p>Of course, they had been cultivating for a long time. They had cultivated for hundreds of thousands of years. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have such profound cultivation.</p><p>Among the inner court disciples of Kong Xuan sect, those who had cultivated for hundreds of thousands of years were considered to be in the younger generation.</p><p>Kang Chong’s aura bloomed as he circulated his divine power. His battleaxe glowed as he slashed at the planet Devourer with astonishing power.</p><p>Squeak …</p><p>The planet realm Devourer shrieked. It twisted its body and pounced at Kang Chong at an astonishing speed. Its two claws, which were as sharp as divine blades, slashed at Kang Chong.</p><p>“So fast!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang were both shocked.</p><p>Kang Chong was also shocked. He had not expected the planet Devourer’s speed to be so astonishing.</p><p>At the critical moment, he let out a loud roar and changed his moves. The battle axe struck out like a storm. In an instant, he had struck out over a hundred times, and the shadows of the axe surrounded his body.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>In the air, a dense collision and explosion sound rang out. Then, the two figures retreated.</p><p>Kang Chong and the planet Devourer both retreated tens of thousands of meters.</p><p>“What powerful strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming, Ouyang Qingxiang, and the others were shocked.</p><p>This planet Devourer was actually able to contend with Kang Chong.</p><p>One had to know that Kang Chong’s cultivation had reached the fourth level celestial deity realm and his combat strength was definitely not weak. Otherwise, Ouyang Qingxiang would not have chosen him to help her.</p><p>And this planet Devourer was only a bronze-grade planet Devourer, yet it had such strong combat power.</p><p>Then how strong would the silver Devourer, the gold planet Devourer, be?</p><p>The few of them looked at each other and saw the seriousness in each other’s eyes.</p><p>It seemed that it would not be easy to get the points.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At that moment, Kang Chong roared, brandished his battle axe, and used a divine skill to attack the bronze planet Devourer.</p><p>The bronze planet Devourer also shrieked and charged at Kang Chong. The two of them fought intensely, and after dozens of moves, it was difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>“Let’s attack together and end the battle quickly.”</p><p>let’s go! Ouyang Qingxiang said as she rushed out. A green sword Qi bloomed and slashed at the bronze planet Devourer.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sword Qi slashed at the planet Devourer’s sharp claw and left a deep mark, almost cutting the claw in half.</p><p>Although Ouyang Xiangxiang’s cultivation was also at the fourth-level celestial deity realm, her strength was much stronger than Kang Chong’s. Her first move completely suppressed the planet Devourer.</p><p>“Song of the green Lotus sword!”</p><p>die! Ouyang Qingxiang shouted. Green sword Qi bloomed and enveloped the planet Devourer. Although the planet Devourer was powerful, he was still completely suppressed.</p><p>After a few moves, the sword light flashed and the planet Devourer’s head was cut off.</p><p>With a wave of her hand, Ouyang Qingxiang kept the planet Devourer’s head. When the time came, she would only need to bring the planet Devourer’s head back to calculate the points.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Then, the four of them rushed into a cave.</p><p>The entire planet seemed to have been dug through. It was filled with caves that extended in all directions, like a maze.</p><p>The four of them followed a cave and flew aimlessly.</p><p>Unfortunately, after searching for a few hours, he didn’t find a single Devourer.</p><p>it seems like there aren’t many planet devourers.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>“Then what should we do? If this continues, three months will pass by very quickly. If we’re unlucky and don’t find many planet devourers, we won’t be able to compete with the other two sides.”</p><p>Kang Chong said anxiously.</p><p>In Kang Chong and Liu Jie’s hearts, their side was the weakest. They couldn’t compare to the Supreme Saint son and the transient light Saint son. Thus, this round was extremely important.</p><p>If their points in the first round were higher, they could still compete with the other two teams. If their points in the first round were not as high as the other two teams, then there was really no point in competing.</p><p>“The Devourer’s habit is to devour the energy of a planet, so it must be very sensitive to energy. Let’s leave these caves and go to the surface. Then, we can use divine crystals or gemstones to emit energy waves. Perhaps it can attract the Devourer.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang, Kang Chong, and Liu Jie’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Holy Son Lu Ming is really sharp. Kang Chong is impressed.</p><p>Kang Chong cupped his fists and said.</p><p>“Let’s go and try.”</p><p>Lu Ming said. Then, the four of them flew upwind. They could not be bothered to return through the tunnel. They bombarded the rocks directly and broke through the rocks until they reached the surface.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
