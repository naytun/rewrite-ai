He secretly swore in his heart that he would do his best for Lu Ming.</p><p>“Alright, I promise you!”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son himself was stunned for a moment before he responded loudly.</p><p>What a joke. How could he miss such a good opportunity to kill Lu Ming?</p><p>He immediately agreed, afraid that Lu Ming would go back on his word.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and took out a piece of paper. He forced out a wisp of blood and wrote the words ‘life and death duel’ on the paper. He then signed his name on it.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, the letter of life-and-death duel flew toward the Tian Hong Saint son.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son took it and a trace of doubt flashed in his eyes. Lu Ming’s decisiveness and calmness made him uneasy.</p><p>“Hmph, no matter what, he’s at the true God Realm. He’s only been here for one hundred years. How strong can he be? I’m overthinking.”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son shook his head to get rid of the uneasiness in his heart. Then, he also forced out a bit of blood and signed his name on the ‘life-and-death duel’.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and kept the life-and-death duel letter.”Tianhong, three days later, on the life-and-death battle stage, the first move, life-and-death!”</p><p>Having said that, Lu Ming turned around and left.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang and the rest followed Lu Ming and left.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you confident?”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming in a low voice.</p><p>“80%!”</p><p>Lu Ming answered.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang’s beautiful eyes flickered.</p><p>She was shocked that Lu Ming was 80% confident that he could defeat the Tian Hong Saint son.</p><p>He could tell that Lu Ming must have had a fortuitous encounter and his cultivation had already reached the eighth tier of true God.</p><p>However, there was still a huge gap between an eighth-tier true God and the Tian Hong Saint son. Could Lu Ming really cross such a huge gap and fight the Tian Hong Saint son?</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang and the others had looks of anticipation in their eyes.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll kill you in three days.”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son waved his sleeves and returned to the palace.</p><p>Not long after, the news of the life-and-death battle between Lu Ming and the Tian Hong Saint son spread like wildfire throughout the entire Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>The entire Kong Xuan sect was shaken, and a huge commotion was set off.</p><p>Upon hearing this news, countless people were dumbfounded.</p><p>“Lu Ming is going to have a life-and-death battle with the Tian Hong Saint son? Is that true? He doesn’t want to live anymore?”</p><p>it must be true. The life-and-death duel has been signed. We’ll fight in three days!</p><p>Lu Ming must be crazy. Isn’t he seeking his own death? ”</p><p>who knows? let’s just wait and see in three days. The Kong Xuan sect’s eight Holy Sons and holy virgins will probably return to seven soon.</p><p>Many people were discussing in shock, but the public opinion was almost one-sided. They felt that Lu Ming was overestimating his ability.</p><p>A few decades ago, when the sect master had just conferred Lu Ming the title of Saint, Lu Ming had displayed his combat abilities. At that time, he could only fight with an expert on the real God ranking list.</p><p>How far was the real God ranking list from the fighting power of the Tian Hong Saint son? Many people couldn’t cross it in their entire lives, let alone decades.</p><p>The Kong Xuan sect, the experts of the various sects, the Holy Sons and holy virgins had all returned from the ancient God Star and were all paying attention to this matter.</p><p>Many elders even came out of seclusion to pay attention to the battle between the Saints.</p><p>Just like that, three days passed by in a flash.</p><p>Three days later, the life-and-death battle stage of the Kong Xuan sect was surrounded by people.</p><p>The outer sect disciples, deacons, and elders of the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>There were more than a hundred thousand inner disciples, inner deacons, and inner elders.</p><p>There was a sea of people, all here to watch this great battle.</p><p>This life-and-death battle was of great significance. One of the Saints was destined to fall.</p><p>If the Tian Hong Saint son won and killed Lu Ming, the situation in the Kong Xuan sect would return to the past, where there were five Saint sons and two saintesses.</p><p>Once Lu Ming won, the situation in Kong Xuan sect would change drastically.</p><p>Lu Ming would rise to power and many people would join his faction. He would suppress the other Holy Sons and holy virgins and even compete with the Supreme Holy Son.</p><p>Not only these people, but almost all the other Holy Sons and holy virgins had come, but they were hiding in the dark.</p><p>“Who do you think will win, Tianhong or Lu Ming?”</p><p>Holy Son Zhi Xia asked the other Holy Sons and holy virgins.</p><p>that goes without saying. It’s definitely Tian Hong. More than fifty years ago, Tian Hong and I went to stop him in the world of ancient gods, but he didn’t even dare to let out a fart. He only managed to survive with Ouyang Qingxiang’s help. Do you think he can fight Tian Hong? ”</p><p>I guess he had some fortuitous encounter in the world of ancient gods, and his strength has improved, so he is full of confidence. Just wait for death!</p><p>The sacred son sneered.</p><p>The other Holy Sons and holy virgins looked thoughtful.</p><p>“The Tian Hong Saint son is here!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>Then, everyone saw a group of people walking through the air.</p><p>The person in the lead was the Tian Hong Saint son. He was dressed in luxurious clothes and looked mighty and domineering.</p><p>A group of experts followed behind him. Many of them were inner court elder level experts. A vast pressure spread out and it was awe-inspiring.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son took the lead and landed on the life-and-death battle stage.</p><p>“Lu Ming is here!”</p><p>Someone shouted again.</p><p>In another direction, Lu Ming came with an hai and Liu Chang. Compared to the Tian Hong Saint son, the scene was much more awkward.</p><p>a Saint only has two subordinates. That’s funny.</p><p>when he’s killed by the Tian Hong Saint son, he’ll only have two subordinates. That’ll be a new record for the Kong Xuan sect. Hahaha!</p><p>Some people who had a grudge against Lu Ming mocked him.</p><p>Lu Ming had a cold smile on his face.</p><p>Let’s see if these people can still laugh after a while.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and landed on the fighting ring.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you really have the guts to come. Very good, very good!”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son glared at Lu Ming with a dark look.</p><p>“It’s very good. Cut the crap and make your move!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“Since you want to die, I’ll fulfill your wish!”</p><p>The Tianhong Saint son’s eyes turned ferocious. His body began to swell. He was covered in scales and turned into a Dragonman.</p><p>“Great sun Dragon Claw hand!”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son shouted. He took a step forward and swept toward Lu Ming like a gust of wind. His claws were no different from a dragon’s claws as he kept trying to grab Lu Ming.</p><p>This was a terrifying divine technique that had been cultivated by the Tian Hong Saint son to the sixth level. With the Tian Hong Saint son’s fourth-level celestial deity cultivation and the support of his sacred-grade divine power, it was terrifyingly powerful. It could tear apart a mountain range that was millions of miles long.</p><p>If the life-and-death battle stage had not been reinforced with a powerful array, it would not have been able to withstand the attack of the Tian Hong Saint son.</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>A loud explosion erupted from within Lu Ming’s body. The battle symbol art quadrupled his combat power. Lu Ming activated it. At the same time, six divine flames burned fiercely, providing him with strong divine power.</p><p>nine-layer Crimson Gold armor, three world-destroying strikes!</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming cast two types of divine skills.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
