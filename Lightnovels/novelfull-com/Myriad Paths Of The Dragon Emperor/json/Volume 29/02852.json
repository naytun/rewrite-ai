Lu Ming had actually dared to come to them. He was simply courting death.</p><p>Moreover, he was treating them with such a high and mighty attitude. He was simply foolish. He wanted Lu Ming to kneel in front of him and then kill him.</p><p>He had the cultivation of a third-level celestial deity. Wasn’t it almost certain that he would be able to deal with Lu Ming?</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>At that moment, Ouyang Qingxiang and the rest had also arrived. She shouted and was about to help Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was faster than her.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A long spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hands and he swept the spear out.</p><p>A huge spear light burst out and hit the old man’s big hand.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The spear radiance collided with the giant hand. The giant hand shook violently and then shattered. The spear radiance did not stop and continued to press down on the old man.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>The old man was shocked. He had never expected that a large hand condensed from divine power with his third-level celestial deity cultivation base would actually be destroyed by Lu Ming’s spear.</p><p>“Mountain-crushing hand!”</p><p>The old man bellowed in anger. He unleashed all his divine energy and performed a divine skill. He struck out a few times in a row and a huge palm print was sent flying towards Lu Ming. It only managed to block Lu Ming’s attack with a violent explosion.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had already launched his second attack.</p><p>“Break the sky!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had already activated his fourfold combat strength and cast the three apocalyptic strikes. A dazzling spear ray burst out and attacked the old man.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Spear’s radiance was as dazzling as a meteor from outer space. It pierced through all of the old man’s defenses and then went through his body, nailing him to the ground.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The old man didn’t die. He was nailed to the ground by the long spear. He let out a miserable and terrified scream. At the same time, he was deeply shocked.</p><p>He went all out but was not Lu Ming’s match and was crushed by Lu Ming. Had Lu Ming’s abilities already reached this level?</p><p>The others, including Ouyang Qingxiang and the others, were also stunned. They clearly did not expect Lu Ming to be so powerful. This scene had exceeded their expectations.</p><p>However, Ouyang Qingxiang reacted quickly. Her figure flashed and she stood on the mountain peak. A powerful aura emanated from her and pressed down on the other people from the great Hong sect, causing them to not dare to move.</p><p>The highest cultivation level among them was only at the fourth-level celestial deity realm. They were not Ouyang Qingxiang’s match at all.</p><p>“Speak, Tianhong, where is he?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked coldly.</p><p>the Saint, the Saint has already returned to the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>The old man said with a pale face.</p><p>“I went back first. Very good, I’ll send you on your way.”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>The old man roared and wanted to struggle. However, Lu Ming shook his spear and a terrifying energy burst out from his body.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The old man’s body was torn into pieces, and he died on the spot.</p><p>The rest of the people from the great Hong sect turned pale and broke out in a cold sweat. They were afraid that Lu Ming would kill them too.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand, put away the long spear, and shouted coldly.</p><p>“Yes, yes, yes …”</p><p>Those people felt as if they had been granted Amnesty. They nodded and bowed before running away in a sorry state.</p><p>“Let’s go back to the Kong Xuan sect.”</p><p>Lu Ming said. With that, his figure soared into the sky.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang and the others looked at each other before following Lu Ming and soaring into the sky.</p><p>At a high altitude, Lu Ming took out the starry sky warship. Everyone boarded the starry sky warship and flew to another planet with a teleportation array.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you going back to look for Tianhong?”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang couldn’t help but ask in the Starship.</p><p>“Why can’t I?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Tianhong is no ordinary person. His combat strength is far beyond ordinary people. He’s not that easy to deal with …”</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang explained.</p><p>“Did his cultivation level increase in the past few years? What’s your cultivation level now?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>“He should still be at the fourth level celestial deity realm, but he has already reached the peak of the fourth level celestial deity realm.”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang said.</p><p>still at the fourth level celestial deity realm. That’s easy. Let’s go back and kill Tian Hong!</p><p>Lu Ming laughed.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang and the rest looked at each other. They did not know why Lu Ming was so confident.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s combat strength was very strong earlier, a third level celestial deity expert was easily crushed by Lu Ming.</p><p>However, the Tian Hong Saint son wasn’t an ordinary person. If he wanted to kill a third-level heavenly God, one move would be enough.</p><p>Not long after, they arrived at a planet near the ancient God Star. Then, they took the teleportation formation and rushed back to the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>As soon as he returned to the Kong Xuan sect, Lu Ming rushed to the residence of the Tian Hong Saint son.</p><p>Like Ouyang Xiangxiang, the Tian Hong Saint son lived on a huge mountain peak with many Grand and gorgeous palaces.</p><p>Many people from the Tian Hong Saint son’s faction were stationed on the mountain.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>The people from the Tian Hong Saint son’s sect discovered Lu Ming and the rest as soon as they approached.</p><p>“It’s Lu Ming and Holy maiden Qingxiang …”</p><p>Then, the group of people recognized Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Where’s Tianhong? get him out here.”</p><p>Lu Ming stood in the sky and shouted.</p><p>“Lu Ming, how dare you …”</p><p>One of the people from the Tian Hong Saint son’s faction was furious.</p><p>you’re too noisy. Tianhong, come out and die!</p><p>Lu Ming’s loud roar was like a thunderclap. His rumbling voice reverberated in the area.</p><p>“That is … Lu Ming!”</p><p>Lu Ming actually provoked the Saint directly. He’s really looking for death!</p><p>“He’s simply tired of living.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice alarmed the other people from the Tian Hong Saint son’s sect. Many people flew out from the buildings and stared at Lu Ming with ill intentions. Many people mocked him.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>At this moment, a cold voice sounded. A young man stepped out of a luxurious palace and stood high in the sky, emitting a cold killing intent.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son had appeared.</p><p>“Tianhong, you’re here indeed. Very good!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>hehe, Lu Ming, you’re really lucky. You didn’t die even in that kind of environment. I have to admire your luck. Now, why are you looking for me? ”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son sneered. He then glanced at an hai, Liu Chang, and the others. Oh, right, I killed one of your men before. You’re not here to seek revenge for him, are you? hahaha!</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son laughed exaggeratedly.</p><p>I’m now officially challenging you to a life-and-death battle. Do you dare to accept my challenge? ”</p><p>Lu Ming spoke word by word, his voice spreading far and wide.</p><p>The entire place fell silent.</p><p>Everyone looked at Lu Ming in a daze.</p><p>Lu Ming actually wanted to challenge the Tian Hong Saint son for a life-and-death battle?</p><p>Many people thought they had heard wrong.</p><p>What was Lu Ming’s cultivation? He was only at the true God Realm. He had only become the Saint because the sect master had made an exception and promoted him. Now, he was actually going to challenge the Tian Hong Saint son to a life-and-death battle?</p><p>A true God Realm?</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t be rash!”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang quickly sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, Yue Linglong, Wu Zifeng, an hai, and the others also sent Lu Ming a voice transmission, advising him not to be rash.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
