When this news came out, the ones who were most shocked were the Holy Sons and holy virgins.</p><p>The floating light Saint son, Zhi Xia Saint son, Yan Kong Saint son, and Xue Tan Saint daughter all looked terrible after hearing the news.</p><p>Now, they had no confidence in competing with the Supreme Holy Son.</p><p>Two days later, the transient light Holy Son arrived at the mansion of the Zhi Xia Holy Son.</p><p>“You want me to join forces with you to help you obtain the zongzi position?”</p><p>Saint son Zhi Xia sneered at the transient light Saint son.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>The sacred son of reflection nodded.</p><p>“Why don’t you help me get the zongzi’s position?”</p><p>Saint son Zhi Xia sneered.</p><p>“Because my strength is above yours.”</p><p>The sacred son said.</p><p>“You sure are confident that you are above me.”</p><p>Saint son Zhi Xia sneered.</p><p>In the past, the zhixia Saint son, the transient light Saint son, and the Tianhong Saint son had all been of similar cultivation.</p><p>Holy maiden Xue Tan, Ouyang Qingxiang, and Saint son Yan Kong were slightly weaker.</p><p>The Paragon Holy Son was the strongest.</p><p>Now that the sacred son of reflection said he was stronger than the Holy Son of zhixia, the Holy Son of zhixia sneered.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, the floating light Holy son’s body started to shine. He seemed to have turned into a ball of divine light.</p><p>fifth level celestial deity, you broke through!</p><p>Saint son Zhi Xia’s expression changed.</p><p>In the past, he, floating light, and Tian Hong’s cultivation had been at the peak of the fourth level heavenly God Realm. He didn’t expect the floating light Holy Son to have already broken through to the fifth level heavenly God Realm.</p><p>This meant that the sacred son of reflection was indeed more powerful than him.</p><p>“Do you understand now? I’m more powerful than you. Only if you help me will we have a chance to defeat the Supreme Holy Son and Lu Ming.”</p><p>I can promise you that as long as I become the zongzi and become the sect leader of the Kong Xuan sect in the future, you’ll be my equal.</p><p>The sacred son said.</p><p>“Equal status?”</p><p>Saint son Zhi Xia’s eyes moved.</p><p>“That’s right, we’re on equal footing. It’s better than the Supreme Holy Son taking charge of the sect. Do you agree to it?”</p><p>The sacred son said.</p><p>even if I agree to your request, I’m afraid that the two of us are no match for the Supreme Holy Son.</p><p>Saint son Zhi Xia said.</p><p>this time, Ouyang Qingxiang and Lu Ming will definitely join forces. The two of us are indeed not enough. Next, we’ll look for Xue Tan and Yan Kong. As long as the four of us join forces, we’ll be able to fight against the Supreme Saint son. It’s not impossible to defeat him.</p><p>The sacred son said.</p><p>“Alright, I promise you.”</p><p>Saint son Zhi Xia pondered for a while, then nodded in agreement.</p><p>He also knew that in the current situation, only by joining forces could they contend with the Supreme Holy Son. If they didn’t join forces and fought alone, he had no chance of winning.</p><p>Then, they went to the Yan Kong Saint son’s and the Xue Tan Saint son’s residences. After some persuasion, the Yan Kong Saint son and the Xue Tan Saint son agreed to work with the transient light Saint son.</p><p>Just like that, a few months passed in the Kong Xuan sect’s turbulent environment.</p><p>This day, it was finally time to fight for the zongzi position.</p><p>The Kong Xuan sect, the place where the sect competition had been held, was packed with people.</p><p>“Holy Son Lu Ming is here!”</p><p>“Holy maiden Qingxiang is here!”</p><p>“The sacred son of reflection is here!”</p><p>……</p><p>Many people cried out in surprise. The seven great Holy Sons and holy virgins of the Kong Xuan sect had arrived one after another.</p><p>The Supreme Holy Son had his hands behind his back. He was full of dominance and high-spirited, looking down on all the heroes in the world. Only when he turned to look at Lu Ming would he reveal a trace of seriousness.</p><p>“Lu Ming …”</p><p>The Paragon Holy Son muttered, his eyes solemn.</p><p>Just as the seven Holy Sons and holy virgins were sizing each other up, many figures flew out from the depths of the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>The one in the lead was the sect master of the Kong Xuan sect, long Zhoushan. Behind him were a few elders, all of whom were elders of the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>This time, when the Council of Elders made this suggestion, the Dragon Boat Mountain did not object. No one knew what they were planning.</p><p>“Almost everyone’s here!”</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain’s gaze swept across the entire place as his voice rang out.</p><p>The entire place quieted down as they looked at Dragon Boat Mountain. They knew that Dragon Boat Mountain was about to announce the rules for this zongzi competition.</p><p>“This zongzi contest will be divided into two rounds!”</p><p>The one who spoke wasn’t Dragon Boat Mountain, but an old man with white hair.</p><p>This person was called Zhi Zun Dong. He was an extremely old elder of the Kong Xuan sect. He had lived for a long time and was one of the oldest people in the Kong Xuan sect. He was also an ancestor of the Supreme Holy Son.</p><p>In fact, after breaking through to the Martial Emperor realm, it was said that one’s lifespan would be endless. However, that was only a claim. Any living being had a limit to their lifespan.</p><p>For example, in the heaven realm’s primordial realm, martial sovereigns were said to have endless lifespans. Every 33333 years, a Heavenly Tribulation would befall the void Emperor, true Emperor, and great emperor, and many people would die under the heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>As for the heavenly Emperor realm, there were no disasters and tribulations, and their lifespans were endless. In fact, this ‘endless’ also had an end.</p><p>That was because small worlds like the heaven realm and the primordial realm all had an end to their lives. For example, if the heaven realm and the primordial realm were destroyed, would the celestial Thearch still be able to live? he would still die.</p><p>The lifespan of a small chiliocosm would usually not exceed 10 billion years. In other words, a heavenly Emperor’s lifespan would not exceed 10 billion years.</p><p>10 billion years, how long was that?</p><p>One tribulation took 33333 years, while ten thousand tribulations only took three billion years.</p><p>This was almost the same as having an endless lifespan.</p><p>In the primeval universe, the lifespans of deities were similar to that of heavenly emperors. The longest they could live was only ten billion years.</p><p>In the primal universe, there was a saying that the lifespan of deities was the same as a star.</p><p>The lifespan of a star was about 10 billion years, and the lifespan of a God was also 10 billion years.</p><p>The lifespans of hollow gods, true gods, and heavenly gods were almost the same, with ten billion years as the limit.</p><p>When a star was extinguished, a God would also die.</p><p>Therefore, most people would call 10 billion years a stellar year.</p><p>However, the lifespan of a Godking was much longer. The average Godking’s lifespan was more than five star years.</p><p>Autarchs, for example, had already lived for six stellar years, which was equivalent to sixty billion years.</p><p>It was equivalent to a small world like the heaven realm and the primordial realm, or a star, going through six times from birth to destruction.</p><p>No one dared to breathe too loudly as they listened quietly.</p><p>first, let’s talk about the qualifications. Only Holy Sons and holy virgins can participate. Each Holy Son and holy virgins can bring three helpers.</p><p>the first round will be held on a planet that is about to dry up. This planet has already been occupied by the planet Devourer. Your goal is to kill the planet Devourer on this planet and obtain points.</p><p>planet devourers are divided into three levels: bronze planet devourers, Silver Planet devourers, and gold planet devourers. Killing a bronze planet Devourer will earn you one point, killing a Silver Planet Devourer will earn you five points, and killing a gold planet Devourer will earn you 50 points. All right, the Holy Sons and holy virgins who want to participate in the competition can sign up with me.</p><p>The Supreme martial artist announced.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
