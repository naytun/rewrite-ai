It’s a green-armored ancient God Body. Impressive. I wonder how strong it is.</p><p>In the crowd, Gu Ming was also amazed. At the same time, he had a strong desire to fight.</p><p>he really wanted to test the green-armored ancient God body’s combat power.</p><p>” green-armored ancient God Body! Not bad!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming felt that he was filled with infinite power. He was much stronger than before. It was as if he could blow up a star with one punch.</p><p>Of course, this was an illusion. The current Lu Ming could not be that strong. This was an illusion caused by the surge in his strength.</p><p>my cultivation has also broken through and reached the sixth stage of true God Realm.</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile.</p><p>when he had awakened the green-armored ancient God Body, his cultivation had also benefited from it, breaking through to tier six true God.</p><p>At this moment, the ancient God’s apparition turned into a ray of light and rushed into Lu Ming’s body, disappearing.</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming’s body shrunk rapidly. The scales on his body disappeared and he returned to the size of a normal person. He stepped on the air and landed on the shore.</p><p>“Lu Ming, congratulations!”</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re really amazing.”</p><p>Immediately, the people on the shore walked towards Lu Ming with deep envy and admiration on their faces.</p><p>No one was jealous. When a person’s achievements exceeded his own by too much, there would be no jealousy, only envy and worship.</p><p>“I was lucky, I was lucky … Let’s go out!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>afterward, everyone followed the passage and left.</p><p>Lu Ming was warmly welcomed by the eighth tribe after he left.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I think you’d better be single. My Hu Niu is not bad. She can do anything. Do you want to consider it?”</p><p>my second daughter is also not bad. Smart, beautiful, and charming. I think you two are really a good match.</p><p>Immediately, a group of aunties surrounded Lu Ming and started to matchmake him.</p><p>Lu Ming felt a headache coming on, especially when he looked at the few ‘ladies’ who were big and strong and had arms thicker than their waists. He broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>big sister, this is called beautiful and alluring? our aesthetic standards are too different, right? ”</p><p>Lu Ming wailed in his heart. He then pointed to the sky and swore that he already had a wife and even a child. Only then did the group of aunties let Lu Ming off, sighing in despair.</p><p>In the end, the eighth tribe threw a huge banquet to celebrate Lu Ming’s awakening of the green-armored ancient God Body.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed softly. The other party was so enthusiastic that he felt a little embarrassed. After all, he did not belong here and would leave sooner or later.</p><p>After three rounds of drinking.</p><p>“Lu Ming, now that you’ve awakened your ancient God Body, you should start cultivating the ancient God tactics. Only by cultivating the ancient God tactics will your ancient God Body level improve and become stronger,”</p><p>An elder said to Lu Ming.</p><p>This man was the patriarch of the eighth tribe.</p><p>“Ancient God tactic!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He had long heard of the ancient God tactic but he had never seen it.</p><p>that’s right. Only those who have cultivated the ancient God tactic can control the ancient God Body. Come with me.</p><p>The leader of the eighth tribe said, and then left in a certain direction.</p><p>Lu Ming followed.</p><p>Not long after, they came to a cave.</p><p>the ancient God tactic is inside. You can go in and study it.</p><p>The chief of the eighth tribe said.</p><p>“Thank you, chief!”</p><p>Lu Ming expressed his gratitude and walked into the cave.</p><p>Inside the cave was a huge cave with words carved on the walls.</p><p>This was the ancient God tactic.</p><p>Lu Ming began to study it carefully.</p><p>While Lu Ming was studying the ancient God tactic, the other nine tribes had sent people to the eighth tribe to find out more. When they learned that a descendant of an ascetic had awakened the green-armored ancient God Body in the eighth tribe, the ten major tribes of the ancient God descendants were all shocked.</p><p>Many experts flocked to the eighth tribe, hoping to meet Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was unaware of all of this. He was focused on comprehending the ancient God tactic.</p><p>Three months later, Lu Ming had almost fully comprehended the ancient God tactic. In the future, he just had to work hard and cultivate it.</p><p>although the ancient God Body can be upgraded, it’s too difficult to upgrade. The conditions to upgrade it are also extremely harsh.</p><p>After studying the ancient God tactic, Lu Ming understood that, in theory, cultivating the ancient God tactic would allow one’s ancient God Body to level up. However, it would be very difficult.</p><p>In reality, there weren’t many descendants of the ancient gods who could advance their ancient God Body by cultivating the ancient God tactic.</p><p>Lu Ming left the cave after he was almost done with his comprehension.</p><p>“Lu Ming has come out!”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming left the cave, the news spread throughout the eighth tribe.</p><p>Lu Ming had intended to return to his residence but he was stopped halfway.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s have a competition!”</p><p>Gu Ming stopped Lu Ming, his eyes filled with eagerness.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile. He was also looking for someone to test the power of the ancient God Body.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>Gu Ming soared into the sky. Lu Ming followed suit.</p><p>“Lu Ming and Gu Ming are going to spar again!”</p><p>The news that the two of them were going to spar quickly spread out. In the sky, many figures immediately appeared to watch the battle.</p><p>ancient God Body!</p><p>This time, Gu Ming was very direct. He used his ancient God Body and turned into an orange-armored ancient God that was more than twenty meters tall. He held a Mace and looked very majestic.</p><p>let’s try the power of the ancient God Body.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat as he activated the ancient God tactic.</p><p>His body quickly grew into a green-armored ancient God that was a hundred meters tall.</p><p>” heavens! It really is the green-armored ancient God! There’s no mistake!</p><p>“How terrifying!”</p><p>In the area, there were some people from other tribes who were shocked beyond imagination when they saw this.</p><p>“God critical strike!”</p><p>Gu Ming roared in anger and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>This was because Lu Ming’s body was constantly emitting the pressure of an ancient God. This pressure made him feel a sense of fear. This was the suppression of a superior against a lower-ranked.</p><p>He was afraid that if this continued, he would lose the courage to fight.</p><p>Therefore, he could only make the first move.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>A long spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hands and he swept it out.</p><p>Lu Ming did not activate the battle formula for this attack. He only used his divine power and the power of his ancient God Body.</p><p>A huge spear, as large as a mountain range, shot towards Gu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The spear and the mace collided with each other, shaking the world.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The long spear shook and a terrifying force burst out. Gu Ming’s body was thrown back thousands of miles away.</p><p>Lu Ming was like an adult who had sent a baby flying with a rod.</p><p>Gu Ming flew for more than a thousand miles before he stopped. His body trembled slightly, and his hands almost lost their grip on the mace.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>Gu Ming shouted and charged at Lu Ming again, using all his strength.</p><p>However, Lu Ming pulled out his spear and Gu Ming’s body was sent flying again.</p><p>Absolute suppression!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
