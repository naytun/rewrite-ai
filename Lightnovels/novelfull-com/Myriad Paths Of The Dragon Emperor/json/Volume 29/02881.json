The closer one was to the front, the stronger the domain.</p><p>Therefore, if he wanted to enter the mountain range, he would have to enter from the rear end. After entering the mountain range, the effect of the domain would be greatly reduced. This way, he could slowly go deeper into the mountain range along the mountain range.</p><p>Therefore, everyone entered the mountain range from the back.</p><p>Lu Ming’s group of eight flew in from the rear. As soon as they entered the desolate mountain range, Lu Ming felt a powerful domain acting on his body, almost dragging him down the mountain range.</p><p>They hurriedly circulated their divine power to resist the domains of the outside world and slowly descended to the ground.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>They had just landed when a loud roar rang out. It was a desolate beast.</p><p>In the desolate mountain range, there were also many wild beasts. Some of the wild beasts were very strong, but this wild beast only had the strength of a ninth stage true God.</p><p>a mere true God Realm, trying to sneak attack? you’re looking for death!</p><p>The seductive woman shouted coldly. A sword light flashed and cut the wild beast in half. Then, she glanced at Lu Ming coldly as if to say that it was useless to see it. True God-level experts were so vulnerable.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with this woman. In Lu Ming’s heart, this woman was an idiot.</p><p>Being ignored by Lu Ming, a cold glint flashed in the seductive woman’s eyes.</p><p>A mere true God actually dared to ignore her. He really didn’t know the immensity of heaven and earth.</p><p>“Follow me!”</p><p>Sanque said, and then walked in one direction.</p><p>The group followed sanque. Along the way, they were attacked by wild beasts from time to time. However, the level of the wild beasts here was not very high. Most of them were below the heavenly God Realm. There were not many of them who had reached the heavenly God Realm. They were not a threat to Lu Ming and the group and were easily killed.</p><p>Half a day later, they were millions of miles deep into the mountain range.</p><p>At this point, the domains of the desolate mountain range were already extremely astonishing. The pressure was getting greater and greater. At this point, let alone flying, even circulating divine power was somewhat difficult.</p><p>At this time, they came to a huge Valley.</p><p>At this point, sanque suddenly stopped.</p><p>“Sanque, why are you not moving? Do you even know where the heart of desolation is?”</p><p>One of the burly men asked.</p><p>“Hehehe!”</p><p>Sanque let out a few strange laughs and swept his gaze across Lu Ming and the rest of the seven people.”I don’t know where the heart of desolation is, but I do know that you’re going to die soon, hehe!”</p><p>Among the seven of them, apart from Lu Ming, everyone’s expression changed.</p><p>“Sanque, what do you mean? What are you trying to do?”</p><p>The seductive woman glared at sanque.</p><p>“What are you doing? It’s very simple, hand over all your treasures and I can leave your corpses intact. Otherwise, I can only feed you to the wild beasts.”</p><p>Sanque sneered.</p><p>sanque, you brought us here with ill intentions indeed. However, it’s a little ridiculous that you think you can kill us.</p><p>One of the burly men was much calmer than before. He spoke coldly and emitted a powerful aura.</p><p>Fourth level celestial deity!</p><p>This burly man was a fourth-level celestial deity realm, even higher than sanque’s third-level celestial deity realm.</p><p>The burly man’s powerful aura pressed down on sanque, but sanque’s expression did not change at all. In fact, the killing intent in its eyes became even stronger.</p><p>“All of you, come out!”</p><p>Sanque called out.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>As sanque’s voice rang out, a few figures suddenly rushed out of the valley.</p><p>There were a total of eleven figures. They moved at an astonishing speed, like a stream of light. In a few flashes, they had surrounded Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Sanque, you … You set up an ambush here, you tricked us!”</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The seductive woman, the burly man, and the others all shouted with a crazed expression.</p><p>At this time, no matter how stupid they were, they also understood what was going on.</p><p>When sanque asked them to form a team, it was a complete trap. He had already planned to let the others lie in ambush here to kill and steal.</p><p>They had been tricked.</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was very calm. However, when he saw one of the burly men, a murderous intent flashed in his eyes.</p><p>The burly man was the one who attacked Lu Ming’s warship from the starry sky battleship.</p><p>At that time, Lu Ming did not pay much attention to it. He did not expect to meet this burly man again. Moreover, he was robbing him with sanque and the rest. He had to admit that enemies were really bound to meet on a narrow road.</p><p>“Hand over all your treasures so we don’t have to do it ourselves,”</p><p>Sanque sneered.</p><p>However, no one had moved. Who would hand over their treasures so easily?</p><p>“Why are you talking so much nonsense with them? Just kill them directly to avoid any more trouble.”</p><p>The burly man who had attacked Lu Ming earlier shouted coldly, exuding a powerful aura.</p><p>This burly man also had a fourth level celestial deity cultivation.</p><p>In reality, there were a total of six fourth level celestial deity existences in this group.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming and the rest only had a fourth level celestial deity. The difference was too great.</p><p>“You want me to hand over the treasure? dream on!”</p><p>On Lu Ming’s side, the fourth-level celestial deity existence roared loudly and burst out with all his strength, charging to the side.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>He punched out, and his aura exploded, crushing forward. He wanted to kill a Path of Blood and escape.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>A few experts from the other side shouted coldly and attacked the burly man at the same time.</p><p>These few people were all fourth level celestial deity powerhouses. They joined forces to charge towards that burly man, displaying a terrifying killing move.</p><p>It was impossible to fight against three people alone. Two of their attacks landed on the burly man’s body. The burly man let out a blood-curdling scream and was sent flying. He spat out a large mouthful of blood and was already half-dead.</p><p>The seductive woman and the others ‘faces were as white as snow, without a trace of blood.</p><p>The strongest among them had almost been killed in one move. They had even less hope now.</p><p>Many people revealed looks of despair.</p><p>“Brother sanque, brothers, as long as you don’t kill me, I’ll give you anything you want.”</p><p>The seductive woman had a charming smile on her face. She swayed her slender waist and looked at sanque and the others with her charming eyes.</p><p>“Bitch, get lost! This move of yours is ineffective against us. Attack and kill them.”</p><p>Sanque shouted coldly.</p><p>In their line of work, they would never leave anyone alive, no matter how coquettish the seductive woman was.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Sanque and the others immediately attacked.</p><p>“Brat, I’ll be the first to send you on your way!”</p><p>Sanque’s eyes glowed coldly as he stared at Lu Ming. He was the first to charge at Lu Ming. His blood-red Claws were aimed at Lu Ming’s heart.</p><p>However, after a cold light flashed, sanque’s body froze. His eyes were wide open, revealing a look of disbelief.</p><p>His heart had been pierced by a spear.</p><p>This long spear was naturally thrust by Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
