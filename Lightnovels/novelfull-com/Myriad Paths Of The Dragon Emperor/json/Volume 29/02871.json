After all, he was here to help Ouyang Qingxiang. Therefore, he gave all the planet Devourer heads to Ouyang Qingxiang.</p><p>Not far from Zhi Zun Dong, the storage ring on Ouyang Qingxiang’s hand glowed. Then, the heads of the planet devourers flew out.</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang started by taking out 101 bronze-grade planet Devourer heads.</p><p>“So many …”</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>101 bronze-level heads would give him 101 points.</p><p>101 points. By the way, didn’t you just say that Holy Son Lu Ming and the others won’t have more than 100 points? ”</p><p>Someone spoke and looked at the person who said that Lu Ming’s group would definitely not have more than a hundred points. That person’s face immediately turned red and he was extremely ashamed.</p><p>Hmph, I’ve only just reached 100 points. It’s not even the lowest point.</p><p>That person said stubbornly.</p><p>It wasn’t just the others. Even the Supreme Holy son’s expression changed. However, when he saw that the 101 planet devourers ‘heads were bronze-grade, he let out a sigh of relief.</p><p>there are quite a number of them, but they’re all bronze-level ones. I’m guessing that you’ve been hunting bronze-level devourers all this while. That’s right. With your abilities and Lu Ming’s, even if you join forces, you might not be a match for a Silver Planet Devourer. You can only kill bronze-level planet devourers.“</p><p>The Supreme Holy Son laughed.</p><p>The sacred son of reflection and the others nodded.</p><p>They thought so too because they knew how terrifying the silver-grade planet Devourer was. Even if they were to face a silver-grade planet Devourer, they would need four people to work together to kill it. Even if Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang worked together, they would not be able to kill the silver-grade planet Devourer. They would only be able to kill the bronze-grade planet Devourer.</p><p>If he focused on killing the bronze-level planet devourers, he could still kill 101 bronze-level planet devourers in three months if he was lucky.</p><p>“We didn’t manage to kill a silver-tier planet Devourer? Who told you about the Supreme universe? You’re taking it for granted, I’m not done taking them.”</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang smiled faintly and waved her hand again.</p><p>Swoosh Swoosh Swoosh …</p><p>Silver Planet Devourer heads flew out.</p><p>There were twenty of them.</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming and the rest had killed a total of twenty silver-level devourers. It was two more than the Supreme Holy son’s eighteen.</p><p>Many people’s eyes popped out and they were dumbfounded.</p><p>The fact that Ouyang Xiangxiang could take out 20 silver-grade planet devourers ‘heads at one go was beyond everyone’s expectations.</p><p>“How is this possible?”</p><p>The floating light Saint son, zhixia Saint son, Yan Kong Saint son, and Xue Tan Saint daughter all widened their eyes in disbelief.</p><p>They had worked hard, and the four of them had only managed to kill 12 Silver Planet devourers. They thought that they had done their best.</p><p>They could still accept the fact that the Supreme Holy Son had killed more than them. However, Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang had killed so many. Their self-esteem had taken a huge blow.</p><p>The Supreme Holy son’s expression turned ugly.</p><p>He had never expected this outcome.</p><p>“What do you think, Supreme universe?”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang looked at the Supreme Holy Son and said.</p><p>Now that she had a breakthrough in her cultivation and Lu Ming’s combat strength had soared to a shocking level, she was much more confident when facing the Supreme Saint.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>The Supreme Saint snorted coldly and said with a gloomy face, ” not bad. You guys managed to kill twenty Silver Planet devourers. That’s beyond my expectations … Wait a minute, Ouyang Qingxiang, so you’ve made a breakthrough in your cultivation. No wonder …”</p><p>The Supreme saint’s eyes glowed with a dense divine light as he stared at Ouyang Xiangxiang. After carefully sizing her up, he could finally tell that Ouyang Xiangxiang’s cultivation had broken through. She was no longer a fourth-level heavenly God but a fifth-level heavenly God.</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang has broken through!</p><p>The expressions of the sacred son of reflection and the others also darkened. Ouyang Qingxiang had broken through and reached the fifth-level heavenly deity realm. They had another powerful enemy.</p><p>“Ouyang Xiangxiang, so what if you’ve broken through? You’re still far from being able to compete with me. Also, your points in the first round were only 201 points. You couldn’t even beat me in the first round, so you’ll have no chance in the second round …”</p><p>The Supreme Holy Son said confidently.</p><p>“Supreme universe, how did you know that I only have 201 points?”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang waited for the Paragon Holy Son to finish speaking before speaking again.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>what? ” the Supreme Holy son’s expression turned serious. don’t tell me you still have the planet Devourer’s head that you haven’t taken out? ”</p><p>“You’ve become smarter this time. Open your eyes wide and watch.”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang said. With a wave of her hand, rays of golden light burst forth. Then, Golden Planet Devourer heads appeared in the sky.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang took out all 14 of the gold planet devourers ‘heads.</p><p>Silence!</p><p>The scene suddenly fell into a dead silence.</p><p>When they saw Ouyang Xiangxiang take out the head of the gold planet Devourer, everyone was dumbfounded. They were completely stunned.</p><p>Even the elders who had seen great storms and waves, and even the sect master of the Kong Xuan sect, long zhousan, were the same.</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang’s act of taking out 14 gold planet devourers ‘heads was also beyond their expectations.</p><p>As for the floating light Saint son, the Supreme Saint son, and the others, they were completely dumbfounded.</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a faint smile.</p><p>He knew that Ouyang Qingxiang did it on purpose. She deliberately took them out one by one to slap the Supreme Holy Son in the face.</p><p>a woman’s desire for revenge is very strong. As long as she gets the chance, she will definitely seek revenge to the death …</p><p>Lu Ming muttered in his heart.</p><p>“Alright, hahaha …”</p><p>At this moment, a laugh was heard. It was Ouyang Qingxiang’s grandfather. He was the first to react and burst into laughter.</p><p>At this time, everyone seemed to wake up from a dream.</p><p>the heads of 14 gold-tier planet devourers? this is impossible. Ouyang Qingxiang, how did you get them? ”</p><p>The Supreme Holy Son roared.</p><p>He still found it hard to believe.</p><p>He knew how terrifying the gold-grade planet Devourer was.</p><p>In these three months, he had fought many gold-grade planet devourers and had fierce battles. Although his strength could suppress a gold-grade planet Devourer, it was not much stronger. It was very difficult to kill a gold-grade planet Devourer.</p><p>He had injured several gold-tier planet devourers, but they all escaped.</p><p>Later on, he was lucky and used the terrain to trap a gold-grade planet Devourer to death.</p><p>But now, Ouyang Qingxiang had taken out the heads of 14 gold planet devourers. He would not believe it even if he was beaten to death.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
