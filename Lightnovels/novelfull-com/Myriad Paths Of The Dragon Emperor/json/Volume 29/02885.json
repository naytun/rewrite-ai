The difference is too great. We have no fate with the heart of desolation.</p><p>I guess only many heaven’s favorites can open the yuan Qi day-to-day!</p><p>Many people sighed. Some people glanced at Lu Ming and ignored him.</p><p>Lu Ming was the only one who had not made a move. However, the crowd had already lost all hope.</p><p>It was already a miracle that Lu Ming, a true God-level person, could make it this far. It would be considered good if he could activate even one pillar of primordial Qi.</p><p>Even if Lu Ming was young and had good talent, there was not a glimmer of hope for the remaining seven hundred or so.</p><p>“Forget it!”</p><p>Someone shook his head, withdrew his divine power, and retreated a dozen steps.</p><p>Following that, the others shook their heads, retracted their divine power, and retreated. The pillars of vital Qi also disappeared.</p><p>However, no one left, because they were somewhat unwilling.</p><p>this is interesting. I wonder how many pillars of vital Qi I can trigger if I go forward? ”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart and revealed a trace of interest. He then stepped forward.</p><p>The moment Lu Ming moved, many people’s gazes turned to him.</p><p>this kid still wants to go up. We’ve already failed, and he still wants to go up. Is he an idiot? ”</p><p>but Speaking of which, it’s not easy for this kid to come here with his true God Realm cultivation. He might be a genius!</p><p>no matter how much of a genius he is, how many pillars of vitality can he activate? ten, twenty, even if he can activate a hundred, it won’t help.</p><p>that’s right. Guess how many Yuan Qi pillars this kid can activate? ”</p><p>“How many? He’s so young, yet he’s able to reach this stage with such cultivation. His talent is definitely not weak. I’m guessing he can activate at least ten Yuan Qi pillars.”</p><p>ten, maybe more. I’m guessing between twenty and thirty!</p><p>“Twenty to thirty? That’s too much. We only have six at most.”</p><p>The crowd discussed animatedly and began to guess how many pillars of vital Qi Lu Ming would be able to activate.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he had already walked to the bottom of the pillar of vital Qi. He stretched out his palm and placed it on the vital Qi morning and evening. His divine power slowly surged into the vital Qi morning and evening.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The vital Qi of day and night suddenly shook violently. Then, pillars of vital Qi formed and danced in the air.</p><p>Thirty-six lines!</p><p>The moment Lu Ming infused his divine power, he activated 36 pillars of vital Qi.</p><p>“This … So many?”</p><p>The others were shocked.</p><p>Just now, some people guessed that Lu Ming would be able to trigger between twenty to thirty veins. Some people felt that they had guessed too much and it would be difficult for Lu Ming to do it.</p><p>He did not expect that Lu Ming would be able to activate 36 pillars of vital Qi in an instant.</p><p>However, this was not the end. Following that, the vital Qi trembled even more violently, creating a loud rumbling sound like a huge wave.</p><p>Hua Hua Hua …</p><p>As the vital Qi continued to flow, more pillars of vital Qi burst out. This time, there were a total of 360 pillars.</p><p>In addition to the previous 36, there were a total of 396.</p><p>Si si si …</p><p>The crowd gasped. Everyone’s eyes were about to pop out, and they were speechless.</p><p>396 pillars. Everyone looked at the 390 pillars of vital Qi dancing in the air and thought they were dreaming.</p><p>my God, there are 396 of them. How is this possible? how is this possible? how can he trigger so many Yuan Qi pillars? ”</p><p>unbelievable, monstrous, monstrous. This man is a peerless genius. If three people like him came, they would be able to break through the yuan Qi morning and evening.</p><p>Some people shouted in shock.</p><p>The number of Yuan Qi pillars that Lu Ming had activated alone was more than the number of Yuan Qi pillars that the eighty of them had activated together.</p><p>However, their shock was far from over.</p><p>Thump thump thump …</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming’s ancient God heart started to thump loudly. Waves of ancient God aura flowed into Lu Ming’s palm and into his vital Qi.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The vital Qi in the sky began to vibrate again. Then, pillars of vital Qi flew out.</p><p>This time, more than 300 yuan Qi pillars were formed.</p><p>In total, there were seven hundred of them.</p><p>“Still … Also …”</p><p>The others were completely dumbfounded. They were completely stunned.</p><p>Seven hundred, a total of seven hundred!</p><p>In history, the most powerful genius had only triggered slightly more than a hundred blood veins. How was it possible that Lu Ming had triggered seven hundred blood veins?</p><p>How could there be such a powerful heaven’s favorite in the world?</p><p>The other eighty people thought that they had seen the world, but at this moment, they all felt like country bumpkins, people who had come from a poor and remote place and had not seen the world.</p><p>“Seven hundred, this should be the limit!”</p><p>The white-haired old man from before swallowed hard. His eyes were wide open, and his heart was thumping.</p><p>However, the next moment, he almost fell to the ground.</p><p>That was because the vibration of the vital Qi had not stopped. Instead, it was vibrating even more violently.</p><p>“Could it be … Could it be that it can activate a pillar of vital Qi?”</p><p>Some people said in a hoarse voice.</p><p>seven hundred is not enough. Let’s try the battle formula.</p><p>A glint flashed across Lu Ming’s eyes. He then started to activate the battle character formula.</p><p>Lu Ming’s comprehension of the battle formula was getting more and more profound. Now, he had a fifty percent success rate of activating the battle formula and multiplying his combat power by four.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body exuded a powerful fighting spirit. Waves of powerful energy burst out from his body.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The vital Qi shook even more violently, and then, pillars of vital Qi rushed out.</p><p>This time, a few hundred Yuan Qi pillars rushed out, filling the sky with Yuan Qi pillars.</p><p>The number of Yuan Qi pillars had reached 999.</p><p>The number of vital Qi pillars required to open vital Qi day and night was 999.</p><p>heavens! He alone has activated 999 pillars of vital Qi. This is too shocking.</p><p>“This is unbelievable!”</p><p>The crowd was almost scared to death.</p><p>At this moment, the vital Qi trembled violently, rolling up a wave of vital Qi that filled the sky. A terrifying roar was heard, and cracks appeared on the vital Qi.</p><p>“It’s about to open, the vital energy is about to open!”</p><p>“The heart of desolation is about to be born!”</p><p>Many people shouted, their eyes burning with passion.</p><p>This time, it was really beyond everyone’s expectations. They originally thought that it was impossible to open the yuan Qi at this time. They had to wait until the news spread out and the geniuses of the major forces of the Qin heaven star region gathered before they could open it. They never thought that they could open it now.</p><p>“Hahaha, the heart of desolation is destined to be mine.”</p><p>A seventh level celestial deity expert roared loudly in his heart, his eyes burning.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had activated 999 pillars of vital Qi, in his opinion, Lu Ming was only talented. His cultivation and combat strength were nothing in his eyes.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
