At the same time, a crescent-shaped spear radiance also slashed at the black-robed elder.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The nine-clawed Divine Dragon and the crescent-shaped spear radiance struck the black palm print, causing a violent boom and shaking at the same time.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The nine-clawed Divine Dragon Dharma and the crescent-shaped spear radiance shattered almost at the same time. The terrifying palm force surged out and hit Lu Ming. Lu Ming groaned and retreated. Cracks appeared on The Crimson Gold armor that protected his body. Lu Ming spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current cultivation, he could fight a fourth-level celestial deity in a great battle under normal circumstances. However, there was still a huge gap between him and a sixth-level celestial deity.</p><p>“Now, let’s see what other methods you have. Die!”</p><p>The black-robed elder spoke coldly and led the two fifth-level celestial deity powerhouses to continue charging towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming pushed his speed to the limit. Other than his ancient God Body, he used all means he had to resist, but it was useless. He was still badly injured and he kept spitting out blood.</p><p>“Kid, I wanted to cripple you, but now I’ve changed my mind. I’m going to kill you.”</p><p>The black-robed elder sneered. The distance between him and Lu Ming was less than a hundred miles. To people of their cultivation, a hundred miles was no different from a meter.</p><p>He slashed out with his saber, wanting to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>“Now.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered with a cold light.</p><p>He had been waiting for this opportunity.</p><p>The black-robed elder had already relaxed. He thought that this was all Lu Ming could do.</p><p>In reality, the fact that an eighth-stage true God could burst out with such combat power had already shocked the black-robed elder and the rest. They did not think that Lu Ming had any other means.</p><p>Lu Ming was waiting for the other party to relax and underestimate him.</p><p>Otherwise, even if he had used his ancient God Body from the start, he might not have been able to kill a sixth level celestial deity expert.</p><p>What he wanted was to be caught off guard and kill in one blow.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming circulated the ancient God tactic.</p><p>His body expanded and he turned into a green-armored ancient God.</p><p>“This … This was … A descendant of an ancient God?”</p><p>impossible! How could he be a descendant of an ancient God? ”</p><p>The black-robed elder and the other two were stunned. They would not have been so shocked even if Lu Ming had used other means.</p><p>However, wasn’t lu Ming from the Qin heaven Star Zone? How could he become an ancient God?</p><p>They were stunned, and it was this moment of shock that decided their life and death.</p><p>“Moon slaying!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared and swept his spear.</p><p>A huge spear light swept toward the black-robed elder.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The other party roared and finally reacted. It was too late to Dodge.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The black-robed elder was killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>A sixth-level celestial deity powerhouse was killed by Lu Ming with one shot in a state of underestimation and confusion.</p><p>After that, the two fifth-level heavenly deity existences finally reacted and retreated rapidly.</p><p>However, how could Lu Ming let them leave?</p><p>The long spear pressed down and charged towards the two of them.</p><p>When Lu Ming used his ancient God Body, his combat strength was enough to fight a sixth-level celestial God. Naturally, it would not be difficult for him to deal with a fifth-level celestial God.</p><p>In addition, the other party was flustered and had no intention to fight. He was crushed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming was a hundred meters tall. He looked up and roared like an ancient God that had been reborn. The terrifying ancient God’s might filled the air, making the two of them tremble in fear.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>One of them was swept by Lu Ming’s long spear and directly exploded in the air.</p><p>“Help!”</p><p>The remaining fifth level heavenly deity powerhouse was almost scared out of his wits as he rushed towards that old man who was fighting with QiuQiu with all his might.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>The old man was also trembling with fear. This scene was completely out of his expectations.</p><p>He was careless and almost got cut by QiuQiu, so he hurriedly blocked it.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold voice was heard. His huge figure seemed to follow the long spear, turning into a spear ray and piercing out.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>That fifth-level celestial deity was pierced through by Lu Ming’s spear and stabbed in the air.</p><p>In this way, the old man from before was the only one left.</p><p>“Damn it, get lost, get lost …”</p><p>The old man was almost scared to death. He frantically attacked QiuQiu, wanting to force QiuQiu back and escape.</p><p>However, QiuQiu’s body was like liquid metal. It was ever-changing, strange, and unpredictable. Its ability to entangle people was even stronger than his battle prowess, and it firmly entangled the old man.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had already arrived.</p><p>“I’ll send you on your way.”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his long spear and joined forces with QiuQiu to besiege the old man.</p><p>There was no longer any suspense in this battle.</p><p>Regardless of whether it was QiuQiu or Lu Ming, they could fight the old man alone. With the two of them joining forces, the old man’s fate was already decided.</p><p>The old man resisted more than ten moves with all his might. Finally, QiuQiu seized the opportunity and a bolt of lightning struck the top of his skull. Then, Lu Ming swept his spear out and killed the old man completely.</p><p>“Let’s go, we’re leaving!”</p><p>Lu Ming put away the storage rings of the five people from the unique devil Academy and left the place quickly with QiuQiu.</p><p>Lu Ming had to rush back to the tribe of the ancient God descendants to inform them of the news.</p><p>From the information that he had just understood, Lu Ming came to a conclusion. The door to the exit had not been opened.</p><p>Lu Ming headed south and finally returned to the eighth tribe after seven days.</p><p>“Lu Ming is back!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s return caused a commotion.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re finally back. Haha, it seems like you’ve become stronger. If this goes on, I’m afraid I won’t be your match for long.”</p><p>When Gu Hongshan saw Lu Ming, he patted Lu Ming’s shoulder and laughed. He looked relieved.</p><p>He was very worried about Lu Ming going to the northern wilderness demon field.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart felt warm. He quickly said, ” where’s the clan leader? I have something important to discuss with the clan leader.</p><p>“Important matter? Come with me. ”</p><p>Gu Hongshan nodded and led Lu Ming into the tribe. Not long after, they saw the eighth tribe’s chief in a huge stone house.</p><p>The leader of the eighth tribe smiled, ” “Lu Ming, you said that you have something urgent to tell me. What’s the matter?”</p><p>clan leader, I discovered a big secret in the northern wilderness demon field. The outsiders have allied with the monsters and demons of the northern wilderness demon field and are attacking the ten tribes together.</p><p>Lu Ming told him the news he had heard in detail.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The patriarch of the eighth tribe, Gu Hongshan, and the others were all shocked.</p><p>“Lu Ming, is what you said true?”</p><p>The leader of the eighth tribe said with a serious expression.</p><p>“It’s absolutely true. I heard it from a few outsiders.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Quick, spread this news to the other nine tribes. Also, call back all the clansmen who have been training outside and prepare for battle.”</p><p>The leader of the eighth tribe was extremely decisive, immediately giving the order.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Gu Hongshan and the other higher-ups accepted the order and left to make arrangements.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
