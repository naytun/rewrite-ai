The Luo residence had already turned into a sea of fire and had been trampled flat.</p><p>All the experts of the Luo family had been killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming would not show any mercy to this evil family.</p><p>In the Luo family’s core Treasury, Lu Ming successfully found an evil eye stone.</p><p>The evil eye stone was the Luo family’s clan treasure, and it was easy to find.</p><p>In this way, only the last type of ‘desolate grass’ was left.</p><p>The desolate grass was found in the desolate mountain range where the stellar River was.</p><p>This was an extremely special mountain range. This mountain range wasn’t located on a certain planet. Instead, it was the entire mountain range, floating in the universe.</p><p>The mountain range was incomparably huge, and there were extremely terrifying domains on it. No matter what creature entered, it would be difficult for them to fly and would suffer great pressure.</p><p>However, the desolate mountains were rich in resources and had many precious divine herbs.</p><p>The desolate grass was an extremely rare and precious Divine Grass. Even in the desolate mountain range, it was very rare and valuable. It was a treasure that could not be bought with money.</p><p>Therefore, many cultivators would come here to explore and search for treasures.</p><p>Lu Ming sat on the starry sky warship and flew in the vast starry sky. A huge mountain range appeared in front of him.</p><p>From a distance, it looked like a giant dragon was circling in the universe.</p><p>“The vast universe is truly wondrous …”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming noticed that there were streams of light flying toward the desolate mountains from other directions like meteors.</p><p>Of course, these weren’t meteors, but experts.</p><p>Some of them sat on the space battleships, while others flew.</p><p>To be able to use one’s body to travel through the universe, one had to be at least a heavenly God.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>All of a sudden, a figure flew rapidly from behind Lu Ming’s warship. It was a burly man. He was very strong and muscular. He had a ferocious look.</p><p>“Get lost, you’re just like an ant. Don’t block the way.”</p><p>When the burly man passed by Lu Ming, he struck his palm at Lu Ming’s interplanetary warship.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The starry sky battleship was hit, and it trembled violently before flying out.</p><p>“Hahaha …”</p><p>The burly man laughed, glanced at Lu Ming in disdain, and then left.</p><p>In his opinion, a person on an interplanetary warship was most likely below the level of a heavenly God. He didn’t care at all.</p><p>“This guy …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze turned cold as he watched the burly man leave. In the end, he did not make a move.</p><p>He continued to control the Starship and flew towards the desolate mountain range.</p><p>“Why are there so many people?”</p><p>Lu Ming sized up his surroundings and revealed a strange look.</p><p>Outside the huge desolate mountain range, there were many experts of different races floating in the air. The number was shocking. At a glance, there were no less than ten thousand people.</p><p>In the past, although there were people who came to the desolate mountain range to search for treasures, there were never this many people.</p><p>As they neared the desolate mountains, Lu Ming left the starry sky battleship and floated in the starry sky.</p><p>“Senior, may I ask what happened here? Why are there so many people?”</p><p>Lu Ming came to the side of a white-haired elder and asked with cupped fists.</p><p>The others were not too surprised.</p><p>Stage nine true God Realm experts could already stay in the universe for a period of time. However, they couldn’t cross the universe and fly from one planet to another.</p><p>“You don’t know?”</p><p>The old man looked at Lu Ming in surprise.</p><p>“I don’t know!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head.</p><p>“There’s no harm in telling you. Recently, I heard that the heart of desolation has appeared in the desolate mountain range. That’s why so many people have been attracted here. These people are all here to find the heart of desolation.”</p><p>The old man smiled, looking very familiar.</p><p>“The heart of desolation?”</p><p>Lu Ming had a puzzled look on his face. He had never heard of the heart of desolation.</p><p>“The heart of desolation! There’s actually a heart of desolation here! Hahaha! The heavens are on my side! No, the heavens are on your side! Lu Ming, you must get the heart of desolation! The heart of desolation can completely replace the desolation grass, and its effects are several times better. The formation disks refined from it will be even more powerful. That way, our chances of success will be greater.”</p><p>After hearing about the heart of desolation, bone laughed out loud in excitement.</p><p>“It’s actually several times better than the desolate grass!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with intense anticipation.</p><p>He had to succeed in dealing with Dragon Boat Mountain this time. Therefore, he had to obtain the heart of desolation.</p><p>“Young man, there are a lot of experts here. I can see that you’re only at the peak of true God Realm. How about we form a team and go into the desolate mountain range to explore?”</p><p>The old man suggested.</p><p>“Form a team?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>that’s right. Look, the others are also forming teams. I’m afraid it’ll be very dangerous to enter the mountain range alone.</p><p>The old man pointed to the front.</p><p>Lu Ming looked ahead. There were already many people entering the desolate mountain range. They were all in groups of three to five.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment and nodded.</p><p>This elder’s cultivation was only at the third-level celestial deity realm. Lu Ming did not think much of him.</p><p>However, the desolate mountain range was extremely huge. If he were to search for the heart of desolation alone, it would undoubtedly be like looking for a needle in a haystack. If he were to form a team with others, at least the chances of finding the heart of desolation would be higher.</p><p>that’s great. Then let’s find some more people and form a team to go in.</p><p>The old man smiled and then went to greet the others.</p><p>Not long after, the old man found another six people to form a team.</p><p>The six of them were all at heavenly God-level cultivation. Lu Ming was the only true God-level.</p><p>sanque, why did you find a true God Realm expert to go with us? if such a person goes in, wouldn’t he be a burden to us? ”</p><p>A woman in her thirties cast a cold glance at Lu Ming and said unhappily.</p><p>This woman had an extremely seductive look and an amazing figure. However, she had an arrogant look on her face and looked down on Lu Ming.</p><p>“This little brother is a friend of mine. Everyone, please give this old man some face and let this little brother come along.”</p><p>The old man’s name was sanque, and he said with a smile.</p><p>since he’s your friend, sanque, I can give him face. But I have to say this first. After entering the desolate mountain range, if we encounter any danger, I won’t care about him. We can’t be dragged down by a true God Realm trash.</p><p>The seductive woman said.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. He could not be bothered to argue with the other party.</p><p>This woman was only a first level celestial deity. Who knew what kind of mentality she had, looking down on a true God Realm expert.</p><p>The rest of them only cast an indifferent glance at Lu Ming and ignored him.</p><p>To them, it was just a real God and they didn’t need to care about him. If they were in danger, they could just abandon him.</p><p>“Good, good, good!”</p><p>Sanque laughed apologetically.</p><p>The Group of Eight then flew towards the desolate mountain range.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
