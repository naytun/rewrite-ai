Lu Ming had also witnessed the power of the ancient God Body. He returned to his residence and waited patiently.</p><p>Seven days later, the blood pool was officially opened.</p><p>Lu Ming, along with more than 20 youths from the eighth tribe, followed a few elders to a huge stone Hall.</p><p>In addition to them, there were many people from the eighth tribe gathered outside the stone Hall. They were all here to watch.</p><p>“Blood pool, open!”</p><p>An old man shouted.</p><p>Then, a few elders stepped forward and formed strange runes in their hands. The runes flew towards the door of the stone Hall. The door opened with a rumble, revealing a pitch-black entrance.</p><p>go in. Remember, do your best. The longer you stay in the blood pool, the more bloodline power you can absorb and the stronger your ancient God Body will be.</p><p>An old man warned.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The twenty-odd young men nodded in unison and walked toward the gate.</p><p>Lu Ming was among them. When they entered the door, the door closed with a rumble.</p><p>When the door closed, it glowed and an image appeared above the door. It was the image of Lu Ming and the others in the stone Hall.</p><p>They were outside and could see everything that was happening inside. This was also the reason why so many people had come to watch.</p><p>I wonder how many people will be able to awaken the ancient God Body this time.</p><p>about half. Every time, it’s about half. I hope there’ll be more this time.</p><p>” let’s hope someone awakens the orange-armored ancient God Body.</p><p>I wonder what level of ancient God Body Lu Ming will awaken? ”</p><p>he has condensed the ancient God’s heart and has at least an orange-armored ancient God Body. It’s not impossible for him to awaken a yellow-armored ancient God Body.</p><p>the yellow-armored ancient God Body. Once it awakens, your future will be limitless.</p><p>Many people were watching and discussing.</p><p>After Lu Ming and the group entered the stone Hall, they saw a pitch-black passage. They followed the passage and walked for a hundred miles. The light in front of them brightened. They had actually come to a huge space. This space was brightly lit and there was a small lake on the ground.</p><p>The lake water was blood-red in color, and a terrifying energy rippled out.</p><p>is this the blood pool? it’s a Lake!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>“Let’s go in. Remember, we’ll hold on for as long as we can. There’s only one chance, so we have to seize it.”</p><p>Gu Zhuo warned the others.</p><p>Everyone nodded, then slowly walked down to the blood pool.</p><p>Lu Ming also stepped into the blood pool.</p><p>As soon as he stepped into the blood pool, a powerful and strange force rushed toward Lu Ming. It seeped through his skin and gushed into his ancient God heart.</p><p>“This is … The aura of an ancient God!”</p><p>Lu Ming could feel that the energy that surged into the blood pool had a rich ancient God aura.</p><p>Lu Ming quickened his pace and soon, his entire body was submerged in the lake. More energy from all directions rushed towards Lu Ming and gushed into the ancient God’s heart.</p><p>The ancient God’s heart started to thump. With the influx of energy, the ancient God’s heart beat even more fiercely. It even took the initiative to burst out a force and absorb the energy from the outside world.</p><p>Outside the stone Hall, everyone waited quietly.</p><p>About three hours later.</p><p>Huala!</p><p>The lake water churned as a young man rushed out of the water and landed on the shore, gasping for breath.</p><p>“I … We failed!”</p><p>The young man’s eyes were filled with disappointment and loneliness.</p><p>he hadn’t even awakened his ancient God Body, and he already couldn’t handle the energy of the blood pool. This meant that he had failed.</p><p>The blood pool had a mysterious energy. Each person could only enter it once. If they entered it a second time, they would be ejected by a force.</p><p>If he didn’t succeed this time, he would never be able to awaken the ancient God Body again.</p><p>“Gu Feng has failed. Sigh, although I knew beforehand that the chances of him succeeding were very low, I still held onto a sliver of hope. Unfortunately …”</p><p>Outside the stone Hall, someone sighed. It was Gu Feng’s family.</p><p>Gu Feng’s failure was only the beginning. Following this, more and more people failed and more and more people charged out of the blood pool.</p><p>Once one entered the blood pool, a powerful force would pour into the body. When the force accumulated enough, it could even burst the body.</p><p>Therefore, many people couldn’t bear it.</p><p>This was a test of one’s willpower and the concentration of the ancient God bloodline. The higher the concentration of the ancient God bloodline, the more energy could be absorbed.</p><p>Just like Lu Ming, the ancient God’s heart kept absorbing the energy and he did not feel any pressure at all.</p><p>As time passed, more and more people failed. Half a day later, half of the people had failed.</p><p>The people who had failed all had ugly expressions and sighed.</p><p>The people outside the stone Hall became nervous.</p><p>Anyone who could stay in the blood pool for half a day had a high chance of awakening the ancient God Body.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Suddenly, a huge roar came from a certain direction of the blood pool. Blood waves churned and formed a vortex.</p><p>At the same time, a huge figure appeared in the air.</p><p>This figure was not a real entity, but a Phantom.</p><p>This was a real ancient God’s shadow.</p><p>The ancient God apparition raised its head and gave a long howl, exuding an aura of supremacy.</p><p>Then, a loud roar came from under the lake. Then, a young man’s figure appeared. His body began to swell. He was originally two meters tall, but he quickly grew to three or four meters.</p><p>Red scales also appeared on the surface of his body.</p><p>Someone had succeeded in awakening the Scarlet-armored ancient God Body.</p><p>In the end, the young man stopped growing when he was eight meters tall.</p><p>as his cultivation increased, he would reach a higher height when he transformed into an ancient God Body.</p><p>At this time, the ancient God’s shadow in the sky also disappeared. It turned into a ray of light and entered the young man’s body. The young man’s body began to shrink, returning to the size of a normal person. He landed on the shore with a smile on his face.</p><p>“Gu Tong, congratulations!”</p><p>congratulations on awakening the ancient God Body.</p><p>On the shore, those young men who had failed came over to congratulate him, all of them with envious expressions.</p><p>Outside the stone Hall, many people also revealed happy expressions.</p><p>With every new member of the tribe that awakened the ancient God Body, the eighth tribe would become stronger.</p><p>This young man’s success was like a prologue to success. Following that, more and more young men succeeded.</p><p>Two days later, a total of eleven young men and women awakened their ancient God bodies. However, they were all in red armor and not orange armor.</p><p>Two days later, there were only two people left in the blood pool.</p><p>One of them was Lu Ming, and the other was Gu Zhuo.</p><p>Gu Zhuo is extremely talented. I wonder if he’ll be able to awaken the orange-armored ancient God Body.</p><p>let’s see. If he can stay in the blood pool for three days, he might be able to awaken the orange-armored ancient God Body!</p><p>it’s hard to say. Gu Ming spent five days in the blood pool.</p><p>Outside the stone Hall, many people were looking on in anticipation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
