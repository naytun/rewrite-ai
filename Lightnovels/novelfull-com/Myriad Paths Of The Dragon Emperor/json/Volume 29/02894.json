At this moment, Lu Ming still had the upper hand.</p><p>Lu Ming had used all his techniques. After exchanging more than a dozen moves, Lu Ming had the upper hand. The Supreme Holy Son was no match for him and kept retreating.</p><p>“Quickly come and help me!”</p><p>The Supreme Holy Son roared.</p><p>Behind him, the floating light Saint son, the Zhi Xia Saint son, and the others also rushed up.</p><p>“Floating light, your opponent is me!”</p><p>die! Ouyang Qingxiang shouted coldly and charged toward the sacred son.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang and the sacred son of reflection were both at the fifth-level heavenly deity realm. The two of them were engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>As for Saint son Zhi Xia, Saint son Yan Kong, and Saint daughter Xue Tan, their cultivations were much weaker. Just as they rushed toward Lu Ming, they were swept away by Lu Ming’s spear and almost spat out blood.</p><p>They could not interfere in the battle between Lu Ming and the Supreme Holy Son.</p><p>After a few more moves, the Dragon claws of a nine-clawed Divine Dragon clawed on the Supreme Holy son’s body, leaving a few deep wounds on his body.</p><p>The Supreme Holy Son roared and punched the nine-clawed Divine Dragon Dharma laksana to pieces.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had the ” measure ” formula. Divine power gushed into his body continuously. Three nine-clawed divine Dragons were formed once again.</p><p>There were still nine ice chains. Once they were destroyed, Lu Ming would condense them again, not caring about the consumption of divine power.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it! Lu Ming, just you wait …”</p><p>The Supreme Holy Son roared and turned to leave.</p><p>He knew that it was impossible for him to snatch the array plate back now that Lu Ming had it. It would be disadvantageous for him if the battle continued.</p><p>The Supreme Holy Son turned and left. The transient light Holy Son and the others didn’t dare to continue fighting. They hurriedly followed the Supreme Holy Son and ran away. They quickly broke out of the pangolin’s encirclement and left this place.</p><p>Lu Ming did not give chase.</p><p>Although his combat strength could suppress the Supreme Saint son, defeating and killing were two completely different things. It was impossible for him to kill the Supreme Saint son with his current strength.</p><p>“We’re leaving too!”</p><p>let’s go, ” Lu Ming said to Ouyang Qingxiang. Then, the two of them charged in another direction. After breaking out of the encirclement, they disappeared from this world.</p><p>More than a hundred thousand miles away, Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang found a place to rest.</p><p>Two days later, when the two of them had recovered to their peak condition, they continued their search on this planet.</p><p>Unfortunately, they searched this planet for a full seven to eight days without finding anything.</p><p>it seems like there’s only one array plate on this planet. Let’s go to other planets to take a look!</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang said.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go to that planet!”</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out his hand and pointed to the sky.</p><p>Above their heads, there was a fiery red Planet floating in the air. This planet was closer to the star.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang nodded. Immediately, the two of them shot into the sky and turned into two beams of light, flying toward the planet.</p><p>Not long after Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang left, five figures appeared in a secret place not far away. They were the Supreme Saint son, the transient light Saint son, and the others.</p><p>“What should we do now, Supreme universe?”</p><p>The sacred son of reflection asked.</p><p>“Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang must die!”</p><p>The Supreme Holy Son gritted his teeth as his eyes flashed with a sinister light.</p><p>“I’m afraid we can’t kill Lu Ming and the rest with our abilities!”</p><p>Holy maiden Xue Tan said.</p><p>if we can’t kill him, someone else can. Back in the land of the ancient God, Lu Ming killed the Holy Sons of the unique devil Academy and the immortal sword sect. Both of these forces want to get rid of Lu Ming!</p><p>The Supreme Holy Son said coldly.</p><p>“You want to kill with a borrowed knife?”</p><p>The eyes of the sacred son and the others lit up.</p><p>that’s right. Right now, mo jiuye and the others from the unique demon Academy are on that pitch-black Planet. Let’s go there and inform Lu Ming of his whereabouts. Moreover, Lu Ming has an array plate on him. I believe that mo jiuye will definitely take action.</p><p>The Supreme Saint son said with a murderous aura. He glanced at the sacred son of reflection and the others and continued, ” “As long as Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang are dead, the Kong Xuan sect will still be mine. I promise that I will not mistreat you in the future!”</p><p>rather than letting the Kong Xuan sect fall into Lu Ming and Ouyang Xiangxiang’s hands in the future, it’s better to let you, the Supreme universe, make the decision. Let’s go, we’ll go find mo jiuye and the others.</p><p>The sacred son said.</p><p>The five of them immediately flew toward the pitch-black Planet where the unique devil Academy was located.</p><p>……</p><p>Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang did not spend much time and landed on the fiery red Planet.</p><p>The environment of this planet was even worse.</p><p>This planet’s gravity was stronger than the previous one, and the temperature was shockingly high. It was difficult for ordinary creatures to survive.</p><p>After the two of them arrived on this planet, they started searching everywhere.</p><p>“This is … Red mist gold!”</p><p>Not long after, they found a few pieces of strange metal.</p><p>Scarlet mist gold was an extremely rare material for forging weapons. It could be used to forge Supreme-grade divine weapons used by godkings and was extremely precious.</p><p>The two of them were overjoyed. What Dragon Boat Mountain said was right. In this Galaxy, there were indeed other treasures besides that array plate.</p><p>this metal is also very useful to QiuQiu. It will definitely be of great use to him if he swallows it.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming looked at the bracelet that QiuQiu had transformed into on his wrist.</p><p>Ever since QiuQiu had swallowed the bronze from the bronze altar in the ancient God World, it had been in a deep sleep. It still showed no signs of waking up.</p><p>There were two pieces of Crimson afterglow gold in total. Initially, they were going to split it evenly. Lu Ming wanted to buy it from Ouyang Xiangxiang with divine crystals, but Ouyang Xiangxiang shook her head and gave the Crimson afterglow gold to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stand on ceremony and kept it.</p><p>After that, they continued to search the planet and found many precious metal materials. Ouyang Qingxiang knew that these metal materials were very useful to Lu Ming and gave them all to him. She only took some divine crystals as a token.</p><p>While Lu Ming and the rest were searching the planet, the Supreme Saint and the transient light Saint had already found mo jiuye and the rest.</p><p>Supreme universe, you actually dare to take the initiative to find us. Aren’t you afraid that I’ll make a move and make you stay? ”</p><p>Mo jiuye sneered at the Supreme Holy Son and the others, killing intent flashing in his eyes.</p><p>The Supreme Saint son, the transient light Saint son, and the others ‘expressions changed slightly. However, they weren’t ordinary people and quickly calmed down.</p><p>mo jiuye, we’re not a threat to you at all. The real threat to you is Lu Ming!</p><p>The Supreme Saint said.</p><p>“Lu Ming? You think that kid is a threat to me?”</p><p>Mo jiuye’s eyes glinted coldly as he revealed a strong sense of confidence.</p><p>that’s right. Without a doubt, the divine power that Lu Ming controls is also divine-grade divine power. He has also mastered a few extremely terrifying secret skills. His combat power is astonishing. If his cultivation level increases, he might be able to fight you!</p><p>“Also, he already has an array plate.”</p><p>The Supreme Saint said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
