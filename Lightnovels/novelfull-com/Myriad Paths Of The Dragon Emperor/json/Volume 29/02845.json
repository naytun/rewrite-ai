They gathered all the powerful tribe members who had gone out and set up layers of defense around the tribe.</p><p>The demons of the northern desolate demon Plains were extremely terrifying and powerful. There were many demons and Devil Kings, and their overall strength was about the same as the ten great tribes of the ancient God descendants.</p><p>That was why the two sides had been fighting for countless years, and neither side was able to do anything to the other.</p><p>However, if the experts from the Qin heaven Starfield were added, the balance would be broken.</p><p>The Qin heaven star region had sent over a dozen godkings. Furthermore, the godkings that entered were all extremely powerful existences.</p><p>A dozen powerful God kings, countless heavenly God Realm experts, and the demons of the demon Plains were enough to wipe out the descendants of the ancient gods.</p><p>This was a life and death crisis for the descendants of ancient gods.</p><p>The ten tribes were nervously preparing for war.</p><p>Just like that, half a month passed. However, there seemed to be no movement in the northern desolate demon field.</p><p>there’s still no movement. Could the news be fake? ”</p><p>“Yeah, could we have been tricked?”</p><p>Some people from the ten tribes started to discuss.</p><p>‘But …’</p><p>Roar Roar Roar …</p><p>The roars of demons and devils came from the North, completely crushing the doubts.</p><p>From the demon Plains of the northern wilderness, countless demons emerged and attacked the ten tribes of the ancient God descendants.</p><p>Among the countless demons, he could even see the figures of experts from the Qin heaven star region.</p><p>……</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Outside the eighth tribe, countless demons were swarming toward the eighth tribe. There were so many of them that they were endless. The number of demons was even greater than the number of demons that had attacked the ice Soul clan’s base decades ago.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>A few earth-shaking roars came from the back of the troops of the monster race and demon race. A few huge creatures appeared in the void in the distance, but their terrifying pressure made everyone feel breathless.</p><p>That was the Demon King!</p><p>The King of Monsters and demons was equivalent to the king of gods, an existence at the divine King realm.</p><p>kill! Defeat the descendants of the ancient gods for me. You can enjoy all the descendants of the ancient gods.</p><p>The voice of a Demon King reverberated through the entire area.</p><p>It was said that as long as a demon devoured a descendant of an ancient God and fused with the bloodline of the ancient God, it would be able to develop intelligence.</p><p>The demons that had gained intelligence in the northern wilderness demon field had devoured the descendants of the ancient gods.</p><p>It was no wonder that this time, the demons would join forces with the experts of the Qin heaven Starfield. They had gained from each other.</p><p>The demons wanted to devour the descendants of the ancient gods, while the experts of the Qin heaven star system wanted the treasures of the descendants of the ancient gods.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>Countless demons roared and charged toward the eighth tribe with bloodshot eyes.</p><p>“Kill, kill all these demons!”</p><p>The Warriors of the eighth tribe shouted. They stood on the city wall, took out their bows, and shot out arrows.</p><p>The power of these arrows was shocking. Some of the stronger demons were pierced by the arrows and nailed to the ground.</p><p>However, the number of demons was endless. They kept coming like a tide.</p><p>Soon, the two sides engaged in close combat.</p><p>all the descendants of the ancient gods who could transform into ancient God bodies did so.</p><p>On the city wall of the eighth tribe, tall and majestic figures appeared one after another. They roared into the sky and waved all kinds of weapons, fighting against the demons.</p><p>Lu Ming transformed into an ancient God Body at once. He thrust his spear continuously, killing the demons one after another.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>An earth-shaking roar resounded. The demonic Devil King had made its move. It rushed over from the sky with a terrifying aura that covered the sky and earth. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>A few figures also rushed out from the eighth tribe. Each of them was more than a hundred meters tall. They were the godkings of the eighth tribe.</p><p>The divine kings of both sides engaged in a terrifying battle in the sky.</p><p>It was difficult to determine the winner when they fought.</p><p>However, after a while, a figure the size of an ordinary person appeared in the distance, stepping on the air and emitting a terrifying pressure.</p><p>Godking, yet another Godking.</p><p>“The Godking of the unique devil Academy.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>Lu Ming was very familiar with this Divine King. Back then, he was the one who led the people from the unique demon Academy to the ice Soul clan’s base in an attempt to kill Lu Ming. How could Lu Ming forget this?</p><p>The godkings of the unique devil Academy joined the battle. Immediately, the battle was in the monster demon clan’s favor. The godkings of the eighth tribe were gradually losing.</p><p>In the end, the Godking of the eighth tribe could only retreat in defeat. He returned to the eighth tribe and activated the formation to resist the demons ‘attacks.</p><p>With the help of the formation, the eighth tribe was able to stop the demons ‘attack.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>Outside the formation, a few enormous demons and Devil Kings, as well as the godkings of the unique devil Academy, were standing outside. They were watching coldly.</p><p>Suddenly, another tall figure walked over from another direction.</p><p>“The Godking of the inextinguishable sword sect.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>Yet another Godking had arrived.</p><p>The number of godkings in the eighth tribe was no longer comparable to that of the other side.</p><p>“Attack! Break their formation!”</p><p>The Godking of the indestructible sword sect said coldly. Following that, a terrifying sword light shot into the sky, as if it was going to split the entire universe in half, and slashed towards the eighth tribe.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The sword light struck the formation, causing it to shake violently.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>At the same time, a few demonic Kings and godkings of the unique devil Academy also made their moves. All sorts of terrifying attacks landed on the great array, causing it to shake violently.</p><p>If it were not for the godkings of the eighth tribe working together to control the formation, the formation would have already been broken under the attack of so many godkings.</p><p>Even so, it was very difficult for them to resist.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Outside, the attacks continued for more than an hour before they stopped.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>Then, a Devil King gave an order. The countless Devil Kings retreated and stood in the distance, looking over coldly.</p><p>The yaomo did not give up. They retreated to rest and recover. When they recovered to their peak state, they would definitely continue to attack.</p><p>As expected, two days later, the experts from the monster demon clan, the unique demon Academy, and the immortal sword sect launched another attack.</p><p>After attacking for a period of time, they would retreat and recover.</p><p>“We can’t continue like this. The energy of the formation will be exhausted sooner or later. If the formation is broken, we won’t be able to stop them.”</p><p>In the eighth tribe, a group of experts gathered together to discuss some matters. An old man sighed.</p><p>“Then what should I do? Is our clan really going to be exterminated this time?”</p><p>The other old man was filled with sorrow.</p><p>our tribe must not be destroyed. In our current situation, we can only retreat to the number one tribe and join forces with them. Only then will we have a chance of survival.</p><p>The chief of the eighth tribe said.</p><p>“What? If we retreat, then we’ll have to give up our ancestral land that has been passed down for countless years?”</p><p>Someone said in a trembling voice.</p><p>The eighth tribe had been their ancestral land for countless years. There were all kinds of sacred cultivation grounds and blood pools, which were the source of their prosperity. It would be a great loss to give up on them.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
