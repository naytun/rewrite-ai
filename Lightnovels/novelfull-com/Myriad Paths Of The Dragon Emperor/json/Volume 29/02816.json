It shook its body and was fine.</p><p>Whoosh …</p><p>The heavenly God-level Toad’s eyes were filled with fierceness as it glared at Lu Ming and QiuQiu. Then, with a spring of its legs, its huge body pounced toward Lu Ming and QiuQiu at an astonishing speed.</p><p>It opened its mouth and its Scarlet tongue was like a sharp sword light, piercing toward Lu Ming. At the same time, beams of black light burst out and rushed toward QiuQiu.</p><p>“Ice chains!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not dare to be careless in the face of the heavenly God-level Toad. Nine ice chains flew out and wrapped around the toad.</p><p>At the same time, he activated the nine layers of Crimson Gold armor to protect his body and displayed the nine heavenly kun Peng technique. In a flash, he charged toward the toad, and a crescent-shaped sword light slashed toward the toad.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had still underestimated this Toad.</p><p>The Toad’s tongue was like an unparalleled sword. With a swing, it struck the ice chains. The ice chains trembled violently and then broke apart one by one.</p><p>Then, it continued to attack Lu Ming with its tongue.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat sword struck the Toad’s tongue. It was as if he had struck leather. It did not break through the Toad’s defense.</p><p>A powerful force burst forth from the tongue, traveling along the combat sword and hitting Lu Ming. Lu Ming’s body was sent flying and he crashed into the wall at the side.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming felt the blood in his body churning and he coughed out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“What powerful strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>The strength of this Toad was even more powerful than that of Liu Feiyun.</p><p>They were both first level celestial deities, but Liu Feiyun’s strength was definitely not a match for this Toad.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>QiuQiu brandished its two battle sabers and collided with the black light emitted by the toad. For a moment, it managed to withstand the attack.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>Lu Ming moved and charged at the toad again.</p><p>From the ” quantity ” formula, a steady stream of divine power gushed into Lu Ming’s body, keeping his divine power full.</p><p>The nine ice chains formed once again.</p><p>At the same time, a Dragon’s Roar was heard. A huge nine-clawed Divine Dragon appeared above Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>Lu Ming used the divine Dragon materialization technique for the first time against his enemy.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The nine-clawed Divine Dragon pounced toward the toad.</p><p>The nine dragon claws stepped out one after another and turned toward the toad.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The Toad’s tongue kept clashing with the dragon’s claws. The nine-clawed Divine Dragon’s huge body trembled, but it did not shatter.</p><p>“I blocked it!”</p><p>Lu Ming was elated. The power of the divine Dragon materialization art was indeed shocking, especially the nine-clawed Divine Dragon phenomenon that Lu Ming had condensed. It was even more powerful and had become his strongest killing move.</p><p>“QiuQiu, use lightning!“</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to QiuQiu. He had used all his means to kill the toad.</p><p>Zzzzzzz …</p><p>On QiuQiu’s body, lightning pervaded and then converged into a thick bolt of lightning that shot towards the toad. It pierced through the light that was emitted by the other party in an instant and bombarded the toad.</p><p>The toad was struck by the lightning, and its body immediately stiffened. The fragrance of roasted meat also spread out.</p><p>After QiuQiu’s cultivation broke through to the ninth stage true God Realm, the power of that lightning was even stronger.</p><p>How could Lu Ming miss such an opportunity? he immediately controlled the nine ice chains and wrapped them around the toad. A terrifying chill surged into the Toad’s body, trying to freeze it.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The nine-clawed Divine Dragon roared as it took a few steps forward with its claws aimed at the toad. At the same time, Lu Ming swung his sword at the toad.</p><p>Whoosh …</p><p>At the critical moment, the toad mustered all its remaining strength. A black demonic Qi shot out in all directions like a shock wave. In an instant, the ice chains bounced off and it hit Lu Ming and the nine-clawed Divine Dragon.</p><p>The nine-clawed Divine Dragon phenomenon shook violently, and its body emitted a blinding light. Then, it began to explode inch by inch. Lu Ming was sent flying, and his nine-layer Crimson Gold armor was covered in cracks.</p><p>However, this was the Toad’s desperate move. After using it, his aura became much weaker, and the demonic Qi protecting his body became much thinner.</p><p>QiuQiu seized the opportunity and another bolt of lightning struck down.</p><p>This time, the toad was sent flying by the lightning. Its round body rolled on the ground, and its body was charred black.</p><p>QiuQiu seized the opportunity and charged forward. With a slash of its blade, half of the Toad’s body was chopped off with a pfft sound, and blood flowed all over the ground.</p><p>Even so, the toad was still alive and was struggling to escape.</p><p>“Don’t even think about escaping!”</p><p>go! Lu Ming shouted. The nine ice chains formed again and were thousands of meters long, binding the toad.</p><p>The toad was already heavily injured. This time, it could no longer jump out of the ice chains. Its body was covered in a layer of ice.</p><p>QiuQiu charged forward and slashed down twice, killing the toad completely.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a long sigh of relief. He had finally killed the toad.</p><p>The heavenly God Toad was even stronger than Liu Feiyun. It was indeed hard to kill.</p><p>Lu Ming and QiuQiu cooperated with each other and used all their means. They had a good grasp of the timing to kill the toad. If the timing was not right, they would not be able to kill the toad even if they joined forces.</p><p>“My cultivation is still too low …”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>His various divine skills and secret skills were very powerful, but his cultivation was low, so he could not exert too much power.</p><p>In fact, the main reason was that Lu Ming’s opponents were too powerful. If he was facing someone of the same level or a few levels higher than him, Lu Ming could easily kill them in seconds.</p><p>Lu Ming, who was only at the third stage of true God Realm, was too far away from a heavenly God powerhouse. If it were any other third stage true God against a heavenly God, he would most likely be slapped to death.</p><p>After the toad was killed, the cave became quiet. This cave seemed to be the cave of the Toad King, and the other toads didn’t dare to enter.</p><p>QiuQiu’s eyes were burning as it stared at the piece of metal. It immediately rushed up and opened its mouth to take a big bite.</p><p>Giggle giggle …</p><p>Sparks flew in all directions. That piece of metal was bitten off piece by piece by QiuQiu, and it swallowed it.</p><p>Not long after, the entire piece of metal had been completely eaten by QiuQiu.</p><p>“I’m going to evolve.”</p><p>QiuQiu turned into a metal ball and fell to the ground, unmoving.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged not far away from QiuQiu and channeled his energy to heal his injuries.</p><p>In the battle just now, he had been seriously injured.</p><p>After his injuries had healed, Lu Ming began to cultivate in the cave.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, three months had passed, and QiuQiu was still in the process of evolving.</p><p>It was obvious that the piece of metal was not that easy to refine.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ve finally refined the ancient God flower’s energy. Do you need it now? if you do, I’ll transfer it to you immediately.”</p><p>The voice of the ” quantity ” formula sounded.</p><p>“Alright, pass it to me.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>After decades of polishing and cultivating, Lu Ming’s Foundation had long been extremely stable. Now was the perfect time to break through.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
