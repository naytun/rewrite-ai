All of them were at the celestial-realm.</p><p>so many experts! They’re from the indestructible sword sect!</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>There were middle-aged, old, and even young people in this group. Each of them carried a sword on their back. One look at their attire and Lu Ming knew that they were from the indestructible sword sect, one of the three overlords.</p><p>These people had also noticed Lu Ming, but they only cast him a cold glance before ignoring him and flying in one direction, as if they had something important to do.</p><p>Lu Ming did not think too much about it. He continued to wander in the forest in search of natural treasures.</p><p>However, not long after, someone flew past Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>This time, there were fewer people, only four.</p><p>“They are from the unique devil Academy!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered when he saw the four people’s attire.</p><p>“Wait a moment!”</p><p>The four of them had already flown past when an old man suddenly called out and the four of them stopped.</p><p>The old man’s gaze shifted to Lu Ming.</p><p>so it’s this kid. That Lu Ming who got first place in the thirteen clans ‘assessment. This kid actually managed to come here …</p><p>The old man was astonished to see Lu Ming.</p><p>He had seen Lu Ming before. Lu Ming had won first place in the thirteen clans ‘assessment. He had even invited Lu Ming to join the unique demon Academy, but Lu Ming had rejected him. He had a deep impression of Lu Ming, so he had recognized Lu Ming with a quick glance.</p><p>“Elder Hong, you know this kid?”</p><p>A young man among the four asked.</p><p>I’ve seen this kid before. He got first place in the thirteen clans ‘assessment. This kid can actually run here. Wait a minute, this kid’s cultivation has already reached stage five true God. How is this possible? ”</p><p>Old man Hong’s eyes widened in shock when he saw Lu Ming’s cultivation level.</p><p>He remembered very clearly that Lu Ming had not even reached virtual God-level during the thirteen clans ‘assessment. He was only a demigod.</p><p>Now, less than a hundred years had passed and Lu Ming had actually cultivated to the fifth stage of true God Realm. What kind of cultivation speed was this?</p><p>The old man surnamed Hong’s heart was in turmoil.</p><p>it hasn’t even been a hundred years since the first place of the last thirteen clans ‘assessment. In less than a hundred years, his cultivation has risen to stage five true God. Then, how strong was his cultivation at that time? ”</p><p>Another person asked.</p><p>“Demigod!”</p><p>The old man surnamed Hong said.</p><p>“Demigod? What? Demigod?”</p><p>The other three were completely stunned.</p><p>Then, cold killing intent filled their eyes.</p><p>Such a talented person, yet he was not a member of their unique demon Academy, so he should be eliminated.</p><p>“I’m going to kill him!”</p><p>The young man said coldly. He took a step forward and rushed toward Lu Ming, then he pressed his palm down.</p><p>This young man was also a heaven’s favorite in the unique demon Academy. At such a young age, he already had the cultivation of a first-level heavenly deity and was not any weaker than Liu Feiyun.</p><p>The way he saw it, with his first level celestial deity cultivation, dealing with a fifth level true God person was still a matter of settling with one palm.</p><p>“You still want to kill me like this …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart was burning with anger and was filled with murderous intent.</p><p>He didn’t even say a word, but the other party wanted to kill him. He was really overbearing.</p><p>Since that was the case …</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were extremely cold. His figure soared into the sky, divine power surging wildly.</p><p>“Divine Dragon materialization art!”</p><p>Lu Ming immediately used his strongest killing move. A nine-clawed Divine Dragon emerged and roared as it pounced toward the other party.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>Sensing the terrifying aura of the nine-clawed Divine Dragon, the four people from the unique demon Academy were all shocked.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The nine-clawed Divine Dragon roared and rushed forward, completely crushing the young man’s palm force. The Dragon Claw stepped out and grabbed the young man.</p><p>That youth would never have expected that Lu Ming, a fifth stage true God, could actually burst out with such a terrifying attack. It was too late to Dodge.</p><p>“Kid, stop!”</p><p>“Don’t you dare!”</p><p>The others roared in anger and wanted to help, but it was too late.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The young man was torn apart by the divine Dragon phenomenon.</p><p>“You … You’re looking for death …”</p><p>When the remaining three saw this scene, they all roared in anger, their eyes red.</p><p>A first-level heavenly deity had died just like that. Their hearts ached so much that it was about to drip blood.</p><p>The three of them charged at Lu Ming in a fit of rage, their powerful auras filling the air.</p><p>One was at the first level of the celestial deity realm, one was at the second level of the celestial deity realm, and one was at the third level of the celestial deity realm.</p><p>“Brat, I’m going to grind your bones and scatter your ashes.”</p><p>The old man with the surname Hong bellowed. He had a third-level celestial deity cultivation base and exuded a terrifying killing intent as he charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>One of the reasons why he wanted to kill Lu Ming so badly was because Lu Ming had killed the young man. The biggest reason was that Lu Ming’s combat strength had shocked him.</p><p>Lu Ming’s ability was too terrifying. He must be eliminated.</p><p>“QiuQiu!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and QiuQiu flew out.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The old man surnamed Hong didn’t put QiuQiu in his eyes at all. He struck out with a move, wanting to send QiuQiu flying.</p><p>However, a bolt of lightning shot out from QiuQiu’s body and pierced through the old man’s attack, landing on the old man surnamed Hong.</p><p>The old man screamed as he was sent flying, smashing into a few ancient trees. He was already half-dead.</p><p>The other two were already dumbfounded.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>QiuQiu’s figure flashed and directly slashed out with a blade. That second level celestial deity was killed by QiuQiu’s blade, leaving only that first level celestial deity.</p><p>“Don’t kill me, don’t kill me!”</p><p>That first level heavenly deity burly man almost peed his pants in fear. He shouted out in fear, his body trembling non-stop.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was simply a demon in his eyes.</p><p>“Is it possible that I won’t kill you?”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward. His cold killing intent made the middle-aged man’s body tremble even more.</p><p>don’t kill me, don’t kill me. As long as you don’t kill me, I’ll tell you a secret, a secret of a treasure …</p><p>The middle-aged man shouted.</p><p>“The secret to the treasure?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming was moved, the middle-aged man saw a chance to live. He was overjoyed and quickly shouted, ” that’s right, we found a place that definitely has amazing treasures. As long as you let me go, I’ll tell you the location of that place.</p><p>“You don’t have the right to negotiate with me. Speak, or I’ll kill you right now.”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>no, you must promise not to kill me. Otherwise, I will never tell you. I will die anyway!</p><p>The middle-aged man gritted his teeth.</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>Lu Ming rolled his eyes and nodded.”Alright, as long as what you said is true, I won’t kill you.”</p><p>“It’s true!”</p><p>The middle-aged man’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“Nonsense, of course it’s true. Hurry up and tell me, or I’ll kill you right now.” Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“Alright, alright, I’ll tell you …”</p><p>The burly man immediately explained the geographical location.</p><p>“I’ve already told you. Can you let me go now?”</p><p>The middle-aged man looked at Lu Ming hopefully.</p><p>“Let you go? After I let you go, are you going to wait for reinforcements to come and kill me?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
