The two of them ‘fought’ for three days and three nights before they hugged each other and fell asleep.</p><p>After that, the two of them stayed together every day and cultivated with each other. Lu Ming would also guide Qiu Yue in her cultivation of the divine skill.</p><p>After Qiu Yue had awakened her nine-orifice Saint heart, not only did her cultivation speed increase at an astonishing speed, but her comprehension had also improved greatly.</p><p>The speed at which he comprehended a divine skill was astonishing.</p><p>Furthermore, Qiu Yue had already cultivated the universe thousand Dao scroll to a very high level. Qiu Yue’s divine power had already reached the peak of the divine grade divine power. If she were to improve further, she would be able to cultivate the divine power of the ruler of the divine grade divine power.</p><p>By then, Qiu Yue would be able to cultivate other divine powers and form many divine fires. Her combat power would increase dramatically.</p><p>Qiu Yue’s future was limitless.</p><p>Time flew by, and two years had passed.</p><p>In two years ‘time, Qiu Yue’s cultivation had actually advanced another step and reached the sixth stage of true God Realm. Lu Ming’s cultivation was still hovering around the eighth stage of true God Realm.</p><p>At this moment, a piece of news spread in the Kong Xuan sect, causing a huge commotion.</p><p>The higher-ups of the Kong Xuan sect had decided that the competition between the Holy Sons and holy virgins would be held three months later to decide who would be the zongzi.</p><p>A zongzi would be the successor sect master, the future sect master.</p><p>The entire Kong Xuan sect was shocked by this news.</p><p>This was because the news had come from the elder Council of the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>The Holy Sons and holy virgins immediately gathered the people from their factions to discuss this matter.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately gathered the experts from his sect to discuss this matter.</p><p>Holy Son, this is very strange. The cultivation of the Holy Sons and holy virgins isn’t high enough. It’ll take some time before the competition starts.</p><p>One of the inner sect elders said.</p><p>that’s right. In the past, the competition was natural. It wasn’t carried out in a specific way. Instead, it was natural for the Holy Sons and holy virgins to compete with each other, and the final winner would be the zongzi. However, this time, the Senate has personally issued an order to hold the zongzi contest in three months. This doesn’t make sense.</p><p>Another inner court elder said with a frown.</p><p>Kong Xuan sect’s Senate was formed by the strongest group of people in Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>The elders there were all divine kings and their status was far above the inner sect elders.</p><p>Everyone started to guess, but they couldn’t get a conclusion.</p><p>“Holy Son, Holy maiden Qingxiang requests an audience.”</p><p>Suddenly, someone came to report.</p><p>“Holy maiden Qingxiang, please come in!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand. Not long after, someone welcomed Holy maiden Qingxiang in.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re probably discussing the zongzi event that’s going to be held in three months, aren’t you?”</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang went straight to the point.</p><p>“Not bad! Holy maiden Xiang Xiang, do you have any news?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>I do have some news. I heard from my grandfather that the reason for the sudden zongzi contest is mainly because some people in the Senate want to push the Supreme Holy Son up.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang said.</p><p>“You want to push the Supreme Holy Son up?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed. He did not doubt Ouyang Qingxiang’s words.</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang’s grandfather, who was also Yuexin’s father, was an important figure in the Kong Xuan sect. He was a member of the Senate and a Godking.</p><p>that’s right. The Supreme Holy son’s background is extraordinary. His father’s side and his mother’s side are all major forces of the Kong Xuan sect. Each side has a doyen in the Senate, and there’s more than one. They’re very powerful and have a very high influence in the Senate.</p><p>this time, it’s the Big Shot behind the Supreme Holy Son who suggested this.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang said.</p><p>“Could it be that the other board of patriarchs have agreed?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>of course, there are those who disagree. My grandfather disagreed, but the Supreme Saint son’s backing is too powerful. He has great influence in the Senate. More than half of the elders agreed to the meeting. It’s difficult for the other elders to change their minds.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang said.</p><p>why did the Council of Elders suddenly make this proposal? it’s strange!</p><p>An inner sect elder was puzzled.</p><p>“It’s because of Lu Ming!”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Because of me?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. What did all of this have to do with him?</p><p>it’s very simple. Lu Ming, you’ve shown great talent and improved too quickly. It’s only been a few years, and the Tian Hong Saint son has died at your hands. Who can compete with you in a few years? ”</p><p>that’s why the people behind the Supreme Holy Son are afraid. They’re afraid that in a few years, even the Supreme Holy Son won’t be your match. At that time, the position of the Kong Xuan sect’s sect master will fall into your hands.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang said.</p><p>therefore, the people behind the Supreme Holy Son made the first move to gain the upper hand. They proposed this plan. Before I’m a match for the Supreme Holy Son, we’ll have a competition and then decide on the zongzi candidate.</p><p>Lu Ming followed Ouyang Qingxiang’s words.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang did not need to explain further. Lu Ming could already guess what she meant.</p><p>The person behind the Supreme Holy Son was afraid of Lu Ming. He was afraid that Lu Ming would surpass the Supreme Holy Son and was forced to propose this plan.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang nodded.</p><p>“Hehe, interesting. Holy maiden Qingxiang, what do you want to do?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>To be honest, Lu Ming had no interest in the zongzi position.</p><p>The purpose of his cultivation was to improve his strength, protect his family and friends, and break through to the God King realm as soon as possible so that he could find Xie nianqing.</p><p>now, there’s only one way to fight against the Supreme Holy Son, and that’s to join forces!</p><p>“Let’s work together. I’ll help you become a zongzi!” Ouyang Qingxiang said.</p><p>After saying that, he looked at Lu Ming with bright eyes.</p><p>“How about this? let’s work together. I’ll help you become a zongzi!” Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“You’ll help me?”</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang was stunned.</p><p>that’s right. When we formed an alliance, I told you that you wouldn’t regret it. To be honest, I’m not interested in the zongzi position. However, among all these Holy Sons and holy virgins, you’re the only one who’s more suitable to become a zongzi. What do you think? ”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Is what you said true?”</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang’s eyes were filled with joy.</p><p>“Of course it’s true,”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>alright. As long as I become a zongzi and take over the Kong Xuan sect in the future, I will never forget you and your people.</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang responded.</p><p>In fact, she had come to look for Lu Ming with this intention.</p><p>She had long noticed that Lu Ming’s talent was too high and his goal was also very high. Lu Ming’s heart would not be trapped in a place like the Kong Xuan sect or the Qin Tian Galaxy. Therefore, she had long guessed that Lu Ming was not interested in the position of the Kong Xuan sect’s sect leader.</p><p>However, she had one. She needed Lu Ming’s help.</p><p>according to my speculation, the other Holy Sons and holy virgins may also join forces. I’m afraid it won’t be easy for us to get through this.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang said.</p><p>“Just do your best!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
