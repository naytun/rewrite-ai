Hahaha, I hope that when Lord Godking gets to eat meat, we’ll get to drink some soup!</p><p>A big man from the unique devil Academy laughed.</p><p>the experts of the Qin heaven Starfield have actually formed an alliance with the demons of the northern wilderness demon field. They are going to attack the descendants of the ancient gods.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked when he heard the news.</p><p>Lu Ming had never expected such a thing to happen.</p><p>After hearing the news, the first thing that Lu Ming thought of was to rush back to the tribe of the ancient gods ‘descendants and inform them.</p><p>The descendants of the ancient gods had lived here since ancient times. They had stood aloof from the world. When they attacked Lu Ming and the others, they treated them as intruders. Naturally, they had to fight back.</p><p>In addition, Lu Ming had stayed in the tribe for five years. He had gained a lot in the tribe, and he regarded the descendants of the ancient gods as his friends.</p><p>He would definitely not watch his friend suffer a great disaster.</p><p>“Wait a moment!”</p><p>All of a sudden, an old man from the unique devil Academy shouted and stopped.</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>The others were all stunned.</p><p>“Someone is following us. Who? Get the hell out here!”</p><p>The old man’s eyes were cold as he looked in Lu Ming’s direction.</p><p>I’ve been discovered. What a sharp sense.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold.</p><p>“If you don’t come out, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>The old man from the unique devil Academy was extremely decisive. As soon as he saw that Lu Ming did not come out, he immediately made a move. His palm was like a blade as he slashed out. A pitch-black demonic blade slashed toward Lu Ming’s position.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique and dodged the attack in a flash.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The demonic blade struck the ground, creating a ravine that extended for hundreds of thousands of meters.</p><p>“Sixth level heavenly deity!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned solemn.</p><p>That old man was shockingly a terrifying sixth level celestial deity powerhouse.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved and was naturally seen by the other party.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s Lu Ming!”</p><p>“It’s this kid!”</p><p>There were a total of five people from the unique devil Academy, and all of them revealed cold killing intent.</p><p>Of course, there was a look of shock in their eyes. They did not expect to meet Lu Ming here.</p><p>hahaha, I’ve really worn out my iron shoes searching high and low, but I found it without any effort at all. So this brat is here. I’ll just kill him and claim credit from the divine King!</p><p>“No, let’s not kill him first. Cripple him first.”</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>A burly man took a few steps forward and turned into a flash of Saber Light, charging toward Lu Ming.</p><p>This person shockingly had a fifth level celestial deity cultivation.</p><p>If it was fifty years ago, Lu Ming could only turn around and run if he encountered a fifth-level celestial deity powerhouse.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was no longer the same as before.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming kept triggering the battle formula. Now, the battle formula had quadrupled combat power. Lu Ming had cultivated it to a one-third success rate. After a few moments, Lu Ming successfully triggered it.</p><p>“Moon slaying!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his long spear and a crescent-shaped spearlight swept out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two sides collided. The crescent-shaped Spear’s radiance shook violently and shattered. Lu Ming’s figure retreated rapidly.</p><p>However, although Lu Ming retreated rapidly, he managed to block the other party’s move.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The people of the unique devil Academy were all shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually blocked the attack of a fifth-level celestial deity. Lu Ming actually had such combat strength?</p><p>“This kid …”</p><p>Their eyes were filled with deep shock.</p><p>“Brat, die!”</p><p>When the burly man saw that Lu Ming had actually blocked his move, he was shocked. With a ferocious killing intent, he charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The pitch-black demonic blade swept across tens of thousands of miles and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique and dodged his opponent’s attack with a few dodges. Instead of advancing, he retreated and charged toward the middle-aged man.</p><p>“Ball ball …”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to QiuQiu and then threw a punch.</p><p>QiuQiu had been transformed into a bangle on Lu Ming’s hand. At this moment, it was filled with dazzling lightning. A bolt of lightning as thick as an arm burst out from Lu Ming’s wrist and blasted toward the middle-aged man.</p><p>“Small tricks, break!”</p><p>The middle-aged man didn’t care. He slashed out with his saber, trying to break the lightning.</p><p>“Not good, be careful …”</p><p>The old man’s spiritual sense was sharp, and he noticed that the lightning was unusual. He warned loudly, but it was already too late.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The lightning directly destroyed the opponent’s blade light and bombarded the opponent’s body.</p><p>The other party was directly sent flying. His entire body was charred black, and he was already exhaling more than he was inhaling.</p><p>With QiuQiu’s current cultivation, it was not difficult to kill a fifth-level celestial deity existence when caught off guard.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>“Let’s attack together and cripple this brat!”</p><p>When the remaining four people of the unique devil Academy saw this scene, they all roared and burst out with cold killing intent.</p><p>They did not make a move earlier because the middle-aged man alone was enough to kill Lu Ming. They did not need to do anything at all. They had never expected that Lu Ming’s strength would be so terrifying.</p><p>The remaining four of them charged toward Lu Ming, each of them exuding a powerful aura.</p><p>“Two sixth level heavenly deities and two fifth level heavenly deities!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>The other party’s strength had exceeded his imagination.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and left.</p><p>“You want to run? No one can save you today. Kill!”</p><p>The four experts from the unique demon Academy chased after Lu Ming at an astonishing speed.</p><p>In particular, the two sixth-tier celestial deity experts had cultivated speed-type divine skills. Moreover, their mastery was higher than Lu Ming’s and their speed was faster than Lu Ming’s. They rapidly closed the distance between them.</p><p>“Hmph, who said I’m running?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered in his heart, his eyes glimmering with wisdom.</p><p>He had never thought of escaping from the start. Instead, he had planned to wipe out all the enemies.</p><p>With his current strength and QiuQiu’s cooperation, it was not impossible.</p><p>QiuQiu, I’ll leave that old man to you. Keep him busy.</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to QiuQiu.</p><p>“Don’t worry, leave it to me.”</p><p>QiuQiu’s voice was heard.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and QiuQiu flew over to the old man at high speed. It then turned into a huge metal ball. Two sabers extended from its body and slashed wildly at the old man.</p><p>“A metallic lifeform. Die!”</p><p>The old man shouted angrily and slashed out with his demonic blade, wanting to kill QiuQiu. However, the two of them collided continuously. His attack was blocked by QiuQiu. At the same time, in QiuQiu’s battle, lightning would be released from time to time, making it impossible for the other party to defend.</p><p>With QiuQiu’s current strength, if it were to go all out, it was sufficient to contend against a sixth level heavenly deity existence.</p><p>“You guys go and kill that brat!”</p><p>The old man roared.</p><p>Needless to say, the other three people also chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>“Brat, you can’t escape. Prepare to die. Yimo divine palm.”</p><p>The other sixth-level celestial deity was a black-robed elder. He struck out with his palm and a pitch-black palm print blasted towards Lu Ming. The power was shocking.</p><p>“Divine Dragon phenomenon, moon-cutting!”</p><p>Lu Ming growled and instantly used two of his ultimate moves, the divine Dragon materialization technique and the three apocalyptic strikes.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
