They didn’t go out and killed some planet devourers while they were at it.</p><p>In the days that followed, they didn’t encounter any gold planet devourers, but they did encounter some silver and bronze planet devourers.</p><p>Now that Ouyang Qingxiang had a breakthrough in her cultivation and Lu Ming’s combat strength had increased, it was much easier to kill devourers.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current combat strength, he could easily kill the silver Planet Devourer even if he was facing it alone.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, three months had passed.</p><p>Three months later, Lu Ming, Ouyang Qingxiang, and the other two returned to the passageway they had entered from. Once the three-month period was up, they flew into the vortex and returned to the Kong Xuan sect’s competition ground.</p><p>The Kong Xuan sect was still crowded.</p><p>Three months ‘time was just a blink of an eye to everyone. It would pass by in a short time.</p><p>“Look, they’re out.”</p><p>Someone suddenly called out.</p><p>Then, everyone saw figures appear in the teleportation array in the sky.</p><p>The Supreme Saint son, the transient light Saint son, Lu Ming, and the others appeared almost at the same time and sized each other up.</p><p>Four people went in from each side, and four people came out. There was no loss.</p><p>“Hehe, I wonder how many planet devourers you’ve killed? Let’s take a look?”</p><p>The Supreme saint’s gaze swept across the sacred son of reflection, Ouyang Qingxiang, and the others as he spoke coldly.</p><p>“You’ll know in a moment!”</p><p>The sacred son of reflection snorted.</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang’s expression was calm and she did not say anything.</p><p>However, Kang Chong and Liu Jie’s eyes revealed a hint of anticipation and excitement. They were looking forward to the expressions of the Supreme Holy Son and the others when they saw their gains.</p><p>The others in the surroundings were also making guesses.</p><p>“I wonder which side will gain more this time?”</p><p>that goes without saying. It must be the Supreme Holy Son. With his combat power, he can definitely kill many planet devourers!</p><p>that’s right. I still stand by my original judgment. The Supreme Saint is first, and the transient light Saint is second. As for Ouyang Xiangxiang and Lu Ming, they are definitely the weakest.</p><p>Some people were very firm and still believed that Ouyang Qingxiang and Lu Ming’s side were the weakest.</p><p>okay, now, take out the planet devourers you’ve killed. One point for the bronze-grade planet devourers, five points for the silver-grade planet devourers, and fifty points for the gold-grade planet devourers.</p><p>The Supreme doyen of the Senate stepped out again and announced loudly.</p><p>“Floating light, didn’t you want me to know how many planet devourers you’ve killed? Take it out and let’s see!”</p><p>The Supreme Saint looked at the transient light Saint son and the others.</p><p>In the Supreme saint’s mind, the biggest competitor this round was still the sacred son of reflection. After all, the sacred son of reflection had four sacred sons and saintesses working together.</p><p>As long as he knew what the sacred son of reflection and the others had obtained, he would have more confidence.</p><p>The sacred son snorted and stepped forward. With a wave of his hand, the heads of the planet devourers flew out and floated in the air.</p><p>There were silver ones and bronze ones.</p><p>Lu Ming took a glance and saw the number.</p><p>There were 12 Silver Planet devourers and 52 bronze devourers.</p><p>There were a total of 64.</p><p>Lu Ming was not too surprised by the number.</p><p>Currently, the sacred son of reflection was also at the fifth-level heavenly deity realm. His combat strength was definitely not weaker than Ouyang Qingxiang’s. With the other three sacred sons and saintesses working together, killing a silver-grade planet Devourer would definitely not be a problem.</p><p>It was normal for them to kill twelve in three months if they cooperated well.</p><p>The Supreme Holy Son swept his gaze across and revealed a relaxed look.</p><p>12 silver-grade planet devourers, 60 points in total. 52 bronze-grade devourers, 52 points. A total of 112 points.</p><p>The Supreme martial artist announced.</p><p>The crowd didn’t speak. Most of them didn’t have much of an idea of the planet Devourer’s strength, so they didn’t have much of an idea about 112 points.</p><p>He also needed to know the points of the others and compare them before he could come to a conclusion.</p><p>hehe, only 112 points and you want to compete with me? ”</p><p>The Supreme Holy Son chuckled and stepped forward. With a wave of his hand, the heads of the planet devourers flew out.</p><p>There were silver and bronze.</p><p>18 Silver Planet devourers ‘heads and 80 bronze planet devourers’ heads.</p><p>The sacred son of reflection’s expression turned extremely ugly when he saw this number.</p><p>The Supreme Saint looked at the reflection Saint son smugly, then at Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang. He chuckled and said,”Do you think that’s all I’ve gained? Then you guys better watch carefully.”</p><p>After saying that, the Supreme Holy Son waved his hand again, and another planet Devourer’s head flew out.</p><p>The head of the planet Devourer was golden in color.</p><p>The head of the gold planet Devourer.</p><p>Seeing the head, the floating light Saint son, Zhi Xia Saint son, Yan Kong Saint son, and Xue Tan Saint son all turned pale.</p><p>Even Ouyang Qingxiang and the others had a grave expression on their faces.</p><p>The Supreme Holy Son and the others were actually able to kill a gold-grade planet Devourer. Their strength was truly shocking.</p><p>A smile appeared on Zhi Zun’s old face as he loudly announced, ” on the side of the Supreme universe, we have killed a gold planet Devourer, 18 Silver Planet devourers, and 80 bronze planet devourers. We have obtained a total of 220 points.</p><p>The sacred son’s face turned even uglier. The points that they had obtained were only about half of the Supreme sacred son’s. The difference was too great.</p><p>The crowd was in a heated discussion again.</p><p>as expected of the Supreme Holy Son. He actually obtained 220 points. That’s almost double the amount of points the transient light Holy Son has!</p><p>the sacred son of floating light has four sacred sons and saintesses working together. If they were to split up, wouldn’t they be even worse off? the gap is too big.</p><p>the difference is indeed shocking. Among all the Holy Sons and holy virgins, the Supreme Holy Son is the best. I knew that no one could defeat the Supreme Holy Son.</p><p>I haven’t even calculated the points of Holy maiden Qingxiang and Holy Son Lu Ming.</p><p>needless to say, Holy maiden Qingxiang and Holy Son Lu Ming have the least number of people. I bet they won’t have more than 100 points.</p><p>In the midst of the discussion, the Supreme Holy Son turned his gaze to Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang.</p><p>“You two, where are your gains? take them out and have a look!”</p><p>The Supreme Saint said with a relaxed expression.</p><p>He also felt that Lu Ming and the rest’s gains would definitely not exceed that of the sacred son of reflection and the rest.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
