However, they were not of much use to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming spread out his spiritual sense. He was looking for those precious natural treasures.</p><p>“That is … Dragon ginseng!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up after traveling for a while.</p><p>He saw a Dragon ginseng, but the pillar Dragon ginseng was too big, which surprised him.</p><p>As the name suggested, the average Dragon ginseng was as long and thin as a Dragon’s beard. It was a rare divine medicine that could be used to refine divine pills that could increase the cultivation of heavenly gods. It was very precious.</p><p>However, the Dragon ginseng in front of him was as thick as Lu Ming’s arm. It was dozens of times thicker than the average Dragon ginseng.</p><p>“Such a huge Dragon ginseng, haha!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>“Brat, this kind of divine medicine contains a strong Qi of desolation. It’s not easy to refine it.”</p><p>In his sea of consciousness, the voice of the quantity formula sounded.</p><p>“Desolation Qi?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>that’s right. This world is very ancient and undeveloped. That’s why there’s primal Qi in it. These divine herbs all contain primal Qi. It’s difficult for ordinary people to refine them. Only by refining the primal Qi inside can they absorb the energy inside the divine herbs.</p><p>The quantity formula explained.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. It seemed that although the effects of the divine medicine here were very strong, it was still more difficult to refine it directly. The best choice was to bring it out and let The Alchemist refine it into divine pills.</p><p>“But little brat, you have me, so you don’t have to worry about this. Give me this Dragon ginseng, I can help you refine it into pure energy for you to absorb.”</p><p>The ” quantity ” formula said proudly.</p><p>hey, you said you’d refine the ancient God flower’s energy and give it to me last time. It’s been decades and you still haven’t refined it? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“What do you know? How could the energy of so many ancient God flowers be so easily refined? But don’t worry, it’ll be done soon. In a few months at most, I’ll be able to refine it completely. At that time, your cultivation will be able to improve even further.”</p><p>The ” quantity ” formula shouted.</p><p>“It’s true!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>nonsense, of course it’s true. I wouldn’t lie. The quantity formula called out.</p><p>“Hahaha, good, good, I’ll give you this Dragon ginseng!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Then, a ‘measure’ character emerged between Lu Ming’s brows. A devouring force enveloped the Dragon-bearded ginseng. The ginseng turned into a ray of light and flew into the ‘measure’ character. Then, the ‘measure’ character hid itself in Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to move forward.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming came across a few more kinds of heavenly and earthly treasures. They were all divine medicines that were rare in the outside world and had amazing medicinal effects. He would definitely be able to sell them for a good price if he brought them out.</p><p>No wonder so many people had entered this world.</p><p>MMH!</p><p>Lu Ming, who was moving forward, suddenly stopped. He frowned and a long spear appeared in his hand.</p><p>Because at this moment, he felt a sudden sense of danger.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A terrifying whistling sound came from his right. An extremely sharp force tore at Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Without thinking, Lu Ming fired a shot to the right.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear seemed to have hit a piece of metal. Then, Lu Ming saw a black shadow being sent flying.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The black shadow crashed heavily into an ancient tree dozens of meters in diameter, causing the tree to explode.</p><p>“Demon …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered when he saw the appearance of the black shadow.</p><p>It was a Wolf that had attacked him.</p><p>This Wolf was more than three meters tall. Its entire body was pitch black, and it was no different from any other demonic beast or desolate beast.</p><p>However, there was no demonic Qi on this Wolf’s body. Instead, it exuded a strong demonic Qi. Its eyes were blood-red and full of killing intent.</p><p>“The demonic Wolf’s body contains a powerful demonic Qi. No wonder it’s called a demonic devil …”</p><p>Lu Ming was amazed.</p><p>It was like a demon but not a demon, like a devil but not a devil, it was a devil.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The wolf-shaped fiend howled. Its baleful aura grew stronger as it glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>Following that, howls and roars rang out continuously. In the forest, black shadows flickered. At least a few dozen Wolf-shaped demons appeared from the branches of the surrounding ancient trees. They glared at Lu Ming with murderous intent.</p><p>“Why am I so unlucky …”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. It seemed that he had encountered a Wolf’s Den.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>Howls were heard as dozens of Wolf-shaped fiendish demons turned into streaks of black light and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>The wolf-shaped demonic demon swiped with its sharp claws, letting out a terrifying howl.</p><p>Its sharp claws were like knives as it clawed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear shook and rays of spear light burst out.</p><p>Instantly, the sound of metal clashing rang out.</p><p>Dozens of Wolf-shaped demons were sent flying by him.</p><p>“This demon has such a strong attack!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. Although he did not care about the strength of these demons, their attack power still surprised him.</p><p>The demonic Qi around these demons had a strong destructive power. Compared to the same level of demons and Warriors from the outside world, demons were definitely stronger.</p><p>After dozens of demons were sent flying, they did not retreat. Instead, they roared and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>“I’ll send you on your way!”</p><p>Lu Ming was filled with killing intent and increased his strength.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Instantly, dozens of sharp spear lights shot out and pierced through the demons ‘necks, killing them.</p><p>Lu Ming left the place immediately after killing the demons.</p><p>After a few days, Lu Ming walked out of the forest and came to an even more vast mountain range.</p><p>In this mountain range, they would occasionally encounter demons.</p><p>These demons looked no different from the demonic beasts and desolate beasts they had encountered before. However, their bodies were filled with terrifying demonic Qi. Each of them had terrifying combat strength.</p><p>But correspondingly, the number of natural treasures in this mountain range had also increased.</p><p>Other than the godly medicine, there were also many refining materials and even some precious metals.</p><p>Most of those precious metals had entered QiuQiu’s stomach and were eaten by it.</p><p>As for those divine herbs, most of them had been swallowed by the ” quantity ” formula.</p><p>Lu Ming was somewhat speechless.</p><p>Most of the divine herbs and metals that he had obtained had entered the quantity formula and QiuQiu’s stomach. There were very few that had entered his pocket.</p><p>Lu Ming could only hope that these two guys would surprise him.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming trained and killed in the desolate mountains for a few months.</p><p>The deeper he went, the stronger the demons he encountered.</p><p>They would often encounter eighth and ninth stage true God Realm demons and even celestial God Realm demons.</p><p>Whenever he encountered a heavenly God-level demon, Lu Ming would always take a detour. Even with QiuQiu’s help, he did not have much confidence in dealing with a heavenly God-level demon.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
