His fist was as heavy as a mountain, and it was aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Lu Ming saw a huge golden fist pressing down from the sky. The entire space shook violently.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming let out a roar that sounded like the roar of an ancient God and swept his spear out.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The long spear and the Supreme Holy son’s golden fist collided. Terrifying sound waves spread in all directions like water ripples.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear shook violently as if it was about to be shattered. Lu Ming’s hundred-meter tall body trembled and he retreated continuously.</p><p>Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>The 100-meter-tall body stepped on the fighting ring with a loud bang. The fighting ring kept shaking. Lu Ming had to take more than a dozen steps back before he could stabilize himself.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re defeated. Kneel down!”</p><p>The Supreme Holy Son roared and looked down at Lu Ming. His huge fists pressed down on Lu Ming, trying to force him to kneel on the ground.</p><p>do you think you’re the only one who can get bigger? get bigger too! Get bigger! Get bigger!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and his body rapidly grew in size.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body turned into two hundred meters tall and the scales all over his body turned green.</p><p>Lu Ming didn’t hold back any longer and immediately turned into a green-armored ancient God.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The spear struck out and clashed with the Supreme Holy Son. The sky trembled and the two figures retreated.</p><p>The two of them both retreated a dozen steps.</p><p>“What? Holy Son Lu Ming was still holding back earlier. It’s really too shocking.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s transformation into a green-armored ancient God shocked even more people.</p><p>Initially, everyone thought that Lu Ming had already reached his limit and could not be any stronger.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not seem to have any confidence. As his opponents grew stronger, so did he.</p><p>The Supreme Holy Son used the secret technique, Supreme Vajra, and turned into a 200-meter-tall giant.</p><p>Lu Ming had also transformed into the green-armored ancient God.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The Supreme Saint roared, his heart trembling. His eyes were filled with fear.</p><p>Yes, he was deeply shocked by Lu Ming’s endless means. He was also afraid.</p><p>“No, I must win today. I must kill this brat. I must kill him.”</p><p>The Supreme Holy Son roared in his heart, and his eyes revealed a ferocious look.</p><p>Initially, he was not supposed to kill his opponent in this match. However, he did not care anymore. He had to kill Lu Ming no matter what.</p><p>With his backing, so what if he killed Lu Ming? who would punish him for a dead man?</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The Supreme Holy Son roared and waved his fists, charging toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming was not afraid at all. He charged at the Supreme Holy Son as well. The two huge figures collided and fought each other.</p><p>The two of them used all their strength to suppress each other.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them fought on the fighting ring, and then they fought from the fighting ring to the sky.</p><p>This battle lasted for more than a hundred moves.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Supreme Saint punched Lu Ming’s shoulder and penetrated it. Green scales and flesh flew everywhere.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s long spear had also pierced the Supreme Holy son’s abdomen, directly piercing through his abdomen and blasting a huge hole.</p><p>Tragic! The battle was extremely intense.</p><p>From the start of the battle until now, both of them knew that their combat strength was equal. Only by fighting head-on could they have a chance of winning.</p><p>It was to see who was more ruthless and had a stronger will.</p><p>The two of them didn’t care about their injuries. Before they could recover, they started fighting again.</p><p>Next, both of them were hit, and their injuries worsened.</p><p>However, the two of them didn’t care. In their eyes, there was only one goal, and that was to defeat their opponents.</p><p>“Lu Ming …”</p><p>At the side of the fighting ring, Ouyang Xiangxiang, Yue Linglong, and the others were watching nervously, their hands tightly clasped together.</p><p>They naturally hoped that Lu Ming would win.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Supreme Being and the supporters of the Supreme Saint were also very nervous and hoped that the Supreme Saint would win.</p><p>Therefore, most of them held their breath and stared at the two figures, waiting for the final result.</p><p>damn it, this kid actually has such strong strength.</p><p>The more the Supreme Saint fought, the more shocked he became. Lu Ming’s strength, patience, and ruthlessness had all exceeded his expectations.</p><p>I will definitely win. My cultivation is at the sixth level of the celestial deity realm and my divine power is strong and condensed. He, on the other hand, is only at the peak of the true God Realm. I don’t believe that I can’t beat him with my divine power. I will exhaust him to death.</p><p>The Supreme Holy Son thought to himself.</p><p>Unfortunately, he was destined to be disappointed.</p><p>Lu Ming had the ” measure ” formula on him and he had stored a large amount of divine power. He was not afraid of anyone.</p><p>The two of them exchanged more than 200 moves. At this point, the Supreme Holy son’s divine power was gradually losing, while Lu Ming was still as lively as a Dragon and a Tiger.</p><p>this is bad. Lu Ming is a monster. If this goes on, Qian Kun will be defeated. I must stop him.</p><p>The Grandmaster felt a sense of foreboding in his heart, and then he roared,”Stop!”</p><p>Hearing this voice, the Supreme Holy Son wanted to retreat and stop the battle.</p><p>However, Lu Ming would not let him retreat so easily.</p><p>Lu Ming quickly followed, his long spear constantly stabbing at the Supreme Holy Son, making it impossible for him to retreat.</p><p>Seeing this, a ferocious look flashed in the Supreme Being’s eyes. A powerful aura erupted from his body and pressed down on Lu Ming and the Supreme Holy Son. He said in a cold voice,”Lu Ming, I told you to back off. Did you not hear me?”</p><p>However, just as the Supreme martial artist’s aura was about to burst out, Ouyang Qingxiang’s grandfather also moved. He burst out with his aura and canceled out the Supreme martial artist’s aura.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming’s figure only paused for a moment before he continued to attack the Supreme Holy Son.</p><p>“The Autarchs are moving? what are you doing? They’re having a competition, and no one has the right to interfere in the process.”</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang’s grandfather, Yue Wuya, coldly said.</p><p>“Who said I wanted to interfere? I just have something to announce!”</p><p>The Supreme martial artist said.</p><p>“What’s the matter? just tell me.”</p><p>Yue Wu Ya said coldly.</p><p>“Today’s battle was too brutal. The two of them are still in a draw and both of them are seriously injured. It won’t be good for them if this continues. I suggest that we end it with a draw today and fight another day to prevent them from hurting their Origin Energy.”</p><p>The Supreme martial artist said.</p><p>His eyes glowed with a cunning light.</p><p>As long as they stopped fighting now, he would have a way to let the Supreme Holy Son win the next time. He could even make Lu Ming disappear forever so that he would not be able to compete with the Supreme Holy Son.</p><p>“Hahaha, what a joke. Old man, you’re too shameless. Everyone can see that the Supreme universe’s divine power is running out and he’s about to lose, but you actually said it was a draw and said it was for our own good. I spit on you, you’re so shameless.”</p><p>Lu Ming was really angry and he cursed.</p><p>He had seen many shameless people, and Supreme movement was definitely in the top five.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
