However, Lu Ming has repeatedly offended our unique demon Academy and killed our Holy Son. He deserves to die a thousand times. Even if you don’t say it, I will still kill him. Hehe!”</p><p>we’re not borrowing your power. We’re working together to get rid of Lu Ming. The array plate will be yours. We’ll each take what we need!</p><p>The Supreme Saint said.</p><p>“Whatever. Tell me, where is Lu Ming?”</p><p>Mo jiuye said indifferently.</p><p>“It’s on that planet!”</p><p>The Supreme Holy Son pointed at the fiery red Planet in the sky and said.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go to that planet then!”</p><p>A cold glint flashed in mo jiuye’s eyes. He took the lead and soared into the sky, flying towards the planet where Lu Ming and the rest were.</p><p>At the same time, the other experts from the unique devil Academy also followed mo jiuye.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s see how you die this time!”</p><p>A cold glint flashed in the Supreme Holy son’s eyes. Then, he, the drift light Holy Son, and the others followed the people from the unique devil Academy and rushed toward the planet where Lu Ming was.</p><p>Not long after, mo jiuye, the Supreme Holy Son, and the rest landed on the planet where Lu Ming was. However, they could not find him after looking around.</p><p>“Could Lu Ming and the rest have left this planet?”</p><p>A genius from the unique demon Academy said.</p><p>I don’t think so. They just arrived on this planet not long ago, so they’ll definitely spend some time searching. It’s just that this planet is very large, so we haven’t encountered them yet.</p><p>The Supreme Saint said.</p><p>“Then we’ll split up. Four-eyed, you take a few people with you and move together with universe master and the others. I’ll take a few people with me. Remember, once you encounter Lu Ming and the others, immediately send me a message, in case he gets away,”</p><p>Mo jiuye ordered.</p><p>“Yes, once we meet Lu Ming, he won’t be able to escape!”</p><p>Four-eyed Kong ting said with confidence.</p><p>The eyes of universe master flashed, but he didn’t say anything. He knew that this was the best arrangement.</p><p>The four-eye void courtyard’s combat strength was not any weaker than his. If he joined forces with the four-eye void courtyard, he would not have to fear Lu Ming. Once mo jiuye arrived, Lu Ming would be dead for sure.</p><p>After the distribution, mo jiuye brought the few heaven’s favorites and left.</p><p>Four eye void court and Supreme universe took a group of people and set off from another direction.</p><p>……</p><p>Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang had no idea that the Supreme Holy Son had joined forces with the unique demon Academy and had already arrived on this planet.</p><p>They continued their search on this planet.</p><p>This planet really didn’t have any living beings. They could only search in the dark.</p><p>One had to admit that they were really lucky. Two days later, they found an altar in a Canyon. Above the altar, there was a bronze array plate floating.</p><p>There were only twelve array plates in total, and they actually saw one. This luck was indeed amazing.</p><p>The two of them were overjoyed. Just as they were about to fly over and take the array plate, a few figures rushed over at an astonishing speed.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, he appeared in front of Lu Ming and the rest, blocking their way.</p><p>“Supreme universe, it’s you again. Four eyes void court, why are you two together?”</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang’s eyes suddenly changed after she looked around.</p><p>“Send a message to the Divine Child!”</p><p>At that moment, four-eye void court ordered one of the geniuses from the unique demon Academy to send a message to mo jiuye. As for himself, his four eyes flickered with a cold light as he stared at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Hehehe, Lu Ming, Ouyang Qingxiang, let’s see where you can run to this time!”</p><p>The Supreme Holy son’s figure flashed and appeared behind Lu Ming and the others, blocking their path of retreat.</p><p>“Supreme universe, you actually joined hands with the people from the unique devil Academy? To deal with the disciples of Kong Xuan sect?”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang angrily shouted. Her face was ugly as she looked around.</p><p>She was afraid that mo jiuye would be nearby and that would be dangerous. However, she heaved a sigh of relief when she did not see mo jiuye.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Ouyang Qingxiang, it’s your fault for being so stubborn and going against me. You deserve to die a thousand times!”</p><p>The Supreme Holy Son roared ferociously, then said to four-eyed empty court, ” “Four eyes void court, let’s attack together and stall Lu Ming.”</p><p>“There’s no need for us to join forces to deal with a mere Lu Ming. Supreme universe, I think you’re becoming more and more useless. Let me do it!”</p><p>Four eyes looked at the Supreme Holy Son in disdain.</p><p>He could clearly sense that Lu Ming’s cultivation base was only at true God-level. He did not believe that a true God-level person could go against him.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>&Nbsp; ” die!   four-eyed Kong ting’s body exuded a berserk energy, vast divine power surging out.</p><p>He was a sixth level heavenly God with four eyes. He was the same as the Supreme Holy Son, a sixth level heavenly God who could control the divine power.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>With a wave of his hand, four-eyed void court’s fingers shot out beams of spear radiance. They were sharp and dazzling as they charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>ancient God tactic, space-breaking …</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming cast the ancient God tactic and transformed into the ancient God Body. He continuously thrust the long spear in his hand and destroyed the spear radiance in the void.</p><p>the body of the ancient God! You’ve also cultivated the body of the ancient God!</p><p>The four-eyed void beast roared in disbelief. Its four eyes were filled with envy and jealousy. It turned into a stream of light and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, his four eyes glowed. Then, four terrifying beams of light burst out and shot towards Lu Ming. The power was extremely terrifying.</p><p>“Break the air, break the air …”</p><p>Lu Ming continuously cast the first move of the three apocalyptic strikes, shaking the long spear. In an instant, terrifying spear radiance shot out and blocked the four-eyed void’s attack.</p><p>he’s so strong. How is this possible? ”</p><p>At this moment, the four-eye void was shocked.</p><p>He finally knew why the Supreme Holy Son had been defeated by Lu Ming. It was not because the Supreme Holy Son was useless, but because Lu Ming was too abnormal.</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar rang out as Lu Ming cast the divine Dragon materialization technique. He used all sorts of techniques to attack the four-eye void.</p><p>The four-eyed void court’s combat strength was indeed very powerful. It was not weaker than the Supreme universe. The attack that burst out from its four eyes was especially terrifying. Even Lu Ming was rather afraid.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two of them had exchanged more than a dozen moves.</p><p>The more they fought, the more shocked four-eye void was. He felt that he was no match for Lu Ming.</p><p>“Supreme universe, attack together!”</p><p>The Four-Eyes void court roared.</p><p>“I already told you that we’re going to attack together!”</p><p>The universe supremacy mocked him. Then, he transformed into the Supreme guardian deity and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>The two of them joined forces and Lu Ming was at a disadvantage.</p><p>On the other side, the others charged toward Ouyang Qingxiang, putting her in a precarious situation.</p><p>“We can’t stay here for long!”</p><p>Lu Ming had many thoughts in his mind and planned to leave first.</p><p>Even universe master or four-eyed void court were no match for Lu Ming on their own. However, if the two of them joined forces, Lu Ming would be no match for them. At most, he could only protect himself.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
