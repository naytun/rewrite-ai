It was even more remote than the chaotic astral River.</p><p>This was because there were very few living beings in this Galaxy. There were even fewer cultivators and very few deities. Thus, very few people would come here.</p><p>Each major force had only set up a symbolic teleportation point in dark ice Galaxy and sent a few people to guard it.</p><p>Through the teleportation array, Lu Ming and the rest arrived at the teleportation point. Then, Grand Elder fan waved his hand and a divine force enveloped them, bringing them to the starry sky of the universe at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>“What a shocking speed!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the stars flying past him one after another and he was shocked.</p><p>The divine King experts were too fast. They were faster than most of the starships.</p><p>In fact, after reaching the divine King realm, there was almost no need to use an interplanetary warship. Unless it was a rare and high-grade one, the speed of an ordinary interplanetary warship couldn’t even match the flying speed of a Divine King.</p><p>Half a day later, a dazzling light suddenly flashed in the starry sky ahead.</p><p>In the starry sky ahead, circles of light appeared. They were extremely dazzling, even more resplendent than the stars, illuminating the universe.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest stopped.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>Everyone looked ahead in shock.</p><p>It was because the Rings of light were too big, many times bigger than a life planet.</p><p>this is our destination. There’s a Galaxy ahead!</p><p>Grand Elder fan explained.</p><p>Everyone looked over and saw that there was indeed a Galaxy in front of them.</p><p>At the core of this Galaxy was a star. However, this star’s light was extremely dim, as if it was going to be extinguished at any moment.</p><p>There were about a dozen planets revolving around the star.</p><p>The Rings of light were emitted from the surroundings of this Galaxy. One could imagine how huge it was.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, a series of terrifying rumbles burst out from the periphery of the Galaxy. A brilliant divine light illuminated the starry sky, and the terrifying explosion shook the entire Galaxy.</p><p>“There’s an expert attacking that Galaxy …”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang exclaimed.</p><p>“That’s right. There are indeed experts attacking this Galaxy. It’s the sect heads of the Qin heavenly thirteen clans and some Godking elders.”</p><p>Grand Elder fan explained.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were even more shocked.</p><p>The sect heads of the Qin heaven thirteen clans had actually arrived. There were also some Divine King realm elders. They were all attacking this Galaxy. What was inside this Galaxy?</p><p>let me tell you. Someone has set up a formation in this entire Galaxy. The Rings of light are the light from the formation. The sect heads of the Qin heaven thirteen clans and the Godking experts will find it difficult to break through.</p><p>Grand Elder fan explained.</p><p>“Use the Galaxy to set up a formation!”</p><p>Lu Ming and the group were dumbfounded.</p><p>How big was a Galaxy? someone had actually set up a large formation in the entire Galaxy. What kind of terrifying and Grand work was this? it really made people exclaim in admiration.</p><p>“Elder fan, what exactly is in this formation? You’ve actually attracted the attention of the heaven raising thirteen clans. Also, what does this have to do with us?”</p><p>The Supreme Saint asked.</p><p>The sect heads of the Qin heaven thirteen clans and a few Divine King elders had come. What did that have to do with them?</p><p>With their cultivation, they couldn’t do anything at all.</p><p>“Don’t be anxious. We have to start from the beginning …”</p><p>Following that, Grand Elder fan explained the ins and outs of the matter in detail.</p><p>Usually, no one would pay attention to Darklight Galaxy, and almost no one would come.</p><p>However, a few months ago, someone had accidentally discovered an extremely strange Galaxy here. After some deliberation, they discovered that a large formation had been set up in this Galaxy.</p><p>Such a grand move quickly alarmed the higher-ups of the Qin heaven thirteen high school. The Qin heaven thirteen clans immediately sent experts who were proficient in formations to study it and finally came to a shocking conclusion.</p><p>In the distant past, someone had set up a large formation in the entire Galaxy with the star as the core, with the purpose of refining the star core.</p><p>To refine an entire star into a star core.</p><p>The moment this news came out, it shocked the majority of the God King experts of the Qin heaven thirteen clans.</p><p>This was because once a cultivator reached the divine King realm, he would have to condense a star core.</p><p>After a heavenly God broke through to the divine King realm, the divine fire in the body would turn into a star core.</p><p>A star nucleus was the core of a star, and it contained boundless power.</p><p>However, the core of a King God Realm star was still very fragile and small. It couldn’t be compared to the core of a star.</p><p>Someone actually wanted to refine a star into a star core.</p><p>A star core refined from a star was definitely a priceless treasure. If a God King could obtain it, his cultivation would definitely advance by leaps and bounds.</p><p>Moreover, some formation Masters had already concluded that this formation had been set up for a very long time. The star had almost been refined, and the star core had been successfully refined.</p><p>It would be strange if those godkings were not tempted. If they could obtain a star core, their cultivation would advance by leaps and bounds. They would then be able to suppress the other godkings and dominate the Qin heaven star realm.</p><p>Hence, the sect heads of the Qin heaven thirteen clans and many other godkings descended in an attempt to fight for the star core. However, they were blocked by the formation of the Galaxy.</p><p>After a few months of attacks, many experts were unable to break through the formation and enter the galaxy.</p><p>After the research of many array Masters, it was estimated that only the prodigies of the younger generation could enter this Galaxy.</p><p>This was because the formation had been specially set up. If one’s age exceeded a certain range, they would not be able to enter at all.</p><p>That was why they had gathered them together.</p><p>it’s not just our Kong Xuan sect. The top geniuses of the other forces have all been gathered.</p><p>however, the sect leaders and the Godking elders are still unwilling to give up. They want to make one last attempt to see if they can break this formation.</p><p>Grand Elder fan finally explained.</p><p>Lu Ming and the group finally came to a realization. They finally knew what had happened.</p><p>At the front, the sect heads and the divine King elders were trying to break the formation for the last time. If they still couldn’t break it, they would probably have to send the younger generation.</p><p>No wonder all the Holy Sons and holy virgins were gathered here this time. They might have to compete with the top geniuses of other forces, even the geniuses of the three overlords.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In the starry sky ahead, the rumbling sounds continued, and dazzling light flashed.</p><p>“Come with me!”</p><p>Grand Elder fan led Lu Ming and the group forward.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At this time, other streams of light also flew over from other directions.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest swept their gazes and saw that each stream of light was a figure.</p><p>Each of them had a Divine King expert and a group of young people.</p><p>It was obvious that these were experts from other forces, and they had brought their Young heaven’s pride experts.</p><p>After flying for a while, they stopped not far from the Galaxy ahead.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
