Not long ago, he could only compete with people on the true God ranking list. How could he kill people at the level of a Saint, and two of them at that?</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>Coincidentally, the Tian Hong Saint son and the transient light Saint son were also resting in the Kong Xuan sect’s base. They shook their heads in disbelief after hearing the news.</p><p>Lu Ming could kill people at the level of a Saint?</p><p>They knew the dark battle Saint son of the unique devil Academy and the sword star Saint son of the indestructible sword sect. They were both very powerful and were not inferior to them at all.</p><p>If Lu Ming could kill the dark warrior, wouldn’t Jian Xing be able to kill them too?</p><p>“This …”</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang, Yue Linglong, Wu Zifeng, an hai, and the others also looked at each other in disbelief.</p><p>Even the divine King of Kong Xuan sect, Wu Wei, was stunned.</p><p>This matter was also out of his expectations.</p><p>They finally understood why the two major factions had mobilized so many people, including the godkings. The death of a Saint was indeed a major event.</p><p>I think you’ve misunderstood. Lu Ming is just a new disciple of Kong Xuan sect. How could he kill two of your Saint children? ”</p><p>Wu Wei said after sorting out his thoughts.</p><p>“If this isn’t true, why would we come here?”</p><p>The Godking of the unique devil Academy coldly said.</p><p>that’s right. Wu Wei, cut the crap and hand Lu Ming over!</p><p>The God King of the inextinguishable sword sect was even more direct and overbearing.</p><p>“You two, this is the land of the ancient God. There are always risks when you take risks and fight outside. It’s common for you to die. If Lu Ming really killed your two Holy Sons, it doesn’t make sense for you to come to my Kong Xuan sect like this, does it? There have been many Kong Xuan sect members who died at the hands of the disciples of your two superpowers when we were out!”</p><p>Wu Wei’s voice turned cold and he said unhappily.</p><p>It was normal to die while adventuring and fighting outside. If one was afraid of dying outside, they might as well stay at home.</p><p>“Humph, Wu Wei, are you mocking the Holy Son of my unique demon Academy for being weak?”</p><p>The Godking of the unique devil Academy’s voice turned gloomy. A powerful aura emanated from his body as he said, if it was a normal battle, if my disciples were killed, I would not say anything. However, this time, it was your disciple Lu Ming who used despicable means to secretly harm the Holy Son of my unique demon Academy. Besides that, there were also eight first to fifth level heavenly gods. Does Lu Ming have the ability to do so? ”</p><p>The Godking of the unique devil Academy loudly questioned.</p><p>that’s right. Lu Ming also used despicable means to harm the Holy Son of the eternal sword sect and other experts!</p><p>The God King from the inextinguishable sword sect said.</p><p>I see, I see. It was actually an assassination. No wonder, no wonder …</p><p>Almost everyone in the Kong Xuan sect believed him.</p><p>This was the only way it could be justified. In a head-on battle, Lu Ming had killed two of the enemy’s Holy Sons. They were in disbelief.</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son and the transient light Saint son both heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>It turned out that Lu Ming had relied on an hai to cause the death of the dark warrior. Jian Xing did not rely on his true abilities. They were relieved.</p><p>this brat actually dared to harm the Holy Son of the indestructible sword sect and the unique demon Academy. This time, I don’t even need to do anything. He’s dead for sure!</p><p>When the Tian Hong Saint son and the sacred son of reflection thought of this, they became happy.</p><p>The divine King of Kong Xuan sect, Wu Wei, also fell silent.</p><p>If that was the case, he really had no reason to stop her.</p><p>Wuwei, hand Lu Ming over. We don’t have time to waste!</p><p>The God King of the inextinguishable sword sect berated.</p><p>Wu Wei frowned. He was also in a difficult position.</p><p>Lu Ming was a prodigy of the Kong Xuan sect. Naturally, he was unwilling to hand him over to the other party. However, he was facing two godkings. Even if he wanted to protect Lu Ming, he could not.</p><p>you two have come at the wrong time. Lu Ming is not in the base of Kong Xuan sect. Even if I wanted to hand him over, I can’t!</p><p>Wu Wei’s gaze shifted as he spoke.</p><p>In fact, he did not know if Lu Ming was in the base. He had made up this reason and did not want to hand Lu Ming over.</p><p>“Whether it’s there or not, I’ll know once I search with my spiritual sense!”</p><p>The cold voice of the Godking from the unique devil Academy sounded. His spiritual sense burst out like a vast ocean and swept toward the base of the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>“How can you search my Kong Xuan sect’s base as you please?”</p><p>Wu Wei’s face darkened. He unleashed his powerful spiritual consciousness and blocked the spiritual consciousness of the Godking of the unique devil Academy.</p><p>Wuwei, you want to stop the two of us by yourself? in your dreams. Let me fight you.</p><p>The Godking of the indestructible sword sect spoke. Following that, a sword cry shook the nine Heavens. A resplendent sword light suddenly appeared in the sky, towering between the heavens and earth. No one knew how long and how big it was, but it blocked out the sun as it slashed down towards the base of the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>Wu Wei’s expression changed and his dazzling divine power burst out. He soared into the sky and turned into a rainbow light, rushing toward the huge sword light.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>It was as if the entire world was shaking and shaking.</p><p>The might of a Godking was so terrifying!</p><p>This was also because the two of them had controlled their divine power so that it did not leak out. Otherwise, the shock caused would be even more shocking.</p><p>The two of them exchanged a blow and faced each other in the sky, exuding a terrifying pressure.</p><p>As such, Wu Wei no longer had the ability to stop the godkings of the unique demon Academy.</p><p>The Godking of the Yimo Academy coldly snorted. He took a step forward and appeared in the sky above the base of the Kong Xuan sect. He sent out his powerful spiritual consciousness, but after a while, his expression slightly darkened.</p><p>“Lu Ming is indeed not here!”</p><p>The Godking of the unique devil Academy coldly said.</p><p>Hearing this, Wu Wei felt relieved.</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang, Yue Linglong, and the others also heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>Although they did not see Lu Ming in the base, they were still afraid that Lu Ming might be in seclusion somewhere in the base. That would be dangerous.</p><p>“He’s not here?”</p><p>The God King from the indestructible sword sect’s face also darkened.</p><p>I know. Lu Ming is not at the Kong Xuan sect’s base. He’s most likely at the ice Soul clan’s base. Lu Ming was very close to them.</p><p>One of the geniuses from the unique demon Academy shouted. This person was the one who had followed the dark battle earlier. He had seen that Lu Ming and Bing Qing were very close.</p><p>“The ice Soul Clan!”</p><p>The godkings of the Yimo Academy and the indestructible sword sect narrowed their eyes slightly.</p><p>The ice Soul Clan was not a clan that the Kong Xuan sect could bully.</p><p>The ice Soul Clan was one of the two strongest clans in the qintian Galaxy. They were even stronger than the Yimo Academy and the indestructible sword sect. They could only be a match for the ice Soul Clan if the two forces worked together.</p><p>However, they were unwilling to give up just like that.</p><p>The two of them looked at each other and saw the determination in each other’s eyes.</p><p>Hmph, it’s useless even if you hide in the ice Soul Clan. You must pay with your life for using such despicable means to harm the Holy Son of our unique demon Academy!</p><p>The Godking of the unique devil Academy coldly spoke.”Let’s go. We’ll go to the ice Soul Clan to get him!”</p><p>Then, he flew toward the ice Soul Clan.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
