Then, his gaze fell on Lu Ming and he asked,”I heard from Qingxiang that you have something you need my help with?”</p><p>“Yes, senior Yue. Junior wants to refine a type of formation disk, but Junior’s cultivation level is too low, so junior can’t refine it. Only Godking experts can refine it, so junior thought of senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not hide anything and told him his purpose directly.</p><p>“What formation plate? It even requires a Godking to refine it?”</p><p>Yue Wu Ya was also interested.</p><p>“Senior, please take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out a jade talisman and with a wave of his hand, the Jade talisman flew towards Yue Wu Ya.</p><p>Yue Wuya took it and scanned it with his spiritual sense, reading the contents of the talisman.</p><p>After a while, Yue Wu Ya revealed an expression of surprise, and said, ” “What a profound formation plate. The method of making such a formation plate is truly unheard of. It’s amazing, amazing. No wonder you can’t make it with your cultivation base …”</p><p>hehe, don’t you know who gave you the array disc? how can the array disc given by this Lord be bad? ”</p><p>The bone Devil’s proud voice sounded.</p><p>“Senior, this is something this junior obtained by chance while exploring some ancient ruins. May I ask if senior is able to refine it?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“This old man can refine it, but the materials needed to refine this array disc are quite rare. Even this old man can’t gather them in a short time!”</p><p>Yue Wu Ya said.</p><p>“Senior, the materials are not a problem, this junior has already gathered them!”</p><p>After Lu Ming finished speaking, he took out the materials needed to refine the array disc one by one.</p><p>“The heart of desolation? Lu Ming, you actually have the heart of desolation?”</p><p>When he saw Lu Ming take out the heart of desolation, even Yue Wuya was shocked. Lu Ming’s weight in his heart increased even more.</p><p>“This junior got this by luck!”</p><p>Lu Ming said humbly.</p><p>Yue Wuya smiled. He knew that Lu Ming was being humble.</p><p>If he could get it if he was lucky, why couldn’t others get it?</p><p>“Lu Ming, since the materials are ready, I can start refining now. However, it will take a few months to complete the refining. I’ll send someone to inform you when I’m done.”</p><p>Yue Wu Ya said.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior. Senior, junior has a request. I hope that senior will not tell anyone else about the formation plate, especially the other godkings.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>If news of this formation plate were to spread to Dragon Boat Mountain or if Dragon Boat Mountain were to see it, it would most likely cause Dragon Boat Mountain to be on guard.</p><p>Yue Wuya looked at Lu Ming in surprise. He did not understand why Lu Ming did not dare to let the other God kings know about this. However, he did not probe further and nodded.”Don’t worry, I won’t let a second person know.”</p><p>“Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists in thanks and left the place with Ouyang Qingxiang.</p><p>It could be refined in a few months ‘time, and there was enough time.</p><p>Dragon boats mountain had given Lu Ming ten years.</p><p>After returning to his residence, Lu Ming cultivated in peace.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a few months had passed.</p><p>Yue Wuya had already finished refining the array disc and asked Ouyang Xiangxiang to bring it to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a sigh of relief and felt much more confident.</p><p>this kind of cultivation is too slow. Wanting to break through to the celestial deity realm within ten years is simply impossible!</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming ended his cultivation and frowned in deep thought.</p><p>From peak ninth stage true God to celestial deity realm, there was a huge natural chasm. Wanting to break through was seriously too difficult.</p><p>Ninety-nine percent of the people were stuck at the peak of true God forever, unable to break through.</p><p>Only those with extraordinary talent, after a long period of accumulation, or by chance, could break through.</p><p>Therefore, those who could break through to the heavenly God Realm were mostly geniuses who had mastered King-grade divine power.</p><p>The higher the level of Shen power, the easier it would be to break through.</p><p>Most of those who controlled ordinary divine power found it difficult to break through to the heavenly God Realm. Of course, it was not absolute. There were also those who controlled ordinary divine power who broke through to the heavenly God Realm, but they were very few, very few.</p><p>However, even the heaven’s favorites with the highest level of divine power would find it hard to break through to the celestial God Realm within ten years after just breaking through to the peak of stage nine true God Realm, unless they had a great opportunity.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He had no doubt that if he could not break through to the enlightened master level within ten years, the Dragon boats would really attack him.</p><p>Lu Ming was thinking about what method he could use to quickly make a breakthrough in his cultivation level. At this moment, Lu Ming’s heart stirred. He sensed that someone was coming to the courtyard.</p><p>Lu Ming walked out of the courtyard and saw a white-haired elder standing in the air.</p><p>“Holy Son Lu Ming!”</p><p>The white-haired old man nodded with a smile.</p><p>“Elder Liu, why have you come to find me?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>Lu Ming recognized this white-haired elder. He was an inner sect elder.</p><p>the sect master has summoned all the Holy Sons and holy virgins. He has a mission for you!</p><p>Elder Liu said.</p><p>“A mission? He even gathered all the Holy Sons and holy virgins? What is the mission?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled and asked.</p><p>to be honest, I don’t know either. I’m only in charge of passing on the message. Holy Son Lu Ming, follow me. A senior elder will tell you later.</p><p>Elder Liu said courteously. Then, Lu Ming followed elder Liu and flew toward the depths of the inner sect.</p><p>Soon, the two of them arrived at the peak of a mountain.</p><p>“Everyone’s here!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked around and saw that the Supreme Saint son, the transient light Saint son, the Yan Kong Saint son, the Zhi Xia Saint son, Ouyang Qingxiang, and the Xue Tan Saint were all here.</p><p>Everyone’s gaze fell on Lu Ming when they saw him approaching.</p><p>Especially the Supreme Holy Son. A cold glint flashed in his eyes, revealing a wisp of killing intent. However, it was only a flash before it was concealed.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s spiritual senses were very sharp and he could still clearly capture it.</p><p>“You want to kill me? Hmph, it’s best if I don’t find an opportunity …”</p><p>A murderous intent flashed across Lu Ming’s heart.</p><p>It was obvious that the Supreme Holy Son had lost to Lu Ming last time and held a grudge against him, wanting to kill him.</p><p>If there was a chance, Lu Ming would not be soft-hearted and would find a chance to get rid of such a person.</p><p>His gaze swept past the Supreme Saint son, the transient light Saint son, and the others before landing on an old man at the very front.</p><p>“Doyen!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. From the old man’s attire, Lu Ming could tell that he was an elder of the Kong Xuan sect’s Senate, a Divine King.</p><p>Elder Liu landed in front of the doyen and bowed respectfully, ” “Grand Elder, I’ve brought Holy Son Lu Ming.”</p><p>“En, you may leave!”</p><p>The doyen said indifferently. Then, elder Liu left respectfully.</p><p>Only Lu Ming, the Holy Sons and holy virgins, and the doyen were left on the mountain peak.</p><p>you must be very curious about what kind of mission has gathered you all here for, right? ”</p><p>The elder smiled.</p><p>“That’s right. Grand Elder fan, may I know why you’ve gathered all of us at the same time?”</p><p>The Supreme Saint was the first to ask.</p><p>this time, there’s indeed a big matter that requires all of you to join forces. The location will be in Darklight Galaxy. As for the specific matter, don’t be in a hurry. Follow me. When we reach Darklight galaxy, I’ll naturally tell you. Let’s go!</p><p>After elder fan finished speaking, he headed in the direction of the teleportation array.</p><p>Everyone could only carry their doubts as they followed Grand Elder fan and stepped into the teleportation array.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
