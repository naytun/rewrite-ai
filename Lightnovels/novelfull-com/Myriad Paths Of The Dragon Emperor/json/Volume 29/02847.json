Only then can I release the soul of the ancestor?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>the ancestor’s soul was sealed in a bronze altar in the ancestral land. This bronze altar sank into the depths of a demonic Lake. The demonic Lake has a mysterious power. The stronger the cultivation, the stronger the rejection force. The weaker the cultivation, the weaker the rejection force.</p><p>moreover, only those with extremely dense ancient God bloodline can enter. From ancient times until now, no one from the descendants of the ancient gods has been able to step into the bottom of the demonic Lake and release the souls of our ancestors.</p><p>as for you, you awakened the green-armored ancient God Body as soon as you awakened. This is unprecedented in the history of the descendants of the ancient gods. Only you can enter the bottom of the devil Lake, break the seal, and release the soul of our ancestor.</p><p>The first clan leader explained in detail.</p><p>Lu Ming finally understood.</p><p>It turned out that the ancestral land of the descendants of the ancient gods was in a demonic Lake. People of different cultivation bases would suffer different rejection forces when they entered the demonic Lake.</p><p>The stronger one’s cultivation was, the stronger the rejection force would be. It was no wonder that even a God King could not do it and had to come to Lu Ming.</p><p>patriarchs, I can go to the ancestral land and release the souls of my ancestors, but if I’m lucky enough to succeed, you have to agree to one condition of mine.</p><p>Lu Ming said after thinking for a while.</p><p>“What condition?”</p><p>The first clan leader asked.</p><p>to be honest, I actually know some friends in the outside world. Some friends have also come to this world. My condition is that if I release the souls of my ancestors, you have to promise not to hurt my friends.</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>He was still worried about Ouyang Xiangxiang, Yue Linglong, and the others.</p><p>“That’s easy. What do your friends look like? we’ll let them go when we see them.”</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>The ten clan leaders all nodded. This was a small matter to them.</p><p>“Many thanks to all the clan leaders.”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists in thanks. Then, he took out a jade talisman and described the appearance and temperament of Ouyang Xiangxiang, Yue Linglong, Wu Zifeng, an hai, and the others. He then handed it to the ten clan leaders.</p><p>“Alright, Lu Ming, come with us.”</p><p>The first clan leader stood up first and walked towards the back of the stone Hall.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest followed.</p><p>After passing through a secret passage, they arrived at a barren land.</p><p>“Lu Ming, keep walking along this barren land. You’ll see the demonic Lake in front of you. There’s already a strong repelling force in this place. We won’t go in.”</p><p>The first clan leader said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and stepped out. He walked into the depths of the forsaken land alone.</p><p>“I hope he can succeed!”</p><p>once the ancestor’s soul is released, our clan can truly rest easy and become stronger and stronger.</p><p>“Alright, let’s set up the formation.”</p><p>The ten clan patriarchs sighed softly and revealed looks of anticipation. Then, they all left the place to set up the formation.</p><p>Once the ancestor’s soul was released, the formation they set up would be able to control the ancestor’s soul.</p><p>Lu Ming was walking alone on the barren land.</p><p>As soon as he entered, he felt a repulsive force acting on his body, as if it was trying to expel him.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A roar came from Lu Ming’s body, and the ancient God’s heart started to thump. A thick ancient God aura filled the air, and the repelling force disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming walked on the barren land with ease.</p><p>The forsaken land was truly a barren land. It was deathly silent, and there was nothing.</p><p>Lu Ming began to speed up and continued to fly forward.</p><p>This area was shockingly large. About half an hour later, a Lake appeared in front of them. The lake wasn’t big, but it was very strange because the water was pitch black.</p><p>Lu Ming had seen many strange things along the way, so he did not take it to heart. He circulated his divine power and set it around his body. At the same time, he cast the nine-layered Crimson Gold armor. A Crimson Gold armor appeared on his body.</p><p>Plop!</p><p>Lu Ming jumped into the lake. At that moment, he felt a strong force surging towards him from all directions, trying to expel him.</p><p>It was the same repulsive force, but the force in the lake was a hundred times stronger than outside.</p><p>Lu Ming’s protective divine energy and the nine-layered Scarlet Gold armor could not resist the repulsive force at all.</p><p>Lu Ming was almost expelled.</p><p>Thump thump thump …</p><p>At this critical moment, the ancient God’s heart started beating rapidly and emitted a thick ancient God aura. As soon as the ancient God aura was released, the external force was weakened greatly, allowing Lu Ming to barely withstand it.</p><p>“Down!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He adjusted his body and dived into the lake.</p><p>The deeper Lu Ming went, the stronger the repulsive force at the bottom of the lake became.</p><p>After diving for a few thousand meters, the repelling force had reached a shocking level. Even the aura of the ancient God’s heart could not withstand it.</p><p>“Ancient God tactic …”</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming used the ancient God tactic. His body rapidly expanded and transformed into the body of an ancient God.</p><p>After transforming into the ancient God Body, Lu Ming’s resistance increased greatly. He blocked the repulsive force around him and began to dive faster.</p><p>The demonic Lake was very deep. Lu Ming dived a full eight thousand meters before he finally reached the bottom of the lake.</p><p>“A bronze altar.”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>It was pitch black at the bottom of the lake. Even if Lu Ming circulated his divine power, he could only see a few dozen meters away. He had to look for it slowly.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately started searching the bottom of the lake.</p><p>He searched for more than an hour, but he still found nothing.</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He held his temper and continued to search.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He saw a ray of light in front of him. It was the light of metal.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. Perhaps he had found the bronze altar.</p><p>Lu Ming strode forward. However, he was disappointed when he walked in.</p><p>It was not a bronze altar, but a bronze coffin!</p><p>There was a purple-copper coffin that gave off a dim light. It looked extremely old and ancient.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless to find a purple-copper coffin at the bottom of the demonic Lake.</p><p>“I want to eat, I want to eat …”</p><p>QiuQiu’s voice rang out. It actually pounced directly at the purple copper coffin, opened its mouth, and bit down on the purple copper coffin.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The sound of metal breaking rang out. However, what broke wasn’t the purple copper coffin, but QiuQiu’s teeth.</p><p>The teeth in QiuQiu’s mouth shattered all over the ground.</p><p>“It hurts so much. What is this thing? it’s too hard.”</p><p>QiuQiu bounced back to Lu Ming’s wrist and turned into a bracelet, trembling.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming knew very well how good QiuQiu’s teeth were. Any metal that fell into its mouth would make a crunching sound.</p><p>Even the bronze door, which many Divine King experts couldn’t damage in the slightest, QiuQiu still managed to bite off a piece. However, QiuQiu actually couldn’t bite through this purple bronze coffin. It didn’t even leave a bite mark on it.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
