After arriving, QiuQiu became excited. Its big mouth was gnawing and its eyes were shining as it stared at a cave at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>“QiuQiu, could there be a treasure in this cave?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred as he asked.</p><p>“That’s right. I can feel that there’s a type of metal in this cave. It’s a very precious metal. If I eat it, it’ll definitely help me evolve and break through to the heavenly God Realm.”</p><p>QiuQiu responded with its spiritual will.</p><p>“He can break through to the heavenly God Realm?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>With QiuQiu’s strength, if it could break through to the celestial deity realm, its combat strength would definitely be extremely terrifying and would be a great help to him.</p><p>If he ran into the Tian Hong Saint son and the sacred son of reflection’s subordinates, he wouldn’t have to be afraid anymore.</p><p>“Kid, I can feel that there are many powerful demons living in this cave.”</p><p>The bone Devil’s voice sounded.</p><p>“Senior bone demon, can you sense the strength of the demon in this cave?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“The strongest one is only at the first level heavenly deity realm. There’s only one. The rest are all below the heavenly deity realm.”</p><p>Bone said.</p><p>“There’s only one first level heavenly God Realm demon. I’ll go all out.”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a determined look.</p><p>“QiuQiu, get ready for battle!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to play the ball.</p><p>Then, he started to activate the battle formula.</p><p>After more than twenty years of cultivation, Lu Ming’s understanding of the battle character formula had deepened. The success rate of triggering the fourfold combat strength had also increased significantly. He would succeed once out of more than ten times.</p><p>After more than ten times of triggering, Lu Ming successfully triggered the quadruple combat strength and raised his status to the maximum. He then carefully approached the cave.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>When Lu Ming was near the cave, a red light suddenly shot out from the cave and pierced between Lu Ming’s eyebrows. Before it reached him, a foul smell had already hit his face.</p><p>“A tongue …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He could see clearly that the red light was actually an animal’s tongue.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming shook the long spear and it struck the tongue hard.</p><p>However, when the long spear hit the tongue, there was no force at all. The tongue was soft and easily deflected the force of the long spear. It turned and stabbed toward Lu Ming again.</p><p>“Hmph, small tricks!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold. He put away the spear and covered his palm with divine power. He grabbed the Scarlet tongue and then burst out with the ultimate cold divine power, pouring it into the tongue.</p><p>Instantly, the tongue was frozen into a popsicle. Lu Ming swung his arm and the ‘popsicle’ broke into dozens of pieces.</p><p>Whoosh …</p><p>Immediately, a loud cry came from the cave, shaking the ground.</p><p>Then, a huge creature the size of a small mountain rushed out of the cave.</p><p>“It really is a Toad.”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>The huge creature that charged out was a huge toad. Its entire body was pitch-black and it was also filled with thick demonic Qi. It glared at Lu Ming with a venomous look.</p><p>This Toad had a cultivation of about ninth stage true God.</p><p>Whoosh …</p><p>Following that, there were cries continuously coming out from the cave, and black shadows jumped out one after another. They were all toads, and in a few moments, more than a dozen of them jumped out. They were all at the eighth or ninth stage of true God.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming charged forward. This time, he did not take out a long spear. Instead, he took out a combat sword.</p><p>“Moon slaying!”</p><p>Lu Ming used the moon slash at a Toad.</p><p>Whoosh …</p><p>The toad cried out and opened its mouth. Rays of pitch-black light burst out like blades, slashing at Lu Ming.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The combat sword kept clashing with the light, causing a violent explosion.</p><p>“What powerful strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was a little solemn.</p><p>This stage nine real God Toad was astonishingly powerful. Its fighting power was not any weaker than long Xian, who was ranked sixth on the real God ranking list.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s current abilities had also improved since his battle with long Xian.</p><p>“Moon slaying!”</p><p>Lu Ming pushed the three apocalyptic strikes to the extreme. The crescent-shaped sword radiance kept slashing out. At the same time, Lu Ming cast the ice chains. Nine ice chains flew out and wrapped around the toad.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming slashed the toad in half with his sword.</p><p>On the other side, QiuQiu was showing off its might.</p><p>When it was at the eighth stage true God Realm, its abilities were already very shocking and could crush Lu Ming. Now that it had broken through to the ninth stage true God Realm, its abilities were even stronger.</p><p>Its two arms turned into two sabers and kept slashing.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Every time he slashed out, a Toad would be killed.</p><p>Lu Ming had only killed one but QiuQiu had already killed six.</p><p>By the time Lu Ming killed the second Toad, QiuQiu had already killed all the other toads.</p><p>“Amazing!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and looked at QiuQiu. He could not help but look forward to how strong QiuQiu’s combat power would be after it broke through to the heavenly God-level.</p><p>With a flash, Lu Ming and QiuQiu rushed into the cave.</p><p>The cave was huge, and there were many different passages.</p><p>“This way …”</p><p>QiuQiu took the lead and flew toward a passage, followed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Along the way, toads would jump out from time to time, but they were all killed by QiuQiu’s blade.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming and the group had traveled a few hundred miles and bypassed many winding passages.</p><p>Finally, they came to a huge underground cave.</p><p>This underground cave was fiery red because the walls were embedded with pieces of fiery red gemstones that emitted red light.</p><p>At the very top of the cave, there was a piece of Crimson Metal the size of a human head. It was embedded in the wall and emitted powerful energy fluctuations.</p><p>“It’s that piece of metal, it’s that piece of metal …”</p><p>QiuQiu’s voice rang in Lu Ming’s mind. It then opened its mouth wide and pounced on the piece of metal.</p><p>Whoosh …</p><p>Right at this moment, a few loud shouts rang out, causing the underground cave to shake continuously. A black shadow pounced towards QiuQiu at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>“QiuQiu, be careful!”</p><p>Lu Ming reminded loudly. At the same time, he dashed toward the black shadow.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A Scarlet tongue lashed out at QiuQiu like a soft whip. QiuQiu was caught off guard and was directly whipped.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>QiuQiu was sent flying like a cannonball. It crashed into the wall and created a huge pit.</p><p>“Moon slaying!”</p><p>Lu Ming had already arrived. He cast moon slashing and slashed at the Scarlet tongue. However, the tongue flicked and a terrifying force exploded. Lu Ming’s body trembled and he could not help but fly backward.</p><p>“What powerful strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was solemn.</p><p>In front of them, a huge toad appeared. This Toad was two to three times bigger than the ones they had encountered before. Its body was filled with dense demonic Qi, and its aura was shocking.</p><p>Heavenly God Realm!</p><p>This Toad was a heavenly God. It should be the first level heavenly God that bone demon sensed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
