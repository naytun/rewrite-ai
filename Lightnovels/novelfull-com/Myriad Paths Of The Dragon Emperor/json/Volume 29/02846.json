Only with people alive can the tribe be preserved for eternity.</p><p>The patriarch of the eighth tribe had a determined expression, and his voice was decisive.</p><p>The other elders all sighed.</p><p>actually, it’s not just our eighth tribe. Some other tribes also need to prepare to retreat to the first tribe.</p><p>“Among the ten tribes, the first tribe is the strongest. Only by uniting all the other tribes can we fight against the demons and the outsiders. Otherwise, we will be defeated one by one.”</p><p>The chief of the eighth tribe spoke again.</p><p>“Alright, I agree to retreat!”</p><p>“I also agree!”</p><p>In the end, all the elders nodded and agreed to retreat.</p><p>In the current situation, the only way to survive was to retreat. Otherwise, they would die sooner or later.</p><p>“Prepare to retreat!”</p><p>The orders of the eighth tribe’s chief quickly spread throughout the entire tribe.</p><p>Although many people were unwilling to do so, they had no choice but to retreat.</p><p>The formation continued to be activated, and all the people of the eighth tribe retreated to the first tribe from another exit.</p><p>Lu Ming moved with the Army.</p><p>The first tribe was the strongest of the ten tribes and the tribe with the longest history. It was said that it was close to the core of the ancient God descendants.</p><p>In the past, Lu Ming had also come here to spar with experts.</p><p>Without a doubt, the first tribe was also caught in the flames of war.</p><p>However, the people from the other tribes kept retreating to the first tribe, which greatly increased the strength of the first tribe and finally stabilized the situation.</p><p>However, in comparison, the demons that were attacking the other tribes had also gathered. The first tribe was also facing a great problem. They had to activate their formation to resist.</p><p>As time passed, all the tribes retreated to the first tribe. Without a doubt, those tribes were all occupied by the demons and the Qin heaven thirteen clans.</p><p>the people from qintian No. 13 high school, the ice Soul Clan, and the Scarlet Flame clan are almost all here.</p><p>Standing on the majestic city wall, Lu Ming looked outside and saw the Qin heavenly thirteen clans, the ice Soul Clan, and the Scarlet Flame clan.</p><p>However, he did not see any familiar faces.</p><p>For example, Ouyang Xiangxiang, Yue Linglong, Bing Qing, and so on.</p><p>Outside the first tribe, the demons were roaring like thunder and attacking with all their might.</p><p>On this day, Gu Hongshan went to look for Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, the clan leaders are looking for you.”</p><p>Gu Hongshan said.</p><p>“Is there something the patriarchs need from me?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little stunned.</p><p>The tribe leaders were looking for him?</p><p>What for?</p><p>“I don’t know either. The clan leader asked me to come and find you.”</p><p>Gu Hongshan was also confused.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and followed Gu Hongshan to a huge stone Hall.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you can go in alone. You can’t go in without my order.”</p><p>Gu Hongshan said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and walked into the hall with doubts.</p><p>In the hall, there were two rows of seats, and some people were sitting on each row.</p><p>There was also a person sitting on the main seat.</p><p>These people all looked quite old, but their auras were extremely powerful, like an abyss, unfathomable.</p><p>There were ten people in total, and the patriarch of the eighth tribe was among them.</p><p>The Chiefs of the top ten tribes of the ancient God!</p><p>Lu Ming understood that this was the clan leader of the ten tribes of the ancient God.</p><p>“Lu Ming greets the clan leaders. May I know why you’re looking for me?”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists at the ten clan leaders.</p><p>The ten pairs of eyes swept across Lu Ming, as if they wanted to see through him.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re not the descendant of the ascetics but an outsider!”</p><p>The clan leader of the first tribe suddenly spoke, causing Lu Ming’s heart to beat wildly.</p><p>He had been exposed!</p><p>Lu Ming’s first reaction was that his identity had been exposed.</p><p>What to do?</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing, but he did not say anything.</p><p>“Lu Ming, although you can fool others, you can’t fool old people like us. Your various methods show that you’re from the outside world. You must be from the race that guards the world gate from the outside world, right?”</p><p>The leader of the first tribe spoke again. The other nine tribe leaders looked at Lu Ming with bright eyes.</p><p>“The race that guards the world gate? What did that mean? Are they talking about the descendants of the ancient gods outside the ancient gods Mountain?”</p><p>that must be the case. The bronze door is the door of the world they are talking about. The descendants of the ancient gods of ancient gods Mountain are guarding that door.</p><p>In an instant, many thoughts flashed through Lu Ming’s mind. He then nodded and said,”Not bad!”</p><p>“I knew it. You’re from The Guardian race. However, so many years have passed. Is your race still doing well?”</p><p>The first clan leader asked.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head. not good. My race is very weak outside. After so many years, many inheritances have been lost. I don’t know many things of the descendants of the ancient gods.</p><p>Since the other party thought that he was from the clan guarding the bronze door, he might as well pretend to be from that clan.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming had come into contact with that clan. That clan did not even know about the bronze door, let alone the world and secrets behind it. Clearly, too much time had passed and many things from that clan had been lost.</p><p>no wonder. However, it has been so long after all. It’s a fluke that your clan still exists.</p><p>The ten clan leaders nodded in agreement with Lu Ming’s statement.</p><p>Other than that race, who else could condense the ancient God’s heart?</p><p>This was also the reason why they allowed Lu Ming to stay here and even taught him the ancient God tactic. After all, the Guardians outside were also descendants of the ancient gods.</p><p>“Clan leaders, is this the reason why you’re looking for Lu Ming today?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>This was because he felt that the reason why the ten great clan patriarchs had gathered together to find him was not as simple as this.</p><p>“No, we’re looking for you for another matter.”</p><p>The first clan leader paused for a moment before he continued, ” “We have something to ask for your help!”</p><p>“You need my help?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>These patriarchs were all at the divine King realm. Why would they need help from a real God?</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>right now, we, the descendants of the ancient gods, are facing the joint attack of demons and outsiders. The situation is very unfavorable and dangerous. If this continues, we won’t be able to hold on for long before we’re captured.</p><p>The first clan leader said.</p><p>Lu Ming did not speak. He listened quietly. He knew that the other party had more to say.</p><p>now, there is only one way to save our clan and defeat the enemy. That is to awaken the souls of our ancestors!</p><p>The first clan leader said.</p><p>“Awaken the souls of our ancestors?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>that’s right. In the center of my clan, there is an ancestral land. Legend has it that the soul of my clan’s ancestor, the soul of an ancient God, is sealed there. As long as the seal is broken, the soul of my ancestor will come out.</p><p>the soul of the ancestor possesses a terrifying power. If we set up a formation and control it, it’ll be enough to repel the attacks of the demons and outsiders. It’s even possible to completely solve the problem of the demons in the northern desolate demon Plains.</p><p>The first clan leader said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
