QiuQiu, kill him!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand.</p><p>“Ah, you’ll die. horrible death. You broke your promise …”</p><p>The middle-aged man roared in anger, turned around, and ran.</p><p>However, he was only a first level heavenly deity, so how could he be QiuQiu’s match? QiuQiu caught up to him and killed him in a few moves.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming went forward and completely dealt with the old man with the surname Hong.</p><p>“A treasure …”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and revealed an interested expression.</p><p>Since he had nothing to do, he might as well go and take a look.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming flew to the location that the burly man told him.</p><p>However, Lu Ming maintained his vigilance. He restrained his aura, slowed down, and headed in that direction.</p><p>……</p><p>At this moment, in a place more than a hundred thousand miles away from Lu Ming.</p><p>Here, there was a dense forest with ancient trees that reached the sky.</p><p>The strange thing was that there were no trees in the middle of the forest. From a distance, one could see some stone buildings.</p><p>However, it was too far away and he couldn’t see clearly.</p><p>At this moment, a group of people were confronting each other on the outskirts of the forest.</p><p>This group of people was divided into four groups.</p><p>If other people were to see this, they would definitely be shocked.</p><p>This was because these four groups of people all had shocking backgrounds.</p><p>The indestructible sword sect, the Yimo Academy, and the boundless Holy Land.</p><p>The last group was the ice Soul Clan.</p><p>Each force had a few hundred people present.</p><p>“Everyone, this place was first discovered by our unique demon Academy. It should belong to our unique demon Academy. What is the meaning of this?”</p><p>A purple-robed young man in the unique demon Academy said coldly.</p><p>This purple-robed young man was a powerful Holy Son of the unique devil Academy.</p><p>“What a joke. You guys discovered it first, so it’s yours? This is an ownerless item, so anyone who sees it will have a share.”</p><p>Said a young man from the eternal sword sect.</p><p>This young man was a Holy Son of the indestructible sword sect. His status and strength were not inferior to that of the purple-robed young man from the unique demon Academy.</p><p>that’s right. Since you haven’t obtained the unique devil Academy, anyone can fight for the treasures inside!</p><p>The boundless Holy Land’s Saint child spoke coldly as he looked at the center of the forest with fiery eyes.</p><p>They could clearly feel that the energy of the world was constantly gathering towards that area, as if something was constantly absorbing the essence of the world Energy.</p><p>There was definitely a treasure inside.</p><p>The ice Soul Clan did not say anything, but their attitude spoke for itself.</p><p>The purple-robed young man and the others from the winged demon Academy looked terrible.</p><p>They knew that it was impossible for the unique devil Academy to monopolize this place.</p><p>“Then what are you going to do?”</p><p>The purple-robed youth said coldly.</p><p>simple. There are terrifying demons living in this forest. It won’t be easy to pass through. We’ll rely on our own abilities. Whoever can get the treasure will get it. We’ll talk with our strength.</p><p>The Saint of the inextinguishable sword sect smiled faintly, full of confidence.</p><p>“Alright, let’s do that.”</p><p>The purple-robed young man of the winged demon Academy had no choice but to agree.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Suddenly, the purple-robed young man from the winged demon Academy shouted coldly. His sharp eyes looked in one direction.</p><p>The other experts seemed to have sensed something as well and looked over.</p><p>“I didn’t expect to be discovered so quickly.”</p><p>Between the branches of an ancient tree, Lu Ming touched his nose.</p><p>he had just arrived when he saw the four sides confronting each other. He wanted to hide in the dark and observe the situation, but he didn’t expect to be noticed.</p><p>The purple-robed young man from the winged demon Academy had an amazing perception.</p><p>Since he had been discovered, there was nothing to hide. Lu Ming flew out directly.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming flew out, a surprised voice was heard from the ice Soul Clan. It was the ninth young master of the ice Soul Clan, Bing Qing.</p><p>“Brother bingqing!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He had already found bingqing when he was hiding.</p><p>“Brother Lu, I didn’t expect to meet you here.”</p><p>Bing Qing laughed.</p><p>“You’re Lu Ming, the Kong Xuan sect’s Lu Ming?”</p><p>Suddenly, a cold gaze looked at Lu Ming. Then, a gloomy voice was heard.</p><p>Lu Ming looked over and realized that the person who spoke was the purple-robed young man from the unique devil Academy.</p><p>“That’s right, I’m lu Ming.”</p><p>Lu Ming answered calmly.</p><p>good, very good. I was just about to look for you, but you delivered yourself to me. My Junior Brother Liu shangkai died by your hands, right? ”</p><p>The purple-robed young man said coldly, and his cold killing intent spread out.</p><p>so you’re Liu shangkai’s senior brother. Liu shangkai was looking for death. I’ve already let him off a few times, but he still sneaked an attack on me. He’s just looking for his own death.</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“How audacious!”</p><p>“Savage!”</p><p>A few angry roars sounded.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Some of the experts from the unique demon Academy stepped out. Their powerful auras burst out and pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>you killed my Junior Brother. Today, I will destroy your cultivation and feed you to the demons.</p><p>The purple-robed young man said coldly. He stepped forward and was about to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>“Hold on!”</p><p>Bing Qing called out and moved, landing in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>“Young master Bing, what are you doing? This matter has nothing to do with you? Move aside!”</p><p>The purple-robed youth shouted coldly.</p><p>“Who said it has nothing to do with me? Lu Ming is a good friend of the ice Soul Clan. If you want to touch him, you’ll have to go through the ice Soul Clan first!”</p><p>Bing Qing shouted.</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, some of the ice Soul clan’s experts appeared in front of Lu Ming. They exuded an icy cold aura, as if the scene had immediately entered winter.</p><p>The purple-robed young man’s face darkened.</p><p>When the Yimo Academy went to the ice Soul Clan to help them retrieve the ice jade cold heart, some of them were fine. They told him about the ice Soul Clan when they returned.</p><p>He knew that Lu Ming had helped the ice Soul Clan retrieve the ice jade cold heart and gained the ice Soul clan’s friendship. It seemed impossible for him to kill Lu Ming today.</p><p>“This kid is Lu Ming!”</p><p>Some of the people from the indestructible sword sect and the infinite Saint also had cold glints in their eyes. A strong killing intent spread toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Back then, in the battle at the ice Soul clan’s ancestral land, many of the geniuses from the indestructible sword sect and the boundless Holy Land had died at Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>However, they did not stand up for now. They hoped that the unique devil Academy and the ice Soul Clan would fight each other and suffer heavy losses so that they could benefit from it.</p><p>“Lu Ming, the ice Soul Clan can protect you for now, but they can’t protect you forever. Let’s wait and see!”</p><p>The purple-robed young man didn’t make a move. Instead, he left behind a cold sentence and turned around to rush into the forest.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The purple-robed young man gave the order. The people from the unique demon Academy followed the purple-robed young man and rushed toward the forest.</p><p>The people from the indestructible sword sect and the boundless Holy Land were a little disappointed. However, since the Yimo Academy did not make a move, they naturally would not make the first move. The strength of the ice Soul Clan was not to be taken lightly.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The people from the indestructible sword sect and the boundless Holy Land also flew towards the forest.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
