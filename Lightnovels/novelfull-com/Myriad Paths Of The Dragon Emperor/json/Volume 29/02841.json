I’ll give it a try!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he instantly activated the battle formula that tripled his combat power.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The thousand-meter-long spear was lashed out, causing the void to constantly produce explosive sounds.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>This time, Gu Ming’s body was sent flying thousands of miles away. He crashed into a mountain and shattered it.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He was afraid that Gu Ming would be whipped to death.</p><p>The battle symbol art could indeed be combined with the ancient God Body, and when combined, the power was even more shocking.</p><p>Fortunately, the descendants of ancient gods had transformed into ancient God bodies, so their life force was too strong. Gu Ming’s figure rushed out from the mountain peak. However, he was in an extremely miserable state. The scales on his body were broken, and blood was flowing out. He looked like he was on the verge of death.</p><p>“I’m done, I’m done, you pervert, I’m done.”</p><p>Gu Ming shouted from afar.</p><p>If their strength was similar, they could still compete. However, if the difference in strength was too great, he would be looking for a beating.</p><p>I wonder what realm I’ll be able to fight against if I unleash my full strength now …</p><p>Lu Ming began to measure his combat strength.</p><p>When he was at the fifth stage of true God Realm, before he had awakened the ancient God Body, he could kill a first stage celestial God and fight with a second stage true God.</p><p>And when his cultivation broke through to the sixth stage true God Realm, he would most likely be able to suppress a second stage true God and even kill a second stage celestial God.</p><p>Usually, those who could break through to the heavenly God Realm were those who could control King grade divine power. Of course, this was with the exception of those who could control Saint grade divine power.</p><p>In other words, Lu Ming estimated that if he didn’t use the ancient God Body and used all his skills, he could suppress or even kill a second-level celestial God.</p><p>However, once he used the ancient God Body, his power would increase dramatically and he could even kill a fourth-level celestial God.</p><p>Once he used the ancient God Body, his strength would increase by two levels, and it was two levels of the sky god Realm.</p><p>This was Lu Ming’s estimation of his abilities.</p><p>the ancient God Body was simply too powerful.</p><p>of course, this was because he had a green-armored ancient God Body. A low-level ancient God Body wouldn’t have improved so much.</p><p>amazing, amazing. If my strength increases by two more levels, I can even fight against Tian Hong, floating light, and the others.</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a confident expression.</p><p>Although the Tian Hong Saint son and the transient light Saint son were also at the fourth-level heavenly God Realm, they were the Kong Xuan sect’s Saint sons. Their combat strength could not be judged by their cultivation.</p><p>“Is this the green-armored ancient God Body? What a terrifying power.”</p><p>he’s so powerful. Gu Ming is no match for him. I wonder how powerful he will be if he breaks through to the heavenly God Realm.</p><p>The descendants of the ancient gods around were also amazed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, some figures appeared near Lu Ming and sized him up carefully.</p><p>“Lu Ming, they’re from another tribe.”</p><p>Gu Hongshan flew over and said.</p><p>so you’re from another tribe. It seems like the news of me awakening the green-armored ancient God Body has already spread.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He had thought that the news of him awakening the green-armored ancient God Body had been spread by the eighth tribe. In fact, he had no idea that his awakening had caused such a huge commotion that it had alarmed others.</p><p>“You’re very strong. How about we spar?”</p><p>Another young man stepped out. This person’s body was majestic, like a heavenly Pagoda.</p><p>it’s Gu Tian, the number one genius of the third tribe.</p><p>The moment this young man appeared, he was immediately recognized.</p><p>“Alright, then let’s have a spar.”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded directly.</p><p>he had just gained control of his ancient God Body, and he needed to fight to get used to it.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>With a roar, Gu Tian displayed his ancient God Body.</p><p>As the number one genius of the third tribe, Gu Tian’s ancient God Body was also an orange-armored ancient God Body and his cultivation had already reached the third level of the celestial God Realm.</p><p>Although it seemed like he had just reached this level, his strength was much stronger than Gu Ming’s.</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Gu Tian took action immediately. The two of them transformed into two giants and fought and collided with each other crazily.</p><p>Gu Tian’s cultivation base was much higher than Lu Ming’s. Lu Ming was at a disadvantage in the beginning.</p><p>However, as Lu Ming’s control of the ancient God Body became more and more proficient, he was able to use all his divine skills and secret skills with the ancient God Body. Lu Ming slowly turned the tables around and was in a deadlock with Gu Tian.</p><p>Both sides exchanged hundreds of moves and were drenched in sweat.</p><p>“Satisfying, satisfying …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were bright.</p><p>The descendant of an ancient God was indeed a warmonger. The battle with Gu Tian had allowed Lu Ming to unleash his combat strength to his heart’s content. His use and comprehension of various divine skills had reached a higher level.</p><p>“Amazing, let’s fight another day.”</p><p>After so many battles, Gu Tian was almost exhausted, so he could only stop the battle.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and returned to his residence to comprehend it in detail.</p><p>In the days that followed, the experts of the ancient God clan would either challenge Lu Ming or he would take the initiative to fight with the experts of the ancient God clan.</p><p>He constantly trained his combat strength and the use of various divine skills and secret skills.</p><p>Gradually, Lu Ming became more and more skilled in using the various divine skills and secret skills that he had control over. When he coordinated them, they were flawless.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming stayed in the tribe of ancient God descendants for five years.</p><p>In the past five years, he had visited the ten great tribes of the ancient God’s descendants.</p><p>The descendants of the ancient gods were very forthright and treated Lu Ming as one of their own. Lu Ming made many friends here, such as Gu Tian, Gu Ming, and the others. They would spar with each other from time to time.</p><p>In the past five years, Lu Ming had not met anyone from the Qin heaven star system. However, he knew from the other ancient God descendants that the people from the Qin heaven star system were still in this world. They had not left and were hiding in various places.</p><p>Lu Ming speculated that the door to the exit had not been opened.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming was not in a hurry.</p><p>Five years later, Lu Ming planned to head to the northern wilderness demonic Plains in this world.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re going to the northern wilderness demon field?”</p><p>When Lu Ming told Gu Hongshan about his plan, Gu Hongshan’s expression changed.</p><p>The demon’s land of the northern wilderness was at the extreme north of the ancient God World. It was said that there were countless demons there. Moreover, the demons there were different from the ones that Lu Ming and the rest had encountered when they first entered this world. There were many demons there that had intelligence and were more terrifying.</p><p>The demons of the northern wilderness demon field had always been the archenemy of the ancient God descendants. Both sides had been killing each other for countless years.</p><p>Therefore, Gu Hongshan’s expression changed when he heard Lu Ming’s words.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I know that you, the descendant of ascetics, need to go to all kinds of dangerous places to take risks and temper yourself. But the northern wilderness demon field is very dangerous. You still have to be careful.”</p><p>Gu Hongshan warned.</p><p>“Big brother Hong Shan, don’t worry. I know.”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Although he could train here, he could not engage in life-and-death battles. After all, the training for Lu Ming was much less. That was why he chose to go to the northern wilderness demon field.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
