Having high talent did not mean that he was powerful. They did not take him seriously at all.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were fixed on the chaotic heart of the vital Qi, waiting for the moment the vital Qi would collapse.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Finally, the vital Qi exploded with a loud bang, turning into endless vital Qi and dissipating into the air.</p><p>“The heart of desolation is mine!”</p><p>A seventh level celestial deity powerhouse gave a loud roar and pounced over towards the heart of desolation.</p><p>“Get lost, the heart of desolation is mine!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The rest of the people roared and pounced on the heart of desolation with blood-red eyes.</p><p>The lowest cultivation level of those who could make it this far was at least at the fifth level of the heavenly deity realm. All of them had astonishing battle prowess, and there was a total of eighty of them. They pounced toward the heart of chaos, and a chaotic battle began.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Everyone was engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>All 80 of them wanted the heart of desolation, but the moment anyone got close to it, they would be attacked by the others.</p><p>As soon as the battle began, some people had already fallen and were killed here.</p><p>A few miserable cries sounded out. A few fifth level celestial deity existences were killed.</p><p>However, no one retreated. They continued to attack the heart of desolation.</p><p>The heart of desolation was something that even the divine kings would be tempted to fight for. It was extremely valuable. One could imagine how ordinary cultivators would be able to resist such temptation.</p><p>Everyone had neglected Lu Ming. No one thought that Lu Ming was a threat.</p><p>Lu Ming stood at the side with a smile and retracted his divine power. He did not make a move and just watched the Tigers fight while he reaped the benefits.</p><p>The battle was getting more and more intense. Some of the weaker ones were killed and killed. Finally, some people were scared and retreated out of the battlefield.</p><p>Only a few sixth and seventh level celestial deities were still fighting and competing.</p><p>However, no one was able to get close to the heart of desolation.</p><p>This battle went on for half a day, but no one had the desire to achieve Dao.</p><p>In the end, the killing stopped. The strongest group of experts stopped around the heart of desolation, facing each other and gasping for breath. It was obvious that they had used up a lot of energy.</p><p>After this battle, there were only about forty people left out of the original eighty. Nearly half of them had fallen here.</p><p>The remaining people stood in a stalemate and stared at each other. For a moment, no one dared to make the first move.</p><p>They all knew that whoever made the first move would be surrounded and attacked by the others.</p><p>No one could guarantee that they would be able to escape unscathed when they were surrounded by others.</p><p>“It’s almost time!”</p><p>Lu Ming mumbled and stepped forward. Step by step, he walked towards the heart of desolation.</p><p>“What is this kid trying to do?”</p><p>Many people’s eyes were focused on Lu Ming. Some of them had cold killing intent in their eyes.</p><p>“Could it be that this brat wants to seize the heart of desolation?”</p><p>“You’re really looking for death!”</p><p>Some people’s eyes glowed with a cold light.</p><p>“Brat, stop!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not stop and continued to move forward. He could not be bothered with that person.</p><p>“Brat, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>The man roared and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>This person had the cultivation of a sixth level celestial deity, but in the great battle just now, this person was already injured. Furthermore, his divine power was severely exhausted, and his combat strength was weakened a lot. He was even inferior to a fifth level celestial deity under normal circumstances.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and attacked with all his might, whipping his spear at the man.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two of them exchanged a blow, resulting in a loud explosion. Lu Ming’s figure only swayed a little, while his opponent’s body trembled violently and he retreated continuously.</p><p>“This kid …”</p><p>Many people’s eyes focused and revealed looks of surprise.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength had exceeded their expectations.</p><p>Although that person’s combat strength was much weaker, he was still not to be underestimated. On the other hand, Lu Ming’s cultivation was only at true God-level, but he could actually force such an expert to retreat.</p><p>“No wonder you could reach this place!”</p><p>Many people had the same thought.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to rush towards the heart of desolation after forcing the person back.</p><p>kid, you have some strength, but it’s not enough!</p><p>die! an old woman shouted coldly. She stretched out her shriveled palm and clawed at Lu Ming. One of the shriveled claws grew rapidly and emitted a disgusting smell as it clawed at Lu Ming.</p><p>This old woman had a seventh level celestial deity cultivation. Previously, she stimulated Six Essence Qi pillars. Her strength was extremely shocking.</p><p>Even though she had used up a lot of her divine power, her power was still terrifying.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not afraid at all.</p><p>ancient God Body!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He used the ancient God tactic and his body grew rapidly.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming did not hold back. He used his full strength.</p><p>He turned into a 200-meter-tall green-armored ancient God and let out an ancient God’s roar.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>With a loud roar, Lu Ming thrust his spear forward.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The old woman’s palm was pierced by Lu Ming. She let out a sharp scream and retracted her claw. Her face was pale and her palm was bleeding.</p><p>The others were shocked. The old woman’s abilities were extremely terrifying. Although she had expended some energy, it was still very terrifying. She was actually injured by Lu Ming’s spear.</p><p>A true God Realm person had such terrifying battle strength?</p><p>After repelling the old woman, Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he rushed toward the heart of desolation.</p><p>“He wants to take the heart of desolation. Let’s attack together and kill this person!”</p><p>The old woman shouted. A powerful aura erupted from her body and she charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, the other powerhouses also charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>There were more than ten seventh-level heavenly deities and many sixth-level heavenly deities.</p><p>With so many people attacking together, the power was astonishing.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>go! Lu Ming shouted coldly. A layer of Scarlet-golden armor appeared on his huge body. Then, nine ice chains flew out and wrapped around his body.</p><p>Lu Ming first set up layers of defense and then charged toward the old woman.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming thrust his spear forward. A ray of spear light pierced towards the old woman as if it was a destructive force.</p><p>If Lu Ming were to go all out now, he could suppress the Supreme Holy Son.</p><p>Although the Supreme Holy son’s cultivation base was only at the sixth level of the celestial deity realm, his combat strength was strong enough to kill a seventh level celestial deity. He was probably even stronger than the old woman.</p><p>Since Lu Ming could suppress the Supreme Holy Son, it was naturally not a problem for him to deal with the old woman. Moreover, the other party’s divine power had been severely depleted.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The spear radiance broke the old woman’s attack. The old woman screamed and spat out a mouthful of blood as she retreated rapidly.</p><p>At this moment, the other people’s attacks also landed on Lu Ming.</p><p>The nine ice chains and the Scarlet Gold armor shook a few times before they exploded and landed on the green scales on Lu Ming’s body. However, the green scales had amazing defense and successfully blocked the attacks from the others.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
