Then, a huge creature appeared above Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang’s heads. Several golden lights slashed at Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang with a terrifying whistling sound.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>At the critical moment, the two of them burst out with their own attacks to resist. However, the attacks that were aimed at them were too powerful. Their bodies shook violently and they were blasted to the ground. They landed heavily on the ground and created two large pits.</p><p>The two of them felt their bodies go numb, and their qi and blood churned. They almost vomited blood.</p><p>“The third gold planet Devourer!”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang’s voice trembled. Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>It was another gold planet Devourer that had attacked them.</p><p>There were three gold planet devourers here.</p><p>The gold planet Devourer that had appeared behind them was suspended in the air, blocking their retreat.</p><p>The second gold planet Devourer slowly strolled toward the two.</p><p>Squeak …</p><p>Just as Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang were thinking of a way to escape, sharp sounds were heard from a few other directions.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang saw golden figures crawling out of the caves one after another.</p><p>Gold planet devourers. They were all gold planet devourers.</p><p>Lu Ming glanced around and saw ten of them.</p><p>In addition to the one that they had injured earlier, there were 11 of them.</p><p>Their hearts continued to sink.</p><p>There were 11 gold planet devourers here.</p><p>The two of them couldn’t even defeat one gold planet Devourer, let alone 11 of them.</p><p>“It’s over, it’s over. Lu Ming, I’ve implicated you this time.”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang’s face was as white as snow.</p><p>Facing 11 gold-tier planet devourers, no matter how strong they were, they would die without a doubt.</p><p>“We might have a chance to fight.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a cold light.</p><p>Go all out, there was no other way, he could only go all out.</p><p>it seems like I’ll have to burn the ancient God heart today!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. When he was dealing with the two silver Planet devourers, he had already planned to burn the ancient God heart. However, after Ouyang Qingxiang had a breakthrough, he naturally did not need to burn it.</p><p>At first, he thought that there was no need to burn the heart of the ancient God. He never expected that there were actually 11 gold-grade planet devourers here. This was simply a gold-grade planet Devourer’s lair.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you … You … There’s a way?”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang was bewildered. She really couldn’t think of any way to deal with eleven gold-grade planet devourers at the same time.</p><p>“Stand behind me!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang trusted Lu Ming very much. When she heard that, her figure flashed and she appeared behind Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, they were surrounded by 11 gold-tier planet devourers.</p><p>Squeak …</p><p>The 11 gold-grade planet devourers shrieked, emitting cold killing intent.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>All of a sudden, other than the injured planet Devourer, the other ten pounced on Lu Ming at the same time.</p><p>come, ancient God’s heart, burn …</p><p>Lu Ming roared, and the ancient God was instantly set ablaze.</p><p>As the ancient God’s heart burned, waves of majestic energy rushed out and gushed into every part of Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming’s ancient God Body grew stronger.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming let out a violent roar, as if an ancient God had come back to life.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming shook his long spear and stabbed more than ten times in an instant.</p><p>More than a dozen spearlights burst out with shocking power and stabbed at the ten gold-grade planet devourers.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The bodies of the ten gold-grade planet devourers were sent flying by Lu Ming like cannonballs. They crashed into the surrounding walls, causing the entire underground space to shake violently.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang was dumbfounded.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength had increased by a large margin in an instant. He had sent ten gold-grade planet devourers flying by himself. His combat strength was already far above that of the Supreme Holy Son.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he was only at true God-level.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang’s heart was in turmoil. The ten gold-grade planet devourers let out sharp cries and rushed out of the rubble, charging at Lu Ming.</p><p>Furthermore, the gold-grade planet Devourer that was injured earlier also charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>As for Ouyang Xiangxiang, she was completely ignored by the gold-grade planet devourers. In their hearts, Lu Ming was the biggest threat. As long as they got rid of Lu Ming, they could kill Ouyang Xiangxiang at any time.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s body seemed to be filled with a brutal aura. There was only one word in his heart, and that was ‘fight’!</p><p>Battle! Battle! Battle!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his long spear and stabbed it fiercely at the abdomen of a gold-grade planet Devourer, ignoring the other planet devourers.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear pierced through a gold-grade planet Devourer and pinned it to the ground.</p><p>At the same time, the attacks of the other gold-grade planet devourers had already landed on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang exclaimed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>The sharp claws of the other golden devourers slashed at Lu Ming’s body. However, the sharp claws from before did not manage to cut through Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>The green scales on the surface of Lu Ming’s body became extremely hard. The gold-grade planet Devourer’s sharp claws slashed on the scales on Lu Ming’s body, producing clanking sounds and sparks, leaving shallow white marks on them.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and stabbed another gold-grade planet Devourer with his spear. He grabbed another gold-grade planet Devourer with his other hand and crushed it.</p><p>Lu Ming was too powerful when he was burning the ancient God’s heart. He completely crushed the eleven gold-level planet devourers.</p><p>Next, Lu Ming unleashed his lightning-like methods and started a terrifying massacre.</p><p>The terrifying gold-grade planet devourers were killed by Lu Ming one after another.</p><p>Not long after, the 11 gold-grade planet devourers were all killed, lying on the ground.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang was dumbfounded and completely stunned.</p><p>Hu hu hu …</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was panting heavily. His body was shrinking rapidly, turning into the size of an ordinary person. He felt a sense of weakness as if he was about to faint.</p><p>the ancient God’s heart is almost extinguished.</p><p>Lu Ming sensed the ancient God’s heart and realized that it was dead silent. It was not as vigorous as before. He was afraid that he could not even use the ancient God Body.</p><p>fortunately, all 11 golden devourers have been killed!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly.</p><p>As long as he could keep his life, the temporary losses were nothing.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you alright?”</p><p>Only then did Ouyang Qingxiang come to her senses and ran toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“I’m fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Hahaha, good, very good. You actually killed more than ten of my good-for-nothing subordinates. Very good!”</p><p>At this moment, a sharp laugh rang out.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
