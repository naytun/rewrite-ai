Their faces were calm, but deep in their eyes, there was still a trace of unwillingness.</p><p>If it was possible, how could they give up so easily?</p><p>He really had no choice.</p><p>The others came to a realization.</p><p>They finally understood why the three of them had given up. The main reason was that the Supreme Holy Son was too strong. If they didn’t join forces, they wouldn’t be able to compete with the Supreme Holy Son. That was why they had joined forces.</p><p>“Qian Kun, do you have the confidence to win if they join forces?”</p><p>Supreme Being Dong secretly transmitted a message to the Supreme Holy Son. The Supreme Holy son’s name was Supreme universe.</p><p>“Don’t worry, forefather. Even if they join forces, they won’t be my match.”</p><p>The Supreme Saint son replied confidently. At the same time, he looked at the sacred son of reflection and the others in disdain.”Hmph, do you think you can fight me just because you’re helping floating light? What a fool’s dream. Floating light, I think you should just give up on this idea!”</p><p>“How do you know you’re going to win if you haven’t?”</p><p>The sacred son of reflection responded strongly.</p><p>He had already broken through to the fifth-tier celestial deity realm and was much more confident. At the same time, he had also obtained the help of the other three Holy Sons and holy virgins. He might not be unable to contend against the Supreme Holy Son.</p><p>“Hehe, you’re very confident. When the time comes, you’ll know what despair is.”</p><p>The Supreme Saint mocked coldly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what about you?”</p><p>At this moment, the Supreme-being’s gaze shifted to Lu Ming.</p><p>“I also give up the contest.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>His words shocked everyone present.</p><p>“Lu Ming has given up too.”</p><p>what a pity. Holy Son Lu Ming’s talent is definitely the strongest. He’s definitely stronger than the Supreme Holy Son. In a few hundred or thousand years, it won’t be a problem for him to surpass the Supreme Holy Son.</p><p>it’s a pity that this contest came too suddenly. Lu Ming probably withdrew because he’s no match for the Supreme Holy Son.</p><p>“I guess so!”</p><p>Many people were discussing this.</p><p>The Grandmaster’s words made him very uncomfortable. He coldly snorted, and many people immediately shut up.</p><p>“Alright, since that’s the case, then the three of you will compete. Each of you can bring three assistants. Remember, the people you bring must also be from the younger generation.”</p><p>Supreme martial artist Dong asked.</p><p>“They …”</p><p>The Supreme Holy Son pointed at the three of them, and three young men walked out from behind him.</p><p>The three of them were undoubtedly very powerful. One of them, in particular, was qualified to become a saint, but in the end, he joined the Supreme Saint.</p><p>The sacred son of floating light and the others sized him up. He was definitely a threat, not any weaker than them.</p><p>“They are the people I’m going to bring!”</p><p>The floating light Saint son looked at the Zhi Xia Saint son, the Yan Kong Saint son, and the Xue Tan Saint daughter.</p><p>Saint son Zhi Xia, Saint son Yan Kong, and Saint daughter Xue Tan stepped out and stood behind the floating light Saint son.</p><p>“As expected …”</p><p>Many people’s hearts moved. This was within their expectations. The sacred son of floating light was indeed going to bring along the three of them. The four great sacred sons and saintesses joining forces would definitely be an extremely powerful force.</p><p>“I’m going to bring them!”</p><p>Then, Ouyang Qingxiang also spoke.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two young men and women stepped forward and stood behind Ouyang Qingxiang.</p><p>“Holy Son Lu Ming is indeed helping Holy maiden Qingxiang.”</p><p>that’s right. I heard that before Holy Son Lu Ming became a Holy Son, he was already very close to Holy maiden Qingxiang. It’s normal for him to give up on the competition and help Holy maiden Qingxiang.</p><p>“Which of the three forces do you guys think is stronger and which is weaker?”</p><p>The people at the scene started to discuss.</p><p>If nothing unexpected happened, the future zongzi of the Kong Xuan sect would be the Supreme Saint son, the transient light Saint son, and the Holy maiden Qingxiang.</p><p>on the surface, the sacred son’s side is the strongest. They’ve gathered four Holy Sons and holy virgins. However, the Supreme Holy son’s strength is unfathomable. With the help of another Holy Son, I’m afraid that their overall strength is even above the sacred son’s.</p><p>I think so too. The Supreme Holy Son is too strong. I’m afraid he can fight against several Holy maidens and Holy Sons alone. The weakest one must be Holy maiden Qingxiang.</p><p>there’s no doubt about it. Although she has the help of the Lu Ming Saint, the Lu Ming Saint also gave it his all in the battle with the Tianhong Saint son. He’s only slightly stronger than the Tianhong Saint son. If he and the Qingxiang saintess join forces, they’re definitely no match for the other two.</p><p>it seems like the outcome of this battle will be decided between the sacred son of reflection and the Supreme sacred son.</p><p>In terms of overall abilities, many people did not think highly of Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang.</p><p>Lu Ming heard the surrounding discussions. However, he only smiled and did not care.</p><p>To be honest, he wasn’t confident and could only try his best.</p><p>alright, since the participants have been decided, let’s set off. Before we set off, let me remind you that points are very important. The final result will be to combine the points from the two rounds. The one with the highest points will be the winner of this round.</p><p>“Men, set up the formation!”</p><p>As soon as Supreme beast move finished speaking, a few elders stepped forward and waved their hands. Array discs flew out and floated in the air. Soon, a teleportation array appeared in the sky.</p><p>this teleportation array can directly teleport you to that dying planet. You can go now.</p><p>The Grandmaster waved his sleeves.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The Supreme Saint led his men and stepped into the teleportation array. Then, they disappeared.</p><p>Then, the sacred son of reflection led his people and stepped into the teleportation formation. Ouyang Qingxiang and Lu Ming were the last to step into the teleportation formation and leave the place.</p><p>The rest of them waited where they were.</p><p>The first round of the competition would last for three months. After three months, Lu Ming and the rest would return on time.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
