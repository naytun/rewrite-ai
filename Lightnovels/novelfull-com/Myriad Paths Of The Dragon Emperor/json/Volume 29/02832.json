He could sense the aura of an ancient God from the creatures that were more than ten meters tall and covered in red scales.</p><p>Lu Ming had the ancient God’s heart and was very sensitive to the aura of ancient gods. He would not be wrong.</p><p>“What’s going on? Could it be that this kind of living being was also a descendant of an ancient God? It’s said that the ancient gods have huge bodies that can support the heavens and the earth. This kind of creature is also so tall, so maybe they really are the descendants of the ancient gods. Their bloodline is even thicker than the descendants of the ancient gods on the ancient God Star.”</p><p>Many thoughts flashed through Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>The battle ahead was very intense. The few tall creatures and the demons had the upper hand, forcing the Scarlet Flame tribe to retreat.</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ming did not plan to attack. The divine King of the Scarlet Flame tribe wanted to kill him. He could not wait for the Scarlet Flame tribe to be killed.</p><p>Lu Ming retreated quietly and left the place.</p><p>A few hours later, Lu Ming arrived at a Valley. He was planning to enter the valley and find a place to rest.</p><p>But suddenly, a few figures flashed in the valley.</p><p>“Lu Ming …”</p><p>As soon as these figures saw Lu Ming, they burst out with cold killing intent.</p><p>“The people from the unique devil Academy are really unlucky …”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and turned to leave.</p><p>“You want to leave? die!”</p><p>you killed the dark battle Saint, and you still want to leave? kill!</p><p>A few experts from the unique demon Academy roared and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The few of them were very fast as they approached Lu Ming.</p><p>“What a strong cultivation!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>These few people were all celestial deity realm experts. Two of them had at least a fourth-level celestial deity cultivation. Lu Ming could not fight against such a cultivation.</p><p>Lu Ming cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique and circulated his divine power. A huge kun Peng formed outside his body. It flapped its wings and flew forward at high speed.</p><p>However, the few experts from the unique devil Academy were astonishingly fast. Even if Lu Ming used the nine heavenly kun Peng technique, he was still slower than them.</p><p>The distance between the two sides was closing.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! one of the black-robed elders shouted coldly as he slashed his saber at Lu Ming. The saber radiance cut across thousands of miles and headed straight for Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. The nine-layered Crimson Gold armor appeared. At the same time, he cast the divine Dragon materialization art. A nine-clawed Divine Dragon pounced at his opponent.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The divine Dragon phenomenon was the first to be cut in half by the saber beam. The saber beam did not stop and continued to slash at Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The nine ice chains shattered continuously and the saber Light slashed at Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>At the critical moment, QiuQiu wriggled and turned into an armor that covered Lu Ming’s body. It formed a double protection with the nine-layered Crimson Gold armor. Even so, Lu Ming was still sent flying by the saber and crashed into a few huge ancient trees.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming spat out a mouthful of blood, but he did not dare to stay any longer. His body swayed and he flew forward again.</p><p>The other party’s strength had exceeded his imagination. It was at least a fifth level celestial deity existence, much stronger than him. Even if it was QiuQiu, if it wasn’t for QiuQiu’s protection earlier, that blade would have probably killed him.</p><p>“Kid, you actually have a metallic lifeform protecting you, but how many times can a metallic lifeform block my saber strikes?”</p><p>The black-robed elder shouted coldly. He turned into a ray of Saber Light and continued to pursue Lu Ming.</p><p>There was another person who was traveling at the same speed as the black-robed old man. He was obviously an expert of the same level.</p><p>Lu Ming was in danger. However, at this moment, a few roars were heard.</p><p>A demonic aura filled the air. A few huge demons swooped down from the sky, their sharp eyes staring at Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>The auras from the few people from the unique devil Academy were too strong. A few powerful demons had their eyes on the few experts from the unique devil Academy and pounced on them. They had completely ignored Lu Ming.</p><p>“The heavens are helping me!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He increased his speed and rushed forward. He heard the angry roars of the few people from the unique devil Academy behind him.</p><p>The few people from the unique demon Academy were extremely aggrieved. They were about to capture Lu Ming, but a few demons appeared halfway and blocked them. They could only watch as Lu Ming left.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop. He flew all the way and carefully avoided some demons along the way. He had flown about a hundred thousand miles.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>All of a sudden, a strong wind whistled. A huge figure descended from the sky and landed in front of Lu Ming. It stomped on the ground, causing a violent boom and blasting a huge pit in the ground.</p><p>It was a huge creature, more than 30 meters tall. Its body was covered with red scales, and its muscles were like a dragon. It looked very powerful.</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils constricted. He retreated quickly and was on full alert.</p><p>However, this living being did not attack Lu Ming. Instead, it sized Lu Ming up curiously and said in a deep voice, ” kid, which tribe are you from? you’re only at stage five true God Realm, but you’re running around. Do you know that outsiders have arrived and are wantonly destroying our living environment? it’s very dangerous now.</p><p>The huge creature spoke in the same language as Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned and somewhat confused.</p><p>What was the meaning of this living being? From his tone, he seemed to treat Lu Ming as one of his kind.</p><p>Could it be because of the ancient God’s heart?</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He had condensed the ancient God’s heart, and his body was emitting a strong ancient God aura. This living being was also emitting a strong ancient God aura. It was possible that he was of the same race.</p><p>However, their body sizes were too different.</p><p>However, at this moment, something happened that made Lu Ming’s eyes widen.</p><p>The huge creature’s body shrank rapidly, and the scales on its body disappeared. Soon, an ordinary middle-aged man about two meters tall appeared before Lu Ming.</p><p>It seemed like he was no different from an ordinary human.</p><p>“Could this be his true body? Did he just use some kind of secret technique or technique to have such a huge body?“</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but guess.</p><p>“Little guy, what are you doing? I’m asking you a question.”</p><p>The middle-aged man asked.</p><p>“I … He doesn’t come from any tribe.”</p><p>Lu Ming answered.</p><p>He was completely clueless about the situation here, so he could only make things up.</p><p>“Not from any tribe? Could it be that you’re a descendant of an ascetic?”</p><p>The middle-aged man’s eyes widened as he asked in surprise.</p><p>“Yes, I am the descendant of the ascetics.”</p><p>Lu Ming quickly nodded. At the same time, he stared at the other party cautiously. Once the situation was not right, he would immediately escape.</p><p>“You really are the descendant of the ascetics. I’ve only heard of the ascetics before, but I’ve never seen one. No wonder you dare to run around by yourself. However, times are different now. Now that outsiders have arrived, this area will become very dangerous. I think you should follow me for the time being so that we can take care of each other.”</p><p>The middle-aged man smiled and his eyes were very gentle. It seemed that he really regarded Lu Ming as one of his own.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
