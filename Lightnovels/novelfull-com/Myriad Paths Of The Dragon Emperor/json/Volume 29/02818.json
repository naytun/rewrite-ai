Now, he had a rough idea of these people’s cultivation. He was completely at ease and did not feel any pressure at all.</p><p>These eight people were all at the heavenly God Realm.</p><p>Four first-level heavenly deities, three second-level heavenly deities, and one third-level heavenly deity.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s abilities, it would be difficult for him to fight against a second-level celestial deity. At most, he could only protect himself. However, Lu Ming had QiuQiu.</p><p>When QiuQiu was at the true God-level, it could definitely fight a weaker heavenly God with its full power. One had to know that there was a huge gap between true gods and heavenly gods.</p><p>Now that QiuQiu had broken through to heavenly God, its combat strength had skyrocketed by who knew how much. Crossing two levels and killing a third level heavenly God was absolutely no problem.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming did not think much of these people.</p><p>you’re really arrogant. Then let me see if you have the right to be arrogant.</p><p>A middle-aged burly man stepped forward. His powerful aura pressed down on Lu Ming like a mountain, but Lu Ming did not move an inch.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The burly man roared. A battle axe appeared in his hand and he swung it at Lu Ming.</p><p>This burly man had a first-tier celestial God cultivation. Although he looked down on Lu Ming verbally, he did not look down on him at all when he attacked. He used his full strength the moment he attacked.</p><p>After all, back then, Lu Ming and QiuQiu had joined forces to defeat Liu Feiyun. Although this burly man was slightly stronger than Liu Feiyun, he was not that much stronger.</p><p>The others did not make a move. Instead, they guarded the surroundings, afraid that Lu Ming would take the opportunity to escape.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A long spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hands. The long spear vibrated and he thrust it forward.</p><p>The three apocalyptic strikes, sky-breaking!</p><p>Moreover, the moment he attacked, Lu Ming triggered the tripled combat power of the battle formula.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The spear and the battle-axe collided with a loud boom. The ground under their feet cracked and spread in all directions.</p><p>Then, a figure retreated rapidly.</p><p>It was the middle-aged man.</p><p>“This … How is that possible?”</p><p>On the side, the other seven people’s hearts were beating wildly. They simply couldn’t believe their eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming actually had the upper hand in the head-on collision with the middle-aged man.</p><p>They could see very clearly that this time, Lu Ming did not rely on any external help. He was completely relying on his own abilities.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was only a true God. How could he be so powerful?</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>The middle-aged man couldn’t believe it himself and was a little dumbfounded.</p><p>“Three apocalyptic strikes, moon-cutting!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and pounced on the middle-aged man like a gust of wind. He executed the second move of the three apocalyptic strikes, moon-cutting.</p><p>“Not good, be careful!”</p><p>An old man beside him shouted to warn him, but it was too late.</p><p>Whoosh … Whoosh …</p><p>The moment Lu Ming charged out, nine ice chains flew out of his body like nine bolts of lightning. They arrived first and wrapped around the middle-aged man.</p><p>The middle-aged man was a little dumbfounded after being forced back by Lu Ming with one move.</p><p>In a battle between experts, a single mistake could be fatal.</p><p>At this moment, he wanted to Dodge, but it was too late. His body was bound by nine ice chains.</p><p>“Open it!”</p><p>The middle-aged man roared and tried to use his divine power to jump away from the ice chains.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s cultivation level had improved greatly and the power of the ice shackles had also increased by a large margin. He could not jump away at all for the time being.</p><p>Lu Ming had already arrived.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>The middle-aged man let out a desperate roar. Then, a crescent-shaped spear light flashed and the middle-aged man was directly cut in half, dying on the spot.</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming had killed a first-level celestial deity.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current strength was enough to kill the Toad King, but the middle-aged man’s strength was not as strong as the Toad King’s. Moreover, he had underestimated Lu Ming’s strength. After being pushed back by Lu Ming, he was momentarily dazed, which was why he was killed by Lu Ming’s lightning-fast attack.</p><p>All of this happened too quickly. It was so fast that the other seven didn’t even have time to save him.</p><p>“This kid …”</p><p>The other seven people looked at Lu Ming with deep shock in their eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming’s speed of improvement was too fast. Now, he could actually kill a divine realm expert. If this continued, it was a sure thing that he would catch up or even surpass the other Holy Sons.</p><p>“Everyone, we can’t let this man live. Let’s attack together. No matter what, we must kill him.”</p><p>At the scene, the only third level heavenly deity old man spoke with a grave expression.</p><p>Although he was 100% confident that he could kill Lu Ming as long as he made a move, he still invited the others to join him as he was afraid that Lu Ming would run away again.</p><p>“Let’s attack together!”</p><p>the others nodded, and divine power of all colors exploded.</p><p>“If you want to kill me together, I’ll kill you first.”</p><p>Killing intent flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. He took heavy steps and his figure actually rushed towards the third-level celestial deity elder, punching him.</p><p>“Courting death …”</p><p>The old man did not expect Lu Ming to attack him.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was powerful, he was still a far cry from him. He would be courting death if he was the first one to rush at him.</p><p>Therefore, he was distracted for a moment and used a defensive divine skill as a defense. Then, a sword light burst out from his palm and slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Zzzzzzz …</p><p>Lu Ming’s wrist was flashing with lightning.</p><p>The reason why Lu Ming was the first to attack the third level celestial deity was naturally not because he wanted to rely on his own abilities but on QiuQiu.</p><p>Wisps of lightning appeared on the bangle that QiuQiu had transformed into. As Lu Ming threw a punch, a bolt of lightning as thick as an arm shot toward the elder.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The old man’s sword light was instantly destroyed. The lightning didn’t stop and continued to strike the other party.</p><p>His opponent’s defensive divine skill was like a piece of paper. It couldn’t even withstand a single blow. The lightning struck his body, and the old man screamed. His body flew out and fell tens of thousands of meters away. His whole body twitched and was charred black. He was exhaling more than he was inhaling.</p><p>The old man was on the verge of death in one move, and the remaining six people were almost scared to death.</p><p>“QiuQiu, kill!“</p><p>Lu Ming roared and waved his hand. QiuQiu flew out directly towards a second-level celestial deity.</p><p>As it flew out, QiuQiu extended two tentacles and transformed them into two sabers, slashing out continuously.</p><p>The man was shocked and quickly blocked it.</p><p>However, when a second level heavenly deity faced QiuQiu, he could only be abused. The saber Light slashed past, and that person was directly killed.</p><p>Following that, QiuQiu charged towards another second level celestial deity.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he charged towards a first-tier celestial deity. The nine ice chains quickly wrapped around the other party.</p><p>“Open it!”</p><p>The man’s saber kept slashing out, and in an instant, he had slashed out hundreds of times, trying to break the ice chains. The ice chains were agitated, and sparks flew in all directions. However, the shocking coldness of the ice chains also flowed through the saber and rushed to his whole body, making him feel cold as if he was going to be frozen.</p><p>“Moon slaying!”</p><p>Lu Ming arrived and cast the moon Slayer. This move was more powerful than the one Lu Ming had just cast.</p><p>This was because Lu Ming had already triggered the fourfold increase in combat power.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
