At the same time, the Godking of the indestructible sword sect also led his men to attack the ice Soul Clan.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>“Together!”</p><p>Everyone in the Kong Xuan sect was also very curious. They wanted to know the result of this battle, so they followed the Yimo Academy and the immortal sword sect to the ice Soul Clan.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I hope you’re not in the ice Soul Clan!”</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang, Yue Linglong, and the others muttered and followed the crowd to the ice Soul Clan.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I hope you’re in the ice Soul Clan.”</p><p>Cold glints flashed in the eyes of the Tian Hong Saint son and the transient light Saint son. They both hoped that Lu Ming would be killed by the people from the Yimo Academy and the immortal sword sect in the ice Soul Clan.</p><p>The group of people flew toward the ice Soul Clan.</p><p>When they approached the ice Soul clan’s base, the base was alarmed and the sound of war drums could be heard.</p><p>The dense crowd in the ice Soul clan’s base flew toward the city wall.</p><p>“It’s the inextinguishable sword sect!”</p><p>there’s also the Yimo Academy and the people from the Kong Xuan sect. What are these forces doing in our ice Soul clan’s base? ”</p><p>“Looks like they’re here with ill intentions!”</p><p>Many members of the ice Soul Clan were whispering to each other.</p><p>oh no, the people from the indestructible sword sect and the unique devil Academy are really here. Hurry up and inform brother Lu!</p><p>Bing Qing’s expression changed when she saw the people from the indestructible sword sect and the unique demon Academy. She flew toward a stone house in the ice Soul clan’s base.</p><p>At the Yimo Academy, the people from the immortal sword sect stopped outside the base of the ice Soul Clan.</p><p>why have you two forces brought so many people to my ice Soul Clan? ”</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s Godking stepped out and came to the sky. His voice was cold.</p><p>“Brother Bing, we’re here to ask your ice Soul Clan for a person. Is a kid named Lu Ming from the Kong Xuan sect in your ice Soul Clan?”</p><p>Said the Godking of the Yimo Academy. However, he was much more polite when speaking to the Godking of the ice Soul Clan.</p><p>“No comment, you can go!”</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s Godking said coldly and domineeringly.</p><p>brother Bing, this man used despicable means to kill the Saint children of our two sects and the other experts. We must take him down.</p><p>“Besides, our people saw that Lu Ming is very close to the ice Soul Clan. If he’s really in the ice Soul Clan, you’d better hand him over, brother Bing, so that we don’t have to be enemies.”</p><p>The Godking from the inextinguishable sword sect said.</p><p>“Hurt our relationship? Hehe, so what if we’re on bad terms?”</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s Godking sneered.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>The expression of the God King from the indestructible sword sect was extremely ugly. He was already being very polite but the other party didn’t give him any face at all.</p><p>Lu Ming must be in the ice Soul Clan. The third young master of the ice Soul Clan has returned. They’ve been together for a long time.</p><p>One of the disciples from the Yimo Academy shouted and pointed at the third young master of the ice Soul Clan.</p><p>“Brother Bing, it seems that Lu Ming is really in your ice Soul Clan. I think you should hand him over.”</p><p>The Godking of the unique devil Academy said.</p><p>“I’ve said it, I’m telling you, why aren’t you guys leaving? Do you want to start a war with the ice Soul Clan?”</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s Godking remained strong.</p><p>The godkings of the unique devil Academy and the indestructible sword sect had extremely ugly expressions. They looked at each other and a hint of determination flashed through their eyes.</p><p>Today, they had come with such a large force. If they were to retreat just because of a few rude words from the ice Soul clan’s Godking, how would they be able to maintain their dignity?</p><p>Moreover, the two forces combined were not afraid of the ice Soul Clan.</p><p>brother Bing, you have to understand a fact. This is the ancient God World, not the Qin heaven star region. Each of our forces only has one Godking.</p><p>The Godking from the indestructible sword sect said coldly.</p><p>“Are you threatening me?”</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s Godking’s eyes narrowed, and a terrifying chill emanated from him.</p><p>“I’m not threatening you, I’m telling the truth!”</p><p>The God King of the indestructible sword sect spoke. He became more powerful as a sword light flickered on his body. A terrifying sword intent seemed to be about to explode at any moment.</p><p>“That’s right, if brother Bing really wants to be our enemy, then we can only spar with brother Bing.”</p><p>The Godking of the Yimo Academy also spoke coldly. His powerful aura was faintly discernible.</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s Godking’s expression turned ugly. He did not have any chance of winning against two godkings.</p><p>This time, the various major factions could only send one Godking. Without a doubt, they were all godkings with powerful combat strength, especially the godkings from the indestructible sword sect and the unique devil Academy. None of them were weaker than him.</p><p>If they really wanted to make a move, he couldn’t stop them at all.</p><p>As for those below the God King realm, the difference between them was too great, and there was no possibility of comparison.</p><p>“Brother Bing, you’d better hand Lu Ming over to avoid hurting our relationship!”</p><p>The Godking of the indestructible sword sect’s sword light grew stronger and stronger. The terrifying sword intent locked onto the ice Soul race’s Godking.</p><p>“Lu Ming, get your ass out here.”</p><p>At this moment, the Godking of the unique demon Academy roared, shaking the entire ice Soul clan’s base.</p><p>Lu Ming had been cultivating in a stone house of the ice Soul Clan and studying the stone fruit.</p><p>The fruit was the size of a washbasin. It was round and covered with strange patterns. However, Lu Ming could not figure out the function of the fruit after studying it for a long time.</p><p>They didn’t know anything about the bone demon or the “quantity” formula.</p><p>Lu Ming could only keep it and study it slowly in the future.</p><p>At this moment, Bing Qing rushed in.</p><p>brother Lu, this is bad. The people from the indestructible sword sect and the unique devil Academy have indeed come. Even the godkings have personally come.</p><p>Bingqing said.</p><p>“Even the Godking has come.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>He had not expected the other party to mobilize such a large force. Even the godkings stationed at the base had been mobilized.</p><p>but don’t worry. Even if their godly King comes, my ice Soul clan’s godly King won’t hand you over.</p><p>Bing Qing said firmly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, get your ass out here.”</p><p>At this moment, an explosive roar came from afar, shaking the entire base.</p><p>Bing Qing and Lu Ming’s expressions changed.</p><p>“It seems like the other party is very strong.” Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Lu Ming, get the hell out here. You’re not leaving today.”</p><p>That voice rang out again.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you can’t go out. Our race’s Godking will stop them,” Bing Qing quickly said.</p><p>“It’s hard to say. It seems like the other party is very powerful. Furthermore, if the two godkings from the Yimo Academy and the indestructible sword sect were to join forces, even the godkings from the aristocratic families would find it difficult to stop them.”</p><p>if it’s a blessing, it’s not a disaster. If it’s a disaster, we can’t avoid it. In that case, let’s go out and take a look.</p><p>Lu Ming was a decisive person. With that, he flew out in large strides.</p><p>Bing Qing followed behind Lu Ming anxiously.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming flew to the wall of the ice Soul clan’s base.</p><p>“That’s Lu Ming. Lu Ming is here.”</p><p>A disciple of the unique demon Academy pointed at Lu Ming and shouted.</p><p>Everyone’s gaze was on Lu Ming.</p><p>There was ferocity, curiosity, killing intent, and worry …</p><p>“Oh no, Lu Ming is really in the ice Soul Clan.”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang and the others were extremely worried.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son, the transient light Saint son, and the others were ecstatic.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
