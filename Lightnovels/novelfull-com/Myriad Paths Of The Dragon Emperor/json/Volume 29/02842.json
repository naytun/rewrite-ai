Instead, he was walking on the ground at a steady pace.</p><p>The resources on this land were more abundant than the area where Lu Ming and the rest had just entered.</p><p>Lu Ming had only been here for seven days and he had already obtained many natural treasures. Most of the divine medicine was consumed by the quantity word formula and the metal-element materials were given to QiuQiu.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>With a roar, a demonic wind gushed over. At the same time, a huge creature pounced towards Lu Ming. It was a Tiger-shaped demon with a third-level celestial deity cultivation base.</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming activated the tripled combat power of the battle formula and swept his spear out.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear struck the Tiger-shaped fiend’s sharp claws, producing a clanging sound and sparks.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming retreated a few thousand meters before he could stabilize himself.</p><p>descendant of an ancient God, how dare you come to the northern wilderness demon field? die!</p><p>The Tiger-shaped fiend roared and charged at Lu Ming again.</p><p>“As expected, it has a high level of intelligence!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>The demons they met when they first entered the world of ancient gods had no intelligence. It was said that a part of the demons in the demon field in the northern wilderness had intelligence.</p><p>The demons had intelligence, so they were undoubtedly more terrifying.</p><p>“Ball ball …”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and QiuQiu flew out. It was covered in lightning and a bolt of lightning struck out.</p><p>The bolt of lightning struck the Tiger-shaped fiend directly, sending it flying.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Tiger-shaped demonic devil roared. It was heavily injured, but it did not die. It struggled to get up and revealed a trace of fear. Then, it turned around and ran.</p><p>“Fiendish demons truly are more powerful than ordinary cultivators.”</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea. He moved and chased after the Tiger-shaped fiend.</p><p>If it was a third level heavenly deity from the Qin heaven Star Domain, he would definitely die if he was struck by QiuQiu’s lightning. However, this fiendish demon was only seriously injured and had yet to die.</p><p>Lu Ming cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique and rapidly closed the distance between him and the Tiger-shaped fiend.</p><p>descendant of the ancient God, you are the one who will die today.</p><p>At this moment, the Tiger-shaped fiend demon suddenly stopped, turned around, and roared ferociously.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s heart tightened. He felt a sense of danger.</p><p>Roar Roar Roar …</p><p>Thunderous roars were heard from the side. Four demons charged out and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Each of the demons was at the third level of the celestial deity realm, and their killing intent was as cold as a blade.</p><p>They had been ambushed.</p><p>Demons with spiritual intelligence were indeed terrifying. They had set up an ambush here in advance to lure Lu Ming over.</p><p>Lu Ming had been too careless. He was subjective and did not think that the demons would ambush him. That was why he fell for it.</p><p>The four third-level celestial deity fiendish demons charged at Lu Ming from all directions. This was a sure-kill situation. They had to kill Lu Ming in one fell swoop.</p><p>If that was all Lu Ming could do, it would be really dangerous. It would be the same even with QiuQiu.</p><p>QiuQiu could block one or two, but it definitely couldn’t block four.</p><p>However, Lu Ming still had a trump card.</p><p>ancient God Body!</p><p>Lu Ming growled. His body expanded rapidly and he turned into a hundred-meter tall giant, covered in green scales.</p><p>“Break the sky!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook the long spear in his hand and it turned into four spearlights, stabbing out from four different directions.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>The sound of four sharp blades cutting into flesh was heard. The four demons screamed and their bodies were sent flying. Their bodies were all pierced through, leaving four bloody holes. They lay on the ground and no longer had any breath.</p><p>With a single move, four third-level celestial deity demons were completely annihilated.</p><p>ancient God Body? green-armored ancient God Body? how is that possible? ”</p><p>The Tiger-shaped fiend demon from before roared in disbelief.</p><p>“Nothing is impossible. Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted as he stepped forward. His long spear pressed down and killed the Tiger-shaped fiend.</p><p>With that, the four demons were all annihilated and there were no other demons around. Lu Ming’s body shrank to the size of a normal person.</p><p>“Demons with intelligence can not be underestimated. I still have to be more careful in the future.”</p><p>Lu Ming warned himself. He then continued to explore and train.</p><p>Spring left and autumn came. Time passed year after year.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, 50 years had passed.</p><p>Lu Ming had been cultivating in the northern wilderness demon field for fifty years.</p><p>In the past fifty years, Lu Ming seemed to have really turned into an ascetic.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming had also gained a lot in the past fifty years.</p><p>The resources in this territory were too abundant. The quantity formula had devoured a large number of divine medicine. After refining them, the energy was transferred to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming broke through continuously and his cultivation had already risen from the sixth stage of true God to the eighth stage of true God.</p><p>Moreover, the 50 years of training and fighting had made great progress in all kinds of divine skills.</p><p>The nine heavenly kun Peng technique, the nine layers of Crimson Gold armor, and the three apocalyptic strikes had all been cultivated to the sixth layer, and at the peak of the sixth layer.</p><p>This caused Lu Ming’s cultivation to soar to a new height.</p><p>What was worth mentioning was that QiuQiu had eaten a large amount of metal-type materials, and its cultivation had also increased by two levels, breaking through to third level celestial deity.</p><p>His improvement speed was even faster than Lu Ming’s.</p><p>“Good wine!”</p><p>Lu Ming was lying on a branch on a huge ancient tree. He held a wine gourd and took a sip casually. He could not help but exclaim in admiration. He was extremely happy.</p><p>The wine in the calabash was brewed by a type of demon by gathering countless heavenly and earthly treasures. Lu Ming had chanced upon it and it could be considered a peerless wine. Lu Ming fell in love with it the moment he drank it.</p><p>Lying among the tree branches and drinking fine wine, Lu Ming felt extremely satisfied.</p><p>it’s fun. I’ll settle the scores quickly. It’s really fun to be free in the human world. Unfortunately, I can’t do that with my current cultivation.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed softly.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He saw a few figures flying forward in a flash not far away.</p><p>Those few figures were not fiendish demons but people from the Qin heaven star region.</p><p>“An expert from the unique devil Academy.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>From their attire, it was clear that they were from the unique devil Academy.</p><p>“Why would the people from the unique devil Academy appear in the northern desolate demon Plains? That’s strange, let’s go take a look.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He then followed them carefully.</p><p>Lu Ming followed along the ground and the few of them did not notice him at all.</p><p>Lu Ming channeled his divine energy to his ears and listened carefully to the other party’s conversation.</p><p>hurry up! The Godking has summoned us. We can’t be late.</p><p>One of them said.</p><p>“May I know why the Godking has summoned us in such a hurry this time?”</p><p>Another person asked.</p><p>it’s all about the descendants of the ancient gods. The last time our base was attacked, it was the descendants of the ancient gods behind the scenes. The celestial King also found out that there are a lot of treasures among the descendants of the ancient gods. There are even treasures that can turn people into ancient gods. So this time, many forces in the Qin heaven Star Zone have joined forces with the demons of the northern wilderness demon field. They want to wipe out the descendants of the ancient gods and take the treasures inside.</p><p>The first person said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
