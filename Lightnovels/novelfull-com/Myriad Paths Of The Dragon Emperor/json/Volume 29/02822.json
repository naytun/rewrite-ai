Do you want to come with us? ”</p><p>Bing Qing Yi laughed.</p><p>“That’s what I was thinking!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“Without further ado, let’s set off!”</p><p>A young man from the ice Soul Clan gave the order.</p><p>He was one of Bing Qing’s brothers, the third young master of the ice Soul Clan. He was also a peerless genius.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately followed the ice Soul clan’s expert and flew toward the forest.</p><p>Si si si …</p><p>When they flew into the sky above the forest, a series of hissing sounds came from the forest below. Then, a group of black figures shot out and pounced at them.</p><p>Flying snake!</p><p>They were flying snakes as thick as a finger. They had wings and were as fast as Black Lightning.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s third young master reminded them. He struck out with his palm, and a cold wave surged. Immediately, dozens of flying snakes were frozen and fell into the forest.</p><p>The other members of the ice Soul Clan attacked as well. Icy palm forces, icy fist forces, and icy sword beams slashed at the flying snakes.</p><p>The flying snakes were shot down continuously, but there were too many of them and they were very powerful. Some of the ice Soul Clan members were injured or even killed.</p><p>Whoosh … Whoosh …</p><p>Lu Ming kept stabbing with his long spear. Spearlight burst out and sent more than ten flying snakes flying. Some of them exploded directly.</p><p>“Brother Lu, your strength …”</p><p>On the side, Bing Qing was shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming’s ability had greatly exceeded his expectations.</p><p>Back then, when Lu Ming went to help them get the ice jade chilling heart, his cultivation had just broken through to true God-level, but now, he was already at the fifth stage true God Realm.</p><p>“I’m lucky. My cultivation has increased a little during this period of time.”</p><p>Lu Ming said casually.</p><p>“My cultivation has increased a little!”</p><p>Bingqing’s eyelids twitched, and she wailed in her heart. Was this a ‘little’? From stage one true God to stage five true God, this was called a point?</p><p>He also wanted to increase the price a little.</p><p>The other members of the ice Soul Clan, including the third young master, were also shocked by Lu Ming’s strength.</p><p>But now that they were facing a crisis, they didn’t think too much and continued to rush forward.</p><p>In a few other directions, the immortal sword sect, the unique demon Academy, and the boundless Holy Land were also facing the attacks of the flying snakes.</p><p>The deeper they went, the more flying snakes there were. It was as if there were countless flying snakes hidden under the forest. They were so densely packed that it made one’s scalp tingle.</p><p>Their speed became slower and slower, and it became more and more strenuous.</p><p>those below the heavenly deity stage, hide in the middle. Those above the heavenly deity stage, open a path outside!</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s third young master shouted. He ordered those below the heavenly god level to hide in the middle and those above the heavenly god level to surround him. He attacked with all his might.</p><p>The cold air surged, and large groups of flying snakes were frozen into popsicles, falling into the forest.</p><p>Two hours later, they finally rushed out of the forest and arrived at the central area of the forest.</p><p>This place was extremely wide and boundless. There was not a single blade of grass or grass, only stone pillars.</p><p>Each stone pillar was separated by a certain distance. Each stone pillar was 100 meters tall and was randomly distributed on the open space.</p><p>And below the stone pillars, there were statues.</p><p>These statues were also made of stone. Some of them were as tall as a person, while others were more than ten meters tall. They looked very realistic.</p><p>The only things he could see were stone pillars and statues.</p><p>Also, deep within the stone pillar and statue, there was a tree.</p><p>A giant tree that was over a thousand meters tall.</p><p>What surprised them was that the leaves of this tree were extremely strange. They were not green, but black, shaped like swords, like black iron swords.</p><p>The strangest thing was the fruit of this tree.</p><p>There was only one fruit on the tree, and it was a stone fruit.</p><p>Yes, it looked like it was carved out of stone and hung on the crown of the tree. It was the size of a basin and was covered with strange patterns.</p><p>The energy of the world continued to gather and finally gathered on the fruit.</p><p>The end point of the energy convergence was this fruit.</p><p>A treasure!</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were burning with passion.</p><p>Although no one knew what the fruit was, they all knew that it was definitely a treasure.</p><p>“It’s mine!”</p><p>The eyes of the purple-robed young man from the unique devil Academy flashed. Then, he led the people from the unique devil Academy and rushed toward the big tree.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>The people from the indestructible sword sect, the boundless Holy Land, and the ice Soul Clan also rushed toward the tree.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Just as they were charging forward, the statues that had been motionless suddenly moved.</p><p>Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>The statues took a step forward, and their heavy bodies caused the ground to shake. They then charged toward the crowd.</p><p>The purple-robed young man from the unique demon Academy was the first to be attacked. A ten-meter-tall statue holding a stone sword slashed at him.</p><p>The purple-robed young man’s eyes narrowed and he shouted, ” “Get lost!”</p><p>Then, a demonic blade flew out of the purple-robed young man’s hand.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The purple-robed young man’s demonic blade collided with the statue’s stone sword, creating a terrifying boom. It formed circles of terrifying sound waves that spread out.</p><p>At the moment of collision, the purple-robed young man’s expression changed drastically. His body seemed to have been hit by a divine mountain, and he actually retreated.</p><p>At this moment, even more statues arrived.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>“Ah!” “Ah!”</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere, and miserable screams continued to ring out. In the blink of an eye, at least dozens of people from the unique devil Academy had died in the hands of the various statues.</p><p>Not only the Yimo Academy, but also the immortal sword sect, the boundless Holy Land, and the ice Soul Clan had people killed by the statues. The strength of these statues was shockingly strong.</p><p>Moreover, the taller and bigger one was, the stronger one’s strength would be.</p><p>Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>The feet of these statues seemed to be equipped with Springs, and they jumped up hundreds of meters high. They waved all kinds of different stone weapons and attacked the crowd.</p><p>Lu Ming was also facing a great enemy.</p><p>An eight-meter tall statue with a stone sword in its hand charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The stone sword slashed out, and the space whistled. The terrifying force pressed down on Lu Ming, making it difficult for him to breathe.</p><p>“Moon slaying!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s spear struck out and he immediately cast the three apocalyptic strikes.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The statue’s stone sword slashed at the long spear, causing it to vibrate non-stop. Lu Ming’s body retreated frantically, feeling his arm go numb as if it was going to split open.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>After the stone sword pushed Lu Ming back, it charged at him again.</p><p>Not only that, on the other side, there was another eight to nine-meter-tall statue that was charging toward Lu Ming. It was a pincer attack and Lu Ming was in danger.</p><p>“Ball ball …”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and QiuQiu flew out. Its body was filled with lightning and a bolt of lightning blasted out, bombarding the statue.</p><p>However, to Lu Ming’s surprise, the statue seemed to be fine even after the lightning struck it. It did not slow down and continued to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>“It’s actually useless.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled.</p><p>QiuQiu saw that the lightning was useless, so it could only use its round body to crash into the other party and meet force with force.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
