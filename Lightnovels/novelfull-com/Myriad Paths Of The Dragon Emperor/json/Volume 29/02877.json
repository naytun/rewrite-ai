What did you just say?”</p><p>Zhi Zun Dong was so angry that his entire body was trembling. His hair and beard were standing on end, and his eyes were burning with rage.</p><p>Lu Ming actually dared to scold him in front of so many people. This made him furious and he wished he could slap Lu Ming to death.</p><p>not only are you shameless, but you also have bad hearing. Didn’t you hear me when I said you’re shameless? ”</p><p>Lu Ming did not give the Supreme-being any face and directly mocked him.</p><p>There was no need for Lu Ming to give face to such a shameless person.</p><p>“Brat, you don’t know your place. You’re simply going against your superior. I’ll kill you.”</p><p>The Supreme martial artist roared in anger and slapped Lu Ming.</p><p>Zhi Zun Dong was a Divine King, and his strength was astonishing. With a palm strike, the entire sky darkened, and a palm print covered the sun.</p><p>However, Yue Wuya was constantly watching the movements of the Supreme martial artist. As soon as the Supreme martial artist moved, Yue Wuya also made his move. A beam of sword light soared into the sky and slashed towards the palm print of the Supreme martial artist. The palm print was directly split apart, and the sword light and the palm print turned invisible.</p><p>“Yue Wu Ya, what are you doing? This kid is lawless and arrogant. I want to kill him, and you want to stop me?”</p><p>Supreme martial artist Dong roared.</p><p>“Nonsense. Lu Ming is right. You’re so shameless. Can’t I scold you? In my opinion, he did a good job scolding them, and he enjoyed it. What crime is there to be guilty of?”</p><p>Yue Wu Ya laughed coldly.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>The Grandmaster was furious.</p><p>However, this time, those senior statesmen who had previously helped the Supreme martial artist did not stand up to help him.</p><p>Supreme Being Dong was indeed a little shameless. Did he think that the others were fools? it was obvious that Supreme universe was no match for him and was at a disadvantage. It was simply too shameless for him to announce a draw. The other doyens would never do such a thing.</p><p>Without any help, the Supreme martial artist could no longer do anything.</p><p>At this time, the battle between Lu Ming and the Supreme Saint was still ongoing. However, Lu Ming had already gained the upper hand. The more they fought, the more the Supreme saint’s divine power was consumed and it was getting harder and harder for him to hold on.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s attacks were still as fierce as before, like a storm.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s spear swept across the Supreme-being’s body. Half of the Supreme-being’s body exploded, and blood and flesh flew everywhere.</p><p>Supreme martial artist Dong staggered backward and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>His body rapidly shrunk to the size of a normal person.</p><p>He had used up a lot of his divine power and was severely injured. He could no longer maintain his Supreme vajra body.</p><p>Now that he had returned to the size of a normal person, his abilities were much weaker and he was no match for Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear pressed down like a mountain range. The Supreme-being used all his strength to resist, but the outcome was already decided.</p><p>As the spear pressed down, the Supreme martial artist’s body trembled.</p><p>“Kneel down!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. His divine power gushed toward the spear like a tide, making the spear extremely heavy and constantly pressing down on the Supreme martial artist.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>The Supreme Saint shouted hysterically. He did not want to kneel, but he could not resist Lu Ming’s suppression.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Supreme Holy son’s body trembled and he knelt on the ground.</p><p>Si si si …</p><p>Gasps rang out in the crowd. Their eyes were filled with deep shock.</p><p>The Supreme Saint had actually knelt down. He was suppressed by another person and knelt on the ground in front of everyone.</p><p>If one did not witness this scene with their own eyes, it would be hard for one to believe it.</p><p>The Supreme Holy Son could be said to be the legend of this generation in the Kong Xuan sect. He was the strongest prodigy and was considered the best candidate for the future sect leader. He was a figure who could compete with the prodigies of the three Overlord forces.</p><p>But now, such a figure had been defeated by someone, and the person who had defeated him was a new disciple.</p><p>All of this was simply a legend.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m going to kill you!”</p><p>die! the Supreme Saint son howled madly. His eyes were blood red as he struggled madly, exuding a terrifying killing intent.</p><p>“You’re just a loser, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He took a step forward and beams of spear radiance burst out, piercing the Supreme Holy son’s body, adding to his injuries.</p><p>At the same time, the spear in his hand continued to press down, pressing the Supreme Saint son to the ground like a Toad.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took a step forward and came before the Supreme Holy Son. His body began to shrink to the size of a normal person and he stepped on the Supreme Holy son’s face.</p><p>”</p><p>The Supreme Saint roared madly. This was a great humiliation, and it was even worse than killing him.</p><p>He was stepped on by Lu Ming in public.</p><p>“Lu Ming, that’s enough!”</p><p>The Grandmaster roared in anger, his eyes revealing a cold killing intent.</p><p>If Yue Wu Ya had not stopped him, he would have already killed Lu Ming.</p><p>“Old man, you have no right to speak. That’s right, didn’t you say just now that if I were to defeat universe master, your name would be written in reverse? Now, what should you be called?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and mocked.</p><p>hahaha, not bad. Supreme move. No, I can’t call you Supreme move now. I should call you Supreme move. Hahaha, this name is really awkward. However, it suits you quite well.</p><p>Yue Wu Ya laughed out loud, extremely carefree.</p><p>“You … You guys …”</p><p>The Supreme martial artist’s face was flushed red, and he could not wait to grind Lu Ming’s bones into dust.</p><p>“Alright, that’s all for this competition.”</p><p>Right at this moment, the calm voice of the Dragon Boat Mountain rang out.</p><p>Previously, Dragon Boat Mountain had been watching coldly from the side. Now that everything was over, they finally stood up and spoke.</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain spoke. Supreme movement and Yue Wu Ya coldly looked at each other, snorted, and retreated.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming chuckled and kicked the Supreme Holy Son in the face, sending him flying.</p><p>Lu Ming was the only one left on the fighting ring.</p><p>“Alright, according to the rules, Lu Ming is the winner of this round.”</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain announced.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>At the side of the fighting ring, some people were cheering loudly.</p><p>They all belonged to Lu Ming’s faction and Ouyang Qingxiang’s faction.</p><p>Especially Yue Linglong, Wu Zifeng, and the others, they shouted especially loudly and were very excited.</p><p>The people from the Supreme Saint son’s faction, the floating light Saint son’s faction, the zhixia Saint son’s faction, the Yan Kong Saint son’s faction, and the Xue Tan Saint daughter’s faction all looked terrible.</p><p>Some people had gloomy expressions, some were sighing, and some were already thinking about how to seek new support.</p><p>according to the previous rules, Lu Ming was the one who helped Ouyang Qingxiang in the contest. Therefore, since Ouyang Qingxiang is the winner this time, I hereby announce that Ouyang Qingxiang is the future zongzi and my successor.</p><p>The Dragon boats mountain announced once again.</p><p>The scene suddenly fell silent as everyone’s eyes were focused on Ouyang Qingxiang.</p><p>“Congratulations, Ouyang zongzi!”</p><p>Lu Ming stood on the fighting ring and cupped his fists.</p><p>“Congratulations, Ouyang zongzi!”</p><p>Then, those from Ouyang Qingxiang’s faction and Lu Ming’s faction congratulated Ouyang Qingxiang.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
