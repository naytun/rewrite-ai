Boom! Boom!</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang and the others sensed around and indeed, they heard a muffled sound coming from underground. It was as if something was travelling underground and was coming toward them.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other three circulated their divine power and set up a defense around their bodies. They focused their senses.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The rumbles from the ground grew louder and louder, and so did the tremors.</p><p>“Up in the air!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression suddenly changed and he shouted.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>At this moment, the ground exploded and a Golden ray of light shot towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming did not have much time to think. He waved his long spear and placed it in front of him.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>With an earth-shattering sound, Lu Ming’s body was sent flying backward, smashing through a mountain peak.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>“Saint!”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang and the others were shocked.</p><p>“Don’t worry about me, quickly get into the air!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared and rushed out of the rubble. He soared into the sky, a trace of blood flowing from the corner of his mouth.</p><p>At the same time, Ouyang Qingxiang and the others also rushed into the sky.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The ground exploded, and a huge creature appeared on the ground.</p><p>The planet Devourer!</p><p>The only difference was that this planet Devourer was extremely burly. Standing on the ground, it was at least 30 meters tall and was completely golden in color.</p><p>The gold planet Devourer.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other three felt their hearts tremble.</p><p>Kang Chong and Liu Jie’s faces were especially pale.</p><p>The gold planet Devourer had actually come to find them.</p><p>no, this planet Devourer is injured. Look, there’s a wound on its abdomen.</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly spoke.</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang and the others looked carefully and saw many wounds on the Golden Planet Devourer.</p><p>that seems to be a fist mark. What terrifying power. Who could leave a fist mark on the Golden Planet Devourer? ”</p><p>Kang Chong’s face turned pale.</p><p>it’s the Supreme divine fist. It’s the work of the Supreme Holy Son. This golden Devourer might have escaped after being injured by the Supreme Holy Son. It just happened to come to our side.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang said.</p><p>an injured gold planet Devourer!</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. No wonder he felt that although the Devourer of the gold planet was strong, it was not too strong.</p><p>After all, he was caught off guard just now. Moreover, he had blocked the other party’s attack in his normal state.</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang was also a decisive person, so she immediately nodded.</p><p>One gold planet Devourer was worth 50 points. One needed to kill 50 bronze planet devourers or 10 Silver Planet devourers to get that amount of points.</p><p>Since they had encountered an injured golden Devourer, they could not miss it.</p><p>However, it was clear that they wanted to kill the Golden Planet Devourer, and the Golden Planet Devourer wanted to kill them too.</p><p>Squeak …</p><p>The gold planet Devourer let out a sharp cry and stomped on the ground. The ground exploded and the gold planet Devourer turned into a few gold sabers. It soared into the sky and charged toward Lu Ming, Ouyang Xiangxiang, and the others.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and his body began to grow rapidly, turning into an ancient God that was a hundred meters tall. He held his spear and charged at the Golden Planet Devourer.</p><p>“Song of the green Lotus sword!”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang also made her move. A sword Qi as thick as a mountain slashed at the Golden Planet Devourer.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The attacks of the two sides collided, creating a violent explosion and spreading energy everywhere.</p><p>Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang’s bodies trembled and they retreated backward.</p><p>However, the Golden Planet Devourer’s body also drifted back tens of thousands of meters.</p><p>This move was evenly matched, but Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang’s faces revealed joy.</p><p>This Golden Planet Devourer was indeed injured, and its combat power was severely affected. They could still fight it.</p><p>“Song of the green Lotus sword, sword shaking the world!”</p><p>die! Ouyang Qingxiang shouted. Her entire body was enveloped by a green sword light. A huge Green Lotus flower appeared under her feet. Its petals spun and wrapped around her. She seemed to have turned into a green sword Qi that descended from the sky and slashed at the Golden Planet Devourer.</p><p>ice chains, Divine Dragon phenomenon, three world-ending strikes …</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming used all kinds of divine skills and secret skills.</p><p>All sorts of attacks were launched at the Golden Planet Devourer at the same time.</p><p>Squeak …</p><p>The Golden Planet Devourer shrieked. Its two front claws were like two golden sabers. When it slashed out, two golden divine lights burst out.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The attacks from both sides dissipated, but they didn’t stop at all. Both sides launched their next round of attacks.</p><p>Kang Chong and Liu Jie couldn’t interfere in this battle at all, so they could only wait at the side.</p><p>They could only see three figures flashing and colliding in the air, creating terrifying waves of energy.</p><p>Every time they collided, rings of energy ripples would spread out in all directions. The two of them could only retreat.</p><p>The two sides fought to the death!</p><p>“Divine Dragon materialization art …”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl. He felt the blood in his body boiling, and a Dragon’s Roar came from his body.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>Two Dragon roars were heard. Two nine-clawed divine Dragons appeared above Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>Lu Ming’s Divine Dragon materialization art had a breakthrough at the critical moment and condensed two Divine Dragon images in one go.</p><p>The two nine-clawed divine Dragons roared and pounced on the Golden Planet Devourer from two directions.</p><p>Up until now, the two sides had been fighting for nearly a hundred moves. The gold planet Devourer was injured in the end and its combat strength had been greatly reduced. In addition, its injuries had flared up during the fierce battle and it was gradually losing to Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang.</p><p>Holy maiden Qingxiang, you trap it for a while. I’ll attack its injured area.</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Ouyang Qingxiang.</p><p>“Leave it to me!”</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang replied.</p><p>“Green Lotus sword domain!”</p><p>die! Ouyang Qingxiang shouted as she waved the sword in her hand in a mysterious way. Endless Green Lotus sword Qi burst out and formed a Green Lotus sword realm, pressing down on the Golden Planet Devourer.</p><p>The green Lotus sword domain formed by the boundless sword Qi wasn’t very powerful, but it was very effective in trapping enemies.</p><p>The Golden Planet Devourer was suppressed by the green Lotus sword domain. Although it waved its two front claws to split the green Lotus sword domain, it was still blocked by the endless sword Qi and its movements were still stiff.</p><p>Lu Ming wanted this opportunity.</p><p>“Three apocalyptic strikes, break the sky!”</p><p>Lu Ming became one with the spear and turned into a dazzling spear ray. He cut through the void and stabbed at the Golden Planet Devourer. Lu Ming was aiming at the fist mark on the chest of the Golden Planet Devourer.</p><p>The Golden Planet Devourer was covered in a layer of armor. It was very hard and difficult to break.</p><p>However, the carapace on its abdomen was the thinnest, and it had been injured. There were a few fist marks, which was its weakness.</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear accurately pierced the Golden Planet Devourer’s abdomen, leaving a fist print.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl, and his divine power burst out madly.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The spear finally pierced through the Golden Planet Devourer’s shell.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
