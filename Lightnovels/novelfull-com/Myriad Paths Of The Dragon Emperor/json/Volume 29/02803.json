He gritted his teeth and said, ” alright, I’ll help you once more. I’m telling you, this is the last time, and I don’t have much energy left. I might not be able to help you block that kid’s attack. You’re on your own!</p><p>“Senior only needs to block a portion of the enemy’s power for junior. Leave the rest to junior.”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>Bone could only grit his teeth and agree.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At that moment, the Tian Hong Saint son appeared above Lu Ming. His violent aura kept pressing down on Lu Ming. A six-clawed Divine Dragon Dharma image hovered above the Tian Hong Saint son’s head, looking very powerful.</p><p>“Kid, do you have any last words? I’ll give you a chance to say them.”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son said coldly, full of confidence.</p><p>If he used his full strength, even an ordinary fourth-level celestial deity would be killed by him, let alone Lu Ming.</p><p>“Make your move!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with a strong desire to fight. The six divine flames in his dantian flickered with all their might, and a Scarlet Gold armor appeared in front of him.</p><p>At the same time, nine ice chains flew out and surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>In addition, QiuQiu turned into a pool of liquid metal and climbed onto Lu Ming’s body. It manifested on Lu Ming’s body and turned into armor.</p><p>In Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness, the bone demon’s body glowed. A stream of energy surged into Lu Ming’s body and formed a layer of defense.</p><p>“Small tricks, go to hell!”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son shouted coldly, his eyes full of killing intent.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The six-clawed Divine Dragon phenomenon roared, and one of its dragon claws swiped at Lu Ming.</p><p>He wanted to kill Lu Ming in one move.</p><p>Originally, it was not allowed to kill fellow disciples in Kong Xuan sect’s territory, especially when Lu Ming was a Saint.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had taken the initiative to take a blow from the Tian Hong Saint son. In that case, he was not restricted by the sect rules.</p><p>This was also the reason why the Tian Hong Saint son had agreed. He could take the opportunity to kill Lu Ming. Otherwise, it would not be so easy to kill Lu Ming if he hid in the sect and refused to leave.</p><p>they’ve made their move. Can Lu Ming block them? ”</p><p>“Lu Ming is dead!”</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were focused on Lu Ming, and many thoughts ran through their minds.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Golden Dragon Claw was as big as a small mountain. It struck Lu Ming’s body, and the first thing to be hit was the ice chain.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Almost instantly, the nine ice chains all shattered.</p><p>“What a terrifying strength …”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked. Then, he felt an extremely powerful force pressing down on him like an avalanche.</p><p>“Block it …”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and exerted all his strength.</p><p>However, when the Dragon Claw pressed down, the mountain rocks under Lu Ming’s feet exploded and crumbled continuously, forming a huge pit. Lu Ming was blasted into the huge pit. Smoke and dust filled the air, and his figure could not be seen at all.</p><p>“How is it? Is Lu Ming dead?”</p><p>he’s definitely dead. With his cultivation, he’ll definitely die after taking a blow from the Tian Hong Saint son.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were fixed on the huge pit, eager to know Lu Ming’s situation.</p><p>“Lu Ming …”</p><p>Yue Linglong, Wu Zifeng, and Ouyang Qingxiang also stared at the big pit with worry.</p><p>“Hmph, this kid is finally dead.”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son smiled.</p><p>He had absolute confidence in his move. Although he did not use 100% of his strength, he had used 80%.</p><p>Even with 80% of his strength, he was 10000% confident that he could kill Lu Ming.</p><p>However, the next moment, the smile on the Tian Hong Saint son’s face disappeared. He was in disbelief.</p><p>“That is … Damn it, how is that possible?”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son roared.</p><p>“Cough, cough. cough …”</p><p>At this moment, a dry cough came from the big pit. The smoke and dust dispersed, and everyone finally saw the situation clearly.</p><p>He saw Lu Ming lying in the huge pit, covered in blood. He was also coughing out blood.</p><p>Lu Ming was severely injured but he did not die.</p><p>“He didn’t die, he didn’t die, he actually didn’t die!”</p><p>Oh my God, he took the Tian Hong Saint son’s attack head-on with his cultivation and didn’t die. How is that possible? ”</p><p>Many people exclaimed out of disbelief.</p><p>As for Yue Linglong, Ouyang Qingxiang, and the others, they were ecstatic.</p><p>“This fellow is indeed powerful …”</p><p>Lu Ming coughed up a few more mouthfuls of blood and circulated his divine energy to heal his injuries.</p><p>He had indeed been severely injured by the attack just now. The Tian Hong Saint son was too powerful. His own defense crumbled in an instant, and QiuQiu was injured as well. It turned into a bangle and Lu Ming put it on.</p><p>If not for bone demon’s help, he would not have been able to withstand a single move from the Tian Hong Saint son and would have been killed.</p><p>But in the end, he still managed to block it. He had made the right bet.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it, kill!”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son was furious. He was filled with killing intent. He took a step forward and a wave of earth-shattering power charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Tianhong, you’re despicable …”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang had been staring at the Tianhong Saint son for a long time. As soon as the Tianhong Saint son attacked, Ouyang Qingxiang attacked as well. She slashed out with her sword, and a beam of sword light blocked the Tianhong Saint son’s attack.</p><p>Tianhong, you made a bet with Lu Ming with one move. Now that you’ve failed to kill Lu Ming with one move, you want to make a second move. You’re going back on your word. Are you qualified to be the Saint of the Kong Xuan sect? ”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang shouted angrily.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son had no choice but to stop.</p><p>Just now, many people had seen the bet between him and Lu Ming. It was impossible for them to go back on their words now.</p><p>Tianhong, you’ve lost. Hand over the divine Dragon materialization technique.</p><p>Lu Ming struggled to get up and said to the Tian Hong Saint son.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son’s face darkened. He glared at Lu Ming and said, ” Lu Ming, I’ve underestimated you this time. However, it’s impossible for me to hand over the divine Dragon materialization art. Change your condition. I’ll try my best to satisfy you.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son actually wanted to go back on his word.</p><p>I don’t need to change my conditions. I just want the divine Dragon materialization technique. We agreed on it during the bet. Tianhong, are you going back on your word now? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son’s killing intent had reached its peak.</p><p>He had promised Lu Ming previously because he did not expect that he would lose. He thought that he would definitely win and thus agreed to Lu Ming’s request.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t push your luck.”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son said coldly. His threat was obvious.</p><p>“What insatiable? What a joke. I’m just getting what I deserve. I risked my life for this. Tianhong, hand over the divine Dragon materialization technique.”</p><p>Lu Ming said loudly.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son gritted his teeth and wished he could cut Lu Ming into pieces.</p><p>However, with so many people watching today, if he went back on his word in public, it would damage his reputation greatly. It would also be disadvantageous for him to compete for the position of the sect leader of Kong Xuan sect in the future.</p><p>What right did a person who went back on his word have to be in charge of the Kong Xuan sect?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
