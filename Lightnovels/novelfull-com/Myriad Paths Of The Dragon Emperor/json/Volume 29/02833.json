Moreover, he had to avoid demons.</p><p>If he followed the middle-aged man, at least he would not have to worry about demons. Furthermore, even if he encountered the people from the unique devil Academy or the immortal sword sect, he would have helpers.</p><p>“I’m gu Hongshan, what’s your name?”</p><p>The middle-aged man said.</p><p>“My name is Lu Ming!”</p><p>Lu Ming answered.</p><p>“Lu? My clan actually has such a surname? However, you ascetics are a bunch of perverts, so it’s normal for you to use a different surname.”</p><p>Gu Hongshan mumbled a few words and did not think much about it. Lu Ming was relieved.</p><p>“Senior, what’s the situation with the outsiders? How’s the situation now?”</p><p>Lu Ming pretended to ask, wanting to know some information.</p><p>“The outsiders are people from beyond the heavens. As soon as they entered, they destroyed our living environment and plundered the heavenly resources here. They even killed many of my clansmen. So this time, the various tribes of my clan have joined forces and sent out a large number of experts. There are even godkings. They’ve joined forces with the monster demon clan to attack the outsiders.”</p><p>however, there are also many experts among the outsiders. Although we killed a group of them, most of them ran away in batches. They are now hunting each other in the barbaric mountains with our race.</p><p>Gu Hongshan explained.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He could roughly understand.</p><p>The other party was treating them as invaders, which was why they launched an attack on them.</p><p>This was also very normal. When faced with an invasion, it was natural to launch a counterattack.</p><p>” we ancient God descendants have lived in this world since ancient times, standing aloof from worldly affairs. I didn’t expect an outsider to descend this time. For our race, this could very well be a disaster.   the ancient God race’s elder said.</p><p>Gu Hongshan sighed.</p><p>the descendants of the ancient gods. They are indeed the descendants of the ancient gods.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>These people were also descendants of the ancient gods. What was their relationship with the ancient gods on the ancient gods Mountain?</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s go. Not far away, my clan is attacking a few outsiders. I’m rushing over to help. Come with me.”</p><p>Gu Hongshan said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Then, he and Gu Hongshan rushed in a direction.</p><p>Gu Hongshan’s cultivation was very high and his speed was naturally shocking. He was afraid that Lu Ming could not keep up with him and deliberately slowed down. However, when he turned around, Lu Ming was still following him.</p><p>He increased his speed and Lu Ming could keep up.</p><p>haha, as expected of the descendant of the ascetics. Amazing, amazing.</p><p>Gu Hongshan laughed.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and did not say much.</p><p>Soon, they had passed through tens of thousands of miles of forest.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>In front of him, the sound of swords clashing reverberated continuously, and rays of sword light shot up into the sky.</p><p>They were from the immortal sword sect.</p><p>At this moment, a few experts from the eternal sword sect were fighting with a few tall ancient God descendants.</p><p>These descendants of the ancient gods were all tall, ranging from ten to twenty meters tall. They were all covered in red scales.</p><p>They were extremely strong and powerful, forcing the few experts of the eternal sword sect to retreat.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you stay here and watch. I’ll go kill those outsiders.”</p><p>Gu Hongshan said to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Be careful, senior.”</p><p>Lu Ming reminded.</p><p>“Haha, don’t worry. I don’t care about these few outsiders.”</p><p>Gu Hongshan laughed and took a step forward.</p><p>In the process of charging out, his body rapidly expanded. In an instant, he turned into a ‘giant’ that was more than 30 meters tall and covered in red scales.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>A few experts from the eternal sword sect turned pale when they saw Gu Hongshan.</p><p>“Outsider, die!”</p><p>Gu Hongshan rushed over and threw out a punch.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The void seemed like it was about to explode and there was a terrifying vibration. Gu Hongshan’s punch had destroyed the sword light of an expert from the eternal sword sect and landed on his body.</p><p>The expert from the eternal sword sect let out a blood-curdling screech as his body was sent flying. He exploded in mid-air, his flesh and blood splattering everywhere.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>That expert from the eternal sword sect was at least at the fifth level heavenly God Realm, but he was blown up by Gu Hongshan with a single punch.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Gu Hongshan was incomparably ferocious. He continuously punched out, and the remaining experts of the eternal sword sect were all blown up by Gu Hongshan.</p><p>“Haha, Gu Hongshan, you’ve come at the right time,”</p><p>“But even if you didn’t come, we could have dealt with these outsiders.”</p><p>The other ‘Giants’ laughed and quickly transformed into the size of normal people.</p><p>The two burly men and the two burly elders were no different from normal people.</p><p>Other than the thick ancient God aura on his body.</p><p>Gu Hongshan had also returned to his normal size.</p><p>I met a little brother on the way. Otherwise, I would have come earlier. Come, let me introduce you to someone. He is the descendant of the ascetics.</p><p>Gu Hongshan said.</p><p>“What? The descendants of the ascetics?”</p><p>“I’ve never seen an ascetic before. Where is he?”</p><p>The rest of them scanned their surroundings and looked in Lu Ming’s direction. They could sense his aura.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward.</p><p>” such dense ancient God energy.</p><p>A few descendants of the ancient gods sized Lu Ming up, their eyes filled with surprise.</p><p>“Come, let me introduce you. This is Lu Ming.”</p><p>“Lu Ming, this is Guyuan …”</p><p>Gu Hongshan introduced them to each other and Lu Ming greeted them politely.</p><p>Lu Ming, I can sense a dense ancient God aura in your body. Could it be that you’ve already condensed the ancient God’s heart? ”</p><p>One of the elders sized Lu Ming up carefully and said in shock.</p><p>“What? The heart of the ancient God?”</p><p>Gu Hongshan and the rest were shocked. They looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>yes, I have indeed condensed the ancient God’s heart.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He immediately controlled the ancient God’s heart and made it beat faster. A red light was emitted from his chest as if a heart had emerged. A rich ancient God aura filled the air.</p><p>ancient God’s heart, it’s really the ancient God’s heart. Genius, genius!</p><p>“He’s truly a peerless genius.</p><p>Gu Hongshan and the others muttered to themselves.</p><p>brother Gu Hongshan, is the heart of the ancient God rare? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked in surprise.</p><p>of course it’s rare. You’re an ascetic, so you might not know much. In my clan, the thickness of the ancient God bloodline determines the strength of one’s talent. The thicker the ancient God bloodline, the stronger one’s talent.</p><p>only when the ancient God bloodline is extremely dense will the ancient God heart be born. Let’s put it this way, it is extremely rare for an ancient God heart to be born in our clan. Every one of them is an unparalleled genius. Their future achievements are limitless!</p><p>Gu Hongshan explained.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
