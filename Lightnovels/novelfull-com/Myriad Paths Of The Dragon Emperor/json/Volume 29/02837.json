It was covered with sharp spikes and looked extremely ferocious.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you make the first move!”</p><p>Gu Ming looked at Lu Ming and said.</p><p>With his celestial God cultivation base, he had already lost face by fighting Lu Ming. At this moment, he did not want to take advantage of him.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Six divine flames burned in his body and the battle character formula was triggered to quadruple his combat power.</p><p>“The three apocalyptic strikes, break the sky!“</p><p>A long spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hand. A dazzling spear gleam streaked across the void, heading straight for Gu Ming.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>The moment Lu Ming made his move, many of the descendants of the ancient gods were shocked.</p><p>The power of Lu Ming’s move had completely reached the level of a divine realm expert. It was much stronger than when he had fought Gu Zhuo and the others.</p><p>Gu Ming’s pupils also shrank, and his expression turned serious.</p><p>“God critical strike!”</p><p>die! Gu Ming shouted and unleashed his full power. He waved his Mace, bringing with it a strong wind and smashing it toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The two attacks collided. In the void, it was as if hundreds of millions of explosives had exploded, causing a terrifying tremor.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The long spear in Lu Ming’s hands trembled violently. Lu Ming felt a surge of energy and he retreated rapidly.</p><p>At the same time, Gu Ming’s figure also retreated rapidly. He retreated even more than Lu Ming.</p><p>so powerful. He’s really powerful. Lu Ming actually managed to force Gu Ming to retreat.</p><p>Gu Ming is a celestial God. His combat strength is terrifying. I don’t think Gu Ming can defeat Lu Ming without using the ancient God Body.</p><p>“Indeed!”</p><p>The descendants of the ancient God clan were all shocked.</p><p>Gu Ming’s eyes were also extremely serious, but his fighting spirit was even stronger.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re really something. It looks like I’m no match for you even if I don’t transform into my ancient God Body. You’ll have to be careful from now on,”</p><p>As soon as Gu Ming finished speaking, a terrifying aura burst out from his body.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A roar came from Gu Ming’s body, as if an ancient God was roaring.</p><p>At the same time, Gu Ming’s body grew rapidly. He grew to more than twenty meters at an astonishing speed.</p><p>Moreover, Gu Ming was different from Gu Hongshan and the others. His body was covered in orange scales, which glowed under the sun.</p><p>The mace in his hand also grew in size with Gu Ming’s body.</p><p>A giant appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>This was the orange-armored ancient God Body.</p><p>“God critical strike!”</p><p>Gu Ming hollered and swung his Mace at Lu Ming again. The sky shook violently. The power this time was much stronger than the previous time.</p><p>“Three apocalyptic strikes, moon-cutting!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming growled. Thick divine power gushed into the long spear. The long spear struck down and a crescent-shaped spear light burst out.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The two sides clashed for the second time. The terrifying sound waves spread out in all directions.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s body was blasted away like a cannonball. He was thrown hundreds of miles away, leaving a long trail of air.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Lu Ming had already activated the nine-layer Crimson Gold armor. However, at that moment, cracks appeared on the armor. Lu Ming felt his entire body go numb and he almost spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“What a terrifying strength …”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Gu Ming’s huge body in front of him, his heart filled with shock.</p><p>Gu Ming’s power had exceeded his expectations. Even if he used all his strength, it would be difficult for him to fight against Gu Ming’s power.</p><p>is this the power of the ancient God Body? ”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. He could not help but look forward to it.</p><p>Gu Ming was a completely different person when he had the ancient God Body and when he hadn’t. The difference in power was too great.</p><p>And this was only the orange-armored ancient God Body. If he could awaken an even stronger ancient God Body, how strong would he be?</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart was burning with desire for the ancient God Body.</p><p>“Lu Ming, do you want to do it again?”</p><p>Gu Ming’s deep voice rang out.</p><p>“Of course I’m coming. This is just the beginning.”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed. He had not used his tricks yet.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, Lu Ming cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique. In a flash, he appeared above Gu Ming’s head. Nine ice chains flew out and wrapped around Gu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, a nine-clawed Divine Dragon appeared and pounced at Gu Ming with a roar.</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>Gu Ming waved his Mace and struck at the ice chains and the nine-clawed Divine Dragon.</p><p>However, as Lu Ming’s cultivation level increased, the power of the ice shackles and the divine Dragon materialization technique had also increased significantly. They were not so easy to break now.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>Although the ice chains and the nine-clawed Divine Dragon were swept away by Gu Ming, they were not destroyed. After they were swept away, they continued to attack Gu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming himself also cast the ‘moon-cutting’ move and attacked Gu Ming.</p><p>It could be said that Lu Ming had used all his means and exerted his strength to the extreme.</p><p>However, he was still no match for an unknown opponent. He could not get close to Gu Ming at all and form an effective attack. Every time he attacked, Gu Ming would deflect it with terrifying power.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s speed was extremely fast and his methods were complicated and varied. Gu Ming could not defeat Lu Ming in a short time. The two of them had exchanged dozens of moves, but neither of them had a winner.</p><p>Alright, alright, let’s stop fighting. There’s no point in fighting like this.</p><p>After a while, Gu Ming suddenly cried out. He waved his Mace and knocked away the ice chains and the nine-clawed Divine Dragon. He quickly retreated and shrunk to the size of an ordinary person.</p><p>With a single thought, the ice chain flew back to Lu Ming’s body and disappeared. The nine-clawed Divine Dragon also dispersed.</p><p>” the orange-armored ancient God Body is truly powerful.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>you’re the one who’s amazing. You haven’t awakened your ancient God Body and your cultivation is only at tier five true God, but you’re so strong. You’re really abnormal.</p><p>Gu Ming sighed, but his eyes were filled with admiration.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and smiled. He had relied on the combination of various secret skills and godly skills to fight Gu Ming. He was definitely not Gu Ming’s match if he were to fight him head-on.</p><p>Although Gu Ming’s cultivation was at the first-level sky celestial realm, his combat strength increased dramatically when he transformed into the ancient God Body. The power of a head-on collision would probably crush a second-level sky celestial realm expert and be comparable to a third-level sky celestial realm expert.</p><p>However, his weakness was his slow speed and few changes. Otherwise, Lu Ming would definitely not be a match for Gu Ming.</p><p>when you awaken your ancient God Body, let’s have a spar.</p><p>Gu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>At the same time, the other descendants of the ancient God were also in a heated discussion. They were shocked by Lu Ming’s abilities.</p><p>“Is this the strength of an ascetic? Isn’t that a little too terrifying?”</p><p>“It’s indeed too shocking. Ordinary ascetics are definitely not this powerful. I reckon that Lu Ming is a peerless genius even among the ascetics.”</p><p>“Definitely!”</p><p>Everyone nodded in unison. If an Ordinary Bitter cultivator had such strength, it would be a huge blow to them.</p><p>They did not doubt Lu Ming’s various means. In their opinion, it was normal for ascetics to have all kinds of wonderful means when they walked through all kinds of dangerous places to train themselves.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
