This ray of light was silver in color and was like a heavenly blade. It slashed toward Ouyang Xiangxiang at an astonishing speed.</p><p>Fast, it was too fast!</p><p>This ray of light completely enveloped Ouyang Qingxiang, Kang Chong, and Liu Jie.</p><p>At that moment, it was too late for Ouyang Qingxiang to Dodge.</p><p>And even if she could avoid it, Kang Chong and Liu Jie couldn’t.</p><p>“Green Lotus sword domain!”</p><p>die! Ouyang Qingxiang shouted. Beams of green sword Qi bloomed from her body, forming lotus flowers that surrounded the three of them.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Ray of silver light slashed at the green Lotus, causing it to explode and shatter.</p><p>The ray of light continued to bombard Ouyang Qingxiang’s body.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang had already used her protective divine skill and was wearing a protective armor. However, when she was hit by the attack, her body flew out and she spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Holy maiden!”</p><p>Kang Chong and Liu Jie were shocked and rushed toward Ouyang Qingxiang.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique and seemed to have transformed into a huge kun Peng. In a flash, his hundred-meter-tall figure stood in front of Ouyang Qingxiang and the others, looking forward.</p><p>At this moment, the silver light finally revealed its true appearance.</p><p>It was a Silver Planet Devourer. It looked almost the same as the bronze Devourer from before, but it was silver in color.</p><p>“Silver-tier planet Devourer!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p>For silver-grade planet devourers, killing one would give five points.</p><p>The silver Devourer’s eyes were cold as it stared at Lu Ming. Suddenly, it twisted its body and turned into a silver light, charging at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Ice chains, appear!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and the nine ice chains flew out towards the silver Planet Devourer.</p><p>However, the silver Planet Devourer’s speed was extremely shocking. It flashed continuously in the air and dodged the attack of the ice chains. It continued to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>“Break the air, break the air …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear burst out and he stabbed more than ten times in an instant.</p><p>This time, the silver Planet Devourer no longer dodged. It waved its sharp claws and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>In an instant, the two of them had exchanged more than a dozen moves.</p><p>Lu Ming felt a terrifying force traveling along the long spear, numbing his arms and forcing him to retreat.</p><p>what a terrifying power …</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>After the collision just now, Lu Ming was shocked to discover that the strength of the silver Planet Devourer was above his.</p><p>He had the ancient God Body, but his power was still suppressed.</p><p>‘Squeak …’</p><p>With a sharp cry, the silver Planet Devourer’s two sharp claws slashed at Lu Ming like a storm.</p><p>Lu Ming brandished his long spear and fought with all his might. Nine ice chains were continuously swung out, but they were easily shattered by the opponent’s sharp claws.</p><p>However, Lu Ming still had a lot of divine power. After the ice chain was broken, it continued to condense. In this way, the cold air on the ice chain still had some effect on the silver Planet Devourer.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Dragon’s Roar shook the sky. Lu Ming cast the divine Dragon materialization art and a nine-clawed Divine Dragon pounced forward with a roar.</p><p>Lu Ming used all his means and finally stabilized the situation.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m here to help you,”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang stabilized her injuries and her divine power surged. A huge Green Lotus flower appeared and pressed down on the silver Planet Devourer. Endless sword Qi continued to attack the Devourer.</p><p>Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang joined forces and finally turned the tables. They finally began to gain the upper hand.</p><p>Although the silver Planet Devourer was powerful, it had to defend against Ouyang Xiangxiang’s attack and Lu Ming’s attack at the same time. It was at a disadvantage.</p><p>“Moon slaying!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his long spear and attacked the silver Devourer frantically.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The silver Planet Devourer tried its best to resist, but it was sent flying a few thousand meters.</p><p>“Green Lotus sword domain!”</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang pressed her hands down, and small green Lotus flowers appeared around the silver Planet Devourer. The endless sword Qi left scars on the silver Planet Devourer.</p><p>After being besieged by Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang, the silver Planet Devourer finally lost and was completely suppressed.</p><p>They exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming’s spear pierced through the silver Planet Devourer’s mouthpart. Then, Ouyang Qingxiang slashed out with her sword and cut off the silver Planet Devourer’s head.</p><p>hu hu …</p><p>Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang often exhaled.</p><p>They had finally dealt with the silver Planet Devourer.</p><p>The strength of the silver Planet Devourer was beyond their imagination. It was too powerful. Lu Ming could barely fight against it alone. He was not the silver Planet Devourer’s match.</p><p>In addition, Ouyang Xiangxiang had to fight for a long time before she could kill the silver Planet Devourer.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body shrank and returned to his normal form. He felt a sense of weakness, which was caused by the great consumption of his physical strength.</p><p>Lu Ming had the ” measure ” formula and he had an endless supply of divine power. However, physical strength was not divine power.</p><p>transforming into ancient God form consumed a lot of energy, and the longer he maintained it, the more energy he consumed.</p><p>Of course, as Lu Ming’s divine body became stronger, his physical strength would also become stronger.</p><p>Physical strength was related to the strength of one’s divine body, not divine power.</p><p>“Let’s go. We’ll leave this place and find a place to rest.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang and the others nodded and left in a flash. They found a hidden place and stopped.</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang had been ambushed by the silver Planet Devourer and had suffered serious injuries. Lu Ming also needed to recover his strength.</p><p>They stayed here for two days, and after two days, everyone’s condition had already recovered to its peak.</p><p>we still have to be careful. Don’t release too many divine crystals or gemstones to avoid attracting too many planet devourers.</p><p>Lu Ming suggested.</p><p>Last time, they had only attracted one silver Planet Devourer, and they had almost been in danger. If there were more of them, they would be in danger.</p><p>It would be even more terrifying if a gold planet Devourer came.</p><p>If the silver Planet Devourer was already so powerful, one could only imagine how powerful the gold planet Devourer was.</p><p>I didn’t expect the planet Devourer to be so powerful. I wonder how the Supreme Saint son and the transient light Saint son are doing.</p><p>Kang Chong sighed, slightly worried.</p><p>The planet Devourer was too powerful. He and Liu Jie had not been of much help when they had entered, and he felt a little guilty.</p><p>“No need to think too much, let’s go!”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang patted Kang Chong and Liu Jie’s shoulders and was about to leave.</p><p>“Wait a moment!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly called out.</p><p>“Brother Lu, what’s wrong?”</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang asked in surprise.</p><p>be careful. Is there something underground? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a grave expression.</p><p>“There’s something underground?”</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang, Kang Chong, and Liu Jie’s expressions changed as they focused their senses.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
