Their wingspans were no less than fifty meters.</p><p>no, this isn’t a real living being. It’s made of some kind of energy.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He could tell that the three big birds were not living creatures at all. They were condensed from a kind of energy and did not have any life aura at all.</p><p>“Flying snow!”</p><p>The five young men and women of the multi-story building sect all used a battle-ax with amazing power. When the battle-ax chopped down, it completely suppressed the three giant birds.</p><p>In particular, there was a black-robed youth whose strength was not weaker than Ouyang Xiangxiang’s. With a swing of his battle-ax, he chopped off the wings of a large bird.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The black-robed young man shouted. His battle-axe swept across with the might to split open the sky. The axe light swept across, and the big bird’s head was chopped off. Its body then collapsed.</p><p>To Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang’s surprise, after the big Bird dispersed, it actually turned into a stream of energy and surged into the black-robed young man’s body. The black-robed young man’s face was full of satisfaction and excitement.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Then, the black-robed young man attacked the other two big birds.</p><p>Not long after, the remaining two birds were both killed. Just like the previous one, these two birds also collapsed and turned into waves of energy that were absorbed by the five young men and women.</p><p>awesome, this is so awesome! If this continues, our cultivation will break through very soon!</p><p>A young woman said with excitement on her face.</p><p>“That’s right. I don’t know what these giant birds are. After killing them, we can actually absorb their energy. This is truly a great opportunity. Let’s go, we’ll continue moving forward.”</p><p>The black-robed young man said. Then, the five of them continued to move forward. Not long after, several large birds appeared and pounced at the black-robed young man’s group.</p><p>what a waste! They’re simply wasting God’s gift by absorbing it like that! I’m so angry!</p><p>In his sea of consciousness, the quantity formula shouted unhappily.</p><p>“Old Liang, do you know what those big birds are?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Nonsense, of course I know. It’s formed by the energy overflowing from the star core fragments. The energy from the star core is extremely pure, so the energy overflowing from the star core fragments can be directly absorbed by people.”</p><p>The quantity formula said.</p><p>“A star core fragment!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>No wonder the black-robed young man and his group of five were able to absorb the energy of that huge bird after killing it.</p><p>it’s a complete waste for them to absorb it like that. I’m afraid they can’t even absorb half of the energy, and the rest will dissipate. If it were me, I would definitely be able to absorb 100%.</p><p>The quantity formula said.</p><p>you’re saying that there are star core fragments in this area? ”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to ask.</p><p>that’s right, kid. If you can get the star core fragment, I’m confident that I can help you break through to the sky celestial realm in a short time!</p><p>The quantity formula said.</p><p>“I must get the star core fragment.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was about to rush out and chase away the black-robed young man and the others to occupy this place, a few rainbow lights flew over rapidly from the distance.</p><p>“It’s him, four eyes void court!”</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze around and discovered that the newcomer was the peerless genius of the unique demon Academy, four-eyed void court.</p><p>In addition, there were also a few geniuses from the unique demon Academy.</p><p>The black-robed youth and the others also discovered four-eyed kongting’s group, and their faces darkened.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Simu kongting and the others stood in the air, looking at the few large birds with greed.</p><p>“This is … It was formed by the overflowing energy of a star core fragment. Hahaha, there’s actually a star core fragment here!”</p><p>The four-eyed King Kong ting roared in his heart, his four eyes filled with greed.</p><p>As a peerless heaven’s favorite of the three Overlord forces, he naturally had a broad vision. With just a glance, he could tell that this giant bird was formed by the energy overflowing from a star core fragment. This was a great opportunity.</p><p>“You guys can get lost. I want this place.”</p><p>Four-eyed Kong ting said coldly.</p><p>four-eyed empty court. We found this place first. It’s too domineering of you to chase us away like this!</p><p>The black-robed young man said with a gloomy expression.</p><p>“Overbearing? Hehe, you don’t have to leave, but you can stay here forever.”</p><p>Four-eyed Kong ting sneered.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>The black-robed young man and the other four revealed angry expressions. They had finally encountered such an opportunity, so they were somewhat unwilling to leave like this.</p><p>They quickly retreated and dodged the attacks of a few big birds. They retreated to the side, but they had no intention of leaving.</p><p>“Do you still have any hope of getting lucky? You’re really stupid. Then I’ll send you on your way.”</p><p>kill! si mu Kong ting shouted coldly. As his four eyes opened and closed, four beams of light shot out towards the black-robed youth and the other four.</p><p>“Flying snow!”</p><p>The black-robed young man bellowed as he continuously struck out with his battle-axe, sending out a dozen axe-lights towards the light beam that was shot out from the four-eyed void.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>After a few violent rumbles, the black-robed young man’s body trembled and he retreated, spitting out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>He was no match for the four-eyed void court.</p><p>Just like when Ouyang Qingxiang was up against the Supreme universe, she could not even block a few moves.</p><p>“Hehe, four eyes empty court, you’re really very impressive!”</p><p>At this moment, a cold laugh came from the distance. Then, a few sword lights flickered rapidly. The next moment, a few more figures appeared in the area.</p><p>A few young men were carrying long swords on their backs. The one in the lead had sword-like eyebrows and eagle-like eyes, and he had an extraordinary appearance.</p><p>“Zhuo bingchen!”</p><p>Four-eyed Kong ting’s gaze turned cold, revealing a trace of solemness.</p><p>it’s him. He’s an extremely powerful prodigy from the indestructible sword sect. He’s only second to the deity, Wuji swordsman. He’s no weaker than universe God!</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang’s face was solemn as she sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He could also sense a terrifying sword intent from this person.</p><p>When the black-robed youth and the other four saw Zhuo Wudi appear, their faces became even uglier.</p><p>The four-eyed emptiness and Zhuo bumu’s appearance meant that the opportunities in this place had nothing to do with them.</p><p>I’m so lucky. This place actually has a star core fragment. Haha, it’s mine.</p><p>Zhuo Wu fa laughed out loud, full of confidence and greed.</p><p>“It’s yours? Zhuo Bingwu, you’re really overconfident!”</p><p>Four-eyed Kong ting sneered.</p><p>“Four eyes in the void, you want to stop me? The outside world has always placed me on the same level as you. Today, I’ll see what qualifications you have to be on the same level as me!”</p><p>Zhuo Buzhu said coldly. As soon as he finished speaking, a terrifying sword essence rose from his body. With a swish, his long sword was drawn and a white sword light shot towards the four-eyed void.</p><p>“Four eyes set the sky!”</p><p>Four eyes shouted loudly. His four eyes were like four suns, giving off a dazzling light. Then, four rays of light burst out and turned into four long Spears that shot towards Zhuo bumu.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The sword light and the destructive light beam collided continuously, causing terrifying sound waves to erupt. In an instant, the two of them had exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>After dozens of moves, the two of them retreated at the same time.</p><p>They were evenly matched!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
