You don’t have the right to know.”</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang said indifferently.</p><p>The Supreme Holy Son rolled his eyes and suddenly had an idea. He shouted, ” I know, you guys must have been lucky to have found the burial ground of the planet Devourer and dug up the bodies of many gold-tier planet devourers. That’s why you were able to get so many heads of the planet devourers.</p><p>and look, these three heads are shriveled, caused by the loss of too much essence. This must be the gold planet Devourer that has been dead for many years.</p><p>Finally, the Supreme Holy Son pointed at the heads of the three mutated golden devourers.</p><p>The head of the mutated golden Devourer looked like it had been dead for many years because of the purple copper coffin.</p><p>The Supreme Holy son’s words made many people come to a realization.</p><p>so that’s how it is. No, that must be it. They’re lucky to have found the graveyard where the planet is buried!</p><p>that’s right. Otherwise, if the Supreme Holy Son could only kill one gold planet Devourer, how could they have killed 14? it’s like a fantasy.</p><p>yes, I guess that’s how they got their bronze planet devourers and silver Planet devourers.</p><p>“My luck is too good!”</p><p>The crowd was in a heated discussion.</p><p>On the other hand, Ouyang Xiangxiang, Kang Chong, and Liu Jie’s faces turned ugly.</p><p>“Who said we’ve come across the burial ground of the planet Devourer? I’m telling you, we killed these planet devourers with our own hands.”</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang shouted.</p><p>“You killed it yourself? Hahaha, Ouyang Qingxiang, do you have the strength to do so? It’s you? Or Lu Ming? Aren’t you afraid that people will laugh at you?”</p><p>Supreme universe sneered.</p><p>He did not believe that Ouyang Qingxiang, Lu Ming, and the rest could kill so many planet devourers.</p><p>“Hmph, you’re making wild guesses. Supreme elder, you can announce the scores now.”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang coldly snorted, then looked at Supreme Being Dong.</p><p>Supreme martial artist Dong’s face was somewhat gloomy. However, he could only announce Ouyang Xiangxiang’s score at this moment.</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang, a total of 14 golden Devourer heads, 20 silver Devourer heads, and 101 silver Devourer heads, a total of 801 points.</p><p>The Supreme martial artist announced.</p><p>Everyone’s heart was in turmoil.</p><p>801 points, almost 600 more than the Supreme Holy Son.</p><p>Such a high score made the competition this time simple and confusing.</p><p>Perhaps, Ouyang Qingxiang would be able to use her advantage in this round to obtain the final victory.</p><p>alright, the first round is over. Next, let’s move on to the second round.</p><p>The Grandmaster’s voice rang out, and his eyes flickered with a scheming light as he said, the second round is very simple. The three of you, 12 people, will go up to the fighting stage together. It will be a chaotic battle between the three sides. Whoever remains on the fighting stage will be the winner. The winner will be the future zongzi.</p><p>As soon as he said that, many people were stunned.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang’s grandfather was even more furious. He stepped forward and said, ” “Paragon move? what’s the meaning of this? the rules of the second round are inappropriate.”</p><p>“Inappropriate? what’s inappropriate?”</p><p>Supreme martial artist Dong sneered.</p><p>nonsense, of course it’s inappropriate. This way, the winner will be decided in the second round. What’s the point of the first round then? ”</p><p>as I said before, we will combine the points from both rounds. The one with the highest points will be the future zongzi.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang’s grandfather retorted loudly.</p><p>Lu Ming, Ouyang Qingxiang, and the rest also looked gloomy.</p><p>The actions of the Supreme martial artist were clearly biased towards the Supreme martial artist universe.</p><p>He had used this rule because he saw that the Supreme universe was too far behind in points in the first round. If he combined the points of the two rounds, the Supreme universe might not be able to compete with Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang.</p><p>In this way, the first round of the competition was meaningless.</p><p>I’ve said before that the second round will be based on an arena tournament, combining the points from both rounds. However, I think that’s more inappropriate. The future zongzis must have the strongest combat strength. The weaker one will be chosen as a zongzi. Taking over the Kong Xuan sect in the future will only make the Kong Xuan sect weaker and weaker. Only the strongest person can lead the Kong Xuan sect to become the strongest in the future.</p><p>The Supreme martial artist said.</p><p>“The Supreme martial artist is moving. You’re quibbling …”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang’s grandfather shouted angrily.</p><p>“What excuse? However, in the first round, Ouyang Qingxiang, Lu Ming, and the rest did not rely on their own strength to hunt and obtain so many points. They were lucky and obtained the burial ground of a planet Devourer. This is not the purpose of the test at all.”</p><p>if you want to count them by points, that’s fine. It’ll only be meaningful if Ouyang Qingxiang and the others ‘points in the first round are cleared to zero.</p><p>Supreme martial artist Dong sneered.</p><p>Supreme martial artist, what makes you think that Xiang Xiang and the others got their points by luck and not by killing with their strength? ”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang’s grandfather shouted.</p><p>Supreme move was despicable. Previously, the Supreme Holy son’s tone only said that he guessed that Ouyang Qingxiang and the rest had obtained the burial ground of the planet Devourer. However, Supreme move directly asserted that Lu Ming and the rest had obtained the burial ground of the planet Devourer and did not rely on their own strength.</p><p>He rejected the results of Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang, Kang Chong, and Liu Jie were all furious.</p><p>“Kill them with their own strength? hahaha, can they kill 14 gold planet devourers? If they were able to kill fourteen Golden Planet devourers with their true strength, then I, the Supreme one, would be able to write my name backwards.”</p><p>Supreme martial artist Dong sneered.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang’s grandfather was furious, but he had nothing to say.</p><p>In fact, he also felt that Lu Ming, Ouyang Qingxiang, and the rest had also obtained the burial ground of the planet Devourer. Therefore, he could not refute it at the moment.</p><p>“I agree with the Supreme elder’s suggestion.”</p><p>At this moment, a voice suddenly rang out, attracting everyone’s attention.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes turned to the person who spoke.</p><p>“Eh? It’s Lu Ming.”</p><p>“He actually agrees with the Supreme elder’s opinion?”</p><p>he probably has a guilty conscience and knows that he didn’t get the points in the right way, so he agreed.</p><p>that’s for sure. I’m guessing that he doesn’t dare to offend the Supreme Holy Son and the Supreme doyen.</p><p>Many people were guessing.</p><p>The person who spoke just now was naturally Lu Ming.</p><p>“You agree?”</p><p>The Supreme martial artist also looked at Lu Ming. To be honest, he was also a little surprised that Lu Ming would agree.</p><p>that’s right, I agree. I think what the Supreme elder said makes sense. Since it’s a zongzi contest, strength should be the deciding factor.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you …”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang was anxious and quickly sent a message to Lu Ming.</p><p>If they followed the Supreme martial artist’s method, then the advantage they had built up in the first round would be completely useless.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
