He had transformed into a green-armored ancient God and defeated the Tian Hong Saint son.</p><p>Today, it was the same.</p><p>“Moon slaying sword, moon slaying sword …”</p><p>The long spear in Lu Ming’s hands was as large as a mountain. He kept performing the moon-cutting move and bombarding Saint son zhixia.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming cast the ice chain and the divine Dragon materialization technique.</p><p>The nine ice chains continued to wrap around Holy Son Zhi Xia, seriously interfering with his performance.</p><p>The two nine-clawed divine Dragons roared continuously and completely suppressed Saint son Zhi Xia.</p><p>Kang Chong and Liu Jie did not need to do anything.</p><p>“The sacred son of reflection is going to lose.”</p><p>that’s right. Lu Ming and Holy maiden Qingxiang’s abilities are truly astonishing. When they join forces with the Supreme Saint, the transient light Saint and the others are no match for them.</p><p>that’s right. Look, the sacred son of reflection is about to lose. The Supreme sacred son is too strong.</p><p>Many of the onlookers discussed animatedly. Suddenly, someone shouted.</p><p>At that moment, the Supreme Saint son had completely suppressed the transient light Saint son. The terrifying fist force pressed toward the transient light Saint son like an avalanche.</p><p>The sacred son couldn’t hold on any longer. The Supreme Saint punched him in the chest. The sacred son screamed and spat out a mouthful of blood. His body exploded and he was blown off the fighting ring.</p><p>“Ah, damn it!”</p><p>The sacred son of reflection roared. Being blasted off the battle platform meant that he had lost. He no longer had any fate with the zongzi position, and he was truly unwilling to accept this.</p><p>After the Supreme Saint son defeated the transient light Saint son, his body flashed and he charged toward the Yan Kong Saint son.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying fist force crushed toward the Yan Kong Saint son. Although the Yan Kong Saint son tried his best to block it, the difference between him and the Supreme Saint son was too great. He spat out a mouthful of blood and was sent flying. He was severely injured.</p><p>The Saint son Yan Kong had been defeated.</p><p>“Song of the green Lotus sword, sword shaking the world.”</p><p>die! Ouyang Qingxiang shouted, and the dazzling sword light sent Holy maiden Xue Tan flying.</p><p>Holy maiden Xue Tan had been defeated.</p><p>All of a sudden, only Saint son Zhi Xia was left on the sacred son’s side. He was struggling to hold on in Lu Ming’s hands, but his defeat was only a matter of time.</p><p>The Supreme Holy son’s gaze swept across Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang, and a sinister look suddenly flashed in his eyes. His body turned into a golden light and rushed toward Lu Ming, then he threw a punch at him.</p><p>The Supreme Holy Son had suddenly launched a sneak attack on Lu Ming. Furthermore, his first move was a killing move.</p><p>If Lu Ming was hit by this move, he would at least be seriously injured or even crippled.</p><p>The Supreme Holy Son was still extremely afraid of Lu Ming.</p><p>In his opinion, although Lu Ming’s current ability was not as good as his, the speed of his improvement was too fast. At this rate, it would not be long before Lu Ming surpassed him.</p><p>The reason why Supreme move and the others had called for this meeting in advance to decide on the zongzi position was entirely because they were afraid of Lu Ming.</p><p>They were afraid that Lu Ming would surpass the Supreme Holy Son in the future.</p><p>This feeling made the Supreme Holy Son extremely uncomfortable.</p><p>In the past, he had always been high and mighty, suppressing the other Holy Sons and Holy daughters. The other Holy Sons and holy virgins seemed to be just a foil to his existence.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s radiance was about to surpass his. This made him extremely jealous of Lu Ming.</p><p>He would not allow any heaven’s pride expert to be stronger than him to exist in the Kong Xuan sect, nor would he allow anyone to be more talented than him. If there were, he would get rid of them.</p><p>Therefore, the Supreme Holy Son seized the opportunity to attack Lu Ming and cripple him in one move.</p><p>“Paragon universe, you’re despicable!”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang shouted. Lu Ming was still fighting with the Saint son Zhi Xia. They had not completely defeated the Saint son, but the Supreme Saint had already attacked Lu Ming. He was simply despicable.</p><p>At this moment, Ouyang Qingxiang attacked without thinking. She used all her strength and turned into a beam of sword light. She appeared between Lu Ming and the Supreme Saint. Then, she used the rest of her strength to set up a layer of defense.</p><p>However, at the crucial moment, Ouyang Qingxiang did not gather much power. How could she block the Supreme saint’s attack?</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Supreme Holy son’s golden fist force landed on Ouyang Qingxiang’s body and broke through her defenses. The violent force landed heavily on her body.</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang was sent flying, and her blood splattered in the air.</p><p>“Fragrant!”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang’s grandfather caught her, and his powerful divine power continuously flowed into her body.</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang’s face was deathly pale, and it was obvious that she was severely injured.</p><p>“Supreme universe …”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted in anger. The divine power that exploded was stronger. The Spear’s light was like a mountain, shaking the sky and earth. It whipped Saint son Zhi Xia’s body and sent him flying off the fighting ring.</p><p>In this way, the sacred son of reflection and the other three were all defeated, leaving only three people in Lu Ming’s group.</p><p>There were still four Supreme Holy Sons.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming held the long spear in his hand, his fighting spirit soaring to the heavens. His cold killing intent erupted without any restraint.</p><p>“Despicable!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>The Supreme Holy Son snorted coldly and stared at Lu Ming with an unfriendly look.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The Supreme Holy son’s three subordinates appeared beside him and stood in a line.</p><p>Kang Chong and Liu Jie appeared beside Lu Ming, glaring at the Supreme Holy Son.</p><p>“The situation has been settled.”</p><p>One of the elders shook his head.</p><p>it seems like the Supreme Saint will definitely win this time. There’s no more suspense.</p><p>the Supreme Holy Son will become a zongzi. This is completely within my expectations.</p><p>“It’s a good thing I’ve already joined the Supreme Holy Son, haha!”</p><p>The scene was noisy. Some people were happy, while others were sad.</p><p>The other Holy Sons and holy virgins ‘factions all had unsightly expressions, while those from the Supreme Holy son’s faction were ecstatic.</p><p>They all thought that the situation was already set.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two were the only ones left. They were no match for the Supreme Holy Son.</p><p>“Lu Ming, do you still want to continue fighting? I think you’d better get out of the fighting ring on your own, or I’ll have to make a move.”</p><p>The Supreme Holy Son said coldly, looking at Lu Ming with disdain.</p><p>I’ll get off the fighting stage as well. However, I’ll make you kneel in front of me before I get off the fighting stage.</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“You want me to kneel before you? Hahaha!”</p><p>The Supreme Holy Son laughed crazily. After a few laughs, his expression changed to one of ferocity.</p><p>originally, I could have let you off if you rolled off the fighting ring yourself. But I’ve changed my mind. I want you to kneel in front of me and lick my shoes.</p><p>The Supreme Holy Son said coldly, and the aura on his body became even more violent.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The Supreme Holy Son walked out step by step. His entire body was covered in golden divine power, looking extraordinary and mighty.</p><p>The violent aura kept pressing down on Lu Ming and the other two. With every step he took, his aura grew stronger.</p><p>Lu Ming stood there unmoving. However, Kang Chong and Liu Jie could not resist and retreated continuously.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
