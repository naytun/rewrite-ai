The few godkings could no longer remain calm.</p><p>There were still many disciples in their base. If the demons broke through, it would be a huge loss.</p><p>“Damn it, go back, go back to the base!”</p><p>The Godking of the unique devil Academy roared.</p><p>At this moment, he could not be bothered to take down Lu Ming.</p><p>On Lu Ming’s side, there was Wu Wei and the ice Soul race’s Godking. Even if they included the Scarlet Flame race’s Godking, there were three of them. If Wu Wei and the ice Soul race’s Godking were to stop them with all their might, they would not be able to take down Lu Ming in a short time.</p><p>If that was the case, their base would be in danger.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The God King of the eternal sword sect roared in anger. Even though he was unwilling, he could only return to the base first.</p><p>In the Yimo Academy, the Godking of the indestructible sword sect led the experts of the two sects and flew toward their respective bases. In the blink of an eye, they disappeared.</p><p>“Come, let’s go back too.”</p><p>run! Wuwei shouted. A large number of demons appeared outside the base of the Kong Xuan sect. He led the people of the Kong Xuan sect and rushed back to the base.</p><p>The Godking of the Scarlet Flame race, on the other hand, disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Only the ice Soul Clan was left.</p><p>Lu Ming did not return to Kong Xuan sect. He planned to stay in the ice Soul Clan for the time being.</p><p>The ice Soul Clan members outside rushed into the ice Soul clan’s base.</p><p>“Pay attention to the defense!”</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s Godking ordered loudly.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>Dense runes appeared on the wall of the ice Soul clan’s base, and a defensive formation emerged.</p><p>Roar Roar Roar …</p><p>The roars became more and more intense, like a group of demons dancing chaotically, tens of thousands of demons roaring in unison, the scene was shocking.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Countless demons and devils were either running on the ground or flying in the sky, rushing over.</p><p>“So many …”</p><p>When the ice Soul Clan saw this, their expressions changed drastically.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression turned grave.</p><p>There were too many demons and the number of powerful demons inside was also shocking.</p><p>It would be difficult for the ice Soul Clan to stop so many demons with their current manpower.</p><p>Fortunately, they had a God King expert and a God King to guard them, so they were as safe as a fortress.</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s Divine King was not in the array. He was standing outside the base.</p><p>“Ice-sealing world!”</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s Godking shouted coldly. A terrifying chill emanated from his body as he struck out with his palm.</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>A terrifying cold wave spread towards the group of demons.</p><p>Instantly, the ground and the sky were completely frozen.</p><p>Endless ice appeared, and countless demons were frozen into ice.</p><p>Regardless of whether they were true God Realm or heavenly God Realm demons, they were all frozen into ice.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The demons flying in the sky fell to the ground and shattered into pieces after they were frozen into ice.</p><p>At least tens of thousands of demons were killed in an instant.</p><p>“What a terrifying strength. Is this the strength of a God King?”</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely shocked.</p><p>His current combat strength was already considered not bad. He could easily kill an ordinary first-level celestial deity. He could even fight a second-level celestial deity.</p><p>And QiuQiu was even an existence that could easily kill a third level celestial deity.</p><p>However, compared to a God King, he was much weaker.</p><p>“Ignorant and ignorant, ignorant and ignorant, What is this? Back then, I saw with my own eyes how an expert controlled the ancient word ‘ice’ and froze a River of Stars in one move. That’s what I call amazing.”</p><p>The disdainful voice of the ” quantity ” formula sounded.</p><p>freezing a Galaxy with one move? you’re bragging.</p><p>Lu Ming did not believe it at all.</p><p>A Galaxy was extremely vast, boundless, and had an infinite distance.</p><p>How was it possible to freeze an entire Galaxy with one move? Was there such a powerful existence in this world? Lu Ming would not believe it even if he was beaten to death. He thought that the quantity formula was bragging.</p><p>“That’s why I say you’re ignorant.”</p><p>The quantity formula said disdainfully.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The ice Soul Clan cheered loudly.</p><p>The Godking had killed tens of thousands of demons with a single strike. They could finally relax. With the Godking here, he alone could stop the demons.</p><p>No matter how many demons there were, he was not afraid.</p><p>However, no one noticed that the ice Soul clan’s Godking’s expression had turned grave as he looked into the distance.</p><p>“Outsiders, kill!”</p><p>A roar came from the sky in the distance. This roar caused the entire world to shake.</p><p>In the ice Soul clan’s base, some of the weaker cultivators were still trembling violently despite the protection of the formation. They spat out a mouthful of blood and their faces turned pale.</p><p>Everyone saw a figure appear at the end of the world.</p><p>It was a human-shaped living being. It looked very similar to humans, but it was a hundred meters tall. Its body was covered in a layer of orange scales, and it held a huge Wolf-tooth club in its hand.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>This creature was running in the void at an extremely fast speed. Every step it took caused the void to shake.</p><p>“This is … A God King!”</p><p>“It’s the Godking!”</p><p>Many people exclaimed.</p><p>The aura of this living being was too terrifying. It was clearly a Divine King.</p><p>The living being charged at the ice Soul race’s Godking.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s Godking shouted and charged at his opponent.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two sides clashed, and half of the sky was covered in ice.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The creature and the ice Soul clan’s Divine King were both pushed back.</p><p>This move was evenly matched.</p><p>“How can he be so strong?”</p><p>Many of the ice Soul clan’s members were shocked.</p><p>It should be known that the godkings of the various forces that entered the ancient God World this time were all outstanding figures among the godkings. They were existences with extremely powerful battle prowess and could easily suppress godkings of the same level.</p><p>However, that creature was able to fight against the ice Soul race’s Godking. Could it be that his level was much higher than the ice Soul race’s Godking?</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The creature and the ice Soul race’s Godking shouted at the same time and started fighting again.</p><p>The two of them fought fiercely in the sky. The void was shaking as if two stars were colliding. It was difficult to determine the winner in a short time.</p><p>Roar! Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>The demons, on the other hand, were rushing toward the ice Soul clan’s base.</p><p>These demons had different appearances, and their bodies were filled with demonic Qi and fiendish Qi, which made people’s hearts palpitate.</p><p>“Attack and kill these demons!”</p><p>Someone roared.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>In the ice Soul clan’s base, the ice Soul clan’s experts made their move. One attack after another flew out.</p><p>The temperature of the area began to drop rapidly.</p><p>On the ground and in the sky, ice kept appearing.</p><p>Many demons were frozen in ice.</p><p>However, there were too many of them. Some of the more powerful demons shook their bodies and the ice on their bodies was shaken off.</p><p>Some demons were killed, but more demons rushed over and attacked the array of the ice Soul clan’s base.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The formation began to shake violently.</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s base was only a temporary one. The formation was also a temporary one, so its power was naturally limited. It could not withstand the endless attacks of the demons.</p><p>The formation kept shaking as if it was going to collapse at any moment.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
