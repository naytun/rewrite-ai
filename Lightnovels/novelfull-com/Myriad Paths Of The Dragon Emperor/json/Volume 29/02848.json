This purple copper coffin is amazing!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed and his eyes lit up.</p><p>The material of this purple copper coffin was definitely extraordinary, and it was probably even better than the bronze door.</p><p>“Who is buried in this purple copper coffin? Could it be an ancient God?”</p><p>Lu Ming started to think.</p><p>However, there was no answer.</p><p>I don’t care. Since I’ve encountered it, I’ll take it away first and slowly study it in the future.</p><p>Lu Ming made his decision.</p><p>Cultivators went against the will of the heavens. There was nothing to be afraid of. Since it was a treasure, they could not miss it.</p><p>Lu Ming tested the coffin. There was no danger in it. He was relieved. He hugged the purple bronze coffin with both hands, wanting to grab it and put it into his storage ring.</p><p>However, it did not move at all!</p><p>Lu Ming could not carry her.</p><p>Lu Ming maintained his ancient God Body. He was so powerful that he could even lift a mountain range in the desolate universe, let alone a bronze coffin.</p><p>However, Lu Ming used all his strength but he could not carry her.</p><p>“I’ll just store it in my storage ring!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and took out a storage ring. A strong suction force appeared and enveloped the purple bronze coffin.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The purple copper coffin was indeed sucked into the storage ring.</p><p>It was a success!</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>However, before he could even celebrate, the storage ring actually emitted a “ka Cha ka Cha” sound. Lines of cracks appeared on it, and then with a bang, the entire storage ring exploded.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The purple copper coffin landed on the bottom of the lake again, causing the lake to shake violently.</p><p>“Press … He crushed the storage ring?”</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p><p>Back then, when Lu Ming obtained that ball of icy liquid, the icy liquid relied on the power of extreme frost to freeze the storage ring and shatter it.</p><p>And now, the weight of the purple copper coffin had crushed a storage ring.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless.</p><p>However, this was also the reason why the storage ring that Lu Ming controlled was not of a high enough level. If he used the storage ring that the king of gods used, it might be able to store it.</p><p>The key was that Lu Ming did not have such a high-level storage ring.</p><p>“What do we do? Can’t you take it with you?”</p><p>Lu Ming was somewhat speechless.</p><p>Back then, Lu Ming could use the ice chains to refine the cold liquid and take it away. However, he could not refine the purple bronze coffin.</p><p>kid, use this scroll. There’s a space inside this scroll, so it should be able to contain it.</p><p>Bone’s voice was heard.</p><p>“Why didn’t you tell me earlier that the scroll formed a space of its own?”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless.</p><p>“You didn’t ask, so why should I tell you?”</p><p>Bone said in disdain.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming controlled the painting scroll to fly out and roll at the purple copper coffin. As expected, the purple copper coffin was rolled in.</p><p>Lu Ming waited for a while. The painting scroll was safe and sound. There were no problems.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed and kept the painting scroll.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming started to search the bottom of the lake.</p><p>Another hour passed.</p><p>“I found it!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He finally saw a bronze altar.</p><p>It was an altar that was as tall as a human and made of bronze. The material was very similar to that of the bronze door. However, it looked very ancient and seemed to have no spirituality at all.</p><p>the first clan master said that the ancient God Body can break the altar and release the ancient God’s soul. I don’t know if it’s true, but let’s try!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered, then he stepped forward and punched the altar.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The altar trembled and runes appeared on it. These runes interwove to form an array. However, this array did not stop Lu Ming at all. Lu Ming’s fist went through the array and hit the altar.</p><p>“It’s effective!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>He guessed that if it wasn’t for the ancient God, it would have been blocked by the formation. However, it was fine for the descendants of the ancient God.</p><p>Or, it could be someone with a rich ancient God bloodline. The array would not be able to withstand it.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming continued to punch, his huge fists bombarding the altar.</p><p>The altar shook continuously, and not long after, a cracking sound came from the altar.</p><p>Lu Ming saw that there was a crack on it.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>a roar suddenly came from the altar, and a thick ancient God energy came out of the crack.</p><p>it really is the soul of an ancient God. Continue …</p><p>Lu Ming continued to bombard the altar. Finally, the altar exploded with a bang.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>” arghh!   a heaven-shaking roar rang out, and at the same time, an extremely powerful energy shot up into the sky.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming saw a huge figure appear in the sky.</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>This figure was too huge. Just its feet were taller than the eight thousand meters of lake water. The lake water in the entire Lake was stirred up and filled the sky before it disappeared. Lu Ming discovered that he had appeared in a huge pit.</p><p>Between heaven and earth, an ancient God stood.</p><p>It really was an ancient God. This ancient God was indomitable and was at least a million meters tall. His entire body was covered in pitch-black scales.</p><p>“This … Was this the soul of an ancient God? It’s too big, my God.”</p><p>Lu Ming gasped.</p><p>kid, you really haven’t seen the world. This is nothing. Let me tell you, this is just a wisp of an ancient God’s soul. A real ancient God is much bigger than this, much, much bigger, do you understand? ”</p><p>The quantity formula was good at seizing the opportunity to mock Lu Ming.</p><p>“How big?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked instinctively.</p><p>your life planet must be huge. The fist of the ancient God I’ve seen was bigger than your life planet.</p><p>The quantum technique said.</p><p>“A fist is bigger than a life planet?”</p><p>Lu Ming was really speechless. That was too terrifying. He was afraid that one punch would cause a star to explode.</p><p>And this incomparably huge ancient God in front of him was actually just a wisp of an ancient God’s remnant soul.</p><p>“Why are his scales black?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>According to the ancient God tactic, the highest level of cultivation should be purple scales.</p><p>However, the scales on the surface of the ancient God’s remnant soul were black.</p><p>that’s normal. This is the original color of the ancient God. You have cultivated the ancient God’s tactic to the point of purple scales, but you are far from reaching the peak. When you reach the peak, you will be black. However, the power at that time, tsk tsk, is amazing.</p><p>The quantity formula said.</p><p>“So purple scales aren’t the highest level.”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a look of anticipation.</p><p>If he cultivated the ancient God tactic to the highest level and his scales turned black, would he have the power of an ancient God?</p><p>To be able to destroy a star with a single punch, that kind of strength was truly terrifying.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The ancient God’s soul roared, shaking the heavens and earth. The entire world was shaking.</p><p>Then, the ancient God’s soul stepped out, and the world rumbled as he walked toward the first tribe.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
