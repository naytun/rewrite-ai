The geniuses of the Qin heaven thirteen clans had all arrived.</p><p>Among them, the three Overlord forces-the unique demon Academy, the indestructible sword sect, and the boundless Holy Land-had the most people. All of them had thick auras, and their eyes were filled with powerful Qi dynamic.</p><p>It was obvious that they were all experts, all at the level of Saints.</p><p>However, some sects were much more humble. Although there were many people, and some sects even had more people than the Kong Xuan sect, there were very few Holy Sons. Some forces only had one or two. The others were not Holy Sons at all. They were far worse than them.</p><p>The geniuses of qintian No. 13 were all sizing each other up.</p><p>Supreme universe master, I heard that you were defeated during the zongzi competition in the Kong Xuan sect. Hahaha, you’re really trash.</p><p>At this time, a loud laughter was heard from the unique devil Academy.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest looked in the direction of the voice.</p><p>“Eh? A member of the multi-eyed race!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>The person who had just spoken had four eyes on his face. There were two eyes on each side of his face, and all four eyes were shining with a cold light.</p><p>This was the multi-eyed race, also known as the four-eyed race.</p><p>Like the three-eyed race, they were a multi-eyed race.</p><p>“Four eyes void court, what did you say?”</p><p>The Supreme Holy son’s expression was extremely cold as he stared at this person.</p><p>This person’s name was four eyes void court.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Did I say something wrong? I heard that you were even defeated by a new disciple of your Kong Xuan sect. If you’re not trash, what are you? To think that you used to be as famous as me, how disgusting!”</p><p>Four-eyed Kong ting sneered, his face full of disdain.</p><p>“Hahaha, four eyes void court, you’re right!”</p><p>“Supreme universe, you’re really trash!”</p><p>Someone from the indestructible sword sect and the boundless Holy Land also sneered.</p><p>This made the Supreme Holy son’s face turn even uglier and gloomier.</p><p>“Lu Ming …”</p><p>The Supreme Saint roared in his heart. This was a great humiliation to him, and he blamed it on Lu Ming.</p><p>It was all Lu Ming’s fault. If not for Lu Ming, he would not have suffered such humiliation.</p><p>Lu Ming, there are some people in the three forces that you have to be careful of. That four-eye Kongtong is as famous as the Supreme Holy Son. He’s extremely talented and powerful. I’m afraid he’s even stronger than the Supreme Holy Son.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>there are also people like that in the indestructible sword sect and the boundless Holy Land. They’re all extremely terrifying!</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang continued to send Lu Ming a voice transmission.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. I heard that there are divine sons in the three Overlord forces. Where are their divine sons? did they not come? ” he asked.</p><p>“They’re all here!”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang said, ” did you see that cold-looking bald young man in the unique demon Academy? that’s the divine Son of the unique demon Academy, mo jiuye!</p><p>Lu Ming looked in the direction that Ouyang Qingxiang was pointing at. As expected, he saw a bald young man among the crowd from the unique demon Academy.</p><p>This person had an ordinary appearance and his aura was restrained. He was easily overlooked in the crowd. Lu Ming had not paid much attention to this person before.</p><p>He did not expect that this person was the divine Son of the unique devil Academy, a peerless genius who controlled divine-grade divine power.</p><p>As if sensing Lu Ming’s gaze, mo jiuye’s gaze turned to Lu Ming as well. A dark demonic light flashed in his eyes and shot towards Lu Ming like a blade.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed and he felt a sharp pain in his eyes. He quickly circulated his energy to resist it.</p><p>“This person is very terrifying!”</p><p>Lu Ming came to a conclusion in his heart.</p><p>Mo jiuye stared at Lu Ming with a cold glint in his eyes. A cold smile appeared on his face. His lips moved slightly and a voice suddenly rang in Lu Ming’s ears.</p><p>Lu Ming, you killed the Holy Son of my unique devil Academy in the ancient God World. This is a great crime, and I will make you pay with your life.</p><p>Mo jiuye’s voice was cold and emotionless, filled with a terrifying killing intent.</p><p>“You want to kill me? I’m afraid you don’t have the ability!”</p><p>Lu Ming responded strongly.</p><p>hehe, you’re very confident. Just wait and see!</p><p>Mo jiuye said coldly and did not continue.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang did not know that Lu Ming and Mo jiuye had already conversed in secret and continued to introduce them to Lu Ming.</p><p>the white-robed young man with the longsword on his back is the divine Son of the eternal sword sect. His sword Dao is boundless, and the longsword in his hand is terrifying to the extreme!</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang said.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze shifted from mo jiuye to a young man in white from the eternal sword sect.</p><p>This man was called Wuji Kendo. He was extremely handsome and exuded a terrifying sword intent that was impossible to ignore.</p><p>Another terrifying heaven’s favorite!</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>Sword Dao infinitum’s gaze also turned to Lu Ming. A cold smile appeared at the corner of his mouth. His eyes flickered like two divine swords, exuding a terrifying sword intent.</p><p>Even the other paragons of the indestructible sword sect standing beside him were shocked. They all moved away from him to avoid being hurt by his sword will.</p><p>the burly young man in fiery red armor from the boundless sacred land is called cangyan pojun. He’s the deity of the boundless sacred land!</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang introduced.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze looked over again.</p><p>It was a young man who was almost three meters tall. He was unusually burly and wore a thick, fiery red armor, giving off a strong sense of oppression.</p><p>The pressure he gave off was not any weaker than mo jiuye’S. He was also a terrifying heaven’s favorite.</p><p>Lu Ming took note of the three people.</p><p>Many geniuses from the Qin heaven thirteen clans came. However, only these three people made Lu Ming feel threatened. He didn’t care about the others.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Just as everyone was sizing each other up, the explosions in front of them became even more intense. They could see that around the Galaxy, circles of dazzling light were constantly shining, blocking the terrifying attacks.</p><p>After a while, the attacks stopped. Then, streams of light flew over.</p><p>The sect heads of the Qin heavenly thirteen clans and the other Godking experts had returned after breaking the formation.</p><p>The next moment, five figures appeared in front of Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>The leader of the group was the sect leader of the Kong Xuan sect, dragon boats.</p><p>The other four were all founding members of the Kong Xuan sect, godkings.</p><p>The auras of the five people from Dragon Boat Mountain were all fluctuating. It was obvious that they had used up a lot of their energy to break the formation.</p><p>“How is it, sect master? You still can’t break it?”</p><p>Grand Elder fan said.</p><p>“I can’t break it!”</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain shook his head. Then, his gaze fell on Lu Ming and the rest.”Next, I’ll have to rely on you guys!”</p><p>don’t worry, sect master. I’ll do my best to help you get the star core!</p><p>The Supreme Saint hurriedly said.</p><p>there’s no need for you to obtain the core of a star. With your cultivation, you won’t be able to obtain a star core. According to the speculation of a few formation Masters, there should be some formation plates in this Galaxy!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
