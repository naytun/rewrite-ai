Lu Ming could feel that his divine energy had become much purer.</p><p>Of course, there was still a long way to go before he could reach the celestial deity realm.</p><p>“What a rich and powerful energy …”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>of course. After I absorb it, I can use it 100%. Others can only absorb half of it at most!</p><p>The quantity word formula said proudly.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. Without further ado, he waved his long spear and killed another large bird. He then continued to absorb energy.</p><p>At this moment, Ouyang Qingxiang had also killed a Big Bird and absorbed its energy. The divine power in her body had also become stronger.</p><p>Killing these birds to cultivate would be many times faster than cultivating normally.</p><p>On the other side, four eyes void court, Zhuo Wu fa and the others were also increasing their speed, killing the giant bird and absorbing its energy.</p><p>After they finished absorbing the energy, they continued to move forward.</p><p>After Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang finished off a few big birds, they also went forward.</p><p>As they went deeper, the number of giant birds that appeared increased.</p><p>They knew that the star core fragment must be right in front of them.</p><p>Although the giant bird was quite powerful, it was still being hunted down by experts like Lu Ming, four eyes void court, and Zhuo Buzhu.</p><p>The giant birds were killed one after another as Lu Ming continued to venture deeper.</p><p>Gah gah gah …</p><p>Suddenly, a series of ear-piercing sounds came from the front.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were shocked as they looked ahead in a daze.</p><p>There was a huge Canyon ahead, but at the mouth of the canyon and above the canyon, there were countless large birds flying.</p><p>At a glance, there were no less than a thousand of them, covering the sky and blocking out the light in this area.</p><p>“So many …”</p><p>Someone said in a hoarse voice.</p><p>Experts like Lu Ming, four-eyed void court, and Zhuo Buzhu naturally did not care about such a huge bird alone. However, if so many of them attacked together, even they would find it difficult to deal with.</p><p>“The star core fragment must be in this Canyon!”</p><p>Greed appeared in the four-eyed King Kong’s eyes.</p><p>“What should we do? there are so many big birds. How can we enter?”</p><p>Zhuo Buzhu muttered, his mind constantly turning, trying to think of a way to get rid of the others and also to take the star core fragment for himself.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I have a way to help you get in.”</p><p>At this moment, the ” quantity ” formula spoke again.</p><p>“You have a way? What is it?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he conversed with the quantity formula secretly.</p><p>these big birds are formed from the energy leaking out of the star core fragments. They don’t seem to have any intelligence and only have a kind of instinct.</p><p>as for me, I’m the ancient word ‘quantity’. It’s the origin of all energy and can devour all energy. As long as you release your aura, those birds made of energy won’t dare to approach you.</p><p>The quantity formula said.</p><p>“It’s that simple?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>“It’s that simple!”</p><p>The ” quantity ” formula said as if it could cut through gold and iron.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded secretly. He already had an idea.</p><p>four eyes in the empty courtyard. It seems like we can only charge in if we work together.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming spoke to four-eye void court and Zhuo Budong.</p><p>“Join hands?”</p><p>Four-eyed kongting and motionless desk’s eyes flashed.</p><p>that’s right. Let’s work together. After we get in, we’ll each use our own abilities to get the star core fragment.</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright, I agree!”</p><p>“I also agree!”</p><p>Four eyes void court and Zhuo Wu fa both nodded.</p><p>After making up their minds, they prepared to attack.</p><p>Qingxiang, wait a moment. You have to follow me closely.</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Ouyang Qingxiang.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang nodded silently and followed closely behind Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming shouted and dashed toward the flock of birds at the entrance of the canyon.</p><p>At the same time, Zhuo bumu also led his people towards the canyon.</p><p>Gah gah gah …</p><p>As soon as they moved, the giant birds noticed them and moved as well. They let out sharp cries and pounced on Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and waved his long spear, killing the big birds.</p><p>Four eyes void court, Zhuo Buzhu and the others also attacked with all their might, killing those giant birds. However, there were too many giant birds, and it was easier said than done to charge in.</p><p>However, because of this, Zhuo bumu and four eye kongting also attracted a large number of giant birds.</p><p>“Old Liang, now!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a message to the quantity formula.</p><p>“Watch this old lady!”</p><p>The voice of the ” measure ” formula was heard. At the same time, the entire body of the ” measure ” formula glowed. A mysterious aura was emitted and enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>At first, a few large birds were pouncing on Lu Ming. However, they suddenly sensed the aura of the ” measure ” formula. Their eyes were filled with fear and they immediately flew away from Lu Ming.</p><p>it’s really effective. Qingxiang, follow me!</p><p>Lu Ming pulled Ouyang Qingxiang’s hand. The aura of the measure formula followed her hand and covered her entire body. The surrounding big birds also directly bypassed Ouyang Qingxiang and did not pounce on her.</p><p>When Lu Ming held her hand, Ouyang Qingxiang’s delicate body began to tremble and her face turned red. However, the next moment, her beautiful eyes revealed a look of surprise.</p><p>Because she realized that those big birds actually didn’t pounce towards her. They directly bypassed her and pounced towards four eyes void court and Zhuo Buzhu.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang was extremely shocked. She knew that all of this was because of Lu Ming. Her curiosity about him grew.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming held Ouyang Qingxiang’s hand and rushed into the canyon. Not a single big Bird stopped him.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>Four eyes void court, Zhuo Buzhu and the rest also discovered Lu Ming’s strange behavior. It was simply unbelievable and they roared in anger.</p><p>“Lu Ming, stop right there!”</p><p>“You dare to trick me!”</p><p>Four eyes void court and Zhuo Buba roared, their killing intent as cold as a knife.</p><p>“You guys have fun, I’m not going to keep you company!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled indifferently and continued to rush forward with Ouyang Qingxiang. In the blink of an eye, they disappeared from the sight of four-eye void courtyard and the others.</p><p>Four eyes void court and Zhuo Buba roared in anger, their killing intent was as cold as a blade, but they were helpless.</p><p>let’s not fight with these giant birds and conserve our strength. We’ll surround the area and wait for Lu Ming to come out. It’ll be his time of death!</p><p>Four-eyed Kong ting said coldly.</p><p>that’s right. That brat dared to trick me. He’s simply courting death!</p><p>Zhuo Wudi’s voice was also extremely cold.</p><p>Immediately, they stopped fighting with the giant birds and retreated. After they had retreated a certain distance, the giant birds stopped chasing them and flew back to the canyon.</p><p>Four eyes void court and Zhuo Buzhu led people to guard not far away. They were waiting for Lu Ming to come out and then kill him.</p><p>After Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang barged into the flock of big birds, their field of vision suddenly widened.</p><p>There was no big Bird in the canyon. Those big birds were just circling the mouth of the canyon and above it.</p><p>The moment Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang entered, their gazes were deeply attracted.</p><p>There was a ball of light floating in the air above the valley, emitting a dazzling light.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
