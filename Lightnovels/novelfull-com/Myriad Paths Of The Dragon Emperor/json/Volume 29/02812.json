They had just entered and the spatial path had already collapsed. If it had collapsed a bit earlier, they would not have been able to enter.</p><p>“Everyone, don’t panic. There are many godkings and formation Masters outside. They’ll definitely think of a way to reopen the spatial path.”</p><p>An old man shouted.</p><p>Some of the elders who had lived for countless years had experienced great storms and waves, so they quickly calmed down.</p><p>Hearing this, many people calmed down.</p><p>Indeed, there were still many God King experts and array Masters outside. They would definitely not let so many people be trapped here. They would definitely think of a way to reopen the door.</p><p>Holy maiden Qingxiang, Holy Son Lu Ming, now that the spatial gate has collapsed, there’s no point in guarding here. Why don’t we go to the base first? I need to report the situation here to the divine King at the base.</p><p>The inner sect elder said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang both nodded.</p><p>Since the space gate had collapsed, they could only stay in this world and cultivate for a while.</p><p>The people from the other sects and powers had similar thoughts. They left some people to guard this place while the others flew toward their respective bases.</p><p>When the spatial path had collapsed, the bronze gate of the ancient God Star had also undergone a major change.</p><p>The bronze door that was originally open suddenly emitted a bright radiance and slowly closed.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>“Quickly stop him!”</p><p>There were at least a few dozen divine kings around the bronze door. They were all shocked and struck at the door with terrifying energy, trying to stop the door from closing.</p><p>However, it was of no use. The bronze door continued to close at a constant speed.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>In the end, the bronze door was completely shut.</p><p>“Master, what’s going on?”</p><p>A Godking from the unique demon Academy looked at a formation master with a gloomy expression.</p><p>The formation master furrowed his brows as he pondered. After a while, he shook his head and said,”Strange, strange, I don’t know what’s going on either.”</p><p>“I wonder what’s going on?”</p><p>The expressions of the other godkings all changed.</p><p>Many people from the major powers had entered the bronze gate, including some of the top geniuses. If these people couldn’t come out, it would be a fatal loss to the major powers.</p><p>“The only thing we can do now is to continue studying and think of a way to open the door again.”</p><p>The other formation master also said helplessly.</p><p>“Then I’ll have to trouble everyone!”</p><p>A Godking expert said.</p><p>Immediately, a few formation Masters began to study it carefully. After a long time, one of the formation Masters said with a serious expression, ” “This formation has become even stronger after it was shut down. I’m afraid it’ll take even longer to open it.”</p><p>“How much time do you need?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>“A few decades at least, a few hundred years at most.”</p><p>A formation master said.</p><p>“Several hundred years? that’s fine!”</p><p>“Then I’ll have to trouble the Masters to break it!”</p><p>The various godkings nodded their heads. It would take a few hundred years to open it, so the situation wasn’t too bad.</p><p>……</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming, Ouyang Qingxiang, and the rest followed the inner sect elder of the Kong Xuan sect and flew for a distance before a huge city appeared in front of them.</p><p>This city was built between two great ravines, leaning against a natural barrier, looking extremely majestic.</p><p>This was the new base that the Kong Xuan sect had built recently.</p><p>Those from the Kong Xuan sect who had entered this world were all gathered in this base.</p><p>The group flew in and saw stone houses in the city.</p><p>“You guys can go and find an open space and build your own stone houses. Also, you can enter and leave the city freely. There is no one to restrict you. However, the demons outside are very strange and powerful. You have to be careful when you go out and risk your lives,”</p><p>The inner court elder warned, and after that, the inner court elder flew away.</p><p>Lu Ming, Ouyang Qingxiang, and the rest swept their gazes across the area before flying toward an empty space.</p><p>This city was extremely large, and there were large areas of empty land.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Suddenly, an explosive roar filled with cold killing intent was heard.</p><p>At the side, a group of figures flew out from a stone house and blocked Lu Ming and the rest’s way.</p><p>“Tian Hong!”</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes. The person in the lead was the Tianhong Saint son.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son looked at Lu Ming with a ferocious gaze and sneered. you’ve also come to the world of ancient gods. Good, very good. Let’s see who can protect you here.</p><p>Tianhong, don’t think too highly of yourself. If you want to fight, we’re not afraid of you.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang sneered.</p><p>“Oh, what if I’m included?”</p><p>A cold voice came from behind. Then, another group of people flew over.</p><p>“Floating light!”</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang’s expression changed.</p><p>The group of people behind him was the sacred son of reflection and his subordinates.</p><p>They had surrounded Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Floating light, when did you join forces with Tian Hong?”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang said coldly.</p><p>I can’t say that we’re working together. However, Lu Ming has killed many of my men. I’m just going to settle this score with him.</p><p>The sacred son sneered, and cold killing intent spread out.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son and the transient light Saint son surrounded Lu Ming and the others. Their cold killing intent made many people’s expressions change.</p><p>However, Ouyang Qingxiang remained calm because she knew of a rule.</p><p>“You dare to make a move here? According to what I know, the Godking has given the order that fighting is prohibited in this city to prevent demons from taking advantage of the situation. Do you dare to disobey the Godking’s order?”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang sneered.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son and the transient light Saint son’s faces darkened.</p><p>The Godking who was guarding the city had indeed given this order.</p><p>And they did not dare to disobey.</p><p>“Hmph, so what if it’s like this? Once you leave this city, no one will care about you, unless you stay in this city forever and never go out.”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son sneered.</p><p>that’s right. I’ll send people to keep an eye on you. Since you’ve come here, you’ll be holed up in this city forever!</p><p>The Gu Guang Holy Son sneered.</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang’s expression turned ugly.</p><p>Coming to this world, of course, he had to go out and adventure to obtain the natural treasures outside. Otherwise, what was he doing here?</p><p>Instead of staying in this city, he might as well stay in the Kong Xuan sect and cultivate.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son and the transient light Saint son smiled delightedly when they saw Ouyang Qingxiang’s ugly expression.</p><p>Holy maiden Qingxiang, let’s go. I can’t be bothered with these Mad Dogs.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming spoke indifferently and stepped forward.</p><p>“What did you just say?”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son and the transient light Saint son’s faces turned red.</p><p>“Good dogs don’t block the way.”</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at the Tian Hong Saint son in disdain.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son was so furious that he almost vomited blood. He wanted to slap Lu Ming to death.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
