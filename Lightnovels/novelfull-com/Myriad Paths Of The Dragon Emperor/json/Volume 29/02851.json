Someone has cultivated the ancient God Body?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>Other than him, there were others who had cultivated the ancient God Body. This was beyond Lu Ming’s expectations.</p><p>that’s right. As far as I know, there are four people who have cultivated the ancient God Body. There is a Divine Son from the indestructible sword sect, a Holy Son from the unique demon Academy, an overwhelming prodigy from the red flame tribe, and my seventh brother!</p><p>Bingqing said.</p><p>” there are four people who have cultivated the ancient God Body.</p><p>Lu Ming was also secretly amazed.</p><p>Lu Ming was well aware of the difficulty of condensing an ancient God Body. Even he himself had to go through a series of coincidences, with the help of the quantity formula and the bone demon before he could finally condense it successfully.</p><p>the fact that the four of them had been able to form an ancient God Body meant that they were the cream of the crop in terms of talent, luck, and opportunity.</p><p>From their names, one could tell that the two people who had condensed an ancient God Body, the unique devil Academy and the indestructible sword sect, were both at the level of a Divine Son. Those who could be called divine sons were people who had mastered divine grade divine power.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming secretly heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>Since other people could condense an ancient God Body, he would have no qualms about using an ancient God Body in the future.</p><p>If others could practice it, he could naturally practice it too.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, cheers came from the ice Soul clan’s base.</p><p>Then, a few figures flew rapidly towards Bing Qing and Lu Ming.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Bing Qing asked.</p><p>ninth young lord, good news. The gate has opened and the exit has appeared. We can go out now.</p><p>One of them said with joy.</p><p>“The gate is open!”</p><p>Bing Qing’s eyes lit up and she was also overjoyed.</p><p>that’s right. We just received news that the gate has been opened. Many forces are heading towards the gate.</p><p>One of them reported.</p><p>“Let’s go. We’re going out too.”</p><p>Bing Qing quickly said.</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s Divine King had already ordered everyone to leave.</p><p>The ice Soul Clan members flew toward the exit like locusts.</p><p>In this world, he had stayed for decades. In these decades, he had been living in fear every day and his life was in danger at all times.</p><p>Especially now that they had been defeated, the descendants of the ancient God could come at any time. Now that the gate was open, everyone was excited and wanted to leave immediately.</p><p>When Lu Ming and the rest arrived, the huge vortex in the sky had reappeared. It was suspended high in the sky and spinning slowly.</p><p>Countless figures flew into the vortex and disappeared.</p><p>In just a short while, more than half of the people had entered the exit.</p><p>“Ouyang Xiangxiang, Yue Linglong …”</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze and saw Ouyang Qingxiang, Yue Linglong, and the others rushing into the vortex.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He was relieved that Ouyang Qingxiang and the rest were fine.</p><p>“Brother Bing, I’ll take my leave first.”</p><p>Lu Ming bade farewell to Bing Qing and soared into the sky. He followed Ouyang Xiangxiang and the rest into the vortex.</p><p>The world spun around him. In the next moment, Lu Ming realized that he had returned to the ancient God Star. Not far away, he flew out of the bronze door.</p><p>“The bronze door!”</p><p>At the sight of the bronze door, Lu Ming was reminded of the purple-copper coffin and the altar that sealed the soul of the ancient God.</p><p>After QiuQiu ate that piece of copper from the altar, it fell into a deep sleep. No one knew when it would wake up.</p><p>However, even if QiuQiu woke up, it wouldn’t be able to eat the bronze door. There were many Divine King experts staring at the bronze door.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>“Saint!”</p><p>At this moment, a few joyful voices were heard. Then, a few figures flew toward Lu Ming.</p><p>They were Ouyang Xiangxiang, Yue Linglong, Wu Zifeng, an hai, Liu Chang, and a few others, but Zhao Feng was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>“It’s great that you’re all fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming also smiled.</p><p>“Saint, it’s a pity that Zhao Feng is dead.”</p><p>Liu Chang sighed.</p><p>“Zhao Feng’s dead? what happened?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked hurriedly.</p><p>An hai, Zhao Feng, and Liu Chang were the first three people from Kong Xuan sect to join Lu Ming. Lu Ming still valued them.</p><p>it’s the Tian Hong Saint son. He killed Zhao Feng. We were defeated by the ancient God race some time ago. We scattered and ran back to the base. When we got close, we ran into the Tian Hong Saint son. He suddenly attacked us and killed Zhao Feng, ” the elder said.</p><p>An hai said angrily.</p><p>“Tian Hong …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s body suddenly exuded a terrifying killing intent.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m sorry. I wanted to stop you but it was too late.”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang said.</p><p>“It’s none of your business!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand. Given the Tian Hong Saint son’s cultivation and combat strength, even Ouyang Qingxiang would find it difficult to stop him if he wanted to kill someone.</p><p>“Tianhong, you’re really looking for death!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes glowed coldly as he asked,”Where is Tianhong?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s body exuded an extremely cold killing intent. Ouyang Xiangxiang, Yue Linglong, and the others could not help but tremble.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t be rash. Even if we look for Tianhong now, we can’t do anything to him.”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang said.</p><p>that’s right, Saint, we have to take revenge for Zhao Feng, but not now!</p><p>An hai also advised.</p><p>“Where is Tianhong?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold as he asked again. His voice was decisive and unquestionable.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son had tried to kill him time and time again, and Lu Ming had wanted to kill him for a long time.</p><p>Now that the Tian Hong Saint son had killed Lu Ming, Lu Ming’s desire to kill the Tian Hong Saint son had reached its peak.</p><p>He was going to take revenge now.</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming’s reaction, an hai and Liu Chang hesitated for a moment before pointing in a direction. I saw the Tian Hong Saint son leading his men that way just now.</p><p>“Very good!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He stepped into the air and headed in that direction.</p><p>“Let’s go, we’ll follow!”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang’s expression changed, and she quickly called a few people to follow.</p><p>In her heart, although Lu Ming’s talent was terrifying, he was definitely not the Tian Hong Saint son’s match now.</p><p>After flying for a while, they arrived at a mountain peak. On this mountain peak, there were some figures, about seven or eight people.</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze around but did not see the Tian Hong Saint son.</p><p>However, these people were all from the Tian Hong Saint son’s faction because Lu Ming had seen a few of them before.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming rushed over directly, his powerful aura pressing down on the mountain peak.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>“It’s Lu Ming!”</p><p>On the mountain peak, those people also saw Lu Ming, and their eyes flickered with killing intent.</p><p>“Tell me, where’s Tianhong?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He stood on the peak of the mountain and interrogated them from a higher position.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re really bold. This is the ancient God Star, not the Kong Xuan sect. How dare you come and look for the Saint?”</p><p>An old man sneered.</p><p>“Let me ask you, where is Tian Hong?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>“Brat, what’s with your attitude? how dare you talk to me like that? get down here and kneel down.”</p><p>die! the old man shouted coldly. His aura surged wildly and condensed into a huge hand that grabbed at Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
