Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming thrust his long spear more than ten times in a row. In an instant, more than a dozen spearlights appeared in the sky like meteors, heading toward the Tian Hong Saint son.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>The spear radiance collided with the Tianhong Saint son’s Dragon Claw. There was a series of clashing sounds, and sparks flew.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two of them exchanged more than a dozen moves.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Following that, a figure retreated rapidly, taking more than a dozen steps back before he could stabilize himself.</p><p>The figure was Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming has retreated. He’s no match for them!</p><p>that’s scary. Lu Ming actually managed to block the Tian Hong Saint son’s attack. Even if he retreated, his strength is still shocking.</p><p>This scene still shocked many people.</p><p>They were not surprised that Lu Ming had retreated, but that he had blocked the Tian Hong Saint son’s attack.</p><p>Many people had imagined that Lu Ming would be killed by the Tian Hong Saint son in seconds.</p><p>no wonder Lu Ming dared to challenge the Tianhong Saint son and have a Deathmatch with him. He’s so powerful. However, he’s still too confident and underestimated the Tianhong Saint son. I don’t think the Tianhong Saint has used his full strength yet.</p><p>“That’s right, the result is already decided!”</p><p>Some of the inner court elders nodded their heads as they evaluated.</p><p>“Lu Ming, is this your ability? You’ve indeed improved a lot, but you still have to die. Kill!”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son shouted coldly and launched a storm of attacks at Lu Ming.</p><p>The Dragon claws on his hands and even the sharp claws on his legs attacked Lu Ming in succession.</p><p>“Break the air, break the air …”</p><p>Lu Ming kept performing the sky-breaking move. Beams of spear radiance burst out and stabbed at the Tian Hong Saint son.</p><p>At the same time, the nine ice chains flew out like nine long snakes. They emitted a shocking coldness and wrapped around the Tian Hong Saint son.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming’s cultivation had advanced to the eighth-stage true God Realm, the power of the ice shackles would naturally be stronger.</p><p>The ninth ice chain, in particular, had a shockingly low temperature. Even the Tian Hong Saint son was rather wary of it. He had to avoid the ninth ice chain carefully and did not dare to face it head-on.</p><p>Every time they clashed, a terrifying coldness would enter his body and try to freeze his divine power and blood.</p><p>“Dragon Wing slash!”</p><p>The great sun Dragon Claw hand wasn’t the only divine skill that the Tian Hong Saint son had cultivated. He used another divine skill, Dragon Wing slash.</p><p>A pair of wings extended from his back and slashed at Lu Ming like two heavenly blades.</p><p>This divine skill was both a speed-type divine skill and an attack-type divine skill. It was extremely profound.</p><p>The power of such a skill, combined with the great sun Dragon Claw hand of the Tian Hong Saint son, was even more shocking.</p><p>A Saint-level figure was indeed powerful.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming performed the nine heavenly kun Peng technique. He dodged and fought with the Tianhong Saint son at the same time. For a moment, he was at a complete disadvantage.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s divine skills, the ice chains, and the divine power that was constantly flowing out of the quantity formula put the Tian Hong Saint son at a disadvantage for the time being. However, it would not be easy for the Tian Hong Saint son to defeat Lu Ming.</p><p>Both parties exchanged dozens of moves in a row. Lu Ming was in a precarious situation but he was blocked by him.</p><p>Lu Ming did not use his ancient God Body at once.</p><p>First, he wanted to see how strong a Saint-level figure was.</p><p>Second, he wanted to use the Tian Hong Saint son to train his own divine skills.</p><p>Obviously, the Tian Hong Saint son had also seen through Lu Ming’s thoughts.</p><p>kid, you actually want to use me to hone your divine skills. Go to hell, Divine Dragon materialization art!</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son roared and finally used his secret skill.</p><p>A seven-clawed Divine Dragon appeared above the Tian Hong Saint son’s head. It was 10000 meters long.</p><p>“Seven claws!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>In the past, the Tianhong Saint son’s Divine Dragon phenomenon could only form a six-clawed Divine Dragon. Now, he could form a seven-clawed Divine Dragon.</p><p>One had to admit that the Tian Hong Saint son was very talented. He had cultivated the divine Dragon materialization technique, but it was incomplete. However, he had managed to cultivate the seven-clawed Divine Dragon phenomenon.</p><p>“Tear him apart.”</p><p>die! the Tian Hong Saint son shouted. He controlled the divine Dragon Dharma laksana and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Do you think you’re the only one who has the divine Dragon phenomenon? Come out!”</p><p>Divine Dragon! Lu Ming shouted in a low voice. A Divine Dragon image also appeared above his head. However, it was a nine-clawed Divine Dragon.</p><p>Many people were shocked. They did not expect Lu Ming to know the divine Dragon materialization technique and the divine Dragon he condensed was a nine-clawed Divine Dragon.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The nine-clawed Divine Dragon roared and pounced at the Tian Hong Saint son’s seven-clawed Divine Dragon. The two divine Dragons wrestled in the air.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s nine-clawed Divine Dragon Dharma form was at a slight disadvantage.</p><p>Although the power of the divine Dragon phenomenon was related to the divine Dragon’s level, and the more dragon claws there were, the more powerful it was, it also had a lot to do with one’s cultivation.</p><p>The stronger one’s cultivation was, the stronger the divine Dragon phenomenon would be.</p><p>A Divine King could easily crush a nine-clawed Divine Dragon Dharma power formed by a divine realm expert, even if it was just a five-clawed Divine Dragon Dharma power.</p><p>The logic was the same.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s Divine Dragon Dharma power was a nine-clawed Divine Dragon, his cultivation base was far weaker than the Tianhong Saint son’s. Therefore, in the battle between Dharma powers, his Divine Dragon Dharma power was at a disadvantage.</p><p>“So what if you’ve condensed a nine-clawed Divine Dragon? You’re still not my match. Just wait for your death!”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son roared, but he was so jealous that he was about to go crazy.</p><p>He had cultivated for a long time, given his all, and spent God knows how much effort to condense the seven-clawed Divine Dragon phenomenon.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming had condensed a nine-clawed Divine Dragon phenomenon not long after he obtained the divine Dragon phenomenon art. It would be strange if he was not jealous.</p><p>as long as I kill him, the complete divine Dragon materialization technique will be mine. I’ll be able to condense the complete nine-clawed Divine Dragon materialization sooner or later.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son’s eyes were filled with greed. He attacked Lu Ming with all his might.</p><p>Lu Ming was in a precarious situation.</p><p>Tianhong, it seems like you’ve used all your strength. However, I’m still far from using my full strength.</p><p>Lu Ming’s mocking voice was heard.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming’s ability was far from being fully unleashed? You’re bragging, right?</p><p>It was already beyond everyone’s expectations that Lu Ming could fight with the Tian Hong Saint son until now. Was there still more strength that he had not used?</p><p>I don’t believe it!</p><p>Most people didn’t believe it at first.</p><p>“Hmph, don’t even think about messing up my state of mind with just a few words of yours!”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son said coldly.</p><p>He did not believe that Lu Ming had yet to unleash his full strength. He thought that Lu Ming was trying to trick him and disturb his state of mind so that he would have some scruples and could not unleash his full strength.</p><p>In fact, most people thought the same.</p><p>hehe, you’re too naive to think that you can use this method to deal with Tian Hong.</p><p>“Indeed, it’s child’s play,”</p><p>The Holy Sons Zhi Xia and Fu Guang sneered, but the next moment, their eyes almost popped out.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
