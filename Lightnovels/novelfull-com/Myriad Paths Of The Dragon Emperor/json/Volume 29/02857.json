She had been cultivating for seventy to eighty years.</p><p>Now, he finally sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming flew toward the divine pulse tower.</p><p>“Young master …”</p><p>Qiu Yue was overjoyed to see Lu Ming.</p><p>Qiu Yue, you’ve finally come out of seclusion. Let’s go back to where we’re staying!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Wait, young master, I … I still owe a lot of points.”</p><p>Qiu Yue said with a red face.</p><p>that’s right, kid. This girl has been cultivating for so many years. If she doesn’t have enough points, she can’t leave.</p><p>An old man guarding The Guardian Meridian Tower said.</p><p>“So … It’s like this!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed.</p><p>He had forgotten that Qiu Yue did not have many points. She had cultivated in the divine pulse tower for so many years, so she would need at least tens of thousands of points.</p><p>That was why she sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming. Otherwise, Qiu Yue would look for Lu Ming herself after she came out of her closed-door cultivation.</p><p>“Come, senior, this is my identity token. You can take it!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out his identity token and passed it to the elder.</p><p>The old man took it and glanced at it. His eyes suddenly opened wide and he was shocked.</p><p>“The Saint token, you … You’re Holy Son Lu Ming?”</p><p>The old man asked in surprise.</p><p>“It is!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“So, you’re Holy Son Lu Ming. I’ve heard so much about you.”</p><p>The old man sized Lu Ming up curiously. He swiped his points and returned the Holy Son token to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Qiu Yue, let’s go. Eh? wait, your cultivation ….</p><p>As Lu Ming spoke, his eyes suddenly widened and he revealed a shocked expression.</p><p>He was shocked by Qiu Yue’s cultivation.</p><p>Before this, he had not carefully sensed Qiu Yue’s cultivation level. Now that he sensed it, he was shocked.</p><p>Qiu Yue’s cultivation had already reached the true God Realm and she had actually reached the terrifying stage five true God Realm.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>When Qiu Yue and Lu Ming had first come to the Kong Xuan sect, they had only been demigods. However, in just a few years, Qiu Yue’s cultivation had already soared to the fifth stage of true God Realm.</p><p>This cultivation speed was simply shocking. It was even more abnormal than Lu Ming’s.</p><p>Lu Ming was already dumbfounded.</p><p>“Young master, I …”</p><p>Qiu Yue was just about to speak.</p><p>“Wait, let’s go back and talk!”</p><p>Lu Ming held Qiu Yue’s hand and flew toward their residence.</p><p>When they returned to Lu Ming’s residence, Lu Ming then asked Qiu Yue about the details.</p><p>young master, I don’t know what happened either. After I broke through to the ethereal God Realm, something in my body seemed to have awakened, making me sink into deep cultivation. I didn’t expect that so many years would have passed by the moment I finished my cultivation. My cultivation has also risen to stage five true God Realm.</p><p>Qiu Yue blinked her big eyes, also looking confused.</p><p>“Something in your body has awakened? What’s that?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>“Young master, I’ll show you!”</p><p>Qiu Yue nodded and then circulated her divine power.</p><p>All of a sudden, a nine-colored light appeared from Qiu Yue’s heart.</p><p>Then, there seemed to be a nine-colored heart in Qiu Yue’s heart. It gave off an extremely mysterious aura.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>Lu Ming had no idea what it was, but he could sense that this nine-colored heart was extremely mysterious. It seemed to contain a terrifying power.</p><p>Oh my God, this is the nine-orifice Saint heart. This is the legendary nine-orifice Saint heart!</p><p>At this time, bone demon jumped out of the scroll and shouted in shock.</p><p>“Nine-orifice Saint heart? What was it? Also, why are you so excited?”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to bone demon.</p><p>nonsense. You’re talking nonsense. Anyone who sees a nine-orifice Saint heart will be excited. This is a legendary Saint heart. It’s countless times more precious than your ancient God heart.</p><p>The bone Devil roared, completely losing its usual calm.</p><p>calm down, calm down. Come on, tell me, what’s the use of the nine-orifice Saint heart? ”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to bone demon.</p><p>the nine-orifice Saint heart is mysterious. I can’t explain all its functions, but I know the most powerful thing about the nine-orifice Saint heart is its cultivation.</p><p>it’s said that those who have awakened the nine-holed Saint heart will cultivate at an amazing speed. Even if they eat and sleep all day without cultivating, their cultivation will automatically improve, and it’s faster than others who cultivate painstakingly.</p><p>once you cultivate seriously, coupled with some opportunities, your cultivation will soar.</p><p>Bone explained in a loud voice.</p><p>“This … This …”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned as well. He widened his eyes and looked at Qiu Yue. His lips were trembling non-stop. He could not remain calm.</p><p>Even when he was eating and sleeping, his cultivation could still continue to improve. Furthermore, it was faster than other people’s hard work. This was simply heaven-defying.</p><p>Do you still want me to live?</p><p>No wonder Qiu Yue’s cultivation had improved so quickly during this period of time.</p><p>I know. This girl’s talent in the past did not burst out at all. Her nine-orifice Saint heart was only truly awakened when she broke through to the martial God Realm and became a deity. Impressive, impressive. Lu Ming, I’m envious that you have such an impressive woman.</p><p>The bone Devil kept talking, his eyes red with envy. Of course, he was only a skeleton and had no eyes.</p><p>“Young master, you … What’s wrong? I’ll be fine, right?”</p><p>When Qiu Yue saw Lu Ming’s dazed look, she instantly panicked.</p><p>“It’s fine, it’s fine. Qiuyue, your talent is unparalleled. In the future, your cultivation will far surpass this young master’s. I’m just surprised.”</p><p>Lu Ming quickly collected his thoughts and said.</p><p>“R-really? How can my cultivation base surpass young master’s?”</p><p>Hearing Lu Ming’s words, Qiu Yue smiled sweetly. She was so beautiful.</p><p>Qiu Yue, who had awakened her nine-orifice Saint heart, was even more beautiful. She had a strange aura that made Lu Ming’s heart skip a beat.</p><p>“Qiuyue, you’re so beautiful!”</p><p>Lu Ming held Qiu Yue’s hand and praised her.</p><p>“It’s … Is that so?”</p><p>Qiu Yue’s face was red and smooth, making people want to take a bite.</p><p>“Of course it’s true!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Qiuyue, what you’ve awakened is called the ‘nine-orifice Saint heart’. Your cultivation will be astonishingly fast in the future. However, you must not tell anyone about this, or it will be very troublesome!</p><p>Lu Ming gathered his thoughts and warned him carefully.</p><p>The nine-orifice Saint heart was too amazing. Once it was spread, it would cause a great uproar. It would be hard to say whether it would be a blessing or a curse, so it was best not to spread it.</p><p>“Yes, young master!”</p><p>Qiu Yue nodded obediently.</p><p>“Qiuyue, stay with me tonight!”</p><p>Lu Ming said in a low voice.</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>Qiu Yue was flustered and her heart was beating like a deer.</p><p>This was what she had been looking forward to, but when it really came to this, she was still extremely nervous.</p><p>“Qiuyue, are you not willing? If you don’t want to, I won’t force you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“No, no…”</p><p>Qiu Yue shook her head and blushed. She lowered her head and said softly, ” “I’m willing!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
