Thousands of people charged towards the 81 Yuan Qi paths and began a bloody battle.</p><p>“Get lost, this road is mine!”</p><p>“You’re the one who should get lost, die!”</p><p>The heart of desolation was extremely precious. Many people’s eyes turned red as they charged towards the 81 paths of vital Qi. Blood splattered everywhere, and miserable cries rang out continuously. People were constantly killed.</p><p>A large number of true God Realm experts died in an instant. The remaining true God Realm experts finally sobered up a little and retreated in fear, withdrawing from the fight.</p><p>They understood that with their cultivation, they could not compete with the gods at all. Otherwise, they would only die.</p><p>However, there were still a lot of heavenly God-level figures, and the battle was even more intense.</p><p>But among them, some people’s cultivation was extremely profound, reaching seventh level celestial deity.</p><p>Seventh level celestial deity absolutely belonged to the top existences among these people. Divine power was like a tide. With a punch, a few people were killed. No one could stop it at all.</p><p>There were more than a dozen of such people, and they directly occupied more than a dozen paths of vital Qi.</p><p>In addition, some sixth level celestial deity existences were also extremely terrifying. They suppressed everyone and also occupied some vital Qi paths.</p><p>The ones with the most competition were some fifth or fourth level heavenly deities. There were many people with such cultivation, more than 81 of them. They knew that they couldn’t compete with those sixth or seventh level heavenly deities, so they gathered on the other paths of vital Qi and the competition was very intense.</p><p>Lu Ming did not make a move at first. After a while, he flew toward one of the essence Qi paths.</p><p>this true God Realm brat actually dares to go up. He’s really looking for death!</p><p>“You’re too greedy, you won’t live long.”</p><p>When some true God-level figures saw Lu Ming, they mocked him one after another, waiting to watch a good show.</p><p>Lu Ming’s speed was very fast and he had already arrived at the intersection of the path of vitality.</p><p>a true God Realm kid also came to join in the fun. He’s looking for death!</p><p>A burly man at the celestial deity realm threw a punch at Lu Ming, creating a terrifying whistling sound.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly and activated the fourfold combat power of the battle formula. His long spear vibrated and he lashed out at his opponent.</p><p>The spear collided with the fist, causing a violent boom. The fist force of the burly man was instantly destroyed. His body trembled violently and he was forced to retreat, spitting out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>The others were dumbfounded.</p><p>In particular, those true God-level people who ridiculed Lu Ming were dumbfounded.</p><p>this kid, a true God Realm, actually has such strong power. Kill him first!</p><p>An elder shouted and charged at Lu Ming with a violent aura.</p><p>This person was shockingly a fifth level celestial deity.</p><p>“Get lost, get lost …”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and stepped forward. With every step he took, a nine-clawed Divine Dragon would appear above his head. After three steps, three nine-clawed divine Dragons had appeared above his head.</p><p>The three nine-clawed divine Dragons roared furiously as they charged toward each other.</p><p>At the same time, nine ice chains appeared on Lu Ming’s body and wrapped around his opponent, emitting a shocking cold air.</p><p>Before he transformed into the ancient God Body, Lu Ming had to use all his strength to fight against a fifth-level celestial God.</p><p>“Three apocalyptic strikes, moon-cutting!”</p><p>He held the spear with both hands and struck out three times. Three crescent-shaped spear lights slashed toward the other party.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them collided and fought fiercely.</p><p>For a time, it was difficult to separate.</p><p>However, the others took the opportunity to rush toward the path of vital Qi.</p><p>“Kid, I’m done fighting with you.”</p><p>After exchanging a blow with Lu Ming, the elder retreated and charged towards a path of vital Qi.</p><p>Lu Ming followed suit and engaged in a chaotic battle with the others.</p><p>On this path, there were three fifth-level celestial deities and four fourth-level celestial deities. Including Lu Ming, eight people were engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>Those below the fourth level celestial deity realm did not have much competition power at all and were unable to join the battle.</p><p>The eight people’s battle Royale turned into a chaotic pot of porridge. A few fourth level celestial deity could still hold on a few times at the start, but very soon, they could not hold on anymore. One of them was struck in a vital part by a fifth level celestial deity powerhouse and died on the spot.</p><p>“Moon slaying!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s attack also severely injured a fourth-level celestial deity. The remaining fourth-level celestial deities retreated with grave expressions.</p><p>There were only three fourth-level celestial deities left on this path. Including Lu Ming, they were still fighting.</p><p>Lu Ming had no intention of using the ancient God Body. The ancient God Body was his trump card and he could not use it easily. After all, there would be even more terrifying competition after he passed through this path of vitality.</p><p>If they really encountered the heart of desolation, a bloody battle would be inevitable.</p><p>Lu Ming only cast various divine skills, as well as two secret skills, the ice chain and the divine Dragon materialization technique, to fight with the enemy.</p><p>Such a huge battle consumed a lot of their divine power. After hundreds of moves, the divine power of the others was almost exhausted. However, Lu Ming was still full of energy.</p><p>Lu Ming began to gain the upper hand.</p><p>And at this time, those seventh level and sixth level celestial deities already entered the depths of the cave.</p><p>The other three were getting anxious.</p><p>this kid is too strange. He has the true God Realm cultivation base, but he has such thick God Power. Why don’t the three of us join hands to defeat him? then, we can decide the winner. What do you think? ”</p><p>The other three fifth-level heavenly gods planned to join forces to deal with Lu Ming first.</p><p>The three of them had the same intention and they hit it off. The three of them immediately joined forces and attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>“I originally wanted to keep a trump card, but I’ll fulfill your wish now!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold. Then, his body expanded rapidly. He began to cast the ancient God tactic and transformed into the ancient God Body.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not use the ancient God tactic with all his might, nor did he transform into a green-armored ancient God. He had only transformed into the second level, the orange-armored ancient God.</p><p>He was only about 30 meters tall.</p><p>This way, he could save a lot of physical strength.</p><p>Even after transforming into an orange-armored ancient God, Lu Ming’s strength had increased by a large margin. He waved his long spear and sent a fifth-level celestial deity elder flying.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming strode forward and attacked the elder. Violent attacks poured down on the elder like a storm.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>The old man was shocked and tried his best to resist, but he could not stop Lu Ming. After barely blocking, he was killed by Lu Ming with one shot.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming charged at the other two people.</p><p>The other two people were shocked. They did not dare to stop Lu Ming and retreated far away.</p><p>Lu Ming landed on the path of vital Qi and strode forward. No one stopped him.</p><p>“This … Isn’t he a little too strong? is he still at the true God Realm?”</p><p>Those true God Realm existences in the distance were all dumbfounded, unable to react for a moment.</p><p>Some people were extremely dejected. They were all at true God-level, but the gap between them and Lu Ming was too great.</p><p>They did not know whether they were too useless or Lu Ming was too abnormal.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with these people’s thoughts. He ran quickly and followed the path of the vital Qi deep into the cave.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
