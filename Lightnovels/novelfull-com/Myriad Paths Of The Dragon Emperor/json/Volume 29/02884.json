Lu Ming followed the path of vital Qi and walked for thousands of miles before he finally reached the end.</p><p>In front of him, a huge bubble was floating in the dark void.</p><p>Tentacles extended from the bubble. These tentacles were the 81 Yuan Qi paths under their feet.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was instantly attracted by something in the middle of the bubble.</p><p>It was a crystal the size of a heart, emitting a brilliant light.</p><p>The heart of desolation!</p><p>Lu Ming knew that this was the heart of desolation.</p><p>However, no one was fighting for it at the moment. Those who had entered earlier than Lu Ming were all standing at the end of the path of vital Qi, looking at the heart of desolation with greed.</p><p>“These people shouldn’t be able to enter!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and did not act rashly.</p><p>However, before Lu Ming moved, the others did. An old woman who had entered at about the same time as Lu Ming had a glint in her eyes. She strode forward and pounced on the bubble, wanting to rush into the bubble and grab the heart of desolation in her hand.</p><p>The others sneered as they watched.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The old woman crashed into the bubble and crashed into it.</p><p>With a scream, the old woman’s body was pushed back, and her face was swollen, but her injuries were not serious.</p><p>“Stop dreaming. We can’t enter this bubble now.”</p><p>One of them sneered.</p><p>“Why didn’t you remind me just now?”</p><p>The old woman stared at the man with a dark expression.</p><p>“Who Do You Think You Are? Why should I remind you?”</p><p>The man sneered.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>The old woman gritted her teeth. However, her cultivation level was not as high as the other party’s, so she did not dare to say anything.</p><p>“What should we do? Are you just going to watch the heart of desolation in front of you and not get it?”</p><p>Someone said with a frown.</p><p>the heart of desolation has appeared before. I’ve read about it in an ancient book.</p><p>At this moment, a white-haired old man spoke.</p><p>“You’ve seen the records, so do you know how to get the heart of desolation?”</p><p>Someone’s eyes lit up as he looked at the white-haired old man.</p><p>“I do know, so there’s no harm in telling you!”</p><p>The white-haired elder smiled faintly. the balloon outside the heart of desolation is the vital Qi day and night formed by powerful energy. The vital Qi day and night will extend into 81 vital Qi paths. Each time, only 81 people can follow the vital Qi paths to come to the center.</p><p>that’s why I’m saying that there’s only a way to get the heart of desolation when all 81 paths of vital Qi have been stepped on by living beings!</p><p>“According to what you’re saying, when all 81 paths of vital Qi are occupied, this bubble, which is vital Qi, will dissipate?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>in your dreams. Let me tell you, it’s not possible to obtain the heart of desolation just because there’s someone on all 81 paths of vital Qi. It’s not that easy to break through the vital Qi day and night. You still need some luck.</p><p>The white-haired old man said.</p><p>what luck do you need? old man, can’t you just say everything in one go? ”</p><p>Someone said impatiently.</p><p>“What’s the hurry? Aren’t there still many paths of vital Qi that no one has yet to reach?”</p><p>The white-haired old man replied indifferently, then slowly said, if you want to break through the vital Qi morning and evening, everyone has to join forces. Everyone on the 81 paths of vital Qi has to join forces and inject their divine power into the vital Qi morning and evening to activate the vital Qi pillars. Only by activating 999 vital Qi pillars can you break through the vital Qi morning and evening.</p><p>“So it’s that simple. I’ll go first!”</p><p>A burly middle-aged man took the first step forward and arrived at the vital Qi morning and evening. He placed his palm against the vital Qi morning and evening, and rolling divine power continuously poured into the vital Qi morning and evening.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The vital Qi trembled slightly, and then a certain part of the body trembled more and more violently. Finally, a pillar of vital Qi flew out. It was a hundred meters long, like a long snake dancing in the air.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>The middle-aged man roared and continued to pour in divine power. His vital Qi vibrated day and night, and then two more pillars of vital Qi flew out.</p><p>There were a total of three pillars of vital Qi, but there was no fourth pillar of vital Qi.</p><p>“Come out, come out …”</p><p>The middle-aged man roared angrily and continued to pour in Shen power. However, his Yuan Qi did not move at all. There was no reaction at all.</p><p>“So few, only three?”</p><p>Many people looked at each other.</p><p>That middle-aged burly man had a full sixth level celestial deity cultivation, but he could only activate three pillars of essence Qi, making many people’s hearts sink.</p><p>To open the day and night vitality, 999 pillars of vitality were required. There were only 81 of them. According to this ratio, it was impossible to open the day and night vitality.</p><p>The burly man himself was so ashamed that his face turned red.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>Following that, another middle-aged woman stepped forward and injected her divine power into the vital Qi. This person was also a sixth level heavenly deity, but she could only activate three pillars of vital Qi with all her might.</p><p>This made many people’s faces even uglier.</p><p>Following that, a seventh level celestial deity existence stepped forward. But the situation was not much better either. He could only stimulate five essence Qi pillars.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>Everyone looked at each other. According to this ratio, even if all 81 of them went forward, the yuan Qi pillars they activated would not exceed 300. It was impossible to open the yuan Qi morning and evening.</p><p>ah, as expected. As far as I know, although the number of Yuan Qi pillars activated is somewhat related to cultivation, it is more related to talent. The higher the talent, the more Yuan Qi pillars activated!</p><p>in the past, every time the heart of desolation appeared, people began to gather in the desolate mountains. Very few people could get it because they couldn’t open the yuan Qi morning and night. Only after the news spread, the geniuses of all the major forces gathered together and joined forces, could they open the yuan Qi morning and night!</p><p>The white-haired old man from before sighed.</p><p>when the heaven’s favorites from the big families and sects arrive, we won’t be able to get anything. No matter what, we have to try. Next, let me do it!</p><p>An old woman was unwilling to give up. She stepped forward and injected her Shen power into the vital Qi of day and night.</p><p>This old woman was the strongest and had activated six pillars of Yuan Qi, but it was like a cup of water on a burning cart of firewood.</p><p>The others were also unwilling to give up. They all stepped forward and poured in their divine power. One by one, pillars of vital Qi flew out like long snakes dancing.</p><p>However, some fifth level celestial deity existences activated even fewer pillars of essence Qi. Some had two, and some even only had one.</p><p>Not long after, out of the eighty-one people, eighty of them had already made their move. Lu Ming was the only one who had not made his move.</p><p>80 people added up to only 251.</p><p>He was a full 748 fish away from 999.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
