Then, his body swelled up rapidly and became bigger and bigger. Finally, he became a hundred meters tall.</p><p>His body was covered in green scales, as if an ancient God had appeared.</p><p>Ancient God Body!</p><p>Lu Ming had finally used his ancient God Body!</p><p>After transforming into the ancient God Body, Lu Ming’s strength increased dramatically. He felt as if he had endless power.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear swept out. It was as huge as a mountain range, and it pressed down on the Tian Hong Saint son.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The Tianhong Saint son’s Dragon Wing slash hit the spear radiance, creating a deafening boom. Terrifying shockwaves spread out of the battle platform and in all directions.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Then, a figure stepped on the void and retreated.</p><p>This time, it was the Tian Hong Saint son who was retreating instead of Lu Ming.</p><p>“This … This is the body of the ancient God. My God, it’s the ancient God Body!”</p><p>Lu Ming has also condensed the ancient God’s body. He must have had a great encounter in the ancient God World.</p><p>it’s terrifying. It’s too terrifying. As far as I know, only the divine sons of the unique devil Academy and the indestructible sword sect, as well as the two peerless geniuses of the ice Soul Clan and the red flame clan, have obtained great opportunities in the ancient God World and cultivated the ancient God Body. I didn’t expect that Lu Ming has also cultivated the ancient God Body.</p><p>furthermore, his scales are green. That’s the fourth level of the ancient God Body. It’s terrifying!</p><p>“This is Lu Ming’s trump card. Unbelievable. This battle is going to be a mystery.”</p><p>Lu Ming had used his ancient God Body, causing an uproar at the scene.</p><p>Many of them had entered the world of ancient gods and knew about the ancient God Body. They were even more shocked.</p><p>he hadn’t expected that, aside from the four geniuses, there would also be someone else from the Kong Xuan sect who had obtained an ancient God Body.</p><p>Envy, jealousy, and hatred were the feelings of most people.</p><p>ancient God Body, you …</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son was also extremely shocked.</p><p>“I’ll use it to kill you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He held his spear and charged at the Tian Hong Saint son.</p><p>“So what if you have the ancient God Body? You still have to die, kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son roared madly and unleashed all his strength. The seven-clawed Divine Dragon roared into the sky and finally gained the upper hand. It tore apart the nine-clawed Divine Dragon that Lu Ming had condensed and pounced at him.</p><p>At the same time, the Tian Hong Saint son used the great sun Dragon Claw hand and the Dragon Wing slash to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>“Break the sky! Moon slaying!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his long spear and used the three apocalyptic strikes in a row to fight the Tianhong Saint son.</p><p>Before Lu Ming had used his ancient God Body, he had been at a complete disadvantage against the Tian Hong Saint son. However, when Lu Ming used his ancient God Body, his combat strength skyrocketed, and he suppressed the Tian Hong Saint son.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The two of them kept clashing in the fighting ring. Every time they clashed, the Tian Hong Saint son would stagger backward. He was completely suppressed by Lu Ming.</p><p>One had to admit that the Tian Hong Saint son’s combat strength was extremely strong. If it were an ordinary fourth-tier celestial God, Lu Ming would have been crushed and killed in one move when he unleashed his ancient God Body.</p><p>However, the Tian Hong Saint son was able to fight fiercely with Lu Ming, which showed his strength.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was still stronger.</p><p>“Ice chains, Divine Dragon phenomenon …”</p><p>In the middle of the battle, Lu Ming used two secret skills, the ice chain and the divine Dragon materialization technique, to interfere with the Tianhong Saint son.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son was already no match for him. Now, he was even less of a match.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>He was caught by Lu Ming’s nine-clawed Divine Dragon phenomenon in a moment of carelessness. The Dragon claws almost pierced through his body and sent him flying. He spat out a mouthful of blood as a bloody wound appeared on his body, and blood flowed out.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s spear swept across the Tian Hong Saint son.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son’s body made cracking sounds. Many of his bones were broken. He slid for a long distance on the fighting ring. He lay on the ground and spat out blood. He had no more strength to fight.</p><p>He was defeated!</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son had been defeated!</p><p>Everyone was silent as they looked on in a daze. Some people were even dumbfounded.</p><p>This scene was beyond the expectations of most people.</p><p>Before the great battle, almost no one thought that Lu Ming could defeat the Tian Hong Saint son. They all thought that Lu Ming was seeking his own death. Who would have thought that this would happen?</p><p>The fourth-level celestial deity, the Tian Hong Saint son, was actually defeated by the eighth-level true God, Lu Ming. He was lying on the ground like a dead dog.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming landed on the ground and strode toward the Tian Hong Saint son. His cold killing intent made the Tian Hong Saint son tremble.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what do you want to do?”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son shouted in fear.</p><p>“What do you want? Of course I’m going to kill you. Do you even need to ask such a naive question?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>no, you can’t kill me. I’m the Saint of the Kong Xuan sect. You can’t kill a Saint randomly.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son roared.</p><p>“This is a life-and-death battle. Don’t make it sound so laughable.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s footsteps did not stop. His killing intent grew colder.</p><p>stop! You can’t kill the Tian Hong Saint son.</p><p>At this moment, someone outside the fighting ring shouted. A powerful aura filled the air and pressed toward Lu Ming, causing him to narrow his eyes.</p><p>The person who attacked was an inner elder of the Kong Xuan sect. He was Ying Cang’s master, a peak heavenly God, and a core figure of the Tian Hong sect.</p><p>Naturally, he could not just watch the Tian Hong Saint son die at Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>However, there were people from Ouyang Qingxiang’s faction who hoped that the Tian Hong Saint son would die at Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>An inner sect elder from Ouyang Qingxiang’s faction also released a powerful aura and blocked the aura of Ying Cang’s master.</p><p>the two saints have signed the letter of challenge to a life-and-death battle. No one is allowed to interfere, so don’t break the rules.</p><p>The inner court elder from Ouyang Qingxiang’s faction said coldly.</p><p>ridiculous. Tian Hong is a Saint. It’s so difficult to give birth to a Saint. How can he be killed just because of a life-and-death duel? ”</p><p>Ying Cang’s master shouted.</p><p>“The life-and-death duel is a rule that has been formed in the cultivation world for hundreds of millions of years. How can we change the rules because of him?”</p><p>The inner court elder from Ouyang Qingxiang’s faction did not back down.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he could not be bothered to waste his breath and attacked directly.</p><p>“Tianhong, rest in peace!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly and thrust his long spear at Tian Hong.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son screamed.</p><p>“You dare to …”</p><p>Ying Cang’s master shouted, but he was blocked and couldn’t help.</p><p>As for the other powerhouses, they just watched coldly from the side.</p><p>Indeed, after signing the Deathmatch agreement, life and death would be decided, and no one had the right to interfere.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The long spear pierced through the air, causing everyone’s hearts to beat wildly.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son tried his best to Dodge, but he was too severely injured to do so.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The long spear pierced through the Tian Hong Saint son’s forehead.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son let out an unwilling scream. His eyes widened as his life force was rapidly drained. In the blink of an eye, the Tian Hong Saint son had lost all signs of life.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son had fallen!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
