They did not even show respect to the ice Soul Clan. Lu Ming was doomed.</p><p>it seems that this kid is indeed here. Get over here.</p><p>The Godking of the unique devil Academy shouted coldly and raised his palm. A powerful suction force erupted from his palm and sucked Lu Ming in, trying to pull him over.</p><p>Hmph!</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s Godking coldly snorted. He took a step in the air, and a terrifying chill burst forth, shattering the unique devil Academy’s Godking’s attractive force.</p><p>“Brother Bing, are you determined to fight us?”</p><p>The Godking of the unique devil Academy said with a cold expression.</p><p>“So what if I fight?” The ice Soul clan’s Godking said forcefully.</p><p>“If you want to fight, then I will fight with you. I’m just afraid that you can’t stop US alone.”</p><p>The Godking of the unique devil Academy roared in anger, and an extremely violent power erupted from his body. Everyone in the world felt a powerful pressure.</p><p>At the same time, a terrifying sword intent exploded from the inextinguishable sword sect Godking’s body. It pressed down on the ice Soul Race Godking, forcing him to retreat slightly.</p><p>“Hahaha …”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly burst out laughing.</p><p>“Kid, what are you laughing at?”</p><p>The Godking of the unique devil Academy cast a cold glance at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Two godkings, you’ve mobilized so many experts to capture me, a junior. It’s truly a great honor. That’s why I’m laughing.”</p><p>“Also, I’m curious. Why are the two of you here to capture me?” Lu Ming said loudly.</p><p>you used despicable means to harm the Saints of our two sects. Can’t we take you down? ”</p><p>The Godking of the unique devil Academy said.</p><p>“Despicable means? Assassination? How laughable, how laughable!” Lu Ming laughed and said, ” secret battle and Jian Xing brought a group of experts to hunt me down. However, they were too arrogant. I made use of the terrain and controlled a large formation to trap and kill them. You call this despicable? you call this a trap? ”</p><p>must I rely on brute force to fight for treasures outside? I can’t rely on intelligence.</p><p>Lu Ming asked continuously.</p><p>“Nonsense!”</p><p>The Godking of the unique devil Academy coldly shouted.</p><p>“What nonsense is he spouting? Just directly take it down!”</p><p>The Godking of the indestructible sword sect said coldly. He was about to step out to capture Lu Ming.</p><p>However, at this moment, a powerful presence appeared in the sky. It locked onto the Godking of the indestructible sword sect.</p><p>“Wuwei, are you going to interfere too?”</p><p>The God King of the inextinguishable sword sect looked up with a cold expression.</p><p>“Nonsense. Lu Ming is a disciple of Kong Xuan sect. How can we let you take him away as you please?”</p><p>Wu Wei stepped down, his divine power boiling as he locked onto the divine King of the inextinguishable sword sect.</p><p>Previously, he was alone and it was naturally difficult to stop the other party. However, with the help of the ice Soul clan’s Godking, he had nothing to fear.</p><p>Lu Ming has already said that he was being hunted down first. Then, he controlled a large array to trap and kill the two of you. This is all based on intelligence. How is it despicable and backstabbing? if people can’t even use arrays, why do they cultivate them? ”</p><p>Wuwei responded sarcastically.</p><p>In the Yimo Academy, the expression of the Godking from the indestructible sword sect turned ugly.</p><p>With Wu Wei’s arrival and his cooperation with the ice Soul clan’s Divine King, they would not gain any advantage at all.</p><p>“Hu!”</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang, Yue Linglong and the rest heaved a sigh of relief. With Wu Wei’s help, Lu Ming was safe and they were relieved.</p><p>“Damn it, why is this kid’s luck so good?”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son, the sacred son of reflection, and the others were very unhappy.</p><p>“Please leave. The ice Soul Clan doesn’t welcome you.”</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s Godking waved his hand.</p><p>hehehe, this is the business of the Qin heaven thirteen clans. Your ice Soul Clan is too nosy. Since that’s the case, my Scarlet Flame clan will play with you.</p><p>At this moment, a deep voice came from the distance. Just as the voice faded, a figure suddenly appeared in the sky.</p><p>It was a burly middle-aged man with Scarlet skin and a terrifyingly high temperature.</p><p>The red flame tribe!</p><p>Moreover, he was the Godking of the red flame race!</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s Godking’s expression turned ugly.</p><p>Wu Wei’s face darkened.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Godking of the indestructible sword sect from the unique demon Academy was delighted.</p><p>The Scarlet Flame clan and the ice Soul Clan were mortal enemies. The divine King of the Scarlet Flame clan would never help the ice Soul Clan.</p><p>“I’ll block this guy from the ice Soul Clan for you. If you want to take him, then take him quickly.”</p><p>The Godking of the Scarlet Flame race sneered and a scorching aura spread toward the Godking of the ice Soul Race.</p><p>“This is bad!”</p><p>At that moment, not only Wu Wei, but the ice Soul race’s Divine King’s expression changed.</p><p>Bing Qing, Ouyang Qingxiang, Yue Linglong, and the others ‘expressions changed drastically.</p><p>Initially, Lu Ming was already safe. He did not expect that at the critical moment, a Scarlet Flame tribe Godking would suddenly appear and break the stalemate. This caused the power of both sides to tilt again.</p><p>“Hahaha, this kid is destined to die Here.”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son, the transient light Saint son, and the others laughed wildly in their hearts. They were so happy that they could die.</p><p>“Wuwei, let’s see how you’re going to block it.”</p><p>The divine King of the indestructible sword sect released a powerful aura and locked Wu Wei in place.</p><p>The godkings of the unique devil Academy were also preparing to take action. A great battle was about to begin.</p><p>“Let’s go all out!”</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth and decided to burn the ancient God heart.</p><p>He knew that with his cultivation, even if he burned his ancient God’s heart, his fighting power would still be a far cry from that of a God King. It was impossible for him to block a God King.</p><p>However, it was not his style to sit and wait for death.</p><p>Even if he had to die, he had to fight.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>Just at this critical moment, a roar suddenly came from afar.</p><p>In the next moment, the roars became more and more numerous, layer after layer, wave after wave, like a terrifying wave.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Many people’s expressions changed.</p><p>Roar Roar Roar …</p><p>The roars were endless. The sky was shaking, the earth was shaking, and there were loud rumbles.</p><p>In the distance, a group of people flew over in panic. They were all from the ice Soul Clan.</p><p>It was obvious that these people had been out adventuring and had all flown back in a sorry state.</p><p>“Not good, not good, a beast tide, no, a demonic beast tide, a demonic beast tide has erupted.”</p><p>“Quickly enter the city!”</p><p>The ice Soul Clan members cried out in fear.</p><p>“What? A wave of demons?”</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>The few godkings, in particular, had extremely sharp eyes. They could already see countless demons charging over from the distance.</p><p>There were so many of them that they were uncountable and endless.</p><p>Among them, there were many terrifying demons. There were countless heavenly God-level demons.</p><p>“So many yaomo!”</p><p>Even the expressions of the few godkings changed.</p><p>At this moment, the godkings of the unique demon Academy, the immortal sword sect, the Kong Xuan sect, and the Scarlet Flame race all received the news at the same time.</p><p>Outside their base, countless magical beasts were discovered, and they were attacking their base.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
