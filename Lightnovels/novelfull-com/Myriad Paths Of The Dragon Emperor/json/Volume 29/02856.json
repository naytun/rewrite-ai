He could be said to be a true Overlord of the sect. He was a peerless genius and had the potential to rule the sect in the future.</p><p>However, he had died before the fight for the position of the sect leader had even officially begun. Moreover, he had died at the hands of a new disciple who had only joined the sect for about a hundred years. It could be said to be a tragedy.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and grabbed the Tian Hong Saint son’s storage ring.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it …”</p><p>Ying Cang’s master roared angrily. He was so furious that he wanted to cut Lu Ming into eight pieces.</p><p>Once the Tian Hong Saint son died, he would not be able to achieve his goal.</p><p>Initially, he had wanted to help the Tian Hong Saint son become the sect leader. Once the Tian Hong Saint son became the sect leader, his status would definitely rise. He would definitely be able to suppress the other inner elders in the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>But now, everything was ruined.</p><p>“Lu Ming, just you wait, just you wait …”</p><p>Ying Cang’s master growled in his heart. Then, he looked at the other people from the Tian Hong sect and said, ” “Let’s go, take the Saint’s Corpse, let’s go!”</p><p>However, no one moved.</p><p>The eyes of the people from the Tian Hong Saint son’s faction flickered.</p><p>Now that the Tian Hong Saint son was dead, there was no need for their faction to exist anymore. They would definitely fall apart.</p><p>Since they were going to split up, they had to choose other backers.</p><p>Lu Ming had killed the Tian Hong Saint son. His talent was shocking. Among the other Saint sons and saintesses, the only one who could compete with Lu Ming was the Supreme Saint son.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s talent, his chances of becoming the sect leader in the future were very high. This made many people in the Tian Hong sect plan in their hearts. Some of them were even considering whether they should join Lu Ming.</p><p>“You guys … What are you guys trying to do?”</p><p>Ying Cang’s master was an Elementalist. He glared at those people with anger.</p><p>Those people avoided the elementalist’s gaze and did not look him in the eye. Some of them were even unafraid of the elementalist’s gaze. After all, the elementalist was not the only inner elder in the Tian Hong Saint son’s faction.</p><p>“Good, you ungrateful things, very good.”</p><p>die! Ying Cang shouted angrily and left with the Tian Hong Saint son’s body.</p><p>“Lu Ming, your talent is unparalleled. There’s no one like you in Kong Xuan sect since ancient times. I’m Rong Hao, and I wish to join the Saint and serve him in the future to help him become the sect leader.”</p><p>An elder flew out and bowed to Lu Ming.</p><p>“You’re from Tian Hong?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept toward this person.</p><p>it was in the past, but Tianhong was stubborn. He dared to go against Holy Son Lu Ming. He deserved to die. To be honest, I’ve admired Holy Son Lu Ming’s reputation for a long time and wanted to join him. It’s just that Tianhong had been suppressing it, so I didn’t join him.</p><p>Rong Hao revealed a flattering smile.</p><p>Many people looked at him with disdain. Rong Hao was truly despicable. The Tian Hong Saint son had just died, and he immediately sought refuge with Lu Ming. He even belittled the Tian Hong Saint son.</p><p>However, Lu Ming smiled and did not reject her. He said, ” “Since you want to join me, then fine, you can follow me from now on.”</p><p>In this situation, there was no need to refuse.</p><p>If Lu Ming wanted to expand his influence, he would have to accept Rong Hao in public. In that case, there would definitely be more people who would side with Lu Ming, including those from the Tian Hong Saint son’s faction.</p><p>Many people from the Tian Hong Saint son’s faction had opposed Lu Ming in the past and wanted to join him. Naturally, they had many concerns and were afraid of Lu Ming’s revenge.</p><p>However, their eyes lit up when they saw that Lu Ming had even accepted Rong Hao.</p><p>Everyone in the Tian Hong Saint son’s faction knew that once the Tian Hong Saint son died, they would either join other factions or remain neutral.</p><p>However, in Kong Xuan sect, there were many major factions. It was not good to be neutral. Since he wanted to seek refuge, he might as well seek refuge with Lu Ming.</p><p>As expected, many people’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“I’m willing to join Holy Son Lu Ming!”</p><p>“I’m also willing to follow Holy Son Lu Ming in the future!”</p><p>Many people stood up immediately. They were all from the Tian Hong Saint son’s faction and expressed their willingness to join Lu Ming.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and accepted them one by one.</p><p>This moved even more people.</p><p>Many people who were originally neutral also showed signs of interest.</p><p>Lu Ming had risen to power and displayed unparalleled talent. Many neutral people were tempted and were considering whether to join Lu Ming’s faction.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Hmph! the sacred son snorted. His eyes were extremely cold, but there was a hint of fear in them.</p><p>He was almost as powerful as the Tian Hong Saint son.</p><p>Now that the Tian Hong Saint son had been killed by Lu Ming, he was probably no match for Lu Ming either.</p><p>He knew that Lu Ming’s rise was unstoppable.</p><p>The sacred son of reflection turned around and left with a dark face.</p><p>The other Holy Sons and holy virgins also glanced at Lu Ming with grave eyes and left one after another.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>The Supreme Holy son’s eyes opened and closed, shining with a bright light.</p><p>In the past, the Supreme Saint did not take Lu Ming seriously at all. He did not treat Lu Ming as an opponent. However, he felt a strong sense of danger now.</p><p>The Supreme Holy son’s eyes flickered a few times before he turned around and left.</p><p>everyone, the door to my sect is open for all of you. From today onwards, if you wish to join Lu Ming’s sect, you can look for an hai and Liu Chang to register!</p><p>Lu Ming pointed at an hai and Liu Chang, his voice reverberating throughout the entire venue.</p><p>Many people looked at an hai and Liu Chang with envy.</p><p>They knew that an hai and Liu Chang would be highly valued by Lu Ming and become his trusted aides. In the future, they would be able to get whatever they wanted in the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>They were envious. If they had known that this would happen, they would have long sought refuge with Lu Ming.</p><p>An hai and Liu Chang were so excited that they were trembling.</p><p>They were secretly glad that they had long sided with Lu Ming.</p><p>Although they had gone through some storms before, they had finally made it out.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and left after making the announcement.</p><p>In the next few days, there was a huge commotion in the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son had fallen, and his faction had collapsed. Lu Ming’s faction had risen.</p><p>It turned out that many experts from the Tian Hong Saint son’s faction had joined Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming did not reject anything and accepted them all.</p><p>In addition, many powerhouses who were originally neutral came to join Lu Ming. Lu Ming’s strength expanded rapidly and he became a true Saint sect.</p><p>He had even surpassed the other Holy Sons and holy virgins and was on the verge of competing with the Supreme Holy Son.</p><p>In addition, the elementalists had led some of the original members of the Tian Hong sect to join the Supreme Saint.</p><p>For a time, the Kong Xuan sect was in a state of turmoil, and a tense atmosphere spread.</p><p>However, Lu Ming put all these aside and cultivated in peace.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a few months had passed.</p><p>One day, Lu Ming suddenly received a voice transmission from Qiu Yue.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
