However, they were too few in number compared to the demons and it was difficult to stop them all.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A demonic ape, over a thousand meters tall, rushed over from the distance and punched the array.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The formation shook violently, and cracks appeared on it.</p><p>Terrifying!</p><p>The demonic ape’s strength was extremely terrifying. It had probably reached the peak of the heavenly God Realm.</p><p>In fact, there was more than one peak heavenly God among the demons.</p><p>Although there were peak divine realm experts in the ice Soul Clan, they were not as many as the demons.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>On the other side, a giant bird was covered in demonic Qi. Its wingspan was a few thousand meters wide. It opened its mouth and spat out a black lightning bolt, which bombarded the array.</p><p>The formation couldn’t take it anymore. It kept breaking and then exploding.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The demonic ape roared. It stomped on the ground and soared into the sky. Then, its huge body looked down from above and charged towards the ice Soul clan’s base.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In an instant, at least a dozen Masters of the ice Soul Clan were killed by the monster ape. In the end, the monster ape crashed heavily on the base. The entire base exploded, gravel flew everywhere, and dust filled the air.</p><p>At the same time, the other terrifying demons also launched their attacks. The scene was filled with screams and blood.</p><p>The ice Soul Clan was at a complete disadvantage and was no match for them.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming killed a ninth-tier true God fiend with one shot. Then, he dodged the attack of a heavenly God-level fiend with a flash.</p><p>These demons would find their opponents based on their aura.</p><p>The powerful demons would find the powerful experts, while the weak demons would find the weak.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation was at the fifth stage of true God Realm. Hence, many true God-level demons and demons charged towards him.</p><p>However, as Lu Ming killed more and more demons, the stronger demons also had their eyes on him. There were already heavenly God-level demons that were charging at him.</p><p>Lu Ming’s pressure was increasing.</p><p>“We can’t continue like this. There are too many yaomo.”</p><p>As Lu Ming fought, he was thinking of countermeasures.</p><p>charge out! Spread out! Charge out! Run for your lives!</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s Godking roared.</p><p>This was the only way. Otherwise, all the ice Soul Clan members would die.</p><p>Only by splitting up and charging out would many people have a chance of survival.</p><p>Now, they could only try to escape.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>“Charge out!”</p><p>Immediately, the ice Soul Clan members charged in all directions. Some were in groups of three to five, some in groups of two to three, and some alone.</p><p>Chaos!</p><p>The scene was in a mess.</p><p>Lu Ming discovered that demons and devils were everywhere. It was a chaotic battle.</p><p>At this moment, he didn’t know where Bing Qing and the others were, or if they were still alive.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>At this moment, he could not be bothered with others. Lu Ming randomly chose a direction and dashed in it at full speed.</p><p>The nine ice chains danced in the air. Lu Ming exerted all his strength and cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique. His figure flashed continuously as he charged forward.</p><p>Fortunately, the cultivation he revealed was only at the fifth stage of true God Realm. Those truly terrifying demons didn’t target him, so his pressure wasn’t too great.</p><p>After a series of attacks, Lu Ming actually broke out of the tight encirclement and then ran wildly forward.</p><p>However, there was still a large group of demons that had their eyes on him. They roared and chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>It was the same in other directions. Many members of the ice Soul Clan broke out of the encirclement and fled into the vast mountains. A large group of demons were chasing them.</p><p>In fact, it was not only the ice Soul clan’s base. There were also other bases such as the red flame clan, the immortal sword sect, the boundless Holy Land, the Yimo Academy, the Kong Xuan sect, and so on.</p><p>The bases of the 15 powerful forces were all attacked. All their bases were broken into. Like the ice Soul Clan, everyone split up to attack, run, and escape into the mountains.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique and flew at high speed through the forest. However, there were at least a few dozen fiendish demons in hot pursuit of him.</p><p>Most of these demons were actually at the heavenly God Realm.</p><p>Some of them were so terrifying that Lu Ming did not dare to stop and fight.</p><p>This was because once they stopped, they would attract even more demons.</p><p>Fortunately, Lu Ming was fast enough that the demons could not catch up with him.</p><p>Lu Ming did not know where he was going. He only remembered that he was heading towards the depths of the world of ancient gods. After running for three days, he finally lost the demons that were chasing him.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a long sigh of relief. Then, he found a place and sat cross-legged, channeling and regulating his breathing.</p><p>After a few hours, Lu Ming’s energy had recovered to its peak.</p><p>“I wonder how Ouyang Xiangxiang, Yue Linglong, Wu Zifeng, and the others are doing?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little worried.</p><p>However, with the current chaos, he had the will but not the strength. He could only depend on his own luck.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>In the distance, roars could be heard. Demons and devils whizzed past, chasing after the others.</p><p>Lu Ming retracted his aura and continued to move forward.</p><p>Now, the rear had become extremely unsafe.</p><p>This was because there were a large number of demons, as well as terrifying godkings that were a hundred meters tall and covered in orange scales. If one were to be touched by those creatures, one would probably be killed with a single slap.</p><p>In the next few days, Lu Ming shuttled through the barbaric mountains.</p><p>From time to time, Lu Ming would be hunted down by fiendish demons. Fortunately, Lu Ming did not encounter any fiendish demons that were too terrifying. Furthermore, he had QiuQiu’s help. As long as he did not encounter any fiendish demons at the fourth level celestial deity realm or above, Lu Ming had no worries about protecting himself.</p><p>In this way, Lu Ming had no idea how far he had run.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, there was a violent explosion in front of them, as well as the roars of demons.</p><p>It was obvious that someone was fighting with the demons.</p><p>“I wonder who it will be? Let’s go take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming concealed his aura and carefully made his way to the battlefield.</p><p>Lu Ming was afraid that if it was an acquaintance, he could still lend a hand. If it was an enemy, he could not be bothered.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming climbed up a mountain peak that was not very high. He hid himself with the help of the trees and looked ahead.</p><p>There was an open space in front of them, and some people were fighting.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>Lu Ming took a look and his eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p>There were demons in the war, and the red flame tribe was fighting with the demons.</p><p>What surprised Lu Ming the most were the other few figures.</p><p>These figures, together with the demons, attacked the Scarlet Flame tribe.</p><p>These figures were in human form, but they were all around ten meters tall. Furthermore, their bodies were covered in scales, and they looked extremely similar to the hundred-meter-tall God King from before.</p><p>The only difference was that the creatures here were much shorter and had red scales instead of orange.</p><p>what kind of race is this? there’s no demonic aura on his body. He’s not a demon … Wait, that’s the aura of an ancient God!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s eyes widened and he looked shocked.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
