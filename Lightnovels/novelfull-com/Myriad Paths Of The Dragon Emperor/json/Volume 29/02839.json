The longer one stayed in the blood pool, the higher the chance of success.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another day had passed. Lu Ming and the rest had been in the blood pool for three whole days.</p><p>Many people started to get nervous.</p><p>It had been three days. Lu Ming and Gu Zhuo had been in the blood pool for three days.</p><p>Lu Ming and the others weren’t too worried. He had the ancient God’s heart and would have no problem awakening the orange-armored ancient God Body. What they were worried about was Gu Zhuo.</p><p>Would he be able to awaken the orange-armored ancient God Body?</p><p>Time slowly passed as everyone waited expectantly.</p><p>Soon, four days had passed since Lu Ming and the rest entered the blood pool.</p><p>it’s been four days. It’s already been four days. Gu Zhuo’s chances of awakening the orange-armored ancient God Body have increased.</p><p>” let’s hope that he can successfully awaken the orange-armored ancient God Body.</p><p>Once one awakens the orange-armored ancient God Body, they would become a peerless genius. No matter which tribe they were in, they would be a top genius.</p><p>That was because only by awakening the orange-armored ancient God Body would one have a chance of becoming a god King. Those who had not awakened the orange-armored ancient God Body had almost no chance of becoming a god King.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, a roar was heard. On the surface of a Lake, the shadow of an ancient God suddenly appeared.</p><p>This ancient God Phantom was several times larger than the previous ancient God phantoms. It was mighty and extraordinary.</p><p>Then, Gu Zhuo’s body also appeared on the lake. As soon as he appeared, he roared and his body rapidly expanded.</p><p>On the surface of his body, dense orange scales appeared.</p><p>“Orange, it’s Orange scales.”</p><p>” the orange-armored ancient God Body! It’s the orange-armored ancient God Body! Hahaha! Gu Zhuo has successfully awakened the orange-armored ancient God Body.</p><p>” the eighth tribe has gained yet another orange-armored ancient God Body.</p><p>Many people laughed in excitement.</p><p>Gu Zhuo’s body didn’t stop growing until it was more than ten meters long. He stood on the lake mightily. After a while, the shadow of the ancient God turned into a beam of light and rushed into Gu Zhuo’s body, disappearing.</p><p>His body began to transform into a human and landed on the shore.</p><p>Gu Zhuo’s face was full of smiles.</p><p>He had finally successfully awakened the orange-armored ancient God Body and his cultivation had also improved to the peak of tier nine true God Realm. He wasn’t far from the sky god Realm.</p><p>The other young men on the shore were extremely envious.</p><p>“Who else is in the blood pool?”</p><p>Gu Zhuo asked.</p><p>“There’s still Lu Ming.”</p><p>Someone answered.</p><p>Gu Zhuo nodded. Lu Ming being in the blood pool was within his expectations. After all, Lu Ming had condensed the heart of the ancient God.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I wonder what level of ancient God Body you’ll awaken? Orange or yellow?”</p><p>Gu Zhuo muttered.</p><p>It was extremely rare for someone to awaken the yellow-armored ancient God Body at the beginning of the battle in the ten great tribes of the ancient God descendants.</p><p>Everyone continued to wait.</p><p>The fifth day, the sixth day, the seventh day …</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming had been in the blood pool for eight days.</p><p>it’s been eight days. He’s 100% sure to awaken the orange-armored ancient God Body, but he’s still a little short of awakening the yellow-armored ancient God Body.</p><p>yes. If you want to awaken the yellow-armored ancient God Body, you’ll have to stay for at least ten days.</p><p>“I wonder how many days he can stay?”</p><p>Some people were discussing in low voices, looking forward to it.</p><p>Time passed day by day.</p><p>Ten days, eleven days, twelve days …</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming had stayed there for more than ten days. However, he still had no intention of coming out. There was no sign of him awakening his ancient God Body.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming had been in the blood pool for a month.</p><p>At this moment, everyone was no longer calm. Their eyes were wide open, and their breathing was rapid.</p><p>One month, they had actually stayed for a month. According to their ancient records, among the descendants of ancient gods, the longest time they had stayed was thirty-three days.</p><p>Lu Ming was close to this record.</p><p>“Can Lu Ming break the record of thirty-three days?”</p><p>The Prodigy from the first tribe who stayed in the thirty-three heavens almost awakened the green-armored ancient God Body. Lu Ming can’t possibly do that, can he? ”</p><p>“This …”</p><p>Many people looked at each other.</p><p>in the history of the ancient God descendants, there had never been a green-armored ancient God Body the moment it awakened.</p><p>Everyone’s heart was beating fast. They were both nervous and looking forward to it.</p><p>Time passed day by day.</p><p>31 days, 32 days, 33 days …</p><p>In the blink of an eye, thirty-three days had passed. Lu Ming had already tied the record.</p><p>However, this was not the end. Lu Ming was still creating a new record.</p><p>Thirty-four days, thirty-five days …</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming had already stayed for forty-five days.</p><p>Forty-five days, a full twelve days more than the previous record.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, a roar finally came from the lake. This roar was like the rebirth of an ancient God, shaking the vast universe and stars.</p><p>The entire Stone Hall shook violently. In the blood pool, blood waves surged and rolled crazily, and blood light filled the air.</p><p>At this moment, it wasn’t just the eighth tribe. The blood pools of the other nine tribes of the ancient God descendants were also filled with roars. Waves of blood surged, and divine light filled the sky.</p><p>“What’s going on? Why did the blood pool have such a strange movement?”</p><p>“I don’t know. What’s going on?”</p><p>could it be that someone has awakened a terrifying ancient God Body? it seems like the eighth tribe has been opening the blood pool recently.</p><p>send someone. Send someone to the eighth tribe immediately and ask for information.</p><p>Orders were issued from the other tribes of the ancient God clan.</p><p>……</p><p>In the blood pool of the eighth tribe, waves of blood were surging.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure emerged from the blood waves.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes glowed with a shocking blood-red light. He raised his head and roared. The ancient God’s heart gushed out waves of terrifying energy and surged into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body began to expand rapidly.</p><p>His height was growing at an astonishing speed.</p><p>Ten meters, twenty meters, thirty meters …</p><p>It grew crazily and finally stopped when it reached a hundred meters.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was covered in green scales.</p><p>” the green-armored ancient God Body! He really did awaken the green-armored ancient God Body!</p><p>” Oh my God, he’s awakened the green-armored ancient God Body right at the beginning of his awakening. He’s the first in all of history!</p><p>no wonder his strength is so shocking. He’s too talented. I was wondering how all ascetics could be so powerful. He must be the most talented one among them.</p><p>the green-armored ancient God Body. His future is limitless. He won’t be able to break through to the God King realm, right? ”</p><p>“Heavens!”</p><p>Outside the stone Hall, there was a clamor. Everyone was looking at the scene in the sky in shock, unable to calm down.</p><p>“This … This …”</p><p>On the shore of the blood pool, the other young men were dumbfounded, completely speechless.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
