Otherwise, I’ll make sure you die an ugly death.”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son left with his men after saying that.</p><p>The sacred son of reflection snorted and left with his men.</p><p>Of course, they had left some people behind to monitor Lu Ming and the rest from a distance. If Lu Ming and the rest left the city, they would launch a lightning-fast attack.</p><p>As for Lu Ming and the rest, they went to the empty space to build stone houses.</p><p>With their cultivation, it was too easy to build stone houses. In minutes, huge stone houses were rising from the ground.</p><p>For the next few days, they stayed here and did not leave the city.</p><p>That was because the Tian Hong Saint son and the sacred son of reflection had sent people to keep an eye on him.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, more than ten days had passed, and the situation was still the same.</p><p>“Holy maiden Qingxiang, you guys go out of the city first. I’ll stay in the city alone.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Shall we leave the city first?”</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang’s expression changed.</p><p>“That’s right. Tian Hong, the person floating light wants is me. Without me around, they won’t do anything to you guys. You guys can leave the city first. It’ll be easier for me to act alone. I’ll also think of a way to leave the city.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>During this time, they found that many people who came back from the city had a big harvest. The natural treasures here were really amazing.</p><p>This world was like the ancient world when the primeval universe first came into being. All kinds of natural treasures were extremely abundant and no one had ever mined them.</p><p>It was really not worth it to stay in the city and not go out.</p><p>“Then you have to be careful.”</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang pondered for a moment before nodding.</p><p>This was the only plan he could do now.</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang then led her faction, an hai, Liu Chang, and Zhao Feng out of the city, disappearing into the vast world.</p><p>“Holy Son, Ouyang Qingxiang and the rest have left the city, but Lu Ming hasn’t. He’s still in the city.”</p><p>Someone reported to the Tian Hong Saint son as soon as Ouyang Qingxiang left.</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son hadn’t left the city during this time. He had been guarding it.</p><p>“Lu Ming didn’t leave?”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son’s eyes glinted coldly.</p><p>“Saint, what should we do now?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>“It’s easy to deal with Lu Ming alone. Leave a few experts behind to keep an eye on him. Once he leaves the city, kill him without mercy.”</p><p>The Tian Hong Saint son said coldly.</p><p>After that, he left a few experts behind to keep an eye on Lu Ming while he led his men and left the city.</p><p>They were cooped up in the city every day, unable to obtain anything and unable to afford to waste time.</p><p>Therefore, since Lu Ming was alone, he did not have to guard the place personally. He could not afford to waste his time if Lu Ming stayed in the city and did not move.</p><p>On the other side, after the sacred son of reflection received the news, he had the same plan as the Tian Hong sacred son. He left a few experts behind to keep an eye on Lu Ming while he left the city with his men.</p><p>After Ouyang Qingxiang and the rest left, Lu Ming leisurely cultivated in the city.</p><p>“Just a little more!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>His nine heavenly kun Peng technique was about to break through to the fifth level. As long as he broke through to the fifth level, in addition to the follow-up move he had prepared, he was confident that he could shake off those people who were watching him and leave this city.</p><p>“Tian Hong, floating light, I, Lu Ming, will make you regret this sooner or later!”</p><p>A cold glint flashed across Lu Ming’s eyes. He then returned to the stone house to continue cultivating.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, three months had passed.</p><p>“It’s done!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>After a few months of cultivation, Lu Ming’s nine heavenly kun Peng technique had finally reached the fifth level. His speed had increased greatly.</p><p>It’s time to leave!</p><p>Lu Ming left the stone house and flew toward the city gate.</p><p>“Lu Ming is leaving!”</p><p>“Follow him. When he leaves the city, we’ll kill him.”</p><p>The moment Lu Ming moved, the people left behind by the Tian Hong Saint son and the transient light Saint son immediately caught wind of the news. Each of them had cold killing intent in their eyes as they followed Lu Ming from a distance.</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate when he arrived at the city’s Gate. He dashed out immediately and cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique, charging into the vast forest ahead.</p><p>“What. dense divine Qi, what an ancient aura …”</p><p>As soon as he entered the forest, he was immediately hit by a primitive and ancient aura. Moreover, the trees in the forest were particularly tall.</p><p>Giant trees that were dozens of meters in diameter, hundreds of meters in diameter, and thousands of meters in height could be seen everywhere, giving one a feeling of returning to the prehistoric times.</p><p>“Chase!”</p><p>The experts left behind by the Tian Hong Saint son and the sacred son of reflection were all middle-aged men or white-haired elders. They were all powerful sky celestial realm experts.</p><p>As soon as they rushed out of the city gate, they quickly chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>“A few old fellows …”</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes as he increased his speed. Like a ROC, he flew across the sky at an astonishing speed.</p><p>However, the ones chasing after him were all celestial gods. There were even second level celestial gods. Their cultivation levels were much higher than Lu Ming’s and their speed was too fast. The distance between them and Lu Ming was constantly closing.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you can’t escape. Die!”</p><p>An old man coldly shouted.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. However, he had no intention of stopping the battle.</p><p>The people left behind by the Tian Hong Saint son and the transient light Saint son were all shockingly powerful. None of them were weaker than Liu Feiyun, and some of them were even more powerful than him.</p><p>Even if QiuQiu broke through to ninth-stage true God now, if they stopped to fight, it would only be a road to death.</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm glowed and a black jade talisman appeared in his hand.</p><p>He squeezed hard and the Jade talisman exploded. A surge of energy wrapped around Lu Ming.</p><p>A strange scene appeared. Lu Ming’s body split into two, then into four, then into eight …</p><p>In the end, it split into a total of thirty-two figures.</p><p>The thirty-two Lu Ming’s silhouettes had the exact same aura. They flew in different directions at high speed.</p><p>This was Lu Ming’s next move.</p><p>The Jade talisman was a kind of jade talisman that Lu Ming had refined after consulting the bone demon. It was very effective in escaping at critical moments.</p><p>However, the materials to refine such a jade talisman were too difficult to find. Lu Ming had searched the entire Kong Xuan sect and could only find the materials to refine one piece.</p><p>Thirty-two figures with the exact same aura appeared all of a sudden. Those who were chasing Lu Ming were instantly dumbfounded.</p><p>“This … ‘This …’ What’s going on?”</p><p>“Damn it, split up and chase!”</p><p>Someone roared. They had no choice but to split up and pursue.</p><p>However, in the end, they discovered that what they were chasing were all fake. After a period of time, they had all turned into energy and dissipated.</p><p>Lu Ming’s real body had long disappeared.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The people left behind by the Tian Hong Saint son and the sacred son of reflection gathered together again. They looked terrible.</p><p>continue searching. I don’t believe that he can escape to the sky.</p><p>An elder bellowed and planned to continue the search. They had so many experts, but they let Lu Ming escape right under their noses. It would be difficult to explain to the two Saint children when they asked.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
