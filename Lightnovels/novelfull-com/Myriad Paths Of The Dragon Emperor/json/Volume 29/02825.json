Thump! Thump!</p><p>The ancient God’s heart beat rapidly, and a mysterious and invisible aura spread out like waves, sweeping over the statues.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had a feeling that these statues were worshiping Him and listening to his orders.</p><p>“Move!”</p><p>With a thought, Lu Ming tried to control a few statues. They really moved, and their cold eyes swept over the purple-robed young man and the others.</p><p>it’s really useful. Very good. Then, I’ll send you on your way today!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with cold killing intent.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming activated the ancient God’s heart with all his might and tried to control the statue.</p><p>He realized that he could control at least a few dozen statues.</p><p>Dozens of statues were enough!</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>With a single thought from Lu Ming, the dozens of statues suddenly rushed up, brandishing all kinds of weapons, and charged at the purple-robed young man, the Holy Son of the eternal sword sect, and the others.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>The purple-robed youth and the others were shocked.</p><p>Wasn’t this stone pillar the only way to ensure his safety? Why did the statue suddenly attack them?</p><p>They didn’t have time to think, so they could only resist with all their strength.</p><p>However, the statues suddenly changed their attacks. Instead of attacking the purple-robed young man and the others, they attacked the stone pillars under their feet.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At least a dozen people, including the purple-robed youth and the Saint of the inextinguishable sword sect, had their stone pillars shattered.</p><p>Just like Lu Ming, as soon as the stone pillar collapsed, a large number of statues sensed them and charged at them. It was too late for them to Dodge.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>More than a dozen experts were sent flying by the large group of statues and fell to the ground.</p><p>A few of the weaker ones were even killed.</p><p>Then, more and more statues charged at the purple-robed young man and the others.</p><p>Screams of pain rang out continuously as people were killed one after another. Soon, only the purple-robed young man, the eternal sword sect’s strongest seven or eight people were left.</p><p>“Ah, what’s going on?”</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The purple-robed young man and the others roared and charged madly, trying to break out of the encirclement.</p><p>However, there were too few of them while there were too many statues. Moreover, Lu Ming controlled dozens of statues to hold them back. They could not break out at all.</p><p>The remaining people of the two forces were pale with fear when they saw this scene. Some people even went far away, afraid that the stone pillars would be broken and the statues would attack them.</p><p>“Ah, Lu Ming, are you the one behind this?”</p><p>The purple-robed young man roared as he glared at Lu Ming, his eyes filled with malevolent killing intent.</p><p>“Rest in peace!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>Lu Ming, let me out! I am the Holy Son of the unique devil Academy. If I die, you will not be able to pay for it even if you die ten times or a hundred times! Do you understand? ”</p><p>The purple-robed youth roared.</p><p>that’s right. I’m the Holy Son of the indestructible sword sect. If I die Here, the indestructible sword sect will definitely exterminate your entire sect.</p><p>The Saint of the eternal sword sect roared.</p><p>“I’m so scared. Do you think I’m scared?”</p><p>Lu Ming screamed, his face cold.</p><p>Should he let these people out and wait for the other party to take revenge? How was that possible?</p><p>No matter what, the other party wanted to kill him, so he would kill back, regardless of which force he was from.</p><p>A large group of statues charged toward the purple-robed youth and the others, including some that were more than ten meters tall. They were shockingly powerful.</p><p>Those who were trapped by the statues were killed one after another. Soon, only the purple-robed young man and the Saint of the eternal sword sect were left.</p><p>As for the two of them, they were both seriously injured and it would be difficult for them to resist.</p><p>“No, no, no, I don’t want to die. Lu Ming, I beg you, let me go!”</p><p>At this moment, the purple-robed young man actually gave in and began to beg for mercy.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s face was cold and indifferent. He was unmoved.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>With a shrill and unwilling scream, the Saint of the indestructible sword sect had his head blown up by a statue that was more than ten meters tall. He died on the spot.</p><p>“Ah, ah, ah, no, no…”</p><p>Seeing this, the purple-robed young man almost went crazy with fear and screamed hysterically.</p><p>At that moment, he was filled with regret. He regretted provoking Lu Ming.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>In the next moment, the purple-robed young man followed in the footsteps of the inextinguishable sword sect’s Holy Son. He was struck by a stone sword and died on the spot.</p><p>The two Holy Sons and more than a dozen experts from the indestructible sword sect and the unique demon Academy were all dead. They were all killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>The boundless sacred land’s Saint had already stopped fighting with the ice Soul clan’s third young master. His face was as white as snow, and he was filled with lingering fear.</p><p>If the ice Soul clan’s third young master had not stopped him, he would have died just like the purple-robed young man and the others.</p><p>He did not know what method Lu Ming had used to control the statues.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you killed the Holy Son of our unique devil Academy. Our unique devil Academy will not let you off. Just wait for your death!”</p><p>“I won’t let you off even if I don’t destroy the sword sect.”</p><p>In the distance, loud roars could be heard.</p><p>At this moment, the people from the other unique demon Academies and the indestructible sword sect had already rushed out of the range of the stone pillars. They were shouting as they flew.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He controlled dozens of statues and chased after those people.</p><p>Those people trembled in fear and then desperately rushed out. However, there were flying snakes flying out from the surrounding forest to attack them. They were even more frightened and rushed out with all their might.</p><p>Very quickly, Lu Ming had rushed past the stone pillar area. However, he suddenly stopped because he realized that the dozens of statues had also stopped. They did not follow Lu Ming out.</p><p>“You can’t come out?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He tried a few times in a row but it was to no avail.</p><p>it seems that these statues can’t leave this array. What a pity, what a pity!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>These statues were all very powerful, especially those that were more than ten meters tall. They were much stronger than him. If he could bring them out, they would be of great help to him. He would no longer have to fear the Tian Hong Saint son and the transient light Saint son. If he had the chance, he might be able to kill them.</p><p>Unfortunately, he couldn’t bring it out now, and this idea was ruined.</p><p>Lu Ming did not chase after the people from the unique devil Academy. There were many experts left on the other side of the immortal sword sect. Given Lu Ming’s strength, not only would he not be able to kill them, but he would also be killed by them.</p><p>“Brother Lu, you’re amazing!”</p><p>Bing Qing and the rest walked along the stone pillar and looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>“I don’t know what happened either.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and looked at the people from the boundless Holy Land in the depths of the stone pillar.</p><p>The boundless Holy Land’s people didn’t even dare to step onto the stone pillar.</p><p>“Brother Bing, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Lu Ming understood that if he did not leave, the people from the boundless Holy Land would not step onto the stone pillar. He could not kill them even if he wanted to.</p><p>Bing Qing and the others nodded, and everyone rushed out together.</p><p>By the time they rushed out of the forest, the people from the unique devil Academy and the immortal sword sect had already disappeared.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
