These statues move with the formation. Anyone who enters the formation will be killed.”</p><p>Bone’s voice echoed in his mind.</p><p>“A formation? How do I break it?”</p><p>Lu Ming quickly asked for guidance.</p><p>it’s very simple, super simple. Do you see those stone pillars? you just have to jump on the stone pillars and walk on them.</p><p>Bone said.</p><p>“It’s that simple?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>nonsense, it’s that simple. It’s just that you guys are stupid and didn’t realize it.</p><p>Bone said in disdain.</p><p>Lu Ming was at. loss.</p><p>“Let’s try!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He let QiuQiu return to his side and struck with all his might with his spear, colliding with a statue. He used the force to retreat quickly. Then, he stomped on the ground and his figure soared into the sky, landing on a statue.</p><p>When Lu Ming landed on the statues, the few statues that were chasing after him seemed to have lost track of him. They scanned their surroundings suspiciously and then attacked the others.</p><p>It was indeed useful!</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed!</p><p>“Brother Bing, quickly get on the stone pillar. The statue won’t attack the person on the pillar.”</p><p>Lu Ming quickly sent a voice transmission to Bing Qing and the rest.</p><p>When Bing Qing and the others heard this, their eyes lit up as well.

In a flash, he also rushed up to a stone pillar.</p><p>The other members of the ice Soul Clan used their own methods and rushed to the stone pillars.</p><p>Of course, there were also many people who were killed by the statues in the process of charging.</p><p>The ice Soul Clan originally had nearly three hundred people, but hundreds of them had been killed in such a short time. It was a heavy loss.</p><p>“Stone pillar, charge up the stone pillar!”</p><p>When the people from the Yimo Academy, the immortal sword sect, and the boundless Holy Land saw this scene, they also came to a sudden realization and rushed toward the stone pillar.</p><p>After paying the price, the people from the three forces also rushed to different stone pillars.</p><p>After that, everyone leaped from the stone pillars and rushed towards the big tree in front of them.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Just as Lu Ming leaped onto one of the stone pillars, a sharp saber gleam slashed at the stone pillar beneath his feet.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The stone pillar crumbled.</p><p>“This fellow …”</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze and realized that the person who had shattered the stone pillar under his feet was the purple-robed young man from the unique demon Academy.</p><p>“Go to hell!”</p><p>The purple-robed youth sneered.</p><p>As soon as the stone pillar crumbled, the statues immediately sensed Lu Ming’s presence.</p><p>Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>Immediately, a few ten-meter-tall statues leaped up and charged toward Lu Ming at the same time. Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>“Divine Dragon materialization art!”</p><p>Lu Ming immediately used the divine Dragon materialization art. A nine-clawed Divine Dragon phenomenon flew out and charged at a statue.</p><p>At the same time, the nine ice chains also flew out.</p><p>Then, he activated the nine-layer Crimson Gold armor.</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming used all his means, including QiuQiu, which turned into a shield and blocked in front of him.</p><p>However, these ten-meter-tall statues were too powerful. The divine Dragon image shook and was directly shattered by a stone sword. The nine ice chains also shattered.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming was hit by a few consecutive attacks. His body was like a cannonball, crashing to the ground with a huge boom.</p><p>Lu Ming felt as if his body was about to split apart. He spat out a few mouthfuls of blood. He had been injured just now.</p><p>However, the most fatal thing was that Lu Ming was the only one under the stone pillar at the moment. The number of statues was shocking.</p><p>At that moment, the statues charged at Lu Ming one after another, trying to drown him.</p><p>“Brother Lu …”</p><p>Bing Qing was shocked, but at this moment, they were helpless to help.</p><p>“Hahaha, you want to fight me? go to hell!”</p><p>The purple-robed youth laughed wildly.</p><p>The people from the indestructible sword sect and the boundless Holy Land looked on coldly, hoping that Lu Ming would die at the hands of the statue.</p><p>“What do we do?”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was almost in a desperate situation. There were statues rushing towards him from all directions. With so many statues, one move was enough to turn him into ashes.</p><p>Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming’s heart was beating rapidly. A strange aura filled the air.</p><p>The aura of an ancient God.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart was the ancient God’s heart. At that moment, it was giving off a wondrous aura.</p><p>When the aura spread out, the statues froze. A few of the terrifying statues ‘attacks were about to hit Lu Ming, but at this moment, they could not help but stop.</p><p>“This is a good opportunity!”</p><p>How could Lu Ming miss such a rare opportunity? he became one with the spear and turned into a dazzling spear gleam. He jumped away from a statue and rushed to the nearest stone pillar, avoiding the disaster.</p><p>“Damn it, what’s going on? Those statues, why did their movements become so stiff?”</p><p>Seeing this, the purple-robed young man roared unwillingly in his heart, and his eyes flickered with ferocious killing intent.</p><p>The others were also stunned and confused.</p><p>Just now, they had thought that Lu Ming was dead for sure. Even if any of the other Holy Sons were in such a situation, they would die without a doubt, let alone Lu Ming.</p><p>However, the movements of the statues suddenly stiffened. Lu Ming seized the opportunity and escaped.</p><p>ancient God’s heart. My ancient God’s heart is useful for these statues …</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing.</p><p>Not only that, Lu Ming even had a feeling that if he activated the ancient God’s heart, he could even control these statues.</p><p>this world’s bronze door appeared in the Holy Land of the descendants of the ancient gods. This world might have a great connection with the descendants of the ancient gods, which is why the heart of the ancient God affected these statues …</p><p>Lu Ming kept thinking and his eyes lit up slightly.</p><p>“This fellow, I will definitely take revenge for this.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold eyes looked at the purple-robed young man.</p><p>If not for the ancient God’s heart, he would have been dead and the purple-robed young man would have been on his must-kill list.</p><p>“Hmph, Lu Ming, you’re lucky. I hope you’ll be as lucky next time.”</p><p>The purple-robed young man snorted coldly, then turned around and rushed toward the big tree.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and dashed toward the big tree.</p><p>At this time, the fastest group of people had already rushed past the stone pillar area and directly rushed to the fruit at the top of the big tree.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
