Therefore, the people of the unique demon Academy were not too vigilant.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming, who was running away, suddenly stopped.</p><p>“Brat, why aren’t you running anymore? do you know that you can’t escape, so I’ll send you on your way?”</p><p>One of the black-robed elders who had caught up to Lu Ming previously spoke coldly and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“You guys are the ones on the road!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A huge fist suddenly came from behind Lu Ming. The fist was covered in red scales and it shattered the elder’s Saber Light.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Gu Hongshan’s huge body appeared behind Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Tall figures rushed over from all directions and surrounded the dozen or so experts from the unique devil Academy.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>“Ah, I’ve been tricked!”</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>The people of the unique devil Academy cried out in fear and wanted to retreat. They had never imagined that there would be so many descendants of ancient gods lying in ambush here.</p><p>However, how did Lu Ming end up with the descendants of the ancient gods?</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Gu Hongshan roared furiously and charged towards the people from the unique devil Academy.</p><p>The thirty-odd ancient God descendants all transformed into huge ancient God bodies. They were powerful and charged toward the dozen-odd people from the unique devil Academy.</p><p>Although there were also experts in the unique devil Academy, they were no match for Gu Hongshan and the others. Miserable screams could be heard continuously as they were killed one after another.</p><p>“Ah ~”</p><p>The black-robed old man who was chasing after Lu Ming let out an unwilling roar and was smashed into pieces by Gu Hongshan’s fist.</p><p>This was a massacre. Over a dozen experts from the unique demon Academy were killed in an instant.</p><p>“Haha, awesome!”</p><p>Gu Hongshan laughed.</p><p>“There’s no time to lose. Let’s kill our way into the valley and take them all out in one fell swoop.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Kill, kill our way over!”</p><p>Immediately, they charged towards the valley.</p><p>There was indeed a group of people from the unique devil Academy gathered in the valley. Their cultivation levels were all different. The weaker ones were only at the real God Realm. There were about thirty of them, but none of them were too powerful. When Gu Hongshan and the others arrived, it was another massacre. Not long after, all the people from the unique devil Academy in the valley were killed.</p><p>“Unique devil Academy. This is only the beginning …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with killing intent.</p><p>The unique demon Academy had forced him and they were irreconcilable. Lu Ming would uproot the unique demon Academy and the immortal sword sect sooner or later.</p><p>After cleaning up the battlefield, Lu Ming followed Gu Hongshan and the rest to the eighth tribe.</p><p>Following the ancient gods Mountain, they didn’t have to worry about the demons ‘attacks. They were much faster.</p><p>However, after more than ten days of traveling, they finally crossed the endless wild mountains and arrived at the eighth tribe.</p><p>The eighth tribe, the descendants of the ancient gods, was a huge city.</p><p>The entire city was made of a type of stone, which was extremely hard.</p><p>Within the city, there were many magnificent stone buildings. All these buildings had one thing in common, and that was they were huge, extremely huge.</p><p>The descendants of the ancient gods cultivated the ancient God tactics and would turn into the ancient God Body. Their bodies would change greatly. If the building was not big enough, it could easily be blown up by their huge bodies.</p><p>Along the way, Lu Ming learned a lot about the descendants of the ancient gods in this world.</p><p>The descendants of the ancient gods in this world were divided into ten tribes.</p><p>Each tribe had hundreds of thousands of people, up to millions.</p><p>Gu Hongshan was in the eighth tribe. Among the ten tribes, the strength of the eighth tribe was below average with a population of about five hundred thousand.</p><p>The descendants of the ancient gods mainly cultivated the ancient God tactic.</p><p>The descendants of ancient gods could enter the blood pool and awaken their ancient God bodies. When combined with the ancient God tactic, they would be extremely powerful, especially their divine bodies, which were extremely powerful.</p><p>However, not everyone could awaken the ancient God Body. Some people whose bloodline was not pure enough could not awaken the ancient God Body.</p><p>Only when the bloodline was pure enough could one awaken the ancient God Body.</p><p>The ancient God Body was divided into seven levels.</p><p>The colors were red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and purple.</p><p>The first level, which was also the worst level, was called the Scarlet armored ancient God Body.</p><p>for example, Gu Hongshan, Gu Yuan, and the others had awakened an ancient God Body of this level.</p><p>in truth, most of the ancient God descendants had awakened an ancient God Body that was Scarlet-armored.</p><p>There were very, very few people who could awaken the second level, the orange-armored ancient God Body.</p><p>For example, the divine King that Lu Ming had seen in the ice Soul clan’s base was a hundred meters tall and covered in orange scales. He had awakened the orange-armored ancient God Body.</p><p>As for the third level, the yellow-armored ancient God Body, it was even rarer. It was extremely rare.</p><p>Of course, this was only referring to the newly awakened level. In reality, the descendants of the ancient gods could also advance their ancient God Body by practicing the ancient God tactic. However, the difficulty was shocking. It was only possible if one had unparalleled talent.</p><p>After knowing this news, Lu Ming’s heart burned even more fervently.</p><p>When he came to the eighth tribe and the people there knew that he was the descendant of an ascetic, they were all very polite to him.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming had stayed in the eighth tribe for a few days.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, it’ll take a few more months for the blood pool of the eighth tribe to open. You can stay here for the next few months. When the blood pool opens, you can go in and awaken your ancient God Body,”</p><p>Gu Hongshan said.</p><p>“Big brother Hong Shan, where are you going?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked. He could tell that Gu Hongshan was going out again.</p><p>it’s all because of the outsiders. I’m going to go hunt for them.</p><p>Gu Hongshan’s eyes flashed with a cold light.</p><p>“Big brother Hong Shan, I’ll go with you guys. In any case, it’ll take a few months before the blood pool opens. During this period of time, I’ll be free as well.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>He planned to go with Gu Hongshan and the rest. He was mainly worried about Ouyang Xiangxiang, Yue Linglong, and the rest. If he could bump into them, Lu Ming could still think of a way to save them.</p><p>“This is good too.”</p><p>Gu Hongshan nodded and brought Lu Ming along.</p><p>For the next few months, Lu Ming, Gu Hongshan, and the others traveled through the barbaric mountains. However, Lu Ming did not bump into Yue Linglong and the rest. He did not even see any acquaintances.</p><p>This made Lu Ming rather worried.</p><p>Furthermore, as time passed, the number of people who came in from the Qin heaven Starfield became fewer and fewer. Towards the end, they did not even meet a single person for a few days.</p><p>Gu Hongshan and the others speculated that the outsiders had all found a place to hide.</p><p>This world was incomparably huge. When the people of the Qin heaven Starfield found some places to hide, it was naturally very difficult to find them. It was like looking for a needle in a haystack.</p><p>Therefore, a few months later, the experts of the ten large tribes of the descendants of the ancient gods slowly retreated from the wild mountains. For a time, the world returned to its former peace.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
