It had even surpassed the zongzi, Ouyang Qingxiang.</p><p>Everyone knew that Lu Ming was very talented. Even if he was not a zongzi, he would definitely be the true Overlord of Kong Xuan sect in the future.</p><p>Even if Ouyang Qingxiang really became the sect leader, her influence would not be higher than Lu Ming’s.</p><p>Therefore, in the days that followed, a large number of people began to join Lu Ming’s faction.</p><p>Although Lu Ming did not become a zongzi, the power of his sect grew stronger and stronger.</p><p>Of course, there were also many who sided with Ouyang Xiangxiang. After all, she was a zongzi who would be in charge of the Kong Xuan sect in the future.</p><p>In just half a year, a large number of people had sought refuge with Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang. Many of these people belonged to the other Holy Sons and holy virgins. The two’s forces had skyrocketed and had far surpassed the Supreme Holy Son and the transient light Holy Son.</p><p>Just like that, another few years passed.</p><p>These few years, Lu Ming had been focused on cultivation and polishing his Foundation. It was worth mentioning that Qiu Yue’s progress was lightning fast. She had broken through two realms in a row and was not far from the ninth stage of true God.</p><p>As for QiuQiu, ever since it had devoured the bronze altar fragment in the ancient God World, it had been in a deep sleep and had not woken up.</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming was cultivating when he suddenly opened his eyes. Immediately after, runes appeared on his body. They were densely packed and slithered around his body like small snakes.</p><p>“Dark Dragon blood Curse, is Dragon Boat Mountain summoning me?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. The dark Dragon blood Curse had always been a big issue in his heart.</p><p>“Senior bone demon, you still haven’t thought of a way to break the dark Dragon blood Curse?”</p><p>Lu Ming consulted the bone demon.</p><p>A few years ago, Lu Ming had asked the bone demon for advice on how to break the dark Dragon blood Curse. However, the bone demon did not give him any effective methods.</p><p>it’s difficult. This Dark Dragon blood Curse is extremely mysterious. The sect leader of your Kong Xuan sect is definitely not ordinary. I’m afraid he has a big secret on him.</p><p>Bone demon’s figure appeared on the scroll.</p><p>“Is there really no other way?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>it’s a pity that I don’t have any cultivation at all right now. Otherwise, I would have a way. Besides, I don’t know the purpose of the Dragon boat’s Blood Curse on you. If I knew his purpose, I could also prescribe the right medicine and come up with a way to break it.</p><p>Bone said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. The only thing they could do now was to wait.</p><p>After a while, the dark Dragon blood Curse on his body gradually faded away. At this moment, someone came to Lu Ming’s courtyard.</p><p>“Holy Son Lu Ming, the sect master has invited you?”</p><p>The person who had just arrived was an inner court elder, and his voice was transmitted into the courtyard.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming walked out of the courtyard, nodded, and followed the old man.</p><p>Not long after, he came to a large hall and the old man retreated.</p><p>In the main hall, the Dragon Boat Mountain was waiting.</p><p>Once Lu Ming arrived, the Dragon boats sized him up carefully. The more they sized him up, the more satisfied they were.</p><p>“Dragon Boat Mountain, why did you ask someone to look for me?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked with a sullen face.</p><p>He didn’t have a good attitude towards Dragon Boat Mountain.</p><p>not bad, not bad. Lu Ming, the speed of your improvement has exceeded my expectations. Good, very good.</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain nodded repeatedly.</p><p>“You didn’t ask me to come just to praise me, did you?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“Of course not. What I want to say is that your cultivation speed is still too slow. Now, I’ll give you ten years. Within ten years, you must reach the heavenly God Realm. Otherwise, I’ll activate the dark Dragon blood Curse and kill you. Do you understand?”</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain suddenly said with a cold expression.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with killing intent.</p><p>His cultivation speed was already extremely shocking, but the Dragon boats ‘master still thought that he was slow and wanted him to break through to the heavenly God stage within ten years.</p><p>This was almost impossible.</p><p>From true God Realm to celestial God Realm, there was a huge gap. Countless people were blocked on this gap, unable to cross it in their lifetime.</p><p>Even some geniuses would need a long time to break through, as well as luck.</p><p>Breaking through to the celestial deity realm in ten years ‘time was virtually something impossible.</p><p>how is it possible to break through to the heavenly-god level in ten years? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, this is your only option. If you can’t do it, you’ll die!”</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain sneered.</p><p>Creak …</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists tightly. If not for the fact that he was not a match for the Dragon Boat Mountain, he would have killed them on the spot.</p><p>“Lu Ming, find out the reason why he placed the dark Dragon blood Curse on you.”</p><p>At this moment, the bone demon’s voice was transmitted into Lu Ming’s spiritual sense.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat, but he did not show it on his face. He looked coldly at the Dragon boats and said,”Dragon Boat Mountain, what’s your purpose in casting the dark Dragon blood Curse on me?”</p><p>“You don’t need to know about this.”</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain waved his hand.</p><p>“Dragon Boat Mountain, you don’t dare to tell me your goal. I reckon that your goal is to harm me. If my guess is correct, after I break through to the heavenly deity stage, it will be of great use to you. As for me, it’s very likely that I’ll die.”</p><p>I’m going to die anyway. Rather than waiting to be used by you to death, I might as well be killed by you now so that I won’t fulfill your wish.</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“You dare?”</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain coldly shouted.</p><p>“What’s there to be afraid of? at worst, I’ll just die.”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted loudly, and a violent aura burst out from his body. He looked like he was going to fight to the death with the Dragon Boat.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll tell you.”</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain frowned and raised his hand. A powerful force dispersed Lu Ming’s aura as he spoke coldly.</p><p>Lu Ming’s aura descended.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re right. After you’ve broken through to the heavenly God-level, I do need your help. There’s no harm in telling you,”</p><p>“I placed the dark Dragon blood Curse on you to nurture it. The stronger your cultivation is, the stronger the dark Dragon blood Curse will be. When you break through to the celestial God Realm, the dark Dragon blood Curse in your body will be extremely powerful. I can use it to break a formation.”</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain said.</p><p>“What formation?”</p><p>Lu Ming continued asking.</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain frowned, but he soon smiled and said, ” “Rising Dragon array. Alright, I’ve told you everything I need to tell you. Go on and work hard. Remember, you only have ten years. If you can’t break through to the heavenly God Realm in ten years, there’s no point in keeping you alive.”</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. He then turned around and left.</p><p>As they watched Lu Ming leave, the Dragon Boat Mountain’s eyes flashed with ferocity.”Kid, you want to know my goal and find a way to break it? However, what’s the use of knowing my purpose? Hehehe, hurry up and break through. When you reach the heavenly God Realm, I’ll regain my freedom.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
