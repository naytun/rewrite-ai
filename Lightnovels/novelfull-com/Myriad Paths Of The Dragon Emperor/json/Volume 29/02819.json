He slashed out with his saber and collided with Lu Ming’s attack.</p><p>The other party’s body trembled violently, and he spat out a large mouthful of blood as his figure retreated.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A nine-clawed Divine Dragon suddenly appeared above Lu Ming’s head. It let out a long roar and pounced toward the other party.</p><p>nine-clawed Divine Dragon! The saint’s Divine Dragon materialization art!</p><p>The other party let out an extremely frightened roar, and then his body was grabbed by the nine-clawed Divine Dragon, tearing him apart.</p><p>There were a total of eight people on the other side, and now, four had fallen, leaving only four.</p><p>Two first-level heavenly deities and two second-level heavenly deities.</p><p>While QiuQiu already charged towards another second level heavenly deity.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The remaining people were already scared out of their wits. They had no fighting power at all, so they turned around and ran.</p><p>In that case, they were even less of a match for Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Zzzzzzz …</p><p>QiuQiu executed that kind of lightning again. A bolt of lightning struck out and struck a second level celestial deity expert to death.</p><p>In the Kong Xuan sect, these people were all outer sect elders or inner sect deacons. They were usually high and mighty, but now, they were falling one after another.</p><p>QiuQiu continued to charge towards the last second-level celestial deity, while Lu Ming charged towards the last two first-level celestial deities. The divine Dragon phenomenon let out a long roar and pounced towards an elder first-level celestial deity, while he himself charged towards another first-level celestial deity.</p><p>“Lu Ming, we’re the outer sect elders of Kong Xuan sect. You can’t kill us.”</p><p>that’s right. We’re the Kong Xuan sect’s heroes. You’ll be committing treason if you kill us …</p><p>A few of the elders began to roar.</p><p>“To think that you’ve lived for so many years, yet you still say such words. Isn’t it laughable?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly, his tone filled with mockery.</p><p>Previously, they had been bent on killing Lu Ming. Now that they were about to be killed, they had to bring up their status as outer sect elders of Kong Xuan sect in hopes that Lu Ming would let them off.</p><p>Only a fool would let them go.</p><p>“This old man will fight you to the death!”</p><p>An elder roared angrily. He knew that Lu Ming would not let them off. He burned his divine power with all his might and charged at Lu Ming, wanting to take him down with him.</p><p>However, a bolt of lightning struck down, and the old man’s body froze in the air. He was struck into a pile of charcoal.</p><p>It turned out that QiuQiu had already dealt with the last second-level heavenly deity and had returned to help Lu Ming.</p><p>This way, there was only one last first level celestial deity left.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The old man roared. He knew that he was going to die. He burned his divine power frantically and attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>“QiuQiu, leave this to me.”</p><p>Lu Ming kept hitting the ball and stopped it from shooting. He could use this person to train himself.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>With a shake of the long spear, Lu Ming charged towards the person.</p><p>This person had burned his divine power and his strength had increased by a large margin. He might have already surpassed the Toad King by a little. Lu Ming could use this as a practice.</p><p>The nine ice chains whistled, the nine-clawed Divine Dragon roared, and Lu Ming attacked himself. They kept attacking the other party. Even if the other party burned his divine power, he was still at a disadvantage.</p><p>The two sides fought intensely, and in an instant, they had exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>The other party was pushed back by Lu Ming.</p><p>He could not burn his divine power for long. As the other party’s divine power was consumed, he was not Lu Ming’s match.</p><p>what a monster! The Saint has offended such a person. If we can’t kill him as soon as possible, he will die in his hands sooner or later. Forget it.</p><p>At this moment, the old man sighed in his heart.</p><p>Lu Ming’s talent and combat strength had deeply shocked him. He could almost see the Tian Hong Saint son dying at Lu Ming’s hands in the near future.</p><p>After exchanging a few more moves, the man’s body was pierced by Lu Ming’s spear and he died on the spot.</p><p>The eight experts sent by the Tian Hong Saint son and the transient light Saint son to kill Lu Ming had all been killed.</p><p>Including that third level celestial deity existence, at this moment, he was already completely devoid of life aura.</p><p>Lu Ming kept all eight of their storage rings.</p><p>Eight heavenly God Realm storage rings, this would be a huge harvest.</p><p>After keeping it, Lu Ming left the place in a flash.</p><p>In the following days, Lu Ming continued to venture deeper into the mountain range. He was getting further and further away from the base.</p><p>The deeper they went, the stronger the demons and devils that appeared.</p><p>They would encounter celestial deity-level demons from time to time.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, Lu Ming would not allow QiuQiu to fight. He would fight the demons alone, train himself, and collect natural treasures at the same time.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming wandered in the desolate mountains for half a year.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>Lu Ming and the three demons were engaged in a fierce battle in a Mountain Valley.</p><p>These three fiendish demons were all at the first level celestial deity realm. Furthermore, the strength of each of them was extremely shocking, not any weaker than the Toad King back then.</p><p>The three of them joined hands and pounced with astonishing power.</p><p>Lu Ming used all his means to fight the three demons.</p><p>Ice chains, Divine Dragon Dharma power, three world-destroying strikes, nine heavenly kun Peng technique, nine layers of Crimson Gold armor …</p><p>Lu Ming used all his means and fought the three demons for hundreds of moves.</p><p>great, this is really great …</p><p>The more he fought, the stronger Lu Ming’s fighting spirit was. He felt that every cell in his body was jumping and it was extremely satisfying.</p><p>After half a year of training, Lu Ming had made great progress in all aspects.</p><p>All of his divine skills, such as the three apocalyptic strikes, the nine heavenly kun Peng technique, and the nine-layer Crimson Gold armor, had all reached the peak of the fifth layer. This rate of improvement was extremely shocking.</p><p>The further one cultivated a divine skill, the harder it was to improve.</p><p>It would take a long time to move, especially since Lu Ming’s cultivation was only at the fifth stage of true God Realm.</p><p>Lu Ming was able to cultivate several types of divine skills to the peak of the fifth level in just half a year due to the continuous fierce battles.</p><p>Especially the demons here, they were fierce and brutal, their strength was shocking, the effect of training would be even better.</p><p>His comprehension of the battle formula had increased by four times, and his success rate had reached one-tenth.</p><p>Moreover, in the past six months, Lu Ming had obtained a lot of divine medicine. Most of them were given to the quantity formula to be devoured and refined. The energy that was refined was passed to Lu Ming. Now, Lu Ming’s cultivation had reached the peak of the fifth stage true God Realm and he was not far from the sixth stage true God Realm.</p><p>This speed was no different from riding a rocket.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>Since the start of the battle, the three-headed demon’s energy had been severely depleted. It was starting to run out of energy and was slowly being suppressed by Lu Ming.</p><p>The three demons started to retreat. In the end, they growled and actually turned to run.</p><p>“Want to leave? QiuQiu, I’ll leave it to you.”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and QiuQiu flew out. It opened its mouth and spat out three bolts of lightning, which struck the three demons and killed them.</p><p>In the depths of the Col, there was a stalk of glistening divine medicine. One look and one could tell that it was not an ordinary item. Lu Ming walked over and kept the divine medicine before leaving the place.</p><p>After a few days, Lu Ming was wandering in a forest.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>Suddenly, a group of people flew over the forest.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
