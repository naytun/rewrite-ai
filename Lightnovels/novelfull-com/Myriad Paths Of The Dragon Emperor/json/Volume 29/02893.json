However, Lu Ming still managed to capture some useful information.</p><p>In a certain location on this planet, there was a very strange place. Many pangolin creatures lived there.</p><p>there must be something wrong with this abnormal situation. Perhaps there’s an array plate in that place. Even if there’s no array plate, there are other treasures. It’s worth it to go!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>“Lu Ming, have you found anything?”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang asked.</p><p>we’ve found something strange somewhere on this planet. Let’s go take a look.</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>At once, Lu Ming headed in a certain direction according to the information he obtained from the pangolin’s soul.</p><p>As they headed in this direction, they were constantly attacked by the pangolin creatures. The number of pangolin creatures seemed to have increased in this direction.</p><p>Fortunately, the cultivation of these pangolin creatures wasn’t very high. They were all at the first-level heavenly deity realm, and he didn’t encounter any second-level heavenly deity.</p><p>Although first-tier celestial deity realm cultivators had powerful defense, Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang did not feel any pressure and continued to charge through.</p><p>Two days later, they arrived at a Hill.</p><p>From a distance, the hills looked like giant red rubies embedded in the ground, shining with a brilliant light.</p><p>From time to time, pangolin creatures could be seen crawling across the hills.</p><p>According to the pangolin’s memories, that special place was at the center of the hill.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, a series of rumbling sounds came from the depths of the hill. In the distance, one could see beams of divine light shooting up into the sky and breaking through the firmament.</p><p>On the hill, there was a huge battle.</p><p>“Who is it? Could it be Supreme universe and the others?”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang’s eyes flickered as she asked.</p><p>it’s very likely that the pangolin creatures have all gone inside. Let’s go in!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Within the hill, the pangolin creatures heard the commotion and ran towards the depths of the hill.</p><p>Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang restrained their auras to the extreme and quietly followed.</p><p>Not long after, they arrived at the depths of the hill.</p><p>He saw five figures fighting with a group of pangolin creatures.</p><p>“It’s them indeed!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang exchanged glances.</p><p>The five who were fighting the pangolin were the Supreme Saint son and the transient light Saint son.</p><p>There were a few hundred pangolin creatures that were constantly attacking the Supreme Holy Son and the other four.</p><p>However, although there were many pangolin creatures, their cultivation wasn’t high. Most of them were first-level heavenly deities, only a few were second-level heavenly deities. As for third-level heavenly deities, there wasn’t a single one.</p><p>The Supreme Holy Son and the other four had the upper hand.</p><p>They kept breaking out of the encirclement and rushed towards a Hill.</p><p>Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang’s eyes also swept over the hill, and their eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p>There was an altar on the hill. It was not tall, only a meter or so.</p><p>Runes were shining on the altar, and a bronze token was floating above it.</p><p>An array plate!</p><p>Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang’s hearts skipped a beat. It was very likely that this was the array plate they were looking for.</p><p>They didn’t expect that there would really be an array plate here. Their luck was pretty good.</p><p>One had to know that there were only twelve of these array plates.</p><p>charge! We must get this array plate!</p><p>The Supreme Holy Son roared. At this moment, he had already transformed into the body of the Supreme guardian deity. His body was huge, and he kept punching out with both fists. Every punch could send a pangolin flying.</p><p>Some even exploded.</p><p>Even though the pangolin had a strong defense, it couldn’t withstand the Supreme Holy son’s full-powered attack.</p><p>The floating light Saint son and the others followed the Supreme Saint son on both sides. They attacked continuously and quickly approached the altar.</p><p>“This array plate is mine!”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s mouth curled into a cold smile. Since he had encountered it, how could he let the Supreme Holy Son and the others get it?</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang moved and rushed toward the altar.</p><p>Most of the pangolin creatures were surrounding the Supreme Holy Son and the rest. They did not notice Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang at all.</p><p>Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang were unimpeded. Only a few pangolin creatures attacked them, but they were easily sent flying. They quickly approached the altar.</p><p>“Lu Ming …”</p><p>The Supreme Saint also noticed the two of them and let out a furious roar. He was even more furious when he saw the two of them approaching the altar at a high speed.</p><p>“Don’t even think about …”</p><p>The Supreme Holy Son roared. He didn’t care about his own defense and allowed the pangolin creatures to attack him. He rushed towards the altar in a frenzy.</p><p>In this way, his speed was indeed much faster. However, he was still slower than Lu Ming.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang were less than a thousand meters away from the altar.</p><p>At this moment, they finally alerted most of the pangolin creatures. Many of them charged toward Lu Ming and Lin Feng.</p><p>“Song of the green Lotus sword!”</p><p>die! Ouyang Qingxiang shouted. With a wave of her hand, Green Lotus flowers appeared around her. Boundless sword Qi burst forth, aiming for the pangolin’s mouth and eyes.</p><p>Immediately, many pangolin creatures were killed.</p><p>ancient God Body!</p><p>Lu Ming immediately used the ancient God tactic. His body grew rapidly, turning into a green-armored ancient God that was more than two hundred meters tall.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his long spear and used army obliteration, sending more than ten pangolin creatures flying.</p><p>Lu Ming strode forward. In a few steps, he was near the altar. Then, the long spear vibrated and blasted the pangolin creatures away. He then stretched out a large hand and grabbed the array plate.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you dare …”</p><p>The Supreme Holy Son roared in anger and tried to rush forward, but he was still a step too slow.</p><p>Lu Ming grabbed the array plate. There was nothing unusual. Lu Ming held the array plate in his hand.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I found the array plate first. Hand it over!”</p><p>The Supreme Saint roared and finally rushed over, throwing a punch at Lu Ming.</p><p>The dazzling fist radiance was like a golden sun, crushing toward Lu Ming with terrifying power.</p><p>Lu Ming fired a shot with a backhand.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Their attacks collided with each other, creating a deafening boom. Rings of energy spread out, sending many pangolin creatures flying.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Their huge bodies swayed and they both took a few steps back.</p><p>“Don’t you know that whoever sees it will have a share? Besides, you’ve only seen it and haven’t obtained it yet. Why can’t I do something?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered in response.</p><p>“Then you’ll die, Paragon divine fist!”</p><p>The Supreme Holy Son roared and swung his fist at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming put away the array plate and waved his long spear to kill the Supreme Holy Son.</p><p>Roar! Roar! Roar!</p><p>During the battle, Lu Ming cast the divine Dragon phenomenon art. Three huge nine-clawed divine Dragons appeared in the sky and pounced toward the Supreme Holy Son.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
