He sped up and chased after Lu Ming, wanting to attack Lu Ming together with mo jiuye.</p><p>“We can’t continue like this!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing.</p><p>If this continued, mo jiuye would catch up to him in no time. At that time, the Supreme universe would catch up with him, and Lu Ming would not be able to escape. Only death would await him.</p><p>Lu Ming, there’s only one way out now. Fly toward the star and the planet closest to it. The closer you are to the star, the stronger the gravity will be. The environment there will definitely be more complicated. Only then will you have a chance to escape!</p><p>Bone’s voice was heard. He was very knowledgeable and quickly thought of a countermeasure.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate at all. He struck out with his spear with all his might. A huge spear light collided with mo jiuye’s attack. The force was activated and Lu Ming’s body shook. At the same time, Lu Ming borrowed this force and shot into the sky.</p><p>The cry of a kun Peng was heard. Lu Ming used all his strength to cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique. The strong divine power condensed into a kun Peng on the surface of Lu Ming’s body. With a flap of its wings, the kun Peng soared into the sky and traveled 90000 miles in an instant, rushing toward the planet closest to the star.</p><p>“You want to leave? dream on!”</p><p>Mo jiuye came to his senses and rose into the sky, chasing after Lu Ming.</p><p>Behind him, Supreme universe, four-eye void court, and the others also rose into the sky and chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>After rushing out of the starry sky, Lu Ming used the nine heavenly kun Peng technique with all his might. His speed became even faster, as if he was a bird flying in the sky. For a moment, mo jiuye could not catch up with Lu Ming.</p><p>The two sides, one chasing and one escaping, crossed a long distance and rapidly approached the planet closest to the star.</p><p>From afar, the planet closest to the star was a sea of fiery red, as if it was enveloped by a layer of fiery red clouds. It was a dazzling sight.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming was not far from this planet.</p><p>“Lu Ming, even if you run to the ends of the earth, you’re still going to die!”</p><p>Mo jiuye bellowed and used all his strength to chase after Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming did not say a word. He was engrossed in his journey. Finally, he arrived in the sky above the planet and rushed into the dazzling clouds.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled violently the moment he charged into the clouds. He almost lost control of his body and fell to the ground.</p><p>“What a terrifying gravitational force …”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. The gravity of this planet was beyond his imagination. It was extremely terrifying. Even Lu Ming was almost hit by it.</p><p>However, before Lu Ming could come to his senses, a strong gust of wind came toward him at an alarming speed. Before he could react, he was swept into the strong wind.</p><p>It was hot!</p><p>This was Lu Ming’s first impression.</p><p>This gust of wind was extremely hot. Its temperature was even more terrifying than lava. Lu Ming could feel waves of burning pain on his skin.</p><p>Lu Ming hurriedly circulated his divine power to resist and he felt slightly better.</p><p>However, the power of the gale was too shocking. Even if Lu Ming wanted to burst out with all his strength and rush out, he could not do it. He could only be swept away by the gale and flew to an unknown place.</p><p>Behind him, mo jiuye followed closely behind Lu Ming and rushed into the planet. However, he ended up like Lu Ming. The moment he rushed in, he was also swept away by a hot gust of wind. He could not help but be swept in a different direction from Lu Ming.</p><p>After mo jiuye, Supreme universe, four-eye void court, sacred son of reflection, and the others all rushed into the planet.</p><p>However, some of the weaker ones were even worse off. They couldn’t control their bodies and were attracted by the terrifying gravity, falling to the ground and suffering heavy injuries.</p><p>As for those with higher cultivation bases, although they were able to resist the gravitational pull, they were swept away by the scorching wind and flew to who knows where. The group of people had all been scattered.</p><p>Lu Ming drifted along with the strong wind. He did not know how far he had flown. Slowly, the power of the strong wind weakened. Lu Ming seized the opportunity and rushed out of the strong wind, flying toward the ground.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming landed heavily on the ground.</p><p>The hardness of the ground here was even more shocking. It was several times harder than the ground of the previous planets.</p><p>The strong gravitational force was constantly acting on Lu Ming’s body. He could only circulate his divine power to resist it at all times.</p><p>Lu Ming was on guard. However, after waiting for a moment, he did not find anything unusual.</p><p>it seems that this kind of wind only exists in the high altitude of this planet. There are fewer on the ground. As long as I avoid it carefully, I should be fine!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a while and then released his right palm. Ouyang Xiangxiang was sitting cross-legged on his palm.</p><p>At the moment, Lu Ming had the body of an ancient God. He was a few hundred meters tall and his palm was huge. It was very easy for him to hold Ouyang Qingxiang.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you alright? where are mo jiuye and the rest?”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang quickly asked.</p><p>“We’ve shaken them off!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. As he spoke, Lu Ming’s body quickly shrank to the size of an ordinary person. Then, he felt a sense of weakness.</p><p>In the previous battle, Lu Ming had been maintaining his ancient God Body, which had consumed a lot of his energy.</p><p>Following that, the two of them randomly chose a direction and ran. Not long after, they found a hidden place and the two of them took a rest.</p><p>A few days later, the two of them had recovered to their peak condition. They left the place and continued forward.</p><p>Soon, the two of them had some gains. Lu Ming found a few pieces of strange metal.</p><p>In the next few days, the two of them continued to gain. There were many precious metals on this planet. Lu Ming was all smiles.</p><p>This planet was the closest to the star, so it was affected the most by the array. It was indeed extraordinary.</p><p>Gah!</p><p>Suddenly, a sharp bird’s cry came from the front.</p><p>“Could there be a living being?”</p><p>Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang were both stunned.</p><p>It sounded like a bird’s cry. However, how could any living creature survive on this planet in such a harsh environment?</p><p>The two of them were very curious and flew in the direction of the sound.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Not long after, the two of them heard a violent rumble. Someone was fighting.</p><p>The two of them quickly concealed their auras and flew for a while before they finally saw the situation clearly.</p><p>Five young men and women were engaged in an intense battle with three giant birds.</p><p>“It’s the people of the multi-story building sect!”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang recognized the five people at a glance. They were the heaven’s favorites from one of the top ten sects, the multi-story house sect.</p><p>The multi-tower sect was one of the top ten sects. Of course, it was still slightly inferior to the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>The five people in front of him were all very powerful. Three of them were at the level of Saints, and the strongest one was not weaker than Ouyang Qingxiang.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
