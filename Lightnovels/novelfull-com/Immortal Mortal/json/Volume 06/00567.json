But because he was too rich, he used up over 40 stalks of Underworld Heart Flower at one shot. Hence, without much guidance, the Underworld Heart Flower’s aura filled up the whole area, and as a result, Mo Wuji just had to keep watch beside Cen Shuyin’s body, and did not need to do much guiding.</p><p>It had been almost a month, and Mo Wuji still did not sense the aura of Cen Shuyin’s soul. By then, he was frantic. If Lin Gu did not tell him that it was still impossible for someone of his cultivation level to enter the Soul Condensing Immortal Pond, he might have really went in to take a look.</p><p>But since he couldn’t, Mo Wuji planned to spend a little more time, continue to use Underworld Heart Flowers, and expand the search area a few tens of times larger.</p><p>Just as he was panicking, he felt the aura of Cen Shuyin’s soul.</p><p>Mo Wuji had been with Cen Shuyin for very long, and her body had always resided in his Undying World. Although they were not husband and wife, but no one in the world would know her better than him.</p><p>However, he soon sensed that something was wrong. His spiritual will detected that Cen Shuyin’s soul seemed to be fleeing from something frantically, with a strong soul following closely behind her. In a few moments, she would be gobbled up!</p><p>Rage rose up from within, and without a shred of hesitation, Mo Wuji charged straight into the Soul Condensing Immortal Pond, slashing at the soul behind Cen Shuyin.</p><p>As the soul was about to grab Cen Shuyin, Mo Wuji’s grey blade descended from above. No matter how brutal the soul was, it couldn’t help but dodge.</p><p>At the same time, Cen Shuyin felt that Mo Wuji was approaching, so she leapt at her body immediately.</p><p>Both Cen Shuyin’s soul and physical body were not even at the level of an immortal, and under the influence of the Tier 9 immortal herb, Underworld Heart Flower, they merged together as soon as they came into contact. It was because her physical body had been kept in flawless condition, even containing dense Breath of Hongmeng. Thus when her soul and boy fused, the spiritual aura gradually grew stronger.</p><p>At this point, her spirit started to recover, and her primordial spirit quickly grew…</p><p>Yet, Lin Gu did not have the time to look at Cen Shuyin. She stared shockingly at Mo Wuji. Previously she had told him that one could not go into the Soul Condensing Immortal Pond, otherwise it would be courting death. But Mo Wuji still jumped in, and despite her screams, she knew that nothing she said would help anymore.</p><p>The present scenario had unfolded before her clearly, and if Mo Wuji had hesitated for a single moment, Cen Shuyin’s soul would have been swallowed by the soul behind.</p><p>\"Ha ha ha…\" A shrill laughter echoed out. The soul that Mo Wuji slashed at had failed to consume Cen Shuyin, surprisingly broke out into laughter.</p><p>Zhu Lai couldn’t help but thank the heavens for delivering a perfect body to him. Mo Wuji’s body was young, and definitely had talent to be able to reach Xuan Immortal stage at such a young age. Why did he want to leave the Underworld? Wasn’t it to forge a physical body for himself?</p><p>Creating a new body was the best, but what was the most convenient method? Possession, and next in line was to find xiantian treasures.</p><p>The Immortal World had produced so many experts since its formation, so how could any xiantian treasures still be found? Hence the most reliable method would be to possess someone.</p><p>Possession was easy, but finding a perfect target was difficult.</p><p>There were indeed many top notch geniuses in the Immortal World. However, those geniuses were all core disciples of large sects, and it went without saying that core disciples were all protected by experts or high level techniques. Even some core disciples themselves were not easy targets to mess with.</p><p>Moreover, he was a soul, not even a primordial spirit. Once he reached the Immortal World, his strength would drop a few levels further. In such a situation, it was simply too difficult to find a good target for possession.</p><p>Coincidentally, someone was sent to his doorstep to be possessed, and it was even a perfect target. Souls were after all just souls, so he could not sense how mortal and ordinary Mo Wuji was, hence he thought that Mo Wuji was a top notch genius.</p><p>Now Zhu Lai completely gave up on Cen Shuyin’s soul, directly charging into Mo Wuji’s sea of consciousness. To him, Mo Wuji’s cultivation level was a godsend. Someone that could use that many Underworld Heart Flowers had to be a top notch expert. Who would have expected an ordinary cultivator like Mo Wuji?</p><p>His precious motivation for consuming Cen Shuyin’s soul was the possibility that the person summoning her soul was a strong expert, but since it ended up being a mere Xuan Immortal Stage cultivator, there was no need to worry any more.</p><p>Possession by soul was actually much simpler than Possession by primordial spirit, as souls were harder to deal with in the sea of consciousness than primordial spirits.</p><p>Once this soul entered Mo Wuji’s sea of consciousness, Mo Wuji knew that something was wrong. But this was still of secondary concern, the main problem was that the yin aura in the Soul Condensing Immortal Pond was constantly corroding his body, immortal elemental energy, and even his spiritual will too.</p><p>On top of that, a strong yin force was pulling at him from the bottom of the pond, causing him to lose all chances of charging out of the Soul Condensing Immortal Pond.</p><p>Even though Lin Gu did not speak of it, Mo Wuji was aware that he had no chance to surviving after falling into the Underworld. Unless he had some superpowers, a mere Xuan Immortal cultivator was dead meat after entering the Underworld.</p><p>Immediately, Mo Wuji made a decision. He threw the unrefined page of the Book of Luo to Lin Gu, shouting out, \"Lin Gu, refine this page of the Book of Luo and leave with Shuyin. Help me take care of her…\"</p><p>After he finished his sentence, the heavy yin energy from the bottom of the Soul Condensing Immortal Pond dragged Mo Wuji away. At this point, he couldn’t bother about being pulled into the Underworld or the yin energy, as the soul had begun the possession process in his sea of consciousness. Obviously, this soul also didn’t want his physical body to be destroyed in the Underworld.</p><p>Pain seared through Mo Wuji’s sea of consciousness, and that soul was stunned too, as he did not see any primordial spirit in the sea of consciousness.</p><p>This was the first time he had encountered a cultivator without a primordial spirit. Inside Mo Wuji’s sea of consciousness, there was only a large, borderless lake of violet immortal elemental energy. On top of that, the sea of consciousness was extremely large, possible even larger than some immortal kings, which made him much happier than before.</p><p>Soon, the soul found out how to possess Mo Wuji: swallowing Mo Wuji’s soul and controlling Mo Wuji’s mind palace.</p><p>After rescuing Cen Shuyin, Mo Wuji had calmed down. His cultivation level might have been much lower than the soul trying to mind palace, but he still had a secret of his own: Undying World.</p><p>When he thought of this, Mo Wuji immediately opened his Undying World, and at the same time a soul rushed into it.</p><p>Dense Breath of Hongmeng oozed out, causing the soul to pause momentarily, followed by intense excitement welling up from within. He had finally found a god given opportunity of his own. No wonder this ant-like Xuan Immortal was so strong and rich. It was because this guy had Breath of Hongmeng which was hidden in the deepest reaches of his sea of consciousness.</p><p>Sensing that Mo Wuji’s soul rushed to the location of the Breath of Hongmeng. This soul followed right behind.</p><p>It wasn’t really careless on his part, as any other person wouldn’t have thought that Mo Wuji would have a world of his own. Those with their own worlds were men of legends, and there might not even have been a single person like that in the entire Immortal World. Of course, many great powers could possess different spiritual worlds, but those were not worlds of their own. Even if those worlds were refined by their owners, once they were opened up, the aura of the world would give it away as an artificial one.</p><p>The Undying World was a world belonging to Mo Wuji, and although it was not complete, but this world was created by him. This world was fused with his sea of consciousness, so there wasn’t anything different between them.</p><p>Inside the world, he governed over everything. An extremely strong cultivator might have been able to shatter his incomplete Undying World after entering it, but this soul definitely did not have the ability to do so.</p><p>It didn’t matter than Mo Wuji was inside the Soul Condensing Immortal Pond. His body couldn’t enter the Undying World but there were still many means at his disposal to deal with this incomplete soul before him.</p><p>The moment the soul entered his Undying World, he closed off the world completely, and nothing could exit it anymore.</p><p>The Scholar’s Heart flame was unleashed inside the Undying World. Wave after wave of fire flew towards the soul, burning it continuously.</p><p>Only then did the soul realise that this was a world, a world that belonged to that ant-like Xuan Immortal cultivator.</p><p>\"Let me out! Let me out! I’ll tell you how to get of here…\" The soul panicked and screamed wildly. He knew that only something that Mo Wuji needed would be able to move im. Now Mo Wuji was being dragged by the aura of the Underworld. Perhaps even before he reached the Underworld, he would have been torn to bits by the void blades in the whirlpool or the cracks in the void.</p><p>However, how could Mo Wuji have had the energy to care about this soul. He felt that his immortal elemental energy was rapidly disappearing, and his spiritual will increasingly grew weaker.</p><p>A few void blades whooshed past his body. The weakened Mo Wuji knew that he had passed through the Soul Condensing Immortal Pond. Now what he faced was the whirlpool of void blades, similar to the one he faced before entering the Soul Condensing Immortal Pond. The whirlpool had many cracks in the void within it too.</p><p>Forcibly, Mo Wuji’s spiritual will took out one page of the Book of Luo, wrapping himself in it, and using all of the strength in his body to charge into a crack in the void.</p><p>Rather than having his physical body destroyed in the Underworld and his soul sent for reincarnation, it was a better option to try his luck by entering a crack in the void. He had already refined this page of the Book of Luo by about 40%, and there was still some chance to live inside of the crack.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
