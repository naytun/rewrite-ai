If Mo Wuji really distributed the fruits in such a matter, it was clearly too selfish. Even though they might even agree to give them all to Mo Wuji, Mo Wuji shouldn’t be the one to say it. Moreover, everyone here wasn’t related to Mo Wuji, so why would they do such a thing?</p><p>\"Keke, Dao Friend Mo, you might as well say that everything belongs to you, and that we were working for free. Wouldn’t that sound better?\" Bai Chitian grabbed this opportunity to shoot a snide remark.</p><p>\"Immortal Friend Mo, I believe that you should at least explain why you want the remaining Draining Immortal King Dao Fruits.\" A youth brimming with spirituality walked forward and said solemnly.</p><p>Mo Wuji did not recognise this person but he was sure that this person was a Star-grade genius, otherwise, he wouldn’t have such a strong spiritual aura.</p><p>\"Various immortal friends, I believe many of you want to know my background.\"</p><p>The moment Mo Wuji said that, he took out a jade token which floated in front of him, \"Everyone only needs to look at my identity jade token and you would know. I am an elder at the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance Sharphorn Branch, and at the same time, I have relations to Pill Dao Immortal Alliance’s Tier 7 Pill Emperor Nong Yong…\"</p><p>Seeing Mo Wuji’s Elder Identity Token, everyone on the scene exhaled a breath of cold air. Such a young branch elder was simply blowing their minds. For Mo Wuji to be a branch elder of the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance Sharphorn Branch at such a young age, many of the people started to believe that it was true that Mo Wuji had a close relationship with Pill Emperor Nong Yong. Otherwise, how would it be possible?</p><p>At this point, everyone understood why Huan Xiuran didn’t dare make a move against Mo Wuji, even Nai He didn’t dare do anything.</p><p>Being a branch elder of the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance, and having close relations with Pill Emperor Nong Yong, that was indeed incredible. No one suspected that Mo Wuji’s identity token was fake as only such an identity would explain what happened previously.</p><p>Seeing that everyone was stunned by himself, Mo Wuji extended his hand to grab his jade token as he said, \"I know that everyone here is a disciple of a big sect, and it is easy for you to get pills. But I believe that everyone would not be able to get access to all sorts of pills, such as the Draining Immortal King Pill…\"</p><p>The moment they heard Mo Wuji’s words, Chen Hu and the other cultivators seemed to understand something. They stared at Mo Wuji in pleasant surprise and asked, \"Elder Mo is saying…\"</p><p>Mo Wuji confirmed their words, \"Everyone’s guess is right. What I’m saying is, if everyone gives these Draining Immortal King Dao Fruits to me, I will request Pill Emperor Nong Yong to concoct a batch of Draining Immortal King Pill, free of charge. Of course, this comes with a condition, I’m not in charge of the secondary immortal herbs, and I would only give 4 Draining Immortal King Pills in every batch.\"</p><p>Requesting Pill Emperor Nong Yong to concoct the pills was a lie. Mo Wuji only met Pill Emperor Nong Yong once, and it wasn’t even Nong Yong himself, but a mere sliver of Nong Yong’s immortal will.</p><p>The reason why Mo Wuji dared to say these words was because he had confidence that he could advance to become a Tier 7 Pill Emperor in a short period of time.</p><p>If this was before he entered the Broken World, he wouldn’t dare to have such thoughts. But after entering the Broken World, he felt like there wasn’t any difficulty to become a Tier 7 Pill Emperor. With his Pill Dao and such large amounts of immortal herbs, it would be weird if he couldn’t become a Tier 7 Pill Emperor.</p><p>One must know that he was a Tier 5 Pill King now.</p><p>\"Is Immortal Friend Mo’s words true?\" Even Chen Hu was slightly emotional as he asked that question.</p><p>The Draining Immortal King Pill was a Tier 7 pill that helped Grand Luo Immortals advance into the Immortal King Stage. It was something that only Pill Emperors could concoct. In the entire Immortal World, the number of Tier 7 Pill Emperors could be counted in one’s fingers. With such few Pill Emperors, why would they help some random person concoct the Draining Immortal King Pill?</p><p>To put things in a different perspective, even for Star-grade geniuses, they would require their sects to help them request for the Pill Emperor’s help. And when that happens, the sect wouldn’t be merely be paying with a certain percentage of the batch of pills, but something much more.</p><p>When Mo Wuji said that only 4 Draining Immortal King Pills would be given per batch, it was equivalent to saying that the service was free of charge. One must know that a full batch of Draining Immortal King Pills only had 6 pills. This would mean that the Pill Emperor would only keep 2 pills for himself, what more could they ask for? For a usual pill request, they would have to give up 50% of the pills and even pay remunerations of immortal crystals or immortal herbs.</p><p>And those pill requests weren’t for pills at the level of the Draining Immortal King Pill.</p><p>\"I, Mo Wuji, am a true Pill Dao Immortal Alliance Branch Elder, so how could I lie to you guys about this. Moreover, I would soon be opening a store in Sharphorn Immortal Ruins, so immortal friends can come visit me at any time. Of course, if everyone is not willing, then ignore my previous words. If everyone would prefer to cut the remaining Draining Immortal King Dao Fruit into pieces and split them, I wouldn’t object,\" Mo Wuji said in a direct and straightforward matter.</p><p>\"Elder Mo, what if I don’t want a Draining Immortal King Pill?\" An ordinary looking Xuan Immortal clasped his fists and said.</p><p>Mo Wuji immediately came to a realization; it was true that the Draining Immortal King Pill was valuable, but it was truly too distant for the cultivators here. The Draining Immortal King Pill was for cultivators to advance to the Immortal King Stage, while most of the people here were merely Xuan Immortals. Perhaps to everyone here, Grand Yi True Pills were much more valuable. As he thought of this, Mo Wuji smiled indifferently, \"For immortal friends that don’t want the Draining Immortal King Pill, I am willing to concoct for you two batch of pills free of charge. Whether you want Grand Yi True Pills or Grand Luo Immortal Pills, there’s no problem. Because the full batch of these two pills contains 12 pills, I can give you 8 pills.\"</p><p>\"Alright, I, Min Zihao, agree,\" The cultivator that previously asked the question did not hesitate to agree.</p><p>The Grand Yi True Pill was a pill to advance to the Grand Yi Immortal Stage, while the Grand Luo Immortal Pill was a Tier 6 immortal pill that could help Grand Zhi Immortals advance into the Grand Luo Immortal Stage. Even though their values could not be compared to the Draining Immortal King Pill, they were both extremely sought after.</p><p>\"I also agree!\"</p><p>\"Agreed!\"</p><p>…</p><p>Many of the cultivators expressed their consent.</p><p>In Mo Wuji’s perspective, it was expected that these cultivators would agree. If it was him, he would have agreed as well. For an average cultivator, what could they do with a Draining Immortal King Pill? And what more the bits they got from splitting the leftover fruits? Mo Wuji had promised to help transform these fruits into pills, only idiots wouldn’t agree. Those that missed out on this opportunity would have to go the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance on their own, and that wouldn’t be easy.</p><p>Chen Hu also clasped his fists and said, \"I also agree.\"</p><p>Seeing everyone agree, Bai Chitian didn’t dare to spout any nonsense.</p><p>Chen Hu bluntly said, \"Immortal Friend Mo, why don’t you discuss with Pill Emperor Nong Yong. When the time to concoct the Draining Immortal King Pill comes, perhaps he could give us 5 pills. In return, this pagoda treasure can also be given to Immortal Friend Mo. As for the technique jade letter, everyone would record it down but the original one would be given to Immortal Friend Mo.\"</p><p>Chen Hu was also rather helpless; after all, everyone could record down the technique manual, but only one person could keep the magic treasure.</p><p>Mo Wuji said apologetically, \"I can’t really help with that. After all, if I were to ask Senior Nong Yong for help and to only give him 1 pill per batch… Even I don’t feel comfortable asking him for that. However, if immortal friends here purchase pills from my pill house, I can give a 90% discount. Oh right, my pill house is called Tian Ji Pill Court.\"</p><p>The Draining Immortal King Pill was a strategic pill. Mo Wuji wanted to establish the Tian Ji Sect, and every Draining Immortal King Pill was valuable. How could he let go of more than a hundred pills just for a pagoda magic treasure? He was definitely not going to take that deal.</p><p>\"Since that’s the case, then we’ll follow according to Dao Friend Mo’s words. Dao Friend Mo, you can go pick the Draining Immortal King Dao Fruits, while we make records of the jade letter.\" Chen Hu was very straightforward in the way he did things. After saying all that, he had already grabbed the jade letter from the stone table and had it float in mid ait.</p><p>Fortunately, there weren’t any seals on the jade letter itself, so everyone’s spiritual will was able to read the contents within. This was actually a jade letter on arrays. Once many people saw this jade letter, they immediately lost interest. Even though they did continue to record it down, it was unknown whether they even understood it.</p><p>At this instant, Mo Wuji picked 121 fruits from the tree. At the same time, he placed all of them in a jade box each and sent these jade boxes into everyone’s hands.</p><p>Thereafter, he dug up the entire Draining Immortal King Dao Fruit Tree and sent it into his Undying World.</p><p>The cultivation of everyone here was roughly the same as his; no one was overwhelmingly more powerful than him. Thus, Mo Wuji wasn’t worried that people would discover his Undying World.</p><p>Chen Hu passed the jade letter and the pagoda treasure to Mo Wuji, then he said, \"Immortal Friend Mo, how are we going to find you in the future for the pills?\"</p><p>Mo Wuji had already thought about this. He retrieved some jade stones and casually carved more than a hundred jade tokens. Then he gave each cultivator a jade token and said, \"These jade tokens contain my imprints. When the time comes, immortal friends can find me at my Tian Ji Pill Court or at the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance Sharphorn Branch. There is one point that I need to make clear, even if you’re looking to concoct pills, it must be at least two years later.\"</p><p>\"That’s of course.\" Even if Mo Wuji didn’t explain, many of the cultivators understood.</p><p>It was not easy for them to get to the Broken World, so who would be so foolish as to return back so quickly?</p><p>The crowd dispersed in all directions. Even though the one that gained the most was Mo Wuji, the others weren’t disappointed. Not only did they obtain the Draining Immortal King Dao Fruit, they also obtained the promise of a Pill Emperor’s pill request.</p><p>Mo Wuji was rather satisfied. Even though he had to help concoct more than a hundred batches of pills, it could not be compared to the rewards that he gained. Moreover, in his Pill Dao, he had to continuously practise in order to improve.</p><p>Mo Wuji did not travel for more than a hundred miles before he felt someone following him.</p><p>Indeed, when Mo Wuji stopped, Bai Chitian’s figure appeared in front of him.</p><p>He directly blocked Mo Wuji’s path as he said calmly, \"Elder Mo, I know that your background isn’t ordinary. I’m indeed unable to do anything to an elder of the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance. However, the jade box that you took is useful to me. I hope that you can give it to me, and I will give you whatever compensation you need. I am even willing to give you the Draining Immortal King Dao Fruit.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji sneered in his heart. Since some time ago, he had already felt Bai Chitian’s killing intent. This Bai Chitian was in the late Xuan Immortal Stage, while he was a the peak of the Golden Immortal Stage, just one step away from being a Xuan Immortal. If they really had to fight, he had no need to fear this Bai Chitian.</p><p>Star-grade genius? So what? He did not give a sh*t about them.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
