His cultivation was too low, and when the two Golden Immortals with powerful auras entered, he could only hide.</p><p>\"What’s the meaning of this?\" When the knife-scarred cultivator saw his companion get slapped flying, his face became ugly and he didn’t even address Mo Wuji as ‘senior’ anymore.</p><p>\"Pa!\" Mo Wuji sent another slap. This knife-scarred cultivator was also slapped; half his face directly shattered and not a single tooth was left in his mouth.</p><p>\"You think your Empty Mirror Immortal Dao is very impressive? If destroy my pill house, then I would also be considered a remaining evil.\" Mo Wuji walked towards the two cultivators that he slapped towards the wall, with his hands behind his back.</p><p>\"Senior, I know that you’re definitely not simple for being able to open a store here. But can’t you be more reasonable? We aren’t the ones that crashed into your pill house. We are only chasing after the evil survivor of Tian Ji Sect; it is nothing related to senior.\" The knife-scarred cultivator was slightly angered. However, he knew that Mo Wuji wouldn’t dare to kill a person here.</p><p>Mo Wuji snickered, \"I’m not being reasonable? Let me tell you, I’m also from Tian Ji Sect. If you have the guts, come destroy my pill house. If you’re unable to destroy my pill house, then I’m sorry, I will have to destroy your Empty Mirror Immortal Dao.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji completely didn’t know how impressive the Empty Mirror Immortal Dao was, but that wasn’t important, he could also start boasting. As for his claim that he was from Tian Ji Sect, no one else really believed him other than himself.</p><p>\"Haha, this friend has such a temper, to even threaten to destroy our Empty Mirror Immortal Dao. I am the simple trade union manager of Empty Mirror Immortal Dao; I want to see how exactly you intend to destroy my Empty Mirror Immortal Dao.\" A chuckle could be heard as a thin and tall man in brown robes walked in.</p><p>Even though Mo Wuji was only in the early Xuan Immortal Stage, he only needed a single glance to discern that this was a Grand Yi Immortal.</p><p>Before Mo Wuji could answer, another loud chuckle could be heard, \"Elder Mo, I heard that you’ve returned so I immediately came to visit. Fortunately, I wasn’t too late.\"</p><p>When the brown robed man saw the newcomer, and heard the respect in that person’s words, he immediately got a shock. He recognised this person; it was Void Piercer Treasure Pavilion’s Du Ju. Even though the Empty Mirror Immortal Dao was a mid-grade sect, it was too far when compared to the Void Piercer Treasure Pavilion. If even Du Ju was so courteous to this young man, could it be that this young man had an amazing background? To be an elder at such a young age, what sect could it be?</p><p>\"Shopkeeper Du, long time no see.\" The brown robed cultivator hurriedly clasped his fists; he knew that his status was far from Du Ju, and additionally, Du Ju had a greater foundation in Sharphorn Immortal Ruins than him.</p><p>Du Ju still didn’t know the situation. When he saw the brown robed cultivator he casually nodded, \"So it’s Immortal Friend Fu, Immortal Friend Fu…\"</p><p>Du Ju immediately stopped speaking; he noticed two cultivators with the Empty Mirror’s ensign on their robes lying injured on the floor. Those injuries were clearly new. As he thought of Elder Mo’s temper, how could Du Ju not know that these two people were injured by Mo Wuji.</p><p>So it turns out Elder Mo had an enmity with the Empty Mirror Immortal Dao. Then, why would he bother continuing to talk nonsense with this Fu Zhensong.</p><p>Fu Zhensong wasn’t an obtuse person; even though he knew that Mo Wuji’s words about destroying the Empty Mirror Immortal Dao were merely boastful remarks, he could still guess that Mo Wuji wasn’t so simple. Otherwise, Du Ju definitely wouldn’t be so courteous to him. It was exactly because of this that he did not continue speaking.</p><p>At this instant, the injured knife-scarred cultivator stood back up and swiftly explained the situation.</p><p>\"Elder Mo, these two disciples of mine were indeed wrong in their handling of the matter. Even though it was the survivor of Tian Ji Sect that crashed against your esteemed pill house’s pill cabinets, my Empty Mirror Immortal Dao is willing to pay the compensation. Elder Mo, please say your price. After we pay you, we will immediately leave with this Tian Ji Sect’s survivor.\" Fu Zhensong’s tone had become more courteous; he had also lowered his attitude.</p><p>Unfortunately, he didn’t know that his words were treated as a provocation by Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji didn’t even bother to reply him as he turned to Du Ju and asked, \"Shopkeeper Du, who’s the most powerful fella in Empty Mirror Immortal Dao?\"</p><p>Du Ju had come here to improve his relationship with Mo Wuji, and replying to this question had no impact to him so he didn’t hesitate to answer, \"I heard that Empty Mirror Immortal Dao’s First Elder Wei Yun is already in the intermediate Immortal King Stage. I also heard that the sect head Mo Fei would soon be entering the Immortal King Stage…\"</p><p>Mo Wuji frowned and muttered, \"Looks like destroying the Empty Mirror Immortal Dao would be quite troublesome.\"</p><p>Du Ju got a shock; those words were truly too absurd. Even if Mo Wuji was a Pill Dao Immortal Alliance Branch Elder, he couldn’t simply eradicate a sect at his whim, much less a mid-grade sect like Empty Mirror Immortal Dao.</p><p>Even if these words were merely a threat, they couldn’t be casually said like that.</p><p>However, he really didn’t know that Mo Wuji genuinely wanted to destroy the Empty Mirror Immortal Dao. Even though Mo Wuji knew that he currently didn’t have the capability, and even his status as an honorary elder of the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance Headquarters also wouldn’t have such a capability, it did not mean that he wasn’t going to send this message.</p><p>He could relay his intentions of destroying the Empty Mirror Immortal Dao to the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance Headquarters. Of course, even though he knew that the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance wouldn’t follow his intentions, he would be uncomfortable if he didn’t do it.</p><p>\"Elder Mo, please be more tactful with your words. We can take your first words as a misunderstanding, but you can’t keep threatening to destroy my Empty Mirror Immortal Dao. I know that Elder Mo’s status is not low, but that doesn’t mean that you can keep doing that.\" By the side, Fu Zhensong truly couldn’t endure it and he snorted coldly.</p><p>Mo Wuji took out two jade tokens and handed them to Dou Hualong and said, \"Hualong, help me make a trip to Pill Dao Immortal Alliance Sharphorn Branch. Get them to dispatch an expert above at the Grand Yi Immortal Stage above to come over and catch these tyrants. Moreover, the Empty Mirror Immortal Dao destroyed my store. Get the branch to use my name to seek help from the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance Headquarters, to destroy the Empty Mirror Immortal Dao.\"</p><p>\"Yes, big brother.\" Dou Hualong hurriedly received the two jade tokens and prepared to walk out.\"</p><p>\"Please hold your step.\" Fu Zhensong, whose spiritual will had already scanned the jade tokens, urgently blocked Dou Hualong.]</p><p>Previously, he didn’t know Mo Wuji’s identity and background, so he didn’t take things too seriously. But what did Mo Wuji just take out? One was a jade token representing his identity as an elder at the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance Sharphorn Branch. The other was even more terrifying: honorary elder at the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance Headquarters, Honored Grade Tier 4 Pill King.</p><p>If this was the previous Mo Wuji speaking, Fu Zhensong would disdainfully ignore what Mo Wuji said. But now, he couldn’t think in the same way. An Honored Grade Tier 4 Pill King and an honorary elder at the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance Headquarters, it definitely wasn’t a laughing matter when Mo Wuji talked about using his status to ask for the destruction of the Empty Mirror Immortal Dao.</p><p>Facing the behemoth that was the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance, the Empty Mirror Immortal Dao was nothing; this would mean that Mo Wuji’s words might possibly turn into reality. As he thought of this, Fu Zhensong’s back instantly became drenched in cold sweat</p><p>By the side, Du Ju was also secretly stunned. Previously, he only thought that Mo Wuji was an elder of the Sharphorn Branch. He never expected that Mo Wuji would also be an Honored Grade Tier 4 Pill King, as well as an honorary elder of the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance Headquarters.</p><p>If you considered those two statuses, coupled with the reason that the Empty Mirror Immortal Dao destroyed Mo Wuji’s pill house… Du Ju subconsciously felt his heart shivering. These reasons were enough for the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance to destroy the Empty Mirror Immortal Dao.</p><p>As for whether or not the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance would investigate the validity of Mo Wuji’s claims, that was simply a joke. Even if the words that the honorary elder said were fake, the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance would take it as the truth. Moreover, this honorary elder was also an Honored Grade Tier 4 Pill King.</p><p>Even a fool would know the future potential of an Honored Grade Tier 4 Pill King. Otherwise, the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance wouldn’t give Mo Wuji the title as an honorary elder. Wasn’t their motive simply to tie Mo Wuji, this Honored Grade Pill King, to their Pill Dao Immortal Alliance?</p><p>Fortunately, he was acute previously. He didn’t offend this deceivingly young elder.</p><p>\"Elder Mo, there were many misunderstandings. I hope that Elder Mo would be magnanimous to forgive us lowly ones,\" Fu Zhensong bowed and said, his heart was trembling with palpitations. If the other party was determined to destroy the Empty Mirror Immortal School, then it would be useless even if he acted as the other party’s grandson.</p><p>Dou Hualong also stopped and subconsciously turned to Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji also knew that if he forcefully got Dou Hualong to go to the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance now, Fu Zhensong might possibly jump the gun and attack him now. He naturally didn’t fear Fu Zhensong, but it was indeed difficult for him to gain an upper hand against a Grand Yi Immortal. Moreover, Mo Wuji also knew that even if he brought his jade tokens to Pill Dao Immortal Alliance, the possibility that the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance would help him was very slim. This was because he didn’t know anyone in the alliance. It might even be simply because Nong Yong appreciated him, which was why he got this title as an honorary elder.</p><p>If the casual words of an honorary elder would get the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance to eradicate a sect, then the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance wouldn’t have lasted to this day. Fu Zhensong was so afraid because this matter involved his Empty Mirror Immortal Dao, and the name of the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance was truly too imposing.</p><p>If Mo Wuji wanted to destroy the Empty Mirror Immortal Dao, he could only depend on himself, and not the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance. His current actions of threatening Fu Zhensong were merely using the guise of the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance to act for Tian Ji Sect.</p><p>\"Was Tian Ji Sect destroyed by your Empty Mirror Immortal Dao?\" Mo Wuji did not continue to ask Dou Hualong to leave. Instead, he asked that question in a cold tone.</p><p>Even if Fu Zhensong was an idiot, he knew that Mo Wuji should be related to Tian Ji Sect. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have cared so much about Tian Ji Sect and even name his pill house the Tian Ji Pill Court.</p><p>\"No, Tian Ji Sect offended the Great Sword Path. It was Great Sword Path’s Elder Sajian that destroyed it. My Empty Mirror Immortal Dao merely accepted Elder Sajian’s order to chase after the surviving disciples of Tian Ji Sect,\" Fu Zhensong answered as cold sweat trickled down his back.</p><p>Mo Wuji knew of the Great Sword Path; it was also a huge sect with incomparable power. Even though it might be slightly weaker than the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance, it wouldn’t be weaker to a huge degree.</p><p>\"How many Tian Ji Sect disciples has your Empty Mirror Immortal Dao caught?\" When Mo Wuji heard that Tian Ji Sect wasn’t destroyed by Empty Mirror Immortal Dao, his tone became better.</p><p>\"Two, Yi Lan was the third one that we were pursuing.\" Fu Zhensong was especially cautious as he spoke; he had truly been terrified by Mo Wuji. In his eyes, Mo Wuji wasn’t doing this to scare him. Because with Mo Wuji’s status, all his threats were truly possible.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
