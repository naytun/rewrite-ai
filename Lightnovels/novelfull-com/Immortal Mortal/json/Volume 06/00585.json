Mo Wuji was clear that when facing this sort of cunning soul, unless death was right next to his face, it would be hard to get anything of true value from him.</p><p>Preciously, this fella knew that his soul tempering method could not be hidden, which was why he revealed it. Even so, this fella only inscribed the simply introduction.</p><p>\"Dao friend, if I'm not wrong, dao friend must have fallen fallen into the Soul Condensing Immortal Pond, and perhaps even the Yin Underworld Whirlpool. The fact that you survived must definitely be because you entered a spatial tear. Usually, anyone who entered a spatial tear would find it very hard to get back to the Immortal World. Even though I, Zhu Cai, am only left with a soul, I've been to many places. Wait till my soul condenses, I can find a path back to the Immortal World.\" Zhu Cai said calmly.</p><p>When Mo Wuji heard Zhu Cai’s tone, he knew that this fella was bent on bargaining with himself. That's the right way, Zhu Cai this old thing, must definitely have been afraid that he would simply be killed without a chance to talk, just like what Mo Wuji did to him previously. Mo Wuji even started to suspect that Zhu Cai's first plead for mercy was an act, all to get Mo Wuji to lower his guard.</p><p>Mo Wuji thew the jade letter back out and said calmly, \"Tell me about the method to get back to the Immortal World, and finish inscribing the soul tempering method.\"</p><p>Zhu Cai was not flustered, \"Dao Friend, we still haven't discussed the conditions. I, Zhu Cai, only want to preserve my life. Even if you want to place a soul imprint on my soul, it's also possible.\"</p><p>The moment a soul imprint was placed, it would mean that his life was placed in Mo Wuji's hands. With a single thought, Mo Wuji could kill him. Back in the cultivation world, Chanse gave a soul imprint to Mo Wuji and became Mo Wuji's servant.</p><p>However, Mo Wuji trusted Chanse. He definitely wouldn't trust this Zhu Cai. This person's heart was unfathomably deep and terrifying; this fella was basically a ticking time bomb. They were now in his Undying World. The moment they left the Undying World, Mo Wuji guessed that his schemes would not win over this person's.</p><p>Other people's soul imprint could control that person's soul. However, this Zhu Cai's soul imprint did not seem trustable. This person was an expert with tempering the soul; it would be weird if his soul imprint could be trusted.</p><p>This fella had been in the Undying World for so long; he would definitely know about his Breath of Hongmeng. Keeping him was truly too dangerous.</p><p>Mo Wuji threw a ball of Scholar's Heart out, \"I've never thought of discussing any conditions with you.\"</p><p>The \"Pss!\" sound of a burning soul could be heard. Zhu Cai cried our on pain, \"You can't kill me. You will regret it if you kill me. I know where the other pages of the Book of Luo are…\"</p><p>When Mo Wuji heard these words, his killing intent only got even heavier; this fella knew too much. If this fella knew about the Book of Luo just because he managed to get to this world safely through the spatial tear, then he's truly too terrifying. Because at that time, even he, himself, was disoriented and didn't know what was going on.</p><p>\"Crackle…\" After the 'pss’ sounds, came the crackling sounds of the soul ending.</p><p>With the power of the Scholar's Heart, Zhu Cai's soul had completed dispersed into nothingness.</p><p>At the instant that Zhu Cai's soul dissipated, he only felt regret. In reality, Mo Wuji's guess was not wrong. After being sent into the Undying World, Zhu Cai really wasn't scared. Instead, he was pleasantly surprised. He never thought that Mo Wuji would have such fate.</p><p>What did he see in the Undying World?</p><p>Underworld Heart Flower, billion year Immortal Wood Marrow, and even a Heavenly Wood Cane…</p><p>All these didn't even count for much. What left Zhu Cai shocked was when he felt Mo Wuji's Undying World. A mere Xuan Immortal was able to create his own world, how amazing must his cultivation technique be?</p><p>Moreover, this world had already merged with the Earth Elemental Bead and the Metal Elemental Bead.</p><p>Actually, this also didn't count for much. What left Zhu Cai's heart boiling was the Breath of Hongmeng. He would risk his life for any one of these things, and now, they were actually all gathered in one place. There was no need to talk about how Mo Wuji controlled the Undying World. Even if the Undying World wasn't under Mo Wuji's control, he would still find ways to get close to Mo Wuji.</p><p>In his eyes, Mo Wuji was a mere Xuan Immortal ant. That bit of intelligence that Mo Wuji had probably wasn't even worth looking at. When the time comes for him to take all these things away, Mo Wuji will even help him carry them.</p><p>However, all these thoughts disappeared. He never expected for Mo Wuji to be so decisive. To not even care about the soul tempering method and simply destroy him.</p><p>After Zhu Cai's soul turned into nothingness, Mo Wuji heaved a sigh of relief. He knew that Zhu Cai had a lot of things on his memories; as long as he spent time grinding, he would be able to get all of them out. However, he wasn't willing to do that. He had too many other things to settle, and he had lots of things to cultivate. Why would he have the time to spend on a cunning soul?</p><p>After destroying Zhu Cai, Mo Wuji left his Undying World and returned to his flying shuttle. Now, what he wanted to do was to research on the two ancient scrolls left behind by the witch race.</p><p>Mo Wuji brought both scrolls out. Indeed, they were from the same origins. Hong Guang’s scroll was not a physique tempering technique, however. It was a sort of strength increasing method, and the scroll was damaged and incomplete.</p><p>On the other hand, the scroll that Pan Jie left him was indeed the witch race’s physique tempering technique. And this physique tempering technique was compatible with the strength increasing method.</p><p>If Zhu Cai's soul tempering technique was considered the peak of sacred arts, then the witch race's legacy physique tempering technique could also be considered to be at the peak as well. Even though Mo Wuji had yet to cultivate yet, he could feel that this physique tempering technique was not simple.</p><p>This physique tempering legacy was definitely created with meticulous care and it was complete. However, it wasn’t completely suitable for Mo Wuji. Mo Wuji decided to modify this technique according to his meridian cultivation technique.</p><p>…</p><p>Whether it was in space, or during cultivation, time was being spent like crazy.</p><p>Mo Wuji also knew that even if he cultivated, it would be hard for him to advance in a short period of time. Thus, after he obtained the witch race’s physique tempering technique, he had engrossed himself in modifying the technique. His experience was limited, so with every revision he made, he would try it out by circulating it through a small circulation path.</p><p>Years passed in a flash. If his flying shuttle had not shook abruptly, Mo Wuji would still be engrossed with perfecting the physique tempering technique.</p><p>Mo Wuji had installed an array at the front of his flying shuttle. Unless someone attacked, it would automatically avoid any loose meteors and continue moving in the direction.</p><p>Now that his flying shuttle had been hit, clearly, it was attacked.</p><p>Mo Wuji landed at the front of his flying shuttle; his heart enraged. His flying shuttle had been speeding and minding its own business, so it was impossible for it to have offended anyone. But now, someone actually attacked his flying shuttle.</p><p>Mo Wuji instantly sent his spiritual will sweeping outwards; he actually saw two flying ships in his spiritual will. No, it would be more accurate to say two entirely different flying ships.</p><p>One of the flying ships was the same as his; it was a magic treasure. If it was simply a magic treasure, then it wouldn’t be anything much. But what left Mo Wuji shocked was that the grade of this flying ship was very high; it might even be higher than his Grade 7 immortal flying shuttle. In other words, if he wasn’t the other party’s opponent, he wouldn’t even be able to escape with his Grade 7 flying shuttle.</p><p>The other ship was actually a spaceship; it was a product of technology. What left Mo Wuji stunned was that at the exterior of the spaceship, he saw some familiar letters, \"UNIONYF07.\"</p><p>The YF07 at the back didn’t matter. The key thing was the English word ‘union’ at the front.</p><p>Mo Wuji did not know what happened on Earth all these years, but he was quite sure that this spaceship was from Earth.</p><p>However, after a quick sweep with his spiritual will, he found that there wasn’t any signs of life inside the spaceship. It was a mess within the ship; clearly, something had invaded and a battle occured.</p><p>Seeing the spaceship from Earth, even though there wasn’t any trace of life, Mo Wuji was still very excited. However, at this point, he didn’t have time to investigate that spaceship. Instead, his eyes had landed on the immortal flying ship that was slowly approaching him.</p><p>He was sure that the thing that laid hands on him was this immortal flying ship.</p><p>A gold robed youth with a gloomy expression walked out from the ship. His eyes were fixed on Mo Wuji.</p><p>This was an expert; Mo Wuji only needed a single glance to tell this this fella was very likely an Immortal King, or even an Immortal Reverent.</p><p>Mo Wuji took a deep breath and retrieved his saber. Against expectations, Mo Wuji wasn’t really afraid. Because he could tell that this Immortal King’s cultivation had been suppressed; at this point, he was roughly equivalent to a Golden Immortal.</p><p>However, Mo Wuji did not believe that this Immortal King’s cultivation had been suppressed by some more powerful expert. Instead, he believed that this Immortal King had suppressed his own cultivation.</p><p>This actually left Mo Wuji feeling a little relaxed. This meant that his meridian cultivation technique really didn’t need to feel the pressures from the Heaven and Earth. This was very likely due to his 108 meridians or his Undying World; his 108 meridians formed a Heaven and Earth circulation within his own body, while his Undying World was an independent Heaven and Earth of its own.</p><p>\"Who are you?\" The gold robed youth sized Mo Wuji up, then he asked with a gloomy tone. As for the saber in Mo Wuji’s hand, he didn’t even place it in his eyes.</p><p>Mo Wuji said calmly, \"Who I am isn’t important. The important thing was that I was rushing somewhere. I didn’t do anything to offend this sir, but this sir attacked me for no reason. Isn’t that too tyrannical? So I request this sir to give me a reason.\"</p><p>Even though this gold robed youth had acted on him, Mo Wuji knew that the event that occured on that union spaceship shouldn’t be related to this gold robed youth.</p><p>This sort of expert definitely wouldn’t charge into a spaceship and fight with some mortals. If this expert wanted to destroy that spaceship, he had many different methods.</p><p>\"Haha….\" The gold robed youth chuckled, \"this is the first time, I, Jin Yiren actually got questioned. And it’s by a trashy little ant.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji said with contempt, \"If I’m trashy, then you’re not anything better.\"</p><p>In Mo Wuji’s perspective, they were both from the Immortal World; no one was more dignified than the other.</p><p>Jin Yiren said indifferently, \"Could you have thought that just because you’re from the Immortal World, then you aren’t trashy? An ant is still an ant. Your sky is only as big as the opening of your well.\"</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
