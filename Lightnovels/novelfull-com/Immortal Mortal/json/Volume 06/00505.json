It's said that his attainments in the Sword Dao had reached the extreme stage; the moment his sword appeared, the entire atmosphere would be filled with his Sword Qi. Moreover, this man has dedicated his entire life to the Sword Dao. In his else, there was only the sword; everything else was secondary.</p><p>What left everyone fearful of him was that when Fang Shijiang was in the late Xuan Immortal Stage, he was able to kill a Grand Yi Immortal.</p><p>This was a Grand Yi Immortal; even the weakest Grand Yi Immortal could not be compared against a Xuan Immortal. This was the difference in both quality and quantity. By the time one reaches the Grand Yi Immortal Stage, his primordial spirit would evolve and expand, and his ability would rise by maybe even more than a hundredfold? One can clearly see, how difficult it was got a Xuan Immortal to kill a Grand Yi Immortal.</p><p>However, Fang Shijiang did just that.</p><p>As Fang Shijiang asked this question, everyone turned to look at Nai He; everyone wanted to know what was the situation at that point in time.</p><p>The white-haired Nai He bowed, \"Greetings Senior Brother Fang. During that time, because my ability was stronger than his, he could only flee at the start.\"</p><p>When another female cultivator heard this, she patted her chest and said, \"I thought that Sister Nai He had a huge head-on battle with that person. So it turns out that he used a talisman to escape, then sneakily find a way to ambush Sister Nai He.\"</p><p>Expressions of understanding appeared on the others’ faces; if a Worldly Immortal used a talisman to escape and used some concealing technique, it wouldn't be impossible to ambush a Golden Immortal with a regulation talisman like Nai He. However, at the end of the day, that victory would be due to luck. While there might be some hints of talent, it wasn't as terrifying as Nai He made it out to be.</p><p>Nai He shook her head, \"Unfortunately, that's not the case. He didn't use any escape talisman; he simply continuously fled while in space. I was able to track him with my spiritual will, but after chasing him for entire months, I was still unable to shorten the gap…\"</p><p>Even though everyone here in this garden were peak geniuses, they could not help but shudder when they heard Nai He's words. A Worldly Immortal, without using any talisman, was able to escape from a Golden Immortal's pursuit for months. How could he simply be a simple genius?</p><p>There was no need to talk about that Worldly Immortal's escape-type sacred art. Just his endurance alone could not be matched by ordinary people.</p><p>One must know that even though a Golden Immortal would be constricted by the regulation talisman, he would still have his immortal elemental energy and spiritual will. Thus, he would not tire easily.</p><p>This cultivator was able to flee from Nai He for months, this clearly showed that this person's endurance was simply stupefying.</p><p>\"Eventually, he slowed down. Otherwise, I wouldn't know how long I would have to chase him for. When he stopped, I even thought that his endurance had reached its limits; I never expected that he would enter a space canyon. When we were in that canyon he completely dominated me. It could be said that during that battle, whether it was ability or intellect, I lost to him completely.\" Nai He's voice was soft and solemn; everyone could even tell from her voice that her heart had suffered an impact because of this incident.</p><p>After some time, Fang Shijiang sighed, \"When this person comes to the Immortal World, I must have a battle with him. Is Junior Sister Nai He able to tell me his name and what he looks like?\"</p><p>Nai He shook her head but didn't say anything further. There was also another matter which she didn't reveal, which was that cultivator was able to understand spatial laws while only in the Worldly Immortal Stage. Furthermore, it wasn't a simple scratch on the surface of spatial laws; it was a deep enough understanding which allowed him to escape for months. That was simply terrifying.</p><p>A bald youth stood forward, rubbed his head and laughed heartily, breaking the peculiar atmosphere, \"We will eventually see that genius. However, it wasn't easy for us to gather here today, so let's discuss the Dao. Let me start. Even though my Seven Buddha Great Temple cultivates the Buddhist Dao, the 3,000 Great Daos are very similar…\"</p><p>…</p><p>At this instant, Mo Wuji was furiously absorbing immortal spiritual energy. Compared to when he was cultivating on the ship, his current speed was faster by multiple folds.</p><p>A message appeared on the communication bead which was placed beside him. However, Mo Wuji didn't care about that communication bead but continued to absorb immortal spiritual energy relentlessly.</p><p>It was unknown how much time passed. A vast and strong energy caused all the meridians in Mo Wuji to roar; intense immortal elemental energy and thick spiritual will burst outwards, Mo Wuji suddenly stood up and stretched his limbs.</p><p>After a month behind closed doors, he had finally advanced into the intermediate Golden Immortal Stage. If he were to fight against that Blade Scar Mountain’s Xuan Immortal, he should be able to eliminate that fella more easily.</p><p>Mo Wuji took a look at his communication bead. This Dou Hualong was really dutiful, in just a month, he actually sent more than ten messages.</p><p>The first message was about the gathering of the countless peak geniuses from the seven Immortal Domains, where they would discuss their dao insights. It was at Sharphorn Immortal Ruins Garden; and for this gathering, the worst was already at the Five Star grade. Crowds of rogue cultivators had filled the outside of the garden, all so they could hear some of the geniuses’ discussions.</p><p>The second message was that an Immortal Emperor from Six Paths Immortal Domain had passed by Sharphorn Immortal Ruins, staying at Sharphorn Immortal Ruins for three days.</p><p>The third message was that the third level of the Broken World was going to open; it's rumoured that the Broken World's third level hid large amounts of treasures and resources. The reason why the geniuses had gathered at Sharphorn Immortal Ruins was to go to the Broken World's third level.</p><p>The fourth message was that a Grand Yi Immortal had unknowingly offended a Seven Star Genius from Luo Ling Immortal Domain. As a result, he was killed on site by an expert from Sharphorn Immortal Ruins.</p><p>The fifth message was that a genius cultivator from the devil domain had won 49 battles in a row in Sharphorn Immortal Ruins’ Life-Death Battlestage.</p><p>The sixth message was that the transfer array from the seven Immortal Domains to Sharphorn Immortal Ruin’s Pill Dao Immortal Alliance had been opened. All pill refiners can test their skills at the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance and obtain an acknowledgement of their level. It would last for a period of one month.</p><p>When Mo Wuji saw this message, his heart started pounding. He was now a Tier 4 Immortal Pill King. If he entered the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance, wouldn't he be able to get some status for himself? He would ask Dou Hualong about this later.</p><p>As he thought of this, he immediately sent Dou Hualong a message. Although the later messages weren't very important, Mo Wuji’s impression of Dou Hualong really changed. His expenditure of that 10,000 immortal crystals was really worth it; each message had increased his knowledge and experience.</p><p>This Dou Hualong was intelligent and reliable; his character was also not bad. It was not a bad idea to bring him in.</p><p>Mo Wuji didn't need to wait very long. Just as he changed into a new set of clothes, Dou Hualong had arrived.</p><p>\"Senior is out.\" The moment Dou Hualong arrived, he grinned and clasped his fists.</p><p>Mo Wuji smiled and asked, \"Hualong, how did you come to Sharphorn Immortal Ruins?\"</p><p>Dou Hualong’s eyes turned dim, \"Those years ago, a few seniors thought that I was clever, so they wanted me to help them with some administrative work. They said that Sharphorn Immortal Ruins was filled with opportunity. However, only after I arrived, I found that my cultivation wasn't high enough to enter into space, much less go to the Broken World. I really wanted to go, but I never had many immortal crystals. Ultimately, I can only do some odd jobs around Sharphorn Immortal Ruins.\"</p><p>\"Then what about the people who brought you here?\" Mo Wuji asked.</p><p>Dou Hualong sighed, \"Those seniors said that they were going to the Broken World. However, they have never returned to Sharphorn Immortal Ruins.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji nodded, \"But you can't go on like this. And, you don't even have time to cultivate for yourself. I do have an idea though, why don't you work for me. When I leave Sharphorn Immortal Ruins, I will bring you with me.\"</p><p>Dou Hualong immediately cheered, \"Senior, I’m willing; I’m willing times one million.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji’s suggestion was simply Dou Hualong’s greatest wish. The reason why he was collecting immortal crystals was also because he wanted to leave Sharphorn Immortal Domain. Now that he’s at Sharphorn Immortal Domain, besides going to the Broken World or into space, there was nowhere else he could earn immortal crystals. He, Dou Hualong, wanted power but he didn’t have it; he wanted abilities but he didn’t have that either. Thus, he could only stay at Sharphorn Immortal Domain and do some odd jobs.</p><p>\"My current alias is called Yan Ye. Next time, you don’t have to call me Senior, Big Brother is fine. My real name is Mo Wuji,\" Mo Wuji said.</p><p>Dou Hualong hurriedly said, \"Yes Big Brother. I definitely wouldn’t reveal Big Brother’s real name.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji didn’t really mind. Even if his real name was revealed, it wouldn’t matter much. After all, this wasn’t Yong Ying Immortal Domain. Moreover, he didn’t intend to follow Murong Xiangyu anymore; and he believed that she wouldn’t really mind that either.</p><p>\"Where are you staying now?\"</p><p>\"I’m staying at the corner of an alley. I come out and work during the day,\" Dou Hualong replied awkwardly.</p><p>The rooms in Sharphorn Immortal Domain was incomparably expensive; even the cheapest rooms could not be afforded by people like Dou Hualong.</p><p>Mo Wuji patted Dou Hualong’s shoulder, \"In the future, you can stay with me. There’s a spare room here, you can cultivate in the spare room.\"</p><p>\"Many thanks, Big Brother.\" Dou Hualong was incomparably happy. He had helped Mo Wuji find this room, but in reality, he had never stayed in such an expensive room before.</p><p>Mo Wuji smiled, \"In the future, we are brothers. I still have some brothers that are not here now, I will introduce them to you in the future. Oh right, in your message, you mentioned about the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance. You also talked about the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance’s Pill Dao Pagoda opening, and that it is allowing for the assessment of pill refiners. What’s that about?\"</p><p>During this period of interaction with Mo Wuji, Dou Hualong knew that Mo Wuji wasn’t very clear about this kind of common knowledge. So he explained in a detailed manner, \"Big Brother, this Pill Dao Immortal Alliance is no ordinary place. Even though there are seven Immortal Domains in the Immortal World, the power of the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance is no lesser than the Heavenly Emperor of an Immortal Domain. The Pill Dao Immortal Alliance has encampments in all the Immortal Domains, so being able to earn the recognition of the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance is a huge honour. It’s even more prestigious than being some Star-grade genius.\"</p><p>After a short pause, Dou Hualong continued, \"Moreover, the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance doesn’t prohibit its members from joining other sects. For example, if Big Brother is a pill refiner in the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance, you can still join a big sect.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji rejoiced and immediately said, \"Come, Hualong, let’s immediately go to Sharphorn Immortal Ruins’ Pill Dao Immortal Alliance encampment. I’m ready to get recognised as a pill refiner in the alliance.\"</p><p>\"Big Brother, you’re an Immortal Pill Monarch?\" Dou Hualong stared at Mo Wuji in shock. Immediately, he came to an understanding; if Mo Wuji wasn’t a pill monarch, how could he be so rich? Being able to follow an Immortal Pill Monarch, he, Dou Hualong, had really struck it now.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
