Even if he had something up his sleeves, he shouldn’t use such a method to resolve the problem, right?</p><p>Must one always use the most proper method to solve a problem? However, the moment Mo Wuji's perceived method fails to deter the Void Piercer Treasure Pavilion, then this Mo Wuji was definitely dead.</p><p>By destroying the Void Piercer Treasure Pavilion's stone lion, even if she were to show her face, it would still be hard to keep Mo Wuji in one complete piece.</p><p>…</p><p>\"Who dares cause a ruckus at my Void Piercer Treasure Pavilion?\" A shrill voice cried, and a middle-aged man in khaki immortal robes landed in front of Mo Wuji.?\"</p><p>Even though there were more than ten people at the first floor of Void Piercer Treasure Pavilion now, it was actually incomparably quiet. Some of the customers that were worried about trouble had already ran away; those that didn't run away stood quietly by the side.</p><p>As long as one wasn't a fool, it would be obvious that a huge affair was going to happen today. If the Void Piercer Treasure Pavilion had gotten its face slapped like that and not report it to the higher ups, then they wouldn't have achieved their current state today.</p><p>Mo Wuji sized up the middle-aged man in front of him: goatee, triangle eyes and killing intent hidden in the corner of those eyes. Clearly, this middle-aged man really wanted to kill him immediately, but he managed to resist that thought; this was a tolerant fella.</p><p>Moreover, Mo Wuji believed that this man's cultivation had very likely to have exceeded the Grand Yi Immortal Stage; he might be in the Grand Zhi Immortal Stage or even the Grand Luo Immortal Stage.</p><p>Mo Wuji was sure that he wouldn't be able to beat this person, but he also knew that the other person wouldn't dare to beat him; at least till he reveals his identity.</p><p>\"Ruckus?\" Mo Wuji said indifferently, \"My junior brother was heavily injured here, if no one came forward to help him, then he would have already died here. Today, I'm not here to cause a ruckus. But if I'm not satisfied with your answer, then Void Piercer Treasure Pavilion doesn't need to continue existing in Sharphorn Immortal Ruins.\"</p><p>There was no need to talk about the middle-aged man from Void Piercer Treasure Pavilion, even the spectators at the sides exhaled a breath of cold air. To end the existence of Void Piercer Treasure Pavilion in Sharphorn Immortal Ruins, what kind of power was that?</p><p>The anger within the middle-aged man's heart went up another notch in that mere instant, but he was incredibly calm as he said, \"Since that's the case, let's discuss inside.\"</p><p>He knew why Mo Wuji was here; when Dou Hualong was maimed, he had also seen it. Even Shen Muqing, the person who helped Dou Hualong, didn't dare say such words. What rights did this Golden Immortal in front of him have to dare say that Void Piercer Treasure Pavilion no longer needs to exist?</p><p>It was exactly because it seemed so preposterous that he didn't dare many mistakes. Before he killed Mo Wuji, he would at least need to have a clear understanding.</p><p>Mo Wuji did not even reply him as he simply walked into the treasure pavilion and went up to the second floor. Dou Hualong naturally followed behind Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji also didn't want to have the discussion outside. This was the Sharphorn Immortal Ruins, and he knew a little about the power of the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance here. If he had to cower outside, despite being an elder for the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance, not only would he be disgracing the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance, he would also loss his advantage.</p><p>When he saw that Mo Wuji not only dared to enter but even went up to the second floor, this middle-aged man got increasingly cautious.</p><p>The angrier he was, the more cautious he would be; this was the principle that allowed him to stay so long in the Sharphorn Immortal Ruins.</p><p>There was only one small seal on the room of the second floor; Mo Wuji easily ripped it apart with a lift of his hand and walked in.</p><p>When the middle-aged man saw Mo Wuji's action, he was dumbfounded. Don't underestimate Mo Wuji's action as a mere casual tearing action; it showed that he was definitely an absolute expert when it comes to arrays.</p><p>A fella with such an adept understanding towards arrays, yet does not have a high cultivation could he be from the Immortal Array Alliance? But if this fella was from the Immortal Array Alliance, then his Void Piercer Treasure Pavilion had nothing to fear.</p><p>There were already three people in the room: two young man and a pretty woman. When she saw Mo Wuji casually rip the seal apart, the woman stared at Mo Wuji in shock. Since when was there such a tyrant?</p><p>Mo With didn't even care about the woman. He was an experienced man, he only needed a single glance to tell that the woman wasn't an important figure. It was the two young men, however, that had a startling aura; they had the sort of spiritual aura that could be felt from far away. Mo Wuji guessed that these two men must definitely be those two Seven Star Geniuses, Ao Tiancheng and Cha Kai.</p><p>Mo Wuji's guess was right; these two people were exactly Ao Tiancheng and Cha Kai.</p><p>Seeing Mo Wuji enter so disrespectfully, a hint of killing intent flashed in both Ao Tiancheng’s and Cha Kai's eyes. The two of them were also experienced in concealing their intentions; even though they had killing intent, they didn't act immediately.</p><p>Don't overestimate Ao Tiancheng because he also killed Dou Hualong with a single step; that was because he knew that Dou Hualong was an ant. If Dou Hualong died, then so be it. But if he were to really meet someone of great origins, he wouldn't act like a brainless idiot.</p><p>Mo Wuji had just wrecked Void Piercer Treasure Pavilion's stone lion, and now he even ripped the seal to the second floor room; he should not be a simple person. One must knew that even they wouldn't dare to do such things. Moreover, they did not need to act regarding this matter. How this fella was going to be dealt with was Void Piercer Treasure Pavilion's problem.</p><p>The middle-aged man from Void Piercer Treasure Pavilion also walked in, then he said calmly to Mo Wuji, \"Friend's matter with my Void Piercer Treasure Pavilion doesn't need to be discussed here. Let's talk in the other room.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji stared coldly at the middle-aged man, \"You don't have the rights to negotiate, my junior brother had been injured by one of these two people. You actually say that you don't want to talk here, could it be that you wish to accept their blame? If that's the case, then let's go to the other room.\"</p><p>When he heard Mo Wuji's words, the middle-aged man was almost stunned still. Who was this fella? He hadn't even settled the problem of the stone lion, and now he wanted to offend the two Seven Star Geniuses?</p><p>Regardless who this was, after Mo Wuji said those words, he knew which option would be beneficial for his Void Piercer Treasure Pavilion. He swept his hand and closed the seal; his voice was especially calm as he said, \"What does Sir want?\"</p><p>\"Hahahaha!\" Ao Tiancheng suddenly chortled loudly, but there did not seem to be any bit of humour in his eyes. After laughing for a bit, he slapped the table, \"Where did such a crazy fool come from? That ant behind you was swatted by me, Ao Tiancheng. There's no need to talk about that ant, this old man even dares to swat you.\"</p><p>As he spoke, the table disintegrated into dust. Then, Ao Tiancheng lifted his fist and struck towards Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji did not hesitate to swing the saber on his back, slashing it over.</p><p>\"Boom!\" The fist and the blade scar clashed; immortal elemental energy violently exploded within the room and everyone else in the room hurried to make way.</p><p>\"Crack! Crack!\" Under the pressure of the immortal elemental energy, the seats started to crack and shatter.</p><p>Ao Tiancheng got blasted by the terrifying saber energy. Even though Mo Wuji's saber didn't directly touch his hand, a deep scar actually formed on his fist. Ao Tiancheng retreated a few steps, then dispelled the killing intent in Mo Wuji's blade scar.</p><p>Because Mo Wuji had been storing his power, and had struck with a saber, he was an even match for Ao Tiancheng who only used a fist, despite Ao Tiancheng having the higher cultivation.</p><p>Ao Tiancheng's face changed; Mo Wuji was clearly at the Golden Immortal Stage, but Mo Wuji was not placed at a disadvantage in a head on clash. One must know that he was at the Great Circle of the Xuan Immortal Stage, and even had the Golden Dragon Bloodline.</p><p>If this was a usual situation, he would have already brought out his magic treasure and battled with Mo Wuji. But when he recalled Mo Wuji's words, he actually didn't bring his magic treasure out. He guessed that this Mo Wuji must not be of simple origins.</p><p>When he saw that Ao Tiancheng didn't continue attacking, Mo Wuji coldly snorted. The saber in his hand formed an arc in the air before returning to his back.</p><p>Even a fool, and the middle-aged man from Void Piercer Treasure Pavilion knew that Mo Wuji was not simple, much less a rash fool. Could a simple fella fight with a Great Circle Xuan Immortal with only a Golden Immortal Stage cultivation, and be evenly matched?</p><p>Would a rash idiot have such strong power?</p><p>\"This friend, I am Void Piercer Treasure Pavilion’s Shopkeeper Du Ju, may I know how I can address you?\" The middle-aged man clasped his fists and spoke courteously; his tone was completely different from how he spoke previously. However, he was thinking in his heart that if Mo Wuji wasn't of great origins, he would still send Mo Wuji out in many pieces. But now, his apprehension still outweighed his anger.</p><p>The woman by the side hurriedly swept away the rubbish on the floor, then brought out a new jade table and some jade chairs.</p><p>Mo Wuji did not hesitate to sit on the chair; when Dou Hualong saw that his big brother had already sat down, he followed suit. He had already thought about it, he was determined not bring down his big brother’s might. Especially now that his big brother had sat down like that, that was simply incomparably tyrannical.</p><p>Ao Tiancheng's heart was brewing with killing intent. However, before Du Ju figured Mo Wuji's origins, he was also not going to act. As for Cha Kai, he was previously fighting with Ao Tiancheng over an item, and the one that disciplined Dou Hualong wasn't him. So naturally, he wouldn't battle, he even clasped his fists towards Mo Wuji.</p><p>The woman brought out some jade cups, then poured some tea for everyone.</p><p>Only then did Mo Wuji throw out his jade token, \"Boss Du, take a look. Is my status enough to end your Void Piercer Treasure Pavilion, if it isn't, then I will go change to another one.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji brought out his Pill Dao Immortal Alliance Sharphorn Branch Elder identity token. He believed that he didn't need to use his Headquarter Honorary Elder identity or his Honored Grade Tier 4 Pill King identity for such a small matter.</p><p>The moment Du Ju received the jade token, Cha Kai and Ao Tiancheng sent their spiritual wills over. At this instant, everyone wanted to know what Mo Wuji's identity was.</p><p>\"Elder Mo…\" Du Ju's started pounding heavily. He really wouldn't have thought that Mo Wuji, at such a young age, would be an elder at Pill Dao Immortal Alliance Sharphorn Horn Branch, an authentic elder.</p><p>If Mo Wuji's identity was genuine, then his words about ending Void Piercer Treasure Pavilion in Sharphorn Immortal Ruins really wasn't mere bragging. Even if Void Piercer Treasure Pavilion was any bigger, when placed in front of a leviathan like the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance, it was really nothing but an ant.</p><p>Soon, Du Ju knew that Mo Wuji's identity definitely wasn't fake. If Mo Wuji dared to impersonate an elder of the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance, then he would have been courting death.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
