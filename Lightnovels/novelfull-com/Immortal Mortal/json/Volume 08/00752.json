Mo Wuji believed that if he could enter seclusion for a period of time, he would also be able to reach the Immortal Reverent Stage.</p><p>These two figures were extremely fast. Mo Wuji's spiritual will had only just detected these two and they had already landed in front of Mo Wuji's shop. That Immortal Reverent coldly swept his eyes across Mo Wuji, then he snorted coldly, \"Who dares to disobey the rules?\"</p><p>This thin man bowed, \"Lord Enforcers, this is my shop. I sold it to Mao Hu, and we have previously agreed that this shop would automatically be returned to me if Mao Hu dies…\"</p><p>Mo Wuji's heart sunk; there was actually such an agreement.</p><p>\"I've gotten wind of the tragic news of Mao Hu's death; so I came back to take back the shop which belongs to me. I never expected that someone would come an occupy it first.\" As this thin man finished speaking, he had already retrieved a signed jade letter.</p><p>Mo Wuji's spiritual will landed on that jade letter; it was indeed an agreement with Mao Hu. As he felt the spiritual will energy on that agreement, Mo Wuji knew that this jade letter was not fake.</p><p>The Immortal Reverent Enforcer received the jade letter and scanned it. Thereafter, he stared at Mo Wuji and said coldly, \"You should have heard of the rule that the first person who occupies a shop once the shop owner dies would own the shop, right? Well, let me tell you. Even if this rule exists, you are not qualified. Because only people that have spent a minimum of five years in Heaven's Beyond Corridor City Square can make use of this rule. If I'm not wrong, you haven't even been here for more than a month.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji jolted and he inwardly cursed Lou Si. She actually neglected to inform him of such a critical condition, was she trying to screw him over?</p><p>\"Cripple your dantian, hand over all your belongings and follow us.\" This Immortal Reverent's tone was filled with contempt. This kid didn't even know about the Heaven's Beyond Corridor City Square's rules and he decided to learn from others and snatch for shops.</p><p>Mo Wuji said indifferently, \"Are you saying that I can't purchase this shop? And that I don't have the rights to purchase a shop?\"</p><p>In reality, this was a question that worried Mo Wuji. If there was indeed a rule that restricted the purchase of shops to people who only stayed here for a certain number of years, then he would have to escape from here.</p><p>\"Anyone can purchase shops. As long as you are able to show the title deed that you got from Mao Hu, then this shop would belong to you.\" This time, the one that was speaking was that late stage Immortal King.</p><p>In reality, except for Mo Wuji, everyone else was sure that Mo Wuji would definitely be unable to take out the title deed. Unless there were unique circumstances, who would be willing to sell a shop in Heaven's Beyond Corridor City Square? Mao Hu definitely wouldn't sell the shop before heading to the Cosmos Wall, because the moment the Cosmos Wall opens, every single shop would have a surge in activity.</p><p>Mo Wuji heaved a sigh of relief. Even though he didn't understand the reasons behind Mao Hu's previous actions, the title deed of this shop definitely belonged to him.</p><p>Mo Wuji retrieved the title deed and placed it on the counter, \"This is the title deed of my shop.\"</p><p>Besides Mo Wuji, the other three all sent their spiritual will into the title deed. It had already been three days; so the spiritual will imprint on the title deed had been completely changed to Mo Wuji's.</p><p>When he saw that Mo Wuji had truly purchased this shop, that Immortal Reverent's face turned black. With a quick swipe, he slapped the thin man flying out of the shop and snorted, \"Bring him away.\"</p><p>That thin man was also in aghast, he never expected that Mao Hu would actually dare to sell this shop. However, the spiritual imprint on the title deed could not be faked. Mao Hu had definitely sold the shop.</p><p>\"It was our mistake just now. Since you are the new owner, then you would have to pay for the shop's land occupation fees.\" That Immortal Reverent actually clasped his fists towards Mo Wuji apologetically.</p><p>\"How much for one year?\" Mo Wuji promptly asked.</p><p>This Immortal Reverent startled; usually people paid by the month. Ostensibly, this new shop owner was indeed a newbie. This Immortal Reverent even started to wonder how Mo Wuji was able to sign the title deed. Even though he knew that there was something peculiar in the exchange of the title deed, he didn't ask about it. Such a matter was truly too trivial.</p><p>\"2,000 regulated green crystals for a year.\" The Immortal Reverent Enforcer answered Mo Wuji's question.</p><p>\"Then what about consecutive years?\" Mo Wuji continued asking.</p><p>\"Two years for 3,800 regulated green crystals, three years for 5,300 regulated green crystals…\"</p><p>\"I will pay for three years.\" Mo Wuji did not hesitate to bring out a huge pile of green crystals.</p><p>He knew what regulated green crystals were. Because the green crystals one could obtain within the Cosmos Wall were of different sizes, the city square had a regulated size for easy transaction. When he took out this pile of green crystals, he had already excluded the extremely small ones and broke down the relatively big ones.</p><p>This Immortal Reverent Enforcer jolted slightly. Don't simply see how there were many beautiful and vivid shops in Heaven's Beyond Corridor City Square. He was very clear that there were very few people who could actually take out five to six thousand green crystals at a single go.</p><p>And even those minute number of shop owners that could do that, wouldn't do such a thing. They would use those green crystals to cultivate. After all, raising one's cultivation was the most important thing. This new shop owner clearer hadn't been in Heaven's Beyond Corridor City Square for long, but he was actually able to take out so many green crystals at a single go; this newbie must definitely have some amazing background.</p><p>Mo Wuji had obtained the shop legally. As for the green crystals, no one would really investigate on it.</p><p>This Immortal Reverent kept Mo Wuji's green crystals. Thereafter, he retrieved a jade letter and inscribed the message that he had collected three years' worth of green crystals. He threw it over to Mo Wuji and said, \"This is the proof of collection. There are still some secondary fees, but you can pay them after these three years. As for what happened previously, we have truly disturbed you.\"</p><p>With that, this Immortal Reverent and the Immortal King brought the thin man and sped out of Mo Wuji's shop.</p><p>Mo Wuji heaved a sigh of relief. The reason why he handed three years worth of fees at a single go was because he wanted to enter seclusion. He also didn't expect that things would be so simple. If he knew that the title deed was so powerful, he wouldn't have wasted his words and simply flashed it out.</p><p>However, Mo Wuji soon calmed down. He had finally found himself a place to rest his feet. The first thing he was going to do wasn't to actually sell anything. Instead, he was going to close his shop and start his secluded cultivation.</p><p>Knowing that no one would be able to snatch his shop away, Mo Wuji started to install a stronger killing array and a more powerful defensive array. At the same time, he also sealed the reporting talisman at the entrance of his shop. He didn't need to report anything to the enforcers; he only needed to cultivate.</p><p>During this period of time, the entire Heaven's Beyond Corridor City Square was bustling with activity. The Cosmos Wall had just closed and many immortals brought their spoils to trade in the city square.</p><p>In the entire Heaven's Beyond Corridor City Square, there was only one shop that was not open for business. That was Mo Wuji's magic treasure shop.</p><p>…</p><p>Multiple days later, Mo Wuji had finished installing his various defensive seals. This was when he returned to his room and started to organise his spoils.</p><p>During this period, Mo Wuji's greatest gains were the six pages of the Book of Luo. He needed to refine these six pages as soon as possible. Mo Wuji knew that the higher his cultivation, the faster he would take to refine the Book of Luo. Thus, he would only start refining the Book of Luo after he had finished his cultivation.</p><p>Except for the six pages of the Book of Luo, there was also the Kun Wu Sword. Mo Wuji also intended to refine the Kun Wu Sword after this cultivation session.</p><p>In this place where experts were born easily, his cultivation was simply garbage.</p><p>Mo Wuji also took out his gains from the Cosmos Wall. Because he went the highest in the Cosmos Wall, Mo Wuji obtained the best of the resources. Thus, he had no fewer than a hundred thousand green crystal fragments. He also had plenty of Tier 7 to Tier 9 immortal herbs. Except for those that were close to extinct, or those that were extremely valuable, such as the Undying Holy Bamboo and the Emperor Dao Fruit, he basically had all the other varieties of immortal herbs. There were even some immortal herbs that Mo Wuji didn't recognise.</p><p>As for smithing materials and ores, there was an even more eclectic range of them. Similar to his immortal herbs, he only lacked the rarest materials. Lastly, he had come to magic treasures. The magic treasure that elated him the most was a flying ship.</p><p>He felt that this flying ship's grade exceeded Grade 9. It was just that the smith's skill did not seem up to mark; so it seemed to barely reach Grade 9. However, Mo Wuji guessed that if he handed this flying ship's materials to Xu Suren, he might actually be able to forge a flying ship that transcended the immortal grade.</p><p>After organising all these items, Mo Wuji took out his pill furnace and started concocting pills. Before he started cultivation, he needed to adequately prepare himself.</p><p>Another month passed. Mo Wuji installed a spirit concealment array, then he retrieved a pile of green crystals and multiple vases of pills. He prepared to go all out and cultivate. If he didn't raise his cultivation, then he couldn't do anything else.</p><p>If he was an Immortal Emperor, why would he stay cooped up here in Heaven's Beyond City Square? He would directly go take a look at the human race district.</p><p>Mo Wuji had gotten his hands on some green crystals before. These were the fuel for Da Huang. This entire time, he really wanted to use the green crystals to cultivate, but he couldn't bear to do it. Now that he had 100,000 green crystals, he could finally cultivate as he wished.</p><p>With his reverse circulation of his Immortal Mortal Technique, coupled with the brimming energy within the green crystals, his 108 minor circulations merged to form a major circulation in almost an instant. When this happened, the rich energy within the green crystals were furiously sucked out by Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji immediately felt the difference. It was as he had predicted; not only was the immortal spiritual energy within the crystal of a higher purity, it even contained a more distinct heavenly dao energy.</p><p>In less than 10 days, Mo Wuji felt his cultivation breaking through to the intermediate Immortal King Stage. Not only that, he felt that his understandings towards his sacred arts had reached a new level.</p><p>\"Crack!\" Following his breakthrough, multiple green crystals reduced into dust.</p><p>Even though Mo Wuji was a Tier 8 Pill Emperor, and Ping Fan was extremely rich in immortal spiritual energy, he still wouldn't have been able to advance to the intermediate Immortal King Stage in a matter of days. He would need years or even decades. But the first time he used green crystals to cultivate, he only needed a few days to break past the early Immortal King Stage and enter the intermediate stage. Moreover, he didn't even use a single pill.</p><p>Feeling the heaven-defying effects of the green crystals, Mo Wuji took out another pile of green crystals with greater fervour. The green crystals were furiously sucked dry. As time passed, Mo Wuji's cultivation also rose rapidly.</p><p>Immortal King Intermediate Stage Pinnacle, Great Circle…</p><p>Advanced to Immortal King Late Stage!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
