Indeed, the human race were fighting against the demon race. As for the other races, some fought on the side of the human race, while others battled on the side of the demons. The entire battlefield was a mess; it resembled a scene from Hell.</p><p>Indeed, there would be a war every time the Cosmos Wall opens. Just as Mo Wuji thought of this, a powerful force landed on his back, dragging him back into the battlefield.</p><p>Before Mo Wuji could even examine what was the force that was on his back, several beams of light shot towards him. Mo Wuji could only wield his Half Moon Weighted Halberd and block against these light. However, he didn't have any intentions of counterattacking.</p><p>If it was just a few people, then he could just kill them. However, there were countless of experts here, they numbered the tens of thousands; it was impossible for him to kill them all. Moreover, he had killed cultivators from both the human race and the demon race; so he didn't belong to either side. To be honest, even he didn't know how the two races were able to distinguish each other.</p><p>Mo Wuji tried his best to stay at the edge of the battlefield. In a short period of time, he finally saw through it. The immortals on the side of the human race had a faint yellow aura circulating around them. Mo Wuji paid special attention to one particular human race cultivator; every time this cultivator kills a demon race cultivator, a mark would form on the jade bracelet on his wrist. Depending on how strong the demon race cultivator he killed was, the energy behind that mark would vary.</p><p>On the other hand, the demon race cultivators had a faint green colour around them, and they also had a similar jade bracelet on their wrists.</p><p>Clearly, there would be rewards depending on the degree of the marks on the bracelets. Mo Wuji didn't have any bracelet; so he was even less willing to take part in this war</p><p>Mo Wuji retreated to the edge in self preservation. At the same time, he started to looking out for immortals that didn't have jade bracelets.</p><p>After some time, he finally found a cultivator without a bracelet like him. This cultivator was also retreating to a corner. Unfortunately, he was actually surrounded by cultivators from both the human and demon race. Within instants, he was killed.</p><p>Mo Wuji discovered that killing the human race cultivator that killed this person actually had two new marks on his bracelet. Moreover, the energy within these two marks was very strong.</p><p>An additional mark was actually rewarded. From the looks of it, this war didn't allow those that didn't belong to either side to exist.</p><p>Mo Wuji started to feel the aura around himself; it was actually yellow with a tinge of green. This meant that he had killed both human and demon cultivators. Anyone that killed him would receive twice the rewards.</p><p>Indeed, just as Mo Wuji became cognizant of this fact, a few waves of killing intent surged towards him. At this moment, he would be a fool if he continued to fight. He did not hesitate to flee.</p><p>When the cultivators that attacked Mo Wuji saw him disappear, they didn't chase after him.</p><p>It was just that when Mo Wuji came to a stop, more attacks came over. Mo Wuji cursed in his heart, he knew it would be hard for him to rest during this war. Fortunately, he had his Wind Escape Technique and his Spatial Teleportation. Otherwise, he could only die once he was surrounded.</p><p>At this moment, Mo Wuji finally understood why this place didn't allow flight; it was to prevent people from escaping. At the same time, he became clear about what had prevented him from leaving; it should have been a trap array. This trap array was rather peculiar, it seemed to appear because of the Cosmos Wall.</p><p>If he guessed correctly, this trap array would only disappear when this war ends. Before this war ends, all those that took part in the pillage of the Cosmos Wall must take part in the war.</p><p>No wonder one must join a side in the Heaven's Beyond Corridor. If not, it would be extremely hard to survive in such a war. Even though he had his spirit storage channel and his elemental storage channel, as well as a whole pile of healing drugs, this constant state of fleeing was exhausting him greatly.</p><p>Unfortunately, he hadn't know of these rules. If an average person knew of these rules, they would probably hide within Heaven's Beyond Corridor City Square and not take part in the pillage, right? But to Mo Wuji, he would still come even if he knew the rules. The benefits from the Cosmos Wall were truly overwhelming.</p><p>The messy war got messier. There was no order or war tactics; everyone simply engaged in mutual slaughter.</p><p>If he was an observer that didn't understand the reason behind this war, Mo Wuji would definitely have looked toward them with disdain. This war was simply a low-level one; everyone was basically fighting individually and their killing intents were directed everywhere.</p><p>However, the current Mo Wuji definitely wouldn't look at this war with disdain. Because, he knew that this war could only be like that. Everyone was only in this messy battle because of the pillage of the Cosmos Wall. This war wasn't really a battle between two sides; it was just a random collection of people fighting for themselves. It was completely impossible for there to be war tactics.</p><p>Moreover, the purpose of this war wasn't victory, but survival and cultivation resources. The selfishness of cultivators was on full display in this war.</p><p>The war lasted for an entire day. Mo Wuji was thoroughly drenched in sweat. Even though he didn't kill a single person, his difficulty was at least a hundredfold more than others. During this entire war, he didn't get to stop and rest; he could only flee constantly.</p><p>If he rested for even a moment, he would be drawn into battle. If not for his God Physique, the magic treasure light that constantly brushed against him would have already left his entire body filled with scars.</p><p>Seeing the people retreat in two directions, Mo Wuji knew that both sides were equally matched. He also hurriedly retreated in the direction of the city square.</p><p>It was just as Mo Wuji had expected. The moment the war ended, the trap array that confined him had disappeared without a trace. He was able to easily leave the area.</p><p>Mo Wuji heaved a sigh of relief as he increased his speed. If not for his spirit storage channel, his elemental storage channel and his God Physique, he would have either died or suffered devastating injuries.</p><p>At this moment, a human race man in earthen robes stared at the direction that Mo Wuji disappeared in and frowned. Mo Wuji's aura was both yellow and green; ostensibly, Mo Wuji had killed cultivators from both sides. This wasn't what surprised him. What surprised him was that a person like Mo Wuji, who didn't have a bracelet, was actually able to survive to the end of the war.</p><p>Supposedly, those without bracelets and didn't belong to a side were the fastest to die. Unfortunately, by the time this fella noticed Mo Wuji, the war had already ended. Thus, he didn't know that Mo Wuji had an amazing Wind Escape Technique. If he did, he might have actually chased after Mo Wuji.</p><p>â€¦</p><p>By the time Mo Wuji reached Heaven's Beyond Corridor City Square, he found that there were only a few people there. Mo Wuji immediately headed towards that magic treasure shop. He had already killed the shop owner. Even if he didn't have the title deed, it should still belong to him if he was the first to occupy it.</p><p>The first thing that Mo Wuji did was to completely remove all the arrays protecting this shop, and replace them with a new one. Just when he was about to complete his array, he heard sounds of chatter gradually getting louder. Mo Wuji knew that the main batch of people that went to the Cosmos Wall had returned.</p><p>Before Mo Wuji could use the defensive array to seal the shop, the shop's doors were struck open.</p><p>\"Who are you?\" The person at the door was a relatively thin man. He stared and frowned towards Mo Wuji.</p><p>\"This shop has already changed owners. I am the new owner of this shop,\" Mo Wuji said indifferently. This thin man was only in the early Immortal King Stage, this was even weaker than the previous shop owner. Mo Wuji really didn't place such a person in his eyes.</p><p>The thin man stared at Mo Wuji for quite some time, then he suddenly chuckled, \"You want to make use of Mao Hu's death to occupy this shop?\"</p><p>Mo Wuji thought in his heart: This was really my intention.</p><p>\"Let me give you some advice. Leave now, otherwise, you won't be able to escape with your life.\" Seemingly seeing his words were exactly the case, this thin man did not even wait for Mo Wuji to say anything before he said that coldly.</p><p>Even though Mo Wuji didn't really understand the rules here, he wasn't going to simply give the place that he would be living in away. After battling in the desert wasteland battlefield, Mo Wuji had a faint feeling that the battlefield was a strange place. It might actually be dangerous for him to enter the battlefield alone.</p><p>\"I will give you three breaths of time to leave my shop. Otherwise, don't blame me for laying hands on you.\" Mo Wuji's tone also became cold. This was clearly a place where the strong preyed on the weak. Without power, this fella could kneel on the floor and it would still be useless.</p><p>This thin man swept his gaze across Mo Wuji disdainfully, then he suddenly placed his hand on a talisman that was at the entrance of the shop.</p><p>Mo Wuji immediately felt slight ripples in space. He immediately understood what happened, that should have been a talisman that was used to alarm the enforcers. He actually didn't notice it previously.</p><p>Indeed, two figures soon sped over. One of them was an early stage Immortal Reverent, while the other was a late stage Immortal King.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
