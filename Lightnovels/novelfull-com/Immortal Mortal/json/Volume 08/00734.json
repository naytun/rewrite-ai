This was the most well-known site for gathering in Sharphorn Immortal Ruins. Here, not only was it spacious and beautiful, the environment was also very good.</p><p>At this instant, a grand open-air hall had been constructed in Sharphorn Immortal Garden.</p><p>By the time Mo Wuji and Wei Zidao entered Sharphorn Immortal Garden, there were already many people there. Everyone formed their own groups and engaged in their own conversations; some of them were gossiping, while others were catching up with old friends.</p><p>Mo Wuji's name had spread throughout the Immortal World; there were many here that knew of him. However, there weren't any that came to greet him.</p><p>\"Pill Master Mo, long time no see.\" A light and clear voice could be heard. Mo Wuji was slightly confused, someone actually dared to greet him?</p><p>When he turned and saw who it was, he came to an understanding. It was Qing Yang of the Green Immortal House. The Green Immortal House was a major power in the Immortal World, and Qing Yang herself was an absolute expert. Moreover, her daughter, Qing Ruoyue, had been selected by the Very High Heavens. Thus, no one would shun her merely because she came to greet Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji also recognised the girl by Qing Yang's side; it was Mo Xianmo. Even though they both shared the same surname, Mo Wuji did not have any favourable impression towards this Mo Xianmo.</p><p>\"It really is. Long time no see. It seems like House Lord Qing's cultivation has reached another level. That's truly worth celebrating,\" Mo Wuji smiled and said.</p><p>He was very clear that the reason why Qing Yang came to greet him wasn't because their relationship was close. It was because she was clever and quick-witted; she viewed Mo Wuji's attainments in the Pill Dao highly, and she also knew that there wouldn't be any repercussions from greeting Mo Wuji, only benefits.</p><p>\"Aunt Qing…\" Another sweet voice could be heard. Thereafter, two beautiful young girls walked over.</p><p>The young girl in front was not only pretty, she looked innocent and guileless. She gave the impression of a kind-hearted and honest girl. Moreover, with her petite and beautiful looks, anyone would feel tenderness towards her.</p><p>When Mo Wuji laid his eyes on this girl, his killing intent surged and he almost wanted to kill the young girl. Fortunately, he managed to control his killing intent and he turned to face the girl behind her.</p><p>This girl had slightly thick eyebrows, but her looks weren't bad. In between her thick brows, there seemed to be some wrinkles.</p><p>\"Mei Mei, Nini, it's been a long time since I saw the two of you. I never thought that your cultivations would improve so greatly,\" Qing Yang smiled and said.</p><p>\"My cultivation hasn't improved much. Mei Mei, on the other hand, has seen tremendous improvements in her cultivation,\" The girl with the slightly wild eyebrows said.</p><p>Mo Wuji knew that this girl was right. When he first saw this Mei Mei, she was just at the early Grand Yi Immortal Stage. But now, she was already at the intermediate Grand Zhi Immortal Stage. Even Nine Star Geniuses wouldn't have such a rapid improvement. Besides Lei Hongji, this Mei Mei probably had the fastest cultivation among the people he knew.</p><p>As she continued to converse with the two girls, Qing Yang suddenly felt as though she was being too cold to Mo Wuji. She hurriedly turned to Mo Wuji and said, \"Pill Master Mo, these two are Immortal Universe Sword School's Wu Mei and Tian Nini…\"</p><p>\"Aunt Yi, compared to those geniuses, I'm still lacking.\" That innocent looking young girl hurriedly said with a blushing face. After that, she fiddled with her dress uneasily, seemingly too shy to face Mo Wuji.</p><p>Qing Yang snickered, 'Mei Mei, you are going to leave the school soon. You need to be more open. Let me introduce the two of you, this is Pill Master Mo, he is a Pill Emperor. If Ruoyue hadn't been chosen to go to the Very High Heavens, I would have introduced Ruoyue to Pill Emperor Mo…\"</p><p>As she said this, Qing Yang seemed to recall something. Her gaze went across Mo Wuji and Wu Mei multiple times, then she said with a joking tone, \"Pill Master Mo, not only is Wu Mei beautiful, she is also a Six Star Genius. How about I introduce Mei Mei to you?\"</p><p>Mo Wuji didn't say anything, he only noticed that the thick-browed girl behind Wu Mei had an ugly expression on her face.</p><p>'Aunt Qing…\" Wu Mei cried out softly, her head lowered even more and the blush in her cheeks extended up to her ears.</p><p>Mo Wuji sneered, \"Even if I, Mo Wuji, have to be a bachelor all my life, I wouldn't want this sort of woman.\"</p><p>Wu Mei's rose-red face turned pale white in an instant. Tears began to gather at the corner of her eyes and one even threatened to drop.</p><p>Qing Yang's face turned ugly. She wanted to befriend Mo Wuji because of his potential. But her Green Immortal House was not desperate to befriend Mo Wuji; the Green Immortal House had their own pride. Mo Wuji could choose not to befriend them, but he didn't need to reject her in such a roundabout manner.</p><p>These words not only harmed a young girl's pride, it even made the Green Immortal House look like a laughing stock.</p><p>If not for the fact that she wanted to maintain her demeanour and that she didn't want to create an enmity with Mo Wuji, she would have immediately turned and left.</p><p>At this instant, Qing Yang finally understood why Mo Wuji had so many enemies. It would be weird if an arrogant and supercilious person like him didn't make many enemies. She wasn't a fussy person, but if it was anyone else, Mo Wuji would probably have formed a new enemy.</p><p>\"Wow, Pill Master Mo is so awe-inspiring. Not only does he plot against his benefactor, he also bullies the weak.\" A sneer sounded. Thereafter, a handsome man with a jade-like complexion came over.</p><p>What left Mo Wuji sighing in praise was that this fella already had a Quasi-Emperor cultivation despite not looking very old.</p><p>\"Senior Uncle, Pill Master Mo shouldn't be that kind of person…\" Before Mo Wuji could say anything, a young girl that was standing behind this handsome man interjected.</p><p>Mo Wuji immediately came to an understanding. This fella was from Gods Immortal Sect, no wonder why this fella would find him displeasing.</p><p>Rumours had been spreading throughout the Immortal World that Gods Immortal Sect's Ling Lunan had saved him, but Mo Wuji turned against Ling Lunan. However, only he knew the truth; he had never betrayed Ling Lunan. In fact, he had tried to find ways to save Ling Lunan. Unfortunately, his abilities were limited.</p><p>As for the girl that tried to defend him, Mo Wuji also recognised her. She was Nai He.</p><p>Back when he first saw her in the cultivation world, he didn't even have the power to resist her. But now, he was already an Immortal King, while she was still a late stage Grand Yi Immortal.</p><p>Comparatively, Nai He's cultivation speed was quite fast. But even if it was any faster, it really couldn't compare to his. Up till now, Mo Wuji only knew of one person who had a faster cultivation speed than him, that person was Lei Hongji. Oh, that's not right, there's this Mei Mei too. Even though her cultivation speed might not be faster than his, she was able to advance to the intermediate Grand Zhi Immortal Stage from the early Grand Yi Immortal Stage in just her few years. It was an exceptional and impressive speed.</p><p>Mo Wuji soon came to an understanding. This woman definitely had a huge secret. Otherwise, her improvement wouldn't be so rapid.</p><p>\"What do you know? Others might fear this Mo Wuji, but my Gods Immortal Sect isn't one of them,\" This handsome man said angrily.</p><p>Thereafter, this handsome man stared at Mo Wuji and said, \"Mo Wuji, if I had evidence, I would have already killed you.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji shook his head. On account of Ling Lunan, he wasn't going to care about this fella.</p><p>Qing Yang looked at the sulking Wu Mei and snorted, \"Pill Master Mo is indeed exceptional, but you need to consider the feelings of others. If you do not like my suggestion, you could have said it directly. Why must you be so overbearing and hurtful?\"</p><p>If it was anyone else, Mo Wuji definitely wouldn't have used such a tone, even if he didn't like it. It was just that this Wu Mei killed her friend that was genuinely trying to help her. This caused Mo Wuji to recall his tragic past. It could be said that he was thoroughly disgusted by such a woman.\"</p><p>\"House Lord Qing doesn't know what this woman had done, so you would find my words inappropriate.\" The reason why Mo Wuji chose to explain himself was that he felt Qing Yang was a person worth befriending, albeit her character of basing everything on benefits. For the sake of Ping Fan, even if he couldn't make friends, he shouldn't create enemies.</p><p>Qing Yang frowned, \"Pill Master Mo, Mei Mei doesn't like complicated things. Even speaking to a man causes her to blush. What kind of thing would she have done?\"</p><p>If Mo Wuji had admitted his mistake, she would still consider Mo Wuji a possible friend. But now that Mo Wuji actually tried to find an excuse, she had completely lost her respect for Mo Wuji. Even though 99% of the people in the world could never be as capable as Mo Wuji, his character was severely lacking.</p><p>Mo Wuji shot a glance towards the frightened girl and he said indifferently, \"If I had such a woman as my dao companion, I would be worried that I might get stabbed in the back when I'm helping her to concoct pills…\"</p><p>When Mo Wuji said this, he recalled his plight and his heart became filled with anger. Until now, he still didn't understand why Xia Ruoyin would want to stab him in the back.</p><p>It was exactly because of this, that he was full of killing intent when he saw Wu Mei backstab that Senior Brother Tian that wanted to help her.</p><p>When she heard Mo Wuji's words, Wu Mei's hands started to tremble. Shock filled her heart. She was sure that no one was there when she killed Tian Zhongfu. How did this Mo Wuji know about it? Could he have been there? That's not possible, she definitely wouldn't have committed such a low-level mistake.</p><p>Wu Mei suddenly started to sob, covering her face as she tried to leave.</p><p>Qing Yang went ahead and grabbed her. She then turned and looked at Mo Wuji coldly, \"Pill Master Mo, you can't go about spouting nonsense. I admit that you are strong. However, Wu Mei is my distant niece. If you don't give me a proper explanation, even if I don't do anything, the Immortal Universe Sword School definitely would.\"</p><p>Considering Mo Wuji's status and reputation, she didn't directly ask Mo Wuji to apologize.</p><p>A raspy voice suddenly resounded, \"That's right. If Pill Master Mo doesn't offer a suitable explanation, my Immortal Universe Sword School might not be comparable to Pill Master Mo, but I definitely wouldn't let things go. Let me introduce myself, I am the head of Immortal Universe Sword School, Qu Cang.\"</p><p>The person who came over was a white-haired elder. Even though his voice was raspy and hoarse, Mo Wuji only needed a single glance to tell that he was an early stage Immortal Emperor. From the looks of it, this Immortal Universe Sword School was not bad, it actually had an Immortal Emperor.</p><p>Mo Wuji really wanted to kill Wu Mei, but he didn't want to offend the Immortal Universe Sword School. He only said calmly, \"Back when I was at the third level of the Broken World, I personally saw this Mei Mei betray her senior brother that was trying to search for a healing pill for her. Back then, she called him 'Brother Tian'. Thus, I only know that her senior brother has the surname 'Tian'. I don't know anything else. I especially detest such women who portray themselves as angels when they have the hearts of demons.\"</p><p>Everyone suddenly went silent. After some time, that girl called Tian Nini stared at Wu Mei in astonishment and muttered, \"My brother was killed by you? Why? Why…\"</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
