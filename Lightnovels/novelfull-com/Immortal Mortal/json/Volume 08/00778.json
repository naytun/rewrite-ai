We are going to pass by Heaven’s Beyond City Square.\"</p><p>He wasn’t able to do anything to the other shops, but he could rake in some money from Mifei Pill-Smith Pavilion. After 20 years of secluded cultivation, he was left with not more than 2 million green crystals. He would need a larger sum of green crystals in case he discovered something good in Heaven’s Beyond Cosmos.</p><p>\"My lord is truly wise…\" Hearing his suggestion immediately get accepted, Shuai Guo was so contented that its butt almost seemed to float towards the Heavens.</p><p>However, Mo Wuji’s following words instantly plunged it back into Hell, \"Shuai Guo, I’ve thought about it. During this trip, it’s best not to expose you. You will stay in the Undying World. I will bring you out once I reach Heaven’s Beyond Cosmos.\"</p><p>\"Ah…\" Shuai Guo was instantly dumbfounded. It was so rare for it to be able to show its majesty and might and it had even thought of such an amazing idea; to think that his lord actually wouldn’t let him out and play. \"My lord, when we get to Heaven’s Beyond City Square, I will suck anyone that dares to oppose us dry. The moment lord’s grand halberd appears, those Immortal Emperors would be scared sh*tless. I can cheer and holler for my lord at the back…\"</p><p>\"Stop it with your nonsense. Hurry and go back in. Otherwise, I will have to consider not bringing you to Heaven’s Beyond Cosmos.\"</p><p>When it heard that Mo Wuji threaten to not bring it to Heaven’s Beyond Cosmos, how could Shuai Guo dare to continue with his nonsense? Even though his discontentment was enough to fill three oceans and four seas, it didn’t dare to show it in front of its lord. It could only say anxiously, \"My lord, I suddenly feel that there’s nothing fun at Heaven’s Beyond City Square. I think I will only come out once we reach Heaven’s Beyond Cosmos. My lord, I think you should send me back to the Undying World. Even though my cultivation is already plenty impressive, I think I should continue to work hard, then I can be of greater help…\"</p><p>Mo Wuji didn’t even wait for Shuai Guo to finish speaking as he directly sent Shuai Guo into the Undying World. Naturally, he understood the meaning behind Shuai Guo’s words; it was telling him not to forget to bring it out when they reached Heaven’s Beyond Cosmos.</p><p>Mo Wuji wasn’t specifically picking on Shuai Guo. It was just that he believed that if he was going to Heaven’s Beyond Cosmos, he could not directly reveal his identity when he goes to rob Mifei Pill-Smith Pavilion.</p><p>Even though Mifei Trade Union had encircled and attacked him those years ago, if he wanted to get rich, it was best if he didn’t give such information to his opponent. When he got to Heaven’s Beyond Cosmos, he could publicly confront Mifei Trade Union. However, he definitely couldn’t let others know that he had already robbed Mifei Pill-Smith Pavilion before that. By then, even though everyone could guess that he, Mo Wuji, was the one that robbed Mifei Pill-Smith Pavilion, he had to be the one on the moral high ground.</p><p>No matter how impressive he was, he was only one person. In Heaven’s Beyond Cosmos, there would definitely be plenty of Grand Emperors. Perhaps he could defeat one or two, but could he defeat a whole group of them? As long as he didn’t reveal that he was the one that robbed Mifei Pill-Smith Pavilion, other powers would turn a blind eye to his actions.</p><p>Somethings are known by everyone, but he had to give everyone an excuse to act like they didn’t know.</p><p>…</p><p>Heaven’s Beyond City Square. The traces of that huge battle had already disappeared as the city square got rebuilt.</p><p>Disguising himself as a thin man with his Dry Wimple Pill, Mo Wuji walked into the city square. With a scan of his spiritual will, Mo Wuji soon discovered that his Mortal Pill House had been rebuilt. What left him confused was that the shop actually hadn’t been sold.</p><p>According to the rules in Heaven’s Beyond City Square, the City Hall would reclaim the shop if the shop owner doesn’t return for three years. Mo Wuji guessed that the reason why his shop hadn’t been sold to a new owner should be due to Teng Feiyan. Teng Feiyan probably wanted to befriend him, and it wasn’t a huge loss to the City Hall to leave a shop without an owner.</p><p>But if Mo Wuji ever did return, then they would have done him a huge favour.</p><p>Mo Wuji didn’t return back to his shop. Instead, he headed straight for Mifei Pill-Smith Pavilion. Now that Mortal Pill House was out of the picture, Mifei Pill Smith Pavilion’s business was not bad. The moment Mo Wuji walked into the shop, he started listening out for news. Apparently, the Cosmos Wall had just opened a year ago.</p><p>\"I have a supreme treasure that I wish to trade. I wonder if the Pavilion Head is present?\" Thereafter, Mo Wuji went to speak to an attendant of the shop.</p><p>\"Take the thing out for me to see,\" The attendant said unhurriedly.</p><p>In Heaven’s Beyond City Square, treasures were commonplace. Even Tier 9 immortal herbs and Grade 9 smithing materials were frequently seen. There definitely wasn’t a treasure that was extremely out of the ordinary. Even though Mo Wuji might call it a supreme treasure, this attendant believed that it was probably nothing more than some Grade 9 immortal item.</p><p>\"Pa!\" Mo Wuji slapped the sales counter, directly turning the counter to dust, \"Insolence! A mere attendant like you has the rights to see this Reverent’s treasure?\"</p><p>Even though Mifei Pill-Smith Pavilion had lost several Immortal Emperors in the battle 20 years ago, it still retained its might. Someone actually dared to behave so arrogantly in Mifei Pill-Smith Pavilion? Although the City Hall was very powerful, it only got Mifei Pill-Smith to compensate for the materials used to rebuild the city square, and nothing else.</p><p>Thus, this attendant was stunned by Mo Wuji’s arrogance. Even the battle between Mortal Pill House’s Mo Wuji and Mifei Pill-Smith Pavilion had been incited by Mifei’s Pavilion Head. This was the first time that this attendant saw someone openly challenging them.</p><p>Some of the other customers also got a fright when this happened. However, they soon regained their countenance as they left the shop excitedly. They prepared themselves to watch a good show.</p><p>Which one of the immortals in Heaven’s Beyond Corridor was afraid of death? Which one of them wasn’t a tenacious person who survived countless of wars under the Cosmos Wall? Naturally, they weren’t afraid as they waited for the exciting show to unfold.</p><p>\"What galls, you actually dare to cause a ruckus in my Mifei Pill-Smith Pavilion. I, Yu Xing, want to see exactly how hard your bones are.\" With a cold snort, a scholarly man suddenly appeared in the room. He had already discerned that this thin man was merely an early stage Immortal Reverent.</p><p>Mo Wuji knew that the previous Pavilion Head was a late stage Immortal Reverent called Min Cheng. However, this person in front of him was an early stage Immortal Emperor. It didn’t take long for Mo Wuji to know what was going on. Because of what happened those years ago, Min Cheng was probably punished. And afraid that another issue would happen, Mifei Trade Union dispatched an early stage Immortal Emperor to be the new Pavilion Head for Mifei Pill-Smith Pavilion. Clearly, Mifei Trade Union had learnt some lessons from what happened those years ago.</p><p>\"I'm here to trade…\" Mo Wuji didn't even finish speaking before an immense Immortal Emperor aura pressed down against him. He seemed to be unable to utter another word.</p><p>Yu Xing snorted coldly, \"No matter who you are, no matter what's your purpose, there's only one path for those who dare to cause trouble in my Mifei Pill-Smith Pavilion - Death…\"</p><p>Mo Wuji struggled to throw his jade box over and forced his words, \"I will compensate for the damage. First, take a look at what's inside…\"</p><p>A hint of contempt emerged in the corner of Yu Xing’s eyes. However, the moment his spiritual will entered the jade box, his heart started to dance in excitement. He swept his hand and the jade box disappeared without a trace.</p><p>\"You're stealing my item?\" Mo Wuji's expression changed drastically.</p><p>\"Haha, my Mifei Pill-Smith Pavilion would steal your useless item? Since a mere ant like you dares to cause trouble in my Mifei Pill-Smith Pavilion, you naturally have to be punished.\" The rage within Yu Xing's heart had long changed into elation; he didn't think that Mo Wuji would actually bring out a primal fire crystal.</p><p>Thereafter, a violent Immortal Emperor Domain enveloped Mo Wuji, sealing the space around him.</p><p>Anyone that could survive in Heaven's Beyond Corridor wasn't an idiot. Who couldn't figure out that the treasure within Mo Wuji's jade box was far from simple? If it was an average item, Yu Xing wouldn't even have thought of taking that jade box away.</p><p>Even though everyone tacitly understood what was going on, none of them uttered a word.</p><p>Mo Wuji sneered. Even though he could simply rob Mifei openly, he had developed the habit of finding an excuse.</p><p>His powerful whirlpool domain instantly appeared; the space around them directly went still. Standing right at the centre of this space, Yu Xing’s face changed. He exactly what was going on; his Immortal Emperor Domain was actually being grinded inch by inch. The pressure of impending doom loomed over him.</p><p>\"Stop…\" Yu Xing only managed to utter a single word before he was suppressed by a boundless pressure. By this time, if he still didn't know that Mo Wuji was a tiger acting like a pig, then he was the real pig.</p><p>\"Bang!\" Yu Xing's domain directly shattered. A burst of violent immortal elemental energy directly exploded beside him.</p><p>Within the fog of blood, Mo Wuji grabbed a storage ring.</p><p>\"Boom! Boom! Boom!\" Immortal elemental energy started to explode within Mifei Pill-Smith Pavilion. Several deacons and attendants were directly slaughtered by Mo Wuji, and all of their rings were swept away.</p><p>By the time Heaven's Beyond City Hall Deacon Lang Bi arrived, there were only ruins left of Mifei Pill-Smith Pavilion.</p><p>Everyone saw it clearly; Mo Wuji had come here to rob Mifei Pill-Smith Pavilion. Even though Mo Wuji had taken out a treasure which incited Yu Xing's greed, it was unable to hide the reality that Mo Wuji had intentionally come to rob the place.</p><p>It had been a long time since Mo Wuji left, but the spectators still had expressions of astonishment on their faces. An Immortal Emperor was actually killed in a single move? Could that fella be a Grand Emperor? Or could he even be an existence as powerful as the Dao Emperor?</p><p>…</p><p>By this time, Mo Wuji had already reverted back to his original appearance. With Shuai Guo perched on his Half Moon Weighted Halberd, they sped towards Heaven's Beyond Human Corridor.</p><p>Even though Mo Wuji didn't bring it out to wreck havoc onto Mifei Pill-Smith Pavilion, Shuai Guo was plenty happy that it could leave the Undying World.</p><p>\"My lord, now that you had just destroyed Mifei Pill-Smith Pavilion, I'm afraid that people would be able to guess if you immediately went to Heaven's Beyond Cosmos.\" Perched on the Half Moon Weighted Halberd, Shuai Guo tried hard to make itself sound important.</p><p>\"You think that people wouldn't know if I delay my trip to Heaven's Beyond Cosmos?\" Mo Wuji retorted.</p><p>He already knew that his action was equivalent to stealing a bell with earbuds on. [1] No matter when he headed over to Heaven's Beyond Cosmos, everyone would guess that he was the one that did it.</p><p>Mo Wuji was very pleased with his gains from robbing Mifei Pill-Smith Pavilion. Just from that Yu Xing's storage ring alone, he obtained approximately three million green crystals. Mo Wuji guessed that this was Mifei Pill-Smith Pavilion's fortune, and not Yu Xing's personal fortune. Even so, Mo Wuji did not care. Besides these green stones, there were also copious amounts of peak grade immortal herbs and materials. Now, Mo Wuji's total number of green crystals was five million.</p><p>[1] This idiom talks about how a thief places earbuds in his ears as he tried to steal a bell. He thought that if he didn't hear the bell ringing as he stole it, others wouldn't be able to do so too.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
