Even though the youth had yet to reach Mo Wuji, Mo Wuji could guess that this youth should be the uncle mentioned by the two women; the person they were looking for.</p><p>\"This Dao Friend must be in good spirits to be looking for God spiritual herbs here at the Tao Tie Valley,\" The youth started laughing out loud at the sight of the Two-leaved Immortal Dust Grass on Mo Wuji’s hands.</p><p>Mo Wuji kept the Two-leaved Immortal Dust Grass as he praised the beauty of this youth in his heart. That’s right, he was indeed beautiful. Fair skin, large eyes and a delicate pair of hands which looked almost like a woman’s. Only his hoarse voice gave him some aura of a man.</p><p>\"Ahah, I have a low cultivation so I don’t dare to set foot onto the production land of the God spiritual herbs. Therefore, I could only find a desolate place like this to pick some low tier herbs,\" Mo Wuji replied awkwardly.</p><p>The youth nodded when he heard Mo Wuji’s words, \"That’s true. Oh yes, did those two women came to look for me earlier on?\"</p><p>Mo Wuji replied, \"They asked me about their uncle but they left right after I told them I have no idea who or where their uncle was.\"</p><p>The youth pat Mo Wuji’s shoulder before saying, \"Well said. Why don’t you follow me? I shall bring you to a place to pick higher tier God spiritual herbs.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji could sense that this youth’s cultivation was much higher than his which was why he started feeling uneasy.</p><p>\"Many thanks, but I think I am still too weak now so I’ll pass.\" Mo Wuji had no idea who this person was and comparatively, Mo Wuji was indeed much weaker than him. Given his current level of strength, following this man around would simply be courting early death.</p><p>The youth lowered his voice and said, \"I am not lying to you and I’ve even heard of the existence of a god lattice there. I doubt you have obtained a god lattice right…\"</p><p>Mo Wuji was slightly dumbfounded as he wondered what a god lattice was. Could it be the same thing as an immortal lattice? From the words of this youth, it seemed like god lattice shouldn’t be the same as an immortal lattice. Immortal lattice could be condensed using immortal lattice stones aka consciousness crystals or could be condensed using one’s own Grand Dao spirituality.</p><p>This youth mentioned ‘existence’ which meant to say that the god lattice was an actual object.</p><p>Just as Mo Wuji was about to inquire more about the god lattice, the youth’s expression changed and his body flashed across. In almost an instance, he disappeared in front of Mo Wuji. Mo Wuji could only feel a slight fluctuation in space and was unable to see how this youth disappeared right in front of him.</p><p>However, just a few seconds later, the previous two woman landed right in front of Mo Wuji again.</p><p>\"What’s your name?\" The taller woman asked once more.</p><p>Previously, Mo Wuji didn’t mention his own name but now that the other party came back to ask him again, he answered, \"My name is Mo Wuji.\"</p><p>\"Very good, you are quite pleasing to the eye so follow us then,\" The taller woman sized Mo Wuji up once more before saying abruptly.</p><p>Mo Wuji’s heart jumped. Leave with these two women?</p><p>\"Sorry, I have other matters to attend so I won’t be able to follow you,\" Mo Wuji rejected without hesitation.</p><p>The taller woman sneered, \"This isn’t up to you to decide.\"</p><p>Having said that, she expanded her palm in an attempt to grab Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji felt relieved because this woman didn’t seem to be able to control the space around him. Since the other party wasn’t able to control the space around him, he would have the opportunity to escape.</p><p>At the thought of this, a few streams of elemental energy was actually restraining him. In a hurry, Mo Wuji let out a punch.</p><p>Bang! An oppressive sound was heard and Mo Wuji’s domain crushing fist tore apart the restraining elemental energy. In the next moment, he had already escaped out from the restraining elemental energy.</p><p>Simultaneously, his power of his domain crushing fist seemed like it had disappeared completely into an ocean.</p><p>\"Ai, I really couldn’t tell that you have a few tricks up your sleeves,\" Having failed to capture Mo Wuji, the taller woman was not only not disappointed, her spirits seemed to be lifted.</p><p>Mo Wuji’s heart was heavy because that shorter woman had yet to make her move. The punch that he let out also made him understood the logic as to why the opponent was unable to restrain his surrounding. That was because the Laws of Heaven and Earth here were much higher and if the opponent could restrain the space in a place like this, her cultivation would be enough to finish Mo Wuji easily.</p><p>Mo Wuji had already extended his spiritual will to scan the surrounding as he prepared to escape. Even though the two women were clearly much stronger than him, he believed that he was still capable of escaping.</p><p>The taller woman appeared to know what Mo Wuji was planning so she sneered and said, \"If you are planning to escape, I assure you that you will be dead very soon. I have no idea how you came to this place but I can tell you that there are only three directions for you to leave this place. All three directions would end up in dead ends and you would be captured to mine for ores. Eventually, you will die in the boundless field. The only difference would be the different mining area you would be thrown to.</p><p>And I assure that nothing would happen to you if you follow me. I have no ill-intentions towards you and in fact, you would be thankful you choose to follow me. If you are still doubtful, why don’t you check it out yourself…\"</p><p>Before she could finish her sentence, Mo Wuji shifted and ignited his Wind Escape Technique to the maximum.</p><p>\"This fella’s cultivation might not be high but he definitely had some experience in escaping,\" The taller woman didn’t chase after him as the shorter woman exclaimed.</p><p>The taller woman sneered, \"Since he is so eager to die, we shall let him be. To think he would actually treat our kindness so indifferently, this fella would deserve it if he died in the mining area. Let’s go, I don’t believe we can’t find a person to replace uncle.\"</p><p>…</p><p>After tens of breath, Mo Wuji knew that the two women didn’t chase after him. Mo Wuji heaved a sigh of relief as he grew a little more cautious.</p><p>He suspected that the taller woman’s words about someone obstructing him from leaving this place were true. Therefore, he had to be more cautious from now on.</p><p>On the way, Mo Wuji picked out a few peak grade immortal herbs and even managed to pick out a few unknown herbs. These herbs exuded energy exceeding Tier 9 immortal herbs and Mo Wuji’s guess was that these were God spiritual herbs.</p><p>\"Looks like you’ve picked up quite a few God spiritual herbs eh?\" Just as Mo Wuji picked up another unknown God spiritual herb, he heard a faint voice. Mo Wuji’s first thought was to shift away but just as he moved, a blade radiance exploded towards him.</p><p>Mo Wuji’s body flashed and before he could act, a rope, which looked like it had eyes, tied him up tightly.</p><p>Mo Wuji didn’t continue struggling because there were three people surrounding him and every one of them was stronger than the previous tall woman. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been so clueless even when the opponent was already in front of him. Fortunately, Mo Wuji knew that these people were not out to kill him because if they were, he would have sensed their killing intent.</p><p>\"An average cultivation level, I doubt he would be able to last long,\" A copper face man held onto the thick sword on his back as he sized Mo Wuji up. Evidently, his tone was filled with disappointment.</p><p>\"Ai, it is getting increasingly hard to find miners nowadays. Let’s just be glad with that we found one, feed him with some Black Transformation Pill and send him away. He should still be able to dig out some god crystals and if we’re lucky, we might even get some peak grade ones,\" A skinny and tall man standing on the left side of the copper face man exclaimed.</p><p>The copper face man suddenly lifted his fist and before his fist could land on Mo Wuji’s face, Mo Wuji took the initiative to open his mouth.</p><p>\"Not bad, you’re pretty tactful.\" The copper face man laughed as he retracted his fist. In the next instance, a pill with fishy smell landed into his mouth.</p><p>The moment the pill entered his mouth, his meridians actually showed signs of being routed. Mo Wuji cursed in his heart and hurried to circulate his detoxification meridian.</p><p>Once the detoxification meridian was circulated, the wild and dark energy was instantly turned into a unique elemental energy. At that point in time, Mo Wuji could actually feel his cultivation rising exponentially. The pity was that he didn’t dare to cultivate now and had to waste his opportunity.</p><p>What an incredible pill. Despite not allowing the Black Transformation Pill to waste his meridians, Mo Wuji understood the use of this Black Transformation Pill.</p><p>This was a pill which could blacken spirit roots and once the cultivator’s spirit roots were blackened, it could be transform into energy. Moreover, the few guys talked about digging for god crystals so clearly, this was a pill to stop people who were supposed to mine from cultivating. By piecing up the words of these three people, it seemed like the Black Transformation Pill was used to support the miner’s life force. In other words, mining would quicken the death of the miner.</p><p>Pity was that these fellas didn’t know that Mo Wuji had no spirit roots or even spirit channels. The toxic which could blacken his meridians had already been swept away by his detoxification meridian.</p><p>Half an incense later, the short and fat man, who fed Mo Wuji the Black Transformation Pill, brought along a spirit roots detector to Mo Wuji. He took away Mo Wuji’s ring before placing his hand on the spirit roots detector.</p><p>The detector displayed a dark grey colour and no other colour.</p><p>The skinny and tall man nodded as he knew that Mo Wuji’s spirit roots had already been blackened; primordial spirit should have dissipated too. With a sweep of his hand, he kept the rope which was tying Mo Wuji up.</p><p>Mo Wuji didn’t take the risk to try and escape. He could tell that these three fellas were well experienced in capturing people. With his current strength and inexperience of the place, the chances of him successfully escaping was slim.</p><p>\"Even without spirit roots or primordial spirit, you don’t have to worry. As long as you dig out enough god crystals in the stipulated time, you will have the chance to recover your spirit roots and earn your freedom. Of course, if you choose to view this passively, you shall lose your chance at reincarnation. That would be pretty miserable,\" The skinny and tall man said to Mo Wuji.</p><p>At this moment, Mo Wuji realised that the opposition was not only trying to blacken his spirit roots but also his primordial spirit. He didn’t thought of this was because since he didn’t have spirit roots, he would naturally not have primordial spirit too.</p><p>...</p><p>Two hours later, Mo Wuji was brought to a massive flying ship. The copper face man threw Mo Wuji into a huge cabin before shutting the restriction of the ship and left.</p><p>Mo Wuji realised that there were already over ten people on this ship but everyone here had a face of despair. Perhaps, he was the only one in the cabin who was still thinking about how to escape.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
