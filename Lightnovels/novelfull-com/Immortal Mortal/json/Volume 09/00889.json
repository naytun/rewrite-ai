His cultivation of the Immortal Mortal Technique and the opening of meridians were few of the most concealed secrets of his. Once such a matter was exposed, it could invite calamity upon himself.</p><p>At second thought, Mo Wuji felt that he shouldn’t reject him. Since this person was able to tell that Mo Wuji was this heaven-defying and managed to path the way for mortals to cultivate, he might be the target for others if he left this place.</p><p>\"Answer me quickly! Are you willing to become an inner disciple of my Heavenly Mortal Sect?\" The elder starting speaking with an anxious tone.</p><p>Mo Wuji asked cautiously, \"Does my spiritual roots or anything have to be tested later on?\"</p><p>Wei Jie’s stared at Mo Wuji with a frown, \"How could I, Wei Jie, misjudge a person? There is absolutely no need to undergo any tests. I am certain that you’re a genius with supreme talent.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji heard these words and said, \"Alright then…\"</p><p>When Wei Jie heard Mo Wuji’s verbal agreement, he instantly brought Mo Wuji to the young woman as he said, \"This is an inner disciple of our Heavenly Mortal Sect, hand him the items meant for inner disciples…\"</p><p>Mo Wuji was slightly shocked because he didn’t feel particularly respected. After hearing that he was willing to join the Heavenly Mortal Sect, what kind of attitude was this? Was this how the Heavenly Mortal Sect treats their genius with supreme talent?</p><p>When he thought of this, Mo Wuji already guessed that the other party shouldn’t have guessed that he started as a mortal. In other words, he was duped. The reason why he was duped was because he knew that he was indeed able to cultivate at a much greater speed than those ‘geniuses’ out there. The words of the old falsifier were true which was what led to the misunderstanding. If he didn’t cultivate the mortal dao, he would have found out the old falsifier was lying to him from the very first sentence.</p><p>Knowing that the other party was lying to him, Mo Wuji actually felt relieved. He rather the old falsifier duped him than have his mortal dao exposed.</p><p>\"What is your name? How is your cultivation?\" The woman in charge of administration for the Heavenly Mortal Sect said with a very clear and gentle voice.</p><p>Just as Mo Wuji was about to answer, he heard Wei Jie’s excited voice again, \"Aiya, you are definitely one of the most talented cultivators around here. Your bones are truly too amazing… The pity is that your talent and spiritual roots have been concealed so nobody would notice it. As long as you come to my Heavenly Mortal Sect, I guarantee that you will be an inner disciple here. No, even a status as the legacy disciple wouldn’t suit a talent like you…\"</p><p>Mo Wuji turned his head and saw Wei Jie grabbed onto another ordinary cultivator as he chattered on and on.</p><p>Looking at how that old falsifier was acting, Mo Wuji almost spat out a mouthful of blood despite already knowing that he was duped. There were actually people like this old falsifier in the God Domain and the joke’s on him that he actually thought that he was exposed.</p><p>At this moment, there was a scene playing in Mo Wuji’s head where an old fella held onto all sorts of martial arts cheat books as he grabbed onto a child to say something like, ‘Aiya, I see that your bones are innately different and extraordinary compared to others. I have a book which could expand your potential so the peace of the entire universe would be dependent on you in the future…\"</p><p>However, not everyone would be duped like Mo Wuji was. The person Wei Jie held onto instantly rejected him, \"I don’t wish to join the Heavenly Mortal Sect.\"</p><p>Wei Jie could only let go of his hand awkwardly, \"What a pity, what a pity… A body of good bones is wasted.\"</p><p>Noticing that Mo Wuji didn’t speak, the woman asked once more and Mo Wuji could only sigh and reply, \"My name is Mo Wuji and I have a very low cultivation. Moreover, my primordial spirit and spiritual roots have been broken so I’m afraid that I…\"</p><p>\"Its okay, you can rest assure and join our Heavenly Mortal Sect. Our Heavenly Mortal Sect is capable of turning the most ordinary people into extraordinary beings. Naturally, since your primordial spirit and spiritual roots are broken, you can only be an inner disciple…\" Wei Jie turned around when he heard Mo Wuji’s words. However, before he could even complete his sentence, he seemed to have spotted another genius with supreme bones as he chased after that person.</p><p>Mo Wuji asked doubtfully, \"Senior Sister, I am still able to join the inner sect even with my primordial spirit and spiritual roots destroyed?\"</p><p>The woman nodded, \"Yes if Elder Wei Jie says its possible then its possible.\"</p><p>\"I agree then but how do I address this senior sister?\" Mo Wuji replied without hesitation. The outer disciples of the Nine Evolutions God Sect have their individual place to stay so even if the inner sects of the Heavenly Mortal Sect was slightly weaker, it shouldn’t be too huge of a difference from the outer disciples of the Nine Evolutions God Sect right?</p><p>\"My name is Su Xia and this is your token as an inner disciple. Wait here for a while and after the recruitment of disciples is completed, we shall head back to the sect together.\" Su Xia gave Mo Wuji a token which was actually made from wood. Mo Wuji sighed in his heart because even in the Cultivation World, disciples’ token were mostly made of jade.</p><p>Regardless, it was still a good thing that he became an inner disciple just like that.</p><p>Mo Wuji walked over to the resting area of the Heavenly Mortal Sect and there were already four disciples seated there. They should be recruited before Mo Wuji was brought in.</p><p>\"Junior Brother here, how are an inner disciple?\" Noticing that Mo Wuji walked over with an inner disciple token, a slightly tanned woman questioned.</p><p>Mo Wuji returned the question, \"Are the few of you not inner disciples?\"</p><p>\"I am a legacy disciple,\" The woman took out her wooden token.</p><p>\"I am a core disciple.\"</p><p>\"I am also a legacy disciple…\"</p><p>After the four of them displayed their tokens, Mo Wuji realised that he was the only inner disciple there. He was ‘supremely talented’ but was only offered a slot as an inner disciple.</p><p>Fortunately, Mo Wuji wasn’t too bothered by it as he laughed it off, \"It is still better than being an inner disciple.\"</p><p>The four people heard Mo Wuji before exchanging glances with each other while remaining speechless. After a while, the tanned skin woman said softly, \"The Heavenly Mortal Sect didn’t have any outer disciples as they only accept direct disciples, core disciples, legacy disciples and inner disciples.\"</p><p>As he heard this, Mo Wuji stared at the old falsifier, Wei Jie, who was still trying to pull cultivators desperately. He suddenly felt uneasy about this fella.</p><p>Everyone else could tell that Mo Wuji was not feeling very pleased so they tried to mollify him.</p><p>Luckily, Mo Wuji wasn’t too disturbed by it for long and very soon, he made friends with these few senior brothers and sisters. The tanned skin woman was called Yin Lin, the brown hair one was called Pu Jia, slightly fatter senior sister was called Ai Dong’Er and the tallest one was called Di Butong.</p><p>The four of them were rogue cultivators and was also hoping to use this recruitment period to join a sect. Even though the four of them were limited in their cultivation potential, they were already in the pinnacle of the Nascent God Stage. Without mentioning the difficulty in finding a god lattice crystal, even if they could find a few, they might not be able to step into the Heavenly God Stage with their talent.</p><p>Because they had average talents, the four of them decided to join this Heavenly Mortal Sect after making a round around the plaza.</p><p>It was perhaps because Mo Wuji looked the poorest as he was only carrying a storage bag, the few of them conversed while paying special attention to Mo Wuji’s feelings.</p><p>…</p><p>Another three days had passed by and the recruitment had finally ended. Despite the hard work of Wei Jie, he only managed to recruit one more disciple after Mo Wuji. It was a female cultivator who didn’t look too old and could even be considered a small girl. The girl’s name was a little odd as her name was Ku Cai [1].</p><p>Mo Wuji was not aware of her cultivation level but he saw that she was hesitating outside the registrations of other sects for a long period of time. She looked like she didn’t dare to ask more about it. Only when she walked past the Heavenly Mortal Sect, the talkative Wei Jie played his old tricks and managed to trick this girl into the Heavenly Mortal Sect easily.</p><p>Wei Jie walked in front of Mo Wuji and co. before waving his head, \"All of you are the future of my Heavenly Mortal Sect. Follow me back to the sect and we shall reveal every last bit of your talent and potential.\"</p><p>Having said that, Wei Jie drew out a flying ship.</p><p>Because this plaza was located right outside a transfer array hall, all the disciples of the other sects left through the transfer arrays. Wei Jie was probably the one who drew out the flying ship.</p><p>\"Why aren’t we taking the transfer array?\" The one asking the question was Yin Lin. Out of all the disciples recruited by the Heavenly Mortal Sect today, she was comparatively the more lively one.</p><p>Wei Jie chuckled, \"The few of you have just joined the sect so you have yet to cultivate any peak grade dao laws sacred art. If anything happened within the transfer array, there might be disorder within the space which would be life-threatening in any sense. All of you are the future of my Heavenly Mortal Sect so I didn’t dare to take the risk.\"</p><p>Once he said that, Wei Jie rushed everyone into the ship as he controlled his flying ship out of the plaza.</p><p>After entering the ship’s cabin, Su Xia spoke to everyone in a soft voice. \"Don’t take Senior Uncle Wei Jie’s words too seriously because the transfer array is actually much safer than flying ship. Our Heavenly Mortal Sect didn’t have enough god crystals to send everyone through the transfer arrays. This was why we had to travel using flying ship.\"</p><p>The few of them became speechless because if a sect couldn’t even afford enough god crystals to take transfer arrays, how long could this sect even last?</p><p>In a way, everyone wasn’t particularly disappointed because everyone knew that with their poor talent as compared to others, there weren’t many other sects which they could join. Other than the normally quiet Ku Cai and Mo Wuji himself, the rest of them were conversing rather enthusiastically.</p><p>Even though Wei Jie’s flying ship was of a higher grade than Mo Wuji’s one, the space within it was simply too small. Mo Wuji wanted to find a secluded place to cultivate but was unable to do so which was why he was forced to listen to their conversations.</p><p>The good thing was that through these people’s conversations, he managed to obtain even more information regarding the god domain.</p><p>A month later, the flying ship stopped.</p><p>After everyone left the flying ship, they were all stunned. The flying ship stopped on a dried up swamp and if this dried up swamp was the plaza, behind the plaza would be two extremely tall and erected mountains.</p><p>The two mountains had three majestic words hung between it which was shrouded in fog, \"Heavenly Mortal Sect\".</p><p>Just looking at these two mountains, there was still an imposing aura about the Heavenly Mortal Sect. However, with the addition of the dried up swamp and the surrounding, one could tell how wretched the Heavenly Mortal Sect truly was.</p><p>Without mentioning about how thin the layer of god spiritual energy the surrounding had, even the periphery of the Lightning Sword Manor had much denser god spiritual energy than this place. Even if he were to look at the two mountains, Mo Wuji had honestly rarely seen any sect in the Cultivation World with only two mountains.</p><p>Even the poorest sect had at least nine mountains right? Most sects would even have up to thousands of mountains belonging to themselves.</p><p>This was truly Mo Wuji’s first time seeing a sect with only two mountains.</p><p>\"How is it? Our Heavenly Mortal Sect is very imposing right? Let’s go, follow me into the sect,\" Wei Jie kept the flying ship as he introduced it loftily before walking forward. He didn’t even notice that all the recruited disciples except Ku Cai had a disappointed expression on their faces.</p><p>[1]: Ku Cai is the hanyupinyin of bitter vegetables; which was why Mo Wuji found the name slightly odd.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
