Moreover, the place looked very familiar.</p><p>To put it in other words, the site of Tian Ji was in the same Immortal Domain as his Ping Fan Immortal School.</p><p>\"This is Yong Ying's Immortal Chasm?\" Mo Wuji asked with furrowed brows.</p><p>Yong Ying Immortal Chasm was the chasm to Half Immortal Domain. Those years ago, he even traversed across it.</p><p>\"That's right. This is Yong Ying Immortal Domain's Edge of Yong Ying. To think about it, it is in the same Immortal Domain as Sect Head Mo's Ping Fan Immortal School,\" Gai Ying answered.</p><p>Mo Wuji saw at least ten experts not far away, he even recognised a few of them. This included Heavenly Emperor Zizai and Yong Ying Immortal Domain's Heavenly Emperor Kui Fengyun.</p><p>This place was truly too familiar; back when he traversed across Yong Ying's Immortal Chasm, there was a killing array here. However, at this moment, that array was no longer present; it should have already been destroyed.</p><p>\"This place used to be restrained by the Laws of the Heaven and Earth; only Golden Immortals and below could come here. But not long ago, it suddenly changed. Cultivators from lower worlds could ascend into the Immortal World and the Laws here are no longer oppressed by the Heaven and Earth,\" Qing Yang explained.</p><p>Mo Wuji came to a realisation. Back when he first came, there were indeed restrains to the Laws of the Heaven and Earth here. He even made use of those restraints to kill some Golden Immortals from the Immortal World.</p><p>It was just that he cultivated the Mortal Dao, causing him to not face any of these restraints. This was why he didn't think about it at the very first moment.</p><p>\"Greetings Sect Head Mo…\" The ten over experts guarding over the Yong Ying Immortal Chasm all came over to greet. News of Mo Wuji's deeds had already spread over here. Thus, no one here dared to show any disrespect to Mo Wuji.</p><p>Even though Kui Fengyun eagerly wanted to kill Mo Wuji, Kui Fengyun knew that he couldn't kill the current Mo Wuji. In fact, if Mo Wuji had any killing intent towards him, he was the one that was going to be easily killed.</p><p>\"Kui Fengyun greets Sect Head Mo.\" At this instant, Kui Fengyun's heart was palpitating in uncertainty; he was incomparably respectful towards Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji's eyes swept across Kui Fengyun coldly, his tone did not contain half a strand of respect as he said, \"Kui Fengyun, now that cultivators can ascend to the Immortal World, are you going to think of another method to kill those newly ascended cultivators?\"</p><p>Kui Fengyun jolted and he hurriedly said, \"I don't dare. I have long realised my mistake. Without cultivators ascending to the Immortal World, my Yong Ying Immortal Domain's power gradually got weaker. I've already ordered the great efforts to protect newly ascended cultivators.\"</p><p>At this instant, Kui Fengyun could only curse in his heart. Why must this problem happen in his Yong Ying Immortal Domain? If it wasn't in Yong Ying, he definitely wouldn't have come.</p><p>But now that it had happened in Yong Ying Immortal Domain, as its Heavenly Emperor, he couldn't find a reason not to come even if he was searching from a pool of a million reasons.</p><p>Even though Xing Shan and co. hoped that Mo Wuji wouldn’t get caught up in such trivial matters and to hurry over to the site of Tian Ji, they didn’t dare to come forward and offend Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji coldly snorted, \"As the Heavenly Emperor, you were too selfish and your cultivation is also too weak. I'm too lazy to accuse you of a crime. After this matter ends, hand your position as the Heavenly Emperor to Wei Zidao.\"</p><p>In reality, Mo Wuji had long been discontented with Kui Fengyun's rule as the Heavenly Emperor. This fella was too selfish; he had never considered the Immortal Domain in his decisions. With such a Heavenly Emperor, the Immortal Domain would eventually be doomed.</p><p>His Ping Fan Immortal School was in Yong Ying Immortal Domain. If Kui Fengyun continued to imprison the talents that ascend to Yong Ying Immortal Domain from the cultivation world, then Yong Ying would eventually grow weaker than the others. Ping Fan, being in Yong Ying Immortal Domain, wouldn't be any better off either.</p><p>\"Ah…\" Kui Fengyun even prepared for the scenario if Mo Wuji attacked him. However, he never expected that Mo Wuji would directly remove him from his position as a Heavenly Emperor.</p><p>Did this fella think he was the Dao Emperor of the Very High Heavens? He could just decide who the Heavenly Emperor was going to be?</p><p>A voice filled with derision sounded, \"Mo Wuji, others respect your Pill Dao and call you Sect Head Mo, but you actually consider yourself as the Dao Emperor of the Very High Heavens? Yong Ying Immortal Domain's Heavenly Emperor had been decided on a long time ago, how can it be changed along with your whims? Moreover, who are you to meddle with what a Heavenly Emperor does?\"</p><p>The one speaking was a black-robed old man behind Kui Fengyun. Mo Wuji had sensed that this fella was a Grand Emperor some time ago.</p><p>\"Who are you?\" Mo Wuji's tone was icy cold.</p><p>\"This Emperor is the Grand Protector of Yong Ying Immortal Domain, Chang Beihe. Mo Wuji, I know that your sacred arts are strong and that I am not your opponent. However, Yong Ying Immortal Domain is not a place where you can cover over its skies with your hands and have it go along with your dictations. You are merely a sect head but you actually want to interfere with the matters of Yong Ying Immortal Domain and interfere with the matters of the Heavenly Emperor…\"</p><p>The surrounding people glanced towards each other; they really didn't know what madness Chang Beihe was going on about. Mo Wuji even dared to challenge Zi Changluo, you think that he wouldn't dare to attack you? A mere protector?</p><p>Mo Wuji was too lazy to speak; he directly released a punch towards Chang Beihe. He didn't even use his domain but his fist still easily tore through Chang Beihe's domain.</p><p>\"Sect Head Mo, please stop.\" When Xing Shan saw Mo Wuji's actions, he hurriedly tried to step forward to stop Mo Wuji. It was just that Gai Ying blocked his way.</p><p>Qing Yang, Gai Ying, and those of the likes could tell that something was wrong with Chang Beihe. As a Grand Emperor, he still dared to challenge Mo Wuji despite knowing about his deeds. Wasn't he simply courting his death?</p><p>Kui Fengyun's face changed and he didn't move. He was very clear that he was the number one person that Mo Wuji wanted to kill here. If he dared to make a move, he might be Mo Wuji's next target. Moreover, he could tell that Chang Beihe was indeed trying to court his own death.</p><p>\"Kacha!\" This fist of Mo Wuji's easily landed on Chang Beihe's chest; even those at the furthest edge could hear the sound of cracking.</p><p>Mo Wuji could defeat Zhu Yin and he could even kill multiple Grand Emperors. It really wouldn't be strange to see him kill Chang Beihe this easily.</p><p>What left everyone shocked was that after this fist landed on Chang Beihe, a black mist oozed out of Chang Beihe's body. His aura didn't get weaker, and in fact, it became slightly stronger.</p><p>Before everyone could even react, they saw a scene that left them in greater disbelief: Chang Beihe actually whipped out his magic treasure.</p><p>Logically, even if Mo Wuji's fist wasn't able to kill Chang Beihe, Chang Beihe still wouldn't be able to retaliate with such energy and spirit.</p><p>But when Chang Beihe finally attacked, everyone saw that Chang Beihe's target actually wasn't Mo Wuji, but Kui Fengyun.</p><p>Even Monk Xing Shan understood what happened. There seemed to be a seal within Chang Beihe's body and that fist of Mo Wuji's helped to remove that seal.</p><p>Looking at Chang Beihe's actions, anyone that wasn't a fool could tell who was the one who laid the seal.</p><p>Indeed, when he saw Chang Beihe's attack locked onto himself, Kui Fengyun's face changed. He immediately retrieved a talisman.</p><p>But at the instant where he wanted to activate that talisman, he suddenly felt the space around him harden. A hint of hatred flashed across his eyes. He knew that Chang Beihe didn't have the capability to do such a thing; Mo Wuji definitely was the one.</p><p>\"Pff!\" Chang Beihe's magic treasure landed on Kui Fengyun's body, turning Kui Fengyun into a mist of blood.</p><p>Chang Beihe's hand flipped, sweeping Kui Fengyun's storage ring into his hand..He immediately handed the ring over to Mo Wuji and said, \"Many thanks to Sect Head Mo for your saving grace. This is the ring of Kui Fengyun that thief.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji did not show any courtesy as he kept that ring. Chang Beihe was seeking to die. On the contrary, he saved Chang Beihe's life.</p><p>After accepting the ring, Mo Wuji didn't pry into the incident that happened between Chang Beihe and Kui Fengyun. He smiled and faced the crowd, \"I was once the sect head of Tian Ji Sect and I heard that this is the site of Tian Ji. I still need those that arrived earlier to tell me when the site of Tian Ji first appeared.\"</p><p>When even a person of Yong Ying Immortal Domain like Mo Wuji didn't ask about what happened between Kui Fengyun and Chang Beihe, the others were even less willing to ask about it.</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Zizai was more familiar with Mo Wuji. He stood up and said, \"This place used to be the Immortal Chasm. However, when Half Immortal Domain collapsed, this Immortal Chasm began to spread outwards. A passage appeared nearby. This passage opens intermittently and every time it opens, it will open for roughly half a day. However, any cultivator that entered this passage would indubitably die…\"</p><p>Just as Heavenly Emperor Zizai got here, a mist began to form over the innocuous-looking Immortal Chasm. Following which, an entirely new sight appeared before everyone.</p><p>A huge stone, hundreds of meters tall, stood tall above the mist. At the top of this huge stone, there seemed to be another stone that lay horizontally.</p><p>The moment Mo Wuji saw this sight, he knew that Qing Yang and co. were right; this really matched the faint image on his white Sect Head Token. This huge stone was standing above a marsh, which was also described in the jade letter than Su Zi’An gave him.</p><p>Indeed, there was a strong energy of destructive wafting out from that passage. It felt equivalent to an ordinary person standing on top of a landmine - extremely uncomfortable.</p><p>\"When you go closer, you will see two words on that horizontal stone. Those two words are ‘Tian Ji’,\" Gai Ying explained.</p><p>\"Over the few days that you all went here, something else happened,\" Heavenly Emperor Zizai added.</p><p>\"What happened?\" Monk Xing Shan seemed especially concerned over the events here. This was why he was extremely anxious.</p><p>\"Another two people went in. However, their corpses haven’t been sent out,\" Heavenly Emperor Zizai said solemnly.</p><p>Mo Wuji hurriedly asked, \"Don’t tell me that when people enter and die inside, their corpses would be sent out?\"</p><p>\"Yes. As long as anyone dies inside, their corpses would be sent out. It seems as though something inside feels disgust towards these corpses,\" Gai Ying explained.</p><p>\"Anyone recognises these two people? And did they go in together?\" This time, it was Mo Wuji’s turn to be anxious.</p><p>Standing by Heavenly Emperor Zizai’s side, a pale clean-shaven man said, \"I recognised one of them; he was the Very High Heavens’ Hu Chisheng.\"</p><p>Hu Chisheng? Why did this name sound so familiar? Mo Wuji soon recalled when he heard of this fella. This fella screwed over Han Yi, who was the ancestor of Han Long. Even though Han Long didn’t come to Ping Fan Immortal School, she was also considered one of them. Moreover, Han Yi was the one that brought Da Huang to the Immortal World.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
