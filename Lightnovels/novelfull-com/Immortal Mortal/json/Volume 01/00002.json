He could feel that after Mo Xinghe went crazy, Yan’Er bore a lot of pressure and suffering. At the moment, he just watched the distant shadows of the high-rise buildings as he secretly clenched his fist. “Even if I have to start from scratch, what's wrong with that?”</p><p>Although it seemed to be a monarchy in this world, the levels of science and technology were similar to that of Earth. There was a public transport system and electronic devices and equipments. How could he still be afraid that he cannot survive?</p><p>“Yan’Er, let's go back first,” Mo Wuji said, watching the tall buildings as he pulled up Yan’Er who was still at a loss.</p><p>Even if he was reborn from Earth, he probably cannot recapture the Northern Qin Prefecture back.</p><p>He may not be able to dream about being a king, but Mo Wuji still had the confidence that he could establish a foothold here. After all, he was a top biological and botanist in the past. It was precisely because he was able to extract the essence from a number of plants and concoct it into a solution that could open the meridians, which caused his lover to plot against him. Consequently, this was why he was ultimately reborn in this place.</p><p>He was still unsure about the value of his solution. The existence of meridians had always been in a gray area even though meridians were often mentioned in traditional Chinese medicine. In actuality, how many people could prove the existence of meridians and even write a research paper about it?</p><p>But, could one imagine? What if the meridians could be expanded to the point where they could actually be felt? How much more powerful would one be? One could participate in the Olympic long-distance running or weightlifting events and still have a chance of winning.</p><p>The only thing he did not expect, however, was that his lover, whom he would have spent his life and death with, would plot against him. Until now, he did not understand why she would, at the moment of his success, backstab him with a dagger.</p><p>“Yes, Master...” Yan’Er finally calmed down, her eyes containing a glimmer.</p><p>Mo Wuji helplessly said, “Yan’Er, do I look like a young master? From now on, call me by my name. The past is the past. Today is a new beginning. My name will no longer be Mo Xinghe, but Mo Wuji. “</p><p>“Yes, Master.” Yan’Er quickly responded.</p><p>Mo Wuji did not continue to persuade her; some habits were too hard to change. “The sky's going to be dark, let's go back. Tomorrow, I will go find a job.”</p><p>Although Mo Wuji had not returned home, he had some ideas. With his parents' death and his family's wealth emptied, the Mo Family had long gone bankrupt. Afterward, Mo Xinghe went mad. In addition to work, Yan'Er also had to play this silly game with Mo Wuji. The fact that they could survive was already not bad.</p><p>“Master, you don't have to find a job. From now on, just don't come out every day. I can find another job. That will be enough.” After hearing Mo Wuji say he wanted to find a job, Yan’Er hastened to stop him.</p><p>Mo Wuji just looked at Yan’Er's faded dress and the simple hair ornament on her yellow hair, he did not say anything. Some things could not be said clearly by words alone. Until his death, Mo Xinghe did not understand the difficulty Yan’Er went through with him.</p><p>…</p><p>Although there were castle gates and walls at Rao Zhou City, there were no guards. Regardless if it was day or night, anyone was free to come and go.</p><p>In other words, the city gate and walls of Rao Zhou City were a symbol of status rather than a form of defense for war.</p><p>Mo Xinghe was determined on restoring his country and did not care about the workings of Rao Zhou City. Mo Wuji could only uncover from the faint memories of Mo Xinghe that Rao Zhou City was very busy.</p><p>After following Yan’Er into the city, Mo Wuji immediately felt the wild, booming bustle of Rao Zhou City. Spacious streets were filled with a dense flow of people, along with brightly lit shops on both sides of the street. Mo Wuji even suspected that this was a modern city from Earth.</p><p>This bustling area was naturally not a place where Mo Wuji could afford to live. After the two bypassed the busy streets and walked for nearly an hour, they came to a messy residential area. Here, the lights looked faint and dim.</p><p>Mo Wuji could see from afar the messy space that they lived in. Even though the rent is almost equal to zero, it was still not what they could afford. If it was not for the sympathy of the landlord, they might not even have a place to sleep.</p><p>“Aiyo, the king is back. We better quickly make way for this one,” An abrupt voice interrupted Mo Wuji's chain of thought.</p><p>“Hu Fei, you get out of the way,” Yan’Er, who was originally half a step behind Mo Wuji, suddenly stepped forward, like an angry little leopard, pushing Mo Wuji behind her.</p><p>Under the dim light, Mo Wuji saw a youth with thickly gelled hair. Although he said to make way for Mo Wuji, he stood in the middle of the street without showing the slightest intention of doing so.</p><p>“Little Yan’Er, Big Brother Hu specially bought half a catty of pig meat for you. You doing this to me makes me feel sad,” said Hu Fei while he fiddled around with the lotus leaf packet in his hands. (TL: Chinese food is sometimes wrapped up in lotus/pandan/banana leaves)</p><p>Mo Wuji's belly disappointingly rumbled loudly. Yan'Er, who originally wanted to have Hu Fei move out of the way, hesitated while looking at the lotus leaf packet.</p><p>“Isn't this better? You and Big Brother Hu aren't strangers...” Hu Fei said, coming over as he moved to put his hand around Yan’Er's shoulders. Although there was a scar on Yan'Er's face along with her having an undeveloped body due to poor nutrition, she still had a set of pretty facial features.</p><p>Yan’Er's eyes showed signs of hesitation. If she was alone, she would not be bothered about Hu Fei. But today, the young master has not eaten for the whole day, and his stomach was rumbling. Furthermore, there was not even a grain of rice at home. What could she do even if she went back?</p><p>Mo Wuji did not know what Yan'Er was thinking. He did not wait for Hu Fei’s hands to reach Yan’Er’s shoulders before he kicked out with his foot.</p><p>Hu Fei did not expect Mo Wuji to react this way. Mo Wuji kicked him squarely in the chest.</p><p>Mo Wuji felt like he kicked a piece of steel, and he had to take a series of steps back from the strong rebound.</p><p>“Master, are you alright...” Yan’Er quickly ran over, supporting Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji looked at Hu Fei who was only forced back by a single step and could not help but become shocked. His current body was indeed very weak as it was not even able to kick down Hu Fei. Is Hu Fei a martial artist?</p><p>“You're courting death...” Hu Fei did not expect the weak Mo Xinghe, who only dreamt of being a king, to suddenly act against him. He went into a fury and pulled out a foot-long knife from his waist and rushed towards Mo Wuji.</p><p>Several bystanders saw Hu Fei rushing towards Mo Wuji, but no one came forward to help. They did not even say a word.</p><p>“Hu Fei, hurry up and stop! It’s broad daylight and you dare to commit murder?” Yan’Er's face turned pale white, and she did not notice that it was already night time.</p><p>“Ha ha, I have long wanted to get rid of this idiot. Today, this idiot acted against me first, even if I kill him, I will at most get only a fine. Yan’Er, I am doing this for you. If you follow me, you can have food to eat and clothes to wear...” Hu Fei apparently did not intend to stop.</p><p>Yan’Er turned anxious. There was no other way; she could only use her body to protect Mo Wuji.</p><p>At this moment, Mo Wuji completely calmed down. From his recollection, Cheng Yu State indeed had such a law. Whether you are right or wrong, if someone acted upon you first and you killed him, you would only receive a small fine.</p><p>Knowing that it was too late for regrets, Mo Wuji quickly pulled Yan'Er to the side. He calmly stared at Hu Fei and said, “Hu Fei, if you dare to even touch a single hair of mine, you will die a horrible death.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
