They didn't meet with any Six-footed Lightning Crocodiles, which made Mo Wuji a little depressed. He still had seven bottles of channel opening solution. If they met with some lightning crocodiles, he would be able to open up to his 30th meridian or more.</p><p>Two days later, Mo Wuji and Ding Bu’Er arrived back at Tian Luo Hotel. When they arrived, Shen Lian still couldn't be found. Knowing that Mo Wuji had to cultivate, and that Shen Lian was an immortal master, Ding Bu'Er decided to stay at the living room.</p><p>Mo Wuji did not show Ding Bu'Er around. He had just opened 27 meridians, and he needed to use this time to cultivate.</p><p>When Mo Wuji started to absorb spiritual energy and circulate it in his body, he was almost shocked still. No matter how much spiritual energy he absorbed, it was like simply adding drops of water to the sea; there was no obstacles or obstructions in his cultivation. When he first cultivated to Channel Opening Stage Level 1, he could distinctly feel a bottleneck. However, with his 27 open meridians, he felt that even if he continuously cultivated and absorbed spiritual energy, his 27 meridians would have the capacity to hold it in.</p><p>As he continuously absorbed spiritual energy, his cultivation constantly rose. Even though Mo Wuji did not see any geniuses cultivating, he could guess that even geniuses could not absorb spiritual energy as fast as he could. His 27 meridians were like a wide, boundless ocean, free for him to swim and roam.</p><p>Mo Wuji suppressed his wild joy. It no longer mattered to him that meridians may not be spirit channels. With his fast cultivation speed, no geniuses with their spirit channels could compare to him.</p><p>Two days passed in a flash. Mo Wuji felt like he had reached the peak of Channel Opening Stage Level 1. When he was at the brink of breaking through to Channel Opening Stage Level 2, he suddenly stopped.</p><p>This wasn't due to limits in his meridians, but rather his lack of experience. He did not want to break through wrongly and make an irreparable mistake. More importantly, the Spring Immortal's Gate was opening soon. Who knew how long the breakthrough would take?</p><p>…</p><p>When Mo Wuji walked out of his room, he saw Shen Lian staring at Ding Bu'Er with huge eyes. Noticing that Mo Wuji had come out, Shen Lian immediately frowned and asked, “Mo Wuji, who is he?”</p><p>“He's my friend, Ding Bu'Er. Your room was actually meant for him, but since you didn't have anywhere to go, I decided to let you have it first. When Bu’Er came, he insisted that he would not take your room, so he's temporarily staying in the living room.”</p><p>With Mo Wuji's words, the originally reproachful Shen Lian turned speechless.</p><p>Feeling a little guilty, Shen Lian hurriedly said, “The Spring Immortal's Gate is opening. I came to call you to go and try your luck.”</p><p>Ding Bu'Er was silently praising Mo Wuji's words in his heart. Hearing Shen Lian's words, Ding Bu'Er's gaze then landed on her.</p><p>Previously, he wasn't too excited about the Spring Immortal's Gate. However, he now had a Winged Sea Leopard egg. If he used it well, he might actually get accepted into a school or sect. Even being accepted as a service disciple would be incredible.</p><p>Moreover, Mo Wuji could cultivate despite having mortal roots. Maybe he could cultivate too.</p><p>“Let's go. The reason why I came was for the Spring Immortal's Gate Conference,” Mo Wuji hastily said.</p><p>He understood his own circumstances. He knew that his cultivation speed was no worse than geniuses, but as a mortal with mortal roots, it would be impossible to be accepted as a formal disciple during the Spring Immortal's Gate.</p><p>However, Mo Wuji did not really mind. It was already good enough that he was confirmed a place to be a service disciple at the Formless Blade Sect. His sole purpose of joining a sect, was to interact with immortal masters. Whenever there were things he did not understand, at least there would be some people he could ask.</p><p>…</p><p>Mo Wuji did not know how big Chang Luo was. He only knew that it was the capital of Xing Han Empire, and it was also the biggest city in Xing Han. In his month in Chang Luo, he did not explore much of it. He did not even know where the royal palace was.</p><p>Following Shen Lian to Chang Luo Square, Mo Wuji finally knew how big and vast Chang Luo was. Chang Luo Square was filled to the brim with people. Mo Wuji and Shen Lian came relatively late, and could only see from the sides.</p><p>In the centre of the square, there was an extremely large marble platform. On the centre of the platform, was a 7m tall crystal pillar. Mo Wuji was familiar with it; it was the thing used to test for spiritual roots.</p><p>Besides the crystal pillar, there were tens of round altars erected by the sects and schools. The sects’ names were annotated at the top of altars. The big sects occupied a relatively bigger space and were built in a grander manner. For example, the Heavenly Temple’s altar was extremely eye-catching and multiple times bigger than the other sects.</p><p>In Mo Wuji's eyes, this was like a recruitment fair. It was clear who were the big corporations and who were the small companies.</p><p>At the peripherals of the square, there were many sect signs. However, these sects were looking for service disciples. Mo Wuji soon saw a sign from the Formless Blade Sect. From their signs and their altar, Mo Wuji could see that Formless Blade Sect was barely above average.</p><p>Shen Lian looked at Mo Wuji and said, “Do you see? This Spring Immortal's Gate is different from the past. In the past, only a few geniuses could participate and be tested. Afterwards, they would be selected by the sects. This time, besides the geniuses, anyone who thinks that they have decent spiritual roots could ask to tested. Even people like you, who came under the identity of a house attendant, could participate and be selected.”</p><p>Looking at the dense human crowd, Mo Wuji asked in disbelief, “If everyone here is taking part in the selection, when will the selection end?”</p><p>Shen Lian laughed, “You think everyone would get tested by that crystal pillar? Only the main participants get to be tested. For the rest, they need to qualify to be tested on the main stage by passing some preliminary tests”</p><p>As she spoke, Shen Lian pointed at a tall building at the side of Chang Luo Square, \"That's where the preliminary tests are conducted. These tests are not bad. Firstly, it's quite cheap. Secondly, even if you don't qualify to even be an outer disciple, you can apply to be a service disciple.\"</p><p>\"Wuji, let me go there and test for my roots.\" Ding Bu'Er saw many people going towards the preliminary test hall, and got a little eager.</p><p>Mo Wuji had no intentions of testing for his spiritual roots, as he nodded at Ding Bu'Er and said, \"Sure, good luck.\"</p><p>\"What sect are you from?\" Mo Wuji suddenly thought of Shen Lian. She was really knowledgeable, and she was at Channel Opening Stage Level 4 at such a young age. She definitely had some background.</p><p>\"Even if I told you, you wouldn't know,\" Shen Lian casually replied, not intending to share anything further.</p><p>Mo Wuji did not continue asking. He saw a tall man standing in the middle of the marble platform, right next to the crystal pillar.</p><p>The crowd went silent, focusing all their attention on the tall man.</p><p>\"I represent Xing Han Empire to welcome the various sects to Chang Luo to select their disciples. I also welcome the geniuses throughout Xing Han to this selection...</p><p>The auspicious hour has arrived! Light the cannons...\"</p><p>At this point, nine ceremonial cannons by the side of the marble platform shot off.</p><p>\"Who is this man? Is he the Xing Han Empire Emperor?\" Mo Wuji whispered into Shen Lian's ear.</p><p>\"Of course he is the emperor. Who else do you think he is?\" Shen Lian rolled her eyes at Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji asked puzzledly, \"It's true that the emperor is a very distinguished man. But this is a place for cultivators. He doesn't count for much here, right?</p><p>Shen Lian looked at Mo Wuji speechlessly, \"Do you think it's so simple to be the emperor of an Empire? While his personal power might not compare to some figures in certain sects, he is still extremely strong. Furthermore, do you think those peak experts would come for this Spring Immortal's Gate selection? Even if these experts came, there would probably only be one or two of them, and they would only be here to scout for talented mantle disciples. They won't even reveal themselves.\"</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
