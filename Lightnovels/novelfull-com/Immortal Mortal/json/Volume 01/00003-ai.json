  "body": "<p>Mo Wuji faced Hu Fei with a calm demeanor. \"I am still part of the Northern Qin Prefecture royal clan. Even if I didn’t inherit the throne, my aristocratic title remains. Do you dare to harm someone of noble blood? Hu Fei, heed my warning: tearing you limb from limb or cutting you into a thousand pieces would be a light punishment for your actions.\"</p>\n<p>Hu Fei's eyes widened in realization. Even in his weakened state, Mo Wuji was still a member of the royal clan. He was not someone a lowly person like Hu Fei could toy with. The truth of Mo Wuji's status was not for Hu Fei to determine. Yet, he understood that harming a noble would indeed invite severe consequences.</p>\n<p>\"My King,\" Hu Fei stammered, \"I was merely joking. I would never dream of laying a finger on you.\"</p>\n<p>There was no urgency for Hu Fei to dispose of Mo Wuji. He had all the time in the world to verify the validity of Mo Wuji’s title.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji stepped closer to Hu Fei and took the knife from his hand.</p>\n<p>\"What a fine knife…\" he remarked, feeling its sharpness immediately.</p>\n<p>As Hu Fei released the knife, he instinctively took a few steps back, eyeing Mo Wuji warily.</p>\n<p>Yan’Er watched them both with growing anxiety. Even though Mo Wuji now held the knife, she couldn't shake her panic. Having served him for a long time, she knew he was just an ordinary civilian now, stripped of any noble title.</p>\n<p>In essence, since Mo Wuji had initiated the confrontation, if Hu Fei were to kill him, the punishment would likely be minimal.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji examined the knife, locking eyes with Hu Fei. \"Hu Fei, I'm not using my status to threaten you. Even if I’m no longer part of the royal clan, my ancestors were dukes. Hurting their descendant would be a grave disrespect to the Cheng Yu State.\"</p>\n<p>A cold smirk played on Mo Wuji's lips as he finished speaking.</p>\n<p>Hu Fei pondered Mo Wuji's claim. If he were indeed a royal, Hu Fei knew he couldn't easily dispose of him, even with the knife in Mo Wuji's possession. The thought of Mo Wuji's royal lineage quickly dispelled any confidence Hu Fei had, and he replied, \"My King, I was merely jesting.\"</p>\n<p>He couldn't help but wonder how Mo Wuji's demeanor had shifted so dramatically.</p>\n<p>\"I am no longer a king. Leave before I change my mind,\" Mo Wuji said, tucking the knife into his boot.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, yes, Master Mo, please take care,\" Hu Fei replied, his heart aching as he watched Mo Wuji walk away with the knife. It had always been his, and he never expected to lose it today.</p>\n<p>\"Master, you are no longer...\" As Hu Fei departed, Yan’Er approached Mo Wuji cautiously, her voice barely above a whisper.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji cut her off. \"I know. We’ll talk when we get back.\"</p>\n<p>Even without Yan’Er's reminder, Mo Wuji was already aware of his diminished status.</p>\n<p>Their living space was cramped, with only an old cloth separating the two wooden beds. The house held no valuables; Mo Wuji knew that anything of worth had likely been sold by Yan’Er to buy sweets for the children.</p>\n<p>He caught a glimpse of himself in the scratched mirror hanging by his bed. He looked like his former self, his long, dry hair neatly tied by Yan’Er. His pale face was a stark contrast to Yan’Er’s yellowish, gaunt features. Despite the tiredness in his eyes, his slick eyebrows and sharp nose gave him a handsome appearance.</p>\n<p>\"Master, I’m going to Aunt Lu’s to borrow some rice...\" Yan’Er announced as she entered the house. She felt Mo Wuji should have taken the packet of pig head meat from Hu Fei instead of the knife.</p>\n<p>\"Wait...\" Mo Wuji stopped her.</p>\n<p>He noticed her curious gaze and asked, \"Yan’Er, Hu Fei seems to know martial arts. He’s stronger than me. Where did he learn that?\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji recalled that this world wasn’t filled with top martial artists. Why could Hu Fei learn martial arts while he, a noble descendant, could not?</p>\n<p>Yan’Er’s expression turned disdainful. \"Hu Fei barely knows a few moves. He can’t even open his spirit. How can he be called a true martial artist? Your great-grandfather was a genuine spiritual martial artist, as your grandfather told me.\"</p>\n<p>\"What does it mean to open the spirit?\" Mo Wuji asked, his heart racing. In his memory, aside from his previous life, he knew nothing of this world. Could it be that he was mistaken? Was there a chance to master martial arts here?</p>\n<p>Excitement surged within him at the thought of learning martial arts, fueling his desire to one day confront her: “Why?”</p>\n<p>Yan’Er wasn’t surprised by Mo Wuji’s ignorance. What puzzled her was his newfound curiosity. She decided to share what she knew. \"Opening the spirit helps someone with spiritual roots awaken them and open their spiritual channels. Only those who have awakened their roots and opened their channels can cultivate and master martial arts. I’ve heard that opening more channels on the first try indicates better quality spiritual roots.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji grasped two key points from her explanation. First, to learn martial arts, one needed spiritual roots. Second, one had to open their spiritual network.</p>\n<p>\"Yan’Er, why didn’t the old master take me to open my spirit?\" Mo Wuji asked, excitement bubbling within him.</p>\n<p>Yan’Er’s tone grew serious. \"When the old master first arrived in Rao Zhou City, he was too focused on claiming the throne. Once he realized that was impossible, he wanted you to learn martial arts. He saved enough money for you to test your roots and open your spirit. But when the tests were done, it turned out you had mortal roots, just like him. People with mortal roots usually can’t awaken their roots and thus can’t learn martial arts.\"</p>\n<p>\"What are mortal roots?\" Mo Wuji’s heart sank, but he pressed on.</p>\n<p>After facing death, he felt he could handle anything.</p>\n<p>Yan’Er sensed his disappointment and sighed. \"I’ve heard from the old master that one’s roots affect their martial arts future. Those without spiritual roots are called mortal roots, or useless roots. Those with mortal roots are just like everyone else.\"</p>\n<p>\"Only mortal roots...\" Mo Wuji’s disappointment was palpable.</p>\n<p>Yan’Er tried to console him. \"Even in Cheng Yu State, very few people have spiritual roots. Most of us have mortal roots, but we live just fine. I’m sure we will too.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji clenched his fists. \"Yan’Er, I’ll find work tomorrow. I want to save money and try to open my spirit again.\"</p>\n<p>\"Ah...\" Yan’Er was taken aback by his determination but understood his intentions. \"Young master, please don’t. The old master saved up for your root test, and even after discovering you had mortal roots, he still tried to open your spirit. It was after that attempt that he fell ill and passed away...\"</p>\n<p>Her words were heavy, but Mo Wuji understood the implication. If the old master hadn’t pursued the spirit opening, he might have lived longer, even in poverty. Having lived in two worlds, Mo Wuji wasn’t as naive as Yan’Er. He suspected that his grandfather’s death wasn’t merely due to illness. If he were to attempt to open his spirit, he needed to tread carefully.</p>\n<p>\"Don’t worry, Yan’Er. I’m confident I can earn the money. Starting tomorrow, you won’t have to borrow rice from Aunt Lu anymore. I’ll take care of you,\" Mo Wuji said, gently touching Yan’Er’s undernourished hair.</p>\n<p>Yan’Er was so young. It was heartbreaking to think of all she had sacrificed after Mo XingHe’s parents died, taking care of a mad Mo XingHe.</p>\n<p>Aunt Lu was merely their landlord, and she had been kind to them. As a widow, her life wasn’t easy either. Asking her for rice was a burden.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji was still a top-notch botanist in this advanced country. Providing three meals a day would be no obstacle for him.</p>",
