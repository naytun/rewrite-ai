  "body": "<p>Mo Wuji faced Hu Fei with a calm demeanor. \"I am still part of the Northern Qin Prefecture royal clan,\" he stated firmly. \"Even though I didn’t inherit the throne, I still hold my noble title. Do you dare to harm someone like me? Hu Fei, I warn you, even tearing you limb from limb or cutting you into a thousand pieces would be too light a punishment for your actions.\"</p>\n<p>Hu Fei's eyes widened in shock. He realized that even in his weakened state, Mo Wuji was still a member of the royal clan. He was not someone a lowly person like Hu Fei could afford to mess with. Whether Mo Wuji was truly part of the royal clan was not for someone like Hu Fei to determine. However, he understood that harming a noble would indeed lead to severe consequences.</p>\n<p>\"My King,\" Hu Fei quickly replied, \"I was merely joking. I would never dream of laying a finger on you.\"</p>\n<p>There was no urgency for Hu Fei to rid himself of Mo Wuji. He had all the time in the world to verify the validity of Mo Wuji’s title.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji stepped closer to Hu Fei and took the knife from his hand. \"What a fine knife…\" he remarked, feeling its exceptional sharpness.</p>\n<p>As Hu Fei released the knife, he instinctively took a few steps back, eyeing Mo Wuji with caution.</p>\n<p>Yan’Er watched the two with growing anxiety. Even though Mo Wuji now held the knife, she couldn't shake her panic. Having served Mo Wuji for a long time, she knew he was just an ordinary civilian now, stripped of any noble title.</p>\n<p>In essence, since Mo Wuji had initiated the confrontation, if Hu Fei were to kill him, the most he would face would be a minor fine.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji examined the knife, locking eyes with Hu Fei. \"Hu Fei, I'm not using my status to threaten you. Even if I’m no longer part of the royal clan, my ancestors were dukes. You wouldn’t escape punishment for harming their descendant. Hurting someone of royal blood is a blatant disrespect to the Cheng Yu State.\"</p>\n<p>A cold smirk played on Mo Wuji's lips as he finished speaking.</p>\n<p>Hu Fei pondered the truth of Mo Wuji’s claim. If he were indeed part of the royal clan, Hu Fei knew he couldn’t just dispose of him, even with the knife in Mo Wuji's possession. The thought quickly vanished, and he replied, \"My King, I was merely jesting with you.\"</p>\n<p>He couldn’t help but wonder about the sudden shift in Mo Wuji’s demeanor.</p>\n<p>\"I am no longer a king. Leave before I change my mind,\" Mo Wuji said, tucking the knife into his boot.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, yes, Master Mo, please take care,\" Hu Fei replied, his heart aching as he watched Mo Wuji walk away with his knife. It had always been his, and he never expected someone to take it from him today.</p>\n<p>\"Master, you are no longer...\" Yan’Er approached cautiously, whispering to Mo Wuji as Hu Fei left.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji interrupted her, \"I know. We’ll talk when we get back.\"</p>\n<p>Even without Yan’Er’s reminder, he was already aware of his status.</p>\n<p>Their living space was cramped, separated only by an old cloth between two wooden beds. The house held no valuables. Mo Wuji understood that anything of worth would have been sold by Yan’Er to buy sweets for the children.</p>\n<p>He caught a glimpse of himself in the scratched mirror hanging by his bed. He looked like his past self, with long, dry hair neatly tied by Yan’Er. Although his face was pale, it was healthier than Yan’Er’s yellowish, thin visage. Despite his tired eyes, his slick eyebrows and sharp nose gave him a decent handsomeness.</p>\n<p>\"Master, I’ll go to Aunt Lu’s to borrow some rice...\" Yan’Er announced as she entered. She believed Mo Wuji should have taken the pig head meat from Hu Fei instead of the knife.</p>\n<p>\"Wait...\" Mo Wuji stopped her.</p>\n<p>He noticed her curious gaze and asked, \"Yan’Er, Hu Fei seems trained in martial arts. He’s stronger than me. Where did he learn that?\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji recalled that this world wasn’t filled with top martial artists. Why could Hu Fei learn martial arts while he, a noble descendant, could not?</p>\n<p>Yan’Er frowned in disdain. \"Hu Fei barely knows a few moves. He can’t even open his spirit. How can he be called a true martial artist? Your grandfather said your great-grandfather was a genuine spiritual martial artist.\"</p>\n<p>\"What is opening the spirit?\" Mo Wuji asked, his heart racing. In his memory, aside from his previous life, he knew nothing else. Could it be that he was mistaken and this place still allowed for martial arts mastery?</p>\n<p>Excitement surged within him at the thought of learning martial arts. If he ever returned to Earth, he wanted to confront her and ask, “Why?”</p>\n<p>Yan’Er wasn’t surprised by Mo Wuji’s ignorance about the opening of the spirit. What puzzled her was why he suddenly cared about it now.</p>\n<p>Still, she decided to explain, \"Opening the spirit helps someone with spiritual roots awaken them and open their spiritual channels. Only those who have excited roots and opened channels can cultivate and master martial arts. I’ve heard that opening more channels on the first try indicates better quality spiritual roots.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji grasped two key points from her explanation. First, to learn martial arts, one needed spiritual roots. Second, one had to open their spiritual network.</p>\n<p>\"Yan’Er, why didn’t the old master take me to open my spirit?\" Mo Wuji asked, filled with eagerness.</p>\n<p>Yan’Er’s tone grew serious. \"When the old master first came to Rao Zhou City, he was too busy trying to claim the throne. When he realized it was impossible, he wanted you to learn martial arts. He saved enough money for you to test your roots and open your spirit. But after the tests, it was discovered you had mortal roots, just like the old master. Normally, those with mortal roots can’t excite their roots and thus can’t learn martial arts.\"</p>\n<p>\"What are mortal roots?\" Mo Wuji’s heart sank, but he pressed on.</p>\n<p>Having faced death, he felt he could handle anything.</p>\n<p>Yan’Er sensed his disappointment and sighed. \"The old master said one’s roots affect their martial arts future. Those without spiritual roots are called mortal roots, or useless roots. People with mortal roots are just like everyone else.\"</p>\n<p>\"Only mortal roots...\" Mo Wuji could no longer hide his disappointment.</p>\n<p>Yan’Er tried to comfort him. \"Even in Cheng Yu State, only a few have spiritual roots. The rest of us, like you and me, have mortal roots, but we live just fine. I’m sure we will too.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji clenched his fist. \"Yan’Er, I’ll find work tomorrow. I want to save money and try to open my spirit again.\"</p>\n<p>\"Ah...\" Yan’Er was taken aback by his determination but understood his intentions. \"Young master, please don’t. The old master saved money to test your roots. Even after discovering you had mortal roots, he still tried to open your spirit, only to find that mortal roots can never become spiritual roots. After that, he fell ill and passed away not long after...\"</p>\n<p>Her words were heavy, but Mo Wuji understood the implication. If the old master hadn’t attempted to open his spirit, he might have lived longer, even in poverty. He realized the cost of such attempts was significant. Having lived in two worlds, Mo Wuji was not as naive as Yan’Er. He suspected that the old master’s death was not merely due to illness.</p>\n<p>\"Don’t worry, Yan’Er. I’m confident I can earn the money. Starting tomorrow, you won’t need to borrow rice from Aunt Lu. I’ll take care of you,\" Mo Wuji assured her, gently touching her undernourished, yellowish hair.</p>\n<p>Yan’Er was so young. It was heartbreaking to think of how much she had sacrificed after Mo XingHe’s parents died, taking care of a mad Mo XingHe.</p>\n<p>Aunt Lu was merely their landlord, and she had been kind to them. Being a widow, her life wasn’t easy either. Constantly asking her for rice was a burden.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji was still a top-notch botanist in this advanced country. Providing three meals a day should not be a challenge for him.</p>",
