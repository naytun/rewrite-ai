    "Mo Wuji and his companions arrived at the entrance, their eyes drawn to a flattened boulder. Just a few meters ahead, a massive black door loomed, its material a mystery.",
    "Underwater, Pu Qian and the others perceived the door as solid rock. Yet, only Mo Wuji’s spiritual will could detect a small gap at its center.",
    "He raised his hand, signaling Pu Qian and the others to wait. With cautious steps, he approached the door and pushed it gently. Channeling more elemental energy, he felt the door yield, opening steadily.",
    "A brilliant beam of golden light burst forth, stunning Mo Wuji and his companions. Before them lay a vast hall, its walls adorned with dazzling golden inlays that radiated opulence.",
    "Mo Wuji gestured for Sang Yiping and the others to follow, stepping through the door first.",
    "As he crossed the threshold, the crushing water pressure vanished, replaced by an astonishing dryness. It felt as if he had entered a legendary Dragon Palace, where the water flowed outside but could not breach this immense door.",
    "Sang Yiping and the others soon followed, experiencing the same relief. She instinctively gazed upward at a radiant pearl hanging above the door. \"This must be a Water Dispelling Pearl, keeping the seawater at bay,\" she remarked.",
    "The group stared at the pearl, captivated. How valuable could such a Water Dispelling Pearl be? Even the finest spiritual items paled in comparison.",
    "\"Could there truly be an immortal estate here?\" Sang Yiping wondered aloud, her excitement palpable. The presence of the Water Dispelling Pearl suggested something extraordinary lay ahead.",
    "\"The concentration of spiritual energy is incredible. I believe it’s possible,\" Pu Qian chimed in, his enthusiasm evident. The moment he entered, he felt the rich spiritual energy enveloping him. He had never encountered such a potent source since beginning his cultivation. If this was just the entrance, he could only imagine the treasures hidden deeper within.",
    "Sang Yiping's face lit up with anticipation as she turned to Mo Wuji. \"Head senior brother, what should we do?\"",
    "Mo Wuji had already scanned the area with his spiritual will. \"We won't know if this is an immortal estate until we explore further. However, the pearl at the entrance isn’t a Water Dispelling Pearl; it’s part of an illumination array. The reason water can’t enter is due to a water-dispelling array inside.\"",
    "Disappointment washed over the group at his revelation.",
    "Mo Wuji chuckled, \"Even if there’s nothing here, the spiritual energy makes it a perfect place to cultivate. Let’s investigate further.\"",
    "They moved deeper into the luxurious hall, where inscriptions caught their attention: \"So what if you’ve gotten an immortal estate? So what? So what?\"",
    "The repetition of \"So what?\" left them puzzled.",
    "\"Is this really an immortal estate? Have we entered one?\" Sang Yiping asked, astonished.",
    "Even the usually quiet Nie Zhengnong was filled with awe, marveling at his fortune to accompany Mo Wuji into this place.",
    "Mo Wuji sighed, \"This must be where the immortal estate was inherited. Unfortunately, we’re merely standing in the hall. The actual estate has likely been claimed long ago. Look here.\"",
    "He pointed to the floor, where faint but distinct footprints formed a circle, surrounding a dust-free square in the center.",
    "\"Are you saying the immortal estate was in the center? People walked in circles around it before entering? But where did the estate go?\" Sang Yiping questioned, her curiosity piqued.",
    "Pu Qian added, \"I’ve read that top-grade treasures possess consciousness. They recognize their owner and leave with them. Perhaps after the immortal estate was inherited, it followed its new owner.\"",
    "Mo Wuji pondered Pu Qian's words, uncertain about how an immortal estate functioned.",
    "\"What a pity,\" Sang Yiping lamented. \"We find ourselves in a place that once held an immortal estate, yet we leave empty-handed. It’s disappointing, especially with such a magnificent hall.\"",
    "Mo Wuji scrutinized the footprints, concluding they belonged to two individuals. He wished fervently that they were from Mo Xiangtong and Aunt Eleven.",
    "\"We might not be leaving empty-handed. Look, there’s another door here,\" he said, rising to approach the right side of the hall. He pushed against what appeared to be a solid wall.",
    "To their surprise, a small door swung open.",
    "As they stepped through, they were taken aback. Inside was a small bedroom, complete with a bed and a dried corpse lying atop it. In front of the corpse rested a leather roll, a ring, and a crystal-clear jade seal.",
    "Beside the bed stood shelves made of an unknown material, filled with an array of jade vases.",
    "They exchanged glances, confusion etched on their faces. Could this corpse have been cultivating here too?",
    "Mo Wuji approached, retrieving the leather roll, ring, and jade seal. The words on the roll were clear, easily legible to all.",
    "\"Some Jing Gumu fought with over ten experts from the Zhen Mo Continent for the Six Cleanse Immortal Estate before escaping to the Sky Sea, burdened and weary. He landed on Sky Gourd Island to recuperate, but after recovering, the Six Cleanse Immortal Estate proved useless to him. What was the point of fighting so hard for it?",
    "Years of closed cultivation brought me to my limit. Reflecting on the past, I can’t help but feel a deep sense of loss. I have no fate with the Six Cleanse Immortal Estate, so it shall remain here for those with destiny. Those who enter this small room, please take everything. The jade seal can ignite the immortal estate. With a drop of blood, it can recognize its owner. My remains shall not be disturbed...\"",
    "\"I know who this Jing Gumu is,\" Sang Yiping exclaimed after reading the leather roll.",
    "Mo Wuji turned to her, intrigued. \"Who is he?\"",
    "\"He was the sect head of the Heaven Sect. I’ve heard he had a passion for collecting rare treasures. If it was precious, he would pursue it relentlessly...\"",
    "\"Ah, Jing Gumu?\" Pu Qian interjected, recognition dawning.",
    "Mo Wuji pressed on, \"Is this Jing Gumu well-known? Why haven’t I heard of the Heaven Sect?\"",
    "Sang Yiping explained, \"The Heaven Sect was once the largest sect in the Five Big Empires. Even the current Heaven Seeking Palace might not surpass it. Jing Gumu was rumored to have reached the late stage of the heaven realm, the only one in the Five Big Empires to achieve such a feat. However, he was reclusive and arrogant, causing his disciples to be looked down upon. Many years ago, he vanished without a trace.",
    "Without their leader, internal conflicts erupted, leading to the sect's swift downfall. The Heaven Seeking Palace charged the Heaven Sect with ten great sins, erasing their name from the Lost Continent.",
    "The three great heaven sects in the Xing Han Empire—Sky Sword Island, Sky Aria Palace, and Sky Demon Sect—were formed by the descendants of the Heaven Sect. My Tian Ji Sect is also connected to the Heaven Sect; the elder who founded the Heaven Seeking Palace was once an outer disciple there. However, due to my sect's low status, we rarely receive attention.\"",
    "\"Why did the Heaven Seeking Palace want to erase the Heaven Sect?\" Mo Wuji asked.",
    "\"I’ve heard the name Heaven Sect is a taboo for the Heaven Seeking Palace. One represents Heaven, while the other seeks it, inherently inferior. When Jing Gumu was alive, the Heaven Seeking Palace dared not act. But after his disappearance, they showed no restraint,\" Sang Yiping clarified.",
    "Mo Wuji nodded, placing the items back where he found them. \"Let’s discuss this outside.\"",
    "The four of them noticed Mo Wuji not only left the pills on the shelf untouched but also returned the items he had taken before following him out of the small room.",
    "Once outside, Mo Wuji stated, \"From the message left by the Heaven Sect's sect head, we can infer several things. First, if you continue forward from this Sky Sea, you’ll reach the Zhen Mo Continent. Second, given that Jing Gumu was at the late stage of the True God Stage and still severely injured in the Zhen Mo Continent, it indicates many powerful experts reside there. Third, the message outside the immortal estate was likely left by Jing Gumu. Lastly, it’s probable that Sky Gourd Island sank because someone took the immortal estate. Perhaps the setup outside was Jing Gumu's way of ensuring no one disturbed him.\"",
    "Pu Qian quickly agreed with Mo Wuji’s deductions.",
    "Yet, Mo Wuji frowned, raising a few concerns. \"But did you notice some underlying issues?\"",
    "\"What issues?\" Sang Yiping and the others asked in unison.",
    "Mo Wuji pointed toward the hidden room at the back. \"Firstly, the jade seal Jing Gumu mentioned as the key to igniting the immortal estate is still here, yet the estate itself is missing. If it wasn’t ignited, how could it be gone? Secondly, Jing Gumu escaped across the Sky Sea to recuperate. His words suggest he was gravely injured, but who distributed the sea maps of the immortal estate? Lastly, if people could locate the immortal estate, how could they overlook the room where Jing Gumu lay?\"",
    "As he voiced the last point, a chill ran down Mo Wuji's spine. If Aunt Eleven and Mo Xiangtong had taken the immortal estate, it was possible they had missed Jing Gumu’s room. Both had never cultivated before and were likely unaware of the cultivator’s door Dao. Yet, the jade seal remained, raising questions about how they could have taken the immortal estate."
