  "body": "<p>A beam of Invisible Sword Qi sliced through the air, moving with a speed that caught him off guard. It pierced between his brows, and the moment it entered his forehead, it exploded. The force rampaged through his Mind Palace, tearing apart his sea of consciousness.</p>\n<p>What power was this? It felt more like the intermediate Yuan Dan Stage than the Transcending Mortality Stage. Yet, among those present, the crafty young man who seemed the strongest was merely at Transcending Mortality Level 1. The others appeared to have higher cultivation, but their attacks paled in comparison to his.</p>\n<p>Blood gushed from the back of the black-clothed man's skull as the sword qi emerged. He pointed furiously at Mo Wuji, rage boiling within him. He had been tricked twice already and vowed it wouldn’t happen again. Yet here he was, dying by Mo Wuji's third scheme.</p>\n<p>What kind of Transcending Mortality Level 1 was this? It was clearly on par with the intermediate Yuan Dan Stage. But the young man showed no spiritual ripples, no signs of being at that level. Facing death, would anyone hide their abilities? He knew that once he got past this possession, he could easily eliminate these few with a flick of his palm. Yet, the crafty young man concealed his true power, waiting for that final sword qi strike.</p>\n<p>The black-clothed man coughed up blood, the unwillingness in his eyes fading. What was there to be unwilling about? Even if he hadn’t fallen for the tricks this time, he would have next time. This rascal was far too cunning, aware that the concealment array wouldn’t work against him, yet still daring to use it right in front of him. How careless he had been.</p>\n<p>More electroballs descended, stronger than before. With Mo Wuji's earlier attack, the black-clothed man's chances of survival had evaporated. The electroballs blew his brains out, and he ceased to breathe.</p>\n<p>Pu Qian and the others watched in ecstatic disbelief as Mo Wuji killed the black-clothed man. Sang Yiping wiped the cold sweat from her brow. \"Head senior brother, if not for you, we would definitely be dead. You actually killed a True God cultivator. That's truly amazing.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji weakly retrieved a few healing pills, swallowing them. He had concealed his power and, at the last moment, taken a Dire Yuan Pill to explosively increase his elemental energy for that final Invisible Sword Qi. He feared the black-clothed man's forehead would be too tough to pierce. Luckily, his fleshly body wasn’t strong enough to withstand it. The Invisible Sword legacy he had casually learned proved invaluable today.</p>\n<p>\"Don't go over,\" he warned as Pu Qian moved forward. \"I killed that black-clothed man not just because of my trick, but because the Heaven Sect's Sect Head Jing Gumu was trying to possess him. Now that he’s dead, his soul will disperse. But Jing Gumu's abilities far exceed his, and his soul might not dissipate so easily.\"</p>\n<p>As he spoke, Mo Wuji set up a soul confining array around the black-clothed man's corpse with ten array flags.</p>\n<p>\"This sect head hasn't been out for so many years, but are all young people nowadays so powerful?\" A faint shadow emerged from the corpse. Mo Wuji lamented internally; Jing Gumu was indeed not dead. However, his soul was weak, clearly damaged by the black-clothed man.</p>\n<p>\"Sect Head Jing, consider it as I have saved you. If I hadn't killed that black-clothed man, your possession would have failed, and you would have been killed,\" Mo Wuji said calmly.</p>\n<p>The shadow fell silent before replying, \"It was also your trick that prevented me from possessing him. This life-saving act doesn’t count. Now that you’ve achieved your motive, please leave. I wish to return to my quiet cultivation.\"</p>\n<p>\"I can leave, but I have conditions. First, I want the black-clothed man's storage ring. I won't touch your things, even though I could kill you and take them. Second, I have questions for you,\" Mo Wuji stated clearly.</p>\n<p>Jing Gumu's voice turned serious. \"You're threatening me.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji showed no fear. \"You could say so.\"</p>\n<p>From the start, Jing Gumu intended to possess one of the cultivators. If Mo Wuji didn’t seize the opportunity, his body would have become Jing Gumu's. He wouldn’t show courtesy to such a person.</p>\n<p>\"Ask,\" Jing Gumu's tone turned icy.</p>\n<p>\"Where did the Six Cleanse Immortal Estate go? Why is the immortal estate's jade seal here? What is the Zhen Mo Continent? And what about this map we obtained?\" Mo Wuji fired off his questions.</p>\n<p>Jing Gumu's voice carried a hint of reluctance. \"The immortal estate was indeed brought here by me. I tried everything to open it, but it wouldn’t recognize me as its owner. My jade seal contained a trace of my soul will, so if anyone came looking for the immortal estate, they would take my jade seal, allowing me to possess them.\"</p>\n<p>He sighed, \"I never expected the immortal estate would open for someone I invited here. That person didn’t even come to my room…\"</p>\n<p>\"Was it one person or two?\" Mo Wuji interrupted.</p>\n<p>\"I didn’t go out. I only know the immortal estate recognized a master and left. As for the number of people, I have no idea. The Zhen Mo Continent is another cultivator continent across the ocean from the Lost Continent. You can reach it by sailing through the Sky Sea or traversing the Five Elements Desolate Domain. I released the map,\" Jing Gumu explained.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji believed him. The Earth was a spherical planet; it made sense that the two routes led to the Zhen Mo Continent. His only concern was for Aunt Eleven and Mo Xiangtong. He wondered if they were the ones who earned the immortal estate's recognition.</p>\n<p>\"I can give you the black-clothed man's ring and mine. You can also take the spirit vein I was sitting on. I believe the treasures in my ring will not disappoint you,\" Jing Gumu suddenly offered.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji stared at him, doubtful. \"You're so generous?\"</p>\n<p>Given Jing Gumu's history, he was clearly not the type to give things away freely.</p>\n<p>\"Of course, it comes with a condition. Seal me here completely when you leave. Don’t let others find me. Before my soul dissipates, I just wish for a few days of quiet. I’ve put all my effort into cultivation and am truly tired,\" Jing Gumu sighed.</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping and Zhuang Yan were visibly affected by his words, lowering their heads. Would they also one day say, \"I'm truly tired\"?</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji remained silent, his spiritual will probing the spirit vein. After a moment, he said, \"Okay, I agree. But I don’t want your ring or spirit vein. You can choose one of us to possess. And when there’s news about the Six Cleanse Immortal Estate, I’ll send it to you.\"</p>\n<p>The others looked at Mo Wuji in astonishment. Why would he say such things? He rejected the items and offered someone for Jing Gumu to possess? He even promised to send news about the immortal estate?</p>\n<p>Jing Gumu stared at Mo Wuji, disbelief etched on his face. \"You must be kidding me?\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji replied coldly, \"You were the one who started kidding first.\"</p>\n<p>If he were gullible, he would have been dead long ago.</p>\n<p>\"You’re courting death!\" Jing Gumu suddenly unleashed beams of faint light. Slanted black sword shadows descended, transforming into a deadly sword rain that trapped Mo Wuji and his companions.</p>\n<p>This sword rain garrotte array was his ace. It was insufficient to deal with the black-clothed man but more than enough for these Mortal Realm cultivators. Even if Mo Wuji understood arrays, breaking through this would require more than just knowledge; they would need to withstand the sword rain. If they couldn’t, death awaited them. But he wouldn’t kill Mo Wuji; the young man’s body was perfect for possession.</p>\n<p>\"Everyone, don’t move. Concentrate all your elemental energy on me,\" Mo Wuji commanded without hesitation.</p>\n<p>What? Concentrate their energy on him? Even if they cultivated the same technique, how could he use their energy?</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji began forming complex hand seals, hurling them toward the black sword rain. Pu Qian and the others, without time to think, followed his lead.</p>\n<p>The sword rain formed an umbrella above Mo Wuji, crashing down. As the sword shadows fell, rubble filled the air. The power of those shadows was evident. Anyone trapped in this garrotte array would face certain death. Pu Qian and the others silently celebrated; their head senior brother had saved them once again. Without him, they would have perished countless times.</p>\n<p>\"Revolving Star Passage Technique? This is a sacred art…\" Jing Gumu exclaimed in astonishment. Throughout his life, he had collected treasures but never encountered something as valuable as the Revolving Star Passage Technique. It was a sacred art, and an extraordinary one at that.</p>",
