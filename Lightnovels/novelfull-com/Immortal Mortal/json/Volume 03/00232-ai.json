  "body": "<p>Outside Yan City, the air buzzed with celebration. Crowds filled the streets, laughter and cheers mingling with the scent of food. Despite the recent tragedy at Yin Tomb Beach, where countless cultivators had fallen, the defeat of the alien invaders was a cause for joy.</p>\n<p>Invitations had gone out to the heads of the larger sects, all summoned to Yan City for a grand banquet honoring the experts from Zhen Mo Continent. Cultivators from all walks of life gathered, setting aside their rivalries to partake in the festivities for the Lost Continent.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji and his group of five stood at the edge of the city, bewildered by the jubilant scene before them. \"Head senior brother, what’s happening?\" Sang Yiping asked, his brow furrowed in confusion.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji shook his head, uncertainty clouding his thoughts. \"Let’s ask around first.\" He had anticipated a different outcome, one where the Hundred Sect Alliance faced defeat. Yet, the reality was a resounding victory.</p>\n<p>As they pushed through the throng, snippets of conversation reached their ears, gradually piecing together the truth. The Zhen Mo Continent's experts had arrived just in time to turn the tide.</p>\n<p>\"The elder from Zhen Mo Continent simply lifted his hand, and tens of thousands fell before him,\" one voice exclaimed, awe lacing his tone.</p>\n<p>Another scoffed, \"You must be exaggerating. I know the Zhen Mo Continent lacks that many True God Stage experts.\"</p>\n<p>Yet another chimed in, \"I saw it! He truly killed many with a single gesture.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji listened intently, piecing together the puzzle. The Zhen Mo Continent had sent powerful allies, and he realized the individuals Jing Gumu had encountered were not as formidable as he had assumed.</p>\n<p>\"Head senior brother…\" Sang Yiping's voice broke through his thoughts. Mo Wuji nodded, determination settling in. \"We’ll leave now. I need to visit Heaven Seeking Palace first. I’m still a disciple there. After that, I’ll focus on rebuilding Tian Ji Sect.\"</p>\n<p>The Tian Shang Palace stood as the pinnacle of luxury in Yan City, yet it was not the venue for welcoming the Zhen Mo Continent’s experts. King Zhao Dan of the Tian Shang Empire sat far from the head table, a mere spectator in this grand affair.</p>\n<p>The atmosphere shifted as the handsome youth in purple robes took his place at the top seat, not the expected elder with the white beard. He surveyed the hall with a charming smile. \"We are from Zhen Mo Continent. I am Xia Mu, a special envoy from Star King Mountain.\"</p>\n<p>He gestured to the elder beside him, \"This is Defender Xu, a man I deeply respect.\"</p>\n<p>Xia Mu’s gaze lingered on Bei Suting, the First Dean of Heaven Seeking Palace. She stood, her voice steady, \"Heaven Seeking Palace’s Bei Suting greets Special Envoy Xia and Defender Xu.\"</p>\n<p>The other sect heads followed her lead, but Xia Mu remained silent, his demeanor calm yet unyielding.</p>\n<p>The tension escalated when the red-faced man beside him spoke, \"Isn’t it disrespectful for you to speak while veiled, Bei Suting?\"</p>\n<p>A hush fell over the hall, the celebratory mood evaporating. Bei Suting felt the weight of the room’s gaze. \"I swore never to remove my veil until my dao is complete,\" she replied, her voice firm yet respectful.</p>\n<p>Xia Mu’s expression darkened, the warmth fading from his smile. The red-faced man added, \"Entering Star King Mountain could change that. With your talent, you could reach the Worldly Immortal Stage.\"</p>\n<p>The mention of the Worldly Immortal Stage ignited a spark of desire among the sect heads. They exchanged glances, ambition flickering in their eyes. Bei Suting’s heart raced at the thought, but she remained composed.</p>\n<p>\"Special Envoy Xia, your talent is remarkable, but I am not seeking a dao partner at this time,\" she said, her tone measured.</p>\n<p>Xia Mu’s disappointment was palpable. \"Sister Suting, you are extraordinary. Your beauty and talent are unmatched. I believe you would thrive at Star King Mountain.\"</p>\n<p>The air thickened with unspoken tension. Bei Suting understood the implications of his words. \"Thank you for your kindness, but my path is my own. If I am meant to enter Star King Mountain, it will be determined by my luck.\"</p>\n<p>Defender Xu interjected, breaking the mounting pressure. \"Let’s set aside these distractions. We have important matters to discuss today.\"</p>\n<p>Xia Mu nodded, regaining his composure. \"Indeed, I represent Star King Mountain, and aside from defeating the alien cultivators, I have two important matters to address.\"</p>",
