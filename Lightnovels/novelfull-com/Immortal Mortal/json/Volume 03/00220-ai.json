  "body": "<p>The moment was charged with tension as Da Shixiong rallied the cultivators. The stone door trembled under the weight of their urgency. Mo Wuji's voice cut through the chaos, igniting a spark of action. In unison, they drew their magic treasures, their determination palpable. The air crackled with energy as they unleashed their combined might against the stone door.</p>\n<p>A crack splintered across its surface, and they surged through, escaping the impending collapse. The stone staircase loomed ahead, a beacon of hope. They rushed upward, hearts pounding, desperate to flee the chaos below.</p>\n<p>Outside, two cultivators paused mid-battle, their eyes widening in shock as figures erupted from the ground. Mo Wuji's gaze locked onto Granny Linglong. She was a shadow of her former self, bloodied and weary, propped against a rock, gasping for breath. Her opponent, a man cloaked in black, mirrored her state of disarray.</p>\n<p>Granny Linglong's heart sank as she recognized Mo Wuji. Hope flickered and dimmed. She had anticipated help from a powerful ally, perhaps an elder from Heaven Seeking Palace. Instead, it was Mo Wuji—an unassuming figure, far from the savior she had hoped for.</p>\n<p>The black-clothed man assessed the newcomers, his confidence swelling. They were weak, no threat to him. His focus returned to Granny Linglong, the prey he had hunted relentlessly. But before he could strike, Mo Wuji's voice rang out, urging caution. \"Everyone, don’t scatter! The corpse cultivator has the immortal estate and will come for us. We must ambush him when he emerges. If we fail, scatter in different directions. One escapee can keep the secret safe.\"</p>\n<p>The mention of an immortal estate sent shockwaves through the air. Granny Linglong's heart raced. The black-clothed man’s eyes narrowed, intrigued yet wary. An immortal estate was a treasure beyond imagination, a relic of the legendary immortals.</p>\n<p>\"Boom!\" The ground shook with another explosion, the stench of decay wafting through the air. Panic surged within the black-clothed man. Mo Wuji's words echoed in his mind—this corpse cultivator was a threat that needed to be eliminated.</p>\n<p>\"Everyone, attack!\" Mo Wuji commanded, wielding his Tian Ji Pole with fierce determination. He sensed the urgency; the immortal estate was a secret too precious to reveal.</p>\n<p>The black-clothed man lunged at the corpse cultivator, his focus shifting entirely. Mo Wuji watched as beams of light erupted, ensnaring the undead foe. Some cultivators hesitated, glancing at each other, unsure whether to flee or fight. Most chose to stay, knowing escape was futile without a ship.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji approached Granny Linglong, bowing respectfully. \"Elder, your strength surpasses ours. Will you join forces with the black-clothed man against the corpse cultivator? If he escapes, it will spell disaster for us all.\"</p>\n<p>Granny Linglong understood the weight of his words. She admired Mo Wuji's strategy, recognizing the wisdom in his plea. Yet, she felt the weight of her own limitations. \"I’ve been poisoned. I can’t recover quickly. Did the corpse cultivator truly obtain the immortal estate?\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji turned to Pu Qian, urgency in his voice. \"Brother Pu, show her the map of the immortal estate.\"</p>\n<p>Without hesitation, Pu Qian handed over the sea map. Mo Wuji unfurled it, revealing their path. \"We came here seeking the immortal estate, only to be ambushed by the corpse cultivator. He intends to silence us.\"</p>\n<p>The black-clothed man, still engaged in battle, kept a wary eye on Granny Linglong. He feared losing sight of the corpse cultivator, but Mo Wuji's revelation ignited a new fervor in his attacks.</p>\n<p>As the battle raged, Mo Wuji leaned closer to Granny Linglong. \"What poison afflicts you?\"</p>\n<p>She sighed, her voice heavy with resignation. \"A nerve poison. I can’t create an antidote quickly. It requires a Tier 7 Heavenly Pill, the Solitary Dark Pill...\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji's eyes widened. \"Did you say nerve poison?\" He quickly offered her a jade bottle. \"Take this broken pill. The corpse cultivator is weak; we can defeat him.\"</p>\n<p>Granny Linglong hesitated, recognizing the significance of the pill. \"Is this a Solitary Dark Pill? You...\"</p>\n<p>She swallowed the broken pill, closing her eyes as she felt its effects take hold.</p>\n<p>The black-clothed man sensed something amiss and shot a beam of light at her. Mo Wuji reacted instinctively, swinging his Tian Ji Pole to intercept the attack. The collision sent him flying, but he was caught mid-air by Pu Qian.</p>\n<p>The black-clothed man, desperate and wounded, unleashed a surge of power. \"Boom!\" The red light engulfed the corpse cultivator, severing its head cleanly. The explosion scattered remnants of the undead foe.</p>\n<p>Granny Linglong sprang to her feet, a three-legged cauldron soaring towards the black-clothed man. Mo Wuji watched in awe, realizing the source of Shi Jinwen's affinity for pill cauldrons.</p>\n<p>\"Bang!\" The cauldron struck the man, forcing him to stagger, blood spilling from his lips. Yet, he remained focused on the spoils of battle, gathering treasures from the corpse cultivator before vanishing in a flash of red light.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji stood in disbelief, grappling with the black-clothed man's extraordinary abilities. Granny Linglong sighed in relief, gratitude shining in her eyes. \"Mo Wuji, you saved me today.\"</p>\n<p>\"We helped each other, Elder. If you hadn’t opened the door, we would have perished,\" he replied, puzzled by the black-clothed man's escape. \"How did he vanish without a trace?\"</p>\n<p>Granny Linglong explained, \"He used the Water Escape Technique, a heaven-grade technique. Even Heaven Seeking Palace lacks such a treasure.\"</p>\n<p>With the corpse cultivator defeated and the black-clothed man gone, the remaining cultivators began to depart. Granny Linglong watched as they thanked Mo Wuji, some even calling him Da Shixiong. Confusion clouded her mind; she had not kept up with the latest gossip and was unaware of his true reputation.</p>\n<p>Zhuang Yan, however, remained resolute, her heart steeled against further deception. Pu Qian and a few others lingered, sensing that their journey with Mo Wuji was far from over.</p>\n<p>\"Do you have business with me?\" Mo Wuji asked, sensing their lingering presence.</p>",
