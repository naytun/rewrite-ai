    "Granny Linglong approached, her voice steady yet curious. \"Is everything ready? If it is, we should leave now.\"",
    "Mo Wuji hurriedly replied, \"Senior, could you please take four of my friends back to Heaven Seeking City first? I might need to stay here for a few days before I return.\"",
    "He turned to Sang Yiping, Pu Qian, and the others. \"I have two friends who came here searching for an immortal estate. I want to look for them a bit longer. If I can't find them in a few days, I'll head back immediately.\"",
    "Granny Linglong raised an eyebrow. \"How will you return?\"",
    "Mo Wuji sighed, \"I have a flying car.\"",
    "With a swift motion, he produced the flying car, its sleek design glinting in the light.",
    "\"Ah, this flying car looks familiar,\" Granny Linglong exclaimed, surprise etched on her face.",
    "Mo Wuji guessed she recognized it. \"This was a gift from Cen, the senior apprentice sister from Sword Lake.\"",
    "Granny Linglong regarded him with a knowing look. \"Very well, then. Let's leave now. Everyone, board the car.\"",
    "Sang Yiping stepped forward eagerly. \"Senior Mo, there may be few demonic beasts at sea, but there are likely stranded cultivators. Since you have a flying car, why not let us help with your search?\"",
    "Mo Wuji pondered her suggestion. She was right; there were likely stranded cultivators, and he had the means to assist. Returning would be different this time; he knew the direction and timing to reach back safely. His flying car could accommodate six or seven people, so bringing Sang Yiping and the others along wouldn't hinder him. In fact, if they returned alone and were spotted by someone from the Lei Clan, it could lead to real danger. If Hou Yucheng discovered that Mo Wuji had purchased the first style of the Seven Styles Lightning Sky, the Lei Clan could easily connect the dots and wait for him at Heaven Seeking City.",
    "\"Alright, let's go together,\" Mo Wuji decided. He turned to Granny Linglong. \"Senior, you can head back first. Please take care of Yan’Er for me.\"",
    "He said this with confidence. With her unique five elemental spiritual roots and rapid cultivation speed, the Heaven Seeking Palace would treat Yan’Er like a treasure, even without his reminder.",
    "Granny Linglong nodded, understanding the bond between Mo Wuji and his friends. \"I will take my leave then. Be cautious of the black-clothed man. He may not have escaped far. Though I wounded him severely, he remains a formidable opponent.\"",
    "\"I understand,\" Mo Wuji replied. \"Do you know what realm of cultivation he is in now?\"",
    "Back in Yan City, he had learned that the alien cultivator he accidentally killed was at the Great Circle of the Nihility God Stage. The points awarded for killing such a cultivator were significant, and he had gained a hefty sum when he defeated the alien's partner.",
    "Granny Linglong's expression turned serious. \"That man is likely as strong as I am, possibly in the True God Stage Level 1.\"",
    "Mo Wuji gasped, realizing the gravity of her words. He had known Granny Linglong was a Tier 7 pill refiner, but he hadn't anticipated her cultivation level was even higher.",
    "\"Yes, I am indeed in True God Stage Level 1. If not for that ambush and the poison, I would not fear facing him,\" she said, then paused. \"Mo Wuji, where did you acquire your Solitary Dark Pill? Why was it broken? There are only two pill refiners in the Five Big Empires capable of concocting it, and I am one of them.\"",
    "Mo Wuji thought of Honest Qi, who he believed was still alive. He reminded himself that once he officially joined Tian Ji Sect, he would need to be wary of Honest Qi.",
    "\"This was something I found by chance. I recognized it as the Solitary Dark Pill because of my knowledge of pills,\" Mo Wuji replied, omitting any mention of Honest Qi or his spiritual will.",
    "Granny Linglong didn't press further. She stepped onto the flying ship. \"I shall take my leave now. Please take care.\"",
    "With that, the flying ship cast a shadow before vanishing into the sky above the Sky Sea.",
    "Once she was gone, Sang Yiping turned to Mo Wuji, her eyes wide with curiosity. \"Is that senior really in the True God Stage of the Heaven Realm?\" Pu Qian and the others looked at him with excitement. To them, a Heaven Realm expert was a legendary figure.",
    "Mo Wuji smiled. \"Indeed, she is Granny Linglong of the Heaven Seeking Palace. I am fortunate to have met her.\"",
    "Sang Yiping gasped. \"But didn't people say she had an eccentric character and was extremely uncompassionate?\"",
    "Mo Wuji shook his head. \"If she were compassionate, she wouldn't have time to cultivate daily. Those who fail to engage with her often insult her character. Some things can only be understood through personal experience.\"",
    "Zhuang Yan chimed in, \"Yes, this Senior Linglong is quite friendly, unlike the rumors suggest.\"",
    "Sang Yiping nodded. \"True, she is the greatest pill refiner in the Five Great Empires. If she helped everyone who asked, she would never reach the True God Stage.\"",
    "Mo Wuji executed a few hand seals on his flying car, starting its engines. \"Let's leave this place. It's not safe to linger here.\"",
    "With a corpse cultivator undergoing closed-door cultivation nearby, Mo Wuji felt uneasy. He knew little about what a corpse cultivator needed, but he sensed danger in staying.",
    "The group boarded the flying car, which, while not large, comfortably accommodated them. They quickly bonded as members of Tian Ji Sect. Only Zhuang Yan seemed a bit downcast, still grappling with her feelings for Qi Wenxuan.",
    "Half a day later, Mo Wuji's flying car circled a region in the sea.",
    "After hovering for over an hour, Sang Yiping asked, \"Head senior brother, why are we circling here?\"",
    "Mo Wuji pulled out the map Jing Lengbei had drawn. \"This is the sea map I received. According to it, there should be a gourd-shaped island here. But I see no island, which makes me suspect the map might be wrong.\"",
    "Sang Yiping's eyes widened. \"This map is an immortal estate map, but the location seems different from ours.\"",
    "Mo Wuji nodded. \"Yes, it is an immortal estate map, but I suspect it could be fake...\"",
    "\"Head senior brother, this is not a fake map. I was here about a month ago before my ship sank. I saw a gourd-shaped island here, but now it’s gone,\" Pu Qian interjected.",
    "Realization dawned on them, and they spoke in unison. \"That gourd-shaped island sunk.\"",
    "Mo Wuji declared, \"I want to dive down to investigate.\"",
    "\"Let's go down together. There might truly be an immortal estate there,\" Sang Yiping said, excitement flickering in her eyes. The prospect of an immortal estate could mean great things for Tian Ji Sect.",
    "Mo Wuji retrieved a rope. \"We’ll descend together. Hold on tightly and stay close behind me.\"",
    "Zhuang Yan, being the weakest, was still capable of surviving underwater for a while. Once everyone had a grip on the rope, Mo Wuji stored the flying car and jumped into the sea, Zhuang Yan following closely behind.",
    "The seawater was frigid, and the pressure intensified as they descended. After several hundred meters, Zhuang Yan struggled to keep up. Mo Wuji quickly produced a Dire Yuan Pill and urged her to swallow it.",
    "The Dire Yuan Pill stimulated her inner elemental energy, boosting her strength temporarily, though it came with side effects. After taking it, Zhuang Yan felt a surge of energy, and the surrounding pressure eased. She nodded gratefully at Mo Wuji, relieved that she could stay submerged without needing to surface.",
    "As they continued their descent, Sang Yiping and Pu Qian began to falter. Finally, their feet touched the seabed.",
    "They collectively sighed in relief, but soon realized they weren't standing on solid ground. Instead, they were on a grassy surface. Pu Qian was the first to recognize the significance. \"We must be on the gourd-shaped island, but it has sunk to the ocean floor.\"",
    "Mo Wuji, using his spiritual will, scanned the area, confirming their location. They were indeed on Gourd Island.",
    "He gestured for the others to follow as he moved toward the entrance of the gourd. The island was small, and with their swift underwater speed, they reached the mouth of the gourd in no time. Peering inside, Mo Wuji detected an entrance leading into the island."
