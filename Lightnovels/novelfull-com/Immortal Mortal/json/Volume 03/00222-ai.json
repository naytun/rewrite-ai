If it is, we shall leave now.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji hurriedly replied, \"Senior, could you please take four of my friends back to Heaven Seeking City first? I might need to stay here for a few days.\"</p>\n<p>He turned to Sang Yiping, Pu Qian, and the others. \"I have two friends who came here searching for an immortal estate. I want to look for them a bit longer. If I can't find them in a few days, I'll return immediately.\"</p>\n<p>Granny Linglong raised an eyebrow, curiosity evident in her gaze. \"How will you get back?\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji hesitated, then admitted, \"I have a flying car.\"</p>\n<p>As he spoke, he produced the flying car, its sleek design glinting in the light.</p>\n<p>\"Ah, this flying car looks very familiar,\" Granny Linglong exclaimed, surprise coloring her tone.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji guessed she recognized it. \"This is a gift from Sword Lake’s senior apprentice sister, Cen.\"</p>\n<p>Granny Linglong regarded him with a knowing look. \"Alright, then. We shall leave now. Everyone, get on board.\"</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping stepped forward eagerly. \"Senior Mo, while there may be few demonic beasts at sea, there are likely stranded cultivators. Since you have a flying car, why not let us help with your search?\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji considered her words. She was right. With his flying car, he could navigate back more easily than he had come. He could also fit everyone comfortably, and it was safer to travel together. If they returned separately, they might attract unwanted attention from the Lei Clan, especially if they discovered his connection to the Seven Styles Lightning Sky.</p>\n<p>\"Alright, let’s go together,\" he decided. He turned to Granny Linglong. \"Senior, you can head back first. Please take care of Yan’Er for me.\"</p>\n<p>He said this knowing that with her unique five elemental spiritual roots and rapid cultivation speed, Yan’Er would be treated as a treasure at Heaven Seeking Palace.</p>\n<p>Granny Linglong nodded, her expression serious. \"I shall take my leave then. Be cautious of the black-clothed man. He may not have escaped far. Even though I wounded him, he remains a formidable opponent.\"</p>\n<p>\"I understand,\" Mo Wuji replied. \"Do you know what realm of cultivation he is in now?\"</p>\n<p>Back in Yan City, he had learned that the alien cultivator he had killed was in the Great Circle of the Nihility God Stage. The points awarded for such a kill were significant, and he had gained a hefty sum for defeating the partner of that alien.</p>\n<p>Granny Linglong's face turned grave. \"He should be as strong as I am, possibly in the True God Stage Level 1.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji gasped, realizing the depth of her strength. \"Senior, you are in the True God Stage?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" she confirmed. \"If not for his ambush and the poison he used, I wouldn’t fear facing him.\"</p>\n<p>She paused, then asked, \"Where did you get your Solitary Dark Pill? Why was it broken? There are only two of us in the Five Big Empires who can concoct it, and I am one of them.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji thought of Honest Qi, who he suspected was still alive. He reminded himself to be cautious of him when he officially joined Tian Ji Sect.</p>\n<p>\"This was something I found by chance. I recognized it as the Solitary Dark Pill because of my knowledge of pills,\" he explained, omitting any mention of Honest Qi.</p>\n<p>Granny Linglong didn’t press further. She stepped onto the flying ship. \"I shall take my leave now. Please take care.\"</p>\n<p>With that, the flying ship cast a shadow before vanishing into the vast sky of the Sky Sea.</p>\n<p>As soon as she left, Sang Yiping turned to Mo Wuji, her eyes wide with curiosity. \"Is that senior really in the True God Stage of the Heaven Realm?\" Pu Qian and the others looked at him with eager anticipation. To them, a Heaven Realm expert was a figure of legend.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji smiled. \"Indeed, she is Granny Linglong of the Heaven Seeking Palace. I feel fortunate to have met her.\"</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping gasped. \"But didn’t people say she had an eccentric character and was extremely uncompassionate?\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji shook his head. \"If she were compassionate, she wouldn’t have time to cultivate. Those who fail to interact with her often insult her character. You must experience things firsthand to discern the truth behind the rumors.\"</p>\n<p>Zhuang Yan chimed in, \"Yes, she seems friendly, unlike the tales of her temper.\"</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping nodded. \"True, she is the greatest pill refiner in the Five Great Empires. If she helped everyone who asked, she would never reach the True God Stage.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji executed a few hand seals on his flying car to start it. \"Let’s leave this place. We shouldn’t linger here.\"</p>\n<p>With a corpse cultivator in closed-door cultivation nearby, Mo Wuji felt uneasy. He knew little about what a corpse cultivator required, but he sensed this location was not safe.</p>\n<p>Everyone climbed aboard the flying car, which, while not large, comfortably accommodated them. They quickly bonded as members of Tian Ji Sect. Only Zhuang Yan appeared dejected, still grappling with her feelings for Qi Wenxuan.</p>\n<p>Half a day later, Mo Wuji’s flying car circled a region in the sea.</p>\n<p>After hovering for over an hour, Sang Yiping asked, \"Head senior brother, why are we circling here?\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji pulled out the map Jing Lengbei had drawn. \"According to this map, there should be a gourd-shaped island here. But there’s nothing around, making me suspect the map might be wrong.\"</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping’s eyes lit up. \"This map is an immortal estate map, but the location seems different from ours.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji nodded. \"Yes, it’s an immortal estate map, but it could be a fake…\"</p>\n<p>\"Head senior brother, this isn’t a fake map. I was here about a month ago before my ship sank. I saw a gourd-shaped island here, but now it’s gone,\" Pu Qian interjected.</p>\n<p>They exchanged glances, realization dawning. \"That gourd-shaped island sunk.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji declared, \"I want to dive down to investigate.\"</p>\n<p>\"Let’s go together. There might really be an immortal estate there,\" Sang Yiping said, excitement dancing in her eyes. The prospect of an immortal estate could elevate Tian Ji Sect.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji retrieved a rope. \"We’ll go down together. Hold on tightly and stay close.\"</p>\n<p>Zhuang Yan, the weakest among them, was still capable of surviving underwater for a few days. Once everyone had a grip on the rope, Mo Wuji stored the flying car and jumped into the sea, Zhuang Yan following closely behind.</p>\n<p>The seawater was frigid, and the pressure intensified as they descended. After a few hundred meters, Zhuang Yan struggled to keep up. Mo Wuji quickly produced a Dire Yuan Pill, urging her to swallow it.</p>\n<p>The pill stimulated her inner elemental energy, enhancing her strength. The pressure around her eased, and she nodded gratefully at Mo Wuji. Without the pill, she would have had to surface, risking exposure and danger.</p>\n<p>As they dove deeper, Sang Yiping and Pu Qian began to falter. Their feet finally touched the seabed.</p>\n<p>They sighed in relief, but soon realized they weren’t on solid ground. Instead, they stood on a grassy expanse. Pu Qian was the first to recognize it. \"We’re on the gourd-shaped island, but it’s sunk.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji used his spiritual will to scan the area, confirming their location. They were indeed on Gourd Island.</p>\n<p>He gestured for the others to follow as he moved toward the entrance of the gourd. The island was small, and their swift underwater speed brought them to the mouth of the gourd in no time. Using his spiritual will, he detected an entrance inside.</p>",
