Even though he was going to win, he did not feel contented. He came to understand that the other party was truly a rogue cultivator. Only a rogue cultivator would not have his own weapon art.</p><p>Mo Wuji looked at the spear shadows and spear intent which blotted out the entire sky and his face was calm without expression. It was true that he did not have any pole related skills but he had a sacred art. Compared to a sacred art, skills count for naught.</p><p>His Revolving Star Passage Technique had already been cultivated to the Dou Stage Third Level, Solitary Dreamstar. When Gu Shaoyin had forcefully released his spear shadow, Mo Wuji moved.</p><p>The Tian Ji Pole drew half an arc on the Surface Slicing Spear Shadow. Under the control of Mo Wuji’s spiritual will, he formed a curved screen with elemental energy. Thereafter, the number of pole shadows released increased drastically, blurring up that curved screen.</p><p>Gu Shaoyin suddenly felt that the Mo Wuji in front of him had disappeared. In front of him, was an empty starry sky; he was alone in this starry sky and he had lost all sense of direction and location.</p><p>This is an illusion, it's definitely an illusory skill. Gu Shaoyin immediately closed his eyes; his spear shadows and killing intent thickened.</p><p>At the next moment, Gu Shaoyin reopened his eyes. He discovered that even when he closed his eyes, he still felt that his spear intent was facing a solitary, vast starry sky. In front of his spear shadows were countless dreamlike stars.</p><p>\"Bang!\" The spear's killing intent clashed against those dreamlike stars and it instantly transformed into nothingness, dispersing among the starry sky. A horrifying backlash came rebounding back and Gu Shaoyin's heart was filled with shock. How could Rogue Cultivator 2705 to be so strong, to defend against his Surface Slicing Spear Shadow under such circumstances? And there was even such a strong rebound of elemental energy?</p><p>That's not right, this rebound did not seem to be of much threat to him.</p><p>Boundless amounts of sand and dust filled the air; Gu Shaoyin finally noticed that his spear did not land on Mo Wuji but struck against a sturdy rock by the side. That rock shattered into four to five pieces. At this moment, he saw Mo Wuji's incoming Tian Ji Pole.</p><p>I’m going to die. Gu Shaoyin’s heart turned icy cold.</p><p>Mo Wuji did not celebrate. If not for his Revolving Star Passage Technique advancing to the third level of the Dou Stage, Gu Shaoyin’s spear art would have left him straggled.</p><p>By the side, Cen Shuyin was observing the two's battle with wide eyes. But everything had happened too fast and she completely didn't have the chance to interfere. When she was prepared to rush in and save Mo Wuji, the situation suddenly changed. The Gu Shaoyin, who originally held the absolute advantage, was now facing the threat of death from Mo Wuji.</p><p>Before Cen Shuyin could heave a sigh of relief, from the corner of her eyes, she saw a red faced man suddenly emerging from the forest.</p><p>When she saw that person, her heart immediately sunk. She recognised this man, he was the red faced cultivator who was always beside Special Envoy Xia. Furthermore, she had even seen this person act out before, and his power was second only to that black haired, white bearded Worldly Immortal King.</p><p>Back then, he was standing on the flying ship and with a single punch, he blasted away the alien True God expert who wanted to ambush the ship.</p><p>Not good. Cen Shuyin was able to be Sword Lake’s legacy disciple because of her talent alone. In that instant, she knew that the red faced man had definitely appeared so as to save Gu Shaoyin.</p><p>Not caring about anything else, Cen Shuyin jumped straight towards Mo Wuji.</p><p>For an expert like this red faced man to save Gu Shaoyin from Mo Wuji, there must at least be 100 different ways. However, Cen Shuyin believed that he would directly kill this Rogue Cultivator 2705. There was no other reason, it was simply because that Special Envoy Xia believed Rogue Cultivator 2705 was her dao companion.</p><p>\"Pui Pui Pui!\" Four to five consecutive spurts of blood flashed in front of Mo Wuji's eyes. Light beams had perforated through Cen Shuyin's chest and were now racing towards Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji's face changed drastically; with a lift of his Tian Ji Pole and a twist of his body, two bloodied light beams were blocked by his Tian Ji Pole and a third one was avoided. The fourth and fifth ones pierced through his body, drawing blood once more.</p><p>\"Plop!\" Cen Shuyin landed in Mo Wuji's embrace.</p><p>Mo Wuji finally came to a realisation; Cen Shuyin did not jump to him to save that black robed youth, but to help him block these killer light beams. These killer light had perforated through Cen Shuyin's body, turning into bloodied light.</p><p>Mo Wuji fetched a few healing pills which he placed into Cen Shuyin's mouth and he swallowed some at the same time. His spiritual will instantly started scanning outwards as he tried to find out who had ambushed him.</p><p>\"Sorry.\" While in Mo Wuji's embrace, Cen Shuyin said a word which left Mo Wuji confused.</p><p>\"What’s exactly going on?\" Mo Wuji asked coldly.</p><p>Cen Shuyin's voice was weak, \"I implicated you… They followed me here, I really didn't know…\"</p><p>Mo Wuji nodded, \"I believe you.\"</p><p>He really believed Cen Shuyin. Even though they weren't extremely good friends, he had no qualms towards her character.</p><p>\"Thank you…\" After Cen Shuyin said those two words, her head tilted to the side, never to breath again.</p><p>Mo Wuji forced himself to calm down. It was exactly this moment that he could not have rage cloud his judgement. Just now, if Cen Shuyin did not slow those light beams now, he would have already been killed. The reason why Cen Shuyin apologized to him didn't matter; it was undeniable that his life was saved by Cen Shuyin.</p><p>\"Not bad, you're really quite strong. I want to know something, your body does not exude even a half bit of spirituality, and even I am unable to discern your cultivation, how exactly did you do that?\" A red faced man appeared from the nearby forest.</p><p>Mo Wuji responded slowly, one word at a time, \"Who are you? Why did you want to kill me?\"</p><p>Mo Wuji forcefully suppressed the boundless rage brewing in his heart to maintain his clarity of mind. The other party's cultivation was far stronger than that black clothed True God expert he faced before. Such an expert actually sneak attacked a Transcending Mortality Stage cultivator. He even ignored Cen Shuyin's death, how could Mo Wuji not be angry?</p><p>\"Elder Ceng, what's the meaning of this?\" Gu Shaoyin had slowly came to his senses and he asked with a low voice.</p><p>The red faced man snorted, \"If I didn't save you, would you still be alive? Ungrateful.\"</p><p>Gu Shaoyin’s face turned ugly. He turned towards Mo Wuji, clasped his fists and said, \"I'm not your opponent. From now on, I'm also not the Mortal Board number one. Tell me, what's your name?\"</p><p>\"Rogue Cultivator 2705.\" Mo Wuji coldly replied, his eyes fixed on that red faced man. Even if this red faced man didn't act, he also wouldn't have killed Gu Shaoyin.</p><p>Gu Shaoyin sighed inwardly and he turned and left. In the blink of an eye, he had disappeared. He knew, he could not save Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji also knew, he might not escape with his life today. Regretfully, there were many things he had yet to do. If he just died like this, it would truly be such a deep regret.</p><p>\"I'm not the one who wants to kill you, it's the Star King Mountain's special envoy who wants to kill you,\" the red faced man said faintly. \"Because the special envoy had eyes for your dao companion but your dao companion was not willing.\"</p><p>My dao companion? Mo Wuji looked down towards the lifeless Cen Shuyin and developed a faint understanding of the situation. If Cen Shuyin had really used him as a shield, then he was truly maligned.</p><p>However, he still believed that Cen Shuyin wasn't such a person. He understood Cen Shuyin, she definitely wouldn't use him as a shield just to protect herself.</p><p>\"If you want to kill me, then do it.\" Mo Wuji's voice was calm. Unfortunately, he did not have the chance to widen the gap. Otherwise, with his laser cannon, this fella would be turned to dust.</p><p>Even though he knew that he did not have a chance, Mo Wuji still gathered his elemental energy. Before he died, he would give this red faced b*stard a solid blast of Lightning Flash. If a chance arises, he would immediately jump into the cliff behind him.</p><p>However, Mo Wuji knew his odds; the probability that he could jump down the cliff with this red faced cultivator here was close to naught. From another perspective, jumping down might even be useless.</p><p>The red faced cultivator did not immediately kill him, but took a few steps forward and asked, \"The spirituality around your body is weak, like you have poor spiritual roots. How did you achieve such a powerful level? Or, how did you hide your cultivation?\"</p><p>After a short pause, he continued, \"You only have one chance to answer. If you give me a good answer, I might spare your life.\"</p><p>\"I can answer you, but answer my question first. Who are you, did you come from the Zhen Mo Continent?\" Mo Wuji remained calm and asked.</p><p>If he could have yet another life, even if he had to travel through multiple galaxies, he would come and find where this red faced cultivator stayed, and blast him into smithereens. [1]</p><p>\"Haha… You still think you have a chance to take revenge?\" With that, the red faced cultivator raised his hand again, two beams of light shot out. Mo Wuji could clearly see the presence of these two beams of light but he was unable to dodge it.</p><p>\"Pui Pui!\" Two streams of blood sprayed from his body. Two fractures appeared on the ground beneath him, he had used the Revolving Star Passage Technique to shift most of the attack towards the ground.</p><p>\"Oh right, there's still one more thing I actually forgot to ask you. At the end, you managed to defend against Gu Shaoyin's Surface Slicing Spear Shadow. That wasn't a skill right? If I guessed correctly, it should be a sacred art. Answer me, what is that sacred art, where did you get it from? To help you give me your answers heartily, I will answer you first. This lord comes from the Star King Mountain Xia Clan. I am the Xia Clan Elder Ceng Houyi.\" Seeing Mo Wuji redirect a large portion of the power of his light beams to the ground, the red faced cultivator asked another question.</p><p>Mo Wuji quietly and stealthily took a few steps back and he maintained calm without emotion, \"I only have one sentence to tell you. If I ever come back to being, I will definitely kill my way to the Star King Mountain and destroy your Xia Clan.\"</p><p>With that, Mo Wuji exhaled a long breath. He had been killed twice and both times were due to someone with the surname 'Xia’.</p><p>\"You don't have to retreat because you won't have a chance to jump down the cliff. If I were you, I would honestly answer the questions.\" Ceng Houyi seemed to see through Mo Wuji's thoughts; his tone was icy cold.</p><p>\"Monkey's ass! You come to my Heaven Seeking Palace's territory and still dare to act so arrogantly. If I were you, I would obediently kneel down and wait for this old man you to carve your neck into a urinal.\" An extremely thin fishing line appeared under Ceng Houyi's neck and an elderly voice could be heard.</p><p>[1] Foreshadowing that he could go back to Earth???</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
