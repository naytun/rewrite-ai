Mo Wuji, Universal Contribution Points: 149, Rank: None.</p><p>Seeing this, Mo Wuji was a little speechless. The thousands and tens of thousands of Space Scorpions he just killed were actually just worth 149 points? It seemed like he could only get one point after killing many small Space Scorpions.</p><p>However, he did not mind this at all, as this was just the beginning. Once he could spew out waves of the Scholar’s Heart, a whole patch of Space Scorpions would be easily wiped out.</p><p>For the next few days, Mo Wuji was on high alert. Even though he met a few large groups of space beasts, he actively avoided them. These large groups of space beasts would not give many points, and he might even lose his life while fighting them instead.</p><p>Half a month later, Mo Wuji came to a stop. Before him there was a large whirlpool, and in it wild howling of wind could be heard. Without entering it, one could feel a sense of trepidation.</p><p>This is the Thorny Wind Gate? Mo Wuji began to worry as he looked at the gigantic whirlpool. While he had bought some introductions to the Thorny Wind Gate, but they were not very detailed, and only mentioned that the wind in it was like thorns, and there was a 90% chance of death after entering.</p><p>With Cen Shuyin’s cultivation level, what would be her chances of survival after going in the Thorny Wind Gate? It probably was like throwing a dice, relying totally on luck right?</p><p>Keeping the flying ship, Mo Wuji took out the concave shield. After some thought, he also took off the universal token at his waist. This universal token was very important, and if it got blown away by a gust, he would have to remake one. Who knew if Chu Qianlou could help him make it a second time?</p><p>When his preparations were complete, he took in a deep breath, then jumped straight into the whirlpool.</p><p>Terrifying forces tugged at him from all directions, and even though Mo Wuji’s spiritual will was not weak, the shield instantly left his spiritual will’s range, disappearing completely.</p><p>Following which strikes which felt like they were made by thony whips landed on his body, taking his clothing with them, and even his skin had lines of blood left on it.</p><p>Mo Wuji felt as though as he had been thrown into a washing machine, and did not have any power to fight back. The strong wind threw him like a rag doll, and the Thorny wind whips took away patches of his skin.</p><p>\"Whoosh!\" A large force hit him, and Mo Wuji’s rotating ceased, finally being thrown out of the terrifying whirlpool and onto the ground.</p><p>The sounds of bones cracking were clearly heard, and Mo Wuji quickly grabbed a few healing pills to consume. Dense spiritual energy game blowing over. This density of spiritual energy was even greater than the density of gusts, but it was a pity that this location was not suitable for cultivation.</p><p>However, he still rejoiced as he had went through too many instances of suffering, otherwise the hit just now would have knocked him out.</p><p>What would happen to him if he fainted in such a location?</p><p>Mo Wuji soon realised that his celebration was not unfounded. Just as he had climbed up, more wild gusts of wind came blowing over. At this moment his spiritual will couldn’t even be extended out, hence his field of vision was a mere 10 meters around him.</p><p>\"Whoosh!\" The wind hit Mo Wuji, pulling him into the air.</p><p>If this was just wind, it would still have been okay. However, this wild gusts of wind seemed like they had countless vines hidden in them, and every one of the vines had curved hooks all over them. These invisible vines whipped Mo Wuji until he was bloody all over, and then whipped him further. Every line of blood had no skin left there.</p><p>A few moments later, none of his skin was still intact.</p><p>The howling wind raged on, and Mo Wuji forcibly drew out another shield, at the same time consolidating his elemental energy. Once a safe haven appeared, he would immediately rush towards it. Otherwise, who knew where the wind would have blown him to. His flesh would soon be ripped to shreds by the whips of wind, so there might not even be any part of him left to be blown away.</p><p>Now it became clear to him why this place was called the Thorny Wind Gate. The wild winds here would beat on his body like whips covered with thorns, and this was not something anyone could handle.</p><p>The winds raged on for nearly 10 minutes before Mo Wuji finally spotted a relatively safe area. There were two gigantic rocks propped against each other, forming a location shielded from the wind.</p><p>The already prepared Mo Wuji let his elemental energy burst forth, and the shield was used to block off some of the gusts.</p><p>In that instant, he exploded forward, directly into the gap between the two large rocks. But he had no time to withdraw his shield, and another one was lost to the winds.</p><p>A bloodied Mo Wuji sat on the ground with a heavy heart as he listened to the howling winds around him. How long had he entered the Thorny Wind Gate? To be actually reduced to such a state. Cen Shuyin probably already died, because this place was really a hellhole.</p><p>After resting for a while, Mo Wuji stood up to feel those two rocks. Soon he concluded that these rocks were blown here by the winds, and did not originally exist at this location. Since the rocks could be brought here from some other place, this meant one thing. The winds that he encountered just now were not the worst, otherwise he wouldn’t have had the chance to escape to this area.</p><p>Dense spiritual energy no sparser than that below the Tian Ji Sect’s 13 spirit locking arrays. However, Mo Wuji was not in the mood to cultivate, instead he quickly scanned outwards with his spiritual will. But it was quickly broke apart without a trace left by the raging winds. All he could see was a large area of nothingness.</p><p>Since he had entered the Thorny Wind Gate, he could only see a few meters around him.</p><p>Seeing the bodies of fallen cultivators on the ground, Mo Wuji knew that other than staying there to cultivate, there was no other way out. He also had to quickly advance to True Lake Stage, otherwise, once these wild winds blew the giant rocks away, he wouldn’t be able to put up a decent fight.</p><p>The only good thing about his predicament was that the spiritual energy in the area was dense, and as long as the two rocks did not get blown away for the next couple of months, he would definitely be able to breakthrough to True Lake Stage.</p><p>Although the spiritual energy there was frighteningly dense, Mo Wuji still threw out a large pile of spirit stones. The desire to advance to True Lake Stage was strong, so naturally he could not allow the lack of cultivation resources hold him back. In his heart he knew that even after using these many spirit stones, cultivation resources could still be insufficient, as the rate of absorbing spiritual energy with the 102 meridians using the reverse circulation technique was simply too insane.</p><p>He could not even be bothered to heal the external wounds on his body, and began the reverse circulation. Gone were the days of using the Immortal Mortal Technique, as his modified cultivation technique was much superior.</p><p>In reality, this was the first time Mo Wuji had cultivated without holding back since he had modified his cultivation technique. While he had used the reverse circulation technique to cultivate as he walked in the Lost Swamp, it was not a pleasant cultivation experience, and there were many considerations on his mind then. Hence using reverse circulation on top of his modified cultivation technique, while having a fast absorption rate for spiritual energy, did not yield much progress in cultivation level. It took half a year for him to advance from Yuan Dan Stage Level 10 to the elementary Level 12. In other words, half a year of hard work only amounted to a small jump in levels.</p><p>At this moment Mo Wuji opened up all of his meridians, and did reverse circulation with all his might. Only then did he realise how frightening the reverse circulation technique was for absorbing spiritual energy.</p><p>The surrounding spiritual energy formed a whirlpool around him, which flowed in the opposite direction. Once the spiritual energy came into contact with Mo Wuji, they were swallowed up by him, without any wastage at tall.</p><p>Previously, Mo Wuji had left a pile of spirit stones at his feet, but they had all been absorbed to a pulp by him. At this point he no longer had the time to continuously take out more spirit stones, as he had already sunk deep into the terrifying spiritual energy absorption.</p><p>However, what pleasantly surprised him was that the spiritual energy here, while being the same spiritual energy as elsewhere, but after absorption, it gave him a clear direction for his cultivation.</p><p>This sort of feeling was like back when he used the Heaven grade spirit stone to cultivate. Heaven grade spirit stones had dao insights embedded within them, thus allowing cultivators to increase their cultivation speed, and obtain revelations more easily. Now, he was able to do this without using any Heaven grade spirit stones at all.</p><p>There was no doubt that this was the difference between Zhen Mo Continent and the Lost Continent. The dao in the air here was more suitable for people to go down the path of the dao. While the dao in the Lost Continent seemed to be much more broken up.</p><p>With this sort of cultivation speed, would it even take a month for him to advance to True Lake Stage? Within a mere six days, Mo Wuji had reached advanced Yuan Dan Stage Level 12, and another nine days later, the Great Circle of Yuan Dan Stage. Spirituality overflowed from his body, and the violet energy inside him formed the general shape of a violet lake.</p><p>\"Crack!\" As the 102 meridians were undergoing reverse circulation to an extreme, the 103rd meridian was blown wide open without any obstruction.</p><p>A mere one meridian had been added, but the surrounding spiritual energy seemed like it was being poured into the ocean, and Mo Wuji was gobbling it up like a whale sucking in water.</p><p>Elemental energy rumbled in Mo Wuji’s meridians non-stop, and began to grow stronger, before the basic outline of the violet lake in his body started to break down. After dissipating, the violet energy was forced straight into his Mind Palace, which slowly cracked open from within after being invaded by such strong energies. Moreover, the speed that the crack opened up at was increasing.</p><p>Upon observing this phenomenon, Mo Wuji panicked. He knew that once his Mind Palace shattered, he would be done for. It didn’t matter if he cultivated with meridians or spirit channels, the Mind Palace was an absolutely crucial existence. Now that he had no way to deal with the cracking Mind Palace, he could only suppress the feelings of fear in his heart, and continue the reverse circulation. As though as he was drinking salt water to alleviate his thirst, his cultivation level was rising wildly while he underwent such unstoppable cultivation.</p><p>\"Boom!\" A loud explosion rang out from within the depths of his Mind Palace, causing Mo Wuji to nearly think that his head was going to burst open. However, his strength did not decrease one bit, and was still increasing, with the rate of spiritual energy being absorbed getting faster.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
