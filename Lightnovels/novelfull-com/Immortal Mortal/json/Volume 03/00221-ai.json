  "body": "<p>Sang Yiping glanced around, her hesitation palpable. She remained silent, unsure of how to proceed.</p>\n<p>Granny Linglong, perceptive as ever, noticed Sang Yiping's desire to speak with Mo Wuji privately. \"My flying treasure has some issues,\" she announced. \"I need to go repair it.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji quickly retrieved the lavender plank, handing it to Granny Linglong. \"Senior, I found this floating in the sea. It has the Pill Pagoda mark.\"</p>\n<p>Granny Linglong accepted the plank with gratitude. \"Thank you. This belongs to me. Back in the Sky Sea, someone ambushed my flying treasure. With this, I can repair my ship more quickly. We can return together later.\"</p>\n<p>She stepped aside to start fixing her treasure. Pu Qian and Zhuang Yan took the opportunity to wait nearby. Mo Wuji intended to leave soon, but he wouldn’t abandon them.</p>\n<p>Once the trio departed, Sang Yiping and Nie Zhengnong suddenly knelt before Mo Wuji.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji was taken aback, stepping back. \"What’s the meaning of this? Please, get up.\"</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping remained on her knees, her voice pleading. \"Tian Ji Sect's Sang Yiping greets the sect head.\"</p>\n<p>Nie Zhengnong echoed her sentiment. \"Tian Ji Sect's Nie Zhengnong greets the sect head.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji sensed something was amiss. He knew of the Tian Ji Sect, having learned the Immortal Mortal Technique from them, and felt a deep gratitude.</p>\n<p>\"Please, stand up. There must be a mistake. I'm just a small outer disciple from the Heaven Seeking Palace, not your sect head,\" he insisted. He pondered if their kneeling had anything to do with the Immortal Mortal Technique.</p>\n<p>\"No,\" Sang Yiping insisted, her forehead touching the ground. \"Before our previous sect head passed, he designated you as our next sect head. Please accept this designation, Senior Mo.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji pulled them up, confusion etched on his face. \"Why? I haven’t even met your sect head. When discussing important matters, there’s no need for kneeling.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" Sang Yiping replied, taking a deep breath. \"A few months ago, our sect head received an invitation from Rogue Cultivator 2705…\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji's brow furrowed. \"Junior Sang, you know I am Rogue Cultivator 2705, but I never invited your sect head.\"</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping wiped a tear from her eye. \"I know, but our sect head believed it was you. He urgently sought you out and went to Yin Tomb Beach, but he never returned.\"</p>\n<p>\"Did you find out who did this?\" Mo Wuji's expression turned serious. He would not let anyone use his name to harm others.</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping gritted her teeth. \"It was the Yu Lin Lei Clan…\"</p>\n<p>The mention of the Yu Lin Lei Clan ignited a thought in Mo Wuji's mind. Could this be connected to him?</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping continued, \"To find you, the Yu Lin Lei Clan searched all of Yan City. They noticed the Tian Ji Sect's ranking on the Contribution Point Board. Our sect lacks outstanding talent, so we didn’t appear on the rankings. But when you exchanged your contribution points for something from our sect, our ranking rose rapidly. The Lei Clan discovered that rise…\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji understood the implications. The Yu Lin Lei Clan's greed was insatiable; they likely wanted to force the Tian Ji Sect to reveal what he had exchanged for those points. They might even be using the sect to track him down.</p>\n<p>\"I never expected the Yu Lin Lei Clan to be so shameless. If they wanted to find me, your sect would naturally be aware of it,\" he sighed.</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping's resolve was firm. \"Even if we did, our sect head would never reveal a word. Our teaching is: Our disciples will stand till their deaths. No Tian Ji Sect disciple kneels while alive.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji felt a surge of respect for the Tian Ji Sect. In the cultivation world, many sects betrayed their own. It took immense courage to uphold such a principle.</p>\n<p>\"After the Lei Clan killed our sect head, they secretly attacked our encampment, leading to our destruction. Perhaps only the two of us remain in the Tian Ji Sect…\"</p>\n<p>\"What?\" Mo Wuji's heart ignited with fury.</p>\n<p>If the Yu Lin Lei Clan had killed the Tian Ji Sect's head and destroyed the sect, they were truly despicable. He felt a deep urge to seek vengeance. His earlier actions had inadvertently brought the Lei Clan's wrath upon the Tian Ji Sect.</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping clenched her fists. \"Before this, the First Elder predicted the Yu Lin Lei Clan might extinguish us. To prepare, the sect dispersed our talents to train. If the sect was destroyed, we were to find you and appoint you as the next sect head, ensuring our heritage wouldn’t be lost.\"</p>\n<p>She bowed deeply, this time not kneeling.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji realized he had been chosen to inherit this role because of the Immortal Mortal Technique, not because of his identity as Rogue Cultivator 2705.</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping's eyes glistened with tears. \"Our sect head knew the Immortal Mortal Technique was extraordinary. He believed there must be a reason you exchanged so many contribution points for it. If you can truly cultivate with that technique, it’s only right for you to be our sect head. He said you are a dragon among men, hiding among mortals. Our Tian Ji Sect may not catch your eye…\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji raised his hand, stopping her. \"Junior Sang, you don’t need to flatter me. I’ve decided to accept this role. From today, the Tian Ji Sect’s heritage will not be broken. I will personally seek vengeance for its destruction.\"</p>\n<p>The connection between the Tian Ji Sect's downfall and him was clear. He was willing to be their sect head, not for glory, but to avenge them.</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping and Nie Zhengnong brightened, especially Sang Yiping. She saw Mo Wuji's talent, and his willingness to help only reinforced her belief in him.</p>\n<p>\"Sang Yiping, Nie Zhengnong greets the sect head,\" they began to kneel again. Mo Wuji raised his hands, stopping them. \"From now on, besides our closed ones and masters, Tian Ji Sect disciples will never kneel.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" they replied eagerly.</p>\n<p>In truth, a cultivator should kneel for no one but their closest and masters.</p>\n<p>\"Sect head…\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji interrupted, \"Just call me head senior brother. It feels more personal.\"</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping quickly agreed. \"Yes, senior apprentice brother. This is the sect head token of our Tian Ji Sect. The sect head's Tian Ji Sword vanished with him.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji took the token, feeling a chill seep into his hand. It appeared completely white, yet he sensed an image hidden within. Even with his spiritual will, he couldn’t discern it clearly.</p>\n<p>After securing the token, Mo Wuji turned to the sea, his voice steady. \"One day, I will reclaim the sect head's sword from the Lei Clan.\"</p>\n<p>Granny Linglong was still busy repairing her treasure, so Mo Wuji approached Pu Qian and Zhuang Yan.</p>\n<p>\"Brother Pu, Junior Zhuang, what do you plan to do next?\" Mo Wuji asked, feeling a sense of camaraderie.</p>\n<p>\"I want to find a sect and see if I can become an inner disciple,\" Zhuang Yan replied, her past with Qi Wenxuan weighing heavily on her.</p>\n<p>Pu Qian chuckled. \"Even though I didn’t get the immortal estate, I gained a friend in Brother Mo. I wonder where you’re headed next; you seem familiar with that senior.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji didn’t mention Granny Linglong’s identity. He didn’t want to complicate things for Pu Qian and Zhuang Yan.</p>\n<p>\"The Tian Ji Sect was destroyed because of me. I vow to rebuild it and seek revenge. If you’re willing, join me in the Tian Ji Sect,\" he stated plainly, feeling comfortable with them now.</p>\n<p>Pu Qian looked surprised. \"Brother Mo, to be a sect head or elder, you must be appointed. It’s not enough to just want to rebuild the Tian Ji Sect.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji revealed his sect head token. \"Brother Pu, I am already the Tian Ji Sect Head, as designated by the previous sect head. If you wish to join, I will be your head senior brother. If not, you can leave with that senior, and we’ll still be friends.\"</p>\n<p>Pu Qian clasped his fists, determination in his eyes. \"Pu Qian is willing to join the Tian Ji Sect. Greetings, head senior brother.\"</p>\n<p>Zhuang Yan followed suit. \"I will join Brother Pu in entering the Tian Ji Sect. Greetings, head senior brother!\"</p>",
