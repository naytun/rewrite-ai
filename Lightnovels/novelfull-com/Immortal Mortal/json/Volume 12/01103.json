He took a step forward and threw out ten god-restraining array discs. A huge meteorite stopped below his feet.</p><p>Mo Wuji stepped onto this meteorite, brought out a pile of array flags and several creation god spiritual veins. He was going to welcome his Unity God Tribulation.</p><p>He had been in the Great Circle of the God King Stage for a long time. Moroever, he had been cultivating in the Seed of the Universe, so his understanding towards the various Laws was very profound. At this moment, he didn't even need any external help. By simply circulating his Mortal Technique, his Lightning Calamity came.</p><p>Thick bolts of lightning came crashing down on Mo Wuji's body, causing blood scars to form. With Mo Wuji's ability to absorb lightning essense, coupled with the might of his Sage Physique, this Unity God Lightning Calamity was not powerful enough to force him to use any magic treasures.</p><p>When the third wave of lightning descended, Mo Wuji broke into the Unity God Stage.</p><p>Thereafter, the lightning bolts were no longer able to form scars on Mo Wuji's body. On the other hand, Mo Wuji's cultivation continued to rise rapidly as he started to absorb the lightning essense.</p><p>Unlike his previous Lightning Calamities, this one lasted for seven whole days.</p><p>After the seven days, the lightning clouds dispersed and space regained its calm. The meteorite under Mo Wuji's feet had already disintegrated unto dust. Not only that, the god spiritual veins that Mo Wuji brought out had all vanished without a trace.</p><p>They weren't entirely absorbed by Mo Wuji. Instead, they were broken down by the lightning.</p><p>Mo Wuji's cultivation had firmly stabilised at Unity God Level 1. His entire body brimmed with elemental energy. After retracting this energy, he seemed nothing more than a mortal.</p><p>Mo Wuji retrieved the jade box with the two fragments of the Paramita Flower and examined the fragments. He sighed and returned them to his Mortal World.</p><p>He was unable to sense the location of the other Paramita Flower from these fragments.</p><p>Now that I'm at Unity God Level 1, how will I fare against Quasi-Sages? As he thought of this, Mo Wuji brought out his Half Moon Weighted Halberd and slashed down.</p><p>A silver light appeared within space. This silver light seemed to have a physical presense and it actually slashed open a tear in space.</p><p>Before Mo Wuji could rave in delight, he felt the aura of his Half Moon Weighted Halberd change.</p><p>Mo Wuji chuckled elatedly. He did not think that his Half Moon Weighted Halberd would advance to become a high-grade god equipment at the same time as he advanced to the Unity God Stage.</p><p>He, Mo Wuji, finally had a proper weapon. At the very least, he did not need to depend on the Kun Wu Sword every time he was in danger.</p><p>Just as he returned the Half Moon Weighted Halberd, Mo Wuji's heart started to stir. His Half Moon Weighted Halberd was able to absorb killing intent and the energy from the universe to evolve. There were no battles within his Mortal World, so there couldn't be any killing intent. If he wanted his Half Moon Weighted Halberd to evolve, it would be better to place it on his back.</p><p>As he thought of this, Mo Wuji brought his Half Moon Weighted Halberd out again and placed it on his back. After which, he retrieved the crystal ball that Cang Zhengxing gave him.</p><p>Now, he could finally return. As long as he didn't encounter those Sages, he wouldn't need to fear, even if that person was Liu Xing.</p><p>Liu Xing was merely a person on the same level of Kun Yun. Mo Wuji believed that Liu Xing couldn't be much stronger than Kun Yun. At least, he shouldn't be able to return to the Quasi-Sage Stage in such a short period of time.</p><p>One must know that Kun Yun was able to preserve a perfect sea of consciousness and soul. On the other hand, Liu Xing's body had been shattered into pieces and only a single strand of his will had landed in Nirvana Ocean. How could he regain his strength so quickly?</p><p>It was that Sage Tian Hen that left some apprenhensions in Mo Wuji's heart. It probably difficult for that fella to regain cultivation as a Sage. But if that fella was able to regain his strength to the Quasi-Sage Stage, then that would be possible. Fortunately, he, Mo Wuji, had many methods. It's not about his advancement to the Unity God Stage. Instead, it was that he controlled Earth Shrinking, the Five Elemental Escape Techniques and the Wind Escape Technique.</p><p>Mo Wuji believed that in terms of escape techniques, even Sages might not compare to him. If he met Tian Hen and wasn't a match for that fella, then he would simply run away.</p><p>When Mo Wuji's spiritiaul entered that direction crystal ball, he was instantly dumbfounded. After that broken planet was destroyed, he was brought by the Seed of the Universe into the depths of space. The speed that the Seed moved was akin to the speed of light. Mo Wuji had been brought away for more than a thousand years, and thus, he was lost.</p><p>Just as Mo Wuji thought that he needed to roam around space for a period of time, his spiritual will detected a flying treasure whizzing by.</p><p>Mo Wuji did not think twice. His figure flashed and he disappeared from his original spot.</p><p>Whether it was the Five Elemental Escape Technique, the Wind Escape Technique or Earth Shrinking, they were all extremely fast.</p><p>That flying treasure was merely travelling in space. After sensing Mo Wuji, that flying treasure was like a frightened bird. It instantly increased its speed.</p><p>Mo Wuji cursed in his heart. He only wanted to ask for directions, was there a need to run?</p><p>Within this vast and boundless space, it was definitely great luck to encounter a flying treasure. Mo Wuji did not wish to let this opportunity slip. He continuously used Wind Teleportation, and in the gap in between, he used Earth Shrinking.</p><p>In just half a day, Mo Wuji was stunned. He was sure that his speed was definitely beyond godlike. He didn't think that after this flying ship increased its speed, he could only shorten the gap between them; he couldn't catch up to it in the shortest time possible.</p><p>This was extremely disadvantageous to him. It was like a human running after the car. At the very beginning, his speed would be the fastest. However, if the chase was dragged, the gap would definitely get wider.</p><p>That flying ship clearly also had the same thoughts. Even though the gap between Mo Wuji and them was getting shorter, they did not seem very worried.</p><p>Even if Mo Wuji's elemental stores were any deeper, he could not prolong this mad chase for a long time.</p><p>Unfortunately, Mo Wuji was a unique entity. Not only did he have huge stores of elemental energy, he also had the violet lake in his sea of consciousness. If that wasn't enough, he had the spirit storage channel and the elemental storage channel.</p><p>Half a month later, the flying ship started to get scared. If it was some other person chasing them, that person would definitely get slower and slower. However, they discovered a monster that got faster and faster.</p><p>Another few days passed. This flying ship knew that they couldn't avoid Mo Wuji, so they decided to stop and wait for Mo Wuji.</p><p>Originally, Mo Wuji simply wanted to ask for directions. But now that he actually spent more than half a month on this chase, he felt rather discontented.</p><p>With a single step, he landed next to the flying shuttle. He did not enter into its defensive array. Instead, he started to inscribe some void array runes.</p><p>\"This Dao Friend, we have no enmity between us. Why did you continuously chase after me?\" The one that walked out of the shuttle was a hook-nosed middle-aged man. He looked and spoke to Mo Wuji in dissatisfaction.</p><p>At this moment, his fear was growing. This was because he couldn't see through Mo Wuji's cultivation.</p><p>He is only a Level 6 God King. Mo Wuji only needed a single glance at this middle-aged man to see through his cultivation. He felt that this fella was strange. Moreover, the inside of this flying shuttle was protected with seals; his spiritual will was completely unable to penetrate in.</p><p>Mo Wuji, who originally wanted to ask for directions, harrumpted coldly. This time, he directly stepped into the boundary of this flying shuttle's defensive array. He sized this flying shuttle up as he said, \"Did you do something wrong? Why did you have to run?\"</p><p>\"Now, this is weird. We were merely travelling within space. How does what we do have anything to do with you?\" A sharp voice came from the inner compartment of the shuttle. A young man with pale-white skin walked out. If not for the extreme paleness of his skin, he could be considered good looking.</p><p>The instant this young man walked out of the inner compartment, Mo Wuji's spirit storage channel's spiritual will seeped in.</p><p>He thought that he would find some grievous scene which could not see the light of day. As it turned out, there was only a female that was being restrained within the inner compartment. This female's looks were ordinary and her cultivation seemed to be in the God Monarch Stage.</p><p>\"I simply love poking my nose into the business of others. Make way, I want to search the ship.\" Mo Wuji took a step forward and shoved this pale-skinned young man to the side.</p><p>This young man was merely in God King Level 4. In Mo Wuji's eyes, he was merely an ant.</p><p>The pale-skinned young man laughed viciously, \"If you wish to be nosey, you would need to be strong enough for that…\"</p><p>As he was speaking, he threw out multiple array flags. The hook-nosed God King also did the same.</p><p>Soon, the two were dumbfounded. They discovered that the killing array of their flying shuttle wasn't activated. It seemed to be restrained by some unknown force.</p><p>No, this was the force of the Array Dao.</p><p>Just as the hook-nosed God King thought of this, Mo Wuji said, \"You two wanted to activate this Grade 7 trap array to trap me, right? Well, to me, this array is simply too weak.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji raised his hand. The trap array released a crisp sound and it was transformed into dust.</p><p>\"Grade 8 God Array Emperor…\" The hook-nosed God King's face changed. He understood that Mo Wuji's Array Dao vastly exceeded Grade 7. He was an expert at Grade 8.</p><p>\"What unscrupulous things have you done?\" With a flick of his hand, Mo Wuji ripped open the defensive array of the inner compartment.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
