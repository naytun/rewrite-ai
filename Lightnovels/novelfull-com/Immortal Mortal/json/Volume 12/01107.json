It's because the Gods Tower, even a counterfeit one, is the only treasure that can run through the Seven Worlds. You did not hear wrongly. Luo Xu wants to use the materials from the Chasm to construct a counterfeit Gods Tower, use it to enter God World and find the true Gods Tower.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji nodded. The true Gods Tower was a supreme treasure of fortune. Even a Sage like Luo Xu would covet it.</p><p>Meng Ye could tell what Mo Wuji was thinking. He said calmly, \"You're probably thinking that Luo Xu wants the Gods Tower because it's a supreme treasure of fortune, right? That's right, it is indeed a treasure that can cause everyone's eyes to turn red. However, the more important reason is because of the upcoming World-Ending Cataclysm.\"</p><p>When he got to this point, Meng Ye specially glanced at Mo Wuji. After noticing Mo Wuji's calm expression, he asked in astonishment, \"Dao Friend Mo, could you have heard of the World-Ending Cataclysm?\"</p><p>Mo Wuji said indifferently, \"Continue speaking.\"</p><p>He could not casually reveal that he had gone to Gods Burial Cave and that he had met the Sage Nun.</p><p>Meng Ye knew that Mo Wuji did not wish to delve into this matter so he did not continue asking about it. He continued speaking, \"The Cataclysm is coming. Not only would countless cultivators perish, the universe would also suffer. The best place to fall during the Cataclysm is naturally the Gods Tower…\"</p><p>\"You're saying that the battlefield for the next Cataclysm will also be at Gods Tower?\" Mo Wuji asked in alarm.</p><p>Meng Ye inhaled and said, \"That's right. Thus, the person that controls Gods Tower will be the ruler of the Cataclysm.\"</p><p>\"Didn't Huan Ti control Gods Tower? Why did he end up like ordinary Throned Gods?\" Mo Wuji asked.</p><p>Meng Ye said with disdain, \"That pig-headed Huan Ti actually deserves to own Gods Tower? Not only was he plotted against by several people, he allowed his Gods Tower to be the battlefield. With such intelligence, he was no better than that red lotus.\"</p><p>\"What do you mean?\" Mo Wuji immediately asked.</p><p>\"You should know that the number of Sages is limited, right?\" Meng Ye asked.</p><p>Mo Wuji nodded, \"I've heard of it. Why is that so?\"</p><p>Meng Ye said, \"The reason why Huan Ti could become a Sage is because he had some dogsh*t luck and managed to obtain the Gods Tower. With this supreme treasure of fortune, he validated his Sage Dao and stepped into the Sage Stage. Even I don't know what is his Dao.\"</p><p>Contempt could be heard in Meng Ye's voice.</p><p>\"I wonder whether how Dao Friend Meng is able to validate his Sage Dao?\" Meng Ye's clone was already so powerful. Mo Wuji really wanted to know what was Meng Ye's Dao. In the future, they might actually be opponents.</p><p>The moment Mo Wuji asked that question, Meng Ye knew what he was thinking. He snickered, \"Dao Friend Mo, we don't have any conflicts. We should be friends. Your friend knows of Gods Tower. Now that Huan Ti has emerged, even though he has a pig brain, my chances of obtaining Gods Tower has plunged infinitesimally close to zero. Without the potential conflict of the Gods Tower, we should be friends.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji said indifferently, \"What can you help me with?\"</p><p>\"I can help you find Huan Ti.\" Meng Ye immediately said.</p><p>Mo Wuji laughed coldly, \"I have also been to Gods Tower before. Since Huan Ti could sense that Senior Sister Ji Li had been to Gods Tower before, he would definitely be able to do the same for me. I don't need to find him; he would be the one looking for me. Why would I need your help to find Huan Ti?\"</p><p>These words were lies. It was true that he had been to Gods Tower but even Huan Ti would not have been able to sense that.</p><p>Firstly, his time in Gods Tower was very short. Secondly, his Dao is the Mortal Dao. After stepping into the God King Stage, any intent and will that clashed against his Dao would be corroded. Even if traces of his visit to Gods Tower were really left on him, they would have been erased by now.</p><p>Meng Ye gritted his teeth and said, \"I can tell you about the stories of the 8 Sages. Before the World-Ending Cataclysm comes, it would definitely be useful to you.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji said calmly, \"I am brothers with Kun Yun. That Jie Heng wants to be my little brother but I'm too lazy to accept him. You think that I need you to tell me about the stories of the 8 Sages?\"</p><p>Mo Wuji really didn't know anything about the 8 Sages. He even wanted to ask who the red lotus was. However, he definitely wouldn't say such things to Meng Ye.</p><p>\"No wonder…\" Meng Ye muttered to himself. After a while, he sighed and said, \"I was just thinking why you weren't shocked regarding God Thrones. So it turns out that you know two of the 108 Principal Gods. From the looks of it, you should know why Huan Ti went to Tao Tie Valley?\"</p><p>\"Of course I do. He wanted the Tao Tie Pot. However, he probably wasted his trip. The Tao Tie Pot had been taken away by Kun Yun.\"</p><p>Hearing Mo Wuji's words, Meng Ye knew that Mo Wuji wasn't lying to him. Mo Wuji was truly in the know.</p><p>\"If that Huan Ti is really heavily injured or if he has yet to recover his cultivation, I can help you to eliminate him. The premise is that you would also need to get Kun Yun and Jie Heng to help.\" Meng Ye gritted his teeth and said.</p><p>Previously, he coveted the Gods Tower because he thought that Huan Ti had perished. Now that he knew that Huan Ti was still alive, he was afraid. Don't simply look at how he viewed Huan Ti as a pig-headed fool. He, Meng Ye, truly didn't have the balls to face Huan Ti head-on.</p><p>Mo Wuji chuckled, \"Dao Friend Meng, with this premise of yours, you still want my Phecda Clay?\"</p><p>\"You can mention anything you want. As long as I am able to obtain it, I will.\" Meng Ye said through gritted teeth.</p><p>It was truly because this piece of Phecda Clay might be the only piece left in the entire universe. If he missed out on this opportunity, then he might never find another one. There were many treasures which could construct a new dao body. However, the only one that could allow him to reach the Quasi-Sage Stage, or even the Sage Stage, was the Phecda Clay.</p><p>Don't simply look at how eager Ku Xinren was to obtain the Extreme Ice Heavenly Bamboo. In terms of constructing a new dao body, the Extreme Ice Heavenly Bamboo was definitely not comparable to the Phecda Clay. However, the Heavenly Bamboo did have some advantages over the Phecda Clay. It could heal one's soul, cleanse one's spiritual roots and sort one's disarrayed Dao Laws. All these were things that the Phecda Clay couldn't do.</p><p>Mo Wuji shook his head, \"Dao Friend Meng, I have plenty of treasures. I don't need any of yours. Since that's the case, I will bid my farewells now.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji truly didn't want to work together with meng Ye. He could tell that Meng Ye was cunning and scheming. Moreover, he required Huan Ti to be injured before he would help. Mo Wuji was too lazy to work with such cowardly people. This was different from Kun Yun. Although Kun Yun was also cunning, he had bigger balls than Meng Ye.</p><p>Seeing that Mo Wuji didn't want to trade with him, Meng Ye hurriedly said, \"Dao Friend Mo, even if you kill Huan Ti, you can't save your senior sister. You are lacking a certain treasure.\"</p><p>\"What treasure?\" Mo Wuji subconsciously asked.</p><p>\"Your senior sister's sea of consciousness had been destroyed by Huan Ti. Only the Extreme Ice Heavenly Bamboo can save her. I happen to know where we can find an Extreme Ice Heavenly Bamboo…\"</p><p>Mo Wuji came to a sudden realisation. Even if Ji Li was alive, her sea of consciousness and spiritual roots would definitely be damaged. Meng Ye's words were right; the Extreme Ice Heavenly Bamboo was truly the best treasure to help her.</p><p>He originally had one Extreme Ice Heavenly Bamboo. Unfortunately, he had traded it with Ku Xinren.</p><p>There's no medicine for regrets. Mo Wuji knew that it was too late for him to find Ku Xinren. By now, Ku Xinren would have already used the Heavenly Bamboo. Perhaps Ku Xinren might even be waiting for him so that he could snatch the Time Plate back.</p><p>\"You know where I can find the Extreme Ice Heavenly Bamboo?\" When Mo Wuji recalled that he no longer had the Extreme Ice Heavenly Bamboo, he hurriedly asked.</p><p>Meng Ye could sense Mo Wuji's interest. He said resolutely, \"That's right, I do.\"</p><p>\"I've heard of a place where the Extreme Ice Heavenly Bamboo and primordial energy appeared. There's also another treasure called…\" Mo Wuji intentionally slowed down.</p><p>When Kun Yun heard of the Heavenly Bamboo and the primordial energy, he wanted Mo Wuji to bring him to the broken planet. Until now, Mo Wuji still didn't know what treasure Kun Yun was talking about. He didn't believe that the treasure was the Seed of the Universe.</p><p>If Kun Yun was referring to the Seed of the Universe, would he have remained so calm?</p><p>With a treasure like the Seed of the Universe, it wasn't impossible for an ordinary cultivator to step into the Sage Stage.</p><p>\"You're talking about the Ice Origin Bead, right? Everyone knows about this. The Extreme Ice Heavenly Bamboo and the Ice Origin Bead are associated, and the Heavenly Bamboo requires primordial energy to grow.\" Meng Ye said straightforwardly.</p><p>Mo Wuji finally knew that Kun Yun wasn't talking about the Seed of the Universe but the Ice Origin Bead.</p><p>The Ice Origin Bead was definitely a peak treasure but it was far from being able to compare to the Seed of the Universe.</p><p>\"Dao Friend Meng, I agree to work with you. As long as you bring me to find the Extreme Ice Heavenly Bamboo and help me eliminate Huan Ti, I will give you some Phecda Clay.\" Mo Wuji finally gave Meng Ye some hope.</p><p>By now, Meng Ye's teeth were aching. He knew that Mo Wuji wasn't an easy man. He could only say, \"Since that's the case, I will first tell you about the 8 Sages. This will give you some understanding towards Huan Ti. Otherwise, even if Huan Ti's cultivation had declined greatly, we might not be able to eliminate him.\"</p><p>Seeing that Mo Wuji wanted to say something, Meng Ye lifted his hand and stopped him, \"I know what you want to say. I can only tell you that we cannot assume that we are able to kill Huan Ti just because that Tao Tie did. In the future, you will realise what kind of existence the Tao Tie is. It's an expert that's definitely not much weaker than a Sage.\"</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
