Here, a manual which was not being exchanged would have a thin string attached to it, preventing it from being taken away. Even a quick browse would only allow the first few pages to be seen. The later pages have all been sealed.</p><p>So with this process of walking and stopping, Mo Wuji encountered quite a number of cultivation manuals with \"Immortal\" in the name. However, Mo Wuji could only smile ruefully when he noticed that this \"Immortal\" manuals were largely Human Grade manuals. They weren't like the Immortal Mortal Technique which had a eye-catching name.</p><p>At the start, Mo Wuji wasn't really anxious. With all the Five Great Empire sects’ manuals concentrated here, coupled with the fact that the Immortal Mortal Technique was so common, it should be easy to find the sequel to the Immortal Mortal Technique.</p><p>But half a day had passed and Mo Wuji could not help but get anxious. He did see a few Immortal Mortal Techniques, but these were basically offered by Xuan sects. These were the most ordinary of techniques, it was the same one as he was cultivating. However, what he needed was the sequel to the Immortal Mortal Technique, and not the same Human Grade one which he had been using.</p><p>Another hour passed but Mo Wuji's efforts continued to end up to no avail.</p><p>Signing inwardly, Mo Wuji decided to increase his speed. If he really wasn't about to find what he wanted, then he would change to a different technique. There were no shortages of Earth Grade manuals here. Previously, he even found a Treasured Earth Grade manual for 9,000 contribution points. Even if he chose to ignore all these, he still had an Earth Grade cultivation manual on him. That manual was his spoils of war; he obtained it from that alien cultivator's storage ring.</p><p>Tian Ji Sect? Mo Wuji stopped in his tracks. It wasn't because he found the technique he wanted but because this sect sounded very familiar.</p><p>His magic treasure was called Tian Ji Pole, and now there's this Tian Ji Sect. The Tian Ji Sect had a total of 12 manuals, but unfortunately, it was only a Xuan sect.</p><p>In the Five Great Empires, a Xuan sect could be considered one of the lowest existences. Even an average state might be more powerful than a Xuan sect.</p><p>Mo Wuji casually swept the Tian Ji Sect's manuals with his spiritual will, and he immediately found one of the cultivation technique: Immortal Mortal Technique.</p><p>Mo Wuji laughed, only a Xuan sect would offer this Immortal Mortal Technique.</p><p>Mo Wuji was about to continue scanning further with his spiritual will when he saw the contribution points required. He was momentarily shocked still. The Immortal Mortal Technique required 10,008 points to exchange for it.</p><p>Are my eyes playing tricks on me? Mo Wuji rubbed his eyes and took another careful look. That's right, it really required 10,080 contribution points; he did not make a mistake.</p><p>Previously, Mo Wuji had seen many books of the Immortal Mortal Technique. The best one was from the Calm Spirit Clan which needed 5 contribution points. Many others only needed as low as 1 contribution point. And this Tian Ji Sect's Immortal Mortal Technique needed an absurd 10,080 contribution points. Even if it contained the sequel to the Immortal Mortal Technique, it shouldn't have such a price right?</p><p>Mo Wuji took a look at the Tian Ji Sect's other techniques; they were all very normally priced. With the exception of this, the highest priced one required 121 points.</p><p>According to the standards, they shouldn't have made a mistake with the pricing. The only possibility was that the Tian Ji Sect wasn't willing to offer this technique. But if they were unwilling, then they could just not take it out, why would then send it here? Mo Wuji was truly unable to resist the urge to pull this 10,080 point Immortal Mortal Technique out, immediately flipping to the first page:</p><p>\"Heaven and Earth first opened then there came elemental energy. This is an absurd claim. Spiritual energy and the Heaven and Earth were conceived at the same time, mutually supporting one another. People who had yet to step into the Dao were mortals. I was a mortal, who condensed elemental energy, achieving longevity…\"</p><p>The opening of the Immortal Mortal Technique was exactly the same as the one he purchased from Luo Hai Merchant House. The following cultivation methods were also roughly the same. There were only a few minor details which were clearer and better explained than the one from the Luo Hai Merchant House.</p><p>After flipping to the tenth page, Mo Wuji was unable to carry on. The content at the back had been sealed, which was as expected. Here, all the cultivation manuals did not allow you to read till the end.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Mo Wuji was pleasantly surprised. Because according to the thickness of the book, the ten pages he had read through was roughly 10% of the entire manual.</p><p>And in the 10%, 90% of the one he bought from Luo Hai Merchant House could be found. If the following pages contained more Immortal Mortal Technique content, then this manual was truly better. As long as this Tian Ji Sect was not intentionally scamming others, this manual might very likely contain what he wanted. Even though the name of the book was the same, it's thickness was much more. Unless the pages at the back were all blank?</p><p>Mo Wuji was soon sure that the Tian Ji Sect wouldn't intentionally seal a bunch of white pages. After all, the Tian Ji Sect was still a Xuan sect; it shouldn't do such lowly things.</p><p>This book it is then.</p><p>Mo Wuji took out his contribution point jade token, and swiped it at the space below the Immortal Mortal Technique. With a \"Beep\" sound, an additional line of red words appeared behind his 12,076 points: Already used 10,080 points. At the same time, the thin string holding the Immortal Mortal Technique suddenly disappeared.</p><p>Spending more than ten thousand contribution points at one go, he would be lying if he said that his heart didn't ache. But even if his heart ache, he wouldn't hesitate to exchange for it again. Without a cultivation technique, how was he supposed to advance? He did not immediately open his Immortal Mortal Technique here, he had this feeling that the old man at the entrance had been following him with his spiritual will.</p><p>A little more than 2,000 points left. Mo Wuji actually intended to search for a skill, but because he spent too much time searching for a cultivation manual, he decided to temporarily give up on that. He was worried that the Lei Clan might have already sent men to Yan City.</p><p>Lian Hezhou might be able to help Mo Wuji account to the Tian Shang Empire, but he wouldn't be able to stop the Lei Clan from searching for Mo Wuji.</p><p>…</p><p>Two days later. Mo Wuji was already tens of thousands of miles away from Yan City, but he did not intend to stop just yet. He controlled the flying car to continue moving towards the direction of the Heaven Seeking Palace.</p><p>He wanted to undergo closed doors cultivation and the Heaven Seeking Palace spiritual energy tempering room was the most suitable. Now, he had contribution points on him, so he could use the spiritual energy tempering room for as long as he liked. In the spiritual energy tempering room, even Jin Yu wouldn't be able to do anything against him.</p><p>As for the alien battlefield, his cultivation was currently too low.</p><p>…</p><p>Yan City Tian Ji Sect encampment.</p><p>An old man was urgently staring at the door, by his side was a middle-aged man. After an incense's time, a young woman walked in and bowed towards the old man and said, \"Master, the investigation is complete. The one who spent more than ten thousand contribution points to exchange for our sect’s Immortal Mortal Technique was Rogue Cultivator 2705.\"</p><p>\"The same Rogue Cultivator 2705 on the Hundred Sect Alliance's rankings?\" The old man seemed to also have known about Rogue Cultivator 2705’s fame.</p><p>The woman nodded, \"It's him. A few days back, he appeared in the Yan City Immortal Jade Tower. Thereafter, the Lei Clan's Lei Chenghe barged into the Immortal Jade Tower after the Heaven Seeking Palace's Hou Yucheng. Thereafter, Rogue Cultivator 2705 saved Hou Yucheng and incited the crowd to kill Lei Chenghe. Afterwards, he visited the contribution points exchange office and exchanged for our sect's Immortal Mortal Technique.\"</p><p>\"Any updates on where he is now?\" The old man asked urgently.</p><p>The woman shook her head, \"No. I heard that the Lei Clan had sent people to Yan City and are also searching for Rogue Cultivator 2705’s whereabouts. They even requested the Hundred Sect Alliance to hand over Rogue Cultivator 2705, claiming that Rogue Cultivator 2705 had casually killed a big sect's disciple, infringing the Tian Shang Empire laws. However, the Hundred Sect Alliance and the Tian Shang Emperor did not do anything to Rogue Cultivator 2705.\"</p><p>The middle-aged man beside the old man sighed and said, \"I never expected for there to be someone who would spend more than 10,000 contribution points to exchange for the Immortal Mortal Technique. If he finds out that it is completely empty, I wonder if he would get angry at our Tian Ji Sect.\"</p><p>The old man shook his head, \"Our Tian Ji Sect's Immortal Mortal Technique isn't completely empty. Only the destined one could unlock its contents. If our Tian Ji Sect could unlock the content at the back, it wouldn't have fallen to such an extent. Now, we've even become a Xuan sect. The greatness of the Immortal Mortal Technique, you will never understand…\"</p><p>After a brief pause, the old man continued, \"Qiuji, Ping’Er, you two continue to gather information on that Rogue Cultivator 2705. Thereafter, invite him to our Tian Ji Sect. If he's truly able to open the things at the back of the Immortal Mortal Technique, then we must invite him to become our Tian Ji Sect's sect head.\"</p><p>\"Ah…\" That final sentence left Ping’Er and that middle-aged man with their mouths agape in shock, they were in a state of disbelief.</p><p>Even though the Tian Ji Sect was only a Xuan sect, not only could be its sect head. To let a rogue cultivator be its sect head? Even if this rogue cultivator was on the Hundred Sect Alliance's contribution point rankings, he didn't qualify ah</p><p>…</p><p>Even though the Tian Ji Sect and the Yu Lin Lei Clan were in Yan City searching for Rogue Cultivator 2705, it no longer had anything to do with Mo Wuji. If not for his constant rush, Mo Wuji would have long taken out the Immortal Mortal Technique to study it closely. Because he was controlling the flying car, Mo Wuji could only take a look at Mo Xue’s . He was afraid he might be overly engrossed in the Immortal Mortal Technique and forget to control the flying car.</p><p>One month later, Mo Wuji had returned the Heaven Seeking Palace.</p><p>Compared to the time he left with Cen Shuyin, the Heaven Seeking Palace was even more dull. There were only a few disciples walking by and a majority of the disciples had gone to the alien cultivators battlefield.</p><p>When Mo Wuji returned to the sect, he immediately sprinted towards the Immortal Training Tower. Closed doors cultivation, this was what he wanted to do the most. He was in Transcending Mortality Stage Level 1, he could be considered an expert among the younger generation of Heaven Seeking Palace's disciples. But to Mo Wuji, this level was far from enough. He found that as his cultivation got higher, he felt increasingly insufficient.</p><p>\"I want the highest grade spiritual energy tempering room for a year,\" Mo Wuji went to the payment officer at the Immortal Training Tower and said aloud.</p><p>The middle-aged woman at the payment office seemed to always have the same straight face, \"Cultivating for more than three months does not accept spirit stones, you can only pay contribution points. You need to pay 1,000 contribution points.\"</p><p>With that, the woman took out a card swiping machine.</p><p>Mo Wuji did not have the mood to banter with this woman. He directly took our his Hundred Sect Alliance's jade token and swiped it. Cen Shuyin had told him before, the Hundred Sect Alliance's contribution points could be used outside the Hundred Sect Alliance, even back at their own sect.</p><p>Indeed, the middle-aged woman didn't find anything amiss, directly swiping the machine and throwing the jade token back at Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji grabbed his jade token and rushed to the Immortal Training Tower's best spiritual energy tempering room. He was about to start his closed doors cultivation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
