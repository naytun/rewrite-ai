However, this woman wasn’t the one who took the Number 731’s storage ring because his spiritual will imprint was actually not on her body.</p><p>\"What are you doing here?\" The woman glared at Mo Wuji as she said with a trace of coldness.</p><p>\"None of your business,\" Mo Wuji wasn’t friendly to her because if it was not for his sensitivity for danger and the use of his escape talisman earlier on, he could have died.</p><p>The woman heard Mo Wuji’s words and didn’t bother talking it out with him as she drew out her Seven Dazzling Mirrors.</p><p>The Seven Dazzling Mirrors were extremely majestic and its wavering lights were like a voided space, enveloping Mo Wuji.</p><p>The majestic space started to chain and extrude Mo Wuji as he grunted before his Tian Ji Pole turned into a cluster of pole shadows as it struck against the brilliance of the Seven Dazzling Mirrors.</p><p>\"Kacha!\" The brilliance was like an essence as it was broken into a million pieces when Mo Wuji’s Tian Ji Pole struck against it. Mo Wuji took a simple step and was already outside of this magnificent space. Mo Wuji was pretty knowledgeable in the law of space so he could tell that the stability of this space was almost zero and it was meant to deal with newbie who knew nothing about space.</p><p>Without waiting for her to react, Mo Wuji’s Tian Ji Pole had already pierced through space towards her.</p><p>\"Boom!\" This time round, the Seven Dazzling Mirrors had turned into a round shield as it clashed with Mo Wuji’s Tian Ji Pole. The explosion of elemental energy turned everything around them into ashes as the place they were battling at had quickly turned into a void.</p><p>\"Bang!\" Tian Ji Pole’s strong retaliation energy forced this young woman to fly backwards for over tens of metres.</p><p>Against a woman who wanted to kill him, Mo Wuji held no tender, protective feelings for the fairer sex as he released a lightning web concurrently with a strike of the Tian Ji Pole.</p><p>\"Boom boom boom!\" The lightning web trapped this woman as the Seven Dazzling Mirrors actually turned into an endless amount of brilliance as it tried to break the lightning web. However, the lightning web was simply too powerful as it burnt the woman’s clothes black.</p><p>Mo Wuji saw through the space and walked out of the space formed by this woman’s Seven Dazzling Mirrors. This woman’s understanding of space was simply not comparable to Mo Wuji’s understanding. No matter how much force she used, she would never be as capable as Mo Wuji to break the lightning web and escape.</p><p>At this same moment, Mo Wuji’s Tian Ji Pole landed. Mo Wuji wanted to tell this woman that she was simply too ambitious to try and take him down while only being at Worldly Immortal Stage Level 3.</p><p>\"Stop, if you kill me, you will never be able to free yourself from the clutches of the Broken Sect. They will follow you like tarsal bone worms until they managed to get rid of you…\" The woman hurried to shout as she realised that her little life was under complete control by Mo Wuji.</p><p>She was different from the rest because even though there were little spirituality ripples around Mo Wuji and he looked like a mortal, she could clearly sense Mo Wuji’s cultivation level and knew that he should not be in the Worldly Immortal Stage yet.</p><p>Worldly Immortal Stage experts meant experts with their primordial spirit solidified and was even able to leave their body while their elemental energy remained solidified too. Because she was extremely sensitive to the primordial spirit, she could sense Mo Wuji’s true cultivation level. In her eyes, she thought that she could finish off an expert who was not even in the Worldly Immortal Stage.</p><p>Who would have thought that Mo Wuji was so strong that he could restrain her in less than five moves?</p><p>\"Kacha!\" Mo Wuji’s Tian Ji Pole had no intentions to stop as it landed on the woman’s knees and instantly broke both of her knees. After Mo Wuji’s Tian Ji Pole landed on her knees, she immediately fell to the ground, crippled. Under the careful watch of Mo Wuji, it would simply be impossible for her to escape.</p><p>Mo Wuji grabbed her Seven Dazzling Mirrors as he was extremely impressed by this mirror and was not intending to leave it with this woman. The reasons why he chose not to kill her was because he wanted to inquire more about the Broken Sect and to find out who on earth the Poison Fairy was.</p><p>After hearing that he was a Rebirther, the Poison Fairy pleaded for her life but the poison in her was simply too powerful for Mo Wuji to save her. The Poison Fairy even told him where to find the Broken Sect’s spiritual will imprint on himself and because she was very concerned about Mo Wuji and the story of his rebirth, Mo Wuji wanted to ask about her.</p><p>\"Even though I would violate the sect’s rules, I promise to not tell the Broken Sect about you attacking me as long as you let me go. Let this be our personal treaty?\" The woman didn’t seem too bothered by her broken knees as she tried to strike a deal with Mo Wuji calmly.</p><p>Mo Wuji said faintly, \"Is the Broken Sect so formidable? Am I not living well even after killing that Number 731 and watching the Poison Fairy die in front of me?\"</p><p>\"You killed Wan’Er…\" This woman’s expression changed drastically when she heard that the Poison Fairy died in front of him. The woman didn’t react when her knees were broken by Mo Wuji but now that he mentioned about the Poison Fairy’s death, her voice was shivering.</p><p>\"You, you...and the Broken Sect are simply irreconcilable. You are definitely bound to die with an incomplete body in the hands of the Broken Sect,\" This woman’s words suddenly became harsh and vicious.</p><p>Mo Wuji replied coldly, \"The Broken Sect and I had already been irreconcilable for the longest time ever even without your reminder. When the Poison Fairy told me to not find trouble with the Broken Sect if I had a second life, I told her to warn the Broken Sect to not find trouble with me, Mo Wuji, if they had a second life.</p><p>The reason why I didn’t kill you yet was not because you are a member of the Broken Sect. The Broken Sect would be exterminated soon so stop using the Broken Sect to threaten me. I only wanted to ask about the Poison Fairy whom you called Wan’Er. I do hope you can tell me more about the Poison Fairy and her past but of course, I wouldn’t force you if you are not willing to tell me. Therefore, all you have to answer now is whether you are willing to speak or not.\"</p><p>The woman finally calmed herself down as she looked at Mo Wuji seriously and said, \"So you are Mo Wuji? I have long heard about your reputable name. Before I answer you, you have to tell me one thing. Did you kill Wan’Er?\"</p><p>Mo Wuji replied in a calm tone, \"If Wan’Er is the Poison Fairy, I didn’t kill her. Back then when I was in space, she asked me to give her a lift and I agreed. However, she poisoned me the moment she boarded my flying ship. The pity was that her poison didn’t work on me and after she realised that she failed to poison me, she killed herself. Therefore, her death was her own doing even though I didn’t wish to kill her in the end.</p><p>\"Tell me, why would Wan’Er tell you how to find the Broken Sect’s spiritual will imprint?\" The woman heard Mo Wuji and the sorrow in her eyes started to dissipate.</p><p>\"You are actually quite smart to know that Wan’Er told me where to find the spiritual will imprint on my body?\" Mo Wuji said in surprise.</p><p>The woman said in a deep voice, \"The Broken Sect’s spiritual will imprint makes use of the spiritual energy in the air and enters your spirit channel the moment you cultivate and use your spiritual circulation technique. No matter what technique you use, such a spiritual will imprint would not disappear and you would not realise it. Since you don’t have any spiritual will imprint on you now, it would mean that Wan’Er told you how to get rid of it. Otherwise, even if you knew you had a will imprint on you, you would definitely not be able to get rid of it.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji nodded his head, \"You are right for half of your claims because it was indeed Wan’Er who told me where the spiritual will imprint was on my body. However, before she told me how to get rid of it, she was poisoned to death and I was the one who thought of the way to remove the spiritual will imprint.\"</p><p>\"Unbelievable,\" This woman said in a stern tone while she sent out an silent spiritual will imprint as she spoke.</p><p>Mo Wuji was extremely sensitive to changes in space so he immediately realised it when this woman was placing spiritual will imprints on him. He allowed this woman to place her spiritual will imprint and the moment she was done with it, he would continue to circulate all 106 meridians simultaneously and sent in a trace of the Scholar’s Heart into his meridians.</p><p>In a few seconds, the spiritual will imprint on him disappeared without a trace.</p><p>This woman was dumbfounded because how could she not tell that Mo Wuji immediately removed her spiritual will imprint only shortly after she placed it on him? Even the Broken Sect was not capable of doing so.</p><p>\"You are indeed not lying,\" The woman let out a long sigh as she stared at Mo Wuji and said slowly, \"Can you tell me why Wan’Er told you where the spiritual will imprint was?\"</p><p>Mo Wuji nodded his head as he didn’t intent to let this woman go. He simply couldn’t care how much she knew but cared about how much she would tell him instead.</p><p>\"This was because before she died, I told her that I was a Rebirther...\"</p><p>Before Mo Wuji could finish, the woman intejected and said shockingly \"You told her you were a Rebirther... No wonder Wan’Er would tell you…\"</p><p>Mo Wuji didn’t continue explaining since this woman already understood what he was saying, \"Speaking of which, I still owe her a little favour. Back then, if she could survive, I really wouldn’t have killed her but it was a pity that she was too vicious when poisoning herself.\"</p><p>\"Wan’Er is my younger sister, my biological younger sister. My name is Nong Shuyi and her name is Nong Shuwan…\" The woman stopped here as she looked at Mo Wuji and said, \"Do you really want to exterminate the Broken Sect?\"</p><p>\"That’s right, the members of the Broken Sect were chasing after my wife in the Thorny Wind Gate and were trying to kill me afterwards. I told your younger sister before that if the Broken Sect were to have a second chance in life, they better not provoke me,\" Mo Wuji said calmly.</p><p>He believed what this woman said and that she was the Poison Fairy’s sister. However, he was still hesitating whether he should kill her or not. The Poison Fairy did save his life just before her death and this woman was the Poison Fairy’s older sister.</p><p>\"Don’t find the Broken Sect because I am not helping the Broken Sect. The moment you try to seek your revenge on the Broken Sect, you would definitely die.\"</p><p>\"That is my own problem and you only need to tell me why your sister gave up killing me and pleaded for her life after she knows I am a Rebirther?\" Mo Wuji stared at Nong Shuyi as he asked.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
