But I heard that after Li Xiuran disappeared from the Earth Board, a Rogue Cultivator 2705 occupied the Rank 1 spot. However, that Rogue Cultivator 2705 only stayed up there for two hours before it was changed to Wang Er. We all know what happened afterwards.\"</p><p>Everyone gave each other glances; what Yan Huimeng was saying was that Rogue Cultivator 2705 had killed Li Xiuran and occupied the Earth Board Rank 1, and Rogue Cultivator 2705 then advanced into the True God Stage, leaving the Earth Board. With Rank 1 leaving the Earth Board, Rank 2 Wang Er naturally became Rank 1.</p><p>But things were really too coincidental. Just as Rogue Cultivator 2705 left the Earth Board, Lei Hongji had challenged Rank 2 Wang Er, not knowing that Wang Er had already become Rank 1. Thus, after Lei Hongji killed Wang Er, he became Rank 1 of the Earth Board.</p><p>That means, within that short period of time, Earth Board's Rank 1 position had shuffled through four people. Wait that's not right, if Lei Hongji was soon going through his tribulation, then the Earth Board's Rank 1 would consecutively go through five people in this short time.</p><p>As for that Rogue Cultivator 2705, almost everyone knew about him. He was an existence that once occupied Mortal Board's Rank 1, he originated from the Lost Continent.</p><p>But very few of them knew that Rogue Cultivator 2705 wasn't only Rank 1 on the Mortal Board but also the Mortal King Board. Being Rank 1 on the Mortal King Board signified much greater things than the Mortal Board.</p><p>\"Haha…\" Grandmaster Wu Xiang laughed hysterically. \"A mere rogue cultivator… He actually dares to kill this old monk's disciple. He's courting death.\"</p><p>Everyone was silently pitying Rogue Cultivator 2705. Even if he was any stronger, he was merely in the True God Stage. Now that he had been targeted by Grandmaster Wu Xiang, his days were numbered.</p><p>\"Hall Master Wu Xiang.\" Chi Tong suddenly opened his mouth and uttered.</p><p>Wu Xiang turned his head and clasped his fists. Previously, he acted disrespectfully towards the Star Lord, that was his mistake. Even if his heart was filled with hate, he should not have ignored the Star Lord’s position.</p><p>Chi Tong nodded and said, \"Rogue Cultivator 2705 is a genius that has never been seen before in the past hundred years in Zhen Mo Continent. His talent is even higher than Lei Hongji. Thus, I hope that Grandmaster Wu Xiang can cherish this talent, and let go of him this one time.\"</p><p>Grandmaster Wu Xiang’s eyes were instantly filled with coldness, \"Star Lord, just now I was wrong and I have already apologized for that. Now, I would like to ask the Star Lord, if Rogue Cultivator 2705 had killed Lei Hongji instead, would you have let him go?\"</p><p>Chi Tong sighed, he knew that even if Rogue Cultivator 2705 killed Lei Hongji, he wouldn’t bear to kill 2705. A majority of the people here were merely vying for their own benefits. How many of them actually knew that their planet was in a precarious position, and could at any time become some other person’s backyard?</p><p>However, he knew that even if he said that he would let go of Rogue Cultivator 2705, Grandmaster Wu Xiang wouldn’t believe him.</p><p>As expected, Grandmaster Wu Xiang did not wait for Chi Tong to reply, taking the initiative to say, \"As the adege goes: It’s easy to say, but hard to do. Wait till Lei Hongji gets killed, I believe that the Star Lord would understand how I feel.\"</p><p>Chi Tong’s face turned ugly. A Worldly Immortal tried to speak up for him, but Xia Dandao stood up instead.</p><p>Xia Dandao was the number one hall’s - Star Wars Hall - hall master. Even though the Star Wars Army merely ranked as fifth among the ten armies, no one dared to underestimate the Xia Clan. Thus, since Xia Dandao wanted to talk, no one would interfere with him.</p><p>\"Star Lord, various hall masters and sect heads. I stand here now to say some words of fairness. Rogue Cultivator 2705 killed Li Xiuran in a life and death battle, so it’s not actually a mistake. At the same time, I believe that the Star Lord’s words are very logical, so I would also like to advise Grandmaster Wu Xiang to not kill Rogue Cultivator 2705. Supreme level geniuses are becoming increasingly rare in our planet. To just kill him like that, it would truly be a catastrophe to this planet.\"</p><p>Xia Dandao incited doubts within many people. Even if Xia Dandao wanted to support Chi Tong, he wouldn’t do it by offending Grandmaster Wu Xiang. Moreover, some of them had heard that Xia Dandao’s son, Xia Mu, wanted to steal Rogue Cultivator 2705’s dao companion. As a result of that, one of Xia Clan’s Great Circle True God perished in the Lost Continent. It was even said that one of Xia Clan’s Worldly Immortals went missing in the Lost Continent.</p><p>The expression in Grandmaster Wu Xiang’s eyes did not change. To him, Xia Dandao’s words were like fart. He would still do what he wanted to do.</p><p>Xia Dandao acted as though nothing happened as he continued, \"There’s no need to talk about Lei Hongji and Rogue Cultivator 2705’s talent, but Li Xiuran was indeed a supreme level genius. Now that he is killed, it’s no wonder that Grandmaster Wu Xiang would feel upset. If it was me, I would be filled with grievances too. How about this, if Grandmaster Wu Xiang finds Rogue Cultivator 2705, you can be more lenient and accept Rogue Cultivator 2705 as your disciple. This would reimburse your pain and your loss. I would also like to advise everyone sitting here to immediately release the order to search for Rogue Cultivator 2705. This will aid Grandmaster Wu Xiang in finding another exceptional disciple as soon as possible.\"</p><p>Hearing these words of Xia Dandao, most of them finally understood that this fella was not up to anything good. He seemed as though he was trying to appease Grandmaster Wu Xiang and Chi Tong, but what he really wanted was to put Rogue Cultivator 2705 on a wanted list.</p><p>Publicly saying \"There’s no need to talk about Lei Hongji and Rogue Cultivator 2705’s talent, but Li Xiuran was indeed a supreme level genius\", wasn’t he implying that Li Xiuran wasn’t even comparable to Lei Hongji? And he even asked Grandmaster Wu Xiang to find and accept Rogue Cultivator 2705 as a disciple? Keke, Grandmaster Wu Xiang was more likely to extract Rogue Cultivator 2705’s soul and torture it.</p><p>Sitting near the back, Xu Chihuang couldn’t take it any further. He suddenly stood up and said, \"I, Xu Chihuang, might be the weakest one here. But I have some words I need to let out. Our planet is increasingly targeted by more alien powers. If this carries on, there will be one day when we’re trampled under someone else’s feet. Rogue Cultivator 2705 was first on the Mortal King Board, and I believe, even at the Earth King Board, he would fair well too. This sort of genius, we should be seeking to nurture him. How can we constantly call for his death?\"</p><p>Wu Xiang coldly swept his eyes across Xu Chihuang, then he turned and left. He couldn’t be bothered to listen to the nagging of an elementary stage Worldly Immortal.</p><p>\"Grandmaster Wu Xiang, it’s up to you if you must deal with that Rogue Cultivator 2705. But there’s one thing I must say, if you act against the other cultivators of the Lost Continent, even if I have to give up my position as the Star Lord, I will not let it go.\" Chi Tong’s words were tinged with killing intent.</p><p>An icy cold sensation pervaded throughout the entire Universal Hall, leaving astonishment brewing in everyone’s hearts. Few knew of Chi Tong’s true power, but this sort of killing intent was enough to show that Chi Tong’s cultivation was definitely not shallow.</p><p>Wu Xiang snorted and left. He was intending to first massacre all the Lost Continent cultivators that came over, then kill Rogue Cultivator 2705. Thereafter, he would still go to the Lost Continent and slaughter everyone there, not even leaving behind cats and dogs.</p><p>Now that Chi Tong had actually raised this matter, he could only let things rest. He wasn’t very sure about the Star Lord’s power. But during his previous exchange, he understood that the Star Lord’s power was terrifyingly higher than his. Wu Xiang understood his own power, he was an existence without equal among those below the Earthly Immortal Stage.</p><p>Since the Star Lord was stronger than him, it would mean that the Star Lord had probably advanced past the Worldly Immortal Stage and had become a true Earthly Immortal. Following Wu Xiang’s departure, the crowd started to take their leave. This was supposed to be a pre-war conference, but towards the end, it suddenly took a strange turn.</p><p>…</p><p>After leaving Universal Palace, Xia Clan’s Xia Dandao immediately sent out a clan order, dispatching every cultivator at the True God Stage and above to enter into space. They only had one purpose, that was to find Rogue Cultivator 2705’s whereabouts.</p><p>Actually, Xia Dandao could guess that Rogue Cultivator 2705 was Mo Wuji. The two had appeared at too similar timings. Moreover, Mo Wuji had used the steel pole before, just like Rogue Cultivator 2705.</p><p>If Rogue Cultivator was really Mo Wuji, that would mean that he had at least three half moon keys on him. As the day that the Half Moon Immortal Palace opens drew closer, what would having three half moon keys mean?</p><p>…</p><p>At the same time, Yan Clan’s Yan Qiren had gathered all of the clan’s experts.</p><p>Yan Qiren looked at the experts in front of him, and slowly said, \"According to the news I’ve just received, the cultivator that killed Li Xiuran looks like Mo Wuji. Moreover, the two of them have certain similarities; they both use lightning skills, and they both possess a pole-type weapon. Previously, the Universal Hall’s Nirvana Pole Shadow should have been purchased by Mo Wuji.</p><p>Previously, all of us were sure that Mo Wuji was unable to survive in the Extreme Frost Sea. But, what if? What if Mo Wuji didn’t die in the Extreme Frost Sea? Then everything would be explained. Mo Wuji is Rogue Cultivator 2705.\"</p><p>Star Cloud Hall Master Yan Qiren nodded, \"I agree with the Patriarch’s words. The possibility that Mo Wuji is Rogue Cultivator 2705 is close to 90%. Even if he isn’t, being able to kill Li Xiuran means that this Rogue Cultivator 2705 is not simple. Those three half moon keys belong to our Yan Clan. we must immediately find it. I advise, immediately mobilise all Heaven Realm experts of our Yan Clan, to take revenge for Yangdong.\"</p><p>No one stood forward to rebut. Taking revenge for Yan Yangdong was just a pretense. Killing Mo Wuji was their real goal. Taking revenge for Yan Yangdong was fake, killing Mo Wuji was real.</p><p>But if Rogue Cultivator 2705 was really Mo Wuji, then a huge calamity would befall the Yan Clan. [1] With Rogue Cultivator 2705 exceptional talent, then it was not impossible for him to advance into the Earthly Immortal Stage.</p><p>The moment Rogue Cultivator 2705 enters the Earthly Immortal Stage, then the Yan Clan that pursued after him would be wiped of the face of the planet.</p><p>At the same time, the Mou Clan, the various hall masters all sent out their Heaven Realm experts, all to catch Mo Wuji.</p><p>This time, they were acting differently. Everyone was doing things stealthily, as though they were afraid that they would get caught.</p><p>…</p><p>\"Kakaka!\" On a shattered rock, the spirit pith stone mushrooms around Mo Wuji disintegrated. Mo Wuji stood up at that moment.</p><p>\"Shuai Guo, the appearance of the Half Moon Immortal Palace is near. Let’s go to the Universal Hall.\" After four over months of cultivation, Mo Wuji seemed to have depleted 70% of his spirit pith stone mushrooms, and he had barely managed to raise his cultivation to True God Stage Level 2. He was very clear, the moment he reached Universal Hall, there would be a gruelling battle.</p><p>\"Yes Master!\" Shuai Guo had long been bored still. Now Mo Wuji wanted to go to the Universal Hall, to it, it was simply a dream come true.</p><p>[1] I don’t understand why the author says this. Didn’t they determine that the two of them are the same people, so didn’t they already decide to kill Rogue Cultivator 2705 despite his talent?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
