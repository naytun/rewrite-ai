Mo Wuji, who was thoroughly shocked at his Great Art of Destruction, immediately sent his spiritual will towards that person. He was instantly struck with a pleasant surprise.</p><p>\"Senior Cang!\" Mo Wuji hurriedly went to greet him.</p><p>Mo Wuji had a deep respect towards Cang Zhengxing. Not only did he learn many things from Cang Zhengxing, he also found in Cang Zhengxing the true magnanimity of an expert.</p><p>Cang Zhengxing was clearly also happy to see Mo Wuji. He stared questioningly at the collapsing space and the ruins of God Burial Valley and asked, \"What's going on?\"</p><p>Mo Wuji said awkwardly, \"I just gained insights on a sacred art and I went ahead to try it here. I didn't expect that this sacred art would be so tyrannical, to be able to destroy the entire God Burial Plains.\"</p><p>In the past, God Burial Valley was a mountain valley. Right before Mo Wuji used his Great Art of Destruction, it was a plain. But now, it wasn't even a plain.</p><p>\"Your single sacred art destroyed God Burial Valley?\" Cang Zhengxing looked at Mo Wuji in shock. Even though he obtained the fortune to step into the Great Circle of the Unity God Stage during the restoration of God World, he might not be able to destroy God Burial Valley even with 10 different sacred arts.</p><p>Without waiting for Mo Wuji to reply, Cang Zhengxing asked, \"What's that sacred art?\"</p><p>Mo Wuji had no intentions of hiding it from Cang Zhengxing, \"It's the Great Art of Destruction. Back when God World was restored, I obtained it from the Chasm of Laws.\"</p><p>Cang Zhengxing went blank. After some time, he finally spoke, \"Fortunately, you were the one who obtained this sacred art. If the Gods Race were ones that obtained it, the other races in God World would definitely be put in danger. In the past, the Gods Race used the Minor Curse Arts to kill millions of people…\"</p><p>Cang Zhengxing subconsciously stopped speaking. Although the Great Art of Destruction didn't land in the hands of the Gods Race, wasn't God World still in crisis?</p><p>\"Senior Cang, could something have happened?\" Mo Wuji only needed a single glance at Cang Zhengxing's dispirited expression to know that Cang Zhengxing had something else he wanted to say.</p><p>Cang Zhengxing nodded and sighed, \"I'm truly happy to be able to see you here. Unfortunately, just at the God World was restored, it is going to be destroyed. Ah… If I knew this would happen, I would prefer it if the God World wasn't restored.\"</p><p>Compared to Mo Wuji, Cang Zhengxing, Blazing Heaven, Clear Rise and co, had deeper sentiments towards God World. They had stayed here for tens of thousands of years; this place was their home.</p><p>\"Could Senior be talking about that green-robed Sage Nun that came to God World?\"</p><p>\"Yes, Nirvana Learning Academy's Paramita Flower suddenly started to grow. With the Laws of the Paramita Flower, Throned Gods were able to enter the God World… Eh, Wuji, how did you know that the Sage Nun has arrived in God World?\" Because of his concern towards the God World, Cang Zhengxing only realised that there was something wrong with Mo Wuji's words in the second half of his sentence.</p><p>Mo Wuji did not hide anything as he revealed his escape from God Burial Cave. Not only that, he told Cang Zhengxing that the reason for using the Great Art of Destruction here was to trap that Sage Nun in God Burial Cave, so that she couldn't come out.</p><p>\"Ah…\" This pleasant piece of news caused Cang Zhengxing to be unable to react. After a few breaths of time, he finally grabbed hold of Mo Wuji and said agitatedly, \"You did well, you did well…\"</p><p>Thereafter, he didn't wait for Mo Wuji to ask anything and started talking about how they destroyed the Paramita Flower. At the same time, he told Mo Wuji that the Sage Nun only needed a single move to kill 100,000 God Continent cultivators.</p><p>\"That woman is truly murderous.\" Mo Wuji had some lingering fears. If that woman hadn't been careless, how could he have a chance to escape from that vicious woman?</p><p>Cang Zhengxing's tone seemed to be clearly more relaxed, \"Fortunately, you delayed that woman in God Burial Cave. Otherwise, that woman would probably extract God World's fate and uproot its world channel.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji shook his head and said solemnly, \"Senior Cang, it's true that I have destroyed God Burial Plains. Ordinary people might not be able to escape but that woman is not ordinary. She is a Sage. The reason why she hasn't come out is probably because of the Resting Land of Gods…\"</p><p>As he said this, Mo Wuji explained the situation with the Resting Land of Gods and God Thrones to Cang Zhengxing. Cang Zhengxing also knew about God Thrones, it was just that he didn't know about it in the same detail as Mo Wuji.</p><p>When he heard Mo Wuji's words, Cang Zhengxing finally realised that the God World was simply another piece of mud that could be trampled on by Throned Gods.</p><p>\"It seems like only breaking into the Quasi-Sage Stage is enough to prevent the God World from being harvested,\" Cang Zhengxing sighed.</p><p>Mo Wuji shook his head, \"Senior Cang, even if you break into the Quasi-Sage Stage, the God World will still be harvested. That woman is not someone that a Quasi-Sage can deal with.\"</p><p>\"Do you have some other method?\" Cang Zhengxing knew that Mo Wuji wasn't a simple person. Moreover, Mo Wuji had the Great Art of Destruction which was able to destroy the entrance of the God Burial Cave. This caused Cang Zhengxing to have some expectations towards Mo Wuji.</p><p>Perhaps, there might come a day when Mo Wuji saves the God World.</p><p>Mo Wuji clasped his fists and said, \"Senior Cang, junior was actually on his way to find you. There's a matter which requires senior's help.\"</p><p>Cang Zhengxing did not hesitate to say, \"Tell me. As long as I, Cang Zhengxing, can do it, I will.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji said, \"Back when I was in Nirvana Learning Academy, there was a competition for cultivation resources. The venue for this competition was an owner-less planet. Junior hopes that Senior Cang can reveal the location of this owner-less planet; junior intends to go to that planet and cultivate for a period of time.</p><p>Mo Wuji had already planned to find a place to cultivate. If he hadn't met Cang Zhengxing, he would have searched for some remote place. But now that he encountered Cang Zhengxing, he was naturally going to ask about that owner-less planet.</p><p>That planet contained large amounts of primordial energy. Not only did his cultivation rise rapidly there, he also obtained the Extreme Ice Heavenly Bamboo. Eventually, he used the Extreme Ice Heavenly Bamboo to exchange for the Time Plate.</p><p>Most importantly, Kun Yun knows that there was a powerful treasure on that planet. This treasure was so powerful that Kun Yun disregarded the Extreme Ice Heavenly Bamboo. Besides wanting to raise his cultivation to the Unity God Stage, Mo Wuji also wanted to search for that treasure.</p><p>When Cang Zhengxing heard Mo Wuji's words, he did not hesitate to retrieve a crystal ball and handed it to Mo Wuji, \"Wuji, this crystal ball holds the location of that owner-less planet. Also, you need to be careful of Xing Mu. That fella tried to screw you once, almost getting you killed. However, he did save my life recently, and he did join hands with me to destroy the Paramita Flower. Thus, I don't intend to haggle with him any further.\"</p><p>\"Many thanks, Senior Cang. Junior understands.\" Mo Wuji expressed his gratitude as he received the crystal ball.</p><p>Cang Zhengxing laughed faintly, took out a jade box and handed it to Mo Wuji, \"This is for you.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji accepted the jade box and looked at Cang Zhengxing quizzically. He was waiting for Cang Zhengxing to explain.</p><p>Cang Zhengxing pointed at this jade box and said, \"Inside, there are some fragments of the Paramita Flower. Back when Xing Mu and I destroyed a petal of the Paramita Flower, I casually picked these fragments up. Thereafter, I heard that green-robed woman was rushing to some other place, so she didn't pursue this matter. However, I'm sure that these fragments are useful. The moment that woman is done with her matter, she would remember about these fragments.\"</p><p>The Sage Nun was born from a red lotus. Although her cultivation is peerless and her insights to the Dao are profound, she could not compare to old fellas like Cang Zhengxing in terms of wisdom. Besides her fortune, she was able to become a Sage because of external reasons. It could be said that she was the least cunning Sage among the eight. Moreover, she was extremely conceited.</p><p>Mo Wuji elatedly accepted the jade box and said, \"Many thanks, Senior. This thing is going to be useful.\"</p><p>This thing was naturally useful to Mo Wuji. With these Paramita Flower fragments, not only could he have a sensing of Qu You's and Shuyin's location, it could also allow him to feel the Sage Nun's location.</p><p>\"That's good.\" Cang Zhengxing chuckled. Ever since he heard that Mo Wuji had destroyed the Sage Nun's exit, his mood had improved significantly.</p><p>Mo Wuji also took out a storage ring and a jade box and handed them to Cang Zhengxing, \"Senior Cang, I don't have many things but here are some god spiritual veins and a vase of the Breath of Hongmeng. I wonder if these things would be useful for senior to break into the Quasi-Sage Stage.\"</p><p>\"Breath of Hongmeng! It's useful, it's useful… Hurry and keep it. People would be able to sense its aura easily. It's better for you to keep it for yourself…\" Cang Zhengxing said anxiously when he felt the aura of the Breath of Hongmeng.</p><p>Mo Wuji laughed, \"Senior, I have plenty of it. With my current power, no one else besides that woman can do anything to me.\"</p><p>\"Good, good…\" Cang Zhengxing knew that now wasn't a time to be sentimental with Mo Wuji. He hurriedly grabbed the Breath of Hongmeng and threw it into his own world.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
