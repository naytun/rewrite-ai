Kun Yun was scolding 'f*ck you' at others but also criticising other people for lacking manners.</p><p>Seeing that a mere Heavenly God ant dared to speak so boldly to him, killing intent flashed in God King Dark Bodhi's eyes. He was a God King, but this amount of patience wasn't beyond him. In his eyes, Kun Yun was the the same as Mo Wuji: dead men. However, they couldn't be killed now. While he dared to break open the restriction in this small resthouse, he didn't dare to kill anyone here. The person in control of the New God Domain City wasn't some God King expert of God Domain, but a Unity God expert of the God Continent.</p><p>Without caring about Kun Yun, God King Night Bodhi added on, \"Mo Wuji, there are some things I would like you to cooperate with me for. If you're not willing to leave with me, I'll just have to talk to you here.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji stood up, \"Then let's go outside.\"</p><p>This small resthouse couldn't withstand an expert like God King Night Bodhi, hence Mo Wuji didn't intend to start a fight here.</p><p>Kun Yun continued sitting there, saying to Mo Wuji, \"Come back soon. I've been waiting for you for a few years, not only a few days.\"</p><p>In his eyes, it would be a piece of cake for Mo Wuji, a God Monarch, to kill a God King.</p><p>\"You should come along as well.\" God King Night Bodhi's gaze swept across Kun Yun.</p><p>Drinking the god spiritual tea in his cup in one gulp, Kun Yun coldly replied, \"Who are you to ask me to move. Get lost!\"</p><p>The last two words hit God King Night Bodhi like a heavy hammer, causing a distasteful feeling to bubbling within.</p><p>This thoroughly shocked Night Bodhi and cold sweat appeared on his back. At this point, he was sure that Kun Yun definitely wasn't a simple Heavenly God. If two words from a mere Heavenly God could create an emotional imbalance in him, then he, Ding Zicheng, was too weak. The words 'Get lost' also had top notch Laws of the Heaven and Earth integrated into them, which directly tore through his mental defences. God king Night Bodhi wasn't even sure if Unity God experts could pull this off as this required an extremely deep understanding of the Laws of Heaven and Earth.</p><p>Since Mo Wuji sat together with this expert of unknown strength, it made God King Night Bodhi doubt whether his decision to come here was the right choice.</p><p>\"What now, didn't God King Night Bodhi come to invite me out? I've already stood up, why don't you lead the way?\" Mo Wuji stared at God King Night Bodhi, whose expression didn't change. Deep inside, he was shocked as well. At this moment, he also suspected if he would be a match for Kun Yun if he tried to attack.</p><p>However, Mo Wuji soon felt relieved. He was the founder of the Mortal Dao, and when Kun Yun shouted out those two words, it should have included one of the Laws of Heaven and Earth in them. That might have affected God King Night Bodhi's dao and made him back off, but it might not have necessarily affected Mo Wuji's great dao.</p><p>\"Sure.\" God King Night Bodhi didn't want to stay here for another second at all and quickly backed off. He had already made up his mind. If Mo Wuji wasn't willing to follow him out of New God Domain City, he would leave temporarily. Only when he found enough help would he come back to see what Kun Yun was made of.</p><p>Once they exited the small resthouse, the large plaza of God Domain's Hall of Mission was before them.</p><p>With a few steps, Mo Wuji landed in the center of this plaza, looking at God King Night Bodhi and another God King that he didn't recognise while calmly speaking, \"Night Bodhi, quickly ask whatever questions you may have.\"</p><p>Originally, God King Night Bodhi wanted to forcibly bring Mo Wuji out of New God Domain City, but the appearance of the mysterious Kun Yun made him restrain himself, and instead he said, \"Mo Wuji, back in the newly incubated God Domain Nest, were the tens of Nine Evolutions God Sect disciples killed by you?\"</p><p>Mo Wuji grinned, \"They were killed by me. Back then I was acting out of self defence, hence I naturally had to fight back when they tried to kill me. Ok, now it's my turn to ask questions. Was the Heavenly Mortal Sect eliminated by the Nine Evolutions God Sect? Was Heavenly God Sect's God King Pang Jie killed by you and a few others? How many people were involved?\"</p><p>\"I don't know. Since you've already answered my question, I'll take my leave.\" Due to his fear of Kun Yun, God King Night Bodhi, who originally planned to take Mo Wuji away, actually gave up on this idea for now.</p><p>Raising his hand and throwing out an array flag, Mo Wuji laughed coldly, \"You want to leave? Wait for your next life.\"</p><p>The moment that the array flag was thrown out, the deathtrap array of the New God Domain City appeared in Mo Wuji's consciousness with extreme clarity. At this point, if Mo Wuji wanted to trap anyone, he could do so by activating the deathtrap god array through this array flag.</p><p>Mo Wuji couldn't help but mutter to himself, \"What a strong Grade 7 deathtrap god array.\"</p><p>This deathtrap god array could take out tens of God Kings easily upon activation, much less if it were two God Kings only.</p><p>\"The deathtrap god array of New God Domain City?\" God King Night Bodhi screamed out in fear after being trapped by the deathtrap god array.</p><p>Many God Kings were aware that the New God Domain City had a Grade 7 deathtrap god array. However, no one knew how this array was set up and where the array base was.</p><p>Only after Mo Wuji activated the deathtrap god array did God King Night Bodhi know how terrifying it was.</p><p>The space around him turned deathly grey, and when he raised his hand to tear the grey space apart, his primordial spirit seemed to be stuck in sludge, unable to make any moves at all.</p><p>The other God King that was in the deathtrap god array wasn't any better. He had just advanced to God King for a short period of time, and he knew very clearly that this god array wasn't something that he could break through at his current level of strength. Hence once he entered the god array, he shouted, \"Dao Friend Mo, the incident back in the day had nothing to do with me. I was always in closed door cultivation and didn't know anything about the Heavenly Mortal Sect.\"</p><p>Upon hearing this, Mo Wuji regained his senses as well. His deathtrap array's trap portion had only been partially activated and these two God Kings had already been successfully trapped, even without activating the killing array part. This made him even more impressed with how strong Cang Zhengxing's Array Dao was. That array flag was an unparalleled existence in the New God Domain City.</p><p>With the entire plaza outside of the New God Domain City under the control of Mo Wuji's deathtrap array, Mo Wuji was aware of every single cultivator inside the array.</p><p>Thus, Mo Wuji quickly threw out a few runes which ejected all unrelated cultivators from the deathtrap array.</p><p>\"Today, two members of the Nine Evolutions God Sect started an attack in the New God Domain City and will be dealt with. All related personnel please leave the area immediatelyâ€¦\" As Mo Wuji spoke, he activated the killing array portion.</p><p>Those cultivators who were thrown out had already long fled the area without Mo Wuji saying anything else.</p><p>\"Boom boom!\" Once the killing array was activated, two flashes of blood burst out. Regardless whether it was God King Night Bodhi, who was at God King Level 4, or the newly minted God King, they didn't have the ability to fight back at all and were directly eliminated by the killing flashes within the deathtrap array.</p><p>After the deed was done, Mo Wuji stood there, stunned. How could it have been this easy?</p><p>Two God Kings were killed just like that but not even a splash was made.</p><p>Noticing many beams of light coming his way, Mo Wuji quickly kept the array flag and swept up the storage rings of both God Kings.</p><p>\"There's not much use in taking their storage rings. Their good stuff will definitely not be inside.\" Kun Yun's voice echoed out.</p><p>Yet, Mo Wuji didn't care about Kun Yun and incinerated both God Kings with two balls of fire while a few beams of light landed in front of him.</p><p>Mo Wuji took out the array flag, \"There's nothing concerning you here. Not long ago these two men openly destroyed the Black Mustard God Merchant House, and I've already killed them.\"</p><p>\"New God Domain City's Castellan Heng Tong greets the Flag Controller.\" A middle aged cultivator rushed over and bowed respectfully before Mo Wuji.</p><p>This array flag from Cang Zhengxing was a good tool indeed - even the castellan had to pay his respects. It seemed like this Heng Tong was stronger than God King Night Bodhi, probably at God King Level 5 or 6.</p><p>As a Grade 5 God Array King and a Tier 5 God Pill King, a God King bowing to him wasn't much, and Mo Wuji nodded, \"Just now the Black Mustard God Merchant House had an argument with these two God Kings and in the end the two of them actually dared to make a move in New God Domain City, directly destroying the merchant house. To uphold the laws of the city, I killed the both of them in a fit of rage.\"</p><p>\"Roger, does the envoy have any other instructions?\" Heng Tong didn't have any questions about the killing of two God Kings, instead asking Mo Wuji if there were any further instructions.</p><p>\"Mhmm.\" Mo Wuji replied. \"Although the Black Mustard God Merchant House was destroyed, they had it coming. They exchanged low levelled cultivators' lives for god lattice crystals. In the name of New God Domain City, go to round up everyone related to the Black Mustard God Merchant House. Don't let a single piece of Black Mustard trash escape.\"</p><p>\"Roger.\" Heng Tong bowed respectfully once more before leaving swiftly.</p><p>The area outside of the Hall Of Missions returned to its peaceful state. Even those who had witnessed everything quickly left. No one dared to stay here for long.</p><p>Kun Yun chuckled, \"You sure like to concern yourself with useless things.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji casually responded, \"I do like to concern myself with useless things. If you're not happy about that, you can not work with me.\"</p><p>\"Why would I be unhappy with it. What has this nonsense have to do with me. Let's go, we'll go back to continue our discussion.\" Kun Yun waved his hand.</p><p>\"You must have your eyes in the Mortal Dao that I cultivate right? Does the thing we're cooperating on require my Mortal Dao?\" Mo Wuji was still wary of Kun Yun. While Kun Yun appeared to be a Heavenly God, a mere two words from him could shut a God King up. This level of strength was way beyond his own.</p><p>Although he got rid of two God Kings without executing an attack himself, it was because he could control the Grade 7 deathtrap god array of New God Domain City. Once outside of the city, he might not have been an ant to God Kings, but he would only be able to run away.</p><p>\"You're not wrong. But I assure you that there are great benefits to be reaped for you.\" Kun Yun patted his chest.</p><p>Waving it off, Mo Wuji replied, \"The benefits can wait. If you want me to help you, you will have to help me first.\"</p><p>\"Speak, what help do you require?\" Kun Yun had a bad feeling about this.</p><p>\"I'm very angry that those two God Kings interrupted us just now. I want to wipe out both of their sects.\" Mo Wuji decided to make use of this opportunity to get rid of the Nine Evolutions God Sect and the Phoenix Soul God Estate.</p><p>All this while he never liked to hold a grudge overnight, but now so many years had passed and he had not gotten his revenge yet.</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
