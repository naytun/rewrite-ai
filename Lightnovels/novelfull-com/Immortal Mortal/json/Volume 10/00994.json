Mo Wuji had forged many halberds before, so this halberd's appearance was not bad. Its quality was also not bad.</p><p>Even though Mo Wuji knew that forging a low-grade god equipment wasn't something amazing, he believed that he definitely wouldn't be eliminated. After all, he had been studying the Equipment Dao for several years. Compared to those people that only knew how to cultivate, this low-grade god equipment of his was definitely enough to pass the test. To him, he did not care about being at the top. As long as he could get into Nirvana Learning Academy, he would have succeeded.</p><p>After Mo Wuji placed his magic treasure in the transfer whirlpool, the results were as he had expected: a whirlpool array gate appeared in front of Mo Wuji. Once again, Mo Wuji engraved his name and walked onto the next test.</p><p>There was one good point about this assessment: you didn't know the scores of others. That way, you would continue to have hope if you didn't get eliminated.</p><p>…</p><p>After three tests, Mo Wuji's name was ranked second.</p><p>The first place was now Ji Feiyan. After three tests, Mo Wuji's total score was only 242.5 while Ji Feiyan's total score was 249.</p><p>Although Mo Wuji had dropped to second place, most eyes were still on his name. After all, Mo Wuji was a rogue cultivator while Ji Feiyan was a genius of Star Concealing Mountain. It didn't matter whether Ji Feiyan performed well because other sects would not stand to gain anything from him.</p><p>\"That rogue cultivator seems to be lacking. After the third test, his ranking dropped. By the time the fourth test ends, he would probably fall out of the top ten.\"</p><p>\"This is called lacking? How can you compare that rogue cultivator to Ji Feiyan? That 2705 was able to win Ji Feiyan in the first round and obtain first place after the second round. He should already be considered a peak genius. As long as this rogue cultivator doesn't get eliminated, he would definitely make it into Nirvana Learning Academy.\"</p><p>\"Keke, but the fourth test is Pill Dao. Have you heard of any rogue cultivators that were strong in the Pill Dao? How many rogue cultivators would have the capacity to learn the Pill Dao?\"</p><p>\"Why not? God Pill King Green Robes was a rogue cultivator. Not only was he a God King, he was a God Pill King?\"</p><p>\"How could you use God Pill King Green Robes as an example? There's only one God Pill King Green Robes in the entire God Continent. Moreover, when God Pill King Green Robes became famous, he wasn't merely at the Nascent God Stage, right?\"</p><p>…</p><p>Compared to the idle discussions of these cultivators, the huge sects placed much more focus on Rogue Cultivator 2705. Everyone knew clearly what a rogue cultivator getting into the top 10 of the assessment meant. The resources that he would have was something that every sect wanted to obtain.</p><p>Everyone was making inquiries on this Rogue Cultivator 2705, where did he come from and what was his background. They all hoped that they could make contact with a friend of Rogue Cultivator 2705.</p><p>High Firmament God Sect was naturally one of the sects eagerly paying attention to Mo Wuji. When Mo Wuji was still second place after the third test, High Firmament God Sect's Left Firmament Mountain Lord Lao Yu could no longer hold it in. He looked at Chi Kun and asked, \"Chi Kun, is Rogue Cultivator 2705 Mo Wuji?\"</p><p>Chi Kun also had his suspicions that Rogue Cultivator 2705 was Mo Wuji but he did not dare to confirm that. Now that the Left Firmament Mountain Lord was questioning him, he could only say, \"I'm also not very sure. However, that Mo Wuji is indeed far from ordinary. The fourth test is the Pill Dao. After the fourth round ends, we can be sure. It's just that Mo Wuji's spiritual roots are poor, so his combat power isn't very good. However, I heard that Rogue Cultivator 2705 obtained his placing through the Duel Competition and he even won 31 battles in a row. If it was Mo Wuji, he probably couldn't have won 31 matches.\"</p><p>Lao Yu nodded. Mo Wuji was a Tier 4 God Pill Master while the fourth round was a Pill Dao Test. As long as Mo Wuji was still among the top after the fourth round, it would mean that Mo Wuji was definitely Rogue Cultivator 2705.</p><p>As for battle capabilities, without an actual battle, who could be sure about Mo Wuji's combat power? If it was him, he also wouldn't easily reveal his power. It was true that spiritual roots were the greatest limiting factors of a person's combat power. However, this was more pronounced at higher cultivations. Now, everyone participating was a Nascent God, so the difference in spiritual roots quality and combat power was minimised.</p><p>…</p><p>After entering the fourth round, Mo Wuji felt as though he had returned to the Pill Dao Honour Tower. There was also a house, as well as a white jade wall filled with the names of various pills. These pills ranged from Tier 9 immortal pills to Tier 5 god pills.</p><p>What gave Mo Wuji a pleasant surprise was that if he took out his Pill Dao Honour Tower's Honour Token, he could obtain his god herbs for free. The premise was that he must have concocted the pill before.</p><p>Mo Wuji did not hesitate to retrieve his Tier 4 God Pill Master Honour Token and insert it into the groove beside the transfer array disc. At the same time, he tapped Tier 4 Xuan Life God Pill.</p><p>The price of Tier 4 god herbs wasn't cheap and all god pills concocted here would go to Nirvana Learning Academy. Now that he could get free god herbs, Mo Wuji naturally wasn't going to waste his own.</p><p>He had concocted the Xuan Life God Pill before. With his abilities, he could easily concoct 9 unique-grade Xuan Life God Pills. However, Mo Wuji was sure that his current results weren't that bad, so he only concocted 6 high-grade Xuan Life God Pills.</p><p>After the 6 high-grade Xuan Life God Pills were transferred away, Mo Wuji walked towards the fifth test in a carefree manner.</p><p>In the Talisman Dao Test, Mo Wuji chose to craft a Grade 3 Minor Surrounding Trap Talisman; this was a talisman which could support you in battles. Back when he was growing his Green Dew Rice, Mo Wuji crafted this talisman more than once. More importantly, he had the materials for this talisman.</p><p>The Talisman Dao Test was the same as the Pill Dao Test. If he had an Honour Token, he could also redeem the materials for free. However, Mo Wuji didn't go to the Talisman Dao Honour Tower, so he had to take out his own materials.</p><p>…</p><p>Nirvana Dao City's plaza was now in a hubbub of discussion.</p><p>\"He's first again. After the fourth test, that Rogue Cultivator 2705's points is already 332.5\"</p><p>\"That fella is amazing. He got 90 points from the fourth test. Could he be a Tier 4 God Pill Master?\"</p><p>\"That should be the case. If he wasn't a Tier 4 God Pill Master, he couldn't even have obtained 90 points in the fourth test. Ji Feiyan's results aren't out yet, but I guess that he wouldn't be able to surpass Rogue Cultivator 2705. I heard that Ji Feiyan was a Tier 3 God Pill Refiner. Even if he concocted the best Tier 3 god pill, he would only have a total of 329 points…\"</p><p>High Firmament God Sect's Mountain Lord Lao Yu was clenching his fists tightly. Even without Chi Kun saying anything, he could guess that Rogue Cultivator 2705 was likely to be Mo Wuji.</p><p>Before he could ask Chi Kun anything, Chi Kun muttered in shock, \"Rogue Cultivator 2705 has actually passed the fifth test. His results are still in first place with a score of 412.5. He's also a Grade 3 God Talisman Master, heavens…\"</p><p>Towards the end, Chi Kun's words were reduced to mumbles. This was because Rogue Cultivator 2705 was truly too shocking.</p><p>\"He's passed the fifth test. Rogue Cultivator 2705 has passed the fifth test.\" Another person could not help but exclaim.</p><p>At the point, there were still people growing Green Dew Rice. There were even some that were trapped in the first round. On the other hand, Rogue Cultivator 2705 had already passed the fifth test and had made it to the sixth test. This was truly too amazing.</p><p>\"Ji Feiyan has also passed the fourth test. His total score is indeed 329…\"</p><p>Even though Lao Yu was a God King, he could not help but be stunned with Mo Wuji's results. A genius like Ji Feiyan that could cultivate and excel in various Daos was as rare as a phoenix feather or a qilin horn. Moreover, Ji Feiyan's success wasn't simply due to his own talent but also the nurturing of Star Concealing Mountain. Imagine, how many sects could be like the Star Concealing Mountain and nurture their disciples in so many different Daos?</p><p>There were billions of Daos under the Heaven. Each one of them required a cultivator to put in boundless time and effort. A cultivator didn't even have enough time to cultivate, so how many people would actually spend their time on learning different Daos?</p><p>\"Elder Ren Fei, did Mo Wuji notice that you were looking for him?\" Thinking about how he could not even find his own sect's disciples names, Lao Yu could not help but stare at Ren Fei and ask.</p><p>Ren Fei's expression wasn't that good. He sighed and said, \"If it was before, I was sure that I didn't see Mo Wuji. But if Mo Wuji was in disguise…\"</p><p>His eyes shot towards Chi Kun and didn't say anything further.</p><p>Who would have thought that Mo Wuji would be in disguise while in High Firmament God Sect, but not here? Moreover, Mo Wuji had previously gone to High Firmament God Sect as a guest and helper. Ren Fei couldn't have used his spiritual will to observe Mo Wuji then.</p><p>Ren Fei also understood the Left Mountain Lord's meaning. If Mo Wuji saw that he had come from High Firmament Sect just to find him, Mo Wuji would definitely have some apprehensions towards High Firmament God Sect.</p><p>Lao Yu sighed, \"Ai, the sect head was wrong in the way he handled this matter. Chi Kun, after that Mo Wuji comes out, try to find some ways to meet him. After all, your relationship with him is not bad.\"</p><p>Yu Chuo, who had been silent the entire time, suddenly said, \"Mountain Lord, that Mo Wuji has some character. If you find him with an ulterior motive, you might only incur his ill will.\"</p><p>Lao Yu sighed. Chi Kun and Yu Chuo had brought a golden goose to High Firmament God Sect. However, they didn't know better and kicked that golden goose away. A chance used to be right in front of their face but...</p><p>One must know that Chi Kun originally intended for Mo Wuji to represent their sect in the assessment.</p><p>\"Yu Chuo, if Rogue Cultivator 2705 is really Mo Wuji, then go and interact with him after the assessment. No matter what, we will not give up. I will now contact the Sect Head and invite him to Nirvana Dao City. If Mo Wuji really gets into the top 10, then this matter will not be simple. If there's no hope, then we would have forgotten about it. But since we have hope and we are acquainted with that Mo Wuji, we will not let things rest just like that.\" This was the first time Lao Yu didn't care about Yu Chuo's opinion and made a firm stand.</p><p>…</p><p>At this time, Mo Wuji had arrived at the sixth test - the Sacred Arts Test. He was surprised when he saw that there were two doors. The door on the left was very short, while the door on the right was very tall.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
