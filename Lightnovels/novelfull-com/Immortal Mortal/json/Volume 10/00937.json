Even though the god spiritual energy here was sparse, Mo Wuji wasn't affected. His intention was to refine the Sage Dao Talisman in his Undying World. The density of god spiritual energy wouldn't matter to him.</p><p>Over the years, Mo Wuji's cultivation level didn't show any signs of improvement. However, the standards of his Array Dao improved drastically. At the very least, he could set up a Grade 3 god array easily. In fact, he would even be able to set up Grade 4 god arrays with a little more practice.</p><p>With the use of low grade god crystals, Shuai Guo advanced into the pinnacle of Class 9. Da Huang completely merged with the Phecda Clay. He was only one step away from entering Nascent God Stage.</p><p>The high grade god spiritual vein gifted by Qu You was placed in the centre of the Undying World. This was where he was going to cultivate.</p><p>This high grade god spiritual vein was the most valuable item Mo Wuji had on him. This was why he decided to refine the Sage Dao Talisman on this spiritual vein.</p><p>The Sage Dao Talisman was always locked in the Undying World ever since he obtained it. Back then when he refined the Sage Dao Talisman, he was merely in the Immortal Emperor Stage.</p><p>Now that he was in the Nascent God Stage Level 3, how much stronger was he as compared to before?</p><p>While Mo Wuji was in the Nascent God Level 3, he had his frightening sea of consciousness and mighty spiritual will. Those were not something even some Heavenly God experts could compare with. In addition to his spiritual will from his spirit storage channel, Mo Wuji was pretty confident in refining the second layer.</p><p>Spiritual will seeped into the Sage Dao Talisman's boundless talisman runes on the second layer of restriction. One talisman runes after another surged overwhelmingly into Mo Wuji's will. Mo Wuji had the experience of refining the first layer so his spiritual will started to polish these talisman runes.</p><p>According to Mo Wuji's plan, all he needed to do was to spend some time to polish the talisman runes of the second layer. Sooner or later, his spiritual will would be able to refine the second layer of restriction.</p><p>As Mo Wuji's spiritual will gathered to increase his speed of polishing, a few sharp talismans charged straight into Mo Wuji's sea of consciousness.</p><p>Before Mo Wuji could react in time, his sea of consciousness trembled vigorously without control. In the next moment, Mo Wuji spat out a mouthful of blood. His spiritual will retracted instantly. He stopped trying to refine the Sage Dao Talisman while his sea of consciousness was still trembling.</p><p>After swallowing a few Zhi Nature Pill, Mo Wuji's trembling sea of consciousness finally calmed down.</p><p>Mo Wuji looked at the suspending Sage Dao Talisman with lingering fears in his heart. He only just started refining the second layer. In this short period of time, the purple violet in his sea of consciousness was attacked by at least two peak grade talismans.</p><p>This was equivalent to ambushing him where he was the weakest. These two god talismans only caused him to spit out a mouthful of blood and not any greater harm. This was only because his sea of consciousness was exceedingly strong. If it was any other cultivator, that two talismans might be enough to tear one's sea of consciousness apart.</p><p>This made Mo Wuji even more certain that refining the second layer of the Sage Dao Talisman was the key to obtaining talismans derived from it. The talismans which attacked him were definitely talismans derived from the Sage Dao Talisman.</p><p>Mo Wuji only tried refining the second layer for a short period of time. In this short period of time, Mo Wuji understood something. If he were to only use his sea of consciousness to slowly polish this Sage Dao Talisman, he might not suffer the attacks from it.</p><p>However, Mo Wuji found this impossible. If he didn't increase the speed of refining, he might need up to a few hundred years just to refine the second layer.</p><p>Mo Wuji definitely wouldn't want to spend a few years, let alone a few hundred years, just to refine one layer.</p><p>If he didn't have the Undying World, he might need to forgo refining this Sage Dao Talisman. In his Undying World, Mo Wuji had nothing but ideas.</p><p>The six pages of the Book of Luo were instantly activated to protect his sea of consciousness. Mo Wuji's spiritual will tried to seep into it once more.</p><p>Once he increased his speed to refine the second layer of restriction, offensive talismans charged over again. This was exactly what Mo Wuji predicted. These talismans consisted of Grade 9 immortal talisman but mostly were Grade 1 god talismans. Occasionally, there were even some Grade 2 god talismans.</p><p>Mo Wuji's spiritual will increased its speed yet again. The faster he tried to refine it, the stronger the attacks by the Sage Dao Talisman.</p><p>Because of the six pages of the Book of Luo which helped protect Mo Wuji, all the attacks from the Sage Dao Talisman was swept away. In the worst case scenario, Mo Wuji's sea of consciousness would tremble slightly.</p><p>In just a few days, Mo Wuji managed to refine one-fifth of it.</p><p>This made Mo Wuji indescribably pleased. If it wasn't for the Book of Luo, he might need a few years just to reach this point.</p><p>His sea of consciousness was very sturdy as it merely trembled a little even after these attacks from the Sage Dao Talisman. It seemed like he could continue increasing the speed of refining the Sage Dao Talisman.</p><p>At the thought of that, Mo Wuji's spiritual will and spirit storage channel's spiritual will were like seawater from a burst dam as it surged upwards. The number of talismans runes being refined increased tremendously. Similarly, the number of attacks on Mo Wuji's sea of consciousness also increased abruptly.</p><p>Each attack was blocked off by the Book of Luo and this made Mo Wuji even more certain. With the help of the Book of Luo, he could still increase the rate of refinement.</p><p>However, his spiritual will reached a limit and his spirit storage channel was already in use. How was he supposed to further increase the speed?</p><p>What would happen if he were to take the initiative to attack the Sage Dao Talisman while his spiritual will refine the restriction? Anyway, he had the help of his Book of Luo. Hence, regardless how strong the attacks of the Sage Dao Talisman were, he wouldn't be severely injured. It was just like how he used the Kun Wu Sword to attack while refining the first layer of the Sage Dao Talisman.</p><p>At the thought of this, Mo Wuji instantly drew out his Kun Wu Sword. He let out a strike on the second layer of restriction.</p><p>With one strike, that vast and boundless talisman runes instantly dispersed. Mo Wuji was like a whale absorbing water as he swept away these talisman runes to refine.</p><p>\"Kacha!\" A wide grey and white space appeared in front of Mo Wuji. Not only did the grey and white space had all sorts of talismans dao runes, talismans were derived from it.</p><p>The second layer of restriction was refined? Mo Wuji was ecstatic. In less than a month, he managed to refine the second layer of the Sage Dao Talisman? One must know that he actually spend almost half a year just to refine the first layer.</p><p>Very soon, Mo Wuji came back to his senses as he was finally convinced that he successfully refined the second layer. The credit was not on himself but on the Book of Luo and Kun Wu Sword. When one was used for defense and one for offense, even the Sage Dao Talisman couldn't do anything.</p><p>Using this technique, he might even be able to refine the third and fourth layers of restriction.</p><p>Without any hesitation, Mo Wuji struck the third layer of restriction with his Kun Wu Sword. He started to refine the third layer immediately. Mo Wuji saw the talismans from the second layer and they were mostly Grade 1 god talismans. Occasionally, there were a few Grade 2 god talismans but it was still far from what he wanted.</p><p>...</p><p>Six months later, Mo Wuji walked out of his Undying World with an exhausted face.</p><p>For the whole six months, Mo Wuji attacked the restriction wildly with his Kun Wu Sword. Concurrently, both his spiritual will was refining the talisman runes immensely without restraint. After using this much energy and effort, the third layer was finally considered refined.</p><p>Mo Wuji spent one month to refine the second layer while he spent another five months refining the third.</p><p>Mo Wuji didn't continue refining the fourth layer because he could barely refine the third layer.</p><p>According to his understanding of the Sage Dao Talisman, he might need numerous years to refine the fourth layer. This was because he only refined the first layer of restriction of the Kun Wu Sword's sword intent. Even if he continued to attack, the fourth layer of the Sage Dao Talismans might not even budge even if he used his Kun Wu Sword.</p><p>In the future when he refined his Kun Wu Sword intent's second or third layer, he would be able to refine the fourth layer of the Sage Dao Talisman.</p><p>Mo Wuji finally obtained his long awaited Grade 4 spatial teleportation god talisman. He even managed to obtain seven of the Grade 3 spatial teleportation god talisman.</p><p>This Grade 4 spatial teleportation god talisman was what Mo Wuji was most desperate for. This was a talisman more superior than any other Grade 4 defensive god arrays.</p><p>Mo Wuji was most worried that after rescuing Qu You, they would be trapped by the Forgotten Creek Dao School. Previously, he heard of how the defensive array of the Forgotten Creek Dao School was one of the most powerful defensive array of the god domain. In fact, it was probably ranked in the top five in the entire God Domain.</p><p>In the God Domain, the God Evolution Sect was the sect with the strongest defensive array. They were the only one with a Grade 5 defensive array.</p><p>Other than the God Evolution Sect, all the other sects only had Grade 4 defensive arrays. Rumours spread that the defensive array of the Forgotten Creek Dao School was a Quasi Grade 5 defensive array.</p><p>In Mo Wuji's eyes, a Quasi Grade 5 defensive array was still a Grade 4 defensive array.</p><p>The Grade 4 spatial teleportation god talisman derived here was naturally not something a talisman master could refine. In fact, even some of the Grade 5 spatial teleportation talisman refined by talisman master might not be able to compare to it.</p><p>Mo Wuji was well aware of how rare an existence like a Grade 5 spatial teleportation talisman was. The only regret was that Mo Wuji didn't even see even a single offensive talisman that he wanted.</p><p>With the talismans that he needed, Mo Wuji could say that he completed the first step. He was not going to be dealing with Nascent Gods or Heavenly Gods. There was a high chance that he would be dealing with a God King. Therefore, before heading towards the Forgotten Creek Dao School, Mo Wuji needed to plan his retreat route properly.</p><p>The escape talisman was only one fifth of his plan. Fortunately, he managed to refine the third layer of restriction so he also managed to obtain a few Grade 3 concealment god talisman. This meant that he didn't need to spend more effort to look for concealment talismans. Only with concealment talismans would he be able to get close to Qu You. Only with teleportation talisman would he be able to escape so he couldn't afford to miss any one of these.</p><p>Since Qu You was tied up on the Punishment Cliff, the Forgotten Creek Dao School wouldn't kill her for the time being. Therefore, he had ample time to set up his escape plan.</p><p>...</p><p>Two more months passed by as Mo Wuji appeared in a boundless swamp. He installed a concealed transfer array here. This transfer array was too small to transfer anyone but he wasn't capable enough to install a bigger transfer array.</p><p>Mo Wuji never thought of using this transfer array to escape. He never witnessed the attacks of a God King but he was certain that escaping with a transfer array wouldn't work against a God King. He had other use for this transfer array and this was the second step of his plan.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
