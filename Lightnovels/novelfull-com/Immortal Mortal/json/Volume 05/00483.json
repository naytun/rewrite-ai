At this moment, he was sitting in front of a pitch black whirlpool.</p><p>This was the sixth month that he started searching the depths of the Lifeless River. It was entirely due to coincidence that he managed to find this place. It was because he saw a piece of Brilliant Curved Space Gold in the vicinity. The Brilliant Curved Space Gold is a smithing material that could forge space-type treasures; not only could it forge a storage ring, it could even create a pocket dimension.</p><p>Logically, Brilliant Curved Space Gold should not appear within the Lifeless River. Thus, after Mo Wuji spotted the piece of Brilliant Curved Space Gold, he immediately started searching the area.</p><p>As a result, he managed to find this black whirlpool. The black whirlpool seemed to be entirely made of a sea of ash; his spiritual will was completely unable to penetrate through it. The moment Mo Wuji sent his spiritual will in, it would be bombarded and grinded away by this black whirlpool.</p><p>Even Mo Wuji didn't dare to enter this whirlpool. Instead, he used this whirlpool to temper his spiritual will. He found that every time his spiritual will got grinded by this whirlpool, when it gets recovered, it would be slightly tougher.</p><p>Mo Wuji soon discovered that this black whirlpool wasn't constantly present; the whirlpool would only appear once in a day, and for undetermined periods of time. Sometimes, it might come appear for an entire incense’s time. On other instances, it only appeared for ten breaths.</p><p>However, this did not affect his intentions of using the whirlpool to temper his spiritual will; after all, both his Domain Crushing Fist and Spatial Imprisonment had high requirements of his spiritual will. If his spiritual will got stronger, his Domain Crushing Fist would also naturally become more powerful.</p><p>He managed to find such a place to temper his spiritual will after much difficulty; so how could Mo Wuji simply give it up?</p><p>As he continued to temper his spiritual will here, Mo Wuji's spiritual will had actually reached a point where it could slightly feel the energy within the black whirlpool. That energy seemed to be like the vast Dao revolving and circling. Even though Mo Wuji wasn't cultivating, he could feel his cultivation level rising.</p><p>At this instant, the black whirlpool was rotating and revolving faster and faster. From his experience, Mo Wuji knew that the faster the whirlpool, the more benefits it would have for his spiritual will.</p><p>\"Boom!\" Mo Wuji's spiritual will penetrated into the whirlpool. A violent and terrifying force came surging over; Mo Wuji felt as though his sea of consciousness was tearing apart as it emitted tremors and roars. The intense ache inundated his entire consciousness and his Mind Palace.</p><p>Mo Wuji had already experienced this situation umpteen times. He didn't make a single move and simply let his spiritual will move freely in the whirlpool. Experience has taught Mo Wuji that the greater pressure and pain he felt with his spiritual will, the more beneficial it will be.</p><p>At the very beginning, Mo Wuji's spiritual will would immediately be devoured the moment it enters this black whirlpool. But now, his spiritual will could stay in this whirlpool for up to half an incense of time.</p><p>Following the gradual depletion of his spiritual will, the ache on his sea of consciousness continued to increase. However, he also knew that this round of whirlpool would be ending soon. He would recover for one day, then continue the same thing tomorrow.</p><p>Just at this moment, a golden light suddenly flashed in Mo Wuji's sea of consciousness; Mo Wuji immediately felt as though he was an ant beneath the feet of giants. There vast and suffocating pressure caused Mo Wuji to feel as though his entire soul was trembling.</p><p>Within that gold light, there seemed to be faint steps. Those steps seemed to head towards somewhere, but Mo Wuji could only feel a blur.</p><p>Just when Mo Wuji wanted to take a look at these steps, that black whirlpool vanished without a trace; those gold steps also disappeared completely.</p><p>Could this be the Immortal Seeking Staircase concealed within the Lifeless River?</p><p>Mo Wuji suddenly stood up; he had never seen the Immortal Seeking Staircase before but he could faintly feel that this was the real Immortal Seeking. It was likely that Ku Ya's words were true; there was truly a path to the Immortal World hidden in the depths of the Lifeless River.</p><p>Mo Wuji spent some time examining the area; he suspected that there was an extremely high grade concealment array here, to the extent where he wasn't able to detect it. Mo Wuji decided that when the whirlpool reappears again the next day, he would go in and take a look, to discern whether it was truly the Immortal Seeking Staircase.</p><p>One day passed in a flash; the black whirlpool emerged once again. Mo Wuji brought out a Grade 2 immortal shield, and charged straight into this black whirlpool.</p><p>He had been around this whirlpool for a month; he believed that it should not be able to take his life.</p><p>The moment he entered this black whirlpool, Mo Wuji immediately felt a strong centrifugal force around him. Even though he had tempered his spiritual will in this whirlpool for a month, he was still unable to control the immortal shield in his hands. That immortal shield was swiftly swept away by the strong force of the whirlpool; even the spiritual will imprint that he left on the shield had been eroded by the whirlpool.</p><p>\"Bang!\" While Mo Wuji was roiled in worry, he actually landed on the ground.</p><p>Beneath his feet was black coloured sand. The whirlpool was right behind him. Mo Wuji guessed that he had just emerged from the other side of the whirlpool.</p><p>10 to 15 meters in front of him, there was a flight of steps that seemed to extend upwards; the top of the staircase was shrouded by mist. This staircase was gold in colour; it was similar to the gold immortal estate left behind by Ku Ya's ancestor.</p><p>Mo Wuji tried sending his spiritual will towards the staircase. It was only a single instant, before the spiritual will got slapped away by some intangible force.</p><p>\"This should be the Immortal Seeking Staircase,\" Mo Wuji thought to himself. Mo Wuji didn't try scaling the Immortal Seeking Staircase, he decided that he would return first.</p><p>…</p><p>\"Brother Tong, I didn't expect that you would be faster than me.\" Abacus came out from the his room in the immortal estate; the first person he saw Tong Ye.</p><p>The immortal aura around Tong Ye was distinct, and he seemed to be brimming with dao ripples. This was clearly the outcome of a fully condensed immortal lattice.</p><p>\"I was only earlier than you by a few days. From the looks of it, your immortal lattice is sturdier than mine,\" Tong Ye laughed. He understood that the more immortal lattice stones used to condense the immortal lattice, the sturdier the immortal lattice would be.</p><p>\"The sect head isn't here?\" Abacus also guessed that his immortal lattice was more condensed as compared to Tong Ye's.</p><p>\"The sect head should have gone to search for the path to the Immortal World.\" Ku Ya's voice could be heard, following which, she walked out of her room. The immortal aura around her was firm, ostensibly, she had also condensed the perfect immortal lattice.</p><p>\"It's still unknown whether the rumor about the path from the Lifeless River to the Immortal World is true. Now that we have all condensed our immortal lattice, we should directly use the Immortal Seeking Staircase,\" Tong Ye said in an offhand manner.</p><p>Ku Ya shook her head, \"We've caused such a huge ruckus in Ying Bian City; we destroyed the transfer array from Ying Bian City to the Immortal World, and we even killed a few Golden Immortals. The Immortal World naturally wouldn't let us off. Moreover, Yong Ying Immortal Domain has always been guarded against the cultivators from Half Immortal Domain, it could even be said that they have an oppressive attitude. So the Immortal Seeking Staircase might not be safe for us. If they station someone at the Immortal Seeking Staircase, then we would only be throwing ourselves into a net by heading towards the Immortal Seeking Staircase.\"</p><p>The moment Ku Ya finished speaking, a spatial ripple came from the space outside of the immortal estate. At the next instant, Mo Wuji's figure appeared within the immortal estate.</p><p>\"Looks like everyone's immortal lattice is very solid.\" Mo Wuji didn't condense his immortal lattice but his judgement was not bad. The moment he saw Ku Ya and co., he knew that the three of them had condensed impressive immortal lattices.</p><p>\"Sect head, Ku Ya said that you went to search for the path to the Immortal World, how did it go?\" Seeing Mo Wuji return, Tong Ye asked hurriedly.</p><p>Mo Wuji nodded, \"I should have found it. When the time comes, we can all take a look. Oh right, in the future, we should address each other by senior or junior brothers and sisters. Even though Tian Ji Sect has been established, we're still senior or junior brothers and sisters. Senior brother Lou and Jia Qi haven't condensed their immortal lattice?\"</p><p>\"We’re already done.\" Lou Chuanhe and Jia Qi walked out together. Han Qingru also walked out behind the two of them.</p><p>\"Because Senior Brother Lou had to pass his Heavenly Immortal Tribulation, he was slower by a single step,\" Ku Ya explained by the side.</p><p>\"I believe that I have already found the Immortal Seeking Staircase within the Lifeless River. After everyone goes to the Immortal World, we need to take note of to cover our tracks. Even though I don’t know why the Yong Ying Immortal Domain wants to deal with the cultivators from Half Immortal Domain, I know that we don’t have the ability to go against them now. I will not be able to go to the Immortal World temporarily. Wait till I get to the Immortal World, I will contact everyone,\" Mo Wuji said, seeing that everyone had gathered.</p><p>\"Brother Mo, why can’t you follow us to the Immortal World?\" Jia Qi asked quizzically.</p><p>Mo Wuji said with a hint of helplessness, \"I believe there’s a problem with my cultivation method. I’m not able to condense my immortal lattice. But there’s no need to worry, I believe that I will be able to solve this problem soon.\"</p><p>After answering that question, Mo Wuji turned to Ku Ya and said, \"Ku Ya, no one should know that we have come from Half Immortal Domain. But the fact is, not only do people know of me, they know of our Immortal-Traversing Ship, and even our large amounts of immortal lattice stones. I want to hear your opinion on this.\"</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
