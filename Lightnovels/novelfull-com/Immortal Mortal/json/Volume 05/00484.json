Thus, Master Pu Zi and her were worthy of suspicion. However, Mo Wuji gave her immortal lattice stones, and even asked her that question. This demonstrated that he trusted her.</p><p>\"There’s only our own people here, feel free to say whatever you want.\" Mo Wuji nodded towards Ku Ya, gesturing that there was no need for Ku Ya to worry. Mo Wuji also knew that if Ku Ya had joined them to save Lou Chuanhe, she wouldn’t have been like Tong Ye and co., to have their tracks discovered as they were sneaking into Ying Bian City.</p><p>With an \"En\", Ku Ya said, \"I only knew that everyone had gotten into trouble after I left the Lifeless River. I started investigating on this matter, and at the same time, tried to find a chance to save Abacus and co. After I knew that only Master Pu Zi and I didn’t go Ying Bian City, I started to suspect Master Pu Zi.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji’s heart started pounding. To be honest, he suspected Master Pu Zi the most. This was because Master Pu Zi wanted the Immortal-Traversing Ship, and Master Pu Zi also knew of their immortal lattice stones. Another thing was, Ku Ya had managed to find traces of him while he was in the Immortal Chasm. Master Pu Zi was better than Ku Ya when it came to both cultivation and experience, and he had control of the Immortal-Traversing Ship. Logically, Master Pu Zi should also have discovered him.</p><p>Since Master Pu Zi would have noticed him, then his solo crossing of the Immortal Chasm would no longer be a secret. And the facts had shown, people do know that an Earthly Immortal from Half Immortal Domain had crossed the Immortal Chasm.</p><p>However, following the meaning implied behind Ku Ya’s words, it seemed like Master Pu Zi had not betrayed their team.</p><p>\"But then, I found that Master Pu Zi completely had no reason to betray our team. If he were to betray the team, his motive would solely be for the Immortal-Traversing Ship. However, during that time, the Immortal-Traversing Ship was in Senior Brother Lou’s hands, and Senior Brother Lou had been imprisoned in Ying Bian City. Thus, if Master Pu Zi were to betray us, with his abilities, he wouldn’t have been able to initiate a trade to get the Immortal-Traversing Ship…\"</p><p>Ku Ya didn’t carry on speaking but Mo Wuji already knew her opinion. Ku Ya’s deduction was logical. However, Mo Wuji believed that for a person like Master Pu Zi, he would definitely have ways to obtain the Immortal-Traversing Ship from Ying Bian City. However, Mo Wuji still wasn’t sure whether it was Master Pu Zi, so he didn’t say anything.</p><p>Mo Wuji didn’t continue speaking; the fact that the Immortal-Traversing Ship was with Lou Chuanhe was only known by this group of them. Moreover, when he obtained Luo Jun’s storage ring, he didn’t find the Immortal-Traversing Ship inside. Luo Jun’s ring only had large amounts of immortal herbs, ores, and even a stack of high grade immortals. But it didn’t have the Immortal-Traversing Ship.</p><p>\"Brother Kou Yuan died because of me. Whether this matter was because of Master Pu Zi or not, we will need to find out the truth eventually. If it was really him, I, Lou Chuanhe, would give it my all, to take revenge for Brother Kou Yuan.\" Lou Chuanhe was also suspicious of Master Pu Zi.</p><p>Ku Ya hesitated slightly before saying, \"We still don’t know whether Brother Kou Yuan is dead or not…\"</p><p>Mo Wuji lifted his hand and interrupted Ku Ya’s words, \"Let’s end this conversation for now. Everyone, follow me to the Immortal Seeking Staircase at the bottom of the Lifeless River. After we get to the Immortal World, we would be a bigger and new world. The most important thing we need to do is still to improve our personal power.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji knew that Ku Ya was suspicious of Kou Yuan, but he believed that Kou Yuan definitely wasn’t a traitor. Regardless of whether Kou Yuan was dead or not, Kou Yuan definitely wouldn’t betray them.</p><p>…</p><p>Half a month later, the group gathered in front of the black coloured whirlpool. Mo Wuji had entered it once before; he knew that this black whirlpool looked terrifying, and it even devoured spiritual will, but in reality, it was not truly threatening.</p><p>Under Mo Wuji’s guidance, the group each entered the black whirlpool.</p><p>\"I’ve been to the Immortal Seeking Staircase at the Corner of Yong Ying. That Immortal Seeking Staircase was faint grey, but this one is actually gold.\" Han Qingru immediately said the moment she saw the towering and immortal energy-rich Immortal Seeking Staircase.</p><p>\"I’ll try first.\" As Abacus said this, he had already set one foot on the Immortal Seeking Staircase.</p><p>Mo Wuji’s spiritual will followed along Abacus; he wanted to see how Abacus was going to climb the Immortal Seeking Staircase. Soon, he discovered that this was useless; his spiritual will was expelled by the Immortal Seeking Staircase.</p><p>The speed at which Abacus climbed wasn’t particularly fast. Even so, he soon vanished from Mo Wuji’s field of vision. Following which, all signs of him disappeared completely.</p><p>\"Looks like this is really the Immortal Seeking Staircase; we can use it to enter the Immortal World,\" Han Qingru said as she saw Abacus disappear.</p><p>\"Junior Brother Mo, we will go to the Immortal World first. We will wait for you there.\" Lou Chuanhe didn’t dilly around; he was very clear of Mo Wuji’s abilities. After all, whether it was the space canyon or Half Immortal Domain, wasn’t Mo Wuji able to leave both of them?</p><p>Likewise, Mo Wuji would definitely be able to leave this Corner of Yong Ying. He would need to hurry to the Immortal World and cultivate. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to catch up to the footsteps of this junior brother of his.</p><p>\"Senior Brother Mo, I’m leaving too.\" Ku Ya bowed towards Mo Wuji, then followed Lou Chuanhe up the Immortal Seeking Staircase.</p><p>After waiting for Ku Ya and Lou Chuange to disappear within the heights of the Immortal Seeking Staircase, Tong Ye also came to bid his goodbyes.</p><p>Even after Tong Ye disappeared, Jia Qi actually still hadn’t went up the Immortal Seeking Staircase. Confused, Mo Wuji asked Jia Qi, \"Junior Sister Jia Qi, why aren’t you climbing the Immortal Seeking Staircase?\"</p><p>Mo Wuji was the Tian Ji Sect Head, and Jia Qi called him ‘Senior Brother’. Naturally, he wouldn’t call Jia Qi, ‘Senior Sister’.</p><p>Jia Qi hesitated before glancing at Han Qingru who was by Mo Wuji’s side. After some time, she said, \"Brother Mo, I’ll be heading off to the Immortal World. It’s just that, just that…\"</p><p>After stammering for a bit, Jia Qi finally caught her breath. She bowed towards Mo Wuji and said, \"Brother Mo, sorry.\"</p><p>After saying this, she hurriedly turned and climbed the Immortal Seeking Staircase.</p><p>Mo Wuji looked at Jia Qi disappeared within the staircase, he muttered in doubt, \"What’s she sorry for?\"</p><p>Han Qingru suddenly said, \"Could she be the one to betray your team?\"</p><p>Mo Wuji shook his head, \"Not possible. Jia Qi has her own pride, she definitely wouldn’t do such a thing. Oh right, Senior Sister Qingru, you should go up too. I will stay here to experiment for a period of time. I believe that I will soon be able to condense my immortal lattice.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji wasn’t boasting when he said this. Even without spiritual roots, he was able to find a way to cultivate, and he even managed to reach the Heavenly Immortal Stage. He didn’t believe that he wouldn’t be able to condense his immortal lattice. Even if condensing his immortal lattice was hard, would it be as hard as cultivating without spiritual roots?</p><p>\"Junior brother, if not for you, I probably would have died already…\"</p><p>Han Qingru seemed to want to tell Mo Wuji something. It was just that after saying that sentence, she didn’t know how to carry on. She took out a storage ring and handed it to Mo Wuji,\"This ring has some herbs that I collected when I was in Hundred Flowers Manor. They are all low tiered herbs. I have no use for them, so I’m giving them to you.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji didn’t reject it. He was prepared to concoct immortal pills, and these herbs would be useful.</p><p>Seeing Mo Wuji keep the storage ring, Han Qingru went silent. After a whole ten breaths of time, she looked at Mo Wuji and said, \"Junior brother, I will be waiting for you at the Immortal World.\"</p><p>After saying that, she stepped onto the Immortal Seeking Staircase. Soon, like the rest, she disappeared.</p><p>Mo Wuji shook his head, and placed the ring in his Undying World. He didn’t try to climb this Immortal Seeking Staircase. Not only didn’t he condense his immortal lattice, he didn’t even have a Heavenly Immortal Domain; he would be instantly kicked out the moment he set foot on this Immortal Seeking Staircase.</p><p>However, Mo Wuji didn’t leave immediately. Instead, he chose a corner and entered his undying World. At this moment, he had a few storage rings from some Golden Immortals, and a whole stack of rings from Heavenly Immortals. He was prepared to empty all of them and start practising on pills. After he becomes able to concoct immortal pills, he would change the herbs he had into immortal pills, then try condensing his immortal lattice.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
