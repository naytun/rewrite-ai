The moment these cultivators came out of the transfer array, they would disappear into the various corners of the Corner of Yong Ying.</p><p>Because of Mo Wuji’s power, even if more Earthly Immortals from Half Immortal Domain came over, no one dared to stop them.</p><p>It was only until one month later that the Immortal World finally rebuilt the transfer array to the Corner of Yong Ying. However, by this time, pretty much all of the Earthly Immortals from Half Immortal Domain had already arrived at the Corner of Yong Ying.</p><p>After re-establishing order in Ying Bian City, the first thing that the Immortal World did was to order the arrest of Mo Wuji.</p><p>Unfortunately, the bark of this wanted order was louder than its bite. Even though Mo Wuji’s image was pasted all over, the number of cultivators that were truly working hard to find Mo Wuji and catch him, was basically zero. Unless Mo Wuji decided to go back to Ying Bian City, no one is brain dead enough to take the initiative to find Mo Wuji.</p><p>Furthermore, all the experts that came from the Immortal World came with a regulation talisman; even a Xuan Immortal would want to cherish his own feathers. After all, Mo Wuji’s reputation in the Corner of Yong Ying was fierce and oppressive; he’s someone who could charge into the Ying Bian City singlehandedly, and even kill the Ying Bian City Castellan Luo Jun.</p><p>Even a Golden Immortal carrying a regulation talisman could only run away if he were to meet such a ferocious person.</p><p>The Corner of Yong Ying settled back down, and despite its efforts, Ying Bian City was only able to catch a few Earthly Immortals that came from Half Immortal Domain.</p><p>After all, even though there were so many Earthly Immortals that came over, the Corner of Yong Ying was so wide and vast, so it was not easy to find them. Moreover, those Earthly Immortals had been trapped in a place like the Half Immortal Domain, their characters had hardened and their mind had become sly. How could they be caught so easily?</p><p>Except for the few hundreds of people that they caught at the start, Ying Bian City no longer caught any more cultivators from Half Immortal Domain. As time passed, the difference between cultivators from Half Immortal Domain and the Corner of Yong Ying disappeared; it was now difficult to distinguish whether a person was from the Half Immortal Domain or the Corner of Yong Ying.</p><p>Yong Ying Immortal Domain seemed to know that Mo Wuji was unable to use the Immortal Seeking Staircase to enter into the Immortal World, so they eventually settled down after an inital search. The only thing they did, was that cultivators that used the Immortal Seeking Staircase at the Corner of Yong Ying, all had to be interrogated and examined.</p><p>…</p><p>In comparison, the Lifeless River seemed desolate and cold.</p><p>Right from the start, the Lifeless River was deficient in immortal spiritual energy. Moreover, it was not suitable for life, so there weren’t even fishes in the river.</p><p>The riverbed of the Lifeless River was also dead silent; Mo Wuji’s Undying World was like the surrounding soil and sand - devoid of any hints of life.</p><p>Mo Wuji was originally a mortal, and he cultivated his own created technique - the reverse Immortal Mortal Technique. After opening all 108 meridians, the world that he created was also plain and ordinary. Even though Mo Wuji gave his world an impressive name: the Undying World, in reality, even Mo Wuji knew that it would be more suitable to call his world the Mortal World.</p><p>This was because this world was just like him, plain, ordinary and with no hints of dao ripples. At this moment, as he concealed himself within the sand at the riverbed of the Lifeless River, he was totally inconspicuous.</p><p>Mo Wuji was currently practising with pills. With more than a hundred Heavenly Immortal rings, and a few Golden Immortal rings, he found a huge pile of immortal herbs and more than a hundred pill formulas.</p><p>These were all low tiered herbs and pill formulas, which were very suitable for practice.</p><p>From Tier 1 to Tier 3 immortal pills, Mo Wuji was able to concoct them with confidence. Moreover, all the pills he concocted had layers of pill aura, just like moving runes. As long as a person who knew about pills saw this, he could tell that these were unique grade immortal pills.</p><p>Mo Wuji’s alchemy was also fostered from his Immortal Mortal Technique. To him, all tiers of immortal herbs, sprouted from an ordinary, mortal roots. With pill techniques fostered by his cultivation technique, Mo Wuji was simply like a fish in water; just like when he cultivated, he didn’t meet with any sort of obstacles. Thus, it was easier for him to concoct pills as compared to other pill refiners; he was able to grasp the immortal herbs’ most basic fundamentals and energy. It was also because of this that his pills were all unique grade.</p><p>For any pill monarch, being able to concoct unique grade Tier 3 immortal pills already put him close to a pill king existence. However, Mo Wuji wasn’t happy. Because till now, he was still unable to purify his herbs to 100% purity.</p><p>At the start, Mo Wuji suspected that this might have been due to a problem with his pill furnace. He had purchased his pill furnace from the Jin Yun Auction, and a part of its restrictions had been broken.</p><p>Afterwhich, Mo Wuji used a Grade 2 immortal pill furnace but he met with the same results. He immediately knew that it was either due to his low cultivation level or low alchemy level.</p><p>It could also be because of the fact that Mo Wuji didn’t have a master. If Mo Wuji had a master, his master would have told him not to do something so stupid as to try to purify a herb to 100% purity.</p><p>It was also because Mo Wuji didn’t have a master that his purification abilities continuously improved. Every time his purification reached another level, he knew that his alchemy level had increased as well. There had never been a pill refiner like Mo Wuji, to be able to purify immortal herbs to a degree infinitesimally close to 100%. However, he was still unsatisfied and he wanted to improve.</p><p>On this day, Mo Wuji finally stopped practising on his pills and alchemy. It wasn’t because he didn’t want to continue, but because he had ran out of immortal herbs.</p><p>It was already close to half a year since Han Qingru and co. went to the Immortal World. He should start thinking of ways to condense his immortal lattice. Now that he could concoct Tier 3 immortal pills, he should be able to establish a foothold even in the Immortal World.</p><p>His Undying World was still grey and dull. Inside, besides Mo Wuji’s large piles of immortal crystals and immortal lattice stones, there was only a wooden cane.</p><p>He had gotten this wooden cane from Meng Tianyu, and he could feel that this wooden cane wasn’t simple. Unfortunately, after moving this Heavenly Wood Cane into the Undying World, it had always been like this. As for the other immortal herbs, after being planted in his Undying World, they would run out of spiritual energy and wither not long later.</p><p>Mo Wuji sighed and stepped out of his Undying World. From the looks of it, if he wanted to turn his Undying World into a garden, he would need the other elemental beads.</p><p>Half a year had passed but the Immortal Seeking Staircase at the Lifeless River was still the same; it was faint gold and is inclined upwards into heights that Mo Wuji couldn’t see. Mo Wuji knew that if he could use the immortal lattice stones to condense his immortal lattice, he would also be able to easily climb up the stairs.</p><p>Mo Wuji had analysed the immortal lattice stones; the immortal lattice stones contained some sort of peerless dao energy. However, this sort of dao energy seemed to be incompatible with his own. It was impossible for him to even use the dao energy to cultivate.</p><p>After countless attempts, Mo Wuji finally gave up on using the immortal lattice stones to condense his immortal lattice. He suspected that these immortal lattice stones were for cultivators with spiritual roots. He didn’t have spiritual roots; he was the only mortal that cultivated. Since he couldn’t condense his immortal lattice, then he could only try his hand at the Immortal Seeking Staircase, to see whether there were ways to force himself into the Immortal World.</p><p>Mo Wuji walked in front of the gold Immortal Seeking Staircase and carefully took one step forward. His foot had merely touched the Immortal Seeking Staircase by a bit when a terrifying force of expulsion came bounding over. At this instant, both Mo Wuji’s spiritual will and immortal elemental energy were scattered. An idea subconsciously appeared in his mind, that he didn’t have the rights to climb the Immortal Seeking Staircase.</p><p>\"Boom!\" Before Mo Wuji could react, he was sent flying outwards. He crushed against the riverbed, forming a deep gull.</p><p>Mo Wuji took in a deep breath and stood back up. This was merely a staircase; he didn’t believe that he was unable to climb it. The more it didn’t allow him to climb it, the more he would try.</p><p>The second time he came to the Immortal Seeking Staircase, it was the same as his previous attempt. Mo Wuji’s foot had only touched the first step before he was sent flying by that terrifying force of expulsion.</p><p>Mo Wuji’s stubbornness flared up. He continuously went back to the Immortal Seeking Staircase, and he continuously got sent flying.</p><p>No matter how many times he got sent flying, he stood back up and went back to the Immortal Seeking Staircase.</p><p>\"Boom!\" Mo Wuji was sent flying for his 98,712nd time. He wasn’t discouraged. Instead, he felt confident.</p><p>Even though it was very slight, Mo Wuji could tell that the time his foot spent on the Immortal Seeking Staircase got longer and longer. As long as he could stay on the Immortal Seeking Staircase for a period of time, he would have the chance to find a solution.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
