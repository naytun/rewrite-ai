As Mo Wuji stood outside the stone fort and scanned it with his spiritual will, he could tell that this smith’s array knowledge was no worse than his. The periphery of the stone fort was installed with all sorts of hidden trigger arrays and trap arrays. If one didn’t understand arrays, he would be easily trapped within. Thereafter, if the person controlling the array attacked, the chances of survival would be close to zero.</p><p>\"Dao Friend Mo, you can follow me in. Don’t worry, nothing will happen,\" As Jia Qi saw Mo Wuji sizing the stone fort up, she took the initiative to say. Mo Wuji smiled faintly, and unhesitantly walked into the stone fort.</p><p>Even if something happens, he wouldn’t be scared. These various arrays were indeed able to block him. But if Jia Qi and that hidden master wanted to take his life, it would be impossible.</p><p>After they walked into the stone fort, Mo Wuji followed Jia Qi up to the second floor. The small stone fort’s second floor only had one room. At the entrance, Mo Wuji could already see a man sitting in the middle of the room.</p><p>\"Master Pu Zi, I’ve brought Mo Wuji here,\" Jia Qi said respectfully by the door.</p><p>\"Since you’re here, come in and take a seat,\" The man in the middle of the room lifted his face; it was filled with a beard.</p><p>After a simple acknowledgement, Jia Qi introduced to Mo Wuji, \"Dao Friend Mo, this is Master Pu Zi. He is a peerless smith. According to what I know, no one else in Half Immortal Domain can match him.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji’s gaze swept across this man. If Jia Qi didn’t introduce Master Pu Zi, Mo Wuji would never believed that this bearded man would actually be a peerless smith. Even his name was a little weird just like Jia Qi, it was called Pu Zi. [1]</p><p>\"Mo Wuji greets the master,\" Mo Wuji clasped his fists and followed Jia Qi into the room.</p><p>Mo Wuji did not know whether this Master Pu Zi was really an expert smith, but he could tell that this fella was definitely very strong; at least in the Great Circle of the Earthly Immortal Stage.</p><p>\"Dao Friend Mo, aren’t you afraid that Jia Qi and I would suddenly attack, to keep you here?\" Master Pu Zi’s gaze landed on Mo Wuji’s face as he spoke unhurriedly. Even though he did not emit any sort of killing intent, his words gave a threatening aura.</p><p>Mo Wuji smiled faintly as he walked to a chair by the side and sat down. He said calmly, \"You don’t dare, and I’m not afraid.\"</p><p>Jia Qi and Pu Zi were both shocked. To Pu Zi’s words, Jia Qi thought that Mo Wuji might reply: \"I believe that you won’t do that\" or \"I trust the two of you, which was why I came here\". She never expected Mo Wuji to actually say \"You don’t dare, and I’m not afraid\".</p><p>Mo Wuji was merely in the intermediate Worldly Immortal Stage; what emboldened him to say such words? There was nothing to fear with regards to killing him. Even if they killed Mo Wuji here, they would absolutely not face any form of repercussions.</p><p>\"Really? Then let me see…\" With that, Pu Zi’s entire body shot up. Following which, a huge fist moved towards Mo Wuji. As Jia Qi spectated from a distance, it looked like he was even condensing space as he punched towards Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji simply sat there, and he also punched out. From the looks of it, this Pu Zi was like him, he also knew a bit about the theories of space. This person could even condense space towards him, he clearly wasn’t a mere novice.</p><p>Mo Wuji did not feel any sort of killing intent from Pu Zi’s body, so his punch also didn’t contain any killing killing intent. In this punch, he also encompassed his minor accomplishments in the theories of space.</p><p>\"Boom!\" The two fists met; elemental energy exploded. Pu Zi recoiled backwards like a broken string, while Mo Wuji did not move a single bit.</p><p>Jia Qi stared blankly at Mo Wuji. She was all too clear about Master Pu Zi’s power; even though he might not be the strongest here, his rich elemental energy far exceeded any advanced Earthly Immortal Stage expert. Mo Wuji was merely in the intermediate Worldly Immortal Stage, and he was actually too lazy to even stand as he matched fists with Pu Zi.</p><p>Could it be that Mo Wuji was not a Worldly Immortal, but an Earthly Immortal?</p><p>Pu Zi did not jump back at Mo Wuji; his heart was filled with greater waves of shock than Jia Qi. In that exchange of fists, he became extremely clear that Mo Wuji was indeed a Worldly Immortal. A Worldly Immortal could actually match evenly against him; that was simply terrifying. One must know that when they weren’t using skills, it was actually a contest on the use elemental energy.</p><p>\"Kacha…\" At this instant, a fracture appeared below Mo Wuji.</p><p>\"Dao Friend Mo has such a strong sacred art which could divert attacks,\" Pu Zi calmed his elemental energy and said in shock.</p><p>Mo Wuji smiled slightly. He did not explain his sacred art but directly asked, \"I heard from Dao Friend Jia Qi that Master Pu Zi is a peerless smith?\"</p><p>Jia Qi looked at Mo Wuji and finally understood why Mo Wuji would dare say those words previously; he’s really not afraid. In the blink of an eye, he changed the pace of the conversation, snatching the initiative for himself. When she was secretly admiring him, she was also sure that before Mo Wuji entered Half Immortal Domain, he must have been a peak expert of his planet, maybe even the leader.\"</p><p>Pu Zi said proudly, \"That’s right. Below the Immortal Realm, I’m the best among all the smiths.\"</p><p>His tone was filled with self-confidence and pride, without a single hint of modesty.</p><p>After that, he did not even wait for Mo Wuji as he directly brought out a silver ring, \"This is a spatial ring that I forged. The space inside is definitely no less than our usual storage rings.\"</p><p>Thereafter, a blackstone appeared within his hands.</p><p>Mo Wuji’s spiritual will was incredibly strong; he could see clearly that this blackstone had been taken out from the ring. Moreover, this blackstone was the same as the one that he had dug out previously.</p><p>\"I want a ring like this, what’s the price?\" Mo Wuji asked calmly.</p><p>Pu Zi placed the ring on the table, and replied in calm, \"In the future, give me 30% of your blackstone, and you need to find the materials for this ring yourself. Also, you need to agree to one condition.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji stood up, \"Since Master Pu Zi doesn’t wish to discuss this business, then I will take my leave.\"</p><p>\"Dao Friend Mo…\" Seeing Mo Wuji turn and leave, Jia Qi was slightly anxious.</p><p>Pu Zi frowned as well. He now understood why Mo Wuji was so unyielding previously, so Mo Wuji wanted to tell him that they were equal, not some animal for him to control.</p><p>\"Dao Friend Mo, would you reveal the matter of me being able to forge these rings?\" Pu Zi also stood up.</p><p>Mo Wuji stopped and said, \"I won’t reveal it, but I won’t promise you anything.\"</p><p>\"Tell me your conditions,\" Pu Zi said helplessly. Since Mo Wuji could leave unhesitatingly, Pu Zi did not dare take this risk.</p><p>\"Help me forge a ring, and I will help find the materials required to forge it. At the same time, just tell me the compensation you want. As for how many blackstones I make, will have no relations to you.\"</p><p>\"Alright, I want 1,000 blackstones. But you must promise me one condition,\" Even though he had only met with Mo Wuji for a short period of time, Pu Zi was already very clear of Mo Wuji’s personality; Mo Wuji was not a person easily controlled. As for a percentage distribution of blackstone, even if he was much stronger, he would not be able to get Mo Wuji to agree.</p><p>\"Say it then, what’s the condition?\" Mo Wuji’s tone slowed down.</p><p>\"Just now, in your punch, you also integrated some rules of space. I hope that you could inscribe your understandings of space on a jade letter for me,\" After Pu Zi said that, he stared at Mo Wuji. Actually, this condition was the most important thing.</p><p>\"How long will it take to forge the ring?\" Even though the Brief Theory of Space no longer had much value to Mo Wuji, Mo Wuji did not immediately agree to this request.</p><p>\"You need to first help me find some Brilliant Curved Space Gold,\" As he said this, Pu Zi brought out a dim yellow rock the size of a soy bean and handed it to Mo Wuji.</p><p>\"Wait till you find enough Brilliant Curved Space Gold, then give me a year’s time, I can help forge you a storage ring.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji accepted the Brilliant Curved Space Gold and scanned it with his spiritual will, he instantly felt the energy of spatial laws.</p><p>Soon, he passed the Brilliant Curved Space Gold back to Pu Zi, \"Master Pu Zi, I agree to your condition, but I have too conditions of my own.\"</p><p>Hearing Mo Wuji agree, Master Pu Zi instantly became spirited, \"Dao Friend Mo, please speak.\"</p><p>\"One, I won’t wait for a year. You need to give me your storage ring. I will find enough Brilliant Curved Space Gold as compensation. One year later, the ring that you forge will belong to you. Two, I have a ship that has yet to be completed. I need you, in an appropriate time, to help me complete this ship,\" After Mo Wuji finished, he did not speak and waited for Master Pu Zi’s answer.</p><p>\"This is not possible,\" Master Pu Zi directly rejected Mo Wuji’s request.</p><p>This time, Mo Wuji did not turn and leave, but said seriously, \"Master Pu Zi, my understandings of space comes from a jade letter. By reading what was on this jade letter, I was able to interact with space when I was at the True God Stage. You can only imagine how valuable this jade letter is. Honestly, if not for this place, even if you offer 10,000 times of what you’re offering now, I would not give this jade letter to you.\"</p><p>Master Pu Zi did not rebut. Because Mo Wuji’s words were the truth. If not for this place, he wouldn’t be able to use a mere storage ring to exchange for Mo Wuji’s jade letter.</p><p>Seeing the other party hesitate, Mo Wuji added, \"Master Pu Zi, if you think about it. If I reach the Immortal Realm, how many of such rings would you need to give me in order to exchange for this valuable sacred art?\"</p><p>\"Alright, I agree,\" Mo Wuji’s final words tipped Master Pu Zi over. Master Pu Zi was a straightforward person, he agreed to it immediately. He placed all his blackstone in a basket by the side and handed his ring to Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji roughly counted, there were merely over 100 blackstones there.</p><p>After accepting the ring, Mo Wuji sent his spiritual will inwards. There was indeed quite a huge space inside. Thereafter, he retrieved a jade letter and inscribed all the content of the Brief Theory of Space into the jade letter, and passed the jade letter to Master Pu Zi.</p><p>He could feel that this Master Pu Zi was not a cunning person, so he did not hide anything. If it was some other person, he might purposely exclude some pages of the Brief Theory of Space, and only hand it over after his ship was completed.</p><p>[1] Pu Zi could directly be translated to shop, while Jia Qi actually translates to abandoned reeds. Very rarely, do people have names with such meaning.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
