As long as their great clans so wished, one order was undoubtedly enough to uproot all other powers within the Chaotic Demonic Ocean</p><p>But, somebody had killed more than thirty of their clansmen, three among which had even attained half-step King realm. It was simply unforgivable!</p><p>Demonic Humans couldn’t be like humans who were numbered in hundred billions, a million folds higher than the demonic humans. Therefore, no matter how many humans died, it didn’t affect their base number. Adding the fact that demonic humans’ reproductive ability was far lower than humans’, one dead demonic human was one less demonic human, not to mention a half-step King. They were the existences capable of becoming Kings. To lose three of them at once was by no means a small loss.</p><p>Therefore, the experts dispatched by the clan were numerous, far more than any of the previous times. Merely mid Sea of Soul realm cultivation base or above demonic humans numbered around six hundred.</p><p>Six half-step Kings!</p><p>Six hundred Sea of Soul realm experts were divided into three groups, each led by two half-step Kings. In addition, four-winged black demonic insects numbered in millions were also divided into three groups, acting as the demonic humans’ scouts. As soon as they discovered something, the demonic humans would quickly make their way over.</p><p>However, this was still not enough to show how heavily the demonic human clans treated this matter. Apart from Sea of Soul realm experts and half-step Kings, an actual Life and Death King personally took action.</p><p>A Demonic Human King, under the condition of equal cultivation bases, could contend with two human Life and Death Kings.’</p><p>Buzz…</p><p>With the site of incident as the center, packs of four-winged insects took off one after another, and a sky-covering net slowly unfolded. As this sky-covering net took shape, it was truly as the saying went, ‘nowhere left in the world to hide’, unless one could enter the Stunning Sky or Extreme Sky. However, one couldn’t stay in these two skies for long. The Stunning Sky brimmed with pure Yuan Qi of various kinds and made one’s Zhen Yuan deplete at lightning speed. Furthermore, the Extreme Sky was even worse, as the consumption of Zhen Yuan it caused was ten times that of Stunning Sky.</p><p>Blob!</p><p>A cloud of black Qi suddenly appeared above the ocean’s section which was the site of incident. Inside the black Qi was a black-robed slender old man with a deep aura. The slender old man scanned the surroundings, and soon found the remains of a corpse from the seabed. This was a corpse of a demonic human. After being gnawed on by demonic fishes, it was badly mutilated and only left with a few fragments of flesh sticking on the bones. The corpse was pulled up mysteriously, floating before the old man.</p><p>Extending his right hand, the old man suddenly sucked in.</p><p>Tear!</p><p>A minute, almost impossible to hear air-ripping sound rang out. Following the old man’s motion, a strand of indiscernible aura on the corpse shot out.</p><p>The old man carefully held the strand of aura, as if feeling something.</p><p>“Late Sea of Soul realm cultivation, Destruction Sword Intent.” After a few moments, the old man spoke a few words.</p><p>If Ye Chen had been here, he would have been stunned. Not only could this man collect the almost indistinct aura from the corpse, he could even figure out the cultivation base and used sword intent from this aura. These methods were no longer within the scope of half-step Kings.</p><p>To do this, only a Life and Death King had the ability.</p><p>“To kill my demonic human clan’s half-step King with peak late Sea of Soul realm cultivation base…Which power does this person belong to? Could it be the Blood Sword Palace? Not too likely. Although Blood Sword Palace’s young master also has peak Sea of Soul cultivation, I’m afraid he is inferior to this person. Moreover, the destruction sword intent is not his principal sword intent. Apart from him, not many can fight while skipping levels.”</p><p>The black-robed man’s gaze turned deep as he pondered to himself.</p><p>“Doesn’t matter if it’s a man of Blood Sword Palace or not, he will have to pay a sufficient price for killing half-step Kings of my Blood Human Clan.”</p><p>Letting out a breath, the old man’s gaze turned sharp. Unable to handle the pressure, the skeletal remains exploded with a bang and turned into nothingness.</p><p>…</p><p>To attain half-step King realm from late Sea of Soul realm was a major breakthrough and also a whole new beginning.</p><p>Under half-step King realm, the meridians were Zhen Yuan circulating channels. If meridians suffered a damage, the circulation of Zhen Yuan would also become inefficient, greatly lowering one’s battle power. However, upon entering half-step King realm, not only the meridians, but the blood also became a channel to circulate Zhen Yuan. Only Zhen Yuan merging with blood could create a perfect cycle, and that would be regarded as officially entering the realm of half-step King.</p><p>However, accomplishing this feat was exceptionally hard. Without exceptional talent and a will power far surpassing others, half-step King realm was merely one’s wishful thinking. One could only look at it and never touch.</p><p>Merging Zhen Yun with blood was a dangerous process. The slightest inattentiveness could lead to blood rotting, which would greatly lower the body’s functions, making the body’s strength go down to the state of an old man past his prime.</p><p>This was the reason that half-step Kings only appeared in fifth and fourth grade powers. Under fifth ranked powers, one would rarely see a half-step King appear.</p><p>This was because when one attacked half-step King realm in fifth grade sects, even if blood rotting occured, a Life and Death King would be ready to harmonize it. Or, they could spend a large amount of resources and refine a precious pill that could treat the blood rotting. And if the situation was really dire, they could simply perform a large blood substitution.</p><p>In short, with the presence of a Life and Death King, the danger of attacking half-step King was greatly reduced. At worst, if one failed, they could simply wait for their body to recover and try again.</p><p>Of course, this only applied to those who had the ability to attain half-step King realm. If one didn’t even have the ability, then it had nothing to do with them.</p><p>Ye Chen had already consolidated his peak Sea of Soul realm cultivation. In theory, he could attempt the breakthrough. However, without the accumulation of several years, the chances of success wouldn’t be too high. Of course, it was not impossible either.</p><p>In a simple, spacious cave, Ye Chen sat cross-legged on the hard ground in a meditative stance. The Zhen Yuan inside his body flowed out of his dantian and slowly entered his blood. Merging blood and Zhen Yuan, he tried to circulate it.</p><p>There were numerous blood vessels inside the body and many intricacies; it was impossible to merge them one by one. However, even though breaking through half-step King realm was hard, it didn’t require one to merge with all blood vessels at once. As long as one merged with a part and completed a perfect cycle, it would suffice. However, it was a complex and slow process which required high perseverance. A trace of impatience could ruin everything.</p><p>In the beginning, everything went smoothly. Within half a month, Ye Chen steadily improved and moved increasingly nearer to the perfect cycle. However, as time passed, Ye Chen discovered that his progress had turned increasingly slower. In the past few days, he had not progressed even a bit.</p><p>Merging Zhen Yuan with blood actually had a time limit. Once this time limit passed, Zhen Yuan would separate from the blood. Only after a perfect cycle would Zhen Yuan be able to stay with the blood. However, it was extremely difficult to accomplish.</p><p>The blood circulation was not fast, not to mention completing a perfect cycle. Every time half a cycle had completed, Zhen Yuan at the front of blood would begin to separate. Although the Zhen Yuan in rear would continue to merge with blood, it would only maintain an equilibrium.</p><p>“Not possible…Zhen Yuan is not pure enough. The time it can stay inside the blood is too short. If I increase the speed of blood circulation, my heart won’t be able to take it.”</p><p>The reason Ye Chen dared to attempt it was due to his Immortal Body, as a few injuries were nothing to him. However, his Immortal Body couldn’t cover the huge burden on the heart, and at most, could allow a slight overload. After all, the heart was one of the major weak points of the human body. It couldn’t be compared to other regions of the body.</p><p>Huff!</p><p>Opening his eyes, Ye Chen vigorously let out a breath of turbid air and stood up.</p><p>“I wonder how Murong is faring. Her demonic power is extremely pure and fourth-step spirit body stronger than mine. She should have a good chance of entering half-step King realm.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng’s body had the demonic power essence, which was the essence of a King grade demonic power. It had an extraordinary effect when tempering demonic body. At the Devouring Islands, her demonic body had ascended to fourth step from third step, and she could attempt to reach the half-step King realm.</p><p>Shaking his head, Ye Chen left his cave and arrived at an open ground outside.</p><p>“It’s been a while since I obtained the basics of space profound, and my space profound is steadily increasing, nearing the realm of forty percent. The might of Void Shattering Finger has already surpassed Golden Ripple. Unfortunately, Void Shattering Finger is a finger art and has no sword amplification. Moreover, it can’t have variations. If I can create a space profound sword art by relying on these basics, its might will directly catch up to Waning Moon.”</p><p>A profound martial skill must be compatible with the artifact, only then would it display its complete might. To display Void Shattering Finger’s full might, Ye Chen needed to wear a treasured glove. However, he was a sword artist, and wearing a glove would certainly affect his swordplay.</p><p>Creating a space profound sword art had great merits for Ye Chen. Space profound was one of the strongest profounds; its ten percent realm was equivalent to thirty percent of other profounds. Once his space profound reached forty-fifty percent, the might of the space profound sword art he would create would far exceed Waning Moon. Most importantly, space profound sword arts were mysterious, unfathomable, and hard to defend against. Its intimidating power would be far greater than Waning Moon’s.</p><p>Standing in the air, Ye Chen closed his eyes and a scene appeared in his mind—a sword artist was using a sword art which was quite mystical. The sword slashed, and a target that was standing far away was instantly obliterated. The sword was exceptionally quick, creating an effect similar to spatial folding. It was simply impossible to see through the sword’s trajectory at a glance.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>Suddenly, Ye Chen opened his eyes and unsheathed the Thunder Disaster Sword. By relying on his intuition, he issued a total of forty-nine strikes, each strike swifter than the previous one.</p><p>Ye Chen’s movements were the same as the sword artist’s in his mind to every beat. However, the effect created by his sword was inferior to the figure in his mind. The trajectory of his sword only turned instinct and illusory, not creating the spatial folding effect.</p><p>Kacha Kacha Kacha!</p><p>Despite so, the huge rocks in the surroundings shattered like mirrors one after another. The surface under Ye Chen also seemed to have turned into a huge glass; huge cracks covered the surface before it exploded apart. This was not the result of sword Qi but the might of space profound channeled through the sword arts.</p><p>When his space profound reached a certain realm, nobody under Life and Death realm would be able to resist Ye Chen’s sword. After all, at that point, Ye Chen’s sword strike would be equivalent to spatial tearing, and nobody’s defenses under Life and Death realm could resist spatial tearing.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
