How many years has it been? Fifty? One hundred? Or perhaps couple of hundreds years? He had been sleeping for so long, he had not expected to have a human demi king warrior walking into his mouth when when he woke up. After absorbing the flesh and blood essence of this human warrior, he could sense that in the deep part of his body, a powerful power was waking as well and boiling. He knew that he was about to get back to his old peak condition. But of course, there had to be enough of preys.</p><p>“With another three warriors’ blood and flesh, no one under the life and death realm would be able to compete with me.”</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>The black qi shrieked down, the bat king disappeared into the nothingness again.</p><p>…</p><p>On the ground, right next to the entrance of the graveyard.</p><p>“Iron Hand King, what a coincidence meeting you here!” It was a demi beast with a horn on his head. He was the demi beast king from the savage cow royal family Hulk. They were known for their power, even if it was the king race the Sky Tiger race might not be able to compete with them with power.</p><p>Iron Hand King had dealt with Hulk before, he laughed, “Oh it is hulk after all. I thought you savage cow family is not going to send anyone this time.”</p><p>A white gap shoot out from Hulk’s nose. “With the forbidden place appearing, how could we not have done anything? Iron hand King, the situation down there is still unknown, how about we join forces?”</p><p>“Naturally, that would be better. But before that, we need to take care of some troubles as well.” Iron Hand King looked at the skinny elder and the teenager with an evil intent.</p><p>“No need for you to join in, I will take care of them myself.”</p><p>The savage cow family was known for their recklessness and arrogance. And Hulk was no exception.</p><p>“Reckless.”</p><p>The teenager said without an expression.</p><p>“You dare to talk me down?”</p><p>Hulk had sensed the despite from the teenager, more and more steam came out from his nose, his eyes also reddened as well as if they were two beams of red laser light.</p><p>“Wind man, I will play with him. Do not interrupt.” The pattern in between the teenager’s eyes started to flash. The connection between him and the nature increased drastically.</p><p>“Savage Cow Attack!”</p><p>Hulk did not care what the teenager had up his sleeves, as long as he did not feel good, he would kill them for the sake of it. His whole body muscle expended, Hulk threw out a punch at the teenager, the black massive cow started running, a loud moo was heard from his mouth.</p><p>“Five Pattern Palm Attack!”</p><p>Ye Chen had his left hand behind his back as he threw out a palm attack.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Five patterns had been thrown onto the shadow of the massive cow, a massive explosion took place.</p><p>“You do have some power up your sleeves, however, it would not be enough.”</p><p>That white qi that was coming out from his nose was extremely burning, vaguely, one could see sparks here and there as well. Both of his arms shook once, his muscle expended again. Meanwhile, a demon cow shadow appeared out of nowhere. His eyes were big like bells, that aura from him was invincible.</p><p>“Roarrr!”</p><p>Demon Cow shadow f frozen, Hulk’s power increased drastically. It was like he had endless power for him to use. He roared, the whole nature balance seemed to have changed.</p><p>“The physical power alone, you do have enough now. But your family is known for your stupidity, you do not even know how to use your own power.”</p><p>The pattern in between the teenager’s eyes flashed to its brightest. He reached out his right hand, a string of twisted patterns solidified and floated above his palms.</p><p>“The extreme power is power no matter what. Whoever disowned my family will have to pay for their words.”</p><p>That horn on Hulk’s head flashed. After two light sound, two horn shadow shoot out like two massive hammers.</p><p>“Pattern Shield.”</p><p>The teenager used his right hand to make a movement and the pattern around his left hand started to flow, a part of it gathered above his right hand, forming into a shield shape, looking unbreakable.</p><p>Boom! Boom!</p><p>The pattern and the horn disappeared at the same time.</p><p>“Cow demon heaven stump!”</p><p>Hulk shoot out into the sky, both of his hands widely opened. His left hand slightly bended while his right stretched out. He then stumped aggressively at the teenager in front of him. As him doing so, with the teenager being in the center, a massive cow footprint appeared, the air was even heavier than mercury.</p><p>The teenager was not easy to piss off as well. He drew a full circle in the air with his right hand and pushed it up suddenly. Dozens of twisted pattern gathered to make one strange looking spell. He threw it out right at Hulk who was in the air. That heavy air started to leak out once touching the spell.</p><p>Dong!</p><p>It was like a planet hitting the Earth, with one loud sound, another explosion took place between the two. That crazy cow shadow and the twisted pattern clashed together, creating that intense scene before everyone’s eyes.</p><p>“Broken Mountain Iron Hand!”</p><p>It was right then when Iron hand King who did not move at all attacked. He threw out his powerful iron hand palm art immediately. That Iron Hand with the metal shine appeared out of nowhere trying to grab that teenager. Once it got him, no matter what he tried to do, nothing would stop the teenager’s fate of being blood and mud.</p><p>“Do you think I don’t exist?”</p><p>The skinny elder waved his hand, that weapon formed from the tornado wind went through the iron hand. Crack! The iron hand lost five fingers.</p><p>“Oh? Interesting!”</p><p>Iron Hand King looked towards the elder, a seriousness and a hint of surprised was written all over.</p><p>“Cow Stump!”</p><p>Hulk was still fighting the teenager. Waves of vibration spread out, the ground was covered in cracks already.</p><p>“Hulk, stop it.”</p><p>Iron hand king said to Hulk.</p><p>“The battle is not over yet, I will beat him!” His eyes were bright red. He breathed so loudly like an angry cow.</p><p>“Did you forget why you come here?” Iron Hand King knew that it was in their blood to be this emotional and reckless. It would be impossible trying to talk him out of it. All he could do was to let him know the priority.</p><p>Indeed, just like him had expected it, Hulk who was still angry before heard this and started to hesitate. He naturally knew that he had a purpose this time coming here. If he did not finish what the came for, then he could not go back and report.</p><p>“Tian’er!”</p><p>The skinny old man did not want to fight against both the iron hand king and Hulk. At least right now was not the right time.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The teenager stood there and stopped fighting.</p><p>“You two, I don’t believe I have ever seen you before, I wonder what your names are?” Although the skinny elder had not exposed a lot of his real power, but iron hand king had an instinct that he would be extremely powerful.</p><p>“Name is only a label. Now, will you excuse us?”</p><p>He then flashed his body and shoot out into the entrance of the graveyard. The teenager followed behind him.</p><p>Hulk walked right next to the iron hand king, he said evilly, “If they ever got in the way with us, I don’t mind killing them.”</p><p>Iron hand king squinted his eyes. “Do not underestimate them. That old man, is very powerful.”</p><p>…</p><p>Ye Chen and the four did not have good luck. They had flown above the marshland for not that long yet and they had already run into three leader monster of the marshland and one marshland king. Their power was even more powerful than the bat. The normal marshland monster would be at top master level while the leaders would be even more powerful than that. In the master level ranking, they would be able to rank in the top five. And the marshland king’s power would be even more unbelievable. The normal demi king warrior could only be torn apart without no chance fighting back.</p><p>Finally taking care of three marshland leader, Ye Chen and the group realized that they could not get rid of the marshland king.</p><p>The marshland king was different from the normal monster and the leader of the pack. The energy core did not seem like it was in the body. Its body could go in and out of the marshland easily before reappearing some other direction. In another word, unless the four of them could leave the marshland within one second, otherwise they could not escape from the king’s attack.</p><p>“Nirvana Fire!”</p><p>Waited until she reached rank 10, she could accumulate nirvana pullet now, they had only one purpose which was to repair nirvana fire. After swallowing one pellet, Yan Fengfeng had already regained her peak condition. Her wings flapped, those nirvana fire attacked the marshland king.</p><p>Splash!</p><p>Ye Chen’s sword went through the head of the marshland king’s head.</p><p>The last one to attack was Murong Qingchen, she quickly formed a spell and a pile of dark light ball formed right next to the marshland king. It continued spinning and sinking in, absorbing the opponent’s energy. However, the marshland king’s energy seemed to be endless, even after the energy had filled up the light ball, the qi of the beast did not decrease at all.</p><p>“It would be impossible to beat him like that, we have to find the energy core.”</p><p>Qing Liu smashed the marshland king into a pile of med, but after seeing it reformed successfully dozen meters away, she could not help but frowned.</p><p>Ye Chen asked Murong Qingchen since her demon eyes could see through surreal things.</p><p>“I will try!”</p><p>She opened her gold demon eye trying to find a clue.</p><p>After a while, Murong Qingchen shook her head, “No, I cannot find it. Its like it does not even have one.”</p><p>“No? It is impossible.” Qing Liu said certainly.</p><p>Ye Chen said with a low voice, “Once the human reaches Life and death realm, their zhen yuan can be infused into their physical body so that they would have immortal body. Do you think the marshland king has that kind of ability? And that his energy core had infused with the ground?”</p><p>Life and Death Realm king warriors’ immortal body would be slightly different than Ye Chen’s. Since the latter was more like a simple version of that.</p><p>“Immortal body?” Qing Liu seemed to have thought of something, she said surprisingly, “Perhaps he had already learned the king warrior’s level? Impossible! If he had then his power should at least be couple of more times than now. He should be able to kill us instantly.”</p><p>Ye Chen glanced at the marshland, he said, “Senior, it is not impossible, he had battled all this long and it can be certain that the king and the marshland itself must have a lot of connections. Perhaps it is because of the marshland itself? It gives him the immortal body and serves as the source of his energy. As long as he does not leave here then his immortal body should be unbreakable.”</p><p>The immortal body of the Life and Death Realm warrior could be breakable, because each damage would burn a lot of zhen yuan and once the zhen yuan ran out then the immortal body would lose its meaning. However, the energy of the marshland king and the marshland being infused together, then the energy should be endless almost.</p><p>Qing Liu nodded, “Indeed, it is a possibility. However, for us, this was not good news at all. As long as he is in the marshland then he cannot be killed at all. Unless someone can destroy the whole marshland.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
