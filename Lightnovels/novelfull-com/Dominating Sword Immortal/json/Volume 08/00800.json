When Ye Chen was making his breakthrough to Half step King Warrior level, he had indeed trained his Green lotus sword spell to the Heaven Realm.</p><p>Actually, Ye Chen had started to feel that his green lotus sword spell had been restrained for a long time, as if there was an invisible blockage stopping his green lotus sword spell from moving further. Since Battle King had a different experience compared to Ye Chen, and he created his own Heaven Realm martial art when he reached the Life and Death Realm, so Ye Chen did not think too much into it at all.</p><p>But now that he thought about it, it should be due to the special element of Green Lotus Sword Art, since when he got the secret manual before, it mentioned that the Green Lotus Sword Spell and Sword Arts could both be trained to the next realm. Then, he managed to train his green lotus sword arts to a heaven martial art, which was a profound sense martial art, while his green lotus sword spell had no improvement at all.</p><p>“Heaven realm martial arts are indeed the profound sense martial arts. Although the heaven realm movements are quite different from the profound sense, they also contain a similar heaven like power. The heaven realm martial movement created by the Battle King himself was called the white gold sword body, which was amazing in terms of defense. Normal king level warriors could not hurt him at all. So, I wonder what kind of special power my green lotus sword has.”</p><p>Ye Chen was covered in a strong blue qi flow which was extra sharp. With the slightest combination, it turned into an unbreakable sword qi that had the power that could tear apart the sky.</p><p>“Vanish!” Ye Chen let out a low voice as he controlled the blue qi flow around him to scatter out.</p><p>Blue foam textured energy appeared and then spread out with Ye Chen being the center. Looking from afar, he looked like he was in the center of a massive blue cover. Inside the qi cover, the blue qi flow spun without any pattern.</p><p>“Freeze!”</p><p>Ye Chen could not be more familiar with his green lotus sword spell. Even if it had been increased to the heaven realm, he still knew how to perform it vaguely.</p><p>Ting! Ting!</p><p>After countless sword tinging sounds were heard, countless dark blue great swords appeared inside that blue qi cover out of nowhere.</p><p>“Perhaps this is the sword artist realm, the sword field?” Ye Chen looked shocked. “No, it should be the early formation. The real sword field would have its special rules, which would only be controllable by the performer.”</p><p>…</p><p>“Brother, that woman is on that island ahead.”</p><p>A thousand miles away, four human figures appeared out of nowhere, traveling at a high speed. They were a four-eyed massive whale, a double-headed snake, a massive fire bird, and a man with hooked nose standing on top of the bird beast. He was topless and with fish scales, as well as a pair of gray wings on his back. That beast power coming out of it seemed to contain the wind and water elements.</p><p>The man nodded with satisfaction and said to the massive whale, “It would be hard to spot human half step king warriors in the deep ocean, not to mention a beautiful lady. You have done well. Once I have caught that human woman, I will give you a bit more of her belongings.”</p><p>“Thank you, brother!”</p><p>The whale opened its massive mouth. For the ocean beasts, spirit stones were always lacking. Therefore, human warriors would be their favorite preys.</p><p>“We are here!”</p><p>Thousand miles was only a couple blinks of eyes for ocean beasts, so the four beasts soon arrived next to the island.</p><p>“You are back again.” Murong Qingcheng had noticed their arrival already.</p><p>The massive whale chuckled in a strange tone. “I said it before that I will be back, I did not expect you to be this brave and still be here.”</p><p>“With your power, why should I leave?”</p><p>That purple black electricity flashed on the surface of her body. As she talked, that darkness field spread out, covering everything within ten miles.</p><p>“Brother, this woman is so arrogant! Let me teach her a lesson!” The two-headed snake signed himself up.</p><p>The man with a hooked nose glanced at her. In his memory, he had never seen anyone who had gotten even half of her beauty. All of a sudden, a dirty look flashed through his face. He held his jaw with his hand and said to the beast, “Don’t hurt her.”</p><p>“I know the lengths that I should go to.”</p><p>The double-headed snake was not smaller than the four-eyed massive whale. Judging on length, it reached even beyond the four eyed whale. He circled up his body and those two massive heads of its looked down at Murong Qingcheng from above. That long, red tongue kept sticking in and out like two massive long spears.</p><p>“If you surrender now, then you won’t be wounded. But, I have very limited patience.”</p><p>The two headed snake was even more powerful than the whale beast. It learned from the other that this woman’s power might not be as powerful as it, just that her power field might be strange, which had canceled out its ace attack. But, the snake was not worried about it at all, as its power was different from the whale beasts.</p><p>“Cut!”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng did not say an extra word as she jumped up in the air and threw out dozens of attacks at the snake.</p><p>Chin! Chin! Chin! Chin!</p><p>Although her flying assassin attack was only a low rank profound sense martial art, what made it powerful was its speed. With the snake beast being careless, all of the attacks landed accurately on its body, bringing up its scales in the air.</p><p>The snake beast felt the pain and roared into the air. The head on the left side shot out a high-pressure water column toward Murong Qingcheng while the head on the right splashed black venom at her. The former was purely a physical attack which attacked people with an intense force, but the latter was different. Any beast that reached rank 9 or 10 would no longer have a normal venom anymore. It would become the kind of poison that was mixed with Zhen yuan, not to mention the half step beast king’s venom. The second this kind of venom touched a body, it would be very tricky to handle.</p><p>Splash!</p><p>Extending her wings, she flashed to avoid the high pressure water column and black venom, appearing in the sky.</p><p>“Soul Shattering Wave!” Holding onto a black light ball with one palm, she suddenly tightened her grip.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The black light ball had been shattered and a wave of soul attacking energy spread out toward the snake. As a result, the latter screamed before flipping his body around, scrambling along with the ocean water. Although the soul attack could not kill it yet, it had shaken its soul. Moreover, ocean beasts generally had weaker souls than human beings.</p><p>This was the horrifying part of soul attacks.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng grasped the opportunity and threw out another demon race martial art. Her Sky Demon Finger had the finger power of a black sun as it attacked the snake beast.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Black red flames scattered as the massive flame bird beast let out a bloody red fireball in the key moment that clashed with the approaching black sun.</p><p>On the back of the bird beast, the man laughed while clapping. “Not bad, not bad! Four and Two have both got a thousand times more beast power, but they still lost to you. Your power must be ranked in the top amongst the human half step king warriors.”</p><p>Ocean beasts were a kind of beasts, but since they were generally way bigger and had an endless beast power, ten human half step king warriors could barely compete with one half step beast king level ocean beast. But, also because they were so powerful, it would be hard for them to reach half step beast king level. Even though the ocean was massive, there might not be as many ocean beasts that were at the half step beast king level as human warriors.</p><p>“Cut the crap! Bring it on!”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng frowned a little bit. The ocean beasts were indeed more horrifying than the beasts on the land, mainly because of their massive size.</p><p>“Murong, how about I take care of them?”</p><p>The cave on the island exploded as Ye Chen in his blue robes flew over and stood next to Murong Qingcheng in the air.</p><p>“You are the person she was protecting, right? You have just reached half step king warrior level, so what is the point of you even trying with us?” The man glanced at him and noticed his Zhen yuan vibration, which was weaker than Murong Qingcheng’s, which meant that he had not been in the realm for too long.</p><p>“Sword field!”</p><p>Without saying a thing, Ye Chen squinted his eyes a little. The blue light spread out from his body and covered hundreds of miles within the second.</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>The man was already covered within the blue light, so he reached out to make a grabbing gesture. He could feel that the blue qi flow was a bit strange.</p><p>Ye Chen smiled lightly and reached out his right hand as he made a pushing gesture toward the four gently.</p><p>Sho! Sho! Sho! Sho! Sho!</p><p>Without a sign, the blue qi flow accumulated into blue great swords, with each of them containing the rank 5 destruction sword intent, or perhaps rank 5 immortal sword intent, or even just normal attacking power. They could compete with his normal attack, but due to the excessive amount, it contained a fatal attacking power.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of blue colored great swords shot out at high speed, covering the four beasts completely.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>The man did not dare to be reckless as he released a circle of beast power, Meanwhile, the other three beasts also activated their beast power, trying to block out the blue swords’ attack.</p><p>There were too many blue great swords, seeming like a tornado. This kind of effect was like hundreds of thousands of powerful Sea of Souls Realm warriors attacking at the same time. There was no doubt that it had gotten to the four beasts and started to weaken their defense rapidly.</p><p>“Oh my god! Fall back!”</p><p>The man was frightened, as his protective beast power could not handle this many blue great sword attack. It was not them ganging up on him, more like hundreds of thousands of warriors attacking the four. They were not ocean beast kings yet, so they could not ignore this level of attack.</p><p>The first attacked was the four-eyed whale who had the biggest body, so it faced most of the attacks.</p><p>Pooh! Pooh! Pooh!</p><p>The whale was now like a ruined piece of meat full of bloody holes. The area it was in had been separated into different parts, which could not get back together at once.</p><p>Then there was the two-headed snake, whose ending was not better than the whale beast.</p><p>The flame bird was the fastest, so it carried the man on the back as it rushed out of the attacked area at light speed. Those red feathers of its had almost been plucked out completely by the blue great swords. The good thing was that they were at the edge of the whole attacking area and had a fast speed. So, they were not killed on sight.</p><p>“Do you think you can make it?” Ye Chen took out his Evil shattering sword and threw out a Waning Moon Attack.</p><p>The black colored moon shape sword power was even brighter than the full moon in the sky as it flew through that bird beast.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>Just like that, the bird beast and that man on the back were sliced within a split second.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
