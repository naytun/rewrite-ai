There were high rank ones in the school too, but they were very limited. Each one of them meant so much for the school, and they could even be considered the most valuable assets of the school. Normal warriors could not even get close to the trees.</p><p>In their sight, a massive tree stood before them with plenty of blue fruits growing on top. It was so massive that the tree almost covered up the whole sky. The whole tree took up a couple of miles of ground, which made everything around it look so tiny. If they had the time, they could very well build a whole village here and live.</p><p>“It is a high rank water yuan fruit tree. It is so effective for wound healing that it would not be worse than normal top rank pellets. This top rank tree would have at least thousands of fruits, which would value more than one billion top rank spirit stones.”</p><p>Qing Liu could not breathe normally anymore.</p><p>“Senior, congratulations!”</p><p>Ye Chen forced a laugh. This tree was too massive for his ring to hold it. It would be indeed impossible for him to take it even if he wanted it so badly.</p><p>“Hehe, I will not say no to this for sure.”</p><p>Qing Liu cleared out her ring and threw out some of the ‘not-so-important’ spirit trees before activating her Zhen yuan and making a grabbing gesture. That massive tree was pulled up a lot before it slowly entered her ring and disappeared completely.</p><p>As she finally got the tree in her hands, she seemed to be in a great mood. She plucked five fruits and handed them over to Ye Chen and the rest of them each, “The fruits have great effects on healing wounds as well as recovering strength. They also taste delicious and are full of juice. Everyone, have a taste!”</p><p>As she spoke, she took a bite herself.</p><p>Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng took over the palm sized fruit and took a bite themselves, “So sweet!” Murong Qingcheng complimented.</p><p>“Indeed, and it is not too rich either!” Ye Chen nodded. The fruit almost melted completely once it entered their mouths, turning into fresh liquid and pouring down into their stomachs. It then spread out toward all parts of their internal organs and limbs. He could feel his whole body waking up, and that tiredness he felt before disappeared completely.</p><p>Qing Liu chuckled, “Although we have not gotten to the graveyard yet, one fruit tree is already rather satisfying a gain. It is definitely making this trip worth the effort. Ye Chen, Murong, next time, you guys have to come to our school to visit. I will provide you with more of these fruits.”</p><p>The reason that she was able to find this tree in the first place was because of Ye Chen and his great observation. Otherwise, it would be impossible to find it, since the whole place was so massive. The fruits were so valuable on their own, but they would grow back once consumed. On the other hand, once the tree was gone, nothing more would grow back out.</p><p>“Senior, don’t worry! We will drop by to pay visits for sure.”</p><p>Ye Chen did not have any regrets either, since he could not have fit the massive tree in his ring anyways.</p><p>Perhaps the universe was trying to make it right, as Ye Chen found another high rank spirit tree after the five had flown for another thousands of meters. It was not as big as the one from before; it was only a hundred meters tall, and only covered one mile of ground, which would be perfect for the low rank plant ring.</p><p>Qing Liu said, “High rank Fire Pear Tree! Ye Chen, you are indeed rather lucky! Although it is not as old as the last tree, it still has a couple thousand years in its background. Furthermore, it is perfectly fitting for your plant ring. The tree also carries the fire element, and the fire pear it grows would not only be great for warriors who train fire element Zhen yuan, but also it would purify the bodies and increase the physical strength. Oh, right! The tree is also super rare, as it would not only work on human warriors, but also on other warriors from other beast races. For example, Murong’s perfect half step demon bloodline would not be limited here either.”</p><p>Qing Liu had already gotten the fruit tree, so it would not be her if she tried to fight for this one as well.</p><p>“Indeed lucky!”</p><p>Ye Chen looked at the pears that looked like red crystals and nodded satisfyingly. Purifying the physical bodies and increasing physical strength would be similar in effect as the spirit power crystal stones. Even if its effects were not as severe, he could use its quantity to fill in for that. There must be at least one to two thousand pears on that tree.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Activating his Zhen yuan, Ye Chen was about to move the tree when…</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>All of a sudden, a hysterical cry was heard out of nowhere from a hundred miles away. Two human figures were shooting toward their direction at a fast speed. They were two half step king warriors.</p><p>Ye Chen frowned slightly, but he would not slow down his movement at all. As a result, he successfully put the tree into the plant ring before planting a huge amount of top rank spirit stones in the soil as well. After that, he still had time to put up some fully-charged sun stones on top, giving the sunshine that the tree needed.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Seeing the tree disappear, the two did not even say a word before they started to attack Ye Chen at the same time.</p><p>“Who are you!” Qing Liu yelled angrily.</p><p>Shoo! Shoo!</p><p>The two figure stood dozens miles away; one of them were extremely tall but with dull expression. His skin did not look human, but more like trees as it was really rough. Meanwhile, the other was extra small and skinny; his pointy mouth and tiny eyes shone with an evil light.</p><p>“Half step beast king!”</p><p>Qing Liu could tell on the spot that the incoming two were not humans; they were beings from other races. The dull looking middle-aged man was indeed a half step beast tree king while the short elder was a half step beast king from the mouse race, which would make him extra evil and tricky to take on.</p><p>Putting away the tree, Ye Chen turned around to look at the two, and could not help but frown a little. The two half step beast kings were not nobodies; one of them already put a huge pressure on them, let alone the fact that there were two of them here.</p><p>“Be careful!” Ye Chen secretly passed on a message to Murong Qingcheng. It would be impossible for him to give up the tree now, since they were not some weak fishes that were doomed to be killed.</p><p>“Don’t worry about me!” Murong Qingcheng nodded.</p><p>“Two misters, you guys attacked us for no apparent reasons. It is a bit rude, isn’t it?” Qing Liu did not want to battle with two half step beast kings, so she controlled her temper and tried to make a conversation with them.</p><p>The short elder said with a cold laugh, “Put down the tree and we will let you go. Otherwise, do not blame us for being not too nice with you guys!”</p><p>“You guys plan to rob us?” Qing Liu squinted her eyes.</p><p>“Hand over the tree, then naturally we will not fight for it.” While the short elder was talking, he was also studying the five standing in front of him. He realized that although there were quite a lot of them compared to the others, there were only one half step king warrior, and two peak level Late Seas of Souls Realm warriors. There was also a rank 10 beast in human female body shape.</p><p>“Apologies, but I cannot do that.”</p><p>Qing Liu’s voice lowered; she was a half step king warrior, so she had her principles. She knew that if she lost, then she would have to hand over the tree. In that case. what would people like Ye Chen think of her? They would think of her as a pussy cat with no principles.</p><p>“If you do not hand it over, then only death will be waiting for you.”</p><p>The evil light inside the short elder could almost form into solid objects. With the slightest stare, the receiver could feel a creeping sensation crawling down his or her spine.</p><p>“You?” Qing Liu was pissed off as well.</p><p>“Ghost Wood King, I will leave the four for you. It should be fine, right?” The elder turned around and looked at the massive middle-aged man with a dull expression on his face. The latter answered, “You got it.” The elder then turned around and looked at Qing Liu as he said, “I have not killed a half step human king warrior in a long time. You have such soft and shiny skin…You might be eaten.”</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>Just as he finished talking, the elder disappeared right where he was standing as he jumped toward Qing Liu in the midair. He was so still and then he was moving so fast; the sudden change had been hard for people to follow.</p><p>“You guys protect yourselves!”</p><p>Qing Liu would not dare to underestimate the opponents, so she left that one message before approaching the elder.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>One of them was a half step beast warrior while the other a human warrior. They had similar cultivation bases, and their qi continued clashing violently. As a result, the surrounding trees were pulled down, and even the ground was turned upside down.</p><p>“Haha, you are indeed powerful! But unfortunately, you are not fast enough.” The elder’s body flashed repeatedly as he turned into beams of black shadows and attacked Qing Liu. The latter had never expected the elder to be so fast. As a result, she was caught off guard a bit. Meanwhile, some of her attacks were avoided smartly by the elder, which was a very frustrating feeling.</p><p>“I will fight him for a bit.” Ye Chen stretched and took a step forward.</p><p>“You? Not good enough!” The middle-aged man shook his head.</p><p>“We will see about that.”</p><p>Ye Chen had never fought against a half step king warrior yet. And the same was for half step beast kings. He wanted to see exactly how powerful they were.</p><p>“Alright. I can only get to the fire pear tree after killing you anyway.”</p><p>The middle-aged man’s pupils shone with a yellow-green light as a creepy black qi appeared around his body. All of a sudden, the man turned from a dull looking human form into an evil haunting ghost.</p><p>Ting!</p><p>Ye Chen did not dare to underestimate the situation as five beams of sword light appeared out of nowhere. They then accumulated behind his body, forming into sword wings.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>The sword light sliced through the sky as Ye Chen was the first one to attack.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The middle aged man threw out a fist attack toward the right where Ye Chen’s body happened to appear.</p><p>“That accurate observation?” Ye Chen was slightly surprised. His body flashed once, avoiding the fist power.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A huge area of trees dried off and was covered by a black qi. The middle-aged man’s punch was quite different, having the effect of reaping lives.</p><p>The middle-aged man saw Ye Chen avoid this fist attack and seemed to be surprised. His title was the Ghost Wood King, and he was a half step beast king cultivated from a ghost wood. The ghost wood itself was of yin element; wherever it grew, the plants would dry out and die, and all of life would be sucked out. Therefore, the ghost wood king was very sensitive to life and vitality. No matter what the opponents wanted to do, it would not get away under his eyes. Although Ye Chen’s speed was surprisingly fast, in his eyes, his vitality would be the most visible thing.</p><p>“Ghost Wood King, do not play around with this brat. This bit*h is a bit tricky to handle.” The elder had gotten the upper hand from the beginning of the battle, but he had underestimated Qing Liu, who was the former leader of the Mysterious School after all. It did not take long before she regained the control of the battle.</p><p>“I will take care of him in three attacks.”</p><p>The Ghost wood king saw that the elder was struggling a bit, and his cold creepy eyes locked onto Ye Chen while that black qi on his body darkened.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
