With the slight activation of her demon power, the sky around the islands would darken, and demon wind would start to blow as if one had entered the world of darkness. With Ye Chen’s estimation, Murong Qingcheng now would probably be at mid half step king warrior level, and the lady in yellow was indeed at the high level.</p><p>This was the difference between having demon crystal and not having one.</p><p>With Murong Qingcheng being there, Ye Chen could let go of his guard and focus on his breakthrough. In the wide empty cave, he sat in the middle on a stone platform as he entered a deep, focused state.</p><p>Pop! Pop!</p><p>With his semi-conscious control, Ye Chen’s Zhen yuan inside his dantian started to spin firmly and slowly. Strings of Zhen yuan poured out of it into his veins. With blood pumping in his veins, he started to push for the half step king warrior level.</p><p>The veins in human body were countless. Besides the hair, nails, teeth, as well as skin, veins covered the entire body. Since the blood veins could be separated into three different veins according to different functions, so he would naturally not need to infuse all three different blood veins with his Zhen yuan. As long as he could make a full cycle with the blood inside his arteries, then it would be done.</p><p>His blood started to speed up, and he could feel his pulse increasing in his chest. It was like a tightened fist that was quite firm as the pounding sound continued, the air vibrating and spreading out along with it.</p><p>“Alright, it is smoother than the first time!”</p><p>Feeling his heart getting stronger and stronger, Ye Chen felt more confident. With his mind control, the blood flow increased again, reaching an unbelievable level.</p><p>However, just in case, he still swallowed a spirit melting plant which could increase the duration of Zhen yuan and blood fusion. As long as he had enough spirit melting plants, he would not even need the heart protecting flower or heart nourishing plant to reach the half step king warrior level. Unfortunately, the former was not like weed grass that grew everywhere, and he only managed to find two in the Four Square City.</p><p>With everything ready, Ye Chen could feel that he was getting close to the half step king warrior level this time.</p><p>As he tried to make a breakthrough, it was not all peaceful outside.</p><p>In the scrambling ocean water, a castle-sized skull appeared out of nowhere. It was a massive whale with four small-lake-sized eyes. Two of them were blue that shone with a hint of electricity while the two eyes in the middle were blood red, which was rather horrifying to look at.</p><p>It was a half step beast king level four-eyed Thunder Whale, the biggest kind. According to the rumors, the biggest four eyed thunder whale was the size of a city. With one bite, it could swallow the whole city and everything within.</p><p>Its enormous body meant that it had an immense beast power. The second it appeared, it became completely silent within hundreds of miles. Even splashes of ocean water stopped in the mid air, and wind stopped blowing. All living beings froze exactly where they were.</p><p>“You weak human, hand over everything you own…Now!” The four-eyed thunder whale let out a low voice at Murong Qingcheng, who was standing on a tall rock. She reached out her hand to rearrange her messed-up hair and said quietly, “Cut the crap! You are lucky to be here at the perfect timing. I will use you as an experiment.”</p><p>With her increased cultivation, she happened to need an object to test out her newly-gained power. The four-eyed whale was a massive creature which could be a great opponent.</p><p>“You are looking for death!”</p><p>The whale was furious, so it opened its mouth and a massive water column shot toward Murong Qingcheng, who seemed tiny in comparison. No matter what, she did not dare to underestimate her opponent as she reached out her right hand and blocked it in front of her.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A semi-circular black barrier appeared in front of her, protecting half of the island. A couple hundreds of tall water columns clashed on top, bringing up sky-high splashes. At the same time, that arm-wide electric pulse could not break through the barrier at all, not to mention wounding Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>It was the darkness profound martial art, the darkness sky barrier.</p><p>“Die now!”</p><p>For ocean beasts, the most powerful attacks were not energy attacks, but physical attacks instead. Suddenly, that mountain-like four-eyed Thunder Whale jumped up in the air. The whole sky dimmed down, and the entire island was covered by its shadow.</p><p>Whoosh! Falling from the sky, the Thunder Whale was covered in electricity as it slammed toward Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>“Darkness Devour!”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng was afraid that her battle would affect Ye Chen, so she quickly formed a spell and waved it in midair quickly.</p><p>All of a sudden, four darkness powered energy balls formed in the air and lined up in a row. They continued to spin and shriek as if they were four miniature black holes.</p><p>The second the four-eyed Thunder Whales touched the light balls, it suddenly could feel its power decreasing. Its beast power was drained like water and sucked into them.</p><p>“Piss off!”</p><p>Her tall slim body jumped up into the air as she threw out a palm attack toward his forehead. That powerful demon power exploded, blowing the whale dozens of miles away. The shockwave created a wide gap in the sky.</p><p>“Such rich beast power.”</p><p>The second her palm and the thunder whale clashed, she could feel that the beast’s power was not decreased that drastically. Ever since she reached half step king warrior level, the devouring power of her darkness devour attack had increased more than ten times. Even if it were a half step king warrior, he or she would lose one-tenth of his or her power for sure. If they were hit, then their Zhen yuan would be devoured completely without even battling.</p><p>However, the Thunder Whale seemed to have an endless beast power, as four darkness devour attacks only devoured one-tenth of its beast power at most. The effect was almost ignorable.</p><p>“Group Whale Dance!”</p><p>As the half step beast king, the Thunder Whale would definitely have more attacks up his sleeve. That thunder light around his body shone brighter and brighter, and hundreds of massive whales made with ocean water appeared. These massive whales were not one-hundredth as big as the four-eyed thunder whale, but with these many of them covered in thunder and making a loud noise, it was a horrifying scene to witness.</p><p>Hundreds of massive whales broke through the wind and swam toward Murong Qingcheng. She looked the same as beams of purple black electricity flew through her veins while an invisible power field spread out rapidly with her being the center. All of a sudden, it reached the hundreds of massive whales. Under the effect of that power field, the whales would have to handle ten times more pressure with each step forward. Before they could get to the island, they started to shatter one by one back to ocean water.</p><p>“What kind of power field is this?”</p><p>The thunder whale squinted its eyes. Normal power fields would not have such an effect at all. His attack was one of the top killing attacks, but it was not even able to get to her at all. It was not hard to imagine the girl’s power.</p><p>“I will be back.”</p><p>The thunder whale sank back into the bottom of the ocean, and that mountain like body disappeared completely.</p><p>Landing back on a rock lightly, Murong Qingcheng frowned, “Sea beasts are always massive and with endless beast power. Wanting to kill them would not be something easy, unless I can break through their defense layer with one attack and also hit their cores.”</p><p>With that palm attack, she had already managed to hurt the thunder whale. But obviously, with that massive body, it would not be severe enough of an attack for it. It was not even enough to let the beast feel pain. It was not for nothing that these ocean beasts were called moving castles.</p><p>Guarding the island, she stood still, letting her soul power out and monitoring everything around.</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the island…</p><p>Ye Chen was reaching a critical moment. His blood carried his zhen yuan as it was making perfect cycles. He was only one step away from a breakthrough, and it was indeed the most critical step.</p><p>Taking out the second plant, which was also the last spirit melting plant, Ye Chen swallowed it without hesitation. All of a sudden, a wave of sticky but cooling medicinal effect filtering through the veins, allowing the blood and Zhen yuan to fuse together perfectly.</p><p>“This is it. Everything has come to this moment.”</p><p>Ye Chen made a thought and his blood flow increased its speed. He was reaching his heart’s limit as that pounding sound was continuously heard.</p><p>“Almost there!”</p><p>“Almost there!”</p><p>Ye Chen was surrounded in hot steam, amidst which was a hint of red light. It was a sign of water being overly vaporized.</p><p>Looking internally, Ye Chen could see the insides of his arteries. His blood and Zhen yuan had already managed to run a perfect cycle. There was only that last bit left, but it was indeed that last bit which was the critical part that decided whether he could make it or not.</p><p>“Let me break through!”</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Ye Chen pushed his blood flow to its limit. His heart was slightly damaged, and some of the tiny veins around it were shattered as well.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>It was right then that a wave of powerful Zhen yuan vibration spread out. The sky was covered in dark clouds and rain poured down while lightning and thunder fell down rapidly. It was the nature reacting to these unnatural changes.</p><p>Ting!</p><p>All of a sudden, a massive beam of sword qi shot upwards through the clouds, tearing apart the sky.</p><p>“He made it! This sword qi…?”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng turned her head, full of joy. Without a doubt, from this second, Ye Chen had officially become a half step king warrior. However, this horrifying sword qi was completely different from before.</p><p>A thinking expression appeared on her face. Ye Chen had trained the Green Lotus Sword Spell, which was a top rank Earth Realm martial art. There were heaven realm martial arts as well, but they were not something that everyone could train. Although it had something to do with comprehensive abilities, it would not be a direct relationship at all. It actually had more to do with Zhen yuan and cultivation.</p><p>Normally, only Life and Death Realm warriors could create their own Heaven Realm martial arts, which would take a long period of time. If lucky, it might take decades, but it might take hundreds of years as well. Below the Life and Death Realm, even with the highest comprehensive ability, one would not be able to create heaven realm martial arts at all, since warriors below Life and Death Realm would not be able to support heaven realm martial arts with their Zhen yuan level. So naturally, they would not be able to create one.</p><p>However, there was an exception. Some of the Earth realm top rank martial arts could increase their rankings. For example, the Green Lotus Sword Spell would be one of them, as the sword spell itself was at the top of the Earth Realm martial arts. Once increased, it would become a Heaven Realm martial art.</p><p>Facing this drastic change, Murong Qingcheng could not think of another possibility.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
