But once they entered, they realized that where they landed was nothing like what they had seen. It was obvious that those things they saw was a result of spatial reflection. They did not know where they were inside the forbidden space really.</p><p>It was an endless meadow. Heavy winds blew about, making sharp air-slicing noises.</p><p>\"Be careful! We are inside a spell.\"</p><p>Qing Liu had seen the most out of all of them. It was easy for her to tell that there was a huge spell covering the whole place, and there were countless minor spells within the massive one as well. Because of the fact that the spell level was very high and had already infused with the nature, people without great observation and experience would not be able to tell.</p><p>\"It should be the simulation spell!\" Ye Chen nodded.</p><p>\"Hm? You know about this?\" Qing Liu looked at Ye Chen with surprise. The fact that he knew about the spell was already impressive, but he not only knew that there was one, he even knew about the type of the spell.</p><p>There were a lot of spells. One of them was called the simulation spell that could use the power of the spell to create all types of creatures such as human, beasts, demons or some kind of rare legendary creatures. These formed creatures' power would be influenced by the level of the spell. The higher the level, the more powerful they would be. The powerful spell could simulate even Life and Death Realm level creatures to kill a real Life and Death Realm warrior.</p><p>\"I only know a little.\" He tried to fool her off.</p><p>His soul power was five times more powerful than normal people, and its quality would at be the level of Life and Death Realm warriors. He naturally could sense that there was spell on the grassland. As for the reason that he was able to tell the type of spell was because there was related information from the memory he got from the Battle King. All he needed to do was to try slightly to think, and he could get the information from that.</p><p>\"Alright then, let's go!\" She controlled her emotion and said to the four.</p><p>\"Yes, teacher!\" Yan Fengfeng was not surprised at all. She had sensed it a long time ago that there were a lot of secrets inside Ye Chen.</p><p>After walking for a while, the five saw a gray stone tomb with four massive characters—Grey Wolf Grassland Place.</p><p>Qing Liu said, \"If I have guessed it right, then this should be the Grey Wolf Spell created by the Four Extreme Emperor. It can simulate gray wolf beasts. Everyone, be careful, alright?\"</p><p>After they walked on for a bit, the wind started blowing stronger and stronger.</p><p>Awoooo!</p><p>In the distance were seven adult elephant-sized massive wolves running toward them. They had extremely long hair which were blown into the air like gray flames burning in the air. Their eyes were bright and brutal, a bloody red hue shining within.</p><p>The first wolf that jumped at them threw out his claws, the light from which covered all five of them within. Its battling power was intense, and no weaker than normal Sea of Souls Realm master level warriors.</p><p>\"Die!\"</p><p>Qing Liu looked like she was just drinking a cup of tea as she waved out her right hand and threw out a palm attack. That condensed palm energy seemed like a crystal as it went through the grassland with the wolves within. All of the incoming wolves were shattered by the horrifying power, and a deep dent appeared on the ground as well.</p><p>Half step King warrior's Zhen yuan level was indeed crazy. Ye Chen had finally seen the power of a true semi king warrior. Not to mention anything else, just the Zhen yuan was nothing that peak level Late Sea of Souls Realm warriors could compete with. They would be able to solidify their Zhen yuan and increase its density by more than five times.</p><p>Besides that, Ye Chen realized that the space within the forbidden place was ten times more stable than the space outside. Normally when they were outside, Sea of Souls realm warriors' attack could twist the space already. But within the forbidden place, Qing Liu could not even shake the space at all.</p><p>Qing Liu could also sense the stability of the space as she frowned slightly.</p><p>The five of them flew on top of the meadow, and those wolves were shattered before they could even get close.</p><p>But obviously, the powerful feature of the spell was just revealing itself. All they could see were countless dark shadows moving toward them at the end of the horizon, seeming like the black ocean water. Once they got close enough, it was apparent that those were countless massive gray wolves. Looking at it roughly, there were at least eight hundred wolves there. That powerful beast power had darkened the meadow; all they could see were countless bright red eyes that reminded them of ghosts.</p><p>\"Everyone, be careful! Try not to be too far away from each other.\"</p><p>Even Qing Liu would not dare to underestimate the situation. These gray wolves did not have long range attacks, and seemed to only be able to fight up close. However, with more than a thousand of them jumping on them at the same time, no one would dare to underestimate the situation.</p><p>\"Mysterious Spell!\"</p><p>The gray wolves could not throw out long ranged attacks, but Qing Liu could. She formed a spell quickly with both of her hands and a surprising Zhen yuan vibration spread out.</p><p>\"Now!\"</p><p>After the formation, Qing Liu pushed her hands toward the wolf pack.</p><p>Pap!</p><p>There was no shockingly loud explosion sound, but a strange looking palm print appeared in the moving wolf pack which covered hundreds of meters of ground. At least dozens of gray wolves had been killed by this palm attack. That record would make her a top warrior even amongst the semi king warriors.</p><p>\"Major Phoenix Cut!\"</p><p>\"Bright Sky Punch!\"</p><p>Yan Fengfeng and the elder of the mountain Lin Gaoming also threw out their best attacks, killing seven or eight wolves each, which was not even one-thirds of what Qing Liu had done.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng then used her Darkness Devour and killed seven wolves as well. Her attack was still far from full completion, but it was already not much weaker than Yan Fengfeng and Lin Gaoming's attacks. Once it reached full completion, its power could not be underestimated.</p><p>\"Thunder Devour!\"</p><p>Ye Chen used his Zhen yuan and formed a massive black thunder ball, which then shot out violently. It exploded amongst the wolves, killing two dozen wolves instantly.</p><p>\"Indeed an invincible top warrior right under the semi king warriors.\" Qing Liu glanced at Ye Chen, surprised again.</p><p>The wolves were running at an extremely fast speed. After two rounds of attacks, the wolves finally made it to right in front of the five, surrounding them.</p><p>Awoo! Awoo!</p><p>That sharp wolf roar was heard as all of the wolves started their aggressive attack toward the five. The attacking power was extremely potent.</p><p>\"Kill!\"</p><p>There were still eight hundred remaining gray wolves. Qing Liu reached out immediately, throwing out her top attacks again. Wherever her attacks reached, the wolves shattered immediately.</p><p>Ye Chen and the other three had formed into a circle as they attacked the wolves, since it would be harder to handle so many opponents at the same time, not to mention there were eight hundred of them this time.</p><p>Even so, there were still way too many wolves out there. They were all at master level as well, so it would be impossible to avoid all of their attacks. Not to just mention the four, even Qing Liu had been attacked by the wolves. It was just because of her extremely powerful protective Zhen yuan layer that those attacks meant nothing for her. On the contrary, those wolves that attacked her were blown away by the aftershocks, hitting the other wolves.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Ye Chen had been hit dozens of times already, his protective Zhen yuan on the verge of shattering. Meanwhile, the other three were in an even worse situation, their faces starting to become pale.</p><p>\"Not good! There are just way too many of them. If continued, we will be badly wounded even if we can kill all of them, which will not be good for our future battles.\"</p><p>With that thought in mind, Ye Chen did not plan to hold back anymore.</p><p>\"Three Sword Attack!\"</p><p>Ye Chen used his sword finger and made a gesture, as that gold sword of his came out on its own. It then split into three beams of gold light before shooting out like beams of lightning.</p><p>Pooh! Pooh! Pooh! Pooh! Pooh!</p><p>It was like cutting grasses as countless wolves were killed. Before, Ye Chen had only killed about two-thirds of Qing Liu's record, but now, he was obviously doing better. It did not necessarily mean that his power had reached above the latter; it only meant that his Defensive sword control spell was just too powerful. It was nothing like normal attacks which would require a little bit of time between attacks. The sword control spell used soul power to operate, which did not need time to regenerate at all. Wherever he went, the sword would go and attack.</p><p>\"This! It is the Defensive sword control spell!\"</p><p>Qing Liu's pupils shrank. This big a commotion would be impossible for her not to notice. Ye Chen's opponent killing speed was too unbelievable. The normal Defensive sword spell would not be this powerful at all. Even if she were the most stupid person on earth, she would know that he specialized in soul power, which explained why the spell was drastically more powerful in his hands.</p><p>Five hundred!</p><p>Three hundred!</p><p>One hundred!</p><p>Soon, eight hundred wolves were killed, and only one hundred remained. The density of the wolves had decreased as well. So, Murong Qingcheng and the other two warriors' pressure was relieved a bit as well.</p><p>\"Landing Spell!\"</p><p>At that moment, Qing Liu formed another spell. In the air, a hundred meters wide crystal palm print appeared out of nowhere. The second it landed, the ground nearby vibrated as well. A circle of blast waves spread out everywhere, and half of the one hundred wolves were killed instantly.</p><p>The remaining wolves were easier to handle, being shattered one after another.</p><p>Waiting until all of the wolves had been destroyed, Qing Liu let out a breath and said to Ye Chen with a big smile on her face, \"With your power, normal semi king warriors would not be a threat to you anymore. This trip might be dependent on you after all.\"</p><p>When they encountered a powerful enemy, Qing Liu would be distracted by the opponent for sure, and would no longer be able to protect them anymore. But with Ye Chen there, it would be much easier. In fact, no one under the semi king warrior realm could threaten him at all. Even normal semi king warriors could not kill him easily.</p><p>\"I will try my best.\" Ye Chen nodded.</p><p>Having finished their battle, the five continued traveling.</p><p>…</p><p>There was a massive land of lava in front of the meadow, and the whole world here was burning red. There would be burning lava shooting out for the sky constantly.</p><p>Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!</p><p>In the sky, a horrifying bird chirp could be heard as countless massive flame birds jumped toward the elder and the young man with that symbol on his forehead.</p><p>The two's faces blushed slightly. Although there was no critical danger really, it was not an easy situation either. These birds were more powerful than the wolves, as well as faster. When they jumped out, they were moving even faster than lightning. If it were not for the fact that the two were extremely powerful, they might have been killed by now.</p><p>\"Five Symbol Palm Attack!\"</p><p>The symbols outside the young man's body blocked away the incoming attacks while he used his Zhen yuan to throw out a palm attack.</p><p>Pap! Pap! Pop! Pop!</p><p>The five twisting symbols were thrown out and the fire birds were crushed by them, which shattered their bodies. Following that, the flame burned them into ashes. The young man's flame was burning even more powerful than their flames.</p><p>\"Tornado Wind Tooth!\"</p><p>On his side, the skinny elder was even more powerful. He reached out and made a grabbing gesture, causing an aggressive tornado wind to appear out of nowhere. Within the wind, countless wind blades appeared out of nowhere, clearing out the sky and killing countless fire birds.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
