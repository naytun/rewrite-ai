Just do the best you can.” Yan Fengfeng was worried that Ye Chen would be wounded, so she reminded him.</p><p>That sword wings opened slightly on his back slightly as he said, “If I cannot hold on, I will call you. Right now, let me test his limits.”</p><p>Ye Chen did not plan to beat the Ghost Wood King. He just wanted to test exactly how powerful this half step beast king was, so that he could have a benchmark to compare with in the future when he ran into another one. Secondly, he also wanted to let Murong and Yan Fengfeng know his tricks, so that when he ran out of energy, the four of them could link up together and enhance their general battling power. He was confident that even if he could not take down the Ghost Wood King, he would be able to leave without a scratch.</p><p>“Do not bother to try. You will die in my hands for sure.” The Ghost Wood King, of course, knew what Ye Chen was thinking, but he did not care for it at all, since there would not be anything more hilarious than an ant saying that it wanted to test the elephant’s power.</p><p>“I doubt it though.”</p><p>Ye Chen slowly took out his Thunder Disaster sword as the sword light continued to flash.</p><p>“Wait until you die, then you will know that I am always telling the truth. The first attack!” The beast king did not have the patience to chat with Ye Chen as that black qi around his body expanded suddenly.</p><p>Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! An air slicing sound was heard as countless black veins appeared amongst the black qi out of nowhere, attacking toward Ye Chen.</p><p>“Thunder Devour!”</p><p>He stepped in midair while using the power to back out. Meanwhile, he held his sword with both of his hands and threw out an attack. Next, that black thunder ball attacked toward the middle of the veins.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The sky was filled with tempestuous thunder and lightning. After the thunder ball exploded, the shockwave spread out and shattered the veins. Meanwhile, that aggressive thunder power followed the veins and attacked toward the real body of the beast king.</p><p>The latter looked exactly the same, as he did nothing except watch the power approach him. However, something strange happened. That aggressive thunder power suddenly became slower the closer it got to the body of the beast king, seeming to have lost all of its power.</p><p>“The vitality has been sucked out?”</p><p>Ye Chen was surprised. Although thunder power was only one of the elemental powers, it still had its own vitality, which was slightly different from the normal one. For example, a dried out massive tree would not have new leaves coming out for years, as there would be no vitality at all. But one day, a thunder would fall down and the dried out tree would suddenly be infused with new power, causing new leaves to grow out. It meant that the thunder and lightning could not only reactivate the vitality of the dried out tree, it also brought nourishment for the tree as well.</p><p>The ghost wood king had abstracted the vitality of the thunder power, so the power lost its core itself, and could not have as much destructive ability anymore.</p><p>‘Huh!’</p><p>Ye Chen was surprised, but the Ghost Wood King was even more surprised. He had abstracted the vitality of the thunder attack for sure, but there was even a hint of destruction element power which could destroy anything in this world. No matter it was vitality or deadliness, it could all be destroyed by it. As he had absorbed the vitality of the thunder power, it made him a target of that destruction power, so a hint of his core was surprisingly wounded for the first time.</p><p>The cold yellow-green pupils started to shine with an evil light again. The ghost wood king shook his body and more black veins appeared out of nowhere. They did not try to attack Ye Chen; instead, they blocked out the space around them, creating a massive net and leaving Ye Chen nowhere to hide.</p><p>“Gold Pattern!”</p><p>Seeing this, Ye Chen did not dare to be careless. He threw out one sword attack which released a dark gold pattern, destroying the veins around.</p><p>Crack! Crack!</p><p>Chin! Chin! Chin! Chin! Chin!</p><p>However, the toughness of the veins was out of Ye Chen’s expectations, as he only managed to destroy dozens of the veins. The sword qi accumulated densely before forming into a gold pattern. But, its power ran out after hitting the target as well.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>After that attack failed, Ye Chen changed his sword waving style and performed more dark gold patterns, turning hundreds of meters around him into a dark gold realm. The veins with beast power started to shatter after being attacked wave after wave.</p><p>‘So many attacks in a row?’ The Ghost Wood King’s expression changed slightly.</p><p>“Expanded Ghost Punch!”</p><p>The massive fists of his tightened as he threw out another punch toward Ye Chen. Once this punch was thrown out, a sharp wind blowing sound would be heard, causing negative feelings to be generated in his opponent’s head. People with weaker minds would lose it by now already.</p><p>“Gold Fury!”</p><p>After accumulating the Zhen yuan to an extreme, Ye Chen waved his sword, performing his most powerful sword attack. Ghost Wood King was not Liu Wujian, so even the normal killing attacks had to be thrown out with the greatest effort.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A huge amount of qi power exploded, locking down all of the veins around. Even the forest outside the vein blockade was damaged drastically; all of the trees had been pulled out as whole.</p><p>However, this was the forbidden place, so the space was very stable. The energy here was drastically influenced, and all of the trees here were not normal ones either. Therefore, the damage did not spread out too far, covering only one to two miles.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Ye Chen made a low noise. It turned out that Ghost Wood King’s punch contained a hint of vitality eliminating power, which was not stoppable by Zhen yuan. He was only able to block out a tiny bit while the rest landed on his real body.</p><p>“Destroy!”</p><p>He used his Destruction sword intent immediately, which devoured this pile of power again.</p><p>“The third attack! Ghost away! Kill!”</p><p>The beast king got an even creepier look in his eyes as he performed his favorite attack. He said before that he was going to kill Ye Chen within three attacks, so he naturally would not go easy on the latter with his last attack. The attack contained the power that could shatter souls, and was three times more powerful than the ghost shattering punch.</p><p>Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!</p><p>Loud ghost cries were heard such that even Murong Qingcheng and Yan Fengfeng, who were rather far away, were hit by the impact of the sound.</p><p>The wings behind Murong Qingcheng’s back were tightened to the maximum as waves of demon power followed her wings and poured into her fingers. The second that Ye Chen was in danger, she planned to use her most powerful Sky Demon Finger to help him. She thought that it was still not enough, so she had secretly pulled out a hint of her demon essence and combined it with her own demon power. All of a sudden, that demon intent of hers increased drastically, turning her into a demonic race princess.</p><p>“I must take this attack!”</p><p>Ye Chen made a long roar as his Zhen yuan shot out while the gold sword on his back slashed out. With that, the destruction sword intent covered the area. Wherever his attack reached, all of the vitality was destroyed, the effect not being that weaker than his opponent’s soul shattering attack.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The fist power and golden sword finally crashed together. The two different waves of power clashed with each other, taking over half side of the sky each. The clash between two kinds of destructive intents would make a huge impact on each other regardless who won and who lost.</p><p>The beast king flicked his eyebrows.</p><p>Crack! Crack!</p><p>A metal twisting sound was heard as the tip of the gold sword started to bend under the effect of the fist power. It turned out that this power was generated by a twisting force which was very aggressive. Although the gold sword was quite tough, it was only a high rank weapon after all. It would be impossible for it to not get worn down by the attacks from a half step king warriors.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>A cold light flashed across Ye Chen’s eyes as he made a grabbing gesture with his sword finger while his gold sword was separated into three parts. Next, the two sword shadows surrounded the beast king from both left and eight. The gold sword itself was shattered by the fist power before being blown away.</p><p>“Immortal! City!”</p><p>After doing all this, Ye Chen did not change the expression on his face but made a light growl while that immortal qi spread out in the air.</p><p>A mouthful of blood was projected out as Ye Chen was blown away by a punch. However, it was only a slight physical injury while the vitality inside his body was safely protected. Even if he had been seriously wounded, he would not be afraid at all. With the immortal body, small injuries would not be an issue, regardless whether they were internal or external.</p><p>Having wounded Ye Chen, the beast king was not having a good time either. Those Zhen yun flying swords were moving extremely fast, and with his reaction, he could only stop one while the rest of the attacks just landed on the protective beast Zhen Yuan.</p><p>“Sky Demon Finger!”</p><p>It was right then that Murong Qingcheng got involved and the black finger power was shot.</p><p>“Nirvana flame.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Yan Fengfeng’s attack followed right behind. The flame could cause the veins to burn immediately, and even galf step king warriors could get injured from it.</p><p>“Huh!”</p><p>Although the Ghost Wood King had guessed that Yan Fengfeng’s original form was powerful, he had not anticipated that his opponent was from the phoenix family, who naturally controlled the fire element. It would be just right to counter Ghost wood, since they naturally conflicted with each other.</p><p>The Ghost Wood King did not want to spend time taking on the nirvana flame, so he cut down his ties with the veins which fell down onto the ground quickly.</p><p>“Burning Sky Sword!”</p><p>At that moment, the leader of the Mysterious mountain grasped the opportunity and shot out a sharp punch, generating a loud air slicing sound.</p><p>“Still trying?”</p><p>The Ghost Wood King would not care for this at all. Releasing his beast power, he blew the attack back.</p><p>“So powerful!”</p><p>Lin Gaoming knew about the gap between him and a half step beast king by now.</p><p>“I could not take care of you within three attacks, I have indeed underestimated you.</p><p>Although the beast king had checked on Murong and Yan Fengfeng, his attention was still mostly on Ye Chen. He could sense that Ye Chen’s vitality had not been affected. He had only been slightly wounded, and it was not hard to tell exactly how powerful he was.</p><p>“Vice versa.”</p><p>Ye Chen activated his immortal body. The wounds inside were nothing too big for him, and he would be perfectly fine once he started recovering.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
