Moreover, they cultivated demonic power, which was an energy of a higher level than Zhen Yuan. Under the same cultivation base, a cultivator of demonic power could instantly kill one with Zhen Yuan. This was the gap between the two.</p><p>Apart from all this, these six, as members of demonic human clan, were clearly aware that a person with perfect demonic blood vessels had a chance of awakening their innate ability, which would increase with the realm and become increasingly frightening. For example, if this ability was a defensive one, one’s defense would sky-rocket with the increase in realm. Even those with higher cultivation would be hard-pressed to get through this defense.</p><p>The six had come for the purpose of capturing or killing the murderer. Never did they imagine that they would run into a demonic human with perfect demonic vessels.</p><p>The six exchanged glances.</p><p>“Haha!”</p><p>Black Scales heartily laughed and said to the other five, “This our fortune! Perfect Demonic Vessels…even the Chaotic Demon Ocean could only produce two, one with mid Sea of Soul realm cultivation base and the other late Astral Reaching realm cultivation base. If we can capture this person, the clan elders will certainly reward us heavily. There will be no shortage of Zhen Yuan crystals and supreme grade spirit stones.”</p><p>“I wonder where she comes from. Are there other demonic clans apart from our Chaotic Demon Ocean capable of producing perfect demonic vessels?” Duo Long raised his suspicion.</p><p>The blue-skinned demonic human said, “My Chaotic Demon Ocean is referred to as the ten great clans. In reality, there were far more than ten demonic human clans in ancient times, numbering in the hundreds. However, with the passage of time, many waned and simply disappeared while some hid themselves in dark, never to be heard from again. Isn’t there the Yuwen clan in True Spirit Continent? I heard it’s ruled by two Demonic Human Kings. She might be from this Yuwen Clan!”</p><p>“What does Yuwen Clan amount to? Would they dare to confront our ten great clans? Clan elders had already planned to make a trip to True Spirit Continent and force Yuwen Clan to migrate here and merge. So, the perfect demonic vessels they had produced should obviously serve our clan.”</p><p>“Haha…Seems like the heavens are looking for my demonic human clan. There will be a day when we’ll unify the whole True Spirit World!”</p><p>Hearing their words, Ye Chen creased his brows. He didn’t expect that the Chaotic Demon Ocean’s demonic clan had their hands stretched so far out. They were actually planning on going to the continent and forcing the Yuwen Clan to migrate. If that happened, Murong Clan and other demonic clans would certainly not be able to escape. After all, their strength was simply too weak. Not to mention them, any power on True Spirit Continent seemed weaker than the ten great demonic human clans on the surface.</p><p>Murong catching their attention would certainly be a thorn in their side.</p><p>“I was careless. I should have interrupted her earlier and left this place.” Ye Chen’s squinted, his eyes gleaming with a cold light.</p><p>“However, according to clan records, once perfect demonic vessels break through into half-step Demonic Human King realm, they would be invincible. With us six and five hundred clansmen, it won’t be difficult to defeat her or kill her, but capturing her back alive will be hard.” The gray-robed demonic man frowned.</p><p>White Nightmare said with a voice brimming with killing intent, “No need for so much trouble. As long as we heavily injure her, we can easily take her back.”</p><p>“Sounds good! Even if she becomes a perfect half-step Demonic Human King, she will need some time to familiarize herself with her own strength, and won’t become invincible immediately.” Duo Long nodded.</p><p>The six had no intentions of interrupting her breakthrough. After all, a person with perfect demonic vessels breaking through was no small matter. Who knew what would happen if they were to interrupt! If they were to bring a cripple back, they would instead be punished by the clan. Hence, they could only wait for her breakthrough. In any case, with their strength and numbers, they were not worried at all.</p><p>“Let’s take care of this annoyance until then.” Turning his head, White Nightmare eerily looked at Ye Chen.</p><p>“Since we already have a perfect demonic vessel warrior, no need to keep this one alive. We can’t afford any accidents.” Black Scales coldly smiled.</p><p>“Seems like you’re quite confident.” Ye Chen had been secretly accumulating strength. A peerless Destruction Sword Intent was kept restrained inside his Sea of Soul, ready to burst out and destroy everything.</p><p>“You think we shouldn’t be confident with our strength?” The blue-skinned demonic human mockingly looked at Ye Chen.</p><p>“No need to talk smack with him. Kill him together.”</p><p>Five hundred Sea of Soul realm demonic human’s combined attack would lead to too big of a destruction, and could easily destroy the entire island. Thus, the six of them decided to personally take action. As long as they paid some attention at controlling their power, the island wouldn’t suffer too much pressure.</p><p>“Fine then, I’ll kill you too.” Ye Chen’s body suddenly leaned forward before he unsheathed the Thunder Disaster Sword and issued his strongest sword—Waning Moon.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>The black crescent-moon seemed as if ready to devour the entire world. The bright sun in the sky suddenly dimmed, completely losing its luster. As the sword energy swept across, pure destruction sword intent gushed out, swarming across like a hurricane.</p><p>At this moment, Ye Chen’s strength had been exhibited to the peak.</p><p>“B*stard! Be careful!”</p><p>White Nightmare, who had experienced this move before, roared. Gray colored Zhen Yuan burst out of his body, gushing across like a tide.</p><p>Apart from Duo Long, the other four had also heard of the powerful sword arts of Ye Chen from the latter. They knew that they couldn’t be careless. They must defend together, or they might encounter a fatal danger. Thus, the other five, including Duo Long, also operated their Zhen Yuan to the peak and gushed it out, combining with White Nightmare’s Zhen Yuan. The combined Zhen Yuan turned into a large five-colored river, intercepting the black sword energy.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>Black sword energy battered the Zhen Yuan river, creating fierce energy ripples. The enchantment above the island warped and layers of black mist were scraped off like a huge white pen smearing on a black paper, revealing a portion of the sky.</p><p>The sun and moon dimmed, and the world lost its color.</p><p>The spectating Sea of Soul realm demonic humans went completely deaf and blind, unable to detect any movement. It seemed as if the space around them had stagnated.</p><p>Dum!</p><p>It might have been a long time or perhaps an instant as they recovered their hearing. However, the enormous echo they heard immediately shook their soul, blackness appearing before their eyes. They almost fell down the sky.</p><p>The six demonic humans, who bore the full brunt of the attack, were forced back with blood at the corners of their mouth. Their faces were quite pale.</p><p>On the other side, Ye Chen also retreated dozens of steps, his clothes fluttering in the wind.</p><p>“How is this so powerful? The six of us combined can barely hold on! If faced alone, it would be a sure death, no?” Black Scales was alarmed and furious.</p><p>Duo Long said, “Use the Six Way Cloud Formation. Otherwise, we don’t have much of a chance of killing him, unless the five hundred clansmen join in too.”</p><p>“En, this kid deserves the Six Way Cloud Formation.”</p><p>A faint flicker appeared in the gray-robed demonic man’s hand, producing a wrist-thick long chain. The chain was black, barbed at the front end and ringed at the back. The ringed end was further connected to a slender chain, which had a loop tied at its front end, seemingly to hook something.</p><p>The chain was clearly an artifact, giving off extremely powerful ripples. However, in Ye Chen’s eyes, it was merely a semi supreme grade artifact, and nothing more. He wondered what they were playing at,</p><p>“Link.” The blue-skinned demonic human suddenly roared.</p><p>Kakakak!</p><p>With that, an astonishing scene occurred. The slender chain at the rear end of the long chains in their hands linked together, forming a single entity. Even an idiot could tell that the chains’ might had greatly increased after becoming a single entity.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The six arranged themselves in a row and yanked the chains in their hands, raising it high in the air and striking toward Ye Chen.</p><p>Clatter!</p><p>A summit on the mountain was merely brushed by one chain, but immediately turned into dust. Meanwhile, the remaining five chains simultaneously attacked Ye Chen. A black Qi gushed out of the chains’ surface, making them look quite thick. They seemed like five frantic black flood dragons coiling around Ye Chen in the void.</p><p>Dang!</p><p>With a flicker, Ye Chen raised the Thunder Disaster Sword, confronting one of the chains head-on. A frightening energy immediately transmitted to his body through the Thunder Disaster Sword. Despite being fully prepared, his body was blasted off. He didn’t expect the might behind the chains to reach such a degree. This was no semi supreme grade artifact, but a pseudo supreme grade artifact.</p><p>Although six individuals using one pseudo supreme artifact would restrict their movements, they had a huge advantage in Zhen Yuan. After all, how could one’s Zhen Yuan compare to six? He finally understood what this Six Way Cloud Formation was. With this technique, these six could contend against a ‘strongest’ half-step King.</p><p>“What! Not dead, not even injured?” Duo Long was astounded.</p><p>“I see. He is wearing a pseudo supreme grade armor. No wonder he wasn’t injured at all.” Seeing bronze runes on Ye Chen’s protective Zhen Yuan, White Nightmare immediately realized the situation.</p><p>“Humph! So what if he’s wearing a pseudo supreme grade armor? His cultivation base is only at late Sea of Soul realm. He absolutely can’t bring out the full power of this armor. Moreover, activating the armor needs huge amounts of Zhen Yuan. He won’t last more than a few times.”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>With these thoughts, the six continued their assault.</p><p>Dang Dang Dang!</p><p>Ye Chen incessantly retaliated with his sword. Apprehensive of the chain’s power, he only shot sword Qi from a distance. However, how could distant sword Qi contend against the original body of the chains? It was easily destroyed.</p><p>Without any choice, Ye Chen had to face the chains head on a few more times. Every time he did, his blood Qi would soar and he would be sent flying back.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
