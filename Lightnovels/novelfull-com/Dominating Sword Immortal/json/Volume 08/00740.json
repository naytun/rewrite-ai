Since brother Sun didn’t let me down, I’ll not let you brother Sun down either.” When Ye Chen rescued Sun Tianlang, he had selfish intentions. After all, saving him didn’t require much effort on his part. It was easy as flipping a palm, and he believed that the latter also must be somewhat suspicious.</p><p>At this moment, Ye Chen genuinely approved of Sun Tianlang as a comrade.</p><p>“I don’t know where you get such confidence. As I see it, your confidence is your stupidity.” The Wind Storm King said.</p><p>As a half step King of the Punishment King’s level, Wind Storm King was an obscure and unreputed kind. However, none of those who knew his bottom line would dare to look down on him. It should be known that Half step Kings were also divided into many levels— ordinary half step Kings, reputed Half step Kings, peak Half step Kings, and the strongest Half step Kings who could be counted on one’s fingers. Although Wind Storm King had not reached the peak half step King level, he was extremely close to it. Not to mention Ye Chen, who had a cultivation base of late Sea of Soul realm, even a peak Half step King wouldn’t be able to take him down in a short while.</p><p>Moreover, the Wind Storm King computed that Ye Chen’s strength had reached the realm of reputed Half step Kings at most. A brief state of being one with the world couldn’t have allowed his profound to improve too much. Just a ten percent increment in every profound would already be heaven-defying.</p><p>“Wind Storm King, I’ll deal with this kid. You make sure to cut off their retreat.” The Iron Hand King clenched his fist, letting out a metal clanking sound.</p><p>“Rest assured, they won’t escape even if they grow wings.” The Wind Storm King’s hands formed a seal, letting out numerous wind walls that seemed like extremely sturdy concentric circles.</p><p>“Kid, you can die…”</p><p>Seeing that the Wind Storm King had blocked the scene, the Iron Hand King revealed a sinister expression and viciously stared Ye Chen. However, before he had even completed his words, he discovered that the distance between him and Ye Chen and already been reduced to less than ten meters. The latter swung his arms and countless sharp energies, which were hard to see with naked eyes, assaulted him from every direction.</p><p>The countless sharp energies made Iron Hand King shiver as his eyes shrunk into two dots. An appalled expression appeared on his face.</p><p>Ye Chen had unexpectedly seized the initiative first, which caught the other a bit off guard. However, what made him appalled was that he couldn’t even see the trajectory of the sword Qi’s assault. He could only indistinctly feel the presence of sharp energies in the void, every one of which was threatening to him. All of this was done like a snap of finger. It was the pinnacle of fast.</p><p>“This kid can’t be allowed to leave alive.”</p><p>As a veteran Half step King, Iron Hand King’s strength was far above the likes of Ghost Wood King and Gopher King, and his reaction speed was also far above. Almost subconsciously, his two arms criss-crossed before his chest, and his protective Zhen Yuan was activated to the limits of his control at the same time. Bronze colored runes diffused out of his armor, sticking on his protective Zhen Yuan.</p><p>Clang Clang Clang!</p><p>In the next instant, countless arcs of sparks flew at his Protective Zhen Yuan, most at his chest.</p><p>“Quasi extreme grade Armor…”</p><p>Ye Chen squinted his eyes. His Spiritual Sword contained the wood profound and fast profound, attaining sixty percent and fifty percent completion respectively. Adding his cultivation base at the late Sea of Soul realm, thus improving his Zhen Yuan a lot, the might of Spiritual Sword was several times compared to before. It was not something the protective Zhen Yuan of a half step King could resist.</p><p>“Haha, you really did give me a scare. But, I’m invincible with this Bronze Armor! Let’s see how you break my defenses.” Iron Hand King heartily laughed with a provocative expression. However, he was astonished inwardly in reality.</p><p>If he didn’t have this Bronze armor, he would have been completely defenseless before this sword. It was simply too quick, too powerful! He couldn’t imagine how Ye Chen became so powerful overnight. He seemed to have become a completely different person.</p><p>“Quasi extreme grade Armor really deserves its reputation. Seems like I’ll have to spend some effort here.” Ye Chen didn’t expect that Iron Hand King would have a quasi extreme grade armor. This had increased the difficulty of killing the other by several times. Fortunately, using this armor consumed heavy amounts of Zhen Yuan. He refused to believe that the latter could continue to support it.</p><p>“Thunder Devour!”</p><p>With the Spiritual Sword proving ineffective, Ye Chen used the Thunder Devour. Black light spheres layered like a thunder blade and fiercely thrust into the protective Zhen Yuan of Iron Hand King.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Iron Hand King’s two feet left the ground, flying off. Frantic lightning surrounded him, making him seem like a lightning figure.</p><p>“Iron Hand King, you need me to act?” The Wind Storm King’s expression darkened. He almost didn’t dare believe his eyes, wondering if he was in an illusion.</p><p>“No need!”</p><p>Iron Hand King stood up fiercely, saying inwardly, “I underestimated this kid’s strength. However, late Sea of Soul realm is, in the end, late Sea of Soul realm. How high can his defense be? I refuse to believe that he can resist my offense.”</p><p>“Golden God Fist!”</p><p>Stamping his feet, the Iron Hand King leaped up and smashed his palm at Ye Chen, who was a hundred meters away. As this palm exploded, countless golden fists appeared in the void, storming forth like a hurricane.</p><p>Iron Hand King’s strength had undoubtedly been displayed at this moment.</p><p>“Iron Hand King, you’ll die for sure today.”</p><p>If he didn’t have a quasi extreme grade Armor, he would have died long ago. However, Ye Chen was not hurried either. The former’s Zhen Yuan was limited and he wouldn’t be able to sustain for a long time. Generally speaking, half step King Zhen Yuan could allow one to use an offensive quasi extreme grade Offensive Artifact three to five times. As for a defensive one, it would only hold out for the time to brew a cup of tea.</p><p>Facing this punch, Ye Chen’s Thunder Disaster Sword waved and a dark golden ripple blossomed in the void, disintegrating the golden fists.</p><p>“What! His metal profound has also improved by so such?”</p><p>Iron Hand King had been believing that Ye Chen was extremely fortunate to have his Spiritual Sword and Thunder Devour improve so much. In the past, there had been a few people who had greatly improved one or two profounds under the state of being one with the world. However, Ye Chen had showed four profounds at this moment, all of which had been greatly improved.</p><p>“Boundless Golden Ripple!”</p><p>Ye Chen gave no opportunity to let the Iron Hand King catch his breath. The Thunder Disaster Sword was waved repeatedly, and waves of golden ripple assaulted Iron Hand King one after another, rapidly consuming his Zhen Yuan.</p><p>“Wind Storm King, make your move…fast!”</p><p>The pressure on Iron Hand King greatly increased while the Zhen Yuan inside his body was disappearing like flowing water. The consumption of Bronze Armor was indeed frightening. He would soon be unable to hold out.</p><p>Without needing Iron Hand King’s prompt, Wind Storm King had already made his move. It was precisely the Gale Spear he was proud of. A gale spear flickered in the void, piercing at Ye Chen’s forehead.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>Ye Chen took out an upper grade sword with his left hand and severed the gale spear as he send a Zhen Yuan transmission to Sun Tianlang and Murong Qingcheng, who were coming to help, “You don’t need to…Make sure to keep Jiang Tian in here.”</p><p>Either he wouldn’t kill anyone, or he would kill everyone.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Sun Tianlang and Murong Qngcheng halted, secretly locking onto Jian Tian and watching his movements.</p><p>“Storm Rain!”</p><p>Seeing his Gale Spear that he’d been so proud of being completely ineffective, Wind Storm King roared and waved his palm high. Sky-covering Gale Spears shot out which were only one-fifth as strong as normal ones. However, their combined might was hundreds of times greater, completely capable of prevailing through numbers.</p><p>“Transcendent Golden God Fist!”</p><p>The Iron Hand King didn’t hesitate to consume a large amount of Zhen Yuan as he used his strongest move. Countless golden fists shook the sky as they spiraled toward Ye Chen. Such might and aura could easily stun an ordinary Half step King.</p><p>The two were giving it their all. They did not wish to let Ye Chen leave alive at any cost. The current Ye Chen was already enough to scare them.</p><p>Confronting the strongest moves of the two, Ye Chen’s face remained unchanged. An enormous Thunder Sphere was condensing above the Thunder Disaster Sword and still increasing. Finally, it stopped after growing more than ten meters in diameter. It was basically a dark, void sun with black lightning tightly packed inside.</p><p>“Go!” Ye Chen slashed between the two.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Sun Tianlang, Murong Qingcheng, and Jiang Tian on the sidelines retreated with pale faces, and those wind walls instantly shattered. In the end, boundless lightning energy radiated out from the center of the open land, even filling the connecting passages. If someone was heading this way at this moment, they wouldn’t feel too good.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Iron Hand King and Wind Storm King bore the brunt of the attack. Iron Hand King had his Bronze armor, so he didn’t suffer much. The Wind Storm King, however, was looking wretched. Although his strength was above Iron Hand King’s, he didn’t have a quasi extreme grade Defensive Artifact protecting his body. He couldn’t help but spurt a mouthful of bloody mist.</p><p>“This kid is troublesome, escape!”</p><p>Wind Storm King’s face was unsightly. He never expected that he would be forced into such a condition by a young man. This was simply a disgrace!</p><p>“You can’t escape!” Ye Chen held the sword with both hands and chopped at Wind Storm King. With that, a crescent moon shaped sword energy swept across the latter’s body.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The Wind Storm King’s head and left arm flew off, spurting blood. Meanwhile, a distinct sword scar was left behind on his defensive artifact.</p><p>One Sword!</p><p>Wind Storm King had died.</p><p>This sword was precisely Ye Chen’s strongest sword move—Waning Moon!</p><p>Iron Hand King had a quasi extreme grade Artifact protecting his body, so the Waning Moon might not have been able to pierce through. However, Wind Storm King was different. He was absolutely incapable of resisting it.</p><p>“You dared to kill Old Feng!” Jiang Tian looked at Ye Chen as if he didn’t dare believe. Someone as strong as Old Feng was killed by Ye Chen, making him feel boundless shock and numbness.</p><p>“So what? Your turn will come soon.” Ye Chen indifferently said.</p><p>“You’re dead! Wind Storm King was my master Space Emperor’s able subordinate. After killing him, nobody under the heavens can save you.” Jiang Tian roared as he escaped toward the nearby passage.</p><p>“Stay for me!” Sun Tianlang blocked his path while Murong Qingcheng closed in from side.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
