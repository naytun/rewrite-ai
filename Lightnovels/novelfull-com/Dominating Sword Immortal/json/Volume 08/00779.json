At the swing of the sword, the space itself seemed to have been slashed. Even before the sword energy made contact with the chains, its sword aura had already assaulted them.</p><p>The Black finger energy was Murong Qingcheng’s innate demonic skill, Demonic Finger. When used with her half-step perfect Demonic Human King realm, its might was ten folds compared to before. With a flick of her finger, a soul-stirring black energy shot out, dazzling with its black radiance like a shining black diamond.</p><p>Dong!</p><p>The black crescent sword energy and black finger sword energy collided and created a terrifying shockwave, causing the island underneath to explode with a bang. The ashes and dust flew and the ocean water within a perimeter of a hundred li caved a thousand meters deep, just as a black hole appeared in the sky. This was the scene of Stunning Sky being ripped apart by the shockwave. The exchange between the three individuals had indistinctly surpassed the confrontation between ‘strongest’ half-step Kings.</p><p>The shockwave not only destroyed everything in the vicinity, Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng also shot back like released arrows with blood leaking from their mouths.</p><p>However, at the same time, White Nightmare was the one to actually spurt out blood. Be it Ye Chen’s Waning Moon or Murong Qingcheng’s Demonic Finger, either one was enough in itself to completely defeat him. Clearly, confronting both of them at the same time was beyond his capabilities. Moreover, the Six Way Cloud Polation was a pseudo extreme grade artifact, and required a huge Zhen Yuan consumption. Confronting the combined assault while being in the state of weakened Zhen Yuan caused White Nightmare’s injuries to be much more intense.</p><p>“Still not enough?” Black Scales beside him said with a gloomy face. Murong Qingcheng’s speed was astonishing, and the distance between the two sides was about a hundred li. They wouldn’t succeed even if they went all out to chase.</p><p>White Nightmare fiercely gazed the two distant figures, “Worthy of being a perfect half-step Demonic Human King…to already have the power nearing ‘strongest’ half-step Demonic King. It won’t take her long to become a ‘strongest’ half-step King.”</p><p>Duo Long bitterly smiled and said, “That kid too…Although his cultivation base is not high, his accomplishment in profound is too deep, giving him a might ten times that of his base strength. Fortunately, he hasn’t entered half-step King realm. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be them fleeing, but us.”</p><p>“Although we failed to capture them, obtaining whereabouts of perfect demonic vessels is good too. The Elders will still reward us with some extreme grade spirit stones and Zhen Yuan crystals…Better something than nothing.” The blue-skinned demonic man consoled himself.</p><p>…</p><p>Flying across several li in a breath, Murong Qingcheng and Ye Chen lowered their speed.</p><p>“A pseudo extreme grade artifact can’t be underestimated. That demonic human’s strength was lower than us, but he could still produce an attack greater than ours.”</p><p>A few injuries were no cause of worries for the two. Ye Chen had the immortal Body, allowing him to instantly recover. Meanwhile, Murong Qingcheng had perfect demonic vessels and a fourth step spirit body. Although her recovery speed was inferior to Ye Chen, her injuries had already recovered. At this moment, Ye Chen sighed.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng said, “Those chains should be at the peak of pseudo extreme grade artifacts!”</p><p>Half-step extreme grade artifacts were usually imitations of extreme grade ones, and had a might half of the latter. On the other hand, pseudo extreme grade ones were poor quality products among extreme grade artifacts. They could be considered a part of extreme grade artifacts, albeit those with poor quality.</p><p>Their might was half or more than half that of extreme grade artifacts. On the other hand, one couldn’t say that the power of a half-step extreme grade artifact would always be less than a pseudo one’s. Some extremely powerful half-step extreme grade artifacts were not inferior to pseudo extreme grade ones at all. However, the Six Way Cloud Polation was extremely powerful and highly flexible. Even when the two of them joined hands, they could only slightly suppress their opponent and still suffered slight injuries in the process. If it had been someone else, they would have been turned into a meat paste.</p><p>“Demonic Human Clan is the ruler of Chaotic Demon Ocean. Their hands and eyes reach as far as the sky. We can’t stay at this place. We should leave as soon as possible.”</p><p>The two had hidden at a distance of more than a million li from the site of incident, but were still sniffed out. It was evident that the Demonic Human Clan’s control over Chaotic Demon Ocean was simply frightening. It would be extremely difficult to lose their tracks.</p><p>Hence, the two no longer delayed and chose a direction to fly toward at a normal pace.</p><p>After the two left, White Nightmare and rest didn’t stay on the island for a second. They immediately set off back to Demonic Human Clan’s headquarters and report back their findings of a perfect demonic vessel demonic human, leaving further matters into the hands of the higher-ups.</p><p>As more than six hundred demonic humans were returning, the black-robed demonic old man was also hastening.</p><p>His figure teleported in the void, his speed simply unimaginable. One moment he was tens of thousands miles away, and the next moment he was right before the eyes.</p><p>Black Qi appeared and the black-robed old man’s figure stopped; his actions seemed habitual as he continued his investigation. The old man closed his eyes, releasing his formless soul power in every direction, covering tens of thousands of li. Not discovering anything, he diluted his soul power and increased the range, almost covering two hundred thousand li.</p><p>“Eh?” The old man opened his eyes and his face turned strange.</p><p>Shua!</p><p>The black Qi dissipated and his figure disappeared.</p><p>White Nightmare was leading the six hundred demonic humans, hurrying back. Suddenly, black Qi appeared in the sky before them and a black-robed old man walked out.</p><p>“Ancestor!”</p><p>White Nightmare and rest were stunned, then hurriedly bowed down. The Sea of Soul realm demonic humans in the rear directly knelt in the sky, not daring to raise their heads.</p><p>The black-robed man was one of the three Demonic Human Kings of the Demonic Human Clan. Such an existence would command respect wherever he went. Being referred to as ‘Ancestor’ in the clan, this old man’s age was several hundred years.</p><p>“Rise!” The black-robed old man said expressionlessly.</p><p>“Yes!” White Nightmare and the rest rose immediately on hearing his command.</p><p>“You seem like you’ve fought a great battle, eh?” The black-robed old man asked.</p><p>The fat demonic human, Duo Long, said, “Ancestor, we found the killer. But we were useless and allowed him to escape again.”</p><p>“You six had the Six Way Cloud Polation and six hundred clansmen, and he still escaped? Was he a ‘strongest’ half-step King?” The black-robed old man’s face sunk.</p><p>Black Scales beside Duo Long explained, “Ancestor, he actually wasn’t a ‘strongest half-step King. But, his grasp on space profound was quite deep, and could warp the assault of the Six Way Cloud Polation. Moreover, his strength is also nearing ‘strongest’ half-step King. His sword arts were mystical and troublesome.”</p><p>“Eh? Space profound! No wonder! Space profound is one of the strongest profounds. It has many clever applications and can’t be judged with common sense. Your failure is not without reason. But seeing your faces, I presume that might not be the main concern, right?” The black-robed old man observed them and asked.</p><p>“Ancestor is wise!”</p><p>Duo Long cupped his fists and said, “He escaped because he had another companion, and the latter’s identity is important, — perfect demonic vessel demonic human…one that has advanced to half-step Demonic Human King and is innately gifted in speed.”</p><p>“Perfect Demonic Vessels! Explain in detail!” The black-robed old man’s complexion changed, no longer calm and leisurely.</p><p>Duo Long didn’t dare try to create suspense and spoke frankly, “According to our speculation, she must have come from the demonic human clan of True Spirit Continent, although she didn’t confirm it. I wonder if our clan should make a trip to the continent and strengthen our power and influence.”</p><p>The black-robed old man glanced at Duo Long said, “That’s none of your concern. Don’t ask too much.”</p><p>“Yes.” Duo Long was startled, then lowered his head.</p><p>“True Spirit Continent…that place is not a wasteland. The Kings there are as numerous as clouds, more than any other place. If my Chaotic Demonic Ocean’s Demonic Clan has to invade the continent’s demonic human clan, a long and meticulous planning is needed. Acting with haste will only result in burning one’s own hand with their own fire.”</p><p>One couldn’t just see one aspect. Chaotic Demon Ocean’s demonic human clans seemed to be stronger than any other force on the continent, but True Spirit Continent was not as simple as it looked. It was termed as the Land of a Hundred Kings, because the Kings there had never numbered under a hundred. It was the number one place of humans. Adding on demonic beasts and other species, the Kings on the continent were simply too numerous. If they rudely tried to force their way in, even as Chaotic Demon Ocean’s demonic human clans, they wouldn’t be able to return in one piece. Otherwise, they would have forced the demonic human clans there to migrate long ago.</p><p>“Alright! You return back and inform the clan first thing. I’ll pursue them.”</p><p>The black-robed old man treated this matter with great importance. His hands were itching to catch that perfect demonic human vessel. Unfortunately, two days had already passed, and they should have escaped millions of li away. Even he had no way of finding them in a short period.</p><p>“Yes!” Duo Long and the rest immediately took their leave.</p><p>“Perfect demonic blood vessels…hehe!” The black-robed old man coldly laughed, and his body turned into an illusory black Qi.</p><p>…</p><p>Chaotic Demon Ocean occupied millions of li. Ye Chen had Murong Qingcheng had to spend five days before they could arrive at the ocean outside. The two didn’t continue further, but searched for a hidden island to rest.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng had just entered the half-step King realm and had yet to consolidate her cultivation base and familiarize herself with her newfound strength. Using this opportunity, not only could she consolidate her cultivation, but could increase it further, since she still had demonic power crystals.</p><p>As for Ye Chen, although he had no hope of making a breakthrough in cultivation base, his space profound had already reached forty percent completion, and his space profound sword art had already attained its embryonic form. As long as he had time, creating his own space profound sword art should not be difficult.</p><p>Once he succeeded, his battle strength would rise like a surging tide, and he would have a strength rivaling the ‘strongest’ half-step Kings. Moreover, space profound had many clever applications, and he had only understood some of them. Only these few applications allowed him to resist the six half-step demonic human Kings. Without the space profound, he would have been immediately defeated.</p><p>Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, a week had passed.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Inside a mountain range on the island, Ye Chen swung the Thunder Disaster Sword in his hand. With that, the summit before him immediately warped and shattered as if in a mirror.</p><p>“Space profound is indeed powerful! Even though my technique is not completed, its might is already no longer under Waning Moon. Moreover, its more indefensible. Once covered in the sword aura, one would feel like their body was placed inside a mirror. If the opponent’s strength was lacking by even a bit, their body would shatter into a thousand pieces along with the mirror.” Ye Chen was astounded by his own sword art.</p><p>“What a powerful human! I better run!”</p><p>There were numerous demonic beasts inside the ocean. These days, two humans had suddenly appeared on the island and had attracted the attention of many powerful beasts. The beast escaping right now was a half-step Demonic Beast King equal to humanity’s half-step Kings. Seeing such powerful sword arts from Ye Chen. how could it still dare to have any thoughts? It immediately retreated for several miles.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
