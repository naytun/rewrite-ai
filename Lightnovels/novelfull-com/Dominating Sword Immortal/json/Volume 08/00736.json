At this moment, he couldn’t even open his eyes easily. The entire world was still; he couldn’t hear anything, neither did he care about anything. He only thought about nicely lying down for a moment, and even better, to never wake up.</p><p>“This won’t do!”</p><p>Biting his lips, Ye Chen sobered up by relying on pain and stuffed a Zhen Yuan recovering pill in his mouth. He shook his head, feeling that his mind had turned quite sluggish. In his current condition, even an ordinary Sea of Soul realm expert could kill him with one strike.</p><p>“My strength is still too weak. At this point, thinking about peak Masters as opponents is useless. My true opponents are half-step Kings. To leave this graveyard alive, to rise and not be looked down upon, I can only raise my own strength.”</p><p>As of now, Ye Chen’s only thought was to find a place to treat injuries. If he didn’t, he would soon die. After healing, he didn’t intend to move out immediately. Instead, he would first break into late Sea of Soul realm and garner sufficient strength. Moving out then wouldn’t be too late.</p><p>However, his current issue was that he simply couldn’t find a good spot to undergo closed-door cultivation. If he found a random spot and began to treat his injuries, he would die even quicker.</p><p>“Seems like talent also needs plenty of luck. Hope I soon find a good spot.” Ye Chen self-mockingly smiled, feeling that he would not hold on much longer.</p><p>As a testament to his good luck, in the time worth brewing a cup of tea, he found a stone room when he was on the verge of collapsing. The stone entrance of the room was shuttering up and down and had several restrictions outside. Almost without a thought, Ye Chen smashed the restrictions with a punch, and the stone door slowly opened upwards. With a swish, Ye Chen rushed inside and then closed it back.</p><p>“So many years of accumulated good luck is finally paying off.” With this as his final thought, Ye Chen passed out.</p><p>Before he fainted, his Immortal Body had already begun to operate, unceasingly healing his internal injuries. The pill he’d eaten turned into streams of Zhen Yuan, becoming the energy source for the immortal body. After all, the Immortal body art also consumed energy.</p><p>…</p><p>Far away from Ye Chen’s dwelling, Murong QIngcheng had her brows creased with a concerned expression. She could vaguely feel that something related to her had encountered danger. What made her uneasy was that she could only think of Ye Chen who could give her such a feeling.</p><p>However, she soon let out a sigh of relief. Her uneasiness had dissipated on its own.</p><p>After an unknown time, Ye Chen regained consciousness. He took out the water clock from his storage ring and discovered that three days had passed.</p><p>“Three days!” Letting out a cry of surprise, he began to inspect his injuries.</p><p>He was rather pleased. His near-death condition had already recovered to thirty percent, and he had regained some battle strength. Even this was because the Zhen Yuan restoring pill he’d eaten had already been consumed. If somebody had fed him another pill during these three days, his condition would have been restored to fifty percent or above.</p><p>“I’m fortunate enough to make it through this dangerous phase.”</p><p>Sitting cross-legged, Ye Chen looked around and discovered that this room was an area of completely vacuum. No longer paying any attention to the room, he took out another Zhen Yuan restoring pill and stuffed it inside his mouth.</p><p>When he was unconscious, the immortal body was automatically operating. Upon sobering, Ye Chen took initiative to operate it, increasing the efficiency by several folds.</p><p>After two more days. Ye Chen’s body had recovered by ninety percent.</p><p>“Almost done. This bit of injuries basically will have no effect. Now is the time to go all out and break through into late Sea of Soul realm!”</p><p>Advancing to late Sea of Soul realm from mid Sea of Soul realm was two to three times more difficult than going from peak early Sea of Soul realm to mid Sea of Soul realm. If one were to consider that the number of Sea of Soul experts in the continent was one hundred, then sixty would be early Sea of Soul realm experts, about thirty eight at mid Sea of Soul realm, and only two or three late Sea of Soul realm experts. One could well imagine how hard it was to reach the late Sea of Soul realm.</p><p>If Ye Chen had not already touched the bottleneck of late Sea of Soul realm, he would never have thought of immediately breaking through. After all, such a thought was not too realistic. How could breaking through a realm be so easy?</p><p>Of course, once one broke though, the benefits would be equally huge.</p><p>The amount of time one could maintain the state of one with the world would sharply increase, two-three folds compared to peak early Sea of Soul realm realm. With such an increase, Ye Chen had a premonition that all of his profounds would take a huge leap forward.</p><p>With his meridians almost mended, Ye Chen took a deep breath and entered the state of empty spirit, slowly circulating his Zhen Yuan. As Zhen Yuan moved, a cyan-colored luster appeared outside his body, making him seem like a cyan statue.</p><p>Night…</p><p>Although Ye Chen was not consciously operating the immortal body art, his injuries had completely recovered without any surprises. Moreover, after coming back from death’s door, his body’s strength had greatly increased. It was a blood-soaked rebirth, strengthening and intensifying his spirit, Qi, and soul.</p><p>Huff!</p><p>Letting out a breath of murky air, Ye Chen stopped his cultivation. Taking a fire pear from the Fire Pear Tree in his plant ring, he fiercely bit into it.</p><p>The fire pear which looked like a fire crystal was crisp yet tender and delicious. The pear pulp entered his body and moistened his recovered body, slowly increasing its toughness.</p><p>“This Fire Pear Tree needs to be properly cultivated. Unfortunately, there is no spirit tree nurturing fluid.”</p><p>Using a mid grade spirit tree nurturing fluid could yield a hundred years old tree in one year. In other words, it could raise a one year old tree to a hundred years old tree. A peak mid grade spirit tree nurturing fluid could have a one year tree reach two hundred years of maturity. If one used a high grade spirit tree nurturing fluid, it could yield five hundred years mature tree, or even seven hundred years. In ten years, one could transform a few thousand years matured tree into a ten thousand one.</p><p>A ten thousand year matured upper grade Fire Pear Tree was several times more precious than even a supreme grade artifact. Every mature tree would give more than five thousand fruits, and each fruit was comparable to Sea of Soul grade spirit energy crystal. It was simply appalling.</p><p>Of course, the current Fire Pear Tree was quite lacking. Its maturity was around three thousand years. Dozens of its fruits were worth one energy crystal.</p><p>“Spirit tree nurturing fluid is not easy to refine. I’ll try my luck at an auction later!” Ye Chen still had many upper grade crystals on him and also some considerably expensive treasures like soul stones. If he came by an upper grade nurturing fluid, he wouldn’t let it pass by.</p><p>After resting for a bit, Ye Chen resumed his cultivation.</p><p>…</p><p>While Ye Chen was cultivating, a group of people had already arrived before the Fire Bird King’s graveyard. This group included Ghost Wood King and Gopher King.</p><p>The two had entered the Gray Wolf King’s graveyard one day later than Ye Chen and the rest. However, their luck was not good, and had to return empty-handed. Without any choice, they could only give up and decide to enter Fire Bird King’s graveyard and try their luck. As demonic beasts, they were extremely covetous of the demonic arts left behind by the four Demon Kings.</p><p>“I wonder who has the second key.” Gopher King muttered.</p><p>“Zun-er.” Shield King signaled Xia Houzun.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Xia Houzun had no intention of monopolizing Fire Bird King’s graveyard. With so many people keeping watch, it would be simply impossible. Moreover, once the grave opened, it couldn’t be closed again, and others could still enter. Thus, it would be simply better to straightforwardly open the grave.</p><p>“How is it a youngling again?”</p><p>Many revealed skeptical expressions. First key was in the hands of Jian Tian, and now the second key was with Xia Houzun. They felt doubtful if the third and fourth key would also be with the young ones. It seemed that there was a secret rule, which was making young individuals obtain the keys.</p><p>Creak!</p><p>The entrance of the graveyard opened with a bang.</p><p>“Come, let’s go.”</p><p>“The Fire Bird King was a little stronger than Gray Wolf King, so the treasures should also be more.”</p><p>“Hope my luck is a bit better.”</p><p>The group gathered before the graveyard entered one another.</p><p>While flying, Gopher King said to Ghost Wood King, “I wonder if those people are here. Hope we run into them.”</p><p>Ghost Wood King said, “They won’t escape this time. We can kill each and every one of them.”</p><p>“Right! I believe that the kid who fought you is loaded with treasures.” Gopher King’s eyes flickered with a vicious glint.</p><p>After a few hours, Wind Storm King, Jiang Tian, as well as Iron Hand King also appeared.</p><p>“Who knows that kid might have died.” Iron Hand King didn’t think Ye Chen could make out after such heavy injuries.</p><p>“It would be better for him to die. He will only suffer if he lives.”</p><p>“Haha, true.”</p><p>The three stopped thinking about such a trifling matter and entered the graveyard.</p><p>“I wonder how Ye Chen and the rest are.”</p><p>With creased brows, Qin Liu and Yan Fengfeng entered the second graveyard with a flicker.</p><p>…</p><p>Time passed bit by bit, and Ye Chen eventually reached the critical point. He could feel that Zhen Yuan inside his body was showing signs of changing, like an undercurrent within a calm sea that could erupt at any moment into gargantuan waves.</p><p>“If not now, then when?”</p><p>Ye Chen previously killed Murong Qingcheng’s treacherous brother-in-law, Murong Wang, and obtained seven supreme grade spirit stones. Supreme Spirit Stones were used by Life and Death Kings, containing an astonishing Yuan Qi. Each chunk had an astronomical price. Ye Chen had always been hating to part with it. But, if he didn’t do it now, he would never do it.</p><p>Taking out a supreme grade spirit stones, Ye Chen held it in his hand, absorbing the energies within.</p><p>As expected of supreme grade spirit stones, there was no need to refine, and he could directly consume it. It instantly made Ye Chen’s Zhen Yuan turn richer. It couldn’t instantly become his own perpetual Zhen Yuan, and was an external power that would slowly dissipate if he didn’t successfully break through, but it was still a huge boon to his chances of a breakthrough, almost increasing them to eighty-ninety percent.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Roaring inwardly, Ye Chen summoned his Zhen Yuan, charging it straight toward the bottleneck.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
