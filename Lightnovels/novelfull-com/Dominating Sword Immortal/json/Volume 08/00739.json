He reacted instantly; his outer muscles wriggled, shooting out countless black Qi vines that turned into a huge net, surrounding Ye Chen.</p><p>Meanwhile, he himself stepped out, escaping outside the hall.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Facing the heaven-and-earth-covering vine net, Ye Chen slashed out casually. A dark golden ripple blossomed like flowers, creating a huge opening in the net. Ye Chen’s figure flickered while five sword rays shot out from his back, chasing after Ghost Wood King.</p><p>“Soul Scatter!”</p><p>Ghost King back-handedly punched behind. A spiraling fist energy shout out with an ear-piercing humming, sounding like a hair-raising wail of ghosts.</p><p>Shua!</p><p>If this had happened before, Ye Chen would have surely been blasted off, suffering heavy injuries. However, it was no longer the case. Confronting this punch, Ye Chen thrusted out only once, piercing through the fist energy which vanished like a popped bubble. Meanwhile, sparks flew from Ghost Wood King’s back, and he spurted out sections of his internal organs.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Routing out the fist energy, Ye Chen coldly slashed a few times with a trajectory that couldn’t be seen with naked eyes.</p><p>Shi shi shi shi!</p><p>Ghost Wood King’s figure paused. Immediately afterward, apart from his torso, his limbs and head separated into hundreds of pieces, seeming as if his body had passed through a sword net.</p><p>“What, how is this possible! How can his strength reach such an extent in a few days!” Outside the hall, a shadow fluctuated.</p><p>Picking Ghost Wood King and Gopher King’s storage rings, Ye Chen stepped out of the hall without a second glance, heading toward another passage.</p><p>Creak!</p><p>Without any warning, Ye Chen suddenly unsheathed his sword, slashed, and sheathed it back.</p><p>“You already knew?” Shadow King’s figure appeared. With a white face and a red dot on his forehead, he fiercely stared Ye Chen and spoke coarsely.</p><p>“You’re too confident in your hiding skill.”</p><p>If he had escaped while Ye Chen was dealing with the other two, Ye Chen couldn’t have done anything about it.</p><p>“Right, what a pity!” A remorseful expression flickered in Shadow Seeker King’s eyes as he fell headfirst.</p><p>“Iron Hand King, hope that you don’t run into me.” Collecting Shadow King’s storage ring, a cold light flickered in Ye Chen’s eyes.</p><p>…</p><p>At the Fire Bird King’ graveyard was an open space. This open space was linked by passages from every direction. At the open space’s center, two sides were confronting each other.</p><p>One side had Sun Tianlang and Murong Qingcheng, and the other side had Wind Storm King, Jian Tian, and Iron Hand King.</p><p>“Storm King, we have no enmity or grudges with each other. Why are you looking for trouble with us?” Sun Tianlang was searching for Ye Chen and the rest in the Fire Bird King graveyard. He first found Murong Qingcheng, but didn’t expect that Wind Storm King would obstruct them for no reason.</p><p>Wind Storm King said, “You don’t have the qualifications to make me look for trouble with you. Cut off one of your arms and I’ll let you leave alive. As for her, she will have to stay.”</p><p>“You met Ye Chen?” Murong Qingcheng suddenly said.</p><p>Iron Hand King darkly chuckled, “It’s not good to be too smart, woman. You just need to obediently do what is told.”</p><p>“In your dreams!” Murong Qingcheng’s brows raised and her eyes narrowed.</p><p>“This is not something you can help!”</p><p>Iron Hand King’s huge hand clenched, and a huge iron hand condensed in the void, its five hook-like fingers grabbing at Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>“Demonic Finger!”</p><p>The dark bat wings behind Murong Qingcheng suddenly flapped, setting off a huge gale. Borrowing the power, her body shot in the sky like an arrow. Once airborne, she pointed at the huge iron hand.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>A small hole appeared in the iron palm, and it slightly paused before continuing on.</p><p>“Tiger Roar Palm!”</p><p>Sun Tianlang hesitated a bit, then gnashed his teeth and struck at the iron hand. A tiger roar immediately sounded and a huge black-veined tiger pounced out, shattering the iron palm.</p><p>“You dare to attack.” Iron Hand King murderously stared at Sun Tianlang.</p><p>Summoning his courage, the latter said, “We are one group, so I’ll naturally attack. You better not want a foot after gaining an inch.”</p><p>“You are courting death! Wind Storm King, can I leave this person to you?” Iron Hand King could deal with both, but he didn’t wish to waste much time, and thus asked for help.</p><p>“Sure!” Wind Storm King pointed his hand toward Sun Tianlang, creating a black tornado.</p><p>“Escape, quick!”</p><p>Sun Tianlang knew that he was not the Wind Storm King’s opponent His figure hurriedly retreated as he shouted towards Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>“Can you escape?”</p><p>Every passage at the open space’s edge was blocked by a black tornado. The tornados kept increasing in number, layering over one other and turning the open space into an air-tight prison. Not to mention ordinary half-step Kings, even renowned half-step Kings wouldn’t be able to instantly charge out or come in.</p><p>“Even if you capture me, you’ll have to pay a price…Soul Extinguishing Ripple!”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng extended her right hand, condensing a black light sphere. With a forceful clench, the black light radiated out in a fan shape, battering the three individuals.</p><p>Iron Hand King and Storm King remained unfazed, but Jiang Tian’s face turned pale, and he couldn’t help but retreat three steps.</p><p>“Eh, an offensive soul martial skill! A pity that its level is too low.”</p><p>The Wind Storm King was astonished. How could he not tell that this move was one of the rare offensive soul martial skills? Unfortunately, he and Iron Hand King were both half-step Kings, and their soul had already transformed gradually, developing a soul membrane which could isolate the majority of soul attacks. And although Jiang Tian was not a half-step King, he cultivated the Runic Annihilation Incantation, and had quite a deep understanding of soul attacks.</p><p>“Using soul attacks before us is like an apprentice showing off before a master. Runic Puppet Incantation!”</p><p>Jiang Tian revealed a sinister smile and silently chanted as numerous formless runes suddenly attacked Murong Qigngcheng. These formless runes were warping about but resembled a human figure, looking extremely strange.</p><p>“Didn’t expect Tian-er to have even cultivated the Runic Puppet Incantation.” Wind Storm King sighed in admiration. Runic Annihilation Incantation was used for soul attacks, and Runic Puppet Incantation was used for control. Once Puppet Incantation runes entered one’s brain, one would immediately lose control of their body, losing control of his or her life. These two incantations were not created by Space Emperor, but actually came from the Puppet Sect. It was actually a tightly guarded secret of the Puppet Sect.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng’s face changed dramatically. As the name implied, Runic Puppet Incantation was used to control people. She obviously wouldn’t be controlled. With a soft shout, she extended both hands, instantly letting out the second Soul Extinguishing Wave. An enormous black light superimposed over each other and radiated out toward the formless runes.</p><p>Pupupupu!</p><p>The Soul Extinguishing Wave was an offensive soul move, and Runic Puppet Incantation controlled souls. Therefore, even though the former’s level was inferior to the latter, they countered each other. Soft explosions rang out in the void as the runes were destroyed one after another.</p><p>However, the strongest rune entered Murong Qingcheng’s brain and occupied her Sea of Soul, trying to wrest away the control of her soul. A trail of blood streaked down her mouth as she steered her demonic soul, resisting the runes. The region above her Sea of Soul dyed into a ceramic glaze.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>On the other side, Sun Tianlang’s condition was also not looking good. Hit by one of Wind Storm King’s gale spears, he was blasted off spurting out of blood as he crashed into the ground.</p><p>“You people are too excessive, thinking you can do whatever you please.” Sun Tianlang said furiously.</p><p>“Excessive is what’s about to come.”</p><p>The Wind Storm King disregarded Sun Tianlang’s threat. Raising his right hand, a gale spear condensed. Once this gale spear was released, Sun Tianlang would undoubtedly die.</p><p>Rip!</p><p>Right at this moment, the layers of tornado surrounding the land was violently cut through by a sword Qi, issuing a tearing sound.</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>The Wind Storm King and the other two turned their heads.</p><p>To pierce layers of tornados with one sword strike, Wind Storm King didn’t dare look down on such strength. The three of them subconsciously considered that some powerful half-step King was passing through, who would naturally not take a detour seeing that this place was sealed off.</p><p>Shua!</p><p>A figure shot across, appearing by Murong Qingcheng’s side in a blink of an eye.</p><p>“It’s you!” Jiang Tian blurted out.</p><p>“Kid, I didn’t think you wouldn’t die after being beaten in such a manner. That’s fine too! Since you’ve delivered yourself, don’t blame us.”</p><p>It was impossible for the Wind Storm King and Iron Hand King to not be astonished. They were quite clear what kind of injury Ye Chen had received. If an ordinary half-step King had received such injuries, he or she would have dropped dead long ago. Ye Chen, however, had not only completely recovered, his cultivation base and strength seemed to have been greatly increased.</p><p>Of course, they were only surprised. Regardless of how powerful Ye Chen had become, they were no ordinary half-step Kings.</p><p>“You can leave behind your last words.”</p><p>With these words, Ye Chen immediately raised two fingers of his right hand and touched Murong Qingcheng’s forehead. The Immortal Sword Intent slowly moved inside his Sea of Soul and poured into streams, entering her Sea of Soul through his fingers.</p><p>The Immortal Sword Intent was the most mystical sword intent. Even though the current one’s grade was inferior to Destruction Sword Intent, in terms of defensive capability, it was far above the latter. Moreover, Ye Chen didn’t dare pour the Destruction Sword Intent into Murong Qingcheng’s Sea of Soul, as the slightest mishap would destroy her soul.</p><p>With the help of Immortal Sword Intent, Murong Qingcheng eventually eliminated the remaining runes and opened her eyes.</p><p>“I’m fine!”</p><p>Ye Chen nodded at Murong Qingcheng and retracted his hand.</p><p>“Hehe, you sure can boast!” The Iron Hand King laughed as if he had heard the funniest joke. A man who had been like a dying dog a week ago dared to utter such arrogant words! He simply didn’t know how to ridicule the latter. He could only think that his stupidity had reached another level.</p><p>“Ye Chen, don’t be rash!”</p><p>Sun Tianlang could feel Ye Chen’s strength, but the opponents were no ordinary half-step Kings, but the powerful Wind Storm King and Iron Hand King. When they joined hands, even a peak half-step King could only escape.</p><p>“Elder Brother Sun, many thanks!” Ye Chen said sincerely. Sun Tianlang could have easily escaped by his own, but he didn’t do so.</p><p>“Not at all! Although I, Sun Tianlang, am not a good man, I keep my words. I owe my life to you people.” Sun Tianlang said resolutely.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
