Although these people were not as reputed as Master Sky Sword, they were all ranked within top ten or thirty amongst the master-grade sword artists.</p><p>“Master’s been injured!”</p><p>Master Tempest Sword’s age was more than seventy, but he still seemed in the prime of his life. His mouth was wide open and face had an expression of disbelief. When Ye Chen defeated Master Sky Sword, he had also found about it. However, according to his master, Ye Chen defeated the latter with the Defensive Sword Art. If not for this technique, they were merely equals. However, this West Ocean Sword Master seemed to have easily injured his Master now. The difference seemed too big.</p><p>Dozens of li across, Master Sky Sword stopped his retreating body. His corner of mouth was bleeding, seeming like a wriggling snake.</p><p>“What a move, Transposing Ocean Sword Qi! This is the most majestic and rich sword move I’ve ever seen. Blue is made from indigo, but is brighter, it’s indeed true for you. You’ve far surpassed your master.”</p><p>Master Sky Sword’s face turned grave. In a confrontation among Master grade sword artists, this was the first time he’d felt so suppressed. Even against Ye Chen, the latter had gained advantage using the Defensive Sword Control Art. In a true life and death battle, even if Ye Chen were to kill him, the latter wouldn’t come out of it much better.</p><p>“En? Still have the power to fight?”</p><p>Liu Wujian was somewhat astonished. His move contained the Wind and Water profounds, among which, water profound had already achieved minor success while wind profound was close to it. When combined, its might surpassed that of mid grade profound battle skills. Adding the ingenious application of strength, no martial skill of same level could resist it.</p><p>“As luck would have it, I’ve made progress in Sky Sword Style. Let me try it out on you!” Master Sky Sword said indifferently.</p><p>“Haha!”</p><p>Hearing his words, Liu Wujian laughed heartily, “Using me to test a move? I’m afraid your move won’t enter my eyes at all. But, let me give you one chance…Do your best!”</p><p>Greater the skill, more the courage. Liu Wujian quietly waited to see Master Sky Sword’s strongest move.</p><p>Master Sky Sword didn’t get angry either. He stretched his right hand out which held his longsword erect before his chest, seeming as if he was performing a great sword ritual. His expression completely serene.</p><p>“Sword Of Understanding.”</p><p>The longsword slashed out, unleashing Master Sky Sword’s newest created move.</p><p>Nobody could describe how fast this sword was. This sword seemed to have stopped time itself, stagnating even one’s thoughts. Liu Wujian, who bore the full brunt of this move, could feel the terror of this move the most. If Master Sky Sword’s previous move was enough to raise his interest, this move carried a little danger to him.</p><p>“Extreme Kill, Thread Of Thousand Li!”</p><p>Master Sky Sword had the Sword Of Understanding, but Liu Wujian had his own hidden cards. Until now, he hadn’t been serious. The sharp longsword in his hand danced in the air unrestrained. Suddenly, a white-colored thread spread out, pervading everywhere like the line created at the horizon of the ocean and sky—vast, distant, and unattainable.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>Master Sky Sword’s move was extremely powerful. His sword Qi condensed into a straight thread, and Liu Wujian’s move was also more or less the same, similarly condensing into a straight thread. However, when the two moves met, the one to collapse was nevertheless the Sword of Understanding. This was because the power supporting Liu Wenjian’s move was too excessive, seeming boundless. No matter how strong Sword of Understanding was, it couldn’t stand up to it.</p><p>“What a deep water profound!”</p><p>Master Sky Sword’s eyes shrunk into dots. How could he not tell that Liu Wujian had again used wind and water profound? However, different to Transposing Ocean Sword Qi, Thousand Li Thread relied primarily on water profound, exhibiting it vividly and thoroughly. Confronting this move, one felt as if their body was inside a great ocean. They could see the sky and water meeting at the horizon, but regardless of how fast they moved, they could never reach there.</p><p>Creak!</p><p>Thousand Li Thread crushed the Sword of Understanding and struck Master Sky Sword, who was unable to dodge in time, on the chest. The next moment, a huge metal ringing sound rang out. Master Sky Sword spurted out a mouthful of blood and shot back, his hair chaotically dancing about. However, this time was different. This time, he’d suffered a serious injury. His five viscera and six bowels seemed to have almost moved from their places, and his blood seemed to have reversed in flow.</p><p>“To make me use Thousand Li Wire, you can be proud of yourself. However, your potential has already been exhausted. From now on, the difference between you and me will only increase.”</p><p>Sheathing his longsword back, Liu Wujian turned toward the majestic young man and multicolor-robed woman, “We’re leaving!”</p><p>Shua Shua Shua!</p><p>With that, the three disappeared into the horizon like a flickering light.</p><p>“Master, are you alright?” Master Tempest Sword promptly rushed over to Master Sky Sword. The latter’s face was white, but he waved his hand and took a deep breath, “I won’t die.”</p><p>Master Earth Sword sucked in a deep breath and asked, “Senior, what is your judgment on Liu Wujian’s strength?”</p><p>“He’ll probably sweep through all Master Sea of Soul experts in the True Spirit Continent.” Master Sky Sword pondered for a moment and then finally spoke out.</p><p>“What! It can’t be!” Master Earth Sword and Master Yuan Sword were astonished.</p><p>“There is still Ye Chen, no?” Master Earth Sword, Xu Yuan, asked.</p><p>Master Sky Sword smiled bitterly, “During this year, I created Sword of Understanding, which is a major progress. And a year ago, Ye Chen’s strength was only somewhat higher than me. If he made a great progress during this, he could be equal to Liu Wujian at most. I can feel that his strength is a lot more than he showed.”</p><p>Originally, Master Sky Sword believed that Liu Wujian was fighting with full strength. However, once he revealed the Thousand Li Thread, he immediately felt that the latter certainly had more hidden cards. Otherwise, he wouldn’t dare be so arrogant. For Ye Chen to prevail over him would be extremely difficult.</p><p>“This …?” Xu Yuan and Master Yuan Sword exchanged a glance.</p><p>“Sigh…I hope my guess is wrong.” Master Sky Sword shook his head as he stood up with the support of Master Tempest Sword and left.</p><p>“This matter is too grave.”</p><p>Xu Yuan’s face turned cloudy. He was a master of True Spirit Continent and didn’t wish to see masters of the continent being swept by a youngster from the West Ocean.</p><p>“It probably won’t be so bad, right?” Master Yuan Sword said gloomily.</p><p>…</p><p>In the depths of Northern Ocean was a belt of islands in the air. At the center of the island belt was an inverted-conical island. It was vast beyond measure, sheltering lofty mountains, forests, volcanoes, huge rivers, and even plains. At the edges of the island were small and big waterfalls, falling down on the islands underneath. These islands also had waterfalls falling down on the islands even further below. From afar, it seemed nothing short of a paradise. It was as beautiful and elegant as could be imagined.</p><p>On the inverted conical island was a huge palace that occupied several thousand mu. Inside a palace, a middle-aged man and a youngster sat by each other, and before them was a large map of a continent. From the map’s shape and distribution, one could tell at a glance that this map was that of True Spirit Continent.</p><p>Above the model of True Spirit Continent were numerous crystalline threads crisscrossing, covering the entire region above the model. At a quick glance, it would be simply impossible to count the number of threads. They were at least in tens of millions, intertwined amongst each other.</p><p>The middle-aged man slashed his finger, and a ray of light fell at the center of True Spirit Continent, which was the Sky Martial Region.</p><p>“Tian-er, you’ll go to Sky Martial Region!”</p><p>The youngster respectfully said, “Master, why am I going to Sky Martial Region?”</p><p>“If my guess is not wrong, within the next year, the forbidden zone carrying the grave of Four Extremes Emperor will move to Sky Martial Region. You have the Void Shattering Finger’s first style and Sky Scorpion King’s key, which proves that you’re fated with this grave. However, fate is fleeting, and you have to grab it with your own hands.”</p><p>“The grave of Four Extremes Emperor will move to Sky Martial Region?” The youngster sucked in a deep breath and said respectfully, “Yes, Master!”</p><p>“Remember, Void Shattering Finger has four styles, and so are the keys to open the grave. Other three keys must be in the hands of other people. If you can snatch them, do it. If you can’t, work with them. I’ve a feeling that once the four keys are combined, the entrance to Four Extremes Emperor’s burial ground will open.”</p><p>“Rest assured Master, with my strength, apart from half-step Kings and Life and Death Kings, nobody is my opponent.” A cold light flickered in the youngster’s eyes.</p><p>“Master knows your strength best, but Sky Martial Region is a holy ground of geniuses. Perhaps there won’t be anyone that can contend with you, but there will certainly be many who won’t die by your hands.”</p><p>“Not die by my hands?” The youngsters didn’t reply.</p><p>“Alright, you can go!” The middle-aged man waved his hand.</p><p>“Farewell, Master!”</p><p>The youngster turned around and left the palace. He soared into the sky, flying straight in the direction of True Spirit Continent, disappearing into the horizon.</p><p>Once the youngster left, the middle-aged man folded his arms over his chest, “The grave of Four Extremes Emperor, I should probably move too. I wonder what realm the strength of those folks from True Spirit Continent has reached. Don’t make me disappointed…Dragon King will probably end his seclusion as well.”</p><p>With a wave of his hand, the model of True Spirit Continent entered the void, and his figure suddenly disappeared from the palace.</p><p>…</p><p>Emperor Valley…</p><p>Ye Chen and company had left the Emperor Scar Stele long ago. The scar left by Four Extremes Emperor was ever so slightly flickering, seeming like an illusion.</p><p>In the following month, they visited many places, from nature’s bizarre sights to strange terrains formed by huge battles among ancient Kings. After the month, everybody went their separate ways. Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng didn’t return to South Rudra Region. It was already August, only about a month from eighteenth September. If they were to go back and forth, they wouldn’t have enough time, so they might as well stay at Sky Martial Region.</p><p>During this time, the news of West Ocean Sword Master defeating Master Sky Sword had spread out, creating an uproar. Then, the news of his declaration in White Cloud Restaurant also spread out. When the two news were combined, it had a sensational effect. Everybody knew that a Sword Master named Liu Wujian had come from West Ocean. Apart from avenging his Master, he will also have a meeting with the geniuses of True Spirit Continent on eighteenth September.</p><p>West Ocean Sword Master, Continent Sword Master…this was a juicy matter!</p><p>Moreover, coupled with Liu Wujian’s wild words, Nine Dragon Lake once again turned lively after two years. This time, the number of people arriving at Nine Dragon Lake would most likely far surpass the previous time. This time was different, as the honor of True Spirit Continent was on the line. If all the geniuses were defeated by Liu Wujian, it would tantamount to admitting that True Spirit Continent was inferior to West Ocean, which would be the beginning of the continent’s deterioration.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
