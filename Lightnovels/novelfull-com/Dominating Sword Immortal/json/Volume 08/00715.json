Before Mysterious Queen reached Life and Death Realm, it was only a rank 6 martial school, and its power could not compete with the other rank 5 schools at all. There were barely any semi king warriors or top master level warriors. Adding Yan Fengfeng, there were only three of them.</p><p>\"Feng'er, that Ye Chen you are talking about…Does he really almost have semi king warrior level power?\" It was a beautiful middle-aged lady that was speaking. Her qi was so deep that it was impossible to tell exactly how powerful she was. Looking at her with soul power, she looked like the eye of a tornado.</p><p>Yan Fengfeng nodded, \"Yes, I have seen it with my own eyes.\"</p><p>The middle-aged lady was the great master of the school, Qing Liu, and was a semi king warrior herself as well. Her status in the school was very high, as she used to be the leader of the school, the teacher of Mysterious Queen. After the latter reached Life and Death Realm, she gave away her position to her proudest disciple and became a great master herself.</p><p>Hearing her, Qing Liu thought about it and said, \"We do not have many people on our side, so we can invite him over.\"</p><p>Although she was a demi king warrior, if they ran into another powerful group of people, she might not be able to protect the others.</p><p>\"Alright.\" Yan Fengfeng thought about it before nodding.</p><p>…</p><p>For the past few days, Murong Qingcheng did not hear much about the vibration since they were too far away from the source. The two were not in a hurry either, since the Sky Martial Region was only this big. They knew they should be getting information soon in a couple of days.</p><p>With this opportunity, Ye Chen continued to train his five sword attack, trying to get it to the next level.</p><p>On this particular day, Yan Fengfeng and Qing Liu came to the city Ye Chen was staying at the time.</p><p>Inside the yard, the five of them sat in the pavilion at the center of that green water.</p><p>\"Ye Chen greets Senior Qing Liu.\"</p><p>After knowing Wing Liu's identity, Ye Chen was a bit surprised. He had not expected that this person before him was Mysterious Queen's teacher, the former leader of the Mysterious School.</p><p>Qing Liu laughed, \"Do not be so alarmed. Qingxuan thought very highly of you. She said that you are the top warrior with the highest possibility of reaching Life and Death Realm within five years.\"</p><p>\"Five years? Senior Yan has flattered me.\" Ye Chen forced a laugh. Although he knew that he would be able to make it to Life and Death Realm, he did not have the confidence to say that it would happen within five years. It would be too much of a dream.</p><p>Qing Liu said, \"Do not underestimate Qingxuan's belief. Whatever she said is very likely to come true…I have seen it many times now.\"</p><p>\"Then I will thank senor Yan for this.\" Ye Chen chuckled.</p><p>Taking a sip of the tea, Qing Liu asked, \"Ye Chen, what rank of sword intent are you at? Feng'er said you have the destruction sword intent. Is it true?\"</p><p>Ye Chen said, \"Indeed…It is the rank 5 destruction sword intent.\"</p><p>Although she had already heard about Ye Chen from Yan Fengfeng, but Qing Liu was still very surprised upon hearing it directly from him. Rank 5 destruction sword intent would have the power that was equivalent to rank 6 normal sword intent. It was the kind that even some Life and Death Realm warriors might not have.</p><p>\"Indeed a respectable apprentice! Qingxuan was one, and you are as well.\" Qing Liu said with emotion.</p><p>Ye Chen asked, \"Senior Qingqiu, this time you came here for?\"</p><p>Yan Fengfeng answered for Qing Liu, \"Ye Chen, do you know what is the source of that vibration?\"</p><p>\"I have been looking for more information. But, what is it?\"</p><p>\"The graveyard for the Four Extreme Emperors has revealed itself, and the vibration was caused by the moving forbidden place hitting the space blockade. Right now, the Sky Martial Region's rank 5 martial institutions should all know about it. The rest of them might still need a while though. My teacher and I want to go there and check it out. Therefore, I would like to invite you and Murong Qingchen to join us. What do you say?\"</p><p>Four Extreme Emperors Grave?</p><p>Ye Chen did not think too much into it as he nodded and said, \"Alright!\"</p><p>He carried the third movement of the Void Shattering Finger Art and an Aries white key. The graveyard might be his opportunity, so he surely would not let it go. Even if they did not come to invite him, he would have gone himself after gathering all of the information.</p><p>Qing Liu said, \"This time's journey will be extremely dangerous. There will be a lot of semi king warriors there. Although some of them might never be able to reach the Life and Death Realm, their power should not be underestimated. Therefore, it might be critically dangerous there.\"</p><p>\"I understand.\" Ye Chen nodded. He was not far from Late Seas of Souls Realm, and there was just that one thin layer of obstacle stopping him from making that breakthrough. With this opportunity, he might be able to finally get what he had been wanting. Once he reached Late Seas of Souls Realm, even if he ran into half step king warriors, he would be able to escape safely. As for some of the weaker ones, he might even be able to compete with them.</p><p>\"Murong, what about you?\" Ye Chen was a bit worried about Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>\"I will go with you.\" She answered.</p><p>\"Alright!\"</p><p>Although Ye Chen was worried that Murong Qingcheng might be in danger if she joined, he also knew that she was not weaker than anyone with her survival skills. Not to mention her perfect demi demon bloodline and demon power, there was still quite a lot demon power essence in her body, which was a king warrior level demon power. With her endurance now, once she used it, it might be even more powerful than ever before.</p><p>Just like that, the five of them headed over toward the Ruin Mountains.</p><p>Before, Yan Fengfeng and Qing Liu might not be as powerful, but adding Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng to the mix, their power reached the next level as a group. Yan Fengfeng was already one of the top five warriors in the master ranking, Murong Qingcheng's demon qi was aggressive as well. And then there was Ye Chen, an invincible warrior below the semi king warrior realm. No matter who they ran into, they would not be much weaker either, unless they had two semi step king warriors.</p><p>By the time they reached the deep end of the mountains, it was already one week later.</p><p>\"Haha, Mysterious King, you are here as well!\"</p><p>In the distance, seven human figures flew over as they carried a hint of evilness, giving people a mysterious feel.</p><p>\"Gold Absolute King, you can be here and I cannot?\"</p><p>Qing Liu's title was Mysterious King. As all of the semi king warriors were future potential Life and Death Realm king warriors, hence they had the \"king\" titles. However, the man she addressed as Gold Absolute King was the great master from the Evil King Pavilion, who was the uncle of Evil King. His power was also mysterious, and he used to be a staunch opponent of hers.</p><p>Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!</p><p>Jin Juewant landed on the mountain that was not far away. He glanced at Qing Liu and the people standing next to her, then laughed, \"Five people…not bad! I thought there might only be three to four of you.\"</p><p>\"Too many people might not necessarily be a good thing. It is about the quality and not the quantity.\" Qing Liu said with a smile.</p><p>\"Haha, no matter how good you are with words, I, Evil King, have always been above you. Talking about being elite, I am way ahead of you for sure.\"</p><p>The Gold Absolute King had not been out for a long time now. No one had mentioned to him about Ye Chen yet, so he had never heard about the latter and his stories.</p><p>Right next to him were six other people, two of whom were youngsters, two being in their middle-ages, and another two elders. One of the two young warriors actually recognized Ye Chen. He was indeed Sikong Sheng, who had not been out for a while either. Right now, he had that dull look on his face instead of that invincible sharpness from before. With Ye Chen's observation skills, it was not hard for him to tell that Sikong Sheng recognized him from the past. But, what was surprising was that the former did not make any microexpressions at all.</p><p>'Sikong Sheng being here means that he has finally reached the top master level. I wonder what exact level he has reached.'</p><p>It was not that Ye Chen was underestimating Sikong Sheng, just that he had seen so many powerful martial geniuses inside the Sky Martial Region that nothing really surprised him anymore. Sikong Sheng's talent would not be ranked even in the top 10. Therefore, the fact that he now was at top master level warrior level surprised him.</p><p>Right next to Sikong Sheng was a young man with a tattoo on his face. He was not as numb as Sikong Sheng actually; instead, he was studying Ye Chen curiously, giving people a feel that nothing was really important to him.</p><p>\"It might not be the case. Now is different from before. We will leave for now.\"</p><p>Qing Liu did not plan to continue verbally arguing with the warrior, so she flew toward the crack. At the same time, Ye Chen and the other three followed behind her.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Around the edge, the energy could sense that there was a powerful entity approaching. Hence, it released countless beams of lightning toward them, which landed on the five. Before their trip, Qing Liu had already reminded the three to watch out for the surreal energy. Therefore, the four warriors behind her were not surprised at all as they started to augment their protective Zhen yuan while maintaining their speed.</p><p>\"Watch out!\"</p><p>Ye Chen flashed once, blocking on the right side of Murong Qingchen where there were more attacks. The latter said with a pale face, \"I am alright.\"</p><p>Although her protective demon power was very powerful, much more so than normal peak level Late Seas of Souls Realm warriors, since she still did not have a semi extreme rank protective armor, it would not be easy for her to handle the power. Luckily, she still had the Darkness Sky, which had a great effect of absorbing energy.</p><p>As for Ye Chen, although his cultivation was not that high and only at the peak of Mid Sea of Souls Realm, he had his semi extreme armor and the dragon bone's protection. Adding his immortal body, it seemed rather easy for him to handle the surreal power attacks.</p><p>Meanwhile, Yan Fengfeng's true form was that of a blue phoenix, with her top quality power. She had reached from rank 9 to rank 10 within the past two years, and would also be considered a tyrant level beast amongst them all. She was so powerful that it was almost impossible to imagine. The protective beast power was not weaker than Murong Qingcheng's protective demon power. Added with that, she had also had a semi extreme rank armor inside the treasure tower, which was another addon.</p><p>The one warrior that was having the toughest time was indeed an elder of the Mysterious Mountain, who was not that weak in his cultivation, which was at peak level Late Sea of Souls Realm. But unfortunately, he did not have a semi extreme rank armor. So, he could only use his Zhen yuan layer to fight it as blood leaked out from the corner of his lips.</p><p>Within a blink of an eye, the five had endured dozens rounds of attacks. They disappeared completely into the crack without a single one of them dying.</p><p>\"Huh! No wonder so arrogant.\" The Gold Absolute King wanted to witness some failure, but he just couldn't today.</p><p>\"Gold Absolute King, the Mysterious Master has been catching up to you. I think that level of arrogance was kind of justified.\" Another group of people arrived right at that moment.</p><p>They all wore light colored clothes, and a massive \"hell\" character was embroidered on the five's chests. Although one of them did not have it, there were similar styled symbols on their sleeves. Their power could only be more than the Evil King Martial School's. The leader Evil King was also a king warrior from the same era as the Surreal King. Their cultivation was comparable to the old Dragon King. Meanwhile, the Hell King inherited the Hell ancestor's legacy, and was specialized in making seals. His most powerful martial art was the Sky Hell Sealing Major Art, which was horrifying powerful.</p><p>Back when he was with Lin Tian, the Mu Yunhe who had arguments with Ye Chen was indeed the head disciple of the Hell Martial School. But amongst the six of them, he was not there.</p><p>\"Hey, long time no see!\"</p><p>Gold Absolute King squinted his eyes. If the Mysterious King Qing Liu had an unimaginable power, it would only be relative to the Evil King, whom he was more afraid of. He was a born killer who had learned the Hell Sealing Art. Even if he could beat the other in a battle, he would still be wounded badly.</p><p>\"Hehe, long time no see! However, this will not be the time for us to talk. I will go in now. You people better not interfere or try to fight for things with us. Otherwise, I will show you what we can do.\"</p><p>\"We will see who loses.\"</p><p>Gold Absolute King was not the kind of person who would be scared by threats, as he said indifferently.</p><p>\"Haha! I will see you inside then!\"</p><p>The former laughed as he entered the forbidden place. On their way there, one of them was wounded badly to the extent of puking a huge amount of blood.</p><p>\"Let's go in as well.\" Ultimately, Gold Absolute King took his people to enter the crack as well.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
