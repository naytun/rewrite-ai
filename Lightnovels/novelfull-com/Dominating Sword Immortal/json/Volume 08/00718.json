Let me prepare my killing attack.”</p><p>Qing Liu was a half step king warrior, and she had a lot of tricks up her sleeves. Although her profound martial arts might not be as powerful as other top master level warriors, half step king warriors’ Zhen yuan was nothing the latter could compete with. After spending some time, her killing attacks could contain more Zhen yuan, and its devastating power would intensify drastically.</p><p>“Yes, teacher!”</p><p>Yan Fengfeng would not dare to react too slow as she twisted her body in the midair, turning into a phoenix full of green flames. She roared into the sky as she flapped her wings. With that, two massive flame columns attacked toward the half step scorpion king from both right and left, blowing it dozens of meters away.</p><p>“Sky Demon Finger!”</p><p>A pair of black wings grew out of Murong Qingcheng’s back. Meanwhile, black light poured into her body through her wings before accumulating on her right hand fingertips.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>A black finger power turned into a black colored small sun which landed right on the head of the scorpion king.</p><p>“Major Sword Spell!”</p><p>The Defensive sword spell was a type of sword spell where the first and second level of attacks were all very simple. But starting from the third level, the attacking style would change dramatically. Besides shooting out multiple sword attacks at the same time, some other unique attacking sword spells would be included as well. And the Major Sword Spell was one of them.</p><p>Ye Chen pointed out his sword fingers, which caused the gold sword to shoot out into the air. Meanwhile, the gold sword’s Zhen yuan suddenly expanded, accumulating into a massive sword shadow as it attacked toward the half step scorpion king.</p><p>Chin!</p><p>Sparks spilled everywhere. This sword had not only cut through the demon power shield, it had also left a light sword mark on the opponent’s back.</p><p>“Powerful!”</p><p>Ye Chen nodded; the massive sword spell’s natural attacking power was not as powerful as the flying swords. But, one positive side of the major sword spell was that it had a very powerful aura and physical power, which could blow away the target. Inside their vision, the half step scorpion king’s body scrambled on the ground.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>A black shadow shot out of nowhere, which was the tailhook of the scorpion beast.</p><p>“I will help you!”</p><p>Ye Chen’s body drew a curve in the air, approaching the scorpion’s tail from the side. Meanwhile, he took out the Thunder Disaster sword and threw out a powerful attack.</p><p>Chin! Chin! Chin! Chin! Chin!</p><p>The tail of the beast did not slow down, but instead, it sped up drastically, the tailhook almost hitting right on the elder’s head.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Lin Gaoming threw out a punch on the tail hook, reverting the critical danger.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Right then, Qing Liu had finished preparing her killing attack. As she lifted up her right hand, circles of halo formed around her palms. In the center of the halo was a blue energy core which contained all of the power.</p><p>“Go!” Qing Liu made a noise as she threw out a palm attack.</p><p>Whoo! Whoo!</p><p>The attack made an air-slicing sound and landed on the scorpion beast’s forehead heavily. The halo around it was like a steel blade that continued cutting the beast power shield. By the time the halo’s power ran out completely, the shield of the beast had been broken open already, and the dark blue energy core crawled within.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>In the next second, the head of the scorpion beast exploded; its body continued twitching until it disappeared completely.</p><p>“Impressive!” Ye Chen thought to himself how powerful this attack was and then finally understood why it would need this long to prepare.</p><p>After killing the scorpion beast, the five got to move forward without any obstacles. There was nothing else blocking their ways.</p><p>…</p><p>“Tornado Wind Spear!”</p><p>Over on the other side of the scorpion spell, the skinny elder had finally finished preparing as well. He held a long spear made from the black tornado wind in his hand. It continued vibrating, the tip of the spear expanding and stretching out like the tongue of a poisonous snake.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>The skinny elder shot out the long spear toward the scorpion king.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The beast was punctured through instantly before it was then torn into pieces by the wind blades that exploded out from the attack.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The elder’s face was slightly blushed; he seemed to have burned a lot of his energy.</p><p>…</p><p>After the bad environment came a layer of twisted Zhen yuan which reflected a lot of different sceneries.</p><p>Whoo! Whoo!</p><p>Ye Chen and the other four hesitated a little before jumping within. It was like going through a layer of water but not getting wet. The five appeared in a brand-new environment.</p><p>Gasp!</p><p>The five were shocked as they took in a deep breath.</p><p>In their vision, the scenery seemed to have widened. Wherever one looked, there would be a lake, a grassland, and strange looking mountains. Stringy white clouds floated across the sky, connecting with the tall mountains from afar. Lifting up their head, the sky could not be clearer; the natural yuan was so rich that it could wake a normal warrior up for days and save days of hard work with a simple breath.</p><p>It was still not the most shocking part. The most shocking thing was the spirit plants and trees here.</p><p>On the grassland, the plants were rich and well-grown; countless green plants were surprisingly green and thriving. After some distance, another spiritual plant containing a huge amount of spirit qi could be found. The spirt qi coming out of the plants nourished the normal plants around as well, making each plant even livelier.</p><p>On the lake were lively lotuses, on which, flowers of different color competed to be the most colorful kind. Each flower had valuable medicinal effects. The fishes under the lotuses also had rich spirit qi.</p><p>From further away, one could see the green trees continuing to grow, where low rank spirit trees were not the minority. In the deeper parts, the mid rank spirit trees stood out from everyone else, and in the even deeper parts, some sky-rocketing trees were visible as well. Although it would be impossible to tell what kind of ranking they were at, it was obvious that they were not normal trees.</p><p>All of the spirit plants and trees here were obviously better than the lake and forest area, each mountain shind with visibly bright spirit lights.</p><p>“This is the seven star blue that is already extinct outside.”</p><p>Qing Liu was indeed a former leader of a martial school, and she knew a lot about spirit plants and trees. She squatted down and carefully scooped out a light blue plant with starlight shining around. Judging by the spirit qi, this plant should be a low rank one. But, given that it was already extinct outside, it would be extremely valuable to have. If she could take it outside to grow properly, then she could grow plenty of them back.</p><p>After harvesting dozens of them, she stood up while putting all of them into a storage ring with a plant pattern on top.</p><p>She turned around and found that Ye Chen was putting some spirit plants into his storage ring. She chuckled and said, “In order to grow spirit plants, you could need a lot of soil. If you put it in a pot, then it will not have as good of an effect. I have an extra plant storage ring, here you go.”</p><p>As she spoke, she took out another ring and threw it to Ye Chen.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Ye Chen had heard about this type of ring before. A normal storage ring would be great for storing objects, but the plant ring would be good to grow spirit plants, since it would be very spacious and filled with soil. On top, some sun stones could be held there to give the “sunshine” these plants needed. One low rank plant ring would be more valuable and pricier than normal mid rank storage rings. One might not be able to buy one even if one had the money.</p><p>After taking over the plant ring, Ye Chen carved on his soul print and entered the surreal space with his soul power. It was a massive space, and some sun stones were already hung on top while the ground was filled with black soil with minimal spirit qi. It was obvious that this ring had not been used for a long time. It would need spirit stones to nourish the soil.</p><p>“Thank you, senior!” Ye Chen thanked her officially.</p><p>“Don’t worry about it! Qingxuan is so appreciative of you, I, as her teacher, will not be stingy either for sure.” She chuckled and continued searching for more spirit plants.</p><p>With the ring, Ye Chen knew that he needed to put in more effort into the spirit plants. He only picked the rare or already-extinct low rank spirit plants to put inside, ten of each. As for the mid rank ones, he would take as many as there were. Meanwhile, for the top rank ones, he surely would not want to miss out on anything.</p><p>As they came in front of a lake, Qing Liu took some of the floating greens and lotuses. It seemed like her plant ring was way fancier than the one she gave to Ye Chen, since his did not have ponds for those plants.</p><p>The five of them walked in a straight line, but did not try to search for spirit plants on purpose. Soon, a small forest blocked their path.</p><p>“Low rank maple tree!”</p><p>Qing Liu’s eyes brightened. She made a grabbing gesture, and a whole maple tree was taken out of the ground, which she then put it into her plant ring.</p><p>“Low rank Snake Pattern Tree!”</p><p>“Low rank Pine tree!”</p><p>With rankings, the spirit trees were super easy to find. Wherever the five went, countless spirit trees were pulled up and stored into Qing Liu’s ring. Ye Chen’s ring was not big enough, so he only picked one low rank rare spirit pine tree.</p><p>However, on seeing that half of the ring’s storage had been taken up by the tree, he shook his head and put the tree back where he took it from. There must be mid rank ones soon, so he thought he should not dwell on a low rank one.</p><p>Mid rank spirit trees were bigger than low rank ones. Of course, some of the small ones were there as well, but even the small ones were way bigger than normal trees. After another while, even Qing Liu had to stop her collecting spree since her ring was filling up as well.</p><p>“My plant ring is only a peak mid rank one, with five hundred acres of area only. According to the legends, the best top rank plant ring would have five thousand acres, while an extreme rank one would have fifty thousand acres. If I had an extreme rank plant ring, I could take all of these valuable plants then.” Qing Liu was a bit frustrated.</p><p>Ye Chen said, “Senior, let’s go check out what’s in front.”</p><p>Low rank spirit trees and mid rank ones, Ye Chen did not take any of them. If there were a high rank one, then he knew he would not miss out on it for sure, since it would be so valuable that no price could be placed on it. It would be at least worth a couple million top rank spirit stones.</p><p>“Alright!’ Hearing that, Qing Liu got excited again.</p><p>The white fog still surrounded the place, and the five of them flew on top of the forest as they spread out their soul power.</p><p>“Hm? A top rank spirit tree?”</p><p>Ye Chen with his extremely powerful soul power could sense that in the deep parts of the forest was a wave of rich spirit qi spreading out consistently. It was shockingly powerful, almost as powerful as that half step extreme rank long life tree he saw in the ruin ancient place. The normal trees around that area were also growing into spirit trees as well.</p><p>Even if this tree might not be a high rank spirit tree, it would at least be at the peak of mid rank. Of course, it would lean more towards being a high rank one; otherwise, the spirit qi would not be this rich.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
