Shua! Shua!</p><p>Above the boundless black ocean, numerous light beams streaked across swiftly.</p><p>When Ye Chen was robbing the fourth Devouring island, Black Water Alliance had already dispatched experts. Since the distance between the islands was neither too large nor too small, they arrived at the fourth island when Ye Chen had already looted the island.</p><p>“Good grief! Seems like these two don’t care about my Black Water Alliance at all.” Seeing the destruction before his eyes, a half-step king beside Sima Zonguan squinted his eyes and said in a deep voice.</p><p>The latter replied, “For decades, there have been many to challenge my Black Water Alliance, but not one has succeeded.”</p><p>“Zonguan, these two surely know that the Devouring islands are under the control of our Blackwater Alliance. Since they dared to do this, they must have a few tricks. We can’t be careless!” A thin, haggard old man reminded Sima Zonguan.</p><p>The latter faintly nodded, “I understand. Lion crushes a rabbit with full strength. Go all out…hold nothing back.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Numerous Blackwater experts roared together.</p><p>…</p><p>On the way to the fifth island, Ye Chen suddenly stopped and said indifferently, “They are here.”</p><p>“This Blackwater Alliance seems to view us quite highly. All the experts they sent are half-step Kings.” Murong Qingcheng also focused on the streaks of lights in the distance.</p><p>Ye Chen said, “Peak Masters wouldn’t have any use even if they came. The Blackwater Alliance likely understands this.”</p><p>A group of peak Masters could kill an ordinary half-step King and resist renowned half-step Kings. However, they couldn’t do anything before a peak half-step King. Not to mention, the Flame Burst King defeated by Ye Chen was an absolute expert among peak Kings.</p><p>Dozens of lights arrived, stopping a few li away from Ye Chen.</p><p>“State your name!” One half-step King shouted sternly.</p><p>‘</p><p>“I assume everybody here is a Blackwater Alliance expert. I wonder what business you have with me?” Ye Chen asked back.</p><p>Sima Zonguan’s brows creased, “These islands are under the rule of my Blackwater Alliance. You are robbing Zhen Yuan crystals with complete disregard to the rules here. You tell me what business we have with you.”</p><p>“Under your rule?” Ye Chen feigned surprise, “I had no idea.”</p><p>“Kid, don’t be arrogant! Give up yourself up without resisting and you can have your life.” Some fiery half-step Kings couldn’t bear Ye Chen’s tone and said furiously.</p><p>Ye Chen faintly smiled, “I only know that the Devouring islands are ruled by the holy spirit. Your Blackwater Alliance has fooled the holy spirit, making the people here do hard labor for you. These black powers are all leeches sucking people’s blood. Me robbing their Zhen Yuan crystals is merely enacting heaven’s providence.”</p><p>“Good, enacting heaven’s providence! Then, you should know that the strong preying on the weak is one of the eternal rules of the heavenly dao.” Sima Zonguan said expressionlessly.</p><p>“Correct, the strong preying on the weak is eternal! Some fight due to their differing views. But between me and you, there is no right and wrong…only the strong preying on the weak.” Rules were merely an excuse, strong preying on weak was the quintessential truth.</p><p>“Well said! A few can see so deeply,” Sima Zonguan shook his head, “But, you’re a fool. You shouldn’t have provoked Blackwater Alliance…Go!” With a wave of his hands, dozens of half-step Kings behind him charged forth.</p><p>The first to launch the assault was a fiendish middle-aged man with withering yellow hair. His meaty palm chopped at Ye Chen like a huge fan. A huge palm impression formed into the black Ocean underneath, and a majestic Qi energy pressed down like a small mountain.</p><p>Following behind him closely was the withered old man beside Sima Zonguan. He sucked in a deep breath, causing the air around him to distort, while he himself turned extremely fat. Even his face turned completely round, looking like a huge balloon. With a thunderous roar, he punched out, the fierce fist energy raising a terrifyingly gargantuan wave in the ocean.</p><p>At the same time, fiery Qi, layers upon layers of phantoms, a dazzling golden blade Qi, piercing spear light, and other attacks came in like a rainstorm, not leaving any room for Ye Chen to dodge.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Ye Chen pulled out the Thunder Disaster Sword and faced them without retreating or advancing. He first chopped a golden ripple at the fiendish middle-aged man, causing him to spurt out a huge mouthful of blood. Then, he swiftly slashed at the old man who had turned into a fatty, making his arm bloody. At the same time, he pointed his right hand in the air, shattering the fiery Qi and fiercely striking the half-step King. As for the phantoms, they brushed past his body without being able to injure his body at all. The golden blade light was also cleaved into two with but a finger, greatly reducing its might.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng was not idle either, exchanging blows with a spear artist half-step King. The two exchanged blows at an extremely high rate. Their bodies turned into countless figures, leaving behind only black claws and spear light colliding in the void without a glimpse of their real bodies.</p><p>“This kid is too strong!”</p><p>The middle-aged man who had been blasted off by the chop stabilized his figure and discovered that his internal organs all had received substantial injuries and his battle power had greatly decreased. And this was still because the opponent was battling many simultaneously and couldn’t focus his offense. Otherwise, the power of this blow would have been at least ten times greater.</p><p>“My Air Battle Body was broken!” The withered old man reverted back to his paper-thin appearance, feeling extremely astonished.</p><p>In the continuous exchanges, dozens of half-step Kings attacked Ye Chen. The majority of them received varying amounts of injuring, but even a few who weren’t injured didn’t gain anything with their attacks.</p><p>“Nine Identical Swords!”</p><p>Ye Chen’s left finger suddenly moved, and the sword inside the scabbard immediately flew out and shot forward. This was one of the semi extreme grade swords Ye Chen had obtained from Sky Scorpio King’s sword mound. Its might was even above the Thunder Disaster Sword and had two words engraved on it—Blood Ruin.</p><p>Previously, Ye Chen had never used a semi extreme grade Sword. The first reason was because it was not necessary, and the second was to conceal the edge of Sword Control Art a bit. Afterward, when his profound greatly improved in every aspect, the Sword Control Art suddenly became a lot weaker, and could no longer compare to Ye Chen’s other major profound martial skills.</p><p>However, his Sword Control Art had again improved now to the Nine Identical Swords stage from the Five Identical Swords. Adding on the substitution of semi extreme grade sword, its power had doubled, no longer weaker than Golden Ripple, and second only to Waning Moon.</p><p>Creak Creak Creak!</p><p>As nine sword images shot forth, nine half-step Kings flew back while spurting blood, non-shallow sword cuts appearing on their defensive armors at the chest.</p><p>“Sword Control Art!”</p><p>Sima Zonguan had been observing Ye Chen’s strength at all times. As long as he had a grasp of his bottom line, he would immediately issue his killer move. At this moment, when he saw nine sword images shooting out, he couldn’t help but blurt out. Sword Control Art, be it the continent or the deep ocean, was considered a lost sword art. He didn’t expect to see this legendary sword art at the hands of Ye Chen.</p><p>Of the dozens of half-step Kings, nine had received heavy injuries while the rest didn’t look too good either. On the contrary, Ye Chen seemed calm and steady as if he had much more to offer.</p><p>“All retreat!”</p><p>Siba Zonguan’s face sank. None of the half-kings he had brought was not an expert. He didn’t expect that they would fail to exchange even a few moves with Ye Chen. If he had known this beforehand, he would have entered the battle from the very beginning and not provided the latter an opportunity to injure his men. If he had done so, Ye Chen’s superiority while fighting alone wouldn’t have been so huge.</p><p>A long staff appeared in his hand and he swept it with a roar. Dazzling staff phantom with luminous radiance exploded toward Ye Chen like the entire starry river flooding out.</p><p>“En? This staff is strange.” Ye Chen was startled as he raised his sword before his body.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>A metal colliding explosion rang out as Ye Chen retreated several steps. The surrounding Qi burst out; winds and clouds turned erratic, faintly producing a dragon wail.</p><p>“Slaughter Chop!”</p><p>Siba Zonguan again swept his staff, causing a powerful phantom to create a huge hole in the ocean underneath, seeming like an abyss.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Ye Chen retreated again, his blood Qi shaken.</p><p>“As expected of Siba Zonguan, he can actually suppress him.” The retreating Blackwater Alliance experts had delightful faces.</p><p>“This not nothing surprising. Sima Zonguan had been a peak half-step King for a long time. Adding on the Slaughter Dragon Scepter’s imitation Dragon Extinguishing Staff in his hands, ordinary peak half-step Kings can’t even take ten moves from him.”</p><p>“Dragon Extinguishing Staff!” Hearing the conversation of the Blackwater Alliance experts, Ye Chen turned pensive.</p><p>“Have one more staff!” Sima Zonguan said overbearingly, filling the sky with staff images.</p><p>As Blackwater Alliance experts had said, the staff in Sima Zonguan’s hand was a copy of the Dragon Extinguishing Scepter. Although it was not a pseudo extreme grade artifact, it was the best among semi extreme grade artifacts and had a dragon slaughtering attribute. Although called dragon slaughtering, it had a deeper significance. In the legends, dragons were said to have an extremely powerful vitality. A move that could kill a same level human expert could absolutely not kill a dragon. Since it could kill a dragon, killing a human was naturally as easy as flipping hands for it. After all, the vitality of a human was considered several levels below that of dragon.</p><p>“You have the Dragon Extinguishing Staff, but I also have the Blood Severing Finger.” Ye Chen’s two index fingers were raised and slashed at Sima Zonguan.</p><p>Rip!</p><p>Just like that, a condensed thread of blood Qi was erased inside Sima Zonguan.</p><p>“What!” Greatly alarmed, Sima Zonguan hurriedly raised his staff to defend against Ye Chen’s Blood Severing Finger.</p><p>Dragon Extinguishing Staff and Blood Severing Finger had a common aspect, so the seemingly irresistible Blood Severing Finger was actually counteracted for its greater part by the staff. The left behind finger’s power was negligible.</p><p>“So that’s the case.” Ye Chen had roughly understood the effect of the Dragon Extinguishing Staff.</p><p>“Dragon Slaughtering Chop!”</p><p>Sima Zonguan was extremely apprehensive of Ye Chen’s Blood Severing Finger. The Zhen Yuan in his body violently surged and a large portion of it poured into the Dragon Extinguishing Staff before Sima Zonguan vigorously chopped it.</p><p>Whizzzzz…!</p><p>A staff image turning the sun and moon dark whistled across, carrying an aura that could cleave mountains and rivers.</p><p>“Waning Moon!”</p><p>In response, Ye Chen raised his sword and slashed out a black crescent-moon shaped sword energy. The sun and moon turned even darker, and the gravity above the black ocean completely disappeared. Within the darkness, an impact that seemed about to shatter the stars was created, bringing complete annihilation.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>A semi-circular depression appeared in the black ocean, followed by a huge stream of water exploding upwards and ramming into the dome of the sky. Sima Zonguan, who was at the other side of the water stream, was blasted off while holding the staff in his hands, finally sinking into the depths of the ocean, his life and death unknown.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
