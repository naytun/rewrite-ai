As long as the people got out of its coverage, they would not be affected by the attacks at all. The skinny elder flashed his body after killing a lot of birds and shot out through the gap of the birds.</p><p>The young man also knew that these birds could not be killed completely, and that they would only be wounded if they tried to fight back. Therefore, the skinny elder had just finished talking when he chased up.</p><p>Quak! Quak! Quak! Quak!</p><p>Hundreds of fire birds chased after them like a burning string. Unfortunately, just like the wolves, these birds could not shoot out long range attacks. Only the ones that were the closest could attack the two with their fireballs, causing countless splashes.</p><p>…</p><p>“So hot!”</p><p>Through the massive meadow, Ye Chen and the five arrived at the lava land. The temperature here was one hundred times greater than outside. Normal iron would melt instantly if put on the ground. The air itself was like burning qi flow. Normal warriors would have their lungs burnt through with the slightest inhalation.</p><p>“This should be the fire bird spell. We should not try our chances with the birds. Find a moment to make through.” Qing Liu reminded the four.</p><p>The dark ground was full of cracks. The burning red lava and black smoke filled sky. The whole environment was so awful that it would be almost impossible for human beings to survive. Only fire elemental creatures would want to live here.</p><p>The five of them flew in the sky and had to constantly dodge the lave flow from the ground.</p><p>Quak!</p><p>All of a sudden, a wave of red water poured out of that massive fire mountain in front. When it reached closer, they realized that it was not water but a dense group of fire birds. These birds did not have a solid body; instead the bodies were made of fire elemental energy. As they flapped their wings, the flame burned aggressively, and the temperature of the air further increased by a couple of times.</p><p>Qing Liu attacked first, shattering a group of fire birds. Meanwhile, Ye Chen performed his Defensive sword spell, causing three golden light beams to shoot though the groups. Wherever they went, the birds fell down like raindrops.</p><p>“Everyone follow me! Let’s make through!”</p><p>Qing Liu’s protective Zhen yuan suddenly grew by a couple of times, covering the four before landing into another group of dense fire bird groups.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>A semi king warrior’s protective Zhen yuan was extremely powerful. Even after a couple times of expenditure, it was not something that the master level fire birds could compete with. All of the birds that tried hit their heads on the blockade failed. It was impossible for them to form a formation.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>All of a sudden, a massive sound was heard from the protective Zhen yuan layer. Qing Liu’s face went pale, and her body froze a little.</p><p>It turned out that there were three birds that had attacked a few times, and their power was not much weaker than Liu Wujian’s. They all landed onto the protective Zhen yuan, trying their best to stop the five from breaking through.</p><p>“Star Hand!”</p><p>Qing Liu made a noise as both of her hands reached out, twisting two fire birds’ necks. Meanwhile, that powerful aggressive qi explosion blew away another fire bird.</p><p>“Defensive sword spell!”</p><p>Ye Chen used the time to perform his sword spell. The gold sword went through the fire birds’ bodies.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>It was a great opportunity, and the fire birds behind were already catching up. The five of them increased their speed and shot out into the distance, soon managing to go way ahead of the birds.</p><p>After the meadow was the lava land, and after that was a white foggy place which had the effect of blocking out soul power. Being within, it was impossible to tell where one was or which the right direction to go would be.</p><p>“Four Extreme Emperor had the white sheep king below him, who was great at illusions. The spells he set out would be one of those for sure. Although they did not have attacking power by themselves, but they could trap people within. If we cannot break through the spell, then it would be possible to be stuck here forever, which would not be good.”</p><p>Qing Liu did not have the Mysterious Queen’s power. Although she knew a lot about illusions as well, but she could not do it well herself. Meanwhile the white sheep king was known as the powerful beast king from the ancient era. Before he was trained by the Four Extreme Emperor, he was invincible for the longest time. Even king warriors at the same ranking would be scared of him and his illusions. Right now, out of the five of them, the most powerful one was Qing Liu, who was at the half step king warrior level. It would be extremely hard for them to break through the spells.</p><p>“I will give it a shot!” Murong Qingcheng stood out.</p><p>“You?”</p><p>Qing Liu looked at her with surprise. She was indeed not weak, but she had been so quiet this whole time, so Qing Liu had no idea what she could do.</p><p>“Senior Qingliu, don’t worry! Murong can handle this.” Ye Chen knew everything about Murong Qingcheng. In other words, the demon race from the ancient era were not afraid of illusion at all. Murong Qingcheng had inherited that ability as well. Her demon eyes could see through every illusion.</p><p>Walking in front, she activated her demon power, pouring them under her eyes. The next second, her pupils became golden, and her vision could see through the illusions and into the distance.</p><p>“Let’s go that way!” Murong Qingcheng pointed out her finger toward the left.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Ye Chen trusted Murong Qingcheng with his whole heart. On the other hand, Qing Liu and the other two hesitated briefly before following behind them.</p><p>After couple of hours, they actually walked out of the spells.</p><p>“Perfect half step demon bloodline is indeed like the legends. You have both the quality of humans as well as a part of the advantage of the demon race.”</p><p>Qing Liu was impressed by Murong Qingcheng. The hardest thing when exploring the unknown regions was to not have eyes and ears. With Murong Qingcheng being there, they had nothing to worry about.</p><p>“Senior, you are flattering me.”</p><p>Since being together with Ye Chen, Murong Qingcheng had stopped covering her face. Before, the reason she did so for so long was because she had made a decision that she would not show her face to too many people before she met the person of her dreams. Right now, a light smile appeared on her face.</p><p>“So beautiful! Just like Qingxuan, what a natural beauty!”</p><p>Just like that, the five of them made it through three different spells and came to the last one. It was the head of the top four king warriors, the Sky Scorpion King, and his spell was called the Sky Scorpion Spell. It was way more powerful than the ones set by the Wolf King and the Fire Bird King.</p><p>Over on the other side of the Sky Scorpion Spell, the skinny elder and the teenager were in deep battles. Their opponent was a massive scorpion beast. Normal ones would definitely not put them in this kind of position. But, the beast had reached beyond rank 10, and was in between rank 10 to rank 11. It was a half step scorpion king. Its power was incomprehensible; the black beast power could already materialize, accumulating on the black shell. Its defense was extreme sturdy, and the massive claw was powerful and heavy enough to break through mountains and grounds. Added with that back hook, it would be almost impossible to block out one hundred percent of its attacks.</p><p>“Five Symbol Palm!”</p><p>The teenager moved the natural yuan qi as he threw out a palm attack onto the back of the half step scorpion king’s back.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>That twisted symbol on the back shattered the black beast power a bit, but it was not able to wound the core of the beast.</p><p>“Tian’er, you try to control it while I prepare the killing attacks.”</p><p>The skinny elder did not want to continue fighting the scorpion. He was sure that if they continued doing this, it would not be the scorpion king that would die in the end. The beast power of the half step scorpion king was way more than theirs. With the spell, it would just be impossible to break through the situation.</p><p>“Alright.” The teenager bit on his teeth and nodded.</p><p>…</p><p>The Sky Scorpion Spell too generated an uninviting environment. Once they entered, Ye Chen and the other four encountered five to six batches of scorpion beasts. These beasts might not have been more powerful than the fire birds, but they were great at attacking. That mysterious unpredictable hooks were like a killer hiding in the dark. Without being careful, anyone might be hit by that.</p><p>Most importantly, the beasts’ defense was also not something that the former two beasts could compete with.</p><p>After killing batches of scorpion beasts, the five had burned a lot of Zhen yuan. Luckily, Qing Liu and the other two had brought enough Zhen yuan pellets before they came here, while Murong Qingcheng even had the demon power essence inside her body. With that, she could recover her demon power extremely quickly. So, they were all okay for now.</p><p>Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!</p><p>As the five killed the seventh batches of scorpion beasts, a pile of dark clouds shot out of the mountains below. Within the dark mountains, a hill-sized scorpion beast was hiding. It was not only ten times bigger, its black beast power could even solidify like a layer of black shield. That massive hook on its back was the size of a house. As it opened and closed, it made metal clinging sound. That long tail disappeared and reappeared in that dark cloud while purple light flashed around the hook. It was not hard to tell that it would be full of poison.</p><p>“Half step scorpion king!” Qing Liu frowned.</p><p>There were a lot of half step king warriors amongst the human warriors, and there were also some half step beast king amongst the beasts. Qing Liu had not expected it, but the spell could even simulate a half step scorpion king as well. Although its qi was not as rich as a real one, its beast cultivation was at mid rank already. Plus, being inside the spell, this simulated beast king could basically do whatever it wanted, and would not have to worry about running out of beast power.</p><p>Crack! Crack!</p><p>The simulated beast king could not talk, so it flashed its body once and approached the five along with its dark clouds. It threw out its claw towards them as it got close, which looked like two pairs of massive scissors about to cut through the sky.</p><p>“Piss off!”</p><p>Qing Liu had dark blue light shining on her right hand which then landed on the half step beast king’s claws, generating a metal exploding sound.</p><p>The half step scorpion king was indeed a powerful one. That exchange of attack with Qing Liu had only pushed it back for dozens of steps; it was not wounded at all. Meanwhile, that back hook of its swooped around in the other direction at Murong Qingcheng and Ye Chen.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Ye Chen’s reflexes was extremely fast. The second that the hook started to make a movement, he performed his sword finger and his gold sword shot out of its scabbard, blocking out the half step scorpion’s back hook.</p><p>“Landing Spell!”</p><p>Qing Liu did not back out at all as she formed another spell with both of her hands. A massive crystal palm print fell from the sky, landing onto the back armor of the scorpion beast heavily. As a result, it sank in into the ground a little like a massive mountain.</p><p>“Let’s go.”</p><p>With the advantage from winning the exchange, Qing Liu did not want to mess with the scorpion beast anymore, and wanted to leave with the gang. Unfortunately, although the scorpion beast was limited by the spell and could not shoot out long-range attacks, but that long back hook could reach out quite far, landing heavily on Qing Liu’s half step Zhen yuan layer heavily.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>She backed out dozens of steps, her face losing color.</p><p>The protective Zhen yuan layer outside her body had been devoured drastically. After all, the poison on that hook was something that even king warriors might need to be concerned about. It was not hard to imagine what would happen if it got inside one’s body.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
