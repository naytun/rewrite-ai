The clothes on the latter were almost completely gone. That  rich evil qi wrapped around his body while freezing all of the space  around.</p><p>“Evil Spirit King…No…It is like an evil spirit, but not quite there yet.”</p><p>As the demon king of the half step demon race, the elder in black  sure knew a lot of things. He could tell that this elder in yellow was  not just an evil spirit, but an even more evil creature. It would be  against all rules of nature, and the being would be struck by thunder  the second it was exposed in the real world outside. But in this  mysterious evil tower, it somehow escaped the rules and the nature power  could no longer sense its existence.</p><p>Besides the elder in yellow, the elder in black could sense another  three creatures. He turned around and was surprised again to see the  three people that had survived. The power that came out from that  gorgeous lady was actually demon power, which could only be trained by  people that carried the perfect half step demon power bloodline. Of  course, it was so rare that it would be impossible for him to miss it.  He had been searching for so long, and here it was right in front of him  without him actively looking.</p><p>“Demon king!”</p><p>Ye Chen and the woman in yellow squinted their eyes. Only a demon  king could have that kind of demon qi amidst his Zhen yuan. In other  words, the demon qi was like the attribute of his Zhen yuan, so it could  be called demon fire elemental Zhen yuan, which would be way more  powerful than normal fire elemental Zhen yuan.</p><p>“This place is not suitable to stay for long!”</p><p>Ye Chen had a very bad instinct. That new intruder could very likely  have come for Murong Qingchengg, who was in deep coma right now.  Everything now depended on him.</p><p>He held up Murong Qingcheng with his left arm and stood up, moving around as he stared at the elder in black.</p><p>Pap! The second he went past Daer Xiong, the latter was blown to the  ground. It turned out that Daer Xiong’s physical body was so strong that  although the sound wave had shattered his soul, it was not able to  scratch his body at all. It made it look like he was completely fine,  but in fact, he was already dead.</p><p>“Where do you think you are going?” The elder in black reached out his right hand and said with a smile.</p><p>“Leaving this place at least.”</p><p>Ye Chen secretly accumulated his Zhen yuan and glanced at his Evil shattering sword right next to his feet.</p><p>“If I have guessed it right, it is you who killed so many people of  our race. Right now, you are not going anywhere, because this will be  your grave.” As he spoke, the elder in black reached out his right hand  and made a grabbing gesture in the air.</p><p>With only half a step, Ye Chen would be able to get that Evil  shattering sword. But right then, he and Murong Qingcheng in his arm had  been restrained by a wave of invisible power. His palm floated in the  air and could not move anymore. The demon king grabbed in the air, his  power reaching beyond the limit of half step king warriors. If not  having experienced it first hand, it would be hard to imagine how  powerful a life and death demon king would be.</p><p>Crack! Crack!</p><p>The elder was great with his control over his power. He did not  wound Murong Qingcheng at all, but managed to strangle Ye Chen like a  massive snake. Ye Chen’s bones were making a squawky sound, and  his Zhen yuan, that had just been activated, had been halted  immediately.</p><p>On the right, the woman in yellow held her breath. Seeing what just  happened, she felt sorry for Ye Chen secretly. Ye Chen could not see  through her, but she could also not see through him either. In fact, her  instinct was right, Ye Chen was way more mysterious than she had  expected. Everyone had died, and only she and Ye Chen were alright. But,  she was a top half step king warrior, yet Ye Chen was only at peak  level Sea of Souls Realm.</p><p>Unfortunately, such a martial genius was going to die now, and she  could barely keep herself alive. She hoped this demon king was in a  relatively good mood.</p><p>But in that critical moment, the elder in yellow saved Ye Chen’s life.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The Mysterious Evil King could sense the elder being different, so he  held that strange looking weapon with his right hand and threw out an  attack. This horrifying power seemed about to cut through the space  within the tower. If the elder in black did not let go of Ye Chen or  tried his best, he might be wounded under this attack.</p><p>Letting go of Ye Chen, the elder in black pushed forward both of his hands.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The Mysterious Evil King let out the kind of energy that was  extremely cold and evil. On the other hand, the demon Zhen yuan the  elder in black let out was aggressive and dark. The two powers clashed  together and generated a blast like it was the end of the world. Ye Chen  did not need to use his eyes as he could sense that in the center of  the floor was a catastrophic tornado spreading out. He knew that if he  did not get out of here in time, he would be destroyed along with  everything else.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>Without another thought, Ye Chen stepped on the Evil shattering sword  and performed his Defensive sword spell. With that, the pseudo extreme  rank Evil Shattering Sword turned into a beam of light and shot out from  the thirty-third floor. He did not even have the time to pick up any  storage rings on his way out, because even the slightest delay could  cost him his life.</p><p>While his Defensive sword spell was activated, a white colored rough  layer appeared on top of his skin, which was indeed the dragon bone  defense layer. Above that was a layer of protective Zhen yuan craved  with bronze symbols. The two defensive powers combined together, forming  his most powerful defense.</p><p>Ye Chen was so fast, but the woman in yellow was not slow either.</p><p>Right then, she finally exposed her real form of a beast; she twisted  her body and turned into a massive snake that looked like it was made  with yellow crystal. The widest part of the snake beast was its waist  while the slimmest was the neck, which was only the size of a calf. A  tiny, light-yellow colored horn also grew on the skull of the snake,  which was shining with a bright, pure, yellow light.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>The lady in yellow turned into the yellow crystal snake and shot out  in a flash through the exit, following right behind Ye Chen.</p><p>The blast wave was so fast that the entire thirty-third floor had  been almost fully decimated by it. Jin Wanshuang and others’ corpses had  been shattered into nothingness all of a sudden, and even their storage  rings were slowly disappeared. In the next second, the destructive  tornado followed the exit behind Ye Chen and the lady as well. Nothing  seemed to be able to stop it.</p><p>When Ye Chen got to the thirty-first floor, he was still caught up by  the tornado. That horrifying power touched his body and he felt like he  was in the endless ocean all of a sudden, full of scrambling waves  which made flying almost impossible.</p><p>“I have to make it through.”</p><p>With the Zhen yuan defense layer from his armor breaking and the  symbols on it making strange noises, Ye Chen held  onto Murong Qingcheng tightly, protecting her with his body. In that  way, even if the tornado eventually broke through his  defensive Zhen yuan, it would not harm her first.</p><p>He was struggling when he made it to the thirtieth floor. The blast  had weakened a bit, but what scared him was the second loud noise coming  from the thirty-third floor. With that, another wave of drastic  vibration started spreading out from the top of the tower.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Ye Chen looked very serious. The first wave of blasting tornado had  not dissipated, and if the second wave caught up with them and layered  together, it would be almost impossible to survive.</p><p>While flying, Ye Chen had a lot of thoughts in his mind.</p><p>‘I am so weak!’</p><p>‘I am still so so weak!’</p><p>The blast waves from battles between Life and Death Realm King  warriors could almost kill him, and it was already the result of him  trying his best to escape. He knew that if he ran any slower, he would  have been dead by now. ‘Is this the power of Life and Death Realm  warriors? Even the slightest shockwave could still kill everyone below  the Life and Death Realm. If I did not have my armor and Defensive sword  spell, would I still be alive?’ He thought to himself.</p><p>It was the first time Ye Chen felt the gap between him and Life and  Death Realm warriors. It was the kind of gap that could never be reached  beyond.</p><p>The protective Zhen yuan kept being thinned down. The blast wave from  the first attack could no longer wound him, but a bigger danger had  arrived. The second wave was catching up with him. Although the power  had weakened a bit after some time, but once it overlapped with the  remaining first wave, its power would be almost the same as the full  attack.</p><p>“You owe me one!”</p><p>A yellow light flashed once and a massive yellow crystal snake  wrapped around Ye Chen. It was almost the same time that a wave of more  powerful tornado rushed up, drowning the three.</p><p>Ye Chen noticed that the yellow halo that wrapped around this yellow  crystal snake actually had the special effect of decreasing the power of  the shockwave like a water snake swimming upstream. Although the water  would offer a counterforce, with her doing the swimming,  the counterforce decreased a lot. Her speed was actually faster than Ye  Chen with his Defensive sword flying spell.</p><p>“This…” Ye Chen could sense that the woman in yellow had a completely different approach.</p><p>The big snake spoke in a human voice, “This is my natural gift.”</p><p>“I see. Thank you! I indeed owe you one.” A favor would be the  hardest debt to pay back, but it would not be that hard to ask for one  either.</p><p>“Hehe…Let’s get through this first.”</p><p>The tornado was too powerful. The third wave, fourth wave, and fifth  wave all rampaged out. It was hard to imagine how the two on the  thirty-third floor were battling. Anyhow, they were still struggling  down the twenty-fourth floor. There were more floors below them, and the  shockwaves did not seem to be dying at all. Only by leaving the tower  completely could the three of them be safe.</p><p>Ah! Ah!</p><p>When they got to the twenty-third floor, Ye Chen heard a couple of  cries. He looked over and saw that some people amongst Shi Shaobao’s  group had been thrown apart by the blast wave. Only Shi Shaobao and the  strange elder survived while the rest of them all died.</p><p>On the twenty-second floor!</p><p>On the twenty-first floor!</p><p>On the twentieth floor!</p><p>On the nineteenth floor!</p><p>The third wave arrived and layered over the other previous attacks,  and then the fourth and fifth waves all arrived. The power of the  shockwave continued as the tower shone with an endless light.</p><p>…</p><p>On the first floor!</p><p>After half a pot of tea time, four figures flew out. All of them were  pale and bleeding out of different places. Shi Shaobao had already  turned back from his golden lion body. The hair on his body shed down  and a roar was heard before running out. The elder mumbled a couple of  times before leaving as well.</p><p>At that moment, the yellow crystal snake turned back into a lady in  yellow and chuckled as she said, “See you later.” After puking out a  mouth of blood, she left the tower.</p><p>“That was critical!”</p><p>Ye Chen’s Dragon bone defense layer disappeared as he held up Murong Qingcheng and hurried to leave the area.</p><p>After a while, another human shadow appeared out of nowhere: it was  indeed the elder in black. Right then, he looked even scarier. That qi  on him weakened a lot, and a cut mark had appeared on his shoulder.  Although his muscle was not wounded at all, Life and Death Realm  warriors had immortal bodies, so that area might already have been cut  before.</p><p>“Mysterious Evil King is even more powerful after death…How evil!”  The elder in black tore apart the space before disappearing completely.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
