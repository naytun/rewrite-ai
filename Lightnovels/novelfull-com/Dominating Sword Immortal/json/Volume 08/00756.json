I only used five out of twenty of them.”</p><p>Since Murong Qingchengg trained demon power, the Zhen yuan crystals did not work on her at all. Therefore, all twenty of them were in Ye Chen’s possession.</p><p>Putting away the remaining crystals, Ye Chen took out the Heaven beast fire spirit fruit after giving it some thought.</p><p>The good things should be used at the right moment. Right now, if he used his Heaven beast fire spirit fruit, his spirit body would be able to reach rank 4. And with his almost-half step king warrior level, right now would be the perfect timing for using it.</p><p>“After taking so many of the fire pears, my spirit body has improved a bit as well, almost reaching peak rank 3 right now. I wonder what this fruit can do.”</p><p>Lifting up the fruit in his hand, he studied it carefully before taking a bite.</p><p>Hot!</p><p>After swallowing the fruit, the first thought that jumped into his mind was that it was so hot! It was not the kind that was from spices, more like the heat coming out from inside of his body.</p><p>“So hot!”</p><p>Ye Chen hurried to take off all of his clothes and sat on his bed naked.</p><p>Unfortunately, removing all of his clothing did not seem to help with the situation. Ye Chen’s muscular naked body started to ‘smoke’, which was vaguely showing a hint of redness.</p><p>“It is indeed the Heaven beast spirit fruit!”</p><p>Ye Chen feared that he might burn up the whole hotel, so he took out a tower shield from his storage ring and sat on top of it. The shield had an effect of separating the heat, so although the house was burning like a sauna, that red qi flow would not be too far away from Ye Chen and burn up the whole place.</p><p>Fifteen minutes passed.</p><p>Thirty minutes!</p><p>One hour!</p><p>During the one hour, Ye Chen could feel as if he was being barbecued. His muscles, blood, meridians, and bones were all being tested. At times, he could feel the burning sensation on his skin, while at other times, he could feel his bones going numb like countless ants were eating him from inside out. At other times, he felt like his whole body was twitching and he had lost all control of his body. Toward the end, Ye Chen’s eyes started to burn and turn red as well.</p><p>“It is so damn painful!”</p><p>Ye Chen thought that he did not lack will power at all, but right now, he was still struggling not to scream on top of his lungs.</p><p>Pain would go away eventually. When his body could not feel any pain anymore, a wave of fresh qi flow started to spread around his body. Because of the extreme contrast, Ye Chen could not help but moan out loud. All of his pores had been opened across his body.</p><p>“Purify first before nourishing…I see!”</p><p>Before, each inch of his flesh and bones was being purified, and some of the tough particles had been burned out completely. Soon, the special features of the fruit started to show inside his body, elevating his spirit body to a completely different level. It was now almost at the edge of evolving into something more than human.</p><p>If someone who could see through physical things was here right now, then he or she would be able to see it clearly that Ye Chen’s blood and flesh were crystalline and bright like jade uniformly. The blood itself was like a melted red crystal, and the bone was like some white metal.</p><p>“Rank four spirit body! It is done!”</p><p>The fresh qi flow disappeared completely, and the fiery sensation in his eyes disappeared slowly.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>Lifting up his head, Ye Chen tightened his fists. That intense power vibrated the whole space, and all of the furniture inside his room was blown to the ground.</p><p>“It is about peak level rank 4. I have jumped one rank in total.”</p><p>Rank 4 spirit body was the body of king warriors, the body strength definitely beyond human. Without exaggeration, even if Ye Chen did not use his protective Zhen yuan layer, Astral Reaching Realm warriors could not wound him at all. Even if it were Sea of Souls Realm warriors, they could not wound him badly. Only master level warriors and half step king warriors might be able to kill him without him defending.</p><p>Spirit body represented physical strength; although it had nothing much to do with qi power, it still had increased it from four hundred thousand to four hundred and fifty thousand pounds. Even though fifty thousand pounds might not be as much by the looks of it, it was already really impressive, given the higher the qi power level, the harder it would be to make progress.</p><p>“Rank four spirit body is completed…The path toward half step king realm is all clear.” Putting on clean clothes, Ye Chen walked out of the room.</p><p>…</p><p>There were a lot of hotels on the crystal islands with different styles. On the second floor of a traditional looking restaurant, Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng sat next to the window.</p><p>“None of the restaurants on the True Spirit continent would have this many powerful warriors dining together.” Murong Qingcheng glanced around her and said emotionally.</p><p>Ye Chen said, “Tomorrow is the first, so there are visibly more people here on the island.”</p><p>“Yeah, I wonder what kind of missions there are.”</p><p>No one would think they had too many Zhen yuan crystals. After all, reaching the Half step king warrior realm from the peak level Late Sea of Soul realm would need a huge amount of Zhen yuan accumulation. And for the Half step king warriors, they would even need ten times more than that. From the past until now, the reason that not many people had managed to beat life and death realm warriors with lower cultivation was because of the difference in Zhen yuan accumulation. Actually, king warriors who had just reached life and death realm would not be that powerful in their profound martial arts anyway.</p><p>Pap! Pap! Pap!</p><p>A light string of footsteps was heard, and soon, a man and a woman walked up.</p><p>The man looked rather young and seemed to be in his twenties while the lady looked very beautiful and attractive. With the most casual look, she could rob one of his soul.</p><p>When she looked over toward Ye Chen, who stood out in the restaurant, her eyes brightened. Seriously speaking, Ye Chen was not the kind of attractive-looking man that would make one avoid looking; he was rather clean-shaved. It was just that aura he carried which was so calm, but had a sharpness hidden well within it. It was indeed a deadly attractive factor for ladies.</p><p>However, when she saw Murong Qingcheng, she could not help but sneer. It had been a long time since Murong Qingcheng wore a veil. Not to mention that feel she gave out, just in her appearance alone, no one could compete with her. She had an epic beauty within that holiness and elegance, which was nothing like anyone else’s.</p><p>Because of women’s natural competitive instinct, the woman was hostile toward Murong Qingcheng already without even realizing it yet.</p><p>“I cannot imagine that there would be this kind of beauty at such a place.”</p><p>The young man who came with the woman glanced at Murong Qingcheng a couple of times, and could not help but start to compare with his own girlfriend. He then realized that no matter in what area, his girlfriend was not winning at all.</p><p>“My name is Dongfang Hao. Do you think we can share a table?” The young man walked over with class and said with a smile.</p><p>Ye Chen picked up his teacup and said, “I think best not, as we are not used to sharing tables with other people.”</p><p>“Eh!” Dongfang Hao looked at Murong Qingcheng, who did not look back at him.</p><p>“Hao, let’s sit here.”</p><p>The woman saw that her boyfriend was in a bit of an awkward situation, so she pointed at the table close to them and said.</p><p>“Alright.” Dongfang Hao sat down following her.</p><p>Soon, the waiters served tea and fruit.</p><p>Taking a sip of the tea, Dongfang Hao laughed, “You two also came here for missions?”</p><p>“Not certainly.” Ye Chen answered.</p><p>“Tomorrow will be the first. As long as we finish the mission, we can exchange for endless Zhen yuan crystals. For me, it is a very tempting offer. Right now, I am at half step king warrior realm, so I just need too much Zhen yuan accumulation.”</p><p>As they spoke, Dongfang Hao stated his realm deliberately.</p><p>He was only thirty-four years old. Being able to reach half step king warrior realm at that age would make him a very rare martial genius. It was something he had been very proud of as well.</p><p>“However, you are doing quite well as well. You are already at peak level Late Sea of Souls Realm. As long as you have the right opportunities, you will be able to reach half step king warrior level soon enough. If you do not mind, let’s take on a mission tomorrow together. After all, the more people you have, the safer it would be.”</p><p>Dongfang Hao did not say everything on his mind. He meant that once facing danger, with their peak level Late Sea of Souls realm, they would be able to do nothing. And it would not mean much if he died, but such a beautiful lady dying would be too much of a pity.</p><p>“Hello, my name is Meng Xiaoling! Hao is right…The more the merrier! With Hao being here, other half step king warriors would not be able to do anything to you.”</p><p>Although Meng Xiaoling thought Ye Chen was quite nice, she was not that kind of person who would lose her mind over someone’s appearance. Dongfang Hao was both good-looking and powerful. There might not be another warrior like him within a hundred thousand miles. Compared to Dongfang Hao, Ye Chen was still lacking after all. Therefore, she would of course talk up her boyfriend.</p><p>“I will think about your offer.” Ye Chen stood up, preparing to pay for the bill downstairs.</p><p>Dongfang Hao stood up and said politely, “I wonder what your names are. Please tell me if you do not mind.”</p><p>“Ye Chen…and this is my girlfriend, Murong Qingcheng.” After that, they walked downstairs together.</p><p>“Hehe.” Dongfang Hao smiled as he watched the two leaving.</p><p>‘Murong Qingcheng…she is indeed just like her name. Why didn’t I get to meet her first?’ He thought to himself.</p><p>“What? You are intrigued?”</p><p>Meng Xiaoling could see that he was staring at Murong Qingcheng’s back until she disappeared at the bottom of the stairs, so she said jealously.</p><p>“You and I grew up together. Do you not know me yet? I will never leave you. And one day, I will become an emperor level warrior.” He said proudly.</p><p>“Yes, you will.”</p><p>She was moved by those words. No woman did not want to watch her men be at his peak. Although she wanted to keep him all to herself, she also knew that this kind of a powerful man would not be all hers at the end of the day. Hence, she did not mind having some more sisters.</p><p>“It will be hard for you to get her.” She said.</p><p>“What? You are not jealous anymore?” He looked at her jokingly.</p><p>“Can I stop you from doing what you want?”</p><p>She was feeling sorry for Ye Chen when she said that, because she knew that Dongfang Hao was the kind of person that would always do what he wanted to. She of all knew it the best.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
