This sword strike of Ye Chen didn’t have any mystery, merely infusing the sword with Zhen Yuan and slashing out a sword light. However, the might of this sword radiance was too frightening. The Sky Hammer in Qin Liu was also a poor quality extreme grade artifact, but its might was probably not even one third of the Sky Scorpio Sword. And this was still because Ye Chen couldn’t bring out its full power. Otherwise, it wouldn’t even be one fifth.</p><p>“Ye Chen, the Sky Scorpio Sword is an extreme grade artifact. Even though its might is great, you can’t use it easily. If Life and Death Kings found out that you have it, the consequences will be unimaginable.” Qin Liu warned Ye Chen.</p><p>“Right, there are many Life and Death Kings without extreme grade artifacts. Moreover, the Sky Scorpio Sword is clearly not a common extreme grade artifact. It will make the Kings go crazy.” Sun Tianlang, retracting his gaze back from the Sky Scorpio Sword and spoke with a nod.</p><p>“No need to worry about me.”</p><p>How could Ye Chen not understand the reasons to not reveal this sword. This sword could only be used under absolutely safe circumstances.</p><p>There were too many swords in the sword mound. After Sky Scorpio Sword, Ye Chen further took seven-eight semi extreme grade swords as well as hundreds of upper grade swords. Qin Liu and the rest also took many, taking all the swords above mid grade. The remaining swords left in the mound suddenly snapped and rapidly decayed. The reason these swords could survive so many years was because the sword mound was a sealed place and they received the nurturing of sword Qi. Now that the principal swords had been taken away, these low grade and mid grade swords immediately crumbled.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The five left the sword mound.</p><p>Gray Wolf King, Fire Bird King, White Sheep King, and Sky Scorpio King’s graveyards had numerous treasures. Those who entered, as long as they could survive, would almost always have some gains. However, everybody knew that compared to the graveyard of Four Extreme Emperor, these were merely appetizers.</p><p>Four Extreme Emperor’s graveyard was the grave of an emperor; he was not an emperor like today’s titled Monarchs, but an ancient emperor who left his mark on the Emperor Scar Stelle. If he were to be reborn today, the entire True Spirit Continent would be at his command. What Void Emperor, what Space Emperor? They were all like fleeting clouds before him. Only those emperors who could leave their marks on Emperor Scar Stelle could contend against him. Unfortunately, this era no longer had such emperors.</p><p>Although the graveyard of Four Extreme Emperor was good, everybody knew that it would be the arena for Life and Death Kings, and they could only stand at the sidelines. If one’s luck was good, they might get some leftovers. However, even that had a prerequisite that the graveyard itself didn’t have any dangers. Of course, that didn’t sound too likely.</p><p>Crossing the Sky Scorpio King’s grave, Ye Chen’s group arrived at an excessively huge plaza.</p><p>The plaza’s body was made from huge deep black rocks. At each of the plaza’s four corners stood a statue— the statue of Gray Wolf King, Fire Bird King, White Sheep King, and Sky Scorpio King. At the center of the plaza was a huge towering statue of a human. This statue was almost hundred meters high, carved out of a huge unknown rock.</p><p>The statue had a somber expression, long legs, wide shoulders, and a right hand that was stretched out. Although this right hand looked simple and plain, it exuded a feeling of overturning the heaven and earth and flipping the four extremes. Even Ye Chen felt his heart race when assaulted by the statue’s aura.</p><p>“Four Extreme Emperor’s statue!” Qin Liu raised her head and said reverently.</p><p>Sun Tianlang said, “A hero from seventy thousand years ago. If he were to live in today’s world, he would simply be dreadful. All geniuses and Kings would be under his shadow.”</p><p>It had been far too long since a titled monarch capable of leaving their mark on Emperor Scar Stele appeared. Void Emperor tried and failed; Space Emperor tried and failed as well. After the era of Yuan Emperor—the last titled monarch to leave his mark on the Emperor Scar Stele—countless people had tried and failed. This gave off a feeling that the ancient people could not be surpassed, and that the current era had already headed toward decline, and could no longer produce those world-shaking, unrivaled characters.</p><p>“He’s here!”</p><p>“He has the third key.”</p><p>As Ye Chen’s group of five, they immediately attracted the attention of many people. However, their gazes were fixated on Ye Chen because he had the key of White Sheep King’s graveyard.</p><p>“Ye Chen!” Tantai Mingyue walked over.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Tantai Mingyue said, “I have the fourth key with me. Adding Jian Tian, Xia Houzun, and your key, we have four keys. The entrance of Four Extreme Emperor’s graveyard can be opened now.”</p><p>“You have the fourth key?”</p><p>Ye Chen was somewhat skeptical. He didn’t think that the Sky Scorpio key would be with the former. It meant that she had studied the strongest style of Void Shattering Finger—the fourth style.</p><p>“Right.” Tantai Mingyue nodded.</p><p>“Sure then, let’s go!” Ye Chen didn’t decline. With the third key on him, he couldn’t decline, or he would become a public enemy.</p><p>“It’s about to open.”</p><p>Everybody saw Ye Chen, Tantai Mingyue, and the rest heading toward the entrance and held their breaths, staring unblinkingly at the entrance.</p><p>“Open.”</p><p>Tantai Mingyue took the lead and inserted her key first.</p><p>Jian Tian glanced at Ye Chen and inserted his key as well.</p><p>Then it was Xia Houzun, followed by Ye Chen.</p><p>As soon as the four keys were inserted, the entrance shone with a radiance that made everybody flinch, and a majestic power made the four retreat.</p><p>Shua! Shua! Shua! Shua!</p><p>The entrance didn’t immediately open. Instead four slender light beams shot toward Ye Chen and the other three. Ye Chen swiftly reached out and caught the light beam heading toward him.</p><p>Opening his hands, he saw a jade strip.</p><p>“Jade strip?”</p><p>Ye Chen felt doubtful. As far as he knew, jade strips were usually used to store profound martial skills and high level secret arts. Turning his head, he saw that the other three also had a jade strip in their hands, and their expressions were also strange.</p><p>“Jade strip…Must be a martial skill of the Four Extreme Emperor.”</p><p>“Having a key actually has such a benefit!”</p><p>The people on plaza had their breathing fastened. They couldn’t wait to go snatch the battle skill, but they wouldn’t act in such an unscrupulous manner in broad daylight, and would only covet in secret.</p><p>“Let’s study it first.” Ye Chen poured his soul power into the jade strip.</p><p>Meanwhile, a group of unexpected guests appeared before the four graves.</p><p>These guests were too strong. With a flicker, they appeared anywhere as if teleporting. Even the walls of the passages were not able to hinder them and seemed useless. They were but true Life and Death Kings.</p><p>“Haha, such good luck…to immediately run into four hetero-specied lifeforms. This one should be the Shadow Ghost Bat. If trained well, it can become a hetero-specied assassin. This Swamp King can guard the entrance, and these two predators can produce countless thousand years old spider silk.</p><p>The hard passage walls rippled like water as a black-robed old man walked out of the passage. His gaze seemed ordinary, but Shadow Ghost Bat King, who was being watched, felt its whole body going numb, unable to budge an inch.</p><p>“A Life and Death King! Damn it! How can a Life and Death King appear here!”</p><p>The previously high-spirited Shadow Ghost Bat King’s face revealed despair. Running into a Life and Death King, even escape was a pipe dream. One couldn’t even kill themselves.</p><p>Zizi….</p><p>The two predators howled, their little eyes filled with terror.</p><p>“Don’t be afraid, I won’t kill you.”</p><p>The black-robed old man pointed in the air. With that, the Shadow Ghost Bat King’s body was captured and turned into a black light, entering the old man’s beast taming card at his waist.</p><p>Taking the Shadow Ghost Bat King, the black-robed old man turned his attention towards Swamp King.</p><p>“Night Ghost King, leave this Swamp creature for me!”</p><p>An earthen yellow ripple appeared on the passage across and a majestic-looking tall middle-aged man walked out. With a wave of his hand, the restriction of the black-robed man on the Swamp King was immediately removed, and it was collected by him.</p><p>“Beast King, you dare to fight with me!”</p><p>The black robed old man, Night Ghost King’s, eyes squinted, filled with killing intent. This was a gaze of an expert assassin and could even penetrate through one’s soul.</p><p>“What would I not dare?”</p><p>The Beast King’s body glowed with an earthen yellow halo, cracks covering his outer body and making it look extremely sturdy. It could be seen that compared to the planar battlefield, Beast King’s cultivation had greatly improved. He ought to have refined the Earth Yuan crystals traded from Black Thunder King. His cultivation base had increased by forty years.</p><p>“Hmph! Only an idiot will fight you head on. But be careful, you’ll be assassinated by my hands someday.” The Night Ghost King withdrew the killing intent from his body. His cultivation base was more or less the same as Beast King. However, the latter cultivated earth type Zhen Yuan and earth profound, so his defenses far surpassed the Kings of the same level. Moreover, Night Shadow King specialized in assassinations. How could he fight head on with the other? That would be simply against his style.</p><p>“Say that when you have the skill to back it up.”</p><p>Beast King didn’t fear him one bit. Life and Death Kings rarely fought life and death battles, unless there was an irreconcilable enmity. Otherwise, if one party failed to kill another, one would gain an enemy that would give them countless sleepless nights.</p><p>The two predators before two Kings were incessantly shivering and trembling. Their sinister and predatory aura was no longer present, and they seemed more like two pitiable rabbits.</p><p>“Collect!”</p><p>Collect!”</p><p>Beast King and Night Ghost King pointed at the two predators, intending to each collect one. However, it didn’t conclude so smoothly. A huge net suddenly appeared out of nowhere in the void, binding both Beast King and Night Ghost King.</p><p>“Who is it!”</p><p>Both were greatly alarmed. To be able to bind them, it was naturally a Life and Death King, and one with a higher cultivation base than them.</p><p>“You two sure have guts, collecting spider veins before me.”</p><p>Above the passage, black water rippled and a throne descended. This throne was weaved from fine silk, and sitting on the throne was a purplish-red lipped gorgeous young woman in black gown. Her forehead had four tightly-closed eyes, making her seem beautiful yet dangerous.</p><p>“Black Mountain Queen!”</p><p>Night Ghost King’s figure slightly warped, loosening from the net. With his brows creased, he thought of retreating.</p><p>This Black Mountain Queen was not a human but a spider cultivating to the Demonic Beast King grade. Demonic Beast Kings were more powerful than their human counterparts, but even more frighteningly, this Black Mountain Queen’s cultivation had at least eight hundred years of age, which was more than the two of them combined.</p><p>“Black Mountain King, the unaware are not guilty. These two predators will be returned to you.” Beast King skillfully removed himself from the net and said helplessly.</p><p>Black Mountain King didn’t reply and remain seated on the throne. She spoke to the two predators, “Little fellows, you’re fortunate to run into me. Otherwise, you would have become others’ pets.”</p><p>When she said ‘pets’, nostalgia and hatred flickered in her eyes,</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>Just as the three were confronting each other, a spatial ripple arrived from far away, and a boundless aura made the three completely give up on resisting.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
