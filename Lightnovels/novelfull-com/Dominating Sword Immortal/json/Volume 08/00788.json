How fortunate! I’ve never exchanged blows with such barbarians. Let’s see if your brute strength is stronger or my fist!” The bald fatty swept his gaze around and saw the masked man suffering at the hands of the two brothers.</p><p>Both the brothers were super powerful half-step King experts. Being besieged by the two of them, no matter how powerful the masked man was, his figure had turned completely bloody, and he was at an absolute disadvantage. If not for the fact that the two brothers’ style didn’t have many variations and was blunt for the most part, he would have been hacked into meat paste long ago.</p><p>With his body as light as a swallow, the bald fatty floated to the masked man’s side and extended his puffy arm, blocking the elder brother’s giant axe.</p><p>The elder brother was called Daer Xiong while the younger was Daer Ba. The two brothers were the most talented disciples of the Oceanic Barbarian clan. Not being able to endure the clan’s rules and regulations, the two brothers left the clan and decided to forge their name in the world outside. By relying on their supreme defense and teamwork, the two raised winds wherever they went, but never suffered. Seeing that their combined assault had been broken by a fat, white-pig-like guy, they flew into a rage. The elder brother grasped the huge axe with the other hand as well and doubled the strength.</p><p>Creak!</p><p>The pressure on the fatty greatly increased. His knees went slightly soft, and his feet starting shaking along with the palace floor, creating metal-twisting sounds.</p><p>“Oh boy, his strength is nearing a million jin!” The fatty’s eyes opened wide. The veins on his forehead bulged before he roared and his body expanded like a balloon, bouncing off Daer Xiong.</p><p>“Big brother!” Daer Ba turned toward Daer Xiong.</p><p>The latter waved his hands and said, “I’ll leave the masked man to you and take care of this white pig. Keep in mind, don’t let down the name of Daer brothers.”</p><p>“Of course! My blood is boiling!” Daer Ba turned around and stared at the masked man with a peculiar gaze. His two eyes seemed to be burning like raging flames, and the barbaric power in his body was gradually restored.</p><p>“F*ck, what a lunatic!”</p><p>The masked man’s suffering could not be described with words. These two brothers’ physical toughness was simply incomparable, clearly nothing short of freaks. It would be stronger than body refiners of the same level by thirty percent at the very least.</p><p>“Seems like I have to give my two hundred percent.” A dangerous glint flickered in the masked man’s eyes.</p><p>On one side, the fatty was assisting to take some pressure off the masked man, and on the other, the middle-aged woman headed to assist the bushy bearded man against the yellow-robed woman. She could see that the yellow-robed woman’s strength ran too deep, and the bushy bearded man was not her opponent at all. If she were even a bit serious, the former would have no chance at all. As for Shi Shaobao, the middle-aged scholar, and the old man in a raincoat, they didn’t need her help. The opponents of the others also didn’t seem to be too strong, so she didn’t have to consider her options much.</p><p>“Eh, another one? Ganging up on me?” The yellow-robed woman softly swatted her slender palm, not only dissolving bushy bearded man’s hard power, but also causing the latter to stagger due to a push from the soft power. With a faint smile, the yellow-robed woman drew a circle in the void with her right hand, setting up an encirclement of silver needles.</p><p>“Soft profound!” The middle-aged woman approached step by step.</p><p>“That’s right! You’ve comprehended soft profound too, haven’t you?” The yellow-robed woman said.</p><p>The middle-aged woman didn’t reply, and instead spoke to the bushy bearded man, “You’ve comprehended the hard profound and I’ve soft profound. Let’s deal with her together.”</p><p>“Alright.” The bushy bearded man showed no hesitation. The yellow-robed threat was too much for him. She gave a feeling like that of a bone eating maggot. He had no idea how much of her strength she was using, while he had already exhibited ninety percent of his strength. The reason he didn’t reveal his full strength was because as soon as he increased his strength, her strength increased as well. Hence, he didn’t dare reveal all his strength.</p><p>When the middle-aged woman proposed to join hands, he would absolutely not refuse. One from left, one from right, the two indistinctly surrounded the yellow-robed woman. However, the latter seemingly turned a blind eye to it and beamed with smile, “Seems like I have to reveal some skill or I’ll be killed by you two.”</p><p>“Bring it on!”</p><p>The middle-aged woman operated her Zhen Yuan with great focus. If one could see through her body, one would discover numerous silver needles following her meridians and leading to her fingertips, feet, knees, elbows…It seemed her entire body was an artifact, allowing her to shoot silver needles from any place of her body.</p><p>Compared to the sinister battle occurring between the three, there was fiery battle happening on the other side. The two parties involved were Lin Yuxuan and the white-faced youngster.</p><p>Lin Yuxuan dared to challenge Shi Shaobao, so he naturally had some skill. He was brandishing his bronze halberd, emitting a halberd radiance in the form of azure dragons baring their fangs and brandishing their claws. The roar from the azure dragons created mighty shockwaves that battered the white-faced young man.</p><p>The latter’s fighting style was similar to his appearance, inclining toward gentle and soft. However, his style was different from the yellow-robed woman’s. Her style gave off a feeling of a poison needle hidden in silk floss, whereas his style was rather tyrannical in comparison.</p><p>Waving his fan, the white-faced youngster slapped away the azure dragon halberd radiance. Meanwhile, his left hand was not idle. Every once in a while, he abruptly shot fist energy at Lin Yuxuan, carrying a strange tail. It created water-like ripples in the void, affecting Lin Yuxuan’s follow up movements.</p><p>“Wyvern Breaks Water!” Lin Yuxuan roared. His entire being leaped up, thrusting out his three meters long halberd and fearlessly pressing forward as the azure dragon halberd radiance soared in the heavens.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>The white faced youngster waved his fan three times consecutively as the two brushed past each other.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>Spurting out a mouthful of blood, Lin Yuxuan stumbled down behind the white-faced youngster. However, the latter didn’t fare well either. His shoulder had been split open, pouring out blood.</p><p>One move, and both sides had been injured!</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>Not far away, an intense shockwave erupted in the sky above the palace. One side was pure white while the other was pitch black.</p><p>The two sides were the young woman and Murong Qingcheng respectively. One cultivated pure hard martial arts while the other cultivated dark martial arts. The two were evenly matched, and neither could injure their opponent. They could only clash again and again, hoping to win the contest of endurance.</p><p>“Dark Force Field!”</p><p>Amidst the retreat, a dark purple lightning flickered suddenly flickered around her body, and a warped force field enveloped the young woman.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>This force field contained a strong repulsive force. Originally, the young woman wouldn’t have been injured from this repulsive force. However, after exchanging countless blows with each other, both were somewhat weary. Adding her soaring blood Qi as the result of the recent exchange, she was unable to adjust her condition. She didn’t expect Murong Qingcheng to still have a trick up her sleeve.</p><p>Spurting out a mouthful of blood, the young woman’s figure shot back.</p><p>“Come back!”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng clenched her right hand in the void, grabbing the young woman and pulling her help with the help of dark gravitational force.</p><p>“Don’t go too far!”</p><p>The white Zhen Yuan on the young woman’s body ignited like white holy flames. With a cute shout, she punched at Murong Qingcheng while releasing a blinding white light.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>A pair of black wings suddenly appeared behind Murong Qingcheng’s back. A black Qi gushed out, and her figure suddenly disappeared before the young woman’s eyes. That invincible looking fist naturally hit the air before her.</p><p>“Not good!” The young woman immediately turned and punched backwards.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>The Murong Qingcheng flew back, and the young woman again spurted a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Richlight Oceanspan was a gathering of powerhouses, and Foursquare island was one of the very few flourishing islands here. Thus, it was naturally packed with powerhouses. Among all the experts fighting in the palace, who was not the cream of the crop? Upon returning to their territories, all of them would almost be unrivaled existences under Life and Death realm. Unfortunately, when elites met, unrivaled turned into rivaled, and suppressing their opponents was no longer easy.</p><p>For example, the frail middle-aged man battling Ye Chen seemed unimpressive at this moment, but if he were taken to True Spirit Continent, he would be at least in the top ten half-step Kings, if not top five.</p><p>However, as his luck would have it, he ran into Ye Chen.</p><p>His battle style was rendered useless before Ye Chen. His style focused on capitalizing on the opponent’s weakness. However, he had no option against Ye Chen, since the latter simply had no weak points. If one wished to beat him, one had to suppress him with an overwhelming advantage. Otherwise, it was an impossible feat.</p><p>Confronted with Ye Chen’s mysterious ghastly sword arts, the frail man was hopping about like a chicken. His movement technique, which was his ace, had been reduced to mere means of saving his life, unable to gain any advantage.</p><p>“I refuse to believe this!”</p><p>Having been struck repeatedly, the frail middle-aged man turned furious. His body turned into nine figures, and all nine of them attacked Ye Chen from every direction. At times, two attacked together, and sometimes three, while one would sacrifice itself at other times to create an opportunity for others.</p><p>“Go!” Ye Chen leaped high in the air and pointed his right hand, which had assumed a sword stance.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Nine sword images shot out.</p><p>Puff Puff!</p><p>All the figures of the middle-aged man were swept through, and his real body also retreated several steps.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Right at this moment, another frail middle-aged man appeared behind Ye Chen while the real body that had retreated several steps scattered into green mist with a puff. The doppelganger technique the frail middle-aged man had cultivated was a mid-heaven grade secret art, which not only allowed him to create doppelganger, but also a fake body. This fake body had almost no difference from the real body, except for not being made of flesh and blood. Its only weakness was that creating a fake body cost him forty percent of his Zhen Yuan. This was the reason he waited so long before using this move.</p><p>The frail middle-aged man clawed at Ye Chen’s head like lightning.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>His expression suddenly changed. The Ye Chen he pierced didn’t have any substance; it was just air.</p><p>“You have a secret doppelganger art, but I have my illusion art as well.” Appearing behind the frail middle-aged man, Ye Chen thrusted, impaling his brain.</p><p>Rip!</p><p>Pulling the sword back, Ye Chen rapidly retreated as the frail middle-aged man’s true body fell down from the sky. He didn’t expect that Ye Chen had also comprehended the illusion profound, and to an extent that even he was fooled by it.</p><p>Huff!</p><p>Landing on the ground, Ye Chen let out a breath of turbid air and said inwardly, “It was not easy.”</p><p>During his battle with the middle-aged man, Ye Chen didn’t reveal any of his killer moves. This was because the former had too many doppelgangers, and he couldn’t lock his killer move on his real body. If he forcefully used his killer moves, it would more than likely miss, and would have wasted his Zhen Yuan for no reason. Of course, Ye Chen had confidence in killing him with the Bewitching Mirror Shattering , but he didn’t wish to reveal this move at this point.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
