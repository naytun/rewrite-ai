In the sky several li away from it, a four-winged demonic black insect appeared at some point. This insect’s body was completely still, and only the four wings on its back oscillated rhythmically, keeping a state of complete equilibrium. At a glance, it seemed to have frozen there.</p><p>The round head of the insect was covered with numerous insect eyes, in which the island appeared. Although the island was far away, it was strangely magnified in its eyes. A few moments later, a person’s figure appeared in them.</p><p>This person was none other than Ye Chen.</p><p>…</p><p>Ye Chen had no idea that he was being watched by a four-winged demonic insect. After all, he was not made of iron. It was impossible to release his soul power at all times. The consumption of soul power was fast, but recovery was slow, and easily required half a month to recover completely.</p><p>Cultivating sword arts for half a day, Ye Chen saw that Murong Qingcheng’s cave still showed no commotion, and knew that she was still attacking the realm of half-step King. He could not go bother her. Although he had failed in his attempt, he had many other matters to accomplish in addition to that.</p><p>For example, comprehending the space profound.</p><p>The basics of space profound he obtained from the grave of Four Extreme Emperor was a priceless treasure, increasing his speed of comprehension by several folds. Moreover, his comprehension ability was already several times that of others. Adding the two factors, his speed was a dozen or even twenty times that of others in this area right now.</p><p>Returning back to his cave, he sat cross-legged and sucked in a deep breath, emptying his mind. Then he spread out his soul power in a perimeter of several hundred meters.</p><p>The lesser the range of soul power, the lesser was its consumption. With Ye Chen’s soul power, he could maintain a perimeter of several hundred meters for half a month easily.</p><p>Soul power was a sense that far exceeded other five senses. Under Ye Chen’s control, his soul power gradually captured the spatial ripples within several hundred meters.</p><p>Space rippled at all times. Of course, these ripples were minute to that extent that one could disregard them, but they existed nevertheless.</p><p>Space was illusory and unfathomable.</p><p>Soul power was formless and without substance, also unfathomable.</p><p>Thus, only soul power could catch these spatial ripples. This was also the reason all Life and Death King would have some understanding of the space profound, since their soul power was too powerful.</p><p>According to the knowledge in the basics of space profound, Ye Chen caught the spatial ripples with soul power while comprehending space profound at the same time.</p><p>In the other cave, Murong Qingcheng sat cross-legged motionlessly. Every few moments, her body emitted a black luster—sometimes bright, sometimes dim, sometimes violent, and at times reserved. The entire cave was flickering and twinkling with bizarre glows.</p><p>At this moment, Murong Qingcheng was in the late stage of her attempt.</p><p>She was different from Ye Chen. The demonic power essence within her body, after being refined, gave her an extremely pure demonic power. If she had not been restricted by realm, this demonic power essence could have easily been refined into half-step King grade demonic essence. After all, this demonic power essence was a portion of a Demon King’s demonic power essence. Refining it for her was more like diluting it. She first diluted this demonic power essence, then converted it into her demonic power.</p><p>With such a pure demonic power, Murong Qingcheng’s chances of entering half-step King realm were naturally much higher than humans and demonic humans alike.</p><p>Furthermore, with perfect demonic blood vessels, she had an even bigger advantage. With perfect demonic blood vessels as well as cultivating the fourth step demonic body, her vitality exceeded humans as well as demonic beasts, and was nearing the vitality of demon race.</p><p>Therefore, the ability of heart to create blood was extremely powerful, and thus, the ability of her heart to sustain load was also far higher than other humans of her level. For example, her blood circulation was normally more or less the same speed as that of Ye Chen. However, at this moment, the speed of her blood circulation was astonishing, and her heartbeat was simply terrifying. It could no longer be regarded as beat, but a vibration.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>Blood circulation normally produced no sound. However at this moment, Murong Qingcheng’s blood circulation was producing a sound of river flowing down the mountain. Such blood circulation made her white skin red, giving her a look of red beauty. Above her head, a white mist curled with a hint of red and reek of blood.</p><p>…</p><p>“It’s right here.”</p><p>A day later, a big group of uninvited guests arrived outside the island.</p><p>This group belonged to the troops dispatched by the Demonic Human Clan. They had a total of two hundred and two people—two half-step Demonic Kings and two hundred Sea of Soul experts. They were able to find this place thanks to the information passed on by the black-winged demonic insect.</p><p>As for why they could arrive a day later, that was because they were already not far away, and immediately moved as soon as they received the information.</p><p>“White Nightmare, I don’t think we can do much with just the two of us. Our best option is to use an enchantment and seal the island, keeping them here.” Amongst the two demonic human half-step Kings, the rather fat one spoke.</p><p>The other half-step King called White Nightmare had a bizarre appearance. His face and bald head were covered with white spots. His eyes were almost white, with only two small dots in the middle.</p><p>“That’s the best option…Use the Hidden Fog Enchantment!” White Nightmare faintly nodded while unblinkingly staring the island.</p><p>“You one hundred eight, get into formation! Surround the island and seal it with the Hidden Fog Enchantment. Don’t let a single fly come out.” The fat demonic man ordered the demonic humans behind him.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Without any need for name calling, a hundred and eight demonic humans voluntarily walked out and flew around the island.</p><p>Seeing his subordinates seal the island, the fat demonic man let out a sigh and said, “Killing demonic humans in Demonic Blood Ocean…I wonder what the enemy is after. Could it be Blood Sword Palace’s half-step King or Skeletal Island’s men?”</p><p>White Nightmare smiled coldly, “No matter if it’s Blood Sword Palace or Skeletal Island, anybody daring to kill demonic humans will have to pay the price.”</p><p>“Of course! Although the Blood Sword Palace and Skeletal Island are powerful, they are a lot weaker than us.” The fat demonic man smiled.</p><p>As the two were talking, along the periphery of the island, a hundred and eight dark-gray Qi pillars suddenly shot up before arcing and meeting at the center of the island. In the next moment, a dark grey light membrane surrounded the island. The scene inside the membrane warped and then completely disappeared. The light membrane also gradually transformed into mist. Looking from the outside, it seemed as if there was no island, but a region of thick mist.</p><p>“Success!” Seeing this scene, the fat demonic man let out a sigh of relief, and his smile intensified.</p><p>“I’ll go have a look at him.” White Nightmare indifferently spoke and then rushed toward the mist with a flicker.</p><p>“White Nightmare, don’t be rash!” The fat demonic man was astounded.</p><p>“Be at ease! You don’t believe in my strength? Moreover, with this enchantment, I can easily attack and retreat.” White Nightmare’s sound was left behind.</p><p>Hearing his words, the fat demonic man smiled bitterly.</p><p>He naturally knew about White Nightmare’s strength. Half a month ago, the strongest among the three half-step demonic human Kings that died was Gu Li, who was already considered a powerful half-step King. And White Nightmare’s strength was a notch above Gu Lie, considered a peak half-step King. Under similar levels, one demonic human could take on two humans. With White Nightmare’s strength, he could easily take on two peak half-step Kings.</p><p>However, killing three half-step demonic human Kings including Gu Li, and also more than thirty Sea of Soul realm demonic humans, was no small feat. White Nightmare might not be able to resist the enemy.</p><p>Fortunately, as White Nightmare said, with the enchantment, he could easily attack and retreat, and safety was not a major concern.</p><p>“Fine, let’s see how the enemy’s strength is! If it can be settled right now, no need to have others come over.” As soon as he thought up to this point, the fat demonic man looked up.</p><p>On the island, Ye Chen, who was comprehending the space profound, sensed a trace of abnormality.</p><p>Earlier on, he could feel powerful gales blowing past the mountain. But right now, it was dead silent on the island. It seemed as if the island had been separated from the world.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>His soul power, that was only within a few hundred meters, instantly expanded and covered the whole island, then spread out.</p><p>“Not good, an enchantment!”</p><p>His soul power ran into an obstruction as if stuck in a swamp. Moreover, in his soul perception, he could only see a region of black mist, gushing out without an end.</p><p>Rip!</p><p>A sword light flickered as Ye Chen pierced through the mountain and appeared in the sky above the island. In his line of sight, the ocean around the island had disappeared, replaced by layers of mist just like in his soul perception.</p><p>Right at this moment, a small hole appeared in the mist and two figures charged in.</p><p>“Demonic Humans!” Ye Chen squinted his eyes.</p><p>These two were White Nightmare and the fat demonic man, who were also sizing Ye Chen up.</p><p>“Was it you who killed my demonic human clansmen?” The fat demonic man roared.</p><p>Ye Chen expressionlessly replied. “You’ve sealed the island, so I’m afraid you’ve no intentions of confirming whether I’m the killer. Why waste your breath?”</p><p>As tyrannous as the demonic humans were, as long as one became a suspect, they would not be able to evade the responsibility.</p><p>“Then you really are the killer.” White Nightmare sized Ye Chen up and down before speaking coldly.</p><p>“Right!” Ye Chen didn’t intend to hide, neither was there any meaning to it.</p><p>“Good! To kill Gu Li, you have some strength. I, White Nightmare, will like to experience it myself.” Hearing Ye Chen admitting it himself, his body exploded with killing intent, assaulting forth like a malicious spirit.</p><p>“Come on then!”</p><p>Ye Chen was sure that he could cut the enchantment open. The enchantment was actually an application of spatial power and used the power of an array. He could easily poke a hole through it with the Void Shattering Finger. However, he could not leave the island currently. Murong Qingcheng was attempting her breakthrough. If she was interrupted at this crucial moment, she would need a long time before being able to attempt it again.</p><p>Therefore, he needed to first observe the situation, then plan his next move.</p><p>“Duo Long, you don’t need to act. I’ll face him.” White Nightmare said to the fat demonic man.</p><p>“Then be careful!”</p><p>The fat demonic man took a step back. His gaze intentionally or otherwise momentarily fell on Murong Qingcheng’s cultivation site, and a cold light flickered in his eyes.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
