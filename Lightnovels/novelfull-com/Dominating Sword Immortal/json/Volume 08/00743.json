It was only halfway to White Sheep King’s island.</p><p>The open land in the center was quite hot in itself. Fiery Qi would assault foreigners once in a while in the shape of various birds. However, after crossing the open land, Ye Chen discovered that the temperature was still increasing, rising from one thousand degrees to two thousand.</p><p>“The temperature before could already melt steel, but the temperature now can almost melt low grade metals.”</p><p>Metals were also divided into grades. Low grade metals could be forged into low grade artifacts and were extremely hard. The metals below low grade could only be forged into ordinary tools.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng said, “Lava ahead…It has a passage going down.”</p><p>“Lava…no wonder!”</p><p>The matters of True Spirit Continent couldn’t be understood through the reasoning of Ye Chen’s previous world. For example, the titanium alloy of that world wouldn’t even be a low grade metal in this world. The lavas of the two worlds were also two completely separate things. The lava of True Spirit Continent could easily reach several thousand degrees, differing according to the surroundings of course.</p><p>Soon, the three arrived before the lava.</p><p>It was also an open space like the graveyard’s center. However, this open space was filled with lava and scarlet rocks. At the center of the lava was a staircase heading downward. The temperature there was even higher than the surroundings, seeming as if the lower one went, the higher the temperature would get.</p><p>“Come, let’s go!” Ye Chen disregarded the temperature and strode forward, arriving above the staircase.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Murong Qingcheng and Sun Tianlang followed behind him.</p><p>Raising his protective Zhen Yuan, Ye Chen faintly took a breath and stepped on the staircase, heading down.</p><p>Creak!</p><p>Although the material of staircase was not transmitting heat, its external temperature was still rather high, creating a faint creaking sound due to its collision with the protective Zhen Yuan and emitting bursts of green mist.</p><p>Soon, the three followed the staircase and reached underneath.</p><p>“Ye Chen!”</p><p>The moment three stepped down, they heard a call. Ye Chen turned his head and saw Qin Liu and Yan Fengfeng, as well as many others not too far away. These people were circled around a lava lake with a perimeter of hundred meters. The color of this lava was not the usual reddish yellow, but blood red; it was exceptionally pure, without a trace of impurity.</p><p>At the center of the lava lake, a golden light rose from underneath, radiating a majestic and breathtaking energy ripple.</p><p>“Senior.” The three walked over.</p><p>Qin Lie smiled and said, “Good, you’re alright!”</p><p>“What is the situation here like?”</p><p>Yan Fengfeng pointed to the golden light ring and said, “There is a semi extreme grade tree of Sky Fiend Fire Spirit Fruit.”</p><p>“Sky Fiend Fire Spirit Fruit?” Ye Chen had heard the name for the first time.</p><p>“What? Sky Fiend Fire Spirit Fruit?” Sun Tianlang blurted with astonishment.</p><p>Ye Chen looked at him, “Elder brother Sun, you know the Sky Fiend Fire Spirit Fruit?”</p><p>Sun Tianlang said, “A ten thousand years old Sky Fiend Spirit Fruit is a supreme grade spirit fruit. Eating one will allow a King Spirit Body to improve by one step. Normally, both ordinary Kings and titled monarchs have fifth step spirit bodies. But, after eating a supreme grade Sky Fiend Spirit Fruit, it will upgrade to the sixth step. The difficulty to improve the spirit body becomes extremely hard as one goes higher. Eight thousand years ago, there was a body refiner King who upgraded his spirit body to the sixth step, and his strength was astonishing. But, he then chanced upon a fifty thousand years old supreme Sky Fiend Fire Spirit Fruit, raising his sixth step body directly to the eighth step and instantly transforming into an unrivaled King. Even titled monarchs were not his match.”</p><p>“Fifty thousand years old Sky Fiend Fire Spirit Tree can improve one by two steps, moreover from sixth to eighth!”</p><p>Ye Chen was astounded. Raising the spirit body’s level would get increasingly hard as one went higher. Fifth step was the norm for Life and Death Kings, and even titled monarchs only had fifth step spirit bodies. Kings who took the route of body cultivation were actually the ones who could attain the sixth step spirit body. The difference between fifth step and sixth step was huge, not to mention the difference between fifth step and eighth step; It was simply a difference between the heaven and earth. Thus, to sweep through all kings under the heavens was not surprising at all.</p><p>Sun Tianlang continued, “Of course, fifty thousand years old or higher Sky Fiend Fire Spirit Fruits are exceptionally rare. It was the only precedent. After all, it’s not an ordinary fruit that could easily reach ten thousand years of maturity.”</p><p>Qin Liu nodded and said, “This one is five thousand years old at most. It won’t improve the spirit body by one step, but half a step won’t be an issue. If you’re at the peak of the fourth step, it will most likely raise it to fifth step.”</p><p>Fifth step spirit body was the body of Kings!</p><p>“Most people here have fourth step spirit bodies. I’m afraid that this fruit will make everybody go crazy.” Ye Chen employed his soul eyes and saw a meter long purplish-red small tree underneath the lava. On the tree was a purple fruit, occasionally flickering with a red glow.</p><p>Qin Liu said, “There are so many people here, but only a few really have the chance to obtain it, such as the Punishment King, Ice Spear King, Moqi Tiger, Forest King, and a few others. Once the fruit ripens, I’ll head down alone. You all wait here.”</p><p>She was not aware that Ye Chen’s strength had reached a frightening degree, and even Wind Storm King and Iron Hand King had died at his hands. However, this couldn’t be blamed on her. Who could guess that just a minor breakthrough would allow Ye Chen’s strength to have such a drastic increase?</p><p>“Senior, I’ll go down with you.” Ye Chen was also somewhat tempted by the Sky Fiend Fire Fruit. Who wouldn’t want to strengthen their spirit body?</p><p>“You’ll go down with me?” Qin Liu’s frowned and looked towards Ye Chen.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng explained for Ye Chen, “Senior, Ye Chen has reached the late Sea of Soul realm, and has become very strong.”</p><p>She didn’t tell that he had killed the Wind Storm King and Iron Hand King. This was not the time after all.</p><p>“Right, Ye Chen’s strength will certainly give you a big surprise.” Sun Tianlang spoke confidently.</p><p>“Eh? Then, be extremely careful!”</p><p>She was still not too convinced. However, Ye Chen’s strength was already not weak. With the improvement in his cultivation base, his progress should not be too small.</p><p>“By the way senior, this fruit is so formidable, so the tree should be possible to cultivate as well, right?” Instead of only one fruit, if one obtained the tree itself, they would have a steady supply of the fruits.</p><p>Qin Liu smiled bitterly, “It would have been really good if that were the case, but the Sky Fiend Fire Spirit Tree is very peculiar. It immediately dies out after producing one fruit. It may do so in a thousand years, five thousand years, or ten thousand years. There is no clear rule. One can only count on their luck. That’s why the Sky Fiend Fire Spirit Tree is considered top grade amongst spirit fruits.”</p><p>“I see.” Ye Chen had been intending to snatch the tree itself. Such a fortune could be only chanced upon and not sought after.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>Suddenly, huge waves emerged at the lake’s center, spreading outwards. At the same time, scorching Qi currents radiated out.</p><p>“So hot!”</p><p>The numerous experts circled around lava lake retreated one after another, leaving behind only a few powerful ones.</p><p>“I’m afraid the temperature of these Qi currents is above five thousand degrees.” Ye Chen could no longer judge the temperature at such a high degree, and could only form a rough estimate according to his perception.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>The intensity of waves kept increasing, and in the end, huge bubbles sprouted on the lake’s surface. The bubbles were pure golden in color. Upon leaving the lake’s surface, they abruptly exploded, giving off even hotter currents than before. Sweat appeared even on Ye Chen’s body. Although his strength was high, his cultivation base was only at late Sea of Soul realm, which was inferior to the half step King realm.</p><p>“The fruit has ripened.” Qin Liu’s eyes shone.</p><p>Evidently, others had also guessed the same. Such a phenomenon only had this one conclusion to be drawn. The crowd near the lake stirred instantly and the air tensed.</p><p>However, strangely, not even one person made a move, as if everybody had some apprehensions.</p><p>“Fortunes lie in danger!” One half step King’s figure flickered, charging toward the lava lake. The people around him hesitated, but didn’t follow him in the end.</p><p>Qin Liu said to Ye Chen, “There is an indescribable danger under the lake. The first one to go down will face the most danger. Even the slightest bit of carelessness will result in calamity. We’ll wait.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Ye Chen faintly nodded. The first one to go down indeed faced the greatest danger. Even if they could get the fruit, they would be targeted by everybody else. Perhaps this half step King believed his strength to be quite good and wished to make out with the fruit. If he succeeded, fifth step spirit body was just around the corner for him.</p><p>Splash!</p><p>Lava splashed as the Demi King dove straight in. Meanwhile, Ye Chen employed his soul eyes and carefully watched.</p><p>Apart from the lava, the lake also had countless fiery Qi currents. Upon reaching the surface, these gales formed bubbles. The half step King dodged the gales incessantly and slowly advanced toward the fruit. Soon, he was merely fifty meters away from the fruit when a golden Qi current suddenly shot up and brushed past him.</p><p>An astonishing scene occurred: the half step King’s entire body disintegrated into ashes before he could let out a sound. Only the semi extreme grade artifacts on his body were left behind, sinking into the depths of the lake.</p><p>“This golden Qi current is frightening.”</p><p>Ye Chen’s pupils shrank. He couldn’t sense the golden Qi current’s temperature from outside. But, to instantly turn a half step King into ashes, it was clearly terrifying.</p><p>The first person to go was dead, so the remaining ones began hesitating even more, glancing at each other. They were absolutely not willing to give up, but first of all, they needed to ascertain the dangers of the lake. They hoped that somebody else could test the waters for them. Of course, prerequisite was that this person’s strength was not too high. Otherwise, if this person got their hands on the fruit, it would be over for them.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
