People who had been dead for centuries can still be revived! This is against the rules of nature…This cannot be allowed!” The elder mumbled to himself.</p><p>Jin Wanshuang said, “According to the records, the palace had been ruined fifty thousand years ago which means these people have been dead for at least that amount of time.”</p><p>“Fifty thousand years…Even Life and Death Realm warriors’ bones would be fossils by now. These four people do not even look like they were king warriors.” Ye Chen examined those people with his soul eyes and realized that there was no Zhen yuan or any other energy in their bodies. There was only endless evil qi which flourished from within their bodies. It was already highly infused into the bodies, such that as long as the evil qi did not run out, their bodies could not be destroyed at all. As for whether they had intelligence or not, no one knew.</p><p>The women in yellow analysed, “They should have been sealed away inside these coffins by an evil secret art. Although they have been long dead, the vitality within their body did not dissipate at all. After years of nourishment, they have been perfectly infused with the evil qi and turned into another life form.”</p><p>“Neither humans, nor corpses…but another life form?”</p><p>All of them frowned, as this had reached beyond their imagination.</p><p>“All this bull crap! Just watch me, Daer Ba, kill them all.” Daer Ba took a step forward and crossed his blades, throwing out a crossed blade light as he flew toward the middle-aged man.</p><p>Pooh!</p><p>Perhaps it was the middle-aged man’s slow reflexes or Daer Ba’s extremely fast speed, the crossed blade light landed accurately on the opponent’s chest, tearing open a crossed wound. The wound was covering a rich evil qi, and no blood spill could be seen.</p><p>“It recovered!” The elder mumbled to himself.</p><p>Everyone looked over at the middle-aged man’s wounds where the evil qi had turned into solid flesh, which recovered the wounds. Looking from afar, there were no marks left at all.</p><p>The middle-aged man looked down at the chest as if that crossed blade attack had woken up his consciousness, and then roared into the air. The cry sounded like a ghost groan as well as a wolf howl. At that moment, all of the lights on the thirty-third floor had a layer of frost on them. The light could barely go through, but it was still burning. Meanwhile, a vague sound wave spread out toward Ye Chen and the group.</p><p>Besides Ye Chen, Murong Qingchengg and the woman in yellow, the others groaned a little as they could feel their souls being shattered. They did not have Ye Chen’s five times more powerful soul power, neither his sword spirits. They also did not have Murong Qingchengg’s perfect half step demon bloodline or her demon soul, and had nothing like the woman in yellow’s mysterious power. With only half step king warriors’ soul defense layer, it would be hard to cancel out the sound wave completely.</p><p>Without a sound, the middle-aged man disappeared from where he was standing. When he reappeared, he had already arrived before Daer Ba. Holding the battle axe in his hand, he threw out an attack toward his skull.</p><p>“Piss off!”</p><p>Daer Ba did not expect that the middle-aged man would be this fast, so he was caught a bit off guard. Savage people’s innate recklessness had made him forget about life and death. He crossed his blades in front of him before throwing out an attack at the middle-aged man’s neck without caring about anything. A deathly battle began without any prior sign.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>The middle-aged man’s battle axe stabbed through Daer Ba’s defensive zhen yuan layer, leaving a tiny blood hole on his forehead with the blood frozen. Meanwhile, both of his blades had almost cut off the middle-aged man’s skull as well. The crossed blade mark almost went through his whole chest.</p><p>“Brother!” Daer Xiong roared as he held onto his axe while holding the jade ruler in the other hand and throwing an attack toward the middle-aged man. The massive axe had only broken open the man’s body slightly while the jade ruler somehow canceled out some of his evil qi like the bright sun melting through the thick snow.</p><p>The middle-aged man looked shocked and hurried to back out, but Daer Xiong chased after him quickly, waving his massive axe and jade ruler together in the air and covering the other.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>The middle-aged man’s body suddenly shattered, turning into a beam of blurry evil qi going back to where he was standing amongst the other three people. His wounds had recovered completely, but if observed carefully, one could see that the evil qi had slightly thinned down a bit.</p><p>“The jade ruler can cancel out his evil qi!” Ye Chen draw the conclusion first and exchanged a look with Murong Qingchengg.</p><p>“Brother!”</p><p>Daer Xiong gave up on chasing the middle-aged man and came back to his younger brother’s body, shaking his still body.</p><p>The latter’s pupils had dilated, and on his forehead was a nail-sized blood hole, from which evil qi kept pouring out.</p><p>“Dead!”</p><p>The elder shook his head regrettably. Everything happened way too fast, and they did not have the time to help at all.</p><p>“F**k you!” Daer Xiong screamed and then started to cry hysterically.</p><p>“This place is not good to stay for long.” The cold teenager frowned and said.</p><p>The woman in yellow nodded, “As long as the evil qi is not removed, their bodies would not be destroyed at all. Besides, there is still one more coffin that’s closed.”</p><p>Daer Ba’s body was extremely powerful, but he could still not block out the middle-aged man’s attack. So, it was not hard to tell how powerful this middle-aged man was. Of course, it still had something to do with the half step extreme rank great item. However, the person still sealed away in that coffin in the center must be even more powerful than any of them. It might even by the Mysterious Evil King’s body itself.</p><p>“I am afraid we cannot get out now.” Murong Qingchengg said suddenly.</p><p>“How come?”</p><p>Everyone turned around.</p><p>No one knew when it happened, but the entrance to the thirty-third floor had been blocked by four coffins that were covered in evil qi.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Jin Wanshuang held the monster hunting stick in his hands before throwing out an attack. A bright golden light appeared and the coffins started to shake continuously while some of the evil qi was destroyed.</p><p>“Damn!”</p><p>The elder lifted up his purple gold cloth which shot out a beam of purple-golden light, shining over the evil qi that covered the coffins. A sizzling sound was heard as the evil qi started to vaporize like water touching a hot pan. But, what made them frown was that no matter how much evil qi was destroyed, the same amount of evil qi would pour out of the coffins, as if they were inexhaustible sources of the evil qi.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ye Chen took out his Evil shattering sword and slashed onto the evil qi. The evil shattering sword was the item that possessed the greatest attacking power. A huge amount of evil qi was decimated with this move, the attack almost reaching the coffins. However, it was still not enough.</p><p>Seeing that Ye Chen and the group were attacking the coffin lids, the middle-aged man and his people started to attack, making the blurry evil qi spread out toward the group. If the group did not try their best to block out the evil qi, their blood would likely be frozen in their veins, and by then, they would be free to be killed or wounded. Therefore, they had to give up on attacking the coffin lids and turn out to face the four.</p><p>According to what happened before, everyone already knew that the evil destroying items would be their best choice when attacking these evil creatures. The four of them who carried evil destroying items separated out and took on an evil being each, while the other three aided them from the side, canceling out the evil qi.</p><p>Daer Ba had been killed, which made Daer Xiong furious at the middle-aged man. He put away his massive axe and started to attack him with his jade ruler. The cold-looking teenager was the one aiding him on the side.</p><p>Over on the other side, Jin Wanshuang took on the thick looking lady alone while the elder and the woman in yellow took on the evil elder. As for Murong Qingchengg, she naturally fought alongside Ye Chen against the skinny young man.</p><p>“Darkness Devour!”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng formed a spell with both of her hands. Meanwhile, a black light ball kept spinning and clasping right next to the skinny young man, trying to devour him. But, that evil qi he carried was way too strong, and it froze the dark light ball instead.</p><p>Whoo!</p><p>The skinny young man turned into evil qi and attacked toward Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>“Cut!”</p><p>Holding his Evil shattering sword, Ye Chen took a step forward and threw out a sword attack at the evil qi.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>Some of the evil qi was shattered and the skinny young man reappeared, battling with Ye Chen. He no longer had the time to attack Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>Both the Evil shattering sword and the weapon the skinny young man held were pseudo extreme rank items, one carrying an evil decimating power while the other contained the evil power. They were like fire and water, but Ye Chen soon realized to his annoyance that no matter how much evil qi he took care of, the evil qi inside the tower would nourish him back to full “health”. All of the attacks he made seemed useless.</p><p>“Let’s see how much more evil qi you have to nourish you back.” Ye Chen squinted his eyes while the Evil shattering sword in his hand was used smoothly as he performed his spiritual sword attack. Countless sword shadows appeared out of nowhere, covering the other completely.</p><p>Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!</p><p>Judging on battling techniques, the skinny young man could not compete with Ye Chen at all, and was wounded completely all over his body.</p><p>“Waning Moon!”</p><p>Ye Chen performed hundreds of sword attacks in a row and then waved up his arms, letting a beam of sword power to shoot out, slicing through the skinny young man.</p><p>This sword was way too powerful, and the skinny young man was cut in two halves. The evil qi was almost half gone.</p><p>Besides Ye Chen, the others had slowly gained the upper hand; with the evil shattering items in hand, they would have been able to beat the others by now for sure if not for the evil qi that kept nourishing them.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The monster hunting stick in Jin Wanshuang’s hand was extremely aggressive. With one stick attack, half of the lady’s body had been shattered while a massive wave of golden light kept spreading out.</p><p>“Come back!”</p><p>The elder held his purple gold cloth and beams of purple-golden light shot out, puncturing through the evil elder’s body. Some of the evil qi kept crawling into the purple gold cloth, which was then purified into nothing.</p><p>With the jade ruler’s protection, Daer Xiong sliced down layer after layer of evil qi off the evil middle-aged man.</p><p>The evil qi inside the tower was thinning down rapidly. At that moment, the coffin in the centre moved vaguely without anyone noticing, since they were also busy with the battles.</p><p>The coffin then slowly moved more and more drastically.</p><p>The seven people were battling there on the thirty-third floor while Shi Shaobao and his people had been blocked out as well. No matter what they tried, no one was able to move the coffins by even an inch.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Shi Shaobao roared in his natural form as a beam of golden light landed on the coffin lids. With a loud sound, the six of them were blown out by the reflected power and landed back onto the thirty-second floor.</p><p>Outside the tower, an elder in black had arrived some time ago. He looked like the highest floor and then his body suddenly disappeared completely. But soon, he was bounced back to where he was standing.</p><p>“I cannot enter the surreal space!” The elder had a surprised look on his face. “Ah well, the more mysterious this tower is, the more valuable the treasure would be.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
