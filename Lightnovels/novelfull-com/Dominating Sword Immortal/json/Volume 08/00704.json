Along with it, more and more Sea of Soul experts rushed over to towns and cities near Nine Dragon Lake. Even Sea of Soul Masters could be frequently seen. Such a sight would have simply been inconceivable in the past.</p><p>Restaurants and bars were filled with all kinds of discussions.</p><p>“West Ocean Sword Master, Liu Wujian’s name is soaring in the heavens. Even Master Sky Sword was not his opponent. Now, I’m a little worried if he could really sweep all the geniuses of Sky Martial Region.”</p><p>“That’s too ridiculous! No matter what, my True Spirit Continent is the place most overflowing with talent. It’s not something West Ocean can match.”</p><p>“Don’t speak like that. Who says a peerless genius can’t be born in a desolate corner of the world? Moreover, West Ocean had always stood strong amongst the four oceans, with only North Ocean as its match.”</p><p>“Eh, seems like this world is much more frightening than we imagined! Although West and North Ocean had been flourishing with talents before, the chances of producing a supreme genius like Liu Wujian was minuscule. What do you think? The Life and Death Kings of this century will be far higher than the past or not?”</p><p>“Quite possible! In the past, about ten Life and Death Kings appeared in a century, at most twenty. This time, I’m afraid it will be no less than thirty, or even more.”</p><p>The number of Life and Death Kings born was the most in early ancient era. Although not so numerous that they could be seen everywhere, they were still common. In mid ancient era, this number sharply declined. In that late ancient era, it directly declined by twice, and in the current times, it had declined by several folds. If thirty or more Life and Death Kings were born within a hundred years, it would meet the standard of late ancient era.</p><p>…</p><p>Dugu Clan…</p><p>Dugu Jue walked out of the Devil Cave. His expression was calm; his previous scared out of wits appearance was nowhere to be seen. It seemed as if the Devil Cave no longer affected him at all.</p><p>He walked over to a nearby wooden signboard and tore off a white paper pinned on it.</p><p>Dugu Jue frequently entered closed-door cultivation. Afraid that he would lose contact with the outside world, he commanded his men to write the important affairs of Sky Martial Region and True Spirit Continent on paper. Therefore, even if he didn’t go out, he could be in touch with important affairs of the world.</p><p>“West Ocean Sword Master—Liu Wujian.”</p><p>As he saw the information regarding Liu Wujian, his eyes squinted.</p><p>“Interesting! He actually defeated Master Sky Sword and also had a face off with Ye Chen. To claim to be Ye Chen’s opponent, he certainly won’t be weak. Whatever, let me see what tricks you have. And if you’re qualified to be my, Dugu Jue’s opponent.”</p><p>He folded the paper into a ball and threw it into the sky.</p><p>“Devil Cave no longer has any effect on me, unless I can open the seal and enter the floor below. But if the seal weakens, the devil will certainly seize the opportunity and attack the seal in an attempt to break free. That would be unwise. No hurry…let’s hold it until I enter late Sea of Soul realm.”</p><p>Like Ye Chen, he was also stuck at the peak of mid Sea of Soul realm. Entering late Sea of Soul realm was inevitable, without a doubt. However, it would require some time.</p><p>Striding ahead, Dugu Jue left the cave.</p><p>…</p><p>Unwittingly, September had arrived.</p><p>On the sixteenth, multitudes of Sea of Soul realm experts headed toward Nine Dragon Mountain in an endless stream.</p><p>On seventeenth, all who should have come had come. At the center of Nine Dragon Mountain, a sea of people was surrounding Nine Dragon Lake, the clamor reaching the sky.</p><p>Shua Shua Shua Shua!</p><p>This was also the day most of the geniuses arrived. Bai Wuxue, Yan Fengfeng, Lu Shaoyou, Situ Hao, Bei Minghui, Chu Zhongtia…Apart from a few, all the top geniuses under the heavens had all arrived to have a look at this so-called West Ocean Sword Master, and how far his strength really went.</p><p>A crowd was gathered around Lu Shaoyou, and included within was Bai Wuxue.</p><p>“Elder Brother Lu, you exchanged blows with West Ocean Sword Master six months ago. How is his strength?” He asked.</p><p>Lu Shaoyou was silent for a moment, then slowly spoke,” Very strong!”</p><p>Hearing these words, Bai Wuxue’s face turned stern. Lu Shaoyou’s words would seem vague to others. Everybody knew he was very strong, but how strong? It was tantamount to not answering at all. However, Bai Wuxue was familiar with him. If West Ocean Sword Master was only a bit stronger than him, he would not have used the two words ‘very strong’. To make him use these two words, West Ocean Sword Master was an extremely dangerous figure without a doubt.</p><p>“Although, it’s not as if my strength had not progressed during these six months!” A cold light flickered in Luo Shaoyou’s eyes.</p><p>Bai Wuxue nodded, not adding anything.</p><p>“Hehe, my Defensive Sword Control Art has already been cultivated to the realm of third layer. Although it can only produce three identical swords, it’s a lot stronger than the realm of second layer. The exchange with Ye Chen has really helped me, allowing me to comprehend the Fast Profound, and thus, vastly increasing my sword speed. West Ocean Liu Wujian, let me see how strong you really are!”</p><p>Situ Hao stood alone on a summit while smiling. He was aware that he was not Liu Wujian’s opponent. But, as far as he was concerned, as long as he could last for a while against such a figure, he could be proud of himself. This would be proof that he’d enough potential to catch up.</p><p>His thoughts turned to Ye Chen, “Ye Chen has my Sword Control Art. I wonder what realm has he cultivated it to…Probably second layer, and certainly not be above the peak of second layer. If there is a chance, I must compete our Sword Control Arts. Let’s see who has made more progress.”</p><p>The night passed by, and eighteenth September arrived.</p><p>“Haha!”</p><p>On the first ray of light, three figures flew over ripping through the air. The individual standing in the middle, if not Liu Wujian, who else could it be?</p><p>“West Ocean Sword Master, Liu Wujian…”</p><p>“Liu Wujian is here!”</p><p>The crowd around the lake broke into a commotion, sizing up the three figures and then finally focusing on the person in the middle.</p><p>Liu Wenjian’s figure was not robust at all, even a little frail. His slender arms looked like bamboo poles, as if carrying some demonic power. On his mediocre face were two long and sharp eyes. His bridge of nose was also a bit excessively higher. It was a face that would attract attention at a glance.</p><p>Taking a look around, Liu Wenjian failed to spot Ye Chen, and his corner of mouth raised into an arc.</p><p>“Hmph! Is this the continent’s Sword Master? He doesn’t even dare show his face!” The multicolor-robed woman sneered.</p><p>“No hurry! There are a lot of interesting people here. We can play for a while.” Liu Wenjuan said indifferently.</p><p>“There are quite a few experts.” The majestic young man’s apathetic eyes gradually sharpened. If he were a stone before, at this moment, he was like steel. The aura he gave off at this moment was actually not much weaker than Liu Wenjian. The latter was the red flower while he was the most prominent leaf.</p><p>“So, you’re Liu Wenjian.”</p><p>The first to come out was Bei Minghui. Geniuses never gave up. Even when he knew that he was not a match for his opponent, he still insisted for a round.</p><p>“You don’t raise my interest at all.” Liu Wenjian gave him a glance, then shook his head.</p><p>“Interested or not, you’ll soon know. First, take my spear.”</p><p>Bei Minghui took out the silver flood dragon spear on his back and swept it across. An incorporeal spear radiance appeared on the other side, ignoring a major part of the distance. It was none other than Near Heaven’s End.</p><p>“Nalan, go face him.” Liu Wenjian spoke to the multicolor-robed woman.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>She leaped up while a silver colored whip appearing in her hand, whipping toward the corporeal silver light. The extremely swift silver light suddenly seemed as if it sunk into swamp, turning sluggish before being shattered by the whip.</p><p>“So powerful! This is Bei Minghu, ranked within the top twenty of the Masters Ranking. His killer move was actually blocked by a woman beside Liu Wenjian.”</p><p>“Don’t panic…He still has the second style of Near Heaven’s End.”</p><p>There were many familiar with Bei Minghui’s killer move. Not to mention, he couldn’t possibly have not made any progress. He might even have developed the third style.</p><p>“Second Style!”</p><p>Sure enough, when Bei Minghui saw his first style being broken, his face sunk slightly, and he immediately unleashed the second style. The next moment, five beams of silver arcs assaulted the multicolor-robed woman from different directions with much higher speed and stealth.</p><p>“Bloodsucker Three Strikes.”</p><p>The multicolor-robed woman acted almost at the same time as Bei Minghui, using the same move she used against Murong Qingcheng. Her whip shook, and a three-headed red python condensed, the three pythons ramming into the five silver arcs.</p><p>Puff Puff Puff! The silver arcs were pierced by the python heads and gradually dissipated.</p><p>“If you only have this much strength, your loss is certain.”</p><p>The Multicolor-robed woman suffered a loss at the hands of Murong Qingcheng, but it didn’t imply she was weaker than the latter. After all, she had been a little careless back then, and wasn’t able to exhibit her full power. Not to mention, Murong Qingcheng herself was quite strong, and could rank at least within top ten of the Masters Ranking.</p><p>“What a joke! I’ve yet to use my true strength.”</p><p>Bei Minghui’s face turned grave. Just now, he had been somewhat looking down on the multicolor-robed woman, thinking that Liu Wenjian was merely trying to ignore him. However, as of now, his attitude had changed completely. This woman’s strength was a lot higher than he’d expected. If he didn’t use his full strength here, he could really lose.</p><p>“Third style, Sky’ End Eternal Separation!”</p><p>His figure split into two, and both Bei Minghui simultaneously executed the first style. Although it was the first style, their aura seemed completely opposite compared to each other, as if one was light and the other darkness. As the two auras merged, an exceptional transformation immediately occurred in the first style. An extraordinary, boundless silver light expanded upto hundreds and thousands of folds within an instant, shooting out and cleaving through the clouds.</p><p>“This Bei Minghui really did develop the third style. Once this move is completed, his ranking will probably go up several places, and might even enter the top ten.” The spectators were shocked inwardly.</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>The multicolor-robed woman’s pupils shrunk, as this spear was far out of her expectation. She actually felt as if she wouldn’t be able to resist it.</p><p>“Dragon Vanquisher!”</p><p>Under the enormous pressure, the multicolor-robed woman eventually used her most powerful ace. Red colored Zhen Yuan poured into the whip, which seemingly turned into chains and immediately coiled around the incoming spear light.</p><p>Creak Creak!</p><p>Sparks flew around as the whip and spear light fiercely struggled against each other, neither seemingly able to win. In the end, the spear light which seemed like a trapped flood dragon suddenly burst out into different directions.</p><p>“You lose!”</p><p>Not wasting any time, the multicolor-robed woman flung the whip, striking on Bei Minghui’s Protective Zhen Yuan.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>The latter spurted out a mouthful of blood and flew off.</p><p>“Bei Minghui lost!”</p><p>Everybody sucked in a breath of cold air. If Liu Wenjian had defeated him, it wouldn’t have meant much. After all, what kind of strength did the latter possess? But, he was defeated by this woman in multicolored robes.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
