Too crude and simple.”</p><p>“Golden Wind Water Moon? That’s alright, but not apt.”</p><p>“Waning Moon? Yeah, Waning Moon—this name is good. It’s meaningful…Let’s call it Waning Moon!”</p><p>Naming a martial art was an art in itself. It should conform to one’s style whilst closely being related to the martial art’s effect. Although Waning Moon seemed relatively mainstream, simple was indeed the best.</p><p>“Waning Moon with eighty percent metal profound and water profound has already crossed the threshold of high grade profound skills. This stone wall is several times stronger than normal walls. Previously, even if I had used the Thunder Disaster Sword, I wouldn’t have been able to blast it open. But now, I can do it just by using a finger-sword. This is a severe increase, almost ten times over. How frightening!”</p><p>The former Golden Hurricane or current Waning Moon was a high grade profound martial skill, but Ye Chen had only cultivated it to fifty percent completion. But as of now, not only was it a high grade profound martial skill, its power had also reached the level of high grade profound martial skills. Most importantly, it still had a lot of potential left. If he could reach greater success in both metal and water profounds and combine them, it could definitely become a peak profound martial skill.</p><p>Of course, that was not an easy task.</p><p>The comprehension of profound got increasingly difficult as one went higher, especially at the realm of greater success. Without suitable opportunity and exceptional comprehension, one wouldn’t be able to cross this threshold throughout their life, much less to speak of taking two profounds to realm of greater success. The reason Ye Chen could improve all his profounds under the state of being one with the world was that his soul was five times stronger compared to ordinary people, and thus, had five times the comprehension, allowing him to make such astonishing progress. If it had been someone else, even a ten percent increase in all profounds would have been a good result.</p><p>“The profounds contained in sword moves have all been improved. Now, it’s time for the space profound.”</p><p>Void Shattering Finger was a finger art. Although the space profound it contained was frightening, it wouldn’t have much effect in increasing battle strength. Therefore, he left it for the last. The time duration of being one with the world was short. Who knew when it would end?</p><p>When Ye Chen had cultivated the third style of Void Shattering Finger to hundred percent completion, his space profound had reached ten percent completion. It seemed low, but it was not actually all that weak. In any case, the space profound was one of the strongest profounds. Ten percent completion of space profound was equivalent to thirty percent of thunder profound. Therefore, its cultivation was quite slow.</p><p>Being in the state of one with the world, Ye Chen eventually brushed past the fabric of space profound and slowly progressed.</p><p>Fifteen!</p><p>Twenty!</p><p>Twenty five!</p><p>In the end, his space profound didn’t attain minor success, stopping at about twenty eight percent. Nonetheless, Ye Chen was quite satisfied with this result.</p><p>Time Emperor, Space King…These words were not false. Although the current Void Shattering Finger was not his current primary martial skill, there was nothing stopping him from creating his own space profound sword move in future. Once he created a space profound sword move, his strength would increase drastically.</p><p>The duration of being one with the heaven was too short. He once again visited all the profounds, trying to get further improvement. Just as he reached slow profound, the state of being one with the world dissipated. Since the difference was too big, Ye Chen felt as he if he had suddenly turned a lot dumber. His comprehension had dropped sharply after all.</p><p>“Fast profound and slow profound are like light and dark. The light is easy to understand, but to understand dark, one has to understand the light to a greater extent. To improve the slow profound, I must cultivate the fast profound to a certain level.”</p><p>Slow profound was too mysterious, so much so that Ye Chen still hadn’t been able to integrate it into his sword. Integration through force would only lead to disharmony, and would instead create a huge decline in might.</p><p>Huff!</p><p>Letting out a deep breath, Ye Chen opened his eyes, two bright gleams flickering within.</p><p>“Two more days…Two days should be enough to stabilize my Zhen Yuan.” Ye Chen was fully aware of the concept of honing the knife before chopping wood. If he left now, he admittedly wouldn’t have to be afraid, but he would not be at his peak strength. If something unexpected happened, it would be too late for regrets. Thus, it would simply be better to wait for two more days, stabilize his cultivation base, and then head out.</p><p>Two days quietly passed by.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The heavy entrance of the stone room exploded open and an illusory figure rushed out.</p><p>After cruising through Gray Wolf King’s grave for a while, Ye Chen didn’t find a single person. Upon pondering for a moment, he immediately figured out that everybody must have moved onto the second graveyard of Firebird King.</p><p>A maze was a maze. Regardless of how complicated it was, it could always be resolved by spending some time. Two hours passed by, and Ye Chen finally arrived before Fire Bird King’s graveyard.</p><p>“Who opened this one? Xia Houzun?”</p><p>It was known that there were three possessors of the keys. One was Ye Chen himself, one was jIang Tian, and one was Xia Houzun. Jian Tian had the first key, and Ye Chen had the third, thus the second key had fifty percent chance of being with Xia Houzun.</p><p>Shua!</p><p>With a flicker, Ye Chen’s figure entered the graveyard.</p><p>Fire King Bird’s graveyard was emitting a rather fiery aura. If ordinary Sea of Soul realm experts entered and carelessly absorbed this aura, it would cause internal injuries. And if it continued to enter deeper, it would become increasingly vicious.</p><p>Sha!</p><p>Streaking across a dark golden channel, the fiery Qi before Ye Chen suddenly condensed into a fire bird, pouncing on him.</p><p>‘This Fire Bird King is a lot stronger than Gray Wolf King. The aura here can actually condense into matter.’ Scattering the fire bird with a flick of his fingers, Ye Chen said inwardly.</p><p>Ye Chen didn’t know that the Fire Bird King was not too strong compared to the Gray Wolf King. The reason the fiery aura could condense into matter was because the Fire Bird King primarily cultivated the Fire profound—a natural profound. Natural profounds were the easiest to gain spirituality in. This aura had been settling here for tens of thousands of years. Thus, forming matter was nothing strange for it.</p><p>…</p><p>In Fire Bird King graveyard’s hall, Ghost Wood King and Gopher King were searching for treasures with their soul powers. Gopher King was even using his special skill. His soul power had condensed into rats which could enter any hole and any corner. This was Gopher King’s detective talent.</p><p>Zhi!</p><p>One soul rat discovered something and called out.</p><p>“A treasure!” Gopher King hurriedly went in that direction. “F*ck! Just a half step supreme grade fire crystal!”</p><p>A half step supreme grade fire crystal was a rare treasure for Sea of Soul realm experts cultivating fire type Zhen Yan and profound arts. However, to Gopher King who cultivated fiend arts, it was nothing special. It was not something he would give a second glance. What could truly make him give a second glance was Fire Bird King King’s fiend arts.</p><p>Ghost Wood King said, “No need to worry! This is just the second graveyard. There is still White Sheep King, Sky Scorpion King…and most importantly, Four Extreme Emperor.”</p><p>Gopher King glanced at him and said, “White Sheep King and Sky Scorpion King are fine, but can we really hold any hope for the Four Extreme Emperor? It’s the place for Life and Death Kings to contend. If we go there, we’ll simply court death. Unfortunately, we never ran into that group again. If we can snatch that upper grade tree, it’ll also count as a huge gain.”</p><p>Ghost Wood King said, “You worry too much. As I see it, they are already dead people. The only question is if they’re already dead or will die soon.”</p><p>“I’ll only feel assured after having the tree in hand. Why don’t we first search for them? I’m sure that they wouldn’t have been able to gather together yet.”</p><p>“That’s fine too.” Ghost Wood King faintly nodded.</p><p>Just as the two were about to head out, a figure silently appeared at the entrance of the hall.</p><p>“Are you looking for me?” Ye Chen calmly entered the hall.</p><p>“Kid, it’s you!” Gopher King was overjoyed.</p><p>A sluggish and wooden but frightening glint flickered in Ghost Wood King’s eyes. If not for Yan Fengfeng and Murong Qingcheng assisting from side, he was sure that he could have hounded Ye Chen to death.</p><p>“You are looking for me, and I’m also looking for you.” Ye Chen’s strength had increased by several folds. He was looking for test subjects, and these two were undoubtedly the best choice.</p><p>“Looking for us? For what?” Gopher King slowly walked to Ye Chen’s left. Along with Ghost Wood King at his right, the two had surrounded him.</p><p>Ye Chen, “To kill you.”</p><p>“Kill us, haha!”</p><p>“So that’s what happened! No wonder you’re so confident…you’ve broken through into late Sea of Soul realm. I guess your profounds have improved. But, it’s still not enough.” Ghost Wood King could tell at a glance that Ye Chen’s cultivation base had reached late Sea of Soul realm. If nothing unexpected happened, his profound would have improved a little in every aspect. However, regardless of the improvement, Ghost Wood King didn’t care. The reason Ye Chen could resist outside the graveyard was not that he was powerful, but only due to his Immortal Body.</p><p>How could he have known that the improvement in Ye Chens’ profound was not a little bit, but incredibly huge. If he knew that, he wouldn’t have such thoughts.</p><p>“First to die will be you.”</p><p>Ye Chen shot toward Gopher King as the latter was relatively faster. If he didn’t kill him first, he might escape. As for Ghost Wood King, he was a block of wood waiting to be chopped.</p><p>“Kid, you’re courting death!”</p><p>An ominous glint flickered in the green-pea-like-eyes of Gopher King. His figure flickered several times, turning into hundreds of phantoms, all attacking Ye Chen and wishing to kill him in one strike.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>Ye Chen completely disregarded the numerous figures and unsheathed the Thunder Disaster Sword, sweeping it across. The sword’s speed was too fast for Gopher King and Ghost Wood King to sense.</p><p>It was none other than exceptionally fast Spiritual Sword.</p><p>Ah!</p><p>Gopher King miserably screamed as one of his arms flew off. He absolutely didn’t expect that Ye Chen would be able to figure out his true body at a glance. Although he was wearing an inner armor, it was not protecting his arms, which was thus, chopped off instantly.</p><p>Ye Chen thrust out Thunder Calamity Sword with an elegant move, piercing through Gopher King’s head. In that instant, the Destruction Sword Intent extinguished the latter’s soul.</p><p>Two swords!</p><p>Gopher King fell!</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Ghost Wood King was appalled. Perhaps Gopher King’s strength was inferior to him, but the latter’s speed was superior. Ye Chen had struck his true body at a glance and then killed him in the second strike. Such insight and strength had exceeded his imagination. Compared to before, Ye Chen was several folds stronger. This could only be described as monstrous!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
