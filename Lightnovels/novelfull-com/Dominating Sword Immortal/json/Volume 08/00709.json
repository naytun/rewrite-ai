As he blinked, the gleam in his eyes turned into strings, then into two silver light beams. Wind blew by, causing his black hair to hoist and flutter like dense black clouds.</p><p>“Haha, interesting!”</p><p>Ye Chen was not only the first powerful opponent Liu Wujian encountered, but he was also the first one to look down on him. It made him so furious that he laughed.</p><p>“Since you’ve such confidence, I’ll just have to smash your confidence. I, Liu Wujian, have never lost once in ten years through the West Ocean. Today will be no different…The loser will be you.”</p><p>Returning his longsword to its sheath, Liu Wujian’s body slightly leaned forward with his right hand placed on the hilt, accumulating sword aura and not allowing the slightest bit to leak.</p><p>“Is that so? You’ll be disappointed.”</p><p>With the Thunder Disaster Sword pointed diagonally downwards and the sword’s tip sprouting sparks of black sword light, Ye Chen stood still, indifferently looking at Liu Wujian.</p><p>“Water Cleaving Whale!”</p><p>When the sword aura had accumulated to the limit where continuing anymore would make it explode, Liu Wujian finally attacked.</p><p>Clank!</p><p>A resplendent bluish white colored sword light glittered in the horizon like an ocean stretching as far as the eye could see. A ginormous monstrosity rose from within the water: it was a huge whale, not condensed from Zhen Yan but sword light, the same as Dugu Jue’s Despairing Fox. However, compared to the Despairing Fox, this huge whale looked even more tyrannous and frightening.</p><p>Emitting a cold killing intent, the huge whale opened its mouth toward Ye Chen, and the faces of spectators on Ye Chen’s side turned pale. The inside of the whale’s mouth was a completely black, seeming like a continuously expanding black hole swallowing huge chunks of heaven and earth before it. They subconsciously retreated several steps in the face of this pressure.</p><p>“You’ll be swallowed…let yourself be swallowed!”</p><p>Ye Chen held the Thunder Disaster Sword high in the air with both hands as strands of black lightning converged on the sword’s tip. In the next moment, a thunder sphere suddenly appeared, spinning violently. In almost a blink, the thunder sphere expanded by several times and condensed to its limit.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>The Thunder Disaster Sword vigorously chopped down, and the thunder sphere suddenly shot into the whale’s mouth, entering its body.</p><p>Gugugu!</p><p>Muffled sounds rang out and the whale’s momentum slowed down. Its body unnaturally swelled like an air balloon, and continued to swell with each passing second.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>When its body had swelled to its limits, it finally exploded into pieces. A shockwave of interweaving black and white spread out in the shape of a ring. A back-white colored mushroom Qi cloud soared into the sky, tearing a huge hole into the Stunning Sky itself. Ye Chen felt as if he stood before an exploding nuclear bomb. His body blew away following the shockwave, seeming as light as paper.</p><p>On the other side, Liu Wujian fared no better. He didn’t expect Ye Chen’s Thunder Devour to have so many transformations. Previously, it was a thunder sphere with enhanced cohesiveness, but this time, it contained a huge amount of Zhen Yuan, increasing its destructive power. From the extent and destructive power of the thunder sphere, the thunder profound contained in this move seemed above that of minor completion; it was at least at forty percent completion.</p><p>The might of thunder sphere was immense by itself. Being sealed inside the whale on top, the might could be well imagined. Due to these factors, the shockwave generated contained an unprecedented intensity. It had already been condensed into a ring, all the energy packed in one ring instead of multiple shockwaves.</p><p>Creak…</p><p>As his Protective Zhen Yuan let out harsh grinding noises, his body turned numb, and he found himself flying backward with scenery around him rapidly changing and turning fuzzy.</p><p>“Retreat again!”</p><p>The shockwave was too powerful, causing the majority of people to retreat several li more. Ye Chen and Liu Wujian’s figures had already turned into dots in their eyes. Fortunately, by infusing their eyes with Zhen Yuan, they were still able to see clearly.</p><p>“What a powerful shockwave!”</p><p>The region under the summit turned into flying dust, so Bai Wuxue and the rest leaped up. Standing in the void, their Protective Zhen Yuan flickered indefinitely.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Gu Lie stood before the multicolor-robed woman. His Protective Zhen Yuan created a huge blade which cleaved the incoming shockwave into two, not allowing it to approach the latter.</p><p>“This…Even the Water Cleaving Whale was destroyed?” The multicolor-robed woman felt her brain turning somewhat sluggish.</p><p>Gu Lie said gravely, “This is still not the decisive moment.”</p><p>“Right, Elder brother Liu’s strongest card still hasn’t been revealed yet.” The multicolor-robed woman renewed her faith in Liu Wujian and unblinkingly watched the center of the explosion.</p><p>After flying for seven-eight li, Ye Chen neutralized the momentum as he squinted to save his eyes from the glaring light.</p><p>“He probably still has his ace. As expected of the West Ocean Sword Master.”</p><p>Apart from using the Golden Hurricane and Defensive Sword Art, he had been fighting at full force. Liu Wujian was indeed the strongest sword artist he’d ever faced. He couldn’t afford the slightest bit carelessness.</p><p>“My Water Cleaving Whale was actually broken!”</p><p>Liu Wujian’s calm expression turned deep and grave like water. He could now feel that Ye Chen would not be so easy to beat. If he didn’t give it his all, he wouldn’t be able to harm even a single strand of hair of the latter. It could even be said that Ye Chen was the biggest rock in his path ever since he’d been born. If he stumbled on this rock, he would fall headfirst and bleed heavily. But, if he crossed this rock, he would be able to continue unfettered.</p><p>“I will not lose.”</p><p>Liu Wujian never thought he would lose, and today was the same,</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Highsky Sword Intent soared violently, and an aura of absolute strength appeared on his body. His Zhen Yuan increased unceasingly, giving off a feeling of crossing one’s limit by employing a secret art. Since the sword intent was too strong, and that Highsky Sword Intent itself was considered a relatively strong intent, the aura outside his body condensed into illusory sword phantoms. This was not something created by him, but generated spontaneously.</p><p>In a blink of an eye, his whole figure was covered with sword phantoms, seeming like a porcupine with sword phantoms as spikes. Such a powerful strong sword aura scared a lot of spectators silly.</p><p>“Liu Wujian is going crazy! What a frightening sword aura!”</p><p>“This Liu Wujain’s strength seems limitless. I wonder if Ye Chen can hold on.”</p><p>“Look, Ye Chen is also raising his sword intent.”</p><p>The spectators were first attracted by Liu Wujian, but then again turned back to Ye Chen.</p><p>Ye Chen’s Destruction Sword Intent didn’t fall behind Liu Wujian’s Highsky sword intent at all. Once employed at full force, it directly shook the heaven and earth. The sky turned black, and high above, black lightning streaked across the horizon. A huge black sword phantom condensed on Ye Chen’s body; the sword phantom faintly leaked its sharp gleam which split open a huge hole in the Stunning Sky,</p><p>“Blood Ocean Pagoda!”</p><p>On the other side, Liu Wujian had already finished accumulating sword aura, causing the space around him to distort. He stepped out and slashed, emptying all the power he’d accumulated while issuing the strongest move yet. As the sword was waved, a blood ocean spread out, bringing along foul winds and bloody rain. Countless blood-colored sword phantoms filled the sky, transforming the sky above the Nine Dragon Mountain into a bloody purgatory that closed in on Ye Chen from all directions.</p><p>As he’d been raising his sword intent, he’d been calmly paying attention to Liu Wujian as well. He could see that the latter had not only comprehended wind profound and water profound, but also the exceedingly strange blood profound. And this move, Blood Ocean Pagoda, was precisely an integration of water profound and blood profound. Water and blood both had similar aspects, and their combination caused both profounds to be greatly elevated.</p><p>“Golden Hurricane!”</p><p>The integration of water profound and blood profound was strong, but Ye Chen’s integration of metal profound and water profound was not weak either. Metal birthed water, and thus, were also related, exponentially increasing the might as well.</p><p>The Thunder Disaster Sword emitted a dark-golden luster as Ye Chen slashed out a strike carrying the frightening Destruction Sword Intent.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>A dark golden ripple-like light beam radiated, inside which, ripples propagated, each terminating at the beam’s edge and increasing the might by several folds. It battered the blood-colored world, piercing through.</p><p>Crackle!</p><p>The Blood-colored sword phantoms and light beam collided, causing a deep sword scar to be plowed out on the blood ocean. Destructive Sword Intent pervaded on the sword scar, unceasingly wrecking the composition of the blood ocean, creating gargantuan waves in it. Soon, the blood color gradually diluted.</p><p>Liu Wujian again waved his sword with an ice-cold and expressionless face. With that, the blood colored ocean once again shrouded the heaven and earth. Densely packed sword phantoms once again shot out, blotting the sky.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Ye Chen didn’t waste any words either as the Thunder Disaster Sword danced, emitting one light beam after another, battering the multi-layered blood-colored world.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The fight between the two caused to sun and moon to lose their radiance. Sand flew and rocks moved; fierce blood colored sword gales interweaved with black-colored sword gales, revolving with the two as center. Their collision took the shape of storm and tornados across several li, covering the heaven and earth.</p><p>At the center of the storm, the two individuals collided repeatedly, as if they would keep going until one person fell.</p><p>Gulp!</p><p>Every now and then, someone among the spectators would gulp to relax their taut nerves.</p><p>As they saw the blood and black colored radiance amidst the storm, as well as the lightning created due to friction between energies,, someone finally could no longer keep quiet, “F*ck! This is ridiculous! I’m a Sea of Soul realm Master as well, but this gap is too big! How is this a showdown between two individuals? This seems more like a war between two armies.”</p><p>“A battle of Sword Master level is really something out of our league!”</p><p>“I wonder who amongst the two of them will have the last laugh.”</p><p>As the two continued to exchange blows, Ye Chen had already employed Dragon Bone Guard and the semi extreme grade armor. Distorted blue colored runes stuck on his Protective Zhen Yuan, amplifying his defenses.</p><p>However, despite all of this, he was still not faring well. His blood and Qi were boiling like water.</p><p>Across him, Liu Wujian also had a semi extreme grade armor—a bluish white plank shaped armor. It was different compared to Ye Chen’s. It emitted cloud-shaped runes which were stuck on the Protective Zhen Yuan like simple outlines of white clouds.</p><p>In addition, he was also wearing a necklace emitting a deep blue radiance, which served as the second layer of defense on top of the Protective Zhen Yuan.</p><p>Peng Peng Peng!</p><p>Energy streams continuously battered the blue radiance and created distorted ripples, causing Liu Wujian to shiver every once in a while.</p><p>“My Secluded Ocean Necklace is a semi extreme grade artifact. With its second layer of defense, I can keep going. Let me see how long you can keep on going.”</p><p>At this point, the struggle was no longer about strength, but endurance. Whoever failed to endure first would be the one to lose. There was no second possibility.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
