I did not see anything, since this is indeed an entrance for some ancient ruins.” Murong Qingcheng shook her head, as she indeed could not spot anything different. But on hearing Ye Chen, she started thinking; although she was not as sensitive as him, she was surely not stupid.</p><p>“Once there is something wrong, let’s leave immediately.” Ye Chen said with seriousness on his face.</p><p>“Yeah!” Murong Qingcheng nodded and walked right next to him carefully.</p><p>“Everyone, follow behind me! Keep the formation!” At the front, the leading man’s voice was heard.</p><p>“Aren’t we looking for the ancient ruins? And since we have found it now, then why don’t we go back?” Someone mumbled.</p><p>The top master level warrior standing right next to the man with gray hair said, “If you are not happy about it, then you can go back. I will not stop you.”</p><p>“I am just saying.” The speaker stopped talking immediately.</p><p>The ancient ruins were massive. There was a stone room lobby first before leading toward a straight tunnel with oil lamps on both sides, as if it was showing the path for everyone. After fifteen minutes, everyone finally made it through and arrived at a flat ground.</p><p>A massive stone door stood in front of them, and in the middle of the flat ground was a hexagram. There were more complicated symbols within, which were not for decoration for sure. That strings of energy had caused countless light beams to flash past.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>All of a sudden, a heavy seal door fell down from above, locking everyone inside.</p><p>“What is happening?”</p><p>“Wait, what happened?”</p><p>“Damn, we have been trapped inside!”</p><p>It was all happening too fast, so some of the people were still in shock. But, more people were panicking with every passing second. It was one hundred and eighty thousand meters down under the sea, so no one would want to trap themselves here.</p><p>“Alright, it is just a gate. What is there to be frightened about? I will break it in no time.”</p><p>A Sea of soul realm master level warrior walked out as he waved out his right hand and tightened it into a fist. All of a sudden, a red flame wrapped around his fists before being thrown onto the gate.</p><p>Pap!</p><p>The gate did not move at all. Not even a single stone chip had been brought up.</p><p>“What!”</p><p>This master level warrior could not believe what had just happened, so he started to attack the gate madly. Those burning red fist shadows hit at one spot.</p><p>“Everyone, let’s attack it together!” Seeing that the gate was not being opened, someone asked everyone to join in.</p><p>“One, two, three…attack!”</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Hundreds of attacks hit on the gate, which finally made it move a little. But, it was still far from actually breaking it.</p><p>“Get away!”</p><p>The evil looking man moved the people away and walked out.</p><p>“You alone? Can you really do it?”</p><p>Some people were confused by what he was about to do.</p><p>“Let him do it. Although there are a lot of attacks from us, some of the special martial arts had been canceled out by other Zhen yuans, so the battling power actually decreased.”</p><p>“I see! I guess I had forgotten that point.”</p><p>Wanting to understand the key, everyone’s eyesight landed on the evil looking man. Among them were three half step king warriors, and the evil looking man was indeed one of them. Although they still did not know what kind of power he had, it would not be too bad after all, since a half step king warrior was a half step king warrior after all.</p><p>Standing in front of the gate, he focused and took in a deep breath. As he took in the first breath, all of the space around him started to twist slightly. Piles of black qi poured out and its power started increasing all the way to a horrifying level.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The evil looking man roared as he threw out a palm attack at the gate.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The gate vibratid at a higher frequency than usual. Some of the dust had been shaken out from the corner, blocking people’s vision.</p><p>“This solid?” The man’s expression changed.</p><p>“Let’s join forces.”</p><p>Dongfang Hao could not stand back anymore and moved right next to the man.</p><p>“If we can break it through, then we would not be lured here after all.” Ye Chen shook his head as he looked over at the man with gray hair and the two men standing right next to him.</p><p>The leading man seemed to be very sensitive about other people’s stare as he turned his head to search for the source. However, Ye Chen had looked away a long time ago.</p><p>“Wavy Cut!”</p><p>“Ground Cracking Attack!”</p><p>They both performed one of their top martial attacks at the same time.</p><p>Dong! Dong!</p><p>The gate vibrated intensively, and tiny cracks appeared.</p><p>“It is about to shatter!”</p><p>Seeing that, everyone was super happy.</p><p>“Again!” Dongfang Hao said to the other man.</p><p>“Alright!” The evil looking man was in a good mood. He thought that as long as he could crack open the gate, he could finally get out of here.</p><p>“Huh!”</p><p>The man with gray hair sneered secretly, as if he did not believe that the group had the power to break through the door.</p><p>“How is this possible?”</p><p>In everyone’s shocked vision, the man and Dongfang Hao’s combined attacks did not even shake the gate at all. A layer of dark colored light bounced back all of their attacks which landed back on them.</p><p>Pooh!</p><p>Pooh!</p><p>Without enough time to react, Dongfang Hao and the evil looking man both puked out a mouthful of blood and were blown backward, their feet rubbing on the ground for a long time before stopping finally.</p><p>“How can this be broken?” Dongfang Hao had a bad look on his face.</p><p>Letting out a breath, Ye Chen said, “Sirs, do not waste your energy for nothing. Since we have been lured here, then there is no way we can make it out of here.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Dongfang Hao’s eyes were sharp.</p><p>Ye Chen said, “Do you really think that these are the ancient traps that trapped all of us here? And it is nothing man-made?”</p><p>“So, you are saying that someone brought us here?” The evil looking man realized what he was saying.</p><p>“I guess we will have to ask him.” Ye Chen pointed at the man with gray hair.</p><p>“Rude!”</p><p>“Are you asking for death?”</p><p>The two men standing right next to the man with gray hair yelled.</p><p>Ye Chen sneered, “Since you have already brought us here, you have succeeded. So, why don’t you stop trying to lie to us more and show us your true face?”</p><p>“Haha!”</p><p>The man with gray hair laughed, that laugh containing an arrogance and admiration.</p><p>“I did not expect that you would think that deeply. You have even seen through that. When did you realize it?” The man with gray hair asked.</p><p>“I had some suspicion when I first entered. But once we entered the ruins, I started to question you fully.”</p><p>“Oh? Then why don’t you run?”</p><p>“Everyone has his curiosity. Plus, it would have been too late anyway, and it would be impossible that you guys did not have a backup plan.”</p><p>“You have guessed it very right. The second you all entered the ruins, there was no way out. Bringing you here was the second move.”</p><p>“I will have to say that amongst all of you, only you have noticed it while the others thought nothing else. Even if they might have their suspicions, they would definitely have not thought of me. Therefore, although you might not be the most powerful, your survival skills are greater than anyone else here.”</p><p>The man with gray hair was very impressed by Ye Chen. But of course, he did not know the latter’s true power yet, and thought that he was just very observant.</p><p>“No need to admire me. Actually, I admire you, Black Water Alliance. This big of a plan is obviously trying to capture everyone in one go. And if I have not guessed it wrong, your plan should have a lot to do with the devouring island, right?” Ye Chen said with a smile.</p><p>Gasp!</p><p>Not only the man with gray hair, even the two warriors standing right next to him gasped as well. With tiny bits of clues, Ye Chen had seen through their plans. It was a horrifying feeling on their end.</p><p>“Is he telling the truth?” The evil looking man had a killing intent written on his face.</p><p>“How hilarious. You dare to ask me now.” The man with gray hair sneered.</p><p>“You are looking for death! I will tear you apart!”</p><p>The evil looking man was not some nice guy next door. He was always the one bullying other people, so he could not stand it the fact that he was being played right now, and it frustrated him a lot.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Forming his palm into a blade, he formed a light dark saw from the edge of his palm and attacked the man and those two warriors standing right next to him.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>However, that attack was blocked out by a layer of blue light. The ground underneath the three automatically moved, carrying them into the walls. In the crack was a thin light blue layer which looked like it would not be torn apart even if a dozen Half step king warriors attacked together. The man with gray hair and the other two warriors could see Ye Chen and the other clearly through the light blue layer. And of course, the others could see them as well.</p><p>“You really think that I will give you a chance to attack me?” The man with gray hair had a sneer on his face.</p><p>“F**k your ancestor!”</p><p>The evil-looking man kept attacking on the blue layer, creating water ripple patterns. Unfortunately, the blue layer’s defense was way more powerful than expected. No matter how much power the man threw out, it did not seem to move by even an inch.</p><p>“Everyone, attack together!”</p><p>After knowing that the man with gray hair and the black water alliance were behind everything, everyone was furious, wishing to swallow the three alive.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The water like qi flow drowned the blue layer like an ocean. Dongfang Hao and Meng Xiaoling joined the attack as well. Only Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng stood aside and watched.</p><p>After a long while, the qi flow disappeared. But, the blue layer was not scratched at all.</p><p>“There is no use. Once entered, just accept your fate.” Ye Chen said calmly.</p><p>“Since you already knew this before, why didn’t you tell us before? I will teach you how to be a good man. As for your girlfriend, I will take care of her for you too.”</p><p>The evil looking man was named Tu Laosan, who was very frustrated all this time and needed an outlet. His attention shifted back onto Ye Chen. He wanted to kill him in return for joy before any disaster arrived.</p><p>As he spoke, Tu Laosan had an evil looking smile on his face, as if Murong Qingcheng was already inside his bag.</p><p>“You are looking for death!”</p><p>Dongfang Hao had a killing intent flashing though his eyes as well before he hid it very well. He was very happy about the fact that Tu Laosan planned to kill Ye Chen. He planned to save Murong Qingcheng from him once Ye Chen was killed. What a win-win situation, he thought!</p><p>“It looks like you are ready to die.”</p><p>Ye Chen’s eyes cooled down, the killing intent in them a couple times higher than Tu Laosan’s. People that were standing around him hurried to back out.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
