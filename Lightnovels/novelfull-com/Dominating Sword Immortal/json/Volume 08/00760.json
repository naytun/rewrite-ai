Why is it even a couple of times more intense than half step king warriors?”</p><p>“Yeah! Indeed different!”</p><p>“What is rich killing vibe going to do? It is all about power after all. I do not think he will win…I bet he will be killed within one or two attacks. Too bad for that beautiful lady of his though!”</p><p>Although everyone was surprised at Ye Chen’s killing intent, they did not think that he could survive Tu Laosan’s attack, since the power gap was too huge.</p><p>“I want to die?” Tu Laosan laughed, “Alright! I will not kill you directly later, but make you wish you could die.”</p><p>“Are you done? Now you can die slowly…very slowly.” Ye Chen suddenly took out his Thunder Disaster sword and threw out a sword attack.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>Blood spilled in the air as Tu Laosan’s right arm was cut down in full. Because it all happened too suddenly, the blood spilled out seven meters away like a fountain.</p><p>“What!”</p><p>Everyone was shocked at what they had just witnessed. This result was nothing like the one that they had in mind. Tu Laosan was a half step king warrior after all, but he still lost an arm to Ye Chen instantly.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>Tu Laosan yelled furiously. His face went pale, yet no one knew if he was in pain or more in shock.</p><p>“Nothing is impossible.”</p><p>Ye Chen threw out another sword attack; it was so fast that even Tu Laosan did not have the time to react. Just like that, his left arm fell down as well.</p><p>“Let me live! I promise to never mess with you again.”</p><p>By now, Tu Laosan was truly scared. Although everyone now had been stuck in the black water alliance’s trap, but at least there was a chance of them all live after all.</p><p>“You are too stupid.”</p><p>Ye Chen did not feel sorry for him at all as he left up his Thunder Disaster sword in the air.</p><p>“I’ll f**k your whole family! Everyone, let’s kill him together!”</p><p>Tu Laosan had a desperate look in his eyes. He screamed hysterically, yet unfortunately no one listened to him. Fighting against Ye Chen now would just be suicidal.</p><p>Tu Laosan, who was without both arms at this point, had no fighting chance. He was devoured by the black thunder ball immediately, which then got twisted and expanded, making an intense explosive sound. In the center, Tu Laosan had electricity leaking out from different holes. His skin turned burnt black at a visible speed before cracking open.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Tu Laosan fell onto the ground in pieces like pieces of burnt coal. If it were not for the fact that everyone had witnessed it, no one would think that this was a human’s corpse.</p><p>Dongfang Hao looked at Tu Laosan on the ground and then at Ye Chen, having a very bad look on his face. All this time, he had thought of Ye Chen as a normal peak level Late Sea of Souls Realm warrior. Even if he could cross realm battle, it would be at normal half step king warrior level, which was still quite far away from him. But, what he did not expect was that although Ye Chen did not have a very high cultivation base, his battling power was couple of times higher than he had expected. Even Tu Laosan, who was so powerful, could not last even three attacks.</p><p>“He is this powerful!” Meng Xiaoling mumbled unconsciously.</p><p>Inside the blue thin layer on the wall, the man with gray hair said, “I had not guessed it at all that you are the most powerful one out of the group after all.”</p><p>“So what that I am powerful? I still got trapped here, didn’t I?” Ye Chen put his sword back in its scabbard as he said calmly.</p><p>“Hehe…” The men chuckled, “You don’t look like you’re nervous at all.”</p><p>“If getting nervous is going to help our situation here, then I would not mind getting nervous a bit.” As he spoke, he scanned the area before focusing on that hexagonal pattern which had flashed once before. No one seemed to have noticed it.</p><p>The man with gray hair noticed Ye Chen’s sight and said, “There is no use for that. After another short while, you guys will be devoured by the island. This is the only the entrance to the island.”</p><p>“Indeed!”</p><p>As the man with gray hair spoke, everyone suddenly made the connection between the Black Water alliance and the devouring island. As for what exactly it did, no one knew, and they did not want to know either. This time, a lot of people had started to give up on hope. They wished they could go back in time so they would not come to the crystal island at all.</p><p>Woo!</p><p>At that moment, a powerful energy vibration spread out of the pattern, more powerful than dozens of half step king warriors added up together. As the hexagon was being activated completely, the stone door in front of everyone opened. An energy swirl appeared behind it, which was spinning at a high speed, sucking everything within the stone room in.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Without the time to react, at least half a dozen people were sucked into that black hole like existence. No one knew what would be on the other side of that black hole.</p><p>That sucking power was so powerful that even when Ye Chen and the others tried their best, they only managed to buy themselves a bit more time, and were all eventually sucked in.</p><p>Waiting until the energy swirl disappeared completely, the stone door closed, and that blue layer disappeared automatically. After that, the man with gray hair and his two warriors walked out.</p><p>“Another batch of them…How easy!” The left top master level warrior chuckled.</p><p>“You think it is easy, but the Black Water alliance does not think so. The life and death king warriors’ appetite is getting bigger and bigger. If we do not give them enough Zhen yuan crystals, these things will be exposed in no time. By then, our alliance would have a hard time continuing.” The lead man said.</p><p>“No matter how much more they want, there is a boundary after all, right? There are a lot of our own life and death realm warriors as well after all.” Another top master level warrior said.</p><p>“What do you know? The king warriors’ world will not be that easy to understand.”</p><p>“That is true.”</p><p>“Let’s go! Go back and hand in the mission.”</p><p>…</p><p>This was an odd looking world. Looking around, there was nothing but the bright, colorful sky and pitch black ocean water. There were six small islands that connected in a circle, and nothing else.</p><p>“Where is this?”In the sky, Ye Chen and the rest of them had a confused look on their faces.</p><p>“It does not matter where we are, as long as we are not dead.”</p><p>A lot of people had a joyous look on their faces, since they thought that they were about to die for sure.</p><p>“Don’t get too happy yet.”</p><p>Ye Chen did not think the Black Water alliance would be this nice. He had an instinct that not dying might be worse than death. As least if they died, then nothing else could ever happen anymore.</p><p>As everyone was preparing to go on an island, a wave of vibration came out from the sky in front of them. A transparent human figure formed, who had a pair of see-through wings as well.</p><p>“Hello! This is the devouring island. You guys can call me holy spirit.” The person said to everyone.</p><p>“Holy spirit? What does it mean?”</p><p>“You do not need to know that. Now, I will tell you guys about the rules of the devouring island. There is only one rule of this island, which is to submit Zhen yuan crystals. For astral reaching realm, ten Zhen yuan crystals is the minimal quota for each month. For sea of souls realm, each month would take fifty Zhen yuan crystals. Half step king warriors, you guys have to hand in one hundred of them.”</p><p>“Um, where do we get these Zhen yuan crystals then?” Someone asked.</p><p>The “person” said without any emotions, “Inside the devouring island, you can make your own. Right now, you can give it a shot.”</p><p>Most of them did not believe it, since normally only a very rare amount of half step king warriors could do it. But out of curiosity, everyone started their experiment.</p><p>“It is true!” Soon, someone yelled out.</p><p>In such a short period of time, everyone found out that as long as they thought about expressing their Zhen yuan, it would form into crystals. The random element within would be removed as well, which made it extremely pure. But of course, given the short period of them, the Zhen yuan crystal would be super unstable. Without constant control, it would disappear completely.</p><p>“We can really create Zhen yuan crystals here! Perhaps, all of the Zhen yuan crystals the Black Water alliance were selling came from here?”</p><p>“B*stards! Those people had lied to us to get us here. They wanted free labor for sure. Is there such a good thing happening in the world?”</p><p>They thought the holy spirit was not that horrifyingly powerful, so one Sea of souls realm master level warrior said, “Why should we give you our Zhen yuan crystals?”</p><p>“Because this is the rule of the devouring island.” The holy spirit answered.</p><p>“Screw the rules! Let me ask you, how can we get out?”</p><p>“That will be very simple. Ten thousand Zhen yuan crystals for Astral Reaching Realm warriors, fifty thousand for Sea of souls realm warriors, and one hundred thousand for half step king warriors. Then, you guys can leave.”</p><p>“What? Then let me ask you, for astral reaching realm warrior, how many Zhen yuan crystals can one make in a month?”</p><p>“Fifteen.”</p><p>“Are you kidding us? For those ten thousand pieces, it would take sixty to seventy years.”</p><p>“This is the rule here.”</p><p>“B*stard rules! I asked you, how are we getting out?” A lot of people revealed an evil look.</p><p>“Hand over enough Zhen yuan crystals and then you can get out.” The holy spirit’s tone did not change at all.</p><p>“Die now!”</p><p>Three warriors attacked together.</p><p>Pooh! Pooh! Pooh!</p><p>The holy spirit flapped its wings, and the three of them puked out blood as they were blown backward.</p><p>“Inside the devouring island, even life and death realm warriors would not be my rightful opponents. I suggest you not to waste your energy. In addition, you all have to remember that if you slack off and do not deliver the minimal amount of Zhen yuan crystal by the end of the mouth, then you will be punished. Besides that, no killings are allowed here. The people’s quota would be in your hand after being killed. In other words, you might be able to leave after handing over ten thousand Zhen yuan crystal, but after killing a person with the same cultivation base, you would need to hand over twenty thousand before leaving.”</p><p>Hearing the holy spirit, Ye Chen frowned, “Something is wrong.”</p><p>“What?” Murong Qingcheng asked.</p><p>Ye Chen said, “If we could actually leave after handing out the Zhen yuan crystals, then the things about the devouring island would have been exposed by now. But from the outside and what we knew, it was still just a myth.”</p><p>“So you mean, as long as we get in here, there would be no way out.”</p><p>“Very likely.”</p><p>“That holy spirit is lying to us.”</p><p>“I do not know about that. Let’s go by ear.”</p><p>The devouring island was too strange, and Ye Chen still had no clue what was happening at the moment. Only by observing for a while could he figure everything out.</p><p>After knowing that the holy spirit was unbeatable, everyone looked low spirited. According to the holy spirit, the island would be like a prison, one that one would have to work in. If one did not work, then there would receive punishment. Plus, all those Zhen yuan crystals would take just forever to make.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
