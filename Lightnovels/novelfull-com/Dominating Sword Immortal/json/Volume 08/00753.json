His face was in high spirits as if he still had many years left to live, and his vitality seemed even higher than the young Life and Death Kings.</p><p>“Senior Dragon King!” Ye Chen and the rest cupped their fists.</p><p>Dragon King waved and smiled at him, “Ye Chen, your senior Space Emperor is joking with you. Don’t take it to heart.”</p><p>“Joking? That might not be true?”</p><p>Space Emperor had naturally not been joking with Ye Che. However, he was quite apprehensive of the Dragon King. Having lived for a thousand years, nobody knew what kind of means he had at his disposal. Although he was confident of prevailing over Dragon King, he also believed that he would have to pay a disastrous price.</p><p>Most importantly, he had no assurance of taking Dragon King and Mysterious Queen at the same time on his own.</p><p>“Space Emperor, I’m quite regretful for Wind Storm King’s death, but the winner is king and the loser bandit. It’s that simple! We’re also here to do the same, aren’t we?” Mysterious Queen scattered the Mysterious Ten Thousand Layer Gate and walked out of the void.</p><p>“Winner is king, and loser bandit…good! Today, for the face of Old Dragon King and Mysterious Queen, I’ll not lower myself to argue with you. But, that might not be so in the future.” Space Emperor retracted his aggressive bearing and spoke indifferently.</p><p>Four Extreme Emperor’s grave had already opened, and there were only a few things that could catch his eyes. If he fought against both Dragon King and Mysterious Queen for the sake of an extreme grade sword, it would instead benefit the Void Emperor. He had no confidence of remaining uninjured under the combined assault of Dragon King and Mysterious Queen.</p><p>Hearing his words, Dragon King smiled and said, “Ye Chen, you haven’t thanked your senior Space Emperor yet?”</p><p>“Many thanks to senior Space Emperor!”</p><p>Ye Chen also knew when to take a step back. Before absolute strength, one had to lower their head when required. This had nothing to do with submitting.</p><p>“No need to thank me. That’s just for today.” Space Emperor waved his hand, no longer sparing a glance for Ye Chen.</p><p>As they were conversing, more and more Kings arrived, including peak Kings like Evil King and Prison King, some lone Kings, and some secretive Kings that were normally hidden from the world.</p><p>“Ye Chen, after going back, bid farewell to your family and leave the continent!” Mysterious Queen flicked her sleeve, creating a formless barrier to prevent others from hearing their conversation.</p><p>“Qingxuan is right. True Spirit Continent has numerous Kings. Only humanity has more than a hundred, and adding the other species as well, it’s a complete mess. The news of you having the Sky Scorpio King is no longer a secret. The continent will be extremely dangerous for you. Qingxuan and Old Dragon King can’t always appear before you.” Qin Liu supported.</p><p>Ye Chen faintly nodded, “I had been mentally prepared for this and will leave the continent for a while.”</p><p>He had offended a lot of Kings. Although these Kings were extremely apprehensive of Mysterious Queen and Dragon King and wouldn’t dare to kill him in open, they could easily do so in secret. In this world, relying on others was not enough in the end. Relying on oneself was the true way of a king.</p><p>“I’ll be with you.” Murong Qingcheng held Ye Chen’s palm.</p><p>Having the woman he loved accompany him, there was nowhere he wouldn’t go.</p><p>“Ye Chen, you can be rest assured. Nobody will make a move against your family. No one will break this rule, and my Dragon God Celestial Palace will also safeguard their safety.” Dragon King continued, “As for Xu Jing, you need to worry even less. She is different from you people. When you meet her again, you’ll know her identity. At that time, you all will have to protect yourselves.”</p><p>“Remember, you better not return before becoming a Life and Death King. Not everyone hopes to see you become a King, and I don’t have much time to live either.”</p><p>“Senior Dragon King!” Concern appeared on Ye Chen’s face.</p><p>Dragon King waved his hand with a smile, “Having lived a thousand years, I no longer have any regrets. As long as I can watch you all mature, I’ll be more than happy. If you have the mind, Dragon God Celestial Palace might rely on you for survival.”</p><p>Ye Chen said resolutely, “Don’t worry senior! As long as Ye Chen breathes, Dragon King Celestial Palace will not disappear. Of course, senior can surely still continue living. You’ve already prevailed over death many times.”</p><p>Dragon King said, “Impossible! Some things can’t be repeated over and over. I’m the clearest about my situation.</p><p>At this moment, Mysterious Queen said, “This is a great era, but also a period of turmoil. Nobody can predict what the future holds. Ye Chen, Murong, Feng-er, you three are the talents I think highly of. Be sure to strive to strengthen yourself and grasp your own destiny.”</p><p>“Master, I certainly will!” Yan Fengfeng said with a determined expression.</p><p>“Ye Chen and Murong will too.” Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng exchanged a glance and nodded.</p><p>“Good! Now, the following matter is not something you can participate in. Remember, leave the continent as soon as possible, and be as far as possible.” Mysterious Queen didn’t wish to excessively scare them, but a feeling of oppression was necessary.</p><p>“Farewell, seniors!” Ye Chen was not an overly sensitive person. He simply bid his farewell and left.</p><p>Watching Ye Chen and the rest leave, Dragon King said, “Everyone has their own destiny. They can only look after themselves.”</p><p>“He is not one to live in a well.” Mysterious Queen had never been able to see through Ye Chen. His future achievements were something nobody could predict.</p><p>…</p><p>Leaving the graveyard, the five followed the previous route and soon left the forbidden zone, arriving in the outer world.</p><p>“Ye Chen, I’ve nothing to worry about and can leave the continent at any time. However, I’ll be going to the deep ocean outside Western Shallow Ocean. If you have the same path as me, we may meet at the ocean.”</p><p>Sun Tianlang didn’t have any supporters behind. If he didn’t leave, death would be his only choice. Therefore, he had to leave the continent.</p><p>“Brother Sun, I’m implicated you.” Ye Chen was quite apologetic.</p><p>Sun Tianlang replied unhappily, “What are you saying? If not for you, I would have died long since. Moreover, I even gained a lot of benefits. If you truly consider me a friend , even as an ordinary friend, don’t mention this matter again.”</p><p>“Alright, I won’t.” Ye Chen also felt that he was being too perfunctory.</p><p>“Then we’ll meet again someday. I hope I can also enter the Life and Death realm in my lifetime.” Sun Tianlang chuckled and flew off.</p><p>With one less person, the four headed into the same direction. Then, the four separated again near the Mysterious Sect.</p><p>“Ye Chen, I’m sure we’ll meet again.” Standing on a summit, Yan Fengfeng looked heroic and valiant, “Next time we meet, I hope all of us will be Kings.”</p><p>“Certainly!”</p><p>After going through so many hardships together, Ye Chen had long since begun to consider Yan Fengfeng as his best friend, the kind where one would stake his life for the other without needing a reason.</p><p>“Ye Chen, live well!” As a senior, Qin Liu commanded.</p><p>…</p><p>South Rudra Region was quite a distance from Sky Martial City. Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng mounted the flying puppet, heading at a speed of ten times that of sound. At the back of the flying puppet, Murong Qingcheng said, “Ye Chen, we don’t have much time. You don’t need to follow me to Murong Clan. I can go by myself.”</p><p>“Then be a bit careful.” Ye Chen felt that it was reasonable.</p><p>“En…Oh right! Where will go after leaving the continent?” Murong Qingcheng asked.</p><p>Ye Chen gazed at the south and said, “I have a few friends there. We’ll first go to Southern Shallow Ocean, then to the Boundless Ocean. Let’s meet up at South Rudra Region’s Sky South Nation by the ocean.”</p><p>Sky South Nation was small country of South Rudra Region situated by the Southern Shallow Ocean, not too far away from Sky Martial City.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Parting ways with Murong Qingcheng, Ye Chen immediately headed toward the Ye family.</p><p>Ye family…</p><p>“You’re leaving the continent?” Ye Tianhao was puzzled.</p><p>Ye Chen had no choice but to inform some matters to his father and mother. Although Shen Yuqing’s face was filled with reluctance, she still said, “Remember to be careful! When you need to concede, do it. Don’t make too many enemies.”</p><p>“I know, mother. You need not worry! I’ll be back in at most five years. For us martial artists, five years is a pretty short time.”</p><p>Astral Reaching experts could live for two hundred years. Moreover, with so many resources Ye Chen had left behind for his parents, attacking Sea of Soul realm was not hopeless. Once they became Sea of Soul realm experts, they would have a lifespan of three hundred years. Five years in a lifespan of three hundred years were not even worth mentioning.</p><p>Furthermore, with his younger brothers and sisters, he could leave the continent without any worries.</p><p>“Good, as long as you’re fine!”</p><p>Ye Tianhao and Shen Yuqing’s face had reluctance but also pride. Ye Chem had already become a legend on the True Spirit Continent. As his parents, they had been content long since.</p><p>Returning to the Sky Cloud Sect again, Ye Chen couldn’t help but sigh at the changes in the sect. Compared to the former Sky Cloud Sect, the current sect had expanded by more than ten times. One Astral Reaching expert from before had become dozens; especially for the core disciples, all of them had reached Astral Reaching realm. The renowned figures among them like Luo Hanshan, Zhu Mei, and others all had further attained the Sea of Soul realm. Current, Sky Cloud Sect had already become an influential sixth grade sect of South Rudra Region even without relying on Ye Chen.</p><p>Of course, all of this had been brought by Ye Chen. A genius needed both talent and resources. Only under sufficient resources could talent fully blossom. After all, not everybody could have a gargantuan destiny. Some geniuses progressed extremely slowly due to their bad luck and lack of resources.</p><p>Seeing Ye Chen, the disciples of the same generation as him were deeply moved. Although they didn’t have his achievements, they already stood at a height where they could assume a leading position in South Rudra Region. This was simply unimaginable before. How could they not understand that the reason for the sect’s abrupt rise had begun when Ye Chen obtained the first position in Hidden Dragon Rankings, creating a huge shift in Sky Cloud Sect’s fortune.</p><p>The master of the sect, Luo Hanshan, had married his former senior sister Zhu Mei. The two already had a boy and a girl.</p><p>Zhu Mei, who had matured quite a bit, smiled and said, “You will always be Sky Cloud Sect’s pride. I and Luo Hanshan often recall the times when we were disciples.”</p><p>Ye Chen was too outstanding. If Zhu Mei said that she used to secretly love him would be lie. In fact, most of the girls used to secretly love Ye Chen, but were quite clear in their hearts that they were in two different realms.</p><p>“Hehe!” Ye Chen smiled. He recalled those memories sometimes too.</p><p>“Ye Chen, take care!” Zhang Haoran, who had turned a steady man, patted his shoulders.</p><p>“Certainly!” Ye Chen swept his gaze through the ‘disciples’ of the same generation as him and smiled. Then, he turned and left the Windy Mountain.</p><p>…</p><p>Sky South Nation, on a summit overseeing the ocean…</p><p>Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng stood holding hands, gazing far into the ocean. The red sun was slowly rising, elongating their shadows, their clothes fluttering in the wind.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
