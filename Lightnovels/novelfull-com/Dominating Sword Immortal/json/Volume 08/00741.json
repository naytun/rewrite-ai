Before Ye Chen had broken through, he could barely surpass the former after going all out. Therefore, Sun Tianlang, despite being a Half step King, was pushed back for several steps under insufficient preparations. Fortunately, he didn’t allow Jiang Tian to escape.</p><p>Losing his opportunity, Jiang Tian entered the encirclement. Although he was not afraid of the combined assault of Sun Tianlang and Murong Qingcheng and could hold on for a while, breaking out of their encirclement was going to be extremely challenging.</p><p>“Ye Chen, you’d better let me leave. My Gu clan’s fury is not something you can handle.”</p><p>Iron Hand King’s heart was chilled. Since Ye Chen killed Storm King, he could kill him too. It was only a matter of time. He could only entrust his hopes on the Gu Clan’s mighty name, compelling Ye Chen to spare him.</p><p>“You really think that?” Ye Chen continued to unceasingly attack him, not allowing him to catch his breath.</p><p>“I’m extremely important to Gu Clan. Do you really not fear that my Gu Clan’s King will come to kill you?” Iron Hand King seemed like a paper tiger.</p><p>“Since I’ve already killed the Wind Storm King, how can I let you off?”</p><p>‘Either don’t kill at all, or kill everybody on the scene.’ If even one person was spared, it would leak the events. Ye Chen didn’t believe for a moment that if he spared Iron Hand King, he would not tell Space Emperor. Space Emperor was the current era’s titled Monarch—the king of kings. One Wind Storm King might not be enough to prompt him to personally make a move, but if Jing Tian was added, it might not be the case</p><p>How hard was it to cultivate talents? It was especially the case for a genius like Jing Tian who only appeared once in ten thousand years. If he killed Jing Tian and its news reached Space Emperor, it would most likely make him fly into a rage, and even Dragon King would find it hard to resist him.</p><p>“You lunatic! You have already offended the Space Emperor by killing the Wind Storm King. If you kill me too, my Gu Clan’s two kings will not let you off either. Chased by three Kings, even if you run to the Dragon God Celestial Palace, it will be useless. You’ll die for sure.” Iron Hand King roared, his hair standing erect. Boundless Zhen Yuan shot out of his body, ultimately condensing on his right fist. A blinding radiance immediately covered his right fist. Like a metallic fist carrying s strength of three hundred thousand jin, it smashed at Ye Chen.</p><p>“It’s futile!”</p><p>Ye Chen casually approached while the crescent moon shaped sword energy ripped the metallic fist apart and slashed at Iron Hand King’s protective Zhen Yuan.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>The Iron Hand King shot back like a released arrow, smashing into the wall at the open land’s edge. The wall exploded and Iron King escaped rapidly.</p><p>Iron Hand King was well aware that he was not Ye Chen’s opponent. Borrowing Ye Chen’s power, he broke through the wall and immediately took off. He had already half succeeded.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>But, how could Ye Chen let him escape? With a flying sword under his feet, he rapidly chased with Sword Control Flight, catching up in almost a blink of an eye.</p><p>“Break!” Ye Chen again slashed out a Waning Moon.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>Struck by sword energy, the Iron Hand King’s figure stumbled, and his speed reduced greatly.</p><p>“How can he be so quick?” Iron Hand King almost despaired.</p><p>“Your Zhen Yuan ought to be almost finished, no?”</p><p>Ye Chen had no fear that Iron Hand King would escape. Upon breaking through into late Sea of Soul realm, his Sword Control Flight had increased his speed to another level. On the other hand, Iron Hand King had already swallowed several Zhen Yuan restoring pills. The efficacy of medicinal power being converted into Zhen Yuan had become sluggish, unable to keep up with the rate of conversion.</p><p>One sword, two swords…ten swords!</p><p>Following that, the Iron Hand King forcibly endured ten sword strikes, every one which could kill anyone under peak Half step King level. The only reason Iron Hand King could live up to this moment was due to his Bronze Armor.</p><p>However, regardless of how powerful the armor was, he could no longer keep up with the Zhen Yuan consumption. At the tenth sword strike, the bronze runes on his Protective Zhen Yuan shattered.</p><p>“Die!” Seizing the opportunity, Ye Chen again slashed.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Iron Hand King’s protective Zhen Yuan was pierced and huge sparks flew off the Bronze Armor. Meanwhile, a bloody trail appeared on the Iron Hand King’s body from his forehead to his chin. It slowly widened, finally splitting into two halves with his brain interweaving with blood, looking extremely gruesome.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>The Iron Hand King fell on the ground, thoroughly dead.</p><p>“This quasi extreme grade armor is really perverted.” Violently letting out a breath of turbid air, Ye Chen’s face revealed a trace of bitter smile.</p><p>The quasi extreme grade armor could also be considered as an extreme grade armor. It was merely the inferior products among extreme grade artifacts. However, even so, it was extremely powerful. Without this armor, the Iron Hand King’s power was even inferior to Wind Storm King. So, how could he have endured for so long?</p><p>Taking off the Bronze Armor and storage ring, Ye Chen turned around and headed toward the open land.</p><p>Peng Peng Peng Peng!</p><p>Jiang Tian was battling against Sun Tianlang and Murong Qingcheng. Unceasing explosions echoed and frantic gales could be felt from far away.</p><p>“You can’t kill me.” Jiang Tian’s strength was extraordinary. Even fighting one against two, he didn’t fall into a disadvantage.</p><p>‘This kid is simply a freak.”</p><p>Sun Tianlang sucked in a cold breath. In so many years, he had only seen two freaks—one was Jiang Tian, and the other was Ye Chen. The previous geniuses he had seen were not even worth mentioning before these two. It was no wonder that people said that the world is vast.</p><p>“Elder brother Sun, Murong, you can leave him to me.” Ye Chen rushed over.</p><p>“Ye Chen, you killed the Iron Hand King?” Sun Tianlang turned and looked at Ye Chen, letting out a sigh of relief as he stepped aside along with Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>Ye Chen faintly nodded, “This world has no longer a person named Iron Hand King.”</p><p>“Good! Kill him, and it’s all good.”</p><p>Sun Tianlang was of the same mind. If this information leaked, his ending would not be good either. However, if all three died, there would be no issues. There were so many people in the graveyard, and nobody would be able to tell who killed these three.</p><p>Jiang Tian calmly looked at Ye Chen and said, “Ye Chen, don’t waste your energy. Even though you killed Old Feng, you can’t kill me.”</p><p>“Huh…”</p><p>Ye Chen looked at Jing Tian with a bewildered gaze. For him to speak in this manner even at this point, he was either insane or had something to rely on. And from his expression, it seemed like it was the second case.</p><p>“Then let me see why I can’t kill you.” Lightly stamping his feet, Ye Chen thrust at Jing Tian’s forehead.</p><p>‘Not dodging?’</p><p>Ye Chen’s Spiritual Sword was too quick, but Jing Tian calmly watched the Thunder Disaster Sword closing in on his forehead.</p><p>Whiz!</p><p>In a moment, his forehead would be pierced.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>At that moment, a shadow suddenly emerged out of Jing Tian’s body. This shadow condensed into a middle-aged man’s figure. It pinched its fingers toward the Thunder Disaster Sword’s tip, causing the sword as well as Ye Chen to be stuck in the void. He found it extremely hard to even move.</p><p>“Space Emperor!”</p><p>Ye Chen’s pupils shrank and his scalp went numb.</p><p>Pulling back the Thunder Disaster Sword, Ye Chen gnashed his teeth and used his strongest move—Waning Moon. Waning Moon energy ripped through the sky, gushing out.</p><p>With a peng, the sword energy crumbled, and Space Emperor’s figure remained unmoved.</p><p>“Ye Chen, we’ll meet again, given that you can live to that day.” Jing Tian’s figure flickered and disappeared as if he had teleported, only leaving behind his reverberating words.</p><p>Sun Tianlang’s complexion turned ugly, “This is bad! The Space Emperor actually left behind a trace of will in Jing Tian’s soul. As long as this will didn’t scatter, even a peak Half step King’s strongest attack wouldn’t kill him. Moreover, under the protection of this will, his speed was also increased by several times. We can’t chase after him.”</p><p>“I miscalculated!” Ye Chen pondered for a moment and then sighed.</p><p>Implanting will in other’s Sea of Soul was extremely taxing. Even Life and Death Kings were not willing to do it often. Jing Tian had an innate Martial Spirit Body, and thus, he naturally received special care from Space Emperor. Based on the circumstances just now, Ye Chen could more or less figure out that Space Emperor’s will had already reached the peak of the seventh step. Moreover, this will carried a strand of Space Emperor’s Zhen Yuan. The combination of these two couldn’t be broken by anybody under Life and Death realm. It was no wonder that Jing Tian was so confident.</p><p>“We don’t need to be excessively worried. One Wind Storm King might not be enough for Space Emperor to make a move on us.” Murong Qingcheng said.</p><p>“Right! What kind of status does the Space Emperor have? He is a majestic titled Monarch. If he acts to deal with the few of us, it would be beneath his dignity.” Sun Tianlang said while comforting himself.</p><p>Ye Chen faintly nodded, “Space Emperor probably won’t act himself to deal with us, but he won’t let us off either. Perhaps he will have some other methods. We can only walk one step at a time.”</p><p>If Space Emperor came by himself, Ye Chen could only resign himself to fate. After all, there was probably only one person in the whole True Spirit Continent who could resist him. Even Dragon King and Mysterious Queen were a bit lacking. Moreover, Ye Chen himself wouldn’t let himself be under the protection of Mysterious Queen and Dragon King at all times.</p><p>Pausing for a moment, Ye Chen continued, “Apart from Space Emperor, we also need to be wary of the Gu Clan’s retaliation. Elder Brother Sun, after leaving here, you best look for a place to hide, or even better, leave True Spirit Continent. I’ve implicated you.”</p><p>Letting out a breath, Sun Tianlang said, “This has nothing to do with you. This is my own choice. This is life! Rest assured, I won’t die that easily. If worse comes to worst, I’ll do as you say and leave True Spirit Continent and head to the open ocean. The world is big, so there ought to be a place for me.”</p><p>‘I’m afraid I’ll have to leave True Spirit Continent as well.’ Ye Chen said inwardly.</p><p>Previously, when he killed Ghost Wood King and other two, nobody knew. So, it would be hard to make people speculate. Now, not only Space Emperor and Gu Clan, even the powers behind those three would not let him off either. To offend so many powers in such a short while, Ye Chen’s coming days would certainly not be easy.</p><p>“Let’s think of other things later and divide the gains.”</p><p>Although Sun Tianlang didn’t help in killing Wind Storm King and Iron Hand King, he had staked his life alongside Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng. If he didn’t get a share, it would be too inexcusable. Moreover, after leaving this forbidden zone, he would have to leave the continent. A few additional treasures would certainly make his days easier.</p><p>Sun Tianlang said, “I didn’t do much, so just some spirit stones will be enough.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
