It made him suddenly realize that he should not use cultivation to judge Ye Chen.</p><p>Although the Ghost Wood King was not the top of the top demi beast king, but he would still be one of the powerful ones. Normal ones could not be able to last until this long. Righ tnow Ye Chen had used his peak level Mid Seas of Souls Realm cultivation could not only support himself through this kind of battle, he could also threaten his opponent from time to time as well. With the slightest reckless or carefulness, he knew he would have been wounded. It made him rethink about Ye Chen.</p><p>He knew now that if Ye Chen managed to breakthrough to the next level, then he might not be able to beat him at all.</p><p>Although they were still in a heated battle, but the Ghost Wood King kept spreading out his soul power so he knew about the appearance of the demi king warriors.</p><p>Called back his beast power, he stopped attacking Ye Chen, that massive ball entered the ground like a massive bug. However, it did not mean that those veins were for no use anymore. In the critical moment, those veins would be life-saving item for the beast king since it could also trapped everyone within the hundred meters radius. As for whether if the trick would be broken or not, then it would be a completely different matter.</p><p>Ye Chen was not stupid, although operating two swords at the same time forbidding him from sensing what was going on on the outside, but Ghost Wood King's expression had told him everything.</p><p>Indeed, waited until Ye Chen spread out his own soul power, he soon figured out why Ghost Wood King stopped attacking.</p><p>\"Gold Absolute King and Punish King's power was not weaker than Qing Liu. In comparison to the Ghost Wood King, they might be even more powerful. And it was only those two's power estimation. Plus those other five demi king warriors, and twenty top master warriors, if they were all against us at the same time, then we are losing for sure.\"</p><p>Ye Chen started to look serious.</p><p>The situation now did not look good for them. They might actually end up being the enemy of them all.</p><p>Shoo! Shoo!</p><p>Coincidently, Ye Chen and Qing Liu flew right next to the rest of them at the same time before increasing the distance between each of them in case they were surrounded.</p><p>The Ghost Wood King and the elder could not look for the five's trouble anymore, they also increased their distance, waiting to see what the situation would end up being.</p><p>After couple of blinks of an eye, all of the demi king warriors and those top master warriors arrived and stopped ten miles away, they all had different expression on their faces. Some of them had none on their face, looking extra cold, while some other warriors had a playful expression on their faces as they were about to enjoy some killing that they loved to do so much, some other of them were standing on the mountains, looking like they were not going to join in the battles easily.</p><p>\"So many demi king warriors!\" Lin Gaoming gasped.</p><p>Qing Liu said with a low voice, \"There are all seven of them in total, the most powerful ones must be the Punish King from the hell marital school, the gold absolute king being the second. These two's power is no weaker than mine. Amongst the remaining five, the Iron Hand King from the Gu family in east emperor city must be the most powerful.\"</p><p>As the former leader of the Mysterious School, besides some of the newly-appeared demi king warriors, and some of the hidden ones, Qing Liu basically knew them all.</p><p>\"Who is that demi king warrior on the left?\" Ye Chen glanced all seven of them before landing his eyes on that elder in brown robes.</p><p>She glanced at him, said, \"He is the demi king warrior from a rank 5 Dark Shadow Marital School in the Sky Marital Region. What's wrong?\"</p><p>Ye Chen said, \"Amongst them all, his qi is the weakest. In the most critical moment, we can choose to go through from this side.\"</p><p>Qing Liu did not know how Ye Chen judged on qi, but she had a different opinion. \"He might be the weakest, but his speed was not slower than the elder I fought before, and his battling style is very strange as well so it would be a tricky opponent to take on. It would not be easy to go through him.\"</p><p>\"Naturally, it would be impossible to be easy, but in comparison, this type of fast speed but rather weaker demi king warriors would be easier for me to take on.\"</p><p>Ye Chen's current power was not weaker than normal demi king warriors, even if it was the Ghost Wood King, it would be hard for him to wound him. This warrior's qi was the weakest of them all, it would be the last choice to go through since it was not Ye Chen trying to look him down.</p><p>Qing Liu thought about it and agreed eventually. Ye Chen's defense sword spell was always extremely fast, it would be almost impossible to try to escape from his attack with speed.</p><p>\"Haha, Gopher King, you are such a fly that pick on every cracked up stinky egg. What brought you here this time now?\" It was the Iron Hand King who spoked, Qing Liu did not know Ghost Wood King and the short elder, but he did, and it seemed like he and the short elder had spent quite a bit time before.</p><p>The Gopher King had a forced smile on his face, \"You do know me after all. But I guess it does not have anything to do with you, is there?\"</p><p>To be honest, the fire pear tree was too tempting for him, he would much rather spend a bit more effort than to just leave it with Ye Chen, once the words got out, the chance of him getting the tree would be even more slim. But he did not believe that Ye Chen would be with Qing Liu forever.</p><p>Whoo!</p><p>Heard him, Qing Liu let out a breath, by the looks of it, the Gopher King was not planning on telling on them. But then she realized he would not have since it would mean giving up on the tree for them.</p><p>Iron Hand King's eyes went around and he laughed. \"\"There are two demi king warriors on your side, they only had one. So, if you get the treasure, it would not have been yours, is that why you guys planned to just rob them? This is the forbidden forest, there must be a lot of spirit trees. It would not be a mid rank spirit tree that could make you, Gopher King, fight like this, so it must be a high rank one. Gopher King, am I right?\"</p><p>This Iron Hand King was so evil that he actually managed to tell exactly what had happened within two sentences, making everyone else change their expression.</p><p>The Gopher King chucked, he knew that since the others had already guessed it, then there would be no point in trying to hide it.</p><p>\"Let's go!\"</p><p>Qing Liu knew Iron Hang King's personality which was super greedy. There would not be anything good if they stayed.</p><p>\"Mysterious King, the treasure should belong to the ones who deserve it, leave the high rank spirit tree then you can leave.\" The Iron Hand King was not afraid of her, there were two king warriors inside the Gu family in the east emperor city. One being the east king and another being the destroy king. With them combined together, even if they were not as powerful as the Mysterious Queen, they could at least threaten her a bit, and this was the forbidden place, it was natural to fight for treasures, as long as they did not kill them, then the Mysterious Queen would have nothing to be angry about.</p><p>\"Iron Hand King, this is only from you. You said that we have a high rank spirit tree, so we must have one?\" Qing Liu said with a low voice.</p><p>\"Whether if you have it or not, then take out the stuff in your spirit ring and show us. Then we will all know who's right and who's wrong.\"</p><p>The Punish King held both of his hands in front of his chest, his tone was calm.</p><p>\"Yeah, take it out and we can see. If not, then we naturally would not look for troubles.\"</p><p>\"There are so many of us, you should at least give us something, right?\"</p><p>The high rank spirit tree was too attractive to move on for everyone, it was even ten times more valuable than a demi extreme rank weapon. If a martial school managed to get one, then their general power would increase to the next level. Most importantly, the high rank spirit tree could live at least ten thousand years, which meant in the future years, its effect would be continuous and unstoppable.</p><p>\"It would not be impossible for us to open our spirit tings, but you guys would have to do so too. Inside this forbidden place, I doubt it would be only us who got some goods from here.\"</p><p>Ye chen seeing that they were the target now, he took a deep breath and said calmly.</p><p>\"Brat, who do you think you are? Are you getting bored of being alive?\" Iron Hand King had a cold look on his face, he would not kill the Mysterious King Qing Liu but it did not mean that he would not kill Ye Chen. He was only a peak level Mid Seas of Souls Realm ant and somehow he dared to bargain with them?</p><p>\"Iron Hand King, who are you trying to scare here? Just wait until you get out of this forbidden place, I will show you who is more powerful.\" Qing Liu had never been this frustrated before, a killing intent appeared in her eyes.</p><p>\"Hehe, I will wait for you.\"</p><p>He did not seem to care for it at all.</p><p>\"Shadow King, move out of the way.\"</p><p>This place was not good for staying for too long, Qing Liu brought Ye Chen and the rest of them flying towards the Shadow King.</p><p>\"Sorry, this path is not open.\"</p><p>The Shadow King would not let go of this wonderful chance, his speed was the fastest and the hope of getting the high rank spirit tree would be just as much as the Punish King and the gold absolute king. At least that was what he thought.</p><p>\"Well, it has to be open!\"</p><p>Ye Chen did not want to waste time, he made a gesture with his sword finger, the gold sword and the green long sword shoot out of the scabbard immediately, they both then split into five, turning into ten sword shadows and shooting out towards the Shadow King. Due to the fact that it was moving way too fast, even though his speed was the fastest but he was still somehow slower.</p><p>Boom! Boom!...</p><p>That explosion sound continued to be heard, the Shadow King had been blown into the air, blood dripped down from the corner of his mouth.</p><p>Qing Liu was only slightly slower than Ye Chen. She waved out her hand and that crystalized palm power had blown out all of the top master level warriors including the Shadow King. It was so effortless as if they were tiny flies.</p><p>\"Let's go!\"</p><p>Qing Liu's protective zhen yuan covered Lin Gaoming while Yan Fengfeng turned back into her original form, that sword wings on Ye Chen's back flapped rapidly. A black light flashed once on Murong Qingchen's body before disappearing completely. The four of them shoot out with high speed, the next time they reappeared, they were already dozens miles away.</p><p>\"Where do you think you are going?\"</p><p>Iron Hand King lifted up his right hand, the palm surfaces of his shone black metal shine as he threw out an attack at Ye Chen and the other four.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>\"Landing Spell!\"</p><p>Qing Liu was demi king warrior after all, she knew that these people would not let them go easily so as she flew, she had already started to form a spell. The second that massive iron hand was approaching them, a similarly massive crystal palm print fell from the sky as well, pressing down the iron hand.</p><p>\"Evil Kill!\"</p><p>As the Iron Hand King's attack being canceled out, another even more powerful Punish King threw out another attack. He formed a spell with both of his hands, that mental clinging sound was heard. Something surprising had happened, in the deep part of the surreal space, ten iron chains appeared from above, trying to lock down the five's wrists. It would not be hard to guess what would happen if they were to get locked down.</p><p>\"Punish King, how dare you?\"</p><p>Qing Liu's face was full of angry. This punishing art was one of the most famous punishing marital art from the school, once being locked down by the iron chain, it would be worse than prisoners.</p><p>\"Mysterious Shield!\"</p><p>Qing Yuan had zhen yuan exploding around her, a blockage appeared in front of her, once it appeared, she brought Lin Gaoqing to fly out. When they reappeared, they were fifty miles away again. It was the real teleporting since it left no moving tracks.</p><p>However, she was still so worried. She and Lin Gaoming had made it out, but there were still Yan Fengfeng, Ye Chen and Murong Qingchen back there.</p><p>\"Nirvana Fire!\"</p><p>Yan Fengfeng in her natural form flapped her wings and that aggressive Nirvana Fire attacked the iron chain in the air, which was then burned down by the fire. She made it out.</p><p>\"Murong, go without me! I have my ways.\"</p><p>He did not have time to pass on a message with his zhen yuan, so he talked to her through soul directly which was something he learned recently.</p><p>Although she was very worried about him, but she knew that the reason that Ye Chen said this would be because he really meant it. If she stayed, it might actually cause the opposite effect.</p><p>She poured her demon power essense into her black wings, and her speed reached beyond demi king warrior's speed. When she reappeared, she was already hundred miles away and the iron chain had only caught a shadow of hers.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
