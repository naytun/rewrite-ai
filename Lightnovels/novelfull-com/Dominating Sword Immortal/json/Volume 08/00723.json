Once being tied down, the consequences would be catastrophic.</p><p>“Shadow Spell!”</p><p>In that critical moment, Ye Chen’s body started to become surreal, while his real body shoot out from where he was standing like a bug getting rid of its shield. That horrifying iron chain locked onto a “Ye Chen” which was even struggling which looked just like the real him.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The punish kill was not only the locking part, after locking the person, the follow up attack arrived instantly. The blade light flashed once in the air, which went through “Ye Chen’s” body. However, there was no blood, but only the shadow of Ye Chen that had been cut in halves. Both parts then disappeared into nothingness.</p><p>“That was such a close one!”</p><p>couple of miles away, Ye Chen’s forehead was covered in cold sweat. He did not expect it but the Punish King was actually so powerful. If it was not for the fact that he had already trained his shadow ultimate meaning to first stage completion, and his shadow separating flying art to mid ultimate meaning level, otherwise that attack would have at least wound him badly.</p><p>“Hm? Ultimate meaning of shadow?”</p><p>The punish king had a surprised look on his face. Qing Liu being able to escape his attack was something he had expected since her power was no weaker than his, it would have been weird if she could not. He was also not that surprised about Yan Fengfeng being able to dodge it since the Blue Phoenix was the most powerful high rank beast. Amongst all of those demi beasts, they were all equally powerful. Meanwhile, her nirvana fire came from the phoenix bloodline and its destroy power would be imaginably powerful.</p><p>As for that woman with that black bat wings, he knew that she should carry the perfect demi demon bloodline and trained demon power. But she would not be able to do so with only that, so that demon power must be in very high quality and definitely at king level demon power. With that kind of demon power, even if just with the slightest drop, it would have more than enough power to boost up the warrior’s speed to the next level. Therefore, it was still understandable for her to make it out alive.</p><p>The only part where the Punish King could not understand was Ye Chen and his shadow ultimate meaning which was one of the most difficult one ever. It might not be as fast s the wind, thunder or the fast ultimate meanings, but surviving and escaping, the shadow ultimate meaning might be the best of them all. He could not imagine how Ye Chen had trained it to this level.</p><p>“Interesting. I will let you off this time.”</p><p>He did not chase after them, his speed was just as fast as Qing Liu, and it might be even slightly slower. It would be impossible for him to catch up with them. Plus the other three were all super fast.</p><p>“Tian’er, those young warriors should not be underestimated.”</p><p>The skinny elder said to the young amn next to him.</p><p>The teenager with the symbol in between his eye brows said lightly, “Indeed some tricks up his sleeves.” Yan Fengfeng’s nirvana fire and Murong Qingchen’s demon power essence, as well as Ye Chen’s shadow ultimate meaning and defense sword spell had all caused a lot of interest in him.</p><p>“Bastard, you dare to wound me!”</p><p>The Shadow King that was blown out was furious. He was a demi king warrior but was somehow blown away like an ant by a peak level Mid Seas of Souls Realm warrior and was even slightly wounded. It was something he could not handle as if he had been directly slapped in the face.</p><p>“Shadow King, you loser! You cannot even stop some weak warriors.” Iron Hand King stopped looking at those of who had been long one, he turned around to look at Shadow King with disgust.</p><p>Ah!</p><p>The Shadow King roared. He pointed at the Iron Hand King and screamed, “Iron Hand King! I dare you to say it again!”</p><p>“I say, you are a loser!”</p><p>Iron Hand King sounded extra mean and despiteful.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The Shadow King had anger filled up his mind, he forgot the fact that the Iron Hand King was way much more powerful than him. He shook out his assassinating weapons and each one of them contained demi king warrior zhen yuan and that unbreakable marital will.</p><p>“You are the one looking for death!”</p><p>Iron Hand King had cold light in his eyes, he made a grabbing gesture and all of the weapons had been collected before pushing back at the Shadow King.</p><p>After couple of screams, the Shadow King backed out couple of steps. However, he was not wounded at all, all of the top master level warriors behind him had all been killed.</p><p>“So brutal! This time, the assassinate martial school has definitely taken a bit hit.”</p><p>A lot of the warriors watching shook their head, the top master level warriors were not nobodies nor someone you can just easily find on the streets. This time, all of the top warriors here were all hand-picked top warriors. And now all of them were dead.</p><p>It was like a bucket of ice water poured down on Shadow King’s head, he finally was woken up from his anger. Seeing that all of the top master level warriors from his school had been killed within a second, he did not what to act anymore, he said, “Iron Hand King, you are so bloodless, they had not done a thing to piss you off. Are you not afraid of our school challenging your Gu family?”</p><p>“The appearance of the graveyard, all the lives are in our own hands now. If your school really wants to battle with mine, then we will just wait for you. I am just afraid that you don’t dare.”</p><p>Before the Iron Hand King was a bit angry as well so he actually failed to control his power a bit. But it would be impossible for him to admit his mistake so he would just have to be committed to the decision he made.</p><p>“Alright, alright. I, the Shadow King, will remember this. Your Gu family warriors remember to avoid me, otherwise I will kill them all.”</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>Leaving that horrible sentence, the Shadow King’s body disappeared in the wind.</p><p>“Huh! He really thinks he could do that?’</p><p>Iron Hand King was a bit regretted, it was not that he was afraid of him, but the Gu family around him was not him after all, they would not be able to block out his attacks for sure.</p><p>“You lot, do not leave me for the next couple of days.”</p><p>The Iron Hand Man warned his warriors.</p><p>…</p><p>Hundreds thousands miles away, deep in the woods, Ye Chen and the group stopped.</p><p>“Is everyone alright?”</p><p>Qing Liu let out a breath secretly, this time they were able to get out was pure luck. Seven demi king warriors were no jokes. If three of them attacked at the same time, then the five of them would potentially lose everything. It was also lucky that YE Chen was able to blow away the Shadow King as well, earning them enough time to react.</p><p>“Teacher, I am alright.”</p><p>Yan Fengfeng’s face was a bit pare. The nirvana fire was her life fire, it would not be endless and would take a long time to gain back.</p><p>“Don’t worry, senior. Everyone is alright.”</p><p>Ye Chen was the one that was worried the most but somehow was also the one burned out the least. Yan Fengfeng had used her nirvana fire to make it through while Murong Qingchen used her demon power essence. He used the application of the ultimate meaning of shadow.</p><p>“Very good. Next, we should try out best to be careful as we search for the graveyard.” Qing Liu looked around and said.</p><p>The whole place was massive, even the five did not know where they were exactly. All they could do was to follow their instinct.</p><p>Boom! Boom!</p><p>They did not know how long they had walked, but the five arrived in an area of thunder/</p><p>“Is this place also a spell? Such aggressive thunder.” All they could see was dark thunder clouds and those countless thunder fell from within. These thunder and lightning were more powerful with the enhancement of the spell. That destroy qi was so scary even if it was the demi king warriors could not ignore.</p><p>“Look! There is a human shadow there.”</p><p>Lin Gaoming saw something by accident. He cried out.</p><p>Qing Liu frowned, “What kind of person is there? Why is that person not rush to come out?” As she said, she looked over following Lin Gaoming’s sight.</p><p>Ye Chen and the other two looked over as well.</p><p>A human shadow stood in the air and cruised around causally in that dense thunder storm.</p><p>It was not what shocked the five. What shocked them was that the human warrior did not have zhen yuan protection, those thunder and lightning had all landed on his head, forehead, chest and back. It basically drowned him within. But somehow it did not leave any marks on him at all as if he was only a media that carried through everything.</p><p>“So powerful.”</p><p>Ye Chen gasped. He could tell that this person was no Life and Death Realm warrior, just like Qing Liu, that warrior was also a demi king warrior. However, these thunder and lightning would be close to demi king warrior’s full power attack. Even if it was a demi king warrior, he or she would have to activate their protective zhen yuan. But this warrior had handled all of that with his bare body as if his own body was a part of the thunder storm.</p><p>“It is him!”</p><p>Qing Liu cried out loud as well.</p><p>“Senior Qing Liu, who is this person?” Ye Chen asked curiously.</p><p>Qing Liu said, “There are rankings for the demi king warriors as well, although my power would be counted as quite alright, but it would not be as powerful as the top ones. There were only three of those warriors, and this warrior is indeed one of them. He is called the Thunder Spirit King who has the thunder spirit body. His understanding in the thunder ultimate meaning is very high, according to rumors, once he manages to enter the life and death realm, he could be able to push down the thunder king from the thunder region and take on the thunder king title. And only him could ignore that demi king warrior level thunder impact.”</p><p>“Thunder Spirit King!”</p><p>Ye Chen had heard about it before. And that he was the most powerful warrior out of all of the demi king warriors.</p><p>“With this forbidden place appearing in our world, almost all of the demi king warriors were out here. Next, we should really be careful. Although the Thunder Spirit King is known for his coldness, but he could not kill innocent men. But if it was the other demi king warriors, then we would not know that for sure.”</p><p>Qing Liu was not worried about herself but more for Yan Fengfeng and the rest of them.</p><p>Ye Chen nodded, he could sense it that this time, it would be different from before. Normally, the opponent he encountered would not be that much more powerful, even if he could not compete with them, he knew that he could get out safely for sure. But this time, all of the potential opponents were all demi king warriors. And with current power, he could only try to compete with normal demi king warriors. The Ghost Wood King was slightly weaker than Qing Liu if it was not for Yan Fengfeng and them trying their best to distract him, he could have only use his immortal art to kill the time. Once that battle being stretched for too long, the consequences would be catastrophic since the demi king warrior’s zhen yuan would be way richer than his and his immortal art would need a lot of yuan qi as well.</p><p>“It seems like I have to try to find an opportunity to increase the cultivation to Late Seas of Souls Realm, otherwise it would be too dangerous.”</p><p>Ye Chen’s cultivation was only one step away from the Last Seas of Souls Realm, he might be able to make a breakthrough any second now. Once he does, then his zhen yuan would increase at least thirty percent, and the zhen yuan quality would be able to increase a lot as well. Most importantly, once reached Late Seas of Souls Realm, he would experience a short moment of all-unity mode where he could feel his body and the nature merging together. A that moment, he would be able to see and feel like he never did before.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
