Why are they so freaked out?”</p><p>Yan Fengfeng flicked her eye brows. As a beast herself, she did not know what fear was. As her power increased, that reckless brutal qi started to show as well.</p><p>Murong Qingchen’s gold pupils scanned the place, she said to the rest of them, “In the deep part of the forest, there were a lot of killing flowers. And by the looks of it, they might be the oldest kind.”</p><p>The most dangerous thing in the forest was not beasts, nor enemies. It was the killing flowers. They were born to kill, kill to fest. If not careful, one might not even know what killed him.</p><p>The warriors who flew to the top of the cave saw the five, their expression changed a little before leaving this place without looking back.</p><p>“Let’s go down.”</p><p>Qing Liu flashed her body, flying down the cliff.</p><p>Since the forest itself was approaching two hundred meter. And less than a hundred to the top. The top was covered in black rocks in different shapes. Some of them looked like massive teeth pointing towards different directions. Flying above the forest would need constant attention in trying to avoid the spikes from below as well as above. There might even be potentially deadly hidden beings somewhere as well.</p><p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p><p>Flying out only dozens of miles, countless black bats flew out from the black rocks. These bats were the size of dogs. Their eyes bloody red and teeth pointy. They had sensed the presence of the five so they shoot out immediately.</p><p>“Not good! it is the shadow ghost bat!”</p><p>Qing Liu was shocked. The dark creatures had a lot to do with the demon race. At the same cultivation, even two to three of them would be way more powerful than them.</p><p>“Thunder Devour!”</p><p>Ye Chen held his thunder sword high above him before waving out. That massive black thunder ball was like a fallen black sun, landing amongst the bat group.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The thunder light exploded and spread out like a spider net. Countless bat beast had been killed by that sword attack. A burning smell filled up the place.</p><p>Qing Liu and the rest of them joined the attacking.</p><p>But there were just way too many of them. In the beginning, it was just a pile of darkness, but in the end, there was no space that they were not in already.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The massive dark bat hidden amongst the bat group. It shoot out a black halo towards Ye Chen and the group. It ignored all of their defense zhen yuan and attacked directly at them.</p><p>“Watch out!”</p><p>Ye Chen’s reflex and sensation was at a different level. He was the first to react, moving ten meters to the side avoiding the halo’s reach. Qing Liu was not slow as well, her body flashed and disappeared completely from where she was standing. Although Yan Fengfeng and Murong Qingchen were also very fast, but their reflex was still not as fast as the other two, they did not make it out of the halo. As for Lin Gaoming, he did not eve have a chance to react, he was caught right in the middle of the dark halo.</p><p>Ah!</p><p>Yan Fengfeng and Murong Qingchen were completely fine. But Lin Gaoming seemed to be going though something. The green veins popped up on his face, both of his eyes were filled with blood shot. He was almost hysterical. A inhuman roar came out from his throat as he jumped at Yan Fengfeng who was standing behind him.</p><p>Yan Fengfeng was not completely not affected, but perhaps it was because of her natural form, she had only the slightly impact. But that natural evil qi of her beast form came out a bit more. Therefore, when Lin Gaoming jumped at her, she threw out a punch unconsciously, blowing him away.</p><p>She had only used seventy percent of her power so she did not plan to wound him at all.</p><p>Unfortunately, Lin Gaoming land in amongst the bat groups and his whole body was surrounded by them. He turned into a hundred-meter big black ball which spins continually looking extra horrifying.</p><p>“Mysterious Spell!”</p><p>Qing Liu saw that something was wrong, she threw out a palm attack immediately.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The black massive ball exploded. But Lin Gaoming was already nowhere to be seen. Even his bones had been devoured completely by the bats.</p><p>“Do not fight back. Let’s go down!”</p><p>Qing Liu was shocked. It was her first time seeing this many ghost bats, especially the ones that hid in the dark. She knew a bit about that black halo. It should be a special power of the dark creatures. That aggressive element halo could make dark creature’s power increase drastically, but the humans would lose their mind. Lin Gaoming was not Yan Fengfeng who was a blue phoenix originally, nor Murong Qingchen who had the perfect demi demon bloodline. So, out of the three of them only Lin Gaoming would be affected.</p><p>Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!</p><p>The four of them flashed their bodies and flew into the forest.</p><p>Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi!</p><p>The ghost bats followed right behind them, like a black river.</p><p>Flying through the forest, the four got to take a slight breather since there were a lot of trees in the forest which could scatter the bats. As time went on, the amount of ghost bats decreased drastically. It was not that they were in the hiding, it was more that they were eaten by the dangerous creatures without anyone knowing.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>However, the forest was also extremely dangerous. In the dark, a room full of bloody red flowers crawled out from the mud and attacked towards Ye Chen on the left. Ye Chen’s reflex was extremely sharp, a black sword qi sliced through, the flower had been sliced in halves, countless acid liquid poured out, making a noise.</p><p>Soon, another huge amount of killing veins attacked the four from different directions. In this underworld environment, an invisible power covered all of them. The four could only reach out their soul power by couple of hundreds meters. But these veins moved so fast that only until they got super close could they see it. It required the four’s full attention which meant they had to decrease their speed as well. Luckily, there were not many ghost bats in the back chasing them anymore.</p><p>Finally, the four made it through this forest and arrived in the marshland.</p><p>“If not necessary, try not to go above the forest.”</p><p>Qing Liu was feeling regretful for Ling Gaoming who was one of the top warrior supporting the marital school. And he was only at ninety years old this year. If he did not die, then in the not too far future, he might be able to make it to demi king warrior. Even becoming a life and death realm warrior might not be impossible. Him being dead would be a loss for the Mysterious Marital school.</p><p>Yan Fengfeng said, “If I was going a bit lighter before, or even just move away, then this will not have happened.” She was blaming herself. Back then, she could have simply avoided, but there was a pile of evil qi in her heart and she had to find an outlet.</p><p>Qing Liu waved her hand and said, “This has nothing to do with you. The aggressive halo would affect the beast more than the humans. Because of your bloodline, the effect might be a bit less so it was already really rare for you to be able to control your mind.”</p><p>Waited a while, Qing Liu said again, “People cannot come back alive after dying. So right now, we just have to be extra careful.”</p><p>They had to be careful. In the remaining four of them, besides her, Yan Fengfeng, Ye Chen and even Murong Qingchen were all marital geniuses who Qingxuan thought highly of. Any one of them being killed would not be acceptable. If all of them died, then she would not have the face to go back to her school.</p><p>“Senior, don’t worry, we will take care of ourselves.”</p><p>Ye Chen knew that Qing Liu had a huge responsibility, he said with full confidence.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go!”</p><p>Qing Liu sighed. A sharp light shone from her eyes.</p><p>…</p><p>“Damn! Why is there so many dark shadow ghost bats?”</p><p>Above the forest, a lot of the bat beasts chased after the Shadow King. If they were normal ones, he would not have been this hurried or scuffled at all. But that aggressive halo from the leader of the bat pack had affected him drastically.</p><p>“Hundred Shadow Change!”</p><p>Formed a spell with both of his hands, the Shadow King split himself in halves, then in fours…, soon there were hundreds of him. It was the only reason that he managed to escape out of the ghost bat trap.</p><p>After the Shadow King had left, the black robes suddenly cracked open, a massive black stone coffin appeared out of nowhere and was carried by countless bats.</p><p>Crack! Crack!</p><p>The lid of the coffin was slowly opened. It was pitch dark inside.</p><p>After couple blinks worth of time, the coffin had been opened completely. That horrifying black qi poured out, formed into a pile of darkness in the air.</p><p>Pooh!</p><p>That black qi went away and a human shaped ghost bat appeared in the air.</p><p>“Such tasty blood and flesh smell.” It was a three-meter-tall ghost bat with massive muscles. His skin was metallic black. And a pair of beast teeth revealed out of the mouth. Purple liquid dripped down from above. While that massive black clouds like bat wings sticked out from his back. There was another pair of claws on top of the wings.</p><p>He licked his lips. A lot of color flashed through his eyes. There was aggressiveness, evilness, toughness, and madness.</p><p>“King!”</p><p>All of the bats surrounded him, even some of the bat leaders that had been hiding in the dark walked out as well. They were speaking human languages.</p><p>“You guys are so useless. You cannot handle some humans even.”</p><p>The human shaped ghost bat was the king of them all. He had been in deep sleep. Only by the smell of blood and flesh can he be woken up. However, he was different than a human. Every time he woke up, it would take days to become fully awake. When the first batch of people came in, he had been woken, but when he really woke up now, a couple batch of people had gone through.</p><p>The bat leader lowered his head. He did not say another word. It was not that they were useless, it was that amongst the three batches of people that went past, powerful demi king warriors were amongst them as well.</p><p>“Alright, since I am out now. No one would be able to go through here anymore. Eh! Someone is coming again!”</p><p>The ghost bat king flashed his body, disappearing from where he was standing.</p><p>Couple miles away, three human shadows were flying in fast speed.</p><p>Suddenly, in front of them, a huge amount of black qi appeared out of nowhere.</p><p>“Haha, stay here and be my blood and fest!”</p><p>The Ghost Bat King appeared.</p><p>“Not good! A demi king level dark creature!” There were also demi king warriors amongst the three. He was shocked, but he soon threw out a blade attack towards the opponent.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>When the blade light went through the black qi, the body of the bat king cracked open, but it was only a shadow of his. The real him appeared above the three warriors.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>A circle of aggressive halo spread out from the bat king’s body, covering the three within. Their protective zhen yuan was decoration.</p><p>Ah!Ah!Ah!…</p><p>The aggressive halo was at least ten times more powerful than the one before. Even that demi king warrior had entered a mad mental level, they started to fight each other. And soon, only that human demi king warrior left behind.</p><p>“Now, die!”</p><p>The beast jumped towards him, biting onto the human warrior’s neck and sucking the blood out of him until there was nothing left.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
