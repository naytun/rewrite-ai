And now that she had personally arrived, this aura was far stronger than the will projection.</p><p>To talk about her achievements, even days would not be enough. The most important matter was that she was the youngest Life and Death King in the past thousand years. She was several times younger than the Beast King, but in terms of strength, he wouldn’t be able to catch up to her even if he rode a horse. Many racked their brains trying to figure out how she had the strength of a peak King despite being in Life and Death realm for such a short time, and could contend with characters like Dragon King, Evil King, and Prison King.</p><p>A monstrous talent, peak King level strength, and unfathomable means created Mysterious Queen’s fame. It was enough to make any King apprehensive.</p><p>“Even the Mysterious Queen has arrived. Others have surely arrived as well.” Black Mountain Queen was arrogant, but before a woman like Mysterious Queen, she could only lower her head.</p><p>The spatial ripple came from the entrance of the forbidden zone which was quite far away. Ordinary Kings would take the time worth brewing a cup of tea to cover this distance while peak Kings would take one-third of this time. After all, the space of the forbidden region was extremely sturdy, and one’s speed would be significantly lower than the external world, especially so inside the graveyard. There were many arrays at work, and even Kings would have to take the entrance. If they tried to force their way in, they might trigger some array, or even the array of the Four Extreme Emperor.</p><p>Taking the two predators, Black Mountain Queen didn’t make things difficult for Beast King and Night Ghost King. Sitting on the throne, she streaked across; the hard passage walls seemingly non-existent for her.</p><p>…</p><p>Before the entrance of the Four Extreme Emperor’s grave, Ye Chen stood with an astounded face. He had not received a profound martial skill or a secret art. Instead, it was something much harder to comprehend than both—the foundations of space profound.</p><p>“Four Extreme Emperor had absolutely reached the great circle of space profound. He was at a realm that is simply unattainable. One step further would be the natural laws. His summarization of space profound foundation will make my study of space profound much easier.”</p><p>To summarize a profound’s basics, one must have attained the great circle in the said profound. Otherwise, the summarization would inevitable have some errors or omissions. Taking one step back, if one didn’t reach the realm of perfection, they simply couldn’t formulate the basics, because they themselves wouldn’t have had understood the profound completely.</p><p>“Four Extreme Emperor is worthy of being a peerless hero. Space profound is one of the strongest profounds. Once it attains the realm of perfection, what kind of powerful profound martial skill would be created! With this foundation of space profound, my space profound can reach minor success soon.”</p><p>Ye Chen’s space profound was currently at twenty percent, not far away from minor success. However, the three barriers of the space profound were the hardest, which were the minor success, the greater success, and perfection. According to Ye Chen’s own estimate, he would have needed another half a year to reach minor success.</p><p>“I wonder what did the three obtain.” Ye Chen turned his head and looked at Tantai Mingyue and the rest.</p><p>The three had different expressions. Jing Tian had his fists tightly clenched and his eyes shining brightly as if having gotten something good. Xia Houzun was in high spirits, giving off an aura of wild ambition, while Tantai Mingyue turned her head and glanced at Ye Chen, faintly smiling.</p><p>“All three of them have big gains, ah! That’s not surprising. All of us had the key. I can’t be the only one with huge gains. According to the ranking of the keys, Tantai Mingyue’s gains should be greater than mine.”</p><p>“But, this has nothing to do with me. Whatever gains others have, as long as my gains conform with my heart’s desire, it’s good enough.”</p><p>The foundations of space profound were extremely precious. To attain Life and Death realm, one must have some comprehension of space profound. After all, everybody lived in space.</p><p>“Who killed my Gu Clan’s Half step King?”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>At the center of Four Extreme graveyard, space shattered like a mirror and a terrifying, destructive aura leaked out. The entire plaza was covered in queer Qi currents. At the same time, a yellow-robed old man walked out with eyes brimming with killing intent.</p><p>“Destruction King!”</p><p>“Gu Clan’s Destruction King has arrived.”</p><p>Everybody was alarmed. Gu Clan had two Kings—East King and Destruction King. This yellow-robed old man was precisely the Destruction King.</p><p>This time, he had not come for Iron Hand King’s revenge. Of course, if the perpetrator’s background was small, that would be a different matter. He had basically come for the Bronze Armor. It was a pseudo extreme grade artifact which even spirit stones couldn’t buy. How could the Gu Clan let it fall in the hands of others?</p><p>For an ordinary King, a pseudo extreme grade artifact was equivalent to an extreme grade artifact. Only an ancient family like Gu clan, who once produced the East Emperor, could have enough resources to bestow a pseudo extreme grade armor to a Half step King. Of course, it didn’t mean that they didn’t care about pseudo extreme grade artifacts. In fact, they cared a lot. It was a family heirloom.</p><p>When the Destruction King arrived, many other Life and Death Kings also arrived, representing various factions of which other Half step Kings had died in the forbidden zone. However, they were not like Destruction King, immediately suppressing others. This was mainly because they had not equipped their Half step Kings with pseudo extreme grade artifacts. Moreover, which of the half step kings entering the forbidden zone did not have their own backing? If they truly used force, it would be the same as declaring war on their backing. That would be extremely unwise.</p><p>“Destruction King has come…I wonder if the East King has come or not.”</p><p>“He is probably here, hiding in the dark and quietly observing the changes, Or, perhaps he didn’t come at all.”</p><p>The Kings who had already arrived were discussing secretly.</p><p>The Kings in True Spirit Continent were roughly divided into four levels. The first level was precisely titled monarchs, the second was peak kings, third was upper grade kings, and fourth—which was also the majority—were ordinary kings. Although Gu Clan was not one of the four great clans under the heavens, they were not much weaker. They had the East King, who had attained the strength of upper-grade King long ago. Not one amongst the four great clans dared to look down on the Gu Clan. Moreover, the upper echelon of True Spirit Continent also treated the Gu Clan as the fifth great clan under the heavens.</p><p>“Senior Destruction King, I know who killed Iron Hand King.” After a brief silence on the plaza, a voice sounded.</p><p>“En?” Destruction King looked over. At the same time, the majority of people also looked in the direction of the voice</p><p>Ye Chen creased his brows. He could tell that the speaker was Jing Tian.</p><p>“Who are you?” Destruction King asked.</p><p>Jing Tian proudly said, “I’m called Jing Tian. My master is the Northern Oceans Space Emperor.”</p><p>“Space Emperor Sect’s disciple!”</p><p>The gaze of numerous Life and Death Kings on Jing Tian changed. Jing Tian himself didn’t amount to anything, but his master Space Emperor was renowned. This was a peerless king capable of contending with the Void Emperor. However, he always stayed in the Northern Ocean, so the ordinary people in True Spirit Continent had never heard his name.</p><p>“So, you’re Space Emperor’s disciple. You know who killed my Gu Clan’s Half step King?” Destruction King’s voice softened.</p><p>Jing Tian looked at Ye Chen and said, “When Iron Hand King died, I was there. My master’s helper Storm Wind King also died at his hands. And this person is him.” Saying that, he pointed at Ye Chen.</p><p>“Him?” Everybody’s gazes focused on Ye Chen.</p><p>“Late Sea of Soul realm?”</p><p>Some Life and Death Kings couldn’t help but crease their brows. A late young man with Sea of Soul realm cultivation base actually killed two Half step Kings? This was simply astonishing!</p><p>“It’s Ye Chen!”</p><p>“Ye Chen actually killed Iron Hand King and Storm King.”</p><p>“Too frightening!”</p><p>Life and Death Kings didn’t recognize Ye Chen, but other Half step Kings and peak Masters knew him, and every one of them was stupefied.</p><p>“Ye Chen!”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng turned a little nervous and grabbed his palm.</p><p>Ye Chen faintly let out a breath and said to Murong Qingcheng, “Don’t worry, he can’t do anything to me.”</p><p>“Ye Chen, be at ease! At most, he will scare you a bit.”</p><p>Qin Liu had also killed several Half step Kings, but she didn’t care at all. If there was a competition, deaths were inevitable. So what if they were Gu Clan? They couldn’t do anything.</p><p>“This child is Ye Chen, eh?”</p><p>Beside Tantai Mingyue, a middle-aged woman had appeared at some point. Her aura was vast as the heavens, seeming stronger than all the Life and Death Kings present.</p><p>“Yes, great grandmother!” Tantai Mingyue faintly nodded. This middle-aged woman was none other than Tantai Clan’s Life and Death King, Moon Queen, and also a senior of the current era. Before the appearance of Mysterious Queen, Moon Queen was regarded as the number one Queen. Her strength was immeasurable. Only with her backing could the Tantai Clan sit steadily amongst the four great clans under the heavens.</p><p>“A young hero, indeed!”</p><p>Moon Queen admired Ye Chen a lot, and was quite clear of his achievements. She couldn’t help but sigh that both Tantai and Dugu Clan’s younglings were bound to be overshadowed with the existence of a prodigious talent like Ye Chen.</p><p>“So, you’re Ye Chen! I’ve heard some rumors that you are some kind of super genius. It seems there really is some truth to it. However, you killed a Half step King of my Gu Clan and snatched his bronze armor. Aren’t you a bit too dismissive of my Gu Clan?”</p><p>Destruction King was a little stunned. After knowing Ye Chen’s identity, he immediately dispelled any thoughts of killing him. After all, his original objective not to avenge Iron Hand King; he only wanted to regain Bronze Armor and make some trouble for the perpetrator.</p><p>“Iron Hand King wanted to kill me, so I killed him, and his armor is my spoils.”</p><p>Ye Chen’s reply was simple. Iron Hand King wanted to kill him, so he naturally resisted. As for the Bronze Armor, it was his spoils of war. Of course, it was not beyond discussion,</p><p>“You sure have guts. But, that’s just your account of what actually happened. Return the armor and follow me back to Gu Clan to apologize, and I’ll let you off.”</p><p>“Bronze Armor is my spoils of war. If you want it back, you need to at least compensate me. As for apologizing to the Gu Clan, pardon me, but that’s not possible. I did nothing wrong.”</p><p>“I’m afraid you don’t get to choose.” Destruction King had no thoughts about arguing with Ye Chen as his gaze sharpened.</p><p>“Destruction King, what do you think you’re doing?” Qin Liu stepped forward.</p><p>“Mysterious Sect Master, this matter has nothing to do with the Mysterious Sect.” Destruction King was extremely apprehensive of the Mysterious Queen, and thus, was rather courteous to Qin Liu.</p><p>“It has nothing to with the Mysterious Sect?” Just as Qin Liu was about to respond, a vast and mighty spatial ripple appeared, revealing a beautiful spatial door.</p><p>“It’s her!” Moon Queen raised her head as her eyes brightly shone, distorting the space before her.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
