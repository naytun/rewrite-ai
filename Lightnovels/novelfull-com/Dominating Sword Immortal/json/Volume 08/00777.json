The two yanked the chains in their hands, which pounced on Ye Chen like two dragons rising above the water—one from the left and one from the right. The frightening pressure created by the Six Way Cloud Polation caused the space around Ye Chen to freeze, making dodging even more difficult.</p><p>At this moment, Ye Chen had no choice but to fire four Void Shattering Fingers one after another, Causing the space to immediately warp. Despite being so powerful, the Six Way Cloud Polation’s trajectory was warped, diverging from its original path.</p><p>“Space Profound!” Black Scale’s pupils shrunk.</p><p>“His space profound has become a lot stronger!”</p><p>Duo Long was the only person who had experienced Ye Chen’s Void Shattering Finger. He could tell that it had become much more powerful, and could actually warp the trajectory of Six Way Cloud Polation.</p><p>With his figure dodging backward, Ye Chen didn’t dare to waste a single moment as he took out two pills from his storage ring. Then, he directly swallowed one and tucked one in his mouth. These pills were half step supreme grade pills given to him by Dragon God Celestial Palace. Not only could these pills restore Zhen Yuan quickly, they had no side effects. Unfortunately, he only had one bottle, and every single pill counted.</p><p>The pill dissolved and flowed into his flesh and bones like a sparkling river. At the same time, it was quickly restoring his Zhen Yuan.</p><p>“Let’s use the Six Way Array. He has half step supreme grade Zhen Yuan recovering pills.” When the blue-skinned demonic human saw Ye Chen’s Zhen Yuan turning vigorous again, his face changed and he roared.</p><p>“To make us use the Six Way Array, this kid can be proud even in his death.”</p><p>Ye Chen’s tenacity made the six demonic humans’ expressions turn grave. The Six Way Cloud Polation was an artifact passed down in demonic human clan, which could combine six into one and separate one into six, making it a pseudo extreme grade artifact. Corresponding to this Six Way Cloud Polation was the Six Way Array. It could not only trap the enemy, but also allowed them to slowly grind the enemy down to death. It was originally reserved for dealing with ‘Strongest’ half-step Kings. Never did they expect to use it on Ye Chen with merely a cultivation base of peak Sea of Soul realm.</p><p>The Zhen Yuan consumption of the six was also not low, and the Six Way Array also required heavy consumption. Therefore, the six simultaneously swallowed medicinal pills and tried to recover Zhen Yuan with all their might.</p><p>“Six Way Array, Seal the world!”</p><p>The slender chains lengthened by multiple folds, and the six separated from each other, surrounding Ye Chen while forming a six-directional array. As soon as the array formed, frightening black streams of Qi followed the chains and erupted from the bodies of the six, forming six black-colored Qi pillars. The pillars interlinked with each other, creating a black membrane and trapping Ye Chen within.</p><p>Inside the array, Ye Chen could no longer see the island. Wherever he looked, he could only see coiling black Qi.</p><p>“What a profound array technique!”</p><p>Ye Chen’s Zhen Yuan had already recovered to eighty percent, allowing him to stop concerning over Zhen Yuan consumption for the time being. However, his current situation made him feel far from optimistic.</p><p>Swish…</p><p>Amidst the coiling Qi in the spatial void, one black Qi chain suddenly popped out of nowhere and attacked Ye Chen with a seemingly invincible aura.</p><p>Ye Chen didn’t dare to face it head on, and used the Void Shattering Finger’s power to divert its trajectory.</p><p>However, in the next moment, five more chains suddenly attacked him. Not being able to see the source of the chains, Ye Chen’s reactions were a bit delayed. He had no way of diverting the five trajectories simultaneously, and could only divert three chains. The remaining two chains seemed like evil dragons baring their fangs.</p><p>“Sword Light Flight Art!”</p><p>Sword wings grew on his back and his figure flickered, dodging the two chains by a hair’s breadth.</p><p>Swish…</p><p>The first wave of attack failed, but the second followed close behind. The six chains danced in the void, laying down an inescapable net. Ye Chen seemed to be walking on a tightrope and could be hit by the chains at any moment, making him fall off the rope and fall into an abyss.</p><p>“This can’t go on. Do I really have to use the Sky Scorpio Sword?”</p><p>Stuck inside the Six Way Array, Ye Chen had already fallen into a downward spiral. He would be defeated sooner or later, and then killed. At this point, only the Sky Scorpio Sword could help him break out of this array. However, using the Sky Scorpio Sword was an extremely important matter.</p><p>Sky Scorpio Sword was the sword of the Sky Scorpio King under the Four Extreme Emperor. It contained one of the ten great mystical irons—purple crystal iron. It could immediately crystallize anything it touched, turning them extremely brittle. Its might was tyrannous, far exceeding ordinary extreme grade artifacts.</p><p>However, he could only use the sword once with his Zhen Yuan. After that, his Zhen Yuan would be completely spent. Although he had the Dragon God Medal which could instantly restore thirty percent of his Zhen Yuan, and also more than half a bottle of half step extreme grade Zhen Yuan restoring pills, one shouldn’t forget the five hundred Sea of Soul demon humans outside.</p><p>Even if he killed the six half-step demonic human Kings by using the Sky Scorpio Sword, he would have to face a combined assault of five hundred Sea of Soul demonic humans. Before the destructive power of such a level, not to mention him, even a ‘strongest’ half-step King would be destroyed in body and soul.</p><p>Even if one set all that aside for a moment, once Ye Chen revealed the Sky Scorpion Sword, he must kill all witnesses. If the sword’s news made it back to the demonic clan, he would no longer be chased by Sea of Soul realm experts or half-step demonic human Kings, but true Demonic Human Kings. If that happened, even with Sky Scorpio Sword in his hands, he would only have death as his only option.</p><p>Could he kill everybody present on the scene? Clearly not!</p><p>The most probable outcome was him killing the six demonic half-step Kings, then perishing at the hands of the five hundred Sea of Soul realm experts. The chances of that happening were ninety percent.</p><p>“In any case, it’s still not the moment of life and death. Before that last moment, I can’t use the Sky Scorpio Sword.”</p><p>Being overcautious was not Ye Chen’s style, but he was not brash either. Ye Chen decided to wait for Murong Qingcheng’s breakthrough. They would join hands to break this Six Way Array and then open a channel in the enchantment to leave this place.</p><p>“Murong, you have to hurry!”</p><p>Ye Chen could feel that he would not last for long.</p><p>…</p><p>At Murong Qingcheng’s cultivation site…</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>Bursts of powerful demonic power ripples spread out. The source of these ripples, Murong Qingcheng’s body, glistened one moment, then dried in the next moment. Intense white fog was being spouted from her forehead while her face had completely dried. Her lips had already cracked at numerous spots of dead skin. Her glossy black hair had slowly turned into a withered yellow, without a trace of luster.</p><p>However, at this moment, a vast demonic power ripple spread out. The summit in which the cave was located shook with loud rumbles as dazzling black radiance cracked out of the summit and spread out. The entire summit looked like a hedgehog, and black rays like swords.</p><p>“Ha!”</p><p>Followed by a long muffled shout piercing through the sky, Murong Qingcheng abruptly opened her eyes. They were immeasurably deep and frighteningly sharp, the long hair on her head dancing like black flames.</p><p>Gush!</p><p>The white fog spread out unfettered as she opened her arms wide and her body bent like a bow. With her body as center, the water Qi inside the atmosphere converged and entered her body, replenishing her withered body.</p><p>Her hair turned black and glossy at a speed observable with naked eyes, also carrying a faint black glow. The skin of her face turned white and tender again, without a trace of blemish. Like a chick poking its head out of an egg, her dead skin at the lips shed off, revealing the moist and supple skin underneath.</p><p>“She has broken through! We can’t waste any time. Kill him with everything.” Black Scales had a bad premonition and roared.</p><p>At the same time, he sent Zhen Yuan transmission to his five hundred clansmen to intercept Murong Qingcheng and keep her away from destroying the array.</p><p>Inside the array, the frequency of attacks had become increasingly higher, and Ye Chen’s vision had long since turned indistinct. If not for the pseudo extreme grade armor, Dragon God Medal, and half-supreme grade Zhen Yuan restoring pills, he would have been dead long ago.</p><p>In reality, although Ye Chen’s strength was inferior to ‘strongest’ half-step Kings, in terms of survivability, he was way above them. They were superior to him in terms of Zhen Yuan and offense, but might not in terms of skill, defense, and reactions.</p><p>This was the biggest reason Ye Chen could survive to this moment.</p><p>The frequency of chains suddenly exploded, increasing the pressure on him by ten times.</p><p>Peng Peng Peng!</p><p>White Nightmare and the rest couldn’t understand. Ye Chen had used a space profound sword art. This sword art was full of mistakes and wasn’t merged with space profound. How powerful could it have been? However, the space profound contained in this sword art could actually reverse the trajectory of the chains upon contact. It seemed like a stone pushing away a huge rock.</p><p>“How is this kid so troublesome?” Duo Long almost cursed.</p><p>“Die for me!”</p><p>The six poured their Zhen Yuan like water, increasing the speed of attacks by two folds once again, frantically assaulting Ye Chen with everything they had.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>Ye Chen’s space profound sword art had not been perfected and couldn’t keep himself safe from such a berserk assault. Hence, he was struck by the chains several times. His Protective Zhen Yuan, which was amplified by bronze armor, dimmed and tyrannous energies pierced through his Zhen Yuan, hitting his body. Despite these energies being weakened, Ye Chen spurted out a huge mouthful of blood.</p><p>It was at this moment Murong Qinghcheng finally grasped the demonic power inside her body. She turned her head and saw six half-step Demonic Human Kings maintaining a formation. Inside of the formation was a pitch-darkness of black mist. There was no need to see anything; as long as one wasn’t an idiot, they could guess that inside this formation was Ye Chen.</p><p>“Stop her!”</p><p>The five hundred Sea of Soul realm demonic humans intercepted Murong Qingcheng’s path. They all wore gloves which were flickering with varying colors. As long as they were ordered, they would instantly launch an assault.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng coldly laughed and a pair of huge wings spawned behind her back. On the wings, black Qi danced like frantic black flames. With a flap of wings, her body disappeared, reappearing behind the five hundred demonic humans.</p><p>“So fast!”</p><p>The five hundred demonic humans stood agape. This kind was speed was completely out of their reach. A perfect Half-Step Demonic King was too frightening, especially if one had speed as their innate ability.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
