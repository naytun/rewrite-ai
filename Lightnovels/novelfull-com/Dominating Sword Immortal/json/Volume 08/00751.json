As soon as she appeared, the berserk Qi in the plaza immediately calmed down like a mouse running into a cat, unable to move. Her eyes were like stars and dense black hair like a waterfall. Although her expression was dull—neither cheerful nor angry—it emitted a feeling of looking down on the world. Before her, the numerous Life and Death Kings all lost their splendor.</p><p>The Mysterious Queen, Yan Qingxuan, had arrived.</p><p>Ye Chen sucked in a deep breath. Every time he saw the Mysterious Queen, he had a different feeling. When he saw her for the first time, she was like an ordinary woman, feeding fish by the pond. There was no special aura on her body. However, when he saw her at this moment, he returned to the time when he first saw her portrait. The Mysterious Queen of the portrait also exuded this exact same feeling—majestic, peerless, and disdaining the world.</p><p>“Destruction King, you wish to take Ye Chen to the Gu Clan to apologize?” Walking out of the spatial gate, the Mysterious Queen looked at the Destruction King.</p><p>Destruction King’s face contorted and he smiled stiffly, “My Gu Clan’s half step King can’t die in vain. Of course, my Gu Clan will leave face for you and Dragon King. We’ll only make him apologize and not make things hard for him.”</p><p>If not for the Mysterious Queen and Dragon King, Destruction King would have long since killed Ye Chen with a punch. Making him apologize was already leaving plenty of face for Ye Chen.</p><p>“If he died, it meant his skill was not good enough. So, if you can take my finger without getting injured, I’ll no longer concern with Ye Chen’s matter. What do you think?” Mysterious Queen said.</p><p>“One finger?”</p><p>Destruction King’s face showed hesitation. Had it been another King, not to mention one finger, he wouldn’t have feared to exchange even hundreds of moves. However, the Mysterious Queen was too strong. Even one finger from her was not something ordinary Kings could resist.</p><p>“What, you don’t dare? Then don’t mention this matter again.” Mysterious Queen coldly snorted.</p><p>“It’s just one finger…I don’t believe you can harm me with one finger.”</p><p>The Destruction King had his own pride. His cultivation base was at six hundred years, and Mysterious Queen’s cultivation base was at most worth a thousand years. Most importantly, he was wearing an extreme grade armor and glove. He believed that if he gave it his all, he could resist Mysterious Queen’s finger.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>Destruction King’s external body glowed with reddish yellow radiance. This radiance was like silk, weaving into a cocoon and protecting him inside. At the same time, his body slightly leaned down. His right fist tightly clenched and Zhen Yuan condensed halos covered his entire wrist. These halos contained the extremely tyrannical Destruction profound. Each of these halos could obliterate a small mountain range.</p><p>“Come!” The Destruction King growled as his two eyes lit up like torches.</p><p>“Seems like you’ve prepared well!” The Mysterious Queen raised her right hand and pointed her index finger. With a puff, a wisp of transparent flame appeared. As soon as this transparent flame appeared, the entire plaza’s temperature dropped by more than a hundred times. Frost appeared throughout the entire plaza; only the statue of Four Extreme Emperor remained unaffected.</p><p>“The realm of frost profound is actually no inferior to mine.”</p><p>At that moment, the Ice Pavilion’s master had also arrived. He was a white-haired old man; at this moment, his face was completely astonished. Mysterious Queen’s principal profound was not frost profound. In fact, in the past, she had rarely been seen to use frost profound. Clearly, frost profound was only one of her secondary profounds.</p><p>“Take my move!”</p><p>She pointed toward the Destruction King and the transparent flame turned into a light ray, radiating out at a speed hard to perceive below Life and Death realm.</p><p>“Using frost profound to deal with me?”</p><p>Destruction King was delighted and fiercely struck out with his gloved right hand. The Zhen Yuan halos condensed on his wrist immediately joined the fist energy and burst forth.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>A cloud of ice crystals blossomed into the void. The Destruction King’s fist energy that could obliterate an entire mountain range was completely frozen by the ice cloud and immediately stopped. After freezing the fist energy, the ice cloud suddenly emitted a transparent halo.</p><p>Destruction King’s right arm was instantly frozen by the transparent halo.</p><p>“What!”</p><p>With his face filled with alarm, his left hand assumed a blade shape and chopped at his right shoulder.</p><p>Kacha! The right arm was severed from the shoulder, falling on the ground. Not only did it not shatter, it further froze the surface of the plaza, thickening the ice layer to several meters.</p><p>“How is this possible! Frost profound has also attained greater success?”</p><p>The Ice Pavilion Master, Ice King, sucked in a breath of cold air. He primarily cultivated precisely the frost profound and had currently attained greater success realm as well. However, it was a secondary profound to Mysterious Queen, but it had actually attained greater success too. It should be known that the higher one went, the more difficult the profound became. Several hundred years without a trace of progress was quite normal, and every bit of improvement signified a huge improvement in battle strength.</p><p>“This is such a blow! Even secondary profound is cultivated to greater success.” Moon Queen laughed bitterly. She was not moved because of greater success of frost profound, but since even her secondary profound had been cultivated to greater success, her primary profound might as well be perfected.</p><p>Of course, there were disparities among perfected profounds as well. Profounds that weren’t easy to comprehend were much stronger than those that were easy. One expert with a harder to cultivate profound could instantly kill other who had cultivated an easy profound, if all other aspects were the same for both of them. This was the disparity.</p><p>However, in any case, to perfect a profound was an extremely astonishing matter in itself.</p><p>“Worthy of being Mysterious Queen…Just a casual move contains such a might.”</p><p>Shua!</p><p>A sphere of light suddenly appeared beside the Destruction King and rapidly enlarged. When it had reached several meters, a figure walked out from within.</p><p>“East King!” The Mysterious Queen turned her head.</p><p>This was an elegant-looking middle-aged man in a scholarly outfit. His eyebrows were unusually long and narrow, and his eyes were red phoenix eyes. He flicked his sleeve, and the ice on the ground melted in every direction, clearing up the land.</p><p>“It’s the East King.”</p><p>“Didn’t expect him to come as well.”</p><p>“That’s not surprising. Four Extreme Emperor’s grave has appeared. With his strength, how could he not try his hand?”</p><p>East King held a lot of weight in the eyes of numerous Kings. After all, there were only so many emperors in the True Spirit Continent and four Shallow Oceans combined; peak Kings could also be counted on two hands. Hence, the East King could be considered a powerful figure among the kings.</p><p>“Are you alright?” East King looked at the armless Destruction King.</p><p>“I’ll be alright.”</p><p>Although he said so, the Destruction King was terrified inwardly. If he had not decisively chopped off his arm, that frost Qi might have extended to his whole body. If that happened, even if he didn’t die, he would have become half dead.</p><p>Cicici!</p><p>Working his Immortal Body, Destruction King’s missing arm rapidly grew. However, he lost a small chunk of his Zhen Yuan, which would take quite a while to recover.</p><p>“East King, you also wish to exchange a few moves with me?” Mysterious Queen flicked her sleeve and said.</p><p>East King smiled faintly, “There will be many opportunities later.”</p><p>East King didn’t have any confidence in exchanging moves with Mysterious Queen, and it was not necessary either. Any exchange within Life and Death realm must be meaningful. Otherwise, Kings rarely exchanged moves.</p><p>“Ye Chen, you’re pretty good. That Bronze Armor will stay with you for the time being.”</p><p>East King glanced in Ye Chen’s direction, which evoked endless illusions for the latter. It seemed as if the entire world had left him, and he had entered the primal chaos. East King’s gaze directly entered his Sea of Soul without a trace of emotion.</p><p>“If Senior East King says so, Ye Chen can only comply.”</p><p>Ye Chen was astounded inwardly. Just now, the entire world had disappeared, leaving behind only East King’s gaze at him.</p><p>“Life and Death King have a grasp over some mysteries of soul. Even if one has a fifth level martial soul or sword soul, the might brought by a Life and Death King is just incomparable. And this East King’s martial will is almost at the peak sixth step!” Mysterious Queen coldly snorted, not saying anything. Suddenly, she raised her head and looked into the depths of void. From there, an unimaginably strong aura was flying over.</p><p>This aura was already so powerful, but another aura came that didn’t pale before the former at all, giving off a feeling as if the entire void was being squeezed. Even before the masters of the aura arrived, their grandeur overshadowed the heaven and earth.</p><p>Two auras clashed in the air, causing the people to turn silent, not daring to utter a word.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
