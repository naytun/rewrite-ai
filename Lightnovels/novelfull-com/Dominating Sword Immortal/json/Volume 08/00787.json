The two sword artists were rare experts; as soon as they began, only sword light and sword images could be seen, completely shrouding their figures. Even the others surrounding them spread apart. Sword artists were synonymous with offensive power. If one encountered a sword artist of similar strength, one would certainly lose in aura. A life and death battle of two sword artists was a frightening scene.</p><p>“My old bones…”</p><p>The experienced-looking old man’s figure floated, stopping before the strange old man in a raincoat. Seeing his opponent being an old man like himself, the latter curled his mouth and said strangely, “I hate fighting old fellows. The older you are, the smellier you become. Change…I ask for a change.”</p><p>“I’m afraid that your wish can’t be fulfilled.” The experienced old man chuckled, and a black-colored short staff appeared in his hand.</p><p>“Damn!”</p><p>The old man in the raincoat avoided the staff with a skid. As he was dodging, a light rain suddenly fell down from the sky on his raincoat, sliding down and making him look like a ghost in the rain, exceptionally agile and eerie.</p><p>“This old coot is rather troublesome.” The experienced old man creased his brows as he brawled with the former.</p><p>The yellow-faced middle-aged man was heading toward the young woman, but was blocked by the bald fatty midway. As a result, his face turned purple with anger. Holding a shield in one hand and a spear in the other, he fiercely charged forward as if he had a lifelong enmity with the latter.</p><p>As for the two brothers, they were a little dishonorable. They didn’t separate, and instead, both faced off against a masked man. The elder brother’s huge axe seemed capable of toppling mountains while the younger one’s dual blades seemed able to cleave through fire and water. Under the flawless combined assault of the two, the masked man was suffering greatly, incessantly muttering something under his breath.</p><p>Of the remaining three, the yellow-robed woman casually found an opponent and began fighting, revealing no skills. Murong Qingcheng’s opponent was the young woman that yellow-faced middle-aged man was looking for.</p><p>Ultimately, Ye Chen was the only one left.</p><p>“Seems like we’re the only two left.”</p><p>Across him, a thin middle-aged man with a figure of drying pole was advancing toward him while picking his ears. carrying an unsightly smile on his face.</p><p>“True!” Ye Chen faintly smiled.</p><p>“Then no need to waste any time. I’ll give you three moves…what do you think?” The frail man flicked the ear wax and smiled.</p><p>“No problem!”</p><p>Ye Chen advanced step by step with a warm smile on his face. The two seemed as if exchanging pointers instead of engaged in a life and death battle.</p><p>Rip!</p><p>Suddenly, Ye Chen stepped out. Instantly unsheathing the Thunder Disaster Sword, he slashed violently. The extreme speed caused the air itself to tremble. The opponent also didn’t seem to be able to react, and his figure swayed.</p><p>One would have sheathed their swords back at this point, since the opponent was already dead. However, Ye Chen merely revealed a cold smile and suddenly turned around, thrusting out.</p><p>Dang!</p><p>Amidst a cold gleam of an exchange, a figure shot back.</p><p>The frail middle-aged man behind Ye Chen was merely a doppelganger. However, this doppelganger was complete in every aspect. Neither one could see anything amiss, nor feel anything by a soul power scan. Moreover, at such a crucial moment, who would have the time to go through every detail. One would only think of slaughtering their opponents. Who could have expected that middle-aged man had made preparations so long ago? It seemed that even before the two sides had begun, he had hidden his true body in a corner, preparing to mount a sneak attack.</p><p>Unfortunately, his opponent turned out to be Ye Chen. Who was Ye Chen? He was a man with five times the soul power of others. Adding his innate prudency, it had always been him mounting sneak attacks, and very rarely had others succeeded in sneaking attacks on him. As far as he was concerned, all the preparations the frail middle-aged man had made were merely like watching a play for him. And there was no harm in accompanying the latter in his play for a moment.</p><p>Ye Chen’s reverse strike stunned the frail middle-aged man. The number of people who died due to this method were simply too many. He was not clear of the count anymore. Apart from those whose strength was too high and couldn’t be assassinated in one strike, Ye Chen was the first to see through his move with his peak Sea of Soul realm cultivation base. How could he not be stunned? His entire body seemed thunderstruck.</p><p>“What happened? Didn’t you give me three moves?” Ye Chen looked at him with mocking eyes.</p><p>The frail middle-aged man restrained his astonishment and smiled, “My words were only for my doppleganger to take three moves. I never said a word about my true body. Seems like you didn’t hear correctly, eh?”</p><p>“Is that so? Never mind…How about I give you three moves?”</p><p>The frail middle-aged man was somewhat dazed. However, thinking of Ye Chen’s shrewdness he shook his head, “No thanks! I’m afraid I’ll be scammed by you. To tell you the truth, I’ve never seen someone of your age being so cunning like an old fox.”</p><p>“Hehe, you sure jest! But, words are supplement for skill!”</p><p>Ye Chen suddenly attacked. The Thunder Disaster Sword slashed a transparent arc in the void, with its tip heading straight at frail middle-aged man’s forehead. Before the sword reached, the sword Qi had already locked onto the opponent, rendering all the tricks and deception that latter had completely useless.</p><p>“Found a tough nut!”</p><p>The frail middle-aged man cursed his bad luck and waved his skinny palm in the air repeatedly. Numerous silver colored ghost claws shot out, surrounding Ye Chen.</p><p>Clang Clang Clang Clang!</p><p>The two exchanged blows at an extremely high pace with nobody gaining the upper hand. The frail middle-aged man’s strength indeed didn’t let Ye Chen look down on him. He was sure that apart from a few, all the people present had similar strengths. If they wished to prevail over their opponents, they must pay a certain price. Ye Chen also didn’t dare to claim that he could easily prevail over the frail middle-aged man. This was because neither of the sides had revealed their killer moves, and were merely grasping a feel of their opponent.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>Ten battles suddenly abrupted in the palace—Jin Wanshuang against Shi Shaobao, the cold-faced youngster against the middle-aged scholar, Lin Yuxuan against the white-faced youngster, the middle-aged woman against the other middle-aged woman, the old man against the other old man, the two brothers against the masked man, the yellow-robed woman against the bushy bearded huge man, Murong Qingcheng against the young woman, and Ye Chen against the frail, middle-aged man.</p><p>Each of the ten battles were separate, occupying their own areas.</p><p>The entire palace had turned into a battlefield, but the spirit stones in the central region didn’t explode. Fortunately, they were protected by an array. Otherwise, the flying energies would have been enough to utterly destroy the five hundred million upper grade spirit stones.</p><p>In addition, the palace itself was protected by a restriction. Regardless of how big a commotion they caused, it didn’t shake the palace. Each attack heading the way of the palace walls would be scattered by a flash of light, not affecting the palace in the slightest.</p><p>The battle was too bitter. Everybody was fighting with all their might, which was different from their usual battles. Who amongst them was not deeply hidden? Each of them was a rare powerhouse under the Life and Death realm, with countless tricks and aces up their sleeves.</p><p>Of course, the most eye-catching battle was naturally between Jin Wanshuang and Shi Shabao. The two were respective leaders of their parties, and had peak strength among their parties. At this moment, they were no longer holding back, and using all their techniques at their opponents.</p><p>“Lion King Claw!” Shi Shaobao roared as his right hand transformed into a huge lion claw and suddenly struck forth. The shockwaves it set off caused the space itself to warp.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Jin Wanshuang extended his palm and suddenly clenched it into a fist, giving off a silver glow as if it was made of silver itself. However, one shouldn’t confuse it with silver, because it was much stronger than silver by countless folds. Even diamond was no comparison. Amidst a loud sound, he punched the claw while sending a kick at Shi Shaobao’s head.</p><p>“Courting death!”</p><p>The latter extended his left hand and grabbed Jin Wanshuang’s leg. Catching the leg, he exerted his left arm and raised the latter’s body into the air, violently whirling it. If it had been an ordinary person, they would have lost all power amidst the dizziness and would have no chance of a counterattack. However, Jin Wanshuang was no ordinary person. He seemed completely unaffected by the whirling and repeatedly punched out, battering Shi Shaoboa’s Protective Zhen Yuan and causing his blood Qi to soar.</p><p>“Get lost!” Shi Shaobao roared and pushed Jin Wanshuang. With a peng sound, the latter’s legs touched the palace wall and bounced back, again attacking Shi Shaobao,</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Shi Shabao couldn’t endure such an assault, and eventually turned into his true form. The air suddenly warped, and a dozen meters tall huge golden tiger appeared. This golden lion had four pillar-like legs, sharp claws, and a golden mane draped over its rear head, glowing with a luminous golden light that was comparable to Jin Wanshuang’s silver glow.</p><p>One gold, one silver…</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Shi Shaobao again roared and leaped at Jin Wanshuang. Its huge body allowed it to cover countless steps of others in one leap. With but a flicker, he appeared above Jin Wangshuang and fiercely stamped down.</p><p>“Dream on!” Jin Wanshuang folded his arms together above his head, blocking Shi Shaobao.</p><p>Creak…</p><p>The two were stuck in a deadlock.</p><p>Transforming into his true body, Shi Shaobao was becoming increasingly violent. How could he endure such a situation? The lion’s head dived down, biting at Jin Wanshuang’s head. If the latter were bitten, his body would certainly be divided into two parts.</p><p>However, Jin Wanshuang was not one who had only so much skill. His eyes turned into bright gems as his hair stood erect like a silver hedgehog. Pushing off, his left hand clenched into a fist and punched at Shi Shaobao’s huge tooth, creating a loud sonorous sound.</p><p>Shi Shaobao was forced back, and a small crack appeared on his tooth. He flew out in rage out of humiliation; this was his first loss.</p><p>Apart from Shi Shaobao and Jin Wanshuang, although the other battles were not as eye-catching, they were equally bitter and deadly.</p><p>The cold-faced youngster and middle-aged scholar had already exchanged over hundreds of moves, and both had suffered small losses. After all, in a battle of sword artists, both sides looked for gaps and exchanged blows at a lightning fast speed. The slightest gap would result in getting hit.</p><p>The cold-faced youngster’s shoulder was pierced by a sword and chest had a bloody scar. Meanwhile, the middle-aged man’s tidy hair were in complete disarray, and his belly and leg were slashed. The two were equally matched; it seemed like neither of the two could see through the other at the moment. Thus, it was too early to comment on the victor.</p><p>In a battle of similar levels, a victor would only emerge late in the battle. This was because only then would small advantages and disadvantages become increasingly bigger, growing to an extent that they could no longer be ignored.</p><p>As time passed, some began to gain the upper hand over their opponents.</p><p>The first one to fall into a disadvantage was the yellow-faced big man, whose opponent was the tattooed bald fatty. This fatty was extremely troublesome. The Zhen Yuan he cultivated was extremely greasy like his fat. The yellow-faced man’s spear could not exert power due to the softness of his flesh. The more they exchanged blows, the more the yellow-faced man lost power. Numerous bloody scars appeared on his body. He was under so much pressure that he could not even lift his head.</p><p>“Hehe…You don’t need to be ashamed of dying by my hands.”</p><p>The bald fatty clearly seemed like a fish in water. From the beginning, he had never used his full power. He was incessantly swatting his two leaf-fan sized meaty palms, letting out a dense vibration power. The yellow-faced middle-aged man was precisely suffering from this vibration power. After every exchange, he could feel minute injuries appearing in his body. After several times, these minute injuries had accumulated to a frightening amount.</p><p>“Courting death!”</p><p>The yellow-faced man suddenly threw the shield at the fatty’s face, obstructing his vision. Grasping the opportunity, he leaped up, his figure turning into three figures which simultaneously attacked the bald fatty.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Who could have expected that bald fatty’s movement techniques were ten times superior than the yellow-faced man had expected! Such movement techniques…not to mention a fatty, even a person as light as a feather might not be able to exhibit with such grace. It turned out that even a fatty could give a graceful feeling.</p><p>With a flicker, the bald fatty evaded the shield and suddenly appeared underneath the yellow-faced man. His eyes narrowed into slits as he pushed both hands up.</p><p>The yellow-faced man’s figure turning into three was merely aimed to confuse the opponent. The bald fatty was unable to immediately figure out the real one. Thus, he sent two palm strikes, hitting two amongst the three. His chances of success were more than half. If he failed, it could only be said that yellow-faced man’s luck was too good.</p><p>However, the latter’s luck was indeed not that good, as one of the figures hit was his real body.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>The bald fatty’s meaty, puffy fist carried a strong and bizarre vibrational power. The yellow-faced man was flung high into the air after being hit in the groin, his lower portion turning into mincemeat. Under the strong pressure, blood didn’t come from his mouth, but from the top of his head. His skull suddenly exploded and his body turned into a wisps of blood fog.</p><p>At this point, Ye Chen’s group had lost a person.</p><p>However, at the same moment, the battle between the two middle-aged women also concluded. The one to die was the middle-aged woman from Ye Chen’s side.</p><p>“Drifting in the martial world for so many years, this is the first time I’ve come across a woman viler than me. My death is not unjustified.” She stood straight, but a silver needle was piercing her back. However, the mortal injuries actually came from the two silver needles at the soles of her feet. The other middle-aged woman was placing silver needles on the ground while battling, awaiting her opponent to step on them. Originally, such a small trick couldn’t be hidden from her. But, the needles that struck her were actually refined by her opponent inside her body and planted on the floor by her own feet.</p><p>Therefore, she didn’t lose a battle of strength, but that of insidious tricks. She didn’t expect her opponent to have such an absurd trick.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Ye Chen’s side had lost two people. In terms of number, Shi Shaobao’s side had gained the upper hand.</p><p>Originally, there was not much difference between the strengths of the two sides. But, Ye Chen’s turned out to be a little weaker. Losing two people at once was a disaster. It was like the tug of war. As soon as a side exerted slightly more strength, it would turn into an overwhelming victory.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
