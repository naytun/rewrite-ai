Instead, they took out their secret arts, exploding with speed. Of course, nobody dared to go near the big fireflies. Even if they couldn’t avoid them, they tried to shoot them down from a distance.</p><p>As time passed, they realized the terror of Detonating Fireflies more and more deeply.</p><p>Ordinary attacks were completely useless against these creatures. Outside their bodies seemed to be an invisible membrane that could neutralize energies. Only exceedingly condense moves could strike the fireflies and make them explode. On the other hand, these fireflies could disregard their Protective Zhen Yuan to some extent. If not for the shields they were holding, they would have long been disfigured.</p><p>“Dark Force Field!”</p><p>Dozens of huge cyan fireflies were flying toward Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng, and the ordinary fireflies numbered in thousands. Their speed was extremely high, almost the same as them. Murong Qingcheng’s face turned grave. Dark lightning flickered around her body, following which, a warped Force field radiated out and covered all the fireflies in the surroundings.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>All the fireflies nearing the force field were bounced back, incapable of entering.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng had grasped the Demonic Force field when she merely had a cultivation base of Clasping Yuan realm. The Demonic Force field was naturally left behind as Murong Qingcheng had created the Dark Force field by relying on her demonic attributes and dark profound. The latter was simply an existence of a higher level. It was like comparing the magnetic field of a human and a star; there was simply no comparison.</p><p>With the protection of the Dark Force field, Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng suddenly turned a lot relaxed.</p><p>“Didn’t expect that the Force field would turn out to be so useful at this moment.” Ye Chen sighed.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng’s force field had not reached a high enough level, so it wouldn’t be of much use in dealing with a half-step King of the same level. However, it was more than enough to deal with the fireflies. This was the principal of rock against scissors, and scissors against paper.</p><p>Murong Qincheng said, “I wasn’t clear enough about the characteristics of Detonating Fireflies. That’s why I waited until now to try. The result is much better than I expected.”</p><p>Ye Chen smiled, “With the Dark Force Field, we can move through this place at will.”</p><p>The sudden quiet at their side naturally attracted others’ suspicions, and eight to nine soul powers immediately swept by them.</p><p>“Eh!” The middle-aged woman’s eyes shone and her eyes turned ecstatic.</p><p>Amongst everybody, she was in the most precarious situation. The unceasing explosions had already inflicted substantial injuries in her body. If not for her profound cultivation base as well as several secret arts that allowed her to lock her injuries and prevent them from getting worse, she would have been crushed to bones. Despite so, she had almost despaired. This small pathway seemed without an end, and in the same way, these fireflies also seemed endless.</p><p>If this continued for a little longer, her body would explode apart sooner or later.</p><p>At this moment, as she saw that Murong Qingcheng had a secret art to restrain the fireflies, so how could she not feel ecstatic? Not being able to endure a second later, she frantically made her way toward Murong Qingcheng with her shields raised, hoping to seek shelter behind the latter and leave this damned place.</p><p>Not just the middle-aged woman, the others were also approaching Murong Qingcheng. Although there were many among them who were confident in crossing the pathway on their own, it would undoubtedly cost a lot. Now that a shelter had appeared, who would be foolish enough to not accept it?</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>The middle-aged woman arrived, but the force field actually pushed her back. In normal times, she would have cut the force field open, but this force field was her hope at this moment.</p><p>“You!” Her face turned sullen and indignant.</p><p>“Madam, we’re one group at this moment. We have to help each other. If you agree, I can speak on behalf of others that if we find any treasures, you’ll have the first chance to choose. Moreover, you’ll have ten percent more than others. What do you think? Does anybody have any objections?” Jin Wanshuang had ample experience. He knew that a falling out at this moment would not benefit anybody. Moreover, before they came here, he never expected that they would have to take shelter behind one person. Being one group was fine and all, but if one person was sheltering everybody else, it was a completely different story.</p><p>Saying these words, Jin Wanshuang turned his head toward the other people. He believed that everybody would make the right choice.</p><p>“Ten percent is fine, but only for the first time.” The two brothers faintly nodded then shook their heads.</p><p>“Alright, I’ve no objections.”</p><p>“Same.”</p><p>Everybody agreed. Who knew how long the pathway was? They didn’t dare take their lives lightly.</p><p>“Let them in!” Ye Chen said to Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng nodded and opened a small hole in the field, allowing everybody to enter.</p><p>Blob!</p><p>As everybody entered, the fireflies came swooping in following the blood Qi. However, by that time, the force field had already closed, making them bounce back in every direction, creating a scene of utter chaos. Maintaining the force field, Murong Qingcheng led everybody forward.</p><p>In reality, the reason she was opposed to let the middle-aged woman in was not to gain some benefits; it was rather a matter of principle. One could come in just because one wanted to? Then what was she worth? At this point, one could not take a single step back. If one didn’t hold one’s ground, others would try to take a mile for an inch, considering it a fair game. Although they wouldn’t ask for something too impossible, it was still a problem.</p><p>The reason Ye Chen didn’t stop her was because he knew what she was thinking. Once everybody showed their stances, he immediately asked her to open the force field.</p><p>The length of the pathway was beyond their imagination. Even after flying for a cup of tea worth of time, there seemed to be no end to it. At this point, any ill will they carried had dissipated. Giving ten percent more treasures didn’t cause them any loss; instead, they had profited here. The pathway was so lengthy that none among them would have been able to make it out without paying some price, and this price might even turn out to be their lives for a few. Moreover, there was still no end in sight. Who knew how long they would have to continue for!</p><p>Jin Wanshuang was apparently thinking the same as he faintly smiled toward Murong Qingcheng, “Many thanks!”</p><p>The latter gave a faint nod in response.</p><p>After another pot of tea’s worth of time, the group eventually arrived at the end. Each of them deeply exhaled, venting their frustrations.</p><p>Thud!</p><p>At the pathway’s end, everybody descended.</p><p>They turned around and saw the fireflies flying about in utter chaos like houseflies. It seemed they could no longer sense any blood Qi. A few moments later, all the fireflies scattered, disappearing back into the forest.</p><p>“It’s finally over!” Jin Wanshuang chuckled.</p><p>“This force field is quite peculiar, probably an application of profound, isn’t it?” The yellow-robed woman sized Murong Qingcheng with interest.</p><p>“Same goes for you, doesn’t it?” Murong Qingcheng said a thought provoking line.</p><p>The yellow-robed woman stared blankly for a moment before revealing an astounded expression. She then spoke no more and retreated to the side.</p><p>“This woman is really hard to see through.” Ye Chen said.</p><p>The two had already noticed her. When everybody else was fending off the fireflies with panic, the fireflies surrounding her were negligible. Coupled with the words she spoke before about suppressing blood Qi, it was not hard to make some inferences. Of course, the two didn’t believe that the others were stupid. They must have noticed the yellow-robed woman’s peculiarity as well. They merely chose not to mention it.</p><p>Leaving the extremely dangerous pathway behind, a dazzling golden palace greeted their eyes. The palace gates were firmly closed, giving of a mighty pressure.</p><p>“Open!”</p><p>Seeing that the palace was not covered in any restrictive formations, Jin Wanshuang swatted at the door.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The palace gates, which hadn’t been opened in numerous years, opened with a creak. It seemed like a gate of past opening for the group. Each of them held their breaths and stared unblinkingly at the slowly unfolding palace, afraid to miss that moment of wonder.</p><p>The palace gates finally opened, and a spirit Qi beam abruptly shot out of the entrance. Nobody anticipated this transformation, and were all hit amidst the dodging. However, nobody suffered any injury. On the contrary, they felt their body and mind clearing. This spirit Qi beam didn’t have any offensive attribute. As soon as it made contact with their bodies, a large portion of it was absorbed.</p><p>“This is spirit Qi produced by spirit stones.” The middle-aged woman exclaimed.</p><p>“How many spirit stones will be required to produce such a rich spirit Qi beam? The moment it touched by body, I felt as if a portion of the Zhen Yuan I just lost had recovered.” The two brothers muttered.</p><p>“Let’s check it out first.” Jin Wanshuang took a deep breath and stepped in the palace, the rest following behind him.</p><p>The palace was not too big, and everything was carved in gold and jade. Resplendent crystals lanterns hung from the ceiling, and the floor was made of highly expensive white jade bricks. At the center of the palace was portrayed a huge array. The array was circular, and had countless veined patterns at its center. What attracted everybody’s attention was not the array, but the spirit stones inside it.</p><p>It was a small mountain of spirit stones.</p><p>Every single one was an upper grade stone. Moreover, beside the mountain of spirit stones were seven-eight small chests. The chests were already opened, revealing all sorts of energy gems within: red, blue, green, black, yellow, pink, purple…any sort one could think of could be find.</p><p>“So many upper grade spirit stones…How many are there?”</p><p>“Seven to eight chests of energy gems as well….”</p><p>Everybody stood agape, unable to speak.</p><p>The experienced old man was the first to recover. He cleared his throat and said, “There are at least five hundred million upper grade stones, and seven chests of energy gems.”</p><p>“It’s all worth it, all worth it.” The yellow-faced big man had an ecstatic expression.</p><p>They had come for treasures, not caring much for upper grade spirit stones. But, when the quantity reached such a degree, no person would not be moved.</p><p>It should be known that even with their identity, twenty million upper grade spirit stones would be the height of wealth. And even that would be under the condition that they didn’t spend them on some expensive treasure. If they visited auctions a few times, their wealth would be reduced by several folds.</p><p>If five hundred million upper grade stones were divided among all of them equally, every one of them would get forty to fifty million upper grade stones, not to mention the gems.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
