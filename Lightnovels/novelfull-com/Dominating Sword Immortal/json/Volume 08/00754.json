There is only one south shallow alliance, made up of countless parties. Of course, it does not mean that the people here are more united, just that the threat from the deep seas is so frightening that they were forced to work together.”</p><p>Back when he first come to the north shallow sea, he had not even reached Sea of Souls realm and was being chased by the Ao family. But now, Ye Chen was already at Late Sea of Souls realm. Judging on power, he was even at the top Half step king warrior level. However, thinking back to that battle in the sea, he was still scared for his life. That time, it was not just a battle between powerful groups; it was between alliances! Especially the one he was involved in was only right in the beginning when the two sides were not as serious.</p><p>“Where are we going?”</p><p>Ye Chen did not mention what happened back then to Murong Qingcheng. Therefore, she did not know why they were there for.</p><p>“I had some relationship with the water ape family. Let’s go there first!”</p><p>It had been years, and he wondered what happened to Sun Xiaojin and Wang She.</p><p>…</p><p>Above that endless ocean, a flying puppet sliced through the sky.</p><p>“Down there is the water ape family.” Ye Chen was about to put away his flying puppet when his eyes suddenly squinted.</p><p>“Take this!”</p><p>Below them, the ocean water shot up into the sky. A silver colored iron stick became longer and longer before turning into a sky column wrapped with thunder and storm power. It attacked at Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng suddenly. Although she was also at the Half step king warrior level, she still was struggling a bit while facing this attack, feeling rather powerless.</p><p>“It is an old friend!”</p><p>Ye Chen smiled lightly and reached to take out his Thunder Disaster sword. As it was waved out, the sky suddenly dimmed down while the sword light was bright like sunshine.</p><p>Dang!</p><p>The stick and the sword clashed together. Ye Chen made a curious noise as he was pushed back for a couple of steps. Meanwhile, that aggressive blast wave spread out for hundreds of miles.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A beam of water column shot up into the sky, and inside was a playful looking ape holding a silver iron stick. His hands and legs were long and full of muscles. The long teeth sticking out of the upper lips which were extremely sharp, and his gold pupils gave people an aggressive threat.</p><p>“Brother Sun, you are giving me such a big present already!” Ye Chen stopped his body from backing out and chuckled.</p><p>That ape was indeed Sun Xiaojin who right now had a body full of silver black hair. He seemed a bit skinner, but more powerful and aggressive. That pressure coming out of him was at least ten times more brutal than before.</p><p>“Ape beast?” Murong Qingcheng realized what she was seeing.</p><p>Ye Chen introduced the two, “Murong, this is Sun Xiaojin from the water ape family. He had saved my life back then. Brother Sun, this is my girlfriend. Her name is Murong Qingcheng.”</p><p>After knowing each other, Sun Xiaojin started to study Ye Chen. Those gold pupils of his scanned up and down, “Brother Ye, you are now at Late Sea of Souls realm?”</p><p>“Indeed!”</p><p>Sun Xiaojin continued to say, “I am already at Half step beast king. And that unexpected attack could only push you back a couple of steps?”</p><p>Ever since that battle before, Sun Xiaojin had been through hundreds of thousands of battles, and his cultivation had increased drastically. He was already a Half step beast king one year ago, and that bloodline inside his body had been activated for the most part, which caused his hair to turn silver black from pure black, and his pupil from red to gold. His battling power was even higher than normal Half step beast kings.</p><p>When Ye Chen had just arrived in the family, Sun Xiaojin knew about it. He wanted to test exactly how powerful Ye Chen was now, which was why he attacked before.</p><p>However, what shocked him was that even though he had made great progress in making breakthroughs, Ye Chen’s achievement was no less than his at all. Facing his attack, he had only taken half a step backward while looking like nothing had happened.</p><p>“Although I am not that surprised, there are not that many Half step king warriors who can make me take a couple of steps back. Brother Sun is definitely one of them.” Ye Chen was very impressed by Sun Xiaojin’s potential. Although Yan Fengfeng had top of the top talent, which meant she was slightly more powerful than him, her battling power might not be as powerful as his at the same cultivation. It was not that the blue Phoenix was not as powerful, just that the apes were born to kill.</p><p>“You are the guest here today, so I will not play fight you. After today, we will have to battle once.” If it were other people, Sun Xiaojin would not care for battles with them at all. But it was Ye Chen, so his battle intent had never been this excited. For him, battling Ye Chen would mean more than winning against hundreds of Half step king warriors.</p><p>“Haha.” Ye Chen chuckled, as he did not mind his straightforward personality.</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the water ape family…</p><p>The leader of the family, Sun Tai, laughed, “Ye Chen, I have indeed not read you wrong.” He had seen what had happened outside. On a serious note, he knew that Sun Xiaojin and Ye Chen were both at the same level, but their cultivation was one whole realm apart.</p><p>“Senior Sun, you are flattering me!” Ye Chen greeted with his fists.</p><p>“I doubt you are here to visit us today, are you?” Sun Tai ordered his people to serve some tea and fruit.</p><p>Ye Chen said, “I have pissed of some king warriors, so I have to avoid the land for a while and explore around. This time, one reason was that I wanted to see how you guys have been doing after all these years, and I wanted to visit Wang She and Wang Mei as well. I will leave in one or two days.”</p><p>Sun Tai nodded, “It is good that you are exploring around. The world outside is huge. It would be already quite impressive if you can travel even half of it.”</p><p>As they drank tea for a while, Wang She and Wang Mei also arrived.</p><p>“Brother Ye!”</p><p>“Brother Ye!”</p><p>Wang She and Wang Mei entered the lobby and saw Ye Chen immediately. A joyous expression appeared on Wang She’s face immediately as he walked over quickly.</p><p>Ye Chen stood up and tapped on his shoulder while laughing. “After all these years, you are already all grown up.” After all, Wang She was only a teenager when he left.</p><p>“Brother Ye, did you come to take us with you?”</p><p>Wang She was a bit excited. The people in the water ape family were nice to them, but what Ye Chen had done for them was something that they could never forget. He had been dreaming about traveling the world with Ye Chen.</p><p>Ye Chen shook his head and said, “No, perhaps in the future.”</p><p>The deep ocean was too dangerous, so it might not be good to have too many people with him.</p><p>“Ah okay!”</p><p>A disappointed expression flashed once in Wang She’s eyes. He then noticed Murong Qingchen who was standing right next to Ye Chen and asked. “Brother Ye, this is…?”</p><p>“She is Murong Qingcheng, my girlfriend.”</p><p>“Sister, greetings!” Wang She greeted her officially.</p><p>“Hello!” Murong Qingchen was a bit shy.</p><p>“Alright. After all these years, you guys are already at Sea of Souls realm. Let me see how much progress you guys have made.” Ye Chen wanted to test the two as well.</p><p>“Alright!” Wang She nodded immediately.</p><p>…</p><p>A group of water apes surrounded them on the empty place inside the water ape family.</p><p>In the yield, Ye Chen said to Wang She and Wang Mei, “You two attack together. I will fight with only early Sea of Souls realm power.”</p><p>The two’s cultivation was making a fast progress, especially for Wang She, who had even reached mid Sea of Souls realm. It, of course, had something to do with his bloodline, but it was still extremely impressive. However, even if he managed to increase his cultivation this quickly, his power might not grow as fast.</p><p>“Brother Ye, we will attack now!”</p><p>Wang She and Wang Mei knew how powerful Ye Chen was. They might have the nine head snake bloodline and normal Late Sea of Souls Realm warrior level, but still might not be able to fight against Ye Chen for sure. All they could do was to try and impress him.</p><p>Ye Chen nodded in response.</p><p>“Fire Snake Dance!”</p><p>“Wind Snake Whip Kill!”</p><p>Wang She had learned the fire profound; adding his nine-headed snake bloodline, his attack power was impressive. Meanwhile, Wang Mei trained the wind profound, which was working perfectly with Wang She’s.</p><p>Ye Chen shook his head, pointing out a finger at them. With that, the two massive Zhen yuan snakes were cut in halves.</p><p>“Bring everything you have got. Your understanding of the profound is still a bit shallow.”</p><p>With only early Sea of Souls Realm, that finger art could very likely like defeat the two of them. It would not be something that could impress him.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Wang She and Wang Mei started to get serious and their qi augmented immediately. Meanwhile, another two massive snake shadows appeared on their backs; one of them had eight heads while the other had seven, belonging to Wang She and Wang Mei respectively.</p><p>Sizz! Sizz! Sizz! Sizz!</p><p>The snakes were wrapped by burning flame and sharp winds respectively as all fifteen snakeheads attacked Ye Chen at the same time, which was confusing for everyone.</p><p>Ting! Ting! Ting! Ting! Ting!</p><p>Ye Chen flicked his fingers to blow away those snakeheads.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>All of a sudden, Wang She’s eight-headed snake grew out another, head and turned into a nine-headed shadow. They all combined together in a mysterious way as they attacked Ye Chen. In that second, it was like time had frozen. Those nine snakeheads were not as simple as just the names.</p><p>“Perfect Half step beast bloodline!”</p><p>Ye Chen made a surprised sound. He did not expect it, but Wang She had trained his nine-headed snake bloodline to perfection, which was just like Murong Qingcheng’s perfect demi demon bloodline.</p><p>“Shatter!”</p><p>Finger like ink, Ye Chen’s finger attack blew away the power field created by the nine snake heads.</p><p>“Brother Ye, we cannot win!” Wang She backed out dozens of steps as he said.</p><p>Ye Chen said, “You guys are doing quite alright. But, you guys pay too much attention to your bloodline and not spend enough time on comprehending the profound. Oh right! Wang She, I saw that you have already achieved the perfect nine-headed snake bloodline?”</p><p>“Brother Ye, I have cultivated three bloodline crystals and just stabilized the perfect nine-headed snake bloodline.”</p><p>Wang She and Wang Mei were proud of their power, thinking that they would not be too much of a burden for Ye Chen if they worked together. But judging from the reality, they were thinking too highly of themselves. Ye Chen had limited his power to early Sea of Souls Realm and used his finger instead of his sword. But, he could still beat them effortlessly, which meant that they were not even at the same cultivation level.</p><p>After studying Wang She and Wang Mei’s power, Sun Xiaojin could not help but want to try as well. Ye Chen could tell that there was this urge burning Sun Xiaojin from instead out. So, he suggested the empty ground outside the house.</p><p>Sun Xiaojin was already very powerful, definitely the top of the Half step beast king level. Even Ye Chen might not be able to win against him for sure. But, once he performed his Waning moon attack, Sun Xiaojin was blown away.</p><p>After spending one day inside the water ape family, the two left the house one the second noon.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
