Judging on battling power, although the bat king was indeed powerful, but it had still exceeded his expectation. It was just approaching demi king warrior’s level. However the bat king had way too many tricks and he was super fast as well. Even demi king warriors at the same cultivations could not beat him for sure. If this battle continued then he knew they would not last very long.</p><p>“Right now, the best plan would be to try to run away.”</p><p>The elder looked really serious.</p><p>“Wind elder, you go run ahead, I will follow behind.”</p><p>The teenager looked rather calm, it looked like he had a plan.</p><p>“Be careful.”</p><p>The elder was not that worried about the teenager, he was not just a normal warrior after all. Although his battling power was not as powerful as the bat king nor him, but his survival power would be way ahead of him for sure.</p><p>“I will.”</p><p>As they spoke, the symbol and pattern around the teenager started to spin, wrapping him up layer after layer.</p><p>“Wind Escape!”</p><p>Whoo!</p><p>The elder’s shadow disappeared in the wind as if they had formed into one with the wind and he was the wind itself.</p><p>Iron hand king saw that the elder had left, and the teenager stayed behind. A light flashed once in his eyes before turning into a beam of metal ray shooting out into the distance.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A massive sound was heard. The bat king could tell that the iron hand king’s intent, he then chased after him immediately, throwing out a claw attack onto the protective layer of iron hand king’s back.</p><p>Surprisingly, the iron hand king’s protective zhen yuan was very stable and it was not broken at all.</p><p>“You cannot kill me!”</p><p>Iron hand king swallowed a pellet before running away.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!…</p><p>After couple of explosions, iron hand king scrambled in the air. However, his protective zhen yuan was not shattered at all. If looked closer, it would not be hard to see that his protective zhen yuan was different from other people’s round shaped protective zhen yuan. It was more like a shield. This shield was indeed coming out from the defense shield of his.</p><p>“Defense weapon!”</p><p>The bat king could tell where the problem was.</p><p>“Nice.”</p><p>Iron hand king chuckled. The shield he was wearing was the only flawed defense weapon from the Gu family called Blue Yuan Shield. With it on them, as long as he still had his zhen yuan, it would be impossible for his defense to be broken through.</p><p>“Form Yuan Spell!’</p><p>The zhen yuan outside Iron hand king’s boy burned passionately as he continued to fly. It was not over it, the zhen yuan burning was something that Astral Reaching Realm warrior could do already, but the horrifyingly powerful part of the secret art was that it could burn separately layer by layer. With the first level being burned in normal speed, then the second level in thirty percent faster speed, he could increase the third layer by another thirty percent. And the forced generated by the heat increased his flying speed drastically. he shoot out into the distance as a beam of ray.</p><p>“Oh? You can escape like this as well I see. Ah well, let the marshland king to take care of you. I will watch the first realm then.”</p><p>It was not that the bat king could not catch up with him, it was just that he did not think it was necessary since there would be more and more people trying to go through him. All he needed to do was to wait.</p><p>“Why aren’t you running?”</p><p>The bat king asked the teenager who was wrapped around by strange symbols.</p><p>“You think I can run faster than you.”</p><p>The teenager said.</p><p>“True. So you are just going to give in?”</p><p>The bat king was not that into the teenager since his flesh and blood was not as good as those demi king warriors but he could still give him to his followers.</p><p>“No, I will trap you first before I leave. Thousand Symbol Spell!”</p><p>The teenager yelled and those symbols around him expended turning into a massive hallow ball. All those strings of twisted symbol wrapped around the ball and moved in a strict pattern. Countless twisted light pattern connected together.</p><p>After doing all of that, the teenager’s body sank, appearing outside of the ball and started flying towards where the elder had left.</p><p>“Huh!”</p><p>The bat king’s eyes were extremely cold. His body flashed once trying to chase after the teenager.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>All of the symbol around the hallow ball started to shine, bouncing the bat king right back.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Its expression changed, it could not believe that a peak level Late Seas of Souls Realm ant could use his own power to trap him like this. It shocked him and embarrassed him.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The hallow ball shook once, stopping the bat king’s second attack.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>…</p><p>over on the cliff, there was a human shadow flying towards the symbol ball.</p><p>“The graveyard is in here?”</p><p>The warrior who was talking to himself had a battle blade on his back. The metal shield of his exposed out in the open and with no cloths covering at all. If there was a human demi king warrior here then they sure would recognized him. It was indeed one of the top warrior, the Thunder Spirit King.</p><p>“By the looks of it, a lot of people had entered already.”</p><p>Thunder spirit king had heard the noise ahead him of, he looked rather calm.</p><p>Dozens of miles flashed past, the thunder spirit king saw the source of the noise. In front of the groups of bats, there was a dark ball wrapped in strange symbols exploded and a muscular human shaped bat appeared looking at him with cold expression.</p><p>“Another demi king warrior, I am quite lucky.”</p><p>The ghost bat licked his lips. All of the anger from before disappeared completely. There was nothing more satisfying when prey just walked into his mouth.</p><p>“I think this might just be your bad luck.”</p><p>Thunder spirit king scanned around the area, thunder and lightning was visible behind his eyes.</p><p>“Everyone, attack!”</p><p>The bat king knew that the thunder spirit king was no one simple, he prepared to have his pawns to surround him before giving him the fetal attack.</p><p>Countless bats jumped towards the thunder spirit king.</p><p>“Destroy!”</p><p>Thunder spirit king lifted up his right hand into a blade and said one character before throwing out a palm blade.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>The thunder blade light flashed once before disappearing. All of the ghost bats had been destroyed like blade waves had been sliced in halves which restored the balance of the nature.</p><p>The pupils shrieked into two tiny dots. The bat king was frightened.</p><p>“Perhaps you can play with me.”</p><p>Thunder spirit king looked at the bat king.</p><p>“Do not be arrogant.”</p><p>The bat king shoot out jumping at the thunder spirit king with extreme speed.</p><p>“Piss off.”</p><p>Facing that powerful attack of the bat king, thunder spirit king still only throw out one palm attack.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>Dark blood splashed in the air. The right shoulder of bat king all the way to the left stomach had been sliced through. His whole body almost been sliced into two. Even the bones and internal organs can be seen.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The black qi scrambled, the bat king appeared back to where he was before. He looked down at his chest and then the warrior standing in front of him. The cold stare had a hint of fear. Although his power had not gone back to its peak yet, but it was still about ninty percent there. And his opponent had not only taken out his blade yet and that palm blade attack had already separated his corpses. Even if he was at his peak level, he would not have the confidence to win as well.</p><p>The flesh and blood moved. The wounds on bat king’s body repaired itself leaving no trace of the wounds ever being there. It was the special power of the ghost bats which had nothing to do with the immortal body.</p><p>“Oh! You have the right for me to move the blade a bit.”</p><p>The thunder spirit king held the back of his battle blade with his right. He slowly took it out which shone a cold light and sharp blade. The shiny electricity flashed once on the sharp edges of the blade.</p><p>“You can make it through.”</p><p>The bat king screamed before shooting out from where. He knew that that warrior managed to almost kill him without even taking out his sword, and if he really did, then the chance of him being killed would be way too high for him to ignore. He had not lived long enough yet or at least he did not want to die yet. Once waited him regaining his peak condition, he planned to come back to find him. And for now, he could only swallow his pride and escape from this man.</p><p>If the iron hand king was here then he would be shocked. This bat king had almost killed all of them. And judging by power, the bat king should almost be at demi king warrior level and still they were scared to this level. Then it would not be hard to imagine how powerful this Thunder Spirit King was.</p><p>“Great.”</p><p>Putting back his battle blade, the thunder spirit king did not try to go around. He shoot through the bat groups with one straight line.</p><p>Ahhhhhh!</p><p>All of the ghost bats screamed, rushing to hide on the sides, making a wide path for him to go through.</p><p>…</p><p>After making thorugh the marshland. The three slowed down their speed. But they did not dare to relax at all since they could not be sure whether if there were more danger or not.</p><p>“My power is still far from enough.”</p><p>Before they came here, although Ye Chen knew that he was still nothing amonst the demi king warriors, but everything had been so smooth for him so he had not really experienced frustration before or at least he was not that desperate to gain more power. But now, he saw it clearer about how little power he had.</p><p>Not to mention the dangerous creatures hidden here, even those demi king warriors who were here had threatened him.</p><p>His power now was only at normal demi king warrior level which had still a gap to the top ones. And above that, there were top demi king warriors. With him being in the bottom, he was only slightly more powerful than some of those top master level warriors.</p><p>He did not think that the demi king warriors here were not the ones he saw. There must be a lot of them he had not seen yet. For example, the demi king warriors from the top nine martial schools, four top families and other rank 5 schools. There were also a lot those ones who had never shown their faces yet. Even if he had such powerful surviving power, there would be still nothing he could do when he encountered one of those.</p><p>If wanting to stay alive, then he must have some kind of gains from this graveyard. And the only way to increase his power would be to make a breakthrough and there would be nothing else.</p><p>“Find a safe place. I will need to try to breakthrough to peak level late Astral Reaching Realm.”</p><p>Ye Chen thought to himself.</p><p>“Ye Chen, are you okay?”</p><p>Murong Qingchen saw that Ye Chen had a lot going on in his head, she asked.</p><p>“It is okay, we will wait here for senior Qing Liu.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
