Now, you will be working on the No.3 devouring island.” The Holy Spirit pointed at the island below and soon disappeared.</p><p>“Do you want to go?” A lot of the people hesitated.</p><p>“What happens if you do not go? Do you have a way to leave?”</p><p>“Let’s go! Let’s go and check it out at least.”</p><p>Just like that, everyone arrived at the No.3 devouring island.</p><p>It was not that big, and only a tiny one. But, there were more people on the island than what Ye Chen had expected. There were more than thousands of them; not many of them were inside the valley in the middle training, while the others created Zhen yuan crystals in their own caves. Some others were chatting outside, relaxing, or battling.</p><p>“See, another batch of the unlucky ones.”</p><p>“I bet they were tricked here as well.”</p><p>The people who were on the island started to look at Ye Chen, sounding joyous and a bit numb.</p><p>“The Black Water alliance has lied to so many people.” Murong Qingcheng saw that there were thousands of people on one island and was very surprised, since there were six islands inside the whole devouring island. With all of them added together, there would be more than one hundred thousand people here. The lowest cultivation here was Astral Reaching Realm, and the highest would be half step king realm. If they could control all of them, it would be a force of horrifying power.</p><p>“After this long time, it would not be strange to see this many people here.” Ye Chen’s expression changed as he continued to say, “It seems like some of these people had been here for many years now. Although they had not died, they were not that different from zombies.”</p><p>Hearing him, Murong Qingcheng looked at everyone on the island and realized that out of one hundred warriors, one or two of them always looked a bit numb, looking like they were not interested in anything. Their eyes had lost their focus.</p><p>“Will we become like this?” Murong Qingcheng seemed a bit stressed out.</p><p>Whoo!</p><p>Ye Chen let out a breath and said with a sneer, “Wanting to hold me here will depend on if this place can do that after all.”</p><p>The Holy Spirit said that even Life and Death realm warriors could not do anything to it, but there were no Life and Death realm warriors on the devouring island. In addition, even if Life and Death realm warriors could not do much to the Holy Spirit, they would not be scared of it either. Therefore, as long as he could reach Life and Death realm, then there would be hope to get out. Of course, it was the future still, and perhaps it would not be the only option after all.</p><p>“Hey, you newbies! You might not know about the unofficial rules of the island yet, so I will be the nice guy and tell you.” A bulky man walked out.</p><p>“First, on the devouring island, everyone has their own caves. If you guys want your own places, then you will have to be create them. The distance between your place and other people’s places would have to be within fifty meters, so it would not be too big either. Secondly, there is a training place in the middle of the island. Besides the last day of each week, you can go there and train the rest of the time. But of course, there might be a queue. Thirdly, the last day of each month would be the due day for handing over the Zhen yuan crystals, so do not forget about that. As for where to hand them in, you do not have to worry about that for now. Once you finish building your cave, a stone stand will appear. You will just need to place the Zhen yuan crystals there.”</p><p>“Alright. That is about it. You guys go build your caves now. The mountain stones here are rather rough.” The bulky looking man waved his hand.</p><p>…</p><p>Since the island was not big, the locations for their own cave were actually really limited. There were only a few hills available, and Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng went to check out a lot of places before picking one final spot for a cave.</p><p>The reason that they chose to build their cave inside the mountain was because Ye Chen found out that the stones on the island were very tough, and were able to block out soul power. Even the soul power from Sea of Souls realm warriors could only reach out ten meters, and less than thirty meters for half step king warriors. Although Ye Chen’s soul power was powerful, but his could only reach out about fifty meters.</p><p>The cave had been built and waves of vibration spreads out continuously. A stone stand appeared slowly.</p><p>‘This devouring island seemed to have its own rules.’ Ye Chen thought to himself.</p><p>“What do you think this Holy Spirit thing is?” Murong thought for a while.</p><p>Ye Chen said, “It should be the manager of this part of the universe. As for whether it is actually a life form, I would not know about that. But, I kept having this feeling that this place might come from a very powerful source, which would be something that even Life and Death realm warriors would be concerned about. Otherwise, that Holy Spirit would not have mentioned that those warriors would not be able to do anything to them.”</p><p>“That is not good.” Murong Qingcheng frowned.</p><p>“Today is the first day. We do not know anything yet, but soon we will.” Ye Chen took out the puppet house from his storage ring and placed it at the center. He did not want to sleep on the concreted ground.</p><p>…</p><p>Astral Reaching Realm warriors could create about fifteen Zhen yuan crystals each month, which would be one piece every two days. Meanwhile, Sea of Souls realm warriors would  make five times more than Astral Reaching Realm warriors, which would be seventy-five pieces a month, and five for every two days.</p><p>In the next four days, Ye Chen had created eleven Zhen yuan crystals, which was already way higher than average. As for Murong Qingcheng, she created demon power crystal, which were fifteen of them. Her creation speed was way faster than Ye Chen, since demon power was more powerful than Zhen yuan already.</p><p>“I wonder if the demon power crystals would work.” Murong Qingcheng said.</p><p>Ye Chen said, “On the devouring island, there were also beasts who create beast power crystals. Since those could work, your demon power crystals should work as well.”</p><p>“Let’s hope so!” Murong Qingcheng nodded.</p><p>“Let’s go! There is a training ground at the center of the island. Let’s go check it out.” Creating eleven Zhen yuan crystals within four days, they would be able to create at least eighty of them within a month. And Sea of Souls realm warriors would only need to hand over fifty of them. So, they were doing pretty good with time.</p><p>“Yeah!”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng and Ye Chen walked out of the cave together.</p><p>The island was not big, so once they left their caves, they could see the people on the island.</p><p>“I have only made sixteen Zhen yuan crystals this month. Ten of them would have to be handed in, and three for the Black Water alliance. I only have three for myself, and now you want two of those? That is my whole month’s work!”  Not far away, an Astral reaching realm warrior yelled.</p><p>“I do not care how much you have created this month, I have asked you to hand over so just hand it over. Otherwise, I will take all of the Zhen yuan crystals away from you and let you be punished by the Holy Spirit. And I believe you have heard about how painful this punishment is. Do you want to try it out yourself?”</p><p>The speaker was an evil looking middle man with very long hair. There were dozens of Sea of souls realm warrior standing behind him, all looking powerful.</p><p>“Don’t bully me!” This Astral Reaching realm warrior’s tone weakened.</p><p>“I AM bullying you! Hurry up! I do not have time to waste on you.” He sounded very impatient.</p><p>In the end, this person still handed over that two Zhen yuan crystals before leaving frustrated.</p><p>“Ah, when will this all end?” An elder standing not far away from Ye Chen shook his head.</p><p>Ye Chen turned around to look. “Elder, what is going on?”</p><p>“What else could it be? Just the dark power party here.” The elder’s cultivation was not weak at all as well; he was at late Sea of Souls realm.</p><p>“Dark power party. There are other dark power parties here besides the Black Water alliance?” Murong Qingcheng was not following it.</p><p>The elder explained, “The Black Water alliance is the biggest management on devouring island besides the Holy Spirit. All six islands are run by them. And there are a lot of dark power parties on each island as well. On our No.3 devouring island, there are thirty zones, each one of them being controlled by a group of dark power parties. This zone is called the Black mountain zone, which is controlled by a half step king warrior who is referred to as the Tough king. His rule is that as long as we live in this island, astral reaching realm warrior would have to hand in two Zhen yuan crystals each month, ten for Sea of Souls realm warriors. Half step king warriors would not have to hand in anything.”</p><p>“And the black water alliance is not doing anything about it?” Murong Qingcheng continued to ask.</p><p>The elder made a face. “They are all in this together. Those dark power parties are all accepted secretly by the black water alliance to ensure better control over the islands. Otherwise if there is a riot, then the black water alliance would take some damage from that as well.”</p><p>“I see.” Ye Chen nodded slightly.</p><p>“You guys are new here, right?”  The elder saw that Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng were both rather foreign looking.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Right now is the beginning of the week, so there should not be anyone knocking on your door for Zhen yuan crystals. But from the end of this month, you will have to start facing these problems as well. Remember, do not fight with the Tough king or his power party, and especially do not fight against the Black Water alliance. Otherwise, the consequences are just catastrophic,”</p><p>“Thank you, elder for the heads-up!” Ye Chen greeted him while holding his fists together, then walked towards the center of the No.3 devouring island.</p><p>On the way, Murong Qingcheng said, “This island is messier than I have imagined. There are thirty zones, and each one of them have at least seven to eight hundred people. Ninety percent of them are astral reaching realm warriors. So, one thousand Zhen yuan crystals can be generated from them. Meanwhile, there are about ten percent Sea of Souls realm warriors, so one thousand pieces from them as well. That makes two thousand of them. What a great fortune that is!”</p><p>Ye Chen shook his head. “It would not be this easy. The black water alliance would not let the Tough king have it all. I think the alliance would take most of that too.”</p><p>Inside the valley in the middle of the island, Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng could see that there were a lot of people lining up for the space.</p><p>“This many people!”</p><p>“Let’s head back.”</p><p>Actually, Ye Chen did not really value this training ground, since he was only one step away from half step king warrior realm, and so was Murong Qingcheng. Training alone would not make much difference.</p><p>When they first came to the island, it was the beginning of the month, so all of the Zhen yuan crystals had been stored inside the storage ring. And it was not time to hand them in yet.</p><p>With a blink of an eye, twenty days had gone by, and the end of the month was approaching.</p><p>During this time, Ye Chen had created fifty-five Zhen yuan crystals while Murong Qingcheng made seventy-five, which had gone over the requirement by a big margin.</p><p>“Can you guys go easy on me this month? I have used a lot of Zhen yuan crystals to accumulate Zhen yuan. There are only sixty of them left by the end of the month. If I give you ten of them, then it would not be enough left.”</p><p>The same thing happened again inside the black mountain zone, but it was a peak level late Sea of souls realm warrior this time.</p><p>“Sorry, but you have to hand them out. Hurry up!” The follower of the Tough king did not change his expression at all.</p><p>This warrior had to bite his teeth while handing out the valuable ten Zhen yuan crystals. He had actually just advanced from peak level mid Sea of Souls realm, and then to the peak level late realm this month, which took up quite a few Zhen yuan crystals.</p><p>“Hey! You two, come over here to hand in Zhen yuan crystals. Ten each!” After putting away those ten from that warrior, the warrior noticed Ye Chen.</p><p>Ye Chen was not surprised since the beginning and the end of each month was the time when these dark power parties started collecting the crystals. After all, there were at least thousand people in this zone, and it would take days to collect them all.</p><p>“Ask the Tough king to come talk to me.” Ye Chen spoke calmly without any change of expression.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
