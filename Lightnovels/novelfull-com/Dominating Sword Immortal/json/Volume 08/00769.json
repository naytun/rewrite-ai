However, this was not Ye Chen’s first time. As one would expect, he should not have suffered much. But, the truth was that be it Ye Chen or Murong Qingcheng, they were feeling quite uneasy. Their brains were buzzing, rendering them incapable of thinking or speaking. The blood and Zhen Yuan in their bodies was flowing in reverse, seeming as if it would burst out of their bodies at any moment.</p><p>They didn’t know how long they remained in that state. In the primal chaos void, a dazzling wisp of light gradually appeared, looking like long light spears streaking across.</p><p>Blob!</p><p>The two were sent out of the world of primal chaos.</p><p>“What a strange transportation!”</p><p>Ye Chen had yet to regain his sense of direction and balance. He was swaying left, right, and center, waiting for his body to recover. Murong Qingcheng beside him was the same.</p><p>However, the two didn’t take long to recover and turned completely normal in about ten breaths.</p><p>“I thought that the Devouring Islands was merely a lost plane. But now, it seems it’s not as simple as that.” Ye Chen swept his gaze around and only saw a boundless ocean. Letting out a sigh of relief, he said to Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>The latter faintly nodded, “The rules of Devouring Islands are too different than our True Spirit. If it were merely a lost plane, its rules should have resembled True Spirit.”</p><p>Ye Chen said, “Let’s think about that later. This ocean is a bit strange too.”</p><p>Although the ocean underneath them didn’t seem different from other oceans, Ye Chen’s general feeling was that this ocean was much darker and violent than normal. Even occasionally appearing little fishes and shrimps gave a grim feeling.</p><p>“It’s demonic Qi!” Murong QIngcheng said.</p><p>“Demonic Qi?” Ye Chen revealed a look of understanding. No wonder he had a little familiar feeling. It was the source of demonic power—the demonic Qi.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng said, “I can feel that the demonic Qi is coming from underneath. The deeper inside the ocean, the richer the demonic Qi.”</p><p>“Then, haven’t we arrived at a paradise for you?” Ye Chen smiled.</p><p>“The demonic Qi here is indeed quite rich, but it’s also mixed with other things.” Murong Qingcheng, who had pure demonic power in her body, seemed to have sensed something and turned her head towards the northwest, gazing into the distance.</p><p>In the northwest, a huge black spot had appeared at some point, moving at an extremely fast speed. One moment, it was at the horizon, and the next moment, it had already arrived a hundred li away from the two. Moreover, it was streaking straight toward the two. Upon encountering such a situation, ordinary people would have immediately gotten themselves far away. However, Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng wouldn’t escape and neither create unnecessary misunderstandings with the counterpart without understanding the situation.</p><p>Swish Swish Swish Swish!</p><p>The black spot was naturally no black spot, but numerous human figures, who were divided into two groups. The group in lead had lesser numbers, around seven-eight, whereas the group in the rear were around thirty in number. The two groups seemed to be in pursuit. What made Ye Chen astonished was that the group in the front had demonic beast phantoms at their backs, whereas the group in the back also gave emitted ripples of demonic power.</p><p>“It’s the half beast race and demonic human race!” Ye Chen said astoundedly.</p><p>“Right!” Murong Qingcheng’s face turned rather grave.</p><p>When the distance between them had lessened to a few li, it could be clearly seen that seven-eight individuals of half-beast clan were chased by thirty demonic humans. This group of seven-eight half-beasts was led by a white-robed woman. She was sweeping her gaze all around, carefully watching for hidden enemies. When her gaze fell on Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng, she blinked as if hinting something.</p><p>“Ought to be the Whitemoon fox race. Their nature is actually not bad.”</p><p>The white fox phantom behind the white-robed woman’s body was quite clear. Moreover, the fox phantom’s forehead had a silver-colored crescent moon branded on it. Hence, it was not hard for Ye Chen to guess that they were the Silvermoon Whitefox King and humanity’s descendants. As for the hint from white-robed woman, it should be telling them to escape.</p><p>“Young miss, we’ll block them. Escape fast!” A young man beside white-robed woman anxiously said after seeing that they were already surrounded by numerous people.</p><p>The latter said, “We Silvermoon Fox are not some ordinary half-beast clan. We’ll never leave anybody behind.”</p><p>“Young miss, this is not the time. There is nothing to be gained from you staying. Only you’ll be able to avenge us later.” The old man at her other side said persuasively.</p><p>The white-robed woman smiled bitterly, “You think I can escape? And let’s assume for a moment that I escaped, then what? I’ll be caught later all the same. At that time, I’ll be all alone. I’d much rather have all of us stake lives together…Perhaps we can find a glimmer of hope.”</p><p>“Haha, why aren’t you fleeing? It’s already been three days and three nights. We can play for a few more days.” The leader of demonic humans was a robust middle-aged man. His upper body was naked, and seemed to be carved out of sleek metal. His two arms could no longer be considered human shaped; they were two exceptionally thick and black arms. Two sharp white bones were protruding out of his elbows and shoulders. The fingernails of his palm which was holding the long spear were curved and shining with a strange black light.</p><p>Like the middle-aged demonic man, the other surrounding individuals were also naked above the waist, and had some sections completely different than humans.</p><p>“Demonic Transformation!”</p><p>Ye Chen could see that these demonic humans were capable of demonic transformation. Moreover, there transformations were unusually sinister, much more frightening than demonic humans of True Spirit Continent.</p><p>“We Silvermoon Whitefox clan had no enmity with you demonic humans. Why are you forcing us so persistently? It seems like you think we Silvermoon Whitefox people are easily bullied.” The white-robed woman was holding a slender silver-white sword with a cold expression.</p><p>“Hehe…Who doesn’t know that the Chaotic Demonic Ocean is our area? Since you’ve entered, then you’re under our supervision. Take out all your artifacts and follow us back, and you might be able to live. Otherwise, all will die except you!” The middle-aged man grinned sinisterly.</p><p>“Don’t think I know what you people are doing! In these years, uncountable half-beast clan members have disappeared in the Chaotic Demonic Ocean. All of this is most likely your doing…” The white robed woman also didn’t wish to come to the Chaotic Demonic Ocean. Although it was very dangerous, this place had a rich demonic Qi, which gave birth to some miraculous spirit herbs. She had come precisely for these herbs.</p><p>“Since you know, stop asking so many questions. You can quietly follow us back now or be prepared to leave behind several corpses.” The middle-aged man’s two arms was covered by a layer of black Qi, seeming like demonic arms burning with ghost fire.</p><p>“Stop dreaming!”</p><p>“Then don’t blame s for being ruthless.” The middle-aged man’s face turned fiendish. However, he didn’t immediately launch an assault. Instead, he said to the demonic human beside him, “Iron Bone, take a group and surround those two. If they obediently let themselves be captured, then fine…Otherwise, kill that kid.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The demonic man called Iron Bone had an even more robust figure than the middle-aged man; his naked upper body seemed like a little mountain. The right half of his body, including the arm, was covered in a black boned armor. This bone armor grew out of his body, extremely thick and spiral shaped.</p><p>“Who would have thought that we’d be facing demonic humans as soon as we arrived.” Ye Chen said, not putting these demonic humans in his eyes at all.</p><p>“Humans or demonic humans, it makes no difference. The only difference is whether they are enemies or not.” Murong Qingcheng had no good feelings for them just because they were demonic humans. These demonic humans had long degraded. They had extremely thick fiendish aura and killing intent.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>With the wave of the middle-aged demonic man’s hand, twenty demonic humans pounced on the white-robed woman’s group. Meanwhile, the demonic man called Iron Bone led ten people as he shot toward Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng, their figures looking like bolts of black lightning.</p><p>In a blink, Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng had been surrounded.</p><p>“Kid, seal off your own Zhen Yuan and you might live.” The aura of Murong Qingcheng’s body was extremely attractive to Iron Bone. He didn’t target her and instead viciously glared Ye Chen.</p><p>“Just because of you lot?”</p><p>Ye Chen sized the ten demonic humans. Apart from Iron Bone, none of them had entered half-step Demon King realm. Of course, once they transformed, their strengths would be greatly enhanced, and they should be capable of contending against ordinary half-step Kings.</p><p>“Seems like you have a death wish.” Iron Bone squinted his eyes and vigorously waved his arm.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Five demonic humans immediately stepped forth, charging at Ye Chen.</p><p>Five late Sea of Soul realm demonic humans were enough to let an ordinary half-step King retreat. As far as Iron Bone was concerned, Ye Chen, who was not even a half-step King, wouldn’t survive for a second.</p><p>However, he couldn’t believe his eyes in the next moment.</p><p>Without taking out his sword, Ye Chen simply waved two fingers. With a swish, a dark-golden ripple spread out, and the five demonic humans spurted out mouthful bloods as bone-deep scars appeared on their chests. The next moment, their bodies sunk powerlessly into the depths of the ocean.</p><p>“Come with me, all of you! You two go deal with that woman…She can’t escape!” After being gobsmacked, he roared fiercely.</p><p>“As many comes, as many will die.”</p><p>Ye Chen’s finger was like lightning as three little thunder spheres condensed at its tip. Three puffs could be heard and three scorched holes appeared on the foreheads’ of the three demonic humans. The holes were not big at all, but everything inside had been burnt to nothingness. They simply had no clue how Ye Chen had attacked and died unaware.</p><p>On the other side, the two demonic humans fighting Murong Qingcheng were extremely alarmed. Their demonic Qi immediately loosened upon touching Murong Qingcheng’s body. It seemed like her body was a black hole, swallowing their demonic Qi.</p><p>Rip!</p><p>With palm chop, Murong Qingcheng severed the skull of one. Meanwhile, the other gathered his courage and punched at her. However, her black hair reached the target first before she reached out and grabbed his skull, her palm filled with an extremely rich and pure demonic energy.</p><p>“You are also…”</p><p>This demonic human’s eyes wide opened. He could feel that her hand didn’t have Zhen Yuan, but pure demonic power. This kind of demonic power could only be present in a demonic human with pure demonic blood vessels. Moreover, this possessor was even a woman. If this news made its way back, the entire demonic clan would be shaken. Unfortunately, he wouldn’t have the opportunity.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng released the demonic energy in her palm and destroyed the former’s skull.</p><p>Having no attention to spare, Iron Bone was wholeheartedly focused on Ye Chen. All eight people launching assault had instantly died. Moreover, even he himself was not the latter’s opponent. His entire body was aching and bone armor was about to crack.</p><p>“This defense is quite good.” Ye Chen suddenly spoke as one finger suddenly pierced through bone armor defense and swept by the other’s throat.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Spurting blood that gave off a fishy scent, Iron Bone clutched his neck and fell down from the sky with his face up.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
