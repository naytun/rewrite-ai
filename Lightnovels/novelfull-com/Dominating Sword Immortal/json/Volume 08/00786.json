It was the worth of ten half-step Kings. With such an amount, if one were to attend a super high level auction, one would be almost unrivaled, and be able to crush the opponents with mere spirit stones. Of course, the prerequisite was that one’s opponent was not a descendant of some Life and Death King. After all, although fifty million was a huge number, it didn’t mean much to a Life and Death King. A Life and Death King could easily procure some treasures from King grade forbidden zones or stars and sell them for hundreds of millions. There was simply no comparison.</p><p>In any case, a fortune of fifty million upper grade stones was an astonishing wealth for the majority of half-step Kings. They would never let it slip away.</p><p>Jin Wanshuang let out a breath and spoke, “According to the previous agreement, ten percent will be first set aside for lady Murong, then we’ll divide the rest amongst ourselves equally. Does anyone have something to say?”</p><p>Jin Wanshuang didn’t let so many upper grade spirit stones muddle his brain and kept his word. This was a basic requirement for a party. If one didn’t keep one’s word, how could they continue? How could he expect others to keep their words? As the leader of the group, he had a duty to maintain basic propriety. If he caused the group to split apart due to himself, it would be against his principles.</p><p>Taking a step back, they had merely explored one-third of the ruins. There would certainly be many treasures ahead. If the first batch of treasures created an irreconcilable situation among the group, it would simply be stupid.</p><p>“Ten percent is more than fifty million!” The two brothers were quite the misers, and were quite reluctant to part with such a fortune.</p><p>“What? You two don’t intend to keep your word?” Jin Wanshuang’s face turned grim.</p><p>“Of course not! Fifty million is a lot, but we’ll still have a lot left. We brothers know how to consider the whole picture.” The elder brother grinned.</p><p>“I’ll heed my big bro.” The younger brother also agreed.</p><p>“What about the rest of you?” Jin Wanshuang looked at the rest.</p><p>“I have nothing to say. Since it was decided back then, there is nothing to regret. A few million spirit stones aren’t enough to make me go back on my word.” The middle-aged woman snorted coldly.</p><p>Seeing that the few most troublesome people had agreed, the others agreed without a word.</p><p>“Alright, let me check how many spirit stones there are.” Jin Wanshuang revealed a smile and walked over.</p><p>Ye Chen smiled back calmly. The Dark Force Field gained them fifty million upper grade spirit stones. This was a very worthwhile trade.</p><p>However, at time, one’s wish wouldn’t be met that easily. Just as everybody was about to estimate the number of spirit stones, a group of people suddenly appeared from the conveyor array at the palace’s other side. The latter group had one member less than Ye Chen’s, but their auras were not one bit inferior.</p><p>Their leader was actually the golden-haired Shi Shaobao, the young lord of Golden Lion Clan. Shi Shaobao was quite tall, around two to three meters. He had wide shoulders, a golden face, and two golden eyes that emanated a bright golden light, giving off a majestic aura.</p><p>However, he alone was not enough to cause Ye Chen worry. What made him worried was that among the individuals by his side were a few that he had not been able to see through in the teahouse. For example, there was the tattooed bald fatty, the middle-aged scholar with the sword, the middle-aged woman with sinister aura, and the short old man in a raincoat.</p><p>Apart from them, Ye Chen had not seen the others before, but none of them could be looked down upon. They didn’t seem inferior compared to their group, and two even surpassed theirs.</p><p>Looking at the suddenly arrived unwelcomed guests, Jin Wanshuang and the others’ nerves were stretched taut. Each and every one of them was staring at the opponents unblinkingly. It was an atmosphere of swords drawn and bows pulled.</p><p>“I’m afraid there will be a big battle!” Murong Qingcheng said gravely.</p><p>Ye Chen faintly nodded, “Unless everybody could sit together and evenly divide the spirit stones…but that’s basically impossible. So, a battle it is.”</p><p>A battle erupting due to the wealth of ancient ruins was nothing surprising. In fact, it would be strange if there was none. Everybody had long been accustomed to such unexpected developments. Thus, neither did they have any complaints, nor would they cower back.</p><p>“Haha! So many upper grade stones! Heavens is really looking up for me, Shi Shaobao.” Shi Shaobao walked out of the array and laughed heartily, completely ignoring everybody else. His golden hair fluttered like golden flames.</p><p>“Hehe, why do I see some flies?”</p><p>The bald fatty’s body expanded horizontally. Standing beside Shi Shaobao, he looked like a mound of flesh, shaking incessantly. However, his mouth was too vicious, belittling Ye Chen and the rest as soon as he arrived. Like Shi Shaobao, he didn’t put them in his eyes either.</p><p>“Just slap them to death.”</p><p>Although the middle-aged woman beside Shi Shabao didn’t resemble the middle-aged woman in Ye Chen’s group, the former being taller, their auras were quite similar; both were extremely sinister. Being watched by him was like being stared at by a viper.</p><p>Over at Ye Chen’s side, Jin Wanshuang didn’t say a word and merely swept his gaze through everybody. At this point, it wouldn’t be a simple disagreement, but a full out group battle. He was seeking the opinions of others. If a couple of them turned out to be unwilling, there was no point in fighting. They would have no chance.</p><p>“Those in the way will die.” The cold-faced youngster, who hadn’t spoken anything until now, coldly stared at Shi Shaobao’s group and uttered six words.</p><p>Faintly nodding, Jin Wanshuang turned to others.</p><p>“To get in the way of us brothers’ riches, they are already damned.” The two brothers had fiery temperaments. Making them back down would be more difficult than killing them. Eyes filled with savageness and brutality, they seemed itching to immediately begin. Their playful and silly appearances when Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng had entered the private room in the teahouse was nowhere to be seen. Ye Chen naturally knew that these two couldn’t be judged from their outer appearances.</p><p>“That girl is pretty good.”</p><p>After eating a loss from Ye Chen, the yellow-faced big man didn’t look at Murong Qingcheng wantonly, and merely snuck a couple of glances. However, at this moment, his nature was revealed. He was unblinkingly staring at the young woman toward Shi Shaobao’s right, as if looking through her robes.</p><p>“I’m old. How much more can I live for?” Only the old man sighed and muttered seemingly nonsensical words. However, in the ears of the listener, they faintly carried a sense of majesty.</p><p>“Leave that old woman for me.” The middle-aged woman couldn’t bear to look at the woman on the other side, finding her too ugly.</p><p>At this moment, only the yellow-robed woman, Lin Yuxuan, and Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng were left. However, at this point, Jin Wanshuang retracted his gaze, not asking their opinion. He was not able to see through the yellow-robed woman either, but if she turned out to be a benevolent lady, he would rather be blind.</p><p>As for Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng, one look at the aura they were emitting and one could easily tell that they had killed a lot of people. It was especially the case for Ye Chen, as the evil Qi on his body was thicker than anybody else. Jin Wanshuang admitted that he had looked down on the latter. Perhaps, this person was more frightening than he could imagine, having piled a mountain of corpses.</p><p>Meanwhile, Lin Yuxuan was young and frivolous. This kind of a person was like a newborn calf, not fearing anything.</p><p>Clank!</p><p>The two brothers savagely roared and stamped, shaking the air itself and emitting a killing intent suffused with savageness, seeming as if they couldn’t wait to fight.</p><p>“A pack of ants dare to roar before me. I’ll tear your body apart alive then crush your bones.” Shi Shaobao had a sneer on his face, but his voice carried a sinister chill.</p><p>“Shi Shaobao, I’ve long since seen your strength, but never had the chance to fight. Come on, let’s see who can laugh in the end.” Lin Yuxuan stepped out.</p><p>“Preposterous!”</p><p>A young man walked out from behind Shi Shaobao’s body. He seemed even younger than Lin Yuxuan, merely about twenty two years old. He had a beautiful face and was waving the fan in his hands.</p><p>“Preposterous or not, you’ll soon find out. Shi Shaobao, do you dare fight with me or not. If not, scram!” Lin Yuxuan took out his weapon, a halberd.</p><p>At present, both sides were evenly matched. Each one of them was an expert. Anybody who took a step back would not only lose face, his or her self-esteem would take a huge blow. The powerful regarded self-esteem quite heavily, and would only disregard it if they were confronted with an impossible to beat enemy. Evidently, neither side thought that their opponent fell under this category. So how could they be willing to take even half a step back?</p><p>A huge battle was on the verge of erupting.</p><p>“You’re not worthy of fighting me. Zhao Shiwen, go fight him!” Shi Shaobao said to the beautiful white-faced young man.</p><p>“That is the most appropriate.”</p><p>The white-faced young man stepped out and stopped at the site’s center, faintly raising his head and looking down on Lin Yuxuan.</p><p>“Fine, fight!”</p><p>Lin Yuxuan’s face turned ashen. The gleam in his eyes almost seemed to materialize, as if wishing the pierce his opponent. He suddenly charged forth.</p><p>“Courting death!” The white-faced youngster immediately counterattacked.</p><p>This was not a duel, but a battle for riches. Who would be willing to sit aside and watch others’ battles? As if premeditated, the middle-aged women from both sides simultaneously stepped out, slowly walking toward each other. When they were about a hundred meters from each other, the two’s figures almost simultaneously turned illusory, seemingly trying to confuse the opponent. However, since the two’s actions were the same, it ended up looking extremely creepy and terrifying.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Shi Shaobao’s golden haired fluttered as his entire being leapt forth. A golden demonic power burst out of his body, sweeping through the entire palace. It shook the blood Qi of many, causing them to be alarmed inwardly.</p><p>This was a super strong young expert, and also the proud young lord of Golden Lion Clan. He couldn’t tolerate others defying him. And thus, he was making his move.</p><p>“He is mine!” As the leader of the other group, Jin Wanshuang was not willing to pass his responsibility onto others. With his every step, the metallic luster on his body deepened. At his tenth step, his entire being seemed to have turned metallic, emanating an extremely dense, piercing light.</p><p>“Go take care of others…Don’t leave a single one alive!” As Shi Shaobao charged at Jin Wanshuang, his voice rumbled through the palace.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The site instantly boiled, his words seemingly setting a barrel of explosives aflame. Everybody’s expressions turned sinister, oozing out killing intent.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
