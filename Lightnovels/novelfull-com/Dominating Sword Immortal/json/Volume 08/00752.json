As for the other one, he knew without thinking that it belonged to the Void Emperor. Only his grandeur could make the heaven and earth feel clogged and squeezed in.</p><p>“Two titled monarchs!”</p><p>Ye Chen had long since heard the name of Void Emperor. At present, he was also about to see the Space Emperor. Although the latter’s fame was far below Void Emperor’s in the True Spirit Continent, in the eyes of learned individuals, they were both on the same level. In the eyes of ordinary people, even ordinary kings were legendary figures. And now, he was before them, not because of luck, but because he had reached this level. After all, even the weakest among all the people present were peak Masters.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Two bubble popping sounds echoed and two spatial halos appeared almost at the same time. Two figures walked out from therein, majestic and heroic. Just their figures gave off an enormous pressure like the sky and the great earth, boundless and mighty.</p><p>Space Emperor!</p><p>Void Emperor!</p><p>Descended at the same time!</p><p>“Ling Tianxu your strength can still take one step forward after so many years…Admirable!” Space Emperor was a tall and heroic middle-aged man with wide shoulders and a slender waist. His wide shoulders seemed to be capable of supporting the heavens itself. His nose stood high and erect, and lips were thin. His eyes were like two black holes and gaze extremely focused; one could only wonder how deep it went. If he looked at one, he might as well suck out his or her soul.</p><p>“It’s your strength that is called deep and immeasurable. I’m afraid I’ll not be your opponent two years later.”</p><p>Void Emperor was a middle-aged man in magnificent robes who wore a gold crown. His eyes seemed to contain the void, devouring the heaven and earth. Although he seemed a bit less enigmatic than Space Emperor, his grandeur seemed to absorb mountains and river, and encompass the sun and moon.</p><p>“Your praise seems to be mocking me, eh!” Space Emperor smiled indifferently and turned his gaze onto the statue of Four Extreme Emperor at the middle of the plaza. The Void Emperor’s gaze also fell on the statue.</p><p>Space Emperor sighed, “You and I have attained this height, but we are still inferior compared to the ancient experts. I wonder what realm would be the next step.”</p><p>“Just take that step and you’ll know.” Void Emperor’s expression remained indifferent.</p><p>“Indeed!” Space Emperor slightly raised his head and his gaze turned askance. It contained an ambition, thirst, and tyranny that ordinary people could hardly imagine.</p><p>“Teacher!”</p><p>Jiang Tian took a few steps forward and cupped his fists in respect.</p><p>“Who killed Lian Feng.” Space Emperor faintly nodded and asked.</p><p>Hearing these words, Jing Tian looked at Ye Chen.</p><p>“I understand!” Space Emperor turned his head and looked at Ye Chen, “Good, very good! Your True Spirit Continent actually produced such a genius…even your disciple can’t compare.”</p><p>Void Emperor said, “I do not care about the affairs of the young generation. But, it seems like your virtuous disciple ate a loss by his hands as well.”</p><p>“Hehe, indeed!” Space Emperor spoke while looking at Jiang Tian from the corner of his eyes.</p><p>Jiang Tian promptly lowered his head, a shameful expression appearing on his face.</p><p>“Space Emperor, Void Emperor!”</p><p>Seeing that the situation was not developing well, Mysterious Queen stood out.</p><p>“Little girl, after these few years, even I can’t see through your aura clearly.” Compared to Space Emperor, Mysterious Queen was indeed a little girl.</p><p>Mysterious Queen smiled, “Really? Everybody says that I have a strength nearing you two. In reality, that’s only what it looks like.”</p><p>In the eyes of the world, Mysterious Queen was too stunning. Her popularity was too high, and thus, she was elevated to a new height. However, she herself didn’t think so. A titled monarch was a titled monarch. No matter how powerful a peak King was, there would still be a considerable gap compared to titled monarchs.</p><p>“This is not just a compliment for you. I, Jing Jiankong, haven’t reached the point where I need to praise others.” The Space Emperor shook his head. He indeed wasn’t complimenting the Mysterious Queen. In this era, there was no clear separation between peak Kings and titled monarchs. Moreover, the Mysterious Queen’s strength indeed didn’t allow one to look down on her. It should be known that at this stage, although the cultivation base, profound, and whatnot were strong, they were not absolute. There could always be some mysterious methods that could allow the weaker party to prevail over the stronger one. The realm of life and death was one of myriad mysteries.</p><p>Mysterious Queen shook her head with a smile and didn’t explain. Of course, she wasn’t confident in contending against the Space Emperor, but she had some assurance of being able to defend herself.</p><p>Retracting his gaze from the Mysterious Queen, the Space Emperor turned toward Ye Chen, “I, Jiang Jiankong, won’t bully the young, But, I’m not unconcerned about the life of my people either. Otherwise, I’ll have no subordinates left. You killed Wind Storm King because your strength was enough. But, in reality, you could have spared his life. Seems like my prestige is not enough in the continent.”</p><p>Although Space Emperor’s voice didn’t have a trace of killing intent, when Qin Liu and the rest heard him, their hair at the back of their necks stood erect, and Ye Chen’s breathing intensified,</p><p>“Space Emperor is making a move!”</p><p>“Space Emperor!” Mysterious Queen creased her brows.</p><p>Space Emperor replied without turning his head, “Little girl Yan, I can’t be unconcerned. But, you can be rest assured, I’ll not take his life, neither will I ask something impossible of him.”</p><p>“Then, you’re saying…?” Mysterious Queen felt a bad omen, but she couldn’t grasp the intentions of the Space Emperor.</p><p>“Senior, killing Wind Storm King was indeed impulsive of me. I wonder how I can compensate for it…” Ye Chen had no intentions of creating a dispute with the Space Emperor. Having a dispute with a titled monarch was a stupid thing to do. If he angered the latter, he would only lose his life in vain.</p><p>Space Emperor said meaningfully, “Don’t worry, this ought to be a good matter for you. You got an extreme grade sword, didn’t you?”</p><p>As soon as the Space Emperor’s words sounded, Ye Chen’s heart dropped. This was terrible! He didn’t expect that the Space Emperor could see through his storage ring. This was simply unfathomable and unheard of!</p><p>Just as he expected, when he looked around, everybody’s gaze on him changed. Some were filled with greed, some were sinister, and some filled with schadenfreude.</p><p>“Senior…” Ye Chen wished to speak, trying to make one final effort.</p><p>Space Emperor shook his head, “No need to test me. Your storage ring is only mid grade, so how can I not see through it? To live, one must pay for their sins through merits. Take out the extreme grade sword, or nobody under the heavens can save you.”</p><p>“A supreme grade sword indeed! I actually didn’t notice it.”</p><p>When Space Emperor spoke, Void Emperor also employed his means and saw through Ye Chen’s storage ring. The Sky Scorpio Sword was hovering at the center of the ring’s space, emitting a purple crystalline light as it was surrounded by small crystalline granules, looking magnificent.</p><p>“Space Emperor, this sword is Ye Chen’s own spoils of war. Your conduct is not impartial and fair. Apart from this extreme grade sword, I can fulfil your other requests in his stead.” Mysterious Queen would naturally not allow Ye Chen to hand over the Sky Scorpio Sword. Not to mention it would be a huge blow to her reputation, a supreme grade sword would make one’s heart bleed to part with. Once Ye Chen reached the Life and Death realm, his strength would be much higher with an extreme grade sword.</p><p>“Little girl Yan, you know I do what I say. I’ve already left you enough face. Otherwise, I don’t even need to act to make him disappear from the world.” Space Emperor’s voice turned cold.</p><p>“I’m of course aware of that, but your demand is too hard to comply.” Mysterious Queen shut his eyes. When she opened them again, they were cold. A multi-layered spatial gate appeared before her body, the number of layers simply uncountable.</p><p>“Interesting! Little Girl Yan, what do you think I’ll do now?” Space Emperor casually waved his right hand which had been behind his back. The surrounding space instantly warped and shattered, creating countless black creases. The surrounding Kings were all astonished, as the former had shattered the space without using Zhen Yuan. Such methods were simply unimaginable!</p><p>“You can do what you want to do!”</p><p>Mysterious Queen was clear that making him change his mind was even harder than ascending the heavens. In that case, there was no need to for any more words. She could only battle with all her strength.</p><p>“Good!” The Space Emperor loudly shouted and punched at her.</p><p>However, the Mysterious Queen was not afraid. The spatial gate behind her suddenly turned real, taking her within. From Space Emperor’s direction, she seemed to have gone to an imaginably deep area within the multi-layered door, one that couldn’t be reached throughout eternity.</p><p>Bang Bang Bang!</p><p>Space Emperor’s fist energy was vast and mighty, and the multi-layered spatial door instantly shattered. It seemed as if nothing could stop his fist energy.</p><p>However, although Space Emperor’s fist energy’s destruction was quick, the spatial door’s recovery was even faster. It maintained an equilibrium, not allowing the distance between Mysterious Queen and fist energy to reduce in the slightest.</p><p>“So, this is the mysterious Ten Thousand Layer Gate!” Space Emperor’s squinted, and his face gravened.</p><p>Seeing all this, the others were also in admiration and awe. The mysterious dao of the Mysterious Queen was deep and enigmatic. Compared to the founder of the mysterious dao, Mysterious King, she wasn’t inferior at all. As the saying went, ‘Indigo stems from blue, but is superior to blue.’ She had taken the mysterious dao even further beyond.</p><p>Watching from the sidelines, Void Emperor had a calm expression. To him, this exchange between the two was quite beneficial. This battle would give him an idea of the two’s bottom line.</p><p>“Mysterious Ten Thousand Layer Gate is known to be impenetrable, but it might not be able to hold me off.” Space Emperor’s aura turned even stronger. Evidently, he was intending to fight for real.</p><p>However, at this moment, his figure suddenly stopped, looking deep into the void.</p><p>“Haha…Jiang Jiankong, is there really a need to start a war over something like this. Why don’t we sit down and have a discussion?”</p><p>An incomparably frightening aura suddenly warped the space into layers. Then, a pressure even stronger than Void Emperor and Space Emperor’s pressed down from the sky. Not to mention experts below Life and Death realm, even some ordinary Kings couldn’t bear the pressure and felt their bodies turning heavy and restricted.</p><p>“How many years of cultivation base is this? Fifteen hundred years…Two thousand years?”</p><p>“It’s the Dragon King! Only Dragon King’s cultivation base can surpass the Space Emperor and Void Emperor.”</p><p>“Dragon King has also arrived. Seems like his closed-door cultivation succeeded!”</p><p>Everybody’s thoughts raced like lightning, immediately figuring out who had arrived.</p><p>Although the Dragon King was not a titled monarch, he was the oldest King of humanity. Nobody knew how deep his cultivation base ran. The only thing for sure was that his cultivation base far exceeded both Space Emperor and Void Emperor. Dragon King had always been the number one figure under titled monarchs. Some people even considered him a titleless monarch.</p><p>“Old Dragon King is also here!”</p><p>Qin Liu let out a sigh of relief, delight appearing on her face.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
