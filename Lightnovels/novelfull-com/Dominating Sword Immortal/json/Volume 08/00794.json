He was wounded the most by Ye Chen’s attack; however, he was different from that cold-looking young man, since the wound he had was not as deep and intense. So, he had almost fully recovered after swallowing a precious pellet he carried. As a half step king warrior, pellets to recover wounds within a short period of time should not be hard to find. However, it was indeed because of that why half step king warriors would have such a high requirement for top rank spirit stones and items, since their consumption was much greater than that of normal warriors.</p><p>Ye Chen wore that Evil shattering sword around his waist while walking in the back with Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>“The thirty-third floor might not be that simple.” Ye Chen had this vague feeling that these four extreme evil shattering items and the painting were not placed here casually. They must have their functions. The evil atmosphere of the tower was so rich, but up until now, they had not run into any danger yet. Hence, it was likely that on this unknown thirty-third floor might lie the greatest danger of all time.</p><p>Ye Chen giving up on the other three items was indeed due to consideration for this matter, since he could not control four items at the same time. Even if he could, he would not manage to bring out their peak power. Murong Qingcheng carried the perfect half step demon bloodline, and the woman in yellow was an unknown beast, so both of them naturally could not touch those items either.</p><p>Soon, everyone stopped at the end of the staircase.</p><p>A stone door had blocked their path. The stone door had complicated lines carved on it, each different in color. There were five of them altogether—gold, blue, green, red, and yellow. They all overlapped with one another before gathering at the center of the stone door. There was a dent there with five colors flashing together, connecting with the five lines.</p><p>“This is a five-line spell, it would need five lines of different energies to open.” Jin Wanshuang studied the spells and said.</p><p>“There are nine of us, but only three of us train elemental Zhen yuan based on the classic five elements. We cannot make up the five!” The elder frowned. Jin Wanshuang trained metal Zhen yuan, Lin Yuxuan cultivated the wood element Zhen yuan, and the lady in yellow trained water element. The remaining fire and earth zhen yuan could not be matched.</p><p>Ye Chen said, “They could be replaced by other items, right? For example, energy crystals.”</p><p>Jin Wanshuang nodded. “Indeed! Not just zhen yuanm but the energy crystals would work as well.”</p><p>He then took a step forward and said, “I will pour in the metal zhen yuan to see how much it requires really.”</p><p>He pressed his right hand onto the dent and accumulated his Zhen yuan before pouring in slowly. As he did so, the gold line was lit up on the door and slowly extended out.</p><p>Moments later, Jin Wanshuang said, “It is not working. This spell takes up way too much energy. Even if I burn out all of my Zhen yuan, it would not meet the requirement.”</p><p>Everyone noticed that the line on the door had been lit up not even by one-tenths of its entirety.</p><p>“It seems like we will have to use the energy crystals.”</p><p>The spell took up way too much energy. Even if there were enough warriors that trained the right element, it would not satisfy the requirement. In other words, if the nine did not have a huge amount of energy crystals, it would be impossible for them to get inside. The same went for the others.</p><p>“How about this? Each one of us tries to gather nine hundred gold element energy crystals and one thousand for the rest of the four elements. If we have any left, they could be returned back. If it is not enough, then we can just take out more later.”</p><p>The energy crystals were very valuable—one top rank crystal would be worth one thousand top rank spirit stones, which would make it very unfair if they only asked one or two people to provide them all.</p><p>After collecting all of the energy crystals, Jin Wanshuang put them all in.</p><p>It was obvious that the center dent on the stone door could automatically absorb the five elements energy inside the crystals while those five lines on the door were gradually lit up. With the dent as the center, they started to spread out slowly.</p><p>“It is not enough. We need one hundred stones for each element crystals.”</p><p>There was still a short portion on each line that had not been lit up, so Jin Wanshuang turned his head and said.</p><p>“Here.”</p><p>Everyone made up the numbers and Jin Wanshuang put them all in again.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>With that, the five lines were all lit up, and the stone door shone with five different colors. The light overlapped on each other, creating a five-line spell in the midair.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Just like that, the stone door was open.</p><p>“This spell really takes a lot, huh? It took up five thousand and four hundred energy crystals.” Daer Ba made a face. It was equal to five million four hundred thousand top rank spirit stones.</p><p>“Normal life and death realm warriors would not be able to break through it either in a short period of time, right?”</p><p>According to the amount of energy the door took, Ye Chen had thought about something else. With this spell guarding the door, not to mention half step king level warriors, even the normal Life and Death Realm warriors would not be able to break down the door. As for whether entering by direct space tearing could work or not, Ye Chen did not know,</p><p>Whoo!</p><p>The door was open completely, and a strong wave of evil wind came out of nowhere. Although the nine people had activated their Zhen yuan already, they were still blown backward by a couple of steps by the sudden wind. The blood inside their bodies seemed to have been frozen, and the coldness seemed to come with a hint of threat to the soul.</p><p>What the nine did not know was that the second the door was opened, a beam of five colored light column was shot up from the top of the tower. All of a sudden, the five colored light column broke through three hundred thousand meters deep ocean water and appeared above the surface of the ocean. It continued to shoot up, tearing apart the realm. There was no way of knowing where the light eventually landed.</p><p>Within a couple hundred thousand miles, everyone could see that this light beam that connected the ocean, the sky, and the realms above that. Most people could also sense the vibration of the place as well. However, due to the distance, they had no idea where this energy was coming from.</p><p>“Five element energy!”</p><p>Far away from the Four Square Island, black qi filled up the entire place as the demon king revealed himself. He closed his eyes and sensed carefully that energy vibration.</p><p>“This is the energy vibration from breaking a spell. There must be some kind of top treasure being discovered.”</p><p>The elder in black clothes hesitated for a bit before making up his mind to give up finding the perfect half step demon bloodline for now. This kind of opportunity was rare, so he decided to find the treasure first before searching for that perfect bloodline.</p><p>Pop!</p><p>The black qi disappeared, and the elder disappeared from where he was.</p><p>What the nine people did not know was that they had already attracted a demon king who was coming for them. But now, they had finally entered the thirty-third floor.</p><p>The second the gang entered the thirty-third floor, all of the light was lighted altogether. Meanwhile, they could see that there were five coffins in the center of the floor; the biggest one had four smaller coffins surrounding it.</p><p>The coffin seemed to be made with some kind of strange wood, and had got a very creepy evil qi coming out. From afar, they could feel a wave of evil qi trying to enter their body and freeze their blood.</p><p>“There is an item in each coffin.”</p><p>The twin brother’s eyes lit up. All of the items on the thirty-second floor were pseudo extreme level weapons, so there should be at least one extreme rank item on the thirty-third floor.</p><p>Besides a very small amount of people, the rest of them started to look desperate. They wished to just rush out already and get their hands on those items.</p><p>It was Lin Yunxuan who made the first move. He was the only one who did not get anything from the battle on the thirty-second floor, which frustrated him a lot. Before, he had never had any kind of failure like this. No matter what team he had joined, he was used to being the most powerful and talented warrior of them all. But in this group, he realized that he was at the bottom. None of them on the team were weaker than him, and some of them were obviously more powerful than him, which was something he could not accept.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>That bright protective Zhen yuan flashed as he rushed to the first coffin that was closest to him.</p><p>“Don’t be reckless.” Jin Wanshuang and the elder reminded him at the same time.</p><p>Lin Yuxuan sneered continuing traveling in high speed. “I am getting it!”</p><p>Within one flash, he appeared right next to the coffin. He reached out to grab onto the item which was a battle axe, and also one of the weapons that he wanted the most.</p><p>“So cold!”</p><p>As he grabbed the weapon, he suddenly shivered. This battle axe seemed to have been made with thousand years old ice as a wave of extremely cold qi followed his palm and reached into his arms. His whole right arm was covered by a layer of light blue ice cubes, which were bone cold.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>All of a sudden, the coffin in front of Lin Yuxuan suddenly got lifted up into the air as if someone had kicked off the lid. Right after that, a human figure appeared below and sat up. It was a pale, middle-aged man; both of his eyes were open, but there were no pupils within.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lin Yuxuan knew that something was bad and he hurried to back out. But, because of the evil qi invasion, his reaction speed was half his usual speed.</p><p>Pap!</p><p>The middle-aged man grabbed onto Lin Yunxuan’s right arm and pulled forcibly.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Lin Yuxuan yelled out as his entire right arm had been pulled down. There was no blood however, since it was frozen by the evil qi immediately.</p><p>As he pulled down Lin Yuxuan’s right arm, the battle axe landed in the middle-aged man’s hand. His whole body jumped out and his axe draw in the air, cutting off the other’s head.</p><p>“The undead?” Ye Chen squinted his eyes, his palm held onto the evil shattering sword.</p><p>The middle-aged man laughed while an endless suction power appeared from his body. The still-warm blood inside Lin Yuxuan splashed out and was sucked in by the middle-aged man. As the blood poured into his body, everyone could visibly see that the man’s face started to look livelier; at least it was no longer as pale as a mannequin before, and had started to look bouncy somehow.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The middle-aged man stood on the ground and waved his hand. With that, besides the coffin in the middle, the other three coffins were lifted open together, and the great items above them landed within as well. In the next second, something shocking happened as a human figure appeared within each coffin.</p><p>They were an elder, a tough looking woman, and a skinny teenager.</p><p>The three of them all held their own items as they jumped out of the coffins and then stood right next to the middle-aged man. An abundant evil qi poured out of their body, freezing everything around them.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
