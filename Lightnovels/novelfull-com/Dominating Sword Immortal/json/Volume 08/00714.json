He trained the powerful Red Cloud Palm Art, which was aggressive and brutal. Normal Sea of Souls Realm warriors would be shattered into ashes under his one palm attack.</p><p>A couple days ago, that aggressive vibration came from the deep parts of the ruin mountain, so he sent out one-thirds of his elite warriors toward the source of that vibration to search for it. Meanwhile, he was not resting on his own either, as he gathered all of the top warriors in the school and gave them countless valuable pellets and a couple of thunder fire exploding bombs, asking them to signal once they found something.</p><p>\"Leader!\"</p><p>A warrior rushed in through the front gate.</p><p>\"What? What have you got?\" The leader had a sharp light shining in his eyes. The man before him was indeed one of the senior masters he had sent out for the source.</p><p>\"Leader, our opportunity has come. In the deep part of the mountains, a massive moving forbidden place has revealed itself. It clashed with the space blockade, which revealed a hole. The natural yuan qi leaking from within was so rich that everything around it has been nourished.\"</p><p>\"It is covered in spirit plants and trees?\"</p><p>The leader gasped. A moving forbidden place would be almost endless! And obviously, the spirit plants and trees would only be decoration, but it was already enough to shock the world.</p><p>\"Alright! Once fortune strikes, there is nothing we can do to stop it. You, take us to the source immediately. After this is over, I will help you reach Late Seas of Souls Realm with whatever it takes. I will not forget your rewards on top of that as well.\"</p><p>\"Yes, sir! Thank you, leader!\"</p><p>The warrior looked very pleased. He had been stuck in the Mid Sea of Souls Realm for decades now, and he was limited by his experience and comprehensive ability. If he wanted to make to the Late Seas of Souls Realm, then it would at least take another few decades. Only with the leader's full support could he perhaps reach there in a short period of time.</p><p>The Ruin Mountains were not a massive area, incomparable to the one in the Northern Regions; it would only be a small fraction of the latter. But, the group of top warriors still spent three days before reaching the deep parts of the mountains.</p><p>They lifted up their heads and saw something shocking. A massive hole had appeared a hundred meters high up in the sky. It was strange in shape, with the top being hundreds of meters wide and the narrowest being seven or eight meters wide. It did not have smooth edges, only rough shattered cracks. Below the crack was a massive hole that no one knew where it would lead to. Colorful crystals surrounded the whole crack, making it look extra mysterious.</p><p>Looking into the gap, the leader's breathing hastened. The gap continuously poured out a rich natural Zhen yuan and energy. He could see countless strange shaped spirit plants growing inside the gap. After a certain distance, a massive tree could be seen growing there. These trees looked powerful and shone with the spirit light. Even the fruits growing on top were wrapped in qi flow of different colors. It was not hard to imagine how much power these fruits contained.</p><p>\"Low rank, mid rank…everywhere…There must be top rank spirit plants and trees in the deeper parts. This is indeed our school's opportunity!\"</p><p>The leader laughed out loud. Not to mention the kind of valuable items he might find within the moving forbidden places, even these spirit plants and trees alone would increase the general power of the whole school to a new level. Those spirit plants could be planted inside their medicine garden which could be harvested after every couple years. It would indeed be an immeasurable treasure for the school.</p><p>\"Everyone, don't make any moves yet. Let me check it out first!\"</p><p>He was the leader after all, and was not blinded by the wealth. He took out a low rank great sword from his storage right and shot out a beam of attack toward the gap.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>The low rank weapon had turned into a beam of flowy light and entered the gap smoothly.</p><p>\"Leader, it does not look dangerous!\" The elder right next to them said happily.</p><p>The leader said, \"No hurry! Let's try one more time.\" He then threw out another low rank item. However, it rubbed on the edge of the gap this time.</p><p>Shoo! Shoo!</p><p>A crystal thunder light flashed once, and the low rank item was shattered completely into nothingness.</p><p>He took a deep breath before saying to his people, \"Everyone, follow my lead. Remember, do not touch the edge of the gap, and try your best to enter through the middle!\"</p><p>It was obvious that the energy around the edges was too dense, such that once something tried to enter the crack, it would react and try to eliminate it.</p><p>\"Let's go!\"</p><p>The leader took everyone flying towards the crack. The protective Zhen yuan outside his body was burning red like a red crystalline layer that was protecting everyone.</p><p>The rest of them followed behind.</p><p>Although he knew that the center of the crack was not dangerous at all, the leader was still trying his best to be careful. The protective Zhen yuan had protected himself perfectly as thousand meters flashed within a second. He was just about to enter the crack.</p><p>It was right then…</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>That calm crack before suddenly started to shake drastically. Beams of crystal lightning and flames shot out from the edges of the crack, forming a massive power met and surrounding the group of warriors.</p><p>\"Back out!\"</p><p>The leader's face went pale as he hurried to yell out. Unfortunately, it was already too late. The attack net had shattered all of his powerful warriors within the second, and even he puked out mouthful of blood.</p><p>\"B*stard!\"</p><p>The leader's eyes were bloodshot. Half of the top warriors had been shattered into nothingness within the second. After this incident, the general power of the whole school had decreased by half. It would be demoted from a top rank 6 martial school to only a mid rank one, and that too just because of his existence.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Lightning, flames, and tornados all landed on his protective Zhen yuan. He looked like he had been struck by thunder as blood spewed out from different parts of his body.</p><p>\"No! I cannot die yet! As long as I am not dead, I can find enough treasures from that forbidden place and the school can still develop back to its former status. Perhaps, I can become a semi king warrior as well. By then, the school would only be more powerful.\"</p><p>Controlling his emotion, he did not back out. Instead, he reached forward and was about to make it through the crack.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>At that moment, a massive pile of pure fire ball landed on his body, and he was burnt immediately into ashes. Those broken top rank items and storage rings were sucked into the gaps of the edges. No one could tell where it went.</p><p>All of the warriors from the school were killed.</p><p>...</p><p>A couple of days later, the mountains received its second batch of guests.</p><p>There were only five of them this time—one teenager, three middle-aged men, and an elder. The teenager was wearing golden robes and crown, giving out the invincible brutality. It was indeed the head disciple of Surreal Martial School, Xia Houzun. The three middle-aged men were all master level Sea of Souls Realm warriors, one of which was the head elder Axe Master. The last elder in yellow robes looked like the leader of the group. He had a massive body which looked heavy like a mountain.</p><p>\"Great master, should we go in?\" One of the three middle-aged men asked the elder respectfully.</p><p>\"This gap is not simple. The edges contain the surreal energy, which will explode out surreal lightning. The fire and the tornados of the surreal space are so powerful that all of us will be killed without enough defense. You guys follow behind me…If anything goes wrong, back out immediately.\"</p><p>The elder was indeed one of the great masters of the school who was at semi king warrior level. Hence, his power was indeed unpredictable.</p><p>\"Let's go in then!\"</p><p>Xia Houzun's eyes brightened. This place would be his opportunity, also the key factor to decide his advancement into the semi king warrior realm as well.</p><p>\"Alright, let's go in!\"</p><p>The elder was not afraid of the surreal energy, so he flashed his body and flew toward the gap. Simultaneously, the four of them followed behind him.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Just as expected, the lightning, flames, and tornados seemed to have sensed their arrival and suddenly started attacking, throwing out unbearably bright attacks.</p><p>'Ah!'</p><p>Amongst the three middle-aged warriors, the one with the lowest defense power was shattered into ashes immediately by a pile of fireball and lightning.</p><p>\"Leave him alone…Let's go!\"</p><p>The elder was not having an easy time either. The surreal space energy would change the attacking power according to the warrior's power level. Although it might not reach beyond his limits, it would not be all rainbows and sunshine either. He had to have his full focus in trying to handle the incoming attacks. There was no time and effort for him to watch out for the men behind him.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>Soon, the remaining four reached through the gap successfully.</p><p>What was strange was that if looked at from the outside, no one could see the four people that had just gone in.</p><p>After the four had gotten in, another group of people arrived. Unfortunately, within this group of warriors, the most powerful one was only at the master level Sea of Souls Realm. They were all killed by the surreal energy before even reaching close to the gap.</p><p>Soon, a lot more people arrived and got killed. Rarely anyone made it into the crack in the air.</p><p>On the second morning…</p><p>Two human figures appeared near the mountain on the opposite side. These two were so powerful that it was impossible to tell their power level. They were indeed semi king warriors.</p><p>\"Ghost Wood King, this forbidden place has appeared this time. A lot of semi king warriors must have come for this. There might even be Life and Death Realm warriors. If you and I want to grasp this opportunity, then it will have to be now.\" It was a dark, skinny, short elder that was talking. His mouth was pointy, while the middle aged man standing right next to him had a skin that did not look human, but more like trees.</p><p>\"Gopher King, you like to take advantage of people so much. If you do it again to me, then I will break your legs.\" The middle-aged man said lightly.</p><p>The short elder chuckled, \"I will not this time…Definitely not this time. There are a lot of precious items inside the forbidden place. I will not need to do that at all.\"</p><p>\"Let's go! I hope you are right.\"</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the deep mountain yard somewhere in the Sky Martial Region, a teenager with glaze pattern on his head arrived at the place.</p><p>\"Wind Elder, Tian'er is here to see you.\" The teenager's voice spread out.</p><p>Soon, the gate cracked open.</p><p>\"It is Tian'er!\"</p><p>It was a skinny elder who came out. He had long hair that reached over his shoulders. He smiled at the sight of the teenager. The latter said, \"The Top four extreme emperors' grave is out! Teacher had asked me to accompany you there.\"</p><p>\"Already? Perhaps that vibration is the omen?\" The skinny elder thought of the vibration he sensed a couple of days ago. \"Alright. You and I will go over there together.\"</p><p>The elder nodded as he closed the gate door and walked next to the teenager toward the source of the vibration. Soon, the two disappeared into the horizon.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
