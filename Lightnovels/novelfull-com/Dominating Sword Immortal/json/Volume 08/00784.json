Swinging their axes and machetes, they were barging through without a care. The armored warriors that bumped into them were knocked left, right, and center. However, they were different from Lin Yuxuan. They relied mostly on brute strength, not wasting much Zhen Yuan. Although their auras were majestic, their Zhen Yuan consumption was quite pitiful.</p><p>As for the middle-aged woman, she seemed somewhat unable to deal with numerous armored warriors. It could be seen that her techniques were insidious and exquisite, giving her an advantage in one against one or one against two. However, when confronted with one against many, she seemed unable to deal with it. Fortunately, her movement arts were quite good. She was always able to dodge the armored warriors’ strikes at the crucial point, and was at the rear of the group.</p><p>As for Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng, they were also in the rear of the group. Ahead of them were the two brothers, while behind them was the middle-aged woman.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng could rely on her speed to survive. Speed was her natural talent; hence, she was calm and unhurried.</p><p>Clang Clang Clang Clang!</p><p>Ye Chen seemed to be having a stroll in the garden. He waved his sword seemingly slow but fast in reality, each wave seeming just perfect. The moment armored warriors were about to pounce, he would strike. Therefore, it seemed that these armored warriors were delivering them to his sword to be chopped. It was just a feast for the eyes.</p><p>Up to this point, the middle-aged woman still looked down on Ye Chen somewhat, considering that the latter didn’t have much ability except soul power. However, watching the current Ye Chen, she certainly didn’t think so. Amongst the eleven, the most relaxed was Ye Chen without a doubt. It was not because he was the strongest, but because his insight and timing were a cut above the rest.</p><p>‘This kid has some skills. He’s not that easy to deal with. If something occurs later on, I better see how the wind blows first.’</p><p>The point of life they were at, judging a situation was an extremely important matter. To create a dispute with someone they were not confident in dealing with was an irrational and stupid decision.</p><p>The armored warriors swarmed like tides, and the group an iron boat sailing across, cutting through the tides. After a few minutes, the group reached the other side of the cloister. They turned around and saw the armored warriors confined inside. The next moment, their bodies glowed before merging with the pillars flawlessly.</p><p>“Is everyone fine?” Jin Wanshuang let out a breath, then swept his gaze through the group and asked.</p><p>“We’re good. Let’s move on!”</p><p>The armored warriors were more like an appetizer to them, more scary than dangerous. Any person in the group was a figure nearing the paragons of half-step King realm wherever they went. How could a pile of metal junk that was incapable of even thinking dissuade them?</p><p>“Good to hear that.”</p><p>Jin Wanshuang continued to lead the group. He himself didn’t believe that the incident just now was anything significant. He had carefully pondered before inviting every single person in the group. Of course, he had merely invited a fraction of hidden experts that were present in the teahouse at that time.</p><p>Passing the cloister, the group arrived in the central hall. The central hall seemed like an aisle and resting spot. There were a few lounges on both sides, and nothing except that. The group directly walked out of the central hall through the passage across.</p><p>As soon as they stepped out of the central hall, their feet stopped. Entering their eyes was a vast expanse of forest, divided into two parts by a small pathway in the middle. Numerous red dots flickered in the forest, as if countless fireflies were flying about.</p><p>Without a word, Jin Wanshuang took a deep breath and walked forth.</p><p>The small secluded pathway was covered in heavy mist that seemed immeasurably thick. The trees on either side were exceptionally lush, emanating a tranquil feeling—one that carried a trace of deathly stillness.</p><p>“How pretty!”</p><p>A ‘firefly’ flew down the tree, heading to the younger brother’s shoulder while incessantly flickering. Attracted by the firefly, he reached out to grab it.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>An intense explosion occurred, and the violent currents made the feet of the other members unsteady as their eyes squinted. The younger brother’s whole right hand turned black, emitting cyan smoke.</p><p>“Little bro!”</p><p>The elder brother jumped in fright.</p><p>“F*ck, the firefly exploded!”</p><p>The younger brother tilted his head and smiled at his elder brother. He slightly shook his right hand, and his clothes that had turned into ashes, scattered down, revealing his skin inside.</p><p>“What a powerful flesh!” Ye Chen’s eyes squinted.</p><p>The firefly explosion was quite frightening, no less than a full power strike of an ordinary half-step King. The younger brother’s hand was fine even after clenching it. It could be seen how frightening his physical defense was. If it had been anyone else, they would have more than likely lost an arm.</p><p>“This is a Detonating Firefly!” The old man’s eyes opened wide as he spoke while emphasizing every word.</p><p>“Detonating Firefly?” Others looked at him with puzzled faces.</p><p>An alarmed expression appeared on the old man’s face, “A terrifying worm that existed in the early ancient era, and is currently extinct… A single firefly exploding will attract all the other fireflies. Leave this forest immediately if you want to live.”</p><p>“Leave? Where?”</p><p>Everybody looked ahead and then behind; both sides were covered in thick mist. If they were to move forward, they didn’t know where they would end up. On the other hand, the distance they had covered was not less either. Moreover, they had come to seek treasures. How could they just retreat like that? Of course, compared to their lives, retreating didn’t seem too bad either.</p><p>“Forward!” Jin Wanshuang expression turned determined before his body shot forward.</p><p>“Follow him.”</p><p>At this moment, unity was paramount. However, in the next moment, they saw countless light dots streaking across the mist, heading straight toward them. Everybody’s feet stopped, exchanging glances.</p><p>“Come, we still have right and left.”</p><p>“Don’t tell me they are forcing us back?”</p><p>Huff!</p><p>As everybody was discussing, the two brothers had already acted. Axe light and blade light chopped at the deep mist like thunderbolts.</p><p>Bang Bang Bang…</p><p>Unceasing explosions shook the heaven and earth, and magnificent flames illuminated the entire forest. The mist on the small pathway was swept away.</p><p>With that, everybody gazed ahead and couldn’t help but take in sharp breaths. There was no end in sight. All they could see were Detonating Fireflies covering the heaven and earth. They even had some huge, fist-sized fireflies with tails flickering in blue.</p><p>On the other hand, although their rear had fireflies as well, they were far too sparse compared to their front, not even a hundredth. The right and left sides also had somewhat more fireflies than rear.</p><p>Jin Wanshuang turned his head and said, “This is the only way. We can either go forward or retreat. If we retreat, this ruin will have nothing to do with us for the time being, unless we can find a solution to these fireflies. Since we’ve come together, we’ll decide together as well. Those in favor of advancing, take a step forward…Those in favor of retreating, take a step back.”</p><p>The fireflies were quickly approaching, fluttering up and down in the air. They didn’t have much time.</p><p>“Forward!” The cold-looking youngster was first to decide and stepped forward.</p><p>“Me too, forward!” The yellow-robed woman was the second.</p><p>“Same.” Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng also stepped forward simultaneously.</p><p>In the end, only the old man and the middle-aged woman were left undecided. Lin Yuxuan hesitated for a while but ultimately stepped forward.</p><p>“Nine against two. Our decision has no meaning anymore.” The old man took in a deep breath, calming his mind.</p><p>“Then…go forward!” The middle-aged woman had a bitter expression. She couldn’t bear to head back alone. She would always regret the lost treasures after all.</p><p>At this moment, the old man said, “Detonating Fireflies are attracted by blood Qi. Only when they are near us would they target us. Our speed is surely not bad. We don’t need to try fighting them.”</p><p>“In other words, if blood Qi is suppressed, they won’t approach you?” The yellow-robed woman suddenly said.</p><p>The old man bitterly said, “How can it be so easy? Suppressing blood Qi before these things is useless. As long as you’re living, they’ll sense your blood Qi fluctuations.”</p><p>The yellow-robed woman merely smiled in response.</p><p>‘Could she really do it?’ Ye Chen sensed the ‘not bothering to reply’ expression flickering on her face, and it made him suspicious.</p><p>“Alright! Since everybody has agreed, let’s begin! Don’t be mindful of others and bring out all our defensive equipment. Don’t fear being wasteful.”</p><p>Jin Wanshuang activated his defensive armor and held two shields in each hand—one big and one small. The bigger one was as big as himself, while the smaller was also around a meter tall.</p><p>Others also had no shortage of treasures. Like Jin Wanshuang, they activated their armors and held their shields. They seemed like soldiers armed to the teeth, about to charge into the battlefield.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>The group of eleven shot forth with their highest speeds. However, due to the interferences of the incorporeal powers within the ruins, their speed was only one percent of their normal speed in the outer world.</p><p>Detonating Fireflies were extremely sensitive to blood Qi. Due to the group using Zhen Yuan, their blood Qi fluctuations had turned even more richer. Hence, the fireflies shot toward them one after another, covering the sky in flickering red dots.</p><p>Bang Bang Bang!</p><p>Blazing flames surrounded the group, occasionally accompanied by metal explosions, which were the sounds of fireflies crashing into the shields.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Ye Chen threw the scrapped upper-grade shield toward a horde of fireflies and immediately took out a new one. Meanwhile, the scrapped shield disappeared into a luminous explosion.</p><p>The rate of shield consumption was too high, as even upper grade shields couldn’t endure for long. Only half-step extreme grade shields were able to hold these explosions back somewhat. However, shields were originally a rare breed of artifacts. Everybody in the group had merely a few half-step extreme grade shields at most. They would be willing to take out one, and nobody would be willing to sacrifice one in these explosions. Thus, they were consuming upper grade shields at a rapid pace. In about ten breaths, the group had sacrificed dozens of them, which was a terrifying sight to behold.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>Suddenly, an explosion ten times more powerful erupted, completely disrupting their formation.</p><p>Ye Chen gazed ahead. At some point, those huge fist-sized fireflies with cyan-colored glowing tails had joined the assault. Their explosions were ten times more powerful than the ordinary fireflies.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
