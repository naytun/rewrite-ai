It is not like this has never happened before. There had been more powerful warriors here…But as long as they thought about robbing the Zhen yuan crystals, none of them had a good ending.” The Tough King sounded cold.</p><p>“Are you threatening me?” Ye Chen smiled gently, his gaze sharp like blades.</p><p>Sensing Ye Chen’s sharp killing intent, the Tough King did not dare to be too arrogant as he said, “It is not that I am trying to threaten you, only a small portion of the Zhen yuan crystals we took end up belonging to us. Most of them have to be handed over. As for to whom, I think you know it already.”</p><p>Each zone would have to hand in different portion of the Zhen yuan crystals. The Tough King was ranked high up in the top five, so he got twenty percent of all the Zhen yuan crystals they gathered, while the remaining eighty percent would belong to the Black Water alliance. For the black mountain zone, they could gather around two thousand four hundred Zhen yuan crystals per month, and twenty percent would be around four hundred and eighty pieces, which was already quite a lot. For some other weaker zones, the leader would only take about ten percent, or even just five percent.</p><p>This month, the Tough King had already taken quite a few Zhen yuan crystals. If Ye Chen took all of them, then he would not be able to meet the quota for the Black Water alliance. By then, they would go after him for sure.</p><p>“Don’t worry! By then, I will talk to the Black Water alliance.” Ye Chen had already thought of it. Although he knew that the Tough King was the leader of the dark power party in the black mountain zone, but when he opened his storage ring, he was still rather shocked.</p><p>The Tough King’s Zhen yuan crystals filled up a small chest, which had no less than five thousand of them. It would equal five hundred million top rank spirit stones on the crystal island.</p><p>The Tough King had a bad look on his face. There were five thousand and four hundred Zhen yuan crystals inside the chest in total. Only six hundred of them were collected, while the remaining four thousand and eight hundred were all his own. And it was an accumulation over many years.</p><p>On the devouring island, a half step king warrior would have to hand in one hundred Zhen yuan crystals per month while they would make about one hundred and thirty or forty pieces. The Tough King belonged to the average level warriors, so he could only make one hundred and forty of them per month, and he would have to hand in one hundred of them, then another thirty for the black water alliance. In the end, even if he did not use any of them to train or gather more Zhen yuan crystals, he could only collect about a dozen of them. But, because he was the leader of the dark power party here in the black mountain zone, he would have a lot of additional income. Although eighty percent of the collected Zhen yuan crystals would still belong to the alliance, twenty percent would go to his party. And as the leader, he of course got the most out of it. He would have thirty percent of the twenty percent, which would be an additional one hundred pieces for him per month.</p><p>So, those four thousand and eight hundred pieces would take him at least four years of time. If he used them for training, then it would take about five to six years.</p><p>“Don’t say that I have not gone easy on you, I have left you one hundred Zhen yuan crystals.” Taking out the chest, Ye Chen took everything besides one hundred pieces.</p><p>…</p><p>“How many Zhen yuan crystals have you gotten?” On the way back, Ye Chen asked Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>She replied, “Most of them were with the Tough King, plus I also left some with them. So, I got about eight hundred of them now.”</p><p>“Not too bad! It would add up slowly after all.”</p><p>Ye Chen was very happy with what they managed to walk away with.</p><p>“What are we doing now? I guess the alliance would be after us soon.”</p><p>Ye Chen said, “With us alone, I think it would take at least fifty years before we are able to leave the island. You and I both do not have that time. As for becoming a Life and Death Realm warrior, there are just way too many uncertainties. Therefore, these dark power parties seem to be a great option.”</p><p>“You plan to get them all?”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>Ye Chen was not the kind of person who would just follow the rules blindly, since the rules were made by people and were meant to be broken. If he did not think it was necessary, then he would just simply ignore it.</p><p>…</p><p>“Where is the claw shadow king living?”</p><p>After arriving at the Black Meadow zone which was right next to the black mountain zone, Ye Chen captured a Sea of Souls Realm warrior and asked.</p><p>“Seven or eight miles in that direction.” The warrior had been captured and could not move at all, so he said in panic.</p><p>“Thank you!” Ye Chen let go of the person.</p><p>The leader of this region was a warrior being referred to as the Claw Shadow king. According to the rumors, he was even weaker than the Tough King.</p><p>Arriving in the Claw Shadow king’s place, Ye Chen did not even waste time to talk as he threw out a punch directly at the house.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The ground was shaken and smoke was brought up in the air.</p><p>“Who is looking for death?” A figure flew out.</p><p>But right then emerged a beam of cold sword light. The light flashed once before Claw Shadow King’s body was blown backward into the air, and he puked out a huge amount of blood.</p><p>It would be impossible for the other warriors not to know what was happening over here due to the big commotion. Unfortunately, they were not even able to see anything before their visions had been blocked by dark shadows and their bodies were blown backward into the air as well. As they did so, they saw that beautiful lady with black wings extending out from her back.</p><p>“Who are these two people? They are like my idols right now beating the Claw Shadow king and his followers immediately and leaving them no chance to fight back!”</p><p>After Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng left the place, everyone who came to see what had happened was shocked and impressed at what was left behind.</p><p>“How much?” Ye Chen asked Murong Qingcheng casually.</p><p>“Six hundred and fifty.”</p><p>“Not too bad! I have three thousand eight hundred.”</p><p>…</p><p>There were thirty zones inside the No.3 devour islands. With black mountain zone being the central one, the remaining twenty zones had been wiped through, leaving only a couple of major zones behind.</p><p>After going through more than twenty dark power parties, Ye Chen had gotten fifty thousand zhen yuan crystals, if it were just him alone, then he could just hand them over and would be set free by the holy spirit. But of course, it was all under the condition that the holy spirit did not lie to them.</p><p>“Fifty-two thousand and one hundred Zhen yuan crystals.” Murong Qingcheng had just finished counting all of the crystals.</p><p>“Amongst the remaining three zones, the yellow sand zone and the iron valley should not be worried about, but that green water zone’s Explosive Fire King might be a bit tricky.”</p><p>Being able to be considered as “tricky” to take on would mean the warrior should be at least at top half step king warrior level.</p><p>“Yeah! Rumors say that when he first came to the island, he was already at top half step king warrior level. And he has been here for about a decade, during which, it would be impossible for him to have no growth at all. Besides all that, he was also one of the first formed dark power parties. If it were not for the fact that the alliance did not want him to be too big, he might have already gotten all of the No.3 devouring islands.”</p><p>“It is indeed tricky, but our luck should not be that bad.”</p><p>What Ye Chen worried the most was that he was already at the highest level for half step king warriors. Although the devouring island would not allow too much freedom, there were more than enough Zhen yuan crystals, especially for these leaders; there should be endless supplies for them. Although Ye Chen had already reached peak level Late Sea of Souls Realm and was still growing rapidly, he would still be a far away from the highest level for half step king warriors.</p><p>“It does not seem to this easy to get to that level. The comprehensive ability would matter the most.” Murong Qingcheng was also a bit worried.</p><p>Hearing her, Ye Chen thought that it was a good point, “No need to think about this for now. Let’s go take care of those two other parties.”</p><p>…</p><p>Outside the iron valley zone…</p><p>Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng had already gotten the address for the Explosive Fire king and were rushing that way now. Ye Chen chuckled. “The major zones are big indeed. The two dark power parties had provided us with fifteen thousand Zhen yuan crystals already. I wonder how much this guy has.”</p><p>“Haha…it is our first time doing this kind of ‘robbing’ business, isn’t it?”</p><p>“Power matters the most in this world. So, instead of being the people that follow the rules, we might as well try to be the ones that make the rules even if it is just for a small region.”</p><p>Although Ye Chen might be friendly and polite most of the time, he had been a person of power even before he came to this world. He would not actively try to cause troubles, but he was not afraid of troubles either. He had this righteous qi with him right from the start, hence it did not take him long before fully adapting to this world.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng knew him very well. Right from the first time she met him, she could sense that there was something different about him, but she never managed to figure out what it was. As they spent more and more time together, she slowly realized that Ye Chen was the type of person who could adapt to any kind of environment. He was like a plant that looked so humble that it could be easily missed, since it was not eye-catching like flowers, but was definitely more durable. He was like a great sword; he might not look as sharp normally, but once it reached the right time, he could kill the opponent directly with one sword attack. Even if he was placed in the worst situation of all time, he would be able to live really well, and no one could steal his thunder.</p><p>The stars were not as bright as the sun or the moon, but once one arrived into the space, then one would realize that this star would be much bigger than the sun and the moon.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>The Iron Valley Zone was the top zone of the No.3 devouring island. Its population was a couple of times more than the black mountain zone. Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng were flying too straightforwardly, so they had triggered the attention of the Explosive Fire King’s followers.</p><p>“We are looking for the Explosive King.”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng increased her speed as she flapped her wings and shot out like a dark ghost. The followers were blown backward while puking out blood.</p><p>“Get down here now!”</p><p>A blue shadow jumped out of nowhere, throwing out a blade light toward Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The powerful wave of attack appeared and this warrior was blown away as well. Both of his feet deeply sank into the ground.</p><p>“Powerful!”</p><p>The person that attacked Murong Qingcheng was the strongest warrior below the Explosive Fire king. He had been here for many years and managed to reach half step king realm. Due to the fact that there were just so many warriors here, it would always be better to follow the Explosive Fire King than the other zone leaders. Plus, the Explosive Fire king was the most powerful. Even the Black Water alliance would not dare to pressure him too much. Therefore, he had never thought of becoming one of the dark power party leaders himself.</p><p>He thought before that with his power, it should not be hard to take on Murong Qingcheng at all. But, he did not expect to lose his upper hand right at the beginning of his battle.</p><p>“Iron Six, who is causing trouble?”</p><p>Inside the mountain in front of Ye Chen, a beam of fire flowed out as a voice was heard. It was a deep and low voice, but somehow gave people the feeling like a volcano was about to explode.</p><p>“Boss, you better come out for a bit.” Iron Six did not think he could take down the two people.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The second he finished his sentence, the mountain shook gently and a beam of bright fire light shot out from the top. It was only one flash before he arrived right next to him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
