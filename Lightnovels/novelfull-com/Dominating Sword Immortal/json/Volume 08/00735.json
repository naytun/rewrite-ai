Ye Chen used his powerful soul while Jiang Tian relied on his control on nature.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>With five times more powerful soul power, Ye Chen was doing it all effortlessly. He counted his traveling route while controlling his flying sword to attack Jiang Tian.</p><p>It was very obvious that Jiang Tian was just as relaxed about calculating the traveling route. He continued to wave his palm to block out the flying sword, making a tingling sound.</p><p>“It is Tian’er? Who is chasing him?”</p><p>One thousand meters away, the elder took the sensing jade tag out of his storage ring. The jade tag had got a red dot flashing rapidly, which meant that Jiang Tian was traveling at a high speed. Otherwise, the red dot would not flash with such a frequency.</p><p>“No matter who this is, he is dead for sure.”</p><p>The skinny elder squinted his eyes with a cold light flashing within. In his eyes, only some of the famous half step king warriors would be chasing after Jiang Tian. Although Jiang Tian’s symbol killing spell was a killing attack, the soul of a half step king warrior would already be at changing point, and they would have formed a thin soul layer. So, his symbol killing spell would not help him in killing his opponent’s soul; he could only wound it if he tried very hard. And with his own power, he was only at a normal half step king warrior’s level.</p><p>Putting away the sensing jade tag, the skinny elder flashed his body once, disappearing where he was like a wave of wind.</p><p>Ye Chen noticed that within the stone room where he was, Dantai Mingyue had already left. Iron hand king walked out as he shook his head and said with a low voice, “Inside the wolf king’s pellet training room must have been a lot of precious items. I wonder who beat him and got all of them. Only if I had come here faster, then I could have killed that warrior and obtained whatever he got.”</p><p>The stone room had got a lot of battle scars. It would be impossible for the Iron Hand king to not notice that there had been an epic fight.</p><p>“I hope I will have better luck later.”</p><p>He activated his Zhen yuan as he flew toward the other side. It was indeed where Ye Chen and Jiang Tian had gone.</p><p>…</p><p>“Ye Chen, your death is almost here.”</p><p>With only one wall blocking between them, Jiang Tian could already sense the elder’s presence. This discovery had made him stop immediately. He turned around and looked at Ye Chen with a cold look.</p><p>“So, you are only like this when you know you have someone to save you’re a*s?”</p><p>Ye Chen did not have Jiang Tian’s nature controlling power, but within the grave, his soul power was compromised as well. He used his soul eyes and scanned the room. Soon, he could see a human figure shooting out for him through the walls. Although it was not as clear as desired, but judging from Jiang Tian’s expression, that skinny looking elder must be the Storm Wind king after all.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The skinny old man did not choose to go around the wall. Instead, he decided to break through directly and appear in Ye Chen’s vision. He was about to say something before he saw a beam of thunder light. That highly compressed black light ball was shooting at him.</p><p>After figuring out this was more of an enemy than an ally, Ye Chen did not want to spend time talking anymore. He threw out a compressed thunder devour attack directly before turning around.</p><p>Pooh!</p><p>The elder waved his hand to shatter the black light ball as he sneered, “Do you really think you can get away from this?”</p><p>As he spoke, the Storm Wind king waved his hand. In the end of the tunnel, walls of wind barriers appeared, stopping Ye Chen from leaving.</p><p>“This is the Storm Wind King’s power. I think it is not weaker than the Punishment king.”</p><p>Ye Chen broke through one wind wall after another. However, the walls were appearing too quickly. When he shattered one wall, another would form on time.</p><p>“Tian’er, what is going on?”</p><p>After blocking Ye Chen’s path, the king warrior did not attack immediately. He was confused, since Ye Chen was only peak level Mid Seas of Souls Realm warrior. Normally, it would be impossible for such a person to be Jiang Tian’s opponent. But, judging from the previous situation, it was Ye Chen chasing after Jiang Tian somehow.</p><p>Jiang Tian had a bad look on his face as he said, “His power is not weak and my symbol spell is not working on him. Plus, he knows a kind of killing qi blood secret art that can ignore my defense power.”</p><p>“What? Perhaps it is the blood ghost finger attack?”</p><p>The elder immediately thought of the dragon king’s martial art. That finger art was very unpredictable, as it would ignore all defenses and rules. Judging from its killing power, it should be even more powerful than the symbol killing spell. If it were trained to the major completion, then the trainer could even kill Life and Death realm warriors with only half step king warrior level power.</p><p>“Young man, if you hand over the ghost finger secret art, I will let you live.” A light flashed once in his eyes as the storm wing king thought of something.</p><p>“Elder!”</p><p>Jiang Tian did not plan to let Ye Chen live. He was nothing like the other arrogant martial geniuses, as he only wanted results. If he could kill Ye Chen with his own hands, that would be ideal. But if he could not, then he wanted the other dead regardless of the method.</p><p>“No rush. After getting that ghost finger secret art from him, I will kill him.” Storm wind king passed on a message via Zhen yuan.</p><p>“Blood ghost finger art?”</p><p>Jiang Tian suddenly understood, then he nodded and smiled at Ye Chen, “Right now, there is only one way for you. Hand it over, or you will die.”</p><p>“You guys have heard about it as well?” Ye Chen’s expression did not change.</p><p>The Storm Wing King combed his beard with his hands and said, “The famous blood ghost finger…Of course I know it…everyone knows about it. I, Storm Wing King, do what I say. Hand over the secret art, and I will spare your life.” He thought secretly as he spoke, ‘There is no need to keep my word to a dead man. It is just the rules of the wild.’</p><p>“Alright.” Ye Chen answered without hesitation.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Both of them were a bit surprised. The blood ghost finger was extremely rare and valuable, but somehow, Ye Chen had agreed without even thinking about it. It was something that they found it hard to believe.</p><p>However, they were soon mad.</p><p>The second Ye Chen said that, he threw out a finger attack, hurting the two’s blood qi. It was especially severe for Jiang Tian, who had already lost quite a bit before. And now that he was attacked again, his legs went numb, and he almost sat on the ground.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>On the other side, the storm wind king had his qi and blood boiling and his control diminished drastically. Meanwhile, Ye Chen performed his flying sword and attacked through the wind walls.</p><p>“You are looking for death!”</p><p>The Storm king was furious. He threw out a palm attack toward Ye Chen with that horrifying palm power which could not be traced at all as it landed on Ye Chen’s back.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Ye Chen’s armor could not handle this powerful attack at all, Ye Chen could feel his internal organs move all at once while dozens of his bones had been broken. He puked out a mouthful of blood with chunks of organs. He had never been hit with this level of force before. Normal top master level warrior would have been killed for sure by this attack.</p><p>“Eh? Still not dead?”</p><p>The Storm king followed right behind. Seeing that Ye Chen was still flying at high speed, he was shocked. It would be impossible for him to think of the fact that Ye Chen had trained the immortal body, and his survival ability was horrifyingly powerful.</p><p>“I will see if you will die from this or not.” The storm king threw out another punch at Ye Chen’s back.</p><p>Ye Chen, who did not have the time to dodge, got crushed into the wall in the end of the hall. There was a path on both side of him.</p><p>In the left tunnel, Iron Hand King flew over at him. Seeing that Ye Chen had been hit badly, he was rather shocked. He gently sensed it before finding out who did this.</p><p>“Storm king, I will give you a big gift.”</p><p>Iron hand king had been frustrated from the fact that he was not able to kill Ye Chen and his group. But right now, the opportunity lay right in front of him, so he planned to kill the other first before stealing his storage ring.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Iron hand king threw out a punch and that massive iron first landed on Ye Chen’s body from the side.</p><p>“Iron hand king, this graveyard will be your graveyard.”</p><p>After being hit three times in a row, Ye Chen could feel his life slipping through his finger. With his surprising will power, he forced himself to stand up and shoot out through the tunnel on his right.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>Both the Storm king and Iron hand king were shocked. They were not normal half step king warriors; they were the top warriors among their peers. Not to mention a peak level Mid sea of souls realm warrior, even normal half step king warrior would not have survived this. But, Ye Chen did somehow.</p><p>It was especially surprising since they could sense that Ye Chen’s internal organs had been hurt quite a bit. All of his meridians had been shattered, just like the bones in his body. Normally, it would be impossible for him to walk; but somehow, Ye Chen could still fly at a high speed. Compared to before, he seemed to be even slightly faster. It was as if he was burning up his last bit of power.</p><p>But, only Ye Chen knew what was really going on.</p><p>The immortal body let him have a surprising survival ability. But the immortal body alone would not allow him to fly at this high speed when he was on the verge of dying. What he used was his tough will power to power through.</p><p>Inside the secret pavilion of the Dragon God palace was a secret art called the Survival Will art, which allowed the trainer to increase his will to survive in the most critical moment. The reason that Ye Chen did not choose it back then was because he believed that he would not give up under any circumstances. Therefore, it did not mean much if he chose it or not.</p><p>With his horrifying will power, he ignored his broken internal organs and all of his shattered meridians, as well as those broken bones which could no longer lift up his body, as he moved rapidly in almost another life form. In that situation, his speed was still somehow faster than ever before.</p><p>“This guy cannot be left alive.”</p><p>The Storm king and the Iron hand king both took a deep breath, the killing intent in their eyes not to be ignored.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The two of them threw out a killing attack and that aggressive qi flow scraped down layers after layers off the walls before eventually landing on Ye Chen’s back.</p><p>A dent appeared on the back of Ye Chen while those shattered bones stabbed into his organs. That armor of his made a cracking noise as if it was about to break at any second. He roared with a low voice, swallowing the blood forcibly way back. It was indeed the moment to not let go an inch. As for these people, Ye Chen knew that he would kill them for sure. But before that, he needed to find a place and increase his cultivation to Late Sea of Souls Realm.</p><p>The Storm king and Iron hand king were not Jiang Tian or Ye Chen, so their speed was limited in the tiny tunnel. Therefore, after another couple of hard corners, they had lost sight of Ye Chen completely.</p><p>“This brat is so damn scary.” Iron hand king was both shocked and furious.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Storm king started to relax on the other side. He thought that it was rather funny, since it did not matter much if Ye Chen successfully ran away. He was not afraid of his revenge at all. He kind of wished Ye Chen would seek revenge so he could take him out for good.</p><p>“He cannot run forever, as he still has company here. As long as we get them, it would not be hard to get him.”</p><p>The Storm King could not forget about the Blood Ghost finger.</p><p>“It is not that I am afraid of him. Even if he recovers, I can kill him with one hand.” Iron hand king said with an evil undertone.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
