They also had a few extremely expensive treasures, but they only occupied little corners.</p><p>Summing it all together, there were five million upper grade spirit stones, more than a hundred herbs of different kinds, five thousand upper grade artifacts and crystals combined, and the most expensive thousand supreme grade spirit stones.</p><p>Dividing evenly, Ye Chen gave Sun Tianlang one million and six hundred thousand upper grade spirit stones and three hundred and thirty supreme grade spirit stones; it was the same for Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>“To think I’ll get three hundred and thirty supreme grade spirit stones.” A smile appeared on Sun Tianlang’s grave face. Half step Kings lay between Sea of Soul realm and Life and Death realm, and could use both upper grade spirit stones and supreme grade spirit stones. The former made their progress extremely slow, while the latter allowed them to improve rapidly. Prior to this moment, Sun Tianlang only had a total of fifty supreme grade spirit stones, and he was quite reluctant to use them for cultivation. On the other hand, a million and six hundred thousand upper grade spirit stones didn’t attract his attention much.</p><p>Sun Tianlang’s gains were not small, but were nothing compared to Ye Chen’s.</p><p>Ghost Wood King, Gopher King, and Shadow King had a total of six million upper grade spirit stones and eight hundred supreme grade spirit stones. Adding the currently gained upper grade spirit stones and supreme grade spirit stones, Ye Chen had gained a total of seven million and six hundred thousand upper grade spirit stones, and one thousand two hundred supreme grade spirit stones.</p><p>Before entering the forbidden zone, the upper grade spirit stones Ye Chen had were even more than most Half step Kings. His journey had been filled with numerous fights and kills, and thus, the wealth he’d obtained was naturally more than what normal people could imagine. Adding the current gains, his upper grade spirit stones had astonishingly crossed the mark of twenty million.</p><p>Of course, his biggest gain this time was neither the enormous amount of upper grade spirit stones, nor a thousand supreme grade spirit stones, but the pseudo extreme grade defensive artifact. Of course, at face value, he could definitely purchase one with twenty million upper grade spirit stones. However, the crux was that these artifacts had prices but not markets. Regardless of how many spirit stones one had, one couldn’t purchase them. It should be known that even ordinary Life and Death Kings didn’t have these artifacts, and had to make do with semi extreme grade ones.</p><p>East Emperor City’s Gu Clan was considered as one of the most ancient clans. Hence, it was not too surprising for them to possess pseudo extreme grade artifacts. For Qin Liu to possess one was quite lucky, probably obtained from fifth grade or even fourth grade ruins. Without an opportunity, they were impossible to find.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng suddenly reminded, “Ye Chen, that Bronze Armor had Iron Hand King’s soul imprint. If not erased, Gu Clan might be able to track it.”</p><p>“You’re right!”</p><p>Ye Chen faintly nodded and said to the two, “Guard the surroundings for a moment. The Iron Hand King was a Half step King, and his soul had gradually changed. Erasing his soul imprint won’t be easy.”</p><p>Ye Chen’s soul was rather unique, five times as powerful as that of same grade Sea of Soul realm Masters. It was above Half step King’s in quality, and was comparable to Life and Death Kings. However, half step Kings would have formed soul membrane, and he didn’t. Ye Chen guessed that the soul membrane was a unique result born in the later stages of soul. Without reaching a certain realm, this change wouldn’t occur.</p><p>To erase Iron Hand King’s imprint, he would have to employ various tricks.</p><p>“Rest assured, leave it to us!”</p><p>Sun Tianlang put the large number of spirit stones away with a grave face. If Iron Hand King’s soul imprint couldn’t be erased, this armor would be nothing but a hot potato which could bring them a calamity at any moment. After all, once they left the graveyard of the Four Extreme Emperor, Gu Clan’s kings would certainly rush over.</p><p>Taking out the Bronze Armor, Ye Chen sucked in a deep breath and violently invaded the armor with his soul power, seeking the whereabouts of the Iron Hand King’s soul imprint.</p><p>Generally speaking, the core of the artifact’s formation was generally the optimal position to brand the soul imprint. The other places were not impossible, but doing so would reduce the ease of artifact’s control, and it would feel somewhat sluggish.</p><p>As Ye Chen had expected, the soul imprint was at the core of armor’s formation.</p><p>Confronting the invasion of Ye Chen’s soul power, the soul imprint fiercely struggled, even drawing the armor’s own powers to resist.</p><p>“Scatter!”</p><p>How powerful was Ye Chen’s soul power? It could even compare to ordinary Life and Death Kings. The soul power quaked, and the armor’s power that the soul imprint had just drawn scattered immediately. Moreover, receiving this quake, the soul imprint itself began to waver.</p><p>“Refine!”</p><p>Seizing the opportunity, Ye Chen’s soul power poured in, charging to the core of armor’s formation and assaulting soul imprint.</p><p>If Ye Chen’s soul had been ordinary, he would have not been able to do anything to the soul imprint in the short term. To successfully erase it, he would have to spend at least a month. However, Ye Chen was a genius of the soul. His soul power’s quantity and quality far surpassed Iron Hand King’s, not to mention, his opponent was merely a left behind soul imprint.</p><p>After a few minutes, the soul imprint dimmed, and the soul power within began to evaporate strand by strand.</p><p>Ah!</p><p>Although the soul imprint didn’t have consciousness, it had the most basic instincts. The moment it was about to be erased, it let out a soul cry and evaporated.</p><p>Getting rid of Iron Hand King’s soul imprint, Ye Chen easily branded his own soul imprint at the core of armor’s formation. And his soul imprint was much stronger than Iron Hand King’s, even a Half step King would have to spend several days to get rid of it.</p><p>Successfully implanting his soul imprint, Ye Chen immediately poured his Zhen Yuan. The armor immediately lit up with an ancient glow, and bronze runes bobbed up and down within this glow.</p><p>“Success?” Sun Tianlang and Murong Qingcheng looked over.</p><p>“Yeah.” Ye Chen nodded.</p><p>Sun Tianlang astoundedly glanced at Ye Chen. He thought that the latter would at least take two hours to wipe Iron Hand King’s imprint off. And this was merely because Ye Chen was extraordinary. If it had been someone else, they wouldn’t even dare imagine succeeding before a month.</p><p>“Someone is coming!”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng had her innate demonic eyes opened. Everything within three thousand meters was within her eyes.</p><p>Ye Chen put the armor away, not wearing it, “Who is it?”</p><p>“It’s the Thunder Spirit King!” Murong Qingcheng said to with creased brows.</p><p>“Thunder Spirit King? We better leave first.” Ye Chen waved the Thunder Disaster Sword, turning the corpses of Storm King and Iron Hand King into nothingness. His body flickered and shot toward a tunnel at the open land’s edge along with Murong Qingcheng and Sun Tianlang.</p><p>The Thunder Spirit King was one of the strongest Half step kings, invincible under the Life and Death realm. Ye Chen didn’t wish to come across him. After all, who knew if he had some relationship with the Wind Storm King or Iron Hand King.</p><p>As Ye Chen and company left, Thunder Spirit King’s figure appeared in the void.</p><p>“Eh? A huge battle happened here?”</p><p>Thunder Spirit King swept his gaze. The sword scars on the ground and the holes in the wall, nothing remained hidden from him. An astonishing battle had happened here, and strength of both sides was quite high. Therein were traces of destruction that only a peak Half step King could bring about.</p><p>“Interesting!”</p><p>Among the people that had entered the graveyard, there was only one other peak Half step King—the Punishment King. Although the Wind Storm King’s strength was approaching Punishment King’s, there was still some difference, and he could barely be considered a peak Half step King.</p><p>“Apart from Void Shattering Finger, only White Sheep King and Sky Scorpio King impart space profound martial skills among the four Fiend Kings. Hope there are some gains in White Sheep King’s graveyard next.” The Thunder Spirit King’s target was only the space profound martial skills. Other things had no relationship with him at all.</p><p>…</p><p>Outside the graveyard of Gray Wolf King, people rushed over every now and then—some from conveyor gates while some from tunnels. The number of people kept increasing. One day it was fifty to sixty, and the next day, it increased to seventy-eighty.</p><p>“Everybody says that the nearer you get to the graveyard, the greater is the danger. Then, how come we didn’t encounter any danger all the way?”</p><p>“Perhaps they are only rumors to scare people off?”</p><p>“I don’t think so. I’m afraid there is something shady going on.”</p><p>“What could it be? Gray Wolf King graveyard’s entrance is already open, so we can head right in.”</p><p>Swish Swish Swish!</p><p>Like a locust, numerous Half step Kings and peak Sea of Soul Masters rushed inside the graveyard.</p><p>Shua!</p><p>After a moment, a flickering green light beam streaked in.</p><p>Nearing the graveyard, the light beam revealed its true body. It was an aged and extremely haggard white-haired old man.</p><p>The white-haired old man’s aura was heterogeneous—both auras of tree-like vitality as well as gloomy deathly aura tangled with each other, seeming bizarre.</p><p>“My lifespan is about to be over. If there are no gains here, I’m afraid my death is not far.” The old man sized up the Gray Wolf King’s graveyard for a moment, then entered with a flicker.</p><p>…</p><p>In the graveyard of Fire Bird King, four inhuman silhouettes were flickering across. If Ye Chen’s group saw these four silhouettes, they would certainly feel their blood go cold. They were none other than Shadow Ghost Bat King, Undying Swamp King, and the two Predators.</p><p>After Ye Chen and company had entered the graveyard, these four sinister creatures had hunted sufficient Half step kings, and were intending to enter the graveyard and try their luck. They didn’t wish to guard outside the graveyard for their entire life. They yearned for the world outside.</p><p>And precisely because they headed in, the people that came later didn’t face any danger.</p><p>“Humph, my strength has recovered to its peak. There is nobody capable of killing me anymore.” Shadow Ghost Bat King seemed in high spirits. His strength was above the other three, and he was also the leader of their group. He was more than capable of obtaining many treasures in the graveyard, then leave the forbidden zone with the help of others.</p><p>If he had the chance, he might even claim the position of Demon King.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
