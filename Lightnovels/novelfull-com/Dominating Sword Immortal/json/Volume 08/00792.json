However, since they got to be placed on the second highest floor in this tower, then it should not be lower than half step supreme level. With Ye Chen’s estimation, even the pseudo supreme level rank might be possible.</p><p>Of course, it would be reckless for any of them to start fighting for it before they could be sure about the rankings.</p><p>“He is right!” Jin Wanshuang took a deep breath and started to look calmer and calmer.</p><p>“Then, how can we make sure of the ranking? I don’t trust anyone else to confirm it. If it needs to be done, then I will have to be the one doing it.” Lin Yuxuan said.</p><p>“Yeah, who knows if the first person that went to check on is going to try to keep it for him or herself. Although he or she might not dare to take all of them, but stealing one or two and fleeing while the others fight for the rest of them would be possible, and no one would be able to stop the person by then.” Daer Xiong was not as reckless as he was perceived to be.</p><p>“Very simple. We can attack the great items from afar, then the items should start to show their true power to block out the attacks.” Ye Chen said lightly.</p><p>The great items had power themselves as well. However, the power was more passive, so it could not attack people actively. Nonetheless, it would be activated to protect itself when under attack.</p><p>“Great. Let’s do that!”</p><p>Ye Chen’s suggestion had been accepted by everyone.</p><p>“I can do it!” Jin Wanshuang stood out and tightened his right fist before throwing out a fist attack.</p><p>Pooh!</p><p>A vague explosion was heard in the midair. That unbreakable fist power shattered the stone table immediately and the aggressive qi flow blasted onto the walls before bouncing back, blowing those four items and that ink paining into the air.</p><p>Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo!</p><p>The great sword, the monster hunting stick, the purple gold cloth, and the jade ruler all exploded out with an intense power. Different color lights shone in the air, amongst which, the great sword shone with a red light, golden light for the monster hunting stick, purple gold light for the purple gold cloths, and a holy white light for the jade ruler. The four colors layered over one another, and the air in the entire floor became sticky like water.</p><p>Strangely, the ink painting seemed to be made by some kind of special paper, as it was not damaged at all under that blasting waves, and neither did it release any light. It was still just looking ordinary. However, it was opened after the external force touched the painting, showing a bird view of some landscape.</p><p>“Half step supreme rank items, all four of them!” Everyone’s breathing increased.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>It was almost the second when the ranking was confirmed when an intense wave of blue energy appeared out of nowhere. Lin Yuxuan’s eyes was red as he activated his Zhen yuan and a powerful destructive power appeared, shattering the still air caused by the half step supreme rank items. He then turned into a sharp arrow, shooting for the items.</p><p>“How dare you fight for things that belong to us?” The twin brothers roared. All of their muscles tightened and a flowy light appeared on the surface of their skin, looking almost solid. Next, they bent their knees slightly before shooting out like two massive gorillas; their speed was surprisingly not much slower than Lin Yuxuan’s. Meanwhile, they had taken out their weapons as well, preparing for a death battle when necessary.</p><p>The three of them had quick reflexes, but so did the rest of them. Jin Wanshuang released a bright silver light, turning into a metal man. His body, his fists were all his weapons; his pair of eyes seemed cold like metal.</p><p>The elder’s flying art was also light and fast. His black robe opened up, making him look like a massive bat. He would not give those great items to anyone else right now. Whoever dared to stop him could not blame him for being cruel.</p><p>However, the lady in yellow clothing whom Ye Chen could not figure out frowned slightly, then somehow crossed her arms in front of her chest while taking a step back. She watched the others fight for the great items, since she had no plans for battling right now.</p><p>Just like the lady, the cold-looking teenager did not try to fight for the items either. He seemed to think that he just got healed up, so there might not be much chance for him to get anything anyway.</p><p>But of course, this was other people’s opinion. Actually, he was really worried about Ye Chen deep down in his heart because what he wanted out of the four was that great sword with bright red light. But, since Ye Chen was also a sword artist, he thought he would definitely fight for it. And he knew that he was in not state fighting with Ye Chen right now.</p><p>“Ye Chen, I will not go. You should hurry.” Murong Qingcheng frowned and shook her head.</p><p>Ye Chen glanced at the lady in yellow and then looked at Murong Qingchen, seeming to have figured something out, “Alright.”</p><p>A pair of sword wings formed on his back and his body flashed once, turning into a beam of sword light flashing through the air. Even though he had only started moving, he managed to catch up with the first five people.</p><p>Lin Yuxuan was the first one moving after all, so he made a grabbing gesture, trying to grab onto the only long weapon—the monster hunting stick.</p><p>“Let go!”</p><p>However, the twin brothers also had their eyes on the stick. The older brother of the twin Daer Xiong waved that massive axe of his, throwing it toward Lin Yuxuan.</p><p>“Damn!”</p><p>Lin Yuxuan had no choice but to wave his battle axe and block out the incoming attack. As a consequence, his whole body was blown into the air.</p><p>“Brother, I will guard this area for you. You go get it.” Daer Xiong said to Daer Ba.</p><p>“Alright!” The latter roared with a low voice as he jumped at the stick weapon.</p><p>“Apologies, but this item is also my first choice.” Jin Wanshuang who had turned into metal man threw a punch at Daer Ba.</p><p>“If you want to get to him, you will have to pass me first.” Daer Xiong intercepted in front as he lifted up his axe horizontally, blocking out the fist power.</p><p>“Hehe, I just want that purple gold cloth.”</p><p>The elder smiled gently, setting his target at the cloth item that was slightly above the stick. With his flying art, he could get it within a second.</p><p>“Dream on!”</p><p>Although Lin Yuxuan wanted the stick weapon the most, but he was not going to watch other people get the item they wanted. He threw out dozens of attacks at once, and a blue dragon vaguely roared in the air.</p><p>Dang!</p><p>The elder and Lin Yuxuan exchanged a powerful attack, and the shockwave spread out. Everyone within the area had been blown backward by one step. All four items and that ink painting had also been blown into the air, their order getting messed up.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>It was right then when a beam of sword light appeared out of nowhere, shooting toward the bright red sword that was not far away.</p><p>“Brat, stop!”</p><p>Daer Ba had his fingertip almost touching the monster hunting stick. He had not expected that the blasting wave would appear out of nowhere and shake the stick out of his hand. Seeing that Ye Chen was about to get the sword and the painting, he chuckled while slicing with both blades, shooting out two beams of blade light.</p><p>“Shadow Explosion!”</p><p>Ye Chen’s body exploded in the air and countless shadows spread out. Beams of blade light flashed past, shattering a huge number of shadows while his real body was only steps away from the ink painting.</p><p>“Wind Eighteen Attack!”</p><p>Daer Ba’s attack landed nowhere, but the elder’s attack arrived already. That black short stick in his hand shoot out countless shadows, attacking straight toward Ye Chen.</p><p>Ting! Ting! Dang! Dang!</p><p>Ye Chen and the elder exchanged couple of attacks, but no one could do any damage to the other.</p><p>All of a sudden, it was pure chaos on the thirty-second floor of the tower. The six people fighting for great items did not want anyone else to get the items, so they attacked each other, trying to slow each other down.</p><p>“The ugly truth of human nature…” Leaning against the walls, the lady in yellow smiled coldly.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng said, “You did not fight for the great items because these items contain the kind of qi that breaks evil qi, which is what you have, right?”</p><p>“Hehe, I trained beast power. And you have trained…not zhen yuan for sure. If I have guessed it right, you should be carrying the perfect half step demon bloodline from the half step demon race. So, that would make it demon power, which would be even more sensitive to those kind of qi, right?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng was not surprised that she knew who she was, and she did not plan to hide anything either.</p><p>“The half step demon race came from the demon race, so you guys should prefer evil, dark power. How did you guys end up together? That sword qi of his is so full of positive, righteous power as if nothing could ever break thtough, which is almost the polar opposite of your power.” The lady wearing yellow blinked and said curiously.</p><p>“So, where do you think the half step demon race came from in the first place?” Murong Qingcheng answered with a question.</p><p>“Eh…”</p><p>The lady struggled for words and then smiled instead.</p><p>The half step demon race naturally came from the marriage between members of demon race and human race. If the demon race member could marry human race member, then she with her perfect half step demon race bloodline could very well get together with s human.</p><p>While the two were talking, the cold looking teenager was sitting in the corner, healing his wounds in silence. This kind of calm and concentrated mindset was indeed rare and precious. If it were someone else, they would be intrigued by the items and not be able to focus at all, even when knowing that he could not get it.</p><p>“He is really powerful. When he first got here, no one had thought that at all.” The lady in yellow studied everyone in the center, and Ye Chen soon caught her attention. Judging on power, Ye Chen was indeed no weaker than anyone else here, since he actually had the lowest cultivation of them all, at only peak level Late Sea of Souls Realm.</p><p>“He has not started yet.” Murong Qingcheng said quietly.</p><p>“Oh!” The lady glanced at her.</p><p>“Brother Ye, your power is indeed quite alright, but you are still slightly weaker.”</p><p>The four items kept overlapping together, leading the battles reaching their peak moments. Jin Wanshuang and Ye Chen, who were closest to each other, started battling. Jin Wanshuang was one of the most powerful warriors of the whole group besides the lady in yellow, and seemed to even be the most powerful. Silver light shone through his body, turning him into a silver colored metal man.</p><p>“Hehe, let’s take care of the one with the weakest cultivation first.”</p><p>Lin Yuxuan made up his mind, landing his eyes onto Ye Chen. No matter if it was logical deduction or out of personal reasons, he thought he should get rid of Ye Chen first. Logically, because Ye Chen had the weakest cultivation, his defensive layer would be weak, or at least it would not be as powerful as theirs. Personally, Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng’s relationship had kind of been pissing him off, and it was jealousy at play as well.</p><p>Therefore, preventing Ye Chen from getting anything would make him feel great.</p><p>He waved up his battle axe as he also attacked toward the latter.</p><p>“I guess us brothers will join as well!”</p><p>Although the twin brothers always seemed so reckless and short tempered, they had always been really well-considered. With one out of six people gone, the difficulty of getting anything would be lowered drastically.</p><p>The elder did not risk to fight for the items, since he was afraid that he would piss of everyone else, and they would turn against him. He knew he would be wounded badly if he tried to take everyone on with his own power. Seeing everyone else trying to attack Ye Chen together, he was naturally happy. His black short stick shot out a beam of power attacking toward Ye Chen as well.</p><p>All of the sudden, all five of them attacked Ye Chen.</p><p>“Shameful!” Murong Qingcheng was furious.</p><p>“I guess I will have to use that attack now.” Ye Chen had no other choice. He had not expected that he would be pushed by “his people” to use that move.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
