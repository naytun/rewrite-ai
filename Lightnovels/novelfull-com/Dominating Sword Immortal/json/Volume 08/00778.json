At this point, they didn’t unleash a combined assault, because it would encompass both the enemy as well as the six half-step Demonic Human Kings leading them.</p><p>“She’s coming! Use the external formation of Six Way Array. As long as we have a few more moments, this kid will die many times over.”</p><p>White Nightmare and the rest had constantly been paying attention to Murong Qingcheng. their complexion changed when they saw that the five hundred Sea of Soul clansmen were unable to stop her. Each of them took another Zhen Yuan restoring pill and steered the Six Way Cloud Polation with all their might. Black mist rose, activated by the six linked slender chains, and created a second membrane, allowing the six to be between the two membranes.</p><p>In response, Murong Qingcheng’s palm assumed the shape of a blade and chopped.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>The membrane fiercely shook, causing the faces of the six to go pale.</p><p>“Eh? It didn’t break!”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng frowned. Without stopping her advance, her two hands formed seals at a speed that made the space between her hands seem to be covered in an illusory sphere. At the same time, a boundless and profound black energy ripples emanated from her body.</p><p>“Dark Devourer!”</p><p>Finishing the seals, Murong Qingcheng jerked her hands across.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>Outside the membrane, an incessantly rotating black energy sphere appeared. It seemed like a black hole emitting astonishing attracting force, twisting and warping the membrane. Under this frightening attractive force, the membrane seemed to swell one moment, then deflate in the next, been continuously on the verge of crumbling completely.</p><p>“Don’t you dare!”</p><p>With a roar, the six poured in their Zhen Yuan, stabilizing the membrane.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng snorted and formed seals again, releasing the second dark energy sphere. Under the two sphere’s joint assault, the membrane could no longer resist and exploded with a bang.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>As soon the membrane was breached, the six spurted out mouthfuls of blood one after another, their Zhen Yuan going berserk.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Taking advantage of this opportunity, Murong Qingcheng issued a palm strike at Duo Long, who was nearest to her. As long as one was injured among the six or the slightest bit of disharmony appeared, the Six Way Array would not hold.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Without any choice, Duo Long stopped attacking Ye Chen and dodged to the side, evading Murong Qingcheng’s palm energy. As soon as he moved, a hole appeared in the Six Way Array. Sword flickered, and Ye Chen rushed out of the hole.</p><p>“Whew, you made it in time!”</p><p>Ye Chen looked somewhat miserable. His clothes had many tears, and his corner of mouth had slight bloodstains. Fortunately, these were only external injuries. With the Immortal Body, these injuries didn’t mean much to him. Of course, if Murong Qingcheng had been a little lat, the consequences would have been much worse.</p><p>“Why didn’t you interrupt me?”</p><p>Seeing five hundred Sea of Soul realm demonic humans and six powerful half-step Demonic Human King outside made Murong Qingcheng suck in a breath of cold air, and her tone was slightly reproachful. Confronting such a force, Ye Chen’s first action should have been to interrupt her breakthrough and then escape together instead of placing himself in danger to buy her time.</p><p>“Don’t worry! You should trust me more. It’s not as if I don’t have my trump card. It’s just a little inconvenient to reveal it.” Ye Chen was speaking about the Sky Scorpio Sword.</p><p>“You…If I had been a little late, even the Sky Scorpio Sword might not have saved you.” Murong Qingcheng sized up the six half-step demonic human Kings, then the five hundred Sea of Soul demonic humans who stood tall and proud, and couldn’t muster words to express herself. This kind of force was nothing to joke about.</p><p>“Let’s get out of here first. I should be able to open a path.” Murong Qingcheng’s breakthrough allowed Ye Chen to let out a sigh of relief. Thinking back, his decision was right. Things were going in the right direction. Now, only the enchantment was left to deal with.</p><p>“You think you can leave just because you want to?”</p><p>The six were immensely attracted by Murong Qingcheng’s aura. Her aura was far superior to the perfect demonic vessel possessors of their clan. It seemed like she had the most perfect demonic vessels, without a trace of defect.</p><p>Since they had run into such a perfect blood vessel demonic human, how could they let her off? They must bring her back to the clan.</p><p>“Young lady, I belong to demonic human clan, and you have perfect demonic blood vessels. As long as you return with us, I can guarantee that you’ll become the saintess. This would be much better than drifting about with him. I believe you’ll make the right choice.” Duo Long patiently persuaded.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng said, “I have my own clan. I have no need to enter the Chaotic Demon Ocean’s branch.”</p><p>“Hehe…If I’m not wrong, you must hail from the True Spirit Continent’s demonic human clan. The truth is that they are too weak, and are lowering the prestige of us demonic humans. Not only you, the entire demonic human clan of the continent will enter my Chaotic Demon Ocean’s branch.” Duo Long faintly smiled.</p><p>“Then, why don’t we talk at that time?” While speaking, she silently grabbed Ye Chen’s hand and was accumulating demonic power. At that moment, Ye Chen immediately realized her intentions.</p><p>“That doesn’t sound too good. Why don’t you come to my clan as guests first?” As long as the two entered their domain, nothing else would matter.</p><p>“Umm…escape!”</p><p>In the midst of her speech, her wings suddenly flapped. A ring of black light emanated from her body before she streaked toward the enchantment’s border with Ye Chen. Her speed was so fast that only a black flicker could be seen, seeming no different from teleportation.</p><p>“Damn it, stop her!”</p><p>The six were already guarded against Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng’s escape. The moment the two disappeared, they whipped the chains at them. The Six Way Cloud Polation was, after all, a pseudo extreme grade artifact, and its speed was incomparable.</p><p>However, Murong Qingcheng’s speed was not much slower than it. Adding on the lead gained by moving first, regardless of how fast they tried to steer the Polation, it could only slowly reduce the distance and was unable to issue a strike.</p><p>The island was not small, but how big could it be? In a few moments, Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng arrived before the enchantment’s boundary while the Six Way Cloud Polation closely followed them behind.</p><p>“Void Shattering Finger!”</p><p>Using the space profound, Ye Chen slashed at the enchantment’s barrier before him.</p><p>The enchantment’s barrier was merged with spatial power and was hard to see with naked eye. However, under the assault of the Void Shattering Finger, the space around instantly warped, bulging outwards.</p><p>Pop!</p><p>A spiral channel appeared before the two, the insides of which seemed like shattered glass. This was the frozen appearance of the spatial power.</p><p>“Hurry up!”</p><p>With no time to lose, the two rushed at the spiral channel.</p><p>“How is this possible? He can actually break the enchantment’s barrier?” The six’s faces turned pale. The Hidden Fog Enchantment was a rare enchantment array of the demonic human clan. Although they knew that Ye Chen comprehended the space profound, with his cultivation base and realm, it should have been impossible for him to break the enchantment. However, the scene before them clearly told them how wrong they were.</p><p>The reason Ye Chen could break the enchantment was not just his space profound; he also had soul eyes. With the ability of the soul eyes, he could instantly see the imperfect regions of the enchantment. After all, not all people supporting the enchantment were equally skillful. By only relying on this ability, Ye Chen believed that he had a good chance of breaking the enchantment.</p><p>And he succeeded indeed!</p><p>Without requiring any orders from the six half-step Kings, the five hundred Sea of Soul realm demonic humans had already begun their assault the moment Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng escaped. The moment the two entered the channel, hundreds of attacks arrived like a torrential rain covering the sky.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>However, the two were one step quicker and entered the channel.</p><p>Bang Bang Bang!</p><p>The attacks landed on the enchantment and the channel. With bursts of deafening explosions, the channel began to crumble, chasing after the two.</p><p>“Open the enchantment, hurry!”</p><p>Through special means, Duo Long conveyed his order to the demonic humans outside.</p><p>Although the demonic humans outside didn’t know what had happened, they could feel the enchantment shaking. Somebody had broken the enchantment and was about to come out. Therefore, the moment they heard Duo Long’s command, they immediately stopped operating the enchantment and scattered their Zhen Yuan.</p><p>Pop!</p><p>The layers of mist scattered with the strong winds above the ocean. The entire island suddenly appeared in the world, creating a mystical scene.</p><p>“The enchantment has disappeared!”</p><p>Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng suddenly felt the pressure on them removed. The entire island had returned as it had been, no longer obstructed by anything.</p><p>“We’ll talk after we escape this place.”</p><p>Without the enchantment’s interference, Murong Qingcheng’s speed increased sharply. With a flap of her wings, she sped off with Ye Chen like a streaking black colored ray.</p><p>Escaping for dozens of li, Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng suddenly felt a crisis coming their way. They turned their heads, and their faces immediately changed.</p><p>In their line of sight, a several meters thick and unaccountably long black chain was frantically flying toward them. Wherever it went, the ocean water was plowed out, white clouds scattered, and many small islands flipped and disintegrated into dust. The might of this chain was simply terrifying.</p><p>The source was in White Nightmare’s palm. At some point, the Six Way Cloud Polation had again turned into one entity. White Nightmare operated his Zhen Yuan at full force as he whipped the chain.</p><p>En-route, the chain enlarged by multiple times, creating the scene from a moment ago.</p><p>“So, this is the true might of the pseudo extreme grade artifact Six Way Cloud Polation! Its previous form could form an array, but caused its might to scatter, only providing the amplification of semi extreme grade artifacts.”</p><p>At this point, Ye Chen finally realized the terror of a true pseudo extreme grade artifact. Bronze armor was also a pseudo extreme grade artifact. However, Ye Chen’s cultivation base was too low. While he had easily resisted the Six Way Cloud Polation, he indeed felt something amiss.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>Soon, the peerless aura of the Six Way Cloud Polation engulfed the two.</p><p>“Waning Moon!”</p><p>“Demonic Finger!”</p><p>Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng used the strongest moves at their disposal and attacked the chain.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
