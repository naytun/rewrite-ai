The reason they could hold on was that first of all, the SIlvermoon Whitefox race was far more agile and nimble than ordinary people. Secondly, the white fox phantom behind the white-robed woman’s body was quite mystical. The silver-crescent moon on its forehead would emit a silver halo once in a while, and any clan member that made contact with this silver halo would have his or her battle strength greatly increased, making them fearless of death.</p><p>However, demonic humans did not merely have advantages in numbers; they had an advantage in skill as well. The reason they were tangled in the battle for so long was because they didn’t wish to lose a single member and score a total victory.</p><p>If nothing unexpected happened, the Silvermoon Whitefox clan would not able to raise any waves.</p><p>“What! Iron Bone died!”</p><p>The middle-aged demonic man, who had not used his full strength since the beginning, shifted his attention toward Ye Chen and was barely able to see Iron Bone sinking down while clutching his neck and blood spurting out through the cracks of his fingers. On the other hand, Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng seemed to not have lost a single strand of hair. This scene stunned him thoroughly.</p><p>Although Iron Bone’s strength was inferior to his, the former’s bone armored defense after demonic transformation was something he didn’t dare to underestimate.</p><p>“No need to drag it out. Kill everyone except her.” He promptly decided to quickly settle the battle. He would first capture the white-robed woman, then reorganize his manpower before dealing with Ye Chen and Murong QIngcheng with full power. He would make them pay a disastrous price.</p><p>As he spoke, he was not idle himself either, thrusting the bowl-thick long spear in his hands toward the white-robed woman’s chest.</p><p>The white-robed woman’s cultivation was not weak at all; she was a true half-step Demonic Beast King. Her movements were agile as she slashed out with her sword with her clothes fluttering.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The evil-dragon like spear image and silver-colored semi-circular sword Qi collided, creating an eruption of billions of light rays.</p><p>Puff!!</p><p>The white-robed woman was naturally quite above the middle-aged man in agility, but she was quite weaker in terms of battle strength. A brief exchange made her feel as if she was struck by lightning. She couldn’t help but spurt out a small mouthful of blood, and her white clothes were stained red at chest.</p><p>“Be defeated!”</p><p>The middle-aged man’s eyes turned sinister as his demonic arm vigorously swept the long spear toward the white-robed woman. Confronting this thunderous strike that had tens of thousands of jin behind it, the white-robed woman, who had lost the key moment, was about to be struck squarely.</p><p>Dang!</p><p>Right at this moment, a crescent-moon shaped sword energy streaked across from far away. It seemed like a dazzling aurora and also like the celestial moon devouring the moon. It arrived in a blink and chopped at the middle-aged man’s long spear. The long spear left the hand and flew off while the skin between the man’s thumb and forefinger was torn. The flying longs pear pierced through demonic humans like candied meat being skewered on bamboo sticks in a straight line. Moreover, the crescent-moon sword Qi, which still had power to spare, went berserk. It spouted energy while covering the middle-aged man and majority of demonic humans. They were all blasted out, creating a miserable scene of death.</p><p>At the crucial point, Ye Chen had acted and had used his move with a peerless might, Waning Moon.</p><p>Ah!</p><p>The white-robed woman cried out in alarm, frightened by the scene before her.</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>The Silvermoon Whitefox clan, who suddenly felt pressure on them greatly reduce, turned their attention to Ye Chen, who was holding longsword and had attacked from several li afar.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Merely one sword made the demonic humans suffer disastrous casualties, and only a few were left of the original twenty. The middle-aged demonic man, who was bleeding from the skin between his fingers and had his chest smothered, had been forced several li away. His entire skeleton was about to shatter, especially his two arms which had burnt most of the impact. He was almost unable to lift them.</p><p>Raising his head, he resentfully stared Ye Chen and said grimly, “You’re dead! Nobody dares to provoke my Demonic Human Clan in the Chaotic Demon Ocean.”</p><p>“Do unto others, do unto you.”</p><p>If he had not taken the initiative to provoke Ye Chen, Ye Chen would not have acted so harshly. But, since he held killing intent, Ye Chen couldn’t be blamed.</p><p>“Hmph! Let me see how you will kill me.”</p><p>The middle-aged demonic man faced the sky and roared, causing sinister-looking black rings to spread out. As if alive, these rings curled around the other injured demonic humans beside him. Amidst their blood curdling screams, the black rings sucked out their blood, Qi, and essence, then entered the middle-aged demonic man’s body.</p><p>Crackle…</p><p>The middle-aged man’s outer body was twisted and swollen as if countless snakes were wriggling underneath his skin, looking extremely nauseating and cruel.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The middle-aged man’s demonic Qi was already quite heavy. But once he absorbed blood, Qi, and essence of other demonic humans, his demonic Qi immediately made the sky change. Black clouds converged and black lightning flashed unceasingly.</p><p>Bang! A black lightning bolt struck the middle-aged man’s body. As his demonic Qi was restrained in his body, everybody could see his appearance.</p><p>Demon!</p><p>He was no longer any different from a demon. Dark cutin covered his skin, while curved and sharp bones protruded out of his elbows, shoulders, knees, and ankles. His feet and palms had turned into claws and fingernails had become dark purple blades. His eyes had become scarlet, without a trace of white.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The middle-aged demonic human, who had undergone a complete demonic transformation, roared at Ye Chen. This roar no longer had any human feature to it, only left with cruelty and cold-blooded ruthlessness.</p><p>“Careful…a demonized demonic human almost loses his reasoning. But at the same time, his speed and strength increase sharply. It’s the same as overdrafting one’s vitality and potential. And his regenerative ability can go up by ten folds.” As a demonic human, Murong Qingcheng was quite clear on demon transformation. Even a partial demonic transformation carries a spirit and intellect eroding side effect, not to mention a complete transformation. Complete transformation would greatly reduce one’s lifespan, but would provide an equally frightening strength.</p><p>“This is the first time I’ve seen a complete demonic transformation.”</p><p>Ye Chen was also aware of the complete transformation. This was also the reason that some people were strictly against demonic humans on the True Spirit Continent. Of course, as Ye Chen saw it, demonic humans didn’t pose any threat at all. Their numbers were simply too few, and would be unable to raise any waves.</p><p>“Young master, many thanks for helping!” Seeing the terror of the middle-aged demon, the white-robed woman’s group flew to Ye Chen’s side.</p><p>Ye Chen said, “It was not much effort on my part, so no need to thank me.”</p><p>“Don’t be careless young master! Apart from this place being outside the Demonic Ocean, the reason demonic humans are hedgemons of this region is that they can undergo complete demonic transformation. This person is one of the powerful half-step Kings of demonic humans. Once he transforms completely, he is very frightening.” The white-robed woman clearly had some understanding of the demonic human clan.</p><p>Ye Chen faintly nodded.</p><p>“You all are dead, xi xi!”</p><p>The middle-aged demonic man bent his knees and pounced; the distance of several li seemed to have been completely overlooked. Even Ye Chen was unable to see his trajectory clearly.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>While everybody was stupefied, Ye Chen raised his sword and clashed with middle-aged demonic man’s claw, causing sparks to fly everywhere.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The middle-aged man continued to strike repeatedly with an illusory trajectory. Apart from Ye Chen, nobody could see him at all. If not for Ye Chen, one move would have obtained one kill. This was precisely the killing potential extreme speed offered.</p><p>By relying on Spiritual Sword, although Ye Chen was unable to see through his trajectory, he was able to respond and block the assault.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Not getting any success with his attacks, the middle-aged demonic man turned even more berserk. His eyes turned scarlet, creating a red arc in the void and looking terrifying to the extreme.</p><p>Peng Peng Peng!</p><p>The speed at which the two exchanged was simply freakish.</p><p>Suddenly, Ye Chen growled, “Nine Identical Swords!”</p><p>With a clank, the Blood Ruin Sword at his waist left the sheath and turned into nine swords. The nine swords spiraled at an extreme speed seeming like sword phantom auroras. Even the middle-aged demonic man was unable to dodge completely and was slashed countless times.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>The middle-aged man sprang back, leaving the range of swords.</p><p>His chest, stomach, rear, and legs were filled with bone-deep sword scars, especially the sword gash on his chest, which was the scar from Ye Chen’s Spiritual Sword. The sword Qi had actually penetrated deep enough to injure his organs.</p><p>However, in the next moment, everybody creased their brows.</p><p>The flesh inside his open wounds wriggled like snakes and merged with each other. His wounds healed and hard skin automatically fused, leaving behind only dim scar traces which could be easily missed if not inspected carefully.</p><p>“What a powerful regenerative ability!”</p><p>This was the first time Ye Chen had come across a regenerative body comparable to his Immortal Body under Life and Death realm. By merely relying on his body, the middle-aged demonic man could easily slowly grind the experts of his level to death.</p><p>“Hehe…Let me see how long you can hold on.” Saliva leaked from the other’s mouth corner as he said with a fiendish face.</p><p>“Come then.” Ye Chen’s left sword fingers slashed, and the Blood Ruin Sword again turned into nine and shot out.</p><p>“F*ck off!” The middle-aged man roared violently while his body spun like a spinning top. His sharp claws and bones protruding out of the body repelled the nine swords amidst the spin without sustaining any injury. Borrowing the momentum from the spin, the middle-aged demonic man’s body flickered and slashed an arc in the void, attacking Ye Chen diagonally.</p><p>“Sword Light Fight Art!”</p><p>Ye Chen’s Zhen Yuan poured outside his body and five sword beams formed a pair of simple sword wings. With a rustle, he dodged the attack easily.</p><p>Puff! Puff!</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Ye Chen didn’t expect the middle-aged man to still have this move. Caught off guard, he could only knock off two sharp strings and was struck by the third. However, his Zhen Yuan was not broken. At the crucial moment, he activated the bronze armor, greatly amplifying his defenses.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The middle-aged demonic man pounced at him.</p><p>“You’ll die.”</p><p>Ye Chen neutralized his retreat. Neither retreating nor evading, he pounced up timely.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The two’s collision created a huge tsunami. Ring shaped tides spread out in every direction, waves rising up to more than a hundred meters. In the distorted space above the caved in ocean, a time-stopping effect was aroused when the two faced off due to their extremely strong inertia.</p><p>When this effect disappeared, the middle-aged man’s claw clenched into a fist and punched at Ye Chen’s chest. Ye Chen didn’t resist this move, and instead raised his Thunder Disaster Sword and swept it at the middle-aged demonic man’s head. The speed of his sword was higher than the latter’s punch.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>A head flew off, and Ye Chen was blasted off while spurting out a mouthful of blood.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
