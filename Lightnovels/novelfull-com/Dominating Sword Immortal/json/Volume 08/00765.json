One could not build caves and houses on flat ground; therefore, high peaks of mountains and hills would be the perfect option. Iron valley zone was the first zone of the No.3 devouring island, and had the most mountains and caves. Before Ye Chen was battling with the Explosive fire king, they had already destroyed a lot of caves, and it was even worse now. More than thirty percent of the caves had been destroyed. Luckily, there was so much noise out there that most of the people had left their caves, so there should not have been too many casualties.</p><p>Seeing the ruined mountains and caves, people did not even know what they should feel anymore.</p><p>Of course, compared to the shattered caves, Ye Chen’s power was even more shocking for them. The Explosive fire king was always known for his power, which was why he climbed up to become the first half step king warrior on No.3 devouring island. Even black water alliance would not want to pressure him too much, and had given him a certain degree of special treatment. Within the thirty zones, only iron valley zone’s dark power party would have the best percentage in rewards. They got thirty percent out of everything they got, which was already enough to show his power.</p><p>Pooh!</p><p>That sword power was way too intense. Added with the blast, the Explosive fire king could feel his internal organs being pushed out of his mouth along with the blood. In the end, he managed to slow his body down only after he had crashed through three to four mountains. But, his battling power had been decreased drastically by at least eighty percent.</p><p>The Explode Fire King had lost clearly.</p><p>“The Waning moon is indeed rather powerful.”</p><p>It was Ye Chen’s first time performing this attack of his after he reached peal level Late Seas of Souls Realm, and was really happy with the results. Even a top half step king warrior could not compete with it at all. If it were not for the fact that Ye Chen was afraid of killing the other, he would not have survived.</p><p>Even so, the power of Waning moon was still out of his expectation. But, after giving it some more thought, he could understand why it would be this powerful.</p><p>Amongst all of Ye Chen’s profound sense martial arts, this Waning moon attack was the most mysterious one. It contained eighty percent gold profound and sixty percent water profound. Once the two profounds clashed together, it was not just an additive effect It was a synergy which was rather impressive even amongst the highest profounds.</p><p>Iron Six’s face was pale, since Ye Chen’s power was unbelievable. He could not calm down at all. Also, Ye Chen just looked so young. Judging from his face, he looks slightly older, but his real age could not be older than twenty years.</p><p>“Go take the Zhen yuan crystals.” Ye Chen did not hesitate before asking Murong Qingcheng to gather the followers of that Explosive Fire King. He believed that the fact that he had beaten Explosive Fire King with one sword attack should be enough of a threat for those followers of his.</p><p>The Iron Valley Zone was indeed the biggest zone on the No.3 Devouring island, as the amount of Zhen yuan crystals they managed to gather was a couple of times more than the ones before.</p><p>The followers had given out three thousand Zhen yuan crystals in total while the Explosive Fire King himself had “donated” twenty thousand of them. Adding the ones they had obtained earlier on, they actually had more than a hundred thousand pieces now, which meant that it was time for the two to leave.</p><p>Of course, Ye Chen did not plan to leave yet.</p><p>The Devouring island was so rare to come across as they could create Zhen yuan crystals themselves in here, with one valued ten thousand top rank spirit stones on crystal island, which was really shocking. If it were somewhere else, even twenty thousand might be possible.</p><p>Therefore, Ye Chen planned to get enough Zhen yuan crystals from here. Not only did he have to prepare for reaching the half step king realm, but also for reaching the Life and Death Realm later on.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Zhen yuan crystals did not work for Murong Qingcheng, since she needed demon power crystals, which were really rare and hard to come across on this true spirit continent. Besides Murong Qingcheng, they had not met another person that trained demon power as well. So, she was doomed to have to train everything herself.</p><p>Ye Chen also wanted to stay here for a bit longer to give her a bit more time to train more demon power crystals. With her ability, one month could allow her to create more than one hundred pieces of demon crystals. With four months worth of time, she could make about five hundred of them which should be enough for her to reach Life and Death Realm.</p><p>“It is him!”</p><p>Dongfang Hao and Meng Xiaoling left the prison inside the area and mixed in with the crowd. In fact, the prison could actually not keep them there at all. But, they were too scared to leave, since it would definitely piss off the Explosive Fire King. Therefore, they still decided to stay in the prison for three months regardless. Right now, a huge amount of valleys had been destroyed, so they flew out of the ruins of the prison. After they saw that it was Ye Chen who had beaten the other, they only had mixed feelings.</p><p>They had not taken Ye Chen seriously from the beginning. But as time passed, Ye Chen kept showing vaguely his power, slowly increasing their perception of him. It was when he killed Tu Laosan that they finally realized that he was not a sheep, but a wolf in disguise, and that the only consequences of messing with him would be to get beaten. However, Dongfang Hao was also not a normal warrior. Although Ye Chen managed to kill the powerful warrior, he did not think that Ye Chen was more powerful than him. But, on seeing Ye Chen right now, there was no way of guessing how powerful Ye Chen was anymore.</p><p>“Damn it!” Dongfang Hao tightened his fist.</p><p>“Hao, let’s not mess with him anymore from now on.” Meng Xiaoling turned her head slightly unconsciously and hurried to say when she noticed his frustrated expression.</p><p>Dongfang Hao said with his teeth biting together, “So, you are saying that I cannot compete with him?”</p><p>“No. That is not what I mean. I meant we don’t really have problems with them.” She wanted to say that Dongfang Hao was thirty years old now and Ye Chen looked much younger than him. Leaving alone talent or comprehensive ability, Dongfang Hao was weaker than him. Even if he managed to make a big improvement, Ye Chen would also increase his power as well. Without any exaggeration, Ye Chen was still in that rapid learning stage while Dongfang Hao had already basically run out of his.</p><p>“Huh!” Dongfang Hao waved his sleeves aggressively while the frustration in his eyes got darkened.</p><p>Looking in the north direction, Ye Chen seemed to have spotted something. He turned around and said to Murong Qingcheng, “To the No.4 Devouring island…”</p><p>The No.3 devouring island had given out a hundred thousand Zhen yuan crystals; even if the No.4 island might not be as good the former, it should not be that much worse.</p><p>Right then, No.4 devouring island’s dark power parties did not know that they were facing another string of disasters.</p><p>…</p><p>There was a massive mountain at the center of the No.1 devouring island, surrounded by clouds. A palace stood firmly on that mountain, looking really majestic.</p><p>A voice was heard inside the palace.</p><p>“So, you are saying that a man and a lady had robbed you.” A bulky middle-aged man who wore gold sting black clothes said from the top seat. He was the manager of the black water alliance teams on the devouring islands, and everyone addressed him as “Ma manager.”</p><p>“Yeah, that young man is very powerful! We could not handle even one sword attack from him.”</p><p>The Tough King stood in the front, along with dark power party leaders from the No.3 devouring islands.</p><p>“Not even one sword!”</p><p>Manager Ma lowered his eyelids. According to the other leaders’ description, he had a general idea of Ye Chen’s power. If he had guessed it right, then he must be a top half step king level warrior. As for exactly what level, it was still unknown.</p><p>Shoo! Shoo!</p><p>“What? It is the Green Water King and the Yellow Sand king!”</p><p>Everyone had recognized the newcomers from their controlled regions. These two were ranked in the top three on the No.3 devouring island.</p><p>Manager Ma frowned as well.</p><p>Green Water King, who looked quite pale and not in a good mood, took a glance at everything and then forced a chuckle, “Indeed, that young man is too powerful!”</p><p>“Since both of you have been beaten, then he should be on his way to the Iron Valley zone. Let’s wait and see.” Manager Ma looked the same on the surface. The most powerful warrior on No.3 devouring island was the Explosive fire king. If he were still not here, then he should have been beaten by Ye Chen, which would not be the best thing.</p><p>After about half pot of tea worth of time, a beam of human shadow flew over the mountain before reappearing here.</p><p>“Explosive Fire King!” Everyone gasped. They did not think that he came here to show off his power. Everyone knew that he must have been beaten by Ye Chen.</p><p>“Needless to say.” Waving his hand while knew where this was going, Manager Ma said, “You all back down. From now on, black water alliance can take care of the issues.</p><p>“Yes, sir!”</p><p>Ye Chen did not know what was happening inside the venue, but he would not have cared even if he did.</p><p>With this extra month of cooking Zhen yuan crystals, they were safe from the holy spirit’s punishment. After cleaning out all the dark power parties on No.4 island, they had gotten seventy five thousand Zhen yuan crystals. Adding the ones from before, there were one hundred and seventy thousand pieces with them. This number of Zhen yuan crystals would be something that even Life and Death Realm warriors would want to fight for.</p><p>Although the Zhen yuan crystals from No.4 devouring island might not be as good as the ones on No.3 island, there was a good news after all. They had a leader of a dark power party who was actually a dark creature. Although the demon power he trained was not very pure, but the demon power crystals were still valuable. In that cause, Murong Qingcheng’s inventory sudden saw an increase of two thousand.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
