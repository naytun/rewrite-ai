However, he did not know what kind of secret art Ye Chen had used, his wounds had not only cured completely, even his mental status had got back to its peak and that his whole aura had reached a higher better condition.</p><p>Ye Chen smiled lightly. However, that smile of his gave people the feeling of a cold winter breeze.</p><p>His expression slowly changed, went back to its old dull look. The Ghost Wood King thought about it calmly before saying slowly, “I have almost been fooled by you, this secret art os yours must come with severe side effects. Once it wears out, it would must effect your body.”</p><p>He did not think there would be some kind of secret art that could reverse natural effects.</p><p>“You will know if you try.”</p><p>Ye Chen could not argue against that since there were indeed side effects, but it could be reversed by using yuan qi recovering pellets or spirit plants. In another word, as long as he had enough of yuan qi, theoretically he could perform the immortal body countless times.</p><p>“Ghost Wood King, why haven’t you finished taking care of that brat?” The elder did not have the time and effort to pay attention to the elder. As time passed on, his speed could no longer serve as an advantage anymore for him anymore, Qing Liu’s causal fightbacks could opporess him completely and forbidden him from using his true power. He had to admit that the human demi king warriors’ average battle power might not be as powerful as demi beast king, but the battle techniques would be way more powerful. Plus, Qing Liu’s battle power was not weaker than him at all, it might be even a bit more powerful.</p><p>“You hold on for a bit!”</p><p>Ghost Wood King said.</p><p>“Alright, you try to take care of this as soon as possible.”</p><p>The elder had no idea what happened over on the other side. But he knew tht that he should have asked the Ghost Wood King to take on Qing Liu so it might be a win-win situation since there besides the slightly slower speed, Ghost Wood King was more powerful than him.</p><p>“This Ye Chen… he indeed could not be underestimated.” Qing Liu and the elder was different, besides the adapting period of time to the elder’s speed, she was now completely fine with the battle now. She even had the time to look at Ye Chen’s side which was doing way better than she had expected.</p><p>“Ye Chen is not wounded?!”</p><p>It was Lin Gaoming’s first time seeing Ye Chen using his immortal art, which shocked him a bit. Meanwhile, Yan Fengfeng was no longer surprised anymore, when Ye Chen was battling with Liu Wujian, he had exposed this kind of power already which had oppressed Liu Wujian completely. As for Murong Qingchen being so calm about it was because she was right there when Ye Chen got the secret art manual.</p><p>“I don’t have the patient to fight with you anymore.”</p><p>The Ghost Wood King was a demi king warrior trained from a piece of ghost wood. Even if he was being emotional, there would not be much expression on his face. However, his tone exposed his emotions.</p><p>“World Net!”</p><p>Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!…</p><p>The air slicing sound was heard, shooting through the Ghost Wood King’s body, countless black veins appeared out of nowhere which all had black qi around. Wherever they touched, the liveliness in the air would be abstracted completely. Within a blink of an eye, layers had been set down, some of the veins were even rooted deep in the ground. After absorbing all of the liveliness under the ground, it got even more powerful.</p><p>“This beast king is indeed tricky to take on.”</p><p>Yan Fengfeng tried to use her Nirvana fire to burn the veins, but once the opponent sensed it, he could let go of the veins, not giving her the opportunity to get in at all. Not only that, the roots under the ground were getting more and more, they were no longer under control. Instead, it started to grow madly, even the trees that were miles away were effected and started to die off quickly. With all of the liveliness gathered together, forming into an unbreakable loop. The shadows of Ghost Wook King and Ye Chen could no longer be seen, they were all wrapped in a massive ball made up by veins which was no less than five miles.</p><p>“Massive sword spell!”</p><p>Ye Chen did not have a reason for him to let his opponent perform all of his attacks. The gold sword that was slightly damaged had been shoot out, it expended in the mid air, turning into a massive sword attacking towards his opponent. Meanwhile, he formed his sword finger with his left hand as well before pointing out his fingers. That green long sword followed behind. Three sword shadows appeared out of nowhere attacking from the left side.</p><p>He could tell that although the Ghost Wood King’s power was very scary, but speed would be his disadvantage. From the beginning to even now, he had not moved much at all.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The Ghost Wood King blow away the gold sword with one fist attack, it failed to block out the green long sword, the protective beast power had been shattered almost all of them. The sword qi left a bloody mark on his shoulder and a vein flew out.</p><p>“By using the massive sword spell to shake my protective beast power before using defense sword spell to shatter it.” Ghost Wood King’s defensive beast power would be so powerful that in normal condition, the defense sword spell could hardly break defense beast power, but because it was fighting against the massive sword spell and the defensive beast power became very unstable which allowed the flying sword to make it through. If it was not for that vein on his shoulder, it would be more than just a blood mark on his shoulder.</p><p>“Soul Shattering Fist!”</p><p>“Shatter!”</p><p>Ghost Wood King kept his body still as he threw out double fist attacks. One afer another that powerful fist power made it through everything.</p><p>Ye Chen would not dare to slow down, he performed all his best attacks as well, operating two flying swords at the same time. The gold sword formed into a massive sword while the green long sword had been separated into three parts, before splitting into five parts. The sword shadow was everywhere which was at the same level with the Ghost Wood King’s attacks. All of the suddenly, no one was winning anyone.</p><p>Of course, with when soul power was as powerful as Ye Chen’s could one person operate two flying swords at the same time.</p><p>But even so, Ye Chen was not having a good time as well. Judging on the situation now, it might seemed like the two of them were all at the same level, but the Ghost King Warrior was a demi king warrior after all. Each punch of his was so powerful that it would take Ye Chen’s full strength to block it out. if it was not the fact that he trained immortal body, and the fact that there was one-thirds of more zhen yuan that he had stored in his tag, he would have lost.</p><p>Outside the massive ball of veins, the booming sound was heard.</p><p>Murong Qingchen, Yan Fengfeng tried to use the spot to break the surface, trying to attack the massive vein ball. They were working perfectly. First, they used the nirvana fire burning the veins which pushed the Ghost Wood King to pay some attention on fixing his protective layer. With the falling veins, Murong Qingchen and Ling Gaoqing attacked crazily, they prepared to make it through the massive ball, it was indeed why the three of them decided to work together. Without them attracting some attention of the beast king, Ye Chen would face more pressure.</p><p>“Since you guys want to die, then I will let you die.”</p><p>The Ghost Wood King’s beast power exploded, that ball started to move around, countless veins were like whips and started to whip the three outside. These veins continued demi step king warrior beast power. The attacking power was so horrifying, which was not weaker than a full range attack of a top master level warrior. Hundreds of veins whipped around. Even if the three were so powerful that they were still pushed to fall back. They were not able to approach closer at all.</p><p>The demi beast king’s power had shocked the three.</p><p>Fighting four at the same time and still had the upper hand was definitely impressive.</p><p>“Mysterious Spell!”</p><p>All of the sudden!</p><p>A massive palm print appeared outside tht massive vein ball. All of the shattered veins flew everywhere darkening the sky. The Ghost Wood King’s face went pale, the qi and blood inside him was boiling.</p><p>It turned out that Qing Liu managed to have some free time and threw out an attack on the massive ball. Qing Liu’s power was no weaker than the Ghost Wood King and while the latter was multitasking between fighting the three and Ye Chen at the same time, he was wounded slightly.</p><p>“Five sword attacks!”</p><p>Ye Chen catched the Ghost Wood King’s chaotic moment and separate his gold sword and green long sword into five parts. Ten sword shadows attacked towards his opponent.</p><p>Chin! Chin! Chin! Chin! Chin!…</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>The metal explosion continued to take place, the protective beast power could no longer handle everything anymore. The sharp sowrd qi leaked out and entered the body of the Ghost Wood King.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Ghost Wood King controlled the qi and blood. The beast power exploded and reversed the critical situation.</p><p>Just like that, the Ghost Wood King, the short elder, Qing Liu, Ye Chen, and Murong Qingchen were stuck in that long enduring battle. No one could really wound anyone.</p><p>Over on this side when everyone was trying their best to battle. Countless human shadows had been attracted over from outside the forest. In the north-west side was the skinny elder and the teenager, while in the west was the Gold Absolute King and the Punish King, in the north was the Punish King and the hell king and their warriors. There were more human shadows scattered around the whole area. There were demi king warriors from rank 5 martial institutions, there were also loner warriors. all of the sudden, dozens of demi king warriors gathered over here.</p><p>“Haha! It seems like there was some kind of great items that were found here. Otherwise the battle would not have been this intense.”</p><p>Gold Absolute King laughed with his mouth wide open, he licked his lips.</p><p>“If the power was not strong enough, even if we kill them all would not be a problem.”</p><p>It was the Punish King who had the most killing vibe. He was talking about killing all of them already.</p><p>“Hm? It is the Ghost Wook King!”</p><p>From afar, the skinny elder noticed that veiny massive ball, he said.</p><p>“This warrior is very powerful?”</p><p>The teenager asked.</p><p>The elder said, “He was a demi beast king that trained from a piece of ghost wood. He naturally could abstract the liveliness from everything to strengthen himself. His talent would be to create veiny realm such as that massive ball there and trap his opponents within. These veins were all deep rooted under the ground, they could also take up all of the liveliness which would decrease the Ghost Wood King’s beast power consumption which would be a very tricky marital art to take up to. When encountering him, it would be best not to mess with him.”</p><p>Everyone was moving extremely fast. Soon, they were only hundreds miles away from the cetner of the battle.</p><p>“Not good! this many demi king warriors!”</p><p>Qing Liu’s expression changed, she suddenly increased the distance between her and her opponent.</p><p>“What? You are afraid?”</p><p>The elder let out a breath, he said forcibly</p><p>Qing Liu said with an annoyed expression, “Look around you.”</p><p>Heard her, the elder spread out his soul power. The next second, his expression was not as good as well. Within his detection, seven, eight demi king warriors appeared out of nowhere. With each one of them being the top warrior, and some of them were even scary to the extend that their qi could frighten a normal warrior to death. They were no weaker than Qing Liu as well. After a while, the elder then regained his evil smile, “What does this have to do with me? You are the ones who got the fire pear tree, not us. You think what they would do if they found out that you guys had the fire pear tree?”</p><p>Qing Liu’s expression had never been this worse, “You might also have something they are looking for, “Worst case scenario, all of us will die. I believe they would not mind to kill one or two warriors extra.</p><p>“I guess we will see who will die the fastest then.”</p><p>The elder’s expression was unstable, it was obvious that he was planning something evil.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
