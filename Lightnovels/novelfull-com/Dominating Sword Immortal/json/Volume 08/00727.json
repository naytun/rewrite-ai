It was five meter tall and that water tank like fists torn apart the air and attacked at the group.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Qing Liu took it on with all of her body. She slide out.</p><p>“Since there are no other plans, I will stall her and you guys all leave the marshland immediately.” Qing Liu thought that she was slightly weaker than the opponent and plus that immortal body and that unlimited power. She could only try to stop the monster for as long as possible.</p><p>“Teacher!”</p><p>Yan Fengfeng was a bit worries.</p><p>Qing Liu said, “Don’t worry. When you guys are not here, there is more of a chance for me to escape. Ye Chen, take care of them two.” She believed in Ye Chen’s surviving skills.</p><p>“Yes, I will.” He nodded, he then said to Yan Fengfeng and Murong Qingchen, “Let’s go. Don’t give her more pressure than there is already.”</p><p>Yan Fengfeng and Murong Qingchen knew that he was right, there was nothing they could do if they stayed. Leaving as soon as possible would be the best way to help.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>The three of them shoot out forward.</p><p>“Do you think you can escape from me?”</p><p>The body of the marshland king infused into the marshland. When he reappeared, they were already in front of the three.</p><p>Woo!</p><p>Just as the marshland king was about to attack, that blurry light door appeared and Qing Liu walked right out. She threw out a punch and blown her opponent away.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Qing Liu yelled with a low voice.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>The three of them did not have an extra thought, they flew in full speed.</p><p>“Alright, after taking care of you, then I will go take care of them.” The green jewllery like pupils of the marshland king shone cold light as he reached out into the air. He groaned, “Marshland fountain!”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The whole marshland within hundreds of miles started shaking. The next second, a fountain exploded right below Qing Liu. The power of both mud and water infused together.</p><p>“Landing Spell!”</p><p>Qing Liu had a serious look on her face before pressing her palm down.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The fountain had been blocked out by the crystal palm.</p><p>“With your power, you cannot beat me yet.” The marshland king was only slightly more powerful than Qing Liu. If she was not afraid of that immortal body of it and that unlimited power, Qing Liu would have joined forces with Ye Chen and wound him. There would be no need in escaping in a hurry.</p><p>“Indeed. My power now can really not harm you.”</p><p>The marshland king stopped attacking. Its body stood there in the marshland.</p><p>“However, this is not my real power.”</p><p>Splash!</p><p>The body then sank back into the marshland.</p><p>Qing Liu frowned, she could not foresee what it was about to do.</p><p>Soon, she realized something was different with the marshland.</p><p>The color of it was getting lighter and lighter visibly as if something was abstracting the essence and energy of the place.</p><p>“This is my real power.”</p><p>A pile of green shadow appeared from the marshland and threw out a punch at Qing Liu.</p><p>There was no time for her to dodge nor to block the incoming attack. Qing Liu could only crossed both of his hands and try to seal away that incoming attack.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>Her protective zhen yuan was shattered immediately, a metal twisting sound was heard. Qing Liu’s high rank arm shield had been shattered. A twisting pattern appeared in her bones as well. It looked like it might break any second. Meanwhile, her real body looked like it had been struck by thunder, she could not control her body as it was blown into the air and crashed into a black rock at the top.</p><p>Pooh!</p><p>She puked out a huge amount of blood. She looked at below her shockingly. The marshland king’s powr was even more powerful than before. If before, Qing Liu was only slightly weaker than her opponent, now now, even with five of her could not be the marshland monster’s rightful opponents.</p><p>“How is that? My real power.”</p><p>The marshland king looked completely different even though he was standing exactly where he was before. But his height was lowered from five meters to three meters, and his clor from brown green to dark green. What changed even more drastically, his core and his body had all been madeof green liquids which continued to drip down before being absorbed again by the body.</p><p>“I see now, before it was only your other form.”</p><p>Flew out from the hole, Qing Liu swallowed a pellet. As the medicine effect took place, Qing Liu’s wounds started to reheal. Those broken bones had been reconnected together. With no gaps at all, it was a demi extreme rank healing pellet which was extremely valuable.</p><p>“Not bad.”</p><p>The marshland king’s massive mouth looked like a cracked open crystal. There was no teeth, but only green slim.</p><p>“Two forms. The first one can keep you alive as long as inthis marshland but the power is not that powerful; the second form had increased your power but you are no long immortal anymore. As long as I can burn out your energy then your immortal body would have no use.”</p><p>Qing Liu did not lose her mind, she analyzed calmly.</p><p>“You are very smart. But do you really think you can burn out my energy?” The marshland king was not worried at all. In other form, his power might be unlimited, he can live on as long as the marshland was there. Although in his form now, he might not have as much energy as before, but he was still dozen times more than normal demi king warriors. it would be rare for her to burn out one-tenth of his energy, it thought.</p><p>“How would you know if not try?”</p><p>A bright light flashed once, a massive hammer appeared in Qing Liu’s hand. It was square and very heavy. It oppressed the space and even air could not flow around it.</p><p>Wooo!</p><p>The blurry light door appeared in front of the marshland king. Qing Liu took a step forward, that hammer landed right in the middle of the marshland’s chest. The power pattern spread out in the air.</p><p>A massive sound exploded, the whole body of the marshland king had been shattered and disappeared in the air.</p><p>“How is my attacking power?”</p><p>She waved her hammer again, shattering the other part of her opponent’s body.</p><p>“What kind of weapon is this?”</p><p>Hundred meters away, the marshland kign’s body regrouped together, but by the looks of it, its qi had weakened a lot. It was only four-fifths of before. Qing Liu’s two hammer attacks had already burned out one-fifths of his energy which was unbelievable.</p><p>“You can call it the flawed extreme rank weapon.”</p><p>Qing Liu breathed loudly, she hurried to swallow a demi extreme rank pellet to repair her zhen yuan before taking a bite into a water yuan fruit to nourish her body. The hammer in her hand was called the Square Heaven Hammer which was even more superior ranking than demi extreme rank items. It was actually already extreme rank, but it was just with flaws and cracks perhaps. It was just like the extreme rank item, it was a black hole for zhen yuan. With Qing Liu’s demi king warrior cultivation, two hammers had burned out two-thirds of zhen yuan.</p><p>“Flawed extreme rank items!”</p><p>Although the marshland king was a marshland creature but it did not mean that it did not have a high intelligence. That hammer in Qing Liu’s hand had already threatened his being and although he could repair himself back to first level, but it was obvious that he could not kill her.</p><p>“Indeed. So can I go now?”</p><p>Qing Liu did not care the marshland king’s attitude at all, she flashed her body and shoot out.</p><p>“I hope not everyone that come in here all has flawed extreme rank weapon.” The marshland king stood there, it did not chase after Qing Liu.</p><p>…</p><p>“I think, we can fight him together.”</p><p>On top of the forest, dark ghost bats were endless. In the middle, the elder, the teenager, Hulk and the iron hand king were all trapped there. Their opponent also included a horrifying ghost bat king.</p><p>It was way much more powerful than any of them. They were not his rightful opponent even if they all joined force together.</p><p>“Indeed, we should try it at least.”</p><p>Iron Hand King looked extra serious, if it was not for the fact that the elder and Hulk was there, he could not have survived this ghost bat king at all.</p><p>“Brat, you just wait until I kill him, then I will come take care of you.”</p><p>Hulk’s muscle expended. That massive demon cow shadow stood on his back. The most casual fist attack had shattered a huge amount of ghost bats. The power of the savage cow family was no joke.</p><p>“I will wait for you.”</p><p>Those twisted pattern around the teenager’s body blown away all of the ghost bats that tried to attack him.</p><p>“Kill me? Haha!”</p><p>A horrifying smile appeared on the ghost bat king’s face.</p><p>“You lot, go spread some aggressive halo!” The bat king ordered the leader bat beasts that were hidden in the dark.</p><p>“Yes, king!”</p><p>Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!</p><p>Waves of vibration appeared, five black aggressive halo appeared out of nowhere and attacked towards the group. It covered at least couple of miles.</p><p>Awoo!</p><p>The roar was heard. Besides the skinny elder, the teenager, Hulk and iron hand king who managed to get out from the aggressive halo, the rest of them all were heavily affected. They attacked each other. And soon, besides the four, the rest of them were all killed.</p><p>“Bastard, die!”</p><p>Hulk and iron hand king were furious. These were all their top master level warriors, which were the ones that supported their whole families. Even with one die would not be a small problem, not to mention losing all of them.</p><p>“Cow demon roar!”</p><p>Hulk opened his open, the light pattern spread out. with him being the center, all of the ghost bats within couple of miles were all died. Even miles away, the bats were starting to move lowlier. Judging on the battling power, Hulk was indeed not as powerful as iron hand king and elder. But judging on pure power, then he would be in the top.</p><p>“You are looking for death!”</p><p>The bat king was furious. The black qi filled up the space, he immediately attacked towards Hulk.</p><p>“You will be the one that die!”</p><p>Iron Hand King made a grabbing gesture in the air, and a massive iron hand was about to grab onto the ghost bat king.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>The speed of the ghost bat increased drastically, that massive orn hand king had been reached over long time agao.</p><p>“Tornado teeth!”</p><p>A wave of aggressive wind appeared out of nowhere, that wind blade spread out covering the ghost bat king within.</p><p>The ghost bat king’s tricks were frightening the four. Endless black smoke appeared from his body. Endless black bat spread out looking like a bat army even the ghost bats apread had been pushed out.</p><p>“Ah, cow roar!”</p><p>countless bats crawled around Hulk. Those bats had their teeth bit into his body, abstracting his flesh and blood. Hulk roared once, shattering a huge mount of them. Unfortunately, there were way too many of them, after those ones were killed, more jumped on him, crawling inside of him. All of the sudden, Hulk had been sucked into a jerky. The demi beast king had been killed instantly.</p><p>“How tasty!”</p><p>The bats gathered together and the bat king’s figure appeared. He licked away the remaining blood around his mouths.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
