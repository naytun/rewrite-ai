After about half an hour, Qing Liu arrived.</p><p>“Teacher!”</p><p>Yan Fengfeng let out a breath.</p><p>“Senior, are you alright?”</p><p>Ye Chen said.</p><p>Qing Liu shook her head. She said, “Luckily, you guys left before anything had happened. Otherwise the consequences would be catastrophic.” The marshland monster in his second form had twice as much power as before. Without the flawed extreme rank item, even she could not handle it.</p><p>“What about the marshland king?”</p><p>She answered, “He is still there and even more powerful than before. Let’s go first.”</p><p>…</p><p>A loud sound came out from the marshland. Then everything was peaceful and quite again.</p><p>“Where that monster came from?”</p><p>No one knew how long it had been but the marshland king crawled back out from the ground. Those pitch dark jewellery-like eyes were full of fear.</p><p>That warrior had only thrown out one blade attack.</p><p>And with only one blade attack, half of his power had been burned out, if with another blade, he might have been killed. He had never thougth about it that human demi king warrior would have this kind of power. His immortal body would not even handle one blade attack. That warrior had made it all the way here so it meant that he had taught that big bat a lesson as well, he might have even killed him.</p><p>“Damn. With half of my power gone, I will have to sleep in this marshland for at least half of a month before recovering fully. If I get wounded again, then the power of the marshland would not be enough for me anymore. I really hope that big bat is killed. Without him, then more people would make it here successfully. And with their corpses, the marshland would have more power and my power would grow as well.”</p><p>Marshland king was born from the essence of the marshland. In a way, he was the marshland and the marshland lived through him. As for those minor marshland monsters and leaders were all born from the remaining power of the marshland as well.</p><p>If there were enough corpses to nourish the marshland, then all of the monsters would increase their power and his power would reach a new level as well.</p><p>…</p><p>“I have a hunch. This whole graveyard would take a lot of lives of the powerful warriors.” Flying in the air, Qing Liu sighed as she said.</p><p>Ye Chen said, “The four extreme emperor is a famous emperor king warrior. His grave appearing in the world would attract so much attention. And we are only little pawns, the real lead roles aren’t us.”</p><p>“You are quite right.”</p><p>Qing Liu knew what he was talking about. Right now, all of the king warriors were all planning, some of them were calling for friends, while some other chose to make alliances. Her disciple Yan Qingxuan and the old dragon king were on the same side. Before they had also chased down the Nine Ghost Cult leader.</p><p>“However, the king warrior’s battle would only be limited. It would not have much to do with us.”</p><p>The king warriors would be taken on by the king warriors since the rest of them would be on a completely different level.</p><p>There were no brightness nor darkness in this underground environment. After about half a day, the three arrived in a rock forest.</p><p>“That looked like the spider net.”</p><p>Murong Qingchen’s eye sight was sharp. In front of the rock forest, a slightly see-through massive spider web can be spotted. It was three hundred meter long and if looked closely then a thin spider string would be the thickness of an arm.</p><p>“Everyone, watch out!”</p><p>Qing Liu lowered her speed and entered the rock forest slowly.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
