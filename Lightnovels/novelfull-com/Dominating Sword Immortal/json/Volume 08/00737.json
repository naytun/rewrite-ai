However, Ye Chen knew that it was an extremely long process. If one could break through in just one or two times, it would simply be too trifling.</p><p>After the second time, Ye Chen didn’t immediately issue the third wave of assault. Instead, he accumulated for a bit, then led a new wave of assault. During each assault, he only attacked twice. He needed to endure, because only endurance would produce the greatest effect.</p><p>Fifth assault!</p><p>Sixth assault!</p><p>…</p><p>Tenth assault!</p><p>…</p><p>Twentieth assault!</p><p>…</p><p>Thirtieth assault!</p><p>…</p><p>Unwittingly, the marker of the water clock was pointing to dawn. Ye Chen’s whole body was dripping with sweat, and his spirit, Qi, and soul were exceptionally stimulated, carrying a trace of abnormality.</p><p>“This is the moment!”</p><p>Ye Chen, who had meticulously assaulted the barrier numerous times, took a deep breath and began a new wave of assault. After two waves of assault, Ye Chen didn’t stop but led the third wave…then fifth, sixth, and straight to eleventh time, with still much more left. This was the energy left accumulated throughout the night. It was also the plan Ye Chen had decided upon earlier.</p><p>“Break for me!”</p><p>At the twelfth wave, Ye Chen heard a shattering sound. Unfortunately, it was only for a moment and hadn’t gone all the way through. Raising his remaining energy, Ye Chen gnashed his teeth and initiated the thirteenth wave. As if being rewarded for his efforts, a deep crack appeared. However, it never fell, persistently holding on like a heavy chain.</p><p>At the fifteenth wave, Ye Chen finally felt lacking in strength.</p><p>This couldn’t happen. Once he gave up, it would be tantamount to giving up all his previous efforts, a night of painstaking effort. Most importantly, if he lost this opportunity, he wouldn’t be sure of breaking through into late Sea of Soul realm in a short term.</p><p>“Sixteenth time.”</p><p>Blood trickled down the corner of Ye Chen’s mouth and blue veins bulged on his forehead as his eyes began to redden.</p><p>“Eighteenth time!”</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>Unceasing eighteenth waves of assault had already surpassed the limit of Ye Chen’s limits. If he didn’t succeed this time, he would be done for. He couldn’t help but let out a roar, raising the dust that filled the entire store room. Ye Chen, sitting at the center of the room, only appeared as an indistinct silhouette. His aura seemed like that of a stagnant water, without any movement at all, seeming extremely strange.</p><p>Suddenly…</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Boundless and majestic Zhen Yuan soared, turning the dust into nothingness. This Zhen Yuan ripple far exceeded Ye Chen’s previous Zhen Yuan. Be it richness or strength, both were on a whole another level.</p><p>Late Sea of Soul realm!</p><p>Breakthrough successful!</p><p>“Success!”</p><p>Even with Ye Chen’s temperament, he couldn’t restrain his state of mind, feeling extremely aroused. The breakthrough this time was too difficult. After accumulating energy for the entire night and making a bitter, painstaking effort, he still almost failed. If he hadn’t endured the pressure and surpassed his own limits, the chance of failure was around ninety percent. However, it was over now.</p><p>At this moment, his cultivation base was at late Sea of Soul realm.</p><p>Although excited, he did not lose his sense. Breaking through Sea of Soul realm didn’t mean immediately gaining late Sea of Soul realm cultivation. Because the Zhen Yuan in his body had not completed its transformation and was not in complete harmony, his first objective would be to first stabilize the cultivation base and then gradually adapt to his new Zhen Yuan.</p><p>Of course, the most important thing was comprehending the profound.</p><p>Slowly letting out a breath of turbid air, Ye Chen closed his eyes, entering the state of one with the world, stabilizing his cultivation base at one side while comprehending all sorts of profound on the other. This was indeed the best moment to comprehend profound. If he missed this opportunity, who knew how long he would have to wait for the next opportunity.</p><p>“So, the thunder profound could be derived in this manner as well!”</p><p>In the state of one with the world, Ye Chen’s comprehension and reasoning were raised to the extreme. A cloud of lightning suddenly appeared in his mind. This lightning existed in all shapes and forms, containing an extremely high level of thunder profound. With this, Ye Chen’s observation rapidly increased his understanding of the thunder profound.</p><p>Sixty percent!</p><p>Seventy percent!</p><p>Ye Chen’s original thunder profound was only comprehended to fifty percent. But, at this moment, it directly reached seventy percent. What sort of a concept was this? It should be known that greater success of thunder profound was at ninety percent, which was not too far off from seventy percent. If nothing unexpected happened, his Thunder Devour, which contained the thunder profound, would slowly turn into a high grade profound martial skill, which would be several folds more powerful than before.</p><p>Pitter Pitter!</p><p>Without opening his eyes, Ye Chen subconsciously pointed his finger in the air. A clap of thunder was heard, and a hole appeared in the stone room across, scorched at the edges and seeming crystalline.</p><p>“Metal profound!”</p><p>Unable to advance thunder profound any further, Ye Chen turned to metal profound. Although his metal profound was surpassed by the thunder profound, in the state of being one with the world, his comprehension of the metal profound far exceeded the thunder profound.</p><p>In a few moments, it jumped to fifty percent from forty percent, then continued to rise all the way until eighty percent, frighteningly close to greater success.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>Ye Chen once again pointed, emitting a dark gold ripple like a dark golden flower blossoming quietly. This was not the end as he flicked his other finger. Dark golden flowers blossomed one after another like a magic trick. Metal profound, under Ye Chen’s control, turned into fine threads, which was a sign of approaching greater success.</p><p>As of now, Ye Chen’s thunder profound and metal profound had attained seventy percent and eighty percent respectively, and Thunder Devour and Golden Ripple containing these profounds had also taken a huge leap forward. Their might was not far away from that of high grade profound martial skills.</p><p>Adding Ye Chen’s cultivation base also advancing to late Sea of Soul realm, his strength had truly skyrocketed. Ordinary half step Kings would be instantly killed, and even some reputed figures might not be his match. When he came across Ghost Wood King or Iron Hand King again, he would make sure to pay them back.</p><p>Relying on his Immortal Body, he could even stake his life against an actual Life and Death King. As for who would come out on top, that couldn’t be said for sure.</p><p>“Spiritual Sword has been useless for a while. This should let it shine brightly.”</p><p>After comprehending thunder and metal profound, Ye Chen didn’t forget about his killer move Spiritual Sword. It was a move containing two different profounds—wood and fast. Since he’d been focusing on other profounds for so long, his wood profound had only attained smaller success, and same was the case for the fast profound.</p><p>The reason for Spiritual Sword being so lackluster was because this move integrated with the swordplay in a different way compared to other moves. The fast profound couldn’t create a sharp increase in the Spiritual Sword’s strength; it could only increase its speed. Of course, under similar conditions, more speed implied greater might. However, these two profounds were not Ye Chen’s expertise, causing him a bit of trouble. The time he had was simply too insufficient.</p><p>At this moment, in the state of being one with the world, he wouldn’t have to spend so much time and could greatly increase his comprehension of wood profound and fast profound.</p><p>Forty percent!</p><p>Fifty percent!</p><p>Sixty percent!</p><p>…</p><p>Forty percent!</p><p>Fifty percent!</p><p>Soon, Ye Chen’s wood profound attained sixty percent completion while fast profound, which was comparatively harder to comprehend, also attained fifty percent. As a result, the Spiritual Sword, which contained both these profounds, had a sharp increase in its potency. The current wood profound, which was at sixty percent and far away from thunder profound, and fast profound combined immediately raised its might above Thunder Devour, which contained the thunder profound. In addition, the speed of Spiritual Sword had also increased by several times.</p><p>Be it power or speed, Spiritual Sword had become exceptionally strong, and could certainly be considered as one of his trump cards.</p><p>Whizz…</p><p>Ye Chen raised his two index fingers and slashed a few times in the void. Sword scars filled the wall across him, seeming to be in the hundreds on a rough glance, even though he had merely slashed a few times.</p><p>After working on the fast profound, Ye Chen would naturally not forget the slow profound. Slow profound was much harder than fast profound to comprehend. Previously, he had barely reached twenty percent completion. At this moment, taking advantage of the state of being one with the world, he succeeded in raising his slow profound to minor success. His every movement seemed exceptionally slow, and the time itself seemed to have slowed. The air itself seemed slackened upon making contact with his fingers. Undoubtedly, this move could influence the profound of others.</p><p>Although Ye Chen currently didn’t have the ability to create a peerless move, he had the foundation now. He would have the chance later.</p><p>Finally, the crux was here.</p><p>Ye Chen’s strongest sword move was undoubtedly Golden Hurricane. Golden Ripple was like Spiritual Sword, containing two profounds—metal and water. However, their integration in the sword was not similar. Even if the two had the same profound levels, the might of Spiritual Sword would be far below Golden Hurricane. This was simply due to their different characteristics. Spiritual Sword was primarily swift, and Golden Hurricane was primarily destructive.</p><p>Metal profound naturally didn’t require much effort, but Ye Chen had to exert himself on the final water profound. This was not his primary profound.</p><p>Previously, his water profound had barely entered the realm of minor success. But soon, it broke through the minor success and attained forty percent completion, then fifty percent, before finally stabilizing at sixty percent.</p><p>Ye Chen discovered that the farther he went, the more difficult comprehension became. Although water profound was not his primary profound, since its realm was too low, it advanced swiftly. On the other hand, thunder profound only increased by two levels. This was because, the latter’s starting point was too high. Metal profound conformed with Ye Chen’s body, and thus, its improvement needed not to be mentioned.</p><p>Metal profound was at eighty percent completion and water profound sixty percent completion!</p><p>This was an astonishing breakthrough. Golden Hurricane, which contained these two profounds, was no longer a mid grade profound martial skill, turning into high grade profound battle skill.</p><p>High grade profound martial skills had always been reserved for Life and Death Kings.</p><p>“Chop!”</p><p>Ye Chen slashed with his fingers, and a bizarre scene occurred. The sword Qi of Golden Hurricane was no longer a ripple-like light beam. Instead, it had turned into a crescent moon shaped sword energy.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The stone room’s wall, which was several folds harder than normal walls, burst open.</p><p>Sucking in a deep breath, Ye Chen opened his eyes and saw this scene, then sighed after a while, “Calling it Golden Hurricane is no longer suitable. I ought to change its name.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
