All three had the same aura, and even their sword bone is more or less the same. There is no hierarchy amongst these?”</p><p>Ye Chen didn’t pull out any of the three and merely touched them for a moment, feeling their aura and texture of their bodies. However, the result made him puzzled. The three swords were identical in every aspect.</p><p>“Ye Chen, the Sky Scorpio Sword is amongst these three?” Murong Qingcheng asked.</p><p>Ye Chen shook his head, “I can’t tell either!”</p><p>For a moment, he really believed that the real Sky Scorpio Sword was amongst these three. However, at this moment, he didn’t dare to be certain. Even though the three had subtle differences in their appearance and sword bone, they were basically of the same level.</p><p>“These three swords…which among them is real?” Ye Chen stood between the three swords, contemplating with his head down. “Or perhaps I’m wrong, and the real Sky Scorpio Sword is not amongst them.”</p><p>Suddenly a new idea emerged in Ye Chen’s brain.</p><p>‘Right, this might be it.’</p><p>“If the real Sky Scorpion Sword were to take the initiative, it should have been a single sword. However, since three took the initiative, the real one might be confusing me, shifting my attention to these three and concealing itself among the other ones.”</p><p>“I can’t believe I almost got swindled by a sword.” Raising his head, Ye Chen revealed a smile.</p><p>“Not you.”</p><p>“Not you either.”</p><p>…</p><p>Walking through numerous ‘Sky Scorpio Swords’, Ye Chen began feeling them one after another. This method was clumsy, but also the most effective. He would have to spend a lot of time slowly in feeling five-six hundred swords, but at the very least, he wouldn’t be swindled by a sword.</p><p>“Seems like it’s you!”</p><p>After feeling about three hundred swords, Ye Chen finally found one that was most likely to be real.</p><p>When he first touched the sword, he didn’t feel anything special. But, when he lightly stroked it for a moment, he immediately felt an extremely tyrannical power steering therein. As he sensed this power, he saw a purple flicker on the sword’s body from the corner of his eye. If he had not been attentive, he could have easily missed it.</p><p>“Senior Qin Liu said that Sky Scorpio Sword has some unique energies that come from materials obtained from the celestial bodies in the void. No other swords had such fluctuation…only this one has them.”</p><p>It was rare for artifacts to have special powers, and were usually carried by their forging materials. There was no chance for it to be duplicated. This sword was most likely the real deal.</p><p>“If it’s not, I’ll concede.” Ye Chen was confident in his choice. Sword artists were most afraid of hesitation after all.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>With his hands on the hilt, Ye Chen vigorously pulled out the sword.</p><p>The moment he pulled it out, a purple glow appeared on the Sky Scorpio Sword. Under the illumination of this purple glow, all the nearby Sky Scorpio Swords began to condense into purple crystals at a frightening speed. The purple crystals steadily enlarged, covering a perimeter of dozens of meters in the end,</p><p>“What kind of power is this?”</p><p>Ye Chen’s brows raised. Grabbing another ‘Sky Scorpio Sword’ beside him, Ye Chen applied a little pressure.</p><p>Pop! An astonishing scene occurred. This sword, which was at least a mid grade sword, shattered like a true purple crystal.</p><p>“Purple Crystal Iron…Sky Scorpio Sword actually has the Purple Crystal Iron.” Qin Liu blurted.</p><p>Yan Fengfeng asked, “Master, what is Purple Crystal iron? How come I had never heard of it before?”</p><p>Qin Liu said, “Extreme grade metals are also further divided, and the most reputed amongst these are ten great irons. Purple Crystal Iron is one of them, ranked seventh. It contains the power of crystallization. The majority of things only need a ray of its purple light to instantly crystallize. Even materials of similar ranks, if exposed to large amounts of its purple light, would also be damaged. It’s extremely tyrannous!”</p><p>“Then, this is the Sky Scorpio Sword?” Murong Qingcheng felt that the sword in Ye Chen’s hand, apart from its powerful purple light, didn’t have anything amazing about it.</p><p>Yi!</p><p>As soon as Murong Qingcheng spoke, the sword in Ye Chen’s hands suddenly enlarged. From four feet to three meters, five meters, ten meters…to thirty meters long. It was several times bigger than Ye Chen, completely overshadowing his figure.</p><p>As soon as the Sky Scorpio Sword enlarged, a frightening commotion aroused. The sword Qi in the mound turned chaotic and violent, seeming like a whirlwind. All the swords were pulled out of the ground on their own. Hovering in the air, they slowly started revolving around the Sky Scorpio Sword, as if offering their worships.</p><p>“This is the real Sky Scorpio Sword?” Metal Sword King’s eyes turned round like balls.</p><p>“Sure enough, the extreme grade Sky Scorpio Sword!” Ye Chen laughed heartily. Thirty meters long Sky Scorpio Sword was extremely heavy, weighing over ten thousand jin. Holding it in his hands seemed like holding a small mountain. In his understanding, apart from special pseudo extreme grade artifacts, only extreme grade artifacts could enlarge themselves. Moreover, he had already inspected it carefully. It was indeed an extreme grade artifact. It was the real deal.</p><p>“Congratulations, Ye Chen! Containing the Purple Crystal iron, this sword is outstanding even amongst extreme grade artifacts.”</p><p>Qin Liu was extremely envious of Ye Chen. How many Life and Death King were unable to get their hands on a extreme grade artifact despite desperately wishing for one. And Ye Chen had obtained an extreme grade sword merely at late Sea of Soul realm. If this matter leaked out, countless people would have their eyes turning crimson.</p><p>“This might be my destiny!”</p><p>Ye Chen was branding his soul imprint on the sword. Without branding his soul imprint, he had no way to make the sword revert back to its smaller form. If the sword didn’t shorten, not only would it take a lot of space, he wouldn’t be able to use it at all either.</p><p>“Right, you had one of the keys. You surely have a considerable connection with this place. The Sky Scorpio Sword ought to be yours.”</p><p>Ye Chen recalled that all the four people who obtained the keys had great luck bestowed on them.</p><p>Branding the sword was a simple matter. After tens of thousands of years, Sky Scorpio King’s soul imprint had dissipated since long ago. At this moment, this sword was on ownerless object. Branding it had no hindrance whatsoever. At most, it was a bit complicated.</p><p>Soon, Ye Chen successfully branded his soul imprint on Sky Scorpio Sword.</p><p>“Small.”</p><p>Ye Chen controlled the sword through his soul imprint.</p><p>Woosh!</p><p>The Sky Scorpio Sword shrunk back to its original dimension of four feet and two inches. Holding the sword in his right hand, Ye Chen casually waved twice without pouring any Zhen Yuan.</p><p>Screech!</p><p>Two crystalline scars appeared in the void, which was the manifestation of air crystallization. One could easily imagine an ordinary person killing to martial artist with just a wave of this sword, Of course, the prerequisite was to be able to lift this sword. It weighed over ten thousand jin. Ye Chen’s strength was over forty thousand jin. Adding the amplification of Zhen Yuan, it was equivalent of several hundred thousand jin.</p><p>“This sword is an extreme grade treasure. You absolutely can’t keep it. Give it to me and you’ll live a few more years. Otherwise, I’ll leak this matter outside, and you’ll die without a doubt.”</p><p>The Metal Sword King had restored his body at some point and was standing now while greedily staring at Sky Scorpio Sword in Ye Chen’s hand.</p><p>Ye Chen sized him up with a glance, “Perhaps you can’t keep it either?”</p><p>“I have my means. You better think again. You’ll lose your life by a simple mistake. Of course, I won’t take it for free and will compensate you. Otherwise, I’ll leak this matter outside. I presume there are many Life and Death Kings coveting this Sky Scorpio Sword.”</p><p>“My apologies, that’s not possible!” Ye Chen’s face turned cold.</p><p>“Then don’t blame me.”</p><p>With a swoosh, the Metal Sword King rushed toward the exit, raising his speed to the limits. Evidently, he was quite afraid of Ye Chen and Qin Liu’s combined assault.,</p><p>“He can’t leave!” Qin Liu took out Sky Hammer and was about to move.</p><p>“Senior, let me deal with it.”</p><p>Ye Chen would naturally not let off the Metal Sword King. If the latter had not threatened him, perhaps he would have hesitated and wouldn’t have immediately killed him. However, as of now, his death was imperative.</p><p>He raised his hand high in the air. Rich Zhen Yuan poured into the Sky Scorpio Sword following the center of his palm.</p><p>Yi!</p><p>The purple glow on the sword enlarged, creating a purple halo. At the same time, a wisp of purple radiance appeared at the sword’s tip, flickering indefinitely.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Blue veins appeared on Ye Chen’s forehead as he chopped down with both his hands.</p><p>Nobody could describe how stunning this sword was. The space inside the sword mound seemed to have turned sluggish and even stopped. All moving things seemed to have frozen at that instant; Gold Metal King’s speed also seemed to become increasingly slower, while he himself didn’t feel a thing.</p><p>The purple sword light was like a purple stream of light shuttling in the void as it slashed at Gold Metal King’s back in the blink of an eye, not allowing a moment of counterattack.</p><p>Kacha!</p><p>His body was directly cleaved into two. However, that was not the end of it. The two sections instantly crystallized, seeming like two chunks of purple crystals. After cleaving the Metal Sword King’s body, the purple radiance didn’t dissipate, and instead pierced through the mound’s passage wall across. In this manner, it pierced through multiple walls before finally dissipating.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>The two crystallized corpse sections dropped on the ground and shattered.</p><p>One sword, and the Metal Sword King died miserably without even being able to fight back.</p><p>Huff!</p><p>Seeing the Metal Sword King’s death, Ye Chen gasped heavily, his face extremely pale with sweat dripping down his forehead. Just now, one strike had sucked his entire body’s Zhen Yuan dry, and the sword seemed unwilling to not being able to suck out his blood. Such an instant depletion of Zhen Yuan made him extremely weak. He couldn’t even hold the sword properly as he stuck it into the ground.</p><p>“This Sky Scorpio Sword is simply an insatiable black hole.”</p><p>Ye Chen could indistinctly feel that the Zhen Yuan of his entire body was unable to let Sky Scorpio display its full might. Being able to exhibit fifty-sixty percent of its might would actually be considered good enough. Perhaps he would be able to fully use it once he became a half step King.</p><p>“Fortunately, I have the Dragon God Medal.”</p><p>Dragon Gold Medal was the highest medal of Dragon God Celestial Palace, and also a treasure which could store about one third of Ye Chen’s Zhen Yuan.</p><p>Activating the Dragon God Medal, large amounts of Zhen Yuan poured in Ye Chen’s body. This Zhen Yuan had the same origin as Ye Chen’s, without a trace of conflict.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
