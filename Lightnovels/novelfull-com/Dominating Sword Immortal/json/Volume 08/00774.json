Although his Zhen Yuan had been contaminated by vast quantities of demonic Qi, not only did this contamination not lower the destructive power of his Zhen Yuan, it actually amplified it.</p><p>As White Nightmare operated his Zhen Yuan at full force, grey-white Qi streams suddenly appeared out of nowhere, swirling around him. A frightening pressure erupted, even peeling layers off the mist surrounding the island. Many hills on the island disintegrated into dust, floating amidst the heaven and earth.</p><p>“His cultivation base is inferior to Blackwater Alliance’s Wang Taiyi, but is not one bit inferior to Flame Burst King. In terms of pressure, he is even higher. Demonic Humans are rightfully the rulers of Chaotic Demon Island. The resources at their disposal are terrifying!”</p><p>Half-step King realm was a process of accumulating Zhen Yuan—the richer the Zhen Yuan, the greater the hope of attaining the peak half-step King realm, and an opportunity of attacking the Life and Death realm. Without sufficient Zhen Yuan, Life and Death realm would seem forever out of reach, neither in sight nor touchable.</p><p>Zhen Yuan accumulation for half-step Kings was extremely challenging. If one cultivated with upper grade spirit stones, even a hundred years wouldn’t be enough to reach the peak of half-step King realm. One could fasten this process several times by using supreme grade spirit stones, but nothing could beat using Zhen Yuan crystals. It was a shortcut.</p><p>Unfortunately, supreme grade Zhen Yuan spirit stones were an extreme rarity, and even fifth grade sects might not have much of a reserve. On the other hand, Zhen Yuan crystals could only be produced by Life and Death Kings.</p><p>Flame Burst King had such a deep profound cultivation base precisely because he could get his hands on many Zhen Yuan crystals in the Devouring Islands. Wang Tiyi had twice the cultivation base of Flame Burst King, suspected to be a ‘strongest’ half-step King, because he was an important figure of Blackwater Alliance, and didn’t have to worry about Zhen Yuan crystals.</p><p>True Spirit Continent’s Thunder Spirit King was a true ‘strongest’ half-step King. It was not too likely for him to have a boundless supply of supreme grade stones, and Zhen Yuan crystals were even more unlikely. He probably had plenty of fortuitous encounters and obtained some other treasures that improved his cultivation base. After all, his age was not too high. If he had relied on accumulation, he would have to spend at least several decades.</p><p>Therefore, Ye Chen clearly understood that although talent was necessary for cultivation, resources were even more important. For example, in half-step King realm, as long as one had resources, their cultivation base could improve ten folds, even fifty folds faster than others.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>White Nightmare stepped and an energy ripple spread out. With a growl, his hands turned into countless phantoms, fiercely assaulting Ye Chen.</p><p>The space before White Nightmare rippled before a vast amount of gray-white Qi streams shout out like blade light; some spiraling, some slashing, some chopping, and some colliding amongst each other sharply. Within an instant, dense gray white Qi streams covered the heaven and earth, enveloping Ye Chen’s figure.</p><p>Ye Chen’s gaze sharpened as he took the trajectories of the Qi streams in. Unsheathing the Thunder Disaster Sword, he leaped and slashed, chopped, thrusted…Although the gray white Qi streams were numerous, not one could get within ten feet of Ye Chen as if it was an absolute forbidden zone.</p><p>Deng!</p><p>In the void, some Qi streams collided again, changing their directions. However, it was all futile. Ye Chen’s Spiritual Sword was swift to the extreme and acted without a sound. Some Qi streams attacked him from behind when he was striking Qi streams across him. But, as soon as they reached ten feet from him, they would still be immediately destroyed, yet White Nightmare never saw him act.</p><p>Ye Chen’s sword arts had become unfathomable under Life and Death realm. Any sort of finesse was useless before him. As if recognizing this matter, White Nightmare gave up on speed and turned to a powerful killer move.</p><p>“Void Expelling Chop!”</p><p>White Nightmare roared and his stiff right arm turned into a bone blade. Gray white Qi streams curled around the bone blade as it released a powerful strike against Ye Chen.</p><p>Rip!</p><p>The gray white blade Qi slashed out vertically, seeming tyrannous without match. At that moment, Ye Chen’s body shot up obliquely. Facing the blade Qi, he swept the sword across and a golden ripple burst out, disintegrating the blade Qi. Meanwhile, his other hand was not idle either. His fingers assumed a sword shape before he pointed them toward White Nightmare, who was standing far away.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>The Blood Ruin Sword was unsheathed and turned into nine sword phantoms, shooting toward White Nightmare from different directions.</p><p>“Sword Control Offense!”</p><p>White Nightmare was astonished. He had also heard about this lost art. According to the legends, there was once an era of sword artists in the ancient times, with numerous sword artists among martial artists. Sword Control Art was one of the most legendary sword arts of that time. This art had an extremely high requirements of soul power. If one wasn’t a genius in soul power, they would not be able to bring out the essence of Sword Control Art. Flying swords created through Sword Control Art were exceptionally swift and gave no reaction time to the opponent. Moreover, at its highest level of eighty one identical swords, just the name was enough to terrify anyone into fleeing.</p><p>Although Ye Chen’s Sword Control Art had not reached the realm of eighty one identical swords, it could not be underestimated. Just the speed of the swords was enough to send many into a stupor.</p><p>With absolutely no time to react, White Nightmare folded his arms over his chest and curled his body into a ball. Gray white Qi streams violently whirled around his body, creating a gray white light cover.</p><p>Clang Clang Clang!</p><p>Rip!</p><p>Most of the nine swords were bounced off but the main body of Blood Ruin Sword, which was the strongest, instantly pierced through his Zhen Yuan and was about to strike his body.</p><p>“Get off!”</p><p>White Nightmare’s curled body opened and a powerful Zhen Yuan erupted out of his body, seeming as if a gray white sun was erupting with all its energy, repelling the main body of Blood Ruin Sword.</p><p>“What a powerful Zhen Yuan!”</p><p>Ye Chen squinted his eyes. This sword could kill the majority of half-step Kings. Half a month ago, even that middle-aged demonic man in complete demonic form couldn’t avoid injuries from this sword. He didn’t expect that White Nightmare’s Zhen Yuan was even stronger than the completely transformed middle-aged demonic man. Sword Control Art would not have much effect on him.</p><p>The Blood Ruin Sword bounced off, and White Nightmare also retreated several steps. On his shoulder was a shallow sword scar, but it was merely a skin injury. The sword intent had already been expelled by his Zhen Yuan. However, Ye Chen merely had a late Sea of Soul realm cultivation. If he were at half-step King realm, wouldn’t one strike been enough to directly slay him?</p><p>“White Nightmare, stall him!” At this moment, the fat demonic man signaled White Nightmare with eyes.</p><p>“What are you up to?” White Nightmare replied with Zhen Yuan transmission.</p><p>“His companion is there, probably in a closed-door cultivation. As long as we can catch his companion, we can tie his hands and feet.”</p><p>The fat demonic man’s thoughts ran deeper than White Nightmare’s. Compared to killing Ye Chen, capturing him alive would be more in accordance with the wishes of the higher-ups. He had already ascertained the specific location of Ye Chen’s companion.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>White Nightmare was not some honest and forthright man. Obtaining their goals by fair means or foul was the style of demonic humans.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>Taking out a huge metal shield, White Nightmare inwardly said, “Now this is the superiority of us demonic humans, close-body combat. Let’s see what you can do now!”</p><p>Swish!</p><p>Holding the metal shield, White Nightmare pounced on Ye Chen.</p><p>“I can’t drag this out. This place is already discovered. More and more demonic humans will keep coming. But, I still need to kill these two quickly.” Ye Chen determined himself, not intending to waste any time.</p><p>“Waning Moon!”</p><p>Holding the sword with both hands, Ye Chen vigorously chopped down. A crescent-moon shaped sword energy flew out, leaving behind clear sword scar in the void which showed no signs of scattering away anytime soon.</p><p>Confronting this sword, White Nightmare’s entire world disappeared, only leaving behind Ye Chen’s figure. He seemed to have arrived in a boundless white world, directly confronting a boundless chilly black-colored sword energy.</p><p>“Hold!”</p><p>Not being able to muster any counterattack, White Nightmare could only raise the shield and shrink his body behind it. As he poured Zhen Yuan into the shield, a gray-white glow appeared on the shield. This glow expanded and transformed into a hill-sized shield, blocking the black sword energy.</p><p>Clang Clank!</p><p>Magnificent sparks flew around as a crack appeared on the shield and extended through it in every direction whilst emitting a metal-tearing sound. If not for White Nightmare’s sufficiently powerful Zhen Yuan, the shield would have shattered right at the beginning.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Holding the shield upside down, White Nightmare’s body shot off into the sky, leaving as fast as he had come. High in the air, he spurted out a mouthful of blood, his face turning completely pale.</p><p>The fat demonic man in the sidelines rushed toward Murong Qingcheng’s cultivation spot the moment Ye Chen acted, his figure turning into a rainbow colored light. However, he didn’t expect that White Nightmare would be defeated so quickly, leaving him no time.. He had to capture Ye Chen’s companion first to render him helpless.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Sensing the fat demonic man’s movements, Ye Chen turned and saw him already approaching Murong Qingcheng’s cultivation spot. Ordinary sword Qi would not be fast enough. Thus, he stretched his right index finger with a cold look and pointed toward the fat demonic man. It was none other than the Void Shattering Finger!</p><p>The fat demonic man was unable to see the trajectory of the finger energy. Ye Chen merely pointed, and the space around the fat demonic man warped. A majestic finger energy struck the latter, blasting him off tumbling in the air.</p><p>Woosh! Woosh!</p><p>Ye Chen repeatedly used Void Shattering Finger after the first’s success. Clear warping signs appeared in the void, bursting around the fat middle-aged man.</p><p>“What powerful finger energy!” The latter turned pale with fright, absolutely not daring to approach Murong Qingcheng’s cultivation site.</p><p>“Withdraw!”</p><p>The fat demonic man roared. With no intention of fighting, his figure streaked toward the mist while shouting at White Nightmare. Ye Chen’s face turned cold as he gave chase; however, the enchantment was extremely strange. As soon as he entered the mist, Ye Chen lost the two and almost himself as well.</p><p>Helpless, he could only withdraw from the mist, and his figure appeared in the air above the island again.</p><p>Outside the enchantment, White Nightmare incessantly spurted out blood.</p><p>“We underestimated him!” Seeing White Nightmare’s appearance, the fat demonic man said gloomily.</p><p>White Nightmare waved his hand, “I need to meditate…Don’t let anybody disturb me!” His injuries were too heavy. Even with a demonic human’s constitution, he had trouble enduring it.</p><p>Landing on a huge reef outside the island, White Nightmare sat cross-legged. He took out a red-colored pill and popped it in his mouth as he closed his eyes, healing with all his concentration.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
