But, it seemed impossible to lower that  number anymore, since his opponent’s evil qi recovery was only slightly  slower than the speed of its consumption. However, Ye Chen could not  maintain this destructive speed forever, since his opponent was rather  powerful after all and had that pseudo extreme level item in his hand,  which was still threatening for Ye Chen. After realizing that he could  not kill his opponent at the moment, Ye Chen threw out his space  profound sword attack the Bewitching Mirror Destruction when the skinny  young man was at his weakest.</p><p>Once he threw out the sword attack, the space around that skinny  young man started to twist and his body looked like it had been pushed  into a mirror. Even when he turned into the blurry evil qi and tried to  run around, he was still unable to escape.</p><p>Boom! With a loud noise, the ‘mirror’ shattered and the skinny young  man was also shattered into nothingness by that space power.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Ye Chen squinted his eyes as a blurry shadow suddenly appeared out of  nowhere in his vision. It was indeed the skinny young man. His body was  already so vague that it was barely visible to the naked eyes. If it  were not because of Ye Chen’s extra sharp vision, no one would be able  to notice it at all.</p><p>That pile of shadow continued to twist as if it was trying to get  back to its normal form. But, it eventually disappeared completely,  since there was nothing really left to do.</p><p>“Finally dead!”</p><p>The idea of a ‘never dying body with ever rich evil qi’ sounded  powerful, but as long as one could manage to burn out those creatures’  evil qi within a short period of time, leaving them nothing to absorb,  then they would be weak enough to kill for real. Of course, it would  have to be when the cultivation level of both sides was relatively even;  otherwise, it would be an almost impossible thing to do. Moreover,  there would be the risk of being hit, and once the evil qi got inside  one’s body, it would be hard to survive the battle. The reason Ye Chen  was able to kill the skinny young man was because that he had his Evil  shattering sword and Bewitching Mirror Destruction Attack. He would not  be able to make it without one or the other.</p><p>Whoo!</p><p>Letting out a breath, Ye Chen glanced and noticed Lin Yuxuan’s dead  body. It was almost out of instinct that he made a grabbing gesture,  sucking in Lin Yuxuan’s storage ring before casually throwing it into  his own ring.</p><p>Murong Qingchengg leaned over and said, “This evil qi is really  tricky. It was nothing like the typical kind, as if it had a mind of its  own somehow.”</p><p>Ye Chen said, “Yuan qi could birth lives such as the Wind Spirits and  Thunder Spirits that we had encountered before. So, this evil qi should  be able to create its own life forms as well.”</p><p>Some places with rich evil qi would have evil spirits at times.  However, those spirits should not be that powerful, and should only be  able to cause harm to warriors with lower cultivation. There would be  nothing they could do if they ran into powerful warriors. However, those  of whom were created in places with an extreme evil qi would be a  different story. The skinny young man and the other three people were  not humans or dead corpses; they might be life forms combined with evil  spirits.</p><p>Ye Chen was able to kill the skinny young man, but the rest of them  could not do the same. Although they also had Evil destroying items,  they did not have tricks up their sleeves that could allow them to burn  out a huge amount of evil qi within a short period of time. It was not  hard to tell how powerful Ye Chen’s Bewitching Mirror Destruction was.</p><p>“Thunder Devour!”</p><p>From afar, Ye Chen threw out a thunder ball at that bulky lady that was fighting against Jin Wanshuang.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A huge amount of thunder appeared and the bulky lady’s body started  to become transparent, a sign of burning out too much evil qi. Ye Chen’s  thunder devour contained a very powerful thunder power, which had a  cancelling effect on the evil qi. The destruction sword intent could  oppress everything. Combined with the Evil shattering sword’s special  attributes, the evil qi burning speed would not be weaker than  Bewitching Mirror Destruction Attack, and might be even more powerful.  The reason it was not used to fight against the skinny young man was  because it was more of a head-on battle, and the opponent still  controlled a pseudo extreme rank evil item, which would not allow  Thunder Devour to deliver its full power. However, this was a completely  different situation, since it was more of an ambush.</p><p>The opportunity was rare, and the monster hunting stick  in Jin Wanshuang’s hand turned into beams of golden light, shooting out  toward the lady at once. The latter did not even have the time to run at  all, and could only let her evil qi be burned out little by little. She  soon followed the young man from before and died slowly.</p><p>“Thank you!’ Jin Wanshuang nodded toward Ye Chen.</p><p>With two down, the remaining two were obviously no longer a threat.  With the four evil shattering items combined together, the four  creatures were wiped out completely.</p><p>What was worth mentioning was that those evil items started to crack  open and then eventually explode the second they lost their owners,  turning into rich evil qi. It subsequently all gathered toward that last  coffin in the center of the thirty-third floor.</p><p>“This does not look good.” Everyone then realized that the coffin lid had been moved toward the side by quite a lot already.</p><p>“Go attack the exit!” The elder was terrified as he held his purple  gold cloth and turned around to attack the exit, which was still covered  by many coffin lids. The rest of them did not say anything but started  to attack the coffin lids with their full power as well.</p><p>Being attacked by seven of them at the same time, the coffin lids  started to shake along with the shaken evil qi. At this moment, even the  lady in yellow started to look serious as she took out a dark blue  weapon from her storage ring. The pressure it contained was not weaker  than Ye Chen’s Evil shattering sword. It was obviously a pseudo extreme  rank item.</p><p>Holding her weapon, the lady made a groan as she threw out an attack onto the pile of coffin lids.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Its power even exceeded Ye Chen’s Bewitching Mirror Destruction. That  bright dark blue light was like a sun that vaporized countless evil qi.</p><p>“What!”</p><p>Everyone was shocked by her power.</p><p>“She is one of the strongest half step king warriors.” Murong Qingcheng said with a low voice.</p><p>Ye Chen nodded. “She had been hiding it well. With that pseudo  extreme rank item in hand, normal even top half step king warriors would  not be her opponents.”</p><p>Pseudo extreme rank items would be able to increase one’s power by  many times. The woman in yellow was already a top half step king  warrior, and with the pseudo extreme rank weapon, she would be  invincible against any warriors below Life and Death Realm, unless the  opponent was also one of the top half step king warriors with a similar  weapon. Without one or the other, it would be impossible to fight  against her.</p><p>Meanwhile, the coffin lid shook repeatedly and the gap started to get  bigger and bigger. It was right then that the evil qi suddenly started  to spin drastically before pouring into that coffin in the center.</p><p>With such a drastic change, everyone started to feel their bodies  getting colder and colder as frost started to appear on their  defensive Zhen yuan layer.</p><p>“Quickly!” Jin Wanshuang yelled.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The bright light appeared and layered over the other. At this moment, no one tried to hold back.</p><p>But unfortunately, it was still too slow.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The coffin lid of the coffin in the centre was lifted up suddenly and  a blurry human figure rose up before making a grabbing gesture with one  hand. With that, the levitating item was grabbed by him.</p><p>Ye Chen continued to attack while looking back, and could not help but be shocked at what he saw.</p><p>It was an expressionless elder in yellow. His clothes were torn apart  and looked like they were going to be ripped apart completely. A  strange weapon was held in his hand that looked like two great swords  that had been combined together, thus having two sword tips. Ice cold  sword light shot out from both swords into the air.</p><p>“This is the Mysterious Evil King! It must be! This time…we are doomed!”</p><p>The elder had almost completely lost hope. Judging from that powerful  evil qi emitting from the elder in yellow, he was clearly a Life and  Death Realm warrior before he died. And that strange looking weapon was  definitely an extreme rank weapon. Each one of the two things were  enough to kill them within a second, not to even mention when the two  were combined.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Different from the four evil creatures that appeared before him, this  “Mysterious Evil King” was able to speak out simple words. But, it was  indeed the words that put everyone in great danger.</p><p>When the first “die” was heard, all seven of them were blown backward  aggressively, and then pressed onto the walls. They could feel  dizziness in their heads and their hearts pounding ten times faster in  their chests. They could feel the blood inside their bodies going  backward and their limbs going numb. When the first “die” was heard,  besides Ye Chen, Murong Qingchengg, that woman in yellow, and  Daer Xiong, the remaining three started to bleed from all over their  bodies. They could hear their heart pounding like drums.</p><p>“Soul sound wave attack!” Ye Chen was shocked.</p><p>The soul sound wave attack was using soul power like sound waves as  an attack. It could not only wound the souls, but also the physical body  drastically. If one was weak in either areas, they would be killed  instantly. No matter if it was death in soul or the physical death, it  would result in an irreversible consequence.</p><p>“Immortal! Stop!”</p><p>The first thing Ye Chen thought of was not himself,  but Murong Qingcheng. Although she carried the perfect half step demon  bloodline, her soul was not as powerful at all, which might lead to a  soul death. In this critical moment, that immortal sword spirit that had  recently made a breakthrough finally formed completely into rank 4. But  right then, Ye Chen did not even realize the breakthrough at all; all  he was thinking was to protect Murong Qingcheng at all costs.</p><p>Right then, the third “die” finally arrived.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The heads of Jin Wanshuang, the elder, and that cold-looking young  man exploded instantly, and blood poured out everywhere. It was a sign  of soul being shattered and their Zhen yuan no longer fully controlled.</p><p>Pooh!</p><p>Although the woman in yellow was a top half step king warrior and her  soul defense layer was extremely powerful, it was still not strong  enough to block out the attack. So, she puked out a blood arrow, looking  extremely pale.</p><p>With Ye Chen’s immortal sword intent’s  protection, Murong Qingcheng’s soul was fortunately intact, but this  soul sound had still managed to go through the sword intent slightly and  land onto her soul ocean, which knocked her out completely. It was  still unclear whether she was still alive or not.</p><p>As for Ye Chen, he was struggling to survive as well. His soul power  was five times more powerful than the others, but because he still did  not manage to train the soul defense layer yet, the soul sound wave had  punctured through directly into his soul ocean and caused a rampage in  there.</p><p>Sensing that their owner was in danger, Ye Chen’s destruction sword  spirit and immortal sword spirit blossomed a bright sword light and  shone above the soul ocean, clearing out all the soul sound waves.</p><p>Amongst the seven, only Daer Xiong did not look like he was struggling at all, which was very strange.</p><p>“Am I going to die here?”</p><p>After finally surviving the soul sound wave, he looked at the  Mysterious Evil King floating in the midair and a forced smile appeared  on his face. He had only said three words, and it almost killed all of  them. If he actually threw out an attack, he wondered if he could make  it through.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>But right then, something happened again. The coffin lids were  attacked by a crazy power and got blown into the air from the outside.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
