If Ye Chen’s improvement has slowed down even a bit, he might be overtaken.” Li Xiaoyun sucked in a deep breath and muttered.</p><p>Ye Chen’s rise had been too absurd, making Li Xiaoyun hesitate to give a verdict. Although Dugu Jue was strong, he couldn’t simply bring himself to say that the other had surpassed Ye Chen. Moreover, Ye Chen was from South Rudra Region, making Li Xiaoyun a little biased.</p><p>“Ye Chen’s expression…is calm.”</p><p>Jing Aoxuan was about to reply, but when she saw Ye Chen’s relaxed expression, she turned pensive.</p><p>“Good thing I didn’t step out.”</p><p>Situ Hao’s brows creased. He discovered that a polarization had begun to occur among the numerous geniuses of Sky Martial Region. The strong were getting stronger, and even though weak were also getting stronger, the disparity between the two sides was incessantly increasing. He found out that he himself was in danger of being left behind. This was not a good sign.</p><p>“That’s good too. No point in striving for a day’s worth…only striving for an eternity has meaning.”</p><p>Feeling an intense crisis, Situ Hao restrained his pride. A great age was about to begin, and the geniuses would gradually separate into different levels. Among the once five young tyrants, only Bai Wuxue didn’t fall, standing with Ye Chen, Dugu Jue, and others at the first line. The others had already begun to fall behind. And this was merely the beginning. It could already be seen who had the potential to enter Life and Death realm. Like waves washing the sand and inferno smelting iron, only those tested thoroughly would be able to keep themselves from falling behind.</p><p>If he didn’t strive, he might not even make the second line.</p><p>“You have the qualifications to be my opponent.” Liu Wujian looked at Dugu Jue, his battle intent rising slowly.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>Sheathing his blade, Dugu Jue flickered on a summit. Standing tall, he said, “My target is Ye Chen, and only him. You have to beat him first.”</p><p>Liu Wujian and Ye Chen were both sword artists. Before Ye Chen revealed his strength, Dugu Jue would never change his target to Liu Wujian.</p><p>“Fine, that won’t be hard.”</p><p>Liu Wujian’s face turned slightly stiff. Dugu Jue’s rejection irked him somewhat. In his view, him recognizing the latter was already enough to be proud.</p><p>“Liu Wujian!”</p><p>As Liu Wujian was turning his gaze to Ye Chen, Lu Shaoyou stepped out under numerous astonished gazes.</p><p>Creasing his brows, Liu Wujian spoke, “You were not my opponent half a year ago, and you’re not at present either. You better step back.”</p><p>“It’s true that I’m not sure of defeating you at all, but you won’t be able to defeat me as easily as before.” Lu Shaoyou said with his hand on the hilt.</p><p>“Hm, seems like you’ve made quite an improvement in these six months.”</p><p>“You will know once you try.”</p><p>“Elder brother Liu doesn’t need to…I’ll fight you.”</p><p>The multicolor-robed woman was one of the spectators of the fight between Lu Shaoyou and Li Wujian half a year ago, and thus, she was quite clear on the former’s strength. She firmly believed that his strength couldn’t have increased too much during this half year, and thus, he was unworthy of being Lu Wujian’s opponent.</p><p>“Take this!”</p><p>The multicolor-robed woman whipped toward Lu Shoayou, while a fierce gleam flickered in the latter’s eyes. He immediately unsheathed his longsword, shooting dozens of sword Qi arcs which assaulted the multicolor-robed woman from every direction.</p><p>Puff Puff Puff!</p><p>The whip phantom and sword Qi collided, giving off incessant muffled explosions. However, Lu Shaoyou’s strike was not so simple. All the sword Qi beams had different trajectories—circling, straight, spiraling, arcing…and so on. After neutralizing the whip phantom, a few sword Qi continued onward at lightning speed.</p><p>“Fire Crystal Shield!”</p><p>The multicolor-robed woman immediately used her defensive profound skill.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In the next moment, the multicolor-robed woman retreated ten steps with a stupefied face.</p><p>“How is this possible? His strength has increased by more than fifty percent compared to half a year ago.”</p><p>She couldn’t not be astonished.</p><p>Bai Wuxue faintly nodded; Lu Shaoyou was not a person to give up so easily. Defeat would only serve to augment his improvement. This fact had been repeatedly tested in the past. His ten-move defeat clearly not only didn’t make him a recluse, it made him cultivate even more crazily, allowing him to burst forth with an unprecedented potential. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have stepped out to challenge Liu Wujian again.</p><p>“Alright, that’s good. It will be a warm up before the big battle! Don’t disappoint me.”</p><p>Liu Wujian’s clothes were long and free like his long hair. Both fluttered in the air as he walked toward Lu Shaoyou, stopping a hundred steps away from him.</p><p>“Come!” Liu Wujian’s both hands were folded behind his back.</p><p>“Sky Slaughter Sword Art!”</p><p>As Liu Wujian was walking toward him, Lu Shaoyou was accumulating strength and sword aura. The moment the former stopped, he immediately attacked. As if overlooking the spatial distance, Lu Shaoyou’s sword slashed and a storm arose while sword Qi burst out into the sky, seeming omnipresent.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Liu Wujian’s left hand was still behind his back as he swiftly pulled out his sword with the right hand and slashed several times in the void, destroying all of the incoming sword QI.</p><p>Fast!</p><p>The epitome of fast!</p><p>Liu Wujian’s sword arts were much faster than Lu Shaoyou’s. That sky-covering sword Qi couldn’t even approach the former’s body.</p><p>“Sky Judgement Sword!”</p><p>Lu Shaoyou obviously know that Liu Wujian’s swordplay was freakishly fast and almost unrivaled. However, he was already prepared and was not surprised. With a deep breath, the Zhen Yuan in his body erupted and poured into the longsword in his hand. The longsword slightly distorted, raising a light breeze that couldn’t be seen with naked eyes, and thrust out toward Liu Wujian who was not too far away.</p><p>Blop!</p><p>Liu Wujian’s surroundings refracted as if present in a mirror—a mirror that could shatter at any moment.</p><p>“Good attack power…but it still can’t harm me.”</p><p>Liu Wujiajn single-handedly slashed upside down, employing the most vigorous and boundless Ocean Shifter Sword Qi. A deep white sword Qi suddenly engulfed the heaven and earth, sweeping away Lu Shaoyou’s sword aura as well as nullifying the refracted space.</p><p>Whizz!</p><p>The remnant sword Qi continued onward towards Lu Shaoyou.</p><p>“En? He can see through the weak point of this move!”</p><p>Bai Wuxue was deeply knowledgeable of this move. It seemed as if this move was shattering the void from faraway, but it was merely a trick. Wind was nothing but air flow in the sky and was ever present. This move contained the wind profound which turned the wind chaotic, creating instability in the space. It was far off from truly shattering the void.</p><p>Of course, even if it involved trickery, its strength couldn’t be underestimated. Its only weak point was that the power was spread out in too vast a space, and was not concentrated at all. Otherwise, it was a move with first class offensive power.</p><p>“Chaotic Wind Strike!”</p><p>Confronting the white Sword Qi, Luo Shaoyou remained calm. He slashed a circle with the sword, unleashing a storm of sword Qi.</p><p>Peng Peng Peng!</p><p>The deep white sword Qi was slashed into thousands of sword threads, some of which hit Lu Shaoyou. His clothes were cut at the sleeves and shoulders while his mouth corner was also leaking a thin trail of blood.</p><p>“It doesn’t look good for Lu Shaoyou…Although he has improved very quickly, possibly claiming his position among the five young tyrants back, Liu Wujian is simply too strong! He is suppressing Lu Shaoyou while holding his sword with only one hand, and he doesn’t seem to be serious either.”</p><p>Liu Wujian stepped out, instantly appearing before Lu Shaoyou. The longsword in his hand disappeared, and a white sword curtain enveloped around Lu Shaoyou.</p><p>Clank Clank Clank!</p><p>Sparks flew about as Lu Shaoyou desperately tried to fend off Liu Wujian’s offensive. The latter’s sword turned increasingly swift, unwittingly surpassing his limits.</p><p>“You’ve improved indeed!”</p><p>The left hand behind his back turned free. His movements gradually turned agile and erratic; his sword Qi turned berserk like thunder, swift like wind, and violent like a torrential wave.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>Unable to dodge, Lu Shaoyou was struck by a sword Qi, retreating three hundred steps. The blood trickling down the corner of his mouth turned increasingly thicker, but his eyes remained glaringly bright.</p><p>“Metal Wind!”</p><p>Holding the sword with both hands, Lu Shaoyou used the fruits of half a year—his strongest move, a sword move containing the fusion of wind and metal.</p><p>In that moment, a seemingly substantive golden sword wind rippled toward Liu Wujian.</p><p>Liu Wujian’s brows raised. This Lu Shaoyou was not too powerful half a year ago. But during half a year, not only had his strength increased to the level of Master Sky Sword, taking nearly a hundred moves from him, he even created a strong killer move. Without any hesitation, Liu Wujian used one of his own killer moves as well—Thousand Li Thread.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The Golden Sword Wind and concentrated sword Qi thread collided, and the former was immediately cut through. However, the Golden Sword Wind seemed endless, waning down a lot of power contained in the thread and creating a golden-white shockwave in the process, which engulfed both of them.</p><p>Spurting out a huge mouthful of blood, Lu Shaoyou obliquely flew off, finally unable to endure. On the other hand, Liu Wujian also retreated dozens of steps for the first time.</p><p>“Yi, Lu Shaoyou also lost!”</p><p>“It was an honorable defeat. Half a year ago, he couldn’t even take ten moves.</p><p>But this time, he exchanged hundred moves. His strength has increased by more than half.”</p><p>“Yeah, he knew for sure that he won’t be able to win, and just wanted to test his strength.”</p><p>Unable to take ten moves was disgraceful, but exchanging hundred moves was an entirely different matter. Although, it seemed that Liu Wujianw as not using his full strength.</p><p>Huff!</p><p>Ye Chen let out a breath and said, “It should be my turn.”</p><p>“Don’t be careless.” Murong Qingcheng warned.”</p><p>“I know. With his strength, I couldn’t even if I wanted to.”</p><p>Against the wind, Ye Chen’s sword aura spread out, extending like night and covering the entire Nine Dragon Mountains.</p><p>There was no need for any reminder, and everybody’s gaze was pulled over at once. In their eyes, the heaven and earth had disappeared, leaving behind only Ye Chen. The world in their perception was that of deathly stillness. Those who were near discovered that they couldn’t even speak, as if they had drowned in a nightmare—able to think, but not able to move.</p><p>“Such a frightening sword intent!”</p><p>Bai Wuxue sucked in a deep breath, his eyes carrying a deep astonishment. Dugu Jue was also somewhat astonished while his hands started to shiver with excitement. This was a feeling that nobody else could provide him—so much apprehension, so much expectation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
