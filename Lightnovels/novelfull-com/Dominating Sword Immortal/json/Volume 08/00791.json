Vaguely, a bad vibe could be felt spreading out. Seas of Souls Realm warriors would be frightened in front of this tower, not to mention to enter. But, this did not include Ye Chen and the others. Not only were they half step king warriors, they were the top of the top. Unless if it was a Life and Death Realm warrior, no one could really threaten them. And whoever was to try his luck would be made to pay a great price.</p><p>This evil qi would not be something they preferred to be around, but they would not back out from it. The road to Life and Death Realm was meant to be full of obstacles and deadly traps, so this evil qi could not scare them off at all.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>Pushing open the front gate, the nine of them walked in, and the door closed automatically right afterward. At the same time, a creepy sound was heard as well.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>The second the nine people entered, the pitch black first level was lit up by the burning flame around them. The flame was close to the walls and extended all the way into the distance.</p><p>Soon, the first level was well lit, but the light was not warm at all; instead, it was cold like ice.</p><p>Ye Chen casually glanced at the flame, and was surprised at what he found out. He said slowly word after another, “This flame is lighted by skulls.”</p><p>“What?” Hearing him, everyone looked toward the flame.</p><p>On the wall, a rusty chain locked on a skull with a hole in it. A beam of cold flame released from within was burning stably. Because the flame was not bright and the light was projected outwards, the wall surface was still pitch black, so naked eyes could barely see though. Naturally, the skull would be easily missed. Only after being reminded by Ye Chen did everyone notice this little detail. All of them gasped at what they saw.</p><p>“Lighting with skulls…What an evil way to get light!” The elder frowned as he continued to look at the surroundings.</p><p>Lin Yuxuan said, “Perhaps this place is indeed an evil martial school? No wonder it caused such tragic consequences.”</p><p>“We can no longer find out about it I guess. But, judging from our current situation, it could very well be that case. Perhaps the Zhen Shui palace was trying to use some kind of forbidden martial art, and triggered a horrible backlash.” Jin Wanshuang spoke the thoughts on his mind.</p><p>“Alright…Who cares about white skulls lighting up the place and some evil martial schools? We did not come here to judge the place. We came here to find treasures.” The twin brothers were getting impatient.</p><p>“That’s right indeed. Let’s go!” Jin Wanshuang started walking forward.</p><p>After about half an hour after the nine entered the tower, a group of familiar people arrived outside. It was indeed Shi Shaobao and his people.</p><p>They had rested two days since being transported out of the palace. After that, they came to the highest tower directly, but were still one step slower than Ye Chen and the group.</p><p>“Why is this tower giving out such creepy vibes?” The middle aged lady said hesitantly.</p><p>“If you are afraid, then you do not have to come.” Shi Shaobao led the rest of them and walked into the tower without a moment of hesitation. The middle-aged lady bit on her teeth and soon followed behind.</p><p>…</p><p>The first eighteen levels of the tower had nothing, Ye Chen and his people went to the nineteenth level, which was way creepier. Waves of cold wind came out of nowhere, making their hair stand on their back.</p><p>“Everyone be careful.” Jin Wanshuang’s voice was heard.</p><p>“Yeah, the evil qi here is richer, and a strange vibration appears at times as well. Do not underestimate it.” The old man was the most cautious of them all, but it did not mean that he was afraid of dying. The people who were afraid of dying might not be as cautious after all. Most of them just did not want to die for nothing.</p><p>The older brother said, “It was not me being reckless and looking for trouble. I think we do not have to worry about anything. We are basically invincible below the Life and Death Realm warriors, and only they might be able to kill us. Of course, even if we run into their realm, it would just be our bad luck, and there would be no use of us being cautious all the time. Besides, I really cannot think of anyone who could kill us all at the same time.”</p><p>The elder thought these two little b*stards were making too big of a deal out of themselves, so he could not help but say, “What about half step king warriors? If a top half step king warrior wants you dead, it should not be hard, right?”</p><p>Daer Xiong froze a bit, as he did not know what to say. Although they were all basically invincible in their own turfs, there was still a gap between them and the most powerful half step king warriors. It would not be hard for any one of the top half step king warriors to try to kill any one of them.</p><p>Daer Xiong fought back, “Although the top half step king warrior could kill me, but then they would not be able to kill all of us, right?”</p><p>“And you think the potential enemies would only be one person at a time?” The elder sneered.</p><p>Seeing the two fight, Ye Chen smiled lightly. The elder was not worried for no reason; although they were all top elites from different regions, they would more likely lose if they run into a top half step king warrior individually. Moreover, there were just way too many things that could kill them, such as some evil traps, some poisons, and destructive powers. The reason that the twins might be so reckless was probably because they thought that they would not have to worry about ambushes with their own power.</p><p>“Alright, you guys are really annoying.” Lin Yuxiao could no longer handle this kind of mouth fights, so he said with a low voice.</p><p>Anyhow, the ninteenth floor was again safe.</p><p>The twentieth floor…</p><p>…</p><p>The twenty-seventh floor…</p><p>“Damn, there is nothing here! Don’t tell me that there is nothing up there either!”</p><p>Another seven levels and yet they still did not find anything. There were no treasures or dangers; it was just a very boring situation for the group. They were even starting to wish for a little bit of danger, so that at least there would be something there to do.</p><p>Soon enough, everyone reached the thirty-second level. The highest level was only one wall away, and it was right then that some things happened.</p><p>On a square stone platform were laid four items — a great sword, monster slaying stick, purple gold cloth, and a jade ruler. Besides that, there was an ink painting right next to the four items. It was half open and half close, and there seemed to be a human figure in it.</p><p>“Great items!” Everyone’s eyes were brightened.</p><p>The whole tower had been such a disappointing experience, so it was understandable for them to expect not as many great items like those treasure islands. But, they thought that there still should be something. No one had expected that there would have been literally nothing so far.</p><p>So right then, these four items had intrigued the group, and everyone started to have their own thoughts going on in their minds. The way they were looking at each other started to seem more and more unfriendly.</p><p>There were only four of them, and being able to be here on the thirty-second floor, they were deemed to be special. But, there were nine of them, so it would be unfair for some no matter how they tried to calculate the split.</p><p>Then, in that case, there was only one solution left.</p><p>Ye Chen could sense the change of atmosphere, so he said, “We do not know the ranking for these items yet, so there is no point in fighting for them yet.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
