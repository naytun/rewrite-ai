However, the second he stepped one foot out, a black hole suddenly appeared in the sky above this part of the ocean and struck a beam of gold lightning at that foot of his within half a second.</p><p>Pap!</p><p>His whole foot was burned into ashes before it started to spread toward the rest of his body. But, when he reentered the tower, that gold flame disappeared automatically. With that, the Mysterious Evil King gave up on the idea of ever leaving the tower.</p><p>Above the ocean, the elder’s figure appeared. He lifted his head and saw that the black hole was slowly disappearing. His expression changed along with it couple of times.</p><p>“Although the tower can limit the Mysterious Evil King’s freedom, it increases his battling power by so many times…Damn it! I cannot believe that battle cost me hundreds of years of training. It would take me at least a couple of months to recover.”</p><p>The elder was not happy. Although the decrease in his training results could not decrease his battling power, it would affect his endurance. What was the most important was that if he did not try to fix the damage, the longer he left it, the longer it would take him to get back to his peak condition.</p><p>“They should not have run far yet. Should I go chase after them?” A hesitation flashed past the elder’s face.</p><p>Pooh!</p><p>But suddenly, he let out a mouthful of blood with cold qi. His blood was gray colored, and once it touched the air, it started to make a sizzling sound.</p><p>“Damn! Let’s get rid of the evil qi inside my body first.”</p><p>Realizing how much evil qi had gotten into his body, which would affect his recovery massively, the elder in black gave up on chasing after Murong Qingchengg. To him, what was the most important thing right now would be his recovery. Once recovered, it would be a piece of cake to find someone, so there was no need for him to be so harsh on himself.</p><p>Pop!</p><p>Hence, his figure disappeared like black foam.</p><p>…</p><p>Ye Chen took Murong Qingcheng to a hidden building within the ruins. He knew that if he went back the way they came from, then they would definitely run into the exploding fireflies, and he did not have the confidence to escape with Murong Qingcheng without being wounded right now. So, he thought he might as well wait for her to recover first before leaving.</p><p>However, Ye Chen was a bit anxious as well. He was not sure how long it would take a warrior to recover from a soul damage. It might be a quick recovery or might be a long process, or she might never wake up again. It all depended on luck, and whether if Murong Qingcheng’s soul was strong enough or not.</p><p>Laying down some beddings, Ye Chen carefully lay down Murong Qingcheng on top. He watched her pale but beautiful face and sighed before sitting back and starting to heal himself.</p><p>If it were a normal warrior, they would be wounded drastically under that overlapping blast waves. It would be impossible to recover within three to five days. But luckily, Ye Chen had trained the entry level Undying Body Art; as long as he was not wounded in the core, he would be able to recover within a short period of time. So, he was not worried about that at all.</p><p>After half an hour, he slowly opened his eyes and let out a breath.</p><p>“I did not expect to actually gain something from that traumatizing experience. Mysterious Evil King’s soul sound wave pushed the limit of what my heart could take, but it also activated the effect of that heart nourishing plant. Normally, it would take me a month or so for the plant’s effect to get to my heart, but now, it only took one week.”</p><p>“With this opportunity, I will try to reach the half step king warrior realm once again. Even if I cannot make it, I will familiarize with it nonetheless.”</p><p>Once he made up his mind, he started his second go at the realm.</p><p>…</p><p>On the fifth day, Murong Qingcheng made a light moan as she woke up from her deep coma.</p><p>“I am not dead!”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng thought she was dead for sure, since her soul ocean was all blurred out and in chaos. Turning her head, she saw Ye Chen sitting on the ground. Light steam came out of his body, making her feel as if she was lying right next to a fireplace.</p><p>She knew that Ye Chen was giving a second try at the half step king warrior realm, so she did not call for him. She crawled up from the ground and sat with her feet tugged below her body. Then, she took a deep breath before entering the recovery state.</p><p>On the eighth day, Ye Chen finally woke up.</p><p>Whoo!</p><p>“Still not working, I guess. I think I will need to train all of the remaining three heart nourishing plants, then perhaps I will have a chance.” Anyhow, he was happy that the training of the first heart nourishing plant was finally complete.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng could feel Ye Chen moving right next to her, so she opened her eyes.</p><p>“Still not working?”</p><p>Ye Chen said joyously, “You are awake!”</p><p>“Yeah, it feels like I just had a long dream!” Murong Qingcheng leaned over onto Ye Chen. Being able to survive that was a gift from the universe, as she did not want to die.</p><p>“As long as you are awake…As for me reaching half step king warrior realm, there is no rush, I will make it eventually.” When Murong Qingcheng was still asleep, he also felt that he was not fully focusing, because he was deeply worried about her recovery. It was the core of his soul which was tricky to get around.</p><p>He put his arms around her and then stood up, “Since you are awake, let’s leave this place first. This is not a good place to be in.”</p><p>“What happened to the Mysterious Evil King?” She suddenly asked, since she had no idea how he had moved her here.</p><p>Ye Chen said with laughter, “You would have to thank the demon king from your race who fought against the Mysterious Evil King, which gave us the chance to escape. Otherwise, it would be impossible to leave that place alive. As for the Mysterious Evil King and the demon king, I think they are both alive, since once one gets to their level, it would be very hard for them to kill one another.”</p><p>“It is the Demon King that had messed up the demon ocean!” Murong Qingcheng said with a shaken voice.</p><p>“I suppose so. In the near future, I will try my best to enter half step king warrior realm. Otherwise, it would be impossible for us to have a fighting chance against any of them.”</p><p>Although Ye Chen would still have no chance fighting against a Life and Death Realm warrior even after entering the half step king warrior realm, he could be able to increase his cultivation fast enough with enough Zhen yuan crystals. Then, adding his own experience, it would be better than no hope by then.</p><p>With Murong Qingcheng waking up, escaping the area was way easier than before. Those fireflies would not do anything to them due to Murong Qingcheng’s dark power field. Leaving the ruins, the two dove under the sea for a long time until they were one hundred thousand miles away from the place, before resurfacing on the ocean.</p><p>Whoo!</p><p>Finally able to breathe fresh air, the two could not feel any better.</p><p>“Let’s go find an empty island.” Ye Chen took a look around before saying to Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>“I think my cultivation is ready to move onto the next level.” She nodded.</p><p>…</p><p>Above that endless ocean, it would be too easy to find an island. They managed to find a relatively safer island within a short period of time.</p><p>After burning out one full heart nourishing plant’s worth, Ye Chen took the second one. While he was focusing on training, he was also trying to learn his space profound deeper, as well as his Bewitching Mirror Destruction attack. Thinking of all of them together actually had a special effect on him.</p><p>As his first space profound sword art, the Bewitching Mirror Destruction Attack had opened a door for him. As he learned more and more about it, he realized more and more about how deep the space profound really was. Wherever people were, there would be a space; it would not be a box, more like a container that carried everything. Even time was intertwined within it.</p><p>As his Bewitching Mirror Destruction Attack improved, he could vaguely feel that what he saw was changing, and it was different from before. Before, it was more limited to the surface, but he could already see through the surface now, deep into the core of the problems. In the beginning, he was still not quite used to it, and he felt that it was too deep for him. But once he got used to the new way of looking at things, it helped him learn things much faster.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>As he threw out a sword attack, the ocean water on the east coast of the island started to scramble. It then suddenly separated into different layers, each layer looking like a glass container itself.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The space power covered ocean water splashed into the air.</p><p>“I think I have reached eighty or even ninety percent now.” Putting his Evil shattering sword back into its scabbard, Ye Chen let the ocean water splash on him.</p><p>Without them really noticing it, one month had gone by. By now, the second heart nourishing plant had been cultivated. Compared to the beginning, Ye Chen’s heart was stronger by more than twice. With his blood increasing in speed, his heart was able to pump firmly and make loud pounding noises. It was enough of a vibration to shake the mud on the ground.</p><p>Ye Chen dove down into the ocean water once, where his pulse shook a rank 4 beast to death before going on with him being the center. It would be hard to imagine how powerful his heart had become.</p><p>However, it was not over yet, as Ye Chen officially started to train his third plant. Once this one was trained successfully, he would give the half step king warrior level another go. And this time, he would only allow victory and nothing else.</p><p>Over on the other side, a rich demon power skyrocketed, dying the sky black. Amidst the waves of black winds was the island struggling to ‘stand’ still in the ocean.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng’s cultivation had obviously improved, getting closer and closer to the experienced half step king warriors. Besides that, her soul defense layer had thickened and strengthened as well. For example, that lady in yellow was a top half step king warrior, and when she was stuck by the Mysterious Evil King’s soul sound wave attack, she was only wounded slightly without fainting, which was indeed the effect of the soul defensive layer.</p><p>Ye Chen carried a rank 5 destruction sword soul, rank 4 immortal sword soul, and five times more powerful soul power. Even if he were not a half step king warrior, he was still able to block out that attack, and might be even more powerful than that lady in yellow in some ways. Once he reached half step king warrior realm and formed his soul defense layer, not many amongst the Life and Death Realm warriors would be able to use a soul attack and manage to wound him. Of course, that was unless it was some kind of heaven realm high rank attacking secret art.</p><p>Another month passed again.</p><p>At this moment, a huge wave suddenly rose out of nowhere. It was in a circular shape before spreading out aggressively. And that was not the end of itas , a massive water ball appeared suddenly and kept expanding until it was dozens of meters big, before finally exploding.</p><p>Dong! Dong! Dong! Dong! Dong!</p><p>Loud explosions were heard on the island. Some of the seagulls hurried to flap their wings and escape from where they were standing.</p><p>“With three heart nourishing plants, they are able to strengthen my heart to this level. I think the chance of me reaching half step king realm would at least be seventy percent.”</p><p>Ye Chen shot out from under the water and then stood on a rock.</p><p>What he did not know was that even though the three plants had strengthened him to this extent, it was mainly because he trained the undying martial art, as everyone had a limit. If the medicine was too rich, then it would just go to waste. If it were someone else training three plants, then they might not be able to extract their full potential. But, because of his undying body, he was able to maximize the potential in his body, and his absorption was endless like a black hole.</p><p>Therefore, although the undying body looked irrelevant to a lot of things, whether that was true or not was something that no one knew for sure, not even Ye Chen.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
