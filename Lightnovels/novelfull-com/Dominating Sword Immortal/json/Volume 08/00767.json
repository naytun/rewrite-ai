You should be quite clear of your circumstances now, so don’t do anything stupid.”</p><p>Whiz!</p><p>Saying these words, Ye Chen pointed his sword fingers. The Blood Ruin Sword turned into a blood ray, shooting toward the spear artist fighting with Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>This spear artist was quite formidable, as he was able to raise his spear at the crucial moment to defend. Unfortunately, Ye Chen’s Sword Control Art had already attained the realm of Nine Identical Swords. He was able to resist the sword’s main body, but had no time for the sword images. Spurting out blood, he retreated back.</p><p>Almost all the experts brought by Sima Zonguan had received heavy injuries while the former himself could be either dead or alive.</p><p>Under Ye Chen’s deterrence, nobody dared to move; it would be meaningless even if they wanted to do so. Their current strength had been greatly reduced. Their bodies had a trace of the Destruction Sword Intent, which was extremely difficult to get rid of. Even the slightest bit of carelessness would allow it to enter their Sea of Soul and injure their soul.</p><p>Plundering these people’s Zhen Yuan crystals, Ye Chen felt quite surprised. They had a little too few crystals—at most five hundred and at least one hundred. In total, they didn’t have even three thousand crystals. They might as well have been a chief of Black Power.</p><p>Ye Chen didn’t know that the Blackwater Alliance was different from the Black Powers. Their Zhen Yuan crystals were stored in warehouses instead of carrying them on their person. If they were ordered to leave the island, they would naturally be compensated fully by the alliance. On the other hand, although chiefs of Black Powers had many Zhen Yuan crystals, they couldn’t go out. They were like reared fat sheep. No matter how much fat they had on their body, it didn’t matter.</p><p>Sima Zonguan was not dead. The moment he appeared above the ocean, he was instantly subdued by Ye Chen and his storage ring was snatched.</p><p>“You dare!” Sima Zonguan turned pale. He didn’t expect that Ye Chen would have such guts to even rob them.</p><p>“You’re still talking that? Don’t you think it’s too ridiculous?” Wiping off the former’s soul imprint from the ring, Ye Chen sent a trace of consciousness inside. “Hehe…seems like you’re one of the top characters. Your ring actually has a hundred thousand crystals.”</p><p>As long as a half-step King gave a hundred thousand Zhen Yuan crystals, they could leave. Sima Zonguan could clearly leave the island at any moment.</p><p>“You’ll regret it!”</p><p>Sima Zonguan naturally knew that he was not Ye Chen’s opponent, and could only watch him take the crystals.</p><p>“We’ll see.” Collecting the Zhen Yuan crystals, Ye Chen nodded at Murong Qingcheng and took off toward the fifth Devouring island.</p><p>“Zonguan, what do we do now? This kid’s strength is several times higher than we thought. With our strength, we absolutely can’t suppress him.” The other Blackwater Alliance experts flew over to Sima Zonguan’s side.</p><p>Sima Zonguan said gloomily, “Let him be arrogant for a while. I’ll go invite the crown prince.”</p><p>“Invite crown prince?”</p><p>The paper-thin old man was astonished, “The crown prince doesn’t like being annoyed. Although this kid is strong, it’s not to that extent, is it?”</p><p>The crown prince they were talking about was the number one half-step King of the Black Water Alliance, and also an invincible leader of the young generation. Although they hadn’t seen the crown prince act, they had heard that he was a ‘strongest’ half-step King who almost had no rivals below the Life and Death realm.</p><p>Sima Zonguan shook his head, “He is strong. Others won’t have an absolute certainty, and only the crown prince can do that.”</p><p>He refused to believe that Ye Chen was a ‘strongest’ half-step King. ‘Strongest’ half-step Kings were too rare, even rarer than Life and Death Kings. One might be a King, but it didn’t necessarily mean that they were a ‘strongest’ half-step King at some point.</p><p>For example, although the number of half-step Kings were not like stars in the sky, they were still quite a lot. However, ‘strongest’ half-step Kings among them were only three.</p><p>“Hehe…If the crown prince acts, it’ll obviously be a surefire. No matter how strong this kid is, he can’t escape his fate of death in the crown prince’s hands.” Seeing Sima Zonguan’s firm resolution, the numerous Blackwater Alliance experts revealed cold smiles.</p><p>…</p><p>The fifth island had half the number of people on the fourth island, and the sixth island had even less—only three to four thousand people. Robbing the two island’s black powers, Ye Chen obtained thirty thousand crystals altogether, which was at least better than nothing.</p><p>“Our Zhen Yuan crystals are already above three hundred thousand. Do we leave or not?” Murong Qingcheng asked.</p><p>Ye Chen faintly nodded, “We both have peak Sea of Soul cultivation bases, and only need to pay a total of a hundred thousand crystals. We’ll still have two hundred thousand remaining, and we also have your demonic energy crystals Lets leave! We can’t get careless.”</p><p>Ye Chen was still somewhat apprehensive of the Blackwater Alliance. If a King came for them, they wouldn’t even be able to escape.</p><p>Taking out the stone altar formed naturally in the cave, Ye Chen put hundred thousand crystals in it.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>The altar shone with a dim glow and the Zhen Yuan crystals disappeared. However, there was no further movement at all. Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng were still in this world.</p><p>“We’ve been cheated?” Ye Chen’s face turned unsightly.</p><p>“The rules here won’t allow me to cheat anybody?” Right at this moment, a strange ripple appeared in the space, and the holy spirit’s figure gradually materialized.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng stared intently at the holy spirit and said, “Then why can’t we leave?”</p><p>The holy spirit said, “You’ve killed thirty four people, and their Zhen Yuan crystals haven’t been paid. Their remaining part will be fulfilled by you, a total of five hundred and twelve thousand Zhen Yuan crystals remaining.”</p><p>“Your mother…”</p><p>Even the cool-headed Ye Chen couldn’t help but swear.</p><p>He had robbed four islands and raked in more than three hundred thousand Zhen Yuan crystals. He originally thought that he would have more than enough left even after leaving. But little did he know that the debt had actually increased. Even if put all his Zhen Yuan crystals into the altar, he still lacked more than three hundred thousand. This was simply ridiculous! Going by the rules, one wouldn’t be able to leave the Devouring Islands throughout their entire lives.</p><p>“You aren’t cheating us?” Murong Qingcheng also felt it to be a bit too ridiculous.</p><p>“Have a look yourself.” Holy Spirit waved its right hand in the void, creating a live scene before the two’s eyes.</p><p>When robbing the third and fourth island, Ye Chen believed that he hadn’t mistakenly killed anybody. However, that was only what he thought. Since his soul power could only cover fifty meters in the earthen rocks, he couldn’t be sure. However, the scene before him clearly informed him that he had killed a lot, and all of them were the people in the cave who couldn’t escape in time.</p><p>“The rules don’t allow me to cheat. My words are the truth. As long as you give sufficient Zhen Yuan crystals, you can leave the Devouring Islands.” Holy Spirit’s tone didn’t have any ripples.</p><p>Sucking in a deep breath, Ye Chen said, “Alright, I believe that you are not cheating. But, can you tell me what agreement you have with the Blackwater Alliance?”</p><p>The Holy Spirit said, “A powerful Life and Death King among them had talked to me. As for the specifics, I can’t speak.”</p><p>Saying these words, the holy spirit faded away.</p><p>“This is much harder than I thought!” Ye Chen had no choice but to admit that his actions were completely in vain, as they still lacked three hundred thousand Zhen Yuan crystals.</p><p>“In for copper, in for gold. We might as well do it all the way.”</p><p>“Seems like that’s the only way.”</p><p>Ye Chen’s gaze pierced through the black ocean and fell beside the third island. There lay the second island and the first island.</p><p>…</p><p>At an opening connecting the Devouring Islands and the world outside, Sima Zonguan’s figure appeared slowly. Without any pause, he rushed toward the crystal island, raising his speed to his limits.</p><p>About two hours later, he finally arrived at the crystal island.</p><p>There were many half-step Kings stationed at the island. Sensing his aura, they felt quite strange. Today was not the day to transport the crystals. Why would Sima Zonguan leave the Devouring Island today? Could it be that something big had happened?”</p><p>‘Sima, did you leave the island without permission?” One half-step King went forward to meet him.</p><p>Sima Zonguan said, “Elder Fang, a strong person has appeared. He is looting crystals left, right, and center.”</p><p>“What strong person? Even you can’t subdue him?”</p><p>Elder Fang was very clear on Sima Zonguan’s strength. The half-step Kings capable of resisting him were exceptionally rare. Could it be the enemy was a ‘strongest’ half-step King?</p><p>“Very Strong! Apart from the ‘strongest’ half-step Kings, nobody can subdue him.” Sima Zonguan continued, “Is crown prince at the crystal island?”</p><p>“Your luck is pretty good. Crown Prince returned half a month ago and is currently in closed-door cultivation. I’ll help you notify him.” Elder Fang knew that the situation was urgent.</p><p>“Many thanks!” Sima Zonguan cupped his fists.</p><p>…</p><p>Merely two hours later, Ye Chen had plundered the second island. This island had unusually many experts, even two at the level of Flame Burst King, and many at the level of the Fierce King. However, having run into Ye Chen, they could only suffer losses.</p><p>Plundering the second island, Ye Chen headed toward the first island which had more than eighty thousand people. There were no Black Powers stationed, and received the direct supervision from the Blackwater Alliance. Like the third island, it was divided into thirty regions. With no Black Power, Ye Chen might as well rob the experts of Blackwater Alliance stationed at these regions. Without a surprise, he didn’t spare a single one.</p><p>“We obtained a hundred and thirty thousand crystals from the second island. Surprisingly, the first island had almost double…two hundred seventy thousand crystals. That’s a total of four hundred thousand.”</p><p>Adding four hundred thousand on top of the two hundred thousand was enough to compensate the previous deficit of five hundred and twenty thousand. However, Ye Chen was quite clear that it was still not enough. While robbing the first and second island, some casualties were inevitable. The caves of devouring islands were too compact.</p><p>As expected, the Holy Spirit appeared once again.</p><p>“Adding the previously killed people, you have killed a total of fifty people. You need to compensate with a total of seven hundred and fifty thousand Zhen Yuan crystals.” Holy Spirit spoke with a strictly business tone.</p><p>‘Seven hundred fifty thousand…still lacking a hundred and fifty thousand.”</p><p>This time, Ye Chen was calm. His gaze fell on the numerous palaces at the first island’s center. These were the headquarters of Blackwater Alliance’s garrison.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
