Only by using the attack created from the space profound would make a difference. Bewitching Mirror Destruction could form a mirror in the surreal space; its attacking range would be both big and small, far and close. It was a flawless attack.</p><p>Although Ye Chen had only trained it to seventy-eighty percent so it had not reached its full potential yet. But using it to fight against five other warriors within his realm should be more than enough.</p><p>Holding his thunder disaster sword with both his hands, Ye Chen suddenly entered that surreal mental state where everything seemed to be under his control. Soon, the sword in his hands started to twist out of nowhere before disappearing completely in front of everyone.</p><p>Perhaps it was just a blink of an eye, or perhaps it was a long period of time, but Ye Chen waved out a sword that was both fast and slow at the same time, leaving the entire space vibrating.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The five people gasped internally at the same time. This space profound was way too deep, and it seemed like it had some kind of mysterious connection with the time profound. Before Ye Chen waved out his attack, they could already feel time slowing down while those attacks they had just thrown out were all slowly approaching the other. By the time Ye Chen waved out his attack, they felt that the time was frozen completely. Even their own movements had started to slow down. They could no longer do what they pleased, and their battling intent had been lowered to the bottom.</p><p>Different from the other five people, the woman in yellow and Murong Qingcheng, as well as that teenager could all see that sword moving so fast that it had reached a whole another level. It was why his attacked got the others even though they had attacked him first.</p><p>Different angle meant different perception; it was the kind of change the time profound could cause.</p><p>Without a sound, the surreal space where the five were present started to twist without a pattern. The five of them all seemed like they were inside the same mirror as their expressions continued to change.</p><p>This mirror holding everyone inside seemed like it would likely shatter at any second.</p><p>“Should I just kill them?” Ye Chen had a slight hesitation.</p><p>All of a sudden, an explosion took place from over at Jin Wanshuang’s direction inside the mirror, and the surreal glass shattered everywhere. Jin Wanshuang, covered in silver light, puked out a mouthful of blood before shooting out from within, looking very pale.</p><p>Then, the elder and the twin brothers all made it out. All of them were looking pale and frightened.</p><p>Lin Yuxuan was the last, as his zhen yuan cultivation, physical strength, or battle experience could not compete with the first four. Being able to make it out was purely because the mirror was broken through by the others, which left a flaw in the mass. He was wounded badly as well, blood pouring out from all possible places and soaking through his clothes.</p><p>“Attacking five people at once is still pushing it after all.”</p><p>Ye Chen was not surprised. The attack could kill any one of them individually. But, attacking five people at once might not be possible, since they were all exceptional warriors. They were all powerful warriors at his own level, and if it were not for the powerful and complicated space profound, it would be impossible to harm all of them at once.</p><p>‘How can this be? His space profound had reached this horrifying level!’ Jin Wanshuagn was terrified as he thought to himself while staring at Ye Chen directly.</p><p>“If it were just the space profound, then I would accept it, but this sword movement that was created from the space profound is just too horrifying! Not matter judging from what area, it seems to be flawless. How could this be something created by this young a man?”</p><p>Compared to Jin Wanshuang, the elder was more shocked about his creative ability. Creating profound martial arts was just as hard as learning one. The same space profound and the same realm might give rise to differently powered space profound martial arts, which was how important creative ability was. Although power was not everything and some of the profound martial arts did not care about attacking power at all, regardless, Ye Chen’s Bewitching mirror destruction attack had shocked the elder. Even the twin brothers, who were known for their recklessness and blind bravado, were shocked as Daer Ba said, “He wounded both of us. Is he the most powerful half step king warrior?”</p><p>“Even if he was not, he would be close to it.” Daer Xiong typically thought more than Daer Ba. With this attack alone, even the most powerful half step king warrior might have to try and avoid it. But on the other side, Ye Chen was still way weaker than the other top warriors.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Lin Yuxuan could not understand why Ye Chen was decades younger and was still able to understand space profound and create this powerful sword attack. It was so powerful that all of them had lost their battling confidence with that one sword.</p><p>“What a good technique!” The women in yellow sighed.</p><p>The teenager’s shocked expression disappeared as he entered back into his healing state. But this time, it took him a very long time to calm down again.</p><p>“The space profound has three times the power of a normal profound, and would require nine times more Zhen yuan than normal. I guess I have to reach half step king warrior level sooner, only then will I have enough Zhen yuan to use. Otherwise, if I run into a powerful opponent, and I will not be able to use this attack more than one or two times.”</p><p>Slightly letting out a breath, Ye Chen flashed his body as he flew toward the ink painting and that great sword with red light. These two items were his to take.</p><p>Seeing this, the remaining five bit their lips. Although they could not fight against Ye Chen, they would definitely fight if he tried to take all of the items, since these were pseudo extreme rank items which were so rare to come across.</p><p>The five of them looked at Ye Chen directly with complicated expressions on their faces.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>The ink painting had been sucked toward Ye Chen before being thrown into the storage ring. Soon, Ye Chen grabbed onto the sword and saw two majestic words on the sword body—Evil Shattering.</p><p>“Great sword!”</p><p>Ye Chen could feel that this sword had a sword qi that was so righteous and matched his sword art perfectly. No adapting period was needed for him at all.</p><p>With the two great items in hand, Ye Chen started to look at the other items. The stick weapon was about two meters long and shone with a bright golden light. It gave people a peaceful feeling, but one knew that it contained a horrifying power, as if there would be nothing to worry about when holding the item in one’s hands. That purple golden cloth not far away was the size of a bowl, Ye Chen knew that any normal purple gold could not make this kind of a weapon.</p><p>The last item was the jade ruler which was pure white, almost one meter long and with a monster-like beast stepping on colorful clothes on the body, albeit with kind eyes.</p><p>Seeing that Ye Chen was eyeing the other great items, the rest of them started to get anxious. They did not want to fight against Ye Chen, but they did not want to give up on the items either. Therefore, they were focusing on what he was going to do.</p><p>“Do not worry. I am not as greedy as you have imagined.”</p><p>Ye Chen did not try to get the remaining three items. One reason for that was that he already had two, and secondly, the rest five of them were not that easy to fight off after all. If they were pushed into a corner, they might try to fight him off with their lives. He did not have the confidence to kill all of them at once while keeping himself alive. Lastly, even if he had the extreme power, he would still give others what they deserved, since even if he got all of the items, he would still trade them off anyways.</p><p>Holding the sword in his hand, Ye Chen flew back to Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>Whoo!</p><p>Jin Wanshuang and the remaining of them all let out a breath at the same time as their tensed up nerves relaxed a little as well. They gave Ye Chen a vaguely grateful look. If it were them, they would probably have snatched them all, since the items were extremely rare. Even if they might not need them, they could still give them to the auction house for sale or bring them to some more high level trading place for things they wanted.</p><p>“Brother Ye, I, Jin Wanshuang, would like to apologize to you. And I would like to say thank you as well.”</p><p>“I as well.” The elder forced a smile.</p><p>Ye Chen nodded slightly and did not say a thing. In this world, power meant everything. As for what these people really thought, it did not matter that much.</p><p>Without Ye Chen, this powerful opponent, the five of them started a new round of battle. Eventually, it was still Jin Wanshuang who was slightly more skilled that got the monster hunting stick and left the battle without a scratch. Then, the elder got the purple gold cloth before leaving Lin Yuxuan to fight against the twin brothers, who were way much more powerful combined. So, the jade ruler was taken by them as well, leaving him with nothing.</p><p>Huh!</p><p>Lin Yuxuan had no expression on his face, but he did not look at the rest of them. Instead, he looked at the staircase leading toward the thrity-three floor. There might be more treasures up there.</p><p>There was no existing soul mark inside the sword, so Ye Chen left his easily in the sword before pouring in some Zhen yuan, slowly learning some of the key effects of this sword.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>With that, the sword extended by a couple inches with that bright sword light, making a slight noise as well. Murong Qingcheng squinted her eyes as she could not help but take a couple of steps backward. That evil shattering sword light was making her a little bit uncomfortable.</p><p>“This sword has such powerful evil shattering power that I think it might be the best of them all. No wonder it is making you uncomfortable.” Ye Chen put his sword back into the scabbard.</p><p>The sword naturally carried this attacking element. The monster hunting stick was for oppressing beasts, and the purple gold cloth should be for capturing. The jade ruler was supposed to be for protection, so its attacking power was incomparable to the other items.</p><p>“Yeah, I wonder who left these here.” Murong Qingcheng aid.</p><p>Ye Chen looked at the staircase and said, “I hope it is not what I am thinking”</p><p>Not only did the sword not have a soul mark, all the other items did not have anything either. With these three items, Jin Wanshuang, the elder and the twin brother Daer Xiong all had their battling power increase drastically. Even if they ran into a top half step king warrior, they might be able to fight for it.</p><p>“Since everyone has gotten some items, it is time to go to the thirty-third floor now.” The lady in yellow said.</p><p>“There were four pseudo extreme rank items on the thirty-second floor, so we have to go to the thrity-three floor.” The twin brothers were not satisfied with what they had gotten. Although the jade ruler was great, it was not fitting for their style. If they could get one or two more aggressive attacking items, that would be better.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Jin Wanshuang held his stick, giving out an even more powerful aura.</p><p>Letting out a mouth full of breath, the teenager stood up. His wounds seemed to have healed by eighty percent. He would not sit out in the upcoming battles anymore.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
