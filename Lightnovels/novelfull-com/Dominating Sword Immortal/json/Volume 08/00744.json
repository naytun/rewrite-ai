Wonder who will be the second to go down.” Ye Chen paid attention to the fruit underneath the lava changing its color from violet to orange. Its entire body was giving off an orange radiance, looking extremely conscientious.</p><p>If Ye Chen were a half step King, he would have been the second one to go down for sure. However, his cultivation base was only at late Sea of Soul realm, and his Protective Zhen Yuan was not strong enough. He couldn’t reveal the Bronze Armor either. Thus, if he went down, his life would be in danger. Before he could ascertain the situation underneath the lava lake, he would not make a move.</p><p>‘Since everybody is so hesitant, I’ll do it! Hope you people won’t regret in later!” Void Sect’s Supreme Elder, Armored King, laughed heartily. His figure flickered, transforming into a yellow light beam and streaking toward the lake.</p><p>Splash!</p><p>Splashing lava everywhere, he dove in.</p><p>“It’s the Armored King!”</p><p>Everybody’s faces changed.</p><p>Armored King was quite strong, at most a bit lacking compared to the Punishment King. Moreover, his defense was extremely sturdy, and even the strongest of Half step Kings like the Thunder Spirit King couldn’t compare to him in this aspect. Although that golden Qi stream had instantly turned a Half step King into ashes, it might not be able to do anything to him.</p><p>Everybody was waiting. If Armored King successfully resisted the golden Qi stream, everybody would dive in and vie for the fruit.</p><p>The density of the lava was high. Adding the numerous undercurrents therein, the Armored King’s speed was quite slow. Moreover, the Armored King himself didn’t dare to move too fast. He wasn’t sure that he would be able to resist that golden Qi current. If he had to dodge, he should be in a position to do so.</p><p>When he reached within fifty meters of the fruit, the golden Qi current again appeared, reaching before him with but a flicker.</p><p>“How fast!”</p><p>The Armored King was startled. The earthen-yellow radiance outside his body moved, condensing into a ten meters high black summit. As soon as it made contact with the golden Qi current, an intense but dull explosion occurred. With that, the black summit shrunk at a speed visible to naked eyes like melting cheese.</p><p>Taking the opportunity, the Armored King turned his body, dodging the golden Qi current as he continued downward.</p><p>“He resisted!”</p><p>Everybody’s eyes shined, but were soon alarmed, as he could resist the golden Qi current for a few moments. The fruit couldn’t be allowed to fall into his hands.</p><p>“Go.” Qin Liu lightly shouted, her tone sounding decisive.</p><p>Shua! Shua!</p><p>Ye Chen and her moved almost at the same time, arriving at the sky above the lake in an instant and diving down.</p><p>Shua! Shua! Shua!</p><p>It was not just Ye Chen and Qin Liu, all the others had moved as well. Including the Punishment King, Forest King, Moqi Tiger, and Ice Spear King more than ten half step Kings raised their speed to peak.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the dozen individuals entered the lake almost at the same time, rushing downward.</p><p>The more one approached the fruit, the greater was the number of the golden Qi currents. At this moment, the speed of Armored King was not even ten-thousandth of his normal speed. He absolutely didn’t dare confront multiple golden Qi currents simultaneously. He could only resist one golden Qi current for a moment, then dodge it and slowly continue downward.</p><p>Soon, he was only twenty meters away from the fruit. But right at that moment, the Punishment King, who was the strongest amongst everybody, struck decisively. It was precisely the “Punishment Strike” which almost got Ye Chen’s entire group previously. Numerous chains extended, coiling toward Armored King from every direction.</p><p>Armored King’s strength was only a bit inferior to Punishment King; a black summit once again condensed outside his body. Metal clanking sounds resounded as the chains collided with the summit. However, in the next moment, a blade light made the Armored King fly askew and collide with a golden Qi current.</p><p>Creak!</p><p>The black summit rapidly shrunk as the Armored King hurriedly escaped from the range of the Golden Qi current.</p><p>“Punishment King, you dare act against me?” Armored King roared indignantly.</p><p>“Why would I not dare?” The Punishment King snorted.</p><p>With the Punishment King as lead, others also gained courage and immediately unleashed a wave of attacks on the Armored King as he neared the fruit, causing him to be extremely furious but helpless.</p><p>Soon, everybody was near the fruit.</p><p>Everybody was dodging the golden Qi current while guarding against the others at the same time. Although the golden Qi current’s temperature was quite high, as long as they didn’t get too near the fruit, its frequency of appearance was not too high. Moreover, all of those who entered the lake were powerful existences amongst Half step Kings. Even if they were scorched by the current, they could evade at the crucial moment.</p><p>“Hehe, there is only one fruit, but we have a dozen people here. I’m afraid everyone’s share won’t be good.” The Punishment King swept his gaze and darkly chucked.</p><p>Ice Spear King spoke firmly, “There are indeed too many. Let’s reduce a bit.”</p><p>“Be careful now, as there might be a close fight.” Qin Lie sent a Zhen Yuan transmission to Ye Chen.</p><p>“Rest assured, I know what to do!”</p><p>Ye Chen could feel that the entire lava lake was bound by a restrictive layer. It was causing the energies to not concentrate, and thus, greatly lowering everyone’s offensive power. Adding on the high density of lava on top, everybody’s offensive power had halved here, and was not enough to pierce defenses. Hereby, it could be concluded that the primary threat was to collide with the golden Qi currents.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The first one to be out of luck was a slightly frail Half step King. He first suffered Forest King’s attack, which almost made him run into a golden Qi current. At the crucial moment, he forcefully evaded, but was then again struck by Moqi Tiger.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>With a frightened expression, this person was drowned in the current, turning into ashes.</p><p>“Leave!”</p><p>Soon, two Half step Kings, who believed that their strength was not enough rushed upwards. They wouldn’t give up their lives here. They didn’t fear death, but there were too many experts, making it impossible for them to vie for the fruit.</p><p>With one dead and two left, only ten people were left behind inside the lake.</p><p>“Kid, this is not the place you can stay.” Ice Spear King struck his spear at Ye Chen out of the blue.</p><p>“This guy!</p><p>Out of everybody, Ye Chen’s defense was the weakest. If he attacked others, he wouldn’t be able to pierce their defenses, but that might not be the case for Ye Chen. Moreover, even if he failed, he could easily make Ye Chen lose his balance and be pushed toward a golden Qi current.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Ye Chen waved the Thunder Disaster Sword, facing him with a dark golden ripple.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Even with the restrictive layer, an explosion occurred and lava surged.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Ice Spear King only used fifty-sixty percent of his strength. He naturally believed that it would be enough to send Ye Chen flying back. However, he had miscalculated, as the one sent flying back was him. Caught completely off guard, he couldn’t react at all.</p><p>Even moreare unfortunately, there were two golden Qi currents before his body.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>Ice Spear King’s body shone. First his seven apertures let out an intense light, then his flesh started to crumble, fusing with the lava. The long spear in his hand and defensive armor slowly sank to the depths of the lake.</p><p>“Huh…”</p><p>Ye Chen had a dumbfounded expression. He had merely counterattacked, with absolutely no intention of killing Ice Spear King. He believed that the latter should be able to resist his strike. What he didn’t expect was that the Ice Spear King had only used fifty-sixty percent of his strength, and was caught completely unprepared, resulting in his death.</p><p>“Sigh! I have now offended the Ice Pavilion as well.” Ye Chen smiled bitterly.</p><p>“Kid, you’re courting death!”</p><p>Everybody was astonished at Ye Chen’s strength. Even if Ice Spear King had been careless, he was not some ordinary Half step King. It was actually he who was killed in one strike. As soon as Ice Spear King died, Forest King and Moqi Tiger’s eyes shone with ominous glints and immediately unleashed their attacks at Ye Chen.</p><p>“You dare!”</p><p>Qin Liu faced the two while holding the Sky Hammer.</p><p>At that moment, an astonishing scene occurred. Forest King and Moqi Tiger absolutely didn’t expect Qin Liu to have a pseudo extreme grade artifact, and immediately followed after Ice Spear King’s footsteps; they were knocked back and collided with golden Qi currents before turning into ashes.</p><p>“What a fellow…to have a pseudo extreme grade artifact!” Punishment King’s mouth twitched.</p><p>Among the former ten, three had died, leaving behind only seven.</p><p>“F*ck, we can’t stay here. Escape, quick!”</p><p>The consequent deaths made others’ hearts chilled. They immediately charged upwards, not willing to battle here. The slightest carelessness would lead them tumbling into the golden Qi current and turning them into ashes. Amongst everybody, Armored King was the only one who could resist the golden Qi current for a few moments.</p><p>In the end, only four people were left behind inside the lake—Qin Liu, Ye Chen, the Armored King, and the Punishment King. The others all had died or escaped.</p><p>“Mysterious King, I didn’t expect you to have a pseudo extreme grade artifact. But, now that you’ve killed Forest King and Forest Tiger, Lin family and Sky Tiger Clan won’t let you off.”</p><p>The Punishment King didn’t fear Qin Liu at all. He was a peak Half step King. Even though Qin Liu had a pseudo extreme grade artifiact, it wouldn’t be enough to suppress him. At most, they would be tied.</p><p>Qin Liu said, “Life and death is decided by fate, and riches by heavens. If they didn’t wish to die, they should have stayed holed inside their homes.”</p><p>Although offending Lin family and Sky Tiger Clan was troublesome, it didn’t matter at this moment. She could only blame it on the others for not being careful.</p><p>The Punishment King said, “You’re Mysterious Queen’s Master. Lin family and Sky Tiger Clan might not look for trouble with you. But, this kid is heading to a certain disaster. Ice Pavilion will back their people regardless of being in the right or wrong.”</p><p>He didn’t know that Ye Chen had not only offended Ice Pavilion, but even Void Emperor, Shadow Sect, and Gu Clan. Therefore, as far as Ye Chen was concerned, one Ice Pavilion didn’t make much of a difference.</p><p>“Humph, it was their fate to die here. If other Kings behind them make a move later, my disciple Qing Xuan and Dragon King won’t watch with their hands crossed.”</p><p>As Mysterious Queen’s Master, how could Qin Liu not know the intentions of the former? She and Dragon King would both protect Ye Chen. Whoever acted against Ye Chen would be acting against them.</p><p>“Dragon King? Who knows if he is even alive!” On the other side, the Armored King sneered.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
