Liu Wujian's Three Sky Sword Qi was powerful in itself, capable of killing the majority of peak Masters. Even Dugu Jue would be gravely injured by it. However, Ye Chen's Three Identical Sword seemed even higher in terms of killing power. With a mere brush, it inflicted an unprecedentedly heavy injury on Liu Wujian.</p><p>Gu Lie and the multicolor-robed woman were dumbstruck. From the very beginning they had never considered the possibility of Liu Wujian losing. It was tough for them to accept such a conclusion.</p><p>\"Hiss! Impossible! I've also attained the realm of Three Identical Swords…Why such a huge difference?\" Situ Hao's eyes were left wide open.</p><p>He believed that if not considering sword intent, Ye Chen's Three Identical Sword might not be more powerful than his, and perhaps he might be the more skillful one. However, what just happened? Ye Chen's Three Identical Swords exploded in his mind like a thunderclap. Even if the latter's sword intent was much more powerful than his, it still didn't explain such a difference in might.</p><p>Soul, soul power?</p><p>Right, it was soul power!</p><p>Situ Hao suddenly understood everything. Ye Chen must be a genius of soul. If Chu Zhongtian had the current strongest body, Ye Chen might have the strongest soul. Otherwise, there was simply no explanation for such a frightening might. After all, the Sword Control Art was controlled through soul power.</p><p>Situ Hao smiled bitterly, suddenly feeling a bit of regret. It was no wonder he traded for the Sword Control Art with such insistence. It turned out that he was a soul genius. The Sword Control Art was a technique specially made for people like him, simply a priceless technique.</p><p>However, his thoughts changed, and he began to calm down.</p><p>Even if he had not traded the Sword Control Art, he would still have trouble catching after him. It would be better to focus on his growth. At the very least, he had obtained six Dragon Blood Grasses, which were worth three hundred thousand jin of strength, allowing him to possess a strength comparable to body refiners. In addition, the Spiritual Sword Attack allowed him to comprehend the fast profound. Upon maturity, it would produce an effect that couldn't be looked down upon.</p><p>\"Liu Wujian lost! It turns out that Ye Chen's ace was also the Sword Control Art like Situ Hao. An expert is an expert alright. Although the Sword Control Art is quite powerful in the hands of Situ Hao, it is incomparable to Ye Chen. Worthy of being Sword Master…Anything in his hands just shines through.\"</p><p>\"Of course! Looking back at Ye Chen's path to prominence, it's simply astonishing, filled with battle after battle. But, he never lost once, and directly claimed the crown.\"</p><p>\"I'm afraid that such a frightening progress rate might be rare even in the ancient era.\"</p><p>Sighs and exclamations could be heard one after another, treating Ye Chen as a figure of legend.</p><p>Chichichi…</p><p>Liu Wujian's neck was still bleeding, making many consider the possibility that he would bleed to death.</p><p>Of course, if it had been an ordinary martial artist, he would have died long ago. Upon cultivating to Sea of Soul realm, the amount of blood increased by several folds compared to ordinary martial artists. Without any exaggeration, the blood of a Sea of Soul realm expert could fill several jars, not to mention a high level expert such as Liu Wujian.</p><p>\"B*stard!\"</p><p>With deathly pale face, Liu Wujian swept his left hand through his neck, closing it immediately. However, the next moment, it opened once again. The culprit was the remaining Destruction Sword Intent, which didn't let go of its target easily.</p><p>\"Break!\"</p><p>Biting his tongue, Liu Wujian roared with a sinister face.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>The Highsky sword intent gushed out, colliding with the Destruction Sword Intent at the wound. The Destruction Sword Intent was powerful, but it was a duckweed without root and couldn't persist for long. It was soon eliminated, allowing the wound on Liu Wujian's neck to gradually mend.</p><p>Nobody was surprised that Liu Wujian didn't die. Sea of Soul realm experts had extremely strong vitality. Although severing a main artery seemed frightening and could easily make one bleed to death, as long as the bleeding was stopped, a Sea of Soul realm expert would not die.</p><p>Ye Chen didn't continue his offense. If he really wished to kill Liu Wujian, he would not have waited until this moment.</p><p>\"Ye Chen, Ye Chen!\"</p><p>Although his wound had healed, Liu Wujian's face was frighteningly cold. Before running into Ye Chen, it had always been easy victories for him. However, this time, he even used the Three Sky Sword Qi and still suffered a miserable defeat.</p><p>Ye Chen had crushed his unbeaten battle record, making him terrified yet furious and unresigned.</p><p>\"You want to continue?\"</p><p>Ye Chen's face was indifferent. In Whitecloud restaurant, it had been the multicolor-robed woman who had provoked him for the most part. Therefore, he could overlook it. After all, Murong Qingcheng had settled it magnificently. However, not being angry didn't mean he was indifferent. His counterattack was not something an ordinary person could handle. He was not one to be easily provoked, but once he moved, he made sure to leave behind an unforgettable memory.</p><p>\"Humph!\"</p><p>He would naturally not continue. First, not to mention whether he was Ye Chen's opponent or not, his current battle strength had been reduced to thirty percent. His condition was at an all-time low.</p><p>\"Cyan mountains don't change, and green water flows forever. You can be proud at this moment, but that might not be so later. My path is still long. When the time comes, I'll be sure to pay you back.\"</p><p>Liu Wujian was already at the peak of late Sea of Soul realm. He never doubted for a moment that he would fail to enter half-step Life and Death realm. Once he did so, his strength would increase exponentially. Ordinary Life and Death Kings wouldn't be able to take a single move from him, not to mention Ye Chen, since the latter was only at the peak of mid Sea of Soul realm, far off from half-step Life and Death realm.</p><p>\"Then talk after becoming a half-step King. Running your mouth off won't help you advance.\"</p><p>Ye Chen expression didn't change. By the time the former became a half-step King, he would certainly have a cultivation base of peak late Sea of Soul realm. He would have experienced the state of being one with the world, which would allow him to rapidly improve his understanding of the profound. He might even cultivate Golden Hurricane to major completion. Moreover, although the late Sea of Soul realm wouldn't increase his soul power, which would have allowed to him directly increase the power of Sword Control Art, his current Sword Control Art was merely the beginning. There were still Five, Seven, Nine, Forty Nine, Eighty One, and the supreme Hundred Identical Swords. At that moment, what realm would his strength reach? Even he himself couldn't estimate it.</p><p>\"We're leaving!\"</p><p>Liu Wujian knew that words had little use at this point. Loss meant loss…Only by defeating his opponent would he be able to regain his honor.</p><p>\"Leave!\"</p><p>Gu Lie let out a deep breath, giving a fearful glance at Ye Chen as he left alongside the multicolor-robed woman, chasing after Liu Wujian.</p><p>The multicolor-robed woman was a bit fearful before leaving, afraid that Ye Chen might look for trouble with her. This person was indeed too terrifying.</p><p>Once the three left, Ye Chen slightly calmed his blood Qi while looking back on the battle in his mind.</p><p>Liu Wujian's strength was undoubtedly astonishing. Without the Sword Control Art, Ye Chen could only rely on the Immortal Body to suppress the former and slowly whittle him down. The more his cultivation base advanced, the more reliable the Immortal Body seemed to him. One shouldn't look down on it because it couldn't increase battle power directly. It was much more potent than increasing battle power directly. Even if he had to face an opponent with a strength much higher than his, he didn't necessarily have to be afraid.</p><p>In a true life and death battle, it wouldn't be sure who would come out victorious.</p><p>Unfortunately, he still couldn't comprehend the Immortal Body's second layer—Regrowing Limbs. Once he cultivated the second layer, he would be able to grow any severed parts quickly except the head, and his survival power would increase by ten folds. Even if he ran into an impossible enemy, he could be fairly confident to escape with his life.</p><p>However, he was not hurried. He had a premonition that once he reached late Sea of Soul realm, he would gain the qualifications to comprehend the second layer.</p><p>…</p><p>In the void devoid of vitality, a colossal object was streaking across from the far end. Inspecting it from close, it seemed like a small plane. Its surroundings were translucent, and one could faintly see the mountains, rivers, as well as huge buildings inside.</p><p>The small plane was moving at an extremely fast speed, leaving behind a stream of gray Qi. This stream of gray Qi was even squeezing the spatial energy out. If a half-step Life and Death King were careless enough to be brushed by the gray Qi stream, they would disintegrate to their bones.</p><p>Judging by the direction and speed of the small planet, it would be visible in the sky of Sky Martial Region in about a month.</p><p>As the small planet approached, the finger mark left by the Four Extreme Emperors on Emperor Scar Stele intensely flickered, as if it had sensed an incorporeal aura.</p><p>The two seemed to have a mysterious connection.</p><p>…</p><p>On the border of North Ocean and True Spirit Continent, a figure was flying across. Wherever the figure went, it left behind twinkling runes made of Zhen Yuan, looking extremely mysterious.</p><p>Whizz!</p><p>The figure abruptly stopped, standing in the void.</p><p>The figure seemed to belong to a young man. His face seemed to be carved out of jade; he had a pair of sword-shaped eyebrows and star like eyes. Between his eyebrows was a glazy rune, which was not just for show. It allowed the young man to have an unfathomable connection with the world, like the state of being one with the world.</p><p>\"I've reached the True Spirit Continent…It's a first for me.\"</p><p>The small islands and ocean water held no mysteries under his gaze. It seemed as if he was able to see through everything.</p><p>\"Eh? Someone is tired of living!\"</p><p>His gaze slightly paused before he coldly laughed.</p><p>\"Kill!\"</p><p>Hundreds of martial artists flew in from every direction. The lowest among them had the Astral Reaching realm while the highest had late Sea of Soul realm cultivation bases. This was a bandit force. Precisely speaking, it was the biggest bandit gang active at the border of True Spirit Continent and North Ocean. They specialized in killing experts and plundering their riches who crossed by. Upon running into them, even a peak Master would have to escape at first sight.</p><p>\"Haha, here comes another sheep!\"</p><p>The ocean bandits were headed by a big, ugly, bearded man. This month, they had already killed seven-eight Sea of Soul realm experts, the strongest of whom was a Sea of Soul realm Master with some fame in the continent. However, upon encountering the Black Death Bandits, his only option was death.</p><p>\"Die for me!\"</p><p>Without any words, hundreds of bandits immediately attacked to kill their prey.</p><p>\"Courting death!\"</p><p>A cold light flickered in young man's eyes. With a wave of his hand, a glazy palm energy condensed into a distorted rune and rammed into the bandit group coming from his left.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The palm energy transformed rune was too powerful, as at least three-four hundred people turned into blood and flesh before being ignited and dispersing as smoke.</p><p>\"So powerful!\"</p><p>The Black Death bandit leader's pupils shrank. Under his distracted gaze, the young man killed two hundred more. As for attacks of the bandits, they couldn't even graze the young man. He dodged everything with a seemingly mysterious body art.</p><p>\"Pushing hands into thorn…Withdraw, quick!\"</p><p>As he spoke these words, the bandit leader had already turned around and fled.</p><p>\"Trying to escape?\"</p><p>With a few flickers, the young man arrived behind the bandit leader. With a stretch of his arm, he easily smashed through the bandit leader's Protective Zhen Yuan and grabbed his head.</p><p>\"Mercy!\" The bandit leader's face turned pale.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The young man's fingers tightened, and the bandit leader's body turned into flames, beginning from his head and soon turning his whole body into ashes.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
