She frantically retreated several steps and exclaimed with a pale face, “Impossible!”</p><p>She had never seen such a high grade sword intent. It was even faintly higher than Liu Wujian’s, which was hard to accept for the woman.</p><p>“Liu Wujian, now you know why I didn’t fight you! You…don’t have the qualifications to look down on Ye Chen.” A peculiar glint flickered in Dugu Jue’s eyes.</p><p>The longsword on Liu Wujian’s waist shuddered incessantly, as if about to leave its sheath at any moment. His eyes narrowed into slits and a cold gleam appeared in them, sharp like a blade. From Ye Chen’s body, he felt gravely threatened. It wasn’t a danger that he calculated or defined himself; instead, it was one his body felt itself. To make his body instinctively feel threatened, Ye Chen’s strength could be well imagined.</p><p>“Very well! I, Liu Wujian, have underestimated somebody for the first time in my life. But, it doesn’t matter as you’ll still lose.”</p><p>Pressing his left hand on the sword hilt’s end, Lu Wujian straightened his back. A dense sky-piercing sword intent sword reached out, colliding with Ye Chen’s. Countless muffled explosions rang out in the void, and a chaotic will storm suddenly erupted out in every direction.</p><p>Ah!</p><p>Miserable shrieks rang out one after another. Nearby spectators frantically retreated while enduring a splitting headache, desperately trying to avoid the will storm.</p><p>“Will storm! Retreat quick! It’s a confrontation of King grade wills.” Someone shouted amidst the crowd.</p><p>Ye Chen’s Destruction Sword Intent had reached the fifth step, and its might was equivalent to that of an ordinary sixth step sword intent. Liu Wujian’s sword intent was also of the fifth step, and his sword intent was also the rare Highsky Sword Intent. Although it couldn’t compare with the Destruction Sword Intent, it was much stronger than ordinary sword intents. The confrontation between these two sword intents was like a confrontation between sword intents of Life and Death Kings. The destructive power created could be well imagined.</p><p>Of course, the two had powerful sword intents, but they themselves were not Life and Death Kings, and thus, were lacking in utilization of sword intent compared to true Life and Death Kings. However, a confrontation of King grade sword intents was bound to be extraordinary. If they didn’t retreat, their souls were likely to be strangled by the will storm, resulting in miserable deaths.</p><p>Sword intents were colorless by themselves, but when they acted in the world, they gained color. Ye Chen’s Destruction Sword Intent brimmed with a darkness of devouring without a trace of light, while Liu Wujian’s Highsky Sword intent was white, with a trace of azure. It was neither strong nor weak, but gentle and swift. The confrontation between the two sword intents caused the sky above Nine Dragon Mountain to split into black and white. The black was faintly stronger, suppressing the white. The white was on the defensive, waiting for an opportunity to strike back.</p><p>“Wave Slash!”</p><p>Under the suppression of sword intent, Liu Wujian’s Zhen Yuan erupted and poured into his longsword, which gave out a sword cry and slashed out toward Ye Chen like a huge wave.</p><p>Huchi!</p><p>The black and white color were torn apart, and the tear extended toward Ye Chen on the summit.</p><p>Pulling out the Thunder Disaster Sword, Ye Chen slashed the sky. The black-colored sword Qi, as if tearing through the void, devoured half of the wave-shaped sword Qi, then destroyed the other half.</p><p>“Powerful, but it’s not enough!”</p><p>Liu Wujian laughed heartily. His body covered in long robes turned into a stream of light, instantly arriving before Ye Chen and issuing hundreds of strikes. Every sword strike was unimaginably fast, as if one person had turned into hundreds, and they all attacked at the same time. Every strike was aimed accurately at Ye Chen’s vitals.</p><p>“Too fast! It’s twice as fast as Lu Shaoyou’s battle…Can the human body really produce such a fast swordplay?</p><p>“West Ocean Sword Master…His title is not in vain. This is a confrontation of Sword Masters!”</p><p>“Look, Ye Chen’s sword arts are also extremely fast. His hand and sword have already disappeared, only leaving behind a sword Qi.”</p><p>Amidst numerous discussions, Ye Chen welcomed Liu Wujian’s assault. The Thunder Disaster Sword danced at its peak, fending off one strike after another from Liu Wujian. Not only that, Ye Chen gradually began to counterattack while defending, stabilizing the fight between two equals.</p><p>Clang Clang Clang….</p><p>If one were to say that the battle between Dugu Jue and Gu Lie was the limit of speed and power, then this battle was one surpassing the limits. Moreover, it was still going higher, giving an impression as if the two had no limits.</p><p>Due to excessive speed, the figures of the two didn’t disappear. Instead, it was the complete opposite. The entire sky was filled the two’s figures. From ten to twenty, forty, eighty—a hundred Ye Chen and Liu Wujian could be seen, all battling in different postures. Some were crossing swords, some chasing after one another, some displaying exquisite swordplay, and some fighting at a distance. Energy exploded in every direction.</p><p>Far off in the surroundings of Nine Dragon Lake, everybody was looking on with stupefied faces. If not for watching with their own eyes, they would never have believed that someone could take swordplay to such a level. And not just one person, but two!</p><p>Liu Wujian’s strength was beyond their imagination.</p><p>Ye Chen’s strength was also beyond their imagination.</p><p>West Ocean Sword Artist against Continent Sword Master…This was a showdown between Sword Masters—a battle of the century.</p><p>“Ocean Shifter Sword Qi.”</p><p>Liu Wujian’s figure disappeared from a small area, then a clear figure emerged which slashed out a deep-white colored world-engulfing sword Qi. Dozens of Ye Chen’s figures instantly cleared out, like a rag wiping off a dust-stained glass, instantly cleaning a huge chunk off it.</p><p>“Infinite Golden Pattern!”</p><p>Dark golden rings gushed out one after another; wherever Ye Chen’s figure moved, Liu Wujian’s figure would shatter. With Ye Chen as the center, a surrounding of thousand meters turned into a world of ripples, and Ye Chen was its master.</p><p>Once his final phantom shattered, Liu Wujain’s original body charged at Ye Chen. With his long robes fluttering in the body, he growled, “Back off!”</p><p>It was the Ocean Shifter Sword Qi once again. However, the entire sky above Nine Dragon Mountain had turned into an ocean, swirling open and engulfing the ripple world around Ye Chen.</p><p>“This time, it’s too powerful! It almost seems hopeless…I wonder how Ye Chen will deal with it.”</p><p>Everybody could see that Liu Wujian had gone all out. The might of this move was nothing like what he had used against Lu Shaoyou before. One slash, and an ocean swirled open. The might of this move was simply absurd. A man alone against a vast ocean—one couldn’t help but faintly feel oneself as insignificant.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>A black colored light beam shot out of the ocean, and the entire ocean turned into shades of black of white. Countless cracks appeared at its edges, making it seem like a huge shiny object. However, the light coming from inside was black, exuding a wanton destructive aura.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>With a sky-shaking explosion, Ye Chen charged out.</p><p>“Eh? Can actually take my full strength Ocean Shifter Sword Qi!” Liu Wujian was slightly astonished. Be it his fight against Sky Sword Ancestor or Lu Shaoyou, he never turned serious. If one move didn’t work, he used another move. However, while battling against Ye Chen, he simply couldn’t do so. He had made his move at a crucial point, so that no longer had to use another move.</p><p>However, he still ended up underestimating Ye Chen’s strength. When Ye Chen fought against Sky Sword Ancestor, his Destruction Sword Intent had not reached the fifth step. Now that it had reached the fifth step, Ye Chen could defeat the latter in a few moves without using the Defensive Sword Control Art at all. Although this move, Ocean Shifter Sword Qi, seemed mighty, it didn’t have much effect on Ye Chen. With such a vast attack radius, there were bound to be many weak points in this move. Moreover, even if there were none, Ye Chen could always create for himself. For Lu Shaoyou, this move was powerful beyond imagination, but for Ye Chen, it was nothing special.</p><p>“Thunder Devour!”</p><p>Escaping out, Ye Chen slashed toward Liu Wujian without any hesitation. A dark thunder sphere ripped through the sky, streaking across with an aura of destruction.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Liu Wujian, recognized the terror of this move and used Ocean Shifter Sword Qi once again.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>Thunder Sphere exploded, destroying the Ocean Shifter Sword Qi. Liu Wujian retreated dozens of steps, his clothes hoisting upwards. Ye Chen closely followed him in pursuit, unleashing thunder spheres one after another like a pack of mobile cannons.</p><p>Liu Wujian kept retreating, being gradually suppressed.</p><p>“Masters List’s number one for this year is still him.”</p><p>Bai Wuxue was carefully analyzing the confrontation between the two. When he compared it with Lu Shaoyou’s battle, he arrived at a shocking conclusion: Ye Chen’s strength was at least twice that of the latter. Liu Wujian was also worthy of being West Ocean’s Sword Master. He was probably being suppressed for the very first time.</p><p>Sword Master Ye Chen could no longer be described as strong. In precise terms, he had turned into a reign, ruling over the current phase.</p><p>The other spectators also felt their blood boiling. The strength revealed by Ye Chen was far beyond their imagination. Not only was he able to exchange moves with Li Wujian, he had even gained the upper hand,</p><p>“Hmph! Elder brother Liu still hasn’t revealed his ace. If he does, each and every one of you will have your eyes popping out.” The multicolor-robed woman’s face brimmed with discontentment.</p><p>“Sword Master Ye Chen is indeed strong, excessively strong! Unfortunately, you’re against Liu Wujian…Only a few are aware of his real terror.” Gu Lie had merely suffered light injuries. He was standing beside multicolor-robed woman, watching the battle. Hearing her words, he inwardly said.</p><p>“Thousand Li Thread!”</p><p>Eventually, Liu Wujian used his killer move—a killer move at full power. Dense white colored sword Qi condensed into a thread and flickered into the void, instantly severing the few thunder spheres. The thunder spheres still had energy remaining inside them, but their might had been reduced by a lot. Thus, they were easily taken care of by one slash from Liu Wujian.</p><p>Stabilizing the situation, Liu Wujian held his breath and slashed out diagonally with full focus. Sword Qi condensed into a thread, which ripped across toward Ye Chen. If this sword move hit its target, even Chu Zhongtian would be gravely injured, enough to bring him to death’s door. Its offensive power and sustainability were terrifying.</p><p>On the other side, Ye Chen calmly held the sword with both hands and swiftly but chopped heavily. With a crackle, dark colored lightning gathered at the sword’s tip. As it erupted outwards, it formed a lightning sphere. The perfect sphere changed to oval and then to oblate, like a shuttle or a dark light pellet.</p><p>The concentrated thunder sphere moved, its speed so fast that it blurred as it collided with the thread. With a ‘kacha’ sound, the deep white sword Qi was slashed into two, brushing past Ye Chen’s body and piercing through the mountains behind, then penetrating deep underground.</p><p>The black light pellet turned into a light beam, streaking toward Lu Wujian. Its might had been reduced a lot, but Liu Wujian still had to retreat for several steps, his blood and Qi rampaging.</p><p>“Good, very good! This is the first time I’ve ran into someone who can fight me on equal footing. Unfortunately, my strength is beyond your imagination. To meet me is your misfortune, and also the start of your failures.”</p><p>Liu Wujain’s face seemed calm and unhurried, but his eyes were sharp. Facing his glance was like having countless swords piercing through one’s eyes.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
