Do you think the Tough king is someone you can see when you want to see?” The followers of the Tough king gathered around them. The leading man was still that cold looking middle aged man with long hair.</p><p>“I asked you to call for the Tough king, it was meant to be good for you.”</p><p>After the past couple of days, Ye Chen had figured out the situation around the black mountain quite well. This Tough king was not the most powerful warrior in No.3 devouring island, but indeed was the toughest. Otherwise, he would not have collected that many Zhen yuan crystals.</p><p>“Brat, you are looking for death!”</p><p>Seeing the Ye Chen was this arrogant, the followers of the Tough king who had been cruel for this long could not have let it go for sure. Four powerful late Sea of souls realm warriors jumped out, attacking toward Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>Ye Chen did not even have to take out his sword, and he pointed out his sword finger directly.</p><p>Pooh! Pooh! Pooh! Pooh!</p><p>Even if it were just a sword finger, it was not something those four warriors could handle. They were all blown into the air like a broken bag.</p><p>“Powerful!”</p><p>“Kill these greedy b*stards!”</p><p>Within this short period of time, some of the people had gathered around already. Seeing that Ye Chen was only at peak level Late Sea of Souls realm warriors but was able to beat four powerful warriors of the Tough king, they were very impressed.</p><p>“No wonder he is this arrogant! it is because he actually has a couple of tricks up his sleeves.” The evil middle aged man squinted his eyes and a cold light poured out. He waved his hand, asking all of the warriors to attack him at the same time.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Being able to become the Tough king’s warriors, one had to be at least a mid Sea of souls realm warrior. So, dozens of warriors with a cultivation above that level jumped at Ye Chen, their killing intent more than obvious.</p><p>Unfortunately, Ye Chen’s power was way higher than these warriors, and he was the kind of warrior who could fight cross realm battles. So, the result of this battle was already decided from the beginning.</p><p>Seeing all of his men get blown into the air, the evil middle aged man could no longer be chilled. He flashed his body and attacked toward Ye Chen’s head. That sharp claw power was meant to scratch through the latter’s skull. That kind of determination and sharpness was not something everyone could have easily.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>The evil middle aged man attacked very fast, but Ye Chen was even faster. His arm moved once and a sword finger was already pressed against the man’s neck, while a green light was vaguely seen. If the man decided to move an inch further, then his throat would be punctured through.</p><p>“The reason that you are not dead is because the rules forbid me from doing so. Also, I need you to bring a message for me.” Ye Chen sneered.</p><p>Cold sweat dripped down the middle aged man’s forehead. Ye Chen was attacking too fast, and he did not even get a chance to see how he did it. It was until that cold sensation wrapped around his head when he noticed that his opponent had already finished throwing out his attack. If it were not for him stopping his body on time, he would have died already.</p><p>Of course, even if the evil man wanted to die, Ye Chen would not let him be killed by himself, since he was not that stupid. Taking back his sword finger, Ye Chen said, “Let the Tough king talk to me!”</p><p>“You will regret it.” Hurrying to take couple of steps back, the middle aged man gasped and said slowly.</p><p>“Well, that will depend on if he has the power to make me regret it.” Ye Chen sounded as calm as always.</p><p>“Let’s go!” The middle aged man left with his wounded followers.</p><p>The Tough king lived in a massive cave, with no other caves within three hundred meters around him. Inside the lobby, the Tough king looked at the middle-aged man with a scary expression.</p><p>“You are saying that not only is he not prepared to hand in any Zhen yuan crystals, he even asked to see me?”</p><p>“Yes. Besides that, he also wounded our people.” The evil looking middle-aged man lowered his head.</p><p>An evil light flashed in the Tough king’s eyes, “I see that my title is still not aggressive and threatening enough after all, such that even the Black Mountain zone people have started to fight against me. How can I let that keep happening?”</p><p>“Bring me over, I will show him how to spell ‘regret’.”</p><p>…</p><p>The black mountain zone was not that big. Within half a pot of tea worth of time, the Tough king had flown all the way over with a group of people. That aggressive aura of his had frightened a lot of people along the way.</p><p>“The Tough king is here. I wonder what he is going to do.”</p><p>“This is not wise at all. Our No.3 devouring island has only got about twenty half step king warriors, and the Tough king is not even ranked in the top three. But, at least he could be ranked in the top five. Some of the dark power party leaders are only at peak level Late Sea of Souls Realm.”</p><p>“Perhaps it is some martial genius who has gotten used to being on top.”</p><p>Everyone was chatting in a low voice.</p><p>“Who are you? Tell us your name!”</p><p>Floating in the midair, the Tough King looked down at Ye Chen and said with a low voice.</p><p>“Ye Chen…And I guess you are the Tough King?” Ye Chen looked up and said calmly.</p><p>“Since you already know, then why aren’t you kneeling down and begging for your life yet?”</p><p>Ye Chen sneered. “You are not worthy yet.”</p><p>“You are looking for death!” The followers of Tough King had gotten furious.</p><p>“Good! You are brave…But, the braver you are, the worse I will make you feel. Kui Feng, teach him a lesson.” An evil look flashed through Tough King’s face as he said to the middle aged man on his left.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The middle-aged man flashed his body, which turned into two before turning into eight. Suddenly, eight shadows appeared and surrounded Ye Chen.</p><p>“The profound sense of wind…No, even with a hint of profound sense of shadow.” Ye Chen was slightly surprised. The middle-aged man might be at his cultivation, which was only peak level Late Sea of Souls Realm, but he was cherished by the Tough King, so he must have something that was different from the others. Right now, judging from his flying art, he was indeed powerful. Normally, the flying art would be hard to be infused with different profound sense, but this man had done it.</p><p>“I have once wounded a half step king warrior. I hope you can last a bit longer than that.” Kui Feng smiled, with cruelty written all over it.</p><p>“Being able to would a half step king warrior is indeed not bad with your cultivation.” Ye Chen would obviously not be threatened by his words. Even if his opponent was able to kill a half step king warrior, it would not mean much to him as well.</p><p>“Huh? Are you just arrogant or do you have someone to back you up?”</p><p>Kui Feng was a bit hesitant because of Ye Chen’s expression. He was able to wound badly a half step king warrior with his peak level Late Seas of Souls Realm power, which was very impressive. But somehow, Ye Chen in front of did not seem surprised at all.</p><p>“Kui Feng, what are you waiting for?” Tough King was losing his patience.</p><p>“Yes, sir!!” He took a deep breath, and the look on his face started to get more and more serious. “Tornado Kill.”</p><p>Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!</p><p>Eight shadows were activated almost at the same time. They started spinning around Ye Chen rapidly like a pile of tornado, wanting to kill him directly within.</p><p>Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!</p><p>The tornado was getting narrower and narrower as Kui Feng attacked. The second he did, the whole place started to get so bright that bare eyes could not stare at it directly. The whole tornado was spinning like blades.</p><p>Within the tornado, Ye Chen looked calm as he lifted up his right sword finger and pointed it out.</p><p>Chin!</p><p>Amongst the bright sparks, a beam of cold light shot out from within the tornado. It seemed to have stopped the spinning tornado completely.</p><p>“What! Kui Feng had lost!”</p><p>The second that the tornado stopped, everyone was shocked.</p><p>In the middle of the field, Kui Feng’s right hand had a massive gash with blood pouring out. On the contrary, Ye Chen did not even move much at all. He had only lifted up one of his hands and his sword finger was pressed right in between Kui Feng’s eyebrows. Vaguely, people could see the sharp sword light that was sharper than swords flashing behind.</p><p>“How is this possible?”</p><p>Not to mention the others, even Kui Feng himself could not believe what had just happened. He was moving at such an extreme speed and there were eight of him moving together, he thought he would be able to beat Ye Chen with only one attack. But he had never expected that the latter was able to tell which of him was the real one before being able to blow away that dagger in his hand. Not just the observation, the attacking power and accuracy of his were a couple times more powerful than him.</p><p>“Beating Kui Feng with one attack? What kind of secret art has he trained?”</p><p>Tough King did not think that Kui Feng would be able to beat Ye Chen for sure, and he just wanted him to test out Ye Chen’s power. But, what he did not expect was that Kui Feng would lose within one attack before he could test out anything.</p><p>Of course, it did not mean that Ye Chen was so much more powerful than Kui Feng. All it meant was that Ye Chen’s battling power and techniques were more powerful than Kui Feng’s. But, when the power gap was too big, no matter how powerful battling techniques one had, it would be impossible to break through the defense or help escape from deadly attacks.</p><p>“Impressive! But, your luck ends here.”</p><p>Tough King jumped into the air while throwing out a punch at Ye Chen. As the punch was thrown out, the sky started to rain falling stars, giving people the feel of an apocalypse arriving.</p><p>“This Tough King’s power seemed to be similar to Senior Qin Liu.”</p><p>Ye Chen could tell immediately that Tough King’s martial art contained the profound sense of fire and mud. But of course, with them combined, different effects would appear in different people’s hands.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Ye Chen still did not take out his sword. He pointed out his sword finger and a thunder ball appeared, attacking toward the Tough King. An aggressive qi flow appeared out of nowhere.</p><p>“Huh? It was blocked?”</p><p>The Tough King could not believe the reality. He threw out countless punches toward Ye Chen, each one of them more powerful than the previous one. He did not believe that Ye Chen would be able to handle the attacks.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The clashing qi flow sound was continuously heard as the mud on the island was vaporized. However, Ye Chen did not back out for even half a step.</p><p>“This is my turn now.”</p><p>Chin!</p><p>Ye Chen took out the thunder disaster sword. The sword light flashed once before being stabbed out.</p><p>“It is too fast! I cannot avoid it!”</p><p>The Tough King was shocked as he realized that no matter how hard he tried, he could not avoid this sword at all. It was indeed so fast.</p><p>This sword was indeed Ye Chen’s spiritual sword attack. Once it was thrown out, not many top half step king warriors could avoid it.</p><p>“Even if I cannot avoid it, you can try to break through my protective Zhen yuan first.” The Tough King yelled internally and roared.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>The spiritual sword was very fast, and its attacking power was impressive. With the slight break, it managed to break through the Tough King’s protective Zhen yuan and stabbed right into his heart.</p><p>Pooh!</p><p>Spilling out a mouthful of blood, the Tough King’s chest piece slightly twisted. He then puked out a mouthful of blood before being blown backward into the air.</p><p>“Even the Tough King has been beaten!”</p><p>“Who is this guy?”</p><p>People in the black mountain zone had seen so many people with confidence. But, none of them was able to do what they claimed to do, and were all beaten by the Tough King. Ye Chen’s appearance was like sunshine after a long period of stormy days.</p><p>“I think Black Mountain Zone’s fate is about to be changed.” A lot of people thought to themselves internally.</p><p>“Bring all of their storage rings.” Ye Chen was not some kind of saint. He also wanted to leave the devouring island, so he naturally would not go easy on these dark power parties. He asked Murong Qingcheng to get the other’s storage rings.</p><p>“Do not step over the line.” The followers of Tough King were shocked as they threatened.</p><p>Ye Chen said, “Do not push me to be cruel. Although I cannot kill people on the devouring island, the rule did not say that I cannot cripple you. If I cut off one of your arms, you will still be able to create Zhen yuan crystals. Therefore, do not make me.”.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
