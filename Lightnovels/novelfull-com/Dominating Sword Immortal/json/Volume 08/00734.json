These symbols had been connected by strings of energy which was very unique. It was like a small ball shaped world that existed inside the nature intent which was perfectly controlled by Jiang Tian. In another word, Jiang Tian was the owner of the little world inside.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!…</p><p>Ye Chen continued waving his sword. That black sword qi continued attacking towards the massive symbol ball, but it seemed to have the effect of separating the power. No matter how powerful the attack might be, it could separate it into hundreds to even millions pile of power which decreased its battling power.</p><p>“Gold Furious!”</p><p>Sword intent poured out, Ye Chen waved out an extremely powerful sword attack. The sword qi formed into one beam of dark gold ray and shoot out towards its opponent.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The massive ball had a massive crack in between which then became bigger and bigger. The twisted symbol around was cracking down as well. The sword qi leaked out.</p><p>“Infused sword attack?”</p><p>Jiang Tian was a bit surprised. He hurried to form a spell, throwing out one after another filling up the gap in the air as if he was fixing up his torn apart cloths.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Zhen yuan vibrated, Ye Chen continued to attack that recovering hole in Jiang Tian’s defense power, not giving him any chance to recover fully, trying to fight for a winning chance for himself.</p><p>“Don’t you dare to escape!”</p><p>Jiang Tian was furious, that pattern between his eye brows somehow separated from his head and floated into the air. The next second, that mysteriously power covered that massive symbol ball, that crack started to heal in ten times faster speed. Its recovering speed was indeed faster than Ye Chen’s destroying speed.</p><p>Soon! The symbol ball was perfect looking again.</p><p>“Die! Symbol Kill!”</p><p>He made a grabbing gesture with his right hand. A cold light flashed through Jiang Tian’s eyes.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!…</p><p>The exploding sound was continued to be heard. The symbol that was in the inside of the ball started to attack towards Ye Chen, it twisted in high speed, forming into a tornado. The normal tornado could generate enough power that could destroy buildings and take lives. The tornado formed by the symbol could kill any top master level warriors. even normal demi king warrior would be wounded drastically. It was one of Jiang Tian’s most powerful killing attacks.</p><p>“No. This symbol big ball formed so densely, containing the nature intent that belongs to Jiang Tian. Wanting to break through that ball attack, I will have to make it imperfect first. To create flaws, I would have to shatter the nature intent within and make my sword intent the leading force of them all.”</p><p>Ahh!</p><p>Veins on his forehead popped out. It was Ye Chen’s first time releasing out his destroy sword intent without holding back. Even before when he was fighting Liu Wujian, he was only using his power at a normal level. He did not challenge his limit like now at all. The reason that martial geniuses were called marital geniuses was because they could push to have even more power and explore their potentials in the most critical moment. And obviously, before meeting Jiang Tian, Ye Chen had never met anymore that really challenged him</p><p>The destroy sword intent had reached beyond his limit and no one would know how exactly powerful it would be. But soon, there would be an answer to that.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>With Ye Chen being the starting point, a beam of black sword intent shoot out into the sky. That beam of sword intent did not break through the massive ball, but it had messed up the nature intent within the massive ball. It caused Jiang Tian to lose control over it. Ye Chen turned into a destroyer sword artist with his black sword intent. His whole body was covered within. Wherever he went, all of the incoming intent attack could be shattered. Although he might not be the leader of this area, but he was the destroyer. And he was ahead of everyone.</p><p>“What? The nature intent had been breached!”</p><p>It was the first time a surprised impression appeared on Jiang Tian’s face. The symbol ball was his killing attack. Before even the dark shadow ghost bat king had been trapped for a long while. He did not think that Ye Chen had the former’s power. But obviously, he had used his sword intent to breach through his nature intent and make his art flawed. Meanwhile, the ghost bat king obviously did not know the deep mechanism of these martial arts after all and only tried to break through with savage power.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The natural intent was messed up. The symbol on the massive ball started to become chaotic. Ye Chen seized the chance and threw out a sword attack. The dark beam of ray shoot through the symbol massive ball and attacked towards Jiang Tian.</p><p>“Seal!”</p><p>A huge amount of symbol gathered together and turned into a shield, Jiang Tian controlled the shield remotely, blocking in front of his body.</p><p>Boom! The symbol spilled everywhere like moth wrapped with emerald color flame. The dark gold ray suddenly landed on Jiang Tian’s defense shield which disturbed the balance of his body. He was then blown out before landing on the ground. He then had his back on the stone room wall.</p><p>Cough! Cough!</p><p>The dark gold ray went through the symbol ball, it shattered a part of the power. After going through the shield, it burned up a part of other power as well. The remaining power could no longer shatter Jiang Tian’s defence power but it really wounded him. He could feel the heaviness on his chest which made him dry coughed couple of times.</p><p>He then squinted his eyes, that cold light appeared in the back of his eyes. Jiang Tian said with a creepy tone, “I think I have underestimated you after all. I did not expect to see you to shatter thorugh my symbol world.”</p><p>Ye Chen had his destroy sword intent exploded to its limit as he walked out from the shattering symbol ball, he said calmly, “Does this mean that the situation had gotten out of your control?”</p><p>“Not necessary.”</p><p>His palm left a symbol palm print on the stone room wall, Jiang Tian jumped at Ye Chen with extreme speed as he threw a palm attack from the above.</p><p>“Symbol Killing Palm attack!”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The massive twisted symbol fell down from above, covering Ye Chen within.</p><p>“Five sword attack!”</p><p>Using the right hand sword finger attack, the gold sword on Ye Chen’s back came out on its own. It separated into three beams then five beams of sword shadows towards that massive symbol palm power.</p><p>The explosion sound was heard. The palm power turned into emerald flame, burning his gold sword.</p><p>“Fast speed!”</p><p>Ye Chen frowned. He waved out his sword finger again, that gold sword was slightly twisted after being burned for so long. It shoot out towards Jiang Tian.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Jiang Tian had a smile on his face as he reached out his right hand. A massive hand made up by symbols held onto the gold sword. The hand then made a strong grip, and the already-cracked gold sword had been shattered into pieces.</p><p>Meanwhile, Jiang Tian started to mumble some kind of spells, “Symbol Killing Spell!”</p><p>“Danger!”</p><p>Ye Chen’s pupil shrieked, inside his soul power, countless tiny symbol spells attacked over him.</p><p>He flashed his body once trying to escape from the incoming attack.</p><p>However, he had underestimated these symbols. They did not come in solid forms, it was all happening within one second but couple of spells went inside Ye Chen’s mind, floating on top of his soul ocean, trying to destroy this calm balance.</p><p>“This is soul attack!”</p><p>Ye Chen suddenly was terrified. It was his first time suffering the soul attack. And it was not a normal one. It was soul attacking martial art that was built on the foundation of soul power. It was the top secret martial art. Even Life and death level king warriors might not have learned this powerful soul power attacking marital arts.</p><p>As the spell was taken place, Ye Chen’s soul ocean started to scramble.</p><p>“Destroy!”</p><p>The destroy sword soul started its attack, countless destroy sword intent started to attack the intruder, shattering it completely.</p><p>However, soon, more symbol appeared out of nowhere.</p><p>“You really think there is nothing I can do to this?”</p><p>Ye Chen’s eyes were full of killing. The destroy sword soul switched from completely still to active. It started to shoot around above Ye Chen’s soul ocean. Wherever it went, countless symbol spell had been destroyed. Ye Chen’s soul power was five times more powerful than normal people. It would be impossible to be destroyed. Of course, he would not be so stupid and let his opponent try so he activated his destroy sword power immediately using his sword soul to shatter the spell.</p><p>“Such a powerful sword soul?”</p><p>Jiang Tian could sense it that the symbol spells that he had shoot out had been shattered piece by piece and it did not achieve the goal it should. The spell burned out his soul power rapidly, even if he did not want it to happen this way, but he still had to admit that his killing attack could not work on Ye Chen.</p><p>“These two!”</p><p>Dantain Mingyue’s nicely-shaped lip was now wide open. A surprised expression was obvious on her face. The two’s power was within her estimation, therefore, she was not that shocked by that. However, Jiang Tian’s symbol killing spell had given her the feeling of being terrified. Normal attacks, even if she could not block it out, she would be able to leave in peace and without a wound, but soul attacks would not be something she could escape from. For warriors at their level right now, it would be a killing attack. Once being hit by this attack, only warriors who reached life and death realm might have a chance to understand it and increase their soul defense. But obviously, Ye Chen managed to do so. She could not believe how exactly powerful his soul power was.</p><p>“Blood Ghost Finger!”</p><p>Getting rid of all of the incoming spell attacks, Ye Chen pointed out one finger and drew in the air at Jiang Tian. Perhaps it was because of his increased killing intent or Jiang Tian’s existence had inspired Ye Chen’s battling intent, his sword attack had somehow drawn out a white evil ghost figure. According to the introduction of the secret art the blood ghost finger attack, only by reaching minor completion can the warrior reach this level. And even the dragon king’s ghost finger attack had only reached minor completion.</p><p>Unfortunately, it could only appear for one brief moment before disappearing as if it had never existed. It was why that it did not cause Jiang Tian and dantai Mingyue’s attention.</p><p>However the power of the ghost finger had still shocked Dantian Mingyue. While even Jiang Tian was getting shocked as well.</p><p>A creepy white ghost claw ignored his defense and enter his body, leaving a deep bloodly mark.</p><p>Jiang Tian looked at YE Chen before jumping towards the door. His qi and blood had lost quite a lot. If continued fighting then the consequences would be unimaginable</p><p>Ye Chen did not plan to let him go, he performed another two times of blood ghost finger attack, oppressing on Jiang Tian’s qi.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>Jiang Tian left the stone room.</p><p>Ye Chen followed behind.</p><p>“There will always be a higher mountain. Unfortunately, Ye Chen will always be that highest mountain.”</p><p>Dantai Mingyue stood at where she was standing shook her head. Ye Chen had been in the top list for years now. during which, he had been challenged couple of times, but without an excpetion, they all had failed. Even Dugu Jue who had been standing right next to him had failed. If there could only be one beast in one era, then Ye Chen without a doubt would be that beast.</p><p>“Ye Chen, I will be the one that beat you.”</p><p>In the air, Jiang Tian saw that Ye Chen was chasing behind him. His voice was ice cold.</p><p>Ye Chen said, “I remember you have said that before.”</p><p>“You really think you can kill me?”</p><p>A pair of symbol wings appeared from the back of Jiang Tian. He flapped them, suddenly the speed increased drastically, reaching way ahead of Ye Chen. He was only a little bit away from being detected.</p><p>“Speed, is also one of my advantages.”</p><p>Jiang Tian was indeed powerful in all areas and without flaws. However, he was facing Ye Chen who was the same. A flying sword fell below Ye Chen’s feet. Ye Chen’s speed increased drastically, decreasing the distance between them.</p><p>“Huh! You fell in the trap.”</p><p>What Ye Chen could not see was that cruel smile on Jiang Tian’s face. As he left the stone room, he could sense the Wind King’s sense through his jade tag and he was approaching him right now as they spoke. With Storm Wind King’s power, it would be more than easy to kill Ye Chen. Although he had a slight regret that he could not kill Ye Chen himself.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
