His current cultivation base was only at the peak of mid Sea of Soul realm, not even attaining the late Sea of Soul realm. But, even his mid Sea of Soul realm Astral Yuan was beyond the comprehension of an ordinary man.</p><p>Even Murong Qingcheng’s Demonic Power couldn’t be compared with it. Of course, Murong Qingcheng had the perfect demonic body. Adding her cultivation base at late Sea of Soul realm and her experience of entering one with the world, allowing her rapid improvements in profound martial skills, her battle strength was far above Chu Zhongtian.</p><p>If Chu Zhongtian’s mid Sea of Soul realm cultivation base advanced to late Sea of Soul realm, he would absolutely be an existence in the top three of Masters List, and a contender for the spots of Dugu Jue and Tantai Mingyue. As for who would win and who would lose, that would be hard to guess. After all, beside his Astral Body, he lacked in many other aspects.</p><p>“A great era is about to begin. Ten years later, a lot of people will be entering Life and Death King realm.” Ye Chen exhaled, an indescribable gleam flickering in his eyes.</p><p>Mysterious Queen entered Life and Death realm at the age of thirty five. This record, even during a great era, would be an extraordinary feat. There would hardly be anybody able to surpass her, and even Ye Chen didn’t have the confidence to do so. After all, there was still the peak of Sea of Soul realm and half-step Life and Death King before he could finally attain the Life and Death King realm. Just the gap between half-step Life and Death King and peak Sea of Soul realm made countless people get stuck for their entire life.</p><p>However, this was an era of rare geniuses. Ten years later, there would be a few who’d enter the realm of Life and Death. For example, Bai Wuxue was a young man of this era, already thirty five years, or even older. Ten years later, it wouldn’t be impossible for him to enter the realm of Life and Death.</p><p>Ten years later, Ye Chen himself would be thirty seven years old.</p><p>The two had exceptionally high speed, only taking a couple of breaths to cover several hundred li. The millions of eyes around Nine Dragon Lake turned toward the two incoming figures of Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng, instantly making them the focal point of attention.</p><p>Phew!</p><p>Some let of sigh of relief, and their anxious faces somewhat relaxed. Until now, there was no Ye Chen, Dugu Jjue, or Tangtai Mingyue. Although there were a large number of people present at the scene, not many were powerful. Thus, they lacked confidence. The arrival of Ye Chen was equivalent to them gaining their spine back, no longer being suppressed by the pressure exuded by Liu Wujian and Gu Lie.</p><p>“With Ye Chen, our chances are thirty percent higher. We now have the power to fight back.”</p><p>“Unfortunately, Dugu Jue and Tantai Mingyue are not here. Otherwise, it would have been even higher.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, it’s just a little past dawn. Who knows they might arrive later.”</p><p>Numerous discussions arose at the same time.</p><p>“Sure enough, you came!” Liu Wujian glanced at Ye Chen.</p><p>Ye Chen said indifferently, “No need to waste any more time. Let’s settle this.”</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The former shook his head, “I still can’t ascertain whether you have the qualifications to battle me. You have to defeat Gu Lie first.</p><p>“Insane!”</p><p>“Too arrogant.”</p><p>“He thinks this is West Ocean?”</p><p>Hearing Liu Wujian’s words, a commotion broke out.</p><p>“Ye Chen, let me go in your stead.”</p><p>As Ye Chen was about to speak, Yan Fengfeng shot across.</p><p>She had witnessed Gu Lie’s strength with her own eyes. He was indeed strong, and she didn’t even have fifty percent certainty of beating him. However, she had the advantage of speed. Even if she couldn’t beat the former, he also wouldn’t be able to injure her. In that aspect, others simply couldn’t compare to her. This was her innate talent.</p><p>“Careful!” Ye Chen didn’t decline her offer. He was quite clear on her strength and expertise.</p><p>Shua!</p><p>But suddenly, a beam of light suddenly streaked in, amidst criss-crossing blade Qi.</p><p>“We both use blades, so let me face him.” The light scattered, revealing a proud and aloof youngster standing in the air. Who could it be if not Dugu Jue? With his gaze on Gu Lie, he said indifferently.</p><p>Yan Fengfeng hesitated for a moment before retreating. Since Dugu Jue had arrived, there was no need for her to act. Most importantly, she could tell that the odds of her succeeding were not high.</p><p>“Dugu Jue! It’s Dugu Jue! Who would have thought he’d be only a step slower than Ye Chen! I was worried when he would come.”</p><p>“Haha…Ye Chen is here, and Dugu Jue has also arrived. There is no need to worry anymore.”</p><p>Dugu Jue’s arrival greatly increased the confidence of everybody. Until now, they were worried that Ye Chen along wouldn’t be enough. However, at this moment, everything had been resolved.</p><p>“Take out your blade!”</p><p>Dugu Jue seized the initiative, looking down on Gu Lie.</p><p>“Ninety nine blades…you’ll lose.” Gu Lie looked at Dugu Jie gravely. He could feel the blade aura from the latter’s body, which was not one bit inferior to his own. Moreover, it was an aura that could make one instantly feel despair.</p><p>“Ninety nine blades…You won’t be able to take a single hair off me in a thousand blades.” Dugu Jue sneered.</p><p>“First blade.”</p><p>Gu Lie didn’t waste any words and took out his long blade; his right arm swelled as he chopped down. Before the first strike was finished, his second strike immediately followed behind it. One after another, he issued nine strikes, closely following each other and as quick as lightning.</p><p>Clank Clank…</p><p>On the other side, Dugu Jue unsheathed his slender blade and effortlessly deflected Gu Lie’s strikes.</p><p>“How powerful! Dugu Jue has become much more powerful! Gu Lie’s consecutive strikes doesn’t threaten him at all.”</p><p>“Dugu Jue, defeat him!” Numerous cheers resounded.</p><p>Beside Lu Shaoyou, Bai Wuxue praised, “Worthy of being one of the monstrosities! His progress is not something ordinary people can keep up with.”</p><p>Although Bai Wuxue was ranked fourth and Dugu Jue second on the Masters List, when it came to an all out battle, he might not necessarily lose to the latter. However, Dugu Jue was evidently stronger, and his blade arts seemed almost effortless.</p><p>“Ye Chen, how many moves you think they will take?” Murong Qingcheng asked Ye Chen.</p><p>Ye Chen pondered for a moment and then said, “Around three hundred moves! And Dugu Jue will probably be the winner.”</p><p>“You think he will win?”</p><p>“The despairing blade intent is hard to master. Dugu Jue is able to keep the despairing intent reserved, only letting it erupt during his attacks. It means his realm has improved again.”</p><p>“En, it’s a little different indeed.” Murong Qingcheng faintly nodded.</p><p>“Reveal your trump card, or you will be losing here.” Dugu Jue’s momentum seemed unstoppable, and Gu Lie was gradually influenced by it. Such a matter seemed impossible before. Gu Lie’s conduct had been extremely tyrannical before, defeating a top genius like Chu Zhongtian in one move.</p><p>“Brother Gu, defeat him for me.”</p><p>The multicolor-robed woman shouted and screamed, seeming unsettled.</p><p>Gu Lie didn’t have the mind to care about her. Dugu Jue was more frightening than he’d estimated. He had the same feeling while Liu Wujian, suppressed him in every aspect.</p><p>“Hell Chop!”</p><p>His concentration reached the extreme as Gu Lie leaped up and slashed down. A gray colored blade Qi merged with the heaven and earth—fierce, sinister, and tyrannous.</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>Dugu Jue neither retreated nor dodged as he slashed the slender blade in his hand upward. A despairing aura suddenly gushed, whitening the entire sky.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Dugu Jue dropped down, stepping on the lake water and creating ripples in the water. On the other hand, Gu Lie spun and tumbled a few times before stumblingly landing on a summit.</p><p>In this exchange, Dugu Jue came out on top.</p><p>“Tyrannous Twenty Four Blades.”</p><p>Feeling that the strategy of pinning trump cards against trump cards was not good for him, Gu Lie stamped on the summit and his figure flickered beside Dugu Jue, issuing one strike after another, opting for close combat instead.</p><p>Clang Clang Clang…</p><p>But, how could Dugu Jue be afraid of him? Raising his blade, he welcomed the other.</p><p>On the lake and in the sky, blade light flickered everywhere and energies erupted. The two figures could no longer be seen, as if they had disappeared into the void.</p><p>Kacha!</p><p>Blade Qi continuously flowed out, changing the Nine Dragon Lake beyond recognition.</p><p>“What a fierce battle! A confrontation between blade artists is much more blood boiling than I imagined.”</p><p>“Too powerful! I feel like going up, though I will end up getting diced without even knowing.”</p><p>Hearing the discussions around, the multicolor-robed woman creased her brows. She had thought that there would be no experts in True Spirit Continent, and it had long since waned. However, the appearance of Dugu Jue’s appearance slashed her confidence in Gu Lie like a swift blade. The latter was indeed strong. Where did he pop out from?”</p><p>“The blade of Despair!”</p><p>Dugu Jue’s pupils whitened as he chopped. With that, the despairing aura turned into a string, slashing at Gu Lie along with blade Qi.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Gu Lie considered his blade to be swift, but Dugu Jue was even swifter. He immediately raised his blade to block, lowering his center of gravity.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Glaring sparks burst forth as Gu Lie slipped along the lake water, his clothes torn apart.</p><p>“Despairing Fox!”</p><p>Not missing his advantage, Dugu Jue’s blade Qi turned even richer as he hacked a demonic claw phantom. The fox had a malevolent appearance, showing its sharp and dense teeth. Letting out an overflowing despairing aura, it bit toward Gu Lie.</p><p>“Sky Tyrant Blade.”</p><p>Revealing popping blue veins on his forehead, Gu Lie roared as a ferocious aura erupted, and his entire being seemed to have turned ginormous. Holding the blade with both hands, he fiercely chopped down.</p><p>A dense, bleak sword light chopped at the demonic fox phantom.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The demonic fox phantom let out a bleak white light beam before disintegrating, pounding on Gu Lie’s Protective Zhen Yuan. The protective Zhen Yuan shattered, and Gu Lie spurted out a mouthful of blood before flying off and falling on the lakeside.</p><p>Gu Lie was defeated…defeated by Dugu Jie without being able to seize the slightest bit of advantage in the entire fight! Dugu Jue’s grandeur had stunned everybody. Even Liu Wujian couldn’t help but crease his brows, feeling that the former wouldn’t be easy to deal with. He was extraordinary indeed.</p><p>“So, it turns out that he is the most powerful expert of True Spirit Continent. That Sword Master is merely in name.” The multicolor-robed woman said.</p><p>“Interesting! My target is to beat all the geniuses of True Spirit Continent. But, if it were too easy, it would be boring. Seems like he is my strongest opponent. Liu Wujian was moved with the desire to battle. He couldn’t easily find opponents as he was invincible in West Ocean. It was indeed too boring there.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
