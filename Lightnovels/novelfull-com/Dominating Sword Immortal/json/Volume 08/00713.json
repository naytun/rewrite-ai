Instead, he was someone whom no one would want to mess with. He was nothing but a man beast, and attacking him would be suicidal. Hence, they started to run for their lives.</p><p>\"Ants.\"</p><p>The young man did not chase after them. These people were not worth it, he thought.</p><p>Putting away the storage ring, the teenager looked into the distance, \"I have been in the north sea for so long, I have never been to the deep ocean that's beyond the north ocean. I wonder who can block my attacks in this land.\"</p><p>After standing there for a while, a glass symbol appeared outside the teenager's body. The symbol twisted slightly, taking him flying out into the horizon.</p><p>\"Too horrifying!\"</p><p>Once the teenager left, two Sea of Souls Realm warriors who were passing by appeared a hundred miles away. They were terrified before, fearing that they might get killed by the mob. But, what they did not expect was to see the whole mob being killed by a young teenager.</p><p>\"This man's power is so shocking! I think he might be the first warrior right below half step king warrior. I wonder where he came from. I have never seen him before.\"</p><p>\"There will always be more powerful people out there in this world. And, we are also in the peak era, so there might be more and more coming as well. Although we have reached beyond the age for getting crazily powerful, it does not mean that it would be impossible as well. On the contrary, this will be our chance.\"</p><p>\"You are right…This is the era for us as well.\"</p><p>…</p><p>It had only been one week since the battle above the Nine Dragon Lake. Ye Chen's Sword Master title had spread out in the whole Sky Martial Region, and added with the reputation from before, he was on the top of the world right now. Some of the disciples had used him as a role model.</p><p>It was just like before, when everyone thought that the Mysterious Queen was the No.1 martial genius. But now, Ye Chen seemed about to take over the title. Of course, it might be seeming that way, but as long as Ye Chen did not enter the Life and Death Realm, he could not be compared to the Mysterious Queen. For the longest time, countless top powerful martial geniuses had been stuck in the Sea of Souls Realm. No one could be sure that Ye Chen could be one; all they knew was that there might be hope.</p><p>Ye Chen was too powerful, and the pavilion did not need to wait for the next month to deem him as the new No. 1 warrior of the whole ranking. His introduction had been written a long time ago as well.</p><p>Adding this time, this was the third time Ye Chen was ranked in the first place on the ranking. His place was stable and unshakable.</p><p>After renting a whole fancy yard near the city, Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng stayed there.</p><p>There were mountains and rivers, covering huge grounds. Right next to the green waters, Ye Chen was training his Defensive Sword Control spell.</p><p>During the battle with Liu Wujian, he had revealed his most powerful attack, which meant he had no more secret power anymore. This was not something he wanted. So right now, it would be his top priority to train his Three Sword Attack to Five Sword Attack level.</p><p>Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!</p><p>Once he reached the Five Sword Attack level, although the pure attacking power might not increase by a lot, the overall power would increase by ten percent in battle. For example, Liu Wujian's attack was indeed formed from three beams of sword qi shooting at the same time. If three sword attacks could not compete with that, five would make a huge difference.</p><p>It would always be quantity and quality in the end.</p><p>After attaining enough quality, there should be more focus on quantity. It would be equally powerful in two aspects.</p><p>However, the Defensive Sword Control spell was getting harder and harder to train. Three Sword level looked just like the Five Sword level, but it would be more time consuming. It had been two months of training, but he had still not succeeded. At this pace, reaching Seven Sword level and Nine Sword level would probably take even more time.</p><p>Of course, if he reached the Late Sea of Souls Realm, it would make everything so much easier, since training the spell would require a lot of comprehensive ability, which had a lot to do with Zhen yuan level. With a high Zhen yuan level, it would be easy to make progress. Once he reached the Life and Death Realm, Ye Chen believed he could train to forty-nine sword attack within one day.</p><p>After a couple of days, Ye Chen had made new understanding every day, and felt that everything was getting smoother and smoother. He felt like things were about to get to the level he wanted them to reach.</p><p>\"Now!\"</p><p>As a sword finger gesture was made, Ye Chen made a low groan.</p><p>Chin!</p><p>As he shot out three beams of golden light at the same time, they separated into five beams for a split second before shrinking down to three beams.</p><p>\"Soon!\"</p><p>Ye Chen knew it very well that he would not need to train so hard before reaching the five sword attack level.</p><p>…</p><p>Boom!</p><p>There was a mountain ruin inside the Sky Martial Region which was extremely ancient.</p><p>On this day, huge exploding noises appeared above the ruin mountain. After that came lightning, thunder, and tornado, along with blizzards and snow storms. These natural disasters could not be underestimated. They were not normal lightning bolts, but the surreal lightning caused by the friction of space power. The tornado was godly wind from the surreal space. All of them contained surreal power, which could devour countless half step king warriors. Even normal Life and Death Realm warriors would be seriously wounded, which was indeed extremely horrifying.</p><p>As all of them slowly disappeared, another huge wave of vibration appeared with the ruin mountains inside the Sky Martial Region being the center. The sky, the lake, and the ground had become a media of radiation, and it would be impossible not to sense it. That spreading speed exceeded that of light, and it could reach out hundreds of thousand miles within a second. At the same time, the ground was experiencing an earthquake.</p><p>\"What happened?\"</p><p>\"What is going on?\"</p><p>\"An earthquake?\"</p><p>All of the sudden, each city, each town, each village, and even the lone warriors out in the countryside as well as the hidden training warriors…everyone on the land could feel the vibration, even in the air.</p><p>\"This vibration is quite unusual.\"</p><p>Some warriors walked out from where they had been training. They came outside and had their eyes closed as they tried to sense the source of the vibration carefully. But, they then realized that it came from a very far away place, so it would be impossible to sense it.</p><p>Inside the Mysterious Martial School…</p><p>Right next to the pond on the floating mountain, a young lady slowly lifted up her head. She looked toward the direction where the ruin mountains were, her vision seeming to reach all the way through everything.</p><p>Looking back, the young lady made a grabbing gesture, capturing a hint of the space power. After examining for a while, she mumbled to herself, \"This is a minor surreal space caused by the space power clashing into the space blockade. It should mean that some moving forbidden place has revealed itself. Well, I will send Feng'er to check it out.\"</p><p>Inside the surreal Martial School…</p><p>A middle aged man in glorious clothing and golden crown opened his eyes. Inside his eyes seemed to be present an entire sky. Something horrifying had happened as his pupils shrank a little. With that, this whole world inside his eyes shrank, and the scenery that was hundred thousand miles away suddenly flashed through in his eyes.</p><p>All that was happening inside the ruin mountains appeared in his eyes.</p><p>\"The forbidden ground has appeared. This qi…Perhaps it's the Four Emperor qi?\"</p><p>The top four extreme rank emperors had been the legendary stories since ancient history. It would be impossible to get it mixed up with other things.</p><p>\"Zun'er's chance is here. Those old things should appear soon after all.\"</p><p>His pupils went back to normal, but his eyes were shining with a bright light as he seemed to be thinking about something. Nothing he planned could be stopped by Sea of Souls Realm warriors, and only king warriors at the same realm would have a chance.</p><p>Inside the Evil King Pavilion, the back mountain Gu Sha...</p><p>A teenager with narrow eyebrows walked out, standing slim and tall.</p><p>\"Haha…It has been decades since I've laid a hand on anyone. I wonder how those guys are doing. Yan Qingxuan, you might have won against me last time, but the result might be different this time.\"</p><p>As the young man walked out, all the plants around him started to grow creepily.</p><p>There was a pace on the edge of shattering itself at the end of the Eastern ocean. There were countless holes in this space, and it was constantly changing. Inside this black hole like space, airflow was shot out from time to time. It was like a massive blovk of cheese in the surreal mid air.</p><p>In the deep end of the space, an elder with white hair sat with his eyes closed, not looking like he was about to wake up. All he gave out was that deathly vibe which was slowly decreasing, while the vitality started to grow stronger and stronger.</p><p>At the same time, all of the king warriors around the Sky Martial Region could sense it as well. All of their eyes brightened as they started to plan in their heads while having different expression on their faces.</p><p>As for the king warriors outside the Sky Martial Region, they could not sense anything yet.</p><p>…</p><p>\"Five Sword Attack!\"</p><p>Ye Chen had sensed it a couple of days ago as well, but he decided to calm himself down. Right now, the most important thing for him was to train to five sword attack level. The rest would mean nothing to him right now.</p><p>…</p><p>\"Five sword attack!\"</p><p>Chin!</p><p>He made a gesture with his right hand, and the gold sword in his hand turned into a beam of golden light shooting out of the scabbard. The whole space shook once as the sword had split into two. Stopping for a second, the Zhen yuan gold swords split into two each as well. The Five sword level was finally reached. Although it was rather unstable at this stage, it was completed after all. All he needed was a little bit more training to stabilize it.</p><p>\"Let's go!\"</p><p>He pointed out his finger, and five beams of gold light punctured through the top rank shield in front, leaving five sword holes on it that were emitting smoke.</p><p>It was not over yet. Being controlled by Ye Chen, the five beams of golden light spread out and started to make crazy stabbing gestures in the air. Each beam of light looked like an actual sword artist performing attacks. It would be impossible to tell that they were all generated by one warrior.</p><p>\"Come back!\"</p><p>After infusing five into one, the gold sword plunged back into its scabbard.</p><p>\"I have trained it! I wonder if Murong has brought some news back.\" The vibration was something for sure, but Ye Chen had not gone out for a while, while Murong did.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
