Moreover, the pill he’d taken out was the greatly famed Blood Yuan Pill, which they reserved only for grave injuries that were hard to cure. Despite being half-step Kings they only obtained one pill each. White Nightmare would have to wait a whole year before he could get his hands on another.</p><p>“This kid can’t be dealt with alone. We’ll have to wait for the other four to arrive, then use the Six Way Cloud Formation to kill him.” The fat demonic man inwardly said.</p><p>Inside the enchantment, on the island…</p><p>Sheathing his sword, Ye Chen gazed at Murong Qingcheng’s cultivation site.</p><p>“When will she come out? Will she succeed?” Ye Chen was hesitating. If Murong Qingcheng needed more time, the danger looming over them would exponentially increase. Everybody knew that the demonic human clan had sent a lot of experts. Once the number of Sea of Soul realm experts reached a certain extent, and adding a few half-step Demonic Human Kings on top, he could only flee. And his most pressing concern was that demonic human clans might send a Demonic King after him.</p><p>Life and Death realm was the peak strength of True Spirit World. Upon attaining this realm, one would be unfettered to wherever they pleased. Life and Death Kings were extremely hard to kill. Even the weakest King had the ability to regenerate limbs. As long as their head and heart were intact, a little bit of injury was nothing to them. If they cultivated to Flesh Derivation, they would be able to resurrect even if their bodies were turned into meat paste. The most powerful was the Blood drop Rebirth stage—as long as a drop of their blood existed, no matter how small it was, they could be reborn.</p><p>The pursuit of a Life and Death King was the most frightening trouble one could encounter.</p><p>“One more day…If she doesn’t come out, I can only wake her up and leave this place.” With his creased brows relaxing, Ye Chen said inwardly.</p><p>“Although I only have some assurance of breaking this enchantment and might not necessarily succeed, taking this opportunity, I might as well comprehend the space profound some more. Even a teensy bit of progress is still progress. Moreover, I’m just a step away from forty percent completion. Who knows, I might end up succeeding!”</p><p>Ten percent completion of space profound was equal to thirty percent of other profounds. Hence, forty percent completion would be equivalent to a hundred and twenty percent, which meant that it had already exceeded the perfection of other profounds. Once Ye Chen reached this realm, the might of his Void Shattering Finger would be no less than Waning Moon.</p><p>Returning to his cave, Ye Chen continued to comprehend space profound, analyzing the basics.</p><p>Inside Murong Qingcheng’s cave, the black light flickered with an increasingly higher frequency. The white-colored mist had already flooded the cave, turning the cave cozy yet indiscernible. At the center, Murong Qingcheng sat amidst the dense white fog. This white fog was being emitted from her head without a pause.</p><p>Her complexion was abnormally red, and her lips were drying up, no longer moist like before.</p><p>The fast blood circulation was quickly evaporating the water inside her body. Even if she had perfect demonic blood vessels, she couldn’t endure a large loss of water. After all, her body was still made up of blood and flesh, not energy. And water was vital for flesh and vitality.</p><p>Time slowly ticked by, and the water loss of her body was becoming more and more severe. Her lips began to crack, and long black hair slowly dimmed, losing their splendor; her breathing also turned increasingly heavier.</p><p>…</p><p>Night fell, and a crescent moon hung in the sky. Both inside and outside the enchantment, it was a race against time.</p><p>Shua Sua Shua!</p><p>Far in the distance, a buzz of air-cleaving sounds could be heard, travelling at a high speed. One moment, they could only be faintly heard, but in the next moment, they were already clear.</p><p>“They’re here!” The fat demonic man was delighted as he leaped to his feet and soared in the sky.</p><p>“Haha…Duo Long, didn’t expect your group to be the first. You even had the Hidden Mist Enchantment laid down!” More than two hundred men were majestically flying across, and the speaker was a red-robed demonic man. He had a tall and sturdy figure, a square head, and a few black scales on his face.</p><p>“You’re late, Black Scales!” The fat demonic man, Duo Long, smiled.</p><p>“We’re a bit late. Our side also had a suspect, but his strength was too low, probably not the killer. I easily killed him.” The red-robed demonic man said nonchalantly.</p><p>“You did right to kill him.” Duo Long faintly nodded.</p><p>“Eh? White Nightmare is so injured heavily! Who did it?” The gray-robed demonic man beside Black Scales remarked. Hearing him, Black Scales also turned around.</p><p>Duo Long’s face sunk, “We’ve already exchanged blows with the killer. White Nightmare was injured by him.”</p><p>“How powerful is this person? Can you speak in detail?” Black Scales face turned rather grave.</p><p>Duo Long thoroughly recounted the incident.</p><p>“White Nightmare was actually almost killed by him.” Black Scales said gloomily.</p><p>White Nightmare’s strength was the strongest among them, and even he lost miserably. They could feel how powerful Ye Chen was.</p><p>“I was thinking of going in and killing the murderer on the spot. Seems like I have to hold that thought.” The gray-robed demonic human glanced at the enchantment and said.</p><p>“Right…White Nightmare is currently healing with everything he has. We don’t have much of a chance just by the three of us. Of course, adding hundreds of clansmen, we don’t have to fear him. We can kill him if he doesn’t escape, but if he manages to escape, we’ll have to spend a lot of time to find him again.</p><p>“Wait for Blue Blood and the others. Once we six join hands and use the Six Way Cloud Formation, even if he is a ‘strongest’ half-step King, he won’t be able to do anything.”</p><p>“Hm, let’s wait then!”</p><p>The three chose a towering reef and sat cross-legged, silently waiting.</p><p>…</p><p>Time flew by, and a red hue appeared above the ocean. A few moments later, a strong sunlight reflection sprinkled from the seawater.</p><p>Dawn…</p><p>From Ye Chen’s cave, a burst of strange spatial ripples spread out. Under the spatial ripple, even the summits warped, waving like reflections inside the water as water moved. It looked extremely mystical.</p><p>The spatial ripple’s frequency increased more and more, and in response, the summits warped more and more.</p><p>Finally!</p><p>Peng!</p><p>The entire summit shattered like mirrors and folded over into countless chunks piled together. Ye Chen hovered over the pile of rocks. The space around his body was warped, as if he was separated from the world.</p><p>“Forty percent space profound, success!” Opening his eyes, a smile appeared in Ye Chen’s eyes.</p><p>The Four Extreme Emperor’s basics of space were too precious. With them, Ye Chen was no longer like before, fumbling his way through and often far off from his target, which made him waste a lot of time. Going by the basics of space, Ye Chen was systematically comprehending the space profound. Although he didn’t progress often, when he did, it was a chain of improvements.</p><p>Forty percent space profound was equal to a hundred and twenty percent of other profounds. Perhaps even the majority of Life and Death Kings were inferior to him in this aspect. After all, Ye Chen’s comprehension was already five times that of others. Adding the basics given to him, his advantage was too big.</p><p>“Now I can begin to create my own space profound sword art. Only by creating my own space profound sword art can I bring out the space profound to fullest.”</p><p>The profound martial skills of others belonged to others. One’s understanding of others’ skills couldn’t be too deep, especially not compared to one’s own.</p><p>“Eh? Murong seems to have made great progress.”</p><p>Hovering in the air, Ye Chen could feel strong ripples of demonic power from Murong Qingcheng’s place. These ripples were no longer of Sea of Soul realm, and were nearing half-step King realm. Murong Qingcheng’s breakthrough was clearly around the corner. It could even be at the very next moment.</p><p>…</p><p>“Haha, we’re here!”</p><p>While Murong Qingcheng was at a critical juncture, the situation outside the enchantment changed as another group of people arrived. Their numbers were also two hundred and two. Adding on the others already present, all the troops dispatched by demonic human clan had gathered together.</p><p>“We were waiting for you.” Black Scales let out a sigh of relief and smiled.</p><p>“What’s going on? The person inside the enchantment is so strong? Even you four together aren’t sure?” Among the two half-step Kings, one had a light blue skin while the other had a wooden expression. Sensing the crux of the issue, the former asked.</p><p>“He is stronger than you can imagine. But, now that we all are here, he won’t escape even if he grows wings, and can only obediently follow us back.”</p><p>“White Nightmare is also about to finish.” The fat demonic man, Duo Long, said.</p><p>“En, this is the time.”</p><p>Shortly after, White Nightmare, who was sitting cross-legged on the reef, opened his eyes. Zhen Yuan violently surged out of his body, turning the reef into dust and causing the tides to move backward. He leapt to his feet and flew to the other half-step Kings’ side as he said with a voice brimming with killing intent, “Let’s start!”</p><p>“Go, enter!” Duo Ling indicated the Sea of Soul realm experts that were managing the enchantment to open a channel.</p><p>Shua! Shua!</p><p>The six charged in, and other Sea of Soul realm experts also followed behind in their formations. The enchantment closed again, leaving behind only a hundred and eight Sea of Soul realm demonic humans responsible for maintaining the enchantment.</p><p>“Six half-step Demonic Human Kings…five hundred Sea of Soul realm experts.”</p><p>Ye Chen’s complexion turned unsightly. He didn’t expect so many experts to come. One White Nightmare was already not weak, and adding five more half-step Kings was no small matter. Moreover, the number of Sea of Soul realm experts was reaching five hundred, which was already a medium sized force. It could easily sweep half-step Kings.</p><p>Ye Chen was astounded, but White Nightmare and others were even more astonished. Their astonishment didn’t stem from Ye Chen, but Murong Qingcheng’s cultivation site.</p><p>They could actually feel rich demonic power ripples coming from there. It should be known that demonic power could only be cultivated by those with perfect demonic blood vessels. Neither humans nor ordinary demonic humans could cultivate demonic power. Could this guy’s companion have perfect demonic vessels? It was simply unimaginable!</p><p>Moreover, from the ripples, it seemed as if the latter was making a major breakthrough. If demonic human with perfect demonic vessels broke through into half-step King realm, they would be perfect half-step Demonic Human Kings.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
