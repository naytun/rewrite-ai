He could pay attention to fine details in this aspect primarily because his own defense was quite high, and thus, he had a good insight. However, he discovered that be it Liu Wujian or Ye Chen, both had an endurance that was far above his.</p><p>Liu Wujian was still alright. After all, he had a semi extreme grade armor and semi extreme grade jewel. Moreover, his cultivation base was already at the peak of late Sea of Soul realm. Thus, his Zhen Yuan was bound to be extremely vigorous. However, Ye Chen merely had a semi extreme grade armor, and his cultivation base was also merely at the peak of mid Sea of Soul relam. Even if he had a secret art that could boost his physical defenses, his endurance should still be far below Liu Wujian’s. However, as the battle developed, Ye Chen’s endurance seemed above that of Liu Wujian. The latter seemed on the verge of collapsing while Ye Chen still seemed to stand tall.</p><p>“Even if I get a semi extreme grade armor, I won’t be a match for him.”</p><p>His sect had already expended a lot of manpower and resources to get him a semi extreme grade offensive artifact. Semi extreme grade armors were exceptionally rare. One might not be able to buy one even if they had the required spirit stones. Only an auction filled with countless treasures could provide a glimmer of hope. Thus, the armor on Chu Zhongtian’s body was still a peak high grade armor. If he had a semi extreme grade defensive armor, Gu Lie wouldn’t have been able to injure him.</p><p>However, even if he had a semi extreme grade armor and had a strength equivalent to Ye Chen, he didn’t have the confidence to exchange several hundred moves with the latter. Liu Wujian was a living example. Ye Chen’s cards were far beyond what appeared on the surface. If one thought that Ye Chen only had strength, one would be terribly mistaken. His terror originated from his all-round prowess. He did not have any weak points. If he had to attack, he had the offensive power for it; if he had to defend, he had the defense for it. On top of that, his recovery ability was far beyond the others.</p><p>The more Liu Wujian struck, the more he feared and despaired. He could tell that Ye Chen’s vigorous appearance was not for show by observing his spirit, Qi, and essence. In contrast, his three inner energies had been consumed a lot. His body was aching from head to toe, and even his bones were creaking.</p><p>‘Can’t go on like this…His Zhen Yuan is still at least at thirty percent. If he takes a Zhen Yuan restoring pill, it will rise to forty-fifty percent. I won’t be able to outlive him.’ Liu Wujian face sank as he pondered inwardly.</p><p>Unfortunately, Liu Wujian had still underestimated Ye Chen. Ye Chen had an entire bottle of semi extreme grade pills which could instantly recover his Zhen Yuan to hundred percent. Of course, one pill used would be one pill less for him to use. Ye Chen wouldn’t waste it on Liu Wujian. He also had the Dragon God Medal which had thirty percent excess Zhen Yuan stored, and could allow him to instantly recover to sixty percent. He basically had no fear of running out of Zhen Yuan.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>After one more round of exchange, Liu Wujian felt a sweetness rising in his throat. He forcibly pushed back the mouthful of blood that was about to leave his mouth.</p><p>‘Pull distance!’</p><p>He could not engage in another round of close combat. He was confident that if he did, he wouldn’t be able to stop the next mouthful of blood, and suffer intense injuries from the aftershocks.</p><p>Whizz!</p><p>His body made sharp turns as he retreated, and a clear image would be left behind at every turn. An instant after being formed, this image would be pierced through by a light beam, vanishing like smoke. Liu Wujian’s main body was always a hair’s breadth away from being hit.</p><p>“Eh’? What a mysterious body art!”</p><p>Ye Chen could tell that Liu Jian’s speed sharply increased at every turn, causing his attacks to hit the air. Moreover, it seemed completely random. However, even if he were to predict the other’s route of retreat and acceleration, he believed it wouldn’t be of any use. His attack speed was only a bit superior to the latter’s retreating speed. He couldn’t catch him unless he used the Defensive Sword Control Art.</p><p>“Let’s take a look at its mysteries first!”</p><p>Ye Chen actually had no intention of revealing the Sword Control Art before reaching the final moment. To this day, Liu Wujian was the only one able to compete him in all aspects at an even ground. Even Dugu Jue was unable to do so. Ye Chen had a premonition that the Liu Wujian likely had his ace as well that he wouldn’t easily reveal like himself.</p><p>And Ye Chen had guessed right. Liu Wujian still had his ace, which he was unwilling to reveal unless the moment was right. Firstly, there had never been an opponent who forced him to reveal it. Second, once the ace was revealed, it no longer remained an ace. One’s whole strength would be revealed for others. To be completely without any secret cards was not an outcome Liu Wujian wished to see.</p><p>However, the current situation didn’t allow him to keep his ace hidden. Ye Chen’s strength had exceeded his imagination. If the fight continued in the current manner, he was very likely to lose. He couldn’t bear to see himself losing against Ye Chen. Thus, he had to reveal his ace. There was simply no other choice for him.</p><p>Dozens of li afar, Liu Wujian’s figure stopped and stood steadily in the void at the edge of the storm. Seeing that Ye Chen was not chasing after him, he hurriedly took a few breaths, suppressing his soaring blood Qi and somewhat chaotic Zhen Yuan.</p><p>“Ye Chen, you can feel honored. You’re the first person in several years to force me to use my strongest card. Others simply aren’t worthy enough.” Liu Wujian uttered some astonishing words.</p><p>“What! He still has an ace up his sleeve? Does he even want us to live?”</p><p>“Too ridiculous! The battle just now shook the heaven and earth. His ace is surely going to be even more appalling. This time, Ye Chen is in trouble!”</p><p>When two individuals with equal strength couldn’t decide a winner and loser, they could only pit their strongest moves against each other and let them decide. It could be said that a martial artists’ s strongest move must not fail. This was also the reason a martial artist didn’t reveal their strongest move so easily. Once it was revealed, there would be no more secrets left.</p><p>‘Liu Wujian still has his ace, then what about Ye Chen? Will his ace be the Sword Control Art?’ Situ Hao looked toward Ye Chen. ‘Not too likely. Even if he had cultivated Sword Control Art to the third layer, it won’t be too powerful. The strength he has revealed is already beyond the Sword Control Art’s third layer by a lot, unless he cultivated to the legendary seventy two identical swords realm. The time he has had is too short. There is no way he could have done it in two years. In history, the legendary sword artists who attained this realm took decades to do so. Two years is simply impossible.’</p><p>He subconsciously thought that Ye Chen’s ace would be the Sword Control Art. But, when he thought about it, he felt that it wouldn’t be of much use in the current situation, since the strength the two had shown was simply too high for Sword Control Art to make a difference.</p><p>“You can also feel honored to persist to this moment. Now, I will use my ace against yours.”</p><p>The Liu Wujian’s current strength was naturally not enough for Ye Chen to reveal the Sword Control Art. However, once he revealed his ace, Ye Chen could only use that move. He didn’t think that the former wouldn’t threaten him. It could quite likely heavily injure him.</p><p>“Ye Chen also has an ace?” Everybody was stupefied, unable to even speak.</p><p>Regardless of whether Ye Chen won or lost, everybody had wholeheartedly accepted him. The strength he had revealed was absolutely that of the Sword Master level without a shred of pretense. One could say that there were many skeptics of Ye Chen’s title of Sword Master before. After all, witnessing with one’s own eyes was certainly different than being announced by the Knowledge Pavilion. However, at this moment, nobody had a shred of doubt. Instead, if anybody else raised his or her doubts, they would furiously retort.</p><p>If Ye Chen were not the continent’s Sword Master, nobody else was qualified.</p><p>Hou!</p><p>Dugu Jue took a deep breath, his taut nerves relaxing.</p><p>“As of now, I’m not their opponent. There is no need for a battle.”</p><p>When he didn’t know that the two still had aces, although Dugu Jue didn’t think that the chances of his victory were big, he still believed that he had the power to exchange blows.</p><p>“Ye Chen, don’t disappoint me.”</p><p>Between Liu Wujian and Ye Chen, Dugu Jue naturally favored Ye Chen. In any case, Ye Chen was True Spirit Continent’s Sword Master, whereas Liu Wujian came from West Ocean with the objective of trampling over True Spirit Continent’s geniuses.</p><p>Liu Wujain’s face changed, turning grave once again.</p><p>“Good! I didn’t expect that you would be like me, still holding your ace. However, once I use my secret sword, I can no longer control myself. If I end up killing you later, don’t blame for being merciless.”</p><p>Liu Wujian was not lying. He really couldn’t control his secret sword. Most importantly, Ye Chen was too strong. He feared that if he held back, he would be the one to lose.”</p><p>“Rest assured, my Sword Control Art can similarly kill you. Fight with everything you have!”</p><p>Ye Chen sheathed the Thunder Disaster Sword back and stood without holding any sword.</p><p>“It’s really the Sword Control Art?”</p><p>Situ Hao’s eyes opened wide as he unblinkingly stared Ye Chen. He wished to see how different Ye Chen’s Sword Control Art was compared to his.</p><p>The two Sword Masters stood across each other in the void. In their surroundings, storm continued to roar; the entire world seemed to have stopped for them.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Next, the two simultaneously charged at each other. Frightening gales erupted, which even the storm failed to suppress in.</p><p>“Secret Sword, Three Sky Sword Qi!”</p><p>“Sword Control Art, Three Identical Swords!”</p><p>Coincidence or not, the killer moves of both contained ‘three’. Liu Wujains Three Sky Sword Qi had three distinct colored sword Qi—green, azure, and red. Each one of them contained a different profound. The green colored sword Qi contained the wind profound, azure colored sword Qi contained the water profound, and red colored contained the blood profound. These three sword Qi couldn’t be looked down upon, because this art was not only a martial skill, but also a secret art. Usually, secret arts didn’t contain the pure profound, but if they did, their might would increase by several folds.</p><p>Three distinct sword Qi shot toward Ye Chen, carrying a frightening killing power. Meanwhile, the Golden Sword at his back instantly unsheathed and soared, transforming into two Zhen Yuan swords. Then, three Zhen Yuan swords and shot across toward the three sword Qi.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The green and red sword Qi exploded while the azure sword Qi in the middle encountered the original Golden Sword and disintegrated without even producing a sound.</p><p>“What, not good!”</p><p>Liu Wujian’s eyes bulged. He never thought that his Three Sky Sword Qi wouldn’t withstand Ye Chen’s Three Identical Sword for a moment. How could he not be appalled?</p><p>Without much thought, his next step was precisely to raise his defense with all his strength. He refused to believe that his two fold defense would be unable to withstand Ye Chen’s move which had already been quite weakened.</p><p>However, Liu Wujian’s two fold defense immediately crumbled. Upon piercing through the deep blue barrier generated by the semi extreme grade jewel, the Zhen Yuan swords dissipated. However, the might of the original Golden Sword was three times that of the Zhen Yuan swords.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Piercing the first layer, then the second layer, the original Golden Sword which had transformed into a golden ray flew straight toward Liu Wujain’s neck.</p><p>With his life hanging by a thread, Liu Wujian tilted his neck, causing the sword to streak past without touching it. However, in the next moment, a huge amount of blood gushed out. His main artery had been severed by the sword Qi, and blood was an obvious conclusion.</p><p>Ye Chen’s Sword Control Art had already transcended the realm of Sea of Soul.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
