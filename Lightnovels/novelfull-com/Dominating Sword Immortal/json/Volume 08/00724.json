Naturally, Ye Chen and the other four could not be like him and go through the thunder regions. Besides Qing Liu, the others would not be able to handle the power at all and they would only be shattered into ashes if they tried.</p><p>Along the edges of the region, the five flew rapidly.</p><p>…</p><p>This was a dark underworld. It was not high, only hundreds meters. With the top being tough black mood in strange shapes, the surface of the mud covered a layer of forbidden power that supported the whole underworld.</p><p>Pop!</p><p>…</p><p>Dozens of bubbles appeared out of nowhere in a marshland, bringing up grey muddy waves. Xia Houzun was also looking a bit roughed up. His qi and blood boiled in his veins.</p><p>“The attacking power was only slightly weaker than me.” Xia Houzun was very surprised. His eyes fixed on a massive figures down below him.</p><p>It was a human shaped creature made with grey colored mud. Just like this marshland, the human shaped monster was also covered in sticky mud water which continued dripping. Its eye balls were a pair of black marble. There were no mouth, no nose, nor ears. But it was three meters tall. And its limbs were thick.</p><p>“Take my axe attack!”</p><p>Lin Ruhai’s body flashed once, he suddenly arrived right next to the monster. He held his massive axe with both of his hands. He waved it down and the axe light itself was somehow extremely heavy.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The axe monster lost an arm.</p><p>Awooo!</p><p>The monster did not have a mouth but somehow its roar can still be heard. That thick and heavy right left was kicked out towards Lin Ruhai’s forehead.</p><p>Dang!</p><p>In that critical moment, Lin Ruhai blocked that massive axe in front of him. However, that attack was so powerful that his whole body flew into the sky.</p><p>“Void Shattering Finger!”</p><p>Xia Houzun had a sharp light flashed through his eyes as he pointed out a finger towards the monster’s chest.</p><p>Pop!</p><p>The gold finger power went through the chest of the monster and it shattered the black stones inside.</p><p>Splash!</p><p>The monster suddenly fell apart as if he lost all of its bones and merged with the marshland again. Meanwhile, a wave of powerful mud power and water power spread out, turned into nothingness.</p><p>“This marshland monster is probably made by the mud spirit and the water spirit. It must be way much more powerful than normal spirit creatures since it contained both the power of mud and water. Being able to control these two ultimate meanings would be its born ability. However, this marshland monster also has a weakness, which is that energy core in the middle of its body. Once shattering that, the monster would exist no more.”</p><p>It was the great master from the surreal heaven martial school, Tough Shield King who was known for his defense power. Amongst all of the demi king warriors, rarely anyone could have the kind of defense power that was even more powerful than his.</p><p>Lin Ruhai said while frowned, “One marshland monster is already this powerful. If with four or five more, I think only the Great Master you can handle them.”</p><p>His power was at the same level as Xia Houzun, he could take on about three to four marshland monster. With one more, he would not be able to handle anymore.</p><p>…</p><p>“It has been three days. I wonder if the others had found the entrance of the graveyard or not.”</p><p>The forbidden place was almost endless. Ye Chen and the group had spent three days but still no luck in finding the entrance.</p><p>“Let me see!”</p><p>Although Ye Chen did not plan to expose his soul eye, but he could use his soul power to put it in front of his eyes which could provide similar effect to one-tenth of his original soul eye power. He closed his eyes and when he reopened them, his pupils were completely white. Two silvery white light beams shoot out.</p><p>Fifty miles!</p><p>Five hundred miles!</p><p>Five thousand miles!</p><p>…</p><p>Thirty thousand miles!</p><p>With that layered shadows flashed before Ye Chen’s eyes, his eye sight looked like it had went through time. Even the spells could not block its ways.</p><p>“What kind of secret art is this?”</p><p>Qing Liu looked surprised.</p><p>His sight continued to move around. After a while, he stopped at a spot into the distance, he said, “Eighteen thousand miles away in the south-east direction, there is an entrance. Some people had entered!”</p><p>“An underground entrance? Let’s go check it out!”</p><p>Qing Liu said.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>That silver white light in his pupil disappeared, he closed his eyes, when he reopened it, that soul power had slightly been worn out a bit.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>The five of them shoot out into the distance in extreme speed.</p><p>In a far distance, there was an ancient entrance where a wide massive staircase continued. It seemed endless.</p><p>“It should be the entrance for the graveyard, let’s go down.”</p><p>Right then, dozens of people gathered in front of that entrance. Three of them being the demi king warriors and the rest of them being the top master level warriors. Before that, three to four warriors had entered.</p><p>Shoo! Shoo!</p><p>After making sure that those people who entered did not face any sudden danger. The remaining of them could not wait any longer, they flashed their bodies and flew down the stair. Soon, they all disappeared in the end of the staircases.</p><p>“They had entered. Let’s go.”</p><p>The remaining people all entered soon after that.</p><p>After half an hour, the five of them arrived here as well.</p><p>“This is it.”</p><p>Ye Chen glanced at the underground entrance, he said.</p><p>“This indeed should be it.” Qing Liu let out a long breath, she said with a big smile on her face.</p><p>“Let’s go in!”</p><p>Murong Qingchen flapped those black wings of hers.</p><p>“Yeah, let’s go.”</p><p>Qing Liu was the first one to move, Ye Chen and the other three followed behind her.</p><p>Waited until the five disappeared in the end of the staircases, a mountain rock suddenly moved. A human shadow appeared out of nowhere. It was indeed the Shadow King.</p><p>“You brat, this is all because of you. Now there is only me left. If you run into me alone, you will have a horrible ending to your life.”</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>The Shadow King also jumped in.</p><p>It was a dark underworld. Wherever they looked, the black mud was sharp like blades. It was only couple hundreds of meters high. It was a cliff that the five appeared in. looking from there downwards, everything they saw looked like a forest.</p><p>“Such a creepy feely place.”</p><p>Ye Chen took a deep breath. He could sense it that this place was so dangerous and was not as peaceful as it looked at all.</p><p>“No matter how creepy it might be, we have to make it through.”</p><p>Qing Liu also had the same feeling.</p><p>Ah!</p><p>Just as she finished her sentence, in that not far forest, a human cry was heard. Couple of human shadows shoot out from the forest.</p><p>All of the trees in here were massive which was not that much shorter than the cliff. So after these human shadows shoot out from the forest, they were already not that far away from the top of the roof where those spikey black mud were. It was also why they did not fly through the forest as well since they were worried that there would be traps up there as well.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
