The reason for such an outcome didn’t lay in strength but intellect.</p><p>The middle-aged demonic man lost more than half of his intellect after complete transformation and was single-mindedly focused on killing Ye Chen with complete disregard for his own life and death. A valiant and fearless style was indeed quite good, but one couldn’t blindly disregard death; that was simply asking for it.</p><p>After identifying the opponent’s weakness, Ye Chen merely forcefully traded one punch for a killing blow at the critical point of the battle. It was this simple.</p><p>“Intellect is something that a higher living creature can’t do without.” Ye Chen shook his head.</p><p>Of course, Ye Chen was not mocking the middle-aged demonic man, because he was even less of an opponent to Ye Chen before the demonic transformation.</p><p>“He’s dead!”</p><p>The White-robed woman’s pupils shrunk, filled with astonishment. Ye Chen’s strength was simply out of her imagination. Even if she searched the entire Silvermoon Whitefox clan, she wouldn’t find a single half step King that could contend with Ye Chen.</p><p>“Young miss, I’m afraid this kid is a disciple of some grand sect or clan and has come here to temper himself.” The old man beside the white-robed woman spoke.</p><p>The stronger a power, the more likely it was for them to raise a peerless disciple; the two were directly proportional. Powers fit to be called grand sects or clans were at least peak fifth grade or even fourth grade. As far as the old man concerned, Ye Chen’s background must be extremely frightening, not something an ordinary person could imagine.</p><p>“Elder Gu, I don’t care who he is. I only know that he saved all of us.” The white-robed woman said.</p><p>“That’s true, of course!” The old man called Elder Gu faintly smiled and curiously glanced Ye Chen, measuring him up.</p><p>The middle-aged man demonic man who was missing his head seemed quite dead. His neck was spurting fishy streams of blood while the flesh inside was wriggling like fleshy liquid snakes. Unfortunately, if one didn’t cultivate to the Flesh Derivation realm, they couldn’t escape death under such circumstances.</p><p>Putong!</p><p>After struggling for a few moments, the headless middle-aged demonic man fell down from the sky and sunk into the ocean.</p><p>In this battle, more than thirty demonic humans had all died.</p><p>“This humble woman is Yue Bingxin, a disciple of the Silvermoon Whitefox clan. Can I have young master’s name?” The white-robed woman, Yue Bingxin, took a deep breath and strode in the void, slowly reaching before Ye Chen.</p><p>“My humble self is Ye Chen.” Sheathing the Thunder Disaster Sword, Ye Chen looked at her and said.</p><p>“Your favor can’t be expressed in words. If young master doesn’t mind, you can come with lady Murong to my family as a guest.”</p><p>Ye Chen shook his head and said, “No need! I am not familiar with this place. If you tell me a bit about this place, it can be considered as repaying the favor.”</p><p>“Young master and lady don’t know this place?” Yue Bingxin asked suspiciously.</p><p>“We only heard you saying that place is the Chaotic Demonic Ocean. We don’t know anything specific.”</p><p>With a faint nod, Yue Bingxin said, “This place is indeed the Chaotic Demonic Ocean. The reason for its name is due to the demonic Qi released by some unknown region in the ocean bed, which transformed this ocean into a demonic ocean. There are many powers here, but the hegemony lays with the Demonic Humans. Reportedly, the Demonic Clan here migrated from somewhere else several hundred years ago. Before that, this was also a normal ocean, and there were no demonic humans either.” Yue Binxin complied and said.</p><p>Migrated several hundred years ago? Migrated from where? Could it be that that lace had a large number of demonic humans? Hearing her words, numerous questions popped in Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng’s head. However, from her tone, she didn’t seem to know about the origin of demonic humans.</p><p>“How is the strength of the Demonic Humans here?” Murong Qingcheng asked.</p><p>Yue Bingxin spoke honestly, “Terrifyingly strong! Chaotic Demonic Ocean has a total of ten great demonic human clans, each one of which is overseen by a King. The strongest clan has reportedly three Kings, and one of them is rumored to be Demonic Human Emperor?”</p><p>“Demonic Human Emperor? Really?” Murong Qingcheng was slightly astonished. True Spirit Continent had two Demonic Human Kings, but no Emperor. Who would have expected that the Chaotic Demonic Ocean would have one!</p><p>“This is only a rumor, but has fifty percent chance of being true. Otherwise, the fifth grade powers surrounding the Chaotic Demonic Ocean would not be so apprehensive. A hundred years ago, a world-shaking battle happened here. Its scale was so large that it ripped the peak sky and made the space chaotic. It should be the result of a titled Monarch confronting a Demonic Human Emperor.” Yue Bingxin spoke everything she knew.</p><p>“Perhaps this Chaotic Demonic Ocean is the headquarters of demonic humans in True Spirit World.” Ye Chen previously thought that demonic humans posed no threat, since their low numbers of Kings were a great failing of theirs. However, he didn’t think so anymore. Outside the True Spirit Continent, there was still this Chaotic Demonic Ocean.</p><p>“This place is not suitable to stay. Demonic Humans raise millions of four-winged Black Demonic Insects. Although these insects are not intelligent, they can transmit everything they see back. They are the eyes of demonic humans, which allows them to keep this place in check. If we’re discovered by the four-winged black demonic insects, we won’t escape even if we grow wings.” As if recalling something, Yue Bingxin hurriedly said.</p><p>Hearing her words, Ye Chen was inwardly astonished over the demonic humans’ grasp over the Chaotic Demonic Ocean. These four-winged black demonic insects were not something he was unfamiliar with. In his early years when he merely had the Condensing Reality cultivation base, he had run into four-winged black demonic insects reared by a subordinate of Daoist Corpse Ghost. The strength of these insects was only around grade three demonic beasts, but they were extremely terrifying when their numbers reached millions. Most importantly, they were not used for fighting, but for investigation.</p><p>“In that case, let’s leave this place first.” Ye Chen was not arrogant enough to challenge Demonic Humans, and faintly nodded toward Yue Bingxin.</p><p>Not long after Ye Chen and the rest had left, a sky-filling buzz could be heard in the distance. A few moments later, a huge black cloud could be seen flying across rapidly. This was naturally no Zhen Yuan black cloud, but numerous chopstick-shaped insects forming a dark shadow. At a glance, there numbers seemed in thousands.</p><p>These insects looked more or less the same as four-winged black demonic insects Ye Chen had seen before, only much smaller, only three inches long and as slender as hair. From their backs, four slender dark light wings grew out. Their head was round, densely covered with silver-colored compound eyes, reflecting the surrounding scenery without missing a single detail.</p><p>The black cloud made of the insects flitted across the sky above the ocean. Under the sunlight, a dark shadow in the ocean water accompanied the black cloud.</p><p>Splash!</p><p>A fifth grade demonic fish, considering the shadow to be a prey, suddenly dove up and opened its mouth filled with sharp teeth wide.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>The four-winged black demonic insects were quite disciplined. However, a few dozen at the rear couldn’t hold the temptation and left the formation, excitedly flapping toward the fifth grade fish. A black ray pierced through the fish, devouring it in an instant. The left behind shell sunk into the ocean.</p><p>Perfectly content, these insects let out a few squeaks and rejoined their ranks.</p><p>If Ye Chen had been here, he would have certainly been quite astonished. According to his impression, four-winged black winged black demonic insects only possessed a battle strength equivalent to that of grade three demonic beasts. Even dozens of them couldn’t instantly devour a fifth grade demonic fish. That only meant one thing—these four-winged black demonic insects were not third grade but fourth.</p><p>…</p><p>The Chaotic Demonic Ocean was vast and filled with countless islands. On an ordinary island, Yue Bingxin and her group were bidding farewell to Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>“Young master Ye, lady Murong, farewell! If you have time, please visit my clan. My Silvermoon Whitefox clan is fifty million li to the northwest on an island called Moonlight.” Yue Bingxin’s voice was clear and melodious.</p><p>“Alright! we’ll visit if we have time.” Ye Chen faintly nodded.</p><p>Yue Bingxin, “Then, we’ll take our leave.”</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Leading her other clan members, Yue Bingxin flew off.</p><p>Watching them leave, Ye Chen said to Murong Qingcheng, “This place is too close to the scene of the incident. It’s not very safe. Let’s look for another island and enter closed-door cultivation.”</p><p>They had gained a large amount of Zhen Yuan crystals and Demonic crystals. The two could prepare to strive toward half-step Life and Death King realm.</p><p>“En!” Murong Qingcheng’s body still had some remnant demonic power essence, so her chances of breaking through in a short while were quite high.</p><p>Flying on the flying puppet for three days and three nights straight, the two arrived on a desolate island filled with plants and overgrown weeds. Opening their sites, the two officially started their closed-door cultivation.</p><p>…</p><p>Half a month passed in a blink of an eye. The matter of them killing more than thirty demonic humans had made its way back long ago to the Demonic Human Clan, causing a moderate commotion.</p><p>In the most recent days, the four-winged black demonic insects flying over the ocean kept increasing. Mixed amongst them were some even smaller six-winged black demonic insects. Such a commotion naturally made all the martial artists inside Chaotic Demonic Ocean alarmed.</p><p>In the far southeast, a huge golden bird with a wingspan of over thirteen meters was flying toward the Chaotic Demonic Ocean while carrying a dozen people.</p><p>“Crown Prince, Chaotic Demonic Ocean is under the control of the Demonic Humans. If we enter, I’m afraid we’ll attract their attention.” The leader of this group was none other than Blackwater Alliance’s crown prince, Wang Taiyi. At this moment, the tall old man beside him spoke hesitatingly.</p><p>Wang Taiyi had his hands behind his back, overseeing the scenery, “Although the Demonic Human Clan is powerful, my Blackwater Alliance is not weak either. I’m sure they won’t deliberately target us, and will most likely give face to our Blackwater Alliance. As for that kid, no matter where he runs off to, I’ll drag him out. My Blackwater Alliance’s crystals are not for anyone to hog.”</p><p>Two million Zhen Yuan crystals was not a small amount. It should be known that although the Devouring Island was under the management of Blackwater Alliance, apart from their own use, they also had to hand over some share to some Kings. In this manner, their yearly reserve was no more than a million Zhen Yuan crystals. Ye Chen had snatched two years worth of Zhen Yuan crystals!</p><p>“The words of crown prince are reasonable. However, this place is without an end. Searching for him will not be easy. I’m worried that he’ll be captured by the Demonic Humans. These demonic humans have always been tyrannical, and they’ll probably snatch the crystals for themselves.” The tall old man expressed his concerns.</p><p>“Then hope they can live a bit longer. If caught by demonic humans, they are dead for sure.” Evidently, even Wang Taiyi was quite apprehensive of the Demonic Human Clan. This was a power that even the Blackwater Alliance couldn’t offend.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
