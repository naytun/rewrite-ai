On the second morning…</p><p>Thousands of people gathered at the center of the palace.</p><p>“The first mission is super easy…I will take it!”</p><p>“I will take it as well.”</p><p>“It all looks quite simple, no matter what you take is the same.”</p><p>Everyone realized that although the missions might look different, they all seemed quite simple. They could not understand why the Black Water alliance would still send out these simple missions while they could very well finish it themselves. Perhaps, they were simply trying to attract more people?</p><p>Of course, everyone was only thinking that. For them, the easier the mission, the faster they could finish it and go exchange for Zhen yuan crystals without a limit.</p><p>Rows of powerful warriors from the alliance stood right next to the billboard for missions. One of them came out and sneered, “Do not think that these missions are simple. The mission itself might look simple, but do not forget where you are.”</p><p>After being reminded, everyone suddenly woke up back to reality. They were in the land with the devouring island’s legend. Whoever had been devoured would not be able to make it back for sure. If they ran into it, then the mission would be deadly dangerous.</p><p>“Damn! This Devouring island is only a myth. But, if you run into it, then you will just have to accept your luck. If I were afraid of it, then I would not have come.”</p><p>“Yeah, who is afraid?”</p><p>Warriors here were all brave, and not many of them would be too scared to move forward.</p><p>“What should we take?” Ye Chen scanned through the mission board and asked Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>The latter thought about it and said, “Let’s take the second one. This mission is just asking us to find the ancient ruins shown on the map.”</p><p>“Alright, that one then! It has high rewards as well.”</p><p>All of the missions on the board came with a reward, but of course, it would not be something drastic. The second mission’s reward had been separated into three different levels. Astral reaching realm warriors would get one thousand top rank spirit stones, twenty thousand for Sea of souls realm warriors, and ten thousand for half step king warriors. If it were somewhere else, then it would be too low, since it would at least be fifty thousand even for normal master level warriors.</p><p>However, everyone here did not do the mission for the reward. It would be best if there were any, and it would not matter even if there was none. The black water alliance was actually giving out rewards, which made people like them even more.</p><p>However, all of these rewards were only given out after completing the missions.</p><p>“You guys chose the second mission as well I see. What a coincidence!”</p><p>Not far away, Dongfang Hao heard the two’s conversation and smiled.</p><p>Actually, he had not decided which mission to take yet, and was waiting for them to decide first. Otherwise, there was no chance for him to get in touch with them.</p><p>“Indeed, what a coincidence!” Ye Chen smiled lightly.</p><p>“Should we change one?” Murong Qingcheng frowned.</p><p>“No need. If we change it, then they will change as well. What a waste of time! I would like to see what exactly they are planning to do.” Ye Chen was not one to be scared. Since trouble had found him, then he knew that escaping would not be the best solution.</p><p>“We are indeed destined to be friends! Unfortunately, the mission is about to start. Otherwise, I would definitely ask you to drink.” Dongfang Hao said.</p><p>“Hehe…Hao rarely asks people to drink with him, you know?” Meng Xiaoling interrupted.</p><p>It was right then when the powerful warriors from the BlackWater alliance scattered and lined up with three of them as a group. The leader of the first group yelled, “Whoever takes on the first mission, gather here!”</p><p>“People doing the second mission, gather by me.”</p><p>“Do we need people to lead us?”</p><p>Dongfang Hao frowned, as he had only been here a couple of days earlier than Ye Chen.</p><p>There were ten missions in total, so a couple hundred warriors would share one mission on an average. In Ye Chen’s mission, there were about two hundred of them altogether, amongst which, the Astral Reaching Realm warriors alone were more than a hundred.</p><p>“Listen up! I am the guide of this mission, so listen to my command at all times. Whoever does not follow the rules or tries to create troubles. I will ask the person to leave immediately, and the person will be denied from any other mission. Our Black @ater alliance will not welcome such warriors.”</p><p>The leader of the second group was a gray haired man who had very high cultivation—he was a half step king warrior. The two warriors following right next to him was also top master level warriors. Only the Black Water alliance would have this powerful lineup for missions like this.</p><p>“Don’t worry! We will do whatever you ask. As long as you do not ask us to die, we will be fine.”</p><p>Right next to Ye Chen, an evil looking man said with a loud voice. He was also a half step king warrior. Only Dongfang Hao and him were half step king warriors in their group.</p><p>“Alright, I believe you will not do anything stupid as well!” The warrior with gray hair nodded.</p><p>“With everything said, let’s go! There is no time to waste.”</p><p>The man with gray hair did not say much more as he jumped into the air and flew into the distance immediately with the other two top master level warriors.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Ye Chen and the rest of them followed behind them.</p><p>…</p><p>Above the ocean five hundred thousand miles away from the crystal island, all two hundred-something warriors were present when the man with gray hair said, “The ancient ruins should be in this area. Everyone, please do not fall behind. Danger is everywhere inside the deep ocean.”</p><p>“As long as we do not run into an ocean beast king, we will be fine.” The evil warrior licked his lips.</p><p>Dongfang Hao had both his hands across in front of his chest as he said confidently, “Brother Ye, Miss Murong, let’s group up later! I will guarantee your safety.”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng said, “We will take care of ourselves.”</p><p>“Hehe! You never know what could happen.”</p><p>During the whole trip, Dongfang Hao kept trying to talk to Ye Chen, but he was just trying to talk to Murong Qingcheng through the other, since she did not really talk much. Although Murong Qingcheng seemed elegant and seemed quite friendly usually, Dongfang Hao somehow got the worst of it.</p><p>Dongfang Hao was almost wishing for some massive danger to appear right now so that he could show off his power.</p><p>Ye Chen saw right through him. If it were not for the fact that Dongfang Hao knew when to stop, he would not mind showing him what being truly powerful meant.</p><p>“Go down!”</p><p>The leading three warriors jumped into the ocean</p><p>Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!</p><p>In the next second, two hundred warriors jumped in as well. Soon, not a single human figure was seen at all above that ocean.</p><p>The reason that the deep sea was called the deep sea was not just because of how dangerous this place was, since there were all kinds of beasts here. Most importantly, the depth of the deep ocean would be way greater than the shallow ocean. Here, the ocean bed going down to two hundred thousand meters would be common. Normal Astral reaching realm warriors would struggle to dive down. Therefore, even for the Astral reaching realm warriors, they were all at least at the late realm.</p><p>After diving hundred thousand meters into the ocean, a lot of bright dots suddenly appeared around them, seeming to slowly gather over there.</p><p>The man with gray hair squinted his eyes, the voice spreading out after being pushed by the Zhen yuan, “Everyone, be careful! This is the deep sea single horned electric eel.”</p><p>The deep ocean electric eel contained a mighty thunder power. Once gathered into a huge group, it would be quite horrifying, and was still rather common in the deep ocean.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>With no need in command, everyone subconsciously attacked almost instantly. Countless sword qi, blade qi, and fist shadow had been thrown out toward the eel group.</p><p>Pop! Pap! Pop! Pap!</p><p>The eels that were attacked were even more furious, and that thunder power spread out, covering dozens of miles. But after battling for a while, the eels still ended up being weaker than Ye Chen and the group, so they scattered around.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>All of a sudden, a massive eel waved its tail and shot at them at a high speed. That thunder power it carried steamed up the ocean water completely, turning the area into a vacuum.</p><p>“Electric Eel King!”</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>This eel was obviously the leader of the pack and a half step ocean beast king. Not only did it have a massive body, its beast power went through the roof. That thunder power it carried was frightening; normal half step king warriors would run immediately upon encountering one of these, since they could not compete with it at all.</p><p>Among the half step beast kings, the electric eel king was indeed one of a kind. Its thunder power was not something others would dare to challenge.</p><p>The appearance of the electric eel king had made everyone more cautious, and the gray haired man did not say anything either. He held both of his arms in front of his chest as he looked over at the evil-looking man and Dongfang Hao, since besides him, those two were the only ones who were half step king warriors.</p><p>“I will take it.”</p><p>Dongfang Hao glanced at Murong Qingcheng as he walked out of the group.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>The evil looking man was happy that someone was taking on the trouble, that chuckle in his throat sounding so awful.</p><p>The electric eel king could sense the powerful qi coming from Dongfang Hao’s body and that its pupils started to shirk while a killing intent rumbled within.</p><p>“If it were the white bone shark king, I might take it seriously. But, only an electric eel king dares to block our way!”</p><p>Dongfang Hao waved his hand and a four to five inches long iron stick appeared in his hand. Although it was only a half step extreme rank weapon, it looked extremely heavy, as if it were made from a mountain.</p><p>Next, a dramatically loud sound was heard.</p><p>The electric eel king seemed to have been pissed off, considering the sky-full of thunder power attacking toward Dongfang Hao, who was not that far away. Facing that incoming attack, a lot of warriors’ faces went pale as they thought that they could not last even one breath worth of time under that thunder power.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Facing the thunder power, Dongfang Hao flashed his body once and jumped on the electric eel’s back. That mad thunder power did not even get close to him before being shattered completely by the iron stick in his hand.</p><p>Dongfang Hao was extremely fast to the point of being unreal, which made it extremely hard for the eel king to track him down. It could only roll around its body to increase the thunder attack’s range.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>The purple light flashed once in the scrambling ocean sea water, and then Dongfang Hao appeared out of nowhere.</p><p>“Ground Cracking!”</p><p>Holding the iron stick in his hand, Dongfang Hao threw out a stick attack which landed right onto the eel king’s head.</p><p>Woo!</p><p>The yellow light shone brightly, covering the eel king completely. In the next second, the eel king’s body shattered into pieces, yet not a single drop of blood dripped down the edges. All of them turned into bits of stones as if it were a broken stone statue.</p><p>“Interesting…Very powerful indeed!” The evil looking man was a bit surprised.</p><p>‘Amongst everyone here, he should be the most powerful.’ The man with gray hair thought to himself.</p><p>Meng Xiaoling said to Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng, “When it comes to eel kings like this, Hao has killed many of them by now. Even that extremely brutal white bone shark king might not be able to survive one attack of Hao’s. With him being here, we are very safe…No need to worry!”</p><p>“Indeed alright!” Ye Chen nodded slightly.</p><p>Pooh!</p><p>Meng Xiaoling almost laughed out loud. Ye Chen was only at peak level Late Sea of souls Realm, yet he somehow dared to talk down her boyfriend as being ‘alright’?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
