She could sense that the speed of the Explosive Fire King did not come from his powerful Zhen yuan, but more from the application of his profound. It was the ability to use 10% power to achieve 20%, or even 30% effect.</p><p>“Who are you?” The Explosive Fire king examined Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng, a vague hint of fire shining on his body.</p><p>“Are names really that important?”</p><p>Ye Chen was also studying him, his cultivation indeed that of a half step king warrior. But, compared to the Tough king, Explosive Fire King’s Zhen yuan was way richer and firmer, as if a volcano had been compressed inside his body. Even before he had arrived, he already gave people the feeling of suffocation. On first estimation, Ye Chen thought that his Zhen yuan quantity would at least be three times greater than the Tough King; if not judging on the purity, then it would be ten times more than Ye Chen.</p><p>“This person’s cultivation is already approaching the Thunder Spirit King. I wonder how powerful he really is.” Cultivation was only one side of the equation; if profound martial arts were not learned deeply enough, the real battling power would not be as great.</p><p>“I do not care who you are. But, since you are in the iron valley zone, then just stay…or perhaps you could also choose to become my followers.”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng was able to beat Iron Six with one attack, so she must be powerful. Although Ye Chen had not done anything yet, but with the Explosive fire king’s observation, it was not hard to see that Ye Chen was giving out a threat that was way much more intense than even Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>“Becoming your followers? That would depend on whether you have the power for it.” Murong Qingcheng said.</p><p>The Explosive Fire King said, “A couple of days ago, there was a young couple coming to challenge me as well, but now they are locked up inside the iron valley prison. That young man was indeed powerful, already at the top half step king warrior level at that young age. You think that you are even more powerful than him?”</p><p>“Try it and you will know.” Ye Chen already knew that this young couple was Dongfang Hao and Meng Xiaoling without him explaining further. Dongfang Hao was powerful, but since even he was not the Explosive fire king’s rightful opponent, then the latter would be indeed very powerful. But, this was perfectly fitting for Ye Chen. Those half step king warriors before were way too weak, and he had not even performed one-third of his true power.</p><p>“You seem very confident.” The Explosive Fire King was also trying to test him. Seeing that Ye Chen did not move at all, he mumbled to himself. He did not think that Ye Chen would have much battling power with his peak level Late Seas of Souls Realm cultivation.</p><p>“Boss, don’t underestimate him!” Iron Six had witnessed that battle a couple of days ago, and could tell that the Explosive Fire King had already used ninety percent of his power against Dongfang Hao, and that it was not an easy battle.</p><p>“Don’t worry!” Explosive Fire King waved his hand.</p><p>“I have got a limit to my patience. I gave them a chance a couple of days ago that I will only hold them in the prison for three months, but you guys will not be this lucky anymore. Otherwise, they would think that I am a good person after all.”</p><p>He was a bit frustrated. Dongfang Hao had only been beaten for a couple of days, and now there was Ye Chen. Perhaps all of them thought he was easy to bully! But, what he did not know was that Ye Chen had already swiped the whole No.3 island already, leaving only him behind.</p><p>Chin!</p><p>Ye Chen did not say another word and slowly pulled out his Thunder Disaster sword instead. Crystal clear electricity flashed once on the blade while the air was sliced open without a sound.</p><p>“Take this!” He held the sword high up with his right hand before throwing out a sword attack.</p><p>Woosh!</p><p>The dark gold colored pattern in the air tore apart the sky. The natural area between the two was like a peaceful lake, and Ye Chen’s attack was like a massive stone being thrown into it. A powerful pattern was brought out and thrown at the Explosive Fire King, who was not that far away.</p><p>“Not bad!” The Explosive Fire King would not dare to take it lightly as a massive dark red iron hammer appeared in his hand. An intense blaze appeared around that hammer as he threw an attack right at the center of the pattern.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>An almost endless range of mountains layered together in the iron valley zone, but once the two started battling, a huge number of them were shattered immediately as if they had experienced an earthquake.</p><p>“Perhaps this is the aggressive fire profound?”</p><p>When they first exchanged attacks, Ye Chen noticed that explosive fire king’s fire profound was very different from the others. If the normal fire profound was only fast and burning, then his fire profound was somehow explosive like thunder.</p><p>Ye Chen had guessed it right. The explosive fire king had indeed learned the explosive fire profound.</p><p>The explosive fire profound was also a kind of fire profound, but it just got rid of the weaker parts of the fire profound and enhanced the attacking power, which made it way more destructive than the normal one. Judging on attacking power, it indeed was way more powerful than the normal fire profound. Of course, it did not mean that it was better per se, since everything existed for a reason; the weaker part of the normal fire profound was not completely useless. In other words, there existed a positive and negative energy, which represented balance.</p><p>“Gold water infused profound and this sword intent?” Explosive fire king was also surprised. Ye Chen’s gold pattern included both the profound of gold and water. Moreover, the combination of the two profounds worked very well together in a positive cycle, since it was infused rather perfectly. But, Ye Chen’s sword intent was obviously more powerful, which made the explosive fire king realize that he could not take him lightly.</p><p>“Fire Ocean Nine Wave!”</p><p>The Explosive fire king comprehended the explosive fire profound, and loved to be the first to attack when he was battling with people. After using one attack to block out Ye Chen’s attack, he soon threw out an attack back. The dark red iron hammer vibrated a couple of times in midair, and dozens of fire waves layered over one another as they attacked toward Ye Chen.</p><p>Pop!</p><p>Pop!</p><p>Pop!</p><p>…</p><p>The space was twisting as the overlapping power was unbelievably powerful, making it seem like the space could not handle it anymore.</p><p>“Powerful!”</p><p>After Ye Chen threw out a sword attack, he had held up his Thunder Disaster sword once again. A black thunder ball appeared rapidly, soon expanding more and more. By the time Explosive fire king had thrown back an attack, the size of the thunder ball had reached the biggest ever, which was dozens of meters wide. It dimmed the entire sky dark; with a quick glance, it looked like a black sun, which was extremely horrifying.</p><p>“Go!” Right then, Ye Chen threw out a sword attack.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>The massive black thunder ball flew out quickly, breaking through the limitation of the space.</p><p>Dong!</p><p>In the next second, the black thunder ball clashed with the incoming fire waves, generating a loud noise. It was loud like two planets hitting together. Waves of space patterns spread out, looking spectacular.</p><p>“Thirteen level waves!”</p><p>The Explosive fire king’s power was real indeed. He tore through the blasting wave and shot out at Ye Chen while the iron hammer in his hand was waved in the air rapidly. With the power of the fire waves, his speed was getting faster and faster as he attacked toward Ye Chen.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Ye Chen did not change his expression while his Thunder disaster sword was waved casually in the air. A wave of dark red pattern was thrown out, blocking out the fire ocean attacks.</p><p>Within a blink of an eye, Ye Chen waved out thirteen sword attacks, which had all been targeted at him.</p><p>The Explosive fire king used his shockingly fast speed to attack Ye Chen as he surrounded him. It looked like a blacksmith beating on a very tough metal.</p><p>Unfortunately, Ye Chen was way too “tough”, and it was not an easy job for the Explosive fire king. No matter how much power he used, it could not break the other at all. It was just a waste of time and effort.</p><p>“Explosive fire vibration!”</p><p>Finally, the Explosive fire king performed his most powerful attack, throwing out a hammer attack.</p><p>As the hammer was thrown out, the space in front twisted drastically. The aggressive fire wave was like a light wave, vibrating madly. In the past, the Explosive fire king used this hammer to kill countless half step king warriors. Even half step king warriors at his level might have to try and avoid him.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The fire wave rushed out, and Ye Chen was blown away dozens of miles looking like a falling star.</p><p>“Huh! Under this hammer attack, you should be undergoing very severe internal wounds by now. And such wounds cannot be healed within a short period of time.” Explosive fire king was aware of the power of his attacks, and did not think Ye Chen could survive this unless he wore some kind of pseudo extreme rank armor. However, they were really rare to come across, and would not be something that everyone could have.</p><p>Ye Chen indeed had one, which was the one he got from iron hand king. But, he did not use it, since although the attacking power of the explosive fire king was indeed unbelievably powerful, it was still not enough to wound him yet. It was already rather impressive for it to blow him away for dozens of miles.</p><p>“Very powerful killing attacks.” Ye Chen stopped and smiled.</p><p>“You are not wounded!” The Explosive fire king frowned.</p><p>Ye Chen waved his arms and the dragon bone defensive layer disappeared from the surface of his skin, the muscles appearing slightly tender. During that last second, he did not perform his most powerful ace attack, but had already tried his best. Even so, the explosive fire vibration still wounded some of the minor tissues inside his body. However, he had trained the immortal body, which cured all of the damage within a second.</p><p>“This powerful! He was able to handle that explosive fire vibration from the leader and not be wounded!” Iron Six’s mouth was wide open, utterly shocked by what he just witnessed. The shocked ones also included the people that had been living in the area for a long time, since they had not seen anyone who had pushed Explosive fire king to this extent.</p><p>“I have seen your explosion. So right now, let’s see my Waning Moon attack!”</p><p>If it were not him wanting to learn about the Explosive fire king’s cultivation and the details of his own power, Ye Chen would not have stretched this fight this long. But now, it was time for it to come to an end.</p><p>“Bring it on!”</p><p>The Explosive fire king had been waiting and preparing as his eyes fixed on Ye Chen.</p><p>Ye Chen’s smile disappeared as his hand held his thunder disaster sword casually while throwing out an attack. It was so smooth that it looked like he was dancing.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The Explosive fire king’s eyes were opened wide. In his vision, the horizon between the sky and earth disappeared completely, a bent-moon-like black sword power slicing through the sky. The black sword power expanded till it could not be captured completely within his vision. It was the kind of feeling as if he was inside space watching a broken planet moving toward him rapidly. There just seemed like nothing he could do anymore.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The black sword power had messed with the Explosive fire king’s sense of time. He had just lifted up his hand before feeling his body being hit by the thunder attack. He was blown backward, and a mouthful of blood spilled everywhere in the air.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>This sword attack had not only blown him away, it had also shattered the mountains below him. All of the mountains had been pushed toward the side, the loud sounds just seeming like they would never cease.</p><p>He</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
