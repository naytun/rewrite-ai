Moreover, amongst the group, the yellow-faced big man and the middle-aged woman didn’t have any relationship with the other members of the group, not even common friends. Thus, they wouldn’t grieve their loss too much. They died, but the treasures still needed to be divided, and their deaths would allow everybody to have a bigger share. Thus, it caused somewhat of a complicated mood.</p><p>Clearing his throat, Jin Wanshuang said, “We’re nine left. Lady Murong will get twenty percent, and all the others will get ten percent. Let’s begin…Break the array and collect the spirit stones!”</p><p>As he spoke, he headed to the array.</p><p>Ha!</p><p>With his palm covered with a silvery glow, Jin Wanshuang punched straight at the void, causing a halo of light yellow to appear in the void amidst a crackling sound. This was the radiance of the Spirit Locking Array. Suffering Jin Wanshuang’s punch, the array’s radiance fluctuated indefinitely, dimming and intensifying alternatively.</p><p>Jin Wanshuang had ample experience in this aspect. Placing his palm on the array’s radiance, he swiped horizontally.</p><p>Blop!</p><p>The Spirit Locking Array was broken, and the spirit Qi inside spread out in every direction. In an instant, the entire palace was filled with a rich spirit Qi, making the air somewhat moist.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>The two brothers couldn’t help but smile. The previous battle allowed them to go crazy to their hearts’ content, and now there was a pile of riches waiting for them. This was what is called a happy life.</p><p>Following the brothers, the others revealed knowing smiles as well while the murderous aura remnants from the battle before disappeared like smoke. As for the yellow-faced man and the middle-aged woman, they had been forgotten in the back of their minds, At this moment, nobody recalled them. They were only concerned with how many upper grade stones they would get their hands on.</p><p>“Let’s begin the counting.” Jin Wanshuang nodded toward everybody.</p><p>Possessing an enormous soul power, their speed of counting spirit stones was exceptionally fast. In a little while, everybody had finished their part.</p><p>“I’ve eighty one million.”</p><p>“I’ve seventy five million.”</p><p>“EIghty four million.”</p><p>Apart from cold-faced youngster, the eight added their numbers, resulting in six hundred and forty eight million, one hundred million more than the initial estimate. It was a great haul without a doubt, Even if they didn’t obtain anything else further from the ruins, their trip would have been worth it.</p><p>Jin Wanshuang spoke with a smile, “Ten percent of six hundred and forty eight million is sixty four million eight hundred thousand, and lady Murong’s number will be double. Everyone can take their share. Don’t take more than your share…and of course, don’t take one stone less either.”</p><p>“It’s much more than I imagined.”</p><p>Ye Chen already had more than thirty million upper grade spirit stones. Adding sixty four million eight hundred thousand more, it would surpass hundred million. This was a huge amount of riches, far above most sixth grade sects. If not for the upper grade storage ring he’d gained from the storehouse of Blackwater Alliance in Devour Islands, he would not have been able to carry such an amount of spirit stones.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng’s share was the greatest. This was the gain from her dark force field, allowing her to be the only person to gain double the share.</p><p>Collecting the spirit stones, everybody’s gaze fell on the seven chests of energy crystals.</p><p>The distribution was relatively more complex. This was because energy crystals came in too many types, and everybody needed different ones. Energy crystals could also be used for cultivation like spirit stones. For example, if a martial artist cultivated fire attributed Zhen Yuan using fire energy crystals, his gains would be higher compared to cultivation using spirit stones of the same grade. Moreover, it could also increase the destructive power of the fire attributed Zhen Yuan. The fire type energies the crystals contained would be more than spirit stones.</p><p>“Let’s count the amount of energy crystals of each kind first.” Jin Wanshuang said with a frown.</p><p>Soon, the energy crystals were also accounted. Upper grade energy crystals made a total of seventy thousand, each chest having ten thousand each.</p><p>Metal type, eight thousand.</p><p>Wood type, ten thousand.</p><p>Water type, ten thousand,</p><p>Fire type, eleven thousand.</p><p>Earth type, thirteen thousand.</p><p>Wind type, seven thousand.</p><p>Thunder type, five thousand.</p><p>Light type, two thousand.</p><p>Dark type, two thousand.</p><p>The chests had energy crystals of all the nine major attributes. Of course, their quantities were according to their rarity, the rarest among which were, of course, light and dark types.</p><p>Jin Wanshuang said, “Seventy thousand energy crystals will be equally divided into nine parts, and everyone will get seven thousand seven hundred and seventy seven crystals. I cultivate metal Zhen Yuan. I see nobody cultivating metal type Zhen Yuan, so I’ll take all metal energy crystals for my share.”</p><p>“I want two thousand dark type. I don’t care about the others.” Murong Qinghcheng also proposed.</p><p>Ye Chen said, “I don’t care about the attributes.” His Zhen Yuan didn’t have any attribute, as it was pure Zhen Yuan.</p><p>In this manner, the distribution went quite smoothly. Amongst the nine, there were only a few who cultivated attributed Zhen Yuan, and there was no clash at all. Ye Chen gained a bit of different types crystals. Even if he could not use them in cultivation, they were considered a type of wealth.</p><p>After the distribution of the crystals, there was nothing left in the palace.</p><p>“Alright, the division is over…Let’s rest here for a while and treat our injuries.” Jin Wanshuang said.</p><p>Amongst the nine, the most injured was the cold-faced youngster, followed by Lin Yuxuan. Jin Wanshuang had also suffered minor injuries from his battle with Shi Shaobao. Although the remaining six didn’t suffer any injuries, they had spent quite a bit of Zhen Yuan. They were not pressed for time. Thus, there was no need to waste Zhen Yuan restoring pills. They could simply sit cross-legged and slowly restore their Zhen Yuan.</p><p>Half a day later, everybody had restored their bodies to peak condition, except for the cold-faced youngster. A day later, the last one also stopped healing his injuries. His injuries were not something that could be treated in a short while. However, with the help of precious medicinal pills, he was able to almost recover. Not willing to waste everybody’s time, he stopped treating his injuries.</p><p>“Let’s move!” Jin Wanshuang waved his hand, heading outside.</p><p>Outside the palace were two big pathways, one leading to right and the other to the left. The group chose the right and continued. Following the path, the group gradually arrived in the central region of the ruins. Layers upon layers of buildings could be seen amidst an eerie, sinister air.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng suddenly approached Ye Chen and softly whispered in his ear, “I saw that shadow again just now. It was no illusion.”</p><p>“Eh…” Ye Chen was convinced. The warm air entering his ear was completely ignored by him.</p><p>Walking for a few moments, he pondered and said, “Whatever happened here is not something good. The fall of True Water Palace is also most likely connected with this matter, which has also changed True Water Palace ruins into an ominous place.”</p><p>“Should we tell them?” Murong Qingcheng asked.</p><p>Ye Chen shook his head, “Even if we tell them, they probably won’t back out. After all, exploring ruins is a dangerous task in itself. How could a mere shadow scare them to leave? Informing them would only disrupt their state of mind.”</p><p>Upon using soul eyes, Ye Chen was also able to discover the indistinct shadow. However, he couldn’t locate its whereabouts normally. Murong Qingcheng was different, as she cultivated demonic power and had a body with perfect demonic blood vessels. She was extremely sensitive to some yin and dark things. She was the only one among the group to discover that the shadow was spying on them.</p><p>“Yeah, makes sense.” Murong Qingcheng nodded.</p><p>“Alright, don’t bother with the shadow anymore. Be it a human or a ghost, we’ll deal with it when it reveals itself.” Ye Chen was not too concerned about such evil entities. His destruction sword intent and immortal sword intent were not to be trifled with. Both specialized in restricting such evil entities.</p><p>After many twists and turns, the group passed through the unending rows of buildings and arrived before a grim and majestic looking huge pagoda. The base of the pagoda was ten times bigger than normal manors while its height was a staggering thousand meters, with thirty three floors. It was colossal entity.</p><p>This pagoda was the ruins’ tallest building. On the gate at the ground floor, three huge words were inscribed—Mysterious Yin Pagoda.</p><p>“Mysterious Yin Pagoda…Don’t tell me this ruin was the home of the Mysterious Yin King—a Life and Death King of True Water Palace in those times.” Jin Wanshuang speculated.</p><p>In its golden age, True Water Palace had a total of one titled monarch and thirteen kings. Its name was like the sun in the sky. The Life and Death Kings naturally had great authority in the palace. Them controlling their own faction was not surprising at all.</p><p>“Mysterious Yin King is already dead. This pagoda must have the wealth of his entire lifetime.” The elder of the two brothers heartily laughed.</p><p>The experienced old man said, “Mysterious Yin King or not, the Yin Qi of this pagoda is too heavy. It seems like the place with most Yin Qi throughout the whole ruins. It looks extremely ominous.”</p><p>“You can leave if you’re afraid. Whatever happens, this pagoda is a place I must enter.” Like his elder brother, Daer ba didn’t know the word fear.</p><p>“This old man has lived for a long time. How can I be afraid of death? I don’t wish to die in vain, that’s all.” The experienced old man didn’t lower himself to Daer Ba’s level.</p><p>Lin Yuxuan interrupted, “This pagoda is stacked with treasures. This is almost a certainty. I’ll go in for sure, or it will be the same as returning empty handed.”</p><p>Lin Yuxuan was also a person with quite a fortune. The reason he could reach this point was because he had obtained a lot of chances before, allowing him to gain many treasures. As far as he was concerned, this pagoda was a treasure house. As for the danger, it was only to be expected. If there was no danger, what would be the price of exploring a ruin?</p><p>“Ladies and gentlemen…” As the squad’s leader, Jin Wanshuang made his statement, “This pagoda is the most valuable place of this ruin. The reason we’re here is to obtain the treasures here. I agree to enter the pagoda. If someone is not willing, they can wait outside or go check out other areas by themselves.”</p><p>After Jin Wanshuang cleared his stance, everybody knew that it was not possible to leave. If they were to wait outside, what if they ran into other groups of people? As for checking out other regions, it was simply too dangerous to do so alone. Everybody could see that this place was no rainbow and sunshine.</p><p>Therefore, regardless of how dangerous pagoda could be, entering was inevitable. The rest would have to wait.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
