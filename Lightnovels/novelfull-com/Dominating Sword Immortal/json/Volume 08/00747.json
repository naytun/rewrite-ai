Across the mountains of swords, various kinds of sword Qi assaulted each other in the air, issuing metal clashing sounds.</p><p>Ye Chen walked in by himself, slowly heading deep into the sword mount.</p><p>‘What a powerful sword Qi!’</p><p>From outside, it was still hard to sense how powerful the sword Qi really was. But as he went deeper, more and more incorporeal sword Qi began slashing at Ye Chen, as if trying to slice him into thousands of pieces. The sword Qi accumulated by more than ten thousand swords was nothing to joke about.</p><p>Moreover, Ye Chen discovered that being surrounded by countless swords, his gaze and soul power had turned indistinct. Even with the vision of his eyes or perception of his soul power, he was unable to differentiate between the swords. He even felt that every sword was excellent.</p><p>“Seems like I can only rely on my sword intuition.” Ye Chen’s face remained unchanged as he headed deeper with firm steps, intending to feel the sword cries.</p><p>Within such a huge sword mound, almost no swords were identical. Not only were there all sorts of strange color, their shapes were all kinds of strange. Some swords were actually as long as a person, with thick and heavy bodies, weighing several thousand jins. Meanwhile, some swords were only an arm long and finger thick, looking more like a long dagger. Some swords had their edges like sawteeth, emitting a sinister Qi. Some had pitchfork-shaped fronts, seeming like snake tongues; some swords were extremely gorgeous, embedded with all kinds of gems and crystals from head to toe. There were also some that were completely plain, made from simply being pressed between two logs.</p><p>With so many swords of different shapes and auras, nobody could tell which ones were good and which ones were only for the sake of appearance.</p><p>‘Sky Scorpio Sword…Where is the Sky Scorpio Sword?’</p><p>Before Ye Chen and company entered, another half step King had already entered.</p><p>This half step King was a sword artist titled Metal Sword King, specializing in metal Zhen Yuan and metal profound martial skills. His sword techniques were sharp and dauntless, beautifully exhibiting the traits of metal profound. His fame was not small amongst the half step Kings.</p><p>If this sword mound had a extreme grade sword, it would be considered pretty good. In the sword mound of the Sky Scorpion King, the Sky Scorpio Sword would be the strongest. However, there were so many swords, and they all had spirituality. They were not releasing their aura; instead, they knew how to conceal, confusing people through thousands of sword Qi, making it extremely hard to find the Sky Scorpio Sword.</p><p>As far as the Metal Sword King was concerned, a semi extreme grade sword was only worth a few upper grade spirit stones, and didn’t have meaning. Therefore, his only objective was the Sky Scorpio Sword.</p><p>“I refuse to believe that I can’t find Sky Scorpio Sword.”</p><p>Metal Sword King was extremely confident. If he were not, he wouldn’t have become a half step King as a sword artist.</p><p>Suddenly a golden glint attracted his attention.</p><p>In the depression ahead, a dull gold colored sword was stuck. Its body was slender, and tis hilt had two words engraved on it—Golden Excellence. Although the sword had deliberately concealed its aura, the sharpness it exuded couldn’t be concealed. As long as one went near it, they could sense its seemingly soul-cutting sword Qi.</p><p>“Good sword…and a metal attributed sword on top.” Metal Sword King’s face lit up before he reached out with his hand.</p><p>His hand extended halfway when he began to hesitate. His target was the Sky Scorpio Sword, but this sword was clearly not the Sky Scorpio Sword. It was not a metal-attributed sword, and Sky Scorpion King himself was not a metal attributed demonic beast. Moreover, ‘Golden Excellence’ carved on its hilt ought to be the sword’s name.</p><p>“This sword is extraordinary, and might be an extreme grade treasure. I can’t leave it. In any case, I can continue to look for the Sky Scorpio Sword after getting this.”</p><p>With a slight hesitation, he grabbed the sword’s hilt and pulled the sword out.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>As the sword was released, a golden sword Qi shot up, spiraling in the sky above the sword mound. At the same time, hundreds of swords in the surroundings began to clank, as if paying respects to the sword in his hand. Seeing this scene, the Metal Sword King let out a sigh of relief and inserted his consciousness into the sword, determining its grade.</p><p>The higher the rank of a sword, the harder it was to determine its grade when its aura was concealed. It was not like low grade swords which could be determined by a mere touch.</p><p>After a while, an extremely disappointed expression appeared on Metal Sword King’s face. It was not an extreme grade sword, and not even a semi extreme grade one. It was merely an upper grade sword. For him, it was merely a piece of junk, completely worthless.</p><p>Depressed, Metal Sword King pulled out an ordinary sword beside him.</p><p>“How is this possible?”</p><p>He was astonished. The seemingly ordinary sword he’d pulled out suddenly blossomed with an ice-blue sword light, radiating a frightening sword Qi and causing all the swords in the surroundings to tremble.</p><p>“It’s semi extreme grade sword!”</p><p>Upon a careful inspection, Metal Sword King discovered that this was a semi extreme grade sword. Up to this moment, he’d considered it to be a common low grade sword, not paying it much attention.</p><p>“Could it be that flashier a sword is, the more the chances of it being low grade? And, the seemingly ordinary swords have more chances to turn out good, and even of the extreme grade?”</p><p>Concluding with this, Metal Sword King spirits rose to limits. He had finally found something like a rule.</p><p>..</p><p>“Swords have sword bone. The better the bone, the stronger the sword Qi.” Ye Chen shuttled in the sword ocean. Upon coming across swords with peculiar sword bones, he would casually feel it a little.</p><p>One would find that no two swords Ye Chen had touched had the same style. Some were flashy, showing off their radiance; some were calm and steady like water; while some were simple and unassuming. Unlike the Metal Sword King, who had only been paying attention to sword aura and had accidentally found out that the simple swords were better, Ye Chen was observing meticulously.</p><p>In Ye Chen’s view, powerful aura and simple appearance both were merely external appearances. Perhaps one might run into a good sword with luck, but in most cases, they would only be disappointed.</p><p>The stronger the sword was, the more spirituality it had. A sword with spirituality was no longer a dead object. It had a sword bone, like the humans had skeleton. Just like masters could spot good talents through the skeletons, a good sword would also have a good skeleton.</p><p>Of course, nothing was absolute. A sword with improper sword bone might be surprisingly good sword. But everybody had something they excelled at. One couldn’t be too insistent.</p><p>Along the way, Ye Chen also saw a few pseudo extreme grade swords, but he didn’t pull out a single one. Before finding the Sky Scorpio Sword, he wouldn’t pull any sword out. This was not him becoming aware of something, but was a kind of intuition. The swords here had experienced tens of thousands of years and had a strong spirituality, far beyond that of other same grade swords. At this moment, if he pulled out any other sword, it would be a kind of disgrace to the Sky Scorpio Sword, and he would very likely lose the chance to obtain it.</p><p>As for Qin Liu and the rest, they had no such apprehensions. If they saw something good, they simply pulled it out. However, after each of them had pulled out a few good ones, the sword Qi inside the mound suddenly began to target them. The sword Qi previously was naturally formed, but it was now divulged by countless swords, turning out ten times stronger than before. Even Qin Liu wasn’t faring well, and no longer pulled out a sword.</p><p>“Eh, so many swords with the same appearance?”</p><p>After walking for the time worth brewing a cup of tea, their vision suddenly blurred. A few dozens of meters ahead was a large expanse filled with same swords stuck in the ground. These swords were more than a meter long and had silver bodies with a hint of purple. Their hilts were deep black with the appearance of a scorpion. The tail of the scorpion was the tip of the hilt. Its two stingers were widely opened, forming the sword calyx and protecting the sword artist’s hands. In the middle of the calyx were two peanut-sized gems, looking like a scorpion’s eyes.</p><p>The purplish silver sword body extended out from the scorpion’s mouth, seeming exceptionally sharp. Merely its aura evoked a kind of unbearable feeling.</p><p>“Sky Scorpio Sword…It’s the Sky Scorpio Sword for sure! But, how come there are so many here?” Qin Liu’s breathing quickened and she began mumbling to herself.</p><p>“One is probably real and the rest fakes.”</p><p>Although Murong Qingcheng said so, when she employed her demonic eyes, she discovered that each and every one of them was completely identical. Even their auras couldn’t be told apart at all.</p><p>“There is only a single real one.” Ye Chen’s expression turned grave as he proceeded step by step.</p><p>“Haha…first come first served. All of these are mine! I’ll slowly figure out the real upon returning.” Just as Ye Chen was heading over, a figure appeared from another direction—it was the Metal Sword King. Seeing so many Sky Scorpion Swords, his face revealed an ecstatic expression. He waved his hand, condensing a huge hand and wishing to collect all the swords into his storage ring.</p><p>“Merely overestimating yourself.” Ye Chen didn’t stop him, but a sneer appeared on his face.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>The moment Ye Chen’s words sounded, several hundreds of Sky Scorpio Swords began clanking, and a purple colored sword Qi spiraled out, condensing into a huge purple astral sword and chopping through the Metal Sword King’s Zhen Yuan hand before proceeding to chop at Metal Sword King’s body.</p><p>“What!”</p><p>He was greatly astonished and raised his own sword to defend.</p><p>Kacha!</p><p>The sword in his hand was a pseudo extreme grade treasure named Absolute Metal Sword, and had accompanied him for several decades, drawing blood of countless experts. However, confronting this chop, it immediately snapped and shattered like a crystal. A frightening sword Qi passed through the shattered Absolute Metal Sword and battered the Metal Sword King’s Protective Zhen Yuan.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>Spurting off a huge mouthful of blood, the Metal Sword King was blasted off, knocking off countless swords in his wake. Swords flew everywhere chaotically, seeming like flying swords.</p><p>Qin Liu and the rest were astonished by this scene. Hundreds of Sky Scorpio Swords actually unleashed sword Qi on their own accord and struck a half step King, shattering his pseudo extreme grade sword in one strike. If not for this pseudo extreme grade sword, it might have directly killed the Metal Sword King.</p><p>“They really have the real Sky Scorpio Sword.”</p><p>Qin Liu was sure of her thinking. Even if all the swords were upper grade swords, they couldn’t have snapped a pseudo extreme grade treasure in one strike. If a pseudo extreme grade treasure was so easy to break, it wouldn’t be a pseudo extreme grade treasure. It should be known that even ordinary Kings couldn’t break a pseudo extreme grade treasure in one strike, unless this treasure didn’t have an owner.</p><p>“Damn it, how could this happen?”</p><p>Metal Sword King was collapsed on the floor, not even able to crawl. If one observed closely, it could be seen that the torn clothes on his chest had already crystallized, turning into kernels. Moreover, the skin on his chest had also partially crystallized, with numerous cracks on it.</p><p>The might of the purple astral sword was extremely frightening, and this was the might it had exhibited on its own accord, without any owner.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
