It’ll be a bit of pity though.”</p><p>Half step Kings had fourth step spirit bodies, which was the crux to becoming a Half step King. Ye Chen naturally didn’t have a fourth step body. Previously, he had raised his spirit body to the third step through the Dragon Blood Grass. For the time being, his spirit body could no longer increase past the mid third step. Since this fruit could raise half a step of Half step King’s spirit bodies, it could certainly upgrade his spirit body by one step or close to it.</p><p>However, the Sky Fiend Fire Spirit Fruit was an incredible serendipity. If he used it now, it would certainly be a bit of pity. If he used it when his spirit body had reached mid or peak of fourth step, he could instantly reach the fifth step. This would be much more worth than increasing his third step spirit body to the fourth step. Fifth step was, after all, the standard of Life and Death Kings. In reality, when one entered Life and Death realm, their spirit bodies remained at the fourth step. One had to painstakingly raise it to the fifth step, which could take decades or even a century.</p><p>Thinking for a bit, Ye Chen decided to wait for his cultivation to reach peak Sea of Soul realm. If his spirit body still remained at the third step, he would eat the fruit.</p><p>“Let’s go up!” Seeing that Ye Chen had obtained Sky Fiend Fire Spirit Fruit, Qin Liu said.</p><p>Gugugugu!</p><p>Amidst the numerous golden bubbles on the lava’s surface, the two’s figures appeared.</p><p>Ye Chen didn’t see any traces of Armored King and Punishment King. The remaining people were only half of the original. These people didn’t expect that the Sky Fiend Fire Spirit Fruit would ultimately fall in the hands of Ye Chen and Qin Liu. Their gazes flickered and bodies fidgeted.</p><p>“If you don’t wish to die, behave yourself.”</p><p>“Haha, you’ve got it wrong.”</p><p>Some recalled the gloomy expressions of Armored King and Punishment King and immediately figured out what had transpired. Since even Punishment King and Armored King had to eat a loss, they wouldn’t dare to act even if they had twice the courage.</p><p>“Let’s go!” Ye Chen didn’t put these people in the eyes and headed upwards along with Murong Qingcheng and the rest.</p><p>…</p><p>Before White Sheep King’s graveyard, Thunder Spirit King sat cross-legged, waiting patiently. Meanwhile, people behind him kept increasing steadily. About an hour later, Ye Chen’s group of five arrived.</p><p>“I’ll go open the door.” Ye Chen sized up Thunder Spirit King, Punishment King, and few others before heading towards the entrance.</p><p>“Third key is in this kid’s hands?”</p><p>The Punishment King’s brows creased. Adding Ye Chen, three of the four keys were with youngsters, and Ye Chen’s strength made him extremely apprehensive.</p><p>“Haha, good! We didn’t have to wait too long.” The Thunder Spirit King stood up.</p><p>Creak!</p><p>Following Ye Chen inserting the key, the graveyard opened with a bang. With a swoosh, Thunder Spirit King was the first to enter.</p><p>“White Sheep King was proficient in illusions. Be a bit careful!” Qin Liu walked over.</p><p>Ye Chen faintly nodded, “As long as we don’t separate, there shouldn’t be any problems.”</p><p>…</p><p>As QIn Liu said, White Sheep King’s graveyard was filled with illusion arrays. Some were to trap people, some were to induce hallucinations, and some were to misguide people.</p><p>Ye Chen and Qin Liu had the highest strength and also the strongest souls. Although the arrays impacted them, the effect was minute. Murong Qingcheng had perfect demonic blood vessels and a strong immunity against illusion arts, and thus, was similarly not affected. As for Yan Fengfeng and Sun Tianlang, they had to suffer some hardships. The former once got caught in an illusion and treated the latter beside her as an enemy. However, the latter, as a Half step King, easily restricted her.</p><p>…</p><p>“Finally, a space profound martial skill!” In the secret room, the Thunder Spirit King laughed heartily while holding a jade strip in his hand.</p><p>Although he was one of the strongest Half step Kings, there were a few who were able to contend against him. Who didn’t wish to raise their strength further? Not to mention, although the Half step King and Life and Death realm only seemed to be separated by a fine line, this fine line was actually an abyss, an abyss that couldn’t be crossed throughout one’s entire life if an appropriate opportunity didn’t present itself. Before this opportunity arrived, he must have sufficient preparations.</p><p>“With this profound martial skill, my stagnant strength will certainly progress again. I might even have the chance to attack the Life and Death realm. Seems like good old heavens are taking care of me.” After carefully collecting the jade script, Thunder Spirit King left the secret room in delight.</p><p>…</p><p>When Ye Chen’s group entered the White Sheep graveyard, more than a hundred people who entered after them arrived at Fire Bird Graveyard. Unfortunately for them, they didn’t obtain any treasures, and were instead hunted by the four dangerous creatures. Even their skeletons were not left behind.</p><p>Inside a passage, two Half step Kings were stuck in the air, unable to move. Trapping them was an incorporeal spider web which couldn’t be seen from naked eyes. Even if one projected their soul power and carefully probed, they would only discover a few traces. Who would believe that passages had spider webs? Just a bit of carelessness landed them in the web, robbing them of the control over their life and death.</p><p>“Hehe! Another two.”</p><p>Shadow Ghost Bat King didn’t say anything and simply bit off one of the Half step Kings’ necks, fiercely sucking off his blood essence. Meanwhile, the other Half step King became food for the two predators, left with only a dismembered corpse.</p><p>Licking its lips, Shadow Ghost Bat King threw the withered corpse and smiled sinisterly, “With our strength, we are unrivaled here. I hope we run into that person again.”</p><p>Shadow Ghost Bat King had an extremely high ego, and was thus abhorrent of the Thunder Spirit King, who had humiliated it. Recalling how it had to beg for forgiveness, it gnashed its teeth.</p><p>The Swamp King spoke with a muffled voice, “He is strong. We better not provoke him right now.”</p><p>Like the Shadow Ghost Bat King, he had also been miserably beaten by the Thunder Spirit King. With great difficulty, he had been able to regain his strength after killing numerous Half step Kings. Soon afterward, its strength had reached the peak and his battle power had entered the ranks of peak Half step Kings.</p><p>“I know what you’re saying. I can feel that my strength has again increased by a lot.”</p><p>Shadow Ghost Bat King was different from other creatures. Within a certain limit, as long as it had sufficient blood essence, it could continually raise its strength. Through the entire way, he had killed seven-eight Half step Kings, and his strength had even surpassed its prime. This was the source of its confidence.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Not willing to say more, Shadow Ghost Bat King led the way ahead.</p><p>…</p><p>In the White Sheep Graveyard, Ye Chen and the rest didn’t have any gains. Half a day later, the five arrived before Sky Scorpio King’s graveyard. However, the entrance of the graveyard was surprisingly already opened. They could only wonder if the fourth key was also with a youngster or not.</p><p>In the passage of Sky Scorpion King’s graveyard, Qin Liu said, “Sky Scorpion King was the strongest Fiend King amongst the four. He was a rare Demonic Beast Sword Artist, a demonic beast fond of using swords. His realm in sword arts was quite high, and during that time, some people even called him the Sky Scorpion Sword King.”</p><p>“He was fond of collecting swords, so who knows there might a sword mound in his graveyard.”</p><p>Sword mound meant swords’ burial mound. Some powerful Sword King’s at death’s door would build a sword mound apart from building their graveyard for their treasured swords.</p><p>“Sky Scorpio King was a sword artist?” Ye Chen felt strange.</p><p>Qin Liu nodded, “Right, his sword was quite famous back in the day, called the Sky Scorpio Sword. Apparently, he had forged it personally, using supreme grade materials, some of which don’t even exist in True Spirit Continent and can only be searched on the stars in the void, giving the sword unique energies only contained in celestial bodies. Thus, the killing power of the sword was amplified greatly, a lot stronger than ordinary extreme grade swords. I’m merely guessing…Perhaps he didn’t create a sword mound.”</p><p>“Hope that we’re lucky enough!”</p><p>The Battle King’s sword in Ye Chen’s storage ring was also an extreme grade sword, but it was badly damaged, and didn’t contain a trace of power. There was no sense in forging it again. However, it was still valuable. If Ye Chen wished to forge a sword, he could extract some useful materials from Battle King’s sword, which would save him a lot of pain.</p><p>The graveyard of Sky Scorpio was the largest amongst the four. Even after moving for half a day, the five didn’t reach its end.</p><p>“Eh? Sword Qi!” Walking at the front, Ye Chen’s brows creased as he carefully sensed.</p><p>“Is some sword artist battling?” Qin Liu asked.</p><p>Ye Chen shook his head, “This sword Qi is different from unleashed sword Qi. It’s a sword aura of various kinds!”</p><p>As a sword artist, Ye Chen was extremely sensitive towards sword Qi.</p><p>“Maybe there is a sword mound.” Qin Liu’s eyes shone with excitement.</p><p>“Follow me!” Feeling the subtle response from sword Qi, Ye Chen led the way.</p><p>After a few turns, the five unwittingly arrived before a huge stone gate. The gate was half-opened; countless types of sword Qi were leaking out, slicing through the air.</p><p>“It’s really a sword mound.” Qin Liu spoke confidently.</p><p>“Someone has already entered.” Ye Chen sized the half-opened stone door. His figure flickered, entering inside.</p><p>‘So many swords!”</p><p>As the five entered, they were immediately greeted by a stunning sight. Yan Fengfeng and Murong Qingcheng raised their heads with mouths hanging open. Wherever their gazes went, all they saw were swords. At every few steps there was a sword stuck in the ground, both high and low on the mound. As far as the eye could see, the entire sword mound seemed endless like an ocean of swords.</p><p>“This is a low grade sword!” Ye Chen picked off one sword on the outside and said.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng said strangely, “Going through tens of thousands of years, a low grade sword can’t exist. How come this sword doesn’t seem to have any damage at all?”</p><p>Ye Chen said, “If my guess is not wrong, with the passage of time, the sword in the mound have begun to respond to each other and can nourish each other with sword Qi. With thousands upon thousands of sword Qi lingering here, these swords have had the best nourishment. Therefore, even after tens of thousands of years, the swords here have sharpened even more instead of sustaining any damage.”</p><p>Yan Fengfeng said, “Who knows, this place might really have the Sky Scorpio Sword! Let’s take a look!”</p><p>“That doesn’t seem easy. These swords more or less have the same aura, as if they are concealing their auras.” Murong Qingcheng sized up her surroundings, unable to figure out the reason</p><p>Ye Chen faintly smiled, “You’re right! Swords have spirituality. They will not brazenly release their auras. Therefore, to look for a sword, one must have a complete understanding of the sword, or must have a pair of sharp eyes. Let me see if I can find the Sky Scorpio Sword amongst these tens of thousands of swords.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
