Unfortunately, it was still rather short.” Putting away his iron stick, Dongfang Hao looked like he still wanted to battle.</p><p>“This Dongfang Hao is indeed powerful.”</p><p>“I have seen a lot of Half step king warriors, but I have never met someone this powerful. The eel was one of a kind after all, and it was still beaten into bits and pieces.”</p><p>“Half step king warriors also can be separated into different levels. This Dongfang Hao should be at the top level, right?”</p><p>Seeing that Dongfang Hao had beaten the eel king with only one stick attack, everyone started discussing in low voices. A lot of young attractive-looking ladies had started looking at him differently as well.</p><p>“Alright, let’s move forward!” The man with gray hair took a couple of peeks at Dongfang Hao before speaking loudly. He then led the team to continue diving down. However, unlike before, the team was no longer in complete silence. A lot of people had started to chat; obviously, their topic would be mostly around Dongfang Hao, since he was so powerful and young.</p><p>In the team, Dongfang Hao said to Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng with a big smile, “This eel king is not that powerful, as it should not be older than three thousand years. Last time, I ran into a five thousand years one, and that took me a great effort to beat.”</p><p>The beasts typically had longer lifespans than human beings; some turtle beasts could even live up to thousands of years. However, human beings had their own advantages as well. Although humans had shorter lifespan—normal humans could only live up to one hundred years—the universe was fair after all, as it allowed the humans to have a very high comprehensive ability, which allowed them to learn difficult profounds within a very short period of time. Meanwhile, the beasts seemed slower in that domain, and might not be able to chase up humans’ speed even after hundreds of years. Therefore, it would be very important for beasts to be able to shapeshift. As long as they could form into human shape, then their comprehensive ability would be closer to humans. Some of the beasts managed to do so at earlier stages, and it would all be dependent on their own learning speed as well. For example, Yan Fengfeng figured out how to do it from a very young age.</p><p>Ye Chen smiled lightly but did not say anything.</p><p>The two of them both did not pick up the conversation, which had pissed off Dongfang Hao a little bit. He looked at Murong Qingchengg and said, “Miss Murong, that qi of yours does not look like Zhen yuan. I have my questions for a long time now, I wonder if miss could tell me?”</p><p>“No comments.” Murong Qingcheng said.</p><p>“Why not? We are friends now after all, right?” Meng Xiaolin helped Dongfang Hao, who looked at her with a big smile, waiting for her to answer.</p><p>Ye Chen’s expression cooled down, “Excuse me, but some of the things should not be asked.”</p><p>“You!”</p><p>Dongfang Hao thought that he was already being so well-mannered. But, Ye Chen’s attitude had pissed him off, since he obviously did not treat him as equal. If it were not the fact that Murong Qingcheng was still there, he would not have put up with it for sure. This peak level Late Sea of Souls realm warrior somehow dared to talk to him like that.</p><p>“How arrogant!” Meng Xiaoling did not like Ye Chen’s attitude as well, so she mumbled quietly.</p><p>“It seems like we do not have much in common, so there is really no point for us to be together this whole time.” Murong Qingcheng frowned and increased the speed between the two.</p><p>Ye Chen said then, “You two, if there is nothing else in the future, please do not disturb us. I am not a well-tempered person.”</p><p>Dongfang Hao had a very bad look on his face and a dead light in his eyes.</p><p>“I am so mad…These two are so rude!” Meng Xiaoling bit on her teeth.</p><p>“They will regret their decision.”</p><p>…</p><p>Everyone was diving at a very fast speed, and soon had reached one hundred and eighty thousand meters deep, where the water pressure was unbelievably high. It could definitely compress a huge piece of metal into ball shape. Normal Astral Reaching Realm warriors would have been crushed into a meatball as well here.</p><p>“We are almost at the ruins. Everyone, watch out!” The man with gray hair said from the front.</p><p>“Something is approaching! It is the deep ocean cannibal fish!”</p><p>Ye Chen had sensed it from far away. The cannibal fish here were very small, only middle finger long. But for the cannibal fish, the smaller the body, the more damage they could do. When millions of cannibal fishes swam toward one, it would be a catastrophic disaster.</p><p>Soon, the others sensed them coming as well and they all started to breath intensively, looking frightened.</p><p>“Huh! Without me, how are you going to make it through this?”</p><p>Dongfang Hao knew about the fish, which might not have very high battling power as an individual. Even a Clasping yuan realm warrior would be able to handle that. But, there were two interesting characteristics of the deep sea cannibal fish: they had very tough bodies, to the extent that Sea of souls realm warriors could not kill them with one attack, and they had extremely sharp teeth that they could use to bite through Sea of souls realm warriors’ protective Zhen yuan. Once there were a certain number of them, even Half step king warriors would face a decent threat.</p><p>“What a trouble!” The man with gray hair reached inside his storage ring, seeming to be searching for something.</p><p>The deep ocean cannibal fishes were very fast. After a couple of blinks, they were already right in front of the group. Meanwhile, the leading man threw out a green pellet. Beams of green qi spread out, but it was nowhere near as fast as the fish’s attacks.</p><p>Ah!</p><p>All of a sudden, more than ten astral reaching realm warriors were killed. Facing this kind of brutal and aggressive deep ocean cannibal fish, the astral reaching realm warriors’ protective Zhen yuan layer was thin like tofu.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ye Chen’s side was under attack as well.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Murong Qingcheng’s protective Zhen yuan layer was equivalent to a Half step king warrior’s, so the fishes were not able to break it in a short period of time, and were being bounced away.</p><p>Seeing this, Dongfang Hao was a bit surprised. He was planning to help her out before letting her know who would be the one in the end to help her. But, it was okay, he thought, as long as Murong Qingcheng could survive; it would not necessarily mean that Ye Chen could survive this as well. Even if he did not die in the end, he would be exhausted and become the laughing stock of the people.</p><p>Unfortunately, he had underestimated Ye Chen’s sword speed.</p><p>All of the deep ocean cannibal fishes that got close to Ye Chen were cut in halves. Within a second, at least hundreds of them had been killed, yet no one could see how he did it exactly.</p><p>“Uh? This fast sword speed!” Dongfang Hao admitted that he had underestimated him.</p><p>“Hao, he does not seem to be easy to mess with.” Meng Xiaoling was even more surprised than him. She had never seen anyone who moved a sword like this before.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, he said, “Having extremely fast sword speed would not mean much. I am a Half step king warrior, and he is only at peak level Late Astral Reaching realm. He is doomed to be my victim. No matter how fast his sword speed is, does he really think he can break though my defense? With only one attack of mine, I can split him into pieces.”</p><p>The green qi form the green pellets finally spread out. The fish smelled the qi started to jump at it like moth attracted to the fire.</p><p>Next, something horrifying happened. The other deep ocean cannibal fishes saw that the leading fish had swallowed the pellet, so they started to tear open the fish and devour each other.</p><p>Just like that, the quantity of the fishes started to decrease rapidly. In the end, there was only one fish swimming around with a massive stomach. And it was the end of it.</p><p>“What kind of pellet was that? So horrifying!” Everyone exchanged a look without know what else to say.</p><p>The man in gray hair said satisfyingly, “This is the cannibal fish killer that was created by our Black Water alliance. Do not underestimate it because there was only a tiny pellet. It cost about a million top rank spirit stones, and is enough to kill billions of cannibal fishes. Right now, I used it only due to the critical nature of the moment.”</p><p>The ingredients for making the pellet were very rare; each one of them was priceless basically. After extracting out the essence for the medicinal effect, it would take up to eighty-one days, also with a very high failure rate of around fifty percent.</p><p>“I wonder if your alliance would sell these top medicines?” Someone asked.</p><p>“As long as you have enough top rank soul stones, it is always negotiable.”</p><p>“Uh, I don’t know if you can afford it.”</p><p>One cannibal fish killing pellet would cost millions of top rank spirit stones, so some of the powerful Sea of Souls realm warriors might be able to afford it. But even half step king warriors might not want to spend all of their fortune on one pellet.</p><p>Although there was the pellet, but there were still quite a few causalities. Based on a rough estimation, at least forty to fifty Astral Reaching Realm warriors had been killed, along with dozens of Sea of souls realm warriors. Seeing that he had lost one-fourths of people instantly, the man with gray hair had a bad look on his face.</p><p>“Ye Chen, don’t you think it is quite strange that this Black Water alliance guy is so concerned about losing people? There is really no reason for that really.” Murong Qingcheng could spot that something was not right.</p><p>“Indeed a bit strange! Not only that, the rewards were quite a lot for the missions that they gave out.”</p><p>Ye Chen had already noticed that the crystal island might not be as it seemed on the surface. However, without proof, nothing was real.</p><p>“I guess we can only take it one step at a time then.” Murong Qingcheng nodded.</p><p>“Don’t worry! As long as it is not a Life and Death realm warrior, no matter how many opponents there are, we will be able to make it out.”</p><p>It was also another reason why Ye Chen did not reveal anything or say anything so far.</p><p>“We are here!”</p><p>After diving down for another couple of thousand meters, the man with gray hair let out a breath and said happily.</p><p>What revealed in front of everyone was a massive underground sea entrance covered in seaweeds. People would easily look past it if not observing closely.</p><p>“Let’s go in!” The man with gray hair flew in, leading everyone else.</p><p>“Let’s go.”</p><p>Someone frowned a bit, but still followed in.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>The evil looking man seemed to also have sensed that something was not right. So, he intentionally lowered his speed, so that the others would go in first.</p><p>“Be careful.”</p><p>Ye Chen held Murong Qingcheng’s hand as they disappeared into that pitch black entrance.</p><p>The entrance led to a very deep path as if it was a massive crack at the bottom of the ocean. No one knew where it was going to lead to. If it were not for so many of them, some of them would actually not dare to go in.</p><p>After about a cup of tea worth of time, everyone’s eyes brightened as they finally made it through the entrance and entered the insides of the undersea world.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
