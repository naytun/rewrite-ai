The martial artists there most valued the speed, cutting everything with one stroke, so that there was never a need for the second stroke. Although Bei Minghui’s strength could only rank him around the tenth spot, the speed was of his spear was at least in the top five. However, the speed of multicolor-robed woman’s attack was not inferior to him at all.</p><p>“Too powerful! That long whip moves like a ghost, seeming more like an extension of the</p><p>arm.”</p><p>“Even this woman is so powerful! Who knows what realm Liu Wujian’s strength is at!”</p><p>“Seems like Liu Wujian doesn’t intend to act directly. To challenge him, one must defeat this woman and that tyrannous looking young man.”</p><p>“Even Bei Minghui failed. To defeat this woman, one must be ranked above him at least.”</p><p>Everybody discussed with voices carrying a faint anxiety.</p><p>“I, Chu Zhongtian, will face you.”</p><p>On an even section beside Nine Dragon Lake, Chu Zhontian soared up and arrived before the multicolor-robed woman. A deep, tyrannous aura gushed out of his entire body, raising a whirlwind.</p><p>“Chu Zhongtian is out, but his ranking is lower than Bei Minghui. He is eighteenth while Bei Minghui is sixteenth. Can he really stand up to this woman?”</p><p>“Seems like you don’t understand Chu Zhongtian much. Although his strength is not above Bei Minghui’s, his Astral Body has an astonishing defense. If they fought a life and death, he is more than capable of coming out on top, and can even be ranked among the very top.”</p><p>The criterion of Masters Ranking was strength. In other words, one’s ranking would be directly related to one’s strength. However, sometimes, strength couldn’t account for everything. For example, a person with high survival skill could outlive one with higher strength. And Chu Zhongtian, without a doubt, was among the best in terms of defense, maybe even the actual best.</p><p>“You’re not my opponent.”</p><p>The multicolor-robed woman’s gaze was extremely piercing. She could infer from the aura on Chu Zhongtian’s body that his strength was below Bei Minghui’s. Since the latter was defeated by her, there was no point of fighting Chi Zhongtian. It would be merely a waste of time.”</p><p>“Whether I’m your opponent or not won’t be decided just because you said so.”</p><p>Chu Zhongtian’s expression was indifferent. His aura climbed, and a dark-red radiance flickered outside his body indefinitely, making his body seem to be coated in a shiny membrane.</p><p>“Eh!”</p><p>Liu Wujian was somewhat astonished. He said to multicolor-robed woman, “Nalan, be a bit careful! This person has the Astral Body, carrying a very high defense.”</p><p>“Astral Body?”</p><p>The multicolor-robed woman’s face changed before she said coldly, “So that’s the reason…Come then! Even if you have the Astral Body, you ‘ll be defeated all the same.”</p><p>“I hope you can say these words later too.”</p><p>Back in the day, Chu Zhongtian’s weapon was a dark-red rapier. Nowadays, he’d already changed his weapon to a half supreme grade artifact. It was a red and extremely thick rapier with silver linings. It was awarded to him by the sect, bought at an enormous price.</p><p>Chu Zhongtian poured his powerful Astral Yuan into the rapier in his hand and tiny red colored dust granules immediately appeared around it. They were flickering with an illusory light, seeming as if formed of a compressed diamond.</p><p>“Red Dust Fragmentation!”</p><p>With a flicker, Chu Zhongtian’s body turned into a dark-red streak of light and instantly arrived a few dozen steps before the opponent, chopping down.</p><p>“Bloodsucker Three Strikes!”</p><p>The multicolor-robed woman neither dodged nor retreated. She whipped out, immediately producing a three-headed red python. The head in the middle faced the incoming attack while the other two heads pincer-attacked Chu Zhongtian from the left and right. She seemed to be intending to dispatch him in one exchange.</p><p>Chu Zhongtian completely disregarded the two python heads attacking and him smashed his rapier on the middle head.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>The python exploded apart, turning into nothingness.</p><p>Paa! Paa!</p><p>IN the next moment, the two python heads struck on his Protective Astral Yuan. His Astral Yuan caved in by a lot, but stood firm. Ever since he had attained the mid Sea of Soul realm cultivation base, his Protective Astral Yuan hadn’t been breached for a long time. There were hardly any names among the Masters Ranking that could accomplish this feat.</p><p>“What! Such a strong defense!” The multicolor-robed woman’s face rapidly changed. In the end, she’d underestimated the toughness of Chu Zhongtian’s Astral Body.</p><p>“Cleaving Tyrant Dragon Rapier!”</p><p>Mid grade profound martial skills took a little longer to use, so Chu Zhongtian took hold of the rare opportunity and used a low grade profound martial skill. Only a flickering red light could be seen before a dark-red demonic dragon stream of Qi bombarded the body of the multicolor-robed woman.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>The woman retreated several steps, but was not injured. Low grade profound martial skills couldn’t threaten her. However, her blood and Qi were shaken a little.</p><p>“Fragmenting Rapier!”</p><p>Chu Zhongtian followed up with Fragmenting Rapier. His previously used Red Dust Fragmentation—a mid grade profound martial skill—was created based on this skill. However, the multicolor-robed woman was an inhabitant of West Ocean and had astonishing attacking speed. If one wished to seize the upper hand, one would have to suppress using one low grade profound martial skill after another, then slowly whittle her down.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The woman was forced to directly confront the move and pushed further back for dozens of steps.</p><p>Chu Zhontian was pressing forward step by step, using both the martial skills in rotation without any gap at all. His entire being seemed like a dark-red gale, unceasingly battering his opponent.</p><p>The spectators were astonished. They didn’t expect that the multicolor-robed woman who had just defeated Bei Minghui, would be suppressed to the extent that she wasn’t able to fight back at all.</p><p>“This guy’s defense is really freaky.”</p><p>Li Xiaoyun and Jing Aoxuan had also arrived, and the former spoke with a bitter smile.</p><p>“You’ve low grade profound martial skills, but I’ve mine as well.”</p><p>It was the first time the multicolor-robed woman was suppressed to the extent that she was unable to use mid grade profound martial skills. She was bit unresigned at only being able to use low grade profound martial skills.</p><p>“Wind Fire Whip!”</p><p>Numerous fiery whips erupted, and she was finally able to hold back Chu Zhongtian’s assault, slowly stabilizing the situation.</p><p>“Volcanic Rapier!”</p><p>However, right at this moment, Chu Zhongtian suddenly jumped several hundred meters back. Raising the rapier with both hands, he smashed it down. As if the heaven and earth split apart or a volcano had erupted, a boundless power instantly exploded out.</p><p>A mid grade fire-earth integrated profound martial skill, Volcanic Eruption.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The multicolor-robed woman raised her hands before her, condensing a red colored crystal shield.</p><p>Kacha!</p><p>The shield had barely formed when the volcano-like rapier energy smashed into it, creating cracks on it. Huge sparks flew about everywhere.</p><p>“Don’t be too pleased…Have my Fire Cloud Art!”</p><p>The multicolor-robed woman dispersed the fiery crystal shield as her body floated across weightlessly like a fire cloud. Her speed was extremely high, arriving at Chu Zhongtian’s top left. In the next moment, a whip phantom spiraled downwards, binding Chu Zhongtian’s body.</p><p>Creak Creak!</p><p>Several whip streaks appeared on his Protective Astral Yuan, and cracks formed and stretched.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>Eventually, the protective Astral Yuan shattered, and the whip phantom immediately coiled around his body.</p><p>“Break for me!”</p><p>Chu Zhongtian’s flesh bulged, and his body’s radiance flickered countless times within an instant. With a crumbling sound, the whip was torn apart into fragments, dissipating into nothingness.</p><p>“How can the Astral Body be so strong?”</p><p>The multicolor-robed woman almost despaired at this point. She’d never witnessed the Astral Body before and thought it was merely a bit stronger than other spirit bodies. However, Chu Zhongtian’s appearance let her know the power of the Astral Body. It was beyond her imagination, perhaps the most powerful constitution to this moment.</p><p>“Nalan, you can’t beat him…Let me!”</p><p>The majestic young man’s body flickered and arrived beside the multicolor-robed woman’s side.</p><p>“Elder brother Gu!” She was somewhat unresigned.</p><p>Liu Wujian said, “Nalan, come back!”</p><p>‘Yes…” Multicolor-robed woman had no choice but to obey.</p><p>“My name is Gu Lie, title Tyrant Blade Master. I’ll take care of you in three blades.” Gu Lie spoke in an extremely dull tone.</p><p>“Mad arrogance…” Chu Zhongtian relaxed his body and looked straight at Gu Lie.</p><p>“First blade.” However, the latter simply took out his blade and chopped.</p><p>Kacha!</p><p>Chu Zhongtian had absolutely no time to dodge. A huge crack appeared in his Protective Astral Yuan, and the blade light smashed into his body, causing his veins to bulge out.</p><p>“Too fast! I couldn’t even see how he struck.”</p><p>The spectators around were dumbstruck.</p><p>“Second blade.”</p><p>Gu Lie indifferently waved the blade for the second time.</p><p>Due to his body being severely shaken, Chu Zhongtian’s Protective Astral Yuan instantly shattered, and his thin inner armor caved in, causing his bones to hurt.</p><p>“Third blade.”</p><p>This time, Gu Lie’s arm swelled, and his blade waved in a full-moon trajectory. At the trajectory’s end was Chu Zhongtian.</p><p>Deng!</p><p>Chu Zhongtian eventually resisted; but, before he could let out a sigh of relief, a majestic power was transmitted to his body from the rapier. He couldn’t help but spurt out a mouthful of blood before shooting backward.</p><p>Three blades…Chu Zhongtian defeated!</p><p>“Don’t tell me that this guy is a supreme expert like Dugu Jue! Too frightening! Chu Zhongtian’s defense was like air…Such a frighteningly fast blade!”</p><p>“I’m feeling more and more that something bad is going to happen. The enemy this time is too strong, and he is not alone.”</p><p>Hearing the sounds of discussion around him, Liu Wujian smiled and said to himself, “Gu Lie’s tyrant blade makes even me apprehensive, and I’ve to use three hundred or more moves to defeat him. How could a person with mid Sea of Soul realm cultivation base resist him, even if he possesses the Astral Body?”</p><p>Including Bai Wuxue, the faces of numerous geniuses changed. Tyrant Blade, Gu Lie, was an absolutely dangerous figure. Amongst the Masters Ranking, Dugu Jie might be the only one capable of contending against him. As for who would win, they had no idea. After all, they didn’t know how much Dugu Jue had progressed.</p><p>Unfortunately, Dugu Jue had not arrived yet, and those who could fight against Gu Lie could be counted on one’s fingers. Moreover, the chances of winning were not good at all. After all, the highest ranked expert was Bai Wuxue at the fourth place. Fifth ranked Yan Fengfeng could fight as well, but others had simply no chance. However, if third ranked Tantai Mingyue appeared, she might have some chance. However, this woman appeared and disappeared like a ghost. She would not act that easily.</p><p>A few hundred li away, two figures were rushing over.</p><p>“What a tyrannous blade technique! No wonder Chu Zhongtian is not his opponent.” Ye Chen’s soul power had been watching everything happening in the sky above Nine Dragon Lake, making him somewhat amazed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
