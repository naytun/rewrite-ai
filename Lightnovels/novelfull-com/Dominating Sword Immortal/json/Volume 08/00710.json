In fact, the assistance they could offer was quite limited and much inferior to offensive and defensive artifacts. However, they were exceptionally rare, and thus, were exceptionally expensive. Moreover, one could only wear one set of defensive artifact and hold two offensive artifacts; any more would simply be wasteful. However, one could still wear jewels and improve their strength further; for example, necklace, arm rings, bracelets, earrings, and so on.</p><p>Without any exaggeration, if an ordinary Sea of Soul Master wore a complete set of defensive artifact, held an offensive artifact, and had his body covered in jewels, all of which were semi extreme grade, even two Ye Chen’s would not be able to do anything to them, unless they ran out of Zhen Yuan.</p><p>Of course, this was an impossible scenario. Even a fourth grade sect couldn’t find a complete set of semi extreme grade defensive artifacts, and a complete set of semi extreme grade jewels was even more difficult to find. Just producing two parts would be amazing in itself.</p><p>This kind of scenario could only happen if artifact refining techniques of early and mid ancient era hadn’t been lost.</p><p>Liu Wujian’s strength was monstrous in itself. Adding semi extreme grade necklace on top which boosted his defense further, Ye Chen would likely lose if things continued to play out as they were.</p><p>“This doesn’t look good. On top of the Sword Master level strength, he also has a semi extreme grade jewel! How can one even compare?’</p><p>“Although semi extreme grade jewel’s effect is not as good as an armor of the same grade, it’s still worth about sixty-seventy percent. Don’t tell me Ye Chen is really going to lose?”</p><p>Everybody revealed concerned expressions.</p><p>Contrary to others, the multicolor-robed woman rejoiced, “What is the continent’s Sword Master? He still has to make way for our West Ocean Sword Master!”</p><p>Bang Bang Bang!</p><p>Amidst the storm, the two had already exchanged more than a hundred moves, each of which contained all of their power. In an instant, the ground quaked and sky darkened.</p><p>“Ye Chen, why don’t you concede? You can’t beat me!”</p><p>Liu Wujian could clearly see the situation. In terms of defense, he had two layers; in terms of cultivation base, the thirty-two years old him was already at the peak of late Sea of Soul realm. Hence, his Zhen Yuan should be much richer than Ye Chen. Even if Ye Chen could withstand his repeated strikes, the latter’s Zhen Yuan would run out much faster.</p><p>“Battle is not over yet, so why would I give up?”</p><p>Liu Wujian had two layers of defense, but did Ye Chen not? Although the Dragon Bone Guard’s effect was inferior to a semi extreme grade jewel, it was not inconsequential. It was helping him dissolve many energy quakes, preventing many injuries.</p><p>“You’ll lose faith sooner or later.”</p><p>Liu Wujian secretly increased the power behind his attacks, Zhen Yuan pouring in like a river.</p><p>As the pressure on Ye Chen increased, he frowned inwardly. He naturally couldn’t go on at this pace. For better or worse, Liu Wujian had a cultivation base of late Sea of Soul realm, and his Zhen Yuan was twenty to thirty percent richer than his. Even if the latter’s consumption was bigger, the latter would be the winner.</p><p>“Blood Severing Ghost Finger is more or less at twenty percent completion. First sever a portion of his blood Qi before anything else.”</p><p>Issuing a light beam with the Thunder Disaster Sword in his right hand, Ye Chen pointed with his left hand toward Liu Wujian and slashed, like a judge’s quill deciding one’s life and death. It carried a mysterious ghastly power, evoking an indescribable horror and anxiety.</p><p>Thinking Ye Chen was attacking him with finger arts, Liu Wujian smiled disdainfully, not taking any preventive measures. With two layers of defense, he didn’t need to worry at all.</p><p>However, once Ye Chen’s finger slashed, his face changed.</p><p>The blood Qi inside his body suddenly lost a small chunk as if it had evaporated away. Although it was only a small portion, about a thousandth of the total and wouldn’t affect him much, if one suddenly discovered that they had lost a chunk of blood Qi for no reason, they would feel uneasy.</p><p>“What kind of finger art is this?” Liu Wujian inwardly raised his guard.</p><p>“Result is good…This time, it’s for real.”</p><p>Ye Chen had only been testing, and hadn’t used the technique with all his might.</p><p>“Sever!”</p><p>The Zhen Yuan condensed on his finger before he slashed again. Different from the last time, as Ye Chen slashed this time, a withered white colored palm image appeared on Liu Wujian’s Protective Zhen Yuan. The palm image reached inside Liu Wujian’s body and grabbed a bloody beam, then resolutely clenched it. The bloody beam dispersed, turning into nothingness.</p><p>“You dare to sever my blood Qi!”</p><p>Liu Wujian roared, feeling both astonished and furious. His blood Qi had suddenly halved. What kind of a concept was this? Only under optimal conditions would one be able to exhibit their peak battle power. Having his blood Qi halved, his might had instantly dropped a level.</p><p>The spectators exchanged glances. They could also see that Ye Chen had used a frightening finger art which forcibly severed off a part of Liu Wujian’s blood Qi. It was a peculiar attack.</p><p>“Truly unimaginably!”</p><p>Not to mention the furious Liu Wujian, even Ye Chen himself didn’t expect that a twenty percent completion Blood Severing Ghost Finger could exhibit such power. It had instantly severed half of the opponent’s blood Qi. Moreover, that withered white palm was brimming with death Qi and seemed utterly incompatible with this world, looking extremely sinister and ghastly.</p><p>Of course, the target of Blood Severing Ghost Finger also mattered. If the target was a high grade body-refiner like Wei Longtao, severing a thousandth of his blood Qi would be considered a good result. It was not only because such experts had a lot of blood Qi, but their blood Qi was also highly condensed, and it was quite difficult for the Blood Severing Ghost Finger to sever a large amount of it, just like how a small knife could only cut off a small chunk from an iron plate.</p><p>“Continue severing for me!”</p><p>Having the sweet taste of its effects, Ye Chen gladly accumulated a little strength and slashed again. The white withered palm again appeared on Liu Wujian’s Protective Zhen Yuan.</p><p>“Get the hell off!”</p><p>Liu Wujian’s sword intent exploded, battering on the withered palm in waves.</p><p>The palm could overlook Zhen Yuan, but couldn’t overlook sword intent. Its speed suddenly reduced by a lot, but it still tore off a small chunk of blood Qi before crumbling under the battering of sword intent. The severed blood Qi once again disappeared under the eyes of Liu Wujian.</p><p>But this time, it was only a few thousandth of the total blood Qi, vastly different from the last time.</p><p>“So, it turns out that Blood Severing Ghost Finger also consumes soul power.”</p><p>Ye Chen suddenly discovered that he was missing a portion of his soul power. He never realized that. It seemed as if this soul power had infused into the Blood Severing Ghost Finger through a method he couldn’t understand and miraculously severed the opponent’s blood Qi.</p><p>“Ye Chen, you will pay for this!”</p><p>Losing more than half of his blood Qi, Liu Wujian was furious. His left hand clenched into fist and it shone with a golden radiance as it smashed towards Ye Chen.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>This fist made the storm show signs of collapsing.</p><p>“It’s a secret art!”</p><p>Ye Chen could tell at a glance that this fist art was not a profound battle skill, but a secret art that compressed fist power by several folds.</p><p>“Void Shattering Finger!”</p><p>His left hand’s sword fingers retreated back and his index finger stretched out, pointing toward the golden fist. It was the Void Shattering Finger Ye Chen rarely used.</p><p>However, this time’s Void Shattering Finger had already reached completion. Moreover, due to being the third style, its might was much higher than Chu Zhongtian’s second style. A cyan colored finger energy instantly collided with golden fist energy, totally disregarding the spatial distance.</p><p>Blop!</p><p>In the initial exchange, the golden fist energy seemed to hold the upper hand. However, Void Shattering Finger was a space profound martial skill, and was good at assimilating energies. Even though it was being suppressed, it kept on assimilating the golden fist’s energy. In this manner, both energies weakened and took each other out.</p><p>At this point in the battle, both sides had revealed almost all their cards, but were still not able to do anything to their opponents. Although Ye Chen’s Blood Ghost Severing Ghost Finger seemed quite powerful, it consumed a lot of soul power, and couldn’t be used frequently. Moreover, Liu Wujian’s fifth step Highsky Sword Intent meant that if the latter was on guard, its effect wouldn’t be much. Only if Ye Chen could further improve in its cultivation would it bear any result.</p><p>Knowing their methods were not being effective, the two continued to attack each other with high intensity, taking the battle to the climax. The raging hurricanes whirled the lake’s water and everything in it into the sky, creating a downpour in the Nine Dragon Mountain.</p><p>“I refuse to believe you can keep withstanding my moves!”</p><p>Gnashing his teeth, Liu Wujian rushed at Ye Chen, reducing the distance between them, and thus, increasing the effects of his attacks. Unexpectedly, Ye Chen didn’t try to regain the distance. Instead, he welcomed the latter with unceasing sword strikes.</p><p>“Close body combat…I’m afraid we’ll have our winner soon.” Everybody held their breaths.</p><p>Bang Bang Bang Bang!</p><p>Pulling the distance closer increased the efficacy of their attacks by not just but a little bit, but by several folds. Both of their defenses were unable to keep up, and both felt their blood Qi rampaging.</p><p>“Lose for me!”</p><p>Liu Wujian chopped down with all his might, and a blood colored ocean and countless blood colored sword images rained down on Ye Chen.</p><p>Although Ye Chen’s Golden Hurricane was not as majestic as the Blood Ocean, its cohesiveness was far stronger. At a close distance, the ripple light beam immediately pierced through the blood ocean and struck Liu Wujian’s Protective Zhen Yuan. However, from another angle, Ye Chen himself was battered by countless blood sword phantoms.</p><p>With muffled groans, both flew back several li back.</p><p>“Go again!”</p><p>The two were not apprehensive of each other at all. Rubbing their bodies, they charged at each other again. They disregarded defending completely, and were only concerned with landing hits on the other’s body. As for taking hits themselves, they seemed to not care at all.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>In a blink of an eye, Liu Wujian took three strikes while Ye Chen took two strikes.</p><p>Liu Wujain let out a cloud of fishy breath while Ye Chen’s face paled a lot. Although Liu Wujian’s defense was high, he couldn’t withstand countless strikes. He was instead amazed that Ye Chen managed to withstand his strikes. However, when he saw a white-colored bone guard on Ye Chen’s palm, he immediately understood that the latter must have employed a secret art which boosted his defense.</p><p>“Let me see how long you can hold on.”</p><p>However, as time went on, he discovered to his horror that at this point, he was beginning to lose it whereas Ye Chen still seemed mighty and full of vigor. It seemed as if the accumulation of countless minor wounds didn’t affect him at all, and had been healed long ago.</p><p>“How is that possible!” Liu Wujian was simply unable to understand.</p><p>As for the spectators, they had turned long since numb.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
