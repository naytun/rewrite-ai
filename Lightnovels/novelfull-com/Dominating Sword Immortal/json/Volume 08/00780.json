Although the beast had hidden itself extremely well, almost merging with the ocean, it couldn’t escape his soul power. The reason he didn’t take any action was because this was the territory of aquatic demonic beasts. He could do with less trouble.</p><p>“This move is already sixty-seventy percent complete. I guess it can be named now.”</p><p>Recalling the scene just now, Ye Chen muttered to himself, “Let’s call it…Bewitching Mirror Destruction!”</p><p>With the wave of his sword, the summit seemed to be shining in a mirror before shattering. The entire process seemed illusory, thus the term bewitching mirror, which seemed poetic and illusory. The term ‘Destruction’ once again made people’s minds return to a world of destruction and cruelty. No matter how beautiful a mirror was, it would shatter. The sword was used for slaughter, and thus, a sword move would only be created for killing.</p><p>“Bewitching Mirror Destruction!”</p><p>“Bewitching Mirror Destruction!”</p><p>Ye Chen repeated the name twice and then suddenly smiled, “Space profound has many applications, and this move merely encompasses one of them. Now, I can create second move, third move, and more. Space profound will become my strongest sword art.”</p><p>The principle behind Bewitching Mirror Destruction was quite simple. The sword Qi would make spatial power flow out and lock on the target. Then, this spatial power would condense, freezing the opponent, and explode along with the opponent under the effect of sword Qi.</p><p>The principle sounded simple, but it was not that simply to apply. First of all, one space’s profound should be refined and closely integrated with the sword arts. There should be no flaws; otherwise, the opponent could make use of this flaw and escape, breaking the move.</p><p>Two more weeks passed by, and Ye Chen became more and more proficient in the use of Bewitching Mirrored Destruction, taking it to seventy-eighty percent completion. He could feel that as he developed this move, his space profound—which had recently stagnated—steadily improved. The improved space profound allowed him to be more proficient in using the move. The two complemented each other, making his progress fly.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>One day, a powerful demonic power ripple spread out of the summit in the western region of the mountain range, engulfing everything around.</p><p>“Murong is coming out!” Ye Chen looked over.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng had consolidated her cultivation base a week ago. During this week, she used demonic crystals to improve her cultivation base. Demonic crystals were indeed deserving of their reputation, as she was able to increase her cultivation base by two folds. The demonic power ripple originated from her at this moment was a lot stronger compared to when she had just entered the half-step Demonic King realm, and it directly shook the space.</p><p>Extending her right, she gave a push.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>Peerless demonic power gushed out. Several hundred meters thick summit walls were pierced through as if they were weaker than tofu.</p><p>Her body flickered and changed into a black-colored rainbow, flying out of the summit.</p><p>“Seems like your cultivation base has increased by around two folds.” Ye Chen felt the aura of demonic power from her body and speculated.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng said, “My cultivation base couldn’t have increased so sharply before. But, after I entered half-step King realm, the demonic power essence in my body began to dissolve by itself and merge with my demonic power.”</p><p>“Demonic Power Essence is no small matter. For you to obtain it is your own fortune.” Thinking back, Ye Chen could not help but sigh with emotion at the demonic power essence’s effect on Murong Qingcheng. If not for this demonic power essence, it would have been extremely hard for her to advance in this world with such sparse demonic power. Others’ two realm advancement would have been one for her. It could even be said that this demonic power essence made her what she was currently.</p><p>“This demonic power essence still has some mysteries.” Murong Qingcheng extended her right hand. A black light flickered, and a black crystal the size of date-seed arose from within.</p><p>Ye Chen exclaimed, “You can already control the demonic power essence!”</p><p>“Yeah, but it can’t separate out of the body or it will scatter away.” Murong Qingcheng faintly nodded and continued, “I can feel that there are some things imprinted within, such as demonic race’s martial skills, etc. In these last few days, some fragments of information have appeared in my brain.”</p><p>“The Demonic Beast King had been imprisoned in Planar Battlefield for countless years. The loss of his demonic power must have been severe, and despite that, Beast Tamer King, Thunder King, and Soul Flicker King—three great kings—were almost killed by him. He was probably a titled monarch at his peak. Therefore, the demonic power essence containing some mysteries is not impossible.”</p><p>Ye Chen observed the demonic power essence and discovered that the demonic power essence faintly resembled demonic power crystals, but was not completely similar to it. It contained numerous complex veined lines, which were not dead, but slowly moving and transforming.</p><p>“My space profound sword art is seventy-eighty percent completed, exceeding Waning Moon. Your cultivation base has also consolidated. I guess we can set off.” Ye Chen revealed his intentions to leave.</p><p>“Let’s leave!”</p><p>Staying at the same place of so many days, they had to leave, and Murong Qingcheng didn’t think otherwise either.</p><p>…</p><p>The ocean was boundless, seeming endless. Flying for seven days and seven nights, the two covered ten million li and arrived at a new region. On the map, this region was marked as Richlight Oceanspan. The reason for its name was because it contained numerous ruins. The explorers occasionally found treasures in some of these ruins that ordinary people could only yearn in their dreams. Thus, as time passed, this region was named Righlight Oceanspan.</p><p>Spending a lot of spirit stones, Ye Chen had purchased an ocean map and decided to try their luck. The Sky Scorpio Sword was a black hole for Zhen Yuan, and Ye Chen wasn’t able to truly use it, while Thunder Disaster Sword was a half-step extreme grade sword which had begun to fall behind. He needed a pseudo extreme grade artifact, or perhaps an exceptionally powerful half-step extreme grade one.</p><p>Moreover, Murong Qingcheng also didn’t have a pair of treasured gloves.</p><p>“Seems like Richlight Oceanspan is very prosperous and frequently holds auctions. Perhaps we won’t even need to explore and find some stuff there.” Murong Qingcheng spoke with a smile.</p><p>“I hope so.” Ye Chen faintly nodded.</p><p>Foursquare Island was a reputed island on Richlight Oceanspan. The island was vast and stood tall, looking like a square from every direction; thus, its name.</p><p>There were numerous forces stationed on the island. Some represented human sects, some represented aquatic demonic beast forces, and some were even a coalition of variant species, In other words, one could see all sorts of strange lifeforms here. Even if one encountered some on the street, it was nothing surprising. The people had become accustomed to it long ago.</p><p>With so many forces, it naturally had its own source of vitality, the most fiery of which were undoubtedly the auctions, followed by general stores, material stores, restaurants…and so on.</p><p>Due to Richlight Oceanspan’s uniqueness, a lot of experts from the surrounding regions would occasionally come here to try their luck, making experts here look like cabbages. It could even be said that Sea of Soul realm experts were like dogs and half-step Kings roamed everywhere. The experts here were worthless yet costly at the same time.</p><p>Above the ocean near Foursquare island, numerous figures could be seen standing closely. A few dozen li away from them, two figures were engaged in an intense battle. Their flames of their battle soared to the sky, and beautiful multicolored Qi shined in the sky, even dimming the blazing sun in the sky.</p><p>“Scumbag, eat my fist!”</p><p>The fighters were a blond young man and a wide-mouthed, square-faced middle-aged man with a red-face. The battle between the two were creating hundred meters long tides. Amidst the fierce battle, the blond young man roared and stamped on the tide underneath him as he punched at the middle-aged man standing in the air.</p><p>This fist didn’t contain Zhen Yuan, but a golden and exceptionally bright fiend power.</p><p>“Little b*stard, your grandpa will peel your skin off!”</p><p>The middle-aged man was no pushover either as he raised the huge blade in his hands and chopped down. A berserk snow-white blade light engulfed the golden fist energy like a tornado, then continued toward the young blond man. The fierceness of the blade aura was chilling.</p><p>“This place really has too many experts. Two out of ten spectators are half-step Kings.”</p><p>Amidst the crowd, two figures appeared at some point in time. Ye Chen glanced around and sighed.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng was attracted by the two fighters’ appearance and said,” That blond youngster ought to be a demonic beast cultivating to half-step Demonic Beast King realm. I wonder what demonic beast he is.”</p><p>“Miss seems to be a newcomer. You don’t even know Golden Lion Clan’s young master Shi Shaobao?” A handsome young man in luxurious clothes was attracted by Murong QIngcheng’s crisp voice and involuntarily turned his head. Seeing a sky-toppling beauty, his eyes brightened as he spoke.</p><p>“Golden Lion Clan?” Murong Qingcheng had never heard of it</p><p>But Ye Chen had, so he said, “Golden Lion Clan ought to be a Golden Lion race of Hundred Beasts. They have extraordinary strength and cultivate fiend power. They are ranked amongst the top ranks of Hundred Beasts.”</p><p>In the early ancient times, it was said that there were a hundred kinds of demonic beasts with high aptitudes, and were called Hundred Beasts. Golden Lion race was one such race. Like their ancestors, some of these races were also a part of Hundred Beasts. For example, Nine Headed Serpent, Sky Tiger, Cyan-Eyed White Wolf, and even Yan Fengfeng were also a part of the Hundred Beasts. Moreover, she was ranked higher than Golden Lions. After all, Luan was a descendant of the phoenix.</p><p>“Eh, you do know a lot.”</p><p>The handsome youngster glanced at Ye Chen. Seeing a cultivation base of merely late Sea of Soul realm, he revealed a trace of disdain. He assumed he was merely serving as Murong Qingcheng’s attendant. Where did a mere attendant gain the qualification to interrupt their conversation? He cleared his throat and ignored Ye Chen, speaking to Murong Qingcheng, “Shi Shaobao is a rare genius in Golden Lion Clan that only appears in a thousand years. His strength is enormous. Even if I went against him, I don’t feel confident in winning. As for this big man, his name is Hong Aokun. The two started fighting because of a verbal argument, and now it’s turned into a full on war. Seems like this matter won’t end without a death.</p><p>Rumbe!</p><p>As the luxuriously dressed youngster was speaking, the battle reached its climax.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A muffled roar rang out like a thunderclap and Shi Shaobao suddenly transformed into a thirty meters huge golden lion. The lion’s four legs were like stone pillars, and its mane glittered magnificently as if made of gold. His roar created a dazzling golden light as he suddenly leapt and appeared in the air above Hong Aokun, stamping down.</p><p>Hong Aokun’s strength was only comparable to Shi Shaobao’s human form. How could he resist the latter in his true form? His whole body turned bloody from being stepped on.</p><p>Shi Shaobao had a savage nature. After injuring Hong Aokun with his foot, he raised his enormous head and fiercely bit down.</p><p>Crunch!</p><p>Hong Aokun’s body was torn in two, spurting fountains of blood as he died miserably on the spot.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Spitting out the corpse, Shi Shaobao let out a long road toward the sky. A tyrannous aura swept the surroundings, intimidating many.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
