He could tell that the thunder spirit king might be even more powerful than any of the demi king warriors he had ever seen.</p><p>“What is going on here?”</p><p>Thunder spirit king nodded, he flew above the cave with hands behind his back and asked.</p><p>Guang Lin King said, “There was a predator queen that had killed dozens of warriors already. But of course, with Guang lin King your power she must not be able to do anything to you.”</p><p>Thunder spirit king waved his right hand, “One predator queen is not scary. What will be threatening is that there will be multiple of them in there.” One of the predator queen spider beast might be able to trouble him for a bit, but he would be fine with taking care of them. However, if there were two to three of them, then he might have a big problem.</p><p>“Thunder spirit king, I am Wanai Hu. I think let’s wait for another batch of people and let’s try to go through it together.” Wanai Hu was the demi beast king from the heaven tiger race. He could tell that the predator queen inside the cave could not be reached from the outside. Right now, only by going in by force might they have a chance. Of course, only with enough of people they might have a chance. But it also would mean that a number of warriors would die. Most importantly, with thunder spirit king being here with them, the whole attempt to go in would be safer.</p><p>“Brother Wanai was right, the cave is so deep, it would be a complete waste of time for us to be on the outside.” It was the demi king warriors Ice Spear King from the Ice pavilion which was one of the top nine marital institutions. Ye Chen had fought one of their former head disciple Duan Lengya as well and cut off one of his arms.</p><p>“Since that is the case, then let’s wait until there are twenty-five of us then.”</p><p>Thunder spirit king nodded.</p><p>As time passed on, everyone was still waiting quietly.</p><p>“Remember, don’t be too far away from me later.” Going though the cave might be the most dangerous thing they did ever since entering the forbidden place. Even of Qing Liu with her hammer could not say that she was fully confident.</p><p>“Yes, teacher.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, senior.”</p><p>Yan Fengfeng and Murong Qingchen nodded.</p><p>Ye Chen did not say anything, he was training with his legs tugged beneath his body. Although making a breakthrough would be all about timeing. But sometimes, it had also something major to do with luck. When it was there then, he could make a breakthrough jus like that. If he could pull that off then it would increase his power by a lot for sure.</p><p>After one hour, there were finally more than twenty five of them.</p><p>“Everyone, the cave of the predators is extremely dangerous, if going in alone, it might be so dangerous that we would not have a fighting chance. If we go in all at the same time, then it would be a fifty-fifty percent of chance after all. It is still my saying that if you do not have what it takes then you should not be here after all.”</p><p>Guang Lin Wang was really good at persuading people. With one sentence, a lot of the hesitant people made their decision without thinking twice. There were countless great treasures inside the grave area, but the more treasures, the more dangerous.</p><p>“Alright! Everyone, let’s go!”</p><p>Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!</p><p>The second he finished talking, everyone jumped into the cave. Thunder spirit king being the fastest, he led all the way right in the front.</p><p>The second would be Guang Lin king, Wanai Hu king and the. Now knew their plans yet</p><p>“Ah, time is goings so fast.”</p><p>When he had his eyes closed and was training, Ye Chen had already got the vague feeling of the next level. If given more time, he might be to reach the next realm with one hundred thousand confidence.</p><p>With twenty-five of them flew in the massive cave altogether, it was like throwing tiny stones into the ocean, it did not bring up any turbulence at all.</p><p>Without a sound, everyone sank in that pitch darkness.</p><p>Of course, looking from the outside, it was indeed pitch black. However, after entering, it was actually rather bright. But what was strange was that it seemed to be impossible to see the walls of the cave.</p><p>Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo!…</p><p>Yan Fengfeng and Murong Qingchen’s hearts were beating very fast. It was not like that they had not been life and death situations, but it was in the bright environments, but right now, they were in pitch black and not knowing where the predators would be attacking was always terrifying for anyone. Even if it was Yan Fengfeng and Murong Qingchen.</p><p>Normally, they both would be just as calm as Ye Chen. But right now, the gap between them was finally showing.</p><p>Amongst the five, Qing Liu and Sun Tianlang were breathing a bit faster already, only Ye Chen was able to maintain his normal heart beat. For him, being nervous would affect his performance and slow his reaction. And with the slightest different could mean the difference of life and death.</p><p>“No wonder that the soul power could not be spread out at all and only physical vision could see things. It turns out that there are soul stones around here.” Ye Chen finally figured about why he could not see the surface of the cave since most of the stones here were all stones with soul power which had the effect of counter-acting with soul power as well as to light. Without the reflection of light, it was reasonable that it was pitch black in here.</p><p>Ye Chen was able to recognize the stones was because he had gotten a lot of them in the ruin ancient place so he was not unfamiliar with these kind of things.</p><p>“However, this could not stop me as well.”</p><p>His pupils turned silver white, wherever he looked, it was snow white. It was like a world of black and white. Nothing can escape from his mind. The only down side of the situation now was that it could not cover as much grounds as his soul power since he had only one pair of eyes and it would be impossible to capture everything at the same time.</p><p>It was almost at the same time. A beam of gold light shoot out from Murong Qingchen’s eyes like two light towers. Gold beams sliced through the pitch dark.</p><p>There were countless black holes on the walls which were all connected. The smallest ones were ten meters big while the biggest were dozens of meters.</p><p>The black shadow moved. It was a round and seven-meter-long object. It moved to one of the holes on the walls and a head appeared.</p><p>In the red vision of its, thunder spirit king and the warriors’ figures appeared.</p><p>Opened its mouth, that round creature shoot out a white massive web, attacking the warriors.</p><p>“Now!”</p><p>Thunder spirit king’s reflex was one of the kind, he took out his long blade and attacked right at center of the spider web. It had not only split the web into two, that horrifying thunder power had even burned down the whole web.</p><p>It was not over yet. He then threw out another blade attack, the blade qi followed the web and attacked towards that round-looking creature. It was the queen of predators.</p><p>The latter hurried to hide and dived into the deepest end of the cave.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>A hundred-meter-long blade mark appeared on the wall, that thunder energy continued to spread out.</p><p>“Great master, save me!”</p><p>although the web had been split into two and mostly burned down. But two minor dozens meter big web had still covered Guang Lin king and the two top master warriors behind the ice spear king.</p><p>Being covered by the massive web, even if they release their protective zhen yuan, they would not be able to get out. that massive power on the spider web brought them out and approached the other cave.</p><p>Guang Lin king and ice spear king did not have the time to think before realizing the disappearance of the two. It turned out that on the other side of the walls, two beams of spider web had dragged them into the black holes.</p><p>“Damn.”</p><p>Guang Lin king tightened his fists. Before this, they had already lost one of the top master warrior, and now another one was taken as well. If he could not find some of the great treasures to compensate, then this trip would be a completely loss for them.</p><p>The Ice spear king had an even worse impression on his face. Another top master warrior that had been taken was his disciple. He regretted taking him along this trip completely.</p><p>Of course, even if he had suggested not taking anyone, most of the pavilion management would not agree as well. One powerful party would normally have one to two demi king warriors. so it would be impossible to send both of them there. Although one demi king warrior was already really powerful, but they could only fight with demi king warriors so there would not be much advantage there. Then, it would all be coming down to how brought the most top master level warriors.</p><p>Plus, who would have thought that this forbidden place would be this dangerous.</p><p>The predator queen seemed to have been pissed off by the thunder spirit king. He continued to attack him as she set up multiple spider webs.</p><p>However, the thunder spirit king was just way too powerful, these spider webs could not stop him at all. It could not even slow him down. After facing thunder spirit king’s multiple attacks, the predator queen had taken some damage for sure. She stopped attacking him, instead, she turned to the other warriors that were behind him.</p><p>…</p><p>over on the other side, the predator queen did not attack the warriors that were with thunder spirit king as well. Her target was someone else.</p><p>Ah! Ah!</p><p>Each cry meant a warrior being caught in the web. A total of seven cries were heard which increase the horrifying atmosphere in the air.</p><p>“Watch out!”</p><p>stepping on the flying sword, Ye Chen was like a beam of sword light, flying in the dark. As he pointed out his sword finger, another flying sword appeared out of nowhere. It continued to shoot out sword qi blowing away the incoming spider web. In his soul eyes, these invisible spider webs could not stay in hiding.</p><p>Murong Qingchen’s demon eyes might not be as powerful as Ye Chen’s but she could also see it all. With the two, Qing Liu, Yan Fengfeng and Sun Tianlang did not need to worry at all, all they needed to do was to follow instruction to attack.</p><p>“Lucky we are with them.”</p><p>Sun Tianlang could not be more glad. If it was not for Ye Chen, he could not have been this carefree. He might have been killed by now which strengthened his faith in Ye Chen. He knew that as long as he stick with them, then he might be able to survive and go home with some treasures.</p><p>Ah!</p><p>Cries continued to be heard. Eleven warriors had been captured which was almost a half of them.</p><p>What was good for everyone was that they had already seen the light in the end of the cave.</p><p>“We are almost there. Do not lose focus.”</p><p>Qing Liu did not relax for a second, instead, she got even more intense. According to her years of experience, it was time like now that was most dangerous.</p><p>Just as he finished talking, dozens of spider webs appeared. In the bottom of the cave, besides the two predator queens, there were a huge amount of predator kings.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Seeing that there were just about to reach the finishing line, a lot of people unconsciously let go of their tightened nerves. However, the incoming dozens of spider webs had taken their last hope.</p><p>“Mysterious Attack!”</p><p>Qing Liu made a light grown. That hammer in her hand blew in the space and created a shining triangular tunnel.</p><p>“Come in!”</p><p>Ye Chen and the rest of them followed behind.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The back of the tunnel continued to shatter as the four flew within.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
