Countless invisible finger powers shot out, blocking his opponent from all the different directions, leaving only one wave of finger power in the middle.</p><p>The expression on that middle-aged man in brown had changed. That distant finger power was able to break through his zhen qi palm attack, and if it landed on him, he would definitely not be able to walk away without being badly wounded. However, he thought wrong. The power of the Void Shattering Finger Art was only able to wound him a little bit, and definitely not kill him; it was only able to cancel out zhen qi.</p><p>“Gold Shattering Finger Art!”</p><p>The middle-aged man’s right hand thumb and index finger had turned into a golden color, then he flicked his fingers and threw out an attack.</p><p>Pop!</p><p>The two finger powers met in the air, and the blasting wave spread out different directions.</p><p>“Hm, the power of my Void Shattering Finger Art has been canceled out… it should be a Mid Rank Earth Realm Finger Art.” Ye Chen understood, although the Void Shattering Finger Art had a great rank, but he had not mastered even one-tenth of its true power. It was equal in power to only mid-level low Earth rank finger art at the moment. If it was not for its zhen qi shattering effect, it would probably be shattered by his opponent’s finger power easily.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Ye Chen pointed out his left hand index finger, shattering all the zhen qi attack in front of him, while his right hand held his sword and waved it in the air. His sword qi was so intense at the moment that it could kill a man instantly. His power had been pushed to its limit, which was a level he had not imagined before.</p><p>The middle-aged man kept backing up. After a couple times of exchanging attacks, he had basically figured out the strategy of Ye Chen’s finger art. He suspect it should only be a type of finger art that was especially targeted at breaking zhen qi attack and protective layers. Its attacking power was not that impressively high, and with his current intensity of his defensive layer, it should be able to cancel out around seventy percent of his opponent’s attack. Thus the rest of his attack should not be able to do much damage, leaving some small scratches at the most. On the contrary, he knew that his Gold Shattering Finger Art had a stronger attacking power, and along with a similar powerful effect on breaking opponents’ zhen qi layer, its power should be even slightly more powerful. But obviously, Ye Chen knew about it as well. That was why he decided to perform the finger art with his left hand to attack his defensive layer, while using his right hand to perform the sword art and attack his weakest part. He knew that Ye Chen was waiting for a moment for him to let down his guard and kill him on the spot.</p><p>“Flower Finger!”</p><p>Taking a deep breath, the middle-aged man groaned. His middle finger that was resting on his thumb started to bounce in an extremely fast speed, leaving a blurry shadow. Countless light golden finger powers clashed in the air, one after another, forming a beautiful golden flower in the air, which then attacked towards Ye Chen.</p><p>“Impressive attack!”</p><p>Once the golden flower had appeared, Ye Chen could immediately sense its structure, which contained a horrifying powerful cutting power in each one of those thin petals. He knew then his protective layer would not be able to defend him, and he was afraid it would get through his king kong body boosting art. Immediately, he popped three zhen qi boosting pills into his mouth. He swallowed one and hid the rest of the two inside of his mouth preparing for the unpredictable. The zhen qi inside Ye Chen’s body started to move at a crazy speed, which eventually was compressed into one small pile and pushed into his right arm. Following a special meridian, it came to the tip of his index finger. His whole index finger started to look unreal, as all of the air around started to get twisted.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Ye Chen pointed out his finger. Suddenly his surreal finger was expended ten times bigger, almost an arm thick. It hit the middle of the golden flower like a falling star.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!...</p><p>The golden flower exploded, and the surreal finger then disappeared completely.</p><p>The middle-aged man could not look more surprised. The Flower Finger was the last movement of the Gold Shattering Finger Art, and was supposed to be the most powerful movement of the art. Somehow, it was completely blocked.</p><p>‘What kind of finger art is that? Is it possible that I had underestimated him?’</p><p>“Mr. Jin, let us kill this brat together. Otherwise, he will become a big trouble in the future.” Yuan Zongbo appeared behind the middle-aged man out of nowhere. With blood dripping down his lips, his right sleeve where his right hand should be looked empty, lacking flesh and blood.</p><p>The middle-aged old man smiled and said, “I am only here to stop the fight. And I am not interested in getting in your conflicts.”</p><p>Yuan Zongbo sneered, “Mr. Jin, maybe other people do not know your background, but I know enough. With your so-called ‘stopping the fight’, you had ruined countless warriors and accumulated a huge fortune.”</p><p>“Hehe, you sure know a lot.” The smile on Mr. Jin’s face had not changed at all. However, in Yuan Zongbo and Ye Chen’s eyes, that smile looked immensely dangerous.</p><p>“So what do you say?”</p><p>Although Yuan Zongbo had said so, but he was secretly concerned about his opponents. He was wounded quite badly. His right arm and back had been almost completely drained by his Little Blood Demon Separating Art, and there was barely any blood left in his dried-out skin. If he kept performing his martial art, he might turn into a dried out corpse, and even the greatest medicine would not be able to save him. Wanting to corporate with Mr. Jin was because he wanted to kill Ye Chen once and for all. However, he was more afraid of Mr. Jin turning his back on him, killing him after killing Ye Chen. But the good thing was that he still had enough power to defend himself, and he believe all his opponents knew about this as well.</p><p>“I was planning to only stop the fight. However, this little brat has such a strong killing intention, killing everyone he laid his eyes on. He needs to learn how to let things go. The god has its plan, in order to keep everyone else safe from him, I will work with you against my will and kill this evil man.” Mr. Jin always hung around the Multi Mountain. He would get involved when there were warriors fighting with each other. He would help the wounded party by “trying” to stop the fight during which he would “accidentally” kill him. Then the wounded one would no longer be able to fight against him for the fortunes. But of course, if conditions allowed, he would kill the wounded as well, earning twice the fortune. However, he had made a bad judgment this time. Although Ye Chen did not have a very powerful attacking power, but that finger art of his was definitely a concern.</p><p>Ye Chen looked very serious. Mr. Jin’s power was indeed not simple comparing to Yuan Zongzo before who was wounded. Especially comparing with that Gold Shattering Finger Art, his Void Shattering Finger Art was slightly weaker. As for his ramble, he could not care less. In this warriors’ world, one always had to grow by standing on corpses. If someone wanted to kill them, they would just have to kill him.</p><p>With Mr. Jin’s agreement, Yuan Zongbo looked at Ye Chen with confidence, “I have told you before… This is the place you die.”</p><p>Ye Chen replied, “Next time I see you, I will beat you into a dried corpse.”</p><p>“You!” A chunk of blood traveled back up in Yuan Zongbo’s throat, and a massive murderous intention appeared in his eyes.</p><p>Mr. Jin shook his head, “Killing each other is never the solution… I will give you a chance. If you leave the storage ring on your hand as Brother Yuan’s compensation, I will let you leave in safety. As for me, I will take nothing, but that finger art manual. I want you to burn it right now.”</p><p>“Can you say something normal?”</p><p>With the pills that could refill his zhen qi instantly, Ye Chen was not afraid to burn his zhen qi. He performed the Void Shattering Finger Art again, pointing out his index finger towards the two.</p><p>“You little evil brat, I will have to teach you a lesson.”</p><p>Mr. Jin’s finger flicked in the air at an inhuman speed, and a golden flower appeared. Meanwhile, he said to Yuan Zongbo: “I will block him… You break his zhen qi layer with your sword qi!”</p><p>“Okay!”</p><p>Yuan Zongbo grabbed a bright red spirit plant and stuffed into his mouth. He swallowed it after a quick chew, suddenly feeling so much better. His body flashed, leaving a long bloody line in the air, as he reached behind Ye Chen and threw out a sword attack.</p><p>Dang!</p><p>The Star Scar appeared in Ye Chen’s hand, as he blocked the incoming attack easily with his sword qi. With the momentum of the sword qi, his finger power shot towards Mr. Jin with an even faster speed. His attack had almost covered the whole sky.</p><p>“Great timing!”</p><p>Mr. Jin knew how Void Shattering Finger Art worked, and he was not afraid of fighting hands on. So he turned to face Ye Chen, finger towards finger, as if he wanted to see who would last longer.</p><p>Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff!...</p><p>The two exchanged attacks at a tremendously high speed. Within a second, they had already exchanged ten finger attacks. And each one of them had canceled each other out, no one able to hurt the other.</p><p>“Blood Eagle Three Swords!”</p><p>Yuan Zongbo had a headache. ‘This brat is full of evil tricks. He definitely thought this through before deciding to fight up close with Mr. Jin, knowing that he would be at a disadvantage only if I joined them in that direct fight, otherwise I would not be able to be involved at all in the result.’ He had been waiting for a right moment for that attack for a long time now.</p><p>It was almost like having a pair of eyes in his back. Ye Chen walked out among his zhen qi shadows, letting one of his zhen qi shadow taking an attack, as he jumped towards Mr. Jin again.</p><p>“Ah! I don’t believe we can’t kill him!”</p><p>Yuan Zongbo’s body flashed, as he joined the fight.</p><p>The two’s corporation would not be regarded as perfect, but they still worked quite well, locking Ye Chen in a limited area.</p><p>“Separate!”</p><p>Ye Chen’s expression did not change at all. His body shook, and four human figures were separated from him, without one being able to tell which one was real and which was fake.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Yuan Zongbo cut open two human figures with one sword attack, while the other two were completely blocked by Mr. Jin. After the final attack, the rest would be Ye Chen’s real body.</p><p>“Separate! Again!”</p><p>Swallowing another pill that was hidden in his mouth, Ye Chen’s zhen qi went back to its peak again, as he performed his Shadow Separating Art another couple of times in a row. Another six human figures appeared. They all layered together, attacking the two from different directions, giving them no chance to help each other.</p><p>“It’s too tricky. How can he have endless zhen qi?” Mr. Jin was full of regrets. If he had known that Ye Chen was full of tricks like this, he would not have gotten himself involved at all. Right now, if he did not kill him, he was afraid that he would be looked for revenge in the future, which was never the way he did things.</p><p>Yuan Zongbo yelled in exasperation, “Mr. Jin, don’t hide your ace attack any more. You should see it by now that he is a trouble.”</p><p>“Alright, I will not hold anything back today.</p><p>Mr. Jin pointed on his own body for a couple of times, and his zhen qi suddenly increased drastically. It seemed to be an attacking power boosting art. But quite obviously, this secret art was still not completed. After performing this art, Mr. Jin could not help but puke out a chunk of blood, as his face turned pale.</p><p>Trying to cancel out Mr. Jin’s finger attack with his own finger attack, Ye Chen was immediately blown away. He thought to himself, ‘His attacking power has increased more than two times… I cannot leave it for any longer.’</p><p>Up until now, Ye Chen had used mainly his Shadow Separating Art. Without it, he would not be able to avoid a lot of the attacks; and although his Void Shattering Finger Art was great at breaking zhen qi, its power was still unable to compete with the Shadow Separating Art. Now, there would be only one sword attack for him to use in this situation.</p><p>The One Sword Attack would grow along with the the growth of the cultivation, and it still was his ace attack. Moreover, Mr. Jin’s defensive zhen qi was obviously not as good as Yuan Zongbo’s.</p><p>Using one finger attack to lure Yuan Zongbo away, Ye Chen’s body kept shaking. Countless zhen qi shadows appeared, forming an army of people. Some of them were standing right next to each other, while some of them were floating up and down; some of them were flying at an extremely fast speed. And what was the most horrifying part was that a lot of zhen qi shadows had layered together, which made them unable to be distinguished from the real Ye Chen.</p><p>Two zhen qi shadows rushed towards Mr. Jin, and Ye Chen’s real body was hidden within.</p><p>“Break!</p><p>Boom! A loud sound was heard.</p><p>A human figure had been shattered, and the other one was only chipped. But it revealed the real Ye Chen who was hiding right behind it.</p><p>Ye Chen held his sword with both of his hands, as he put all his attention into his Star Scar Sword. He sliced his sword from up to down, as a light blue sword light formed a line.</p><p>One Sword Attack up close!</p><p>Mr. Jin knew it was not good. His Gold Shattering Finger Art was already too late to block out the attack, so he hurried to activate his protective zhen qi to intensify the protection in front of him. Meanwhile, he put his right hand’s middle finger on his thumb, preparing to attack Ye Chen’s body the second he blocked his sword attack.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
