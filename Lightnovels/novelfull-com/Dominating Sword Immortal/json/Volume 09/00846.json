Ye Chen’s fame had been unparalleled during these past few years. He had not been present in True Spirit Continent, but when he returned, Ye Chen had already left the continent without any traces. However, wherever he went, be it tea houses, restaurants, or even streets, his name was present everywhere.</p><p>Without even needing to make inquiries himself, Ye Chen had already left an impression in his mind—genius, monstrous, unparalleled in the same generation, and undefeated.</p><p>Seeing so many credits gathered on a single person, his curiosity toward Ye Chen had become extremely strong. He really wished to see for himself how high could such a genius reach, and whether he could be unparalleled under the heavens like the Mysterious Queen.</p><p>“Dugu Jue is proud and Tantai Mingyue is soulful, but what kind of feeling does this Ye Chen give you?” The brown-haired woman had an equally great interest in Ye Chen, so she turned and asked the long-haired young man.</p><p>The latter pondered for a few moments and then said, “Probably broad!”</p><p>“Broad?”</p><p>The brown-haired woman’s face turned rather strange.</p><p>“Sword artists generally carry a sharp temperament. However, he is different. This is my first impression of him.” The long-haired young man replied.</p><p>“That’s true. He indeed is a different kind of sword artist.” The brown-haired woman faintly nodded.</p><p>If they did not have a certain understanding of Ye Chen already due to being aware of most of his big and small feats in the True Spirit Continent, they would not have been able to make such a judgment. Somebody who had no idea of Ye Chen’s previous feats would not feel such a deep feeling from him.</p><p>“I didn’t think you’d come. Seems like there is a good show for you again.” Bei Minghui wiped the blood off his face and grinned.</p><p>“Chasing the peak is my dream, and the dream of all the martial artists. How could I not come?” Ye Chen indifferently said.</p><p>“Talks are over…Die for me!”</p><p>Young Tiger Lord had not given up on attacking Bei Minghui. He clawed with his right hand, and a hundred huge tiger claws shot forth, surprisingly surrounding Ye Chen as well. He seemed to want to take care of everything in one swoop.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Facing the Young Tiger Lord, Ye Chen didn’t even give him a glance and slashed his sword. A frightening sword not only slashed the tiger claws apart, but also continued toward the Young Tiger Lord.</p><p>“Eh!” Young Tiger Lord titled his body and leaped, barely dodging the sword Qi.</p><p>“As expected, he is strong!” Amongst the crowd, Situ Hao bitterly smiled before a deep admiration appeared on his face.</p><p>“Didn’t expect you are also a person of True Spirit Continent, and even seem to have quite a bit of fame.” Young Tiger Lord no longer dared to look down on Ye Chen. In his previous attack, he had already used seventy percent of his strength, yet it was casually slashed apart by the other. It was actually a bit of a shock to him.</p><p>“You’re not my opponent.” Ye Chen shook his head.</p><p>“Seems like I’m looked down upon,” A grim sneer appeared on Young Tiger Lord’s face, “You’ve offended Young Undying Demon Lord, so he’ll take care of you sooner or later. However, before that, let me see what qualifications you have to say that I’m not your opponent.”:</p><p>As one of the eight great young beast lords, how could the Young Tiger Lord be frightened from a single sentence of Ye Chen? It would be simply be a disgrace to the pride of great beast lords.</p><p>As he spoke, his body shook, and an even stronger might poured out of his body. The sky reverberated with tiger roars while changing colors.</p><p>Young TIger Lord had obtained a life and death stone as soon as he arrived in the Life and Death Secret Realm. Although he hadn’t been able to break through into the third layer from the peak of the second layer, it was not as if had hadn’t made any improvement. At least in terms of aura suppression, he was exceedingly confident.</p><p>Ye Chen’s robes fluttered without any wind. His sword aura was as if he himself was being unsheathed like a sword. As soon as his aura appeared, it immediately clashed with Young Tiger Lord’s aura.</p><p>Creak!</p><p>The collision of the two auras caused a huge muffled explosion, causing even the space to faintly twist. However, such a state only lasted for a brief moment. The next instant, Young Tiger Lord’s feet staggered and retreated three steps while a faint tear appeared on his robes at the chest.</p><p>Without a doubt, Ye Chen’s sword aura was more destructive than the former’s.</p><p>“How can sword aura be so powerful!” Young Tiger Lord’s face changed several times, and he immediately concluded that he couldn’t be Ye Chen’s opponent in terms of aura. It was just like when he confronted Young Elephant Lord, he would never be able to gain an upper hand.</p><p>“Competing in aura against Ye Chen!” Bei Minghui sneered, then sent a Zhen Yuan transmission to Ye Chen, “Care for his Heavenly Tiger Roar. It’s very strange, as it contains a will attack and can shake the space.”</p><p>“I’ve seen it.”</p><p>Ye Chen faintly nodded. In the desolate ancient lands, he had experienced the Heavenly Tiger Roar when Yan Fengfeng and Tiger Clan’s Moqi Lou had exchanged blows. Although his might was far inferior to the Young Tiger Lord’s, the essence of the move was the same.</p><p>“Take this!” Young Tiger Lord roared as his body flashed and claw struck out. This time, he held nothing back as a huge tiger claw made of beast energy burst forth while emitting huge ripples. However, Ye Chen’s face remained unchanged as he stepped forth and thrusted the Evil Vanquishing Sword out.</p><p>Bei Minghui was different, as he simply wasn’t able to react in time against Young Tiger Lord’s pounce, and was only able to condense of his strength. However, Ye Chen’s strike was faster than Bei Minghui’s by a lot. Evil Vanquishing Sword flickered like a white dot in the void.</p><p>Rip!</p><p>Young Tiger Lord didn’t expect that he would be disadvantaged even after making the first move. As he saw that his Protective Zhen Yuan was about to be pierced, his tail madly lashed out, trying to make both sides suffer. He had confidence that he would merely suffer a light injury while issuing a heavy strike on Ye Chen’s body. After all, the body of the beast race was indeed a lot stronger than humankind.</p><p>However, he miscalculated.</p><p>Ye Chen immediately retreated after thrusting, The other’s tail merely brushed past his chest while his claw didn’t even come close to his body.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Sparks flew out and a small dot appeared on Young Tiger Lord’s shoulder, revealing the shiny armor inside. It was evidently no ordinary armor—at least peak half-extreme grade armor or pseudo extreme grade armor.</p><p>Young Tiger Lord licked the blood streaking down the corner of his mouth and said, “No wonder you’re arrogant! You’ve developed your own sword technique.”</p><p>Confronting Ye Chen’s Quick Sword, he had suffered light injuries despite wearing a pseudo extreme grade armor. The eyes of long haired young man and the woman beside him shone on seeing this.</p><p>“However, this is not the extent of my strength!” Young Tiger Lord’s spun once in the void and turned into a ten meter tall and dozens of meters long silver tiger. The tiger stripes on his forehead seemed to be assuming the shape of ‘王’ and also ‘天’, radiating a mighty pressure.</p><p>(Tl: 王- King, 天- Sky)</p><p>“His Heavenly Tiger Meridians are quite rich.”</p><p>True Heavenly Tiger had platinum fur, and Silver was only a step away from that state.</p><p>After transforming, the Young Tiger Lord’s battle power again increased. His long tail was already twisting the space, seeming as if it would shatter the space with but a whip. However, even after transforming into his original body, Young Tiger Lord was not able to gain any advantage. Instead, his huge body proved to be a detriment as Ye Chen’s target turned bigger. The former’s entire body was soon riddled with sword scars, dripping blood everywhere.</p><p>Ye Chen’s strength not only astonished Young Tiger Lord, but also the other geniuses of True Spirit Continent and Blood Sky Continent. The former were still somewhat prepared, but the latter were witnessing Ye Chen for the first time. Seeing the fourth rank of the eight great young beast lords beaten black and blue at his hands, their eyes were almost about to pop off.</p><p>“This person is not so simple as just being a famed figure in True Spirit Continent, right?” The eagle-nosed young man who had grasped a general inkling of the situation squinted his eyes.</p><p>“Hehe…With such a strength, there is no need to worry. I’m afraid such a strength is not even below mine.” The brown-haired woman let out a sigh of relief. Ye Chen’s performance was indeed amazing. To completely suppress a second layer peak cultivation base with merely first layer was not below the achievements of the long-haired young man beside him.</p><p>It should be known that the long-haired young man had already entered the top ranks of Life and Death Substitute List ten years ago. In the True Spirit Continent, it was only below Luo Tiandu.</p><p>“Indeed, there is no need to worry. Although, I wonder if this is his peak battle power?” The long-haired youngster said.</p><p>“Don’t tell me this is not his peak battle power!” The brown-haired woman skeptically asked.</p><p>The more Young Tiger Lord fought, the more astonished he became, and the more powerless he felt. No matter how he attacked Ye Chen, he was unable to threaten him one bit. On the other hand, every single sword strike that seemed to be casually issued left behind a scar on his body. Upon transforming, although his battle power had greatly increased, his pseudo supreme grade armor had reverted inside his body. Thus, his defenses had actually lowered somewhat.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>With his fur standing erect, the Young Tiger Lord issued a berserk beast energy at Ye Chen, intending to suppress the latter with his higher cultivation base.</p><p>“Waning Moon!”</p><p>With his blue robes fluttering in the wind, Ye Chen chopped down. The waning moon shaped sword energy cleaved through the beast energy and slashed on Young Tiger Lord’s body, splattering blood everywhere.</p><p>“Heavenly Tiger Roar!”</p><p>Bloody and battered, Young Tiger Lord eventually used his innate skill—Heavenly Tiger Roar. Unlike the roar from his human form, this time’s roar was several times stronger. The space warped, distorting the trajectory of Ye Chen’s sword. At the same time, a sound wave carrying a will attack brushed against Ye Chen’s body.</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>Ye Chen’s face slightly changed. The roar caused a crease in the space, carrying streams of hidden energy like a tumultuous river that would influence one’s sword if one were to train underwater. As for the sound wave, he completely ignored it. He had a fifth step Destruction Sword intent, so such a will attack was more like a joke.</p><p>“Haha. die!”</p><p>Seeing Ye Chen’s sword deflecting from its trajectory, Young Tiger Lord heartily laughed and clawed. This attack contained his entire power and was emitting a frightening energy.</p><p>“Death will be yours.”</p><p>Strangely, a spatial ripple appeared at Ye Chen’s position, counteracting the influence of the roar. Like a mirage, Ye Chen’s sword trajectory readjusted. Following the opening in Young Tiger Lord’s attack, it pierced through the latter’s throat.</p><p>“Arh..!”</p><p>A grunt escaped Young Tiger Lord’s mouth and his eyes opened wide.</p><p>“Stay your hand, Soaring Eagle!”</p><p>The eagle nosed young man roared in fury as a tyrannical beast energy gushed out of his body and transformed into an eagle, which pounced onto Ye Chen.</p><p>“You think there is nobody in True Spirit Continent?” The long-haired young man’s body repeatedly flickered and his speed increased a hundred times greater than that of wind itself.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
