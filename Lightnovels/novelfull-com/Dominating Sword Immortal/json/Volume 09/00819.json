Is it resurrection?”</p><p>“It would have been great if it were that simple!” The person in the picture sighed.</p><p>“Senior, who are you?” Ye Chen eventually asked.</p><p>“Yuan Canghai!”</p><p>“Yuan Canghai? This name seems familiar?” The black-robed old man revealed a pensive expression. Suddenly his face changed before he shouted, “Yuan Emperor, Yuan Canghai…You’re the Yuan Emperor?”</p><p>“Yuan Emperor?” Ye Chen was astonished as well. The last person to leave a mark on Emperor Scar Stelle was precisely the Yuan Emperor. He had an innate Dharmic Body and possessed a boundless Zhen Yuan. If the person was indeed Yuan Emperor, it would be too freakish.</p><p>The person in the picture smiled indifferently, “Turns out there are still people who remember my name!”</p><p>These words were undoubtedly a confirmation for Ye Chen and the black-robed old man that he was indeed the last titled monarch of True Spirit World to leave behind a mark on Emperor Scar Stelle—Yuan Emperor.</p><p>“Rest assured Senior! If I have the ability, I’ll resolve the crisis of True Water Palace Ruins. If I cannot, senior would have misjudged.” Ye Chen solemnly said.</p><p>“Misjudged? Hehe, you’re quite the talker, eh?” The Yuan Emperor smiled.</p><p>The black-robed old man’s face changed several times before his face turned sinister, “So what if you’re the Yuan Emperor? The real Yuan Emperor is already dead! You are merely an image left behind him. You think you can beat me just relying on your image?”</p><p>“Come, try me.”</p><p>Yuan Emperor strode out of the painting, stepping into the real world as the ink traces on his body slowly faded away. He seemed no different from a real person at this moment. However, if one sensed him using soul power, they would find his figure illusory, completely unlike a real person.</p><p>“Sure! See me blow you off…Demonic Scar Extermination!”</p><p>During his battle with Ye Chen, the black-robed old man didn’t use any profound martial skills. However, Yuan Emperor was different. Before getting a feel for the latter’s true strength, he’d better be a bit careful. Otherwise, he might end up suffering a lot, losing more than he could gain.</p><p>As the black-robed old man thrust his palm, a black crack appeared in the void and flew toward the Yuan Emperor, as if stamping on his body. Ye Chen’s eyes squinted. If the black-robed old man had used profound martial skills, he wouldn’t have been able to endure even with the Sky Scorpio Sword in hand. The disparity was too great.</p><p>“Profound level is too low!” Yuan Emperor shook his head and pointed at the black crack, then made a swiping gesture.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>The black crack disappeared like smoke, as if it never existed.</p><p>“Damn it! Demonic Dao Eternal River!”</p><p>The black-robed old man roared and pushed his Zhen Yuan to the limits, his body emitting a dazzling black radiance. He extended his hands and pushed toward Yuan Emperor’s figure, as if pushing a huge milestone.</p><p>“Demonic Clan martial skill?”</p><p>Seeing the incomparably dense black river surging river shattering space, Yuan Emperor’s expression remained indifferent as he punched out.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The black-river burst out, filling the space around the two with black splashes, as if a huge fountain had been set off between the two.</p><p>A single punch from the image of Yuan Emperor seemed as if it had attained the limits of strength, capable of shattering the heaven and earth.</p><p>“Impossible! How can a mere image be so powerful?” The black-robed old man was blasted off. He tumbled dozens of li in void backward before recovering.</p><p>“You’re too weak! Martial skills are too low leveled, and martial will also too low weak. Is this the current state of Life and Death Kings?” Yuan Emperor’s figure stood with his arms behind his back as he spoke indifferently.</p><p>“Don’t be too proud! Your era has passed long ago!” The black-robed old man’s long hair fluttered in the wind as bizarre black runes appeared on his hands, covering his palms entirely. As the runes formed, his aura soared as well. The terrifying Zhen Yuan fluctuations shook the space, causing numerous cracks to extend.</p><p>“Eh, refining supreme grade gloves inside the body. Not bad!” His brows raised before Yuan Emperor faintly nodded.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The black-robed old man didn’t care who the enemy was. As long as they blocked his way, they would die. He again thrust his palm out, and a much thicker black crack stamped at Yuan Emperor’s image.</p><p>It was once again the Demonic Scar Extermination.</p><p>Yuan Emperor’s face remained unchanged as his body disappeared amidst a flicker and reappeared ten li away. The black crack couldn’t stamp on his body. However, the crack didn’t disappear and seemed impossible to mend again.</p><p>“Such means, such body arts!”</p><p>This was the first time Ye Chen was seeing two Life and Death Kings exchanging blows. The black-robed old man’s methods greatly astonished him. He could leave a scar in the void that didn’t instantly scatter. If this scar was branded on a person’s body, the latter would be tortured to death. On the other hand, Yuan Emperor’s body arts could even frighten ghosts and spirits. His movements seemed to completely disregard the limitations of the void, rendering the black-robed old man incapable of locking him down.</p><p>Anyhow, the black-robed was far more astonished then Ye Chen. Nobody knew the might of Demonic Scar Extermination better than him. This art could only be dealt head on, and was impossible to dodge. Once it locked on the target’s vital Qi, it would hound one till their death. Even entering the void would not allow one to escape. When Yuan Emperor destroyed with a mere finger, he could still accept it, because it could indeed be destroyed. However, this time, the Yuan Emperor had actually dodged it, causing the art to lose its target in the void.</p><p>“This body of mine has a limited energy. I can’t play with you for too long. Come, sword!” Having retreated for ten li, Yuan Emperor made a pulling motion. The Evil Vanquishing Sword on Ye Chen’s waist unsheathed and landed in his hand before Ye Chen could even react.</p><p>“Evil Vanquishing Sword?”</p><p>Ye Chen couldn’t understand it. Sky Scorpio Sword was much more powerful than Evil Vanquishing Sword. In Yuan Emperor hands, it could effortlessly kill the black-robed old man.</p><p>As if he knew what Ye Chen was thinking, Yuan Emperor said, “Evil Vanquishing Sword contains the power of subduing demons, which is particularly great against demonic humans. Moreover, that supreme grade sword of yours costs too much Zhen Yuan. With this body of mine, I would not sustain it. As far as I’m concerned, Evil Vanquishing Sword is more than enough.”</p><p>“I understand!”</p><p>Ye Chen faintly nodded. This was not the true body of Yuan Emperor, and thus, didn’t possess a boundless Zhen Yuan. The lesser the energy it could burn, the better it would be.</p><p>“Void Yuan Slash!”</p><p>Holding the Evil Vanquishing Sword in hand, Yuan Emperor’s gaze slightly sharpened. He slashed single-handedly, emitting an invisible sword Qi that slashed at the black-robed old man’s body.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The black-robed old man roared. He couldn’t see the trajectory of the sword Qi. However, his intuition told him that if it struck him, he would die nine times out of ten.</p><p>“Demonic Flicker!” His body flickered, turning illusory like twinkling stars.</p><p>“Puchi!”</p><p>The invisible sword Qi slashed at the illusory body of black-robed old man, seemingly missing its intended target. However, Ye Chen didn’t think so. In the next instant, blood splashed about and a low growl was sounded.</p><p>Sure enough. The illusory body shattered, leaving behind a true arm flying off. In the next instant, it dispersed into nothingness.</p><p>In the distance far away, the black-robed old man’s body appeared. His face was pale and right arm was missing.</p><p>“Why? How could I be hit?” The black-robed old man had an appalled face. Demonic Flicker was a demonic clan martial art. Although the latter didn’t need cultivation of profound, Demonic Flicker contained the power of space, which was merely a distinct form of space profound. The sources of both were the same.</p><p>He believed that he would be able to escape this calamity by using Demonic Flicker. Never did he imagine that he would still end up losing his right arm in the end.</p><p>Yuan Emperor curled his mouth, “Your luck is pretty good. My current strength is too lacking compared to my true self. Other moves consume too much energy.”</p><p>Ye Chen was dumbstruck. The strength of Yuan Emperor’s image must be far inferior to the true Yuan Emperor, and the former even used his weakest move. Even so, a demonic human King couldn’t withstand a single strike. One could imagine how powerful the true Yuan Emperor might be.</p><p>“However, I’ve already seen through your movements. This time, you’ll die!” Yuan Emperor raised Evil Vanquishing Sword a second time and softly slashed.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The black-robed old man was alarmed and hurriedly entered the void. However, the strike of Void Emperor even made the bounds of space clear. Even Ye Chen could see the miserable, escaping figure of old man in the void.</p><p>“Such might! Worthy of being the Yuan Emperor who cursed at the whole universe in those days.”</p><p>Right at this moment, countless black petals rained down from the void, about the size of copper coins. Clear veins on the surface, soft texture— they were no different from true petals. The raining petals ignored the bounds of space and continued to drop in the external world. Upon landing on the ground, they instantly turned into nothingness, disappearing with a flash.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>From the petals behind the black-robed old man, a gorgeous black-robed woman appeared. She was extremely tall and had dim red pupils, as well as an erect bosom—a perfect figure. She swiped her right hand, and an incorporeal power gushed out beside the old man.</p><p>Rip!</p><p>The invisible sword Qi bounced off and disappeared in the depths of the void.</p><p>“Great Elder!”</p><p>Hearing the voice, the black-robed old man’s expression relaxed and delight appeared in his eyes. Then, he turned around and cupped his hands towards the black-robed woman.</p><p>“Chaotic Demon Ocean’s great elder of demonic human clan? She is a Demonic Human Emperor?” Ye Chen was worried inwardly. Only the combined elder of all the demonic human clans would be called Great Elder.</p><p>“Another strong one is here. Kid, the people you’ve offended don’t seem weak.” Yuan Emperor’s image frowned and helplessly glanced at Ye Chen, who smiled bitterly, “Some things are inevitable, and you can only face them.”</p><p>It was clear that the former had come for Murong Qingcheng. An insignificant him was not enough to make a Demonic Human Emperor personally make a move.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
