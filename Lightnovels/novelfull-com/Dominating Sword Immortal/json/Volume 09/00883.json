Unfortunately, a low level crystal can’t take it all the way to the fifth step.”</p><p>The higher one went, the more difficult it became to strengthen the spirit body. A low level Blood Demon Crystal was still useful for Ye Chen as it further refined the essence of his spirit body. However, upon reaching the fifth step, it would have no use whatsoever. This was because his body’s resistance would be enough to completely nullify the effect of Blood Demon Crystal, just like repeatedly taking a medicine would nullify its effect on the body.</p><p>Of course, even though a low level Blood Demon Crystal could not let him advance his spirit body to the fifth step, it could still refine his fourth step spirit body, making the future advancement much easier. After all, advancing one’s spirit body was an endeavor that largely depended on oneself. Finding treasures capable of strengthening the spirit body were not so easy to find.</p><p>“Senior Yuan Emperor was right. Even though the improvement of my spirit body seems insignificant, it has really lowered the damage being done by the Fire Star Poison.” Letting out a breath, Ye Chen stood up with a faint smile on his face. “I’ll hold that thought for later. Let’s keep looking and try my luck if I can find more low level Blood Demon Kings.”</p><p>Low level Blood Demon Kings could be weak or powerful for Ye Chen as well. If he ran into a powerful one, he could use Sword Domain to slow it and escape. Of course, he hoped not to run into a mid level Blood Demon King, because that would be tantamount to dying nine times out of ten.</p><p>Crossing the ravine, Ye Chen arrived into the interior of the mountain range.</p><p>“The location of Blood Crystal Flower is completely random. If it’s on the surface, I might be able to find it with soul power. But if it’s underground, that would be troublesome.”</p><p>In Bloodlight Ocean, Ye Chen’s soul power could only cover a few dozen li, while the effect was further lowered underground, allowing him to only scan one-two li. If the flower crystal was a few li underground, he wouldn’t be able to find it even if it were right under his feet.</p><p>“I can only hope to get lucky.”</p><p>Ye Chen flew across with a uniform speed. The mountain range had a complex terrain; there were waterfalls, lakes, forests, and barren mountains While flying over a barren mountain, he suddenly stopped.</p><p>“A fragment of Blood Crystal Flower!”</p><p>On the mountain, a blood-red crystal was shining brightly.</p><p>Picking up the crystal flower, Ye Chen sighed. A mere fragment’s effect would be at most a hundredth of the full flower. Only a complete Blood Crystal Flower would have a major effect.</p><p>Looking at the barren mountain that was in shambles, Ye Chen understood that it must have been the scene of an intense struggle, also explaining the ruined Blood Crystal Flower. Throwing the splinter of crystal flower, Ye Chen continued on his way.</p><p>Three days later, he had scouted out more than half of the mountain range.</p><p>“Oh! A low level Blood Demon King against a Beast King.”</p><p>Ye Chen’s eyes brightened. With the Evil Shattering Sword and Destruction Sword Intent, he was the bane of the larger portion of low level Blood Demon Kings.</p><p>A few dozen li away, a low level Blood Demon King and a dog-type Beast King were fighting. The dog-type Beast King was an ordinary King with strength even lower than Poison Fire King. He looked desperate; trying to escape but unable to. He could only repeatedly defend while howling incessantly.</p><p>“Damn it!” With a fierce howl, he spouted out a light sphere thatsphere exploded more than half of the Blood Demon King’s body into smithereens. However, its body instantly recondensed. Taking the advantage of the slight pause the dog-type Beast King took after using his ace, it turned into a blood light and drilled into the latter’s body.</p><p>Ah!</p><p>The dog-type Beast King’s body rapidly withered. In the next instant, the blood light drilled out of dog-type Beast King’s body, seeming stronger than before.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Picking his moment, Ye Chen shot forth. Upon discovering him, a cold light flickered in the Blood Demon King’s eyes as it met Ye Chen’s charge and the two rapidly closed in. When the distance between the two closed to a thousand meters, Ye Chen released his Sword Domain, inflicting the enormous sword pressure on the Blood Demon King’s body and significantly reducing its speed.</p><p>“Congealing Water!” Pulling the Evil Shattering Sword out, Ye Chen thrust out.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Half of the Blood Demon King’s body crumbled, unable to recondense.</p><p>Losing half of its body, the Blood Demon King didn’t die, but it seemed much weaker. Terror appeared on its face and it instantly escaped. Unfortunately, the existence of Sword Domain reduced its speed by half.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Trapped in the mirror, the escaping Blood Demon King’s shattered into a million pieces, thoroughly dead, while a low level Blood Demon Crystal fell down.</p><p>“Another one! My luck is pretty good!” Ye Chen reached out and grabbed the crystal with delight. “I should find a place to refine this crystal and continue to strengthen my spirit body.”</p><p>Ye Chen had always acted steadily. This Bloodlight Ocean had layers upon layers of danger, and every bit of extra survivability counted. The more powerful his spirit body was, the stronger his defenses would be.</p><p>“Not good!” Just as he was about to leave, a warning screamed in his mind, and his entire being instantly soared up.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A huge hole opened underneath and a blood-colored flame erupted, burning the surface into blood-colored crystal granules. In the distance, a blood light was flying at him. It was not a Blood Demon King, but a Hetero Blood Demon King!</p><p>“That was close! A moment slower and I would have been at least crippled, if not dead.” In the air, Ye Chen’s eyes squinted, sizing the Hetero Blood Demon King that had assaulted him. This Hetero Blood Demon King was not a human, but a mantis ascended to Demon King. Its attack just now was made with its sickle-shaped shrimp limb.</p><p>“This mantis Demon King has wings, so escaping it won’t be easy. If it attracts other Demon Blood Demon Kings, I’ll be in big trouble.”</p><p>The reason he was able to escape the previous Hetero Blood Demon King was because its speed was a bit slower than Ye Chen’s. Adding his Sword Domain, Ye Chen could easily outfly it. However, this mantis blood demon’s speed was almost twice than his.</p><p>“In that case, I can only fight it out.”</p><p>The mantis blood demon’s strength was a lot higher than Poison Fire King, but it was still within Ye Chen’s scope. One on one, Ye Chen felt he could manage it.</p><p>“Sword Domain Assault!”</p><p>With a thought, numerous cyan-colored swords condensed and shot out. The sky-covering assault caused the mantis blood demon unable to close in.</p><p>Clang Clang Clank Clank!</p><p>The mantis Blood Demon King waved its two mantis limbs like huge blades, creating a blood colored light screen. The cyan-colored swords bounced off the screen and then shattered.</p><p>“Bewitching Mirror Shattering!”</p><p>The space warped, turning into a mirror and sealing the mantis Demon King within before shattering with a bang. A frenzy of spatial blades cut at the mantis blood demon’s body.</p><p>“This Hetero Blood Demon King is also restricted by evil vanquishing power and Destruction Sword Intent.”</p><p>A slight delight appeared on Ye Chen’s face. The cuts on the mantis blood demon’s body wriggled, seemingly struggling to patch up. Of course, it was not a pure Blood Demon King; thus, the effect on it was not too big. If it had been a pure Blood Demon King, it would have lost almost half of its battle power.</p><p>Mantis blood demon was, in the end, quite powerful. Even while being attacked, it had slashed out a blood-colored flame.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>Ye Chen repeatedly blocked with his sword.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The blood-colored flame erupted, flinging Ye Chen seventy-eighty meters away and further causing him to spout a steamy blood-colored mist.</p><p>“So strong! I’m afraid it’s a peak existence among low level Blood Demon Kings.”</p><p>Ordinary Kings were also called low level Kings, corresponding to low level Blood Demon King and Hetero Blood Demon Kings. Poison Fire King was merely a mid-grade existence among low level Kings. As for Giant Wolf King, he was an existence at the bottom. However, this Mantis Demon King was a top existence among low level Kings.</p><p>“But, I have Sword Domain, which can suppress it somewhat.”</p><p>Ye Chen pushed his Sword Domain to its limits, and the enormous Sword Pressure caused the space to further solidify, slowing the movements of mantis blood demon’s limbs.</p><p>“Break for me!”</p><p>Replacing Evil Shattering Sword with the Sky Scorpio Sword, Ye Chen obliquely thrust out. Sky Scorpio Sword was the Sky Scorpio Sword after all; it instantly turned one limb of mantis blood demon into crystal, which thereupon instantly shattered with a bang.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>The mantis blood demon reacted violently. The wings on its back flapped with a frenzy, creating a buzzing sound. Thereupon, its body turned into a blood-colored string and shot across.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The blood-colored string was too fast. As a result, Ye Chen couldn’t evade thoroughly and lost his right arm.</p><p>“Restore.”</p><p>As his right arm regrew, Ye Chen gravely sized the mantis blood demon. This was his first time facing such a powerful opponent. Its strength was such that victory seemed hopeless.</p><p>“The world is a small place indeed. Who would have thought that I will run into the genius that Lords wanted me to take care of here in Bloodlight Ocean.” At some point, a human figure appeared on a summit a few dozen li away. “Eh? He is fighting against a top low level Hetero Blood Demon King. No wonder Lords deemed him as a must kill target. Once he enters Life and Death realm, even my true body might not be able to kill him. If he is given time, he’ll surely become another Mysterious Queen.”</p><p>“I might as well kill him with a soul assault!”</p><p>With a sneer appearing on its face, the figure’s eyes squinted as an incorporeal soul power shaped like a sharp arrow shot out of his forehead. The attack was too fast. Before Ye Chen could even sense, he was hit as if being pierced by an arrow.</p><p>Due to the momentary dizziness, he was slashed by the mantis blood demon. With several of his ribs broken, he was blasted away while spurting blood.</p><p>‘Somebody attacked me with soul power assault!’ Ye Chen immediately thought.</p><p>“Impossible!” The human figure was greatly astonished. He was a majestic high level King. Even if the current him was merely a consciousness projection with soul power far less than his main body, it was not something a little guy in the third layer of life-and-death chamber could resist. He expected his soul attack to extinguish Ye Chen’s soul with ease.</p><p>Crashing into a summit, Ye Chen looked at the human figure.</p><p>“A human King…Why did he attack me?”</p><p>With five times the soul power compared to the norm, Ye Chen’s soul membrane was naturally extremely powerful as well. During the ranking battles, he could have actually disregarded Marquis Sword Snow’s soul attack, but doing so would have revealed too much. After all, in addition to the immense amount, his soul power was not inferior to Kings in essence.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
