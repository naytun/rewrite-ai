Don’t tell me you’re thinking of snatching others’ treasures in broad daylight.?” A terrifying aura originated from Ye Chen. Although his cultivation base was merely that of a mid half-step King, his aura could frighten anybody under the Life and Death King realm.</p><p>Huff!</p><p>At the level of half-step King realm, one’s aura would gain substance and could contain an exceptionally destructive power. With Ye Chen as the center, the void suddenly trembled and a transparent shockwave spread out. Even though everyone present on the scene were half-step Kings, their faces changed, and some with weaker strengths couldn’t help but step back. Fortunately, the site was covered with a restriction and wouldn’t easily collapse.</p><p>“What a frightening aura!” The few young men and women in the crowd stared at Ye Chen, not expecting his aura to be so powerful.</p><p>“Hehe…you really dare to offend me in Gemstone Islands!”</p><p>The thin, black old man squinted his eyes, and his own aura burst out, colliding with Ye Chen’s. Creaking noises unceasingly echoed in the void, as if moaning due to being unable to endure the clash of the two auras.</p><p>“There are only two permanent ‘strongest’ half-step Kings in Gemstone Islands, and Darkbright King is one of them. It’s said that his Darkbright Fist Arts are feared among other ‘strongest’ half-step Kings, and nobody dares face it head on. It seems the rumors are true. Even his aura is enough to make one despair.”</p><p>“Darkbright King is naturally a true ‘strongest’ half-step King. I wonder where this kid comes from though. He doesn’t seem to recognize Darkbright King, or he wouldn’t have acted as such.”</p><p>“The young are haughty. However, although this kid’s cultivation base is only at mid half-step King realm, his aura is so powerful!”</p><p>“There are several folds to an aura being powerful. This kid’s aura contains a peerless sword intent. It must be because his achievements on sword intent are far beyond others’ grasp.”</p><p>“You’re right. But, he is still too impulsive. To clash against a veteran ‘strongest’ half-step King is simply asking for trouble.”</p><p>Numerous discussions arose.</p><p>“So, you’re a ‘strongest’ half-step King…No wonder you’re so arrogant!” Cultivation didn’t determine everything. Admittedly, Darkbright King’s cultivation base was at the higher stage, but it didn’t mean that he was a ‘strongest’ half-step King. However, Ye Chen could feel from his aura that he was truly powerful. Hearing the surrounding discussions, he immediately understood.</p><p>“It’s still not too late. Otherwise, Gemstone Islands will become your grave.” Darkbright sneered. His fame in Gemstone Islands was resounding. Adding his cruel and sinister conduct, nobody was daring enough to provoke him. If not for this place being Glorious Exchanges, why would he bother with words? He would directly throw the former’s corpse in the ocean.</p><p>“Whose grave this place will become is not certain. But for now, close your mouth for me.”</p><p>Ye Chen’s eyes shone brightly, emitting two peerless gems of sword intent. The void shook as a frightening sword intent gushed out, heading straight toward the Darkbright King.</p><p>Darkbright King didn’t expect that Ye Chen had been holding back. He had to admit that the latter’s sword will was above his martial will. With a snort, he unleashed his martial will, forming an incorporeal membrane and shielding his body.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>There was no heaven-shaking explosion, but Darkbright King’s body swayed and took half a step back. On the other side, Ye Chen didn’t budge from his place.</p><p>Darkbright King’s face showed a trace of humiliation and anger. Although his aura and martial will were not at the peak, they were not weak either. But, he still lost to Ye Chen. This made his face turn unsightly, as if he’d been slapped in the face,</p><p>“You’re courting death!” Darkbright King spoke through his teeth. His face turned grim, and a shining black glow covered his right arm. The temperature gradually rose, an indication of the Darkbright Fist.</p><p>“Darkbright King is going to act…But this is Glorious Exchanges!”</p><p>Everybody was astonished.</p><p>“I’ll accompany you till the end.”</p><p>Ye Chen’s figure didn’t move, but the Evil Vanquishing Sword on his waist clanked.</p><p>“What do you think you’re doing!”</p><p>Just as the two were about to battle, the management of Glorious Exchanges finally made an appearance. From the entrance of the staircase, an old man accompanied by three middle-aged men headed over. The old man was dressed luxuriously and had the highest cultivation base amongst the three—high stage of half-step King realm.</p><p>The speaker was precisely the old man.</p><p>The old man swiftly walked over with a gloomy face and spoke, “This is Glorious Exchanges, not your battleground.”</p><p>“So its chief steward He!”</p><p>The black glow covering Darkbright King’s right hand dimmed and he placed his hands back, revealing an unsightly smile.</p><p>“You’re still not backing off?” The old man glanced at Ye Chen with a sharp gaze.</p><p>“You only need a glance to tell that he was about to act.”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng found the old man’s attitude too overbearing. Ye Chen didn’t even draw his sword. He was being impartial toward Darkbright King.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Ye Chen coldly looked at Darkbright King, then glanced at the old man. The Evil Vanquishing Sword was drawn by an inch, then fiercely slammed in, arousing an ear-piercing sword cry as if glass was being cut by a sharp blade.</p><p>The old man’s face turned ashen. Although Ye Chen had not spoken, his conduct was undoubtedly a provocation.</p><p>“What the hell is happening?” The old man turned his head toward Darkbright King.</p><p>Darkbright smiled coldly, “This kid doesn’t know his own good. He actually tried snatching my treasure. How could this old man keep his mouth closed? I said a few words to him, but to think that he was so extreme. He directly tried to battle me. If not for this place, I would have already killed him.”</p><p>“You really know how to run your mouth off. This Shadow Armor has already been purchased by me. You tried to snatch it. Don’t tell me Glorious Exchanges allows others to snatch their treasures?” Murong Qingcheng’s face was chilly.</p><p>Ye Chen said indifferently, “Everybody here can testify it.”</p><p>“Testify? Who will testify for you?” Darkbright King couldn’t help a smile creeping on his face as he swept his gaze around.</p><p>All those under his gaze immediately avoided his gaze. Although they were no cowards, they didn’t wish to offend Darkbright King for others either. If one wished to live long and well, some matters were not to be touched.</p><p>Ultimately, his gaze fell on the seller of the shadow armor.</p><p>The old seller didn’t avoid his gaze and calmly said, “These old bones are only selling a treasure. Whoever gives me spirit stones, this armor is theirs.”</p><p>“Whoever pays spirit stones? She hasn’t paid you yet, right?” Darkbright King revealed a smile, as if the situation was already in his grasp.</p><p>“Right, but I’ve already agreed to the sale.”</p><p>The old man was in a hurry and didn’t wish for an accident. But at the same time, he wouldn’t betray his conscience either. Thus, he could only tell the truth.”</p><p>“You can rest assured that I’ll pay as much as she agreed, and five hundred thousand upper grade spirit stones on top.”</p><p>Darkbright King saw the Shadow Armor yesterday but didn’t have enough spirit stones on him, lacking ten million. In order to obtain the armor, he mobilized all his connections and borrowed a good amount of spirit stones, eventually scrapping thirty four million an hour ago. But, he was infuriated to find that somebody was one step ahead of him, about to snatch the armor away right before his eyes. This was the reason he was so furious.</p><p>“This doesn’t seem proper, does it?” The old man seemed troubled.</p><p>“There is nothing improper about it. You’ve still not completed the transaction. This is not against the rules of Glorious Exchanges, is it?” Darkbright King glanced at the old man in luxurious robes.</p><p>The latter glanced at Ye Chen and nodded faintly, “As long as no rule is violated, there is no problem. Since Darkbright King is giving five hundred thousand more, why don’t you sell it to him?”</p><p>The old man was the chief steward of Glorious Exchanges, with a strength nearing the ‘strongest’ half-step Kings. Be it for the sake of personal or public relations, he didn’t wish to clash with the Darkbright King. Moreover, Ye Chen’s arrogant and unyielding attitude just now had pissed him off. Thus, he showed a slight bias for Darkbright King.</p><p>Ye Chen sucked in a deep breath and said to Murong Qingcheng, “Murong, give him thirty four million and five hundred thousand. We’re leaving.”</p><p>Hearing these words, Murong Qingcheng directly ignored the two and put the armor away, then took out a low grade spirit ring that she had instantly prepared and handed it over to the old seller.</p><p>“You…” Darkbright King’s eyes seemed on the verge of popping out.</p><p>The old man thoroughly checked the spirit ring and nodded, “Not one less.” At the same time, he sent a Zhen Yuan transmission to Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng, “I apologize Sir and Madam. This old man has a pressing matter and doesn’t wish to provoke Darkbright King. I’ll return the extra spirit stones privately back to you.”</p><p>Ye Chen replied, “I understand your difficulties. You don’t need to return anything. The Shadow Armor is deserving of the price.”</p><p>“Many thanks, then.” The old man was somewhat grateful.</p><p>“Treasures can burn hands. You think you can leave just like that?”</p><p>Darkbright King had spent a great deal of effort for this armor, and now it was going away before his eyes. Even a person with much better attitude would not have been able to endure it.</p><p>“Glorious Exchanges indeed fears the strong and bullies the weak.” Ye Chen sent a mocking glance towards the head steward.</p><p>The latter’s face turned even more unsightly and growled at Darkbright King, “Don’t be rash. Not here.”</p><p>Huff Huff Huff!</p><p>The Darkbright King took a few deep breaths but didn’t act in the end. He could disregard the face of the head steward, but not Glorious Exchanges’. If he killed here, it would be him breaking the rules.</p><p>“Rest assured, as long as they’re in Gemstone Islands, you’ll get your hands on the armor sooner or later, and you won’t have to pay at that moment.” The old man turned around and left with the three middle-aged men, leaving behind these words.</p><p>“We’re leaving as well.”</p><p>Ye Chen held Murong Qingcheng’s hand and headed toward the exit. At the staircase, Ye Chen turned around, “Surely you won’t give up on the armor. We’ll be waiting.”</p><p>At this point, words had no use. Some affairs must be settled with strength. If Darkbright King didn’t come asking for trouble, it would be good for him. Otherwise, he would be seeking his own doom.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
