Buzz!</p><p>Being assaulted by a sword Qi blast that almost felt substantial, the black-robed old man’s eyes shrunk into two dots, “Supreme grade sword! It’s a supreme grade sword! Only a supreme grade sword can let out such an aura. Moreover, this is not an ordinary supreme grade sword either!”</p><p>The black-robed old man’s heart leaped. Although he was not a sword user, there was no harm in keeping it as a means of attack. Taking a step back, if he got his hands on this sword, he could easily trade it for something else with other Kings.</p><p>“Kid, hand over the sword and I’ll leave you an intact corpse.” The black-robed old man took a deep breath and said grimly.</p><p>“If you want it, you’ll have to ask it first!”</p><p>Ye Chen raised the sword with both hands and a purple radiance gushed out, basking the surroundings in a purple glow. Countless slender purple crystals condensed. Although all were purple, they carried different tints—purple red, purple yellow, purple green, purple gold, and so on. It represented different Yuan Qi of the heaven and earth crystallizing.</p><p>“One of the ten mystical metals, Purple Crystal Iron!” Seeing Sky Scorpio Sword’s mystical appearance, the old man’s heartbeat increased further. Purple Crystal Iron was incomparably rare. A sword forged with such rarity increased its worth by at least thirty percent.</p><p>“It’s mine!”</p><p>The old man’s body approached Ye Chen like a ghost. His two palms glowed with a black golden color, as if wishing to take the sword from the latter’s hands.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The old man’s speed was too quick, but Ye Chen closed his eyes and slashed at the void by relying on his soul power and intuition. As a result, the sword collided with the palms.</p><p>Spiritual Sword!</p><p>The Sky Scorpio Sword hit, but at the same time, a boundless power was transmitted into Ye Chen’s body through it. With a ‘whoosh’ sound, Ye Chen was blasted off as purple fist energy blast originated before him.</p><p>The black-robed old man didn’t budge an inch. However, a dim bloody scar appeared on his arm. From the scar, a dim purple crystal layer spread out, as if wishing to cover his whole arm. Even the blood within had been permeated.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>Powerful Zhen Yuan poured into his palm, shattering the crystal layer and expelling it while the black-robed old man licked his lips, “Such a powerful crystallizing energy…It can even threaten me!”</p><p>If Ye Chen didn’t have mid half-step King cultivation base but was at first layer or second layer of life-and-death-chamber, even he might have trouble expelling this power. After all, this power was too strange. It seemed as if it could crystallize anything under the heavens.</p><p>Being forced dozens of li back, Ye Chen’s two hands ached greatly. The power of a Demonic Human King was too strong. Even separated by Sky Scorpio Sword, his arms suffered such a pressure. If it had been the Evil Vanquishing Sword, his arms would have likely snapped off.</p><p>“A pity that you’re not worthy of such a sword!”</p><p>The black-robed man attacked once again. This time, however, his body-arts seemed to have already surpassed the realm of ghosts and spirits. One could only see faint flickering in the void. As for why he wasn’t trying to forcefully kill Ye Chen directly, the latter couldn’t tell. Perhaps he was playing a game of cat-and-mouse, trying to steal the sword from his hands first.</p><p>One into ten, ten into hundred, hundred into thousand…the images of black-robed old man covered the sky, flickering incessantly. It seemed as if the sky had been covered by a black curtain, and the black-robed old man’s figure was teleporting on this curtain.</p><p>“Soul Eye, open!”</p><p>Ye Chen’s soul power could no longer keep up with the black-robed old man. In his perception, everything was covered by the other. A chill leaked out of his body before his silver eye opened. Ye Chen again closed his two eyes, substituting them with the silver eye.</p><p>The world of the third eye was a world of silver. In this silver world, the black-robed old man turned increasingly slow, eventually lowering to the level of Ye Chen’s reaction speed. At this moment, Ye Chen seemed to be watching a movie. However, the person in the movie could come out at any point and kill him.</p><p>“Eh, another ability?”</p><p>The black-robed old man found too many mysteries on Ye Chen’s body. Sword Domain, Sky Scorpio Sword, Soul Eye…He wished to know what would Ye Chen bring out on the verge of death. This was the reason he was not directly killing Ye Chen. In any case, he felt that Sky Scorpio Sword was already in his hands. How could a cooked duck fly away? If it could, it would no longer be cooked duck.</p><p>Without a sound, the black-robed old man appeared before Ye Chen and made a grab.</p><p>“I was waiting.”</p><p>Although Ye Chen’s reaction speed was inferior to the black-robed old man, his soul eyes allowed him to prematurely prepare for his movements. As soon as the black-robed old man arrived, he issued an already prepared slash. It was Waning Moon—Waning Moon with the Sky Scorpio Sword.</p><p>A purple black crescent moon that looked like a slender crystal layer collided with the black-robed old man’s palm. Huge amounts of purple crystals erupted as if somebody had set off purple fireworks. Amidst the crystals, the two figures rapidly retreated.</p><p>Huff!</p><p>Heavily gasping, Ye Chen popped three more pills into his mouth. From the very start of the battle, Ye Chen had never stopped taking pills. He had already taken ten, leaving him with only the final two. This was the only reason he could use Sky Scorpio Sword twice.</p><p>He felt the Zhen Yuan in his body rapidly regenerating. The silver eye on his forehead unwaveringly watched the black-robed old man, not daring to relax in the slightest.</p><p>Dozens of li away, more than of black-robed old man’s Protective Zhen Yuan had been crystallized. Moreover, his right hand and right arm were covered in a layer of purple frost, issuing popping sounds.</p><p>“Such a powerful sword.”</p><p>The black-robed old man didn’t seem to care about his arm at all. His body shook, expelling countless little crystal shards; the crystallizing power simply couldn’t invade his body. This was the disparity of cultivation bases. It couldn’t be supplemented, not even by a supreme grade sword.</p><p>“Still not enough?”</p><p>Ye Chen’s brows creased. This was the first time he had felt so hopeless. He hadn’t felt so hopeless even when he was at Clasping Yuan realm cultivation base, facing Jin Huang Daoist of Hanging Mountain. This despair was not just a despair from soul, but also the dwindling of battle intent.</p><p>“Even if there is no hope, I will create hope.”</p><p>Slashing the negative state of his mind, Ye Chen’s gaze sharpened once again. It seemed as if he had broken through a limit, reaching a new height.</p><p>“Still not dead? That’s fine too. It won’t be any fun otherwise.” The black-robed old man was a Demonic Human King. Killing a lower realm person instantly gave him no pleasure at all, as it was the same as stepping on an ant. Who could care about that? However, if this ant was extremely unusual, one would want to play with it first.</p><p>“Bewitching Mirror Shattering!”</p><p>Just as the black-robed old man spoke, Ye Chen slashed out, and the entire sky was dyed purple. The rapid space contortion instantly reached the black-robed old man, who found himself locked into another world. If the previous Bewitching Mirror Shattering was a mirror, this was like huge purple crystal screen.</p><p>“Shatter!”</p><p>Ye Chen growled, and his entire Zhen Yuan was swept clean by Sky Scorpio Sword.</p><p>With a ‘peng’, the purple screen shattered. The black-robed old man inside also shattered into millions of pieces like specks of light scattering away.</p><p>“This is not right!”</p><p>Popping the final two pills into his mouth, Ye Chen rapidly retreated.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>A huge protrusion appeared where Ye Chen had been standing before a huge crater appeared in the space. At the edges of the crater, huge cracks extended into space like a mirror. At some point, the black-robed old man had escaped the Bewitching Mirror Shattering and counterattacked.</p><p>“It would have been so much better if you were a demonic human.” The black-robed had never encountered a genius like Ye Chen. Be it profound martial skills, sword will, innate skill, battle prowess, or reaction speed, he was exceptional. Although the two perfect vessel demonic human geniuses of Demonic Human Clan were outstanding, it was the superiority of bloodline. In terms of talent and comprehension, they were far lacking compared to Ye Chen.</p><p>“Bewitching Mirror Shattering couldn’t trap him?”</p><p>Far away, Ye Chen’s face turned unsightly. The scene just now was evidently fake. The black-robed old man was not sealed in the purple screen at all, most likely entering the void at the last moment. Although Bewitching Mirror Shattering could influence the void to some extent due to Sky Scorpio Sword, it was evidently quite weak, and not able to affect the black-robed old man.</p><p>One could even say that the difference between half-step Kings and Life-and-Death Kings was more than just that of cultivation base. The biggest difference was the ability to pierce the void.</p><p>“A pity you’re not my clansman!” The black-robed old man’s abruptly chilled as he began to leak a killing intent. This time, he had decided to end the matter. He was sure that Ye Chen couldn’t have any more ace left.</p><p>Seeing the killing intent from black-robed old man, Ye Chen’s face strangely eased. The two pills had restored his Zhen Yuan to seventy percent. Next, he again unlocked the Dragon God Medal. Large amounts of Zhen Yuan poured into his body, replenishing ninety percent of his Zhen Yuan.</p><p>“I indeed can’t beat you…But it can.” His storage bag flickered and an ink painting appeared in his right hand, which then unfolded with a ruffle and fluttered in the air.</p><p>“This is…?” The black-robed old man looked at the painting in Ye Chen’s hand. At the center of the painting stood a person on the summit. One could only see his back, looking majestic and graceful.</p><p>At that moment, Ye Chen poured Zhen Yuan into the painting.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>With that, a strange scene occurred. As soon as Ye Chen poured Zhen Yuan, the painting came to life. The summits gained substance and the painting gained depth. Plants and vegetation gained life, and clothes of the figure on the summit fluttered, seeming as if about to pop out of the painting.</p><p>The figure turned around. His face was indistinct, but eyes were bizarrely resonant. His gaze, which seemed to be capable of seeing through anything in the world, landed on the old man’s body.</p><p>Gudong!</p><p>The black-robed old man’s heart leaped. The former’s gaze left the painting and landed on his body, and the moment it did, he actually felt a strange suppression.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
