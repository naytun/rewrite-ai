The first bidder immediately increased the price by two hundred thousand, aiming to awe others. Unfortunately, nobody was intimidated. Merely the market price of the grass was three hundred thousand. It was an essential herb for the preparation of attacking half-step King realm. How could a mere two hundred thousand dissuade anyone?</p><p>“One million.” Yue Bingxin’s sister-in-law Yue Lingshuang raised her hand.</p><p>“One million one hundred thousand.” The bidder was the young lord of Golden Lion Clan, Shi Shaobao.</p><p>“A million and two hundred thousand.” Huang Mei also joined in.</p><p>Ye Chen was also intending to join in, but seeing Huang Mei’s interest, he eventually decided against it. She had helped him once in the Mysterious Yin Pagoda, so he would not participate if she were determined to win. Of course, if she gave up willingly, he would bid.</p><p>“A million and four hundred thousand.” This time, the bidder was none other than the chief steward of Glorious Exchanges.</p><p>“Two million.” As Silvemoon Whitefox Clan’s genius of a millenium, Yue Lingshuang’s wealth was certainly nothing to scoff at.</p><p>“Humph! Three million!” Shi Shaobao sneered and directly raised the bid by a million.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng had no intention of joining in as she smiled and said, “Seems like this Heart Protecting Flower is going to sell at a sky high price.”</p><p>“Rarer a treasure, the greater its value is. Heart Protecting Flower is a semi-supreme treasure, but its price is far above that.” Ye Chen said.</p><p>“Five million.” Huang Mei resolutely increased by two million with a faint smile, stunning everybody.</p><p>Five million upper grade spirit stones was not a commonly seen number. The majority of half-step Kings didn’t have such wealth. Although the Heart Protecting Flower could increase one’s chances of entering half-step King realm, thus greatly increasing its value for sects, one had to carefully consider if five million upper grade stones could actually create more half-step Kings. After all, the Heart Protecting Flower was not needed by everybody to enter half-step King realm. For example, if Ye Chen had not been in a hurry to enter half-step King realm, he could have easily waited for a few months or a year. Such a duration meant nothing to Sea of Soul realm experts.</p><p>Therefore, even someone as arrogant as Shi Shaobao gave up, finding the deal unworthy. Yue Lingshuang didn’t bid again either, just curiously glancing toward Huang Mei.</p><p>“Five million and a hundred thousand.” The Old Steward didn’t wish to give up and said with clenched teeth.</p><p>“Five million five hundred thousand.” Huang Mei bid calmly.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Letting out a sigh, the old steward leaned back in his chair, no longer increasing the bid.</p><p>“Five million five hundred thousand one, five million five hundred thousand two, five million five hundred thousand three, sold!” The host slammed the table with excitement. It was not every day that a Heart Protecting Flower could fetch five million five hundred thousand in an auction. It had indeed exceeded his expectations.</p><p>None of the following few items went beyond that figure. Their bids were far below that number, calming down the auction’s atmosphere somewhat.</p><p>“The forty-second artifact is a peak upper grade artifact set, including an armor, leg guards, boots, and hand guards. Starting price is two million fifty thousand upper grade spirit stones.”</p><p>Another heavy-weight appeared after the Heart Protecting Flower.</p><p>A mere peak upper grade artifact was not enough to catch the attention of half-step Kings. However, when it came to a complete set, it became a different matter. In defense, they were superior to most of the semi-supreme grade artifacts. In addition, a full set covered many aspects such as speed, attack speed, and offensive power.</p><p>“Three million.”</p><p>Sure enough, a lot of half-step Kings were moved. They didn’t have a pseudo supreme grade artifact. Thus, the next option was naturally a peak upper grade artifact set.</p><p>“Three million five hundred thousand.”</p><p>“Four million.”</p><p>In the end, the artifact set was snatched by a half-step King for a price of six million.</p><p>…</p><p>“Forty eighth item is the Purple Flame Demonic Light Gloves, a semi-supreme grade artifact made as an imitation of one of the three most reputed supreme grade gloves of the past hundred thousand years, the Flaming Godlight Gloves. Purple Flame Demonic Light Gloves have flame and dark power, making them one the best offensive artifacts among semi-supreme grade artifacts, and frankly, better than the majority of pseudo supreme grade artifacts. Starting price is eight million upper grade spirit stones. Every bid should at least raise by five hundred thousand. Begin!”</p><p>If a set of peak upper artifact could be considered a heavyweight, this Purple Flame Demonic Light Glove was a super heavyweight. Just the fact that it was better than the majority of pseudo supreme grade artifacts was enough to send half-step Kings into a frenzy, not to mention this pair of gloves also contained flame power and dark power.</p><p>As soon as the host’s voice trailed off, Darklight King spoke loudly, “Ten million.”</p><p>“What? Darklight King is also joining the bidding? Didn’t he already have a set of pseudo supreme grade pair of gloves?”</p><p>Everybody was astonished.</p><p>“You are not aware that Darklight King only has one glove, and not a complete pair. Moreover, the Purple Flame Demonic Light Glove contains the flame and dark power, and Darklight King also cultivates fire Zhen Yuan. So tell me, how could he not join the bidding war?”</p><p>“I see. In that case, these gloves are more or less his.”</p><p>“That’s about it.”</p><p>Be it individual strength or identity, Darklight King was far above ordinary people. Even if he didn’t threaten one, they still couldn’t compete with him. Who knew if he got offended and sought a chance to kill and take away the gloves anyway.</p><p>A few individuals who originally had thoughts about the gloves immediately turned silent when Darklight King bid.</p><p>“Murong, seems like we’re against the Darklight King yet again.” Ye Chen couldn’t help but smile.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng similarly smiled and raised her hand, “Twelve million.”</p><p>“You again!” Darklight King fiercely glared at Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>“What happened? You don’t want to play?” Ye Chen flicked his finger.</p><p>“Humph, fifteen million!”</p><p>Darklight King raised his head high. He currently had thirty four million upper grade spirit stones, while his enemy had already spent more than thirty million. He didn’t believe that he would still lose to Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>“Sixteen million.”</p><p>The bidder this time was not Murong Qingcheng, but a tall, sturdy, square-faced man. This man’s arm was unusually long and palms thick. One could tell at a glance that his arm techniques were bound to be formidable.</p><p>“Red Flame King…it’s getting lively!”</p><p>The square-faced big man was also reputed in the Gemstone Islands, considered as one of the few powerful experts under ‘strongest’ half-step Kings, the same as Ye Chen and the team organized by Jin Wanshuang, if not a bit stronger. He was determined to go against Darklight King. After all, such a treasure could only be chanced upon and not sought. If he could get his hands on this pair of gloves, his strength would surely soar to new heights.</p><p>“Eighteen Million.”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng didn’t have certainty as to how high the price would go. She felt that twenty million should be the bottom line of these people.</p><p>“Nineteen Million.” Darklight King hesitated for a bit and then raised.</p><p>“Nineteen million five hundred thousand.” Red Flame King increased merely by five hundred thousand.</p><p>“Twenty Million,” Murong Qingcheng raised again.</p><p>“Damn it!” Darklight King glanced at Murong Qingcheng and his eyes gleamed, no longer bidding again. Ye Chen observed him and naturally knew that he had not truly given up. He was planning to kill them and obtain the gloves that way.</p><p>“Twenty million five hundred thousand.” Red Million King gnashed his teeth. His whole wealth only amounted to eighteen million, and including the treasures on his body, he had thirty million upper grade spirit stones at most. His limit had already been reached. After making his bid, he fiercely glared at Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>“Twenty one million.” Murong Qingcheng said indifferently.</p><p>Huff!</p><p>He let out a deep breath from his furious face, no longer bidding.</p><p>“Twenty one million one, twenty one million two, twenty one million three, sold! Congratulations to the lady over there!” The host fiercely slammed the table. Soon, somebody came to deliver the gloves, taking twenty million upper grade spirit stones from her.</p><p>“I’ll let you remove the soul imprint!”</p><p>If Murong Qingcheng were to remove the imprint by herself, it would take her several days, However, if Ye Chen did it, it would take merely around fifteen minutes. Ye Chen was able to remove soul imprints of half-step Kings while being in late Sea of Soul realm within a short time span. Upon reaching half-step King realm himself, although his soul power had not progressed in power at all, its intensity had increased by several folds.</p><p>Ye Chen decided to let her wear the gloves without any delay.</p><p>The Purple Flame Demonic Light Glove was a pair of gloves with a purple texture and gold-veined lines integrated in between. It felt soft and slippery on touch, not having much weight. A purple-colored flower design floated on the back of the glove. As the streams of light fluttered, it seemed to be blazing, looking mystical.</p><p>Taking the Purple Flame Demonic Light, Ye Chen poured his soul power in, wiping off the already existing soul imprint inside. He was done before fifteen minutes passed.</p><p>Taking the Purple Flame Demonic Light, Murong Qingcheng gradually imprinted his own soul imprint. Only by branding her own soul imprint could she exhibit the might of these gloves to the fullest.</p><p>As the two were busy with the gloves, several items had already been auctioned off.</p><p>“Fifty second item, a Sword Casting Art’s jade strip.” The host took a deep breath, the host spoke loudly.</p><p>“Sword Casting Art!” Ye Chen squinted, his eyes gleaming.</p><p>The host continued, “This Sword Casting Art’s jade strip contains all the information from lower-grade artifacts to semi-supreme grade artifacts, and even a little about supreme grade artifacts. If you piece other knowledge fro, forging a supreme grade artifact is not entirely impossible.”</p><p>“What! Even partial knowledge of supreme grade artifact forging is included!” Everybody on the scene was stunned.</p><p>In the ancient era, the forging art was quite developed. But with the passage of time, most of this knowledge had been lost. In the modern era, the knowledge of forging swords was only limited to semi-supreme grade artifacts. Although the knowledge of forging supreme grade artifacts was not entirely lost, only a few people knew it.</p><p>“Of course! In case somebody defames Golden Island Auction later, I say it once again—the knowledge this strip has about forging of supreme grade sword is extremely limited.” The host didn’t dare boast too much. There were many in audience with deep backgrounds. If he boasted too much, those powers would certainly come looking for the auction.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
