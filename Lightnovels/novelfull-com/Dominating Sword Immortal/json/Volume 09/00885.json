Evolving his fifth step Destruction Sword Intent to the sixth step was not hard for Ye Chen; it was only a matter of time. But, this moment of life-and-death allowed him to save quite a bit of time.</p><p>Chop!</p><p>Counteracting the masked-man’s ace with a swing of his sword, Ye Chen sucked in a deep breath. The Destruction Sword Soul inside his Sea of Soul vibrated, and a peerless sword intent gushed out from every section within his body. Ye Chen could faintly hear a groan coming from Fire Star Poison, and it became increasingly indistinct until it could no longer be heard.</p><p>Cutting off Star Fire Poison’s vitality, Ye Chen’s entire being greatly relaxed. He raised his right index finger; a small cut opened at its tip, and a purple red fluid flowed out of it. As soon as it touched the ground, numerous small, burnt-black holes opened in the ground with scorching red flames erupting within.</p><p>“You had Star Fire Poison!” The masked man spoke as he recovered his bearing and looked at this scene, “Killing the active nature of Star Fire Poison with sixth step Destruction Sword Intent…seems like you’re quite knowledgeable.”</p><p>“The feeling is mutual.”</p><p>Curbing his delight, Ye Chen’s expression calmed down. Despite his Destruction Sword Intent increasing ten folds in might, he’d no confidence in defeating his opponent. The latter’s Zhen Yuan seemed much purer and richer than Poison Fire King, while his profound was already in high stages—a whole level above his Congealing Water. If not for the supreme grade Sky Scorpio Sword, he had no chance against him even with sixth step Destruction Sword Intent.</p><p>“Kid, humility will not save your life.”</p><p>The masked man shot across as his two palms thrust out at Ye Chen repeatedly with such speed that they seemed illusory. Extremely dense fire and lightning flew off every palm strike, looking like dense waters, which clearly indicated the masked man’s high proficiency in lightning profound and fire profound.</p><p>But, despite being short-stacked in both profound martial skills and Zhen Yuan, Ye Chen had the Sky Scorpio Sword and Destruction Sword Intent. Holding the purple beast longsword, Ye Chen neither retreated nor dodged as he met the masked-man head-on.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>Fire lightning and sword Qi splattered. Wherever the two went, everything around dozens of li was completely razed to the ground. And this was because they were fighting in Bloodlight Ocean; if it had been outside, even a distance of thousand li would not have remained unaffected.</p><p>“Thunder Fire, Three Layered Sky!” The masked-man roared as he thrust his palm out and his arm shook thrice.</p><p>“Not good! A layered assault!” Ye Chen didn’t expect that the masked-man would have such skill despite having the strength of a mid step King. How could he have known that the masked man was merely a consciousness projection. Although his strength was only equal to usual mid step Kings, the battle strength he could exhibit was far above usual mid step Kings.</p><p>“Soul Light!”</p><p>Ye Chen’s forehead parted and a silver beam shot out, aiming at the masked-man’s forehead. At the same time, he raised his sword to defend, retreating with the borrowed momentum.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lightning and fire covered the sky while Ye Chen’s mouth corners were leaking streams of blood. The injuries he’d sustained were not light at all.</p><p>Of course, the masked-man was not in too good a shape either. As a mere consciousness projection, all his soul power was borrowed from his main body, and was not stable at all. Being struck by the soul light, all the soul power inside his brain instantly slackened, causing a burst of dizziness in his body.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The masked man was appalled. Ye Chen’s Soul Light was exceptionally effective on him. If he couldn’t settle this fight within a short time, he would not have the chance later on.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>His figure pounced forth, soaring in the air and issuing the second wave of Thunder Fire Three Layered Sky Ye Chen’s way.</p><p>“Seal for me!”</p><p>Still pulling the distance from his opponent, Ye Chen raised the Sky Scorpio Sword, sealing the masked-man within a purple crystalline mirror, which caused one of the three layers to vanish. Moreover, the remaining two layers were not perfectly superimposed.</p><p>“Damned Space Profound!” As a high-step King, the masked-man naturally knew the terror and mystique of space profound. Not only was it extremely powerful, it was also the most threatening.</p><p>The mirror shattered, inflicting countless cuts on the body of the masked-man. Ye Chen was astonished to see that no blood came out of the wounds, as if there was no flesh or vitality.</p><p>“It’s a consciousness projection!” Defending against the imperfect Thunder Fire Three Layered Sky, Ye Chen suddenly had the realization. “A mere consciousness projection has such battle strength. Then, doesn’t it mean that he is actually a high-step King?”</p><p>The difference between Kings themselves could be immense. Ordinary Kings were low step Kings, and the Kings with some achievements were mid-step Kings. However, further above them were high step Kings, peak Kings, and titled Monarchs. Ye Chen’s current strength barely reached mid step Kings’ level while the masked man was somewhat stronger than him. Thus, he was most likely a mid step King. As for his original body, it had to be a high-step King. With this information, his strong profounds didn’t seem surprising at all.</p><p>As the masked man’s wounds closed, his aura weakened. But at the same time, his killing intent soared.</p><p>“Thunderlight Fire Rain!” With his hands rapidly forming seals, the masked man roared.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The sky darkened, and countless thunderbolts shot down at Ye Chen amidst scarlet flames that poured down like rain. Dozens of li around them turned into an ocean of fire. At the center of the ocean of fire, the latter could feel his Protective Zhen Yuan unceasingly burning off. His Zhen Yuan was being rapidly consumed, further increasing with every lightning bolt strike.</p><p>“He is trying to exhaust my Zhen Yuan.”</p><p>In his battles with Kings, Ye Chen’s biggest weakness was his sparse Zhen Yuan, which greatly limited his use of Undying Body. At this moment, he only had fifty percent of his Zhen Yuan left. If this continued, it would continue to decrease and he would not be able to use Undying Body. At that point, he would truly die.</p><p>“However, he can’t be feeling good either. Hit by my Soul Light, his soul power should be about to disperse. This battle is now a contest of endurance.”</p><p>After knowing that his opponent was a consciousness projection, Ye Chen also knew his opponent’s weakness.</p><p>“Extinguish!”</p><p>Amidst the surging ocean of fire, Ye Chen tried to dodge as many thunderbolts as he could, his figure twisting, turning, and soaring. After another flicker, the second silver colored light beam shot out of his forehead. The speed of soul light was too high, giving masked-man no time to dodge.</p><p>The other’s figure swayed unceasingly, and his body turned increasingly transparent. A large amount of soul power gushed uncontrollably out of his body, creating a soul power storm around him that could instantly kill any Astral Reaching expert. His body began loosening, leaking Zhen Yuan which diluted inside the normal Yuan Qi present in the air.</p><p>“Unfortunately, I can only use Soul Light twice.” Ye Chen was sure that the third Soul Light would have directly expelled all the soul power the masked man had.</p><p>“Take this too.” Incapable of using Soul Light further, Ye Chen thrust out Congealing Water sword energy with the Sky Scorpio Sword.</p><p>“If you can survive this move, your life will be spared today.” The masked man growled as the crumbling of his body suddenly stopped, no longer leaking soul power either.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>He thrust out his palm, shattering Ye Chen’s Congealing Water sword energy. His figure swayed for a moment, but the next instant, his entire being shot toward the latter in an unbridled manner, seeming as if he were trying to perish along with his opponent.</p><p>“Is he trying to die together? No…Wven if self exploded, it won’t kill me. Most probably, he is using a powerful move.”</p><p>Not daring to be careless, Ye Chen pushed Sword Domain to its limits, causing the space to tighten excessively. Anything trying to approach Ye Chen would have to use twice as much power now.</p><p>“Seal!”</p><p>Bewitching Mirror Shattering sealed the masked man again. However, the masked man’s speed exploded forth, but at the same time, his body started loosening again. His speed increased to an absurd degree, turning his body illusory.</p><p>“Thunder Fire Four Layered Sky!”</p><p>If it were masked man’s original body, he could have used the four layered assault with ease. However, using it with his consciousness projection, he had to pay the price of perishing along with his opponent. Thus, he didn’t use this move unless necessary.</p><p>How frightening were four layers of palm energies superimposed, Ye Chen couldn’t even imagine.</p><p>“I can’t take a direct hit, or even if I don’t die, I’ll be left crippled.”</p><p>Within the scope of Sword Domain, innumerable cyan-colored swords condensed. Meanwhile, the Evil Shattering Sword and Blood Erosion Sword each divided into thirty three swords above his head, interweaving into two sword snakes.</p><p>However, all of it was to no avail, as the masked man’s palm strike was too powerful. All the cyan swords as well as the two sword snakes shattered, and the two swords were blasted off. The semi supreme grade Blood Erosion Sword, which was a bit lacking in quality, even lost its tip, emanating a dark light of death.</p><p>“Die for me!”</p><p>The masked man arrived before Ye Chen and thrust his palm out.</p><p>“Come!”</p><p>Pushing the Green Lotus Sword Arts to the limits, he poured a large amount of Zhen Yuan in Sky Scorpio Sword.</p><p>Crackle!</p><p>Thick frost covered the Sky Scorpio Sword, turning even thicker with each passing instant, finally turning into a whole crystal wall and defending Ye Chen’s body. The masked man’s palm landed on the crystal wall, and the four-layered palm energy erupted.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>A crystal shower covered the sky while Ye Chen was blasted off with his legs skidding off the ground, crashing into one mountain after another, his body shrouded in huge sparks.</p><p>“He should be dead!”</p><p>A faint smile appeared on the masked man’s face. Immediately afterward, his body scattered, and the mask on his face disintegrated into millions of splinters.</p><p>A few dozen li away, in the belly of a burn-black mountain, Ye Chen lay between life and death. After a while, the broken rocks shook and his arm rose from within. With the support of the hand, he finally climbed out.</p><p>Cough! Cough!</p><p>Blood flowed out of his mouth without a pause.</p><p>“That was close! If I hadn’t spent excessive Zhen Yuan to activate the crystal power of Sky Scorpio Sword, I would have died under that palm.” The crystal power of Sky Scorpio Sword came from Purple Crystal Iron. Usually, Ye Chen used Sky Scorpio Sword normally. But, the situation earlier on was too dangerous, leaving him with no choice but to activate the crystal power of the sword.</p><p>As a price, the crystal power of Sky Scorpio Sword had weakened.</p><p>“Restore!”</p><p>Discharging Zhen Yuan like water, Ye Chen rapidly healed his injuries. However, his injuries were so severe that his Zhen Yuan hit rock bottom before even half of his injuries were healed.</p><p>“I can’t stay here. Need to find a place to replenish my Zhen Yuan.”</p><p>The battle before had caused too big of a commotion, so Ye Chen didn’t dare stay anywhere near the battle site.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>With a flicker, Ye Chen flew out of the mountain’s belly and flew off in a random direction.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
