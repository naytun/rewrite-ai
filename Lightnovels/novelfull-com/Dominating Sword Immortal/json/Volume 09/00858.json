How is this possible?”</p><p>A moment ago, the Young Undying Demon Lord stood tall and proud, declaring that running into him was Ye Chen’s misfortune. However, he couldn’t have lost more wretchedly. It was such a huge contrast that he was almost driven mad. He could imagine Lashan Mei’s sneering face in his mind, which made him feel livid and humiliated.</p><p>His fingers dug deep into his palms, beads of blood trickling down his hands.</p><p>‘What an enormous sword pressure! What the hell was that ability?’</p><p>As a sword artist himself, Marquis Star Sword had keenly sensed the sword pressure emanating from Ye Chen at the crucial moment, and it made him exceptionally curious. However, the latter’s control over this ability was excellent, releasing and retracting it within an instant. Therefore, even he was not able to see through it, and could only guess.</p><p>“Sword pressure? Seems like you can’t go too near him.”</p><p>Marquis Sword Snow slightly creased his brows. Usually, sword pressure was produced only when a sword artist was attacking, and its scope and application was quite limited. However, a sword pressure emerging from the body? That was frightening!</p><p>“Junior brother Ye is junior brother Ye…His progress is astounding!” A smile appeared on Xu Jing’s face. In this world, she was the first person to feel the astonishing potential of Ye Chen. When the two were back in Sky Cloud Sect, she had predicted that he had the chance to become an unrivalled sword artist, and the current Ye Chen was not too far off from this goal.</p><p>There were a dozen candidates that were quite popular. Thus, two popular candidates running into each other was not too rare, and it usually ended up in a thrilling battle.</p><p>Tie Kuangzun, Tantai Mingyue…Two names shone on the stelle.</p><p>“It’s Tie Kuangzun! He still hasn’t revealed his complete demonic transformation. I wonder if Tantai Mingyue will be able to do it.”</p><p>“Among the popular ones, it’s hard to say if even half of them have revealed all of their moves.”</p><p>Tie Kuangzun had been quiet up to this moment, but nobody dared to look down on him. Complete Demonic Transformation was an absurd ability, and everybody had an apprehension toward it.</p><p>A battle between two hot characters was naturally quite intense.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>After exchanging a few dozen moves, Tie Kuangzun knew that he would not be able to do anything against Tantai Mingyue if he didn’t reveal all of his strength. Not wasting any time, he decisively underwent the Complete Demonic Transformation.</p><p>His muscles and bone protruded out; he turned into a slaughtering demonic human within an instant, increasing his speed and power to a new height.</p><p>“Kill!” He appeared before Tantai Mingyue in a blink of an eye and clawed out.</p><p>“Too fast!” Tantai Mingyue couldn’t dodge, and if she faced him head on, the fully transformed Tie Kuangzun was definitely a cut above her.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>Right at that moment, the space around her body warped and she disappeared. Consequently, Tie Kuangzun’s claw only found air.</p><p>“Space profound art!” Numerous people sighed.</p><p>Space profound was one of the strongest profounds, and it could be used in many ingenious ways. Merging space profound with body arts could allow one to teleport. In fact, teleportation actually depended on one’s comprehension of the space profound, as well as long and short profound.</p><p>Confronting Tantai Mingyue, who had grasped the space profound, Tie Kuangzuan could only lose even though his strength was a notch above.</p><p>“I obtained the fundamentals of space profound while Tantai Mingyue should have obtained a space profound movement art. I wonder what Jiang Tian and Xia Houzun received.” All four of them had a style of Void Shattering Finger, and thus, they had an advantage in the graveyard of Four Extremes Emperor.</p><p>Defeating Tie Kuangzuan, Tantai Mingyue’s fame rose to another level, and she immediately became another candidate to strive for the top five.</p><p>Following that, Lashan Mei confronted Marquis Sword Realm.</p><p>Lashan Mei’s blade arts were excessively powerful, whether the fight was at long-range or short-range. Marquis Sword Realm’s wind-style Storm Sword Realm was cleaved apart by her in a single strike, and Thunder Sword Realm was also deflected by her blade. In the end, she chopped down his body, clenching victory.</p><p>It was wave after wave of climaxes.</p><p>Fifth battle began—Dugu Jue against Young Snake Lord.</p><p>Although the latter had been defeated by Xu Jing with a single punch outside the palace, nobody believed that he was weak. Instead, it was Xu Jing who was excessively strong. Her strength most likely surpassed a million jins, not to mention her first place on vital Qi rankings.</p><p>Young Snake Lord was not weak, but Dugu Jue was not weak either. Anyhow, when two powerful experts confronted, there was bound to be a victor.</p><p>Dugu Jue’s blade arts gave off an aura brimming with despair and wickedness. Adding his head full of white hair, it made him seem like an evil god. Facing his blade arts, Young Snake Lord had to make retreat after retreat while feeling increasingly astounded.</p><p>“Nine Snakes Body Integration.”</p><p>Forced to his wits’ ends, Young Snake Lord revealed his ace that he had prepared to deal with the likes of Young Elephant Lord. This was a secret art that was actually not passed down in the half beast clan of Nine Head Snake. It had been researched that if one’s realm was not sufficient, this secret art actually harmed one’s own body somewhat, and would influence one’s future prospect. However, Young Snake Lord didn’t have to care about that at this moment because Life and Death Palace allowed him to use this secret art without any hesitation. So, how could he not make full use of this opportunity?</p><p>The nine snake phantoms rapidly shrunk and entered his body; in the next instant, his body released an intense beastly aura. This aura was exceptionally savage, and it increased to the extent of not being one bit inferior even when compared to the Young Elephant Lord.</p><p>“This is a Great Beast Secret art!” A term popped in Young Elephant Lord’s head.</p><p>The term Great Beast Secret Art was a collective term. These were secret arts that only demonic beasts or half-beasts with bestial bloodlines could cultivate. These secret arts could stimulate the bloodline power, causing one’s strength to sharply increase. If a demonic beast was the one using these, its innate skill could become many folds more powerful.</p><p>As a perfect half-beast, although Young Snake Lord only had half of Nine Head Snake’s bloodline, it was still quite considerable. The stimulation of Nine Head Snake Bloodline was suppressing his human bloodline.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Young Snake Lord’s entire body seemed to have lost all of its bones. Every movement he made seemed completely free of restrictions. Even if he were attacking from the front, he might appear right behind the other. His explosive power and flexibility had reached an absurd level.</p><p>Missing several of his blade strikes in succession, Dugu Jue fell into a disadvantageous position.</p><p>Coil!</p><p>Finding a gap, Young Snake Lord suddenly broke past Dugu Jue’s Protective Zhen Yuan and coiled his flexible body around the latter’s. He, who was only 1.8 meters tall, had turned three to four meters in size, seeming like a huge snake.</p><p>Being coiled around by a snake was actually a frightening matter. Only if one’s strength were much higher than the snake would he be able to free himself, or one could only be crushed to death. There was no third option.</p><p>“Evil Heart!”</p><p>At that moment, Dugu Jue suddenly closed his eyes. When he opened them in the next second, they were completely white, as if they could even suck souls in. At this moment, Young Snake Lord had only coiled halfway up to Dugu Jue’s body, and his head was at Dugu Jue’s chest level. So, when the latter looked down, the two’s eyes inevitably met for a moment.</p><p>Ah!</p><p>Young Snake Lord let out a miserable shriek. As if struck from a thunderbolt, his body rolled down Dugu Jue’s body. The latter expressionlessly raised his blade and chopped down, killing Young Snake Lord.</p><p>Dugu Jue’s victory!</p><p>As of this moment, except Marquis Sword Star, Lu Tiandu, and Young Elephant Lord, all the top ranks of the previous list had been beaten by the newcomers. This was something that rarely ever happened. Every time Life-and-Death Secret Realm, even the appearance of two or three exceptional young geniuses was rare. However, the number was far greater than two or three this time.</p><p>Princess Godshark, Sha Ruoqing against Lu Tiandu…</p><p>The latter was ranked second on the previous list, and his strength was simply immeasurable. Facing Princess Godshark’s frenzied assault, nine thick lightning dragons condensed outside body.</p><p>Nine Dragons Body Protector!</p><p>Sha Ruoqing’s attacks were unable to pierce through the Nine Dragons Body Protector, and she was soon defeated.</p><p>Next, Ye Chen finally found out what Jiang Tian obtained from the graveyard of Four Extremes Emperor: he had obtained a defensive space profound martial art. By relying on this art, he actually managed to force a draw against Marquis Star Sword in the first stage of their battle. However, there was, after all, a difference of a small realm between the two’s cultivation bases, and thus, the former was ultimately defeated.</p><p>“Space profound can assimilate and devour energy.” Ye Chen had a deep understanding of space profound.</p><p>At that moment, two names shone on the stelle once again—Ye Chen and Tantai Mingyue.</p><p>“Ye Chen, I know you have also obtained something related to space profound from Four Extremes Graveyard. Take it out, or you’ll lose to my spatial teleportation.” Tantai Mingyue was extremely confident in her spatial teleportation. After all, this was a high-level space profound movement art.</p><p>“If there is a need, I will.” Ye Chen faintly nodded.</p><p>“Alright, be careful then.”</p><p>Tantai Mingyue didn’t immediately use Spatial Teleportation. Her movements were soft and agile like sprinkling moonlight. En-route, she raised her palm and condensed a huge amount of moonlight in the palm. Giving of a brilliant splendor, the moonlight swept across noiselessly.</p><p>“Waning Moon!” Ye Chen swept his sword across. Splitting apart the moonlight, a chilling sword energy rapidly closed in on Tantai Mingyue’s body.</p><p>“Formless Moon Soul!”</p><p>Swish!</p><p>Tantai Mingyue’s body seemed to have turned into a formless moonlight that pierced through the sword energy and stopped not far away from Ye Chen, then issued sixty-four palm strikes that indistinctly formed a formation, trapping Ye Chen within. Subsequently, a large burst of moonlight erupted, seeming several folds brighter than the bright moon itself.</p><p>“Too slow!” Ye Chen had already arrived behind Tantai Mingyue’s body at some point and thrust his sword out.</p><p>“Not slow, it’s perfect!” Tantai Mingyue’s body dispersed and similarly appeared behind Ye Chen. With her corner of mouth curling in a smile, she palmed forward.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>Ye Chen’s body disintegrated, but there was no blood; it was actually a shadow doppelganger.</p><p>Ye Chen was aware that he could not lock onto Tantai Mingyue with Spatial Teleportation at her disposal unless he used the Bewitching Mirror Shattering. He didn’t have much of a chance of beating her in a short while; thus, he used a doppelganger to trick her.</p><p>If an ordinary person had been in this situation, they would have lost their head due to fear. However, the smile on Tantai Mingyue’s face didn’t diminish in the slightest. Her body also dispersed into moonlight, turning into countless specks of light. At some point, another her had appeared facing Ye Chen’s back.</p><p>Spectators were befuddled, but a sparse few were able to see through what happened. When Tantai Mingyue had first used Spatial Teleportation, she had left behind a moonlight doppelganger. She seemed to have anticipated that the Ye Chen before her was not real.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
