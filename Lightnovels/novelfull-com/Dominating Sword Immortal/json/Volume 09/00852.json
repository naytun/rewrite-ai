On the other hand, the Thunder Sword Realm was based on the thunder element, but required even more in terms of the thunder profound. If the profound did not reach its standard, then the thunder realm would have a lot of flaws, and its power would not reach its limit.</p><p>Even the Sword Realm Artist did not know where the limit of the Thunder Sword Realm attack lay. If he wanted to push his Thunder Sword Realm to its limit, then the thunder profound would need to reach full completion. However, he had only understood ninety percent of it. Of course, he had improved a lot since ten years ago, when he was only at seventy percent.</p><p>Even though the thunder profound was only at ninety percent and not yet at full completion, combined with his thunder sword realm, its power was beyond normal third level life and death challenge warriors. Once he performed his Sword Realm, the whole world seemed to be filled with thunder roars. An endless amount of thunder yuan qi accumulated onto the Sword Realm, transforming it completely.</p><p>Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop!</p><p>The space continued to shatter and the thunder Sword Realm was like a beam of lightning as it attacked Ye Chen.</p><p>“Such a powerful Sword Realm…I am afraid even the sword snake spell cannot compete with it.”</p><p>The Defensive sword spell contained a lot of attacking sword styles. The Massive Sword Spell in the early stages was one of the simpler tricks, and the sword snake spell would require an ability to perform thirty-three sword attacks, which was the same as the Wind Sword Realm. The Sword Snake Spell actually also contained some Sword Realm mechanism, just that it did not work with a specific element.</p><p>“if one sword snake spell might not be enough, then I will perform two.”</p><p>Thoughts went through Ye Chen’s mind quickly as he reached out his index and middle fingers together, and pointed toward the Thunder Sword Realm.</p><p>Chin! Chin!</p><p>The Broken Blood Sword and another half extreme rank great sword came out of their scabbards automatically and turned into thirty-three beams of sword shadows each. They then combined together and formed into a formation of two sword snakes shining with a cold light. Looking from afar, it was like two massive silvery snakes intertwined as they attacked out, the sword tinging sound filling up the space.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The sword spell clashed with the two snakes, causing the space to twist and shatter all of a sudden. The resultant sword light turned the whole valley into a big flat ground. Some of the most powerful sword lights had left massive gaps on the ground like the Great Canyon. High in the air, thunder and lightning continued to shoot out everywhere, turning the whole place into a chaotic, dangerous place.</p><p>The Thunder Sword Realm was Sword Realm Artist’s most powerful Sword Realm after all, and Ye Chen’s sword snake spell alone would find it rather hard to compete with it. The thunder light dimmed down, but it managed to break through layers after layers of obstacles and continued to move its way toward Ye Chen, bringing that bright electronic light on its tails.</p><p>“The Sword Realm indeed lives up to its reputation!”</p><p>Shaking his head, Ye Chen held onto his Evil Shattering sword with his right hand and took it out all of a sudden. A black broken moon shaped sword power landed onto the Sword Realm, aggressively slicing through the Sword Realm.</p><p>Splash!</p><p>The swords with endless lightning around them continued to fly in the air, half of them having cracks on them now.</p><p>“Come back!”</p><p>The Sword Realm Artist was shocked and then got furious as he hurried to call back all of his thunder element great swords. With all of them being back, he took a look at them before cursing angrily, “Damn it!” Out of thirty-six of them, thirteen of them showed cracks and had their light dimmed.</p><p>“Impossible! Sword Realm Artist’s thunder Sword Realm was shattered?” Massive Sword Artist could not believe his eyes and his mouth could not be closed.</p><p>“He can perform the defensive sword spell at the same time! Where did this guy come from? And that last sword attack, it was almost as fast as Moon Cut!” Short Sword Artist said seriously.</p><p>Over at True Spirit continent side, the bulky young man took a deep breath. “Unbelievable! That is indeed unbelievable! No wonder the title of the most legendary martial genius landed on Ye Chen ever since Mysterious Queen, instead of Dugu Jue and Dantai Mingyue. Before when he was just a rank 9 martial institution disciple, he had already never faced a loss. Once he reached the Heaven Martial Region, he had overpowered so many other top martial geniuses. Now, he has finally reached the top, and it has only been a couple of years. I feel like our generation can no longer handle him anymore.”</p><p>The last generation’s martial geniuses naturally could not compete with the current generation when it came to potential. But, with enough time and experience, it would normally take a new martial genius couple of more years to catch up with them. But obviously, Ye Chen had done so within a couple of short years, completely finishing accumulating knowledge and strength.</p><p>“Impressive!” The other two forced a chuckle, but they had to admit that they admired Ye Chen even more now.</p><p>“Flying Sword Realm!”</p><p>Sword Realm Artist was also a man of decision. After seeing his most powerful thunder Sword Realm no longer control Ye Chen, he hurried to take out twelve perfect wind element great swords and form into a flying bird Sword Realm formation. It appeared below his feet and carried him to travel at a high speed. Within only one flash, he had already reached the edge of the horizon.</p><p>Ugh!</p><p>Ye Chen did not think that his opponent was a man without any hesitation. Moreover, this formation was so fast that he would not be able to make it even if he tried to catch up now, since the speed of the Sword Realm was not that much slower than his defensive sword spell.</p><p>“Such people are really tricky!”</p><p>Putting back his Evil Shattering sword, Ye Chen turned his head and looked at Massive Sword Artist, Short Sword Artist, and the three from the True Spirit Continent.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The first two changed their expression immediately and flew out. They knew that their power was not the greatest, and fighting against Ye Chen would only lead them to death. Plus, there were three other “old friends” waiting for them on the side.</p><p>The bulky looking young man sneered on looking at the two.</p><p>Being a martial genius of True Spirit continent, Ye Chen did not ignore the three and walked over.</p><p>They three were the top warriors of true spirit continent, referred to as the top seven warriors of true spirit along with Luo Tiandu, Feng Piaoling, and Ji Hairuo. They were all in the life and death realm-to-be list. Each one of them had a very rich background, which were all rank 5 martial institutions or families. The bulky young man was called Qin Tianxiong and came from the Qin family, which was just slightly below the top four families.</p><p>“Ye Chen, let’s go search for the life and death palace together if you don’t mind. What do you think?” Qin Tianxiong suggested.</p><p>“Alright!” Ye Chen nodded. After he had killed the massive wolf spirit, he got another life and death stone. Right now, he was still needing two more, and all of the high rank spirits had almost been killed off within this core area. Instead of wasting time and trying to search for more of them, he might as well go to the palace earlier to try his luck, since the closing of the realm was approaching as well.</p><p>Seeing Ye Chen had agreed to it, the three of them seemed joyful. To be honest, with the three of them joining forces, they naturally were not afraid of any high rank spirits. But once facing the peak ones, one or two of them might not make it in the end. Right now, with Ye Chen by their side, even if they run into a top rank spirit, they would still be able to fight it off and get a life and death tag.</p><p>Perhaps it was because of their bad luck before or Ye Chen was getting luckier, the four ran into two high rank spirts and three high rank self-exploding evil spirits after they moved five thousand miles further. Besides Ye Chen and Qin Tianxiong, one of the other two had had a ghost puncture through his body and the other one exploded into nothingness. Since it all happened so fast, Ye Chen did not even have the time to save them.</p><p>“Things seem to be different from last time. Before, there were not this many high rank evil spirits gathered together.” Qin Tianxiong had a bad look on his face.</p><p>“Be careful!” Ye Chen reminded him.</p><p>…</p><p>The Life and Death Palace was a massive palace with black and white colored exterior décor. It was extremely massive, almost impossible to visualize its edge. There were many young warriors gathered on the plaza in front.</p><p>The warriors who were able to survive in the core areas and still manage to make it here would naturally be extremely powerful, elite of the elites. Amongst them, there were seven from the Heaven Blood Land, including the Elephant Warrior, Snake Warrior, Eagle Warrior, Immortal Demon Warrior, and so on. Over from the Heaven Sword land side were six of them, while from True Spirit Continent side were actually the most—Luo Tiandu, Ji Hairuo, Bai Wuxue, Lu Shaoyou, Xia Houzun, Xiao Chuhe, Dugu Jue, Dantai Mingyue, Chu Zhongtian, and Yan Fengfeng which made up all ten of them.</p><p>Besides the three lands, the rest of them coming from outer sea area could make up ten as well. Amongst them, two were Ye Chen’s old friends—the aunt of Yue Bingxin, Yue Lingshuang, and the prince of Black Water Alliance, Wang Taiyi.</p><p>“So many powerful warriors!”</p><p>Wang Taiyi’s expression was not so good. All of the young warriors in front of the palace were powerful enough to make it here, although some of them were perhaps just lucky and did not get into too much danger. But, that would be the minority anyway. Some of them had even brought fear in his head, such as the Elephant Warrior from Blood Heaven Land, Yun Bin from Heaven Sword Land, and Luo Tiandu from True Spirit Continent who had cultivation of peak third level of life and death challenge.</p><p>“Indeed, there will always be more powerful warriors out there. I wonder if Ye Chen is here. With his potential, it should not be hard to get in the core area. If he ran into some super powerful warriors in advance and was killed, then that would be unfortunate.”</p><p>For Yue Lingshunag to make it all the way here was mostly because of luck. She naturally would not doubt Ye Chen’s potential, but inside this secret realm, warriors whose power had not reached the peak yet would need a lot of luck. Without luck, even the warriors in the list to become life and death warriors might find it tough.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>From the back of Blood Heaven Land, a figure covered in gold flame shot out at an extreme speed, seeming to be a woman.</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>Everyone looked over, but none of them knew who she was…Of course, besides one person.</p><p>Wang Taiyi had run into her before and was pushed out of the way, so he naturally would not forget.</p><p>“Huh! She dares to move above people from Blood Heaven Land! I bet she’s going to face hell for it.” Wang Taiyi sneered.</p><p>“Come down!” The Snake Warrior had a cold personality. At that moment, a massive nine head snake shadow appeared out of nowhere. They were hundreds of meters tall, one of them having long horns as well, which then attacked toward that golden beam.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Amidst the gold flame, Xu Jing reached out a hand and pressed against snake head’s horn before shaking it heavily. All of a sudden, it broke apart as that horrifying power landed onto the snake head itself. Half of its body shattered along with the head, and that powerful wave of qi power spread out like a massive tsunami.</p><p>“Who is this girl? So powerful! Even the Snake Warrior could not stop her!”</p><p>Everyone was shocked!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
