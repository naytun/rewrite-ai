The Credit Battle was already reaching its end; however, many of them were feeling more excited than ever. This was because the true peak confrontation had yet to be seen. Marquis Sword Snow, Ye Chen, and Xu Jing—these three had been undefeated to this moment. Who among these three would have the last laugh was yet to be determined.</p><p>In addition to these three, despite suffering losses, Marquis Sword Star, Lu Tiandu, Lashan Mei, and Young Elephant Lord were also exceptionally powerful. Hence, the battles between them were still quite a hot topic.</p><p>In the twentieth battle, Ye Chen faced against Lu Tiandu.</p><p>As one of the seven heroes of True Spirit Continent, there was nobody who dared to look down on Lu Tiandu’s strength. Even though Marquis Sword Snow had defeated him, he had to suffer substantial injuries in the process.</p><p>“Nine Dragon Body Guard!”</p><p>Facing Ye Chen, Lu Tiandu didn’t dare be careless. His Zhen Yuan gushed forth, condensing into nine thick thunder dragons that contained both earth and thunder profound. Nine Dragon Body Guard was not purely a defensive art; it was a seven-part-defense and three-part-offense skill. Amidst thunder dragon roars, two of the dragons shot at Ye Chen.</p><p>Peng Peng Peng Peng!</p><p>Lu Tiandu was the young expert with the greatest balance of defense and offense. Nobody could even imagine gaining an easy victory against him. Ye Chen battled with Spiritual Sword and Waning Moon. The battle between the two turned increasingly close-combat, and thus became increasingly intense.</p><p>“Sword Domain!”</p><p>A majestic sword pressure appeared on Lu Tiandu’s body, causing his body to turn sluggish.</p><p>“Spin!”</p><p>Facing the enormous sword pressure, he forcefully moved the remaining seven dragons, making them circle around his body to reduce gaps and openings as much as he could.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>Spiritual Sword was exceptionally quick, but to be fatal, it must hit a vital part of the opponent. With seven dragons rotating around him, Lu Tiandu’s vitals were basically completely covered. Therefore, Ye Chen gave up on using Spiritual Sword against him. Instead, he initiated the Vibration Sword Art and thrust between two dragons, hitting Lu Tiandu’s abdomen.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>A powerful vibrational power transmitted from the sword’s tip into Lu Tiandu’s body. In the next moment, the latter spurted out a huge mouthful of blood and the dragons around his body dispersed.</p><p>Ye Chen’s victory!</p><p>“All the older ones are being defeated one after another. And it’s not like once or twice.” Someone amongst the spectators sighed.</p><p>“This era is a great era, far surpassing the previous one. So many frightening geniuses are popping one after another. For the past few decades, Mysterious Queen was the only one, but now three have already appeared who can challenge the heights Mysterious Queen has achieved.”</p><p>With that twenty-ninth round, the conformation of heavyweights inched closer and closer.</p><p>Marquis Sword Snow against Young Elephant Lord…</p><p>Young Elephant Lord’s Eight Savage Elephant Fist had a boundless might and was a heaven grade technique. Although he might have not attained greater completion, he still possessed some of the aura of his ancestral battle elephants.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The nearly three meters tall Young Elephant Lord madly charged across and pounded his fist at Marquis Sword Snow like a driller.</p><p>“Freezing Sword Point!”</p><p>The snow-white longsword thrust out.</p><p>Kadadadad!</p><p>Young Elephant Lord’s fist froze over; the thickness of ice reached about a meter, making his arm look like a huge snake. In the next moment, Young Elephant Lord’s arm shattered completely. Of course, Marquis Sword Snow didn’t fare too well either. His entire being was blasted off while spurting huge mouthfuls of blood in the air and giving off steam from his entire body.</p><p>“Snow Covers The Sky!”</p><p>Huge snowflakes covered the sky as Marquis Sword Snow turned mid-air and killed Young Elephant Lord with the next strike.</p><p>“As expected, Young Elephant Lord is not Marquis Sword Snow’s opponent.”</p><p>“I wonder who is stronger amongst Marquis Sword Snow and Marquis Sword Star. Although Marquis Sword Star lost to Ye Chen, it was mostly because he was suppressed. The existence of Sword Domain creates too big of a disparity amongst two sword artists, which can even reach ten folds. Seriously though, Marquis Sword Star’s fifth strike is an absolute killer.”</p><p>Marquis Sword Star’s fifth strike was a stunner for many. The light produced by that move was actually the death light of a star. A single look at that move would give anybody a perception of death. Not to mention confronting it, if Ye Chen didn’t have Sword Domain, he would have more than likely been obliterated without a chance to retaliate.</p><p>Of course, many were still suspicious if the Sword Domain was Ye Chen’s true ace. After all, such a thing was by no means impossible.</p><p>Sword Domain was strong, but its effect was only so strong against sword artists. When confronting other experts, it lost a lot of its value. Therefore, even though Ye Chen had revealed it, it didn’t mean much. If they put themselves in a sword artist’s shoes and had an exceptionally powerful ace along with Sword Domain, they would certainly choose to reveal Sword Domain first, saving the other move for the last.</p><p>However, all of these were mere speculations. Until the final moment, nobody could say how things would turn out.</p><p>In the next battle, Marquis Sword Star arrived, his opponent being Lashan Mei.</p><p>Although Life and Death Palace’s Credit Battle had yet to end, everybody already considered Lashan Mei as the fifth ranked. Young Elephant Lord and Lu Tiandu were likely not her opponent, which could be ascertained from her battle against Marquis Sword Snow. Of course, her chances in the upcoming battle against Marquis Sword Star were less than ten percent. Thus, although she was a top five candidate, her ranking would not be a single rank higher than fifth.</p><p>“Demonic Chop!” Sustaining Marquis Sword Star’s first three strikes in succession, Lashan Mei activated her Demonic Blade and issued Demonic Chop. Tearing through space, the black blade light slashed at the other.</p><p>“Fourth Strike, Meteor Fall!”</p><p>Relying on the power of impulse, Marquis Sword Star issued more than a hundred sword strikes in an instant, each of which brimmed with a frightening penetration power.</p><p>Clang Cleng Cleng!</p><p>Puff!</p><p>Lashan Mei’s chest shoulders and abdomen were slashed by one strike each, blood flowing out of the wounds like water.</p><p>“Annihilation Chop!”</p><p>Lashan Mei knew that she was not Marquis Sword Star’s opponent, but she wished to experience his fifth strike personally at close range. Experiencing death dao had great importance after all.</p><p>“Let me help you!”</p><p>Marquis Sword Star revealed his fifth strike, his body shooting across like an aurora before thrusting his sword out. The tip of his sword erupted with a star-exploding light, dazzling the room.</p><p>“So, this is death dao?” Lashan Mei’s throat was pierced, and every bit of vitality in her body was annihilated.</p><p>“Such a strong vibrational power!”</p><p>The edge of Marquis Sword Star’s right arm had turned into a bloody mess. However, his condition was much better than Marquis Sword Snow, since he managed to preserve his arm in the end.</p><p>Subsequently, in the next round, Marquis Sword Star defeated Young Elephant Lord as well. His fifth strike was a peerless sword move, a sure kill move. Even Young Elephant Lord, who had an exceptionally powerful body, was helpless in front of it.</p><p>“It’s a lot more powerful than the Freezing Sword Point. I wonder what Marquis Sword Snow is hiding up his sleeves.” Ye Chen had attentively watching. In his eyes, although Freezing Sword Point was a sword move that condensed sword to the limits, and thus was exceptionally powerful, it was quite lacking compared to the Seven Star Sword Strike, which contained the death dao.</p><p>In the thirty first round, Marquis Star Sword continued his winning streak and defeated Lu Tiandu. On the other hand, Lashan Mei, at a cost of a fatal injury, defeated Young Elephant Lord, proving many guesses correct.</p><p>The Thirty-second round was again a peak confrontation of sword artists, with Marquis Sword Star up against Marquis Sword Snow. The two great sword artists of Sky Sword Continent finally faced off against each other.</p><p>If Marquis Sword Snow lost, he didn’t have the qualifications to fight Ye Chen; but if he won, he would still have a chance.</p><p>“Marquis Sword Snow, I’ve long been waiting to fight you.” Lupus in Marquis Sword Star’s hand gleamed with killing intent.</p><p>“Me too.” Marquis Sword Snow’s eyes were as calm as water.</p><p>“Let’s begin!” Marquis Sword Star shot across. He knew that using first and second strikes was pointless, so he started directly with the third strike. He had some understanding of Marquis Sword Snow. The latter’s sword arts were hiding a killing intent hidden within the beauty. Thus, he didn’t have to probe the latter.</p><p>“Snow Dance!”</p><p>Sky-filling snowflakes floated, slashing at Marquis Sword Star.</p><p>Pittter patter!</p><p>The two seemed equally matched.</p><p>“Fourth Strike!”</p><p>Hundreds of little starlight arcs flickered.</p><p>“Snowflakes Covering Sky!”</p><p>This was the sword strike that broke Tantai Mingyue’s teleportation art. The sky-covering snowflakes condensed into strings of snow, covering the whole chamber and surrounding Marquis Sword Star’s assault. As long as Tantai Mingyue couldn’t leave the chamber, she couldn’t have won.</p><p>The two moves were yet again evenly matched.</p><p>“Show your fifth strike!”</p><p>Marquis Sword Snow’s sword slashed through the snow. A sword arc flickered, and at the end of the arc was Marquis Sword Star.</p><p>With his soul power, the latter could see that the edge of Marquis Sword Snow’s sword had a condensed white energy sphere. The energy sphere was the boundless sword Qi condensed together. Once this sphere erupted, it could easily break his defense and turn him into an ice statue, which would then shatter.</p><p>Peng Peng Peng!</p><p>Slashing through the snow, Marquis Sword Star fused into one with Lupus in his hand. The powerful starry force field emanating from him allowed him to completely disregard the disadvantageous surroundings and thrust out freely. The death light produced from a star’s explosion reappeared.</p><p>The tip of two swords inched closer.</p><p>Finally…Collision!</p><p>Creak!</p><p>The first to erupt was Marquis Sword Snow’s Freezing Sword Point. Countless chilling gales spread out, causing layers of frost to appear on the ground. Then, the condensed sword Qi erupted like a hurricane of sword Qi set off. It was even difficult to imagine what kind of might would be produced if this sword pierced through the body.</p><p>“You lose!”</p><p>At the cost of weakening his sword aura a bit, Marquis Sword Star pierced through the sword Qi and thrust at Marquis Sword Snow’s head.</p><p>‘Death dao, huh? He is not far from Life and Death Realm!’ Marquis Sword Snow’s expression remained calm, and a thought appeared in his mind.</p><p>“Too strong! Even Marquis Sword Snow can’t defend this.”</p><p>Numerous people were expecting Marquis Sword Snow to be defeated the next instant.</p><p>“He is going to reveal his ace next, right?”</p><p>Ye Chen’s gaze had been fixed on Marquis Sword Snow from the very beginning. He could see that the latter’s face had maintained its calm. It was not calm from knowing his loss, but an indifference as if he was walking in a park.</p><p>Rip!</p><p>A strand of black hair flew off as Marquis Sword Star’s thrust inconceivably skewed off. In that area existed a rule, warping the trajectory of Marquis Sword Star’s sword.</p><p>Sword Domain!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The entire Life and Death Palace flared up.</p><p>Marquis Sword Snow also had Sword Domain, the same as Ye Chen!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
