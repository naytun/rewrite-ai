And the biggest hero in this were obviously Thunder Spirit King, Lan Shanmei, as well as Ye Chen.</p><p>“Three warriors, please come up.” The chubby elder greeted them with the biggest smile.</p><p>He was really good at dealing with people, so he added a bit more in terms of rewards—five hundred thousand top rank spirit stones for Thunder Spirit King and Lan Shanmei. As for Ye Chen, he also enjoyed the half step king warrior’s treatment, which was also an extra five hundred thousand top rank spirit stones.</p><p>No one would think they had too many spirit stones, so the three of them accepted them with joy.</p><p>On the deck of the boat, not many warriors had died on Full Moon Trade Team’s side, so they all gathered together while chatting.</p><p>“It turns out that lady in blue is the Demon Girl Lan Shanmei. No wonder she is that powerful! All of the warriors from the Demon Blade Martial School are top blade artists. And this Lan Shanmei is the rarest martial genius that the school had ever seen. She has even comprehended the killing blade intent.”</p><p>“Lan Shanmei’s blade art is indeed very powerful, but this middle-aged blade artist was even more aggressive. With one blade attack, he managed to kill seventy to eighty opponents. In the end, he had even stabbed his blade in the head of that fish beasts, shocking it to death instantly.”</p><p>“Did you not see how high his cultivation was? I think he is at least at second level of the Life and Death Challenge, and might even be on the third level.”</p><p>“These two are indeed very powerful, but that young man is even more mysterious. The top leader of the fifty robbers gang, Mi Xie, was killed instantly by him! How crazy!”</p><p>“I also thought that it was super strange, Mi Xie was still a top warrior of the first Life and Death realm Challenge, so how could he not endure his sword attack? Perhaps he was being reckless?”</p><p>Before, no one cared about Ye Chen, and they were mostly talking about Lan Shanmei and Thunder Spirit King. But right now, Ye Chen had obviously become the focus of the conversation, mainly because he managed to kill Mi Xie with one sword, which was too effortless to believe.</p><p>On the deck, Ye Chen and the other two were looking at the view while chatting.</p><p>Lan Shanmei examined Ye Chen curiously, “You seem to not be affected by Mi Xie’s illusion. He died so quickly in your hands that it was out of my expectations.”</p><p>Ye Chen said, “Everyone has their own secrets. I guess this is a secret of mine.”</p><p>Thunder Spirit King chuckled. “Don’t underestimate him. He is the top martial genius of our true spirit continent. Not just the land, I doubt there would be many people like him even in the other places. At least, I have not seen one so far.”</p><p>“Oh! The No.1 martial genius!”</p><p>Lan Shanmei was surprised. The True Spirit Continent was the center of the True spirit world. Wanting to be the No.1 martial genius would not be an easy task. No wonder he was only at mid rank half step king warrior level but gave out such a powerful aura! It turned out that he was actually the No.1 martial genius. Lan Shanmei thought to herself while the respect for him grew inside her.</p><p>After taking care of the Fifty robbers gang, there were no threatening pirates or robbers on the Blood Ocean anymore. Hence, the puppet boat traveled all the way smoothly to the shallow waters in the north of the Blood Sky Land.</p><p>Lan Shanmei reminded the two, “The Blood Sky Land is an extremely chaotic place. Just as you have heard before, there will be beasts and demons, and even ghosts everywhere. If you want to save yourself and keep yourself alive, I would suggest not getting into trouble with the groups here. Although, you might be able to handle it with your power, so you can come and find me at the Demon Blade Martial School inside the Chaos Demon Region if you end up facing any major problems. In that area, our school is the most powerful group.”</p><p>Once they reached the shallow waters, the trade team was almost safe. Although it was chaotic, that was for normal individuals. The Full Moon Trade Team belonged to one of the two unions of the whole Blood Sky Land, so no one would dare to challenge them in general.</p><p>“I would not have come here if it were not chaotic.” Thunder Spirit King did not care for what she just said.</p><p>“I will watch out for it.” Ye Chen actually knew better than the Thunder Spirit King as he had the memory of the Battle King, and knew what he had to do to survive inside the Blood Sky Land. Just as Lan Shanmei had put it, it was a very messy and chaotic place. People here were either training demon arts or were demon beasts themselves. Compared to the peaceful humans, the races here were crueler and more brutal in general, ready to kill each other if necessary.</p><p>“I hope I will see you guys again.” Lan Shanmei knew that they did not care about the chaos here, but she just wanted to remind them, since she knew that they would have to get through critical moments and hardships in order to survive.</p><p>Passing though the north shallow ocean area, the puppet boat finally reached the Blood Sky island. The kind of natural yuan qi that blood sky land had was not suitable for people who cultivated positive qi. In other words, no matter what people with weaker minds were training, it might turn into an evil art or demon art eventually.</p><p>“Haha, we are here. Let’s go down!” The Full Moon Trade Team was spread throughout the whole Blood Sky Land. The chubby elder controlled the puppet boat and landed in a big city close to the ocean. After getting off the boat, a burning heat flashed through everyone’s face. This whole trip was full of danger, and now was time for picking up the rewards.</p><p>“Everyone, come here one by one to pick up the rewards.”</p><p>Some people came out from the branch of the trade team. After getting the chubby elder’s orders, a staff member came out to give out rewards.</p><p>“Three warriors, here are your rewards.”</p><p>Ye Chen and the other two got special treatment as the chubby elder gave out the rewards himself.</p><p>Before, he had already given Ye Chen his extra spirit stones, and now he gave out another three million spirit stones.</p><p>“Wait! Your VIP tag!”</p><p>The elder had just gone into the branch and talked to the branch leaders to get three VIP tags for them.</p><p>“Not bad! If there is an opportunity in the future, I will take on your mission again.” Thunder Spirit King put away the VIP tag. He knew that having a good relationship with the Full Moon Trade Team would not be a bad thing.</p><p>“Thank you! Come to my trade team to buy things in the future. Everything will be ten percent off.” The chubby elder was joyful.</p><p>“If you will excuse me, I will have to say goodbye now.” Lan Shanmei said.</p><p>“Safe travels!” Ye Chen nodded.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>A beam of black light sliced through the sky as she flew out of the city, soon disappearing into the distance.</p><p>“Ye Chen, where are you to next?” Thunder Spirit King asked.</p><p>Ye Chen said, “To the Iron Blood Region.”</p><p>“Oh? The Iron Blood Region? It turns out that you have had a plan all along.”</p><p>“You?” Ye Chen asked.</p><p>“Me! I will just go explore around. Once I reach the third life and Death challenge level, I will need to go through some life and death threats. Otherwise, I will not be able to make it to Life and Death Realm by the age of seventy years.”</p><p>Becoming a top half step king warrior would need a lot of adventures. Without any life and death situations, it would be impossible to get through the biggest challenge and become a Life and Death realm king warrior.</p><p>“I hope you become a king warrior and travel around the world.”</p><p>“You too!” Thunder Spirit King laughed and disappeared into the distance as well.</p><p>In the end, only Ye Chen was left there.</p><p>“Iron Blood Region…I wonder what the martial school Battle King was from looks like now after hundreds of years. I hope it is not totally ruined.”</p><p>Battle King had been in the Blood Sky land before, and had built a rank 5 martial school inside the Iron Blood Region. Then, he went back to the true spirit continent and met the biggest opponent of his life, after which he never went back to the Iron Blood Region. This time, Ye Chen came here on the wishes of the Battle King. Of course, he himself also wanted to check it out.</p><p>If the human’s cities were peaceful and looking good, then the cities inside the Blood Sky land was a complete opposite. There were beasts that were not completely formed, beasts with tails having fur or scales. There were beings between human and beasts, simply called the demi beasts. Besides them, there were also demon art trainers with their evil aura. One could even see demi demons around occasionally.</p><p>It might still seem rather busy and full of people, beasts, and demons, but the killing intent pervaded everywhere. Human societies were bounded by morals, but here, nothing mattered except power.</p><p>Everyone was allowed to do whatever they wanted, no matter how cruel and brutal it might be.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>Extending his body, Ye Chen left this city and flew toward the Iron Blood Region. He was so fast that he looked like a beam of electricity.</p><p>“Catch up!”</p><p>The second Ye Chen left, a group of beast people caught up with him.</p><p>It was clear to them that Ye Chen had just received a generous amount of rewards from the Full Moon Trade Team. And inside the Blood Sky Land, spirit stones were way more scarce than in the true spirit continent. Warriors within the same realm might not have the same amount as the ones on true spirit continent. Plus, it was in their nature to like robbing and snatching other people’s belongings.</p><p>This group of beast men included two half step beast kings, while the rest of them were all rank 10 beasts. So, it was not a group one would dare to underestimate normally. They always gathered around the Full Moon Trade Team and waited to ambush those individual warriors who had just gotten paid by the union. It seemed to work in their favour every time.</p><p>Outside the city, there was nothing but some lone trees. A beam of sword light sliced through the sky about it.</p><p>But soon, other beams of light followed behind it.</p><p>“Sky Lock!”</p><p>The leading half step beast king opened his arms wide and a bright yellow light appeared around his body before shooting out in front of him.</p><p>Woo!</p><p>The gravity suddenly increased, and Ye Chen’s body slowed down.</p><p>“Boss, your gifted power is indeed effective. You get anyone where you want them every time.” The beast man behind him laughed.</p><p>Another one said, “Without this kind of power, we might not be able to catch up even if we got some targets.”</p><p>Turning around, Ye Chen looked at this group of beast people.</p><p>” I see that you want to die.”</p><p>Ye Chen did not want trouble initially, so he thought he would just lose them instead. But, that beast man’s special power decreased his speed drastically. Although he had what it took to get away, he would not let this kind of harassment slide.</p><p>“Ignorant! Kill him!”</p><p>The two half step beasts king took the lead and rushed toward Ye Chen. Behind them, some were already starting to transform back into their natural forms. They all used their natural abilities and attacked Ye Chen at the same time.</p><p>“Then die!”</p><p>As he took out his Broken Blood Sword, twenty-seven sword shadows appeared and flew toward the beast men.</p><p>Pooh! Pooh! Pooh!</p><p>Blood splashed in the air as the broken blood sword was put back into the scabbard. Ye Chen made a waving gesture, and their storage rings landed in his hand before he turned around and shot out at a high speed again.</p><p>Behind him, a huge number of beast men’s corpses started to fall from above and landed on the ground heavily. Blood splashed everywhere on the land, dyeing the mud red.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
