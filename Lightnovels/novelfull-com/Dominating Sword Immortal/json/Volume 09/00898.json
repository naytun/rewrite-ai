At this juncture, one shed their mortal body and were no longer considered a mortal.</p><p>Life and Death Calamity was a collective designation, comprising of thunder calamity, great wind fire calamity, and godly Yuan calamity; each had different versions according to the martial artist undergoing the calamity</p><p>Once a Life and Death Calamity descended, the three skies of True Spirit World would open a black hole containing boundless energies of the heaven and earth, which would assault the martial artist according to the will of the heaven and earth. The black storm was merely an appetizer, and could not be considered the real calamity. However, even this appetizer was not easy to overcome. An ordinary martial artist could barely overcome it. This black storm was a test designed by the heavens for Ye Chen. With his talent, how could the might of this black storm be small?</p><p>“Life and Death Calamity…he is actually trying to pass the calamity at this moment! How long has it been?” The masked man was appalled as well as furious. He knew how powerful Ye Chen was. Even before breaking through, he killed Blood Blade King and gravely injured Gray Bird King. Once he broke through, he reckoned even he himself might not be the other’s opponent.</p><p>“He can’t be allowed to break through!” A cold glint flickered in the masked man’s eyes, as if he wished to devour Ye Chen.</p><p>“It’s here!”</p><p>The might of Life and Death Calamity was unfathomable, so Ye Chen sent the Dream Devouring Wolf back to the beast medal. Otherwise, with the latter’s cultivation base, he would die by the slightest of aftershocks. Sending the Dream Devouring Wolf back, he completely ignored the masked man and focused on the descending black storm.</p><p>Huhuuhu…</p><p>As the storm descended, numerous fine cracks spread in the space, which unceasingly extended. In the end, they trapped Ye Chen within like a net. In the next moment, the black storm came sweeping down. With Ye Chen’s insight, how could he not see how sharp this black storm was? It seemed to be made up of innumerable little small swords. Even a huge mountain or an entire city would be slashed apart into pieces before this storm.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The entire small island was instantly devoured by the storm, and Ye Chen’s figure could also be no longer seen. After ten breaths of time, the black storm completely dissipated.</p><p>There was no longer any island; the entire island had completely disintegrated, and all of its traces swept clean by the ocean.</p><p>“What frightening storm!”</p><p>The Protective Zhen Yuan intermittently flickered outside, which was the indication of facing an excessively powerful assault, causing it to fluctuate. It should be known that the quality and speed of circulation of Ye Chen’s Zhen Yuan was far beyond others after he upgraded his Green Lotus Sword Arts to the heaven grade, making his Protective Zhen Yuan several folds stronger than the same level experts as him.</p><p>“Die for me!”</p><p>The moment the black storm passed by, before even the first calamity descended, the masked man suddenly acted and instantly used his ace, unleashing a thunder fire at Ye Chen. However, the latter just sneered and stood unmoving at his position.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The sky suddenly emitted a bright glare, and the boundless light in the entire world converged within the thousandth of a second. Two light-arc-like thunderbolts struck down: one obliterated the masked man’s assault while the other landed on his Protective Zhen Yuan. He had absolutely no time to dodge.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>Spurting a mouthful of scorching, steaming blood, the masked man was blasted off, his whole body burnt black.</p><p>“Assaulting a martial artist undergoing calamity will draw the wrath of the heavenly will.” Ye Chen already knew that he had nothing to worry about.</p><p>Operating his Undying Body, the masked man shed off his burnt skin, replacing it with a new one. With a gloomy face, he pondered, “Damn! This world’s will is indeed interfering. If I continue the assault regardless, the heavenly will send a calamity my way, and its strength would be according to my strength. Even if I pass it, I’ll lose a great deal of cultivation base.”</p><p>Although the masked man was aware that assaulting a martial artist undergoing calamity would draw the fury of heavenly will, he’d never seen it with his own eyes. Thus, seeing Ye Chen right before his eyes, he decided to experiment.</p><p>“Humph, that’s fine! Life and Death Calamity is not that easy to overcome, especially the last godly Yuan calamity. It directly assaults one’s soul. The moment the calamity ends, I’ll immediately kill you.” The masked man gave up on killing Ye Chen for the moment, nor could he do so.</p><p>Kacha!</p><p>The black storm was the appetizer, and thunder calamity was the first item of the main course. Numerous huge thunder spheres suddenly shot from the sky, heading toward Ye Chen. These were not just thunder spheres, but thunder calamity that contained the heavenly will. Each one of these thunder spheres could destroy an entire city.</p><p>“Come!”</p><p>Hovering in the sky, Ye Chen repeatedly waved the Evil Shattering Sword, sending dozens of sword Qi up. Amidst crackling noises, the thunder spheres shattered, filling the sky with exploding lightning and thunder.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>After unleashing the thunder spheres, the sky rumbled, and a huge thunder city slowly descended from the black hole. As it slowly came out of the black hole, its pressure swept through the surroundings, causing the ocean water in more than a thousand li to cave in by a hundred li and creating huge tsunamis beyond.</p><p>The thunder city seemed bizarre and mystical, completely surrounded by a hundred and eight lightning dragons. At the center of the city was another huge thunder dragon that looked like a mountain. The scales on its body were bigger than buildings, two scales on its head looking like two long spears piercing through the sky with thunder condensed at their tips.</p><p>As soon the city emerged completely, an aura of doomsday spread through the sky. Within a million li, the marine beasts as well as the flying birds in the sky trembled, revealing terrified expressions.</p><p>“What! The most dangerous of thunder calamity, Doomsday Thunder God Palace!”</p><p>The masked man couldn’t believe his own eyes. Doomsday Thunder God Palace never appeared for no reason; it would only appear to ‘greet’ the most peerless of geniuses. The very appearance of Doomsday Thunder God Palace indicated that Ye Chen had the chance to become a peerless powerhouse like the ancients without a hint of exaggeration.</p><p>This was because the appearance of this palace had not been heard of since the Yuan Emperor. Even the Mysterious Queen only faced a high grade Thunder Dragon Palace.</p><p>Every layer of Life and Death Calamity was tantamount to giving insight into the future achievements of the said martial artist. Anybody with the pleasure of seeing the Thunder Dragon Palace calamity was a once-in-a-thousand-years genius. Those who saw the Doomsday Thunder God Palace were comparable to the ancients. In other words, Ye Chen could break the curse and become the first person to leave his mark on Emperor Scar Stelle after Yuan Emperor.</p><p>Shock and Indignation!</p><p>The masked man could feel his heart pounding. He originally considered Ye Chen as a genius who was somewhat better than the Mysterious Queen, and thus, needed to be eliminated as soon as possible. But, how could he have expected that he still underestimated the other’s potential! However, Ye Chen’s potential was such that nobody since the ancient era could be placed above him. There were experts that could have the same talent as him, but not above him.</p><p>“If Lord knew that Ye Chen’s potential was so immense, he might have personally taken action even at the cost of being discovered!”</p><p>The masked man was thinking at a lightning fast speed.</p><p>Ye Chen didn’t think about what the masked man was plotting. At this moment, his complete attention was on the thunder city. This palace was much more terrifying than the palace he’d faced at the mortal transformation juncture. This terror not only reflected its might, but also the heavenly will and compression of energy within.</p><p>At the mortal transformation juncture, the final thunder calamity was the Thunder Dragon Palace. However, at life and death juncture, the final thunder calamity had transformed into the Doomsday Thunder Dragon Palace.</p><p>As the thunder palace slowly descended, the ocean water caved in more and more: from a hundred li to two hundred li…three hundred li…five hundred li. In the surrounding several million li, tsunamis shrouded the sky, giving the feeling of doomsday’s advent. An air of terror permeated the air, spreading forth and beyond.</p><p>‘Too strong! Is it a test of my limits?’ Ye Chen pondered in silence.</p><p>With the Evil Shattering Sword in hand, Ye Chen’s mind, spirit, and body rose to another height. His figure stood tall as he slashed upwards at the city walls.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Luminous sparks flew off, covering hundreds of li, and a sword scar appeared on the city. The city faintly shook, then continued to descend. A frightening pressure descended on Ye Chen, causing the Protective Zhen Yuan around his body to warp.</p><p>“Congealing Water!”</p><p>Seeing his previous strike failing, Ye Chen used his ace. The sword energy smashed into the city gate, directly disintegrating it amidst whizzing sword cries.</p><p>“Sword Dragon Art!”</p><p>“Congealing Water!”</p><p>“Bewitching Mirror Shattering!”</p><p>Seeing Congealing Water fail, Ye Chen knew that this Doomsday Thunder Dragon Palace would not be that easy to pass, and he would have to use his strength to his limits.</p><p>Sword Snake Art needed the Sword Control Art to reach the stage of thirty three identical swords to be used. However, Sword Dragon Art needed the stage of forty two identical swords to be used. A silver light flickered above Ye Chen’s head as a half supreme grade sword turned into forty two sword phantoms, which formed a lofty sword dragon and shot toward the city.</p><p>At the same time, the Evil Shattering Sword in Ye Chen’s left hand executed the Congealing Water and Sky Scorpio Sword in his right hand executed Bewitching Mirror Shattering.</p><p>At this very moment, he had gone all out, mind as three!</p><p>Bang Bang Bang!</p><p>Facing three killer moves, the city finally turned unsteady and began shaking.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>Ye Chen again executed the three moves.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The thunder city was finally overrun. The city gate was on the verge of collapsing, and the greater half of the one hundred and eight thunder dragons dissipated while the remaining also turned dimmer.</p><p>“Break for me!”</p><p>Ye Chen roared and executed the third round of assault. The berserk energy assault pounding on the city hurled it back inside the black hole, where it slowly scattered away.</p><p>“He blasted Doomsday Thunder Dragon Palace back!” The masked man’s eyes opened wide.</p><p>Usually, the chances of success while facing calamities were ninety nine percent. Even though life and death calamity was powerful, it was, after all, sent by the heavens itself, and thus, the chances of passing it were quite high. However, it were not to be passed as lightly as Ye Chen had passed. He should have slowly whittled down the energy of the calamity instead of facing it head on.</p><p>Aweee!</p><p>A majestic dragon cry suddenly resounded, and another thunder city descended. Seeing that, the masked man almost spat blood, “What! There is more!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
