It looked slow, but was exceptionally fast. Even Ye Chen couldn’t dodge it in such a short time.</p><p>‘Worthy of being a spatial teleportation art…Considering the speed of her teleportation, I have no way of catching up to her.’ Ye Chen did all this only to get a clear understanding of one fact—how high was Tantai Mingyue’s comprehension of this teleportation art. She had clearly achieved the minor completion in the art. If she had been in the initial stage of the comprehension, he could have easily defeated her using his comprehension of space profound. However, at this moment, it was clear that her comprehension was quite high.</p><p>Zi Zi Zi!</p><p>Anyhow, Tantai Mingyue’s palm couldn’t injure him. A sword stretched out from between his right hand and body like a viper and collided with her palm, producing a sharp noise that could make one grind their teeth. Tantai Mingyue retreated dozens of steps, looking at Ye Chen with astonishment.</p><p>He already knew this would happen?</p><p>Turning around, Ye Chen said, “Your space profound ought to have attained minor completion. No wonder you can use teleportation.” Teleportation required one to move along spatial currents. If one didn’t have a high enough understanding of the space profound, it was an impossible feat to accomplish. Tantai Mingyue was indeed worthy of being a monstrous genius. Withholding Ye Chen, she was considered one of the twin monsters along with Dugu Jue.</p><p>“Right, but you were still able to see through it.”</p><p>Tantai Mingyue faintly nodded, not denying it. She had received the Void Shattering Finger quite far back. By relying on this move, she naturally comprehended the space profound. When she received the teleportation art, she had already comprehended space profound to twenty percent realm, and thus she was able to make such progress in this teleportation art within merely a year or two.</p><p>“It’s not really seeing through you. If I am not even careful against the teleportation art, that would be too careless of me.” Ye Chen shook his head.</p><p>‘What a terrifying person nonetheless…He has almost no flaws.’ Tantai Mingyue said inwardly, then continued, “Although I can’t beat you, you can’t break my teleportation art either. Then, what do you plan on doing next?”</p><p>“Teleportation…It only needs some time before I can find a way.” Ye Chen indifferently said.</p><p>“Hehe, since you’re so confident, let’s begin again.”</p><p>Space warped and she suddenly appeared to the right of Ye Chen, then appeared to his left, and so on. Soon, her figure appeared everywhere around Ye Chen. Ye Chen was quite clear of her purpose in doing so. She was creating spatial ripples everywhere, trying to plunge his perception into chaos.</p><p>However, what Ye Chen didn’t know was that the biggest reason she was doing it was that the opponent was him. She had no doubt that Ye Chen would not be an easy opponent. The previous situation was good enough proof of that.</p><p>Amidst the pervading spatial ripples, she could move almost undetected. The ripples created by her movements were extremely minute, concealed well within the other ripples. She raised her palm and was about to strike.</p><p>“Sword Domain!”</p><p>A majestic sword pressure emanated from Ye Chen’s body and instantly acted on Tantai Mingyue’s body, stiffening her body and rendering her incapable of bringing her palm down. Meanwhile, a speck of starlight appeared as he waved his sword.</p><p>So fast!</p><p>It was fast to the extent that she was almost killed.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>Tantai Mingyue’s figure disappeared, leaving behind a trail of falling blood. At the critical moment, she had used teleportation and moved out of the sword domain. However, Ye Chen’s sword was too quick and was able to pierce her shoulder, leaving behind a sword scar.</p><p>“This sword pressure!” Tantai Mingyue deeply gazed from far away. How could she not know about the sword pressure Ye Chen had used to deal with Young Undying Demon Lord? At this moment, she finally got to experience herself. It was strong, too strong! If not for her teleportation, she would have long been defeated. There was not a shred of doubt in her mind.</p><p>“Sure enough, it’s troublesome. But, there is still a flaw in the end.” Faintly smiling, Ye Chen walked toward Tantai Mingyue. The latter revealed a suspicious expression, not knowing where he was going with these words.</p><p>When the distance between the two closed to twenty meters, Tantai Mingyue could no longer stay in her position; her figure warped and teleported.</p><p>“Right now!”</p><p>Ye Chen had already acted before her figure could completely disappear, slashing at his upper right. The sword pierced through the space, revealing a pitch-black hole.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Tantai Mingyue’s figure appeared with a sword sticking in her chest. This sword could pierce through the space itself, and her chest was also destroyed by the spatial power.</p><p>She really wanted to ask how he did that. However, she didn’t have the time.</p><p>“Where was the flaw?” Inside the small chamber, Tantai Mingyue mumbled to herself.</p><p>‘Spatial Teleportation also relates to time, meaning that there is movement trajectories and time axis. As long as one can follow the trajectories of spatial currents, one can intercept the target prematurely.’</p><p>Of course, Ye Chen being able to accomplish this feat didn’t mean that the others could do it too. His soul power was five folds higher than the standard. Moreover, his proficiency in space profound was even higher than that of Tantai Mingyue. Thus, breaking her teleportation technique was merely a matter of time for him.</p><p>Of course, this didn’t mean that nobody else was Tantai Mingyue’s opponent. Nobody could tell what hidden aces other experts were concealing up their sleeves.</p><p>Ye Chen’s strength didn’t need to be mentioned, but Tantai Mingyue’s teleportation technique gave others something to think about. How would they deal with this art by relying on their own methods? After all, dealing with this art in Ye Chen’s manner of taking advantage of the art’s gaps and striking prematurely was not possible for others.</p><p>The next battle, Dugu Jue and Lashan Mei finally met. Both were blade artists, and both stood on their own on the path of the blade dao. One used pure demonic blade arts, giving her a superior battle power, while the other shone through his despairing blade intent, making him seem like an evil god.</p><p>Clang Clang Clang!</p><p>Sparks flew about in the spacious chamber as the two blades repeatedly collided.</p><p>“Such a strange but potent way of handling the blade!” Dugu Jue’s hands went numb, almost rendering him incapable of maintaining his grip on the blade.</p><p>Dugu Jue was suffering, but Lashan Mei was not having a great time either. The power being transmitted from Dugue Jue’s blade was too potent. Demonic Blade Arts shook the opponent’s blade, but the rebound was equally powerful. If the power she was dishing out was ninety, then the power returned by Dugu Jue was at least ninety-five.</p><p>“Demonic Chop!”</p><p>Holding her blade with both hands, Lashan Mei swept her blade out. Blade light made the surroundings fuzzy, flashing uncountable times in a moment and causing the space to crack.</p><p>“Despairing Blade”</p><p>Dugu Jue’s blade arts operated with the despairing blade intent. The stronger the intent, the more powerful his blade arts became. He held his blade with both hands at that moment and thrust forward, causing a deathly-white blade light to pierce through the space.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The two blades collided, and a momentary paralysis occurred in Dugu Jue’s arms. Taking advantage of this momentary opportunity, Lashan Mei slashed through the gap.</p><p>Puchi! Dugu Jue’s head flew off.</p><p>Lashan Mei’s victory.</p><p>“He lost!” Numerous experts from True Spirit Continent revealed astounded expressions.</p><p>“If his cultivation base was as high as mine, I would have lost.” Lashan Mei bitterly smiled. Even before she entered the secret realm, her cultivation base had already reached the peak of the first layer. Her current cultivation base had already reached the third layer, while Dugu Jue was only at the second layer. It was this difference in cultivation bases that allowed her to create a moment of paralysis in Dugu Jue’s arm.</p><p>At this point, the credit battle had already progressed to the twenty-second round, and the climax was upon them.</p><p>Marquis Sword Snow against Tantai Mingyue!</p><p>Marquis Sword Snow was a sword artist like Ye Chen. When Ye Chen had defeated Tantai Mingyue, many were wondering if Marquis Sword Snow could do the same. If the latter failed, it would more than likely mean that he was not Ye Chen’s opponent.</p><p>Everybody was quite pragmatic.</p><p>On the battle stage, Marquis Sword Snow and Tantai Mingyue stood face to face.</p><p>“This Marquis Sword Snow can’t be underestimated.” Tantai Mingyue sensed no restlessness from his body. He was like a deep river, an ancient well with no ripples.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>Tantai Mingyue moved, instantly using spatial teleportation and appearing behind Marquis Sword Snow as she palmed out. In response, Marquis Sword Snow’s figure swayed. He was about to turn while unsheathing his sword.</p><p>At that moment, a commotion broke out because the spectators discovered that Tantai Mingyue’s palm was a feint and didn’t have power. When she saw Marquis Sword Snow moving, she immediately retracted and teleported, arriving at his front.</p><p>However, a marvelous scene occurred.</p><p>Marquis Sword Snow didn’t turn at all; his movements were a feint as well. The moment Tantai Mingyue arrived before him, snowflakes covered the sky. His sword had left its sheath at some point, emitting a chilling sword Qi.</p><p>Si!</p><p>Sprinkles of blood floated upwards, dying the snowflakes red.</p><p>“Too frightening!”</p><p>Far away, Tantai Mingyue was feeling an intense trepidation. At the edge of her neck was a dim sword scar. If her reaction at that moment had been any slower, her throat would have been completely pierced.</p><p>“Excellent! He managed to grasp some key points from my battle against Tantai Mingyue.” Ye Chen’s eyes shone. He could see that Marquis Sword Snow had an excellent learning ability, and he’d easily grasped her style. As for whether he’d truly broken her teleportation technique, that was yet to be confirmed.</p><p>The battle went for several rounds, and Tantai Mingyue felt completely helpless against Marquis Sword Snow. The latter’s perception ability was too high, hardly any weaker than Ye Chen. Most importantly, his sword arts seemed impossible to defend against. If Ye Chen’s sword arts were explosively quick, his sword arts were beautifully quick.</p><p>“Snowdance Covering The Sky!”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Marquis Sword Snow, who had always been on the defensive, abruptly took the initiative this time. His sword arts were gorgeous and exceptionally fast. Sky-covering snow sprinkled down, not leaving a single spot of the spacious chamber. For a moment, everybody could only see two indistinct figures amidst falling snow.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Amidst the snow, a gleaming sword scar flickered. At the edge of the scar, blood splashed; Tantai Mingyue’s throat had been pierced.</p><p>“Too powerful! I thought Ye Chen was stronger than Marquis Sword Snow, but he seems excessively strong. His sword arts are dream-like and beautiful.”</p><p>“How did he beat her? Did you manage to see it?”</p><p>“If I could see it, wouldn’t I be fighting for the top five?”</p><p>The strength of Marquis Sword Snow managed to win the absolute majority of people over. As of now, even a portion of True Spirit Continent was beginning to doubt Ye Chen. Ye Chen was powerful, but this Marquis Sword Snow seemed freakishly strong.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
