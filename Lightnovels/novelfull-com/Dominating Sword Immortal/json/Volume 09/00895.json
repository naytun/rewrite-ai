But how to find the common ground between and connect the two should be the key to entering Life and Death realm.”</p><p>Upon comprehending Life Dao and Death Dao, Ye Chen now needed to connect the two together into a single entity.</p><p>By the lake, his left hand emitted Death Qi while the right hand emitted Life Qi spirals. When he brought the two hands closer, the two counteracted each other, creating ripples that could only be sensed extremely indistinctly.</p><p>“These ripples are it!”</p><p>After thousands of tries, Ye Chen eventually sensed these ripples. They had no life or death, but a combination of both.</p><p>Not far from the wooden hut, a huge wolf was crouched on the ground. Numerous eyes were growing on its head. Most of these eyes were closed, and the rest were only opened up to a crack. However, once its dark-green gaze leaked out of the cracks, its surroundings transformed in a bizarre and grotesque manner. The butterflies began flying upside-down, small plants grew into sky-reaching trees, and ants turned into fiendish beasts. Due to its gaze, reality and hallucinations combined together.Read more chapters at NovelFull</p><p>Compared to a few years ago, Dream Devouring Wolf had become much stronger. Its body was emitting a faint aura of life-and-death, and its red lustrous fur seemed to be giving off a slaughterous glow. Watching Ye Chen trying to verify life and death had greatly helped it.</p><p>“Master is too frightening! Following him, I’m afraid that I can become a Beast King within ten years, or even sooner.”</p><p>It was already a tenth grade demonic beast when Ye Chen subdued it. Subsequently, it had been hibernating after eating that Windfire Pill. Later, Ye Chen again gave it a top-notch supreme grade demonic power crystal. By relying on these two resources, it became a half-step Beast King without a hitch. Moreover, it had only consumed a tiny fraction of the crystal’s demonic power. Nowadays, watching Ye Chen verify his Life Dao and Death Dao against each other, it also entered the first layer of Life and Death Realm, increasing its battle strength and dream creation ability by numerous folds. Even an ordinary King would be somewhat affected by its ability.</p><p>“Ugh? Why are they not conforming?” Dream Devouring Wolf slightly raised its head and astoundedly glanced at Ye Chen.</p><p>Slowly letting out a breath, Ye Chen said indifferently, “Someone is approaching. It can be either a friend or an enemy.”</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Hearing these words, the wolf stood up and growled. The fur on its body stood straight, vastly increasing its size and fierceness.</p><p>…</p><p>Under the heavens were innumerable secret arts. Some focused on defense, some on offense, and some were purely supplementary.</p><p>The Blood-robed guardians had been thoroughly brainwashed by the otherwordlings. Each and every single one of them was exceptionally loyal, and they all were bestowed an exceptional scouting technique called the Great Soul Searching Art. This art could restrict the soul power into an arc, allowing the range of soul scouting to be increased by a hundred folds. The range of soul scouting of an ordinary Sea of Soul realm expert was a hundred li. Thus, by using this art, it could reach ten thousand li. Of course, the soul power could only be spread in an arc, and thus, couldn’t cover the entire area. However, it was still terrifying.</p><p>This art had one more frightening aspect: it could lock onto anything with life. Thus, one didn’t need to explore every inch, allowing one to save a lot of soul power.</p><p>By relying on this art, a blood-robed guardian discovered Ye Chen from nine thousand li away.</p><p>“Lord, the target has been discovered. He looks exactly like the portrait.” The blood-red guardian, who seemed like a captain of a small squad, raised the little snail in his hands and spoke.</p><p>“What, discovered? But, I’m too far away from there. Blood Blade King, you’re the closest one…Hurry over there! Even if you can’t win, keep him busy and buy me half an hour. By that time, he won’t escape even if he grows wings.” The masked man was delighted. Amongst every three red-robed guardians was a squad captain who had a position stone on their body. By relying on the position stone, the masked man could easily determine the distance between everybody and immediately send the closest one to deal with Ye Chen.</p><p>“Rest assured, he will not escape. My blade longs for the blood of peerless geniuses.” Blood Blade King was a blood-haired middle-aged man. He licked his lips and sinisterly grinned.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>The space cracked as Blood Blade King made his way toward the squad captain. A few moments later, he’d arrived at the target.</p><p>“Where?” Blood Blade King asked.</p><p>The squad captain pointed to his front and said, “On that island. Not good! He is about to leave.”</p><p>“Leave? He can’t!”</p><p>The distance of nine thousand li held no significance to Blood Blade King. The space cracked, and he reappeared on the island, instantly chopping at Ye Chen, who was about to take off.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>A blood-colored blade light shrouded the world, and the vibrant island was cut in two, flooded by the ocean.</p><p>“He is a powerful mid step King!” Evading the blade light, Ye Chen hovered in the air as he guessed the strength of his opponent. According to his judgement, the strength of Blood Blade King should be much higher than the consciousness projection of the masked man. If it were the previous him, he certainly didn’t have a chance.</p><p>However, that might not be the case now!</p><p>Unsheathing the Sky Scorpio Sword, Ye Chen counterattacked. The sword was so fast that Blood Blade King only had the time to raise his blood blade and defend.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>A sound like a grand palace’s clock tower ringing resounded, and Blood Blade King’s entire being was blasted off. Blood splashed from his arm holding the blade, revealing mutilated flesh and deeply cut bones.</p><p>“What, this is a single strike’s might?”</p><p>Blood Blade King was appalled. According to his knowledge, Ye Chen’s strength was only equivalent to ordinary Kings. When did it become so high? It was an increase of multiple folds.</p><p>‘While comprehending Life dao, despite me not consciously comprehending other profounds, water profound and space profound both progressed somewhat. Ninety percent completed water profound and ninety percent metal profound are in equilibrium, doubling their might and promoting Congealing Water into an upper grade high-step profound sword move.’ Ye Chen sneered on the inside.</p><p>Upper grade high-step profound martial arts had their own strong and weak types. The weak ones involved two great profounds both completed to ninety percent, while the strong had both profounds attaining greater completion. For example, the thunder fire profound martial skill of the masked man was a powerful art amongst upper grade high-step profound martial arts, with both profound nearing greater completion. Against him, Ye Chen had no advantage, but against Blood Blade King, his superiority was evident.</p><p>After all, he also had sixth step Destruction Sword intent and supreme grade sword Sky Scorpio Sword.</p><p>“This kid is troublesome! I better aim on keeping him busy.”</p><p>Blood Blade King instantly changed his course of action, as he alone was not Ye Chen’s opponent. The latter’s improvement rate was simply unimaginably. If he weren’t eliminated today, the price to eliminate him would increase by ten folds, and they might not even succeed.</p><p>“Trying to buy time?”</p><p>Ye Chen didn’t believe that there was only a single King chasing after him. There was certainly somebody stronger behind him. If he couldn’t settle Blood Blade King soon, he would be in big trouble.</p><p>“Oh well, you came at the right time to let me test Bewitching Mirror Shattering!”</p><p>Apart from water profound reaching ninety percent completion, Ye Chen’s space profound had also reached fifty percent completion. As to how powerful this fifteen percent increment was when compared to other profounds, Ye Chen himself wasn’t too clear. He only knew that Bewitching Mirror Shattering had certainly surpassed Congealing Water, becoming his strongest move once again.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>With a growl, Ye Chen’s entire body leapt forth like a huge eagle spreading its wings. He arrived before Blood Blade King in a few bursts and chopped.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>The space froze like a mirror condensing in the void. Blood Blade King’s eyes were opened so wide that they seemed on the verge of cracking as he stood unmoving inside the mirror. In the next moment, the mirror condensed from spatial power shattered into a million pieces. The splinters of the space no longer randomly shot off in all directions, rather spiraled and slashed at Blood Blade King’s body, as if executing him with a million cuts.</p><p>Ah!</p><p>Thousands of cuts and holes appeared on Blood Blade King’s body. He didn’t fear ordinary spatial power, but these spatial splinters contained compressed spatial power. Even water, when compressed, could cut through steel, much less to say spatial power.</p><p>As he protected his head with all his might, the peak semi supreme grade armor on his body was slashed at several places. It could be seen how mighty the spatial power was. If it had been an ordinary semi supreme grade armor, it would have directly shattered.</p><p>However, despite so, Blood Blade King had sustained grave injuries.</p><p>‘Life and Death Kings are indeed hard to kill unless you hit their vitals.’</p><p>Relying on Sword Domain, Ye Chen sealed off Blood Blade King’s surrounding space, rendering him incapable of escaping in the space. Moreover, Ye Chen’s speed under the effect of Sword Domain attained the limits of spatial sustenance. He instantly appeared before Blood Blade King and thrust out.</p><p>Congealing Water!</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The blood blade in Blood Blade King’s hand flew off. A sword flickered, and Blood Blade King’s head soared high up in the air.</p><p>Puff! Ye Chen again thrust out, piercing the skull.</p><p>“Leave!”</p><p>After killing Blood Blade King, Ye Chen collected the other’s blade and storage ring without any hesitation and immediately flew off.</p><p>A few moments later, Ye Chen was already a thousand li away.</p><p>“Lord, not good! Blood Blade King has been killed by the target, and the target is escaping. He’ll be soon out of range.” A few thousand li away, the blood-robbed guardian captain anxiously spoke into the snail.</p><p>“What? Blood Blade King was killed? What the hell happened!”</p><p>The masked man had an inconceivable look on his face. He was clear about how powerful the Blood Blade King was. The latter was more than twice as powerful as his consciousness projection. Moreover, he’d already warned him to keep the target engaged if he couldn’t win. Could he have been too careless?</p><p>The captain recounted everything he’d sensed.</p><p>“Damn him! His progress is so fast! He must be eliminated. Lord was right, this kid’s potential is rarely seen, including the ancient era! He is an enormous threat.” The masked-man’s complexion sunk. He could figure out how powerful Ye Chen was by relying on the captain’s description. This kind of progress was simply monstrous. It should be known that for an ordinary expert, a breakthrough meant little-to-no progress for several years.</p><p>“All hear my command, increase the pace of search.” The masked man ordered coldly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
