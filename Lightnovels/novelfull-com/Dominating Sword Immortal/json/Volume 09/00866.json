He was already at the peak of the third layer, while these two were only in the second layer. If their cultivation bases were at third layer, he might not be able to win at all. Moreover, he felt that he would be more than likely lose against Marquis Sword Snow as the latter’s Freezing Sword Point was too powerful.</p><p>However, once the two used Sword Domain, their strength would increase by ten folds against a sword artist. Any sword artist under Life-and-Death Realm stood no chance against these two. The suppression of Sword Domain was too strong against sword artists. Sword Rule could easily warp the trajectory of their opponent’s sword whilst giving a boost to their own attacks.</p><p>“On the surface, the chances of Marquis Sword Snow seem a bit higher.” Marquis Sword Star said inwardly.</p><p>At the center of the chamber, Ye Chen and Marquis Sword Snow stood a hundred meters away from each other.</p><p>“If neither of us had Sword Domain, you wouldn’t be my opponent unless you still have a hidden ace.” Marquis Sword Snow said indifferently.</p><p>“Is that so?” Ye Chen offered no opinion.</p><p>It was just as Marquis Sword Snow said. Without Sword Domain, the strength he had revealed indeed felt a bit shorter than the other’s. Marquis Sword Snow’s Freezing Sword Point was a powerful ace, whereas he’d shown no such move. Thus, his strength naturally seemed a bit weaker.</p><p>Ye Chen had no doubt that he would win once he revealed the Bewitching Mirror Shattering. Marquis Sword Star’s fifth strike was a sure kill move, but his Bewitching Mirror Shattering was also a sure kill move, and was even stronger. It was powerful to the point that it could obliterate a peak level evil spirit.</p><p>However, he didn’t wish to reveal that move. This was his ace left to deal with Life-and-Death Kings. Admittedly, he had no confidence doing so at the moment, but once his cultivation reached the third layer, he had the confidence to contend against ordinary Kings with the Sky Scorpio Sword in hand and not die. Thus, he couldn’t reveal this move yet.</p><p>He could not alert the Kings of Blood Sky Continent. For example, Beast King of Young Wolf Lord and Young Tiger Lord would more than likely not let him be. After all, upon missing this once-in-ten-year opportunity of entering the Life-and-Death Secret Realm, the cultivation bases of the former two would certainly lack a lot compared to their peers as there were no life-and-death stones in the world outside.</p><p>“Both our Sword Domains are alike, and Sword Rule is more or less the same as well. If you don’t mind, why don’t we start normally?” Marquis Sword Snow suggested.</p><p>“Alright!” Ye Chen nodded without hesitation.</p><p>“What is Ye Chen doing? Marquis Sword Snow’s strength is obvious. How is going to win without Sword Domain?”</p><p>Hearing Ye Chen’s words, the young experts of True Spirit Continent felt anxious inwardly.</p><p>“Fighting without Sword Domain?”</p><p>The young experts of Blood Sky Continent and Sky Sword Continent shook their heads. They didn’t think that Ye Chen had a chance against Marquis Sword Snow without the Sword Domain. In terms of sword arts, Marquis Sword Star was the only person who could suppress Marquis Sword Snow.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>Marquis Sword Snow took the initiative to attack, and sky-covering snowflakes gushed at Ye Chen. These snowflakes were condensed from sword Qi, and each of them contained a frightening power of compression. They could easily penetrate through Protective Zhen Yuan once they exploded.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>On the other side, Ye Chen raised the vibrating Evil Shattering Sword and drew a sword curtain around him.</p><p>Crackle!</p><p>The snowflakes were repelled off amidst muffled explosions. Although Ye Chen’s Vibration Sword Art was inferior to Lashan Mei’s Demonic Blade Art, the degree of sword Qi compression in the snowflakes was not even a tenth that of Freezing Sword Point. Thus, they were naturally no threat to him.</p><p>The snowfall turned more intense and snowflakes became increasingly larger as Marquis Sword Snow shot toward Ye Chen and raised his snow-white longsword. Snowflake-shaped sword Qi filled the chamber, giving off an ice-cold beauty. Ye Chen’s sword arts were nowhere as gorgeous as Marquis Sword Snow, but his sword was much faster; it was fast to the limits of his hands.</p><p>Clang Clang Clank Clank!</p><p>The two fought on the ground, in the air, on the walls, and everywhere in between. For a while, there was nothing except snowflakes and sword Qi inside the chamber, completely surrounding the two figures.</p><p>“Waning Moon!”</p><p>With his feet on the wall as if standing on even ground, Ye Chen slashed out a flickering black waning moon.</p><p>Marquis Sword Snow’s face had gravened a lot as he realized that he was actually inferior to Ye Chen in terms of skill. In a battle, the two parties could not use their aces at all times and had to exchange normal moves. The more he fought, the more he felt that Ye Chen’s foundation was incredibly sturdy. The latter was able to transform seemingly insignificant details into rare opportunities.</p><p>At that moment, Marquis Sword Snow’s body suddenly spun along with the snow-white longsword.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Relying on his rotary sword technique, Marquis Sword Snow was able to block Ye Chen’s Waning Moon. However, the immense power also made him fall off the wall and land stumbling on the ground.</p><p>Whiz Whiz Whiz!</p><p>Countless cold light flashes swarmed Marquis Sword Snow, and behind the flashes, Ye Chen’s figure lay in wait for his moment like a viper.</p><p>“Snow Dance Covering Sky!”</p><p>The magnitude of snowflakes as well as Marquis Sword Snow’s sword light erupted forth. As a result, densely packed snowflakes, under the effect of an invisible sword Qi, condensed together like a river.</p><p>Clatter!</p><p>Sword Qi explosions sounded incessantly, and the two figures turned faintly visible amidst dismembered snowflakes.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Pushing his Vibration Sword Arts to the peak, Ye Chen swept the Evil Shattering Sword through the dismembered snowflakes, tearing a slender sword scar open in the space which slashed at Marquis Sword Snow. The latter couldn’t help but admit that he had been careless. He was unexpectedly exploited for an opening and was continuously being suppressed henceforth. Even after using his large scale attacks, there was no progress.</p><p>“Too frightening!”</p><p>Everybody finally realized Ye Chen’s strength. His strength was low-profile, hiding both a mountain as well as river. Only after battling him would one really experience the astonishing talent of sword arts he possessed. Without the Freezing Sword Point, Marquis Sword Snow was actually being suppressed without a chance to fight back.</p><p>Clang Clank!</p><p>Huge sparks flew about, melting a large number of snowflakes. Meanwhile, Marquis Sword Snow slid off the ice surface so fast that only his afterimages were left behind.</p><p>“Using ice to pull distance?”</p><p>Ye Chen raised his brows but didn’t go for the chase. If he were to mindlessly chase, he would only be forced at the receiving end.</p><p>Marquis Sword Snow peered from the distance.</p><p>“You’re strong, but you will lose regardless if you don’t have a powerful sword art.” Adjusting his breath, Marquis Sword Snow spoke slowly.</p><p>“Sword moves are to kill, and if they can’t, it doesn’t matter regardless of how strong they are.” Ye Chen calmly stood in place.</p><p>“In that case, let me see how you’ll deal with my Freezing Sword Point!”</p><p>Marquis Sword Snow had already adjusted his breath to the optimal state. His figure flickered and shot forth like flickering shadows moving through. His feet were not touching the ground, making him seem like he was gliding across.</p><p>“He is about to use Freezing Sword Point. I can’t think how Ye Chen will defend.”</p><p>“I reckon he can’t unless he uses the Sword Domain.”</p><p>The acquaintances amongst the spectators chatted with soul transmissions, feeling increasingly excited.</p><p>When the distance between the two was less than ten meters, Marquis Sword Snow waved his sword, causing all the snow floating in the surroundings to condense together in that small area. The snow-white longsword thrust forth, condensing a glass-bead-like white-colored energy sphere.</p><p>The space was pierced, freezing at the edges.</p><p>“Too fast…impossible to dodge!”</p><p>A distance of ten meters was nothing for a top-notch sword artist and could be directly disregarded. Nobody could dodge at such a close distance, because that would imply that movement arts could be faster than sword speed, which was not possible.</p><p>At that moment, Ye Chen similarly thrust out the vibrating Evil Shattering Sword, and his speed was much faster than Marquis Sword Snow’s.</p><p>‘Facing my Freezing Sword Point with vibrational sword arts?’</p><p>Marquis Sword Snow had no idea what Ye Chen was thinking. Freezing Sword Point was much more powerful than even Lashan Mei’s Annihilation Chop, while Ye Chen’s vibrational sword arts were even inferior to Lashan Mei’s second blade strike, Demonic Chop.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The moment Ye Chen thrust out, his left hand reached out toward the Blood Erosion Sword on his waist and pulled it out, thrusting it forth with the same Vibration Sword Art.</p><p>Two Swords!</p><p>Dividing the mind!</p><p>Ye Chen was the only person who could divide his attention in the midst of an intense battle and still preserve his peak battle strength without a single flow.</p><p>“Two Swords!” Chu Zhongtian’s eyes brightened.</p><p>Ye Chen had revealed his dual swords at the southern sector’s tea gathering. He had always been puzzled about how Ye Chen could be at top of his game even while using two swords.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>Evil Shattering Sword met with Marquis Sword Snow’s sword. The vibrational power and compression power assaulted each other, counteracting each other while setting off bursts of violent atmospheric explosions.’ At the same time, Blood Erosion Sword was heading straight for Marquis Sword Snow’s forehead, just a bit away.</p><p>Nobody expected to see such a change, or the fact that Ye Chen would break Marquis Sword Snow’s Freezing Sword Point using two swords. Even though the latter’s Freezing Sword Point still had more than half of its power left and could land on Ye Chen’s body, Ye Chen’s other sword could also pierce Marquis Sword Snow’s head. Overall, Ye Chen actually had a slight advantage.</p><p>The weakened Freezing Sword Point was a bit deviated from its path after its bout with the Evil Shattering Sword. It was originally going straight at Ye Chen’s throat, but was now targeting his chest. If Ye Chen’s defenses were powerful, he might be able to survive this strike, but if Marquis Sword Snow was pierced by Ye Chen’s sword, he would die for sure.</p><p>“Sword Domain!”</p><p>“Sword Domain!”</p><p>The two immediately used the Sword Domain, and two Sword Rules spread out.</p><p>Rip!</p><p>The Freezing Sword Point pierced air, having suffered an enormous deviation. The storm of sword Qi emanating from it also deviated from its course under the influence of the Sword Rule, not even touching Ye Chen.</p><p>Sword Domain could not only influence a sword’s trajectory, but also any other attack issued by a sword. It was as mystical as it was tyrannical.</p><p>Marquis Sword Snow missed, but Ye Chen naturally missed as well. Both had simultaneously released their Sword Domains, affecting each other and making sure that neither of them could hurt the other.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
