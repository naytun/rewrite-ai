It seemed as if everything had frozen, turning into a picture. The ocean waves were also frozen at the heights of hundreds of meters, and only a little sprinkle could be seen at their tips.</p><p>The Heaven and earth had turned silent, and everything stood still at its place.</p><p>The Darklight King’s eyes let out two black light streams, devoid of any emotion. Space warped as he leapt; his aura climbed along with his soaring figure, and a breath of worldly destruction spread out of his body.</p><p>“Burning Sky Annihilation!”</p><p>When his aura reached its peak, the Darklight King placed his left arm on his right shoulder. The five fingers of his right hand spread out before he abruptly swatted at Ye Chen, who stood a few dozen li away. His palm directly restricted the space around the latter.</p><p>To his astonishment, Ye Chen discovered the space around him suddenly warping. Not to mention dodging, he couldn’t even advance. Burning Sky Annihilation was almost at the point of breaking the space. Although it didn’t contain any space profound, its destructive power was extremely frightening.</p><p>Peng Peng Peng!</p><p>At that moment, an even more frightening scene occurred. In the locked space, countless fireballs started appearing one after another. These fireballs had varying sizes—the smaller ones were fist-sized while the bigger ones were as big as a building. Hundreds of blazing crimson spheres surrounded Ye Chen and then exploded.</p><p>At the center of the explosion, Ye Chen could feel that even the smallest fireball could gravely injure an ordinary Sea of Soul realm expert, while the bigger ones could even force a half-step King to retreat. When hundreds of such fireballs exploded, perhaps nobody under the Life and Death realm could survive; Ye Chen was no exception either. It was hard to imagine how Darklight King created such an art.</p><p>Unfortunately, great might didn’t determine a move’s excellence. Burning Sky Annihilation took too much time, and nobody would be foolish enough to stay in place and wait.</p><p>Using the Sword Steps, Ye Chen’s figure flickered out as soon as the fireballs exploded. Waves of fire waves assaulted him, but were easily cleaved away. Whenever the fire waves surrounded him, leaving nowhere to be dodged, he easily slashed open a path.</p><p>A sneer appeared on Darklight King’s face as he retracted his five fingers and growled, “Annihilate!”</p><p>Wooo!</p><p>A dragon roared and the five waves created by the exploding fireballs converged together into a huge black-red dragon that seemed to be setting the heaven and earth ablaze. The fire dragon raised his head and cried as the extreme heat turned several li in its surroundings into vacuum.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A red light flickered, and the fire dragon shot at Ye Chen. In the vision of others, its speed didn’t seem too high, but it arrived before the other in merely two leaps.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Up to this moment, Ye Chen had only used the Evil Vanquishing Sword at full force once, and that was when he broke the Darklight King’s Blazing World. All the other times, he had at most used it at fifty percent strength. It was not that he didn’t wish to use it at full power, but it simply cost too much Zhen Yuan. Going by the Zhen Yuan consumption, he could only use the sword at most five times.</p><p>However, as much Zhen Yuan it cost, its might was equally high. At this moment, he didn’t use any big moves but the Golden Ripple that had currently assumed a backseat. A dark golden ripple spread out, directly chopping off the fire dragon’s head amidst huge sparks.</p><p>“You think this is it?” The Darklight King sneered as boundless Zhen Yuan gushed out, converging over the dragon and condensing a new dragon head. The fire dragon opened its mouth wide and bit at Ye Chen.</p><p>“Waning Moon!”</p><p>Ye Chen remained expressionless and slashed a circle with the Evil Vanquishing Sword overhead. A dark-colored crescent moon sword energy descended on the world like a waning moon, sweeping through Fire Dragon.</p><p>Creak Creak!</p><p>As majestic as the dragon was, it couldn’t escape its fate.</p><p>Waning moon unleashed through full power Evil Vanquishing Sword was second only to the Bewitching Mirror Destruction. Even Ye Chen didn’t have a clear estimate of how high its destructive potential was.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>The Darklight King’s eyes opened wide, turning almost spherical. Nobody was clearer about how powerful Burning Sky Annihilation was than him. This impact was almost devastating to him. At this moment, his battle intent crazily dwindled, and a single thought appeared in his head.</p><p>‘Escape!’</p><p>His figure flickered, charging out.</p><p>With a snort, Ye Chen made a pulling motion with his sword fingers. The Blood Sword unsheathed and swiftly slashed at the Darklight King’s Protective Zhen Yuan.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Amidst huge sparks, a new sword scar appeared on the Darklight King’s Protective Zhen Yuan, and his body was blasted away due to the enormous energy on the sword. A blood ray flashed in the sky and Ye Chen appeared beside the other, thrusting his sword.</p><p>“You want to kill me? Dream on!” The Darklight King roared and used the heaven grade ‘Cicada Shedding Carapace’ once again. This skill had allowed him to avoid death many times, and this time should be no different.</p><p>However, Ye Chen had already been waiting for him.</p><p>Flipping the Evil Vanquishing Sword, Ye Chen’s wrist shook and the sword thrust forth with a speed that couldn’t be perceived through even soul power. It pierced through Darklight King’s Protective Zhen Yuan and landed on his throat. In the next moment, it pierced out of his nape along with a stream of red blood.</p><p>Along with Blazing World and Burning Sky Annihilation, Darklight King’s ‘Cicada Shedding Carapace’ had also been broken. However, unlike before, he lost his life this time.</p><p>Throat slit in one sword!</p><p>Including Yue Linghsuang, everybody’s expression froze. Nobody seemed to be able to believe that the Darklight King would be killed so quickly.</p><p>In the previous instances, Ye Chen had clearly been helpless against the other’s ‘Cicada Shedding Carapace’. So, why did it turn out so different this time?</p><p>Darklight King still had some breath remaining as his gaze fell on the Evil Vanquishing Sword piercing his throat. He seemed as if wanted to say something, but was unable to. Amidst the unceasing blood flowing from his neck, he mustered his last strength and sent a soul transmission, “Why? Why were you able to break my Cicada Shedding Carapace?”</p><p>He was already a dead man. Ye Chen didn’t wish to let him pass away in grievance, and thus replied, “Cicada Shedding Carapace has a powerful deceptive nature. However, it is not that big of a deal for me. The reason you could escape the last few times was simply because this art of yours is too fast, faster than sword arts. Therefore, my first time was a feint, and the real blow was the second sword.”</p><p>“I understand….”</p><p>The Darklight King immediately understood, and all sorts of emotions—unresignation, unwillingness, and resentment—congealed in his eyes. He understood the reality, but the others didn’t understand.</p><p>“What…what the hell happened! That last sword was not even faster than the rest?”</p><p>“Could it be that Darklight King had suffered a grave injury, and thus revealed some weak point in his Cicada Shedding Carapace?”</p><p>“Although I can’t say what happened. I can say for sure that it wasn’t Darklight King, but this kid.”</p><p>“So terrifying! First Blazing World and Burning Sky Annihilation, now Cicada Shedding Carapace…It has to be more despairing than anything else.”</p><p>To break one’s aces one after another would undoubtedly be a heavy blow to them.</p><p>“Impossible! How can this happen?” The most person was none other than the head steward. He was one of the very few persons who knew the might of Burning Sky Annihilation. He was sure that Ye Chen would be killed. Moreover, Darklight King’s Cicada Shedding Carapace had never been broken before either.</p><p>He, who knew the hidden strength of Darklight King, couldn’t accept the latter’s throat being slit with one sword. He couldn’t understand how Ye Chen could come out on top with such an immense disparity in cultivation base. He couldn’t imagine anything more preposterous.</p><p>The four half-step Kings he had brought were specifically for the purpose of stopping other people from interfering with Ye Chen’s death. Thereupon, he could easily bargain with Darklight King to get his hands on the Sword Crafting Art on Ye Chen’s body. If he could get that art back to Glorious Exchanges, he surely would have received huge rewards from the higher-ups.</p><p>However, the conclusion was completely opposite of what he had imagined.</p><p>“He even broke the Cicada Shedding Carapace. Perhaps, he is the only one who can do it!”</p><p>Huang Mei was one of the few who knew how Ye Chen broke Cicada Shedding Carapace. However, if one wished to break that art, they must be extremely quick. Sword Artists’ attacks were always quick, and Ye Chen was one of the cream of the crop. Therefore, even if others could see how he broke the art, they might not be able to replicate it.</p><p>‘The decadal grand event is only a year away. He must participate!’ Huang Mei inwardly said.</p><p>Huff!</p><p>With a sigh, the phantom behind Yue Lingshuang gradually dimmed and finally scattered, “There is really a person above oneself, and a sky above the sky. I’m a genius of a millennia in my clan, but the True Spirit World is too vast, and has no lack of peerless geniuses. The one before me here could shock anyone for sure.” Yue Lingshuang’s age was not much, as she had recently entered her thirties.</p><p>The Darklight King’s eyes slowly closed, and his life breath almost dissipated, but suddenly…</p><p>The Darklight King opened his eyes, revealing an immense resentment and insanity.</p><p>“Die…die together with me, everybody!”</p><p>As he forcefully uttered the words, a hole appeared in his throat, and his sound came with an intense and malicious shockwave of Zhen Yuan.</p><p>Within an instant, the Darklight King’s body swelled and a resonant black light came from his entire body. His body seemed transparent, and even his internal organs could be seen. In the next moment, everybody discovered a black light orb at his dantian, spinning frantically. At the same time, a crack appeared on his forehead, leaking out his martial will.</p><p>At death’s door, Darklight King unleashed a secret art, combusting his body and Sea of Soul. A double explosion of a ‘strongest’ half-step King…its might needed not to even be mentioned. Even if another ‘strongest’ half-step King got caught, they would at least be gravely injured.</p><p>“Damn!”</p><p>Everybody was rooted on the spot before frantically making their escape. They were merely a dozen li away from the battle site. This distance was not even safe for a ‘strongest’ half-step King. At least a hundred li of distance was required; the farther one could escape, the better.</p><p>“Self Detonation!” Ye Chen’s brows suddenly creased. He was too close to the Darklight King. If the latter exploded, he would die without a doubt.</p><p>“Haha! So what if you won? You’ll die with me.” The Darklight King’s face curled into a warped smile.</p><p>“To self detonate, you have to ask my permission first.” Ye Chen’s face turned grave, and his forehead suddenly split opened, a silver light bursting forth.</p><p>.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
