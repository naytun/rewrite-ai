If I can find a Blood Crystal Flower, it can directly reach the peak of the fifth step’s mid stage. Should I risk it?”</p><p>The chances of a Blood Crystal Flower as well as mid level Blood Demon Kings appearing in the external regions of Bloodlight Ocean were too low. However, the core was too dangerous. There wouldn’t be just one or two Blood Demon Kings, but entire hordes of them. Even with the Destruction Sword Intent, Ye Chen would have to instantly flee before a horde of low level Blood Demon Kings. And if his luck ran out and he ran into a horde of mid level Blood Demon Kings, or two-three high level Blood Demon Kings, it would be a certain death. In usual circumstances, even peak Kings weren’t too keen to enter the core regions of Bloodlight Ocean. After all, not everybody had the Destruction Sword Intent. They would not be able to kill a Blood Demon King of the same level. Moreover, in the legends, it was said that the core of Bloodlight Ocean had a Blood Demon Emperor, which would be an existence that even titled monarchs would fear.</p><p>“Alright, Bloodlight Ocean is really big, and the core is still quite far away. I can head in a bit deeper and try my luck.” Ye Chen couldn’t enter the core regions, but he wasn’t willing to give up either.</p><p>…</p><p>In the boundless void, a sword light speckle was shooting across, heading toward Blood Sky Continent.</p><p>“A little kid actually evolved his sword cultivation technique to heaven grade and gained Sword Domain, which is even rarer than the Sword Body! Alright, if he is a monstrous genius of sword dao, I can let the sword be. If he merely has empty fame and has only relied on fortuitous encounters, then I can’t be blamed.”</p><p>Copper Sword King was no idiot. He knew who could be offended and who could not. If Ye Chen’s potential was immense and could become a peak King or even a titled Monarch, he would rather not offend him. Although Copper Sword King also had heaven grade cultivation technique, his derived ability was the Cyan Copper Sword Body, which only allowed him to be a tyrant among mid step Kings. If he gained a supreme grade sword, he would merely be able to contend with high step Kings. With a supreme grade sword, he might be able to scour more forbidden zones and gain more treasures that could increase his strength. But, at the end of the day, his potential was limited. Treasures could not increase one’s comprehension of the profound. In this respect, one could only rely on themselves.</p><p>In fact, all these theories were merely the embodiment of Copper Sword King’s insatiable thirst for a supreme grade sword. Sword Domain itself was the proof of a sword artist’s monstrous talent. However, he was too desirous of a supreme grade sword, and thus, couldn’t help but want to confirm Ye Chen’s talent himself.</p><p>The speed of the sword light was so fast that even spatial energies were being directly cleaved apart. In terms of speed, even high step Kings might not be his match.</p><p>…</p><p>At this point, Ye Chen was already thinking of a retreat. The nearer one went to the core of Bloodlight Ocean, greater the danger one would encounter. And at this moment, he had encountered a danger.</p><p>The source of the danger was not a Blood Demon King, rather a Hetero Blood Demon King.</p><p>Before him stood a thirty to forty meters long golden lion. The golden lion’s body was no different than Shi Shaobao’s, just that the latter was ten times smaller. The golden lion was surrounded by blood colored gales. Its two huge eyes were completely red without any other color, only exuding bloodthirst and brutality.</p><p>“Golden Lion King!” Ye Chen slowly uttered a name.</p><p>The golden lion before him was clearly a Beast King from the golden lion clan, converted into a Hetero Blood Demon King from the onslaught of Bloodlight Ocean’s chaotic will.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>With a roar, the golden lion pounced on Ye Chen.</p><p>“Seal!”</p><p>The space compressed, forming a purple mirror.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>The Golden Lion King’s flesh was too powerful. It also had a fifth step spirit body, but its spirit body was clearly more powerful than Ye Chen’s. The shattered mirror merely left shallow scars on its body, which closed before a single drop of blood could leak out.</p><p>Opening its huge blood-pot like mouth, Golden Lion King emitted a resplendent golden ripple.</p><p>“Too strong!”</p><p>If he’d come across an ordinary mid step Hetero Blood Demon King, Ye Chen could have still put up a fight. However, before the Golden Lion, he didn’t think he had any chance. He fiercely slashed thr Sky Scorpio Sword, emitting a dense sword energy containing frightening death dao ripples.</p><p>A burst of golden light shrouded the heaven and earth while Ye Chen’s entire being was blown away, spurting a huge mouthful of blood in the air.</p><p>“Escape!”</p><p>Riding the shockwave, Ye Chen hurriedly escaped, even releasing Sword Domain to aid his escape. Amidst a few flickers, he disappeared into the horizon. Facing the incoming shockwaves, Golden Lion King could not chase him.</p><p>Ten thousand li away, Ye Chen finally slowed down.</p><p>“My strength has reached a limit. Unless my profounds have significant breakthroughs, my strength will not increase by much. After leaving this place, I can begin to comprehend the life dao.”</p><p>Life dao was much harder to comprehend than death dao. In most cases, one would first comprehend death dao, then move onto life dao. After all, increasing one’s strength was quite important.</p><p>Flying without a pause, Ye Chen arrived at the Bloodlight Ocean’s entrance. Turning around, he bitterly smiled.</p><p>“I came for the Blood Crystal Flower, but this trip turned out so different. Before I could find it, Destruction Sword Intent reached the sixth step and expelled the Fire Star Poison. Later on, I didn’t find Blood Crystal Flower, but found a mid level Blood Demon Crystal and evolved my spirit body to the fifth step. Future is indeed filled with uncertainties. Who knows what will happen next?”</p><p>Along with Ye Chen, another King came out of Bloodlight Ocean. However, this King seemed to be in a terrible shape. His body was bone-thin, and his aura was extremely weak. He had evidently escaped from grave danger and overworked his Undying Body.</p><p>“Damn, this world is unfair!” Seeing Ye Chen, who was merely at the peak of the third layer of life-and-death-chamber, coming out of Bloodlight Ocean perfectly fine, the King was thoroughly stunned.</p><p>Leaving Bloodlight Ocean, Ye Chen turned into a sword light beam and headed to the Eternal Sky Sect.</p><p>…</p><p>“Eternal Sky Sect is just ahead. It’s said that Eternal Sky Sect is backed by a titled Monarch’s protection, and thus, hasn’t been destroyed for centuries. I wonder if there is any truth to that.” A million li away from Eternal Sky Sect, Copper Sword King hesitated inside the void.</p><p>“I am merely going to test a junior’s potential, not create any trouble. There shouldn’t be any problem.”</p><p>Just as he was about to continue, his soul power suddenly sensed a person who was heading in the same direction as him.</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>Delight appeared on his face. He would rather not go to Eternal Sky Sect if possible.</p><p>He turned around. His figure flickered a few times, then parted the space with his hands and emerged out of the void as if sword light was leaking out of space.</p><p>In the distance, a figure was flying across.</p><p>“What’s the matter, Senior?” Ye Chen stopped and measured Copper Sword King with his gaze.</p><p>“You’re Ye Chen?” Copper Sword King also sized Ye Chen up.</p><p>“Senior is not wrong. I’m Ye Chen.” Ye Chen nodded.</p><p>“I heard you have a supreme grade sword? Can you take it out and let me have a look?” Copper Sword King spoke directly without beating around the bush,</p><p>Ye Chen’s eyes squinted, “Senior is here for my sword?”</p><p>“Right.”</p><p>“Then, senior will be disappointed, as I will not take out the sword.” Copper Sword King’s sword Qi was exceptionally sharp, and he seemed much stronger than even that masked man. Ye Chen was definitely not his opponent. However, he would not allow his Sky Scorpio Sword be taken away from him. Thus, he could now only ask Yuan Emperor phantom’s help.</p><p>It should not cost him much Zhen Yuan to deal with the likes of Copper Sword King.</p><p>“You think you have a choice before me?” Copper Sword King faintly shook his head and said, “How about I suppress my cultivation base to your level and you only have to take three moves from me. If you do it, I’ll leave at once, and if you don’t, I’ll borrow that sword from you.”</p><p>“Eh?” Copper Sword King’s words were rather surprising for Ye Chen.</p><p>He thought that the counterpart had come to snatch the sword, not borrow it. Although he might not be speaking the truth, as far as Ye Chen was concerned, his words had some credibility. With his strength, he had no need to lie. He could directly snatch the sword,</p><p>“My apologies, but I’m not going to be senior’s opponent even for three moves.”</p><p>Suppressing cultivation base only meant suppressing Zhen Yuan’s amount, while the purity of Zhen Yuan would remain unaffected. However, this was not what Ye Chen feared, as he also had the Destruction Sword Intent. What he feared was the powerful profounds at his opponent’s disposal. For example, that masked man had such powerful thunder and fire profounds. In that manner, the profounds of the opponent before him should not be much weaker.</p><p>“Hehe, you’re indeed meticulous.” Copper Sword King smiled, “My three moves will be normal moves. If you think that I didn’t play fair, you can back out.”</p><p>“Is senior serious?” Ye Chen was even more astonished.</p><p>“Of course!”</p><p>“Alright, then I accept.” Ye Chen agreed.</p><p>“You’re courageous! Let’s hope your strength is as high as your courage.” Amidst his words, Copper Sword King’s gaze sharpened, making his entire being seem like a treasured sword.</p><p>“First sword!”</p><p>His figure suddenly moved. Exhibiting his speed to the limits, Copper Iron King entered the void and slashed at Ye Chen. The cyan-colored sword light at the sword’s tip seemed ordinary, but could make one’s soul tremble, as if it could directly extinguish the soul.</p><p>Just as Copper Sword King had said, he’d already suppressed his cultivation base. The Zhen Yuan this strike contained was more or less about Ye Chen’s battle strength. Of course, the purity of Zhen Yuan could not be suppressed.</p><p>A dark gleaming sword scar streaked swiftly across the sky.</p><p>“Sword Domain!”</p><p>Confronting an ordinary sword strike of Copper Sword King, Ye Chen didn’t dare be neglectful in the slightest. He felt that the mysteries of sword dao contained in this sword somewhat resembled Battle King’s Platinum Sword Body.</p><p>“Sure enough, it can’t change this sword’s trajectory much.”</p><p>The appearance of sword domain only caused a slight deviation in Copper Sword King’s sword, which was nowhere enough to let Ye Chen dodge it completely.</p><p>Clang! Unsheathing the Evil Shattering Sword, Ye Chen chopped at Copper Sword King’s longsword, and huge sparks rained down! Meanwhile, Copper Sword King flew back.</p><p>“Good! Your sword domain is actually at the peak of the first layer.” Copper Sword King loudly applauded.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
