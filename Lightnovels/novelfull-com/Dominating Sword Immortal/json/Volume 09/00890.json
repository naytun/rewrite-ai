His hand holding Evil Shattering Sword was completely numb and leaking a trail of blood down his arm. That sword strike was hard and powerful, the sword energy within compressed to an inconceivable degree. The power contained seemed like a whole entity in and of itself, neither condensed nor scattered. It was naturally a level higher than Ye Chen’s sword energy regardless of how condensed it could be.</p><p>“Is it Sword Yuan?”</p><p>Ye Chen finally understood why he felt that strike be similar to Battle King’s Platinum Sword Body. Copper Iron King also possessed the Sword Body, and the Zhen Yuan cultivated through Sword Body was called Sword Yuan. Sword Yuan was like sword light, with the only difference being that other sword artists could only arouse sword light while Sword Body could store it. Once it was unleashed, one could imagine how powerful it was considering its density.</p><p>On the basic level, Sword Body was a higher level existence.</p><p>Of course, even a Sword Body suffered some restriction from the Sword Domain. If Ye Chen didn’t have a Sword Domain, he would be spurting rivers of blood right now instead of just being pushed back for a few steps.</p><p>“I thought your Sword Domain was only at the first layer, not at the peak of the first layer.” It seemed that peak of the first layer and first layer didn’t have much difference, but Copper Sword King clearly understood that if his opponent’s Sword Domain had only been at the first layer, it would not have been able deviate his sword’s trajectory at all.</p><p>“Take my second sword!”</p><p>Copper Sword King’s body leaped up. The longsword in his hand vibrated, and thousands of sword petals surrounded Ye Chen. Every sword petal contained the power of spiral and operated under Sword Yuan.</p><p>Ye Chen’s eyes brightly shone as he pushed the Sword Domain to the limits, trying his greatest to warp the trajectories of flower petals. At the same time, the Evil Shattering Sword danced about his body, striking thousands of times in an instant. Ordinary skills naturally couldn’t hold against these sword petals. Thus, Ye Chen used his Vibration Sword Arts. Although he never refined the Vibrational Sword Arts since the closing of Life and Death Secret Realm, his body had long become accustomed to vibrational power. Moreover, his spirit body had evolved to the fifth step, which made using this art even easier.</p><p>Clang Clang Clank Clank!</p><p>A drizzle of light erupted around Ye Chen as vibrational power and spiral power collided, emitting light specks flying off in bizarre trajectories. It was a scene that could shake one to their very cores.</p><p>“Vibrational Power!”</p><p>Copper Sword King’s eyes squinted. In his impression, Demonic Blade Sect’s Demonic Blade Arts were the prime example of following the road of vibrational power. The might this power exhibited in the hands of Demonic Blade King was such that he could injure a same level King with a single swing of his blade, or cause the latter’s weapon to fly off their hands. Unless one’s strength was substantially higher than Demonic Blade King’s, they would not be his opponent.</p><p>“Beautiful! Now, the third strike! This strike will also be ordinary, but it’ll be a bit different. You’ll be absolutely incapable of deviating this sword’s trajectory unless your Sword Domain evolves to the second layer.”</p><p>Completely failing his first two strikes, Copper Sword King had lost some face. His third strike must suppress his opponent, and the matter of borrowing sword came later.</p><p>“Alright, I also have a sword move I want to see how it will fare against senior.”</p><p>Copper Sword King was a Life and Death King, and the speed of his attacks far surpassed any sword artist under Life and Death realm. On top of that, he was only using ordinary sword moves, which made his attacks even faster, giving Ye Chen no time to use Congealing Water or Bewitching Mirror Shattering. Thus, he could only fight with Vibrational Sword Arts. Fortunately, when he’d created his Vibrational Sword Arts, he’d gained some enlightenment from Lashan Mei, allowing him to create an ace.</p><p>The preparatory time of this move was extremely short; it was the very definition of quick.</p><p>“Spiraling Flower Sword!”</p><p>This move was originally a move containing profound. However, since Copper Sword King said that he would not use any ace, he modified it at the last moment to carry a unique sword energy, and not any profound.</p><p>As soon as his sword thrust forth, the space twisted, revealing spiral cracks. The spiral power was circular in nature, which would indeed be hard for Ye Chen’s peak first layer Sword Domain to warp, unless his opponent had the same strength as him.</p><p>Having crossed the Evil Shattering Sword with Sky Scorpio Sword long ago, Ye Chen held the sword with both hands and closely watched Copper Sword King, The moment the latter thrust his sword forth, Sky Scorpio Sword suddenly flickered and slashed out.</p><p>“Sky Cutting Sword!”</p><p>In a blink of an eye, a golden light changed the sky’s colors. At this moment, the vibrational power attained a new height that Ye Chen normally couldn’t reach.</p><p>Clatter!</p><p>The spiral power and vibrational power collided, and the space shattered like glass. Shattered arcs of spiral Qi and intermittently flickering vibrational sword Qi shot off against the two opponents. Relying on his Sword Domain, Ye Chen easily warped the shattered arcs of spiral Qi, not sustaining a speck of injury. On the other hand, Copper Sword King’s Protective Zhen Yuan was absurdly powerful and easily deflected the vibrational sword Qi.</p><p>In the third exchange, both stood at the even ground. Of course, Ye Chen had the advantage of the Sky Scorpio Sword.</p><p>‘This kid is really terrifying!’ Retreating back, Copper Sword King gravely sized Ye Chen.</p><p>Spiraling Flower Sword was actually a move in between ordinary sword attacks and sword moves containing profound. He originally thought that he would be able to defeat Ye Chen by relying on this move. However, the opponent also had a frightening sword move containing the power of vibration, which momentary peaked and caused a slight numbness in his hand.</p><p>“Such a frightening spiral sword energy!”</p><p>On the other hand, Ye Chen also admired Copper Sword King a lot. Although his second strike also had spiraling power in every petal, it was not much, allowing him to deviate its trajectory. However, the third strike had spiraling power more than ten times that of the second strike, giving birth to a centripetal force that caused the spiraling power to not scatter.</p><p>If not for the Sky Scorpio Sword, this strike would have dismembered his right arm.</p><p>In the void, a secretive soul power probingly spread out.</p><p>“How is this possible? He really didn’t die?” Surrounded with spatial power, the masked man exclaimed.</p><p>His Thunder Fire Four Layered Sky was his strongest ace, superimposing four layers of fist energy. But, even he himself wouldn’t dare to face this attack head on. Although some tears had occurred in the superimposing, it was still not something a little guy at the peak of third layer could resist. This was extremely startling and terrifying to him.</p><p>“Lord is right. This kid is too big of a threat. He mustn’t be allowed to enter Life and Death Realm, or there will be another Battle King or Mysterious Queen…No, an existence even more frightening than them!” Wordlessly retracting his soul power, the masked man prepared to leave.</p><p>“Who is it?” Copper Sword King roared and thrust out.</p><p>Piercing through the spatial barriers, a sword energy containing wind profound and metal profound instantly arrived before the masked man. This strike was more than ten folds stronger than the previous strike.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>The masked man’s head was pierced, and his soul power scattered.</p><p>“A consciousness projection?” Copper Sword King’s eyes squinted. He didn’t have any reaction that he killed the masked man in one strike. Ordinary mid step Kings could rarely resist a single strike of his. This was the destructive power of Sword Yuan.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
