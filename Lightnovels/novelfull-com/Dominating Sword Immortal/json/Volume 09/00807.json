Big sects will thus be able to produce a steady stream of sword grandmasters. The value of this thing couldn’t be estimated through spirit stones.”</p><p>“The starting price of the Sword Forging Art is fifteen million upper grade spirit stones…Every bid must be at least five hundred thousand. Begin!”</p><p>Explaining the rules, the host thundered.</p><p>“Sixteen million.” The chief steward of Glorious Exchanges made the first bid.</p><p>“Seventeen million.” Shi Shaobao was unwilling to be outdone.</p><p>“Eighteen million.” Yue Lingshuang raised her hands and shouted with a steady and powerful voice.</p><p>“This Sword Forging Art jade script will rise to at least thirty million upper grade stones.” Ye Chen was not hurried at all as he gently took a sip from the teacup.</p><p>As Ye Chen had expected, the price steadily soared like a rocket. The individuals interested in the Sword Forging Art were not just the above three who had the initial bids. Huang Mei, Red Flame King, and some half-step Kings with enormous backings all plunged into the bidding war, never allowing the price to be stagnant,</p><p>“Thirty five million.” The chief steward’s powerful voice echoed.</p><p>“Thirty eight million.” Yue Lingshuang seemed to be determined to return with the Sword Forging Art this time. After all, its value to Silvermoon Whitefox this time was simply too great.</p><p>“Forty million.”</p><p>Shi Shaobao had already backed out. The wealth on him was far from sufficient, and the auction didn’t accept treasures. Meanwhile, as a ‘strongest’ half-step King, Huang Mei had an unimaginable wealth. Adding the gains from Mysterious Yin Pagado, her wealth might already have surpassed a hundred million. Forty million didn’t amount to much to her.</p><p>Yue Lingshuang smiled bitterly, “If I had known this beforehand, I could have taken some from the clan.”</p><p>“Sister-in-law, our clan doesn’t have many sword artists. It’s not too bad.”</p><p>“Yeah, let’s enjoy the bidding war.”</p><p>Clasping her hands, Yue Lingshuang leaned back in her chair.</p><p>The bidding continued. Apart from the chief steward and Huang Mei, there was one more non-reputed half-step King who seemed determined to win.</p><p>“Only three are left…It’s time!” Ye Chen was actually quite concerned. He feared that only he and Huang Mei would be left in the end, and he would be caught in an awkward situation. After all, although Huang Mei had helped him, the Sword Forging Art was simply too precious to him.</p><p>“Fifty million.” Placing down his teacup, Ye Chen raised his hand.</p><p>“Him again!” The head steward’s face turned unsightly.</p><p>“I see young master Ye Chen also has an interest in the Sword Forging Art.” Huang Mei sent a Zhen Yuan transmission to Ye Chen.</p><p>Ye Chen said, “My apologies! This jade strip is rare and very interesting. Let’s do it like this. Let me win, and I’ll share everything with you except for the knowledge regarding the supreme grade sword forging. I presume you aren’t that hopeful about the supreme grade sword forging information inside it anyway.”</p><p>“You’re not wrong. I don’t have much use for snippets of supreme grade sword forging art’s information. Help yourself!” Huang Mei suddenly withdrew from the bidding.</p><p>“Fifty one million.” The head steward bid on one hand and sent a Zhen Yuan transmission to Ye Chen on the other, “Little brother, I’m the head steward of Glorious Exchanges. We had some disagreements previously, but you have to understand that I’m bound by duty in many cases as a steward. If little brothers gives up now, I’ll go beyond my capabilities and issue you a Glorious Exchanges Token. With this token, you can come anytime and set up your shop free of cost.” The cost of setting up a shop in Glorious Exchanges was not low—the first floor cost five percent, second cost four percent, and third three percent. In other words, on a treasure worth ten million spirit stones, one could save three hundred thousand spirit stones just like that. Although it didn’t seem much when selling once or twice, over time, this number could easily reach a frightening amount.</p><p>Ye Chen sneered. This head steward was really not acting in good faith if he thought he could settle him with a mere Glorious Exchanges token. Moreover, his tone carried a threatening meaning, asking for face.</p><p>Of course, others might have agreed at this point, but Ye Chen didn’t even have to think for a moment. He didn’t plan to stay on Gemstone Islands for long anyway. Hence, this token didn’t mean anything to him.</p><p>“Fifty two million.” Ye Chen raised indifferently.</p><p>“Seems like this little brother doesn’t intend to leave any face for Glorious Exchanges.” The head steward’s corner of mouth raised, revealing a trace of killing intent.</p><p>“Glorious Exchanges naturally has to be respected. But, you aren’t qualified to represent it.” Ye Chen mocked.</p><p>“Hope you don’t regret it later.” Gnashing his teeth, the head steward no longer tried to threaten Ye Chen.</p><p>When the price reached fifty six million, the head steward finally gave up. This was the limit of funds he could mobilize. In reality, the price he assigned to the jade strip didn’t exceed sixty million. After all, it was unknown how useful the information inside the jade strip would be. It could easily end up in a big loss.</p><p>“Fifty eight million.” In the end, only one person was left behind competing with Ye Chen. This individual had a powerful sword Qi around his body. He was a half-step Sword King. His sect was Thousand Sword Sect, which was not far away from Gemstone Islands. All the sect members were sword artists, and thus, this sword forging art held a great importance to his sect.</p><p>“Sixty million.” Ye Chen’s face turned slightly grave. It seemed like this person was fully prepared.</p><p>As to two continued to outbid each other, the price soon climbed to seventy million, causing everybody in the auction to suck in breaths of cold air. It was such an astronomical number that they wouldn’t get so much even if they sold themselves. If they had such a wealth, they would have armed themselves to teeth.</p><p>“Seventy one million.”</p><p>Ye Chen’s face was grave, but his opponent was sweating. Gemstone Islands had a branch of Thousand Sword Sect, which was the reason he could afford so many spirit stones. However, Ye Chen’s spirit stones seemed to have no end. No matter how many times he raised, Ye Chen always seemed to be able to raise without missing a beat. It completely crushed his confidence.</p><p>“Seventy five million.”</p><p>Letting out a breath, Ye Chen increased four million in one go. The Sword Forging Art was something he must have. It was not needed for the current him; but when he became a Life and Death King, he would have the ability to travel through stars. If he obtained some supreme grade materials, he would be able to forge his own supreme grade sword. Although this jade strip didn’t have much information in this regard, he should at least be able to have a good base.</p><p>The other party turned silent, as he could not fork out such an amount of spirit stones.</p><p>The auction host was silent for a few moments. Seeing that nobody would be raising further, he walked to the counter with the little hammer in his hands and spoke loudly, “Seventy five million…If nobody raises it further, this Sword Forging Art jade strip belongs to the little brother here.”</p><p>Anyhow, nobody spoke.</p><p>“Alright! Seventy five million one, seventy million two, seventy five million three…Sold! Congratulations little brother!” The host slammed the hammer on the counter.</p><p>A few moments later, the Sword Forging Art was delivered to Ye Chen, while the latter handed over seventy five million upper grade spirit stones without a word.</p><p>The Sword Forging Art was the last item of the auction, so the auction also concluded at this moment. Somebody estimated that the total value of this auction was four hundred and twenty million, thirty-forty percent higher than usual. It was definitely a rare grand auction.</p><p>While leaving, the Darklight King and the head steward coldly glanced at Ye Chen. That sword artist from Thousand Sword Sect also stared at him for a good while.</p><p>“Seems like this place is not good to stay at anymore.” Ye Chen sighed. He didn’t fear the Darklight King. However, the Glorious Exchanges behind the head steward and Thousand Sword Sect made him feel quite apprehensive. Who knew if this sword forging art might even provoke a Life and Death King of Thousand Sword Sect to act personally?</p><p>“Let’s go! We’ll first return to the garden.”</p><p>Gemstone Islands currently had no Life and Death Kings, so Ye Chen wanted to use this short time to carry out some vital tasks. Leaving the auction site, the two rushed back to the garden.</p><p>…</p><p>At this moment, it was already night. Inside his bedroom, Ye Chen took out the Sword Forging Art and poured his soul power inside.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>A burst of cool intent suddenly poured into Ye Chen’s brain and turned into countless chaotic little symbols. These symbols again arranged themselves, finally forming a complete record of the sword forging art’s knowledge. Lower grade, mid grade, upper, grade, semi supreme grade—all were clearly distinct. Above semi supreme was an exceptionally small piece on supreme grade, which seemed to be discontinuous.</p><p>“It’s indeed true.”</p><p>Simulating the contents inside his brain, Ye Chen felt that the contents written were not fake. Although he had never dabbled in sword forging art, as a sword artist, he did have a vague intuition about it.</p><p>“However, the sword forging art requires a lot of materials in the beginning stages. Even a genius sword forger won’t succeed at first try, and even if one did, it wouldn’t mean anything. To thoroughly master this subject, one can’t imagine themselves doing it in a day or two. And neither does a success happening once or twice mean anything.”</p><p>The night passed, and Ye Chen had Wang Lan lead them to the yellow islands at dawn.</p><p>The yellow islands primarily sold all kinds of materials—spirit herbs, precious ores, attributed gems, and so on. Going by the grades of materials, the islands were divided from lighter shades to darker shades. The light yellow island sold lower and mid grade materials, bright yellow island sold mid and upper grade, and tangerine island sold upper and half supreme grade materials.</p><p>As for whether one would come across a supreme grade material, that would depend on one’s luck.</p><p>The three didn’t immediately head to the tangerine island, and first arrived at light yellow island.</p><p>Without a change in expression, Ye Chen purchased more than ten thousand lower grade materials and thousands of mid grade materials. A sudden shortage of sword forging lower grade materials occurred consequently on the light yellow island.</p><p>Ransacking the bright yellow island and tangerine island the same way, Ye Chen purchased a total of twelve thousand distinct lower grade materials, five thousand distinct mid grade materials, and two thousand upper grade and half supreme grade materials combined.</p><p>He even got his hands on three pieces of supreme grade materials.</p><p>If not for one upper grade storage ring as well as numerous mid grade and low grade storage rings, he would not have been able to carry so much on him.</p><p>Purchasing the materials, Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng prepared to leave Gemstone Islands. This place had a lot of powers, so staying here would most likely not end up good for them.</p><p>“Sir Darklight King, they’re leaving.” Inside a teahouse, a person walked up to Darklight King and reported.</p><p>“Well done!” The Darklight King placed down the teacup in his hands and fiercely stood up, radiating an intense killing intent.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
