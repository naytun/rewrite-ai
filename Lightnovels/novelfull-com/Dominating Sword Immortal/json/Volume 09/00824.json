As for the members of the Full Moon Trade Team, none of them left the boat, since they needed to protect the chubby elder and the goods. However, they started to shoot out attacks at the Fifty Robbers Gang members as well.</p><p>The battle got intense immediately; due to lack of warriors over at Ye Chen’s side, they lost twenty warriors instantly. They did not even have the time to let out a cry before dying in horrible ways.</p><p>“Let’s kill off some of them first.”</p><p>Lan Shanmei had a beam of cold light flashing through her eyes as she turned into a beam of black light, shooting out into the enemy side like lightning. In the next second, the dark red blade light appeared out of nowhere, each blade light taking dozens of people’s lives. Within only a couple of blinks worth of time, hundreds of people died in her hand, including six of the Fifty Robbers Gang. One of them was even a half step king warrior, but still could not handle her blade attack.</p><p>The tall middle-aged man had his eyes drastically widened, “Ghost Lady, what are you still waiting for? Go stop her!” Lan Shanmei was traveling so fast that she had already made it into her enemy base before the two actually got in touch, which caught them completely off guard. A lot of warriors did not even know she was there before being killed instant. Her power had made the middle aged man worried indeed.</p><p>The Ghost Lady was indeed that elder lady with fur growing on her face. Her cultivation had reached a very high level, at the second level of Life and Death Challenge. Her choice of weapon was a pair of iron claws which shone a cold light constantly.</p><p>Shoo! She shot out like a monkey and had already jumped across the warriors with only one flash, reappearing in front of Lan Shanmei.</p><p>“Young girl, die!” She threw out her iron claw attack as she sneered.</p><p>“We do not know who’s going to die yet.”</p><p>Lan Shanmei’s weapon was a pitch black long blade, which was covered in dark red qi flow with Zhen yuan being poured in. The second she threw out an attack, blade light appeared and clashed with the incoming attack.</p><p>Chin!</p><p>The Ghost Lady could not control her body and was blown out.</p><p>“It is the Demon Blade Spell from the Demon Blade Martial School! You are the Demon Girl, Lan Shanmei!” The older lady cried out. The Demon Blade Martial School was a very famous super martial school inside the Blood Sky Land, and the Demon Blade Spell was the exclusive hidden secret martial art that not many people knew about. Its movement and style were completely different from the other blade artists. It was very brutal, and full of power.</p><p>“As long as you know it…”</p><p>Lan Shanmei soon caught up with her. On her way of doing so, the weaker ones had been shredded into blood mist by her blade qi.</p><p>“Mi Xie, you go help out.”</p><p>The tall middle aged man did not expect the Ghost Lady to lose her upper hand within one attack. But once she mentioned that girl’s name, he hurried to ask the other middle aged man to help out.</p><p>“Demon Girl Lan Shanmei…If I catch her, then I will enjoy her nicely for sure! Hehe…Hey Ghost Lady, I will help you out.” The middle-aged man gave out an evil smile as his body twisted like a ghost and disappeared completely. As he reappeared, he was already behind Lan Shanmei.</p><p>Lan Shanmei had great senses; the second he appeared, she had spotted him and performed her power to throw out a blade attack at his body.</p><p>“It is not good for a lady to be this aggressive.” He gently avoided this blade attack as if his body did not have any weight.</p><p>“Hehe…Ye Chen, let’s join in the battles!” As the Thunder Spirit King spoke, he had already jumped and taken out his long blade. He held it with both of his hands and waved it down.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The drastically powerful Thunder Blade light appeared, killing all enemies in one straight line, which were all almost eighty of them. The second they touched the blade light, they were fried into ashes right away. His one blade attack might have been more powerful than Lan Shanmei’s. Of course, it had also something to do with his blade aura, but Lan Shanmei’s blade speed was slightly faster.</p><p>“B*stard! Where did all of these great warriors come from?” As the tall middle-aged man was about to start to his mad killings, he was totally left shocked by Thunder Spirit King’s power.</p><p>“I will come test you out.”</p><p>The middle-aged man shook the iron fork he held and a silver blue shadow shot out, attacking toward the Thunder Spirit king. Although he was only at the second level of the Life and Death Challenge, his real form was that of the Tyrant Fish, who could fight across realms naturally. Otherwise, it would be impossible for him to be the leader of the Fifty Robbers Gang.</p><p>Ting! Ting! Paw! Paw!</p><p>The two started battling.</p><p>“They are all very powerful!”</p><p>Ye Chen recognized Lan Shanmei and Thunder Spirit King’s battling power. Lan Shanmei’s Demon Blade Spell had a very interesting way of using different forces. Combined with her profound martial arts, it was almost unbreakable and invincible. Meanwhile, Thunder Spirit King’s blade art was very generous. His body and power seemed to both be very powerful, as if he was a body cultivator himself. With the two being here, their power was unimaginable.</p><p>“Let’s kill him together!”</p><p>Ye Chen stood in the mid-air by himself. In front of him were dozens of warriors who had set him as the target, throwing out attacks at the same time to kill him.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>However, he disappeared from where he was standing.</p><p>“Twenty-seven sword attacks at the same time.”</p><p>In the air, Ye Chen made a grabbing gesture with his left sword finger and his Broken Blood Sword came out of the scabbard on its own, turning into twenty-seven sword shadows as it shot out.</p><p>Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!</p><p>Although the defensive sword spell might not be deadly for top level half step king warriors, it would be a calamity for Seas of Souls Realm warriors or beasts at rank 10. It all happened so quickly, like an arrow going through a piece of tofu. It only took one attack, and twenty-seven beams of sword shadows killed the entire batch of enemies.</p><p>“This one is powerful as well!”</p><p>At the front of the boat, the chubby elder saw how incredible Lan Shanmei and Thunder Spirit King’s attacks were, and could not help but become very happy at the situation. He felt that he might be able to get back to the Blood Sky Land for once this time. And by the time Ye Chen performed his sword art, he suddenly could not control his joyous expression anymore. He thought it was a sign that the universe was trying to protect him. He recognized the fact that Ye Chen had trained the defensive sword spell, which had been lost for centuries, and had already reached the twenty-seven swords stage.</p><p>The reason that Ye Chen was able to reach this level was because he was training his sword building skills, which improved his understanding of the sword art. If it were not for this level of improvement, he could not invest this amount of time on sword building instead of trying to increase his cultivation, since the Life and Death Realm secret realm was about to be open within half a year.</p><p>The defensive sword art was too powerful and sharp. In a sense, none of the other attacks besides the sword realm could make such speedy kills</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Letting out his soul power, Ye Chen increased his control over each of his sword shadows, pushing his twenty-seven sword shadows right into the enemies’ side.</p><p>Warriors from his side suddenly realized that the warriors that were fighting against them a minute ago suddenly lost their heads in the air. It continued to happen, making the opponent side disappear drastically. In the end, there were only less than a hundred people left.</p><p>“Ah! Why would it be like this?”</p><p>The middle aged man was blown backward by Thunder Spirit King’s blade attack. He took the time to look at the battle situation, but it was so shocking that he screamed in his head.</p><p>Thunder Spirit King chuckled. “If you want to take him down, there would probably have to be a top half step king warrior out here. But unfortunately, you do not have enough of those.”</p><p>“Mi Xie, take care of this brat first.”</p><p>Biting on his teeth, the tall middle-aged man passed on a message via soul power to Mi Xie, ordering him to kill Ye Chen first. The Ghost Lady should still last for a while in front of Lan Shanmei. As long as she made it through this tough period of time, then Mi Xie could kill Ye Chen and still gain a lot from this battle.</p><p>“Take care of yourself first.”</p><p>Thunder Spirit King held onto his blade with both of his hands before throwing out another blade attack. Thunder and lightning appeared, altering nature around them and smashing the tall man right into the ocean water.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A massive being broke through the water surface and reappeared: it was a massive tyrant fish with colorful patterns and bone spikes all over its body. In its mouth were rows of teeth which made it look like a shark. The man seemed to be ready for a death battle, so he returned to his original form, planning to kill Thunder Spirit King.</p><p>Over on the other side, Mi Xie separated from the Ghost Lady, jumping at Ye Chen.</p><p>“Brat, running into me might be the most unfortunate thing for you. I, Mi Xie, love to kill people who are more powerful than I am.” As he spoke, a circle of see-through pattern appeared and spread out. Those who touched the pattern suddenly drowned in an illusion and started to kill each other, regardless of which side they were on.</p><p>‘Using illusion on me? Ha!’</p><p>Ye Chen sneered and pretended to also be affected by the illusion, putting on a dull expression as if he was no long in his own consciousness.</p><p>“Haha, die!”</p><p>Seizing this chance, Mi Xie approached at a high speed and threw out a palm attack toward Ye Chen’s skull. If this attack landed right onto his body, Ye Chen’s head would definitely explode.</p><p>But all of a sudden, a sharp sword light appeared out of nowhere and a head was blown into the air.</p><p>With one sword, Mi Xie was killed instantly.</p><p>That illusion he used on Ye Chen was a big mistake. Earlier on, Ye Chen had faced the dream illusion performed by the Dream Eating Wolf, and was still able to wake up immediately. Although Mi Xie’s illusion was powerful, but it underestimated Ye Chen’s soul power. Ye Chen’s soul was not only more powerful than his, in a way, it was at Life and Death Realm warrior level.</p><p>If he did not use his illusion attack, then Ye Chen would have to use his Bewitching Mirror Destruction attack to kill him instantly, which would take more effort than the current normal sword attack.</p><p>“Ah! Please show mercy on me!”</p><p>In the distance, an ugly monkey covered in fur was running at full speed; it was indeed the Ghost Lady’s natural form. And the one chasing behind her was Lan Shanmei.</p><p>The latter could easily kill her, but Mi Xie had jumped in unexpectedly, and his power was quite effective on her. So, her blade accuracy was weakened considerably. But, the second Mi Xie left, she immediately regained her upper hand, beating her opponent into begging for mercy.</p><p>“Demon Cut!” She gently tilted her blade as she stopped her body.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>With that, the Ghost Lady’s body was separated in half, the stinky blood splashing everywhere.</p><p>Over on the other side, the Thunder Spirit King jumped onto Tyrant Fish’s head while holding his blade backward with both his hands and stabbed it right into his body.</p><p>“Thunder Cut!”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Countless twisting thunder appeared landing all over the Thunder Spirit King’s body and then poured into his great blade, all the way into the fish beast’s body.</p><p>Pap! Pop! Pap! Pop!</p><p>The beast’s body was burnt, and all of his vitality disappeared. He was killed instantly!</p><p>“What? All of the leaders are dead!”</p><p>Seeing that the Tyrant King Fish, the Ghost Lady, and Mi Xie, who were all top half step king warriors, were all dead, the remaining warriors lost their battling intent. Over on Full Moon Trade Team’s side, everyone got more and more excited. They had nothing to fear anymore, so they started to kill passionately.</p><p>The chubby elder was also happy, seeming rather cheerful. The Fifty Robbers Gang was famous for their brutality, but they had met their matches today. The three warriors here were all decisive and extremely powerful after all.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
