He had reached perfection in forging lower grade swords, and it had become as easy as flipping palms for him.</p><p>Arranging the mid grade materials, he began immediately.</p><p>The first mid grade sword was forged a week later. It was over a meter long with a black hilt, and its body gleamed with a cold light, giving off faint sparks. Pouring a trace of Zhen Yuan, a feet long fiery light burst forth.</p><p>The result of good foundation was instantly made apparent in the moment. This mid grade sword was actually not an inferior level mid grade sword, but at the mid level. Moreover, the difficulty of forging a mid grade sword was at least five times higher than a low grade one.</p><p>“If I, by myself, forge swords for a year. I’m afraid any seventh grade sect would never lack a sword.” Ye Chen smiled as he muttered.</p><p>“Indeed. But no seventh grade sect has a half-step King, and surely not a half-step King who is also a legendary sword forger.” Murong Qingcheng descended from the volcanic opening right at that moment.</p><p>“Right.”</p><p>Ye Chen nodded. It would already be a miracle for a half-step King to rise in a seventh grade. Adding a legendary sword forger on top, it would no longer be just a miracle, but an actual legend. However, both of the powers he had been affiliated with—Sky Cloud Sect and Ye Clan—were they not both seventh grade powers?</p><p>“How is your cultivation going?”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng said, “Dark Devour reached completion a week ago. So, I’m focusing on cultivating the Demonic Fist this week.”</p><p>“Your progress is pretty good!”</p><p>Dark Devour was not a high grade profound martial skill, but a peak mid grade one. However, due to the bizarreness of dark profound, the completion of this skill would have a considerable effect on Murong Qingcheng’s strength. Most importantly, through the course of taking this skill to completion, she must have made a large improvement in the dark profound as well. Next, she could create her own high grade profound martial skill.</p><p>As for the Demonic Fist inherited from the demonic clan, this fist art’s potential was enormous. Just a basic comprehension allowed her to injure Darklight King. Once she reached major completion of this skill, its might would likely surpass most of the high grade profound martial skills.</p><p>Like two months ago, the two chatted for a while and then went back to their own affairs.</p><p>After attaining the Sea of Soul realm, one would gain a lifespan of three hundred years. Thus, there was no need to care about every single day. Moreover, upon reaching Life and Death realm, one would gain a lifespan of a thousand years, which was ten times that of an ordinary person.</p><p>Forging mid grade swords was a lot more exhausting than low grade swords, and the efficiency also lowered considerably. Even after becoming efficient, he could only forge five to six swords a day at most.</p><p>Fortunately, Ye Chen had no lack of patience. Compared to the sword forging masters with cultivation base of Reality Condensing Realm, his efficiency was simply astonishing. Higher cultivation base implied greater efficiency and speed in most matters. For example, giving the edge to a mid grade sword was nothing difficult for him. He merely needed to swipe his hand over the blade.</p><p>“Lower grade swords can’t hold much sword intent, thus the amplification is limited. However, mid grade swords are different. I wonder if my high or peak upper grade swords’ power will rival that of a semi supreme grade sword. It does seem possible.”</p><p>How strong were the fifth step Destruction Sword Intent and fourth grade Immortal Sword Intent? Just a strand of them contained an immense might. Other sword artists would not be able to accomplish such a feat, because their sword intent would be lacking compared to Ye Chen. Their swords would neither be as strong nor as durable as Ye Chen’s. Even if they used special techniques, they would not be able to catch up to him, and instead, would spend more time in the forging process.</p><p>…</p><p>While Ye Chen was forging the mid grade swords, someone was searching for him and Murong Qingcheng. It was none other than the black-robed old man who was heavily injured by the Mysterious Yin King in the Mysterious Yin Pagoda.</p><p>The black-robed old man had one of his arms slashed off and suffered substantial damage to his heart, losing cultivation base equivalent to several hundred years. Fortunately, the Demonic Human Clan was quite resourceful and had no lack of mystical treasures. After recuperating for several months, he had restored his cultivation base to its peak.</p><p>As soon his cultivation base restored, he headed to Treasurelight Oceanspan to look for traces of Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng. He arrived at Gemstone Islands a few days ago, and upon hearing the information about them, he instantly headed south.</p><p>“This kid even killed the Darklight King! He is quite capable! A pity that he won’t be able to escape before me even if his tricks reach the heavens.” The black-robed man coldly smiled.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>The black-robed old man was traveling in the void, tearing the space. At an interval of hundred thousand li, his majestic soul power swept everything in that radius. Not even a sound escaped his perception in this region.</p><p>Half a day later, the black-robed old man frowned, “Could they have changed directions or travelled nonstop?”</p><p>Every time he next appeared, he would be a hundred thousand li away. His speed was hundreds of folds faster than a half-step King. A half a day of his search was equivalent to one to two hundred days of search of a normal half-step King. If he found nothing, it only meant two possibilities: his target had changed routes, or was travelling without rest.</p><p>“I don’t believe you can escape from me!”</p><p>Rip!</p><p>The black-robed man ripped the space and disappeared once again.</p><p>…</p><p>“Finally, my first supreme quality mid grade sword!” Inside the volcano, Ye Chen was holding an exquisite golden sword. The sword had a purple hilt and a slender golden blade. Beautiful runes spread out from both sides of the sword’s back, giving off a holy feel to the sword like a general giving off a king’s aura and killing intent before going to battle.</p><p>Creak!</p><p>Holding the sword, Ye Chen slashed at the lava lake before him. The lake split apart for several meters deep, creating a feet long gorge. The remnant sword Qi didn’t dissipate but continued on and struck the volcano’s wall, bursting out with a powerful sword light, giving off an invincible feeling.</p><p>“As I thought, this sword’s power is equivalent to a mid level upper grade sword.”</p><p>The Golden Sword was infused with the Immortal Sword Intent, making its body way sturdier than any mid grade sword. For that matter, it could easily clash with an upper grade sword. Its sword Qi was almost indestructible, possessing a frightening tenacity. This was the power of the Immortal Sword Intent. The Destruction Sword Intent emphasized on destruction while Immortal Sword emphasized on tenacity. One was external and the other internal, the two fitting together beautifully.</p><p>“Next is to increase the quality of mid grade swords and increase the chances of making a supreme quality mid grade sword to more than thirty percent.”</p><p>Currently, Ye Chen had thirty percent chance of creating an average mid grade sword, forty percent chance of creating a good quality mid grade sword, and less than one percent chance to create a supreme quality mid grade sword. This was the sword Ye Chen had been most pleased with.</p><p>“Let’s call it Arms Destroyer!”</p><p>Extending his index finger, Ye Chen carved two words on the sword. With two great sword intents and half-step King cultivation base, carving on a mid grade sword was as easy as flipping palms for him. Under his control, these words would not damage the quality of sword either.</p><p>This was the first name he had given to a sword.</p><p>Tossing Arms Destroyer into his storage ring, Ye Chen continued forging mid grade swords. Upon reaching perfection in mid grade sword forging, he intended to leave the island with Murong Qingcheng. After all, it was not possible to stay here forever, and he could continue to study Sword Forging Art even after reaching his destination.</p><p>Just like that, two days passed by.</p><p>During this period, Ye Chen successfully forged two supreme quality mid grade swords. His chances were approaching twenty percent. One of the swords was thunder attributed, infused with the Destruction Sword Intent, and the other was water attributed, infused with the Immortal Sword Intent. The might of thunder attributed sword even surpassed Arms Destroyer, whereas the water attribute sword’s might lacked somewhat.</p><p>“Eh! Why do I feel a bad premonition?”</p><p>Suddenly, Ye Chen raised his head and looked into the sky through the volcanic opening. It was only bowl-sized expanse of sky with white clouds drifting and a gentle wind blowing.</p><p>Thousands of li away, the black-robed old man appeared from the void. As always, he released his soul power, covering an area of a hundred thousand li. However, he had no hope by now.</p><p>Silently, his soul power swept through the volcanic island.</p><p>“Haha!” Suddenly, the black-robed old man heartily laughed.</p><p>On the volcanic island were two living being: one male and one female. Who could it be if not Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng, whom he had been searching?</p><p>“Let’s see how you escape this time.” The black-robed old man tore the space and entered the void.</p><p>“Not good, a Life-and-Death King!”</p><p>Ye Chen’s face changed inside the volcano. His soul power was already at the level of a Life-and Death King. When the black-robed old man’s soul power perceived him, he also sensed the former’s soul power. The third silver eye, which had just been opened, closed. There was no need for the silver eye to know that his guest was a Life-and-Death King, and there was an eighty percent chance that this King didn’t come with good intentions.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>A huge hole burst open in the volcano and Ye Chen flew out.</p><p>“Murong, escape!” Ye Chen lightly shouted at Murong Qingcheng, who was not far away.</p><p>“Escape?” Seeing Ye Chen’s grave expression, Murong Qingcheng’s heart leapt. His grave expression meant a disaster. Amidst surging demonic power, huge black bat wings appeared at her back. Her figure flickered as she shot upwards while Ye Chen followed swiftly after her.</p><p>“Where are you going?”</p><p>The island’ weather changed. At some point, a whirling energy shell had locked the island, as if covered by a huge bowl.</p><p>Peng! Murong Qingcheng punched at the shell, creating faint ripples but was unable to open it in the slightest.</p><p>“Bewitching Mirror Shattering!”</p><p>Unsheathing the Evil Vanquishing Sword, Ye Chen instantly revealed his ace.</p><p>Bewitching Mirror Shattering contained the space profound and was intrinsically able to breach barriers. As a result, the barrier abruptly warped and a small opening appeared in it. Meanwhile. the two rushed straight at the opening.</p><p>“You actually know space profound!” The black-robed old man was astounded. Whether he believed it or not, Ye Chen’s space profound was superior to his. “Unfortunately, it’s not enough.”</p><p>The black-robed old man pulled at the void. Warped energies quickly mended the opening, even making it protrude a little bit.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
