Although he was closer to Ye Chen, one was an energy attack while the other was a movement art. Logically speaking, the former should have arrived first. However, the long-haired youngster arrived first before the demonic energy falcon and destroyed it with a palm strike</p><p>“So fast!” The hawk-like-hook-nosed youngster was astonished.</p><p>“So powerful!”</p><p>Although the latter had destroyed the energy falcon, his palm had also turned a bit numb, and blood Qi was soaring.</p><p>“Who are you? Can I ask for a name?” The hawk-nosed youngster grimly said.</p><p>The long-haired youngster said indifferently, “Feng Piaoling.”</p><p>“Feng Piaoling, ranked fourteen on the Life and Death Substitute List? No wonder you have such strength!” The hawk-nosed youngster understood at once. Every individual on this list was a powerful young expert, and fourteen was a rank that was much higher than that of Young Tiger Lord.</p><p>“Then, who are you?” Feng Piaoling asked back.</p><p>“Young Eagle Lord!”</p><p>“One of the eight young beast lords, Young Eagle Lord!” Feng Piaoling had heard of Young Eagle Lord’s fame. This person was the same as Ye Chen and Dugu Jue, usurping the older generation on Blood Sky Continent. His strength was well above Young Tiger Lord’s, seeming immeasurable. It was said that the number seventeen on Life and Death Substitute List was easily defeated by him.</p><p>Creak!</p><p>Blood splashed as Ye Chen pulled his sword out and retreated three steps.</p><p>“You dare kill me! I’ll make you…regret!”</p><p>Young Tiger Lord coarsely spoke while clutching his throat. Although Ye Chen’s sword seemed to have merely pierced his throat, the powerful Destruction Sword Intent it brought along had already followed his throat to shatter his internal organs, crushing his vitality.</p><p>“Go on and start your preparations.” Ye Chen didn’t care too much about Young Tiger Lord’s threat. If this much was enough to scare him, there was no need to come here at all.</p><p>“Just…you…wait!”</p><p>As he spoke these three words, his body turned increasingly dim and ultimately disappeared.</p><p>“What a mysterious place!” A slight frown appeared on Ye Chen’s face. This place gave them a power similar to that of being ‘reborn from a drop of blood’. Dying here didn’t mean true death; it merely meant being transported out. Of course, being transported out prematurely was also a huge loss.</p><p>Killing Young Tiger Lord with a single sword strike elevated Ye Chen’s image in the eyes of Blood Sky Continent’s young experts to another level. Henceforth, there wouldn’t be many who would dare to provoke him. After all, he even killed Young Tiger Lord, so who would care about them?</p><p>“You’ve killed Young Tiger Lord, causing him to leave Life and Death Mysterious Realm prematurely. After leaving this place, you’ll be in a big trouble. Unfortunately, it’s already too late for regrets.”</p><p>Young Eagle Lord wasn’t arrogant enough to think that he could deal with both Ye Chen Feng Piaoling alone. Both of them combined could easily threaten life. Moreover, he and Young Tiger Life were not too close. He only acted because he couldn’t bear to see a person of Blood Sky Continent being killed. At this moment, he was looking at Ye Chen as if looking at a dead man.</p><p>Feng Piaoling sneered, “Ye Chen doesn’t lack a King’s backing on True Spirit Continent either. You should have heard of Mysterious Queen. Who in Sky Tiger Sect would dare to disregard Mysterious Queen?”</p><p>He didn’t mention Dragon King because Dragon King’s fame was at the peak back in the day, yet he was currently quite low-key and only famous among Life-and-Death Kings. However,the Mysterious Queen was different. She had gathered fame merely twenty-thirty years ago. There was almost nobody in True Spirit World who didn’t know her name, and it was especially the case for the younger generation.</p><p>“Mysterious Queen!”</p><p>Hearing Feng Piaoling’s words, Young Eagle Lord was indeed stunned. Mysterious Queen was not only the genius of millennium on True Spirit Continent, but the whole True Spirit World. In her entire journey to Life and Death realm, she was basically unrivalled. Her fame was simply too resounding. If she was protecting Ye Chen, even Sky Tiger Sect wouldn’t dare to make a move.</p><p>“Water from far away is of little use before the fire right before you. Moreover, you think ten great beast sects of Blood Sky Continent will allow Kings of other places to do as they please?”</p><p>Leaving these words, Young Eagle Lord turned into a rainbow colored light and left. Seeing him leave, other young experts of Blood Sky Continent naturally had no intention of staying. They secretly sized-up Ye Chen and exhaled.</p><p>Once all the people from Blood Sky Continent had left, Feng Piaoling walked to Ye Chen and said, “I’ve been waiting to meet you. I’m Wind Pavilion’s Feng Piaoling.”</p><p>Wind Pavilion was one of the nine great sects of True Spirit Continent, and was considered as one of the Twin Pavilions along with Evil King’s Evil King Pavilion.</p><p>“Cauldron King Sect, Jihai Ruo!”</p><p>Although Cauldron King Sect was not one of the nine great sects, it was a powerhouse fifth grade sect, and Jihai Ruo was ranked eighteen on Life and Death Substitute List.</p><p>“Sky Cloud Sect, Ye Chen!” Ye Chen faintly nodded with a smile and introduced himself.</p><p>Feng Piaoling returned a smile and said, “We know. You come from Ye family and are Sky Cloud Sect’s Supreme Elder. Among the numerous young talents of True Spirit Continent, your origins are the humblest. You have my admiration.”</p><p>The three began to chat without putting on any airs.</p><p>“Ye Chen, you’ve killed Young Tiger Lord. I’m afraid that Sky Tiger Sect won’t be able to swallow this. You better be careful.” Feng Piaoling warned Ye Chen.</p><p>“Right. Although Sky Tiger Sect is no match for the Mysterious Sect, you’re here on the Blood Sky Continent. The Kings of the two regions rarely interact and visit each other’s territories.”</p><p>Ye Chen smiled bitterly, “I’ve not only killed Young Tiger Lord, but Young Wolf Lord too.”</p><p>“What, you killed Young Wolf Lord too! I don’t know what to say!” Jihai Ruo’s eyes were left wide open. They were different from Ye Chen, having entered from the True Spirit Continent, and thus, would appear back at True Spirit Continent. Even if they were to kill young geniuses of Blood Sky Continent, the forces of Blood Sky Continent would not be able to hold them accountable in True spirit Continent. However, Ye Chen entered from Blood Sky Continent.</p><p>“Eh!”</p><p>Feng Piaoling shook his head in sympathy as well as helplessness.</p><p>“I’ll take one step at a time. Perhaps I will be able to force my way through all this.” Ye Chen was not a timid person. He had confidence that as long as he could enter the third layer of life-and-death chamber, he would be able to resist even Kings. After all, he was already not behind Kings in many aspects, and was even superior in some; for example, fifth step Destruction Sword Intent and his understanding of profound. He only lacked in Zhen Yuan and durability of his body.</p><p>“Let’s hope that will be the case.”</p><p>In their hearts, Feng Piaoling and Jihai Ruo didn’t wish to see Ye Chen fail. It would be simply too unfortunate for such a genius to perish, losing all his brilliance.</p><p>“Thanks for the help, Ye Chen!”</p><p>Bei Minghui’s injury was not too heavy. Adding the healing effect of Life-and-Death Mysterious Realm, he quickly recovered and then cupped his fists at Ye Chen.</p><p>“It’s fine. We’re people of True Spirit Continent. Internal competition is just that, internal competition. I’ll obviously not watch such a thing with my arms crossed.” Ye Chen said.</p><p>“You’re right.”</p><p>Bei Minghui had a new understanding of Ye Chen, and he began to consider him as a friend in addition to a rival.</p><p>Afterward, Ye Chen and Situ Hao chatted for a few moments. Speaking of which, the two had also resolved their hostilities and exchanged martial skills.</p><p>As this matter concluded, another huge fight broke out on the other side of the enclosed region. However, this fight had no spectators.</p><p>It was between a man and a woman. The man had a ripped body and broad limbs; his aura was fierce and tyrannous, and it didn’t pale even compared to Chu Zhontian. His weapon was a pair of swords. In his right hand was a huge sword that was as tall as his body, while his left had a slender sword. His two swords—big and small, broad and slender, seamlessly blended together. They left no openings and gave off a blinding splendor.</p><p>The woman, on the other hand, was a gentle looking beauty in a golden robe. If Ye Chen were present, his heart would have sped up. This woman was none other than Xu Jing, whom he had not seen for many years. Apart from being gentle and calm, the current Xu King also seemed to give off a feminine valor and aggressiveness.</p><p>Bang Bang Bang!</p><p>The battle was intense as if countless meteors were smashing into each other.</p><p>“Take my sword!”</p><p>The muscled youngster raised the huge sword in his right hand and chopped down, giving off a blinding sword light. In response, the ground split apart, creating a dozens of meters long tunnel even before the sword passed through.</p><p>With a clang, Xu Jing punched the sword, causing sparks to fly everywhere. Her power seemed soft and gentle, but it almost rendered the muscled youngster incapable of keeping his hold over the huge sword. Her fist seemed to pack a huge mountain in it.</p><p>“How can this woman have such frightening strength!”</p><p>The muscled youngster was appalled. He could tell that Xu Jing was a body refiner; moreover, not an ordinary one. He himself could be considered a body refiner. Even in his eyes, Xu Jing’s strength was simply too extreme. His sword arts seemed incapable of getting through.</p><p>“I, Marquis Sword Tyrant, don’t believe that I can’t do anything to you.”</p><p>Marquis Sword Tyrant came from another continent—the Sword Sky Continent. He was one of the ten great young sword artists of the continent and specialized in the Slaughter Sword Intent as well as dual sword arts. Usually ‘Strongest’ half-step Kings didn’t even have qualifications to make him use both swords. However, Xu Jing’s strength was beyond his imagination. If he had not brought out both swords, he wouldn’t even have lasted three moves.</p><p>The instant his body lost balance, the slender sword in his left hand thrusted at Xu Jing’s forehead while giving off a faint glow which could be easily overlooked in the blinding splendor of the huge sword.</p><p>Without sparing a glance, Xu King flicked her finger at the slender sword.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The slender sword also bounced off. Meanwhile, raising her right leg, Xu Jing kicked at his chest.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>Like a cannonball, Marquis Sword Tyrant’s body shot back while spraying a fountain of blood. His peak half supreme grade armor, which was no worse than pseudo supreme grade armor, clearly showed a faint depression. The bones in his chest region had shattered into countless fragments as wekk.</p><p>‘F*ck! How so powerful…’</p><p>Marquis Sword Tyrant felt unresigned, and he forcefully stopped his retreating figure. But, the rebound caused him to spurt another mouthful of blood. With a completely white face, he said, “My strongest move is Star Slaughtered, created from the Slaughter Sword Intent. Behold and die!”</p><p>Taking in a deep breath, he leapt up. From high above, his two swords chopped down in a criss-crossed manner. The sword light interwove into a cross like a star twinkling in the night, swift and bleak.</p><p>“Star Shatterer!”</p><p>Xu Jing stood her ground as her long hair fluttered without wind like a dancing flame. She punched out, freezing the space and darkening the sky. Starlight flickered everywhere as if the world had turned into a starry sky. Immediately afterward, one of the stars shattered, and that star was exactly where Marquis Sword Tyrant was present.</p><p>The latter’s body gradually dimmed. One could see a huge hole in his chest that had turned illusory and bloodless.</p><p>Raising her head, Xu Jing said indifferently, “Both are sword artists, but you’re far lacking from him.” Ye Chen’s image flickered in her eyes.</p><p>“Who is he?”</p><p>He was desperate to know who she was talking about, but he had already died. On reappearance, he would unfortunately be on the Sky Sword Continent.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
