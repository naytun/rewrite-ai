If Xu Jing’s Sacred Dragon Fist was the number one, Marquis Sword Snow’s fifth strike was definitely the second, and third was Marquis Sword Snow’s Freezing Sword Point. Although it was much weaker than Marquis Sword Star’s fifth star, it was not nearly by twice. The current Freezing Sword Star, which had doubled its might, had definitely surpassed Marquis Sword Star’s fifth strike, Meteor Fall.</p><p>Most importantly, once the compression power of Freezing Sword Point entered the opponent’s body, it would bring about an unparalleled cold Qi and sword Qi hurricane. The current Marquis Sword Snow most likely had the power to deal with a peak level evil spirit.</p><p>“There is still time…Let’s aim for one step further.”</p><p>Marquis Sword Snow had no intentions of comprehending profound further. He had only comprehended two profounds—water profound and ice profound, both of which were at eighty percent completion. The difficulty of raising their realm to ninety percent completion was extremely high. Thus, rather than wasting his time here, he would focus on integrating the two instead.</p><p>The final three days…</p><p>Under the waterfall…</p><p>Yi…!</p><p>A longsword gleaming with a dull golden hue pierced out with an incomparable sharpness and flexibility. These two types of completely different styles seemed to have integrated in this single sword strike, which caused this sword to sever the waterfall and split the space open without a leaking a single bit of power outside. All the power remained concentrated within the sword; this sword strike was hard and powerful, yet soft and tenacious.</p><p>‘Gold births water, and water contains gold!’</p><p>“The water profound has also reached eighty percent completion!” Ye Chen walked out of the waterfall and circulated his Zhen Yuan, evaporating the water droplets on his body.</p><p>On the seventh day, Ye Chen’s water profound had advanced to the seventy percent completion realm, and in the following ten days, it attained the eighty percent completion realm. Expecting another breakthrough in the remaining two days was simply not realistic.</p><p>Standing by the lake, he was immersed in the aftertaste of the sword strike he had just issued. The sword strike just now was not Waning Moon at all. Waning Moon still had some rough aspects. Regardless of how much metal profound and water profound improved, its might would still be somewhat limited. It was just like a low level profound martial skill could only hold a limited profound, and one had to create mid level profound skills, and ultimately high level profound skills.</p><p>In the same manner, when the profound reached an even higher realm, it needed to be contained in an even stronger move.</p><p>High level profound martial skills could have a great or low might. A high level profound martial skill with intense power could actually be ten to twenty folds stronger than the lowest level profound martial skills.</p><p>Therefore, high level profound martial skills were also divided into many sublevels.</p><p>The lowest level of high grade profound martial skills were called ordinary high grade profound martial skills, followed by lower step high grade profound martial skills, then mid step, higher step, and perfect high grade profound martial skills. If categorized, Waning Moon was only a high grade lower step profound martial skill. However, the sword strike just now was almost reaching mid step. Although the difference between the two was of only a small grade, their might differed by at least a few folds.</p><p>Previously, Ye Chen used to think that Waning Moon had the potential to become a top-notch profound martial skill. As long as metal profound and water profound reached completion, he thought Waning Moon could become a peak profound martial skill; however, it seemed impossible now. As his realm increased, his perspective on things also changed. What he thought then was only valid for that time, and Waning Moon was something he had created at that time.</p><p>How could a sword move he had created back then compare to the sword move he created now?</p><p>“Metal profound ninety percent, and water profound eighty percent…It’s still quite off from greater completion, not to mention perfection. Who knows how well this move will turn out as my realm increases? With the improvement of my metal profound and water profound, I believe that I can create even stronger sword moves. Anyhow, I better give this sword art a name first.”</p><p>To summarize a collection of moves in a sword could always be done.</p><p>“Let’s call it Autumn Water Sword Art!”</p><p>“Waning Moon will be the first style of Autumn Water Sword Art, and this move will be the second style. The next move will be the third style, the fourth, fifth…up to the point when metal and water profound reach perfection.”</p><p>Autumn Waters evoked a feeling of limpid waters, calm eyes, and steely resolve.</p><p>After naming the sword arts came naming the sword move.</p><p>Recalling that sword, he realized that it had an exceptionally condensed and repressed sword Qi. The tip of the sword seemed hard and strong, yet soft and tenacious. A name appeared in Ye Chen’s mind—Congealing Water.</p><p>Water was soft yet congealed. It evoked the feeling of extremely condensed water that could cut through steel.</p><p>Congealing Water—Autumn Water Sword Art’s second style!</p><p>“Autumn Water is already completed, but there is still a room for improvement in terms of profound integration. The higher the degree of integration, the more condensed the sword energy would be, and that much easier it would be to pierce through strong things.”</p><p>Expelling all distracting thoughts from his mind, Ye Chen focussed on polishing Congealing Water.</p><p>Unwittingly, time passed to the final day before the closing of the secret realm. At this moment, many had already stopped their comprehension and were exchanging pointers.</p><p>In the center of the garden was a huge empty land, and most of the people were gathered here.</p><p>“Dugu Jue is here!”</p><p>Not far away from the empty land, a young man with a head full of white hair was walking over.</p><p>“Do you dare to fight a round with me?” Dugu Jue said to Young Undying Demon Lord.</p><p>“Courting death!” The latter sneered and walked out of the crowd.</p><p>Young Undying Demon Lord had also made some gains from the twenty days of comprehension. His water profound had increased from sixty percent to seventy percent completion. Although his dark profound didn’t improve, his strength had still increased considerably.”</p><p>“Young Undying Demon Lord is ranked eighth, and Dugu Jue is ranked twelveth. Although Dugu Jue’s improvement is huge, Young Undying Demon Lord must have made some progress as well. This battle is completely out there!”</p><p>The spectators surrounding them discussed in hushed tones.</p><p>“Take my blade!”</p><p>Dugu Jue swept his blade forth, using his strongest move straightaway. The pale white light emanating from his blade contained the death dao and seemed as if it could extinguish any lifeforce in its way. Moreover, this blade seemed much swifter and much more resolute, carrying all the despair carried inside him.</p><p>“Impossible…So strong!”</p><p>Young Undying Demon Lord’s scalp went numb, and his pupils shrank into needle tips. He roared and punched out, which was precisely his famed Chaotic Demon Fist.</p><p>Clank!</p><p>The blade light creased past the fist energy, disintegrating it as it went. Like a hot knife cutting through butter, Dugu Jue slashed underneath Young Undying Demon Lord’s neck.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>A huge fountain of blood erupted, with Young Undying Demon Lord’s figure swaying away.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Dugu Jue’s figure spun and slashed off Young Undying Demon Lord’s neck.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>A head with its eyes wide open flew off. In the next moment, the Young Undying Demon Lord appeared outside Life and Death Secret Realm.</p><p>Hiss!</p><p>Sounds of sharp breaths could be heard one after another as everybody looked at Dugu Jue with their eyes wide open. In these twenty days, the improvement of Dugu Jue was so huge that Young Undying Demon Lord wasn’t even able to fight back after taking a single blade strike, and then lost his life with the next one.</p><p>“Frightening! Not only does True Spirit Continent have so many geniuses, each one of them is so frightening.</p><p>“Great decider blade!” On a hilltop, Lashan Mei clapped.</p><p>“Come, fight!”</p><p>Dugu Jue’s battle intent was soaring.</p><p>Lashan Mei shook her head, “Even after comprehending the Death dao, you’re not my opponent.”</p><p>“That’s not up to you to decide.” Dugu Jue pounced over, and his blade appearing again.</p><p>“I told you, you’re not my opponent.”</p><p>As a practitioner of demonic dao, how could Lashan Mei be afraid? Since Dugu Jue was forcing her to fight, she didn’t mind sending him out.</p><p>“Demonic Chop!”</p><p>Black blade light dazzled the surroundings, containing a vibrational power far surpassing the previous ones.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Soon, Dugu Jue’s body was blasted off while Lashan Mei closely followed after him. Her figure swept past his and blood spurted out as a blade scar extended from Dugu Jue’s forehead to his neck.</p><p>Dugu Jue had lost!</p><p>Lashan Mei sheathed her blade back with a tranquil expression.</p><p>“Hehe, my Blood Sky Continent’s peak geniuses are not inferior to True Spirit Continent’s. Dugu Jue was strong, being able to kill Young Undying Demon Lord in two strikes, but he still lost to Lashan Mei.”</p><p>Blood Sky Continent’s young experts felt proud.</p><p>“Look…Marquis Sword Star and Marquis Sword Snow are here.”</p><p>It was Sky Sword Continent’s turn to speak.</p><p>Marquis Sword Star came from east, and Marquis Sword Snow came from the west. Seeing the two, who completely ignored everybody else but looked at each other with intense battle intent, everybody felt a bit strange.</p><p>“What’s going on? Marquis Sword Snow and Marquis Sword Star want to fight?”</p><p>The experts from Sky Sword Continent frowned.</p><p>“Marquis Sword Star, I will not use sword domain to fight against you.” Although Marquis Sword Snow’s voice was calm, his battle intent was still on the rise.</p><p>“Then you’ll die without a doubt.” Marquis Sword Star sneered.</p><p>“Then come, show me your Seven Star Sword Art’s fifth strike, Meteor Fall.” This was the strongest move amongst all the sword artists present. Thus, Marquis Sword Snow wanted to test his Freezing Sword Point against Marquis Sword Star.</p><p>“Alright, let me help you then.”</p><p>Marquis Sword Star didn’t waste any words either as he unsheathed Lupus and pierced forward. The sword still seemed as frightening as before, carrying the death light of an exploding star, but some people discovered that it seemed much smoother and mellower than before, indicating that it was closing in on greater completion.</p><p>In response, Marquis Sword Snow’s face remained unchanged as he instantly unsheathed his white longsword. This time, his sword Qi didn’t have a trace of leak and was completely condensed on the tip of his sword, forming a glass bead like white-colored energy sphere.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>A large amount of cold Qi erupted, freezing the ground and causing the spectators to retreat in haste.</p><p>“Your Freezing Sword Point’s might is actually more than double.” Half of Marquis Sword Star’s body had frozen over, and even his face had many cracks.</p><p>“Your Meteor Fall is not weak either.”</p><p>Marquis Sword Snow looked down and saw a bloody hole in his chest. The blood flowing out of his chest had no vitality.</p><p>Kacha!</p><p>Marquis Sword Star’s body shattered in one half, and he was transported out of the secret realm along with his armor and Lupus. On the other hand, although Marquis Sword Snow had weakened a lot, he didn’t die.</p><p>Clearly, this battle was Marquis Sword Snow’s victory.</p><p>“Haha…My earth profound has finally reached seventy percent completion. Who dares to fight with me!”</p><p>Rumble…</p><p>The ground shook as a tall figure walked over—he was Young Elephant Lord.</p><p>Young Elephant Lord was in extremely high spirits. He, whose principal route of cultivation was strength, also cultivated an earth attributed profound skill. The improvement of his earth profound filled him with endless confidence. It should be known that beasts didn’t have high comprehension, but their bodies were extremely strong. Therefore, even a slight improvement in profound meant a huge leap in strength for him.</p><p>Young Elephant Lord saw Ye Chen walking in the distance, so he pointed at the latter and said, “Ye Chen, do you dare fight a round?” Sword Domain only had exaggerated effects on sword artists. As a body refiner, he belonged to the group of people who were least affected by the sword domain.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
