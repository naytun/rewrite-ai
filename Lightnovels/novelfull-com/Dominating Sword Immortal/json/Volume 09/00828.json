But, since he was here now, he would not let the situation worsen. Even if he had to spend a lot of effort and time, it would all be worth it. Of course, he would not leave behind his own training, since nothing mattered except power itself at the end of the day.</p><p>Walking in front, Ye Chen was followed by a group of disciples.</p><p>“Brother Gao, who do you think he is?” On the side, Li Cui passed on a message with Zhen yuan.</p><p>“If it were an opponent, then he did not have to be this friendly with us. Therefore, that option can basically be eliminated.” Gao Zhiyuan shook his head. He did not really know who Ye Chen was. He could only base his opinion on what he got and try to analyze. But unfortunately, no matter how hard he tried, he could not understand why Ye Chen would say that he was one of them, since he did not remember a powerful martial genius in the history of Zhang Tian Martial School.</p><p>He was already a martial genius himself. If he had enough resources, he thought he could reach Late Sea of Souls Realm. But, he was still nothing compared to Ye Chen. The latter had been around for so long and he had not noticed it at all. From his aura, he could vaguely sense a kind of peak power, as if the other was looking at them from a very tall mountain.</p><p>What kind of a martial genius is he?</p><p>“He is so young!” Wu Zhangxing was always straightforward. Although he said it quietly, everyone still heard it.</p><p>Now that he mentioned it, everyone started to notice Ye Chen’s appearance. Since they were all shocked by his aura, they never paid close attention to his face precisely.</p><p>Ye Chen looked like he was just twenty-two years old, which meant he must not have aged beyond that after he broke through Astral Reaching Realm.</p><p>Braking through Astral Reaching Realm at twenty-two and breaking through to Sea of Souls Realm at in the same year should be impossible. With that logic, Ye Chen would be even a couple of years younger when he reached the realm.</p><p>“If he reached Astral Reaching Realm at only seventeen or eighteen, then…”</p><p>Including Gao Zhiyuan, everyone was shocked by their thoughts. Within one thousand years of history of Blood Sky Land, not one of them was able to break through to the realm at that age. Nineteen was the record, but it might have been broken now by Ye Chen.</p><p>(Side note: Before the Astral Reaching Realm, warriors would have about one hundred years’ worth of lifespan, and the appearance and age would increase normally. Once one reached Astral Reaching Realm, the lifespan would be increased to two hundred years, and appearance and age would change at a speed fifty percent slower than before. Once one reached Sea of Souls Realm, the lifespan would be 300 years, and the aging speed would be one-thirds of the normal speed.)</p><p>However, what they did not know was that Ye Chen actually reached the Astral Reaching Realm when he was nineteen, which was one and a half years later than Mysterious Queen. However, since he reached Sea of Souls Realm in a very short time, he still looked very young.</p><p>Ye Chen and the others were halfway to the peak when all of the top warriors of the school gathered on the peak. There were three Late Sea of Souls Realm warriors, nine Mid Sea of Souls Realm warriors, and twenty Early Sea of Souls Realm warriors. There were thirty-two Sea of Souls Realm warriors in total, and including Gao Zhiyuan, there would be thirty-three of them. Within rank 6 martial schools, thirty-three Sea of Souls Realm warriors was already quite good, way more powerful than any rank 6 martial school in the South Rudra Region.</p><p>“Leader, this newcomer is very young. But, he looks rather friendly, and does not seem like he has got a killing intent. However, we have never seen this person before. I wonder what do you think?” One of the three leading Late Sea of Souls Realm warriors was talking to an elder with white hair.</p><p>It was indeed the leader of the Zhang Tian Martial School, called Li Zhangfeng. He looked rather like a scholar than a warrior. Exhaustion was deep but well-hidden between his eyebrows. He thought quietly for a while before starting to talk, “I have also not met this person before. We cannot be reckless even though he might seem friendly. After all, some people like to pretend before killing.”</p><p>“Leader, you are right. Before, they just fought their way up the mountain and bullied us, but recently, these people have become evil and started to play those cruel games. Today, I have decided that I will fight him even if it means death.</p><p>“Master Liu, do not be rash. Wait until he comes up the mountain, and we can find out whether he is a friend or an enemy for sure.” Li Zhangfeng stared at the path, putting on his highest guard. Behind him, the senior masters, staff, and thousands of disciples were all staring without even blinking. Some of them had even started sweating.</p><p>After a pot tea worth of time, Ye Chen arrived at the peak.</p><p>“So young?”</p><p>There were not many people who had the ability to spread out soul power, so most of them could only use their mental power. And for Ye Chen who was so powerful with his invincible sword intent, no one could sense him with mental power even if he was right there.</p><p>Therefore, when Ye Chen finally walked into people’s sight, some of them were shocked.</p><p>“Perhaps he is the No.1 martial genius from Extreme Sky Martial School, Ling Huyi?” Some of the disciples guessed.</p><p>“Leader!”</p><p>After climbing up the mountain, Gao Zhiyuan did not follow behind Ye Chen anymore and went back to the side where his school was on. Everyone was now standing in front of Ye Chen.</p><p>“It is good that you came back.”</p><p>A Late Sea of Souls Realm warrior on Li Zhangfeng’s left gave Gao Zhiyuan a deep look. He could tell from his eyes that he had decided to stay, which was great news for the school.</p><p>“Leader, master, I am ashamed to see you.” He dropped his head with guilt.</p><p>“Zhiyuan, it is us who are ashamed, so you do not need to be. Right now, let’s forget about this and deal with what is in front of us.” Li Zhangfeng let out a smile at him before turning his head to look at Y Chen again. “May I ask, why Sir are you here at our school?”</p><p>Ye Chen glanced at the school’s lineup and slightly frowned. For a rank 6 martial institution, there were quite a bit of powerful warriors. But, there were not enough disciples at all, only thousands of them. Normally, there would be at least ten thousand, or even one hundred thousand disciples in a school of this rank.</p><p>Ye Chen’s frowning was misunderstood by Li Zhangfeng, and thought that the latter was being ignorant. He could not help but start to sound a bit unfriendly, “Although there are not many warriors in our school, we are not just another ordinary school. Sir, why are you here? If it is nothing too important, I would like to ask you to leave.”</p><p>Slightly letting out a breath, Ye Chen said with seriousness, “Technically, I am also a disciple of Battle King!”</p><p>“What?” Li Zhangfeng’s eyes were wide open. People could almost see the light coming out of his eyes. “He said he is a disciple of Battle King? So, Battle King is still alive?”</p><p>Not only him, everyone else was shocked. The school’s original name was called Immortal Sword Master School, which was something that almost everyone knew. It was founded by Battle King himself, which meant he was the founding father of the school. Hence, all of his legends had been taught to the children. For that matter, a lot of people in Blood Sky Land respected him. Especially his enemies, they had not been unafraid of him even for a single day.</p><p>“This good Sir, so you are saying that you are the disciple of Battle King? Perhaps he is somehow still alive?” The Late Sea of Souls Realm warrior right next to Li Zhangfeng looked at Ye Chen with high hope.</p><p>When Battle King founded the school, he was not even one hundred years old. Right now, he would only be seven hundred something in age, and it was highly likely for him to still be alive. If he were, then the school could regain its former reputation in no time, and the disciples would not have to be bullied anymore. They would be able to declare to the others proudly that they were from the Immortal Sword Master School, and the school would be listed back as a rank 5 school.</p><p>Ye Chen slightly shook his head, “No, senior Battle King should be dead.”</p><p>Although Ye Chen also hoped that he was not dead, why would a dead person seal away his memory in a sword? Only dead people would do such things, since their bodies had died and their spirit would have to leave something.</p><p>“When did he die?” Li Zhangfeng was almost losing his breath, and his face was pale.</p><p>“Around five hundred years ago perhaps.” He was not too sure as he explained, “I have gotten his sword, and his remaining memory taught me a lot of things, which helped me grow a lot. Therefore, I had said before that I was kind of his disciple.”</p><p>“Do you have proof?”</p><p>“Of course!”</p><p>Ye Chen took out the broken sword and said, “This is indeed senior’s sword. He also said that if you do not believe me, then I should say the name of one item–the Yuan Yang stone.”</p><p>“Yuan Yang Stone!”</p><p>Li Zhangfeng was trembling as he took out a jade stone from his storage ring. A light seemed to be trapped inside the stone, with a pair of matching birds on it. It was indeed the stone itself, an item the Battle King had given to his wife. Moreover, his wife was indeed the first generation female leader of the Li family.</p><p>As for Li Zhangfeng, he was indeed the descendant of Battle King and his wife. This stone had been passed on generations after generations, waiting for the day when they would be able to reunite with Battle King again.</p><p>“I guess you are the descendant of Battle King then.” Ye Chen sighed.</p><p>“Dead…indeed dead! I wish so much that you had not come here today.” Li Zhangfeng was full of pain. Before Ye Chen showed up on their doorstep, they could continue to believe that the ancestor could come back to this land and the school again. And with that hope, they were able and would be able to hang on somehow. But now, the hope was finally gone.</p><p>“Battle King is indeed dead!” The majority of the people seemed like they had just lost something vital.</p><p>Ye Chen was about to say something when he suddenly frowned as he looked at a tall mountain peak behind the buildings.</p><p>“Where is this thief coming from? How dare you humiliate the school!”</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>A shadow appeared at a high speed, throwing out a sword attack at Ye Chen even before the figure even arrived. It was fast like a beam of lightning, containing the ultimate meaning of thunder and wind. Even the space started to twist due to the attack.</p><p>“Eh? A half step king warrior inside the school? I didn’t scan with my soul.”</p><p>“Great Master! No!”</p><p>Li Zhangfeng and the group were shocked again. Although they also knew that Ye Chen was a half step king warrior level, but the Great Master had been in the same realm for at least hundreds of years now.</p><p>After knowing who Ye Chen was, they had started to treat him as one of them, and had not expected to see their Great Master trying to kill Ye Chen.</p><p>“It is okay.” Ye Chen smiled lightly as he reached out two fingers.</p><p>“What is he trying to do?” Everyone frowned. They thought that Ye Chen was underestimating Great Master, but did not stop the Great Master either.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
