Ye Chen spent an entire week just to make a little progress. He could now observe the basic composition of strange Star Fire Poison. However, observation was observation; he still couldn’t dismantle the poison.</p><p>A week later, Ye Chen finally dismantled the poison, accomplishing the second step. Unfortunately, he’d only dismantled the spreading poison, which was merely like the vanguard, and it only reduced the poison’s threat. Expelling it completely was not something that could be done in a day.</p><p>Moreover, while Ye Chen was dismantling poison, the poison was also converting his Zhen Yuan. Ye Chen’s speed was far slower than poison’s Zhen Yuan conversion. After a long time, the poison would become increasingly dominant and convert the insides of his body into itself.</p><p>“I have to reach the third step and reach minor completion. There is no other way.”</p><p>After minor completion, Ye Chen could refine the dismantled poison. It won’t eradicate the poison, but it would at least restrain it from converting his Zhen Yuan, allowing him time to look for other methods to expel it.</p><p>…</p><p>Blood Sky Continent was the second continent of True Spirit World. Although its area was merely about half of True Spirit Continent, its greatest width neared thirty million li while its shortest width was eighteen million li, shaped like a huge coconut. Even comparing it to heart was not too far-fetched. Like True Spirit Continent, Blood Sky Continent was also filled with all kinds of danger zones, forbidden zones, and some completely off-limit zones that even Life and Death Kings could easily lose their lives in. These zones were called king grade Forbidden Zones.</p><p>Bloodlight Ocean was the fourth king grade Forbidden Zone of Blood Sky Continent. Despite its name, Bloodlight Ocean was no ocean. It was situated in the east of Iron Blood Region. Blood colored breezes blew all year around the zone, looking like a blood light and blood ocean. Thus, it was named Bloodlight Ocean.</p><p>Bloodlight Ocean had two major aspects of danger, one being the Blood Demon. Bloodlight Ocean was a breeding ground of Blood Demons, and nobody knew how many of them actually resided there. From low rank blood demons, mid rank blood demons, high rank blood demons, Blood Demon Generals, to Blood Demon Kings, it had everything. Due to Bloodlight Ocean’s peculiar rules and boundless power, Beast Kings and Life and Death Kings had no means to wipe this place off the ground, and could only stop Blood Demons from coming out.</p><p>The second aspect was chaotic will.</p><p>If one stayed in Bloodlight Ocean for long, they would suffer a frenzied assault from a chaotic will. At best, one would become an idiot; at worst, one would become a crazy bloodthirsty monster—a part of the Blood Demons.</p><p>Due to these two huge dangers, although Bloodlight Ocean was not as dangerous as the top three forbidden zones, it was the most famous. People’s faces would instantly change upon a mere mention of it.</p><p>“Old Chang, this is our second time going to Bloodlight Ocean after a hundred years!” At the entrance of Bloodlight Ocean, the space split open and two middle-aged men walked out.</p><p>“Yeah! A hundred years could turn blue seas into fields…Even my descendants have grown old. Monkey, four of us entered the last time, but only the two of us returned. This time, we’ll both make it alive.” The fifty-year old looking man with a long beard spoke emotionally.</p><p>The man called Monkey had a pointed mouth and monkey-cheeks. He was not a human, but a Monkey who had become a Demonic King. He gravely nodded, “Certainly! After making it out, I’ll let you have a bit of my precious two-hundred-years old monkey wine.”</p><p>“You miser! Take out some right now. Whatever, I’ll come out alive for your wine, or I’ll be making a huge loss.”</p><p>If someone knowledgeable was present at the scene, they would immediately recognize the two. They were the loner Kings of Blood Sky Continent, namely Anicca Spear King and Iron Monkey King.</p><p>Although the two belonged to different races—one human and one beast—they had a deep friendship, and could even be said to be sworn brothers of different races. A hundred years ago, they had another brother, who was also a Best King named Black Horned King. Unfortunately, he was killed in Bloodlight Ocean by a Blood Demon King.</p><p>“Let’s go! This time, we’ve to obtain a Blood Crystal Flower no matter what happens.” Anicca Spear King’s body flickered and entered Bloodlight Ocean, with Iron Monkey King following right behind.</p><p>A few days later, there was a heavy downpour at the entrance of Bloodlight Ocean. The sky was covered in mist, radiating a thick pressure.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>A sword swept the sky, speeding across.</p><p>A hundred meters away from the entrance, the sword light scattered, and the figure of a young man appeared. Long dense black hair, clad in a wide blue robe, who else it could be if not Ye Chen?</p><p>After reaching minor completion in Great Poison Conversion Art and temporarily suppressing the Star Fire Poison, Ye Chen stopped cultivating and began to look for means to expel the poison.</p><p>After making several enquiries, Ye Chen found out that Blood Sky Continent had a king grade Forbidden Zone named Bloodlight Ocean, which had a plant-cum-mineral known as the Blood Crystal Flower. Its consumption could strengthen the spirit body, and the effect depended on its maturity—a ten-thousand-year-old Blood Crystal Flower could improve the spirit body by half a step. Of course, this increase was for a fifth step spirit body or lower. To improve a sixth step spirit body, even ten such flowers wouldn’t be enough.</p><p>Although Blood Crystal Flower’s efficacy was far below that of Heavenly Demon Fire Spirit Flower, for the current Ye Chen, who was pressed for time, even if he couldn’t advance his spirit body, any strengthening was equivalent to increasing the poison resistance of his body.</p><p>“Bloodlight Ocean is a dangerous place for Kings. I don’t have to fear the chaotic will too much, but I can’t defend against Blood Demon Kings.”</p><p>Blood Kings were born from blood, and were ever-changing in their forms. In the battle, if they found any gaps, they would turn into blood light and enter one’s body. In that case, even if one’s skill was as high as the heavens, you’d still die unresigned.</p><p>“But, this flower is something I have to get.”</p><p>With a flicker, Ye Chen turned into sword light and entered Bloodlight Ocean.</p><p>…</p><p>Bloodlight Ocean was a different world, with no end in sight. The outside was clearly raining, but there was not even a sign inside. The sky was bright red, and the ground was covered with blood red gales which soared and sank indefinitely, making the ground look like a moving blood ocean glimmering in a blood light.</p><p>“Such powerful rules!”</p><p>As soon as Ye Chen entered Bloodlight Ocean, his body sank by dozens of meters. The surrounding pressure acting on his body was hundred folds higher compared to outside, and the gravity was also a hundred folds higher. As for his soul power, it could only cover a few dozen li.</p><p>“Fortunately, Bloodlight Ocean is different from person to person and doesn’t have fixed rules.”</p><p>The pressure one received in Bloodlight Ocean depended on their cultivation base. For example, Ye Chen was at the peak of third layer of the life-and-death chamber, so the pressure he received was a hundred folds. But, the pressure for Life and Death Kings would likely surpass a thousand folds. In this manner, the difference between the two sides was preserved at its original value.</p><p>Otherwise, a hundred fold pressure was nothing for Life and Death Kings, and they would still be able to move at high speed. Ye Chen could never chase them, while they would be able to easily chase him.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>A blood gale condensed, and a blood light pounced out of it.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Ye Chen pointed at it, and a sword ray dismembered the blood light. The Destruction Sword Intent rendered it incapable of condensing again. Flying right above the ground, he headed into the depths of Bloodlight Ocean.</p><p>A day later, Ye Chen had grasped some details of Bloodlight Ocean. The blood demons would usually hide within the blood gales. Once their target came in their vicinity, moving through the gale, they would turn into a blood light and crazily assault the target. If one’s luck were bad and the gale one moved through had blood demon, the blood light would immediately enter one’s body.</p><p>Ye Chen ran into this scenario once. Fortunately, his opponent was a Blood Demon General, which was the equivalent of humanity’s Sea of Soul realm experts. Moreover, Ye Chen’s Destruction Sword Intent and Immortal Sword Intent were precisely its bane.</p><p>“Worthy of its name, this place is too dangerous.”</p><p>Inside a blood gale, Ye Chen sensed a sound. Blood gales were everywhere in Bloodlight Ocean, which meant everywhere was the possibility of some blood demon’s existence. If he met a blood demon under Blood Demon King level, he could still handle it. But, if he met an actual Blood King, even he would face a life-threatening crisis. After all, he could not have his Sword Domain released all the time.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>A sky-shaking explosion sounded ahead him, causing the ground to tremble.</p><p>“A battle of Kings!” Ye Chen’s eyes squinted. “I better go take a look. It’ll help me be on guard later.”</p><p>Apart from the clear dangers, this place also had hidden dangers which Ye Chen was not too clear about. He had to increase his understanding of this place if he wanted to increase his chances of survival.</p><p>The battle site was quite far off, so Ye Chen followed the energy fluctuations and stopped in the distance, not willing to go too near.</p><p>“Open!” Opening the erect vertical eyes at his forehead, Ye Chen gazed with his Soul Eye. In his line of sight, three battling figures appeared. Mighty shockwaves were radiating out, even sweeping away the blood gales and creating a clear region. Three figures could be clearly seen, with two on one side; one of them fighting stood with a spear and looked like a human, while the other was a transcended Beast King. On the other side was a figure covered in blood gales with deep blood red eyes—clearly a human.</p><p>“It’s really a Hetero Blood Demon King!”</p><p>The longer one stayed in Bloodlight Ocean, the more they would be influenced by the chaotic will. If one couldn’t endure its chaotic assault, they would lose their reason and turn into a frenzied monster that only knew killing. Under the assault of the blood gales, they would slowly turn into a hetero blood demon, who was no less dangerous than a Blood Demon.</p><p>Bloodlight Ocean had existed for countless years and turned many Life and Death Kings into hetero blood demons. More importantly, careful observers believed that the lifespan of these hetero blood demon kings far surpassed a thousand years. As for exactly how much it was, no one was clear about it.</p><p>Thus, even if one didn’t run into a Blood Demon King but a hetero Blood Demon King, one would still die nine out of ten times. Perhaps a Hetero Blood Demon King’s strength might not be comparable to a peak King, since the chances of a peak King losing to the chaotic will were quite small, but there was still a possibility. What about Kings who were exceptionally powerful, but were somewhat weaker in the aspect of will? They would definitely be doomed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
