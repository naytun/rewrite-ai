Moreover, the Iron Blood Region was one of the top regions inside the Blood Sky Land.</p><p>This big of a region would obviously have a lot of powerful groups. Besides the rank 5 martial schools, there were more than a dozen rank 6 martial institutions. The Zhang Tian Martial School was in the west side of the Iron Blood region, with three other rank 6 schools around it—the Extreme Heaven Martial School, Earth Bear Family, and Bald Eagle Valley. These rank 6 schools were all onto Zhang Tian Martial School, so it was not hard to imagine the pressure the latter was facing.</p><p>Ye Chen learned from Li Zhangfeng that all of these three power parties were all extremely powerful.</p><p>There were three half step king warriors inside the Extreme Heaven Martial School. along with millions of disciples, making it the biggest rank 6 martial school on the west side. The Earth Bear Family, a demi beast family, had two beast kings inside the family and millions of family members as well, which were all super powerful physically since they all carried the bear beast king’s bloodline. As for the Bald Eagle Valley, which was a beast martial school, there were mainly flying beasts. They had two half step beast kings—the Grey Eagle King and Flying Eagle King.</p><p>Being able to last this long was already quite impressive for the Zhang Tian Martial School.</p><p>Forcing a chuckle, Li Zhangfeng said, “The people inside these martial school are extremely brutal. Once my Zhang Tian Martial School people decide to leave the mountain and try to find a better opportunity outside, they will hunt them down if they find out about it. So, Zhang Tian School has been stranded here in a way all this time. We are running out of resources slowly but gradually. A lot of the disciples with great talents grow slowly due to the lack of resources. Naturally, there would not be many people who would want to join the school. Recently, there were not even fifty disciples joining every year.”</p><p>Resources were the roots of a martial school. Losing the channel to find it would be ending the hope for a school. It was indeed an evil move!</p><p>“Leader, why didn’t you move the school somewhere else outside the Blood Sky Land?” Ye Chen could not believe that the top three martial schools would chase after them. Once outisde the land, the school would have a better chance of developing into something bigger, since being here would be basically a slow suicide.</p><p>Li Zhangfeng said, “We have already talked about this before, but it would not have worked. Although we would be able to escape the three martial schools, if we ran into any danger as we moved, we would lose the school completely, which would mean the school’s legacy would officially become history. Although we would not be able to develop by being here and would have to endure the schools’ bullying, we can keep our school at the very least. And with that emperor level warrior’s warning, they would not dare to come up here and fight us really.”</p><p>“That is true.” Ye Chen had not thought of that before. There were always unpredictable dangers out there. There were half step king warriors inside Zhang Tian Martial School, which would make it drastically safer, but it would be unbelievably dangerous to move the school nonetheless. If they ran into the fifty robbers gang inside the Blood ocean, or even just one-thirds of their members, it would be an end for the Zhang Tian School.</p><p>“Don’t worry, leader! With me being here, the three martial schools will no longer be a threat. In the future, there will be more and more disciples here.”</p><p>Ye Chen knew it was necessarily for him to give Li Zhangfeng a little bit of hope.</p><p>“Those three martial schools are not a threat?” Li Zhangfeng looked at Ye Chen with a shocked expression, “Could I ask Senior Ye, are you a top half step king warrior?”</p><p>Ye Chen smiled gently. “You will find out about it in the future.”</p><p>Right now, Ye Chen doubted that he would believe him even if he told him the truth. Moreover, he could not reveal all of his secrets right away yet just so that he could make people believe him.</p><p>Although Ye Chen did not specify what kind of half step king warrior he was, all of the masters present were already satisfied by what they had just heard. Being able to beat the Great Master so easily made Ye Chen easily a top half step king warrior. As for being stronger than that, they did not dare to even imagine.</p><p>With one top half step king warrior being in the school, perhaps the other three martial schools would not dare to do much anymore. Ye Chen becoming the Great Master was a big deal. On the second day, Li Zhangfeng had called everyone to the plaza in front of the palace and announced the news.</p><p>“Such a young Great Master?”</p><p>Just as Li Zhangfeng had anticipated, everyone was shocked after hearing the news. But, no one had doubted Ye Chen’s power since yesterday after he used only two fingers to clasp Great Master’s sword and one punch to blow him away.</p><p>“With two Great Masters, our school should welcome a calmer future.”</p><p>“That is for sure! Master Ye’s power must be much greater than Master Lu’s. If he could recover his mind, our school will be even more powerful.”</p><p>A lot of the disciples started discussing.</p><p>Seeing the thousands of disciples, Ye Chen turned his head to Li Zhangfeng: “Master, some of these disciples have really great minds but rather low cultivation. Have you been giving out enough spirit stones?”</p><p>Li Zhangfeng said a bit embarrassedly, “There are still some left in the inventory, but not much anymore. We have only been using for hundreds of years but not restocking. Especially for the top rank spirit stones, we basically ran out of them a while ago. Even I have been using mid rank ones to train.”</p><p>Ye Chen had not expected the school to be in this condition, so he said, “If leader trusts me enough, take out all of the stones and distribute them evenly from now on. As for the three schools’ threat, I will take care of it. I believe the school will find a way out.”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Li Zhangfeng bit his teeth and agreed. In his heart, Ye Chen was really important, and he believed that it was time for the school to change.</p><p>Talked out a top rank storage ring, Ye Chen handed it to Li Zhangfeng. “There are one million top rank spirit stones, so do not reject it. It is nothing to me, but for the school, it is the most important thing right now.”</p><p>Ye Chen would not keep up the school with his own belongings. But, the school needed a bit of a starter kick in the beginning, since it would be impossible for them to find top rank spirit stones. Moreover, it was nothing much for Ye Chen, since his wealth had exceeded one billion again after the Blood Ocean battle.</p><p>“Ah…”</p><p>Li Zhangfeng took over the ring with shaking hands. One million top rank spirit stones was not a small number. All the normal rank 6 schools’ inventory added up together might not even reach this kind of a number. Only the most powerful rank 6 schools would be able to have this kind of stock.</p><p>As a Great Master, a mountain peak of his own was promised to Ye Chen. There were a lot of palace buildings built on top of the peak, and he moved into one of them on the second day.</p><p>During the next couple of days, Ye Chen spent most of the time on mid rank weapons during day time, and focused on training and increasing his own cultivation at night.</p><p>On this particular night, Ye Chen had just finished his training.</p><p>“Half step king warrior’s cultivation is really hard to improve. After a couple of months, I finally have a chance at breaking through to top rank half step king warrior level.”</p><p>Ye Chen seemed happy. The increase of cultivation would be the easiest, and would happen one day or another as long as one had enough potential. However, no matter how easy it was, it would take a certain amount of time nonetheless. And what Ye Chen lacked the most was time. Therefore, he always thought that his growth was too slow.</p><p>Once he reached top rank half step king warrior level, his power would increase drastically again.</p><p>“I still don’t know a lot about the school yet. How about I go check what the disciples are thinking?” Since he had a bit of free time on his hand, Ye Chen suddenly let out his soul power and covered the whole school.</p><p>Ye Chen’s soul power had actually already reached Life and Death Realm, so it could go undetected by everyone.</p><p>At night, there were still a lot of disciples who were still awake. They were all mostly training, or in a closed-up deep thought training. They all seemed to be working hard for their goals.</p><p>Of course, there were also some of the disciples who had spent the whole day training, and were now chatting amongst each other.</p><p>“The new Great Master is indeed so impressive! He is so young and managed to reach half step king warrior level. If I can get to that level, then I can protect the school as well.”</p><p>“Try hard for another decade! Half step king warriors are not that easy to become. We are only at Astral Reaching Realm.”</p><p>“I am just saying!”</p><p>“I know. I just don’t want you to become arrogant or have your head in the air.”</p><p>“Thank you! I know.”</p><p>“Ah, only if master Lu can regain his mind, then we will no longer be weak with two half step king warriors in our school.”</p><p>A curious look flashed across Ye Chen’s face. The Master Lu they were referring to was that Great Master. He wondered what actually happened to him.</p><p>“Yeah indeed! That Earth Bear Family is so evil, especially that Rock Bear King. He bullied us so many times and even hit the Great Master in the head. Now, he cannot recognize anyone but the leader.”</p><p>“Poor master Lu!”</p><p>…</p><p>Retrieving his soul power, Ye Chen secretly frowned. It turned out that the elder had been hit in the head, which caused his condition today. Was that Rock Bear King really that powerful?</p><p>That was one beast amongst the top hundred beasts, at the same rank as the nine headed snake as well as the golden lion. They all had demi beast blood, which made them extremely powerful and capable of cross realm battles. Of course, they would need pure bloodlines, or they would be not that different from normal humans.</p><p>…</p><p>Days went by, and Ye Chen’s mid rank sword building spell was well trained. He could create one top mid rank sword almost every time now. Once he completed his training, he would be able to produce top rank swords, which would be a whole other level.</p><p>Besides that, his cultivation seemed to have been getting better as well.</p><p>Inside his chamber, Ye Chen sat on the stone platform as he held one Zhen yuan crystal in each of his hands, absorbing the Zhen yuan power within.</p><p>Inside the chamber, an invisible pattern continued to spread and brush the chamber walls. It was indeed the pressure from his Zhen yuan.</p><p>Wooh!</p><p>All of a sudden, a wave of powerful Zhen yuan spread out, causing the whole chamber to break down. Small rocks shot out everywhere, the qi flow sharp like swords.</p><p>On the peak of the mountain, a column like sword qi shoot into the sky. A lot of people saw it and could not help but be shocked.</p><p>Whoo!</p><p>Letting out a long breath, Ye Chen opened his eyes and mumbled to himself. “Finally, the top rank half step king warrior level! Although the purity of Zhen yuan has not improved that much, the quantity has indeed doubled. I am now able to use the Evil Shattering Sword ten times.”</p><p>After the top half step king warrior level, he now had to face the Life and Death Challenges. Anyhow, his power had augmented drastically.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
