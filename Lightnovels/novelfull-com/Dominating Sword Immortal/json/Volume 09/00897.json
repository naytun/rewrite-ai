However, if he faced the attacks that way, he would be left crippled, if not dead.</p><p>“Hehe, go die!”</p><p>Gray Bird King was heavily injured. Unleashing this attack caused his wounds to tear apart, making him spurt a huge mouthful of blood. However, if this strike could kill Ye Chen, this much of injury wouldn’t amount to much.</p><p>“I didn’t expect to use the Dragon Bead so soon!” Facing the powerful assault of the two Kings, a golden bead appeared in Ye Chen’s left hand. Raising it high up, a majestic radiance spread out from the bead as if claiming its hegemony. Its glorious radiance made it seem like a little small sun above Ye Chen’s hand.</p><p>Wuuu!</p><p>A high-pitched dragon cry shook the heavens and earth, and a golden dragon’s phantom flew out of the bead, coiling around Ye Chen’s body. Amidst crackling sounds, Beard King’s hammer light and Gray Bird King’s feathers were thoroughly shattered.</p><p>“What is that?”</p><p>Furious, Beard King swung the huge black hammer in his hand across, issuing several hundred spiraling hammer lights within an instant. However, still not satisfied, he himself leaped forth, smashing his hammer on Ye Chen’s head. The strength contained in the hammer was extremely rich, enough to explode a star.</p><p>Clank! Clank! Clank! Clank!</p><p>The golden dragon phantom’s golden light swept the hammer light before it could even approach Ye Chen. As Beard King himself arrived, the Golden Dragon spiraled off his body, soaring up in the sky and piercing through the hammer light with its pair of towering horns, sending the former flying back.</p><p>Huff!</p><p>Two holes opened in Beard King’s abdomen, almost reaching his vertebra. Although the golden dragon phantom was illusory, the power it unleashed was very real. In the next moment, Beard King’s nose and mouth leaked blood covered in a golden light. With his exceptionally pale face, he measured the golden dragon phantom with an inconceivable look, not daring to attack again for the moment.</p><p>“The energy inside Dragon Bead is limited. I still need it to search for the secret realm’s location.”</p><p>Ye Chen didn’t dare to wantonly waste Dragon Bead’s energy. The energy it contained was not ordinary energy, but the energy of a true Giant Dragon. It was much purer than Xu Jing’s pre-transformation dragon power. However, Ye Chen was unable to control the dragon power to execute long-range attacks, or he would not have minded killing these two kings in exchange for some dragon power.</p><p>“Leave!”</p><p>With the golden dragon phantom guarding his body, he suddenly opened the space and escaped into the void.</p><p>“Not good, he is trying to escape!” Gray Bird King’s injuries were too severe. He didn’t dare to approach Ye Chen, and thus, could only exclaim when he saw the former opening the space.</p><p>“Can he outun us in the void?” With a sneer, Beard King also entered the void.</p><p>In the void brimming with spatial power, Gray Bird King and Beard King chased after Ye Chen from each side, not giving him any chance. As long as Ye Chen exhausted the power of golden dragon phantom’s power or the masked man arrived, he would die. However, an astonishing scene played out before their eyes. With the protection of golden dragon phantom, Ye Chen’s speed turned inconceivable. In less than an instant, he covered sixty-seventy thousand li, which was much faster than them.</p><p>“Damn it, where are you going!”</p><p>Getting anxious, Beard King threw the huge black hammer in his hand at Ye Chen, which turned into a light beam and chased after the latter. At this point, he would rather lose a handy weapon then give Ye Chen a chance to escape.</p><p>“Silver Feather Slash!”</p><p>Gray Bird King also didn’t wish to see Ye Chen escape. The scant silver feathers at his neck stood erect and shot forth with a much faster speed than Beard King’s hammer.</p><p>Pa! Pa!</p><p>The golden dragon phantom was condensed from giant dragon power, so how could they get through it? Apart from a slight tremble in Ye Chen’s figure, there was nothing, and his speed actually increased due to the impact. After a few moments, he was out of the two perception’s range.</p><p>“Damn!” Beard King stopped with an ashen face.</p><p>“Not only is this kid powerful, he’s so many treasures as well. Killing him is easier said than done.” Gray Bird King’s figure spun, and he transformed into a human figure. There was a huge bloody hole at his chest, slowly leaking blood. At the surface of the hole, traces of purple crystals could be seen within. They were the reason that his injuries were not healing easily.</p><p>“We couldn’t kill him, but the Pursuing Thunder King could. He is only about ten million li away from here.” The injuries of Beard King were also not light. There were two bloody holes in his abdomen, covered in a layer of golden light. If his Undying Body had not reached the later stages of limb regrowth realm, that one strike would have made him lose ninety percent of battle strength.</p><p>“My injuries are too severe. If delayed any longer, it will affect my future cultivation base. You can chase, and I’ll wait for Pursuing Thunder King here.” Gray Bird King had already given up on dealing the killing blow to Ye Chen. With the other’s strength and treasures, the one dying would be him.</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>Beard King also knew that Gray Bird King’s injuries were too heavy. Letting out a faint breath, his figure flickered and shot through the void. He didn’t believe that Ye Chen could sustain such a high speed for long.</p><p>…</p><p>When the dragon power inside the bead had been reduced to half, Ye Chen finally stopped. At this moment, he was already a billion li away, several hundred million li away from Blood Sky Continent.</p><p>“Escaping is not going to always work. I have to enter Life and Death Realm as soon as possible.”</p><p>Without Ye Chen’s control, the giant dragon power could only defend his body or attack any nearby enemies after being aroused out of the bead. As for the remaining half inside the dragon bead, Ye Chen didn’t dare use it. It was the only way of searching for the Dragon God Celestial Palace’s secret realm as well as the tool to open the realm itself. Every single bit of dragon power remaining had to be used prudently.</p><p>“I’ve already sensed the common point between life dao and death dao. I should continue the verification!”</p><p>Finding a small island filled with lush plants and trees, Ye Chen set out Dream Devouring Wolf and wholeheartedly immersed himself in verifying the life-and-death dao.</p><p>Awoo!</p><p>Meanwhile, the Dream Devouring Wolf growled and crouched on the ground.</p><p>Not being able to help his master against the enemies made him feel extremely unresigned. He was striving to reach the peak of the third layer of life-and-death chamber. Once he succeeded, his dream realm would substantially influence even mid step Kings. And once he became a Beast King, he could fight alongside Ye Chen, no matter who the enemy was.</p><p>“Life and death: no life, no death.” Ye Chen allowed life Qi and death Qi to collide every once in a while.</p><p>Sometimes colliding at slow speeds, and sometimes at high speed, the collision of life Qi and death Qi gradually produced a slight aftermath, creating a gray-colored sphere Qi cover. Inside the spherical Qi cover, life-and-death Qi tangled with each other.</p><p>“Taiji!” Ye Chen’s eyes glittered.</p><p>Comprehending life-and-death only required to find the connecting point of the Life dao and Death dao, and then connect the two. There was no need for a thorough comprehension, nor it was possible to do so. At this moment, Ye Chen had finally grasped the connecting point of life-and-death: life-and-death were tangled with each other, chasing each other in the form of Taiji. It allowed him to see the very fabric of the two.</p><p>“Alright! If I’m lucky, I can become a Life and Death King in three to five days, or it will take about half a month.”</p><p>Previously, the grand entrance of Life and Death Realm seemed quite indistinct to him: seemingly so near yet so far, visible yet untouchable. However, at this moment, this door had finally turned substantial. He could see with extreme clarity. Now, all he needed to do was push it open.</p><p>While Ye Chen was verifying life-and-death, Beard King was still pursuing his traces. And behind him, the masked man was also rushing over. As for those blood-robed guardians, they had long lost value. Going by their speed, they would need forever to catch up. Of course, there was a chance that Ye Chen turned around and ran into their backline. But, the chances of such a thing happening were too slim. If he got caught, he would be completely surrounded.</p><p>“Beard King, Ironarm King, Gray Bird King, and me—four of us are looking for him. We’ll certainly find him again.” The masked man had already found the information about Ye Chen’s golden dragon phantom. He also didn’t believe that the other could use that kind of power indefinitely. He must be hiding somewhere ahead.</p><p>“That golden dragon phantom is certainly some kind of treasure. However, this kind of treasure can’t block me. Once I kill him, it will be mine.” The masked man’s figure incessantly flickered in the void.</p><p>…</p><p>“Master is almost there, roar!”</p><p>The Dream Devouring Wolf’s most recent progress was not small: he actually broke through and reached the second layer in such a short time. Of course, it was all thanks to him watching Ye Chen verify life-and-death, or his breakthrough wouldn’t have been so easy.</p><p>“Once master breaks through, I can openly appear in the outside world!”</p><p>Dream Devouring Wolf was aware of its rarity. If his master were not powerful enough, he would be inevitably snatched by others. He already had enough of changing masters, and only hoped to see his master grow increasingly stronger. Moreover, he could feel that Ye Chen was a world-shaking genius. Following such a master, his future prospects were boundless. Who knew if he would even be remembered by future generations as the companion of an unrivalled, peerless powerhouse.</p><p>Three days passed by, and the life-and-death aura on Ye Chen’s body turned increasingly powerful. It was gradually becoming a single entity, inseparable from each other. The plants around him were withering, then rapidly growing. It was a scene completely similar to the Life and Death Secret Realm, only at a smaller scale.</p><p>“Eh?” One day, Dream Devouring Wolf’s ears twitched before he suddenly stood up. “Enemy!”</p><p>As an expert in dreamland ability, Dream Devouring Wolf’s power was also quite powerful. He could feel the spatial ripples in the sky above. Suddenly, a powerful aura spread out.</p><p>“Haha, let me see how you will escape this time.” Tearing the space, the masked man appeared in the sight of Dream Devouring Wolf.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Dream Devouring roared as the red fur on its body stood up erect. This was the sign of danger. The feeling the masked man gave him was too terrifying. He opened all his eyes and used dreamland, extending it toward the masked man.</p><p>“Overestimating yourself.”</p><p>The masked man completely disregarded the dreamland, shattering it easily. He then reached out and grabbed the Dream Devouring Wolf.</p><p>But right at this moment, the sky darkened, and a huge black hole appeared, piercing through all three layers of the sky. Inside the black hole, boundless energy was compressed together, spinning frantically. It finally took the shape of an energy whirlpool, from which, a black storm poured down.</p><p>“This is…the Life-and-Death Calamity!” The masked man’s face paled with fright,</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
