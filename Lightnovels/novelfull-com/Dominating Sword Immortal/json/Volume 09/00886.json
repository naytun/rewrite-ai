At the center of the palace was a long table with dozens of seats on both sides. A human-shaped powerhouse sat in the main position. More than three meters tall and black-skinned, his black robes’ right chest section had five red-colored badges with an insignia of a blood-red star. Although he was not deliberately leaking any power, one could still faintly feel a frighteningly strong aura from him. This aura didn’t pale one bit compared to the likes of Void Emperor and the rest.</p><p>Apart from him, there was nobody seated by the table. However, there were blood colored stones placed on the table before every seat.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>The blood colored stone placed at the end of the table suddenly emitted a blood colored radiance, which condensed into an indistinct blood figure.</p><p>“Lord!” The blood-colored figure bowed to the black-skinned powerhouse.</p><p>“Have a seat! What happened?” The black-skinned powerhouse faintly nodded and asked the counterpart to sit.</p><p>Sitting down, the blood figure immediately said, “Lord, my consciousness projection ran into that peerless genius Ye Chen in Blood Sky Continent’s king grade Forbidden Zone, Bloodlight Ocean.”</p><p>“Oh!” The black-skinned powerhouse’s eyes brightened, “How did it go?”</p><p>He was quite clear about Ye Chen’s strength. In terms of power scaling of this world, his strength was equal to a low level King. The strength of the blood figure’s original body was that of a high step King. Thus, the strength of his consciousness projection should be that of mid step Kings no matter how one looked at it. Killing Ye Chen should have been a trivial matter to him.</p><p>He was eagerly waiting to hear the good news.</p><p>“I should not have to spend any strength to kill him, but he made a breakthrough at the crucial moment, evolving his Destruction Sword Intent to the sixth step, and gained the strength of a mid step King.”</p><p>“What, sixth step Destruction Sword Intent! So, did you kill him?”</p><p>“He should be dead.”</p><p>“What do you mean should be dead?! Dead means dead…there is nothing in between.” The black-skinned powerhouse spoke with dissatisfaction.</p><p>The blood figure hesitatingly spoke,” Lord should know the might of my four layered thunder fire sky, but it causes my projection to scatter. My four layered thunder fire sky blasted him away, but my projection scattered right afterward. So, I never saw him dying with my own eyes. But, I believe that he is dead without a doubt.”</p><p>The blood figures recounted the details to allow the black-skinned powerhouse to make his own inference. Pondering for a few moments, the latter slowly said, “According to your words, he used the Undying Body once before, and it cost him a lot of Zhen Yuan. Then, he was blasted away by your four layered thunder fire sky and should have sustained injuries several folds heavier than before. Undying Body couldn’t have saved him, so he is more than likely dead.”</p><p>“Lord, we have eliminated another peerless genius!” Hearing the black-skinned powerhouse’s words, elation appeared on the blood figure’s face.</p><p>“But…” The black-skinned powerhouse’s tone changed, “Until you see it with your own eyes, it’s not set in stone. I want absolute certainty that he died. Otherwise, if he survives and enters Life and Death Realm, it’ll be a calamity for us, and killing him would become extremely challenging.”</p><p>“Lord is saying…?” The blood figure looked at the black-skinned powerhouse confusedly.</p><p>“Make another consciousness projection and send it to Blood Sky Continent to make sure. If he is dead, great. But, if he didn’t die, in no case are you to try anything, lest you alert others. We’ll have to make some arrangements and develop a new plan to kill him.”</p><p>The black-skinned powerhouse was anxious to kill Ye Chen, but not to the extent of disregarding everything else. However, he didn’t expect that Ye Chen would evolve his Destruction Sword Intent to the sixth step at the peak of the third layer. It smelled like big trouble. It should be known that will attacks were the most frightening in Life and Death realm. The current Ye Chen already had a sixth step Destruction Sword Intent, so what about later? Seventh step, eighth step? He didn’t dare to imagine that absolute nightmare.</p><p>“Yes!” Without personally seeing Ye Chen’s death, he himself was feeling a bit concerned as well.</p><p>“Alright, make haste, and be a bit careful this time.” The black-skinned powerhouse instructed.</p><p>“Rest assured, I’ll return with good news.” The blood figure scattered away, leaving the black-skinned powerhouse alone in the palace again.</p><p>‘Sixth step Destruction Sword Intent…he is a truly frightening genius, more so than Mysterious Queen. His existence is a nightmare for us. He must be removed, even if a little price is necessary.’ The black-robed powerhouse’s eyes overflowed with killing intent.</p><p>…</p><p>Blackwater Alliance Headquarters…</p><p>“Teacher, the operation failed.” Wang Taiyi was bowing, not daring to look at Yin Sky King.</p><p>“Failed? What about Poison Fire King and Blood Hand King?” Yin Sky King asked with a frown.</p><p>Wang Taiyi sucked in a deep breath and said, “Poison Fire King is back to his star, restoring his cultivation base. As for Blood Hand King? He’s dead!”</p><p>The failure of operation cost Poison Fire King heavy injuries and a big loss of his cultivation base. Upon returning, he felt disinclined to even see Yin Sky King. Thus, he informed Wang Taiyi everything, parted the two skies, and returned to the starry sky to restore his cultivation base. The loss of cultivation base had to be restored as soon as possible. The longer one waited, the harder the restoration would become.</p><p>Receiving the information, Wang Taiyi instantly left Blood Sky Continent and hastened toward Blackwater Alliance’s headquarters. However, he was no Life and Death King, and had to spend a long time.</p><p>“Poison Fire King lost cultivation base and Blood Hand King died!” Yin Sky King didn’t dare believe his own ears, so he roared, “Tell me the details.”</p><p>“Yes!” Wang Taiyi recounted the details Poison Fire King gave him.</p><p>“Proficient in offensive soul secret arts? Capable of sending a low level King into stupor? Most powerful sword art containing a Death Dao more potent than low level Kings? No wonder Blood Hand died at his hands and Poison Fire King suffered grave injuries. However, the most surprising part is his Undying Body. His Zhen Yuan ought to be several folds more than the others at the peak of third layer.”</p><p>As one of tycoons of Blackwater Alliance, Yin Sky King could immediately infer why Ye Chen was able to kill Blood Hand KIng and injure Poison Fire King.</p><p>“Among all of these abilities, his offensive soul secret art is the most frightening. Without it, he would have been completely overpowered. Therefore, all we need to do is find a King unafraid of soul attacks to kill him.”</p><p>“It should be a high-step offensive soul art that hasn’t been cultivated to greater completion. Either a mid step King or a low step King proficient in soul defense should do.” Yin Sky King calculated meticulously in his head.</p><p>“Alright, you can leave. This matter is no longer concerned with you. Your most important task is to comprehend Death Dao and Life Dao and become a Life and Death King.”</p><p>Wang Taiyi was among the top geniuses of True Spirit World. Once he became a Life and Death King, he would be a boon to Blackwater Alliance. In the future, True Spirit World would only get muddier, and a peak level King would be essential for survival. The signs of wind and rain were already appearing in the entire True Spirit World.</p><p>“Yes, teacher!” Wang Taiyi took his leave.</p><p>“Ye Chen, according to reason, I should not kill a peerless genius of True Spirit World. But, you can only blame yourself. You have two million Zhen Yuan crystals of my Blackwater Alliance, and you also have a supreme grade sword. If I can get that sword and exchange it for a supreme grade weapon for myself, I’ll move to the forefront amongst high step Kings. Then, I’ll be able to visit more dangerous forbidden zones and obtain even more treasures. This is my chance, so don’t blame me.”</p><p>Yin Sky King was an ambitious character; in fact, most of the Kings were ambitious. Nobody wished to live an ordinary life. He too wished to become a figure capable of calling wind and rain in True Spirit World and sit on the same seats as Mysterious Queen or even Void Emperor.</p><p>…</p><p>Amidst the boundless darkness of the starry sky, stars were the only luminous objects. On a rapidly flying meteorite, two figures sat across each other. Between them was a table, carrying a wine jar and cups.</p><p>“Copper Sword King, this supreme grade bone wine you’ve refined is really fine. A pity, I can only drink one cup every time.” The speaker was an immensely big ox-headed man. The horn on his head seemed to be piercing the space. Sitting across him was a sword artist. The faint sword Qi emitting out of his body was constantly turning all the approaching meteorites into nothingness. He was known by the name Copper Sword King—the number one Life and Death Sword King of Sky Sword Continent. He even had some fame in True Spirit Continent. He smilingly said, “Demon Ox King, the ingredients required to make this wine are not easy to find. You can rejoice that I offer you a whole cup.”</p><p>Copper Sword King and Demon Ox King didn’t have deep friendship; they had cooperated a few times and succeeded without a hitch. Thus, they became a bit closer. They met once in a while during their free time.</p><p>Demon Ox King grinned, “That’s fine, but this time, you’ll offer me another one.”</p><p>“Oh, why is that?” Copper Sword King knew that Demon Ox King wouldn’t ask for another for no reason.</p><p>“Give me one more first, or leave it.” Demon Ox King said.</p><p>“Fine, here you go.” Copper Sword King poured another cup for Demon Ox King.</p><p>Raising the cup, Demon Ox King gulped it one breath, then beamed with a smile, “I’ll give you some good information. Didn’t you always want a supreme grade sword? I know one…”</p><p>Copper Sword King’s eyes brightened, “Where?”</p><p>“In Blood Sky Continent. Its owner is merely a little guy at the peak of life-and-death chamber’s third layer. Although, he is pretty strong…He defeated Giant Wolf King.”</p><p>“A little kid has supreme grade sword?” Copper Iron King sneered, “What a waste!”</p><p>“Moved?” Demon Ox King smiled.</p><p>“Of course, I’m moved! But, isn’t it strange? You can have that sword for yourself and exchange it for other treasures? Why are you letting me have it?”</p><p>Demon Ox King sucked in a deep breath, “My eldest brother doesn’t let me.”</p><p>“Iron Hoof Beast King!” Copper Sword King naturally knew who Demon Ox King’s eldest brother was. Iron Hoof Beast Sect had two great Beast Kings—Demon Ox King and Iron Hoof Beast King. The latter was peak figure amongst high step Beast Kings. Demon Ox King was no match for him.</p><p>“Alright, if I can get that sword, I won’t let you suffer a loss. I’ll compensate you with a top-notch pseudo supreme grade treasure.” Copper Sword King vowed, then poured another cup for Demon Ox King.</p><p>While drinking his wine, Ox Demon King thought, ‘Eldest brother fears Dragon King, and so do I. But, that doesn’t mean I can’t get some benefits in secret. And even if he finds out, it wouldn’t matter too much, since I never acted myself.’</p><p>Apart from titled monarchs, everybody feared Dragon King at the moment. He was at the death’s door, and as a dying man, he would have no trouble taking a few people to grave with him. Even titled monarchs were not too willing to provoke him in fact. However, Copper Sword King was different. Only a few people in Blood Sky Continent knew of Dragon King, and he was not one of them. As long as Copper Sword King didn’t kill Ye Chen and only snatched the supreme grade sword from him, Dragon King wouldn’t have much to say about it.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
