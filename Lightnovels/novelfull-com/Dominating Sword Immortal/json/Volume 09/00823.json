Although this era’s martial geniuses seemed to be at their peak, the older generation martial geniuses were not that much weaker either. The top warriors would be at a similar level as the current ones, as they had all entered half step king warrior level before reaching forty years old. They even managed to get in on the list of Life and Death Realm warriors. Right now, after almost a decade, they were all reaching their fifties, so their cultivation must be comparable to their real power.</p><p>It also explained why there were no martial geniuses in their forties or fifties besides them on the master warrior rankings, and that they had become the ‘older generation’ directly. It was because most of them had become half step king warriors, so they naturally would not come out to compete among master level warriors.</p><p>As for the top half step King warriors, Ye Chen knew more than the three of them on the True Spirit continent. However, Thunder Spirit King personally knew five of them, and adding some of the hidden ones or the ones that were always traveling, there must be dozens of them. The True Spirit continent turned out to be way more complicated than Ye Chen had imagined it to be; otherwise, it would not have been the center of the True Spirit continent world.</p><p>In addition, Ye Chen had also learned from the Thunder Spirit King that a lot of them had become half step king warriors among this era’s martial geniuses. Bai Wuxue was the first one, and the others followed right behind, such as Lu Shapyou, Xia Houzun, Xiao Chuhe, and the Princess of Godly Shark. As for Du Gujue and the others, by the time the Thunder Spirit King had left, they had not made any progress yet, but they should be close by now.</p><p>So, all of the martial geniuses from the True Spirit continent were making progress. Judging on the training talent, Ye Chen did not really have that big of advantage, since they were all rather the same.</p><p>“Thunder Spirit King, are you at your third level of Life and Death Challenge?” Ye Chen asked.</p><p>Thunder Spirit King said with laughter, “Busted! Indeed, I have reached the third level Life and Death Challenge. I am trying to reach the Life and Death Realm by the age of seventy.”</p><p>Back then, the Thunder Spirit King was also regarded as an amazing martial genius. Of course, he could not compare to the Mysterious Queen, who had become a Life and Death Realm warrior at the age of thirty-five, but it did not mean that people who were slightly weaker than her could make it at thirty-six or thirty-seven. The realm was the highest realm on the True Spirit continent, and it wasn’t some kind of bar that everyone could cross. The warriors would have to use their talent as well as a little bit of luck. Perhaps, one might be the top martial geniuses before Life and Death Realm, but upon reaching there, one might be at the last. Anything could happen at that stage.</p><p>“Mr. Ye, you guys came from the True Spirit Continent?” While the two was chatting, Lan Shanmei interrupted suddenly.</p><p>Ye Chen nodded. “Indeed!”</p><p>Thunder Spirit King and him did not use Zhen yuan to talk, so Lan Shanmei could hear their conversation as well.</p><p>“I have always wanted to go to the True Spirit continent. I heard that it is the center of the True Spirit world, and even the Blood Sky Land has been separated from that land.”</p><p>Lan Shanmei seemed to know a lot.</p><p>Thunder Spirit King chuckled. “They all say that the Blood Sky Land is full of beasts and demons. You train the demon arts, and I assume you are one of the top martial geniuses from the Blood Sky Land, aren’t you?”</p><p>“I would not dare to claim that name. Your power is the more impressive one.”</p><p>Lan Shanmei was very concerned about Thunder Spirit King’s power as he was just like her, a blade artist. But, his cultivation was twice as strong as hers. She did not think that she could beat him; although she was a martial genius, he was not a normal warrior either. He could no longer be called a teenager by appearance and was more in his mid-life. But according to his life scent, he was only in his fifties. Being able to reach the third level of Life and Death Challenge at this early of age indeed made him a powerful and talented martial genius.</p><p>Lan Shanmei was too sensitive to life scent. The reason that the Thunder Spirit King looked like a middle aged man was because he used a kind of secret art that pushed forward his life by ten years. So, he was ten years older than people in his generation. With Sea of Souls Realm warriors’ three hundred years lifespan, he was only a teenager with his current age.</p><p>In the deepest parts in the ocean under the Cold Iron City, a group of hundreds of people stood in midair after coming out from under the water. The chubby elder wiped his storage ring and a massive puppet boat appeared in front of them, catching some of them off guard.</p><p>“Everyone, hop on board!”</p><p>It was a sixty meters long and dozen meters wide boat that was covered in a light yellow layer of qi. At the head board, the body, and the tail position, were dozens of puppet bombs.</p><p>“Not bad! It is a top rank puppet boat!” Ye Chen chuckled.</p><p>Although top rank puppet boats could not threaten half step king warriors, it would be rather deadly for Sea of Souls Realm warriors, so it could save a lot of manpower. Most importantly, being on a boat would be way much easier than traveling in the water by themselves, since the way to the Blood Sky Land would not be a short journey.</p><p>After everyone got on board, the boat started moving forward. It was traveling fast, even faster than Ye Chen’s flying puppet. It could fly dozens of miles all of a sudden. Yet, people could not feel the wind at all on top of it, and could even stand at the head of the boat and enjoy the scenery.</p><p>The elder walked to the front of the boat and said to Thunder Spirit King and Lan Shanmei, “I really appreciate you two joining the team and protecting our trade team.”</p><p>Thunder Spirit King said, “As you said, we are only hired by you, so no need to say thanks.”</p><p>“Regardless, with you being here, this journey would be way safer. Once we get to our destination, I will apply for VIP tags in the Full Moon Trade. When you purchase things from us in the future, everything will be 10% off, and you can have the priority on the waiting list.”</p><p>The elder was very smart; he knew that top half step king warriors would be really rare wherever they went. If he could make a good impression with these tags and make them like their trading group, it would only be good for them. Moreover, he knew that his actions would be backed by his management.</p><p>…</p><p>The pupplet boat traveled for three days straight and arrived at the Blood Ocean.</p><p>“We are here…Everyone, on your guard!” The chubby elder walked out of the boat and reminded everyone.</p><p>“No worries! We have two top half step king warriors with us here. Unless the fifty robbers gang all come out altogether, we will kick their butts back to where they come from.”</p><p>Everyone was relaxed here. Since there were top warriors with them, they thought there was nothing to worry about.</p><p>The elder laughed as he shook his head. He knew that everyone was not wrong, but he still thought it would never hurt to be careful.</p><p>The first day was a peaceful day, and so was the second day. But on the third day, something seemed to be different. After a while, a huge wave of soul power that seemed rather reckless emerged.</p><p>“It seems like we have been targeted.”</p><p>Ye Chen followed the source of the soul power and saw a lot of people who wore bloody clothes and were full of killing intent. It seemed that they should be the Blood Ocean’s fifty robbers gang.</p><p>“Since I am already here, then let my demon blade feed on some blood then.” Lan Shanmei said casually.</p><p>At lunch time on the next day, the puppet boat was surrounded by four to five hundred people. Looking at the leading fifty people, some of the warriors standing in front of the boat said with shock, “it is the fifty robbers gang! Oh my god, they are all here!”</p><p>“We are so unlucky, running into all of them already!” Some people were looking pale.</p><p>Ye Chen looked at them and realized that thirty out of the fifty robbers were at peak level Late Seas of Souls Realm. Twenty of them were half step king warriors, while three out of them were top half step king warriors.</p><p>“It has been long since I had a good epic battle.” There was a light shining in the eyes of Thunder Spirit King, and he could feel his battling intent boiling in his veins.</p><p>Amongst the three people as the leaders of the fifty rob gang, one middle-aged man with scars on his face licked his lips, “The Full Moon Trade Team is the biggest prey, so how could we let this go? This time, we should at least get 300 million top rank spirit stones, right?”</p><p>“300 million? You are underestimating the Full Moon Trade Team. I bet 500 million!” An older lady who did not look like a normal human said with laughter.</p><p>“Alright, do not underestimate. There are two top half step king warriors on their boat. Once we get up there, you guys have to slow them down. Do not give them chance to hurt our people.”</p><p>The taller middle-aged man standing in the middle had fish fins on his head. His eyes were like fish eyes as well, looking rather creepy.</p><p>“Without top half step king warriors, I doubt they could dare to come back here.” The lady had a scary expression on her face.</p><p>The taller middle-aged man took a step forward and said with a loud voice, “Are you the member of the Full Moon Trade Team on the boat? Hand over your goods and 100 million top rank soul stones, then we will let you pass. Otherwise…all of you will be killed!”</p><p>The chubby elder came to the front of the boat and replied, “You are the Tyrant Fish, the leader of the fifty robbers gang. We the Full Moon Trade Team have no beef with your gang, so please do not block our path lest we have unnecessary misunderstanding.”</p><p>“Misunderstanding?” The middle-aged man laughed, showing his mouth full of very sharp teeth, and continued, “In our Fifty Robbers Gang’s eyes, there is never a misunderstanding, only ones that obey and the ones who don’t. Of course, the latter will be killed off. Now, I will ask you again, will you obey?”</p><p>Hearing him, the chubby elder started to look anxious. Over at the Fifty Robbers Gang’s side were three top half step king warriors and twenty half step king warriors. Meanwhile, there were only two top half step king warriors and fourteen half step king warriors on their side, which made it an unfair match. Besides that, although the rest of the Fifty Robbers Gang were only at peak level Late Sea of Souls Realm or rank 10 tyrant level beasts, being able to be listed in the gang meant that they were not ordinary either. They might even be able to kill half step king warriors.</p><p>What made him the most worried was that there were more warriors on the enemy side, and all they had over his side were only hired powerful warriors who might escape at the last minute.</p><p>It was not an unreasonable concern. Some of the people on the boat had started to have doubts in their minds. They were obviously frightened at the sight of the full Fifty Robbers Gang.</p><p>Lan Shanmei saw what was happening and said with a cold voice, “Blood Ocean’s Fifty Robbers Gang never lets anyone that they lay eyes on live. Have you heard of anyone who survived them?”</p><p>Hearing her, everyone was immediately woken back to reality. They knew that since they had met the Fifty Robbers Gang, they could not run away at the last minute. If they did not unite together, they would only be killed.</p><p>“What’s to worry? Let’s fight them with all we got! We might not lose in the end.”</p><p>“Everyone, let’s go!”</p><p>Everyone yelled together.</p><p>The taller middle-aged man had a cold light flashed through his eyes, “They are looking for death. Kill! Kill them all!”</p><p>He waved his hand and the robbers following them all started to run, throwing powerful attacks across the sky at the puppet boat.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Lan Shanmei, Thunder Spirit King, Ye Chen left the boat immediately while the others jumped in with them, throwing back attacks.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
