His meridians, blood, and flesh contained Zhen Yuan. Except for his bones, Ye Chen’s entire body was like a sponge, and Zhen Yuan was like water.</p><p>As for his Dantian, it was still irreplaceable—the source of the body’s power and one of the body’s cores.</p><p>“It should be time to aim for the first layer of Undying Body, limb regrowth!”</p><p>Although his Zhen Yuan had integrated with his flesh, if he wished to aim for the limb regrowth realm, he must integrate his Zhen Yuan with the bones as well. After all, the human body had numerous bones. If one lost some flesh, it might regrow, but what about bones?</p><p>One couldn’t even always regrow lost flesh, much less to speak of bones. So, unless one were a caterpillar, it wouldn’t work.</p><p>The process of integrating Zhen Yuan with bones would not be too difficult for Ye Chen, as he’d already touched the boundary of the limb regrowth realm before and only lacked the foundation.</p><p>Time quickly passed, and Ye Chen succeeded in merely seven days. Henceforth, he would have the ability of limb regrowth at the cost of only Zhen Yuan, without a need for vitality replenishing pills.</p><p>“Entering Life and Death Realm from late half-step King realm would only allow the initial phase of limb regrowth realm, but if one entered after the peak of the third layer of life-and-death-chamber, one could reach the peak of peak of limb regrowth realm, only a step away from Flesh Derivation. I have already entered the initial phase…Once I reach Life and Death Realm, my Undying Body will directly enter the initial Blood Derivation Realm, and even mid and late phases are quite possible.”</p><p>The realm from which one entered Life and Death realm mattered a lot. Entering from the late half-step King realm would only make one an ordinary King. On the other hand, entering from the third layer of life-and-death chamber represented an immense potential, allowing one to advance at a lightning fast speed.</p><p>Cultivators who possessed Undying Body in the limb regrowth realm before Life and Death Realm like Ye Chen were extremely rare. Ye Chen only knew Young Undying Demon Lord who could accomplish this.</p><p>Suddenly, Ye Chen bitterly smiled. Before attaining limb regrowth realm, his body had an abundance of Zhen Yuan. But at this moment, there was barely any Zhen Yuan left. Of course, his Zhen Yuan didn’t disappear, but was absorbed by his cells.</p><p>Although the saying was ‘Zhen Yuan one with the body with no distinctions’, the body was still in the lead.</p><p>Once a battle became desperate, one could still squeeze Zhen Yuan from the cells. This was because the current integration was still in its initial phase. There was still limb regrowth realm’s mid phase, late phase, peak, flesh derivation initial phase, mid phase… and so on up to the stage of Blood Drop Rebirth.</p><p>“It’s no wonder Young Undying Demon Lord had several folds more Zhen Yuan compared to human experts of the same level. After attaining the limb regrowth realm, he could contain even more Zhen Yuan, and his cultivation base could increase even faster.”</p><p>In Sea of Soul realm, only the Dantian could hold Zhen Yuan while meridians were merely for circulation. In half-step King realm, blood could hold Zhen Yuan; in life-and-death chamber realm, the flesh could hold Zhen Yuan. At this moment, Ye Chen’s entire body could hold Zhen Yuan, and thus, his previous Zhen Yuan was insufficient.</p><p>“Fortunately, I have no lack of Zhen Yuan crystals.” He smiled and began refining Zhen Yuan crystals while sitting inside the cave.</p><p>A hundred crystals!</p><p>A thousand crystals!</p><p>Ten thousand crystals!</p><p>Fifty thousand crystals!</p><p>After spending fifty thousand crystals, Ye Chen finally felt that his body could no longer hold more Zhen Yuan. The current him had thrice the amount of Zhen Yuan as before, not one bit inferior to the Young Undying Demon Lord. Right now, he could use the Sky Scorpio Sword fifteen to twenty times, while the Evil Shattering Sword could be used at will.</p><p>“What a frightening power!”</p><p>The feeling of one’s whole body brimming with power was not something everybody could experience. The current Ye Chen felt that even his fingernails could rip through steel and tear apart treasures. Of course, he was perfectly clear that his battle strength had not increased at all, since the purity of his Zhen Yuan had not increased.</p><p>A day later, the sword he was forging was finally finished. This sword was golden in color, as if forged from pure gold. It was a top-notch upper grade sword, and Ye Chen’s first time forging one.</p><p>Although it was an upper grade sword, it could rival a peak semi supreme grade sword in terms of strength, which was the same as an ordinary pseudo supreme grade sword. This was because the immortal sword intent inside the sword was extremely frightening—at the peak third step. If Ye Chen used this sword, it would have no effect, but if some other sword artist used it, he would have an extra third step immortal sword intent, which could easily allow him to prevail over stronger opponents.</p><p>“Only a peak upper grade…still can’t be called immortal. I’ll call you Hundred Eras!”</p><p>Hundred Eras implied ten thousand years.</p><p>Due to the immortal sword intent, this sword could survive for at least ten thousand years without any damage. For clans under fifth grade, it could easily become a family heirloom.</p><p>Kacha!</p><p>Ye Chen easily snapped off another upper grade sword with his Hundred Eras.</p><p>…</p><p>With his cultivation reaching full circle, as well as his immortal sword intent reaching the fifth step and resonating with destruction sword intent, Ye Chen’s strength had greatly increased. Following that, he could relax on forging upper grade swords and begin the comprehension of Death dao.</p><p>With a soul power five times that of other people and a cultivation base of peak third layer, once he focused his mind onto something, his progress was bound to be huge. In a couple dozen days, he managed to feel a trace of Death dao’s existence.</p><p>“Too fuzzy! No wonder only his strongest attack contained a trace of Death dao.”</p><p>Marquis Sword Star’s Meteor Fall and Dugu Jue’s Despair Blade were both their strongest moves. Their ordinary moves didn’t contain Death dao, because of their shallow comprehension. Of course, one didn’t have to fully comprehend Life dao and Death to reach Life and Death Realm. That would be almost impossible to accomplish. As long as one comprehended a part of it, and the comprehension of both complemented each other, one could enter the Life and Death Realm.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>Holding the Evil Shattering Sword, Ye Chen thrust out with the sword energy completely restrained in. It was the second style of Autumn Water Sword Arts’ second style—Congealing Water.</p><p>Bewitching Mirror Shattering was powerful due to the power of space profound, but Death dao required pure destructive power. Therefore, Congealing Water was the most suitable move to match with it.</p><p>“Not right!” Ye Chen shook his head and retracted his sword hand, lost in thought.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>Another thrust.</p><p>“Still not right!”</p><p>…</p><p>In the headquarters of Black Water Alliance, a huge palace stood at a massive island’s center.</p><p>“Ye Chen of Blood Sky Continent and Ye Chen of True Spirit Continent are actually the same?” Sitting on the throne, the black-robed man tapped the black-gold armrest.</p><p>“Teacher, he hasn’t become a King yet. We still have a chance. Once he enters Life and Death realm, it will all be in vain.” Wang Taiyi spoke from down below.</p><p>Wang Taiyi was not a person from True Spirit Continent. It took him nearly a month to rush back to Black Water Alliance.</p><p>“I know, but I’m apprehensive of the Dragon King and Mysterious Queen.” The black-robed man raised his head.</p><p>“Dragon King and Mysterious Queen are so far away. Moreover, they might not even dare to go against our Blackwater Alliance!” Wang Taiyi didn’t put Dragon King and Mysterious Queen in his eyes. Blackwater Alliance was a huge alliance and had numerous Kings, many amongst whom were quite powerful.</p><p>“It’s best not to offend them if we can.”</p><p>The black-robed man was one of the tycoons of the alliance, and he was quite clear about Dragon King and Mysterious Queen’s terror. If they truly fought, Blackwater Alliance might not have the upper hand.</p><p>“But, he will have to die after snatching more than two million Zhen Yuan crystals, and he’s to be killed before reaching Life and Death Realm.”</p><p>Two million Zhen Yuan crystals was a huge amount to Blackwater Alliance. First, the alliance itself had a huge number of Kings, then there were other Kings who also had a share in the pie. Two million Zhen Yuan crystals was a huge loss for the alliance, which they could only cover with their own pockets.</p><p>The reason they couldn’t let Ye Chen enter Life and Death Realm was because if he did, he himself would use a large number of Zhen Yuan crystals. Who knew how much he would be left with?</p><p>“I’ll send two Kings to go with you. Go to Blood Sky Continent, and remember to not expose your identity. Finish him off swiftly and neatly.” The black-robed man stopped tapping the armrest and sternly said.</p><p>“Yes!” Wang Taiyi gravely nodded.</p><p>“Good! You can leave, I’ll find free Kings.”</p><p>Life and Death Kings were rarely free. They could be in seclusion, treasure hunting throughout the True Spirit World, or in the starry sky.</p><p>…</p><p>Swish! Swish!</p><p>These days, Ye Chen was using Congealing Water hundreds of thousands of times a day, trying to incorporate the Death dao inn it. If his cultivation base had not increased three times, he could have never sustained such a Zhen Yuan consumption.</p><p>After thrusting dozens of times in the sky in one breath, Ye Chen suddenly tilted his body.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>With sword energy restrained, he pierced the huge tree across him.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The huge tree rapidly withered, and its bark blackened, looking completely dead.</p><p>“Success at last!”</p><p>That pierce contained the Death dao, which extinguished the tree’s vitality. If it had been an enemy, it would have naturally extinguished their vitality. It looked extremely tyrranical. However, compared to Marquis Sword Star’s Meteor Fall, the death Dao seemed a bit weak. After all, how could one compare a tree’s vitality to that of an expert?</p><p>However, Ye Chen was already satisfied. He’d already gained a feel for the path, so how could he be afraid of not being able to advance?</p><p>At this moment, he was confident that he could injure Giant Wolf King without relying on the Sky Scorpio Sword.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
