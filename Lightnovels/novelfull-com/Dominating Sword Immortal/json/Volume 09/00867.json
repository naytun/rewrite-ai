A sword artist without a sword domain would be courting death fighting against them.”</p><p>Everybody sucked in a deep breath. As far as they were concerned, they might not get to witness such a level of swordplay again throughout their lifetimes. After all, the number of sword artists on True Spirit World with Sword Domain were low enough to count on two hands.</p><p>Everybody was extremely mindful of this battle, and Marquis Sword Star and Lu Shaoyou were even more so. Even if they might not be able to understand much about Sword Domain by looking, something was still better than nothing.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>The moment they released the sword domains, the two immediately retreated.</p><p>‘With the Sword Domain, aces no longer have any meaning. They will just be a waste of Zhen Yuan.’ Marquis Sword Snow frowned, thinking how to defeat Ye Chen.</p><p>‘Sword Domains can counteract each other, but only by a bit more than half. The remaining is enough to deflect the sword’s trajectory.’ At that moment, Ye Chen had felt a little suppression from the Sword Domain. Of course, Marquis Sword Snow must have been the same as him.</p><p>‘Seems like I can only test and probe the limits of the Sword Domain.’</p><p>Ye Chen had never fought with another sword artist who possessed a Sword Domain, and thus he had never been able to understand the minute details. However, this battle was the opportunity for him to thoroughly understand his own Sword Domain.</p><p>The two stood opposite to each other for a few moments, then suddenly charged forth at the same time and swung their swords!</p><p>Swish Swish!</p><p>At that moment, a rather amusing, but not a bit funny, scene occurred. The two seemed like children holding swords for the first time. No matter how they swung their swords or how fast they swung them, they couldn’t reach their opponent. Meanwhile, a powerful sword Qi was diffusing out of the two invading Sword Domains.</p><p>“Spiritual Sword!”</p><p>The Evil Shattering Sword danced around, shooting hundreds of little sword stars at Marquis Sword Snow.</p><p>“Snow Dance Covers Sky!”</p><p>Marquis Sword Snow, also on the same page, issued his most range-extensive move. Sky-covering snowflakes fluttered, swirling toward Ye Chen.</p><p>Rip!</p><p>A strand of Ye Chen’s hair was cut off by the ice-cold sword Qi, giving off a biting chill. On the other hand, a dim blood scar appeared on Marquis Sword Snow’s cheek, dripping blood.</p><p>“So that’s how it is!” Ye Chen’s eyes brightened.</p><p>Sword Domain had limits, just like everything ekse. Otherwise, wouldn’t it imply that even Sword Kings without Sword Domain would be helpless before a Sword Domain? As long as one issued too many attacks within a short duration, the Sword Domain could no longer cope with it, and would reveal gaps. It was the same as catching fishes; if fishes were too many, one or two would inevitably escape the net.</p><p>Of course, this was also because the two’s Sword Domain were not sufficiently strong and had merely given birth to a trace of Sword Rule. If the Sword Rule was much stronger, who knew what would have happened! In addition to that, it was also because the two’s Sword Domains were counteracting each other. If it had been a sword artist without Sword Domain, such tactics would not have worked.</p><p>This was a confrontation between Sword Domains!</p><p>“Spiritual Sword, phase two!”</p><p>With the Evil Shattering Sword in his right hand and Blood Erosion Sword in the left, Ye Chen divided his mind into two and issued the Spiritual Sword attack. With that, twice the number of little stars shot out, swarming toward Marquis Sword Snow.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Marquis Sword Snow didn’t return the strike and instead focused all his might on defending. Snowflakes condensed around his body, creating an air-tight snow barrier.</p><p>Pop Pop Pop!</p><p>The snowflakes created by the compressed sword Qi exploded as the little stars arrived. For the time being, Ye Chen was helpless against the defending Marquis Sword Snow as well, and the two were stuck in a deadlock.</p><p>“Marquis Sword Snow is being suppressed!”</p><p>“But, Ye Chen is also unable to breach his defenses! Is it a draw?”</p><p>Everybody commented and discussed with soul transmissions.</p><p>Ha!</p><p>At that moment, the snow barrier exploded, scattering the final bits of Ye Chen’s assault. Marquis Sword Snow’s entire being soared up, and his Sword Domain expanded, covering the entire chamber. In the next moment, thousands of dense white longswords appeared in the air.</p><p>Sword Domain assault!</p><p>As long as one was inside the scope of Sword Domain, he could not escape the assault.</p><p>“Very well! Let’s see whose Sword Domain is stronger!”</p><p>Ye Chen soared as well while thousands of cyan-colored longswords appeared before him, their tips gleaming with a cold light.</p><p>“Sword Domain Confrontation!”</p><p>Everybody’s eyes were left wide-open.</p><p>Subtle air-piercing that could puncture eardrums rang out as thousands of dense white longswords and cyan longswords shot out at the same time like two meteor showers colliding.</p><p>Pang Pang!</p><p>At every moment, thousands of white longswords and cyan longswords were destroying each other, before reforming immediately. The intensity of the battle had already reached beyond the people’s imaginations.</p><p>“Part!”</p><p>Ye Chen’s eyes squinted while more than a hundred cyan-colored longswords separated out and assaulted Marquis Sword Snow in an arc.</p><p>“Block for me!” On the other side, Marquis Sword Snow also controlled more than a hundred swords to block.</p><p>“Part again!” Ye Chen immediately separated out five groups of longswords, attacking Marquis Sword Snow from different angles.</p><p>“What a frightening soul power!”</p><p>Everybody gasped. To control five groups of longswords at the same time must require an enormous soul power. Considering this feat, Ye Chen’s ability to divide his focus into two was nothing strange.</p><p>“Block Again!”</p><p>Marquis Sword Snow’s face turned grave and stern as his white longswords also separated into five groups and faced Ye Chen’s longswords.</p><p>“This Marquis Sword Snow’s soul power is not weak either. I guess it’s about two-three folds that of an ordinary person.”</p><p>Usually, a person with comprehension had a soul power that far exceeded an ordinary person. For example, Ye Chen’s soul power was five folds that of an ordinary person’s, and thus, he had an exceptionally high comprehension. Although his time of fourteen years before crossing over was wasted, his comprehension was at the very peak among the young elites under the heavens.</p><p>“Let me see how you will block now.”</p><p>Ye Chen took in a deep breath and separated the cyan longswords into ten groups, attacking Marquis Sword Snow from ten different angles. The neatly and elegantly arranged swords displayed the degree of control Ye Chen had over these swords.</p><p>“His soul power is that higher than mine?” Marquis Sword Snow frowned before his soul power erupted all around.</p><p>Soul Amplification Secret Art!</p><p>In the aspect of soul, there were offensive secret arts, defensive arts, as well as amplification arts. Comparatively speaking, amplification arts were much rarer, and several times costlier than offensive and defensive arts. This was because once someone used the amplification, he could still use offensive and defensive arts. One could imagine how frightening it would be!</p><p>Once his soul power was amplified, Marquis Sword Snow easily separated the white longswords into ten groups and faced Ye Chen’s assault.</p><p>“Freaks…two ultimate freaks!”</p><p>A lot of people couldn’t help but take in a breath of cold air, cursing in their hearts. In their vision, the ten groups of swords from each side seemed to be fighting on their own. This meant that the two were controlling all the ten groups at all times. How frightening was their control over the swords?”</p><p>“Eh, a Soul Amplification Secret Art!” Ye Chen could see Marquis Sword Snow’s soul power had suddenly increased, reaching equivalent to his. ‘Unfortunately, the amplified soul power is, in the end, beyond your limits. I’ve long been familiar with such an amount of soul power, so it’s of no burden to me.’</p><p>With but a thought, the ten groups of swords under Ye Chen’s control gradually turned more refined in their attacks, some piercing, some chopping, some slashing. and so on. Although each sword only performed one style, it was exceptionally swift. On the other hand, the longswords under Marquis Sword Snow’s control were evidently a lot stiffer.</p><p>If Ye Chen’s cyan longswords were first-class sword artists, then Marquis Sword Snow’s white longswords were second-rate ones. The two had a difference of a whole level.</p><p>Clang Clang!</p><p>The white longswords under Marquis Sword Snow’s control were utterly defeated, and he was about to be swarmed by the cyan longswords.</p><p>“I can’t lose!”</p><p>Seeing this, Marquis Sword Snow steeled his will. He didn’t fear losing, but if possible, he would rather not lose. There was no genius who didn’t hope to be unrivalled throughout his journey.</p><p>Sometimes a thought could determine one’s life.</p><p>“Hidden Soul Sword!”</p><p>Marquis Sword Snow’s gaze pierced through the countless longswords and landed on Ye Chen’s body. With that, a formless and colorless little soul sword appeared on his forehead and shot toward Ye Chen.</p><p>Offensive Soul Secret Art!</p><p>Moreover, it was an offensive soul art used with the amplified soul power.</p><p>The spectators felt a special soul ripple. How could they not figure out that Marquis Sword Snow had used a soul attack, hoping to defeat Ye Chen with a soul attack!</p><p>Of course, nobody said anything.</p><p>A soul attack was also an attack and not some despicable trick. On the contrary, the importance of soul would get increasingly prominent upon reaching the Life-and-Death realm. One might not take the soul route, but one’s achievements in soul couldn’t be too weak.</p><p>“He is trying to injure the opponent’s soul, then defeat him with a single strike.” Marquis Sword Star immediately guessed Marquis Sword Snow’s intentions. Ordinarily, it was exceptionally difficult to extinguish a soul of a half-step King in a battle of the same level. This was because half-step Kings had developed a soul membrane outside their soul. The higher the realm, the stronger this membrane became. Moreover, a martial artist’s martial will and sword will also acted in defense against soul attacks. Therefore, even if a martial artist had not cultivated any soul defense arts, it was nigh impossible to kill them with a soul attack.</p><p>Soul was only supplementary; although it was important, it couldn’t kill an opponent in a single strike.</p><p>The speed of soul attacks was exceptionally high, much faster than energy attacks and physical attacks. It was almost reaching Ye Chen’s body.</p><p>“Soul Light!”</p><p>Of course, Ye Chen could not allow himself to be struck by the little soul sword. This amplified soul sword could very likely injure his soul.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>His forehead parted, revealing an erect third eye which shot a soul beam, colliding with the little soul sword.</p><p>How could the little soul sword match against Ye Chen’s innate skill? Marquis Sword Snow’s soul power could only match Ye Chen’s even after undergoing amplification, not to mention his grasp over his soul power was already a bit lacking. As the two made contact, the little soul sword immediately disintegrated and the pitch-black soul rays invaded Marquis Sword Snow’s Sea of Soul like hot knife cutting through butter.</p><p>Marquis Sword Snow’s face instantly turned pale, and his control over his Sword Domain vanished.</p><p>Puff Puff Puff!</p><p>The large number of cyan-colored longswords went in-and-out of his body, instantly turning him into a blood mist.</p><p>“What was that erect eye?” Many had taken notice of the eye at Ye Chen’s forehead, thinking about which legend it resembled.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
