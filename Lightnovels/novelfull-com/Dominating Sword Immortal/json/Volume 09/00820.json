Moreover, she cultivates pure demonic power.” The old man talked while operating his Undying Body and restoring his arm. The moment he deployed his blood Qi, his right arm grew out instantly. However, his aura dropped at the same time as well. Yuan Emperor’s sword had evidently slashed off quite a lot of his cultivation base.</p><p>Sizing up the bat wings at Murong Qingcheng’s back, the black-robed woman faintly nodded, “To awaken speed as innate ability…good, very good!”</p><p>“Great Elder, should we kill them?” The old man looked at Yuan Emperor’s image and Ye Chen with and overflowing killing intent. He had almost lost his life just now.</p><p>“You don’t need to concern yourself with this matter. Moreover, you were too careless!”</p><p>The black-robed woman lightly swept his palm, and a white thread was pulled out of the old man’s body. This thread contained a tyrannical purification power. Since it had no aura, it had remained undetected in his body.</p><p>“Evil Vanquishing Power!”</p><p>The old man’s heart leaped in shock. Although this thing wouldn’t have cost him his life, it would have lowered his cultivation irrecoverably. More frighteningly, in his weakness, it could have flared up and driven him mad in his meditation.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>The black-robed woman snapped her fingers, extinguishing the white thread into nothingness. She then turned her gaze to Yuan Emperor, “A mere image couldn’t have such battle strength. You probably sealed a portion of your Zhen Yuan into that scroll, allowing you to possess a battle strength surpassing ordinary Life and Death Kings.”</p><p>“Good observation power.” Yuan Emperor’s image smiled indifferently.</p><p>“I dare not accept your praise, just a little eye I have developed having cultivated to this realm.” Walking into space from the void, she stopped a dozen li away. Meanwhile, the old man closely followed behind her.</p><p>“You came for this woman?” Yuan Emperor could see that Murong Qingcheng sealed inside crystal space was a demonic human, a perfect vessel demonic human at that. Her bloodline was noble. He guessed that Ye Chen must have had her escape from the clan, resulting in a pursuit from the demonic human clan.</p><p>“Right.” The black-robed woman faintly nodded.</p><p>Yuan Emperor smiled, “Ruining a fateful love is nothing praiseworthy. This kid here is so outstanding, more than enough to be your clan’s son-in-law. Why must you be so forceful and create unnecessary hatred?”</p><p>The black-robed woman said, “You’re mistaken. I never knew them before. Who could have expected that a demonic human with perfect bloodline would be wandering outside, wasting the heaven’s bestowal upon her?”</p><p>“So, you were looking for a successor?” Yuan Emperor had a flash of understanding.</p><p>“Indeed!”</p><p>“In that case, this kid has no enmity with you. But, not only you wished to snatch his woman, but also tried to kill me. That seems quite unreasonable to me.” Yuan Emperor’s eyes turned cold.</p><p>The old man interrupted, “Killing him was because he killed many of my demonic human clan members. If he is left alive, wouldn’t my clansmen have died in vain?”</p><p>“These clansmen of yours who died were probably no geniuses. This kid, however, is a rare genius. Killing him would be the same as offending the heavens. Moreover, I have a matter that I need him for. I can’t have you people kill him.”</p><p>The black-robed woman sneered, “You think you can stop me?”</p><p>“Probably not.” Yuan Empeor’s image sized up the black-robed woman and then shook his head.</p><p>“Then, if I want to kill him, why do I need to heed your thoughts?”</p><p>“I might not be able to stop you, but you should know that a true titled monarch has means to seize some heaven’s fortune. Fortunately, I still remember it quite clearly even after so many years. If you want, I can let you have a taste of its might.”</p><p>“Are you threatening me?” The black-robed woman’s eyes squinted, her aura sharpening.</p><p>“Not threatening, just warning.”</p><p>The black-robed woman remained silent, but her aura turned increasingly sharper, as if she could act any moment and kill both Yuan Emperor’s image and Ye Chen,</p><p>Huff!</p><p>But, her aura dispersed with an exhale. She then smiled, “Interesting! Seems like you got me.”</p><p>“Hehe, who knows I might be bluffing. You’re free to try.”</p><p>The old man was almost killed by Yuan Emperor’s image, and thus, was feeling quite aggrieved. He said, “Great Elder, he’s clearly pretending. With your strength, there is no need to fear him. Even if his originally body were here, he might not have been able to prevail over you.”</p><p>“Shut your mouth!” The black-robed woman coldly glanced at the old man.</p><p>“Yes.” The latter was extremely meek before the black-robed woman.</p><p>“You win!” The black-robed woman gave up on probing, completely disregarding the old man’s words. If Yuan Emperor’s true body were here, even three of her wouldn’t hold a candle to him. How could a titled monarch capable of leaving a mark on Emperor Scar Stelle be ordinary? Moreover, even if the current Yuan Emperor seemed to be putting on a front, and she was ninety-nine percent sure of prevailing over him, it was just as the latter spoke—true titled monarchs had the means to forcefully seize the heavenly fortune. These means were abstruse, inexplicable, and couldn’t be explained through battle power alone. She had no desire to test it.</p><p>Her gaze turned to Ye Chen, “You can be rest assured. I never intended to kill you. Otherwise, I would not have rushed over personally. I do not have such foresight.”</p><p>She had been in close-door cultivation, oblivious to Murong Qingcheng’s matter. When she walked out, she found out about the recent events. She immediately knew that if they wished Murong Qingcheng to willingly enter their clan, they couldn’t kill Ye Chen, or else they would have to wipe out her memory. Fortunately, every Demonic Human King had a transmission pearl on them, which allowed her to rush over and witness the scene just now.</p><p>Ye Chen’s mind raced. He could feel that the former was indeed not lying, neither did she have any reason to. If not for the Yuan Emperor’s image, a Life-and-Death King would have been more than enough to bring Murong Qingcheng back.</p><p>“Perhaps!” Ye Chen neither agreed nor denied.</p><p>“She must come with me.” The black-robed woman resolutely said.</p><p>Yuan Emperor’s face turned helpless, “Seems like there is no way for a peaceful outcome!” As he spoke, three illusory flowers appeared above his head—red, yellow, and blue. The radiance of the three flowers intertwined, giving off a mysterious glow.</p><p>“As expected, you were not pretending.” The black-robed woman had been paying attention to Yuan Emperor’s image, so she immediately spoke, “I believe there is a peaceful way. I can convince him.”</p><p>“Oh, then I’m waiting.” Hearing that, the three flowers above his head turned stationary.</p><p>Apprehensively glancing at the three flowers above Ye Chen’s head, she faintly let out a sigh and said, “For you to have cultivated to this level, you must be desirous to attain the peak. Someday, you might become a Sword King, or even a Sword Emperor.”</p><p>“Thank you for your kind words.” Ye Chen’s face remained unchanged, calmly hearing the counterpart.</p><p>“However, have you thought whether she would be able to enter Life and Death realm if she follows you? She is a demonic human with a perfect bloodline, which is an undeniable truth. In this world, demonic Qi is extremely sparse, not nearly enough to cultivate with. I don’t know how she managed to cultivate to half-step King realm, but I can guarantee you that as long as the heaven and earth don’t flip upside down, she will not enter the Life and Death realm.”</p><p>“There has never been a Perfect Demonic Human King?” Ye Chen asked.”</p><p>“There were, but not a single one has appeared in the recent ten thousand years. And even before, a tremendous luck was required, and each one took huge time and efforts.”</p><p>Yuan Emperor smiled bitterly, “She is right. True Spirit World is not suitable to cultivate demonic power. Demonic power is the energy demonic race cultivates, and their home is not here.”</p><p>“You might take your chance, but you’ll regret it later. She will only have a lifespan of three hundred years under the Life and Death realm. Even if she succeeds in becoming King after a hundred or two hundred years, she would have turned old. Will you still find her suitable at that time?”</p><p>She closely watched Ye Chen.</p><p>Ye Chen’s face changed several times. In reality, he had almost been persuaded. The former’s words were precisely what he had been worried over. Murong Qingcheng’s demonic power crystals could at most allow her to reach the first layer of life-and-death-chamber. As for the demonic power essence, it had been almost used up. Moreover, breaking through into Life and Death realm was an exceptionally challenging task. Even a peerless genius could never be too confident of his or her chances, not to mention Murong Qingcheng, who cultivated the demonic power. Taking a step back, even if she found a huge reserve of demonic power crystals, it would merely increase her chances somewhat, but they would still be below that of a human prodigy. This was because breaking through into Life and Death realm not only required energy, but also a corresponding environment.</p><p>Seeing the struggle on Ye Chen’s face, she continued, “She is a perfect vessel demonic human. Her status in the Chaotic Demon Ocean would be grand. I’ll wholeheartedly cultivate her and make her my last disciple. In addition to that, you also know that the conditions of Chaotic Demon Ocean will be far better to cultivate demonic power compared to wandering with you. Wait till she becomes a King, then you can go wherever you want. If you suspect me, you can visit her anytime you want.”</p><p>Letting go of his hesitation, Ye Chen gravely nodded, “Alright, I agree! However, if you are not good to her or harm her, I’ll uproot the Chaotic Demon Ocean’s entire demonic human clan someday as long as I don’t die.”</p><p>What a kid!</p><p>The black-robed woman was astonished and furious. Never had someone threatened her in this manner. Fortunately, the counterpart had agreed, “You don’t need to be concerned over such a thing. I’ll let you off for your disrespect this time, but you better be careful the next time.”</p><p>“Hehe, you have some gal.” Yuan Emperor was enjoying Ye Chen’s temperament.</p><p>“But, she is still over there, so you have to convince her.” The black-robed woman waved her hand, dispersing the crystal space surrounding Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>“Give me some time.” Ye Chen’s figure flickered, heading toward Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>An hour later, Murong Qingcheng agreed. This time’s separation would probably last for quite a while, but she was not someone who dwelled too much on feelings. Moreover, if her cultivation base lacked, she would only be a burden by Ye Chen’s side. This was something she absolutely didn’t wish for.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
