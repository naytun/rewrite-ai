After all, he was a high-step King with three star battle strength. No matter how great Ye Chen’s progress was, he was sure that the latter could not take a single palm from him. Even if Copper Sword King, who destroyed his conscious projection, came here, he was confident to settle him within three palm strikes. The difference between a two star and three star battle strength was immense.</p><p>Of course, the prerequisite was that he found Ye Chen. If he couldn’t catch the latter, it didn’t matter how powerful he was.</p><p>“Run, then! To the north of Blood Sky Continent is the Boundless Ocean, and nobody will come to help you. Even Mysterious Queen took three years to comprehend the Life dao, and then another year to become a Life and Death King. No matter how talented you are, you will at least take three years!” The masked man didn’t believe that Ye Chen could break through into Life and Death realm any time soon.</p><p>…</p><p>“Ironarm King, is Ye Chen really that powerful? Although Blood Hand King was a little weaker than us, he still had two star battle strength. How could he not even buy some time?” A fierce looking middle-aged man with his face covered in bushy beard was talking to another Life and Death King via the snail in his hand.</p><p>“Ye Chen is considered the most frightening genius after Yuan Emperor by the lord, and it’s not for nothing. Even Mysterious Queen is somewhat inferior to him. For him to have this kind of battle strength is actually understandable. Think about it, he actually managed to advance his Destruction Sword Intent to the sixth step. How frightening is that? Beard King, if you find him, you better not be careless and take an undeserved loss.” Ironarm King had a sturdy body, his muscles bulging with explosive power.</p><p>Beard King faintly nodded, “Right! Sixth step Destruction Sword Intent when he’s not even reached Life and Death Realm…Once he enters Life and Death realm and grows for a few decades, he might create a miracle. After all, current seven star battle strength is comparable to the ancient experts.”</p><p>“I don’t know about sevens star battle strength, but if he matures, a six star battle strength is almost certain. Therefore, he must be removed to ease one of lord’s worries.” Ironarm King’s expression turned grim.</p><p>“Of course!” Beard King’s expression was equally grim.</p><p>…</p><p>In another part of the ocean, a huge gray bird was flying: sometimes travelling through the void, sometimes coming out and scouting using its soul power.</p><p>“Lord said that whoever killed Ye Chen in the end would be bestowed a profound bead! It’s a rare treasure even throughout the starry sky. With its help, I could comprehend profound much quicker and increase my battle strength. This is a rare opportunity, and I can’t let others snatch it. I must be the one to kill Ye Chen.”</p><p>The huge gray bird was a Beast King called Gray Bird King, and speed had always been his forte. Once he heard the news about Ye Chen, he immediately rushed over.</p><p>“This is the place where he was discovered. Alright, with his speed, I can soon catch up.” Blood Hand King had been nearest to Ye Chen, and Gray Bird King was the second nearest, while the masked man and Iron Arm King were the farthest.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>With a flap of his wings, Gray Bird King vanished.</p><p>In the void, there was no limit to speed, unlike in the space where one was bound by the limits of space. Increasing one’s speed beyond the limits of space would make one enter the void. Life and Death Kings were fine in the void as their Zhen Yuan could resist the spatial pressure. However, if somebody under Life and Death Realm entered the void, they could hardly survive. Even if they survived, their Zhen Yuan would rapidly plummet, since their consumption would be far above that of Life and Death Kings.</p><p>The void was filled with spatial power, allowing Life and Death Kings to arouse the effect of spatial shrinking, travelling tens of thousands of li in a single breath. After travelling several million li, Gray Bird King parted the space and flew out.</p><p>“Great Soul Searching Art!” His soul power radiated out in an arc, covering several hundred thousand li of area.</p><p>“Forty live auras…found him! It’s really him.” A terrifying gleam flickered in Gray Bird King’s eyes.</p><p>“I’m discovered!” Ye Chen discovered an extremely thin soul power sweeping through his body.</p><p>“Open!” Opening his silver erect eye, Ye Chen turned around gazed into the sky. His soul eye was much more frightening than the so-called Great Soul Searching Art. In a straight line, it could cover a distance of ten million li. Not only did he discover the Gray Bird King, but also Beard King. The former was merely a few hundred thousand li away from him while the latter was about seven million li away. According to the standard of distance amongst Life and Death Kings, the two were quite close to each other.</p><p>“Since I can’t escape, I can only kill. First, I’ll have to kill that flying Beast King, then the one behind him.”</p><p>The auras of Gray Bird King and Beard King were somewhat stronger than Blood Hand King’s, but not by much. Perhaps they had some aces, but did he not?</p><p>“Haha! Die!”</p><p>A distance of few hundred thousand li to Gray Hand King was almost in-range. Within ten breaths, he tore the space open and appeared before Ye Chen, intercepting his path.</p><p>“Bewitching Mirror Shattering!”</p><p>Like the fight with Poison Hand KIng and Blood Hand King, Ye Chen took the advantage of the fact that his opponent didn’t know he had been discovered and attacked brazenly. The space compressed into a mirror, sealing the stunned Gray Bird KIng within.</p><p>Peng! Peng! Peng! Peng!</p><p>The mirror shattered and the splinters of spatial power slashed at Gray Bird King’s body. His tail flew off amidst splattering blood, and a conical sharp spatial splinter even pierced his abdomen. Gray Bird King miserably shrieked, not even able to raise its head.</p><p>“Demonic Feathers Strike!”</p><p>Gray BIrd King was a Beast King after all, and the strength of its body and demonic power within far surpassed Blood Blade King. The demonic power inside its body erupted, and he instantly used his innate ability. With that, volleys of feathers shot like arrows, each containing a frightening penetrating and cutting power, creating numerous dark cracks in the space.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>When Ye Chen had issued the first strike, he’d also used Sword Steps. Dodging the feathers, he arrived before Gray Bird King within a few flickers and thrust out the Congealing Water attack. In response, the latter raised his badly mutilated left wing and met the sword.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Amidst violent energy shockwaves, Ye Chen flew back; his hand was numb and the space between forefinger and thumb bleeding.</p><p>But, Gray Bird King wasn’t faring much better. The sword energy spread inside his body through his left wing, injuring his internal organs.</p><p>“Damn!”</p><p>Gray Bird King already knew that Ye Chen was powerful, but he believed that he could suppress the latter, then slowly grind him to death using his rich demonic power. However, how could he have expected that a single wrong step by him caused all the subsequent steps to go wrong, rendering him incapable of doing anything except passively defending? He didn’t even seem like an opponent to Ye Chen.</p><p>“Humph, you can be arrogant for the momen!. With your strength, you can’t injure me enough to make me lose my battle power. With time, I can slowly gain the upper hand.” Gray Bird King calmed down and operated his Undying Body, treating his injuries.</p><p>Seeing that the other didn’t seem hurried to counterattack, Ye Chen knew what he was planning. So, he opened his erect silver soul eye again and emitted Soul Light, a slender silver colored light beam, at Gray Bird King.</p><p>“I’ve been long guarding against this move of yours.”</p><p>Gray Bird King had heard from the masked man that Ye Chen had an exceptionally powerful soul attack, and his own soul defense was also strong. Therefore, he instantly reacted and used a defensive soul art. However, he still underestimated Soul Light’s destructive power. Even with a defensive art guarding his soul, he went dizzy for a moment and lost control of his body.</p><p>The achievements of the beast race in the aspect of soul had always been inferior to that of humans. If it had been a human using a defensive soul art, Ye Chen would have been helpless.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Seeing the success of Soul Light, Ye Chen immediately struck out. A purple crystal layer covered the surface of Sky Scorpio Sword, indicating the sword’s overload.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>Sky-covering specks of light drizzled down while a huge hole opened in Gray Bird King’s chest. This region was extremely hard to heal even after achieving limb regrowth realm.</p><p>Gray Bird King had been gravely injured!</p><p>“How can this sword be so powerful!” Spurting a huge mouthful of blood, Gray Bird King looked at the Sky Scorpio Sword in Ye Chen’s hand with an appalled gaze. His Protective Demonic Power shattered like a crystal before this sword.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>Gray Bird King never expected Ye Chen to still having so many secrets: a soul power that could discover Kings and a supreme grade sword that could exponentially increase in power. Just these two secrets were enough to claim his life.</p><p>Flapping his wings, he resolutely escaped while raining down a blood underneath him.</p><p>“Take another one!”</p><p>Ye Chen looked down on Gray Bird King’s strength, but he didn’t think he could stop the latter from escaping. Making him lose his battle strength was already a success. A purple sword light shot out from Sky Scorpio Sword, chasing Gray Bird King.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Under heavy injuries, Gray Bird King’s speed clearly slowed down. Adding on the suppression of the Sword Domain, the sword light easily caught up to him and slashed his back. With a stumble, he miserably escaped in the void.</p><p>“Sky Jade Hammer!”</p><p>The moment Gray Bird King entered the void, a spiraling hammer light came piercing space. It was the big bearded man with his whole face oozing killing intent.</p><p>“This is a bit troublesome.” Ye Chen raised the Sky Scorpio Sword and defended against the hammer light.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Sparks flew, and Ye Chen’s entire being was blasted off while spurting off a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Actually, his battle strength was a bit weaker than Gray Bird King’s, The reason he could make the latter flee was primarily because the latter didn’t know he’d been discovered, and hence was caught off-guard. Then, he again underestimated Soul Light and lost control of his body for a moment. Of course, the contribution of Sky Scorpio Sword in actually inflicting the damage could not be overstated.</p><p>Now that Beard King had openly attacked him, Ye Chen lost the advantage he’d against Gray Bird King.</p><p>“So, this is it.” Beard King was delighted. He was thinking Ye Chen had three heads and six arms, but now it seemed like the latter was not as exaggerated.</p><p>“Boundless Power Hammer!”</p><p>Holding the huge black hammer with both hands, Beard King roared and struck again. The spiraling hammer light covered the heaven and earth, cutting off any chance of dodging.</p><p>“Demonic Feathers Strike!”</p><p>The most dangerous thing was that Gray Bird King had not left. Seeing that Beard King’s attack had suppressed Ye Chen, he reappeared and used his innate ability. Covering the heaven and earth, countless feathers shot toward Ye Chen as well.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
