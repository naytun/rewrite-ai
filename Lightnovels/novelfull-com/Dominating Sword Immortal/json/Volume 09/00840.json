Before, people who knew about it would think that those parties were bullying Zhang Tian Marital School. But, a recent piece of news had shocked everyone.</p><p>The three parties had rushed to Zhang Tian Martial School and wanted to take over the resources found by the school. But in the end, they had run off and barely held up together. According to the news, it was a young warrior with crazy sword arts who had beaten off all of the half step level warriors.</p><p>All in all, Ye Chen’s reputation had spread around Iron Blood Region, and a lot of people were guessing who he really was, since there was not such a person before on this land. People suspected that he might be from some hidden powerful martial school or family. But of course, regardless of the people who knew the truth, Ye Chen was regarded as powerful as the top eight beast warriors and four demons.</p><p>Inside one of the top ten beast martial schools, the Iron Paw Beast Martial School…</p><p>Inside the palace, a red flame brightened the metal walls and columns. A massive cow head person sat on top of the dozen levels high palace. The calves of the cow were a couple of feet tall, and its muscles were strong like mountains, with a skin that was dark red and full of energy.</p><p>“Is it true that all of the half step king warriors from Extreme Heaven Martial School, Bald Eagle Valley, and Earth Bear family were beaten down by one young man?”</p><p>The cow-headed person had a sight like torches, with two dozens of meters long red beam shooting out of his eyes and landing onto the pointy beaked male who was standing in the middle of the palace. The latter did not dare to lift up his head as he said carefully, “It is one hundred percent real. I would not dare to lie.”</p><p>“What kind of weapon did he use?” The Cow head man asked.</p><p>“A sword.”</p><p>“A sword?” His eyes opened suddenly again and the red light column could be seen every now and then, “Perhaps he has come from the Heaven Sword Land?”</p><p>…</p><p>In the following days, no one dared to come to Zhang Tian Martial School and mess with them. Furthermore, the mid rank spirit cave found under the mud dragon mountain had produced a great amount of spirit stones for the school, which obviously brought joy to the school members.</p><p>With a blink of an eye, one month or so had passed.</p><p>In the Blood Heaven Land, True Spirit Continent and some unknown land, savage mountain ranges could be seen everywhere. At that moment on top of every mountain, the space twisted and tornado scrambled. Amidst that endless thunder and lightning, a massive bronze gate opened slowly.</p><p>The surface of the bronze door was old and full of strange patterns as if it had traveled through time. That ancient qi had the kind of longevity that none of the beasts in the mountain dared to move or mess with it. Even time seemed to slow down, and all of the creatures that came here could sense the fear growing from the bottom of their hearts.</p><p>The life and death realm door had appeared!</p><p>On top of the three lands, the climate had started to change drastically.</p><p>…</p><p>On the true spirit continent…</p><p>Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!…</p><p>Countless shadows rushed from different places and toward the deep parts of the savage mountain. These human shadows were all belonged to teenagers, looking like they were not older than thirty years. In fact, they were actually perhaps around forty years old or close to fifty years in age. Some of them were looking serious while others passionate. The kind of aura they had was one of a kind.</p><p>Besides that, the teenagers who came to the Savage Mountain were all at the half step king warrior level. Some of them who might be a bit older let out a light hint of Life and Death Ream aura, which signified that they were already at the edge of the Life and Death Realm.</p><p>Right then, there were a lot of people on the side of the bronze door already. Amongst them were some faces familiar to Ye Chen—Bai Wuxue, Xiao Houzun, Lu Shaoyou, Xiao Chuhe, Beiming Hui, Helian Wuhua, Shangguan Fei, Situ Hao, and so on. However, some of them were people they had never met before.</p><p>“Quite a lot of people here!” Bai Wuxue smiled lightly.</p><p>Lu Shaoyou glanced over the other people and said with a cold voice, “There is only one entrance inside the True Spirit Continent, so people who are eligible for the challenge would all show up, since no one would want to give up on a chance like this.”</p><p>“Indeed, the Life and Death Challenge could save us a lot of time.” Bai Wuxue nodded.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>From afar, noises of people fighting could be heard suddenly as two figures continued to overlap and the sword qi and attacking power filled up the space.</p><p>“Once we are inside, I will fight you again.”</p><p>Multiple shadows appeared again as one of them landed on top of the peak next to that bronze door. It was indeed the former Sword Master, Liu Wujian. Of course, right now, his cultivation was already at half step king warrior level. Calling him the West Ocean Sword Master would not be appropriate anymore.</p><p>“Anytime.”</p><p>The other person was the Sky Emperor’s younger brother, Jiang Tian. He sneered and landed on the mountain peak opposite to the mountain.</p><p>Although the two were both not from the True Spirit continent, since the entrance to the Life and Death Secret Realm was here, so they had to come here. The two of them were both proud warriors, one of them was great with sword arts and the other had the power of unity. So, they were competitive from the beginning, and had started fighting from miles away all the way here.</p><p>“Everyone here is perverse.” Situ Hao, who had exchanged the Defensive Sword Spell with Ye Chen before made an expression. He had a great potential, but he knew he was still lacking a lot compared to these people.</p><p>Over at the horizon, two dots of light approached from left and right—one was blue while the other was green. The two beams of power contained completely opposing power of elements.</p><p>“Yan Fengfeng is here!” Bai Wuxue chuckled.</p><p>“Sha Ruoqing as well!”</p><p>Both the blue flame and green water ball landed on the ground—they were indeed Yan Fengfeng and the Godly Shark Princess, Sha Ruoqing. Both of them were beasts, and their qi was unimaginably powerful, reaching beyond half step king warriors.</p><p>However, just as they landed, a red figure appeared over from the horizon whom everyone could recognize—it was Dantai Mingyue.</p><p>Judging by talent, no one could compete with Dugu Jue and Dantai Mingyue on the True Spirit Continent.</p><p>“Haha, piss off!”</p><p>Suddenly, a dark red figure rushed out and blew away Jiang Tian, who did not have the time to move. Then, the light figure slowly formed into a solid shape, turning into a young man with red hair—it was indeed Chu Zhongtian.</p><p>“You are looking for death!” Jiang Tian was not wounded, so he jumped into the air while looking at Chu Zhongtian with an embarrassed expression.</p><p>Chu Zhongtian chuckled. “I have just reached Half step king warrior level, so I am desperate for a battle. Come on! Let me see your true power.”</p><p>“What? So arrogant already after just reaching the realm?”</p><p>Everyone present was extraordinary, so they could not help but be shocked upon hearing him. Jiang Tian was already at high rank half step king warrior level, so strong that no one in the same realm could fight him. But, Chu Zhongtian was just at mid rank half step king warrior level, and he somehow dared to challenge him!</p><p>“Evil spirit body! No wonder!”</p><p>Bai Wuxue shook her head and forced a smile. This kind of body type would be something that even the universe would be jealous of.</p><p>Chu Zhongtian had the evil spirit body, so his cultivation would be hard to improve. However, for him to reach from peak level Late Seas of Souls Realm to half step king warrior level was rather easy in the end, since all he needed to do was to form a perfect loop for his Zhen yuan in his blood, and had nothing really to do with his body type. In fact, because of his evil spirit body, it was actually easier for him to reach half step king warrior level compared to the other people because his heart was too powerful, which was an advantage that no one else had.</p><p>“Bastard, Hundred Symbol Palm!”</p><p>Jiang Tian was not someone who would let this kind of a thing go. He waved his hand in the air, causing a sky full of spell symbols and waves of palm power to appear and attack the other. Compared to the five symbol palm attack, the hundred symbol palm attack was almost twice as powerful. He was furious, so he started the battle with a killing attack.</p><p>“Hehe, good timing!”</p><p>A great mace appeared in Chu Zhongtian’s hand and he threw out an attack toward the incoming attack. The dark red light was horrifyingly bright, looking like a dark red sun that had just exploded and drowning all the symbols in the air.</p><p>Jiang Tian would not be that easily beaten. Although his palm power had been weakened, the remaining symbol palm power formed into a massive symbol under his control, which then fought against that dark red light.</p><p>It was the first time the two had exchanged battles, and seemed to have comparable power.</p><p>“Don’t block my way.”</p><p>Chu Zhongtian was reckless, but there was another person who was even more violent. A hundred meters long pale blade light appeared and sliced through the air, going right between the two.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Chu Zhongtian and Jiang Tian separated.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>Dugu Jue, with his hair whitened, had arrived. His aura was frightening, as if just one glance from him could send a person to a hell filled with despair directly. After Ye Chen had left, his power had improved drastically. Before, he was still not an opponent for Liu Wujian, but during that battle half a year ago, Liu Wujian had somehow lost his upper hand.</p><p>“Oh! Very powerful! ” Chu Zhongtian licked his lips.</p><p>The life and Death Realm was about to open, and the truth was that the warriors competing here were only just trying to test the waters. Therefore, Chu Zhongtian and Jiang Tian did not continue their battle.</p><p>After about another fifteen minutes, seven figures appeared from afar—the young men and women who carried life and death realm qi. There were five male warriors as well as two females.</p><p>“It is Luo Tiandu and his gang.” Bai Wuxue’s expression became serious.</p><p>Although these people were nowhere in their vision couple of years ago, people who knew the truth had all heard a lot about them. They were martial geniuses of the last generation who had been inside the life and death challenge realm, and had become half step king warriors a long time ago already.</p><p>As half step king warriors, they naturally would not spend a lot of time with Sea of Souls Realm warriors due to the power gap.</p><p>Amongst the seven, Luo Tiandu was the most powerful one, ranked second in the Life and Death Realm warrior list. The remaining six warriors all had a spot on that list as well.</p><p>“Mysterious Queen, Thunder Spirit King, and Luo Tiandu all came from the same era actually, but Mysterious Queen was just so famous that no one seemed to matter next to her.”</p><p>“Yeah, indeed! To be fair, Luo Tiandu had actually gone to the challenging realm one time less than Mysterious Queen, but then they are technically all from the same era.”</p><p>“Mysterious Queen and Luo Tiandu, were just like him and us, with at least ten years gap in between.”</p><p>Everyone discussed in a low voice as the seven approached.</p><p>“The young warriors nowadays seem to have a very short temper.” The young man with long hair next to Luo Tiandu smiled, his eyes fixed on Chu Zhongtian, Jiang Tian, and Dugu Jue.</p><p>Luo Tiandu sneered. “You are talking as if you are an old man.”</p><p>“Hehe, we are quite old compared to them. If we were normal people, we would be counted as middle aged, you know?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
