The moment they step outside the islands, they won’t find any place to escape.’</p><p>‘Strongest’ half-step Kings were existences that were revered wherever they went. They were even rarer than Life and Death Kings. The Darklight King caused apprehension even among other half-step Kings; he was a veteran half-step King.</p><p>Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng snatched the Shadow Armor right under his nose, which was definitely past his bottom line. Heavens knew how important this armor was for him. A high quality pseudo supreme grade defensive artifact on a ‘strongest’ half-step King was almost a combination of unrivaled defense. It was simply too important.</p><p>After waiting for the Darklight King to leave, the crowd erupted into discussions.</p><p>“To completely offend a ‘strongest’ half-step King is too rash! I’m afraid that they’ll end up losing not only the armor, but also their lives sooner or later.”</p><p>“However, the Shadow Armor is no small matter. Perhaps they will be able to escape from Darklight King after equipping it.” A young man who felt that losing her life at the hands of Darklight King would be too much of a pity for a beauty like Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>A robust man beside him glanced at him and said, “You must have not been here for long. If you were, you would know that what you said is simply not possible. As a veteran ‘strongest’ half-step King, the Darklight King’s strength is unfathomable. His Dark Light Palm Arts contains two profounds—fire and earth—and the degree of integration is quite high. Even if their defense is formidable…although they wouldn’t die in one or two palm strikes, what about a dozen? They would certainly die unless they have the Zhen Yuan to keep the armor active for a long time.”</p><p>Using a pseudo supreme grade artifact cost a lot of Zhen Yuan. Ordinary half-step Kings could only activate the armor a few times. Although defensive artifacts didn’t cost as much as offensive ones, they lasted only slightly longer, which was merely prolonging one’s death. After all, attacks of ‘strongest’ half-step Kings were extremely powerful, not to mention Darklight King, who specialized in breaking defense.</p><p>“This…there might be an accident.”</p><p>“Where do you find such accidents?”</p><p>…</p><p>Leaving the Glorious Exchanges, the two spotted Wang Lan in a corner, who walked up to them and asked, “What can I do next?”</p><p>Buying the Shadow Armor, Murong Qingcheng was in quite a good mood. She directly handed a hundred upper grade stones to her and said, “You should know which islands are relatively quiet and suitable to stay in for a while. Take us to one.”</p><p>“All of the blue islands are relatively peaceful, but the Deep Blue Island is the best. It has all kinds of constructions: luxurious courtyards, ancient buildings, and even underground constructs. However, only half-step Kings are allowed entry on the island.” Wang Lan was quite familiar with the Gemstone Islands, so she chattered actively.</p><p>“That’s fine, take us there.” Ye Chen nodded faintly.</p><p>Wang Lan stared blankly for a moment, then hurriedly said, “Oh, over there!” Ye Chen’s words were confirmation of them being half-step Kings.</p><p>Deep Blue Island didn’t allow martial artists under half-step King realm to enter. However, if someone was coming along with a half-step King, they were allowed. After all, there were many half-step Kings who liked to be attended, and not everyone could be refused! Therefore, it wouldn’t be an issue for Wang Lan to enter the island as a guide for half-step Kings.</p><p>On the island, there were almost no commercial buildings; they were all residential complexes. Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng chose a huge garden and checked in.</p><p>The fee was not high at all, merely a thousand upper grade spirit stones for a month. It seemed as if they didn’t want to profit off half-step Kings, and only wanted them to stay at Gemstone Islands.</p><p>With the Shadow Armor in hand, Murong Qingcheng went to her room, preparing to brand it with her divine sense. Ye Chen went to the pavilion on the lake to watch the scenery. As for Wang Lan, Ye Chen gave her a small independent courtyard next to theirs. One could faintly hear air-cleaving sounds from the other side; she was most likely practicing some martial skill.</p><p>The dark-green lake was brimming with lilies and lotuses of various colors. They gently swayed with the wind, looking elegant and beautiful. Apart from a chain of pavilions was a gray-colored stone bridge on the lake. From Ye Chen’s view, the stone bridge under the afternoon sun painted a picturesque scene.</p><p>Ye Chen was one to go with his heart. He simply laid down in the pavilion and took a little nap. After an unknown time, a yellow light flickered in the sky like a meteor streaking across the horizon. With a faint whiz, the yellow light arced and arrived at Ye Chen’s pavilion.</p><p>Ye Chen opened his eyes and smiled, “You’re also here at Gemstone Islands.”</p><p>His guest was none other than the yellow-robed woman from the Mysterious Yin Pagoda.</p><p>“Huang Mei…I still don’t know your name” The yellow-robed woman sat on the chair with a vibrant smile and poured herself a cup of tea.</p><p>Ye Chen sat across her and said, “Ye Chen.”</p><p>“Good name. I heard a man and a woman offended Darklight King at Glorious Exchanges. It isn’t you two, is it?” Huang Mei said pensively.</p><p>Ye Chen smiled in acknowledgment.</p><p>“Darklight King is strong. You best not be careless. I will even say you better not directly clash with him. His Dark Light Palm Art is quite troublesome. Even my innate ability is somewhat unable to keep up. After so many years, his palm arts should be even more formidable.”</p><p>Ye Chen said, “So much talk…Seems like you’ve exchanged blows with him.”</p><p>For how powerful ‘strongest’ half-step Kings were, Ye Chen still didn’t have a clear idea. However, he was sure of one thing: the ‘strongest’ half-step Kings wouldn’t be able to do anything to him.</p><p>“Yeah…Eh, you’ve entered the half-step King realm!” Huang Mei faintly nodded and let out an exclamation. When she arrived, she hadn’t paid attention to Ye Chen’s cultivation base, and just now measured Ye Chen a bit to discover that he had entered the half-step King realm. Ye Chen was so formidable even when he was at late Sea of Soul realm. Now that he had entered half-step King realm, how powerful would he be?</p><p>“Hehe…seems like I was worried for nothing.”</p><p>In reality, although she felt that Ye Chen was powerful, if she went all out, she had the confidence to prevail over him. After all, the ‘strongest’ half-step Kings were not just for show. Not to mention, she also had a pseudo supreme grade artifact suitable for her. If she went all out, her battle power would be unimaginable.</p><p>It should be known that pseudo supreme grade artifacts were too high-end for half-step Kings. Ordinary half-step Kings could only use them a few times. However, ‘strongest’ half-step Kings could use them at a different level.</p><p>However, Ye Chen was now a half-step King, so his strength must have increased by many folds. Darklight King was bound to suffer a big loss.</p><p>Of course, she was not aware that Ye Chen’s entering half-step King was not the same as others. In addition to the Zhen Yuan purity, he had actually improved his Green Lotus Sword Arts to heaven grade, and had also partially completed a sword domain. He was a frightening existence regardless of whether he fought one on one or went against a crowd.</p><p>Finishing her tea, Huang Mei left.</p><p>A few days later, Murong Qingcheng not only wiped off the previous soul imprint from the armor, but also branded her own soul imprint. As a pseudo supreme grade artifact, the Shadow Armor could make minute adjustments. For example, since Murong Qingcheng was a woman, the armor had turned a lot slender and protruded out in the chest area. It didn’t feel out of sync on her body at any place.</p><p>In the yard, Ye Chen said, “Let’s try out the Star Force Field first?”</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng didn’t use the Dark Force Field as she poured her demonic power into the armor, activating the innate Force Field of the Shadow Armor—Star Force Field.</p><p>Whizz!</p><p>A transparent ripple spread out. Standing before Murong Qingcheng, Ye Chen felt the void squeezing in, making any movement a lot harder. Under her control, a repulsive force acted on his body, seeming like a great force of the heaven and earth.</p><p>Deng Deng Deng!</p><p>As a result, Ye Chen retreated several steps.</p><p>“Quite good!”</p><p>As soon as Ye Chen spoke, the repulsion suddenly turned into attraction, and he was forced to greatly increase his Zhen Yuan circulation to counteract it.</p><p>“Now, let’s see the result of combining the two force fields!”</p><p>The strength of Star Force Field was considerable. Ye Chen estimated that even if he operated his Zhen Yuan at full force, he would still be somewhat influenced by it. The closer he was to Murong Qingcheng, the bigger the influence became. It was no wonder the Black Flame King valued the armor so highly. After all, in a battle of experts, even a hair’s breadth was considered a distance.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng body crackled with dark purple lightning and the space suddenly flashed while the entire courtyard turned indistinct.</p><p>Rip!</p><p>Caught off guard, Ye Chen was blasted off by a powerful repulsive force. Even circulating his Zhen Yuan at full force didn’t help one bit. He was too close to Murong Qingcheng; moreover, the purity and intensity of his Zhen Yuan was more or less the same as hers, but her demonic power was much stronger than his Zhen Yuan.</p><p>“Too powerful!”</p><p>Ye Chen directly slammed into the courtyard wall. If not for Murong Qingcheng withdrawing the force field, he would have traveled much farther, and would have also received some light injuries.</p><p>Retracting the repulsive force, Murong Qingcheng suddenly changed the force field, transforming it into an attractive one. Under the amplification of the Star Force Field, a black hole like attractive force pulled Ye Chen in with a speed as if he was piercing through the void.</p><p>“Sword Domain!”</p><p>At the crucial moment, Ye Chen unleashed his sword domain, which interwove with Murong QIngcheng’s Dark Force Field.</p><p>Although the Sword Domain was not a force field, it had powerful defensive and offensive capabilities. Passing through layers upon layers, Dark Force Field’s influence was no longer much when it finally reached Ye Chen.</p><p>Crackle!</p><p>The dark purple lightning outside Murong Qingcheng’s body dispersed, and her force field dissipated. Retracting his sword domain as well, Ye Chen praised, “It’s freakishly strong! Even the ‘strongest’ half-step Kings would be incapable of approaching you, and can only fight from range.”</p><p>A force field could have a great overall impact, but its offense was a lot weaker. This was because the energy of the force field would be concentrated only temporarily.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng said, “This armor has one more use.”</p><p>“What use?”</p><p>Huff!</p><p>A dim shadow flickered, and Murong Qingcheng arrived before Ye Chen.</p><p>“Speed amplification.” Ye Chen’s eyes shone. Murong Qingcheng was already quite fast. Adding the Shadow Armor, her speed was most likely at the crown of half-step King realm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
