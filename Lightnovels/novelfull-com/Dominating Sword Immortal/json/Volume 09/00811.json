Some even doubted their own eyes. They could not find any other reason for the scene before their eyes to happen.</p><p>The Darklight King’s cultivation base was three levels above Ye Chen’s, as the latter was merely a mid half-step King. There was still the peak half-step King realm, and then the first and second layers of Life and Death chamber between him and the Darklight King. Just the difference in the cultivation base between the two was an enormous disparity.</p><p>Even if Darklight King had not injured Ye Chen with a single blow, the two still should have at least stood on even grounds. Who knew Ye Chen would be so frightening to establish an absolutely upper hand in a single exchange!</p><p>Ye Chen indifferently smiled, not chasing after Darklight King.</p><p>Even when he was at late Sea of Soul realm, he had a strength nearing the ‘strongest’ half-step Kings with his Thunder Calamity Sword in hand. At present, he was already at the mid half-step King realm. Even without the Evil Vanquishing Sword, he could easily contend against second layer ‘strongest’ half-step Kings.</p><p>As for advantages and disadvantages, Ye Chen indeed lacked a lot in terms of cultivation base compared to the Darklight King. However, one should not forget that Waning Moon was one of his aces. Regardless of how powerful Darklight King’s palm art were, they inevitably fell short. In terms of will, Ye Chen’s Destruction Sword Intent had already attained the fifth step, which was equivalent to sixth step ordinary sword intents. On the other hand, the other merely had a peak fourth step martial will, lacking by one and a half levels.</p><p>Such a difference in wills was not something that could be supplemented by the cultivation base. Under similar battle power conditions, the person with a higher will would have the last laugh. The reason was very simple; during a prolonged battle, one’s fleshy vitality would continuously drop, as well as consumption of Zhen Yuan and endurance. However, as long as one didn’t die, one’s will would not suffer as much, and it might become even stronger the more one fought.</p><p>One could say that will represented a person’s potential to some extent.</p><p>“Sure enough, I’ll see the creation of a legend with my own eyes.” Huang Mei faintly smiled. Since the ancient times, numerous geniuses would be born in every era. However, there were only one or two legends each time.</p><p>There was no legendary character in the current era. Although the current titled monarchs were strong, they were merely peerless experts and not legends. However, this situation had started to change in the past few years. Numerous geniuses had popped out, each more perverse than the other. Everybody could feel that perhaps the entire True Spirit World would undergo a change in the next few years, by the time these geniuses would have matured. Perhaps, the True Spirit World could enter a golden era which would not lose out to the late, or even mid ancient times. Huang Mei had been roaming the oceans for many years, but Ye Chen was the first person to give her such thoughts. He was indeed too perverse, and a bit of an anomaly.</p><p>“Stop for me!” Darklight King’s Zhen Yuan exploded, operating to its limits as his entire being forcefully halted. Grinding under his feet, the void twisted while he stared at Ye Chen unblinkingly.</p><p>Just now, Ye Chen had only made two movements—leaning forward and then striking. However, these two movements made him feel as if his hands and feet were tied, as if his each and every movement had already been taken into consideration by his opponent. It was as if the result was already preordained, and there was nothing he could do.</p><p>He was even more astonished that Ye Chen could instantly erupt with a speed even greater than Murong Qingcheng. What kind of an explosive power was this?</p><p>Murong Qingcheng was healing her injuries while watching the battle, not in the slightest surprised by this outcome. Nobody was clearer than her how swift Ye Chen could be once he entered battle mode. He was like a peerless treasured sword that was bound to injure as soon as it left the sheath.</p><p>“Very well, you’re worthy to experience my aces!”</p><p>In his battle with Murong Qingcheng, the Darklight King had rarely used his aces. Although her forcefield that didn’t allow him to approach was one of the reasons, an even bigger reason was that he didn’t wish to. Although Murong Qingcheng was troublesome, he didn’t think he needed to reveal his secret moves.</p><p>“Then let me experience the hidden moves of a ‘strongest’ half-step King!” Holding the Evil Vanquishing Sword, Ye Chen stood in the void as his blue clothes madly fluttered in the wind, looking like a blue flag.</p><p>“Darklight King is starting to get serious!”</p><p>A few people who had some understanding started to discuss. Up to this moment, Darklight King didn’t reveal any of his aces, only using the Darklight Fist Arts’ first style. It should be known that one’s secret aces had an immense effect on any battle. If the two sides’ strength was similar, one’s secret moves were the deciding factor of the battle. Moreover, as one’s realm improved, the requirements of secret skills became even harsher. Some heaven grade secret arts were simply too frightening, unknown and unheard of. Therefore, the scene of one party instantly slaying the other was not too uncommon.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Darklight King moved amidst numerous discussions. He leapt up, and a majestic intent shrouded the sun and moon like a legendary roc spreading its wings. Looking at his soaring figure, everybody could feel their hearts tightening. In their perception, the heaven and earth turned hazy and chaotic, as if doomsday had arrived.</p><p>“This is the true Darklight Imprint.” High in the air, Darklight roared like thunder and pressed his palm down. The palm turned increasingly bigger and finally set off, transforming into a huge palm that seemed like scorched lands. Lava spewed out of the cracks on the palm, emitting a shining black smoke.</p><p>“He hid so deep.” Ye Chen smiled coldly. If the previous Darklight Palm Imprint were to be considered sixty percent complete, the current one was ninety percent complete. Looking at the scorched, lava-covered palm that seemed almost real, everybody was awed by its might.</p><p>However, it was still not enough.</p><p>The Evil Vanquishing in Ye Chen’s hands shook and spawned a dazzling white flower before Ye Chen raised his arm and slashed. With a ‘hiss’ sound, the Evil Vanquishing sword cleaved the air. In the next instant, seven slender, hair-like sword Qi shot forth, heading toward the Darklight Palm Imprint at an extreme speed without a single sound.</p><p>Pop! Pop! Pop!</p><p>At that moment, an astonishing scene occurred as the seemingly harmless sword Qi immediately gained an absolute upper hand. The five fingers of the palm were instantly slashed and left the palm, disintegrating in the air. Meanwhile, the sixth sword Qi cut open the hollow of the palm and the seventh one pierced through like sun blossoming at the dark horizon.</p><p>The Darklight Palm Imprint had been broken just like that!</p><p>“What!”</p><p>Even before the sword Qi arrived, a chilly sword intent hit Darklight King’s face, turning his scalp numb. The sword Qi was simply too swift, and thus, seemed as if it could pierce anything in its wake. At this moment, the Darklight King couldn’t dodge even though he desperately wished to. He dared to be certain that as soon as he made a dodging maneuver, he would be slashed by the sword Qi.</p><p>“Seal!”</p><p>At the moment of extreme peril, blue veins bulged on Darklight King’s forehead and his Zhen Yuan erupted like a volcano, crazily surrounding his body and resisting the sword Qi.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>In the next instant, the sword Qi slashed at the Darklight King’s Protective Zhen Yuan. A wave of metal-clashing sound rang out, and a sword scar appeared on his Protective Zhen Yuan. If not for the Darklight Palm Imprint obstructing it before, it would have easily pierced through the Protective Zhen Yuan.</p><p>“Darklight King, I’ll be quite disappointed if you’re only worth so much.” At some point, Ye Chen had already arrived before the Darklight King. The two stood before each other; one had a panicked face while the other had a cold face.</p><p>Rip! Ye Chen raised his sword, thrusting at the other’s Protective Zhen Yuan.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Darklight King roared spun, abruptly breaking into numerous figures that all looked completely identical.</p><p>‘Darklight King’s Cicada Shedding Carapace!’</p><p>A few people shouted inwardly. The Cicada Shedding Carapace was a high rank heaven grade secret art that was extremely difficult to cultivate. As long as one could cultivate it to major completion, they could not be killed or even injured unless the difference in strength was several folds. It was said that the Darklight King had cultivated this skill to minor completion, which was the reason other experts of the same grade didn’t wish to face him.</p><p>With this skill, Ye Chen would most likely be out of options.</p><p>However, how could they have expected that the reality would be completely different from what they had imagined!</p><p>Ye Chen’s Evil Vanquishing Sword danced bizarrely, piercing through every single Darklight King and leaving behind a fading, flickering sword image in the end.</p><p>Dozens of li away, Darklight King appeared in a wretched state. His head was lowered, his face extremely unsightly. On his thigh was a sword hole, spurting dark-red blood and dying his clothes. He had already used the Cicada Shedding Carapace, but still couldn’t escape Ye Chen’s strike. He could only guess what level the other’s discerning power, skill, and sword speed had reached.</p><p>Such a frightening sword artist! Not only did Darklight King feel highly discouraged, even the others felt that it was inconceivable. It was especially the case for the head steward and Yue Lingshuang. The former had a gloomy face while the latter was flabbergasted. As for Yue Bingxin, how could she have expected Ye Chen to become so strong after merely a few months?</p><p>Shaking the blood off the Evil Vanquishing Sword, Ye Chen was somewhat astonished. His sword that broke Darklight King’s palm imprint and left him a sword scar was the Spiritual Sword. Along with the increase in his strength, Spiritual Sword had become increasingly refined. Although its overall destructive power could not be compared to Waning Moon, its local destructive power was quite powerful.</p><p>Of course, not everybody could bring out such a level of the Spiritual Sword, as it took a soul genius like Ye Chen to attain this level. This was because as the speed of sword increased, it would become increasingly difficult to control, inevitably suppressing this art’s full potential.</p><p>The reason Darklight King could dodge the Spiritual Sword was undoubtedly his secret art, which was exceptional indeed.</p><p>“Go!” Pointing his right hand’s sword fingers, Ye Chen said coldly.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>The Thunder Calamity Sword at Ye Chen’s waist shuttled toward the Darklight King like wriggling lightning in the void.</p><p>Sword Control Art!</p><p>Peng!</p><p>Darklight King issued a palm strike at the Thunder Calamity Sword. However, how could the Thunder Calamity Sword be broken so easily? Although Ye Chen’s soul power didn’t increase after entering half-step King realm, he had already started to form the soul membrane. Thus, the intensity of his soul was several times higher, and his current Sword Control Art was nothing like before.</p><p>As a result, the Darklight King retreated for several steps while stumbling, unable to stop.</p><p>“Fifteen Identical Swords!”</p><p>Controlling the Thunder Calamity Sword from afar, Ye Chen pressed his sword finger downwards, causing the Thunder Calamity Sword to transform into fourteen Zhen Yuan flying swords. Along with its main body, the flying swords shot toward Darklight King like a thunderstorm.</p><p>“Even proficient in the lost Sword Control Art! Who is this person?”</p><p>“Darklight King is being suppressed…moreover suppressed all the way.”</p><p>Ye Chen’s strength piqued everybody’s strength.</p><p>“Young master Ye will win.” Yue Bingxin was delighted.</p><p>“I’m afraid it won’t be that simple.” Yue Lingshuang shook her head with a slight frown.</p><p>“Darklight King, what are you waiting for? Don’t tell me you really can’t kill him?” At this moment, the head steward’s Zhen Yuan transmission arrived in Darklight King’s ears.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
