Thunder calamity focused on strength, wind fire calamity focused on will, and godly Yuan calamity on the soul. Therefore, even though the thunder calamity was the first calamity, it was not weak in any way. All the three calamities focused on different aspects, and didn’t have the strong-weak distinction.</p><p>The one wave of Doomsday Thunder God Palace already stunned the masked man, and seeing another wave coming was simply beyond his imagination.</p><p>This wave was still the Doomsday Thunder God Palace, but its might was far greater than the previous one. Terrifyingly, all the one hundred and eight thunder dragons seemed to have come alive in this moment. Dragon cries reverberated throughout the sky, carrying a majestic dragon might with them.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>Shaking their heads and rocking their tails, the thunder dragons spouted beams of blade-like, dazzling lightning beams, which reached Ye Chen within a flicker. The Evil Shattering Sword in his left hand waved out, cutting apart lightning beams one after another, while the Sky Scorpio Sword in his right hand emitted a purple sword Qi that smashed into the thunder city, causing a rain of sparks and purple light specks.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>With a thought from Ye Chen, a sword dragon formed and slashed at the incessantly attacking thunder dragons.</p><p>As the thunder dragons scattered one after another, the assault on Ye Chen slowly lightened. By the time all the dragons scattered, the thunder city was already within a hundred li of Ye Chen. The crazy pressure made him feel as if he were exploding from within. His flesh was suppressed and Protective Zhen Yuan was violently flickering, warped to its limits.</p><p>“Go back!”</p><p>With the two swords criss-crossed, Ye Chen shot up like a meteor and pushed back against the thunder city. The fifth step spirit body gave him the confidence of being able to endure the imminent rebound.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The thunder city cracked, and Ye Chen spurted out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Peng! Peng! Peng!</p><p>After several times, Ye Chen forcibly pushed back against the thunder city back in the black hole. However, the moment the thunder city was about to completely disappear inside the black hole, the large thunder dragon at the city’s center ‘awakened’. It raised its head and faintly opened its mouth, spouting a vast lightning beam. The beam smashed into Ye Chen’s Protective Zhen Yuan, blasting him off.</p><p>With his skin burnt black and emitting smoke, Ye Chen shot through the ocean. When he flew up, his pupils were shrunk, looking up.</p><p>Directly above him, a huge thunder dragon was circling indefinitely. Berserk lightning was spiraling around its body, and its two horns were condensing black lightning bolts.</p><p>Doomsday Dragon!</p><p>“Insane, completely insane! A calamity after the doomsday dragon palace. Could it be that thunder calamity’s level has been forcefully increased due to him?” The masked man’s mouth was wide opened, having long lost the power to scream.</p><p>Aweee!</p><p>The Doomsday Dragon was more than a hundred li long. Its mountain-like dragon claw swept down and grabbed at the space, cracking it. The tip of the claw was flickering in lightning, implying a thunder force field.</p><p>Zi! Zi! Zi! Zi! Zi!</p><p>Ye Chen could feel the moisture in his body evaporating and his skin withering. The powerful lightning force was making his hands and legs go soft; his strength was slowly leaving him.</p><p>“Sword Dragon Art!”</p><p>Following his soul power, forty two sword phantoms formed a sword dragon, which pounced at the dragon claw.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>The dragon claw’s might was too immense. The sword dragon scattered, turning into countless specks of sword phantoms and flying off in every direction. However, it slightly reduced the momentum of the descending dragon claw and also created a gap in the thunder force field.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The Sky Scorpio Sword slashed off one of the claw’s fingers, but the remaining claw smashed into Ye Chen’s body. The size of the claw was immense, pressing into him like a mountain and almost burying him into the ocean.</p><p>“One more!”</p><p>The resistance of ocean water increasingly reduced the speed of the dragon claw. Meanwhile, Ye Chen pushed his Sword Domain to its limits and slashed off another finger from the claw, then the third finger, fourth finger, and the fifth finger.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>The purple crystals of Sky Scorpio Sword rapidly swelled, and in the next moment, it turned into a ten-meters-long crystal giant sword. Holding the giant sword, Ye Chen shot up and cut through the claw’s palm, cleaving the entire claw into two. Leaving the water, he took the initiative to attack the Doomsday Dragon.</p><p>The dragon’s reactions weren’t too fast, so its body was penetrated by Ye Chen. However, considering its size, this small amount of firepower didn’t seem to be effective.</p><p>It swept his long tail; Ye Chen, who had nowhere to dodge, was swept away a thousand li away. He spurted out huge mouthfuls of blood, his right arm completely shattered.</p><p>“Too powerful! This dragon has a superior two star battle strength, and I only have a mid two star battle strength. To overcome this calamity, I can only whittle it down, since it doesn’t have the Undying Body. Every time it loses a part of its body, its strength will decrease. Thus, I only need to preserve.”</p><p>The might of the calamity was usually a bit higher than the martial artist’s. It couldn’t be too perverse, or nobody could pass the Life and Death Calamity. However, Ye Chen’s excessive battle strength had turned this calamity frightening. While others’ calamities were only a bit stronger than them, his calamity was a whole minor level higher than him.</p><p>Sword Qi criss-crossed, and lightning and thunder rampaged as Ye Chen and the hundred-li-long dragon’s battle continued. The surroundings in a few ten thousand li turned into nothingness due their battle strength, from north to south, and east to west.</p><p>Meanwhile, the masked man coldly watched from a distance.</p><p>“Pursuing Thunder King, what’s happening?” Beard King, Ironarm King, as well as the heavily injured Gray Bird King, all arrived.</p><p>“He is undergoing the calamity!” The masked man, known as Pursuing Thunder King, let out a breath and slowly said.</p><p>“Undergoing the calamity?” Beard King gazed into distance then frowned, “What is this calamity? How can it be frightening? If I’d faced this back then, I would have died instantly.”</p><p>“Thunder calamity even more frightening than the Doomsday Dragon Palace!” A cold light flickered in the masked man’s eyes.</p><p>“What? Wasn’t Doomsday Dragon Palace the most frightening thunder calamity?” The faces of all Beard King, Ironarm King, as well as Gray Bird King turned pale. They already had a bad feeling when they saw Ye Chen undergoing the calamity. And now that his calamity seemed so frightening, they couldn’t imagine how frightening his future achievements would be.</p><p>“This kid…has to die!” The masked man coldly uttered six words.</p><p>“He must die!” The other three also spoke resolutely.</p><p>“Once he finishes the godly Yuan calamity, his soul will be the weakest. All three of us will act together, not giving him any opportunity,” Gray Bird King spoke through its teeth.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The long battle drained Ye Chen’s Zhen Yuan like flowing water, and he soon had almost none left. Fortunately, the dragon’s strength had also downgraded to inferior second star level, and it could no longer resist him.</p><p>A short while later, the size of the dragon had reduced to a few dozen li, and its battle strength continued to plummet: from two star to one star superior, one star mid…</p><p>Kacha!</p><p>Amidst a blinding purple sword light, Ye Chen slashed Doomsday Dragon apart.</p><p>“Finally, the thunder calamity is over!” Ye Chen smiled bitterly. There was only a trace of Zhen Yuan left in his body. If his Zhen Yuan had run out before killing the dragon, the one dying would certainly have been him. Although the chances of passing Life and Death Calamity were high, there were still instances of people failing and dying. Out of a hundred people, at least two failed and went to their graves.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
