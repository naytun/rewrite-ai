The latter Lord stood tall with a height of 1.9 meters like a straight spear, his black hair fluttering like a flag.</p><p>“You’re pretty unfortunate!” Young Undying Lord said with curled lips.</p><p>“Why?” Ye Chen asked.</p><p>“You ran into me, of course!” In Young Undying Demon Lord’s heart, Lashan Mei was already his. He would not allow any other male to get close to her. Thus, Ye Chen had already touched his reverse scale.</p><p>“Let me return those words back to you then.” Ye Chen said indifferently.</p><p>“Words won’t save you. In a moment, you won’t even be able to get it up.”</p><p>“Ha!”</p><p>Following his roar, a tyrannical aura frantically erupted while strands of whirling mist-like Qi streams spiraled in the shaking chamber. At the center of the streams, Young Undying Demon Lord rapidly circulated his Zhen Yuan and thrust his palm out. The fist energy transformed into a sky-covering tsunami while rushing toward Ye Chen with an overwhelming might.</p><p>Chaotic Demon Palm!</p><p>“Eh, Young Undying Demon Lord actually used fist arts, how strange!”</p><p>“Seems like Young Undying Demon Lord has other plans. Perhaps he thinks Ye Chen is not worthy enough and wants to settle him with fist arts.”</p><p>In his previous battles, Young Undying Demon Lord never used fist arts. Thus, his current actions perplexed everybody.</p><p>Young Undying Demon Lord’s Zhen Yuan was extremely rich, at least twice as rich as a normal third layer expert. Boundless fist energy that contained both hard and soft attributes swarmed Ye Chen and exploded, creating a calamitous wave of Qi energy that created chaos as it swept across.</p><p>If Young Undying Demon Lord’s fist energy was a river, Ye Chen was a small boat floating on this river. However, standing on this boat was a peerless swordsman, making this boat firm and light even when floating on this tumultuous river. Under his released soul power, the incoming huge wave of Qi energy slowed down, allowing him to have a clear look at it.</p><p>At that moment, Ye Chen unsheathed his sword and issued an uncountable number of sword strikes within an instant. The hair-like slender sword Qi dispersed out along the trajectory that faintly resembled a huge wave.</p><p>Rip Rip!</p><p>At that moment, an astonishing scene occurred, as countless sword Qi threads came out of the fist energy wave. Young Undying Demon Lord, who was the first to attack, was caught unprepared. As a result, several sword Qi pierced through his defenses, causing several scars to appear on his body.</p><p>“What happened?” Marquis Sword Star and Marquis Sword Snow were moved in the face of this sight.</p><p>The direction of Ye Chen’s attacks followed the gaps in fist energy precisely. Young Undying Demon Lord’s fist energy was like a chaotic stream which consisted of countless different powers. The gaps it contained were precisely the cracks between the different powers. Although they could see the gaps, they might not be able to accomplish it because it required an astonishing insight and effort. If there were even the slightest bit of error, the entire effort would have been wasted.</p><p>“Impressive! But, relying on excessive skill won’t help you prevail over the Young Undying Demon Lord.” Although Marquis Star Sword had shock written all over his face, but he shook his head.</p><p>“You actually broke my Chaotic River!” Young Undying Demon Lord was quite astonished. From the previous exchanges, he could see that Ye Chen was an extremely skillful sword artist. Therefore, he revealed his never used fist arts, trying to entrap Ye Chen from all sides and not allow him to exhibit his skill. However, he never expected that the latter’s skill was at such a level.</p><p>“Chaos Disaster!”</p><p>As the Young Undying Demon Lord spun his arms, that boundless fist energy unceasingly caved in, condensing and shortening while making it impossible for Ye Chen to find any holes. The powerful spinning force even caused the air around to be sucked in as the condensed fist energy hovered between Young Undying Demon Lord’s palms.</p><p>“Explode!”</p><p>Using the skill of spinning and compression, Young Undying Demon Lord accumulated a frightening amount of power and pushed it toward Ye Chen.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Like a mountain flood or the earth splitting open from inside, a boundless power erupted toward Ye Chen. The powerful ripples created could even be felt behind the separation of the special crystal.</p><p>“Ye Chen is going to lose!”</p><p>This palm strike’s might was too great, and the eruption of compressed energy was too frightening. This move of Young Undying Demon Lord was undoubtedly a high level energy compression skill, a fusion of water and dark profound. Apart from a handful of people, it was simply irresistible.</p><p>“Absolute suppression? You’ve got the wrong person for that.”</p><p>As Ye Chen stepped out, Destruction Sword Intent crazily swept across in every direction, wiping the incoming ripples clean. Meanwhile, he raised Evil Vanquishing Sword in his right hand…</p><p>…and slashed down!</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Space split apart and a black-colored waning moon flickered in the void. Young Undying Demon Lord’s compressed fist energy eruption split as if it had run into an incorporeal reef. Most importantly, this reef itself seemed to be moving. After separating the fist energy, a black moon suddenly appeared before Young Undying Demon Lord and severely struck his chest.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The Young Undying Demon Lord’s Protective Zhen Yuan thoroughly disintegrated before his whole being shot back while spurting blood and smashed into the chamber’s wall, creating a huge noise.</p><p>In the first exchange of moves, the Young Undying Lord had utterly lost.</p><p>Woo!</p><p>Everybody was stupefied. Ye Chen’s battle strength seemed to have been revealed only at this moment, astonishing everybody.</p><p>‘My gold profound has long since reached ninety percent completion, so close to greater completion. Moreover, my water profound is also at sixty percent completion. Waning Moon has evolved from the Golden Hurricane. Metal births water…As long as the metal profound exists, the source of its power will never be slashed. In terms of explosive power, it doesn’t lack behind Chaos Disaster, and in terms of strength, it is far above.’</p><p>One could even say that Waning Moon had grown step-by-step alongside Ye Chen. Ninety percent metal profound completion might be the very crown of the young generation. It should be known that the higher one went in profound comprehension, the harder it became. Even powerful Life and Death Kings usually only had greater completion in one or two profounds. As for complete perfection, only peerless geniuses like Mysterious Queen could accomplish such a feat. Of course, titled Monarchs could accomplish perfection in several profounds, for it was a basic requirement of becoming a tilted monarch.</p><p>Cough! Cough! Cough!</p><p>Picking himself up from the ground, Young Undying Demon Lord spurted out huge mouthful of bloods; his face was completely pale.</p><p>“Restore!”</p><p>Black Qi whirled around Young Undying Demon Lord’s body and entered his body. In the next moment, his injuries and paleness disappeared completely.</p><p>“Very well! I was thinking to myself that it would be too boring if you lost just like that. Now, it seems like my concerns were unnecessary.” Young Undying Demon Lord coldly spoke while wiping from the corner of his mouth.</p><p>“Your turn is over. It’s my turn now.” Ye Chen didn’t care much about the other’s words.</p><p>Using Sword Steps, Ye Chen’s speed exploded. If somebody were to look from afar, they would only see a wisp of light streaking across. He arrived before Young Undying Demon Lord’s body in the blink of an eye and thrust his sword out.</p><p>Sword Step was nothing but Ye Chen combining three sword styles into one. Within short distances, its explosive speed was without peer. As a result, the Undying Demon Lord had his throat pierced without being able to react.</p><p>“You can’t kill me.” However, the latter completely disregarded being pierced in throat and issued a barrage of punches and palm strikes targeting his chest. Confronting such suicidal attacks from Young Undying Demon Lord’s, many other experts with higher battle strength than him had been defeated.</p><p>True Spirit Continent’s young experts all took in deep breaths; Young Undying Demon Lord’s undying body was too frightening. They had no idea how Ye Chen could break this unbreakable situation.</p><p>“Ye Chen, you got to have a way!” Having been defeated previously, Chu Zhongtian knew precisely how powerful Young Undying Demon Lord’s body was.</p><p>Ye Chen had the Undying Body too; perhaps it couldn’t compare with Young Undying Demon Lord’s, since the latter’s’ was attained through the Undying Demon Art and had a clear innate superiority. But, in this situation of mutual destruction, Ye Chen actually still had a good chance of defeating the other. Of course, this was under the assumption he did not reveal the Bewitching Mirror Destruction.</p><p>Once Bewitching Mirror Destruction was revealed, Young Undying Demon Lord wouldn’t even be able to struggle. It should be known that even a peak level evil spirit was not able to survive under this move. However, Ye Chen had no intention of revealing that move. After leaving this secret realm, he would still have to face major troubles. Thus, revealing his true ace at this point would be extremely disadvantageous to him. After all, his later opponents were going to Life-and-Death Kings. One must be prepared for the future and not just focus on what was before them.</p><p>Facing the Young Undying Demon Lord’s punches and palm strikes, Ye Chen neither dodged nor retreated, but suddenly released his sword domain. An enormous sword pressure immediately assaulted Young Undying Demon Lord’s body, rendering him unable to make a single movement. The distance between the two was too short, and thus the brunt of the sword pressure was equally powerful. It was impossible for the other to endure this pressure regardless of how powerful he was.</p><p>Ye Chen slashed the Evil Vanquishing Sword from within Young Undying Demon Lord’s neck.</p><p>Puchi! The latter’s head flew high in the air, spurting blood.</p><p>Ye Chen’s victory!</p><p>“What…Ye Chen killed the Young Undying Demon Lord just like that?”</p><p>In the eyes of spectators, Young Undying Demon Lord’s body had turned stiff and was slashed by Ye Chen like a fool. Since his Undying Body had not reached the peak of limb regeneration realm, he could not live after losing his head. After all, head was not an arm or leg, but the most important part of the human body.</p><p>Retracting his sword domain, Ye Che sheathed his sword back, then turned around and went back to his small chamber.</p><p>All the spectators were stupefied. Ye Chen’s terror simply chilled their hearts. Even Young Undying Demon Lord was killed by like a fool, so how good could the others do before him?</p><p>“What the hell was that ability?” Some people were also considering the situation from all angles.</p><p>“Too strong!”</p><p>Chu Zhongtian sucked in a breath of cold air. He thought that he’d already approached Ye Chen, and might even be able run neck-and-neck. However, at this moment, all of it seemed wishful thinking. Confronting Ye Chen, he didn’t even have fifty percent confidence of victory. It didn’t matter how powerful his defense was, he would lose all the same.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
