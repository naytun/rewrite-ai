If it were placed on the ground, the soil around would become completely devoid of life force; if it were placed near vegetation, the trees and plants would completely wither; if it were dropped in a small river, the entire river would gradually dry out, and the river water would turn into dead water.</p><p>With this Death Qi Iron, Ye Chen had confidence to comprehend a bit more of Death Dao.</p><p>…</p><p>In the boundless starry skies, a light beam was streaking across rapidly. It passed through meteors, many small stars, and finally arrived on a destroyed blazing star. The star was extremely small, with merely a diameter of sixty li. Its whole surface was covered in cracks, oozing lava. It seemed to have suffered heavy damage, giving off a deathly silence.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>The light beam landed on the star, revealing a black-robed man.</p><p>“Yin Sky King, you’ve something for me?”</p><p>As soon as the black-robed man landed on the star, another light beam flew in from the other end of the star, stopping before the black-robed man. It was a yellow-haired old man with an extremely contorted face filled with pockmarks. His two strange eyes were almost white, with merely a hint of black, giving him an extremely sinister appearance.</p><p>“Poison Fire King, seems like your cultivation base has improved again!” The black-robed man smiled.</p><p>Poison Fire King was also a King of Blackwater Alliance.</p><p>Poison Fire King rolled his eyes, “Cultivating for more than thirty years inside the core of a star…If I still didn’t make any progress, I might as well die. But you, Yin Sky King, look quite idle. Well, that’s alright. Your cultivation base has long attained nine hundred years, unlike us. If my cultivation base can exceed five hundred years, I’d also be leisured. I’d look for a few hundred beautiful women and vent.”</p><p>Hearing these words, the black-robed man sneered. ‘You want to look for women here? Even the bones of women on this star are at least a thousand years old!’</p><p>“Is there something wrong for me to look for you?”</p><p>“What is it that you can’t do on your own?” Poison Fire King immediately turned vigilant.</p><p>“I want your help in killing a person.” The black-robed man turned serious.</p><p>“Hahahaha…”</p><p>Hearing these words, Poison Fire King erupted in laughter, which caused the black-robed man to increasingly frown, and even his face sank.</p><p>“My apologies!” Poison Fire King was somewhat apprehensive of the black-robed man, who was Blackwater Alliance’s Yin Sky King—one of the few tycoons of the alliance. He immediately stopped his laughter and asked, “Yin Sky King, don’t blame me. You know my strength is not even one-tenth of yours. If it’s something even you can’t do, how can I do it? Aren’t you sending me to my death?”</p><p>“Even if I’m not your opponent, I’ll not let you send you to my death.”</p><p>Although Poison Fire King was a King of Blackwater Alliance, he was not under Yin Sky King. As an alliance, although some small matters in the alliance could be considered as favours, the big matters were decided by meetings.</p><p>“Who said I’m sending you to your death?” Yin Sky King’s expression eased,”I’m not asking you to kill a King or a Beast King, but a human kid in the third layer of life-and-death-chamber.”</p><p>“That’s even more strange. Why are you looking for me to kill him? You can just go yourself and take care of him easily?” Poison Fire King rolled his eyes, and his face became suspicious.</p><p>“This kid’s strength can’t be looked down upon. He is ranked first on Life and Death Substitute List, and is unrivalled under Life and Death Realm. As for why I’m not going myself, that’s because his backing is the Dragon King and Mysterious Queen. You also know that my actions represent the entire alliance. I can’t act freely on some matters even if there is no danger!”</p><p>Yin Sky King was indeed not afraid of the Dragon King and Mysterious Queen. After all, nobody would be able to tell who killed Ye Chen in Blood Sky Continent. What he was apprehensive of was that peak existence defending Eternal Sky Sect. He’d already thoroughly investigated Eternal Sky Sect and naturally knew some details,</p><p>Having reached such heights, Yin Sky King had always been an extremely cautious person. Although that existence in the Eternal Sky Sect might have already left, he had no intentions of probing himself. If he fell, there was no meaning in anything else.</p><p>“Yin Sky King, if you want me dead, just do it now. You’re telling me to offend Dragon King and Mysterious Queen…You think I can be pushed around?” Poison Sky King turned furious and opened a distance.</p><p>Yin Sky King choked, “Hear me out first! This kid is not in the True Spirit Continent, but in the Blood Sky Continent. Nobody will know you killed him.”</p><p>“Blood Sky Continent?” Poison Fire King thought for a few moments but still shook his head, “I still can’t. This is your matter, so what does it have to do with me? Find someone else!”</p><p>He was still not convinced that this matter didn’t have any danger involved.</p><p>“What about two Infernal Star Crystals? Moreover, he has two million Zhen Yuan crystals of our alliance. I can give you a tenth.” Yin Sky King’s true thoughts were obviously to monopolize the Zhen Yuan crystals and treasures on Ye Chen’s body. In any case, only two people aside from him would know about the crystals—Poison Fire King and his own disciple Wang Taiyi.</p><p>“You have Infernal Star Crystals?” Poison Fire King’s eyes brightened, almost gleaming with greed.</p><p>A single Infernal Star Crystal could increase his cultivation base by ten years. A twenty year increment of cultivation base could save him a bitter cultivation of several years. But, these crystals were extremely rare. Moreover, two hundred thousand Zhen Yuan crystals were nothing to scoff at either. They could increase his cultivation base by at least several years.</p><p>“Of course, I have!” Poison Sky King took out a resplendent fire crystal, which was giving off an illusory, star-like radiance.</p><p>“Infernal Star Crystals, damn it! Why didn’t I find them?” Poison Fire King was itching to snatch it. After thinking for a bit, he said, “I want one fifth of the crystals.”</p><p>“Not possible. One tenth is already a lot.”</p><p>“One sixth.”</p><p>Finally, the two agreed on one eighth.</p><p>“What a greedy fellow!” Yin Sky King couldn’t help but feel a pain in his heart as he was leaving the star.</p><p>The price of Infernal Star Crystals was extremely high. Although he couldn’t use it himself, he could exchange it for treasures suited to himself. Fortunately, he and Poison Fire King came to an agreement. Ye Chen’s pseudo supreme grade sword and armor would belong to him. Two pseudo supreme grade treasures were still quite good for Life and Death Kings.</p><p>As for that supreme grade sword, he couldn’t get Poison Fire King off the sword even if he wanted to. Yin Sky King agreed to give him a fifth of the sword’s worth.</p><p>“Who would have expected somebody will have a supreme grade treasure before reaching Life and Death Realm; it’s an unexpected delight. A pity I can’t take the risk myself.”</p><p>One Poison Fire King was not enough. Using the Sky Scorpio Sword, Ye Chen even defeated Giant Wolf King, Although Poison Fire King was much stronger than Giant Wolf King, he was not enough of an insurance. However, Yin Sky King already had a good candidate in mind. That person was not as greedy as Poison Fire King, and if not for his help, that latter would have been dead long ago.</p><p>Streaking across the sky, Yin Sky King disappeared in the depths of starry sky.</p><p>…</p><p>Ye Chen still didn’t know that one of Blackwater Alliance’s tycoons was sending two Kings after him. Of course, even if he knew, he would not be afraid. Although his own strength was not enough of an insurance, with Yuan Emperor’s painting, even if Yin Sky King came himself, he would only suffer.</p><p>He didn’t know about the wind and storms outside, nor did he want to. He was wholeheartedly immersed in comprehending Death Dao.</p><p>“Death Dao, Death Qi!”</p><p>Swish!</p><p>Observing Death Qi Ore for a few moments, Ye Chen pulled out the Evil Shattering Sword and thrust out. With that, an incorporeal death Qi rippled in the sky, spreading out.</p><p>“Wrong…Not contained enough.”</p><p>If the Death Qi spread out, its destructive power would be small. It must be combined with Congealing Sword and should erupt inside the enemy’s body; only then it would create enough damage.</p><p>“What a pity! If I had the ability to forge a Death Qi sword from this ore, I could have comprehended Death much quicker.” With a supreme grade sword forged from Death Qi Ore, one could slowly comprehend Death Dao amidst all the slaughter.</p><p>…</p><p>“This guy’s masks are pretty good. Seems like I need to learn how to make masks as well, it just takes a bit of time.” Ten thousand li away from Eternal Sky Sect, three figures were shooting forward. The white-faced middle-aged in the middle stroked his face and chuckled.</p><p>“Poison Fire King, Blood Hand King, I’ll wait for you here. Remember the teacher’s words: kill him swiftly, don’t attract attention.” An ugly-faced young man spoke.</p><p>“Stop it! It’s just killing a kid. I alone am enough, much less to say a sneak attack.” Poison Fire King, who had changed his face, curled his lips.</p><p>“I wish you a smooth success.” The ugly-faced young man was Wang Taiyi. Although he was not a Life and Death King, Yin Sky King had asked him to come.</p><p>“Rest assured, my blood profound will instantly kill him.” The other black-faced middle-aged man said coldly.</p><p>“Good, then go on!” Wang Taiyi hid himself in the forest.</p><p>“Let’s go!” Poison Fire King and Blood Hand King pierced the space and disappeared.</p><p>For the past several days, Ye Chen had been forging swords and cultivating sword dao in the rear mountain range of Eternal Sky Sect. Nobody from the sect came to disturb. But at this moment, his brows suddenly creased as a soul power had just swept through the region.</p><p>‘A King grade soul power!’</p><p>A King’s soul power was extremely concealed, and was impossible to be detected under Life and Death Realm. However, as a soul genius, Ye Chen’s soul power was not inferior to a King’s in essence, and thus he could detect it.</p><p>‘Again…There are two this time!’ Ye Chen’s expression gravened. However, on surface, he nonchalantly continued to forge swords.</p><p>‘Who is trying to kill me?’ Ye Chen guessed inwardly. ‘Is it because of the Sky Scorpio Sword?’</p><p>Ye Chen’s first thought was that some Kings had come to kill him and snatch his Sky Scorpio Sword away. However, reasonably speaking, there hadn’t been a single person who was audacious enough to brazenly loot inside Eternal Sky Sect for many years. This was because a titled Monarch had declared a few hundred years ago that an invasion of Eternal Sky Sect was prohibited.</p><p>All Life and Death Kings and Beast Kings naturally knew that.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
