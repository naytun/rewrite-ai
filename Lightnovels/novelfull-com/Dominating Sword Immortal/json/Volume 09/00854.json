The palace had already been opened, covered in interweaving black and white energies. With his action, a gap immediately opened in the energies where the medal latched.</p><p>“Let’s go!” Ye Chen’s body flickered as he entered the palace.</p><p>“This Ye Chen…I’m afraid he is going to shock the entire world.” Although Qin Tianxiong didn’t know where Ye Chen obtained his medal, there was no need for much speculation. One could only obtain a life-and-death medal through two methods: team up and kill a peak level evil spirit, or do it solo. In this case, the chances for the former were not high, for coming across one’s acquaintances was not so easy in Life-and-Death realm.</p><p>As soon as they entered the palace, a dozen sharp gazes immediately landed on Ye Chen’s body. These gazes belonged to the elites among elites, and were as piercing as a sword. Even Ye Chen couldn’t shrug it off as nothing. As for Qin Tianxiong, his body shook, almost on the verge of tears.</p><p>“Ye Chen!”</p><p>“Ye Chen, you’re finally here!”</p><p>“Long time no see, Ye Chen!”</p><p>“Junior Brother, Ye Chen!”</p><p>Ye Chen seemed like a super celebrity, immediately becoming the attention of everybody. As one of the seven True Spirit Heroes, Qin Tianxiong was also someone with quite a bit of fame. However, at this moment, he’d been relegated to a supporting character standing behind Ye Chen, and almost nobody paid attention to him.</p><p>“Who is this guy? Seems like someone to be watched.”</p><p>“Strange! How can a newcomer get such a welcome?”</p><p>All the other sides except True Spirit Continent’s were quite puzzled. Marquis Sword Realm, Marquis Giant Sword, and Marquis Short Sword’s complexion sank upon seeing Ye Chen’s arrival. A cold light flickered in Marquis Sword Realm’s eyes while the latter two’s face turned a bit anxious. They had personally witnessed Ye Chen’s strength. Thus, they didn’t find the attention Ye Chen received strange at all. After all, with his battle strength, he couldn’t not have fame.</p><p>“Oh right, since he came late, he couldn’t have gotten the medal here. Don’t tell me has the strength to kill a peak level evil spirit by himself?”</p><p>“Impossible! He most likely had a group. Don’t you see another person with him?”</p><p>“Right, they must have been more initially, but the rest died in the hunt.”</p><p>Almost nobody believed that Ye Chen had the strength to kill a peak level evil spirit, or they were not willing to believe iy. Thus, they all made their own speculations to rationalize this situation.</p><p>The voices coming from ahead didn’t cause a change on Ye Chen’s face. However, the one last soft voice caused his heart to jump. His gaze passed through the group and landed on a beautiful woman who exuded a peaceful aura.</p><p>Xu Jing!</p><p>After so many years, the two had eventually met again.</p><p>Xu Jing’s gaze met Ye Chen’s. Unlike before, her gaze no longer had that slight aggressiveness; it only had gentleness and delight. With a smile on his face, Ye Chen walked over to her.</p><p>“Senior Sister, Xu Jing!” Ye Chen still called her senior sister by habit, representing that he hadn’t changed. Without waiting for any response from her, he suddenly embraced, holding her soft and slender. Xu Jing blinked as a faint blush appeared on her face.</p><p>This…!</p><p>Everybody inside the palace was stupefied. It took them quite a while to comprehend the situation. This beauty was actually Ye Chen’s woman! This made many of them disappointed.</p><p>Young Elephant Lord snorted coldly. Although this was his first time seeing Xu Jing, he had already considered her as his woman in his heart. Seeing Ye Chen hugging her, he felt a pang in his heart.</p><p>“Yan Fengfeng, is this Ye Chen’s real girlfriend? I heard that he had a demonic human girlfriend before?” Ji Hairou asked Yan Fengfeng.</p><p>Yan Fengfeng spoke with confidence, “He might have two girlfriends!” She had not seen Xu Jing before either as the latter had already been taken to the Dragon God Celestial Palace. Only those in South Rudra Region were clear about these matters.</p><p>“Oh, how lucky of him!”</p><p>“You aren’t having thoughts on Ye Chen, are you? Don’t even think of letting down Senior Brother Feng Piaoling.”</p><p>“What nonsense are you spouting!”</p><p>…</p><p>Holding Xu Jing in his embrace, Ye Chen discovered that his longing for her was true. The two had been acquainted much earlier than Murong Qingcheng, and apart from the latter, she was the person who understood him the most.</p><p>Letting out a fragrant breath, she softly said, “Junior Brother Ye, I thought you might have forgotten me.”</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>With the passage of time, their longing for each other had only increased. Previously, the two were still somewhat reserved, neither one of them overstepping their boundaries at all. However, at this moment, it had developed like flowing water, seeming completely natural.</p><p>Ye Chen let go of Xu Jing before carefully sizing her up.</p><p>After not seeing her for so many years, she had not changed much. Her forehead exuded a feminine valor which had not been present before. However, what made Ye Chen feel strange was that the strength inside her body seemed a bit distinct, not seeming like strength refined from a human body. It did seem more like that of a beast, but was still quite different. As the two were close, the dragon power inside Ye Chen’s body was turning restless.</p><p>Xu Jing seemed to have felt that Ye Chen had seen through something, “Junior Brother Ye, I’m actually not a human!”</p><p>“I could guess a bit.”</p><p>Ye Chen had heard Xu Jing recalling her past. Her earliest memories began from ten years of age, and it was completely blank before that. Afterward, Dragon King had told him some matters about Xu Jing. Adding onto her current changes, he could figure out some things.</p><p>“I’m from the dragon race!” Xu Jing revealed her secret to Ye Chen.</p><p>“Dragon Race?” Ye Chen’s heart jumped, “Then, the strength in your body is…Dragon Force?”</p><p>No wonder Ye Chen felt the dragon power inside him turning restless. Dragon Power was also known as Sub Dragon Power, and was inferior to Dragon Force. The latter was pure energy of a dragon, which was different from Dragon Power, and was at a higher level.</p><p>“Yeah, I’m a Golden Dragon from the dragon race, and the strength I cultivate is the Golden Dragon Force. Due to special circumstances, I immediately assumed human form after I was born. Then, I was dormant for ten years before being finally found by my foster parents. Afterward, I led a normal life like other humans…” Xu Jing spoke actively.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter if you’re a human or golden dragon, as long as you’re still the same Senior Sister Xu Jing.” Ye Chen’s heart didn’t have a trace of rejection.</p><p>Bang!!</p><p>Everybody was in a huge chamber; length, width, and height all surpassing a thousand meters. Across them, a stone stele suddenly dropped down. On the stelle were thirty-six names, containing many names that were currently present. However, the order of their names was different from their ranking.</p><p>“This is the previous Life and Death Substitute List.” Someone immediately blurted out.</p><p>On the stelle, the first and second names didn’t belong to anybody present. Marquis Star Sword was ranked third, Luo Tiandu fourth, Young Elephant Lord fifth, Marquis Sword Realm sixth, Undying Demon Lord seventh, Young Snake ninth, and then the ranks of the rest. The names that were not present on the scene were dim and without any luster.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>At that moment, another stelle dropped down, this time completely blank.</p><p>Everybody was well-aware of Life-and-Death Secret Realm’s working, and knew what was special about this stelle. As long as they put their own name on it, the stelle would rank the name according to one’s vital Qi. Of course, it held no meaning for the first person to put their name. However, once the subsequent names were put down, the stelle would adjust its ranking accordingly.</p><p>The first person to move forth and write his name was a marine expert. However, following the second person and third person, his name was relegated to the bottom, indicating that his vital Qi was the lowest. As far as Ye Chen knew, the ranking was based on cultivation base realm and body’s vitality. For example, among two humans, the one with higher cultivation base would usually have more vital Qi. Similarly, between a human and a beast, the latter would usually have higher vital Qi.</p><p>Soon, more than ten of them had already left their names on the stelle.</p><p>“Let me try.” Ye Chen walked forth and carved his own name on the stelle with his finger.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>Ye Chen, the two words, immediately occupied the top spot.</p><p>“Eh, such a high vital Qi! The previous ten names even have second layer beasts, and yet his vital Qi is actually above theirs.” Many couldn’t hide their surprise.</p><p>Linghu Yi also went ahead and wrote his name, but it didn’t even reach the top three. After all, he was neither a demonic beast, nor had the advantage of realm.</p><p>Subsequently, apart from Undying Demon Lord, Marquis Star Sword, and Chu Zhongtian, almost all the humans had written their names. However, the first place still belonged to Ye Chen. This left many puzzled. It should be known that Luo Tiandu and Tie Kuangzun were both third layer experts, and all of them were humans. So, how could Ye Chen be the one with the highest vital Qi?</p><p>“This Ye Chen…I’m afraid is not so simple.” Luo Tiandu said inwardly.</p><p>“Damn it! His vital Qi is actually so much higher than mine.” Wang Taiyi was unresigned. Originally, he believed that he could kill Ye Chen as easily as swatting a fly. But seeing the present situation, he was unable to accept it.</p><p>“Humph! He must have cultivated some life saving trick, causing his vital Qi to soar. However, vital Qi is by no means an indication of battle power.” Wang Taiyi couldn’t forget the Zhen Yuan crystals with Ye Chen. That wealth belonged to Blackwater Alliance.</p><p>“Marquis Star Sword is going. Based on his cultivation base, he’ll probably be the first.” Under everybody’s gaze, Marquis Star Sword wrote his name.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>Ranked two!</p><p>He was also incapable of surpassing Ye Chen.</p><p>“Interesting!”</p><p>Marquis Star Sword’s face showed no anger, and a slight calm smile appeared on his face instead.</p><p>Yan Fengfeng was ranked third, and Princess Godshark ranked fifth. All of the young experts went ahead and wrote their names. However, so far, none of them could bring down Ye Chen’s name.</p><p>“Haha, let me try!” Dugu Jue and Tantai Mingyue’s rankings were nothing special, but as the possessor of Astral Spirit Body, Chu Zhongtian had yet to try.</p><p>This time, Ye Chen’s name was almost brought down. Chu Zhongtian’s vital Qi was indeed exceptional and almost displaced the other’s name many times. However, Ye Chen’s name was far more tenacious, never moving from its position.</p><p>Young Snake Lord had already recovered. He coldly snorted, believing he would easily reach the first at this moment, and his final ranking would be third. After all, his cultivation base was not lacking compared to anybody. Moreover, he also had the bloodline of the Nine Headed Snake.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
