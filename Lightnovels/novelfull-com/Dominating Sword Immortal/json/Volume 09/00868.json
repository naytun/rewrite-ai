If somebody had opened a vertical eye, their body could be considered to have certainly undergone some transformation; for example, an extreme talent in some aspect had aroused an innate skill in them.</p><p>“A soul skill? Soul Eye!” Somebody shouted.</p><p>A person who had opened a vertical eye must have a frightening talent in soul. However, the converse was not true. This was because the chances of opening Soul Eye was too small, so small that it could be ignored. The reason for this was still not known to anybody.</p><p>It was rumored that opening the Soul Eye gave one the power of passing on the power of their body. Their descendants would more or less receive their ancestor’s power. Of course, the difficulty of opening Soul Eye would still be extremely high for descendants, but they would have a high talent for soul.</p><p>One could say that Ye Chen’s descendants would be quite well off. Their starting point would be higher than others, and it would be easier for them to have greater achievements.</p><p>“A truly powerful innate skill…Once he reaches Life and Death Realm, his position will be instantly above ordinary Life and Death Kings, and his words will have more weight too.”</p><p>All the spectators were elites among elites and had high discerning powers. They had high ambitions, and their goal was naturally to become a Life and Death King, becoming a part of the influential figures of the True Spirit World. However, they all were vaguely aware that Life and Death Realm was yet another beginning. Of the thousand years, or a few thousand years, or even a hundred thousand years, one would only spend about a hundred to become a Life and Death King. But in the remaining nine hundred years, one might not be able to reach the peak of Life and Death King.</p><p>How long were nine hundred years? It would be enough for one to have a dozen generations.</p><p>‘This is the Soul Eye of the legends?’ In the small chamber, Marquis Sword Snow’s eyes were grave as the pressure brought to him was too large. Ye Chen was not weaker than him in any aspect while being actually much stronger in the aspect of soul. ‘Let’s see who wins after reaching the Life and Death Realm!’</p><p>Upon defeating Marquis Sword Snow, Ye Chen had undoubtedly become the number one young sword artist of True Spirit World. His next target was the Life and Death Realm, and his opponents would similarly be Life and Death Kings as well as Beast Kings. Hereon, age no longer mattered, because his opponents would be hundreds or thousands of years old monsters.</p><p>Soon, the thirty-third round concluded, and the thirty-fourth round, which was also the second-last round, began. In this round, Xu Jing and Marquis Sword Snow inevitably met.</p><p>It was still not easy to say who was the stronger amongst the two. Marquis Sword Snow had his sword domain, which could suppress his opponents. However, it depended who the opponent was. Against Xu Jing, who even dared to grab Marquis Sword Star’s fifth strike, how effective would it be? That was yet to be seen. Moreover, Xu Jing’s Poison Dragon Fist had an unparalleled might. If it hit Marquis Sword Snow, he would die undoubtedly.</p><p>On the battle stage, Marquis Sword Snow had all his attention focused on Xu Jing. He could disregard anybody; he had some confidence even against Ye Chen before. However, he truly had no confidence against Xu Jing; he would never lie to himself.</p><p>“Snow Dance!” Marquis Snow Sword launched the first attack, probing Xu Jing, and a sky-covering snow immediately surrounded her. In response, the latter rotated both her hands, creating a huge golden whirlpool before her. The snowflakes were irresistibly devoured inside the whirlpool, then disintegrated with muffled explosions.</p><p>“Star Shattering Fist!”</p><p>Scattering the golden whirlpool, Xu Jing stepped out and charged forth in a light beam. At the same time, the sky darkened and stars flickered before one star shattered right before Marquis Sword Snow.</p><p>“Sword Domain!”</p><p>At that moment, an enormous sword pressure radiated out from Marquis Sword Snow, seemingly freezing space itself and making it much stiffer. Xu Jing’s attack immediately set off a spatial ripple as it entered the sword domain. Like a fish swimming against opposite currents, it faced an enormous resistance.</p><p>By relying on Sword Domain’s suppressive power, Marquis Sword Snow raised his white longsword and issued three consecutive sword strikes.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The energy explosion caused a huge wave of gale, sweeping across.</p><p>“Freezing Sword Point!”</p><p>With the Sword Domain, Marquis Sword Snow could disregard the shockwaves from the explosion and shot toward Xu Jing. En-route, his white longsword abruptly thrust forth like a viper.</p><p>After the probing came the ace.</p><p>“Is she going to grab it again?” Someone couldn’t help but ask.</p><p>Ye Chen didn’t know what others were thinking, but he knew that Xu Jing would not grab Marquis Sword Snow’s Freezing Sword Point, which contained a powerful compressed cold Qi. Once this Qi erupted, it would be enough to freeze everything over. Even if she didn’t truly froze, as long as her body turned momentarily stiff, Marquis Sword Snow could easily grab the chance.</p><p>As he expected, Xu Jing didn’t reach out with her hand.</p><p>She stamped her foot, creating a hundred centimeters deep hole in the ground. It should be known that the ground of Life and Death Palace was extremely hard, and the previous battles had merely left a few shallows marks on the ground. Hereby, it could be seen how much strength was behind her stamp.</p><p>Her entire being leapt back. The shockwave was also helping her, causing her speed to further increase. In the air, a golden gleam appeared on her fist.</p><p>“Sacred Dragon Fist, second step!” With her punch, a huge dragon cry resounded, and an enormous golden dragon spiraled out.</p><p>Creak…</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The Freezing Sword and the golden dragon collided, causing a frightening sword Qi hurricane to swirl off while exuding a chill that directly froze the ground and created a meter-deep ice layer. However, the sword Qi hurricane was not nearly enough, as the golden dragon pierced straight through and pounced at Marquis Sword Snow.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>Marquis Sword Snow was instantly turned into blood mist, and his white longsword as well as armor were carried straight back to his small chamber.</p><p>Xu Jing’s victory!</p><p>“Too frightening!”</p><p>Everybody was stunned by Xu Jing’s strength. If even Marquis Sword Snow was unable to block her ace, who could?</p><p>“This girlfriend of Ye Chen is too extraordinary!” As a phoenix, Yan Fengfeng also had a frightening potential, but she was still unable to match the peak geniuses of True Spirit Continent. Although her realm was still lower, if she were at the peak of the third layer, she might still be able to match Young Elephant Lord. However, she would not be able to match Marquis Sword Snow and Ye Chen, not to mention that Xu Jing was also at the second layer like Ye Chen.</p><p>If she had an ordinary beast bloodline in her body, there was no way she could have such a frightening battle strength.</p><p>“Now, there is only the match between Ye Chen and Xu Jing left.” Somebody spoke using soul power.</p><p>“They are lovers. Will they even care about the match? It will be more like a ‘you win’ tussle!” Somebody replied.</p><p>The thirty-fifth round was the final round, and without any suspense, Ye Chen and Xu Jing met.</p><p>Ye Chen spoke with his hand on his chin, “I can’t beat you.” What he said was true, but also not true. Between Bewitching Mirror Shattering and Sacred Dragon Fist, it was not easy to tell which was stronger. The most likely outcome would be both perishing together. Against somebody else, he might have been tempted to test it out, but against Xu Jing, there was no need. Be it three life-and-death stones or two, both meant the same to him, since they could only take him to the third layer of life-and-death chamber.</p><p>The responsibilities on Xu Jing’s shoulder should be much bigger than him. Dragon King only had a few years of lifespan remaining. After his death, the entire Celestial Dragon God Palace would have to rely on her. The pressure on her could be well imagined.</p><p>“Come back and return to the True Spirit Continent soon.” However, Xu Jing was much more disregarding of the Life and Death Substitute List’s first rank, as she raised her hand and punched her own heart. In the next moment, her body dulled, reappearing in her small chamber.</p><p>Her action obviously stunned Ye Chen. After a long while, he deeply sighed and emotionally gazed at her small chamber, ‘Wait for me! I’ll be back as a Life and Death King.”</p><p>Seeing this scene, many people felt extremely jealous of Ye Chen. Why couldn’t they meet such a girlfriend?</p><p>“So touching!”</p><p>Ji Hairuo knew some things about Ye Chen, and knew that he was basically forced out of True Spirit Continent. Xu Jing evidently knew his situation as well, and thus directly gave up on the first place so that he could have one more life-and-death stone. Although one more stone couldn’t let him attain the peak of the third layer, it could at least allow him to save some time.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>Following the conclusion of the last battle, the names on the stelle began to change.</p><p>First name, Ye Chen.</p><p>Second name, Xu Jing.</p><p>Third name, Marquis Sword Snow.</p><p>Fourth name, Marquis Sword Star.</p><p>Fifth name, Lashan Mei.</p><p>Sixth name, Young Elephant Lord; seventh name, Lu Tiandu; eighth name, Young Undying Demon Lord; ninth name, Tantai Mingyue…</p><p>Dugu Jue was twelfth, Chu Zhongtian was thirteenth, and Yan Fengfeng was seventeenth.</p><p>Even though Tantai Mingyue had a teleportation art, her opponents mattered even more. She lost to Xu Jing because the latter was even stronger than Young Elephant Lord and could directly warp the spatial ripples. She lost to Marquis Sword Star because the latter was only a step away from Life-and-Death Realm. In her battle with Lashan Mei, she surprisingly almost won, but in the final moments, Lashan Mei’s Annihilation Chop wiped her off due to its frightening vibrational power, since vibrational power could be transmitted through space. By relying on the Nine Dragon Body Guard, Lu Tiandu grinded her to death. Lastly, the Young Undying Demon Lord had an undying body; moreover, his Chaotic Demon Fist could seal off a large area.</p><p>Therefore, Tantai Mingyue could only rank ninth, but she was a threatening figure to the greater majority.</p><p>The names on the stelle no longer flickered, becoming fixed at their places. The top ten names received their individual rewards; Life and death stones suddenly appeared before them and entered their bodies on their own. As the first ranked, Ye Chen received three stones, Xu Jing and Marquis Sword Snow received two stones each, and the rest up to the tenth place all received one stone each.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
