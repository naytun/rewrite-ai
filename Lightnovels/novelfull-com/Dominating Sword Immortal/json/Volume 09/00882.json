Ye Chen was certainly not his opponent, and he could only escape upon encountering it. After all, Soul Light would be completely useless on a Hetero Blood Demon King. His soul was already in complete chaos and would not experience dizziness, unless the Soul Light could directly obliterate his soul.</p><p>However, this time, Hetero Blood Demon King’s opponents were not weak either. The spear wielding human king had about the same strength as Poison Fire King, while the beast Monkey King seemed weaker, but not by much. Working together, they were suppressing the Hetero Blood Demon King.</p><p>“Anicca Soul Seeking Spear!” The long-bearded man roared and thrust out, with the spear strangely spiraling and piercing the head of Hetero Blood Demon King. It seemed tightly stuck in there.</p><p>“Break for me!”</p><p>The beast Monkey King’s body was not big, merely three meters in height, but he was quite nimble. With a flicker, he appeared behind Hetero Blood Demon King and clawed down.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The Hetero Blood Demon King’s body exploded apart, spouting blood everywhere.</p><p>“Haha, Monkey, well done!” The long-bearded man retracted his spear.</p><p>The beast Monkey King transformed into his human avatar and smiled, “We are good together.”</p><p>The human and the beast had cooperated together innumerable times and long developed a tacit understanding. Joining hands, they could fight opponents far stronger than them.</p><p>“Such superb spear arts, incorporating both wind profound and clouds profound…Both these profounds are the most transformative. When fused, the resulting might will not be as high as the fusion of other profounds, but it will be almost impossible to defend against.”</p><p>Back in the day, Ye Chen had also comprehended the cloud intent, from which he later derived the thunder intent. However, his energy was limited. He could only choose the best option for him and leave the rest for later. Of course, after so many years, his cloud intent had ascended into cloud profound at ten percent completion.</p><p>Closing his Soul Eye, Ye Chen turned around and left.</p><p>…</p><p>Bloodlight Ocean was boundless, and the space inside it was far beyond what was visible outside. Time passed by, and Ye Chen unwittingly spent three days in Bloodlight Ocean. During this period, he could clearly feel a chaotic will trying and probing to assault his Sea of Soul. The soul membrane could only defend against soul power, but it was helpless against a will assault.</p><p>Fortunately, his Sea of Soul contained both the Destruction Sword Intent and Immortal Sword Intent. With two great fifth step sword intents defending his Sea of Soul, the assaulting will disintegrated into nothingness as soon as it entered his Sea of Soul.</p><p>Ye Chen didn’t care about the chaotic will at all. During these three days, he encountered true danger twice. One time, he fell into an encirclement of thousands of Blood Demon Generals, and the other time, he ran into a wandering Hetero Blood Demon King, whose strength was even a bit above the one he’d seen three days ago.</p><p>Confronting the encirclement of thousands of Blood Demon Generals, Ye Chen had to spend every means at his disposal, costing him one-third of his Zhen Yuan, to kill half of them and flee. And before the Hetero Blood Demon King, Ye Chen escaped without a second thought.</p><p>One on one, he had no chance against that Hetero Blood Demon King. If he tried to engage it, he would only waste Zhen Yuan. Anyhow, his purpose in coming here was the Blood Crystal Flower, and not battling experience.</p><p>“Bloodlight Ocean’s space is extremely firm, making Kings incapable of travelling through space. Otherwise, I would have no chance of escaping.” En-route, Ye Chen kept his soul power detection for the time being. “But, this won’t do. To leave this place, I will need to reach Life and Death Realm, or I’ll die nine times out of ten…It might even be a certain death.”</p><p>One must be alive in order to make use of opportunities. If the danger was too high, one might simply die without a choice.</p><p>“Oh, a mountain range!” Ye Chen halted. In his soul perception was a mountain range twenty li ahead of him.</p><p>Bloodlight Ocean rarely had mountains, as the ground was mostly plain, along with small hills. The Flower Crystal Flowers usually grew in mountain ranges. It might be underground in the mountain range, on the summits, or in the lakes inside the mountain range. It could grow anywhere in the mountain range; there was no set environment for its growth.</p><p>“Since I’ve found a mountain range, it must have a Blood Crystal Flower as well. Alright!” Expelling all distracting thoughts from his mind, Ye Chen’s eyes sharpened as he cautiously headed to the mountain range. Since his soul power could only cover a few dozen li, he had no idea how big the mountain range was. ‘No matter what is inside, I can only advance step-by-step.’</p><p>Ye Chen entered a ravine covered by steep mountains. From inside, the sky seemed like a dark and quiet string.</p><p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p><p>Having walked for seven-eight li, Ye Chen was suddenly swarmed by dozens of blood light beams.</p><p>“Sword Domain!”</p><p>Seeing death right before his eyes, Ye Chen released Sword Domain without a moment of panic. The enormous sword pressure caused a steep decline in the speed of blood rays. Meanwhile, after pulling out the Evil Shattering Sword, Ye Chen slashed repeatedly. Powerful Qi ripped the blood rays apart while the Destruction Sword Intent within rendered the separated blood lights incapable of condensing again.</p><p>“Je Je!”</p><p>However, the true threat arrived when the blood gales condensed into a Blood Demon King. Its two arms were as slender as bamboo sticks while its two palms were like sharp eagle claws.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>Following the sound of air being pierced, Blood Demon King’s arms rapidly stretched out while thinning at the same time and drilled at Ye Chen’s forehead like a driller, looking like a blood-colored lightning.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>Raising the Evil Shattering Sword, Ye Chen resisted Blood Demon King’s explosive attack. However, the real terror lay in its ability to seamlessly change its shape. After being repelled, its arm again lengthened, changing into a string and coiling around Ye Chen.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Ye Chen didn’t dare be neglectful in the slightest and immediately used Bewitching Mirror Shattering, confining the red string within the mirror condensed from spatial power and then shattering it into a million pieces.</p><p>“Congealing Water!”</p><p>With his entire being acting like sword light, Ye Chen shot forth and thrust out.</p><p>The Blood Demon King sneered, not giving any credit to Ye Chen’s sword. Its body transformed yet again, turning into a blood-colored hedgehog with each of its spikes several hundred meters long, covering the entire range of Ye Chen’s assault.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>However, Ye Chen’s Congealing Water was a step closer. It landed on Blood Demon King’s body, transmitting a power that instantly shredded its body while the sword intent containing Death Qi instantly obliterated the Blood Demon King’s vitality.</p><p>“A basic Blood Demon King can’t face my Congealing Water head on.”</p><p>Ye Chen had an innate superiority over Blood Demon Kings. Firstly, his Evil Shattering Sword contained evil vanquishing powers, innately suppressing fiends. Secondly, Ye Chen’s fifth step Destruction Sword Intent was a deadly tool against Blood Demons; it directly prevented them from recondensing again, unless the Blood Demon was a mid or high level Blood Demon King. Thirdly, Ye Chen had comprehended death the Dao. In this aspect, he was no weaker than ordinary Life and Death Kings.</p><p>Combining all these advantages, even a King stronger than Ye Chen might not have killed the Blood Demon King with such ease.</p><p>Putong!</p><p>As soon as the Blood Demon King, a blood-colored crystal fell on the ground.</p><p>“Blood Demon Crystal!” Ye Cheh extended his hand, causing the Blood Flower Crystal to fly toward him.</p><p>Blood Demon Crystal was also a supreme grade material that could only be nurtured inside a Blood Demon King’s body. When inside a Blood Demon King’s body, it had no substance and could scatter away at any moment along with the Blood Demon King. However, once the Blood Demon King died, it could not scatter away and gain substance.</p><p>As a supreme grade material, it was quite useful. It could vitalize the body, replenish blood Qi, strengthen spirit body, and even be used in treasure forging. A weapon containing Blood Demon Crystal could steal the opponent’s blood Qi energies and replenish one’s own, making the weapon sinister and tyrannical.</p><p>One shouldn’t be fooled by the fact that Life and Death Kings had Undying Bodies. Their flesh and bones were fused with Zhen Yuan, but one couldn’t use the Undying Body too many times before attaining Flesh Derivation Realm. Otherwise, the body simply wouldn’t hold up. The reason was that at this point of time, the body was the more dominant one rather than Zhen Yuan. Therefore, Blood Demon Crystal had great significance for a King in the limb regrowth realm. Of course, even if one reached the blood derivation realm, it was still not bad. After all, there was nobody who wouldn’t want to strengthen their spirit bodies. Finally, even if one felt that a common Blood Demon Crystal could no longer strengthen his spirit body, he could still treat it as a forging material and forge a treasure out of it.</p><p>In short, this crystal was the hottest among the low level commodities sought by Kings. The price of a single Blood Demon Crystal was no less than a high-end semi supreme grade treasure. Meanwhile, a mid step Blood Demon Crystal’s value rivalled that of pseudo supreme grade treasures, and high step Blood Demon Crystals were equivalent to supreme grade treasures.</p><p>Blood Demon Crystal was also one of the reason experts came to this forbidden zone. Even if they couldn’t find a Blood Crystal Flower, if they lucked on and ran into a low level Blood Demon King, they would have still made a decent haul, although it was not as good as finding a Blood Crystal Flower.</p><p>Of course, to have something, one must pay a price. Ordinary Kings couldn’t kill low level Blood Demon Kings without facing an element of danger, unlike Ye Chen who had the Evil Shattering Sword, Destruction Sword Intent, and Immortal Sword Intent. Otherwise, the number of Kings falling to Blood Demon Kings would have significantly dropped. As for peak Kings and titled monarchs, they didn’t care about low step and mid step Blood Demon Crystals. Rather than coming to Bloodlight Ocean, they might as well go to better zones with better treasures.</p><p>Of course, some might come for the sake of their disciples or descendants. But, the chance of meeting them during such a trip was so small that it might never happen for centuries.</p><p>Obtaining the Blood Demon Crystal, Ye Chen left the ravine and found himself a safe spot, then immediately began refining it to strengthen his spirit body.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
