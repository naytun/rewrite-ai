However, he also didn’t dare to look down on Xu Jing. Every head of the nine-headed snake had a unique ability, and the long-horned head that was just cut off was the one with the greatest strength. None of the strength experts in Blood Sky Continent would look down upon long-horned head’s strike except for the Young Elephant Lord. However, it couldn’t even handle a casual palm from Xu Jing. One could imagine how frightening this woman’s strength was.</p><p>“Wind Rain Ice Thunder!” Young Snake Lord roared as four of the nine illusory heads stretched out, spouting wing blades, water spheres, lightning, as well frost ice. Confronting four completely different powers, even an expert of the third layer would opt to retreat, not daring to confront it head-on.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>But, Golden flames erupted from Xu Jing’s body in response and her hair fluttered as she punched forth. As a result, space shook and shattered into several narrow dark tunnels. With a burst of powerful explosion, the four powers swirled backward.</p><p>“Such strength!”</p><p>Numerous sighs and exclamations erupted on the side of Blood Sky Continent while the Young Elephant Lord’s eyes shone. He was different from the Young Snake Lord. The battle elephant bloodline in his body had already activated, no different from the battle elephant from the ancient times at this point. With his innate strength, a single punch of his surpassed a million jin. As a result, Xu Jing’s strength made his blood boil.</p><p>“My Battle Elephant Clan reveres strength…strength is everything. This woman’s strength is nothing to scoff at. Moreover, she also seems to be of the beast race.” Young Elephant Lord’s thoughts stirred and his gaze on Xu Jing turned slightly intensified.</p><p>“Let me see how you will block this!”</p><p>Young Snake Lord was caught in a difficult situation, and somewhat regretted provoking Xu Jing. But, once one rode a tiger, it’d be hard to get off. Since he’d already made his move, he couldn’t leave halfway, or it would seem like he was scared of her.</p><p>His entire body leaped up, and he launched a fierce assault at Xu Jing. Each of the nine illusory heads at his back waved, twisting the space. Each of the nine of heads had a unique ability like ramming, spouting different kinds of attributed powers, and swallowing, arousing powerful attractive and restrictive forces.</p><p>Nine-headed Snake was a beast ranked at the front among the ancient beasts. Although Young Snake Lord only had half of the nine-headed snake’s bloodline, belonging to perfect half beasts, his comprehension was far above beasts. This made his battle power no weaker than the great powerful beasts’. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to contend against Young Elephant Lord, only falling a bit short.</p><p>Peng Peng Peng!</p><p>The golden flames surrounding Xu Jing’s body was a phenomenon created by strength being pushed to the extreme. Not only was her every punch and kick brimming with boundless strength, they were also quick as lightning. The assault of Young Snake Lord had no chance of getting past her defense. On the contrary, the former was being pushed back, and even his footing had turned unstable.</p><p>“Too powerful!”</p><p>The surrounding spectators had their mouth wide-opened. Who was Young Snake Lord? He was ranked seventh on the Life and Death Substitute List! One could even say that only a handful of people surpassed him. Meanwhile, Xu Jing was clearly a newcomer who looked about twenty-years old. But, she could actually suppress Young Snake Lord!</p><p>“It’s my turn!” Golden Flames erupted forth as Xu Jing punched at Young Snake Lord. The sky darkened that very moment, and flickering stars appeared. In the starry river, one of stars shattered, and its position was directly before Young Snake Lord.</p><p>“Hold!”</p><p>Young Snake Lord’s eyelids frantically jumped; this was the omen of danger for him. His crossed his arms, raising them before his chest and head. At the same time, the nine illusory snake heads interweaved, protecting his body and creating a huge protective barrier.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>This fist art seemed too tyrannous as it shattered one snake head after another, finally smashing into Protective Zhen Yuan outside Young Snake Lord and instantly destroying it. Young Snake Lord felt an earth-shattering power coming from his two arms, which was far beyond his endurance. How could he hold? With his feet sliding on the ground, his figure shot back.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>Going back more than ten li, Young Snake Lord spurted out a mouthful of blood, and his face turned into a shade of dim golden color.</p><p>The Young Snake Lord had been defeated!</p><p>Wang Taiyi felt his scalp going numb. He rejoiced at his decision of not provoking this woman inwardly. Otherwise, he had no chance against this last attack from Xu Jing. After all, he was far lacking compared to Young Snake Lord.</p><p>Upon defeating Young Snake Lord, Xu Jing immediately flew toward True Spirit Continent’s side.</p><p>“She is from True Spirit Continent?” Luo Tiandu was astonished. Dugu Jue, Chu Zhongtian, and the rest also frowned.</p><p>When did True Spirit Continent produce one more monstrous genius? Moreover, she seemed more powerful than anybody else. At the very least, Dugu Jue and Chu Jongtian had no confidence in going against her.</p><p>“Haha, Luo Tiandu, your True Spirit Continent is pretty good! Such a strong newcomer…But, it seems like you don’t know her?” Young Elephant Lord was slightly astonished upon seeing Xu Jing defeating Young Snake Lord. However, he had confidence that he, who had activated his bloodline, would not be defeated by anybody, including Lu Tiandu.</p><p>The latter indifferently smiled,” Oh, you’ll be seeing many more if you’re lucky. My True Spirit Continent has no shortage of new talent.”</p><p>“Is that so? Then I’ll be waiting.”</p><p>Young Elephant Lord didn’t care much about Lu Tiandu’s words. Could every newcomer from True Spirit Continent be as powerful as Young Snake Lord? Was he joking?</p><p>On the side of Sword Sky Continent, the spruce young said with a faint smile, “Life and Death Palace will open in a moment. One life-and-death medal will only allow four people to enter. Let’s discuss the distribution beforehand to prevent conflicts later.”</p><p>It was almost impossible to kill a peak level evil spirit alone. Thus, it was imperative to form groups. Usually, peak level evil spirits appeared before the opening of Life-and-Death Palace, and participants would be able to get their hands on life-and-death medals.</p><p>“Xing Jianhou, why don’t you say how the distribution shall be done?” Young Elephant asked back.</p><p>Xing Jianhou was rank one on Life and Death Substitute List, and also the head of the ten great sword artists of Sword Sky Continent. His strength was immeasurably deep, and he was also the young expert that Young Elephant Lord was the most apprehensive of.</p><p>Xing Jianhou said, “Let’s do it like this…We three continents form one group each, and the marine experts could form one group, forming a total of four groups. The four groups will take turns. Let’s start with True Spirit Continent, alright?”</p><p>“Fine, I have no problems.” Luo Tiandu nodded faintly.</p><p>“I don’t have any problem either.” It didn’t matter who went first or who went last, so the Young Elephant consented with a faint nod.</p><p>The four groups held their territories, calmly waiting.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>A spatial ripple suddenly appeared on the plaza, and a long-horned human-shaped evil spirit appeared floating in the air.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The human-shaped evil spirit roared at the heavens, emitting a terrifyingly sinister aura in every direction. Be it Xing Jianhou, Young Elephant Lord, or Luo Tiandu, all of them felt an immense pressure. If Liu Wujian were here, he would have immediately recognized that this was the same evil spirit that had killed him. At this moment, it had been shockingly transported from so far away, appearing before the Life-and-Death Palace.</p><p>“Don’t hold back, comrades! Kill it together!” Luo Tiandu roared and took the initiative to attack. The others didn’t dare be neglectful either, revealing their individual skills. Adding Xu Jing, True Spirit Continent’s side had eleven people, each of whom was a peak genius. Under their combined assault, even a peak level evil spirit held no chance.</p><p>In a few breaths, the human-shaped evil spirit was thoroughly scattered, and a life-and-death medal was left behind floating in the air.</p><p>Soon after, the second peak level evil spirit was transported over. According to the agreement, the second peak level spirit was given to the marine experts, who had the second largest numbers. Although their numbers couldn’t be compared to that of True Spirit Continent’s, under their combined assault, they were also able to easily take care of peak level evil spirit, obtaining a life-and-death medal.</p><p>Next was Blood Sky Continent’s turn, followed by Sword Sky Continent.</p><p>After one round, every side had obtained one life-and-death medal. One life-and-death medal could allow four people to enter. Hence, the other three sides needed one more medal, whereas the True Spirit Continent’s side needed two more.</p><p>“Too easy!”</p><p>Yue Lingshuang sighed. Previously, she was terrified and had to immediately escape upon coming across a peak level evil spirit. However, at this moment, peak evil spirits were being destroyed with no effort whatsoever. It could be said that these four sides were the peak groups of True Spirit World. One would not find a fifth side comparable to them.</p><p>“We still lack one!” Luo Tiandu said inwardly.</p><p>“Ye Chen still hasn’t come? Once Life-and-Death Palace appears, peak level evil spirits will not appear anymore. Don’t tell me he’s been killed?” Jihai Ruo had seen Ye Chen and knew that he was quite strong. At the very least, no more than ten people present on the scene were stronger than him.</p><p>Apart from her, there were several others who thought of him at this moment; for example, Dugu Jue, Chu Zhongtian, Xu Jing, as well as Lashan Mei and others.</p><p>“It’s here!” Luo Tiandu’s eyes shone as a peak level evil spirit appeared before his eyes.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Many from the side of True Spirit Continent acted without hesitation. However, Xu Jing, Dugu Jue, and Chu Zhongtian didn’t act. They seemed unwilling to settle peak level evil spirits so soon. This was because they knew that once this evil spirit was killed, Life-and-Death Palace would be opening pretty soon. The people who were left behind would lose the chance to enter Life-and-Death Palace.</p><p>After all, the Life-and-Death Palace was an existence that had its own unique rules.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>There were numerous experts on the side of True Spirit Continent. Even though a few didn’t act, it merely delayed killing the peak level evil spirit. Ten-fifteen minutes later, a life-and-death medal hung in the air. Luo Tiandu looked pensively at the people who hadn’t acted and sighed inwardly.</p><p>Life-and-Death Palace slowly opened, and no more peak evil spirits appeared on the plaza.</p><p>“Enter!” The experts from Blood Sky Continent were the first to enter, followed closely by Sword Sky Continent and marine experts.</p><p>“We’ve too go in as well!” Luo Tiandu took the lead.</p><p>“Too late!”</p><p>Dugu Jue was a bit disappointed. With three medals, they could actually have twelve people entering. If Ye Chen hurried, he still had the chance.</p><p>The last one to enter was Xu Jing. Before entering, she looked back for a moment.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>The final medal disappeared.</p><p>Life-and-Death were only effective for a short time period. After this time period was over, Life-and-Death Palace would absorb the medal.</p><p>“Damn, we’re late!”</p><p>From far away, two figures were rushing over, and the speaker was Qin Tianxiong.</p><p>“Not necessarily!” Ye Chen took out the life-and-death medal from his storage ring,</p><p>“What? You have a life-and-death medal?” Qin Tianxiong’s mouth wide opened while thinking of the implications.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
