He was indeed Ye Chen. He smiled coldly as he flashed his body, appearing in the center of the plaza.</p><p>“Master Ye!”</p><p>“Master Ye is here!”</p><p>The disciples from the school let out a breath. Ling Huyi had brought them too huge a pressure. He was just a half step king warrior, and yet was able to be so powerful that only half step warriors at the same level and with the same potential could compete with him. Without a doubt, only Ye Chen would be a rightful match here.</p><p>“Who are you? I have not heard about you before. I did not know that there was a second half step king warrior here in Zhang Tian Martial School.” Ling Huyi saw that Ye Chen was even younger than him, forcing him to calm down his killing intent and ask with a cold voice.</p><p>“You are flattering me. I am the new Great Master of Zhang Tian Martial School.”</p><p>Ye Chen could sense that Ling Huyi’s cultivation was similar to him, both being at the top half step king warrior level. However, judging by his qi, he must be more powerful than the Blacklight King from before.</p><p>“Great Master from Zhang Tian Martial School?” Ling Huyi frowned a bit. He had no idea how this could have happened. He knew that it would be impossible for the school to secretly train someone like this, since it would definitely be detected by the top three martial schools. It left only one explanation, that this person came from somewhere else and somehow had a history with the school.</p><p>“Perhaps they have not told you about the school’s condition right now. I can only tell you this that you should leave as soon as possible. Otherwise, you will regret coming here.”</p><p>Ling Huyi was not hurried to attack. Since Ye Chen’s cultivation was similar to him, it would not be easy for him to beat the other after all.</p><p>“I know about the school’s condition. But, since I am the Great Master of the school now, I will not let other people disrespect it. No matter it is the Extreme Heaven Martial School or the Bald Eagle Valley, or even the Earth Bear Family, I will not let it happen.”</p><p>Heard him, Ling Huyi sneered. He was already being respectful enough to Ye Chen, but the latter had not only not been nice to him, he had not even respected the top three martial institutions!</p><p>“It seems like only death can teach you a lesson.” Ling Huyi squinted his eyes as a killing vibe spread out.</p><p>“Extreme Heaven Martial School’s trash, take this attack of mine!”</p><p>All of a sudden, a sharp sword qi spread out from the side. It was where Master Lu lived as well as Ye Chen’s mountain peak. With one on the left and the other on the right, the main peak of the school was well-protected.</p><p>It was indeed Master Lu who shot out that beam of sword qi.</p><p>Although he might not be his old self and could not tell friends from enemies, he was familiar with the aura of half step king warriors from the top three martial schools. Extreme Heaven Martial School was a school that trained demon arts, and the Extreme heaven Demon Art would be their most powerful martial movements. Ling Huyi had trained this precise martial art, so he was naturally regarded as the symbol of his school. It was why Master Lu immediately shot out a beam of sword attack immediately after sensing the aura.</p><p>“You are looking for death!”</p><p>Ling Huyi tightened his right first and threw it out toward the incoming attack.</p><p>Pooh!</p><p>That sword qi was shattered immediately and disappeared into the wind. However, the power of the punch had not finished as it landed heavily onto Master Lu’s protective Zhen yuan and blew him backward into the air immediately.</p><p>Ling Huyi was about to attack again to wound Master Lu badly but Ye Chen took out his sword. The second the sword came out of its scabbard, that sharp sword intent turned into a destructive tornado, attacking right toward Ling Huyi and making it impossible for him to continue attacking master Lu. He had a feeling that he would have to pay a big price if he was slightly reckless.</p><p>“Destruction sword intent! No wonder so arrogant!”</p><p>Ling Huyi’s eyes focused. Gao Zhiyuan having the immortal sword intent was impressive, but not threatening. However, Ye Chen’s destruction sword intent would not be something that Gao Zhiyuan could compare with. He was afraid that it might already have reached peak level rank 4, if not rank 5.</p><p>Moreover, the destruction sword intent was even more powerful than the immortal sword intent in terms of attacking potential.</p><p>“However, a high level sword intent does not mean the actual power would be strong as well. Demon wind Godly Fist!”</p><p>Stepping forward with his right feet, Ling Huyi performed his art and countless shadows appeared from his right arm. The dark black fist wind poured toward Ye Chen, containing wind and dark profound. It was like a dark wind tornado attacking over menacingly.</p><p>“Back out!”</p><p>With the evil shattering sword in hand, Ye Chen waved his sword upward and a broken moon like black beam of sword power tore apart the black fist wind, traveling back up.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Ye Chen’s sword attack was too powerful, and Ling Huyi had a hunch that his protective Zhen yuan would not be able to block out this sword power at all.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>A black shadow flashed once as Ling Huyi flew into the sky. Losing the target in sight, the black sword power shot out into the distance for a long time before disappearing completely.</p><p>“Demon Wind Heaven Cry!”</p><p>As Ling Huyi was about to perform the last movement of his martial art, Ye Chen had already appeared in front of him without him even finishing the gestures. It was as if the latter had traveled through space before arriving right in his face. Without a choice, Ling Huyi threw out a punch at his Evil Shattering Sword while jumping higher into the air. The main peak of the school now for him was just a dark dot.</p><p>“How come he is so fast?” Ling Huyi was frightened.</p><p>“This place should be far enough from the main peak.”</p><p>In the air, Ye Chen stood a couple of miles away from Ling Huyi, the sword in his hand shooting a sharp, bright light.</p><p>“Who the heck are you?”</p><p>The kind of power Ye Chen had displayed terrified Ling Huyi. Although he was not one of the Life and Death Realm warrior soon-to-be list yet, he felt that some of the members on that list might still not be his rightful opponents. He was only a couple of years away from the life and death challenge.</p><p>“It does not matter who I am. What is important is that you better go back and pass on the message that your school should not embarrass itself by coming here again.” Ye Chen said.</p><p>“Arrogant! You really think you can win against me?” Ling Huyi screamed as the Zhen yuan inside his body was pushed to the limits. That pair of gloves over his hands shone with a halo of tyrant light; it was a pair of pseudo extreme rank gloves he obtained by coincidence. Only with them did he have the guts to fight off Ye Chen’s incoming attack directly.</p><p>“Master Ye managed to push away the first martial genius of Extreme Heaven Martial School?”</p><p>“So powerful! What is this master Ye’s background really?”</p><p>Although everyone inside the Zhang Tian School now knew about Ye Chen’s relationship with their founding father Battle King, but his own story had not been told at all. They were very curious about him since the kind of talent and power he had shown would not be nothing in his home continent. He might even be someone really famous.</p><p>On the plaza, Master Lu stood with li Zhangfeng. He was not like last time, attacking Ling Huyi recklessly, because the battle between Ye Chen and Ling Huyi left him no chance to join in. Even though he might not have the right mind, the warrior’s instinct still stayed with him.</p><p>“Take Zhiyuan down for some rest.”</p><p>Li Zhangfeng ordered some staff members to take away Gao Zhiyuan and then stared at the sky without even blinking. He knew that Ling Huyi would not be that easy to take on. Right now, all hopes were on Ye Chen. If even Ye Chen could not beat him, then the school’s future would not be so bright after all.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
