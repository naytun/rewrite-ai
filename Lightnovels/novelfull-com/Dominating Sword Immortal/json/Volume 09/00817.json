At this point, the black-robed old man was already too near. Even using Sword Domain would not allow him to escape the other’s reach. Thus, it would be better for him to judge the situation calmly. Otherwise, a single Sky Scorpio Sword could bring about countless changes.</p><p>Most importantly, the Sky Scorpio Sword cost several folds more Zhen Yuan than the Evil Vanquishing Sword. A single swing of the sword would most likely empty his entire Zhen Yuan, which would certainly be a path of doom.</p><p>Turning around, Ye Chen asked calmly, “Your majesty, what is your business with us?”</p><p>The black-robed strode in the void towards Ye Chen and spoke with a grim voice, “Two things…to take her and kill you?”</p><p>“You really intend for a life-and-death struggle?”</p><p>Operating the Green Lotus Sword Arts, Ye Chen accumulated his Zhen Yuan. The Destruction Sword Soul and Immortal Sword Soul in his body vibrated incessantly, as if ready to fly out at any moment. The opponent was a Demonic Human King. Ye Chen couldn’t even begin to imagine how strong he was. Thus, he had to push his battle power to its limits and even surpass it, just to have a mere sliver of chance!</p><p>“Life-and-death struggle? You’ve to be qualified first!” Stopping a dozen li away, the black-robed man old man said with disdain.</p><p>“You step back a little.” Ye Chen knew that this battle would be hard to avoid, and would probably the most dangerous battle ever since he had stepped on the martial dao. He let Murong Qingcheng retreat a few dozens of li, so that she wouldn’t be caught in the aftermath, and maybe even escape by herself if she had a chance.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>Pursing her lips, she quietly stepped back. Of course, escaping by herself would be impossible for her. However, at the moment, she couldn’t be a distraction for Ye Chen.</p><p>“Yeah!” Ye Chen faintly nodded, shifting his gaze back on black-robed old man.</p><p>“Seems like you’ll resist to the bitter end, eh?” Black-robed old man said.</p><p>Ye Chen responded, ” I’ve never given up ever since I’ve stepped on the road of martial dao. This time won’t be any different, neither any time in future. If you want my life, come!”</p><p>He took out a ten upper grade pills and stuffed them into his mouth. He would certainly require to replenish his Zhen Yuan at crucial moments.</p><p>Feeling the victory in his grasp, the black-robed old man didn’t stop him. “Prepared enough?” His voice turned stern.</p><p>“Bring it on!”</p><p>“Haha, die then!” The black-robed old man issued a palm strike at Ye Chen from dozens of li away. This strike contained no profound, only pure Zhen Yuan energy. However, this pure Zhen Yuan energy issued by a Demonic Human King was frightening to the extreme. The clouds floating in the sky sped by a hundred times, as if fast forwarded in a movie. The ocean water was cut in half, creating an enormous gorge. As for the volcanic island, half of it was instantly destroyed by the strike’s aura.</p><p>The debris of destruction didn’t fly away, but remained suspended in the air. The palm of strike of the old man had instantly turned a thousand li of sky into vacuum. At the same time, the darkened sky and surging demonic power wave made it seem as if doomsday had arrived.</p><p>However, this was not enough for Ye Chen’s face to change drastically. The space before him shattered like a mirror into hundreds of shards. This might was more than double that of Bewitching Mirror Shattering.</p><p>Waning Moon would be a mere joke before this. Ye Chen hissed as azure Qi streams rapidly spread out from his body. In the next moment, a majestic sword domain surrounded several hundred li around him. Azure swords condensed one after another, shooting forth.</p><p>“Eh? A Sword Domain!”</p><p>The thought struck the old man like lightning. There were not more than three Sword Kings with Sword Domains, and he only knew one of them. Sword Domain was an integral body capable of suppression, defense, and offense. If a Sword King had trapped him in his Sword Domain, he would have only one thought: to escape as fast as he could and as far as he could. If he failed to escape, he would be ground to death amidst absolute despair.</p><p>Unfortunately, Ye Chen’s Sword Domain was merely in its embryonic form. Moreover, his cultivation base lacked a greater realm. Even if he had formed true Sword Domain, the old man would not be afraid. The reason he was astounded was that Ye Chen had grasped Sword Domain too prematurely, which was simply beyond common sense.</p><p>Sword Domain in itself was not sufficient. Holding the Evil Vanquishing Sword, Ye Chen slashed while using his strongest move—Bewitching Mirror Destruction. A cyan-colored sword rain burst out.</p><p>Peng Peng Peng!</p><p>Kacha…Kacha!</p><p>Countless explosions echoed as a starry river seemed to have formed between Ye Chen and the black-robed old man. Inside the starry river, bright sword light spread out while emitting dazzling rays. One after another, resplendent cracks spread out as if that region had been pierced by the sharpest blade, marking an Armageddon.</p><p>In the end, all the energy streams disintegrated, and an indistinct black palm charged out from within, fiercely clashing with Ye Chen’s Protective Zhen Yuan.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>Ye Chen violently spurted out a mouthful of blood. The combination of his Protective Zhen Yuan and pseudo supreme grade armor couldn’t even take a single hit. In the next instant, an indistinct palm imprint could be seen on his armor, and a boundless power entered his body through his armor. Ye Chen felt as if all his internal organs were disintegrating, and his chest almost protruded back.</p><p>“Too powerful!”</p><p>Ye Chen didn’t die. First the Bronze Armor, second the Dragon Bone layer on his skin, and third the Undying Body…One could imagine how strong his vitality was. Even so, the black-robed old man’s casual palm strike had almost exploded his entire body into pieces.</p><p>Ye Chen had finally experienced the strength of a Demonic Human King. The difference between the two sides wasn’t merely of a single greater realm.</p><p>Gulp!</p><p>Swallowing one of the pills, Ye Chen took out an upper grade Zhen Yuan mending pill and popped it in his mouth.</p><p>“Impossible! He didn’t die?”</p><p>It was completely out of black-robed old man’s expectations. It was meaningless to say how powerful a Life and Death King was. Just knowing that they could shatter the void was enough. Even though his palm strike was a lot weakened by the Sword Domain and Bewitching Mirror Shattering, it was more than enough to kill a ‘strongest’ half-step King wearing a pseudo supreme grade armor.</p><p>“Not bad! I’ve gained some respect for you.”</p><p>Black-robed old man stood with his hands behind his back as a slither of graveness appeared in his eyes. If Ye Chen attained Life and Death realm in the future, he would become a terrifying enemy. Since he was an enemy, he must eliminate the roots at all costs. Otherwise, if the latter was allowed to mature, he didn’t dare imagine the consequences.</p><p>Ye Chen’s body was bent, giving off an extremely exhausted aura like a sole candle flame flickering in the wind. However, his eyes were still bright as ever. As he stared at the black-robed old man, the medicinal Zhen Yuan in his body soared while his Undying Body operated, rapidly healing his body.</p><p>Seeing Ye Chen’s aura soar, seeming as if it would restore completely, the black-robed old man’s face changed. What were his eyes seeing? A mere half-step King had actually comprehended Undying Body. This was an ability of Life and Death Kings, and a trademark of them at that.</p><p>“Wrong. It hasn’t reached the Limb Regrowth step!”</p><p>As a possessor of Undying Body. the black-robed old man naturally knew the mysteries of limb regrowth. Although Ye Chen’s restoring speed was far below Limb Regrowth step, it was still not to be looked upon. Such a grave injury had been seventy-eighty percent healed in a moment.</p><p>“Let me see how many palms you can take!”</p><p>Still not using any profound, the black-robed man extended his palm and struck again. He was sure that this palm strike would be the nail in the coffin. It should be known that Ye Chen almost died even when was in his peak state. Now that he wasn’t even in his peak condition, there was hardly any doubt!</p><p>“Demonic Fist!”</p><p>Suddenly…</p><p>The bat wings behind Murong Qingcheng shone with a resplendent black light as her speed reached an unprecedented state with a flap of her wings. In less than one-hundredth of a second, she arrived above the black-robed old man and punched down. This palm was more or less a tiny resplendent sun.</p><p>It was unknown whether the black-robed old man couldn’t react or didn’t care, but her punch hit the black-robed old man.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>When her fist reached a meter from black-robed old man’s body, a black colored Qi barrier stopped it. Fierce Qi blasts erupted, soaring into the sky.</p><p>Blob!</p><p>The Qi wall disintegrated, and Murong Qingcheng was blasted off.</p><p>The black-robed old man smiled, “As expected of a perfect demonic vessel! You have many secrets. The punch just now contained a pure King grade demonic power. Otherwise, it couldn’t have broken my Zhen Yuan barrier. That’s even better! The more potential you have, the more secrets you have, the better for my demonic human clan.”</p><p>“Even a pure demonic power essence fist couldn’t injure him?” A trace of bitterness appeared on Murong Qingcheng’s face. She had obtained this demonic essence from planar battlefield, and its purity was equivalent King grade demonic power. Following her breakthrough into half-step King realm, her diluted demonic power essence was also reaching the King grade. Combining it with the Demonic Power Fist, she felt that she should be able to threaten the black-robed old man somewhat. However, the latter’s strength was completely beyond her expectations.</p><p>“Six Seals Sky Formation!”</p><p>Retracting his smile, the black-robed old man threw out six crystal pillars which shuttled through the void and surrounded Murong Qingcheng. In the next moment, the pillars erupted in a bright light and linked with each other, forming an enclosed crystal space. Murong Qingcheng floated in the sky inside, trapped completely.</p><p>“You can have a rest here! Let me kill him first, then we can go back.” The black-robed old man no longer spared a glance for Murong Qingcheng and focused on Ye Chen again.</p><p>Ye Chen’s aura had already been completely restored. A year ago, his Undying Body had faintly touched the second layer—Limb Regrowth. As a result, his regenerative ability was far higher than before. Although the previous strike did leave him on the verge of death, as long as his body was not destroyed, he could quickly recover to his peak. Of course, the Undying Body in early stages also had a limit. He didn’t dare to be certain how many more hits he could take. It might be even possible that his body would collapse by the very next strike.</p><p>“I can’t take a second hit.”</p><p>Ye Chen glanced at the trapped Murong Qingcheng and a gleam of determination flickered in his eyes. His storage ring flickered and a peerless sword appeared in his hands. Before it was even unsheathed, a slaughter sword Qi filled the heaven and earth.</p><p>With the Sky Scorpio Sword in hand, Ye Chen’s aura further increased without ceasing.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
