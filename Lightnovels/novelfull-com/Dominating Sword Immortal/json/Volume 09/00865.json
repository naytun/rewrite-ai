With that gesture, the snow white longsword flickered and pierced through Marquis Star Sword’s throat.</p><p>It was Marquis Sword Snow’s Victory!</p><p>The hearts of the spectators were pounding. They didn’t expect that Marquis Sword Snow still had a hidden ace, and this ace was none other than the Sword Domain. What did the Sword Domain represent? Nobody was ignorant about the fact that it represented a potential in sword dao that others couldn’t even imagine. It marked the kings among sword artists, who were unrivalled in their league.</p><p>“Sky Sword Continent is worthy of being called the holy grounds of sword artists. It has birthed many sword artists with Sword Domain, and now there’s Marquis Sword Snow.”</p><p>“But, it’s also because of Marquis Sword Snow’s frightening talent. True Spirit Continent is filled with sword artists, but there have only been a handful of sword artists with Sword Domain.”</p><p>Zhen Yuan transmissions didn’t work in Life-and-Death Palace, but one could still converse with soul transmissions.</p><p>“Nobody’s denying that, of course!”</p><p>As soon as Marquis Sword Snow revealed the Sword Domain, his standing immediately rose to level with Ye Chen, and some were even putting him above the latter because his Freezing Sword Point was exceptionally frightening too. Combining both the aspects, Ye Chen indeed seemed a bit weaker.</p><p>“Sword Domain? Don’t tell me he has passed through the seventh layer of Sword Realm!” In the small chamber, Marquis Sword Star was in disbelief.</p><p>There was a reason that Sky Sword Continent was considered as the holy ground of sword artists. In the continent was a ginormous, mountain-like heavenly sword. According to the legends, this sword flew in from beyond the sky and got stuck at the center of the continent, converging the sword under the heavens. If sword artists were to cultivate there, they could easily gain accomplishments in the sword dao. This was the true reason for Sky Sword Continent’s name.</p><p>The heavenly sword was more than three thousand meters long and had a strange space within it, which was called the Sword Realm by the people of Sky Sword Continent. Nobody knew how many layers this realm had. One could not enter this realm with their fleshy body, but had to form a body of spirit and consciousness.</p><p>Marquis Sword Star had entered the Sword Realm before; however, he could only clear the sixth layer and was killed as soon as he entered the seventh layer. This was because there were too many ‘sword artists’ inside. These sword artists had the same exact aura as him. He could kill one, ten, or even hundred of them, but what about a thousand? Even some ordinary Life-and-Death Sword Kings couldn’t clear the seventh layer. The opponent had the same foundations as oneself and would only differ in sword techniques.</p><p>To clear the seventh layer, one had to grasp the Sword Domain and warp the incoming attacks. Otherwise, one could only die.</p><p>The huge advantage of clearing Sword Realm was that one didn’t have any fear of death, and after thousands of bitter battles, one would be able to gradually form one’s own sword dao. Sword Realm was the single biggest reason that Sky Sword Continent had birthed so Many Sword Kings with Sword Domain.</p><p>“If I can’t grasp the Sword Domain, I will be eternally incapable of becoming their opponent!” Marquis Sword Star firmly clenched his fists, an intense battle spirit blazing in his eyes. He was not feeling dispirited at all. Ye Chen and Marquis Sword Snow’s appearance gave him endless motivation, and he even felt gratified. If not for these two, he would never have found such a sense of urgency and motivation.</p><p>“Sword Domain, the ultimate glory for a sword artist of True Spirit Continent!” Lu Shaoyou sucked in a deep breath, seeming as if he’d made a firm resolve.</p><p>Currently, the crown of best sword artist rested both on Ye Chen’s and Marquis Sword Snow’s heads. Many couldn’t wait to see a battle between these two and witness what a confrontation between two Sword Domains looked like.</p><p>“Sword Domain…no wonder!” Ye Chen immediately understood.</p><p>He never thought that others would be incapable of grasping the Sword Domain. There had been others before him, and there would be more in the future. Thus, Marquis Sword Snow’s Sword Domain was perfectly acceptable to him. After all, as the number one young sword artist of Sky Sword Continent, nothing would be surprising coming from him.</p><p>“That’s good too. If I were the only person with Sword Domain in the young generation, I couldn’t even have exchanged pointers and verified the mystique of Sword Domain.” An intense battle desire flickered in Ye Chen’s eyes.</p><p>The following battles of the thirty-second round completely lost their splendor. However, the thirty-third round again rose everybody’s spirits.</p><p>Xu Jing against Marquis Sword Star…</p><p>Apart from Ye Chen and Marquis Sword Snow, Marquis Sword Star felt the most uncertain while facing Xu Jing. In all honesty, he would rather face the former two instead of Xu Jing. Facing Ye Chen and Marquis Sword Snow, he still had a chance since they were competing in sword arts at the end of the day. However, against Xu Jing, it would be a full-blown struggle of strength.</p><p>Xu Jing’s Sacred Dragon Fist Second Step directly turned Young Elephant Lord into blood mist. Such a frightening destructive power was not one bit inferior to his fifth strike, and even slightly surpassed it. Moreover, the range of his fifth strike was far inferior to Xu Jing’s Sacred Dragon Fist.</p><p>“This battle will be dangerous.” Marquis Sword Star stared unblinkingly at Xu Jing with a grave face.</p><p>“Star Shattering Fist!”</p><p>Xu Jing immediately started with one of her aces. The lighting in the chamber darkened and stars flickered; one of the stars exploded, swarming toward Marquis Star Sword.</p><p>“Moonlight Chop!”</p><p>Marquis Sword Star didn’t even have the time to use his Seven Star Sword Strike. He could only hurriedly raise Lupus, which gave off a dense moonlight and illuminated half of the chamber.</p><p>“Poison Dragon Fist!”</p><p>Dashing forward, Xu Jing punched out again. The penetrative power of fist energy was somewhat similar to Marquis Sword Star’s Seven Star Sword Strike, but her Poison Dragon Fist also contained a hint of rotational power.</p><p>“So powerful!”</p><p>Marquis Sword Star could finally experience what Young Elephant Lord must have felt. Xu Jing’s punches seemed quite straightforward, but every single one of them caused the space to freeze, suppressing her opponent and rendering him incapable of using movement arts, and thus forcing him to receive her blows head-on. Moreover, facing her head-on was the same as seeking death, as her strength was even above Young Elephant and was much more condensed.</p><p>“Fourth Strike, Meteor Fall!”</p><p>With a ferocious expression, Marquis Sword Star directly used the fourth strike. Although Xu Jing’s Poison Dragon Fist could breach his defenses, out of the hundreds of sword Qi he’d issued, at least half should hit their mark.</p><p>He planned on making both of them suffer!</p><p>Marquis Sword Star didn’t have much of a choice. He didn’t have a good grasp over the fifth strike; if he forcefully used it, it would not be as effective, and would only reveal gaps.</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>Xu Jing’s eyes squinted as her body suddenly stopped, causing the ground underneath her feet to crack. Her hands drew a circle before her body and golden flames spun like yin-yang symbol, condensing into a huge golden whirlpool.</p><p>Peng Peng Peng!</p><p>The numerous sword Qi drowned in the whirlpool, disintegrating instantly.</p><p>“This is the moment!”</p><p>Marquis Sword Star had bought himself an opportunity, so he retreated for dozens of steps and issued his fifth strike. Emanating the light of supernova, Lupus thrusted forth violently. Space itself seemed to have lost meaning and time also seemed to slow down as the tip of Lupus flashed and appeared less than a meter from Xu Jing.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At that moment, a dragon cry resounded indistinctly. Confronting this strike, Xu Jing’s expression also turned exceptionally grave. She was indeed a Golden Dragon, but she had yet to complete her transformation. The skill of the person who changed her into her human form was simply reaching the heavens. After all, nobody was able to tell that she actually a dragon before.</p><p>Even after soaking many years into the Dragon Transforming Pool at the Dragon God Celestial Palace, she was only able to complete more than half of her transformation. If not for the opening of Life-and-Death Palace’s opening, Dragon King would not have allowed her to end her seclusion.</p><p>‘What is she trying to do?’ Everybody cried out in their hearts.</p><p>Under their gazes, Xu Jing reached out, grabbing at the flying Lupus What did she take Marquis Sword Star’s fifth strike as?</p><p>“Courting Death!” Marquis Sword Star sneered.</p><p>Clank Clang Clang!</p><p>She grabbed the aurora like Lupus, leading to visible sound waves of death dao. The piercing power of Lupus was too strong as it grinded through her palm, slipping across half of the sword’s length. Its tip was an inch away from her shoulder. As long as it covered the distance, it could instantly obliterate all the vitality inside her body.</p><p>The fifth Strike, Star Extinction, was no joke.</p><p>Amidst erupting golden flames, Xu JIng’s strength was pushed to the limits. Her fingernails, which were polished white, suddenly sharpened, firmly holding Lupus. At the same time, her left hand clenched into a fist and punched.</p><p>Sacred Dragon Fist!</p><p>Puff!</p><p>A holy golden dragon brushed past Marquis Sword Star’s body and he instantly turned into blood mist. Even his armor and Lupus faded away as they were falling on the ground.</p><p>Xu Jing finally defeated Marquis Sword Star in an absolutely stunning manner!</p><p>Hiss!</p><p>Numerous sounds of sharp inhalation sounded one after another while everybody’s jaw was almost touching the ground.</p><p>“The hell…She caught my Lupus to break Star Extinction!” Inside the small chamber, Marquis Sword Star stood in disbelief.</p><p>Star Extinction contained an unparalleled power of impulse. One could imagine how frightening the light of death it must have emanated. Although Xu Jing was wearing a pair of pseudo supreme grade gloves, allowing her hand to avoid direct contact with Lupus, the power transmitted was enough to crush the hands of anybody under the Life-and-Death realm in an instant.</p><p>If his sword could be that easily grabbed, this strike’s name would not be Star Extinction.</p><p>However, Xu Jing did it!</p><p>Such strength and endurance…</p><p>Marquis Sword Snow’s had also turned a bit sluggish.</p><p>“A Golden Dragon will be Golden Dragon. It’s a legendary existence indeed!” Ye Chen smiled bitterly. The standing of Golden Dragons as living creatures was too high. If any other creature had attempted such a thing, they would have died a miserable death.</p><p>Xu Jing’s battle was too astonishing, causing people to remain a bit dull even during the following battles.</p><p>Thirty-third round…</p><p>Everybody’s focused returned as two names lit up on the stelle—Marquis Sword Snow and Ye Chen.</p><p>The two sword freaks had eventually met.</p><p>Sword arts against sword arts…</p><p>Sword Domain against Sword Domain…</p><p>Who would have the last laugh? This was the question in everybody’s mind.</p><p>At this moment, there were no distracting thoughts in anybody’s head. The shock brought by Xu Jing’s battle was completely thrown out, and everybody’s gazes remained unblinkingly on the two figures underneath.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
