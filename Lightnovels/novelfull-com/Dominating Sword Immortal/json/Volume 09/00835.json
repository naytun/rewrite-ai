Ting! Dang! Dang!</p><p>The bright light continued to flash high in the air as Ye Chen and Ling Huyi exchanged attacks at a high speed. Both of them were martial geniuses and experienced when it came to battles. The battle between them was so intense that it could not be attributed to just strong attacking power. It also included areas such as speed, experience, and battle prowess.</p><p>“Demon Wind Heaven Cry!”</p><p>This time, Ling Huyi finally performed the last movement of the demon wind godly fist, its combination of both wind and dark profound being even better. As he threw out a fist, the dark tornado made a loud noise while a hysterical cry could be heard, as if the sky itself was crying.</p><p>‘He is indeed more powerful than the Blacklight King!’</p><p>The Blacklight King was too old, so it would be rather impossible for him to reach Life and Death Realm. But, he somehow managed it. However, judging on the power, he was not as powerful as Ling Huyi at all. He was not even as powerful as Thunder Spirit King, who was the most powerful warrior amongst the half step king level warriors. Thunder Spirit King was actually one of the scariest persons for Ye Chen. He did not have the confidence to beat Thunder Spirit King without his Scorpion Sword or Yuan Emperor image.</p><p>Facing Ling Huyi’s most powerful fist attack, Ye Chen did not back out at all and just threw out a straight bright black sword attack.</p><p>Pap! Pop!</p><p>Compared to Ye Chen’s broken moon, Ling Huyi’s Demon Wind Heaven Cry was obviously weaker. The second the two clashed, the fist power was shattered layer after layer unstoppably. This frightened Ling Huyi, who continued throwing out fist attacks before canceling out the incoming attack.</p><p>However, the follow up attack of Ye Chen appeared right at that moment.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>The sword light flashed once in the air and Ye Chen appeared in front of Ling Huyi suddenly, throwing out a stab. The sword speed was so fast that the sword could not be traced at all. Only a hair thin hole appeared on the defensive layer of Ling Huyi.</p><p>Chin!</p><p>Sparks appeared in Ling Huyi’s chest while his whole body was blown into the air, puking out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“What kind of sword speed is this?”</p><p>Ling Huyi was shocked at what just happened. Ye Chen’s moving route was barely visible for him. but the sword attack was just impossible to trace. Inside the Blood Heaven Land, it was not like he had not fought against any of those top young martial warriors. Even one or two of the soon-to-be Life and Death realm warriors could not have this kind of speed.</p><p>He looked down at his chest and his pupils shrank immediately. His half extreme rank armor had been punctured through almost completely, only half an inch away from reaching his body.</p><p>Gasp!</p><p>Everyone on the main peak plaza could not help but gasp. Ye Chen beating Ling Huyi was already impressive enough. But, the power that one sword attack contained was just beyond comprehension. That sword speed could really shock them as sword artists. Before one moved, the other had already thrown out a sword attack. How crazy was that!</p><p>“Master Ye Chen has an unimaginable power. Although Ling Huyi might already be famous among us, he still did not gain an upper hand at all. He does not even stand a chance.”</p><p>“Indeed! This sword attack completely caught Ling Huyi off guard.”</p><p>“If Master Ye could teach us how to throw fast sword attacks, then how great would that be?”</p><p>Ye Chen’s Spirit Sword attack would obviously not be suitable for them to learn, unless they could comprehend the fast profound. However, no matter how great the sword art was, it would have to be performed by people. Besides the sword arts, Ye Chen also won in his techniques, which were almost reaching perfection. Even Life and Death Realm warriors might not be able to do any better.</p><p>“Do you want to continue?”</p><p>Ye Chen did not plan to kill Ling Huyi, since he was new in town and the school was still relatively weak. There was no reason for him to go for the extreme, as he could leave any day but the school had to stay here.</p><p>“The result is not clear yet. Do not gloat already.”</p><p>Ling Huyi had a bad look on his face, as losing to someone even younger than him had embarrassed him. Ye Chen’s power had also shocked him, and he could not recall anyone like him inside the Blood Heaven Land or the other regions.</p><p>Ye Chen saw that Ling Huyi did not plan to back out, and knew it was because he still had some powerful attacks that he had not used yet. However, Ye Chen was not afraid at all. Not many people below Life and Death Realm warriors could scare him.</p><p>The Evil Shattering Sword in Ye Chen’s hand was so fast that it was invisible to the bare human eyes. All one could see perhaps would be tiny sword holes appearing in the sky out of blood .</p><p>The Spirit Sword’s power was indeed not as great as Waning Moon or Mirror Flower Destruction. However, the effect of the attack was different, and not weaker than the two at all. When the sword speed was fast to a certain level, it would be impossible to ensure without enough defensive power.</p><p>As for leaving the marks in the air, that was because Ye Chen’s sword intent was too powerful. Rank 5 destruction sword intent was equivalent to a rank 6 normal sword intent, which was a level that could already bend the structure of space. If it were not for the fact that Ye Chen’s Zhen yuan was slightly weaker, which could not support the sword intent, it could project mental power for millions of miles with the rank 5 destruction sword intent alone. Those were tricks only Life and Death Realm king warriors could perform.</p><p>Not matter how hard Ling Huyi tried, it seemed impossible for him to escape from Ye Chen’s attack. It was like it had locked onto his soul, and there would be no place for the soul to run. It was just like a bug on a spider’s net, waiting for the spider to harvest its prey.</p><p>Pooh!</p><p>Countless sword holes appeared on that half extreme shield while Ling Huyi’s face was getting paler and paler. Blood mist continued to appear from his mouth.</p><p>“You still will not leave?”</p><p>Up until now, Ye Chen had only used sixty percent of his power. His cultivation was just the same as his opponent’s, so it would not be necessary for him to go all out. All this while, Ye Chen had been cross-realm battling, and he had been the same even with the most powerful top martial genius.</p><p>Pooh!</p><p>This time, the sword holes seemed to have broken through the surreal space and drawn a thin black line in the air, flashing through Ling Huyi’s chest and puncturing through his body.</p><p>Wah!</p><p>Ling Huyi’s half extreme rank armor was basically ruined, and he puked out a huge mouthful of blood. He could sense that his life was slipping away through the holes made by that sword. The terrifying sword intent was eating him away from the inside through the holes on his spine.</p><p>Ye Chen’s power had reached a crazy level.</p><p>“Damn! You have pushed me to do this! Extreme Heaven Demon Body!”</p><p>Ling Huyi’s protective Zhen yuan suddenly shrank and covered up his skin. Looking from afar, it looked like his skin had turned into a layer of black metal, no longer seeming like a human body.</p><p>‘Heaven Realm Martial Art?’ Ye Chen frowned. ‘No, it seems to be unfinished.’</p><p>Heaven Realm martial arts could not be passed on, and had to be learned on one’s own. However, there were other ways as well, although the martial art would always be imperfect through those side methods. It would never be as powerful as the Green Lotus Sword Spell that Ye Chen had learned himself. No matter it was the basics or the special mutation of the art, it would always be lacking.</p><p>“I will ruin you.”</p><p>Just as Ye Chen had expected, Ling Huyi’s Extreme Heaven Demon body was indeed not learned on his own. It was a Heaven Realm Martial Art that had been passed on from a Life and Death Realm warrior of Extreme Heaven Martial School. However, the fact that he was able to learn it meant that Ling Huyi was very talented as well.</p><p>Extreme Heaven Demon Body focused on the vitality of the body, which increased the body’s reactions drastically. At the same time, the Zhen yuan would reach a whole another level, almost akin to a Life and Death Realm king warrior. All in all, it just meant that it would be way more powerful than half step king warrior.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>Ling Huyi’s speed was way faster than before, surprisingly reaching beyond Ye Chen. He was at least a couple of times faster than before, obviously because of the demon body.</p><p>“Demon Wind Heaven Cry!”</p><p>The same martial movement performed by Ling Huyi now was completely different due to the Zhen yuan amplification.</p><p>‘Indeed, a powerful Heaven Realm Martial Art! I wonder what happens when the real Extreme Heaven Demon Body is combined with Battle King’s sword body.’</p><p>Ye Chen’s expression stayed the same. If he wanted, he could perform his sword domain immediately and kill Ling Huyi in the worst way possible. Even if he did not use the sword domain, his Bewitching Mirror Flower Destruction would be able to wound him badly to the point of dying.</p><p>However, Ling Huyi was not worthy of those powerful attacks yet.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Holding the sword with both hands, Ye Chen performed his Waning Moon attack again, this time carrying an intense destruction element, which was a result of him adding his destruction sword intent onto his martial attack.</p><p>The attack flashed once in the air before leaving a terrifying scar in the void. Blood spilled in the air as Ling Huyi flew back the way he came. The armor covering his chest was completely cracked open. The bloody sword mark punctured through his whole lung area, and it was indeed where the blood spilled from.</p><p>“How is this possible!”</p><p>Ling Huyi had not even had the chance to react to the incoming attack, and a shocked expression appeared on his face. The demon body was his biggest trump card, and also the ticket for him to reach Life and Death realm. He had not expected Ye Chen to reach such an unbelievable level. And somehow, It seemed like he did not even try hard for it.</p><p>He obviously did not know that he already had no chance of winning to begin with if he did not have a certain cultivation level. Ye Chen was not like any of the other cross-realm battling warriors at all.</p><p>“He…is so powerful!”</p><p>Everyone had their stretched eyes wide open. They might not be able to see far with their physical eyes, but they knew for sure that Ling Huyi could be even more powerful, but he would still be treated as a toy in the hands of Ye Chen. They wondered how martial geniuses could be this different!</p><p>Landing on the plaza again slowly, Ye Chen put back his sword, looking as if nothing had happened.</p><p>He did not look at Ling Huyi. He knew that his full power sword attack would put him to treatment and rest for months. Moreover, it would be impossible for him to get back to his peak ever again, since the destruction sword intent would always leave a trace in the wounds, and it would be something that even king warriors could not remove.</p><p>Letting out a breath slowly, Ye Chen looked at the sky, wondering about his friends on the True Spirit Continent and their growth. With Du Gujue’s potential, he should be way more powerful than Ling Huyi. The same went for Dantai Mingyue. And then there would always be Chu Zhongtian.</p><p>They were the three people that Ye Chen was excited about the most.</p><p>Du Gujue carried his Despairing blade intent, and he was only slightly weaker than him. Dantai Mingyue seemed to have gained even better things than his space profound inside the graveyard. Adding her great potential, her growth would be unpredictable. Meanwhile, Chu Zhongtian had the worse comprehensive ability, but he had the rarest Evil spirit body, which was a spirit body at Yuan Emperor’s level.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
