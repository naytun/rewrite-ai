The thunder calamity had passed, and wind fire calamity was the next.</p><p>The great wind fire calamity was divided in external and internal layers. The outer layer was the body being ripped by gales and burnt by heavenly fire, while the internal layer was the heart demon. Facing these two layers together, martial artists with weak wills could never pass. Most people facing Life and Death calamity died from this calamity or the godly Yuan calamity. The deaths from thunder calamity were not much.</p><p>“I have to recover my Zhen Yuan first.”</p><p>The one thing one didn’t have to worry about during Life and Death Calamity was recovering Zhen Yuan. The black hole in the three skies was basically a highly compressed energy vortex. As Ye Chen operated his heaven grade Green Lotus Sword Arts, boundless Yuan Qi energies funneled toward him. Roughly speaking, the concentration of this energy was at least a thousand times higher than the outside word.</p><p>“So thick!”</p><p>Ye Chen had never had the feeling of building his Zhen Yuan pool so quickly. The rich Yuan Qi energies didn’t need to be refined at all and could be directly converted into his Zhen Yuan. His almost depleted Zhen Yuan pool recovered by a tenth in a matter of a few breaths. Then, they soon got to twenty percent, thirty percent…seventy percent, and finally hundred percent.</p><p>Huff!</p><p>The moment Ye Chen had completely recovered his Zhen Yuan, a shining whirlwind suddenly descended from the black hole and swept past him.</p><p>Pa! Pa! Pa!</p><p>With that, numerous scars appeared on Ye Chen’s face, legs, and hands.</p><p>Hiss!</p><p>Ye Chen sucked in a cold breath. This whirlwind completely disregarded his Protective Zhen Yuan and directly scraped his body. The might of the storm was not much and could barely cut through his body’s defenses. However, this was not the crucial point. Ye Chen felt that the pain coming from the cuts was excessively high. They were clearly small cuts, but they made him feel an extreme pain. Caught off-guard by the disproportionate pain, he couldn’t help but suck in a breath of cold air.</p><p>He operated his Undying body and mended the wounds, but the pain remained.</p><p>“Will…Sure enough, it’s a test of will.”</p><p>The thunder calamity tested battle strength, and the wind fire calamity tested will. It wouldn’t directly kill the martial artist, but inflict an unbearable pain on them. Moreover, this was merely the first wave. Who knew what it would test next? It should be known that it was not normal pain; it included numbness, spasms, chills, contortions, and so on.</p><p>If one couldn’t bear the external pain, once the internal calamity descended, one’s body would directly collapse. At that time, one’s body would directly disintegrate into a million pieces.</p><p>Since the Protective Zhen Yuan had no use, he retracted it. Although the external calamity wouldn’t kill him, he still needed to operate the Undying Body to heal his body. Hence, every bit of Zhen Yuan consumption could make a difference.</p><p>Zzz!</p><p>Once the storm passed, a berserk flame of heavenly fire descended, burning Ye Chen’s body. The might of heavenly fire was similarly not strong, but the pain inflicted was magnified by several folds. His body felt the numb and burning pain intermittently. Ye Chen’s entire being turned into a human torch, making him suffer various sorts of unbearable pains.</p><p>“Hehe, this is only the first wave. Once the second and second wave come, he’ll be completely out of it.”</p><p>Gray Bird King thought that Ye Chen could easily pass wind fire calamity. However, after seeing his wretched appearance, his mood brightened. He would like to see what kinds of suffering were still left in the store for Ye Chen.</p><p>“After suffering all sorts of sufferings, he’ll be attacked by us. There is nothing better and straightforward than that.” Ironarm King also smiled. “Second wave!”</p><p>Hu! Hu!</p><p>Next came a purple whirlwind, which gave a kind of moist feeling as if it were liquid. Even from so far away, they could feel their skin somewhat itchy.</p><p>“It’s Poison Wind!”</p><p>The Poison Wind was considered the most powerful wind fire calamity. One would be immediately poisoned after coming in contact with this poison. Although the poison would not infiltrate the body, it would cause one’s skin to rot, wither, and stink. Not to mention the person experiencing it, even the spectators felt their scalps go numb. Not anybody could evoke this calamity, and only once-in-a-thousand-year geniuses had this pleasure.</p><p>Ye Chen’s skin turned purple black at a visible rate. Then, it began to rot, emitting a purple, poisonous liquid from the rotting regions. It was an extremely disgusting scene. With his brows creased, Ye Chen sat cross-legged in the air with his palms firmly holding his knees.</p><p>“He is actually enduring!”</p><p>Ironhand King was in a bit of disbelief. He felt that the first wind calamity was quite ordinary, but once he was scraped by the wind, he felt a pain that stretched the limits of endurance. His forehead was raining sweat and he couldn’t help but scream a few times. In his view, as terrifying as the Poison Wind was considered, Ye Chen should have at least let out a few screams.</p><p>“Could this Poison Wind be not as frightening as claimed?” Ironarm King extended his hand and grabbed a few strands of the purple wind.</p><p>Ah!</p><p>A miserable shriek instantly came out of his mouth as his entire right arm directly rotted away. However, that was nothing compared to the pain coming from his arm, which sent him spasming. This pain was not something a person could endure. It should only exist in the purgatory of the legends.</p><p>“How powerful is this Poison Wind!”</p><p>Gray Bird King’s scalp went numb. How could he still have the courage to act like Ironarm King? Even the masked man gave up on the idea of testing the Purple Wind.</p><p>“Damn!”</p><p>Operating his Undying Body, he restored his right arm, but his face was completely pale and a hint of terror could be seen in the depths of his eyes. He looked at Ye Chen again, but with fear and apprehension this time. He couldn’t imagine how the latter was enduring such pain. After all, the latter’s whole body was suffering from the poison wind.</p><p>“Is this kid really a human?”</p><p>As he saw it, the pain Ye Chen felt must be beyond comprehension. Moreover, this pain could not be blocked off. He couldn’t distract himself from the pain in this trial. The test of heavens didn’t allow for such an easy route out.</p><p>Once the Poison Wind passed, a fire stream suddenly descended from the sky. It was highly concentrated, seeming more like lava.</p><p>“It’s the Sky Flame!”</p><p>Sky Flame was also the most powerful fire calamity.</p><p>The lava poured on Ye Chen’s body, directly burning his face and skin. But, the lava didn’t infiltrate his body, only rubbing against his inner muscles, as if slowly roasting his body. He could feel the pain of being burned alive as if an ordinary person were thrown into a pot of boiling oil.</p><p>Every muscle of his body swelled, and his four limbs incessantly spasmed.</p><p>He could feel his pounding heart. Ye Chen knew this was heavenly will’s blessing for him, protecting his heart and lungs from tearing themselves apart due to the pain. However, with so much pain, Ye Chen’s slowly lost consciousness and arrived in a hallucination.</p><p>It was a boundless valley. The spring was filled with bird cries and beautiful flowers, and it had a magical air to it. Giant dragons and phoenixes were flying in the skies, leaving behind dragon cries and sweet phoenix neighs. As soon as he heard them, Ye Chen completely forgot that he was amidst a trial and completely lost himself in the world.</p><p>“Your majesty, please come in!”</p><p>Outside of the valley, a squadron of expressionless, imposing divine generals was at guard. The leader of the guard pointed inside the valley, his voice respectful. Ye Chen didn’t say a word and calmly watched.</p><p>“Your majesty, young miss is waiting inside. Don’t make her wait for too long.” The divine general continued.</p><p>Seeing that Ye Chen was not moving for a long time and seemed to have no intentions of doing so, the divine general no longer spoke and just stood respectfully by the side, A few moments later, a melodious, sweet sound came from inside.</p><p>“Young master Ye, why are you not coming in? The young miss has been awaiting you for a while.” Seven beautiful women in silk skirts walked out of the valley. Each of them carried a graceful bearing like that of fairies. Their moving expressions could make anybody think twice before rejecting them.</p><p>“Come, young master Ye!” Two women skipped over and held Ye Chen’s arms, trying to pull him inside.</p><p>“Get lost!” Ye Chen released his aura for a moment, shaking the two women off.</p><p>“You…!” Tears flowed down the faces of the two women, their expressions wronged.</p><p>“Brother Ye!” Right at this moment, another person walked out of the valley. It was a tall woman with beautiful features, looking at Ye Chen with eyes full of love. It was none other than Xu Jing.</p><p>“Young miss, he doesn’t want to come in. You don’t need to care about him.” The seven women swarmed around Xu Jing.</p><p>“You really don’t want to enter?” Xu Jing asked.</p><p>A complicated look flashed in Ye Chen’s eyes before he closed them to regain his composure.</p><p>“Let it be. You can go find her!” Xu Jing let out a long sigh as she turned around and walked back inside the valley, leaving behind a teardrop.</p><p>“Ye Chen, let’s leave.” Not far away, Murong Qingcheng slowly walked over; her face had a compassionate look on her face.</p><p>“What is true, what is false?”</p><p>“It’s always hard to distinguish!”</p><p>“This is precisely the heart demon!”</p><p>Ye Chen slowly opened his eyes, which were again clear. He didn’t glance at Murong Qingcheng, and his aura incessantly climbed. The sharp sword aura caused the whole world to disintegrate like a shattering mirror.</p><p>“Break! Break! Break!”</p><p>With three roars, the valley, the divine generals, the giant dragons and phoenixes, as well as Xu Jing and Murong Qingcheng all disappeared, as if they never existed. The fire stream was still burning his body. The moment his hallucination disappeared, Ye Chen again felt the scorching pain. Moreover, because he’d just emerged from a hallucination, the pain seemed to have increased several times, making him feel like dying.</p><p>Fortunately, the time of fire calamity was limited and it soon ended. Perhaps the wind fire calamity was quite difficult for other people, but with Ye Chen’s powerful will, the so-called external calamity was useless. This was because the source of his battle strength had always been his will and soul.</p><p>After the wind fire calamity, the godly Yuan calamity finally arrived. However, to the masked man and the other three’s surprise, even though Ye Chen’s soul was so strong that it was unheard of, he actually passed it with the greatest ease.</p><p>Only Ye Chen himself knew that his soul was five times more powerful than that of an ordinary person. The essence of his soul was already comparable to that of Life and Death Kings. Thus, passing the godly Yuan calamity was much easier than passing the thunder calamity for him.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>From the black hole, a seemingly semi-liquid-semi-solid crystalline river poured down and entered Ye Chen’s body. This was the Yuan Qi of heaven and earth compressed to the limits. After entering his body, it instantly converted into king grade Zhen Yuan. With the king grade Zhen Yuan, even if Ye Chen didn’t make any progress in his profound, his battle strength would increase by multiple folds.</p><p>“Not good, his soul didn’t weaken at all! Leave!”</p><p>The masked man decided at once and entered the void. Ye Chen possessed a mid two star battle strength even before the breakthrough. And now that he had broken through, it would be a disaster for them. Previously, he was pinning his hopes on Ye Chen’s weakened soul after surviving the calamity. However, that was no longer the case, and it seemed to only be their wishful thinking.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
