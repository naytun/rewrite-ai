If a sword artist could be fast to an extent, they were already considered a top-level artist. And if they could make it subtle and detailed on top, they were a level even further above. Marquis Sword Snow’s swords, even while being subtle and detailed, exuded a dream-like beauty. This could only indicate that his grasp over minute details of sword arts had already reached perfection.</p><p>“Without facing each other, nobody can predict the outcome. There is no way to guess.” Marquis Sword Snow shook his head.</p><p>The credit battle was rapidly progressing. Since there was no danger of dying, all the experts were unhesitatingly revealing their aces, trying to settle their opponent in a single blow. It was nothing like outside, where the opponents would first try to probe their opponent, then gradually increase their strength. After all, there was only one life, and one wouldn’t want to struggle with their life-and-death in every fight.</p><p>Soon, the twenty-third round concluded.</p><p>Twenty-fourth round…</p><p>The first battle was with Xu Jing going up against Young Undying Demon Lord.</p><p>A lot of them were apprehensive of the latter’s undying body. Not everybody could be like Ye Chen, who could completely suppress him for an instant and kill him like a chicken. For the most, their only way of killing him was to have their strength substantially above him. Otherwise, it was simply hopeless. However, it was not Xu Jing who despaired this time, but the Young Undying Demon Lord.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>Fist against fist, violent shockwaves spread out in every direction. Every inch of Young Undying Demon Lord’s right arm was crushed before he was blasted off while spurting out a huge mouthful of blood. Xu Jing’s Golden Dragon Power exceeded a million jin, not something a mere undying body could resist. Moreover, compared to ordinary strengths, Golden Dragon Power was much purer and more tyrannical. It was a peak level power.</p><p>“Restore for me!”</p><p>Young Undying Demon Lord’s undying body had already reached the limb-regeneration realm, which was the innate superiority brought about by advancing the Undying Demon Art to heaven grade. Operating the Undying Demon Art, a new right hand grew out of Young Undying Demon Lord’s shoulders. His right fist was firmly clenched, issuing fierce creaking sounds as if two metals were being squeezed together.</p><p>“Poison Dragon Fist!”</p><p>How could Xu Jing give him a chance to gather his bearings? Golden flame erupted and shot across piercing the air before she punched on the Young Undying Demon Lord’s Protective Zhen Yuan. The protective Zhen Yuan seemed no different than tofu as a huge hole instantly opened in it, and the fist with golden threads curling around it caused the armor at his chest to cave in.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>A blood mist erupted as the internal organs of the Young Undying Demon Lord had been instantly crushed.</p><p>“Too strong! Young Undying Demon Lord was manhandled.”</p><p>“This woman’s strength is at least in the top three. She can only go up from there.”</p><p>Compared to confrontations that highlighted skill, this sort of steamrolling style won people over much easier. Seeing a gentle beauty turning into a war goddess was a treat to watch in itself.</p><p>Following that, some other hot matches also occurred. However, these were the candidates for the future top five, not the current top five. Thus, the atmosphere was not as rowdy.</p><p>The current candidates for the top five were eight: Marquis Sword Star, Marquis Sword Snow, Lu Tiandu, Ye Chen, Xu Jing, Tantai Mingyue, Young Elephant Lord, and Lashan Mei. Of course, there was still a chance of an upset and the emergence of a new candidate, but going by the previous matches, the chances were almost zero.</p><p>Marquis Sword Snow against Lashan Mei…The second battle of the twenty fourth round was yet another peak confrontation.</p><p>Marquis Sword Snow was a monstrous sword genius of the Sky Sword Continent. His sword arts were gorgeous, especially the move he pulled against Tantai Mingyue. It directly terrified many; they had never seen such frightening yet beautiful sword arts.</p><p>On the other side, Demoness Blade Lashan Mei was the number one blade artist of the Blood Sky Continent, and now also the number one in True Spirit Continent. At the very least, it would not be simple for the current Dugu Jue to surpass her.</p><p>The confrontation between a sword artist and blade artist had always been exciting, not to mention that both the sword artist and blade artist were the best of the best.</p><p>Lashan Mei was fully aware of Marquis Sword Snow’s terror, and thus, she didn’t dare to attack recklessly. The black demonic blade swept across, slashing a black beam of energy at Marquis Sword Snow. The latter’s body flickered repeatedly like flickering shadows. As he brushed past the black energy beam, he unsheathed his sword, filling the sky with snow.</p><p>“Such a fast sword!” Lashan Mei’s pupils shrank as she raised her blade and promptly defended herself.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lashan Mei was sent back tumbling several steps while scattered remains of the sword Qi flew about her.</p><p>“She resisted it! Worthy of being the Demoness Blade…”</p><p>To this moment, nobody was able to resist Marquis Sword Snow’s sword without being injured. Even Tantai Mingyue with her teleportation technique was almost pierced in the throat.</p><p>“Snow Swirls!”</p><p>Snowflakes no longer fell down, but swirled in the air and shot toward Lashan Mei. These snowflakes were condensed from Marquis Sword Snow’s sword Qi and were exceptionally cold and sharp. One could not rely on their Protective Zhen Yuan to resist, and had to raise their defenses.</p><p>“Break!” Lashan Mei shouted sweetly while the black demonic blade in her hand weaved about, creating a wind-tight net. As a result, the snowflakes were repelled off like an egg’s shell being peeled off.</p><p>“Eh!” Marquis Sword Snow softly exclaimed and his eyes brightened. Lashan Mei’s blade arts contained the power of vibrations. The snowflakes condensed from his sword Qi were usually not that easy to deal with, but under the power of vibrations, they were immediately dismantled and converted into incorporeal Qi.</p><p>“Demonic Chop!” Lashan Mei broke out of her demonic net and charged forth while vigorously slashing down. A deep black blade light turned the surroundings indistinct, even causing the space to crack. In the small chamber, Dugu Jue’s eyes turned cold. This was the very strike that had defeated him.</p><p>With but a flicker, the blade light arrived.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Huge sparks flew out around Marquis Sword Snow, creating a blinding yet glorious moment. The rebound force due to incessant collisions between the sword and blade caused Lashan Mei to retreat several steps, and she said with astonishment, “He actually broke my Demonic Chop with rotational power!”</p><p>Demonic Chop was a peerless blade move that could only be comprehended once one had greater completion in Demonic Blade Arts. The vibrational power it contained was far surpassed ordinary blade moves. Under this power, even Dugu Jue, who was dishing out more powerful strikes than her, thoroughly suffered.</p><p>However, facing the blade, Marquis Sword Snow spun as he rotated his sword, incessantly weakening the power of vibration.</p><p>“What a frightening blade artist, and what a frightening sword artist!”</p><p>Everybody was stunned. Be it Lashan Mei’s Demonic Chop or Marquis Sword Snow’s rotatory sword arts, both were too powerful. Moreover, Lashan Mei was the person to exchange the most moves with Marquis Sword Snow. The rest before her had been long defeated by this point.</p><p>‘With my strength, defeating him is impossible. I can only use that move.’ An idea flashed in Lashan Mei’s mind and her gaze turned cold.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>Lashan Mei’s figure shot toward Marquis Sword Snow with her black sword tucked in her waist. Intuition told the latter that her move would be extremely frightening this time. His expression also gravened as he prepared himself to not show the slightest of carelessness.</p><p>“Annihilation Chop!”</p><p>Lashan Mei’s right arm turned indistinct as she abruptly thrust out. Before the blade was even out completely, one could feel the terrifying vibrations that were much higher than the Demonic Chop. Lashan Mei’s right arm turned into countless blood droplets, indicating that her body could not endure such frequency of vibrations.</p><p>Space cracked, and then shattered completely.</p><p>“So exhilarating! Only Life and Death Palace can allow me to use this move with such abandon.” Upon issuing this strike, Lashan Mei’s essence, Qi, and spirit instantly drained away.</p><p>“Freezing Sword Point!”</p><p>Marquis Sword Snow’s had an unprecedented grave look, and his sword was out almost at the same time as Lashan Mei’s. Leaving behind an ice-blue track, it brushed past the Demonic Blade. The excessively strong vibrational power caused its original trajectory, which was at Lashan Mei’s throat, to shift to her left arm.</p><p>Kacha!</p><p>Her left arm immediately froze, the frost quickly spreading to her abdomen and chest. In the next moment, half of her body shattered like an ice sculpture.</p><p>Lashan Mei was defeated!</p><p>On the other hand, Marquis Sword Snow’s left hand had been snapped off from his elbow, dying the ground below him red.</p><p>For the first time, Marquis Sword Snow lost an arm!</p><p>Inside the small chamber, Lashan Mei sighed, “The Annihilation Chop can only be used when Demonic Blade Arts reach perfection. Otherwise, this move would inflict grave injuries on one’s own body, a move damaging the opponent by thousand and oneself by eight hundred. A pity that I still lost! The power in that move was perfectly condensed without the slightest gap. If not for my Demonic Blade Sword, my entire body would have frozen and shattered.”</p><p>“Brilliant, really brilliant!”</p><p>This battle could indeed be called a peak confrontation. Marquis Sword Snow’s sword arts and Lashan Mei’s blade arts indeed left most of the spectators in awe.</p><p>“Vibrational power on one side and compression power on the other…Troublesome!” Ye Chen had been keenly observing the fight. He had already seen Lashan Mei’s Demonic Chop. It contained a frightening destructive power and was like a cutting machine from Ye Chen’s previous world, which could even cut through steel with enough vibrational power. On the other hand, Marquis Sword Snow’s Freezing Sword Move condensed power entirely at the tip of the sword. It was even more restrained than Young Undying Demon Lord’s Chaos Disaster and contained much more destructive power.</p><p>Lashan Mei and Marquis Sword Snow’s battle concluded, leaving behind the last fight of the round twenty four. Everybody looked at the stelle, where two names lit up— Ye Chen against Marquis Sword Star.</p><p>“Heavens, another peak battle! Moreover, both are sword artists this time.”</p><p>“Marquis Sword Star is nominally the number young sword artist of Sky Sword Continent. I’m afraid his strength is not below Marquis Sword Snow’s at all. On the other hand, although Ye Chen seems a bit lacking on the surface, nobody knows what aces he has up his sleeves.”</p><p>“I wonder who will win!”</p><p>“It’s more than likely to be Marquis Sword Star! He is the previous Life and Death Substitute List’s number one. Moreover, his cultivation base is already at the peak of the third layer, which is a big difference from Ye Chen’s.”</p><p>“Right, Ye Chen’s chances seem smaller. As long as he can do better than Lashan Mei, it would be fine. But, if he can’t even injure Marquis Sword Star, then that would be too lackluster.”</p><p>Before one wave could even settle, yet another rose. The battle between Ye Chen and Marquis Sword Star greatly piqued everybody’s interest.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
