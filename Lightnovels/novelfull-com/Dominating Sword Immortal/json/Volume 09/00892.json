Unfortunately, it still ended in vain.”</p><p>“I didn’t expect senior Fire Emperor to already be dead.” Ye Chen had already been curious about the Emperor guarding Eternal Sky Sect. However, he found out today that it was merely a dead man. If this news leaked outside, Eternal Sky Sect would be instantly obliterated. After all, Eternal Sky Sect survived until now only because of the deterrence of a titled monarch.</p><p>“Senior Dragon King, what level was senior Fire Emperor’s strength at?” Ye Chen asked.</p><p>Dragon King replied, “When I last saw him, he was already the number one expert under titled monarchs. Going by his frightening talent that far surpassed mine, I’m afraid that your usual titled monarchs would be no match for him, and his strength should be reaching around the mark of the emperors’ on Emperor Scar Stelle. Moreover, I heard that back in the day when he was still in Eternal Sky Sect, he revealed a peerless move that shook the Blood Sky Continent, and dissuaded even Emperors from making a move on Eternal Sky Sect.”</p><p>“He intimidated the entire Blood Sky Continent with one move?”</p><p>‘Oh right, Senior Battle King once encountered an old man who could condense a fire sphere like sun. It contained the fire profound, water profound, and earth profound, all cultivated to full circle. Although the three profound were not perfectly integrated, its might was so frightening that it could easily destroy a huge star. Could that old man be Fire Emperor? Ye Chen pondered.</p><p>“Come, he should have left behind some kind of message.” Dragon King stepped toward the purple fire sphere, and Ye Chen quickly followed behind. The purple fire sphere had no substance, not offering any resistance as the two walked in.</p><p>Fire Emperor’s head was lowered. He had a pale-white face and closed eyes, and there was not a single trace of vitality coming from his body. However, the passage of time had not left any marks on his body. His flesh was still plump, without a single mark of loosening. The aura coming from his body even caused Ye Chen trouble breathing.</p><p>“His energy has not scattered. His body still contains a frightening might. Don’t try to resist whatever happens, or we’ll either be attacked in return or his body protecting energies would explode, along with everything in its vicinity.” Dragon King warned Ye Chen.</p><p>“Yes.” Ye Chen faintly nodded, not daring to try any inappropriate movements.</p><p>Three jade strips were arranged before Fire Emperor’s body.</p><p>Dragon King picked up one of the jade strip and softly said, “The message he left behind.”</p><p>Following Dragon King infusing it with Zhen Yuan, a forceful but seemingly old voice came out of the jade.</p><p>“I’ll be damned! Even with my six star battle strength, I don’t see a slither of hope of passing the death road. Don’t tell me the heavens truly want to see my True Spirit World die and let these otherworldlings run amok in our world! When will our True Spirit World truly belong to us? When can we live without their suppression? Unfortunately, I can’t live to see that day. My fated kin, I’ve nothing good to give you. The storage ring has a lot of supreme grade materials and a million supreme grade stones. The two jade strips contain my two greatest profound battle skills—Glorious Sun Sky Soaring and Callous Water Fire. Do well to comprehend them. I sincerely hope that you’ll break the suppression of the otherwordlings on our True Spirit World and become the first person to do so since the ancient era, repaying the blood enmity of countless years. Perhaps it’s just my wishful thinking, but it’s still better than despair. However, I’ve grown tired.”</p><p>The voice gradually weakened.</p><p>Ye Chen and Dragon King remained silent for a while. Fire Emperor’s voice was extremely unresigned. It seemed to be an unresignation coming from his very bones, and also from the entire True Spirit World. Such resignation filled his voice with a unique inspiration, so much so that Dragon King and Ye Chen felt choked.</p><p>“Six star battle strength…hehe, but he still can’t pass the death road. I’m afraid I can’t be that lucky. But, I’m already at my limits and have no choice but to try!” Dragon King mumbled.</p><p>Ye Chen again asked, “Senior Dragon King, which star strength are you at?” From the words of Fire Emperor, it was not hard for hjim to decipher that star battle power was a measure for the strength of Life and Death Kings.</p><p>“I’m at five star battle strength. Apart from the old monsters who haven’t appeared in years, the highest we have currently is also five star. Void Emperor, Sky Emperor, and me, all of us are at this level. Of course, five star battle strength also has its stages. Void Emperor is already in the higher stage, and I’m a bit lacking. Little girl Yan has also more or less attained this level.”</p><p>“Void Emperor and Star Emperor have five star battle strength?” Ye Chen frowned. It seemed like low step Kings had one star battle strength, mid stage Kings had two star battle strength, and high stage Kings had three star battle strength. Peak Kings had four star battle strength, and Emperors had five star battle strength. Dragon King broke the limits of peak King, and thus, had five star battle strength. Mysterious Queen was the same.</p><p>‘If Yuan Emperor didn’t die, he should have been much stronger than Fire Emperor, with at least seven star battle strength!’ Ye Chen guessed.</p><p>Dragon King’s next words confirmed Ye Chen’s guesses.</p><p>“Seven star battle strength is the bottom line to leave your mark on the Emperor Scar Stelle, but such an expert has not appeared in several ten thousand years. For that matter, even six star Emperors have been rare. In my more than thousand years of life, there have only been two or three six star battle strength Emperors. Fire Emperor is one of them, and the Undying Ancestor in Desolate Ancient Ground of Sky Martial Region is another one. As for the third, I’m not sure.”</p><p>“However, True Spirit World cannot have no titled monarchs. Thus, the standard for Emperors has been lowered to five star battle strength. Since I rarely reveal my true battle strength, I’m not a titled monarch. Of course, it doesn’t have any meaning to me.” Dragon King willingly explained.</p><p>“Senior Dragon King, Senior Emperor was talking about passing the death road?” Ye Chen couldn’t retain his curiosity.</p><p>Faintly nodding, Dragon King said, “Right.”</p><p>“This death road…have there been experts in the ancient era who have passed it?”</p><p>Seeing Ye Chen asking so many questions, Dragon King figured that holding back would instead distract him even more, “To pass the death road, at least five star battle strength is needed. However, that was the case in the ancient era. After the ancient era, the death road turned into a true death road. You should have some knowledge about the Four Extreme Emperor. He once challenged death road, but ended up suffering grave injuries.”</p><p>“Even Four Extreme Emperor failed?” Ye Chen couldn’t help but suck in a breath of cold air. As an Emperor with his mark on Emperor Star Stelle, his battle strength should be at least seven stars, and even he failed. So, how could Dragon King succeed?</p><p>“Rest assured, the death road has fluctuations. If your luck is extremely good, even a five star expert could succeed. There was one such case a thousand years ago.”</p><p>“Of course, not succeeding is the norm. In any case, even if I don’t try, I’ll die. There is no hope, so I might as well try my luck.”</p><p>Ye Chen faintly nodded. He knew that Dragon King had already decided. If he didn’t try now, his chances would become even lower. A person’s body would increasingly worsen before death. Although Dragon King was in the Life and Death Realm, his body would still be affected somewhat. He might shine gloriously at his moment and surpass his limits, but he would die immediately afterward.</p><p>“I’ll leave the storage ring and profound battle skills for you; Although you cultivate the sword dao, you can derive your own sword arts from Fire Emperor’s profound martial skills.” With a wave of Dragon King’s hand, the storage ring on Fire Emperor’s finger as well as the two jade strips flew and landed in Ye Chen’s palm.</p><p>Ye Chen didn’t decline. He knew that these things were of no use to Dragon King.</p><p>“Hold on for a moment, I’ll cover the leak of this array’s aura. Remember, don’t tell anyone about the death of Fire Emperor, not even anybody from the Eternal Sky Sect. If it gets out, the consequences would be too horrible. Better be careful before you reach Life and Death realm.”</p><p>“I understand.” Ye Chen would naturally not reveal Fire Emperor’s death.</p><p>The two walked out of a purple light sphere. Along with Dragon King’s seals, an astonishing earthen yellow light covered the purple light sphere. A few moments later, the purple sphere was completely shrouded in the earthen yellow light, not leaking a single trace of aura. Even when Ye Chen activated his soul power, he didn’t discover anything. His soul power went directly past the yellow sphere.</p><p>“Alright, let’s head out.” Covering the array, Dragon King grabbed Ye Chen and disappeared. Letting out a sigh, the former imparted his final instructions, “Once the news of my death spreads, Dragon God Celestial Palace will be in for a crisis. Little Yan can’t protect the entire palace with solely her own power. However, I’ve already arranged a secret realm for the true elites of the palace. When you hear the news of the palace’s destruction, don’t act impulsively. As long as there are people, everything can be rebuilt. If there is nobody left, nothing can be protected.”</p><p>Ye Chen didn’t say anything, only feeling his blood boiling.</p><p>“This is a dragon bead to find the secret realm, and it’s much better than the one you have. As for how to enter it, the pearl has all the details. You can master it without wasting much time.”</p><p>Dragon King took out a golden dragon bead and handed it to Ye Chen.</p><p>Ye Chen could feel that its dragon aura was quite similar to Xu Jing’s aura. As soon as he touched the bead, he felt as if he had been connected to some place. However, this connection was too vague. He couldn’t find it with his current realm.</p><p>“I’ll take my leave here. The rest is all up to you.” Dragon King raised his head, his gaze piercing through the depths of the void.</p><p>“Take care, senior!” Ye Chen cupped his fists and bowed.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>In the next moment, Dragon King had already appeared in the boundless starry sky. His gaze flickered before he headed into the depths of the starry sky. Raising his head and straightening his body, Ye Chen sucked in a few deep breaths.</p><p>“My strength is still too weak. Senior Dragon King still held a few secrets from me, fearing that it will make me adventurous and hinder my comprehension of the Life dao.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
