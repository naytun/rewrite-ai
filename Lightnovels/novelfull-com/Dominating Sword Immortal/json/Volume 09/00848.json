More people meant lower efficiency; thus, Ye Chen and Feng Piaoling didn’t team up to hunt Life-and-Death Evil Spirits, and soon went their separate ways.</p><p>The enclosed region had numerous evil spirits; one could even see two or three together at times. There were also a few strange evil spirits; for example, ghost-like evil spirits with no fixed physical form, self-detonating evil spirits, and so on. These evil spirits were not too powerful, but they were exceptionally hard to guard against.</p><p>Rip!</p><p>Sword light flashed through a floating mist like evil spirit. The mist like evil spirit scattered, leaving behind a life-and-death stone floating in the air.</p><p>“Got the second one at last.”</p><p>After separating from Feng Piaoling, Ye Chen had been hunting evil spirits every day for half a month. During this duration, he’d hunted a total of twenty four evil spirits, yet only managed to obtain his second stone just now.</p><p>“To advance into the second layer, two stones are needed. I’ve to find one more, and only then I’ll be confident of my chances.” With a swirl of Zhen Yuan in his palm, Ye Chen swallowed the stone inside his body and pondered. “But, I better look for Life-and-Death Bridges first!”</p><p>Life and Death Bridges which connected the inner area to the core area were only four, which was a lot lower than the bridges connecting the outer area to the inner area.</p><p>En-route, Ye Chen suddenly stopped as he heard an unresigned roar from afar.</p><p>“Why, why….Is it that I can’t enter the Life-and-Death Chamber even with two life-and-death stones? Is my potential really not as good as others?”</p><p>The roar belonged to a young man with an ordinary appearance. His cultivation base was not low, in the late stage of half-step King realm, and his Zhen Yuan was substantially rich.</p><p>Ye Chen shook his head. This was the second time he was seeing such a scene.</p><p>Although every individual here was a peak genius, not all of them could smoothly break through. Apart from a little bit of luck, there was also the problem of foundation not being sufficiently sturdy. Therefore, even though about half of the people obtained Life and Death stones every time the Life and Death Secret Realm opened, the fraction succeeding in breakthrough might not even reach one-fourth.</p><p>After three days, Ye Chen found a Life and Death Bridge leading to the core area, but it was empty. Striding forward, he stepped on the bridge.</p><p>Buzz Buzz….</p><p>Unlike the bridges leading to the inner area, the stone carvings on this bridge were letting out roars, and rippling sound waves bombarded Ye Chen’s body. Apart from carrying a powerful destructive force, these sound waves also brought numbness to the body and made Zhen Yuan unstable. If one were not too careful, they would be shocked by the sound wave and receive an instant injury.</p><p>“I’m afraid it’s extremely hard to cross this bridge without a peak first layer cultivation base. These sound waves are too strong.”</p><p>Ye Chen advanced with great difficulty. In terms of strength, he was obviously not limited to the peak first layer of life-and-death chamber. However, this was his limit as far as cultivation base was concerned. The sound waves emitted by the stone carvings contained Life-and-Death Qi. Energy attacks and Protective Zhen Yuan were useless before these sound waves. Therefore, it had a stringent requirement of cultivation base.</p><p>“Too slow!”</p><p>Relying on his cultivation base, Ye Chen could cross the bridge, but it would cost a lot of Zhen Yuan. Moreover, he didn’t need to go through so much trouble. So, he released his sword domain, and the sound waves were immediately counteracted. Ye Chen’s figure flickered once, shooting across the bridge.</p><p>“That person just now, how could he advance so easily?” A young man was looking at the bridge from afar. Seeing Ye Chen, his face turned doubtful. As far as he knew, even experts on the second layer of Life-and-Death Chamber would not be able to easily cross the bridge. Moreover, even though the third layer experts could cross the bridge easily, they would not be able to directly rush at full speed like he saw just now.</p><p>He had not seen Ye Chen struggling on the bridge before.</p><p>“Don’t tell me that there is something wrong with this bridge?” A look of delight appeared on his face.</p><p>Shua!</p><p>Without any hesitation, his figure shot towards the bridge.</p><p>Buzz Buzz!</p><p>However, merely two sound waves sent him flying back while spurting blood. The powerful vibrations even dismembered his clothes, rendering him completely naked.</p><p>“F*ck, I got baited!” He yelled miserably.</p><p>…</p><p>“Damn, how can the evil spirits here be so powerful!”</p><p>In the core region, one young expert with peak first layer cultivation base got coiled by a snake-shaped evil spirit and was directly sent out of the Life and Death Secret Realm.</p><p>“If I knew before, I wouldn’t have entered the core area!”</p><p>“Too strong, these evil spirits are absurd.”</p><p>Similar scenes were playing out everywhere in the core area. The young experts who suffered were not only at the first layer, but also at the second layer.</p><p>“High level evil spirits?” Upon killing an evil spirit after somewhat exerting himself, Young Eagle Lord mumbled.</p><p>The life-and-death evil spirits had no grades. However, the experts coming here had categorized these evil spirits into four levels—low level evil spirits, mid level evil spirits, high level evil spirits, and peak level evil spirits.</p><p>Low level evil spirits generally appeared in outer area, mid level appeared in the inner area, while high level and peak level ones appeared in the core area.</p><p>Low level and mid level evil spirits were considered weak. As for high level evil spirits, even the weakest had strength equivalent to second layer life-and-death chamber realm, while the powerful had a strength of third layer. Peak level evil spirits were existences that simply couldn’t be dealt with alone. Even experts like Young Elephant Lord and Young Undying Demon Lord would have to immediately flee if they didn’t wish to die in vain.</p><p>There had only been a handful who successfully hunted a peak level evil spirit by themselves in the past thousand years, and Mysterious Queen was one of them.</p><p>“I was careless!”</p><p>Near the center of the core area, an unresigned expression appeared on Li Wujian’s face. His body had been separated from the waist and was rapidly disappearing.</p><p>Not too far behind him, a long-horned human-shaped evil spirit stood towering over him. His appearance was completely clear, and its skin looked like heavy armor. Even if it had wisdom, it couldn’t be considered a lifeform simply because the evil Qi it emitted was too strong.</p><p>In fact, Liu Wujian could have escaped if he was a bit careful, and had immediately fled upon spotting this evil spirit. However, he thought he could sweep through Life-and-Death Mysterious Realm upon entering the second layer with the help of life-and-death stones.</p><p>He was wrong!</p><p>…</p><p>“I almost died!” In another place, Yan Fengfeng let out a sigh of relief while looking far into the distance with a lingering fear. That evil spirit was too powerful. If not for her speed, she would not have been able to escape after engaging that evil spirit.</p><p>…</p><p>“There is something wrong. How are evil spirits so easy to come across this time? Last time, one would only come across a few in the central region of the core area!” Luo Tiandu had a baffled expression on his face.</p><p>“Could it be because the quality of experts this time is too high that the numbers have increased accordingly?” Luo Tiandu guessed.</p><p>…</p><p>“As expected of a high level evil spirit!”</p><p>Ye Chen didn’t need to exert himself at all to kill mid level evil spirits. And although killing high level evil spirits was still easy, it still required a little effort on his part. This was especially true for ghost spirits and self-detonating spirits. Even third layer experts would greatly suffer if they were careless. They were indeed impossible to guard against.</p><p>The core area was quite small. So, even though the number of evil spirits was much lower than the outer region, they were much more concentrated. Along the way, Ye Chen saw many people being killed by high level evil spirits and carried out of Life and Death Secret Realm. All the experts left behind were the absolute elites among elites.</p><p>Confronting two high level evil spirits, Ye Chen pointed out. The Blood Annihilation Sword turned into thirty two sword phantoms and shot out.</p><p>Slash Slash Slash!</p><p>Like a fairy raining down flowers from heaven or a meteor shower of swords, the two high level spirits, which were several li away, were cut thousands of times. and a life-and-death stone was left behind floating in the air.</p><p>“Life and death stone!”</p><p>A dozen li away, two figures were flying across. They sensed the life-and-death Qi emitted by the stone from afar and their eyes brightened.</p><p>“Kid, get lost if you don’t want to die!” One of them roared at Ye Chen.</p><p>Ye Chen completely ignored them as he reached out his hand and made a pulling gesture. A strong attractive force gushed out, and the stone flew across with a swishing sound before landing in his hand.</p><p>“Third!” Ye Chen’s corner of mouth curled up into a smile.</p><p>“You’re courting death!”</p><p>The two were young experts of the second layer while Ye Chen was merely at the first layer. They thought that Ye Chen would be apprehensive of their strength and leave the stone behind. Who knew that he would completely disregard them, not giving them any face!</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>Zhen Yuan erupted around their bodies as they shot toward Ye Chen. However, Ye Chen just coldly stared at the two while standing at his spot.</p><p>Awooo!</p><p>Right at this moment, a wriggling upheaval occurred underneath the ground and a huge wolf-shaped evil spirit emerged from the ground, intercepting the two young experts.</p><p>The evil spirit seemed more like a small mountain. The fur on its body was no different from the real thing, and the evil aura it emitted was almost condensing into substance. It was so dense that high level evil spirits were not even worth mentioning. One could easily imagine the latter being killed instantly.</p><p>“What’s a peak level evil spirit doing here?” The two young experts were appalled; their eyeballs almost popping out.</p><p>“Flee!”</p><p>One of them yelled before the two turned around and flew off, not thinking about confronting the evil spirit even for a second. However, it was to no avail as the evil spirit was much faster than them. Moreover, the distance between the two sides was not much either. In a few breaths, the two were chased down.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>With a swing of its right claw, one of them was cleaved into two. His torso clashed into the other, turning the latter into blood mist. The battle strength of this enormous wolfish evil spirit was above peak third layer realm geniuses without a doubt.</p><p>“This is peak level evil spirit?” Ye Chen sucked in a deep breath and his eyes turned grave.</p><p>Upon killing the two, the evil spirit turned its head and locked its gaze on Ye Chen. Although it had no wisdom, it could feel that Ye Chen was different from the rest. Others would immediately flee upon coming across it. However, Ye Chen didn’t do so.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>The huge wolfish evil spirit’s back limbs bent before it pounced forth.</p><p>There was some information about peak evil spirits out there. Despite his peerless talent, back when Battle King had entered the Life and Death Secret Realm, he had to spend an entire day to kill a peak level evil spirit. One could imagine how powerful and frightening these things were.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
