However, there were no region groups inside the Blood Sky Land, only thirteen different areas in total. The Iron Blood region was one of them, located in the west part of the land.</p><p>The Iron Blood Region was huge, way bigger than the Thunder region inside the true spirit land, but still not as big as the Sky Martial Region. The journey spanned millions of miles, which would be too slow for the flying puppet. So, Ye Chen flew in the sky himself at his normal speed.</p><p>…</p><p>On top of the blood ocean, wind blew heavily while waves scrambled below.</p><p>Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!</p><p>Three blood shadows appeared out of nowhere, looking down from above.</p><p>“I did not expect to hear that the Fifty Robbers Gang, whom we put so much effort into training, were all killed in one day. Have you found out who killed them?”</p><p>The bloody figure in the middle seemed to contain an unbelievable power. It was impossible to tell whether if it was a real body or just a projection.</p><p>A blood shadow with a pair of bent horns said, “I have found out that Full Moon Trade Team left from the Cold Iron City for the Blood Sky Land half a month ago, and they had hired quite a lot of powerful warriors. My people had learned that no one had heard from them since their ambush of the trade team since.”</p><p>“Full Moon Trade Team…Huh!”</p><p>The blood shadow on the right was obviously a female, with a blurry set of blood wings growing on her back. She sneered, “Full Moon Trade Team would never have warriors powerful enough to kill all fifty members of the gang. It must be someone among the hired warriors. As long as we can capture one of them, we can find out the truth.”</p><p>The middle blood shadow nodded, “Do not mess with the Full Moon Trade Team yet. If we attempt to take revenge, it would only break that delicate balance we have right now. But, as long as we catch the warriors who did it, we can do whatever we want. Blood Cow, I will hand this over to you. Do not disappoint me!”</p><p>“Don’t worry, brother!” The blood figure with horns took over the task.</p><p>The blood figure in the middle and that female blood shadow slowly faded away as if they never existed before. Meanwhile, that blood shadow with a pair of horns had his “mouth” cracked open, a bloody red light shooting out from within.</p><p>…</p><p>On his way toward the iron blood region, Ye Chen did not run into many ambushes, since his power was right there at mid rank half step king warrior level, which was powerful enough to let even the craziest killing machine cool down and think twice. There were not many half step king warriors or beast kings inside the Blood Sky Land compared to the true spirit continent. So, it would be impossible for him to run into many of them.</p><p>During his travels, he grew to have a basic understanding of the Blood Sky land.</p><p>The biggest race inside the land was the beast race, so there were mostly beast martial schools here. Amongst them, the top ten beast martial schools were the top ranking institutions. Ranking at second was the human race. It was true that the true spirit continent was always going to belong to the human world. Although there were just as many beasts out there as humans, it was still the human race that took the overall dominance. Even inside the blood sky land, the human power was not weak either.</p><p>Humans living inside the Blood Sky Land were normally training demon arts, rarely training normal martial arts. Even if there did, their martial arts would slowly turn evil with time, because it was just so hard to survive here. Even if one tried to reason with people, the others would be using their fists instead. So, no matter how righteous that person might be, he or she would still start to resent the other person, and a killing intent would appear naturally. With that, the person would be converted to an evil art cultivator.</p><p>The third race comprised of the demi beasts with the bloodline of a beast. There might not be a lot of demi beasts inside the true spirit continent, but they were the third biggest race here, numbering in billions. The top six demi beast families were major forces, way richer than the ones from the demi demon race.</p><p>There were demi demons inside the Blood Sky Land as well, but because there were not many of them, they were all gathered together into their own race. Although their overall power might not be as much as other demi demon races, they would still be way stronger than the demi demons on the true spirit continent.</p><p>The four races would, of course, have their conflicts, and hence continued to battle. However, the beast race in the Blood Sky land was the commonly recognized tyrant. Everyone was slightly scared of them, and would not dare to mess with them.</p><p>Iron Blood Region was inside one of the top ten beast martial schools, the Iron knuckle beast martial school.</p><p>…</p><p>After one week, Ye Chen finally arrived at the Iron Blood region.</p><p>According to Battle King’s memory, Ye Chen knew it clearly that the Immortal Sword Martial School was inside the mysterious iron mountain group here. The mountain group was famous for producing a mysterious iron, and made for the perfect location for a sword art martial school. The outer disciples would then have no concerns about having the right weapons.</p><p>After entering the mountain region, Ye Chen flew at a low height along the empty grounds between the mountains, so that he would be less easy to spot.</p><p>“Hm, there are so many beasts here!” Ye Chen frowned while flying. The mountain range was full of different ranking beasts. Normally, there were not that many beasts around human martial schools. Otherwise, it would be impossible for the outer disciples to go out and about, since it would always be a life and death situation out there.</p><p>“Something does not seem right.” An instinctive feeling rose inside Ye Chen.</p><p>As a half step king warrior, his ability to hide his tracks was very powerful, at least such that it would not be detected by lower ranked beasts. Even if it were some kind of matured rank nine or rank ten beast, it would be impossible for them to see him.</p><p>After crossing many mountains, Ye Chen could sense that he was not that far away from the center of the mountain range.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>He shook his palm, and a massive hole appeared in the mountain close to him. He then flew into the cave and blocked the entrance.</p><p>“Open!”</p><p>The vertical eye in between his eyebrows opened while he closed both of his eyes.</p><p>Inside the silver world, Ye Chen scanned through the surroundings and could see everything within hundreds of miles. Soon, he finally found the martial school that he had been looking for. Once he saw it, he let out a forced chuckle.</p><p>The martial school inside the mountains were not the immortal sword martial school, but actually a school of the beasts. Four massive characters were written on the plate at the front, ‘Beast Wolf Martial School’</p><p>“If this school is here, then where is the Immortal Sword martial school? Perhaps the Beast Wolf martial school has taken over it?” Ye Chen thought that it was rather ironic, since beasts were the main target of hunting inside the true spirit continent, but were actually the owner of the land here. Although, the lower ranked ones were still being hunted, since they did not have very high intelligence.</p><p>“There must be a beast king in there. It would be a pursuit of death.” Letting out a breath, Ye Chen shook the rocks that had been blocking the cave entrance and shot back out.</p><p>…</p><p>Iron Blood City, the main city in the area…</p><p>Inside the city were mainly humans, demi beasts, and demi demons. There were not many full beasts or transformed beasts here. Inside the true spirit continent, beasts would have to train until rank 9 before being able to transform. However, inside the Blood Sky land, it would happen earlier, at only rank 7. According to the rumors, the top beast martial schools inside the land joined forces and created this shapeshifting pellet, which could help the beasts to transform faster. But, beasts above rank 7 could still not compare to the number of humans and demi beasts in the city.</p><p>Taking a glance at the beast person walking past him, Ye Chen thought to himself. After swallowing a wind fire pellet and getting the extreme rank beast power crystal, the dream eating wolf was about to reach half step beast king realm. He continued to wonder if the wolf would be able to transform this time, so that it could travel along with him.</p><p>There were different kinds of beasts out there; some of them were not naturally suitable for transforming, while some of them were born with the ability.</p><p>A Sea of Souls Realm warrior who was cultivating demon arts walked past when Ye Chen asked with his Zhen yuan, “Excuse me! Is there a human martial school called Immortal Sword Martial School around here?”</p><p>This person froze a bit. His eyes landed on Ye Chen, then he suddenly became very humble, “Immortal Sword School? I have never heard of it. I have lived here for many years, but I have never heard of a martial school with that name. Perhaps you have remembered it wrong?”</p><p>“Ah, is that so? Do you perhaps know if there is a place for me to get information here?”</p><p>“Oh yeah! Walk past this street and you will see a pavilion on your right. The name ‘Knowledge Pavilion’ would be written on the door, since it is indeed a place for learning new things. They have got eyes around the world. However, it is a bit expensive. If you are just looking for some normal information, I will say save yourself the trip.”</p><p>What? The knowledge pavilion?</p><p>Ye Chen was utterly shocked. He had no idea that the pavilion had managed to open a branch on this land. Realizing the implications, he started to look serious all of the sudden. He thought that even if the pavilion had a tough background, it would not be able to open a branch in another completely different land. It was indeed a scary group.</p><p>“Welcome to the Knowledge Pavilion! What kind of information are you after?” It was a human elder in there.</p><p>Ye Chen thought about it and asked, “What is the relationship between this pavilion and the one on true spirit continent?”</p><p>The elder chuckled. “We are one and the same. It looks like that you are from the true spirit continent.”</p><p>Ye Chen did not deny as he said, “I would like to understand the story about the Immortal Sword Martial School. I knew it was built around six hundred years ago.”</p><p>“Immortal Sword Martial School…Let me look for it.” The elder took out a book and continued to flip the pages. Soon, he looked up, “This Immortal Sword Martial School was created by the Battle King, right? If it is, then this must be it.”</p><p>“Indeed, you are correct!” Ye Chen looked joyful.</p><p>The elder sighed, “The Immortal Sword School is no longer known by that name, and instead is the called Zhang Tian Party. Zhang Tian is indeed Battle King’s name. As for the ranking, it is now lowered to rank 6.”</p><p>“Where is it?” Ye Chen hurried to ask.</p><p>“One million and three thousand miles away in the west of Iron Blood City is a mountain where the school was located. I will give you a tip—the school is now facing a lot of troubles right now. I suggest you not to sink in it…Otherwise, it would be really hard to get out. You might even face life and death situations.”</p><p>“Thank you, but I have to go!” Ye Chen paid the spirit stones and left the pavilion.</p><p>The second he left, the elder took out a painting which he then opened. It was indeed a portrait of Ye Chen. “The No.1 martial genius of True Spirit Continent, Ye Chen. It is indeed him!”</p><p>It only took Ye Chen one and half days before finding the mountain. From afar, he could see that the mountain seemed to be in a good condition, but it somehow gave out the vibe as if it was about to decay or die all of a sudden.</p><p>“How could it end up so bad? It not only changed its name, but does not look that good either.”</p><p>A martial school normally would accumulate a huge amount of luck and positive energy from the universe. But if one did not have enough of it, it would give out the feel of seemingly lacking something.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
