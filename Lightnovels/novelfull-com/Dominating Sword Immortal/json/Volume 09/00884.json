It really seemed like a dead end; neither could he escape, nor could he fight.</p><p>Of course, if Ye Chen sought Yuan Emperor’s phantom, the problem could be easily solved. However, he was not willing to do that. If he were to seek Yuan Emperor’s phantom at the face of every crisis, he would never be tempered. Yuan Emperor could help him for a while, but not forever. If he wished to seek power, he had to rely on himself. He could not pin his hopes on others.</p><p>“Even if it’s nine deaths out of ten, I have to face it with my own strength. That’s the path to breakthroughs. If it’s completely hopeless, I can ask Yuan Emperor later.”</p><p>This method carried a big danger. Ye Chen might be killed before he could even ask for help. However, if he wished to climb to the very peak, he had to make this situation of teetering between life-and-death a habit.</p><p>On the summit…</p><p>“Fine…this projection has one-third of my original body’s battle strength. Killing a little guy with the strength of an ordinary King would be no trouble.”</p><p>The figure wore a mask that completely concealed his facial features. With a single step, he stepped down the mountain.</p><p>Mantis blood demon was preparing another assault at Ye Chen, but once the masked man appeared, his target changed. As far as he was concerned, the masked man’s aura was much stronger, which he loathed. The wings behind his back rapidly flapped before he transformed into a string and appeared before the masked man.</p><p>“Sad…after losing all your wisdom, what else do you have?” The masked man shook his head and pounded his palm at mantis blood demon.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Amidst flickering fire and lightning, the mantis blood demon flew back even faster than he’d come. Its two sickle-like limbs were thoroughly shattered, and a huge hole had opened at its chest, giving off black smoke.</p><p>“Such powerful profound! His thunder profound and fire profound are both above ninety percent completion. I’m afraid it’s nearing greater completion.” Ye Chen’s pupils shrank. In the past, he’d always been the one holding the advantage in terms of profound, suppressing his opponents. However, this time, he was facing an opponent with ten folds more powerful profound battle skills than his.</p><p>Leisurely flying over, the masked man sized Ye Chen and said, “A pity, a peerless genius is going to drop here by my hands.”</p><p>“Who are you?” Ye Chen, who had already recovered from his injuries, asked coldly.</p><p>“You’ll never be able to guess my identity. Moreover, you have no need to know. What use is the truth for a dead man? Die!” The masked man acted whilst speaking. He thrusted his palm forth, surrounded in swirling fire and lightning.</p><p>This move again!</p><p>Ye Chen’s pupils shrunk into two dots. Raising the Evil Shattering Sword at his chest with left hand and obliquely thrusting out Sky Scorpio Sword with right hand, Ye Chen madly worked the two great sword souls in his Sea of Soul. A storm of sword intent erupted as the Destruction Sword Intent and Immortal Sword Intent collided together, giving off sword intent ripples. The ripples of sword intent reinforced Sky Scorpio Sword while Immortal Sword intent reinforced the Evil Shattering Sword.</p><p>Destruction Sword Intent, Offense.</p><p>Immortal Sword Intent, Defense.</p><p>At this moment, Ye Chen used both the two great sword intent together to battle for the first time.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Ye Chen’s assault was Congealing Water, but it was instantly burned into nothingness from the fire lightning energy. The latter, like a hot knife cutting through butter, smashed into Evil Shattering Sword, giving off sparks and lightning snakes.</p><p>Almost the same moment, every single internal organ in Ye Chen’s body sustained damage. All the ribs at his chest snapped while his two arms exploded into nothingness. In the next moment, he bled out of every orifice while flying off into the distance. Sky Scorpio Sword and Evil Shattering Sword fell from the sky.</p><p>‘Too powerful! So, this is a mid-step King?’ Despite spending every tool in his arsenal, Ye Chen was completely suppressed.</p><p>“A supreme grade sword…not bad.”</p><p>Seeing the Sky Scorpio Sword, the masked man stretched his hand out.</p><p>“Return!”</p><p>Following Ye Chen’s soul power, the two swords turned into two beams of light and flew toward him. Grabbing empty air in his hand, a cold light flickered in the masked man’s eyes.</p><p>Flying in the air, Ye Chen had already activated his Undying Body, restoring his arms and broken organs. Last time, he’d lost thirty percent of his Zhen Yuan against Poison Fire King to restore his arms and organs. However, this time, he’d to spend forty percent of his Zhen Yuan, and this was when Congealing Water had reduced the power of incoming attack. If he had faced the attack directly, he would have been dead for sure.</p><p>“To take my move without dying is simply a miracle. You’ve really surprised me.” The masked man was indeed amazed. Mantis blood King was stronger than Ye Chen, but the former died instantly. How could he not be surprised?</p><p>“However, you’re still dead. If one strike is not enough, two should do the job.” The masked man stepped forth, thrusting his palm second time.</p><p>“Destruction Sword Intent, evolve for me!”</p><p>With sixty percent Zhen Yuan in his body, he could take another hit and survive, but what about the third time? Not to mention twenty percent Zhen Yuan would not be enough to heal injuries, even after cultivating Great Poison Conversion Art to smaller completion, twenty percent Zhen Yuan was the bottom line to suppress Star Fire Poison. Once his Zhen Yuan went under twenty percent, the masked man didn’t need to even lift his palm, as the strange star poison inside his body would cook his body from the inside by itself.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>Buzz! Buzz!</p><p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p><p>In his Sea of Soul, Destruction Sword Intent and Immortal Sword Intent shone upon each other, resonating with each other. The two halos erupted simultaneously, lighting up the greater part of his Sea of Soul.</p><p>Right before the fire lightning energy, Destruction Sword Soul suddenly shook, its radiance erupting forth. Its body turned into a peerless sword like a blade gaining its edge. A peerless sword intent erupted out of Destruction Sword, transmitting to Sky Scorpio Sword and then to Congealing Water facing the fire lightning energy.</p><p>Sixth step Destruction Sword Intent unleashed its full might!</p><p>Puff!</p><p>Frightening energy blasts erupted at the collision of Congealing Water sword energy and lightning fire energy, instantly turning the nearby mountains into nothingness.</p><p>“What? impossible!” The masked man blankly stared ahead. The sword intent released by Ye Chen actually made him feel fear. “It’s a sixth step Destruction Sword Intent. His Destruction Sword Intent evolved!”</p><p>Every step evolution of sword intent increased its might by several folds, especially in the higher steps. The difference between fifth step and sixth step was more than five folds, and the difference between sixth and seven step was ten folds.</p><p>However, Ye Chen possessed the Destruction Sword Intent, which had been equivalent to an ordinary sixth step intent. Now that it had evolved, its might had increased by entire ten folds.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
