I am afraid you don’t have what it takes.” Sword Realm Artist was ranked fourth on the life and death realm substitute warriors list, and his cultivation had already reached the third level realm. Combining with the Sword Realm power, even warriors at the third level of life and death challenge would be killed by him. Ye Chen’s cultivation was at the same level as Feng Piaoling, so it would already be impressive for him to handle three attacks.</p><p>“Really?” Ye Chen sounded extremely calm and relaxed.</p><p>“I can tell that you are also a sword artist. Then, bring it on! Otherwise, you will not even have the chance to take out your sword.” The Sword Realm Artist could feel Ye Chen’s sword intent, which was indeed very powerful. Perhaps, it was where Ye Chen got his confidence from, he thought. But unfortunately, no matter how powerful the sword intent was, it would be hard to make up the gap between cultivation and attacking style.</p><p>Spirit Sword Attack!</p><p>The distance between them was still at least one hundred meters, but Ye Chen’s spirit sword could ignore the distance within hundreds of meters. The second the Evil Shattering sword was waved out, a hair-string-sized sword qi was already approaching the Sword Realm Artist. A pitch-black hole appeared in the mid air and the circle landed on to Sword Realm Artist’s protective Zhen yuan.</p><p>Swoosh! With that, his protective Zhen yuan was punctured through.</p><p>“What!”</p><p>Sword Realm Artist was shocked. Ye Chen’s sword attack was not only at its fastest speed, to the extent that it could no longer be traced anymore, what was even more horrifying was that this sword seemed to have punctured through space. Such horrifying attacking power would obviously surprise him.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Right then, the Sword Realm Artist knew that he had underestimated Ye Chen. Compared to Feng Piaoling, Ye Chen was way too powerful, as even space was punctured through by him. He did not have the time to use the Sword Realm, so he pointed out his right index finger. The tip of his finger shone with a silver light, as if it had been made with a kind of metal, and landed heavily onto those string-like sword qi.</p><p>Ye Chen squinted his eyes. This Sword Realm Artist was indeed the top sword artist of the Heaven Sword Land as he was even able to stop the Spirit Sword Attack in advance. Of course, it also had something to do with the distance. If he were close up, then he would not be able to block this attack for sure unless he was as fast as the former.</p><p>Chin!</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>The fingertip touched the sword qi and fire sparks had appeared in the air. Then, a bloody hole appeared on the fingertip, with blood pouring out.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Sword Realm Artist could sense that a wave of extremely horrifying invisible sword qi had poured into his body through the fingertip. Although the sword qi would not be able to wound him severely once it got inside his body, he would definitely suffer some serious internal wounds and his battling power would be decreased for sure. It was not something he would like to see, and he was starting to regret it now, knowing that he should not have been reckless.</p><p>Thinking all that, he backed out immediately. His right hand grabbed onto his right arm while his Zhen yuan vibrated in the air. The sword qi was pushed out quickly, leaving it no time to do any damage.</p><p>Although he did not use his Sword Realm due to recklessness, that finger attack just now was one of his proudest attacks. It was called the Silver Light Broken Gold Finger, which although was not a profound sense martial art but a mid rank Heaven Realm secret art. It was very powerful, but Ye Chen’s sword attack was obviously even more powerful, which had taken away all of his advantages.</p><p>“Pretty impressive finger attack!” Ye Chen was rather surprised.</p><p>Although the power of the Spirit Sword Attack was not as powerful as his Waning Moon or Bewitching Mirror Flower Attack, it was not something that normal people could resist. And the fact that Sword Realm Artist was able to cancel out the Spirit Attack with half of his power would definitely be because of his finger art.</p><p>“Very well! I admit that I have underestimated your power. You are indeed more powerful than Feng Piaoling.” He waved his hand and four top rank great swords floated in front of him as he said one word at a time.</p><p>“Bring your full power! Otherwise, the battle will be ending very soon.”</p><p>To be honest, Ye Chen was actually rather happy that his opponent was actually powerful. For the longest time, he had never seen anyone who had used the Sword Realm as a part of attacks. Although the Heaven Sword Artist from True Spirit Continent had used Sword Realm before as well, but it used energy as the core, and did not contain the Defensive sword spell or the Sword Realm profound, so it was really quite different.</p><p>“How reckless!” The Sword Realm Artist was furious. It was only him looking down on people before, and had not expected that he would be looked down upon today. He decided that he would use his Sword Realm to slowly torture Ye Chen instead of giving him a quick death.</p><p>Thinking that, he pointed out his sword finger and groaned.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>Four swords, with one being in the front and three in the back, were surrounded by blue tornados as they moved toward Ye Chen at an extreme speed. This Sword Realm not only contained the power of Sword Realm, but also his powerful sword intent.</p><p>“Twenty-seven swords!”</p><p>Ye Chen was still relaxed as he also pointed out his finger and the Broken Blood Sword automatically emerged from around his waist. It then split into twenty-seven beams of sword light as well and attacked the incoming attack.</p><p>“He can also use the defensive sword spell!” The Sword Realm Artist was also surprised. “Fortunately, my sword spell combined with the Sword Realm can increase its power and speed by many times, so normal defensive sword spells cannot compete with it at all.” The Sword Realm Artist was also a warrior with a talent in soul power. Of course, his soul was only twice as powerful as normal people, which could not compete with Ye Chen. But even so, it was enough to be proud already.</p><p>Pap! Pop! Pap! Pop!</p><p>The Wind’s Sword Realm clashed with the twenty seven sword shadows and countless sword light beams appeared out nowhere. The sharp sword qi shattered many areas of the valleys, making a mess out of the whole place.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>No matter how hard the Sword Realm Artist had thought about it, he could not figure out why his Sword Realm could not compete with Ye Chen’s defensive sword spell. He naturally knew the power of the defensive sword spell since he had started training that first as well before moving onto the Sword Realm.</p><p>Pap!</p><p>Since one Sword Realm could not compete with Ye Chen’s attack, four more top rank swords appeared in front of the Sword Realm Artist. With that, another Sword Realm attack shot out, colliding with the remaining dozens of sword shadows.</p><p>After calling back eight top rank swords, the Sword Realm Artist was looking at Ye Chen differently. He knew that his opponent’s power was way different than he had imagined, and could not be measured by normal standards.</p><p>“Wind Sword Realm is only my weakest one…Let’s see how you are going to block out my tornado Sword Realm!”</p><p>Chin Chin! The Sword Realm Artist’s storage ring stored countless top rank great swords. A light flashed on the surface of the storage ring and another eight top rank swords appeared. They were just like the ones form before, containing the wind element. It meant that they could perfectly bring out the wind element Sword Realm’s power to the extreme.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>With sixteen swords forming into a ten times more complex Sword Realm, it attacked out like a wave of tornado, filling the space around Ye Chen with an intense sword qi.</p><p>“Thirty-nine Sword Attacks!”</p><p>Although Ye Chen’s accomplishment on defensive sword spell was not something unprecedented, at least no one had managed to achieve beyond him so far. Situ Hao, who had exchanged the spell, had only managed to shoot out nineteen swords together so far.</p><p>Thirty-nine sword shadows were shot out at a speed that was not slower than the tornado Sword Realm.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The power of the tornado Sword Realm should not be underestimated, and the two were fighting rather equally. The tornado Sword Realm and thirty nine sword shadows both shattered together, following which the great swords flew back to where they came from.</p><p>‘How far ahead did this guy train his defensive sword spell?’ The Sword Realm Artist had a bad look on his face. He did not think about wasting all of his efforts on training the defensive sword spell, so he moved onto something else after reaching the state of twenty-five swords. However, it was already a rather good achievement. Moreover, the Sword Realm was not as demanding as the defensive sword spell, since it was a unity. After mastering the skill to shoot out twenty five swords at the same time, he could learn any type of Sword Realms.</p><p>However, after looking at the sixteen swords in front of him now, the Sword Realm Artist seemed to be embarrassed. Amongst these great swords, a couple of them had been slightly damaged and their power had decreased. Furthermore, the top rank great swords inside his storage ring were still not infinite. They were all collected by him personally over the past years.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>He put away all of the great swords before taking a deep breath. Thirty-six beams of thunder light flashed and appeared soon afterward.</p><p>“This is my most powerful Sword Realm, the Thunder Sword Realm. If what you performed was all you have got, then you will die very soon without a doubt.” The Sword Realm Artist said with a cold look on his face.</p><p>“I have told you, bring your best power. Otherwise, the battle will finish very soon indeed.”</p><p>“You are looking for death.”</p><p>The Sword Realm Artist yelled in a low voice as the thunder element swords formed into a Sword Realm immediately. As the realm was slowly being formed, a huge cloud of thunder and lightning gathered together as well. After being strengthened by the Sword Realm, his power increased slowly. Meanwhile, the sword light in front continued to pour out, breaking down the space ahead.</p><p>“Look! There is an epic battle happening over there!”</p><p>“It is the Sword Realm Artist! Who is the other person though?”</p><p>The battle had attracted two people nearby who were both sword artists, and their sword aura was quite potent as well. If people who knew them were here, then they would have recognized them as the Massive Sword Artist and Short Sword Artist.</p><p>“It is Ye Chen!”</p><p>“I didn’t expect to meet the most legendary sword art genius from the True Spirit Continent here.”</p><p>Over on the other side, another three people appeared as well. They were from True Spirit Continent, and they were just like Luo Tiandu, Feng Piaoling and Ji Hairuo, who were the top warriors from the older generation of young martial geniuses. As for the reason that they could recognize Ye Chen was because they had seen a portrait of him before.</p><p>“It does not look like a good situation there. Ye Chen’s opponent is the Sword Realm Artist, who is ranked four on the life and death realm substitute list! Even if it were disciple Luo, he might not be able to win against him, and Ye Chen is still weaker after all.” The rather bulky looking young man frowned.</p><p>“Indeed! But, Ye Chen was able to push him to perform his Thunder Sword Realm, so he must be really powerful already. What he is lacking now is just cultivation I think.”</p><p>The three of them all had their concerns.</p><p>“Haha, this guy is indeed impressive! Unfortunately, Sword Realm Artist’s thunder Sword Realm is his most powerful Sword Realm. I am afraid that this brat might be killed with that attack alone.” Massive Sword Artist held his chin and chuckled.</p><p>“Aren’t those old friends of True Spirit Continent? Wait until Sword Realm Artist kills that brat. We cannot let them go.”</p><p>Over the valley, the Sword Realm Artist was a couple miles away from Ye Chen.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>He pointed out his sword finger and the thunder light exploded, attacking toward Ye Chen. The whole world was dyed a dark blue color and a lightning flashed once.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
