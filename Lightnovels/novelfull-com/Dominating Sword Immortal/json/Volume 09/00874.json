You be careful, Ye Chen!” Ye Chen and Lashan Mei were the only two people left on Desolate Mountain Range. Seeing that his Zhen Yuan had almost recovered, Lashan Mei took her leave.</p><p>“Alright! If you need my help in future, just say the word.” Stopping the Zhen Yuan crystal refining, Ye Chen said sincerely.</p><p>Lashan Mei smiled, “Certainly!” She didn’t need his help at the moment, but she might in future.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>Having finished conversing, she turned into a black rainbow and disappeared into the horizon. Seeing off her figure with his eyes, Ye Chen turned and looked into the direction of Sky Tiger Sect. He could be wrong—when he was battling Giant Wolf King, he always felt as if he were being watched. Moreover, it was not just by one person. However, it didn’t seem to be done out of malice, and it even felt a bit cordial to him.</p><p>“Many thanks!” Ye Chen said out loud and headed to Eternal Sky Sect.</p><p>…</p><p>Eternal Sky Sect, grand palace’s plaza…</p><p>At that moment, Ye Chen landed silently.</p><p>“Supreme Elder!” The sect disciples passing by greeted him one after another.</p><p>“Elder Ye has has returned after three months. I wonder what is the supreme elder’s rank?” The disciples chatted.</p><p>“Elder Ye easily defeated Linghu Yi. He should have no trouble getting in the top twelve, or even better.”</p><p>“My guess is top ten. Don’t you see how frightening elder Ye’s aura has become after three months.”</p><p>“It should be top twelve. Top ten seems too hard. Don’t you know just Blood Sky Continent has eight beast lords and four demons, while other continents have stunning geniuses as well? Top ten is too hard.”</p><p>Ye Chen deliberately didn’t hide his aura, alarming all Sea of Soul realm experts of the sect. Whether they were cultivating, attending a meeting, or in seclusion, all of them rushed over.</p><p>“Elder Ye!”</p><p>“Congratulations Elder Ye for your safe return!”</p><p>They were led by the sect leader of Eternal Sky Sect, Li Changfeng.</p><p>Ye Chen smiled, “Has the sect been well during these three months?”</p><p>Li Changfeng said, “Thanks to elder Ye, nobody came to disturb the sect during these months. The spirit vein is also almost emptied out.”</p><p>“That’s good!”</p><p>The three great sects suffered grievous losses, and thus were unable to take advantage of his absence even if they wanted to.</p><p>‘Elder Ye, the Life and Death Secret Realm has closed. With your strength, you should have made it into the rankings, right?” Seeing no melancholy or gloom on Ye Chen’s face and his aura, which had become several times more frightening, Li Changfeng knew that Ye Chen’s trip must have been smooth, and thus asked the question on everybody’s mind.</p><p>“You can take it as first…I’ll go into seclusion for a few days.” Ye Chen’s body flickered, heading toward his summit.</p><p>Ye Chen’s departure was as smooth as a floating feather, but the listeners were dumbstruck.</p><p>‘You can take it as first?’</p><p>It was still first, no?</p><p>Hiss!</p><p>Including Li Changfeng, everybody was tongue-tied.</p><p>The eight beast lords, four demons, and the peerless geniuses of other continents had all been beaten by Ye Chen. This was simply a world-shaking news. Gaining that realization, Eternal Sky Sect erupted!</p><p>Returning to his summit, Ye Chen immediately went into seclusion. Although his cultivation base was indeed at the third layer of life-and-death chamber, his body was not used to such explosive increase, and his cultivation base was still unstable. Hence, he had to spend a few days to stabilize his cultivation base.</p><p>Seven days passed by in a flash, and Ye Chen smoothly ended his seclusion.</p><p>‘The third layer is indeed quite mystical. It allows you to see through the reincarnation cycle of heaven and earth, but it’s too unclear.’</p><p>Reaching life-and-death chamber realm was actually about making contact with the Life dao and Death dao, since one’s body would already have the life-and-death aura. One’d just not be able to understand or use it.</p><p>Dugu Jue was able to make huge progress precisely because he had understood a trace of death dao. And the fifth strike, Meteor Fall, of Marquis Sword Star was the same.</p><p>“No hurries! I’ll grasp both life dao and death dao, but not now. I have to forge upper grade swords now.”</p><p>Even if the cultivation base of his body increased by leaps and bounds, he couldn’t ignore the cultivation base of his sword dao. The process of forging a sword was also a process of self-reflection, a continuous cycle of breaking and reforming oneself.</p><p>…</p><p>The news of Ye Chen being undefeated throughout his journey in the secret realm and finally obtaining the first rank spread out to all three continents and oceans, stunning everybody. Their astonishment was not because he was undefeated, but because of his age. According to the information spreading around, he was not even over thirty, and was actually the youngest of them all.</p><p>Not even thirty, and ranked first on Life and Death Substitute List!</p><p>“Is it another Mysterious Queen?”</p><p>No!</p><p>Ye Chen was Ye Chen, not anybody’s shadow.</p><p>He was unrivalled because of his opponents. Marquis Sword Snow and Marquis Sword Star both were monstrous geniuses that would have been unrivalled. However, since they were born in the same generation as Ye Chen, they were defeated. As for who amongst Ye Chen and Xu Jing was truly number one, it was still a matter of countless debates. However, it was a debate that didn’t have much significance. The two were lovers, and thus, were determined to stun the world in the future together.</p><p>The True Spirit World was shaken inside out. However, the Blood Sky Continent was trembling.</p><p>Giant Wolf King lost, the supreme elder of White Wolf Sect, had lost! And he didn’t lose to a Life and Death King or Beast Bing, but a young man in the third layer of life-and-death chamber, the same young man who claimed the first rank on Life and Death Realm Substitute List.</p><p>To defeat Giant Wolf King with the cultivation base of third layer, such an achievement had not been made in tens of thousands of years. Perhaps Mysterious Queen could have defeated an ordinary King if she had a supreme grade weapon, but it never happened. However, such a thing had indeed happened now.</p><p>Soon, Ye Chen’s name blew up in Blood Sky Continent. With the speed this matter was spreading out in Blood Sky Continent, perhaps it wouldn’t be long before his name made it to other continents as well.</p><p>Just like the Mysterious Queen, his name would be known to everybody under the heavens.</p><p>…</p><p>“Ye Chen…You sure it’s him?” In an underground palace, three blood shadows were standing in a triangle. The blood shadow with the strongest aura said to the shadow with a curved horn.</p><p>The latter faintly nodded, “The description matches by eighty-ninety percent.”</p><p>“Eternal Sky Sect hasn’t fallen in five hundred years…it’s a bit strange. Don’t make a move for the time being.” The lead blood shadow said.</p><p>“We’re letting him off?” The feminine blood shadow in the rear asked in a puzzled manner.</p><p>“Don’t be rash! We don’t have enough survivability in this world yet. We’ve always concealed ourselves in the shadows. But once we leave the dark and appear under the sun, we’ll lose all our standing and attract the powerful experts of this world. Of course, they’re already vigilant, as if they have already felt our existence.” The leading blood shadow calmly said.</p><p>“But he is a big threat, and he hasn’t matured yet.” The feminine blood shadow seemed unwilling.</p><p>“Rest reassured, we can’t let off any threat. That Battle King is the example, and that woman named Mysterious Queen is a costly mistake that can’t be fixed. From here on, let our ambassadors handle it!”</p><p>“Those ambassadors are too weak. Although Life and Death Kings are regarded as powerful in this world, they are the weakest of them.”</p><p>“Hehe!” The lead blood shadow smiled, “Powerful experts like Mysterious Queen won’t be controlled by us, but the weak have their own advantage. They won’t easily arouse suspicion.”</p><p>“So, should I let them go kill him?” The horned blood shadow asked.</p><p>The lead blood shadow faintly shook its head, “Don’t lose patience. I don’t want another mistake. More importantly, our most important task is to release the Curse Lords as well as the Terror Lords. Once we release their seals, we will no longer have to hide in the shadows, and we can openly breathe the air of this world.”</p><p>“But, those seals are too strong even after countless years.” The feminine blood shadow spoke with exhaustion.</p><p>“No need to hurry. As early as a hundred years and as late as a few thousand years, those seals will ultimately come off.” The lead blood shadow also seemed a bit tired.</p><p>Suddenly, the horned blood shadow said, “Perhaps we don’t need to act. He has already offended a lot of powers of this world.” He was speaking about Ye Chen.</p><p>The feminie blood shadow spoke with disdain, “This world will never unite.”</p><p>“Wrong, you’re both wrong.” The lead blood shadow said gravely, “If this world were peaceful, that would be our fortune. Strong are born from slaughter. Just like parasites, the strong devour the weak, and the final powerhouse can make for all the weak and more.”</p><p>“Alright! Horn Demon, you continue to observe that human kid, but don’t make any rash moves.”</p><p>“Yes!” The horned blood shadow nodded.”</p><p>“Meeting adjourned!” The lead blood shadow slackened, as if all its power had been sucked out.</p><p>…</p><p>Clang Clang Clang…!</p><p>Metal pounding sounds rang out one after another.</p><p>This was a flaming underground cave. The flames were giving off a blazing heat, inside which, a young man was pounding an iron hammer on the sword embryo placed on the casting furnace. With every strike of the hammer, the sword embryo was becoming sharper and looking more threatening.</p><p>For an entire month, Ye Chen had been wholeheartedly forging upper grade swords. He could feel that forging was also a kind of cultivation, a cultivation of experience.</p><p>After pounding the hammer uncountable times, his spirits were soaring. Every swing of his hammer exuded the immortal power of his body.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The sound never dispersed, echoing indefinitely, as if imperishable. The sword underneath, which was still being forged, exuded a power of immortality that far surpassed any sword Ye Chen had created before. One could only imagine the might of this sword once it was finished.</p><p>“Fifth step Immortal Sword Soul finally formed!” Letting down the hammer, a gleam of understanding appeared on Ye Chen’s face.</p><p>Why was immortality called immortality?</p><p>In reality, immortality was a kind of consciousness, and not a physical entity.</p><p>As soon as Ye Chen’s fifth step immortal sword soul formed, the fifth step destruction sword soul began trembling. The two great sword souls finally resonated—a resonance of destruction and immortality. Under this resonance, Ye Chen’s cultivation suddenly reached the full circle, attaining the peak of the third layer.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
