A trillion miles in that direction was a place Battle King once visited, and that was precisely the reason he had come to Southern Ocean. He wished to see if everything was the same as he’d seen in Battle King’s memories.</p><p>The night passed, and Murong Qingcheng had already branded her soul imprint on the Purple Flame Demonic Gloves. At this moment, the pair of gloves was flickering with a purple flame, which was the glove’s own power and was highly corrosive.</p><p>Along the outline of the purple flames, a dim black circular vein floated as well. This dark halo was the manifestation of the dark power, which would allow a dark-attributed martial artist to greatly amplify its effect. As for how big this amplification was, it could only be tested through battle.</p><p>A thousand li behind them, a dark light stream streaked across. Its speed was such that even describing it as lightning was not enough.</p><p>“What’s mine will be mine.” Amidst the dark radiance, Darklight King’s face was devoid of any expression.</p><p>Boom! His speed once again increased, the flickering light seeming like a star hopping about.</p><p>“He’s here!” Ye Chen sensed the powerful shockwave coming from behind him. Turning around, he and Murong Qingcheng stood in wait.</p><p>Whiz!</p><p>A black light flickered, and Darklight King arrived ten li across them.</p><p>“You sure have the guts to not use your full speed.” The Darklight King was somewhat astounded. There was not too much of a difference between the speeds of half-step Kings usually. Although he had the confidence to catch up to them eventually, he didn’t expect to do so quickly.</p><p>“Why would we? We were expecting you, after all. Fortunately, you didn’t disappoint.” Ye Chen said indifferently.</p><p>“Impudent!” Blacklight King was enraged by Ye Chen’s attitude, and the dark light surrounding his body erupted forth like a huge black sun. The powerful shockwaves created enormous waves on the ocean down below.</p><p>“Ye Chen, let me!” Murong Qingcheng strode out.</p><p>“Sounds good! A perfect opportunity for you to try out the Shadow Armor and Purple Flame Demonic Gloves.” Ye Chen faintly nodded.</p><p>With the Shadow Armor, Murong Qingcheng could even stand invincible before a veteran ‘strongest’ half-step King, while her offensive power had surpassed the vast majority of half-step King with the Purple Flame Demonic Gloves, and could rival that of the ‘strongest’ half-step Kings. When these two factors were combined, even Ye Chen couldn’t guess how strong she really was. This was because even he himself had yet to exchange blows with a ‘strongest’ half-step King in an all-out fight.</p><p>“Hehe, you’re sending your woman to death. Don’t think I won’t be able to do anything to her because she has the Shadow armor and Purple Flame Demonic Gloves. You will never be able to understand the power of a ‘strongest’ half-step King.” Darkflame King laughed in spite as the black light around him turned even more intense, becoming dazzling. A black light arc swept through hundreds of li of the surroundings.</p><p>“The fight is about to begin.” A thousand li away, a lot of people were rushing over, including Huang Mei, Yue Lingshuang, Red Flame King, head steward, and some half-step Kings who knew what was about to happen. Huang Mei was the quickest; her yellow light beam covered more than a hundred li with every flicker. Red Flame was next; covered in flames, he seemed like a dazzling meteorite streaking across.</p><p>The head steward came with a crew of four other half-step Kings, and his thoughts were anybody’s guess. Their speed was exceptional, indicating that all of them were first rate half-step Kings. Meanwhile, Yue Lingshuang didn’t push her speed to the limit as she flew along with Yue Bingxin, heading straight toward the black sun.</p><p>“Sister-in-law, hurry up!” Yue Bingxin was anxious, continuously increasing her speed.</p><p>“I’m going as fast as you!” Yue Lingshuang smiled bitterly. She put her arm across Yue Bingxin’s shoulder and a silvermoon whitefox’s phantom suddenly appeared her.</p><p>Swish! Her speed suddenly doubled, seemingly streaking across the void and looking terrifying.</p><p>A group of twenty people shot towards the battle scene one after another. The three at the battle scene also sensed their arrival and all glanced in that direction.</p><p>“We forgot about Yue Bingxin.” Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng had left in a hurry. They had met Yue Bignxin in the auction, but didn’t meet her before leaving.</p><p>“Young master Ye, this person is too strong. Let my sister-in-law help you!” From afar, Yue Bingxin’s Zhen Yuan transmission entered Ye Chen’s ears.</p><p>“Many thanks for your kind intentions, but it’s not necessary.” Ye Chen mildly declines her.</p><p>Yue Bingxin said anxiously, “Strongest’ half-step Kings are not as simple as you think. They have already refined their bone marrow with Zhen Yuan.”</p><p>One could attain the half-step King realm by refining blood channels with Zhen Yuan. When all three kinds of blood channels had been filled with Zhen Yuan, one could then channel Zhen Yuan into the bone marrow. Once this step was accomplished, the Zhen Yuan would turn incomparably rich and pure in comparison to before. At this point, be it martial skills or soul, everything attained a new height, making one fall in the ‘strongest’ half-step King category.</p><p>“I know.” How could Ye Chen not know the superiority of ‘half-step Kings? Merely the disparity of Zhen Yuan required extraordinary means to be supplemented.</p><p>“Then why?” Yue Bingxin couldn’t understand.</p><p>“Bingxin, let me talk to him.” Yue Lingshuang held Yue Bingxin back and spoke to Ye Chen, “Young master Ye, perhaps you have some understanding of ‘strongest’ half-step Kings. But as one myself, it can’t surpass mine. Refining bone marrow is quite basic. Our souls might be a bit stronger, but nothing considerable. In terms of martial skills, I’ve heard that you don’t lose out one bit, and are quite likely even surpass us, but…”</p><p>Yue Lingshuang’s words took a turn, “Strongest’ half-step Kings is merely a collective term. Attaining this realm means that one is already in the first layer of life-and-death chamber. The so-called life-and-death chamber is precisely the bridge to Life and Death realm. It has three layers…When one attains the third layer, they become a King. However, attaining the first layer is simple, but the second is extremely challenging. Thus, the difference between the first and second layer is not small. If my guess is not wrong, Blacklight King has already attained the second layer a year ago. He is a lot stronger than the first layer ‘strongest’ half-step Kings.</p><p>“Then which layer are you on, Senior?” Ye Chen asked.</p><p>The latter said, “I’m currently on the first layer, but with the bloodline of Silvermoon Whitefox, contending against a second layer half-step King will not be hard for me.”</p><p>“I thank senior for kind intentions, but Murong and I are confident in our battle against Darklight. Just enjoy the show!” With Battle King’s memory, there was practically nothing about the cultivation world that Ye Chen didn’t know. However, Murong Qingcheng with her demonic power and dark force field, coupled with the two newly gained artifacts, might not be at a disadvantage battling against Darklight King, much less to speak of him.</p><p>“Yi, fine! I know the young are haughty. Perhaps you really need to suffer a loss.” Yue Lingshuang shook her head and didn’t reply. She was waiting for them to suffer a loss and help at a crucial moment.</p><p>“Young master Ye, lady Murong, be very careful!”</p><p>Even though Yue Binxing asked for sister-in-law’s help, she still had faith in the two. She faintly felt that Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng might really surprise them.</p><p>“Ye Chen, lady Murong, I believe you’ll surely make Darklight King pay a huge price.” Unlike Yue Lingshuang, Huang Mei knew the two well. These two could no longer be considered humans. Of course, Murong Qingcheng was already a non-human, and thus, her strength could still be explained. However, Ye Chen was still technically classified as a human. It was simply absurd!</p><p>“Hehe!” Ye Chen chuckled.</p><p>A few moments later, the remaining people arrived one after another and stopped at a considerable distance.</p><p>“If Darklight King battles one against two, his chances are not hundred percent, but seventy-eighty percent. Who knows what the real strength of these two is?”</p><p>There was nobody ordinary amongst the spectators, and they all had good eye-sight. Although Darklight King was a ‘strongest’ half-step King, his opponents also had pseudo supreme grade artifacts. Who knew if they had way more than two of them! Therefore, they were excited about the bustle on one hand, and on the other hand, they were looking to fish in troubled waters themselves.</p><p>Licking his lips, the Darklight King smiled grimly, “I haven’t killed in a while. I’ll let the two of you have a taste of my strength.” Hardly anybody knew that he’d attained the second layer of life-and-death chamber. Only the ‘strongest’ half-step Kings would be able to vaguely feel it.</p><p>“Murong, be careful!” Ye Chen gave a meaningful glance to Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>“I know, I won’t be careless.” Murong Qingcheng flew out, stopping five li away from Darklight King.</p><p>“What? Fighting alone?”</p><p>“I thought this kid might have some strength, but he is relying on this woman to fight. I’m afraid she doesn’t have even ten percent chance.”</p><p>“Even if they’re confident, one can never be too confident. Do they think ‘strongest’ half-step Kings are just for name?”</p><p>Everybody’s face showed puzzlement and then regret. These two were doomed to perish.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Blacklight King had no mood to play drawn-out games. The dark light around his flickered, and his figure arrived before Murong Qingcheng as if he had teleported. Meanwhile, the five fingers of his right hand spread open amidst a flickering black light.</p><p>“Back off!”</p><p>With a soft shout, a dark purple lightning sparked off around her body as the Shadow Armor instantly activated and a formless power fiercely radiated outwards from her. It was so strong that even the magnetic field of heaven and earth was warped, sparking off wind, fire, and lightning at the same time.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>An astonishing scene occurred—the Darklight King was forcefully pushed back! The powerful shockwave made his face pale and eyes bulge.</p><p>This time, Murong Qingcheng had unleashed her dark force field at full force, unlike during her training with Ye Chen. Fused with the Star force field, even a ‘strongest’ half-step King couldn’t approach her. The power of Shadow Armor was displayed to the very extreme at this moment.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
