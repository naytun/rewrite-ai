His cultivation was only at mid rank half step king warrior level, and had somehow been giving a pressure that was unnoticeable for normal half step king warriors. But with her instincts, she had always been quite sensitive about some hidden potentials.</p><p>‘Life and Death Secret Realm that happens every ten years is about to begin in half a year, and the hidden powerful warriors are starting to surface now. I cannot be reckless!’ A thought flashed through her mind as she turned to look at Ye Chen. But, he had already disappeared from where he was standing.</p><p>…</p><p>The Cold Iron City was a city for material trading. Since there were a lot of materials here, then there were naturally a lot of alchemists that were normally rare to find.</p><p>The alchemists would need their pellet pods, and the item maker would need fire pods. Besides, they would need suitable environment for work as well.</p><p>After renting a suitable yard, Ye Chen started to forge his mid rank great sword while training his skills.</p><p>Dang! Dang! Dang!</p><p>Inside the heat-filled weapon-forging room, the flame was burning hot. Ye Chen stood topless in there, holding a hammer in his hand and beating onto the sword. The hammer was a mid rank hammer, and each movement contained the same about of power. A wave of strange, hidden power appeared on the sword as well, unblocking its meridians.</p><p>After four days in a row, Ye Chen could finally create top level mid rank swords with ease, and some premium level mid rank swords as well. It signified that his sword making skills had reached maturity.</p><p>…</p><p>On one particular day, Ye Chen arrived on the streets, seeing different trading teams on both sides with different flags waving in the air.</p><p>“Qing Yang trade team is hiring top warriors to go to the Blood Sky Land. One hundred Late Sea of Souls Realm warriors are needed. Each warrior will get paid one hundred and fifty thousand top rank spirit stones. Ten half step king warriors each will get paid one million top rank spirit stones. One-tenths of the payment will be paid immediately, and the rest will be paid once we reach the destination.”</p><p>“Axe Blade Trade Team is hiring warriors to go to the Blood Sky land…”</p><p>There were countless different-size trade teams out there. The smaller teams only needed dozens of warriors while the bigger teams would need hundreds of them, while also offering very high rates. It would not be hard to know that their goods would be way more valuable than the rest of them.</p><p>“These people might be half step beasts or demon art warriors, and might also be actual beasts. But, the blood sky land was a land full of the monsters after all, so it would be rare for it to have humans.”</p><p>The Blood Sky Land was the land that the Battle King had been to before. This land was really small compared to the True Spirit Continent, but it was full of monsters, and hence was a chaotic place. Compared to this land, the true spirit continent was way more peaceful.</p><p>“Full Moon Trade Team is hiring powerful warriors, endless Late Seas of Souls Realm warriors with two hundred thousand top rank spirit stones for each one of them. Thirty half step king warriors will each get one million and two hundred thousand top rank spirit stones. As for the top half step king warriors, three million top rank spirit stones will be given out to them.”</p><p>The other big trade team was already giving out a lot, but this team seemed to give out another twenty percent more. Plus, they wanted to hire the top half step king warriors, for which they were willing to give out three million top rank spirit stones. If they managed to hire everyone they needed, they would probably have to pay out billions of top rank spirit stones.</p><p>“Damn! They are indeed wealthy enough to do whatever they want. They have to oppress us like that every time.”</p><p>“What can you do? They are from the trading community, one of the top two ones controlling the whole Blood Sky land. Their power covers the whole land, as well as the ocean area around it. Their wealth cannot be even estimated. Billions of top rank spirit stones might not be anything for them.”</p><p>The other trade team leaders looked at the Full Moon Trade Team with envy.</p><p>“Count me in!”</p><p>“Me too!”</p><p>“Haha, great timing! I was going back there already!”</p><p>People who came to this street were all powerful warriors—the ones with the weakest cultivation were at mid Sea of Souls Realm, and the strongest were naturally half step king warriors. Normally, they were all waiting for the highest commission, but the second Full Moon Trade Team’s offer was out, one-thirds of them rushed over.</p><p>Soon, the Full Moon Trade Team hired almost three hundred Seas of Souls Realm warriors, and even the half step warriors were reaching in the dozens. But, the leader of the trade team still did not look satisfied. The Cold Iron City and Blood Sky Land had the Blood Ocean in between. The fifty robbers of the Blood Ocean were very brutal and cruel, and Full Moon Trade Team being so wealthy made them the perfect target. Without enough power, it would be easy for them to be killed.</p><p>“Leader, although there were a lot of powerful warriors inside the city, the south ocean hides endless power parties, and so does the Blood Sky Land. Not everyone would want to take on this kind of a dangerous hiring job. We might have to wait couple of days before we can leave with enough warriors.”</p><p>There were four half step king warriors inside the trade team right now, and the speaker was a middle aged man in his fifties. He leaked out a demonic qi, which made it obvious that he trained demon arts.</p><p>The leader of the trading teams, who was only at Late Sea of Souls Realm, shook his head, “No, the fifty robbers have a massive killing organization that kills everything in its way. The longer we take, the more prepared they would be. So, we will have to leave tonight, and not give them any time to prepare.”</p><p>The middle-aged man thought that it was reasonable, so he said to himself angrily, “The fifty robbers gang is so out of place. I have no idea why there is no one there to take them out.”</p><p>“It would not be that simple. The fifty robbers gang’s history is more than couple thousand years old. With one killed, one will be replaced. There should be a massive organization running in the background, so it would be almost impossible to take them out altogether. There might be Life and Death Realm warriors amongst them as well. How tricky!”</p><p>Fifty robbers gang was only a figure of speech. As a leader of the Full Moon Trade Team, he knew a bit more than the others.</p><p>“Do you still need more people?” Right then, Ye Chen walked over and asked.</p><p>“Half Step King Warrior! Yes!” The leader of the trade team was a chubby elder. As he saw another half step king warrior walk over, a smiled revealed on his face.</p><p>“Here are your one hundred and twenty thousand top rank spirit stones. The remaining will be given to your once we get to the Blood Sky Land. It is the rule.” The chubby elder handed the deposit to Ye Chen.</p><p>Ye Chen did not care about the pay. He was headed that way already, so might as well have some company. He stood aside and closed his eyes to rest, waiting for departure.</p><p>“Count me in as well!”</p><p>All of a sudden, Ye Chen heard a crispy lady’s voice. He opened his eyes and was a bit shocked at what he saw. It was indeed that lady in blue who had walked past him in front of the restaurant. The lady was rather pretty; she wore a skinny long blade around her waist, making her look rather sharp.</p><p>As he was looking at her, she looked over as well.</p><p>“Hi, my name is Lan Shanmei.” The lady in blue introduced herself.</p><p>“Ye Chen.”</p><p>Ye Chen had great senses, and he could tell that although Lan Shanmei looked rather peaceful, between her eyes was a wave of evil qi vaguely visible to him. It was obvious that she was a powerful warrior who trained demon arts as well. Her cultivation might be slightly weaker than the Darklight King, but she was at the first level of Life and Death Challenge already.</p><p>The chubby elder was very happy; he was starting to lose hope already, but he did not expect to see a half step king warrior, and a top one joining in this last minute. With them, the trade team would be a bit safer now.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go!” Waving his hand, the elder said with great confidence.</p><p>“Wait, do you still need people?”</p><p>A familiar sound appeared, Ye Chen turned around his head and said with great surprise, “Thunder Spirit King!”</p><p>It was indeed him, one of the most powerful half step king warriors on true spirit continent.</p><p>“Haha, great! Another top half step king warrior, and this person’s cultivation seems to be very powerful! It should be at least peak second level of the Life and Death Challenge.”</p><p>The chubby elder and the four half step king warriors of the trade team were very excited. Two top half step king warriors appearing at the same time could be seen as a lucky day for the Full Moon Trade Team.</p><p>As for Thunder Spirit King’s inquiry, the elder would obviously not reject it. He gave him three hundred thousand top rank spirit stones immediately and welcomed him into the trade team.</p><p>“You are Ye Chen, right?” Thunder Spirit King of course could not ignore Ye Chen’s presence as he said with a smile.</p><p>Ye Chen was rather emotional unlike his normal self. “I cannot believe that I would run into you here. What a coincidence!”</p><p>“Indeed!”</p><p>Thunder Spirit King was emotional as well. The Cold Iron City was billions of miles away from the true spirit continent, and being able to run into a familiar face would be almost impossible. Plus, what surprised him a bit was that Ye Chen was already at mid rank half step king warrior level. Moreover, he knew that with the latter’s actual power, he would be able to even fight against top half step king warriors.</p><p>Leaving the city, the group started to flew toward the south. On the way there, Ye Chen chitchatted with the Thunder Spirit King.</p><p>“There are so many powerful warriors out here, unlike the true spirit continent where everyone is either in closed up training or running in the outer areas. There are not many warriors left in there.” Thunder Spirit King said.</p><p>Ye Chen said, “Are there a lot of half step king warriors inside true spirit continent as well?”</p><p>He had run into a lot of half step warriors in his travels, which led to a question that had not been answered all this time—were there really not as many half step king warriors on the true spirit continents? Although, it was true that he did not really get into the circles of half step king warriors there.</p><p>Thunder Spirit King said, “Of course not! That time inside the graveyard was still a small proportion of after all, and there were still a lot of them left inside the martial schools. There are even more people that are out traveling, exploring and trying to train themselves.”</p><p>“Oh, I see!”</p><p>Ye Chen nodded. Once one reached half step king warrior realm, he would have to prepare for the Life and Death Challenge. Obviously, no one would want to just chill, and would have their own things that they needed to do.</p><p>Thunder Spirit King continued to say, “You are already at half step king warrior level, so you cannot miss the Life and Death Secret Realm that only happens once every ten years. By then, you will meet a lot of great martial geniuses like yourself.”</p><p>“I know about that. There is an entrance inside the Blood Sky Land, so I will just enter through there.” Ye Chen knew about it since it was clearly recorded in Battle King’s memory.</p><p>“As long as you know it…Oh, right! I had also entered there. When you get inside, you should try to stick with warriors from the true spirit continent. Otherwise, you will easily be bullied by other martial geniuses from other parts of the world. So, you should contact those warriors on the pending lists for Life and Death Realm warriors, Luo Tiandu…”</p><p>“We also have martial art geniuses that are on the waiting list for Life and Death Realm warriors?” Ye Chen had never heard of it before.</p><p>“Judging on their talent, they, of course, cannot compete with you. But, they are all in their forties now, so their cultivation base is really high. If it were not because I am too old for it now, I could actually take you to meet them.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
