Moreover, semi supreme grade had a big distinction of good and bad amongst itself. Some rare semi supreme grade artifacts were not below pseudo supreme grade artifacts at all, made as imitations of some reputed supreme grade artifacts of the ancient era.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng’s target was a pair of gloves. After all, along with the progress of her strength and realm, her original gloves had somewhat fallen behind. She would be alright fighting ordinary half-step Kings, but when fighting the ‘strongest’ half-step Kings, she would most likely suffer somewhat.</p><p>Along the way, the two saw numerous semi supreme grade artifacts.</p><p>“Snow Blasting Fist gloves, three hundred thousand upper grade spirit stones.”</p><p>“Silver Snake Blade, three hundred and twenty thousand upper grade spirit stones.”</p><p>“Blood Flame Spear, three hundred and fifty thousand upper grade spirit stones.”</p><p>“Water Moon Sky Armor, five hundred thousand upper grade spirit stones.”</p><p>In the ancient era, semi supreme grade artifacts were too numerous, and a part of them were counterfeits of supreme grade artifacts, unable to reach the supreme grade due to lacking materials.</p><p>“Bone Corroding Illusion Gloves, six hundred thousand upper grade spirit stones.”</p><p>After going through half of the second floor, they eventually found a decent looking pair of gloves.</p><p>“Excuse me! Can I have a feel of these gloves?” Murong Qingcheng and Ye Chen walked over.</p><p>“Sure!”</p><p>The owner of the gloves was a big middle-aged man. His cultivation base was not low, at the peak of Sea of Soul realm. However, before Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng—two half-step Kings—it was not even worth mentioning. Thus, he hurriedly handed over the gloves to Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>Holding the glove, Murong Qingcheng sensed a soul imprint inside. This did not mean that the glove was being used by someone. It was a basic precaution taken by Glorious Exchanges, preventing a customer from falsely claiming it as theirs. After all, such a commotion was better avoided. One would have to wait until the purchase before being able to brand their own soul imprint. This easily took care of the problem, since unless one was a Life and Death King, erasing a soul imprint in few moments was not possible.</p><p>Without branding one’s soul imprint, one would not be able to bring out the artifact’s full might. However, it was currently no battle, but merely testing the artifact’s quality.</p><p>Wearing the gloves. Murong Qingcheng faintly clenched her fist. Dark Qi streams came gushing out, warping the space and showing an indistinct, divergent image of the surroundings.</p><p>Rip! She chopped her hand like a blade, slashing a mild claw scar in the void.</p><p>The middle-aged man held his breath. She was undoubtedly a half-step King, and not an ordinary one on top. Although the strike just now was not focused on him, he felt as if his own soul was going to be ripped apart by the claw.</p><p>“Nope…Just a little higher quality than ordinary semi supreme grade artifacts.” Murong Qingcheng shook her head while taking off the glove.</p><p>Ye Chen smiled, “No hurry! We still have a lot to see.”</p><p>This glove would be a rare treasure for ordinary half-step Kings. Unfortunately, Murong Qingcheng’s standards were a lot higher. Even if it was not a pseudo supreme grade artifact, it should not be too lacking in comparison.</p><p>“Sir, madam, you’re not interested?” The middle-aged man took the gloves back and asked carefully.</p><p>Ye Chen waved his hand, “No.”</p><p>Hearing these words, the middle-aged man sat down again. He couldn’t possibly dare to show his temper before two half-step Kings.</p><p>The two soon finished browsing through the entire second floor. In short, there were a lot of good treasures, but they still couldn’t enter the eyes of the two, who didn’t want to waste their money on something useless.</p><p>Third Floor’s entrance…</p><p>Four late Sea of Soul realm experts were guarding there, and a signboard hung beside them—Nobody under half-step Kings are allowed.</p><p>Without a surprise, the two reached the third floor without any hindrance.</p><p>Ye Chen’s eyes slightly narrowed. This was the first time he had come to place with so many half-step Kings; there were at least forty-fifty half-step Kings on the third floor. Most of them were old, with the middle-aged ones second in line; the young were not even a handful.</p><p>The treasures being sold were also quite few, only ten in total, and every single one of them was surrounded by four-five people. Two regions had the most amount of people, and it seemed like the treasures were exceptionally good.</p><p>Glancing around for a moment, the two directly skipped past the eight treasures ahead and arrived before the two treasures in the rear.</p><p>One of the treasures was a semi supreme grade blade. From its powerful blade Qi, it didn’t seem any weaker than pseudo supreme grade artifacts. Its price was also exorbitant, reaching thirteen million upper grade spirit stones. This was not a number a half-step King could pool. No wonder everybody was only watching.</p><p>“Can you make it a bit cheaper. I’ve eight million upper grade spirit stones.” A staunch-looking big man asked.</p><p>The seller was an old man who shook his head, “You’re well aware of this blade’s might. I’ll not sell it for any less than thirteen million. If I auction it, merely its starting price will be five million. You probably won’t be able to buy it with even thirteen million.”</p><p>The big man said anxiously, “Half-Step King blade users might not have thirteen million upper grade stones. Don’t tell me you can sell it for thirteen million just because you decide to auction it, not to mention the five percent cut that the auction takes.”</p><p>“Then I’ll consider myself unlucky.” The old man didn’t budge.</p><p>“Then I’ll wait for you to auction it.” The middle-aged man took a few good looks at the semi supreme grade blade before finally turning around and leaving.</p><p>To the side, Ye Chen smiled, “Although this blade is merely of semi supreme grade, its blade Qi is so powerful! I’m afraid it’s the best quality product among semi supreme grade. It’s hard to blame the old man for such a high price.”</p><p>“The artifact over here seems even better the blade by many folds.” Murong Qingcheng was looking in another direction.</p><p>“What is it?” Ye Chen also looked over.</p><p>In a counter made of crystals, an armor was hovering in the air, flickering with a gentle light. “Shadow Armor, Pseudo Supreme Grade Armor, Thirty Three Million Upper Grade Spirit Stones” was inscribed on a board beside it.</p><p>“Oh boy, a pseudo supreme grade armor!”</p><p>Among the artifacts, defensive artifacts had always been valued twice as much as offensive ones. Although a price of between million was high, it was not too expensive.</p><p>“Boss, this Shadow Armor is priced too high, isn’t it? Defensive artifacts cost twice as much as offensive artifacts. If it had been an offensive artifact, wouldn’t you have priced it at sixteen million and five hundred thousand? That’s a few million more than normal.” A middle-aged man in luxurious clothes frowned.</p><p>The seller of the armor was an old man in his seventies. He raised his head and spoke calmly, “My Shadow Armor can’t be compared to ordinary pseudo supreme grade artifacts.”</p><p>“How are they different?”</p><p>The middle-aged man was somewhat anxious inwardly. As a half-step King, who didn’t wish to have a pseudo supreme grade armor to protect their body? One could wear a powerful adversary to death while fleeing from an impossible situation.</p><p>“This Shadow Armor is fused with a small fraction of Celestial Star Stone—a supreme grade ore that can only be found in the starry sky. It will allow you to unleash the Celestial Star Force Field, increasing your strength and allowing you to save your life in numerous situations.”</p><p>“Celestial Star Stone!” The surrounding people were stunned.</p><p>Celestial Star Ore was considered an exceptionally rare among supreme grade materials. It was usually found in already extinguished stars, and one would merely find a small chunk. If one could obtain a chunk the size of a longan fruit, it would certainly fetch a sky-high price, not to mention an armor that had been created by fusing with it.</p><p>“But, thirty three million upper grade spirit stones is still high, don’t you think?” The middle-aged man’s face had turned red.</p><p>The old man said slowly, “This armor was originally the grand reveal of this time’s auction. But, I have a pressing matter, and thus, I’m selling it at a reduced price. My original price was more than thirty five million upper grade spirit stones. Don’t bother with bargaining.”</p><p>The middle-aged man was stunned. It was indeed true. A pseudo supreme grade artifact containing Celestial Star Stone would move even some Life and Death Kings, not to mention them. The price of thirty three million was not high at all.</p><p>“Murong, apart from the gloves, you also need an armor. I see that that this armor is quite compatible with your dark force field. Who knows, it might even amplify it!” Ye Chen sent a Zhen Yuan transmission to Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>The latter faintly nodded and made her way through the crowd, “Boss, I’ll take this armor. Can I have a look first?”</p><p>“You’ll buy it?”</p><p>The old man looked at Murong Qingcheng with astonishment. She was an extremely young, beautiful woman. Although thirty three million was not an amount he was satisfied with, he knew that setting the price higher would not allow him to sell it off in a small while. Even so, it was no small amount, but a gargantuan number. Originally, the auctions of Gemstone Islands wished to buy this armor, but they were only willing to spend thirty million upper grade spirit stones.</p><p>“Right” Murong Qingcheng’s expression was calm.</p><p>“Alright.” The old man opened the crystal counter and took out the armor, then handed it over to her. Accepting the armor, Murong Qingcheng held it in her left hand and pressed her right hand on it. An indistinct purple colored lightning flickered at the hollow of her palm.</p><p>Ye Chen’s sharp gaze immediately perceived two different force fields colliding. However, since the time was too short, he couldn’t figure out the result.</p><p>“I’ll take it.”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng’s mouth corner arced. Sure enough, the Celestial Star Force Field conformed with the Dark Force Field, creating an amplifying effect. This armor’s price could easily be raised further. Her force field was not weaker in itself, and under further amplification, it could heavily influence the experts of same grade .</p><p>“Haha, nice doing business with you.”</p><p>The old man revealed a smile having finally completed his sale. Although thirty three million was a little lacking, even if he had taken it to auction, it would have fetched between thirty five to forty million. Taking off the five percent auction charge, his loss was not that big.</p><p>“Hold on!”</p><p>Right at this moment, a thin black old man arrived at the entrance of the third floor. He arrived like lightning and reached out toward the armor in Murong Qingcheng’s hand.</p><p>Humph!</p><p>Ye Chen coldly snorted and moved in between, slapping away the incoming palm.</p><p>“Audacious!” The thin black old man growled.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
