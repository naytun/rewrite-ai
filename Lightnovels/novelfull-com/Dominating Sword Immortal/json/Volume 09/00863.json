He was not sure where his confidence came from, but it couldn’t be empty talk. He must have something to rely on. Of course, there were not many that could make Ye Chen consider their provocation seriously. He would rather completely ignore them and study his Vibration Sword Art inside his chamber.</p><p>Vibration Sword Art evolved from Golden Splendor Vibration Sword, and thus, could be considered a metal profound sword art.</p><p>Metal profound, as a profound, was naturally incapable of vibrations. However, when paired with Zhen Yuan, it could produce vibrations. Stimulating sword vibrations through Zhen Yuan vibrations, then reinforcing Zhen Yuan vibrations in return…this was the development course he had thought of. This course could be considered as a polar opposite to Lashan Mei’s Demonic Blade Arts.</p><p>Of course, the conclusion both methods sought was one.</p><p>Possessing the undying body and dragon power, the Ye Chen’s endurance was almost on par with Lashan Mei’s body, which had been tempered through years of cultivation Demonic Blade Arts. He only needed to let his body familiarize with the vibrational power and maximize its efficiency.</p><p>This was a long and repetitive process. Fortunately, his five times greater soul power allowed him to have exceedingly high familiarity with his body compared to others, which in turn would allow him to save a lot of time.</p><p>Rip!</p><p>Taking out a mid-grade sword, Ye Chen slashed forth, causing a sword light to flash.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>But, how could a mid-grade sword sustain such a high frequency vibrations? Without any surprises, the sword shattered immediately.</p><p>Taking out an ordinary upper grade sword, Ye Chen again used the Vibration Sword Art again.</p><p>Creak!</p><p>The vibrational power generated by Vibration Sword Art was too strong. Although the upper grade in his hand didn’t shatter, minute cracks appeared all over its body nonetheless.</p><p>“Seems like the current me will have to use a peak upper grade sword in order to deploy the Vibration Sword Art and bring out its full capabilities.” The current him was still far from smoothly using this art. Even so, a common upper grade sword couldn’t sustain the vibrations. Once he reached the greater completion, perhaps he would have to use at least a half supreme grade sword to use this art.</p><p>However, in a battle, even a half-supreme grade sword would not suffice, and would break after a few exchanges. After all, how could a battle between same rank experts be light?</p><p>Twenty-eighth round’s third battle, Ye Chen against Lashan Mei.</p><p>“Just in time to learn a few things.”</p><p>Ye Chen had no doubt in his mind that the vibrational power of Lashan Mei’s Demonic Blade Arts far surpassed his. If he fought her with Vibration Sword Arts, it would be a great opportunity for him to gain a lot of experience and comprehension.</p><p>Standing across Lashan Mei, Ye Chen unsheathed the Evil Shattering Sword.</p><p>“Be careful!” Lashan Mei seemed to have seen through Ye Chen’s intentions. Her figure sped across, starting off with common blade moves. Holding his sword, Ye Chen met her in midair.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Spatial ripples spread out from the contact of blade and sword.</p><p>“Such strong vibrational power!”</p><p>Ye Chen could feel that the vibrational power coming from Demonic Blade Arts were a cut above his Vibration Sword Art, since he could feel the vibrational power being transmitted from his sword. Although this remnant power was quite small and it couldn’t threaten Ye Chen, the might it contained couldn’t be underestimated.</p><p>Clang Clang Clang!</p><p>The two exchanged dozens of blows within an instant, creating numerous spatial ripples.</p><p>“I’ll use the Demonic Chop next.” Lashan Mei warned Ye Chen.</p><p>“Many thanks!” How could Ye Chen not see that Lashan Mei was helping him familiarize with vibrational power? He felt quite grateful to her.</p><p>Black blade light turned the surroundings indistinct, cracking the space open. Lashan Mei had gone all out, not withholding at all.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>The Evil Shattering Sword vibrated at a high frequency, giving off a bee-like buzz. Holding the sword with both hands, Ye Chen scurried forward and raised the sword, resisting her demonic blade.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>This time, not only did spatial ripples appear, sword light and blade light dispersed due to the vibrational power, opening numerous spatial cracks in the chamber while an ear-piercing metal-grinding noise pounded against everybody’s ears. Ye Chen felt a numbness in his body, almost rendering him incapable of holding his sword.</p><p>Demonic Chop’s instantaneous eruption of vibrational power was reaching a limit, and it far surpassed Ye Chen’s Vibration Sword Art. If Ye Chen’s biggest ace had been Vibration Sword Art, he would have already lost. This was because he required a pause in the battle due to the numbness in his body, and Lashan Mei could have easily chopped his off in this duration.</p><p>“Thank you!” Ye Chen lowered his sword and stood before Lashan Mei.</p><p>“Exchanging pointers is beneficial for me too. There are not many who can compare with me in vibrational power.” Exchanging pointers with somebody who had the same power as oneself was the best way to increase one’s strength. The process of validating each other was also the process of improving oneself.</p><p>Anyhow, the match ended with Lashan Mei’s defeat.</p><p>Ye Chen was feeling a bit apologetic. If not for the reward of life-and-death stones, he would have conceded. Empty fame had never held much lure for him anyway.</p><p>The twenty-eighth round’s final match was actually the battle between Young Elephant Lord and Xu Jing.</p><p>Young Elephant Lord’s strength didn’t need to be mentioned, as had defeated several popular candidates in previous rounds. His physical strength was beyond a million jin without a doubt. Even Tantai Mingyue’s teleportation lost before him. He directly punched the space, warping the trajectories of spatial ripples and rendering her incapable of using teleportation at all.</p><p>As for Xu Jing, she was actually the strongest candidate of the top three. Even the powerful Lashan Mei, who managed to cut off an arm from Marquis Sword Snow, was smashed by her. Xu Jing’s strength was so condensed that vibrations had no effect on her.</p><p>The battle between her and Young Elephant Lord was this credit battle’s confrontation of strength.</p><p>“Your strength is very good, not below mine. If you become my girlfriend, I don’t mind letting you win.” Young Elephant Lord didn’t have much allure of life-and-death stones. He had already attained the third layer’s peak, and hence, he almost had no need for life-and-death stones to advance into Life-and-Death Realm.</p><p>“Ridiculous!” A sneer appeared on Xu Jing’s face.</p><p>“Humph! Don’t you think you can’t lose just because your strength is more or less the same as mine. Cultivating the fleshy body is the fundamental principle of my Battle Elephant Sect. We’ve many secret arts that can increase my strength by many folds.” Young Elephant Lord’s face sunk.</p><p>“Poison Dragon Fist!”</p><p>Xu Jing disdained exchanging words with Young Elephant Lord. Amidst blazing golden flames, she directly punched at his chest.</p><p>“Battle Elephant Fist!” Young Elephant Lord had been guarded against Xu Jing. As soon as he saw her moving, he immediately clenched his right hand into fist and met her fist. The collision of two fists immediately set off a huge explosion. All the air inside the chamber exploded, as if countless bombs were exploding one after another. Moreover, the space around the two fists coiled up like a snake.</p><p>“Star Shattering Fist!”</p><p>Xu Jing didn’t take a step back and threw another punch. As a result, the chamber instantly darkened before numerous flickering stars appeared; one of the stars at the position of Young Elephant Lord shattered.</p><p>“Elephant King Guard!”</p><p>Young Elephant Lord folded both his arms over his chest. With that, a huge elephant phantom covered his body, giving off a beastly aura.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>Star Shattering Fist’s might was so great that it seemed as if Xu Jing had already entered the Life-and-Death realm, since this fist was enough to destroy a small star. Even with his secret defensive art, Young Elephant Lord was blasted off, spinning in the air. His blood-Qi was soaring, and his face was completely flushed.</p><p>“Elephant King Roar!”</p><p>Knowing that he couldn’t allow Xu Jing to send blow after blow at him, he took in a deep breath, causing his chest to swell and making him seem like a small mountain. He then opened his mouth wide and let out a thunderclap-like roar, causing a frenzy of spatial ripples to appear. In the next instant, a transparent light ripple spread around him, driving all the air away.</p><p>It was enough to hold Xu Jing for a moment and keep her at bay.</p><p>“Let me show you the might of my atavism and the strongest secret art.”</p><p>Demonic beasts who cultivated strength didn’t battle in their original forms. This was because the human-form was the best for explosive power. Although their power would increase by ten-folds in their beast form, it would be too scattered. It was the same principle as a needle piercing through a block of blood.</p><p>Despite being in his human form, Young Elephant Lord’s nose stretched out without an end in sight, ultimately turning into a true-elephant’s nose. His body also widened by several folds, including his bones. The previous Young Elephant Lord was around two meters tall, but the current him was almost three meters tall. Standing tall, he seemed like a hill or a wall.</p><p>“Eight Savage Elephant Fists!”</p><p>With an explosive strength, Young Elephant Lord’s right fist swung towards Xu Jing, giving off an intense aura of savagery as if hundreds of elephants and were birds crying in the barbaric era.</p><p>“A mere high rank heaven grade secret art. Sacred Dragon Fist, second step!” In response, Xu Jing punched out, and her strength actually condensed a sacred-looking huge golden dragon. The golden dragon erupted forth, tearing apart Young Elephant Lord’s fist energy before coiling around his body.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>Young Elephant Lord directly turned into blood mist.</p><p>“What the hell is she?”</p><p>“Don’t tell me she is a dragon?”</p><p>Xu Jing’s strength made everybody tongue-tied; even Ye Chen was a bit stupefied. He was sure that her last punch could obliterate a peak level evil spirit.</p><p>‘Sure enough, a dragon’s power can’t be estimated through normal means, much less to say of a high-ranked dragon such as Golden Dragon.’ However, he quickly adapted to the absurd strength of a Golden Dragon.</p><p>“Chances of her being a true dragon are too low. She should be a sub-dragon with a true dragon’s bloodline.” Marquis Sword Star guessed Xu Jing’s identity. However, as far as he was concerned, there couldn’t be an enormous dragon in True Spirit World. After all, he’d read about the terror of dragons through his ancient Seven Star Strike Sword Art. Even if he were to cultivate the sixth strike, he would at most be able to kill a common dragon of the same rank, when in reality, he hadn’t even perfected the fifth strike yet.</p><p>It could be said that dragons were a race that were above demons and several levels above humans. However, their numbers had always been scarce, which was their disadvantage.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
