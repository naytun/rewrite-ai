Although that was not the main reason why I got to where I am today, it could not be without it. If Battle King’s martial art is in trouble, I cannot ignore it. Otherwise, I will be guilty of Battle King, which would cause a demon to be created in my mind.”</p><p>Ye Chen was just planning to pay the martial school a visit and see how it was doing now. If it were already super powerful and full of powerful warriors, he would leave quietly and not cause any waves for them, since he did not really want to become Immortal Sword Martial School’s leader. But, now that the school was obviously not doing well, and the name was changed as well, it would not be something he felt he could ignore anymore.</p><p>Whoo!</p><p>Letting out a deep breath, Ye Chen flashed his body and flew to the deep parts of the mountains.</p><p>In the middle of the mountain range was a massive mountain. However, the top part of the mountain looked like it had been cut down by someone, and was very smooth. On the peak was a group of buildings with different heights. Without the aura of bad luck hanging over the top, it was not that bad of a place after all.</p><p>There was a massive stone tomb with four characters written on top, “Zhang Tian Martial School”. Two rows of disciples were guarding the door, chatting with each other. Right then, a group of people were walking down the mountain with bags on their back.</p><p>“Brother Gao, are you taking some time off to go home?” Seeing that someone was leaving, a guarding disciple asked with a smile.</p><p>The leading teenager said while shaking his head, “You guys, it had been fun being brothers with you for this many years. We will still be friends in the future. I will also miss you guys.”</p><p>“Brother Gao, you…”</p><p>The guarding disciple’s expression dimmed down. He seemed like he had guessed something suddenly.</p><p>The teenager did not speak, but the female disciple said sadly, “We decided to leave the school and never come back again.”</p><p>“Why? Why are you leaving? The leader himself has not treated you guys badly. Why are you leaving now? Once you are all gone, there would really be no one to take over in the future.” Amongst the guarding disciples, one of the young man spoke directly.</p><p>One of the more mature young man shook his head, “Brother Wu, don’t speak like that anymore. Brother Gao must have his reasons.”</p><p>“Reasons? What reasons? Isn’t it just the fact that the school is not doing so well and being bullied by the other martial schools? I, Wu Zhangxing, might not have a lot of talent, but I know that the hardship in front of us now will only push me to train harder. I might not have as many resources as the others, but I will use double the time to make up for it. Being bullied by others will only inspire my battling intent. One day, I will stay here until I see the school standing on top.” Wu Zhangxing screamed with tears circling in his eyes.</p><p>“Brother Wu!”</p><p>The young man that had been called brother Gao was staring at him. In his memory, brother Wu was always an optimistic person, laughing, chuckling, and joking. He had been made fun of by the older disciples before. But, no one had expected him to have such deep thoughts for the school.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>The young man was struggling to find words. He was one of the powerful warriors of the school. When he joined the school, he had sworn that he would use his talent and push the school forward. But, he had forgotten his vow because of the cruel reality. No matter how powerful he was, he was still nothing without resources.</p><p>“You should go! I have looked up to the wrong person. Gao Zhiyuan, you are no longer a man I look up to from now on.”</p><p>Gao Zhangxing turned around to not look at him.</p><p>Sigh!</p><p>The other guarding disciples sighed, and no one talked anymore.</p><p>‘This disciple is rather straightforward. But, he is indeed loyal! Although he is only at Early Astral Reaching Realm, he can be trained to become one of the guarding warriors of the school.’ Ye Chen stood on a tree.</p><p>With his half step king warrior level, no one could find him as long as he did not go overboard.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>A painful expression flashed past Gao Zhiyuan’s face. But, it was well hidden, so not a lot of people could see it.</p><p>“Don’t say that anymore!” That female disciple right next to him started crying.</p><p>Everyone looked at her. She was called Li Cui, who had been in love with Gao Zhiyuan, which was something that everyone knew.</p><p>She said while crying, “What do you know? Do you know how much he has given up for staying in this school? If you don’t know all that, then who are you to say such things?”</p><p>“Sister Li!” Gao Zhiyuan stopped her with a serious tone.</p><p>She looked at him and said with a loud voice, “Brother Gao, I always liked you, and still like you. So, I cannot just let this go. Why is it always you who gets hurt? I cannot let this slid anymore.”</p><p>“Sister Li, what happened?” One of the guarding disciples asked.</p><p>Li Cui said sadly, “You should know that Gao family was a rank 7 family. There were a couple of people in the list of heritage, and Brother Gao was one of them. However, in order to stay here, Brother Gao gave that up. Yet, he did not say anything, because he did not want other people to share his pain.”</p><p>Gao Zhiyuan said calmly, “Since sister Li has said it, then I will not deny it. Indeed, I am no longer an heir of Gao family, but I do not regret it. I never wanted to be the leader of the Gao family. I enjoy the freedom the school gives me.”</p><p>“What about your fiancé? She had waited for you for years, but seeing that you were so fixed on the idea of staying, she canceled the engagement and thought that you will not become anything while being here. I heard that she got together with a martial genius from the Extreme Sky Marital School.”</p><p>“Enough! Stop talking now!” Gao Zhiyuan’s eyes were red as he stared at Li Cui. The latter got scared upon seeing that reaction, since she had never seen him with such scary expressions.</p><p>“This Gao Zhiyuan!”</p><p>Ye Chen just thought that Gao Zhiyuan wanted to leave because he thought there was no future with the school. But, him sacrificing so much for the school was indeed not something he had expected.</p><p>“Early Sea of Souls Realm…He has got great talent. Not bad, not bad! I have enough resources to help you reach peak level Late Sea of Souls Realm within a couple of years.”</p><p>Ye Chen could tell that Gao Zhiyuan had a very mature mind. With his age and talent, he would be at late Seas of Souls Realm already if he had enough resources. As for resources, that would not be a hard problem to fix. It was the mentality and mind that would be rare. That was why most people would need hardships to grow.</p><p>“Xiao Tao, why don’t you understand me?” Gao Zhiyuan’s eyes were full of pain and confusion as he said to himself.</p><p>Seeing Gao Zhiyuan struggling like this, Wu Zhangxing seemed regretful. He walked out and bowed toward Gao Zhiyuan, “Brother Gao, I have been wrong about you. You can beat me or yell at me at your wish.”</p><p>“It is not your fault.” Gao Zhiyuan shook his head, “It is me and my weak determination.” As he spoke, he turned around and looked at Li Cui, “Sister Li, thank you!”</p><p>“Me?” She was a bit confused.</p><p>Gao Zhiyuan said, “This kind of thing had been buried in my heart for the longest time. But now, it is out in the open, and I actually feel relieved. I have decided that I will never leave the school. Since I have made it before, then why not continue holding on? It could only mean that my mind is still too weak. I have been thinking that I was doing the right thing, but I guess I was wrong after all.”</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>Ye Chen suddenly realized that Gao Zhiyuan’s mental power improved drastically. It was indeed a sign of breakthrough, which was really rare with mentality.</p><p>“Brother Gao, you are not leaving?”</p><p>Not only were the guarding disciples shocked, even Li Cui was shocked as well.</p><p>“Yeah, I will not leave anymore. Before, I was living for the family and Tang. But now, I want to live for myself.”</p><p>“Then, I will not leave either.” She said.</p><p>“Eh? Sister Li, didn’t you say that your mother was sick and you needed to go back to take care of her?” Gao Zhiyuan asked confusedly.</p><p>She chuckled and then said with a bit of shyness, “I was lying to you.”</p><p>“You, cheeky lady!” Gao Zhiyuan could never know what he was supposed to do with her.</p><p>The two were not leaving anymore, so the ones who followed them off the mountain were all exchanging looks. Finally, one of them put down the bag and said, “I will not leave either. Damn it! I have lived here for a decade. What would it mean it if I leave now? It would just be quitting.”</p><p>“If you all are not leaving, then how can I leave?”</p><p>The ones planning to leave all threw down their luggage. There was not much in there anyways, since it was more of a formality.</p><p>“Haha, everyone is not leaving!” Wu Zhangxing was happy.</p><p>The other guarding disciples all revealed a smile on seeing that as well.</p><p>Seeing the younger disciples all so happy, Gao Zhiyuan was also satisfied. He loved this school, because it was like a home to him. His brothers and sisters were like his real family. The elders had been nothing but kind to him. Even if it were just for that, he could not leave.</p><p>“Haha!”</p><p>All of a sudden, a string of laughter was heard out of nowhere and a heavy wave of wind appeared out of nowhere. In the sky, the clouds changed drastically; not only the disciples on the mountain were shocked, even those senior masters on the mountain were caught off guard. They hurried to spread their soul power down to check what was happening.</p><p>“It is a half step king warrior! Not good! Who is trying to cause trouble here this time?”</p><p>No doubt they would be this frightened. It had been eventful at the school recently, as there were many outsiders trying to rob them. They had been barely holding on over the years.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>All of a sudden, a human figure appeared in front of them: it was indeed Ye Chen.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Gao Zhiyuan spread out all of his Zhen yuan, and could tell that Ye Chen’s power was a hundred times greater than his. But, he still had nothing to worry about.</p><p>“I am one of you.” Ye Chen said with a smile one.</p><p>“Impossible! I have never seen you before.” Wu Zhangxing did not believe him.</p><p>Ye Chen walked up toward the school.</p><p>Gao Zhiyuan hesitated, but decided to follow up. He vaguely had an instinct telling him that Ye Chen was friendly, and did not carry any killing intent.</p><p>Walking in front, Ye Chen turned around to tell the disciples, “You guys are not bad. Your trust in the school is now with value. From now on, the Zhang Tian School will not be the same as you know it.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
