Although the death qi iron was an extreme rank metal, it would not be worth 500 million top rank spirit stones for sure. Ye Chen was obviously making fun of him and not planning to sell him anything.</p><p>“So what if that is the case?” Ye Chen put away the rock and looked at him with a cold expression on his face.</p><p>“I would give you five million top rank spirit stones for a peaceful ending. What a nice thing I had offered? But, since you do not care for peace, I don’t have to be nice to you anymore. Right now, even if you want to beg me to spare your life, it is too late.”</p><p>The Wolf Warrior’s expression became scary as two white pointy teeth appeared under his mouth.</p><p>“Who do you think you are?”</p><p>Amongst the eight beast warriors, the Elephant Warrior was the most powerful, and then there was the Snake Warrior and the Eagle Warrior. After that, there was still the Tiger Warrior and the other four warriors, with the Wolf Warrior being one of the four. If Ye Chen could not even handle him, then he should give up on exploring already.</p><p>“You are looking for death!”</p><p>Wolf Warrior squinted his eyes and disappeared from where he was standing. When he reappeared, he was already a meter away from Ye Chen.</p><p>He reached out his right hand as his human palm turned into a wolf claw, which was extremely pointy like four shiny sharp blades. Wherever it passed, the space started to twist before spreading out in the air.</p><p>Wolf Warrior did it so abruptly that no one with a weak power would be able to dodge it.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The claw light approached Ye Chen within a second and slashed through his body.</p><p>Pooh!</p><p>Four narrow cold light beams flashed through around Ye Chen as his body seemed to have been cut through. But, Wolf Warrior knew that it was not as simple as that. His heart sank at the thought that there was no blood splashing out and it all happened so effortlessly, which would be impossible since there would still be the half step king warrior’s defense layer.</p><p>“A shadow?”</p><p>The Wolf Warrior’s expression changed drastically as he suddenly turned around and waved out an attack.</p><p>“Too slow!”</p><p>In his vision, Ye Chen held his great sword and approached, cold sparks blossoming in the midair. It was a sign that the sword arts had reached a certain level where they were starting to materialize.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>The Evil Shattering sword was stabbed into the Wolf Warrior’s shoulders while that sharp claw attack of his ended up getting nowhere.</p><p>“You cannot get away with this!”</p><p>There was a reason why the Wolf Warrior was able to be ranked in the top eight. He opened his mouth towards Ye Chen and a blue light ball formed in his throat, ready to be pushed out. The distance between the two was just a couple of meters, so the wolf warrior did not think Ye Chen would be able to dodge this attack.</p><p>“Eh? Forgot that you are a beast for a second.”</p><p>A thought flashed through Ye Chen’s mind and he shook his sword in advance. With the pulling power generated from the sword, the wolf warrior’s body tilted slightly. The light ball shot out in a slightly off angle and eventually scratched through Ye Chen’s shoulder, bringing out a hint of sparks in the air.</p><p>Seeing that his attack did not succeed, the Wolf Warrior moved his body immediately and hurried to increase the distance between the two. Due to the extreme speed, a string of blood burst out of his body and made his face pale.</p><p>What made it even worse was that he managed to increase one inch of distance between his body and the sword, but no matter how hard he tried, it seemed impossible for him to get any further away. Ye Chen had caught up with him the second he decided to back out, and those reflexes made the Wolf Warrior regret his decision. If he knew of Ye Chen’s power before, he would not have messed with him for a mere stone.</p><p>“I have made a mistake. The Death Qi Iron is yours…I will leave immediately.”</p><p>As things had developed to this situation, Wolf Warrior knew that it would be best for him to leave now. Although one could not really kill another inside the secret realm, once wounded severely, one would be transported out of the realm and the stones would indeed be unreachable. After he managed to leave this place, he would try to get a stone as soon as possible and increase his cultivation to first chamber of Life and Death Challenge, and it would not be late for him to revenge Ye Chen by then.</p><p>“You will leave for sure…just not this place, but the actual realm!”</p><p>Ye Chen increased his speed and the sword light flashed once close to the Wolf Warrior’s neck.</p><p>Pooh!</p><p>A massive head flew into the air before Wolf warrior’s body slowly faded and disappeared inside this realm.</p><p>Putting back his sword, Ye Chen disappeared from where he was standing as well.</p><p>“Dealing with these kinds of beasts, precision is all it takes.”</p><p>Ye Chen knew it very well that the wolf warrior must be more powerful than this, and as a beast, it had still not gone back to its original form or perform its beast talent. But, Ye Chen and his unbelievably fast sword art did not give him the chance at all.</p><p>In a way, wolf warrior was rather unlucky.</p><p>Of course, it was not that it was an unfair battle, just that he had lost so fast without being able to perform any attacks really.</p><p>Inside the savage mountain…</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A big mountain had been shattered. The Wolf Warrior was so furious that his body shook.</p><p>“Damn! Damn! Damn! I was transported out of the realm! All of the wait and effort I spent in the past ten years, all for nothing! No! No!.” The wolf warrior roared into the sky.</p><p>“You just wait! My school and I will not let this slide. After I get your information, your death will not be that far ahead.”</p><p>There was nothing but killing intent in his eyes. Without the stone, it would take him a very long time to reach life and death realm. And after the secret realm thing finished, he might end up being the last of the top eight beast warriors, which was not something he could accept.</p><p>“Huh! Even if you reach the life and death realm, you will still die when you encounter the beast king.”</p><p>His body flashed as he left the mountains and flew towards his school.</p><p>…</p><p>“Killing” wolf warrior was only a simple task, so Ye Chen did not care about it at all. The Life and Death secret realm was opened every decade. With this opportunity, he wanted to reach life and death realm as soon as possible, since the first chamber was not his ultimate goal. Only by reaching the third chamber could he have a chance to fight against a real life and death king warrior.</p><p>“I will go to the inner area first.”</p><p>The outer area was too huge, and in the following days, Ye Chen had not seen a single person. However, he had indeed met couple of evil spirits. Unfortunately, the chance of these spirits carrying life and death stones was too small, not even one in one hundred. It was an extreme luck for that man from before to gain a stone that early on.</p><p>On one particular day, Ye Chen finally saw someone. And it was not just a person, rather a big group of them.</p><p>It was the edge of the two worlds separating the two areas. According to Battle King’s memory, Ye Chen knew that the separation was formed with life and death qi. Wanting to break through with force would be a suicidal move. The only way to make through to the inner region would be to go through the life and death bridge that connected the outer and inner areas.</p><p>Right then, dozens of people had gathered on one side of the life and death bridge. They were all young martial geniuses from the savage mountain.</p><p>“I don’t believe that the life and death bridge can trap me here.”</p><p>A warrior had stood by the bridge for a long time. Eventually, he made up his mind and took that first step onto the bridge, a determined expression appearing on his face.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>Landing onto the ground, Ye Chen watched the guy’s attempt to go through.</p><p>“Oh! It is you!” The young man in black standing in front turned around to look at Ye Chen, a smile appearing on the corner of his mouth.</p><p>“You are Tie Kuangzun, right?”</p><p>Ye Chen could tell that he was not a beast, and that his cultivation was at peak level second life and death challenge. In the blood heaven land, only Tie Kuangzun seemed to fit the profile, since Ye Chen had actually met the other three of the four demon warriors after all.</p><p>However, he was not too sure. After all, there were more martial geniuses in this secret realm than just the warriors from Blood Heaven Land.</p><p>“Indeed!” That guy said with a smile. “This is my first time seeing someone really not caring for the demon warriors. You are very suitable for my liking.”</p><p>“If people respect me, then I will respect back. That’s it.”</p><p>“Hehe…You will have to be careful then. Immortal Demon Warrior is really powerful, so powerful that he has reached a threshold. His Immortal Demon Art puts him in a position where he is almost incapable of losing. Although I don’t know what you have to be this arrogant, but I suggest you strongly to first improve your cultivation.”</p><p>This Tie Kuangzun did not look like the one in the rumors. According to his reputation, he was said to be super arrogant and reckless, since he had completely controlled the ability to not fully demonize and keep his consciousness. But, this Tie Kuangzun in front of him somehow even gave Ye Chen a hint of friendliness.</p><p>“Thank you for your reminder.” Ye Chen nodded.</p><p>“Alright. I will not say more, I believe you are not that kind of ruthless person.” He turned his head and went back to look at that young man on the bridge.</p><p>The bridge was not that long. People could see the end of the other side from this side, so it was about one hundred meters tops. The young man who took the first steps on the bridge had been under attacks since the first couple steps he had taken as the two stone statues nearby seemed to come to life. They opened their ‘mouths’ and shot out waves of light beams which contained a great power and covered up almost the entire space. As a result, this young man was blown back immediately, blood pouring out of his mouth.</p><p>“Damn! The bridge is too narrow. There is no places to escape at all.”</p><p>The young man could not accept his failure, but he did not want to try again yet, since it was just the first round of attacks. He knew that even if he managed to dodge the first wave, the second or third waves of attacks would “kill” him and ship him out of the realm, which would be the biggest loss. After all, even the outer area would have a chance of getting some life and death stones.</p><p>“I will leave first.” Tie Kuangzun said as he was stepping for the bridge. As the ranking number 2 existent in the top four demons, the attacks on the life and death bridge were nothing for him. Within a brief moment, he managed to cross it and enter the inner area.</p><p>“It seems like it is not that hard!”</p><p>Ye Chen was about to step onto the bridge as well when a human figure suddenly jumped past him and shot through the bridge. Just like Tie Kuangzun, the attacks on the bridge were nothing for this warrior. But, just as he was approaching the center of the bridge, he turned his head around and smiled creepily before waving his hand and creating a layer of qi wall. He then proceeded to punch in a couple of crystals at the four corners of the wall to stabilize it.</p><p>“Hehe, a meeting present if you may.” As he spoke, this warrior jumped through the bridge and entered the other area.</p><p>“Damn! Who is this person?”</p><p>The bridge itself was a tough challenge for many, and by adding a qi wall, it was obvious that he did not want these people to go through.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
