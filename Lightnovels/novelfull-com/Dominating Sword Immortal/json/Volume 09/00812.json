The second layer of Life and Death chamber deserved its reputation. His Protective Zhen Yuan was so sturdy that he would not be injured instantly even if one or two flying swords attacked him. Only the true Thunder Calamity Sword could do so. But, the Darklight King was no fool. How could he let the swords approach him so easily?</p><p>“Hehe…You, Darklight King, have ruled Gemstone Islands for so many years. How can you not have something special? If not, you would have been replaced long ago.” The head steward seemed confident that the Darklight King could make a comeback.</p><p>“Hmph! Seems like you’ve done your research thoroughly.” Darklight King coldly snorted and no longer replied.</p><p>Peng Peng Peng!</p><p>Fifteen flying swords surrounded the Darklight King and madly assaulted him. The real body of Thunder Calamity Sword in particular aroused huge sparks every time it struck, shaking him to the core.</p><p>“Black Star Explosion!”</p><p>He was bound to lose if he only defended, and the Darklight King was well aware of this fact. With a roar, he knocked the original body of Thunder Calamity Sword. Subsequently, his body curled up while giving off a huge burst scorching red black radiance. The radiance caved in a hundredth of a second with a rumble, condensing around his outer body.</p><p>In the next moment, The Darklight King was surrounded by a scorching earthen black sphere with a diameter of two meters. The surface of the sphere was astonishing and toughness was unbelievable. When the Zhen Yuan flying swords struck its surface, they could only leave behind some shallow scars.</p><p>“Explode!”</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>With a growl, the earthen sphere around his body swelled rapidly before it exploded like a small star, a huge shockwave sweeping through the surroundings. Not only did it break the Sword Control Art, it snapped off the Thunder Calamity Sword’s tip. As for the Zhen Yuan swords, they had been long disintegrated.</p><p>Rip!</p><p>A blue light came flying at Ye Chen. Ye Chen extended his two fingers, catching the light in between.</p><p>It was indeed the Thunder Calamity Sword’s tip.</p><p>“Fusion of earth and fire!”</p><p>Ye Chen’s discerning power exceptional. He could tell that Darklight King’s Black Star Explosion was a peerless skill based on star explosion. In the True Spirit World, once one reached the Life and Death realm, they could land on the beautiful stars in the void. These stars were quite small, and a Life and Death King could easily destroy one. However, when these stars exploded, even a Life and Death King had to retreat a few meters to not be caught in the explosion. Although Darklight King’s Black Star Explosion was extremely shallow, it was simply terrifying for the experts of the same level.</p><p>Breaking Ye Chen’s Sword Control Art in one go, Darklight King’s aura soared like the black flames around his body.</p><p>“To force me to this extent, you’re the first, and you’ll also be the last,” The Darklight King’s voice rang out like a thunderclap. The burst of sound wave surged, giving off a frightening aura.</p><p>“Is that so?” Ye Chen’s face didn’t change as he threw the sword tip of Thunder Calamity Sword with a flick.</p><p>“I didn’t want to reveal too many cards. However, I’ll make an exception for you. You can die now! Darklight Palm Arts, second style, Blazing World!” The Darklight King’s entire being leaped up while he swatted at the other with his right hand surrounded in raging black flames.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>Black light and red flames intertwined like a volcano eruption, as if the earth’s crust had split apart, drowning the space around Ye Chen in flames. From the outside, it was impossible to see him inside.</p><p>“Look, the Zhen Yuan over there is igniting!” Someone pointed at the flame covered sky and spoke in an astounded voice, hearing which, everybody sucked in breaths of cold air. In the red-black sky, Lightning and rain overlapped while flames soared straight to the ninth heavens. And accompanying it was blue, white, yellow, black, and every other color that could be imagined. The different Zhen Yuans couldn’t even be counted.</p><p>“How can one come out alive from this?”</p><p>Nobody expected Darklight King’s strength to have reached such a degree. He directly made an expanse of heaven and earth explode with one palm.</p><p>“I’m afraid this kid is done!” Someone sighed.</p><p>“Yeah. He is already quite powerful though, forcing the Darklight King to reveal his hidden cards. However, he is still quite young and doesn’t have a lot of cards up his sleeve. How could he stand against a century-old veteran ‘strongest’ half-step King! As soon as the Darklight King revealed an ace, all his advantages were instantly nullified.”</p><p>“Sister-in-law!” Yue Bingxin was extremely anxious.</p><p>Yue Lingshuang’s eyes faintly squinted before she said gravely, “I can feel that his aura hasn’t disappeared, and is instead growing stronger.”</p><p>“Aura growing stronger? Could young master Ye be accumulating power for a counterattack?” Yue Lingshuang’s words relieved her greatly.</p><p>“Perhaps.” Yue Lingshuang didn’t know either.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Right at that moment, Ye Chen’s voice rang out like a thunderclap from the ninth heavens. Nothing could stop his voice or weaken it. And following his roar was a five colored radiance breaking out of the submerged sky, which seemed like a Zhen Yuan tidal wave containing countless energies within.</p><p>Creak Creak!</p><p>In the next moment, a black sword light swirled out, cleaving through the Zhen Yuan ocean and creating a huge opening. Ye Chen’s figure shot out of the opening and issued forty nine sword strikes in pair of seven each, each strike swift to the extreme.</p><p>“Cicada Shedding Carapace!”</p><p>Darklight King’s face sank. His body continuously spun, shedding off his doppelgangers one after another. After creating forty nine images, he suddenly pounced on Ye Chen, unleashing a barrage of Darklight Palm Imprints in the meantime. At this moment, he was going all out. Ye Chen’s strength was simply beyond his expectations. To think that the latter would be able to break his Blazing World and instantly counterattack!</p><p>Since the distance was too far, Ye Chen’s Spiritual Sword didn’t injure the Darklight King this time. However, his images were cleaved into two.</p><p>Upon sending forty nine sword strikes, Ye Chen’s aura turned a bit sluggish. This was an indication of exhausting his strength. However, the Darklight King arrived right at this moment. Even though his ability to grasp the timing as not as good as Ye Chen, it was still terrifying. He was, after all, a veteran ‘strongest’ half-step King.</p><p>Unfortunately, he was facing Ye Chen, who never lost a battle at the same level.</p><p>“Sword Step!”</p><p>Ye Chen’s being shone like sword light as he shuttled through the numerous Darklight Palm Imprints. He was so fast that the space around him was filled with dazzling lights like a string of suns. Darklight King only felt a blur before his eyes and Ye Chen had already arrived before him. He didn’t even have the time to issue a palm imprint.</p><p>‘How can he be so fast!’</p><p>Darklight King turned pale with fright. In the first exchange, he had already felt that Ye Chen had an exceptional explosive power. However, at this moment, it was much higher than before. Rather than saying this was a body art, it seemed more like a sword art—an art that used body as a sword.</p><p>Darklight King didn’t know that Ye Chen’s sword steps had acquired a hint of sword arts. Sword arts were naturally bizarre and mystical, possessing a myriad of transformations. Without an exaggeration, Ye Chen was superior in explosive bursts over short range even compared to Murong Qingcheng’s speed provided by her innate bat wings.</p><p>In fact, Ye Chen could be even quicker. His Green Lotus Sword Arts had already been upgraded to heaven grade, and could provide an unimaginable boost to the sword steps. After all, one was a sword cultivation art while the other was the footwork of a sword artist. They naturally complemented each other.</p><p>Ye Chen waved his sword at the Darklight King, arousing a condensed black sword Qi and slashing at him. The latter’s reaction was a bit slow as he subconsciously used Cicada Shedding Carapace and escaped. Of course, as an old fox, he naturally didn’t forget to turn around and counterattack to prevent Ye Chen’s pursuit.</p><p>“What a crafty old fox!”</p><p>Ye Chen was by no means holding back. Except for the Bewitching Mirror Destruction and Sword Domain, he had used all other tricks. If it had been a ‘strongest’ half-step King who had just entered the second layer, they would have been defeated long ago, and might even have been killed. However, the Darklight King was different. Not only was his cultivation base profound, he had innumerable tricks up his sleeve. It was especially the case with the Cicada Shedding Carapace, which allowed him to escape a fatal strike several times.</p><p>Therefore, even though Ye Chen had always maintained the upper hand, he hadn’t been able to seriously injure the other.</p><p>As for why he didn’t use Bewitching Mirror Destruction and Sword Domain, Ye Chen’s thinking was the same as Darklight King. With so many people present on the scene, revealing his strongest move was not a desirable outcome.</p><p>“But, I’ve seen through the Cicada Shedding Carapace.”</p><p>Tangling with this art for so long, Ye Chen could finally see the weak point of this art. Precisely speaking, the weak point of Darklight King’s Cicada Shedding Carapace.</p><p>The Darklight King was clearly heading toward a disaster.</p><p>‘Damn it! Don’t tell me I have to reveal Darklight Palm Arts’ third style.’</p><p>Pulling some distance, the Darklight King showed some indecisiveness. One couldn’t go by his awe-inspiring reputation on the Gemstone Islands. It was merely so because he had never revealed his strongest card. But once he revealed it, it would no longer be a secret. This would be an extremely dangerous matter. In a high level confrontation, catching somebody off-gurad was at times even more important than strength.</p><p>There were two ‘strongest’ half-step Kings on Gemstone Islands—him and Huang Mei. He was certain that as soon as he revealed the third style, Huang Mei would spend a lot of time researching his move and he would be taking a huge loss in the next confrontation.</p><p>“Whatever! I can’t get this kid without using the third style. Let’s leave other matters for later.” His mind was running at a lightning fast speed, and the Darklight King soon came to a decision.</p><p>“This palm will surely kill you.”</p><p>Coldly looking at Ye Chen, he seemed to be looking at a dead person. He had no doubt that the other would die, because even he himself couldn’t properly control this palm strike. Once he used it, the only outcome would be death.</p><p>“Come!”</p><p>Ye Chen was slightly surprised. Darklight King’s expression told him that the latter was about to use his strongest move, and it would not be easy to deal with. However, Ye Chen was not afraid in the slightest, and was instead a bit expectant to see what kind of mysteries the Darklight King’s strongest move would contain.</p><p>It should be known that apart from Bewitching Mirror Destruction and Sword Domain, he hadn’t even used Waning Moon at full force. This was because the Evil Vanquishing Sword indeed cost a lot of Zhen Yuan. Apart from the Spiritual Sword, all other moves would cost ten-twenty percent of his Zhen Yuan.</p><p>Letting out a breath, the Head Steward revealed a smile and said in a relaxed manner, “It’s over!”</p><p>“How do you know, Head Steward?” One half-step King from Glorious Exchanges asked.</p><p>The former said mysteriously, “There will be a palm strike next. This kid’s chances of surviving that are almost zero.”</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>A phantom of Silvermoon Whitefox appeared behind Yue Lingshuang. She could feel that Ye Chen would face true danger this time—a life threatening danger. If she were not prepared, she would not be able to react in time.</p><p>“This old chap has even created the third style.” Huang Mei frowned. In her exchange a decade ago, Darklight King had only created two styles, and the third style had not even taken shape.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
