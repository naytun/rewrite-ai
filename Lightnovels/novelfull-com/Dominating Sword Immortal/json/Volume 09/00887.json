At the shorter hand, there were ten-year-cultivation-bases, and at the larger end, there were thousand-year-cultivation-bases, or even greater.</p><p>With so much Zhen Yuan, recovering one’s Zhen Yuan by solely relying on circulating one’s cultivation technique was extremely hard. This was because the disparity between king grade Zhen Yuan and Yuan Qi of the world was too big. The former went through numerous compressions and refining cycles. One would have to seclude themselves for a long time, and even that might not be possible depending on the loss one’s cultivation base had suffered. Hence, using supreme grade supreme grade stones was a much quicker option.</p><p>Unfortunately, supreme grade spirit stones were extremely rare, and also acted as currency between Kings. Unless one’s loss of cultivation base was not too big, Kings rarely used supreme grade spirit stones to replenish their Zhen Yuan. It seemed too big of a luxury.</p><p>If replenishing supreme grade spirit stones was considered luxurious, then using Zhen Yuan crystals for the same was simply being wasteful. The latter were much more precious than supreme grade spirit stones. Only Kings and a few master half-step Kings could refined Zhen Yuan crystals. If a Life and Death King were to refine Zhen Yuan crystals without eating or sleeping, the amount refined would be in the ratio of ten thousands to the number needed to replenish Zhen Yuan once.</p><p>When Ye Chen’s Undying Body’s cultivation base reached limb regrowth realm, he had used fifty thousand Zhen Yuan crystals. At this moment, disregarding Zhen Yuan purity, his cultivation base was around nine years. Of course, the Zhen Yuan crystals Ye Chen had were actually different from the Zhen Yuan crystals refined by Life and Death Kings. They were not pure enough, and even calling them low grade Zhen Yuan crystals was an overstretch. If he had true low grade Zhen Yuan grade crystals, ten thousand would have been probably enough instead of fifty thousand.</p><p>“This time, I’ve used up a whole seventy thousand Zhen Yuan crystals. I’ve less than two million one hundred thousand left. I should start to save up a bit.”</p><p>A low step King’s Zhen Yuan was ten folds lesser than a high step King’s, and five folds greater than the peak of life-and-death third’s chamber. Once Ye Chen entered Life and Death realm, he could use Zhen Yuan crystals to directly increase his cultivation base. At this moment, seventy thousand crystals replenished ninety-five percent of his Zhen Yuan, which meant approximately seventy five thousand crystals equaled his whole Zhen Yuan pool. Once he reached Life and Death realm, this effect would weaken by five times. Hence, three hundred and seventy five thousand Zhen Yuan crystals would represent his cultivation base, which equaled a nine-year-cultivation base. Hence, two million one hundred thousand crystals could increase his cultivation base to around fifty years.</p><p>A fifty-year-cultivation-base represented a bitter cultivation of fifty years. How astonishing was that?</p><p>The reason behind Blood Hand King’s low wealth was most likely due to him exchanging most of his treasures and supreme grade stones for treasures that could augment his cultivation base. After all, no matter how good treasures were, they were not as reliable as the cultivation base, apart from the treasures that could greatly increase one’s battle strength.</p><p>Having completely replenished his Zhen Yuan, Ye Chen stood up and walked out of the underground cave. Although he had already expelled Star Fire Poison, he was in no hurry to leave Bloodlight Ocean. He was merely a step away from the fifth step spirit body. As long as he could find a Blood Crystal Flower, he would attain the fifth step, following which, the strength of his body would greatly increase. The attacks that would have inflicted heavy injuries on his body would only leave light injuries. This meant a big cut down on his Zhen Yuan usage, and thus, a great increase in his survivability.</p><p>“Even if I can’t find a Blood Crystal Flower, a few low level Blood Demon Crystals are not bad either. They can’t increase my spirit body to the fifth step, but it’ll ease my future breakthrough somewhat.” Letting out a breath of turbid Qi, Ye Chen’s flashed into then distance.</p><p>…</p><p>“Third!”</p><p>With his newly advanced sixth step Destruction Sword Intent, Ye Chen found killing low level Blood Demon Kings too easy. Perhaps even high step Kings would not be able to kill low level Blood Demon Kings as easily as him. However, there was only one problem. Bloodlight Ocean was too big, and it was not so easy to come across low level Blood Demon Kings.</p><p>Ye Chen’s storage ring now had four low level Blood Demon Crystals.</p><p>“Continue!” Soon, he flew off once again.</p><p>On a mountain hump, another intense battle was underway.</p><p>“Monkey, dodge!” Anicca Spear King roared as the long spear in his hand weaved about like a dragon partly visible inside clouds and pierced a blood shadow’s head.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>A huge hole opened in the blood shadow’s head.</p><p>“Zeze…You two can’t do anything to me.”</p><p>The blood shadow was a mid level Blood Demon King, and it was several times more powerful than low level Blood Demon Kings. Kings of the same step had no chance against it, and only a high-step King could slowly grind it to death. This was the most frightening aspect of blood demons.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>The blood light flickered as the Blood Demon King was going for Iron Monkey King, who seemed to have weakened somewhat.</p><p>“Piss off!” Iron Monkey didn’t dare let it close the distance and spouted a light sphere.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Amidst an explosion of Qi ripples, the Blood Demon King’s hand shattered. However, it grinned and charged across the Qi ripples, arriving less than ten meters away from Iron Monkey King. At the crucial moment, Anicca Spear King’s sweeping spear struck the Blood Demon King, saving Iron Monkey King’s life.</p><p>“Courting death!” The Blood Demon King roared and changed its target to the other. Although the latter’s fleshy body was not strong as Iron Monkey King’s, he was more skillful. If he died, the battle would be more or less over.</p><p>The Blood Demon King raised its hand, and a blood colored light sphere condensed above its palm.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>With a wave of its palm, the blood sphere shot at Anicca Spear King. The latter knew that he could not afford to get hit. He could feel the terrifying devouring power inside the sphere. If it hit him, the consequences would be disastrous.</p><p>Hence, his figure danced and skillfully evaded the sphere.</p><p>“Dodge this time!”</p><p>Three more blood light spheres, arranged in a triangular manner, soon approached Annica Spear KIng. The Blood light spheres were too fast, so Anicca Spear King could only dodge two of them.</p><p>Peng! Anicca Spear King was safe, but a figure flew off from his side.</p><p>“Monkey!” Anicca Spear King’s eyes almost cracked open.</p><p>“Old Chang, don’t worry! I will not die so easily.” Iron Monkey King crawled out of the ground. His back seemed to have lost a huge chunk. As a Beast King, Iron Monkey King’s body was several times stronger than Anicca Spear King. This was the reason he dared to take the hit in the latter’s stead.</p><p>“It seems like we’ll be staying here.” Anicca Spear King let out a sigh of relief, then said bitterly.</p><p>“Yeah. Seems like us three brothers are all going to die at the same place. First was Black Horn, and now us.” Iron Monkey King also seemed unresigned.</p><p>The battle power of a mid level Blood Demon King was too high. Amongst mid step Kings and Beast Kings, it would fill the bottom places. However, the strength of Blood Demon Kings was not their battle strength, but their indestructible bodies. Regardless of how they attacked, they couldn’t inflict a substantial injury on its body. At most, they could only make it waste some power, which didn’t accomplish a thing.</p><p>“Eh, seems like you’re aware of your impending death.” The Blood Demon King seemed to be playing a game of cat-and-mouse.</p><p>“Humph! Even if I die, you will not be left unscathed. Try my strongest spear—Wing Cloud Conversion, Thunder Spear!” Annica Spear King bellowed as his figure shot forth and thrust out.</p><p>Crackle Crackle!</p><p>This move contained the wind profound and cloud profound that were already extremely powerful. However, through some means, Anicca Spear King managed to derive the power of lightning with wind and clouds as the base. This meant that his spear was carrying wind profound, cloud profound, as well as thunder profound. Of course, the amount of thunder profound was only a smidgen.</p><p>However, this smidgen was enough to more than double the might of the spear.</p><p>Along with the spear, bright lightning flickered, illuminating dozens of li around.</p><p>“This spear is frightening! It’s actually not much behind that masked man’s profound martial skill. Kings could be weak or strong, but the most important part is the comprehension of their profound martial skills.” Ye Chen had long sensed the energy ripples coming from the battle site. Watching distantly, he exclaimed inwardly.</p><p>“Power of thunder!”</p><p>The Blood Demon King’s face sunk. Amongst all the profounds, apart from space profound and time profound, thunder profound was one of the few it was the most afraid of. This derived lightning’s power was not weak. Although it would not die, some injuries would be unavoidable.</p><p>“Explode for me!”</p><p>The Blood Demon King shot out five blood light spheres, which exploded shortly after.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>In the end, Anicca Spear King was blasted off. However, the chest region of Blood Demon King had a burnt spear scar as well, emitting green smoke.</p><p>“Seems like now you’ve no strength left to resist.” Anicca Spear King didn’t directly die from the blood light spheres; he was merely blasted off due to the aftershocks. However, his aura had deflated like a balloon, and his face was pale white, completely devoid of blood.</p><p>Blood Demon King’s body turned into a blood ray and shot at Anicca Spear King. The injured Iron Monkey King, who had been flung far away before, had no chance of making it.</p><p>“Bewitching Mirror Shattering!”</p><p>Suddenly, Blood Demon King’s body was stuck in the void. And in the next moment, it shattered into a million pieces!</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Amidst scattering blood gales, Blood Demon King miserably screamed and immediately made its escape.</p><p>“You want to flee?”</p><p>Ye Chen wouldn’t let the mid level Blood Hand King escape. The blood demon crystal inside its body was invaluable, and its usefulness for him was second to only the Blood Crystal Flower. With the second use of Bewitching Mirror Shattering, the mid step Blood Demon King thoroughly died, and a blood red crystal dropped down.</p><p>“A mid level Blood Demon King is strong indeed. Even after my Destruction Sword Intent’s might increased by ten times, I couldn’t kill it in one strike.” Calling the falling blood demon crystal onto the palm of his hands, delight appeared on Ye Chen’s face. A mid step blood demon crystal could allow his spirit body’s breakthrough. Of course, he could still search for the Blood Crystal Flower. Even if he didn’t find it, he wouldn’t lose much.</p><p>“What, killing a mid level Blood Demon King in two strikes!” Anicca Spear King and Iron Monkey King stared Ye Chen unblinkingly. Moreover, once they discovered that he was not even a King, they were left totally stunned. This was simply beyond their comprehension. The terror of a mid level Blood Demon King was something they had just experienced firsthand. If Ye Chen had not appeared, they would have died for sure.</p><p>“Monster…This is what a monster looks like.” Anicca Spear King mumbled inwardly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
