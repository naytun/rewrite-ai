How can I lose to a human kid!” Giant Wolf King’s body shook, and his metal-like fur stood erect, making his body seem swell by several folds. His leg claw again stretched out, gleaming with a deep blue light and giving off an incomparable sharpness.</p><p>Bearing the exhaustion, Giant Wolf King raised his claw and suddenly slashed.</p><p>“Blue Iron Claw!”</p><p>Demonic beasts with high aptitudes usually had an innate skill, and Blue Iron Claw was his innate skill. He could tear apart anything with his claws.</p><p>“An innate skill!”</p><p>Ye Chen immediately discarded the idea of using the ghost from Blood Severing Ghost Finger, and the white-robed ghost figure dissipated with an eerie laugh. Meanwhile, he raised his Evil Shattering Sword and used the second style of Autumn Sword Arts—Congealing Water.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>The Blue Iron Claw was the innate skill of a Beast King after all; it immediately smashed Congealing Water. Although the remnant sword energy landed on Giant Wolf King’s body, it couldn’t pierce his defense. On the other hand, the deep blue colored claw slammed into Ye Chen’s Protective Zhen Yuan.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>Ye Chen spurted out a mouthful of blood. Even his armor couldn’t counteract such a strong claw energy. With his body flying off, he finally landed on an erect and towering mountain that looked like a sword.</p><p>‘Giant Wolf King’s strength is lower than Demonic Human Kings’, and should be around that of ordinary Kings, or even a bit weaker. His beast power is not uniformly integrated with his flesh.’ Ye Chen’s original intention of using Blood Severing Ghost Finger was to reduce Giant Wolf King’s beast power. However, he didn’t expect the move to cut off Giant Wolf King’s blood Qi. This caused the other’s current state to fall by quite a bit, which was much better than lowering his beast power.</p><p>However, Giant Wolf King was still a Beast King. Even with all these tricks, Ye Chen would still be at the losing end. This was because he couldn’t keep up with the consumption. A Beast King’s beast power reserves were indeed immense, dozens of times that of Ye Chen. Even ordinary Kings were no match in this aspect. If he couldn’t inflict a fatal wound soon, Giant Wolf King would regain his peak condition with only the cost of a little beast power.</p><p>“Die! Giant Wolf King again pounced, once again using his innate skill—Blue Iron Claw!</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Standing on the summit, Ye Chen again used Bewitching Mirror Shattering, destroying Blue Iron Claw’s claw energy.</p><p>The two continued to exchange blows. Giant Wolf King still had the advantage of moving through space. However, Ye Chen had his Sword Domain, which could strengthen the space and cause the other to spend a lot more power to open the space while making the process twice as slow. In the end, he might as well give up on moving through space and directly fight Ye Chen.</p><p>With his Zhen Yuan flowing out like water, Ye Chen’s expression gravened.</p><p>“Seems like I must use the Sky Scorpio Sword.”</p><p>If he didn’t use Sky Scorpio Sword, he would not have any Zhen Yuan left to do so.</p><p>Ha!</p><p>He slashed hard, making Giant Wolf King retreat. Using this moment, he sheathed the Evil Shattering Sword, and at the same time, a dominating purple-silver sword appeared in his hands. The sword hilt was deep black, in the shape of a scorpion—it was the supreme grade sword, Sky Scorpio Sword.</p><p>“Congealing Water!”</p><p>With the Sky Scorpio Sword in hand, Ye Chen immediately used the second style of Autumn Water Sword Arts.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>The extremely condensed sword energy pierced through the space. With that, the edges of space turned crystalline, giving off a purplish glow.</p><p>Kacha!</p><p>In the face of this attack, Giant Wolf King’s Protective Bestial Power could no longer hold out and was instantly pierced. The sword energy fell on his right shoulder and made its way inside his body. As a result, his right shoulder instantly crystallized, and the might of Congealing Water erupted on the crystallized arm and caused it to shatter immediately with a bang, creating a downpour of light specks.</p><p>Awoo!</p><p>A miserable shriek resounded.</p><p>“A supreme grade sword…Damn it, you actually have a supreme grade sword!” Having lost a chunk of his body, Giant Wolf King almost shattered the space with his body and reappeared a hundred li away. He immediately operated his Undying Body, and new flesh wriggled out of his body, rapidly renewing his lost shoulder. However, his aura rapidly weakened at the same time. The last sword had injured his internal organs, and the crystalline power had transmitted even further. Moreover, the realm of his Undying Body was merely at that of limb regrowth. Thus, this restoration was not that easy for him. At this moment, he was only relying on his bestial power reserves to suppress his injuries, which was obviously not the same as truly healing.</p><p>“You have a supreme grade sword?” From a hundred li away, Giant Wolf King had Ye Chen in a death stare.</p><p>“So what?” With the Sky Scorpio Sword pointed obliquely at the ground and its tip indefinitely flickering with a purple glow, Ye Chen said indifferently.</p><p>“Today’s matter will not end here. I, Giant Wolf King, vow to kill you without fail.” Giant Wolf King was extremely tempted to silence everybody on the scene so that this matter would not spread out. However, he didn’t dare. All the young experts on the scene had numerous Beast Kings and Life and Death Kings as their backing. Thus, he could only kill Ye Chen later to wash off this humiliation.</p><p>“If you don’t leave now, you won’t be able to.”</p><p>Ye Chen again thrust out, and the sword Qi shot forth like a falling meteor. Giant Wolf King’s eyes opened wide before he escaped into the space with his tail between his legs.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>However, the sword energy also cleaved through the space and disappeared. Indistinctly, everybody heard Giant Wolf King’s roar, causing them to look at each other in dismay.</p><p>Huff!</p><p>Losing half of his Zhen Yuan in one go caused Ye Chen extreme exhaustion. When at mid half-step King realm, Ye Che could use Evil Shattering Sword with all his might five times. As his realm increased to high half-step King realm, he could use it ten times, then twelve times at the first layer, fourteen times at the second layer, and eighteen times at the third layer.</p><p>Previously, he’d used Evil Shattering Sword twelve times at full power, costing him one-fourth of his Zhen Yuan. Later on, the consumption of Zhen Yuan by Sky Scorpio Sword was even more frightening, emptying half of his Zhen Yuan. When taken into account, he could only use the Sky Scorpio Sword five times.</p><p>Of course, with its enormous Zhen Yuan consumption, Sky Scorpio Sword was just as frightening. When compared to the pseudo supreme grade Evil Shattering Sword, which was a bit more than half as powerful than the most ordinary supreme grade swords, the difference was enormous.</p><p>Only by relying on the Sky Scorpio Sword could Ye Chen heavily injure Giant Wolf King and force his escape.</p><p>With a large number of Zhen Yuan crystals in his hands, Ye Chen rapidly supplemented the Zhen Yuan deficiency in his body.</p><p>“Giant Wolf King was beaten back. Ye Chen won against Giant Wolf King!”</p><p>“Fighting Giant Wolf King skipping realms…How is this possible?”</p><p>“Too frightening! Thinking back, even Mysterious Queen could only contend against Kings at this level. She was not able to defeat them, but Ye Chen actually did.”</p><p>Fighting against a Life and Death King as a ‘strongest’ half-step King had been rare since the ancient era. But, to defeat one, such a feat had never been done in at least a few dozen thousand years. Of course, the spectating young experts understood clearly that Ye Chen had to rely on Sky Scorpio Sword to accomplish this feat, whereas Mysterious Queen had no supreme grade treasure, and could only rely on her own strength.</p><p>However, even so, Ye Chen’s own strength was no weaker than of Mysterious Queen from back then</p><p>“If this news spreads out, the entire True Spirit World would be stunned!” Somebody said.</p><p>“For sure! A genius of the same level as Mysterious Queen has appeared, so how could it not stun the world? Once he enters Life and Death Realm, how frightening would he be!”</p><p>Linghu Yi looked at Ye Chen in a daze while thinking, ‘In the fight between him and Extreme Sky Sect, who was in the wrong? As long as he doesn’t die, Extreme Sky Sect will have no standing.’</p><p>‘Alright! Regardless of whether he falls or not, it would be best if Extreme Sky Sect provoked him the least possible.’</p><p>Ye Chen didn’t know that due to his fight just now, Linghu Yi had decided to not make an enemy out of him, saving Eternal Sky Sect a huge enemy.</p><p>Linghu Yi didn’t dare gamble. The appearance of Ye Chen made it clear to him that he couldn’t tangle himself in mundane affairs, and must cultivate with all his heart. Letting out a deep sigh, he turned around and flew off.</p><p>Meanwhile, the others started to leave one after another as well. But, before leaving, they would take a final glance of Ye Chen, as if trying to imprint his figure deep in their minds. Regardless of whether they admitted or not, as long as he didn’t die, he would certainly become one of the major figures of True Spirit World.</p><p>“Ye Chen, seems like my concern was in vain.” Lashan Mei smiled bitterly.</p><p>Ye Chen spoke while refining the Zhen Yuan crystals, “I’m still grateful.” As he spoke, his gaze swept through the depths of void for a moment, seemingly accidentally.</p><p>In the depths of void…</p><p>A thin man was stroking his chin, “Mei-er’s eyes are pretty good. This kid has the aptitude to vie for the top. In the time of need, Demonic Blade Sect can also show some goodwill. To give charcoal in winter is always better than adding flowers on a brocade.” With a flicker, the middle-aged man disappeared.</p><p>…</p><p>In the void between Sky Tiger Sect and Desolate Mountain Range, a white-robed woman stood silently. Before her was a white colored light ring, in which, the scene of Desolate Mountain was playing out. The appearances of Ye Chen and Lashan Mei in the ring seemed extremely vivid.</p><p>“Seems like I don’t need to make an appearance.” The white-robed woman smiled. “But, this one is troublesome.”</p><p>With a pat of her hands, the white ring of light dissipated as she turned around and looked far into the void. A few moments later, a domineering-looking tall and sturdy middle-aged man was seen flying over.</p><p>The middle-aged man was wearing a silver-colored battle robe, and aggressiveness exuded out of his body. The spatial power curled around his body, but was incapable of touching him.</p><p>“Sky Tiger King, I hope you’ve been well.” The white-robed woman said indifferently.</p><p>“Mysterious Queen! Who would have thought that you dare to come to my Blood Sky Continent.” Sky Tiger King deeply frowned and said gravely.</p><p>“This is no forbidden zone, so why can’t I come here?” Mysterious Queen didn’t seem to care one bit.</p><p>“You’re intentionally blocking me!” Sky Tiger King squinted.</p><p>“Three years…After three years, I’ll not stop you.”</p><p>“Three years, what a joke! Who knows if he’ll even become a King! Impossible!” Sky Tiger King immediately agreed.</p><p>Nobody knew how the battle between the two of them would turn out. Hence, Sky Tiger King returned and went into seclusion for three years. Of course, that was a tale for later on.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
