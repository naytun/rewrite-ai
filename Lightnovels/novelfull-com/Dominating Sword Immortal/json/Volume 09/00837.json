He is the grand disciple of the Undying Demon Sect and cultivates the Nine Turn Undying Demon Art. It’s said that he’s already upgraded his Nine Turns Undying Demon Art to heaven grade, allowing him to possess the most basic Undying Body. His cultivation base is also frightening, already in the second layer of Life-and Death Chamber. His ranking is a bit low compared to the Young Elephant Lord, at fifth place.”</p><p>“Nine Turn Undying Demon Art? The most basic Undying Body?”</p><p>Ye Chen turned pensive. According to his guess, the Nine Turn Undying Demon Art should be similar to his secret art of cultivating the Undying Art, which allowed one to possess Undying Body after cultivating to Life and Death Realm. Who could have expected such an art to exist! Moreover, this Young Undying Demon Lord was like him, capable of upgrading his cultivation technique to heaven grade before attaining the Life-and-Death realm. Such talent and ability was indeed exceptionally rare!</p><p>“So, the Young Undying Demon Lord, Young Elephant Lord, and Young Serpent Lord are young experts of the same level. Amongst them, the strongest is the Young Elephant Lord?” Ye Chen asked casually.</p><p>Gao Zhiyuan shook his head, “Can’t say for sure. Life and Death Substitute List only changes once in a decade. A weak candidate from then might not necessarily be weak now. Young Elephant Lord’s spirit power is boundless and nobody can fight him head on, but the Young Undying Demon Lord is an exception. He is the only one who can exchange hundred moves with him. Even those ranked above Young Lord Elephant Lord will not choose to fight him head on.”</p><p>“Oh right, nobody in the past ten years became Life and Death Kings?” Ye Chen suddenly asked.</p><p>Gao Zhiyuan explained, “No. The current Life and Death Substitute List only has thirty-two names, and the remaining four candidates have become Life and Death Kings. Young Elephant Lord was originally ranked fifth, but became third because the first and second rankers became Life and Death Kings.”</p><p>“I see!” Ye Chen faintly nodded. Those who became Life and Death Kings would be automatically removed from the list, and those behind would rise consequently.</p><p>“The number two among the Four Demons is a demonic human titled Reverend Mad Iron. Although he is not a perfect vessel demonic human, he’s already grasped the ability of perfect demonic conversion. Like his name, he is arrogant and incredibly moody, which ought to be because of demonic conversion.”</p><p>“He is ranked twenty-two, one rank above the Young Tiger Lord.”</p><p>“Number three is Demoness Blade, Lashan Mei. She is the grand disciple of Demonic Blade Sect—the dazzling talent of Blood Sky continent of the decade. Along with the Young Eagle Lord of the eight great young demon beast lords, the two are called the twin demon stars. Her potential is the absolute cream of the crop.”</p><p>“As for the fourth, it’s Extreme Sky Sect’s Linghu Yi. All Four Demons and Eight Demon Beast Young Lords come from fifth grade sects or clans except him. Therefore, his reputation is quite high, and nobody dares to look down on him. As for his origins, the Extreme Sky Sect, it’s the number one sixth grade sect of Blood Sky Continent.”</p><p>Gao Zhiyuan spoke without a pause.</p><p>As expected!</p><p>Ye Chen calmly smiled. With Demoness Blade’s strength and cultivation base, it was impossible for her to be counted amongst the Four Demons. According to Gao Zhiyuan, she, along with Young Eagle Lord, were the most dazzling geniuses of Blood Sky Continent. Although strength of the Young Elephant Lord, Young Snake Lord, and the others was great, their potential was not as good as hers. As for Linghu Yi, he naturally couldn’t be underestimated either. According to his vital Qi, he only seemed to be around thirty years old, even a bit younger than Bai Wuxue. With his cultivation base, he could be an absolute star on the True Spirit Continent.</p><p>Ye Chen let out a sigh of relief, seeing that Extreme Sky Sect was not creating trouble for Mo Xiaotiang. It was probably Linghu Yi telling them that their strength was not sufficient. So, instead of fighting to their last breath, they decided to calmly watch the situation unfold.</p><p>However, Ye Chen knew that it was still quite troublesome for Gao Zhiyuan. Mo Xiaotang was his fiancée. However, Eternal Sky Sect’s female disciple, Li Cui, had feelings for him, and he might not be completely unconcerned.</p><p>After chatting for a while, Ye Chen had more or less grasped the situation. Taking out a deep-purple sword from his storage ring, Ye Chen handed it to Gao Zhiyuan, “You are Eternal Sky Sect’s grand disciple, so you can’t be without a sword. This sword is for you.”</p><p>The latter observed the sword for a moment, then astoundedly said, “Half supreme grade sword!”</p><p>Half supreme grade swords were not cabbages; only half-step Kings could typically have one. This was the same reasoning as ‘Riches are accompanied with danger.”</p><p>“You can head back first.”</p><p>Ye Chen didn’t care about a half-supreme grade sword as he had gained plenty of swords from the Sky Scorpio King’s tomb. Moreover, he no longer found a half-supreme grade as charming as before. The rich got richer and the poor got poorer. This was also the truth of martial dao.</p><p>…</p><p>Half a month passed by, leaving only half a month in the opening of the Life and Death Secret Realm. In this time period, Ye Chen’s Spiritual Sword Attack finally broke through, taking its might and speed to another level. Moreover, his fast profound also increased to sixty percent from fifty percent. Unfortunately, the slow profound showed no progress. He reckoned that it would only improve once his fast profound reached seventy percent completion.</p><p>His Spiritual Sword Attack, which now contained sixty percent fast profound and wood profound, reached a subtle equilibrium, increasing the might and sword speed tremendously. At this point, Ye Chen felt that having both the profound equally comprehended had a substantial effect on merging the two profound.</p><p>“Waning Moon contains ninety percent completed metal profound, but water profound is only at sixty percent. The difference is two big, and bringing about an equilibrium is too hard. I need to be mindful of the water profound from now on and let metal profound take its own course.”</p><p>…</p><p>Chaotic Demon Region, Demon Blade Sect, Demoness Summit…</p><p>“Senior Sister, please advise me!” A male disciple of the Demon Blade Sect was firmly staring at Lanshan Mei while pointing the blade towards the ground diagonally.</p><p>“Come!” Lanshan Mei indifferently spoke without taking out her blade.</p><p>“Be careful senior sister, Ha!”</p><p>This male disciple’s cultivation base was at the late Sea of Souls realm. Of course, it was nothing in comparison to Lanshan Mei; one was akin to the heavens while the other was earth. However, in the exchange of pointers, neither of the two used Zhen Yuan or will. It was purely a contest of physical power.</p><p>The male disciple slashed out as the blade in his hands vibrated, turning indistinct. It was Demon Blade Sect’s exclusive art—Demon Blade Arts—which employed energy through the blade.</p><p>“Not perfect enough. You’re leaving too big of an opening.” Lanshan Mei’s right hand turned blade shaped before she chopped down.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The male disciple’s blade flew off and stuck in the ground, incessantly vibrating.</p><p>“You all can come together.” She swept her gaze through the remaining eight spectators, who didn’t decline. Not only Senior Sister’s cultivation base was high, under no Zhen Yuan usage condition, nobody could fight her under Life and Death realm in the whole sect.</p><p>Clang Clang Clang!</p><p>Eight blades flew off, not injuring a hair of Lanshan Mei.</p><p>“Mei-er’s Demonic Blade Arts have reached great completion. This time’s training seems quite fruitful for her.” On a summit shrouded in black clouds, a tall old man faintly smiled.</p><p>“He probably doesn’t fear the Demon Blade Arts!” The image of Ye Chen slashing the head off Bandit Leader appeared in Lanshan Mei’s eyes. That sword was the peak of swiftness, with nothing superficial about it.</p><p>…</p><p>Mud Dragon Mountain was a small mountain eight hundred li away from the Eternal Sky Sect, as ordinary as its name suggested.</p><p>“Elder, is there really a high level mid grade spirit stone mine under this mountain?” An honest looking middle-aged man asked the old man before him.</p><p>The old man replied while grinning from ear to ear, “Indeed, I just probed! Seems like the heavens are favoring my Eternal Sky Sect.”</p><p>Eternal Sky Sect was extremely lacking in resources. If they found such a mine, they could expand their disciple pool by a lot without a worry.</p><p>The two immediately send the message back to the sect. Upon receiving the information, Eternal Wind Li was ecstatic yet anxious. Mud Dragon Mountain should fall under the territory of Eternal Sky Sect, but if this information was leaked, Eternal Sky Sect would not be able to keep this spirit stone mine. The three great sects would be like tigers stalking its prey.</p><p>“Dig the mine with full force. Take out as many spirit stones as you can and bring them back once every day.” As far as the sect was concerned, only when they had the spirit stones would the mine be considered theirs.</p><p>Unfortunately, there was no secret under the heavens that could be kept forever, and the information of the mine still made it to three great sects. It was not a leak from their side, but the strict monitoring from the three great sects inevitably giving them a few clues. Then, it was only a matter of finding a spider through its web.</p><p>“Members of Eternal Sky Sect, get the hell out of this area or die!”</p><p>In the sky above Mud Dragon Mountain, three groups of people appeared simultaneously. One was dressed in white-black long robes with a ferocious bald eagle carved on the back—the members of Bald Eagle Valley. The second group comprised of huge men, with a huge bear head on the chest portion of their robes —the members of Wordly Bear Clan. Of course, the last group was that of the Extreme Sky Sect.</p><p>The one who spoke was the patriarch of Wordly Bear Clan. They had always been fiery and all too willing to engage in slaughter. Wordly Bear Clan was precisely the one whose half-step Demonic Beast King had damaged Eternal Sky Sect’s, Elder Lu’s consciousness, causing his strength to plummet.</p><p>“Gentlemen, this place is under the territory of my Eternal Sky Sect. This conduct of yours is a breach of rules.” One of the elders from Eternal Sky Sect stepped out. They had only mined the mine for a few days, not even managing to take off a thousandth. How could they just hand it over?</p><p>“Rules? My Worldly Bear Clan is the rules.”</p><p>Puff!</p><p>Worldly Bear Clan’s patriarch punched out, and that elder instantly turned into blood mist.</p><p>“Elder Lin!” Everybody from Eternal Sky Sect stared at him while gnashing their teeth.</p><p>“Bastard, die!”</p><p>Mud Dragon Mountain suddenly burst apart as Elder Lu flew out and swept his sword at Worldly Bear Clan’s patriarch.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>However, it was futile as a sinister and tough looking old man walked out and shattered the sword Qi with a punch and then grinned evilly, “Surnamed Lu, seems like last time wasn’t enough for you. Then, let make you a bit more retarded.”</p><p>“It’s you!” Elder Lu’s eyes turned red. The impression of this man in his mind was too strong, as if imprinted permanently.</p><p>“Six half-step Kings…I wonder if that genius will accept reality or struggle?” Hidden amidst the Extreme Sky Sect’s group, their supreme elder sneered.</p><p>Linghu Hou said, “To fight against six powerhouse half-step Kings by himself is futile. Nobody can save the Eternal Sky Sect.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
