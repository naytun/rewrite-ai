He was extremely fast; it was almost within a blink of an eye before he appeared in front of Ye Chen with his sword attack. The bright sword light was so intense that it almost looked invincible.</p><p>The elder was fast, but Ye Chen’s movement was even faster. Although he reacted later, his fingers were already in position as if he was waiting for the elder’s sword.</p><p>Chin! His fingers were tough like steel, and that sword light of his was even more powerful. It easily held onto his opponent’s sword, generating bright sparks.</p><p>“He got it?” Li Zhangfeng had his mouth wide open as he gasped.</p><p>“He managed to clamp the Great Master’s sword! How is this possible!” The masters, staff members, and disciples standing behind Li Zhangfeng were all shocked as they stared at Ye Chen’s fingers without even blinking. Those slim fingers seemed so fragile and smooth, which was such a big contrast with the Great Master’s sword. However, it was indeed those two fingers that had stopped the sword.</p><p>“His power should be almost equal to senior Qing Liu…He should be at the top of the top.”</p><p>Half step king warriors would not be judged by their cultivation, since the martial spirit and profound martial arts would be a part of it as well. The elder with grey hair was able to have this level of power, which was indeed already impressive. More than ninety percent of the half step king warriors on the true spirit continent were normal king warriors. But, it was not that their cultivation was not high enough, but mainly that it was impossible for them to create powerful martial arts because of their limited talent.</p><p>“Star Dot Explosion!”</p><p>Seeing that his sword had been clamped, the elder yelled as he shook his wrist. As the tip of his sword vibrated, a wave of even brighter starlight appeared from within. A surprising power poured out of the sword and struck at Ye Chen’s fingers, wanting to break them.</p><p>“Eh? The sword skills are indeed rather smart.”</p><p>Ye Chen flicked his eyebrows as his fingers shook to neutralize that power. Meanwhile, his middle finger rested on his thumb before he flicked out a finger attack toward the tip of the sword.</p><p>Chin!</p><p>Although the half extreme rank sword in the elder’s hand was only a normal one, it would be impossible to be shattered by one finger attack of Ye Chen’s. Moreover, Ye Chen was not even trying his minimal yet. However, although the sword was not broken, the elder could not handle the incoming finger power. The sword was bent and the elder’s hand shattered, bleeding a little and almost causing the sword to drop.</p><p>“Senior, I think it would be best for you to stop!” Ye Chen did not try to attack again as he took ten steps backward and said to the elder. However, he had not expected it that the elder would not stop, but actually roar again and throw out another attack at him. That cold sword light drew a line in the air, slicing down a corner of a mountain peak.</p><p>“This Great Master has some serious problems.” Ye Chen frowned and a bad look appeared on his face.</p><p>He performed his sword steps and completely ignored that bent sword light, appearing in front of the elder with grey hair immediately and throwing out a punch. It did not just contain one hundred thousand pounds of physical power, but also his old-favorite martial art—Thunder Devour.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The elder was blown away, his hair ending up messed up.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The elder was ready to fight again as if he was a mad man who could not listen to other people’s words.</p><p>Seeing that, Ye Chen did not know what to say, because he could sense that the elder was not in his right mind. He was not only unresponsive to his opponents, he could not analyze his opponent’s power at all. He had just attacked continuously, as if he would not stop until he was killed.</p><p>“Great Master! It is me, Li Zhangfeng!”</p><p>As Ye Chen was in the distance, Li Zhangfeng seized the chance and opened his hands to block in front of him, his eyes full of guilt.</p><p>“Zhang…Feng! You are Zhangfeng! I know you!” The elder was slightly awakened and he stopped trying to run toward Ye Chen.</p><p>“Great Master, he is a disciple of the old ancestor, a friend of our school. He did not come to humiliate us. You don’t have to worry.” Li Zhangfeng said with patience.</p><p>“Oh! He is a friend, did not come to humiliate us! Then, I don’t have to worry.” The elder said while chuckling, carrying a gentle look in his eyes. Seeing that, Li Zhangfeng almost burst into tears. Some of the female masters or disciples could no longer hold it in as they covered their mouths while weeping quietly.</p><p>“Senor Li, what happened to this elder?” Ye Chen asked.</p><p>Turning around, Li Zhangfeng took a deep breath and said, “Great Master cannot think straight anymore, sorry for the trouble from before.”</p><p>“Oh, I see!”</p><p>Ye Chen was still a bit in doubt. He knew that the elder’s mental issues were not fake, but there must be something else happening here. Otherwise, everyone in the school would not have been this sad or even angry.</p><p>Li Zhangfeng did not want to struggle with this matter as he forced a smile. “Oh, please pardon me as a host, I didn’t even catch your name. I wonder how could we address you?”</p><p>“My name is Ye Chen.” Ye Chen greeted with his fists together.</p><p>“Then I will address you with your name.” Li Zhangfeng nodded before speaking to everyone in the school with a loud voice. “Alright, Ye Chen is not an enemy! Everyone, get back to what you were doing before!”</p><p>With the leader giving out a direct order, everyone started to scatter. Li Zhangfeng and the senior masters surrounded Ye Chen as they made their way to the lobby. As for the elder with grey hair, he did not talk to anyone anymore and just flew back to his own peak while giggling. Soon, the wide plaza became empty.</p><p>Inside the lobby…</p><p>Li Zhangfeng thought for a while and then asked Ye Chen, “Are you from the True Spirit Continent?” According to Li famiy’s recording, Battle King came from the true spirit continent instead of Blood Sky Land. So, Ye Chen should also be from there.</p><p>Ye Chen nodded, “Indeed!”</p><p>“So, for you to come here today, besides telling us all about our ancestor, is there some other reason?” It would be impossible for Li Zhangfeng not to have any hopes. Ye Chen was way much more powerful than the Great Master, and he would be at least at top half step king warrior level. If there were a top half step king warrior protecting the school, then the school would indeed become more powerful, and no one would try to bully them anymore.</p><p>Ye Chen said truthfully, “Battle King had asked me before to check on the school. Although he did not ask me directly to help out, I am not a man of cold heart. So, I naturally would not let the school be unattended. If senior Li does not mind, then I would like to have a job here.”</p><p>“You are willing to be a man of Zhang Tian Martial School?”</p><p>Li Zhangfeng’s eyes brightened once again and his breath hastened. Inside the lobby, all the masters were full of joy as well. Right now, the school was in a very bad position, and they desperately needed someone like Ye Chen to protect them.</p><p>“I also have my own family and martial school inside the true spirit continent. Therefore, I will not be fully committed to this. But, senior Li can definitely treat me as one of your own for sure.”</p><p>“Your willingness to join our school has already made me super happy. Why would I care about anything else? How about this? If you do not mind, then you can just be like the Great Master and become the second Great master of our school. Normally, the martial school would not bother you that much, so you can just solely focus on your cultivation.”</p><p>Naturally, Li Zhangfeng would not have asked him to be an inner master, because it would just not be fair. Both his age and power were more than enough for the position.</p><p>Ye Chen did not try to stop him. He was a Great Master in Sky Cloud Martial School as well, so it would not be a bad deal really, because at least there would not be much that would need his attention.</p><p>After finalizing his role, the following conversation would be much more relaxed. After a while, Ye Chen could not help but ask, “Leader, what happened to Immortal School Martial School? Why was there a name change? And, why are there only this many disciples?”</p><p>Li Zhangfeng seemed to be waiting for Ye Chen to ask the questions, so he answered, “This is a bit of a long story, but I will just tell you the short version for now.”</p><p>“The school was at its peak when the ancestor was still in the Blood Sky Land. All of the masters and disciples added together would make up to a couple million. We used to rule over the whole region. Even one of the top ten beast martial schools, the Iron paw beast martial school, could not compete with us. But when there were people, there would be conflicts. It was indeed because the immortal martial school was too powerful that when the immortal sword master was fighting the other martial schools, it had messed with a lot of different groups.”</p><p>Ye Chen nodded. The more powerful the martial schools were, the more trouble the school would have to handle.</p><p>“It was all not too bad when the ancestor was here. But, once he left, some of the groups started to plan their evil plots. Good thing was that they knew that he would come back one day for sure even though he had left here. Therefore, they had stopped at bay. But after two hundred years, they knew he had not been back at all, and there had been rumors that the ancestor had been killed by someone on the true spirit continent. In the end, those groups decided not to wait anymore.”</p><p>Li Zhangfeng tightened his fists. “They were just trying to bully us in the beginning. But later on, they went onto killing us, starting from the most powerful warriors. Especially the Iron Paw Beast Martial School, they had led their army and joined forces with others to fight us. If it were not for the rule inside the Blood Sky Land that Life and Death Realm warriors or beast kings would not be involved in the killings of a martial school without opponents of similar level, the school would have long been history.”</p><p>“Blood Sky Land also has this rule!” Ye Chen was thinking.</p><p>“Indeed! It was indeed because of the rule that it gave us some kind of hope. But, there were just way too many enemies, and it would be impossible to stop all of them. In the end, a powerful but mysterious emperor level warrior appeared and stopped all of the enemies from killing every last of us, suggesting us to change our name. He also set the rule that no one was allowed to come and kill us after the name change. Otherwise, the intruder would be killed on sight.”</p><p>“Mysterious emperor level king warrior?” Ye Chen was surprised. Without help, the school would not have survived until now. And it turned out that the help came from an emperor level warrior.</p><p>“The school changed the name to Zhang Tian Martial School in the end, and we moved out here while the wolf pack took over our old place. ”</p><p>“However, they would still not let us go. They encouraged some of the groups around us to suppress us from growing back again. We have already lost a lot of good men from the killings before, and naturally, we were once again being put in an even weaker place. We were losing more and more disciples, and the powerful ones just disappeared mysteriously. Today, there are only thousands of us still left out here.”</p><p>“What kind of parties are around here?” Ye Chen continued to ask.</p><p>“The most powerful ones are all rank 6 martial schools or families, namely the Extreme Heaven Martial School, the Nature Bear Family, and the Bald Eagle Valley.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
