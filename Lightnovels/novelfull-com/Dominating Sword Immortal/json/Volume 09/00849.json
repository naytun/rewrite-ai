Raising its thick right claw, it fiercely swatted down, causing the space itself to crack. It clearly had the ability to shatter the space, though it seemed certainly inferior to that of a Life and Death King.</p><p>“It can actually tear the space!” Ye Chen’s pupils shrank in shock. The evil spirit’s battle strength was beyond what he’d imagined. He operated his Zhen Yuan to its limits, almost burning his blood Qi. Following his right arm, it concentrated on the Evil Vanquishing Sword, giving the sword a sparkling jade-like glow before he chopped it down.</p><p>Clang! Puff!</p><p>The collision of the sword and the claw shook the space, opening several black spatial tears. Under such space-shattering power, Ye Chen’s Evil Vanquishing Sword bent into an astonishing arc and was subsequently bounced off, forcing him three-four li back. At the same time, frightening ripples emanated from the point of collision. It scrapped off layers of the ground one after another, creating dozens of meters deep crater in the ground.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>Ye Chen was at a disadvantage under Life and Death realm for the first time. The battle power of the evil spirit was undoubtedly higher than his.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>In the air, the giant wolf evil spirit paused for a moment before pouncing on Ye Chen once more. As it moved, the space behind was left twisted, looking indistinct and confusing.</p><p>With his Immortal Body, Ye Chen didn’t suffer any injuries at all. His feet slightly sunk into the ground from the impact before his entire body leaped up. The Evil Vanquishing Sword in his hands emitted a hundred little stars; it was none other than his fastest sword art—Spiritual Sword. As soon as he used this art, his perception was pushed to the extreme, and each sword attack targeted the openings of the evil spirit.</p><p>Awooo!</p><p>With a roar, the giant wolf evil spirit charged into the densely packed starry region., and numerous sword holes appeared on its body in the next moment. The sword holes erupted open, becoming as big as a fist. With that, the evil spirit momentarily stopped in the air, seemingly turning rigid.</p><p>“Waning Moon!” Holding the sword with both his hands, Ye Chen slashed down.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Black-colored waning moon pierced through the evil spirit’s head and followed to its chest, almost slashing a small section of its body and covering that section in a blinding sword light. However, a peak level evil spirit was just that: a peak level evil spirit. It was extremely hard to disperse. Even after getting hit from Waning Moon, it seemed full of vitality as it swung its two claws at Ye Chen. The edges of the claws left pitch-black slits that contained enormous attractive force.</p><p>Kleng!</p><p>The evil spirit’s attacks were too fast, so Ye Chen could barely raise his sword in defense. The space-shattering power made his entire being obliquely fly out. Ultimately, his feet landed on the ground and skidded on the ground, creating huge strips on the ground.</p><p>“The realm of the first layer is still a bit too low.” Ye Chen frowned as a small internal injury appeared in his body. Fortunately, his Immortal Body had already started working on it. “Don’t tell me I have to use Sky Scorpio Sword?” He was quite hesitant.</p><p>“No, I can’t! Tge Sky Scorpio is my last resort. If it’s not a matter of life-and-death, I’d better not use it. Otherwise, it will become a dependence, which will become a difficult bottleneck in advancing realms. It will end up more of a loss, and not worth it. Seems like I’ll have to go all out.”</p><p>Ye Chen’s body shook as he released his Sword Domain around the evil spirit.</p><p>Sword Domain was the domain of a sword artist. In addition to offense and great killing power, it also had the ability to suppress the opponent. The giant wolf evil spirit’s speed, which was exceptionally high, decreased by twenty percent, instantly turning sluggish in the eyes of Ye Chen.</p><p>With the backing of the sword domain, dealing with the evil spirit turned a lot easier for him. At the very least, dealing with its excessive speed was no longer as tiresome.</p><p>Of course, even though its movement and attack speed had slowed down, it was still a peak level evil spirit. Ye Chen’s attacks couldn’t inflict heavy damage on it. He could at most leave some small scars on its body, which were basically useless. Moreover, the evil spirit still succeeded in one out of its ten counterattacks.</p><p>“Peak level evil spirit’s life-and-death Qi is too rich. It can make me use all of my Zhen Yuan, then easily kill me. No wonder Battle King spent an entire day killing this thing.” Ye Chen sighed before his gaze sharpened. “Bewitching Mirror Shattering!”</p><p>As he retreated, countless strands of spatial power curled around the Evil Vanquishing Sword, making it seem as if it had warped and folded over itself. The sword’s trajectory turned impossible to see, seeming as if there was no point beyond its reach.</p><p>The Giant Wolf Evil Spirit was hit squarely without any possibility of dodging the sword.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>In the next moment, the giant wolf evil spirit was sealed inside a seemingly mirror-space. The mirror-space rapidly warped in and then shattered with a bang. Cracks spread out in the void, creating chaotic attractive forces. Relying on Bewitching Mirror Shattering, Ye Chen also had the power to shatter space.</p><p>Awooo!</p><p>Countless sinister scars appeared on the evil spirit’s huge body. Even the shallowest scars were several inches deep while the deepest ones were almost dividing the body into two halves. Such destructive power far surpassed that of Waning Moon.</p><p>“Eh, a token!”</p><p>Deep within the scar, Ye Chen spotted a stone medal inside the evil spirit’s body.</p><p>“It’s a Life and Death Token!” A name appeared in Ye Chen’s mind.</p><p>Life and Death Mysterious Realm was divided into three sections—outer region, enclosed inner region, and core region. The core region had Life and Death Palace, and the basic requirement of entering this palace was precisely a Life and Death Token.</p><p>In other words, Life and Death Token was a pass to enter the Life and Death Palace.</p><p>“But, killing this peak grade evil spirit is not looking too probable.” Ye Chen smiled bitterly. The scars on the evil spirit’s body were rapidly closing. Of course, as it healed, its life-and-death Qi was also reducing, seemingly decreasing a lot. However, this place was full of life-and-death Qi, and the evil spirit was already absorbing it from the surroundings by relying on its body.</p><p>“Either escape or kill it with absolute brute force. There is no third option.” Ye Chen had gained a deep understanding of peal level evil spirits.</p><p>The evil spirit’s battle power restored back to its peak almost instantly. Ye Chen even doubted if he’d had a misconception, because the evil spirit seemed more powerful than before. The thick evil aura it emanated was even causing minute ripples in space.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>With his unshakable confidence, Ye Chen didn’t retreat and faced the giant wolf evil spirit instead. The Evil Vanquishing Sword was emitting a sword Qi that seemed on the verge of tearing through space.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>One man and one beast engaged in a grand battle once again. Intense energy ripples spread out in every direction, and could be clearly felt even up to tens of thousands of li.</p><p>“Who is fighting?”</p><p>“Such frightening ripples! Could a party be dealing with a peak level evil spirit?”</p><p>“Peak level evil spirits have Life and Death Tokens in their bodies. Seems like some people can’t wait any longer and have begun to form parties.”</p><p>Although the number of people left in the core area were not many, the absolute majority being already carried out of the secret realm, the core area itself was not that big. Thus, the remaining people were not that separated, allowing six-seven individuals to sense the ripples. However, they never considered for a moment that somebody could be fighting an evil spirit alone. After all, peak level evil spirits were not existences that could be contested alone.</p><p>Although they quite wished to go and take a look, they didn’t dare. Everybody inside the secret realm was a rival. If they went, they would most likely be walking to their doom, not due to the evil spirit but the party that was dealing with the evil spirit. In such cases, one must be patient.</p><p>Over on the other side, Ye Chen’s current situation didn’t look too good. The giant wolf evil spirit seemed like a never-tiring machine. The fight had already gone for four hours, but the evil spirit still looked completely fine whereas Ye Chen had begun to feel exhaustion. After all, he was a human and had a finite blood Qi and vitality.</p><p>Creak!</p><p>Ye Chen received a direct blow for the first time. As a result, the clothes covering his chest exploded and intense sparks flew off his pseudo supreme grade bronze armor. Spurting out a mouthful of blood, his figure flew off and his sword domain disappeared.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Operating his Immortal Body at full force, Ye Chen pushed his sword steps to the peak, evading the follow up strikes of the evil spirit.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Letting out a sinister roar, the giant wolf evil spirit leaned its forward and shot life-and-death Qi condensed into a light beam. The light beam shattered the space and instantly smashed into Ye Chen’s shoulder. With his body spinning, the latter was embedded deep into the ground.</p><p>Bang Bang Bang!</p><p>The giant wolf evil spirit would obviously not spare Ye Chen. The whole meaning of its existence was to kill people in Life and Death Mysterious Realm after all.</p><p>The ground shook and churned, turning into brown boiling expanse and shooting off ripples of flying earth and soil. If one went deep inside the expanse, they would see the ground dozens of li deep inside already turn into soil from pebbles and grit. Amidst such surroundings of incessant shaking and churning, even a third layer expert would be doomed.</p><p>Following its hundreds of crazed attacks, the giant wolf spirit faced the sky and roared. Rings of life-and-death condensed into light sphere at its mouth before it spouted it toward the center of the boiling expanse</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>A fountain of sand and gravel erupted, turning the sky overcast.</p><p>Standing in the void, the giant wolf evil spirit stopped its assault. It could feel that there were no longer any ripples of vital Qi coming from the ground; this troublesome human had finally died.</p><p>“Life and Death Reincarnation; life is not the beginning, and death is not the end.”</p><p>At that moment, the lifeless ground suddenly erupted with a powerful life force. The expanse of the ground that had been wrecked beyond recognition gave a hint of green that was intensifying at a rapid pace. Soon, hundreds of li around it swiftly grew into an oasis.</p><p>From the depression in the ground, Ye Chen charged out, his aura erupting forth. The current him was shockingly in the second layer of Life-and-Death Chamber. His life-and-death Qi indistinctly formed a simple ring, growing continuously. Raising his head, he looked at the giant wolf evil spirit, which was about to leave, with a strong battle intent.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>The evil spirit had no sentiments, so it didn’t know what was shock. Seeing Ye Chen not dead, it immediately charged over and continued its frenzied assault.</p><p>Neither retreating nor dodging, Ye Chen slashed with the Evil Vanquishing Sword. The tip of the sword swept across, leaving behind a long, slender crack in the space.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
