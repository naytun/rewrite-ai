However, he could fight evenly against Murong Qingcheng even when his strength was suppressed at the first layer, albeit without being able to get too close to her. But, now that he was fighting at full strength, Murong Qingcheng’s force field couldn’t influence him to that extent anymore.</p><p>“Not one of the ‘strongest’ half-step King can be looked down upon.”</p><p>It was not necessary to become a ‘strongest’ half-step King to attain the Life and Death realm. The majority of people skipped this step and directly reached the Life and Death realm from peak half-step King realm. However, through this course, their foundation would undoubtedly be lacking. After becoming a Life and Death King, their immortal body could only attain the realm of limb regeneration. However, if one became Life and Death King after attaining the ‘strongest’ half-step King realm, they could directly reach the second realm of immortal body and sharply increase one’s survivability.</p><p>The reason for these two choices was, in fact, related to one’s potential and foundation. As for whether there were other factors involved, nobody could tell for sure.</p><p>Therefore, in the True Spirit world, there were many who stopped at the peak half-step King realm, not able to budge forward. Then, through some fortuitous encounter, some were able to directly become Life and Death Kings. Meanwhile, there were others who, by relying on their potential and sturdy foundation, attained the ‘strongest’ half-step King realm, then advanced towards Life and Death realm step-by-step.</p><p>The reason for the former case’s overwhelming majority was because peak half-step Kings were many times greater in number compared to ‘strongest’ half-step Kings. Thus, the number of Life and Death warriors formed through this course was also higher.</p><p>Moreover, the latter might not necessarily become Life and Death Kings; but their chances were much higher, somewhere in between one in three and one in four.</p><p>Overall, among the of Life and Death Kings emerging within a century, ten percent came from ‘strongest’ half-step Kings while ninety percent directly jumped from peak half-step King realm. Thus, it could be even said that half-step King realm was a sort of dividing line of potential. Those who became ‘strongest’ half-step Kings had an extremely high potential, and after becoming Life and Death Kings, they would be much more powerful than ordinary Life and Death Kings. If one couldn’t become a ‘strongest’ half-step King, their potential would be considered as lower grade.</p><p>Being able to become a ‘strongest’ half-step King, Darklight King’s potential was certainly not weak. Of course, Ye Chen didn’t dare to be certain that the former had become a ‘strongest’ half-step King all on his own. After all, the True Spirit World had numerous exotic treasures that might increase one’s potential.</p><p>“Hehe, die! Darklight Palm Imprint.”</p><p>Revealing the strength of Life and Death chamber’s second layer, the Darklight King roared as he pressed his palm towards Murong Qingcheng. The huge imprint covered the sun, and its scorching currents were evaporating a large amount of ocean water.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>Not daring to contend against him head on, the wings behind Murong Qingcheng flapped and she disappeared. Relying on her innate speed superiority and Shadow Armor’s amplification, it was not certain if the Darklight King would prevail over her.</p><p>“Where will you run?” The Darklight King issued dozens of palm imprints in succession, unleashing a hurricane of scorching palm energies.</p><p>Swish Swish Swish!</p><p>Murong Qingcheng’s figure repeatedly flickered, dodging one imprint after another. Her extreme speed made every single one dumbstruck.</p><p>“Demonic Finger!” Soon, she suddenly issued a finger strike abruptly. Everybody could anticipate that Darklight King’s battle strength would drastically increase after using the Life and Death chamber’s second layer. A single palm of repelled the power of Demonic Finger.</p><p>The repelled power of Demonic Finger streaked over the ocean, creating a frightening scar on the water. In the end, dozens of li wide pit appeared in the ocean with a muffled explosion.</p><p>“Soul Extinguishing Wave!”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng felt her demonic power being on the verge of depleting. She could hardly use any more of her aces, and could only use normal attacks for the most part. She was helpless, as the Shadow Armor and Purple Flame Demonic Gloves used too much demonic power. If not for the fact that she only activated the artifacts while exchanging blows, her magic power would have been depleted long since.</p><p>Thus, issuing this Soul Extinguishing Wave almost depleted her demonic power completely.</p><p>The Soul Extinguishing Wave encompassed a vast area and was swift. Darklight King already knew that he would not be able to evade it. So, arousing his martial will, he erected a will barrier before him.</p><p>Creak Creak!</p><p>The will barrier resisted the soul attack and Zhen Yuan resisted the energy strike. As a result, the Darklight King was not injured in the slightest as opposed to the other time.</p><p>“Demonic Power Fist!” But, Murong Qingcheng’s speed multiplied suddenly and she appeared before him.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The Darklight King raised his Zhen Yuan to limits as a black light exploded forth from his body, making him look like a black sun surrounded by curling black flames that contained the power to burn the heaven and earth to a crisp. As soon as he was done, Murong Qingcheng’s strike arrived.</p><p>Her hands clenched into fists and the dark magic power currents around them turned increasingly dense, before she suddenly punched at Darklight King’s Protective Zhen Yuan.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>A tyrannical demonic power erupted from her fist while Darklight King’s figure shot back. However, right at that moment, he clenched his teeth and palmed on Murong Qingcheng’s Protective Zhen Yuan barrier. Unfortunately, he couldn’t put his full power behind this palm strike before his body was blasted back, creating a flickering black arc in the sky.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>Murong Qingcheng spurted out a huge mouthful of blood. Demonic Fist was the second demonic clan martial skill she had inherited, and it consumed even more demonic power compared to the Demonic Finger. It compressed large amounts of demonic power on the fist, increasing its destructive power by several folds. Unfortunately, she was already lacking demonic power. As soon as she used this art, her demonic power was completely depleted, causing the Shadow Armor to turn dark. Fortunately, Darklight King couldn’t put all his power in the palm. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have been as simple as merely coughing a mouthful of blood.</p><p>On the other hand, Darklight King was not feeling too good either as he didn’t have a pseudo supreme grade defensive artifact. He was relying on his Protective Zhen Yuan to resist Murong Qingcheng’s attacks. However, how could her fist imbued with demonic power be so easy to defend? Darklight King was injured for the very first time by the hands of Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>With a trail of blood at his mouth corner, Darklight King stood dozens of li away with his eyes turning crimson. He couldn’t seem to believe that he had been injured by Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>“What kind of martial skill is this? So powerful! It instantly increased the offensive power by several folds! Even the Darklight King in second layer has been injured!”</p><p>“It probably isn’t a profound martial skill…Might be some secret arts, right?”</p><p>“Definitely not a profound martial skill, and secret arts doesn’t seem likely either. If I’m not guessing wrong, this person has inherited demonic arts from the demonic human clan. They have all sorts of arts, and this art should be one that compresses demonic power to the extreme.”</p><p>Everybody was astonished. Even if Darklight King didn’t have a pseudo supreme grade defensive artifact, he still had a semi-supreme grade one. Adding his own body’s defense, one could imagine how strong his defense was. However, he was still injured by Murong Qingcheng!</p><p>Her demonic power was simply too perverse!</p><p>“Murong, let me take from here!”</p><p>Ye Chen was extremely approving of Murong Qingcheng facing a ‘strongest half-step King by herself. After all, it was not so easy to encounter one. This confrontation allowed them to get a feel of a ‘strongest’ half-step Kings’ strength. It could be seen that Murong Qingcheng could somewhat stand her own against a veteran ‘strongest’ half-step King. However, as of now, she was slightly injured and had consumed all her demonic power. Thus, Ye Chen would naturally take over from her.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng faintly nodded and retreated back to his side.</p><p>“What’s going on? Giving up?”</p><p>“What else can she do? Don’t you see that she has already expended her demonic power? Without her demonic power, anybody would be able to kill her.”</p><p>“Right. Demonic Power is different from Zhen Yuan, as there are no pills to recover it. This is a huge shortcoming of being a perfect vessel demonic human.”</p><p>Seeing Murong Qingcheng retreat, everybody sighed inwardly. Darklight King was Darklight King; even after expending all her methods, Murong Qingcheng was only able to stand for a short while. Who would resist Darklight King now? The kid didn’t seem like someone who would be able to do much.</p><p>Darklight King had only suffered a slight injury, and was basically in perfect shape. He flew across and said grimly, “Not bad! You actually managed to injure me. A pity that you’re a bit lacking in endurance. It was merely a warm up for me.”</p><p>“Then the real show begins now!” Stepping into the void, Ye Chen strode forth step-by-step, stopping ten li away from Darklight King.</p><p>“Real show? Just you?” Darklight King heartily laughed as if he had heard the greatest joke of his life.</p><p>“Impossible! Could it be that his strength is stronger than the woman’s? His cultivation base is only at mid half-step King realm. It’s too low!”</p><p>“He probably thinks the Darklight King must have expended a lot of Zhen Yuan, and also suffered some injury.”</p><p>“Nonsense! This bit of injury is nothing for the Darklight King. And, although this kid’s cultivation is more or less the same as that woman’s, one has Zhen Yuan and other demonic power. The two simply have no comparison. Moreover, demonic arts are much more powerful than martial arts. If his profound arts can get close to the woman, it would be considered pretty good. Perhaps his sword arts are extraordinary. However, unless there is a vast difference in wills, it won’t have too big of an effect.”</p><p>Everybody’s mouth were opened wide, being unable to comprehend why Ye Chen would step out.</p><p>“Sister-in-law!”</p><p>Yue Bingxin had also turned a little anxious. Darklight King was so powerful that Murong Qingcheng was not able to do anything to him even after she expended all her means. Instead, she ended up consuming all her demonic power. Clearly, Ye Chen was in danger.</p><p>“Let’s watch first.” Yue Lingshuang’s expression turned grave. As soon as Ye Chen turned out not to be an opponent of Darklight King, she would act to save him from danger. Thus, her timing must be impeccable. She couldn’t afford the slightest bit of delay.</p><p>Amongst everybody, only Huang Mei had full confidence in Ye Chen.</p><p>Stopping his laugher, Darklight King licked his lips, “Don’t think I’ve been through a tough battle just now. My blood has just started to boil. I really hope you can take at least one move from me. If you can’t, well…you’ll die.”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>An extremely wild energy erupted as Darklight King shot toward Ye Chen and issued a palm strike.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Unsheathing the Evil Vanquishing Sword in an instant, Ye Chen leaned forward…swish…and struck with an impeccable timing. As Darklight King’s body swept past, a black-colored crescent moon shaped sword energy formed and brushed past his body.</p><p>Right at that moment, an astonishing scene occurred. In a single exchange, Darklight King’s entire being was flung out. The clothes on his chest were slashed, revealing a distinct sword scar on his semi supreme grade armor. His mouth was spurting large mouthfuls of blood, and his eyes were on the verge of popping out.</p><p>A single sword strike had sent the Darklight King flying.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
