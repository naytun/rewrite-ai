His sword speed increased gradually along with his power, as if that narrow pitch-black gap was accelerating the Evil Shattering sword.</p><p>Pap!</p><p>The massive wolf’s right claw and the evil shattering sword clashed together but did not make a loud noise, sounding rather like a glass bottle being shattered within a second. Of course, it would not be an actual glass bottle being broken, but the space itself. The massive wolf evil spirit and Ye Chen both had the ability to shatter space. So, when their power clashed together, it was almost equivalent to a normal life and death realm warrior’s full power attack.</p><p>For the first time, the massive wolf had been blown away; of course, Ye Chen had also backed out for hundreds of steps as well.</p><p>“Right now, my attacking power is similar to its, but its battling techniques are nowhere near mine.” A smile appeared on his face as Ye Chen’s body flashed once and he traveled toward the massive wolf evil spirit with a speed that exceeded everything. Wherever he went, the space started to distort into patterns.</p><p>The spirit did not have a mind of its own, so it would not be able to know what emotions were. Seeing Ye Chen coming its way, it suddenly rebalanced its body before welcoming the attack.</p><p>“Spirit Sword Attack!”</p><p>When the gap between the two was less than one hundred meters, Ye Chen suddenly stabbed out immediately and shook his wrist right afterward.</p><p>Pooh! Pooh! Pooh!</p><p>The section of space stabbed developed countless tiny cracks. The spirit had not managed to get close before it got stabbed through hundreds of times. However, such an evil spirit would not be destroyed this easily. These wounds might seem intense, but it would be hard to destroy it completely.</p><p>Its massive mouth opened and the spirit shot out a light ball containing the qi of life and death. The light ball punctured through the surreal space before reappearing right in front of Ye Chen’s body.</p><p>“Waning Moon!”</p><p>Ye Chen floated backward while his evil shattering sword swung in the air, cutting the light ball in half. That powerful sword force had also punctured through the space.</p><p>The spirit could sense Ye Chen’s power change, so its massive mouth suddenly opened and closed. With that, a tremendous amount of life and death qi formed into light balls and shot out toward Ye Chen.</p><p>Facing these many light balls, Ye Chen did not dare to be reckless. He released his sword domain, and the space seemed to have become tougher with its coverage. As the light ball punctured through the space, its power was decreased a couple of times before being shattered one by one by Ye Chen.</p><p>As he slashed the light balls, Ye Chen quickly approached the evil spirit that was trying to absorb all of the life and death qi in the air. Next, he threw out a sword attack, which was indeed the Bewitching Mirror Flower Attack.</p><p>The massive wolf evil spirit was locked in a special space before it was shattered along with its body into hundreds of thousands of pieces, looking like a broken mirror. The Bewitching Mirror Flower Attack was already horrifyingly powerful before Ye Chen had reached the level where he could tear apart space, containing the killing power of shattering space. And right now, Ye Chen’s cultivation had reached the second level of life and death challenge, so his attack’s power had increased again, and it took him only one sword attack to kill the evil spirit.</p><p>Once it was shattered, the life and death tag within its body floated out, carrying a special kind of vibration.</p><p>“Finally, it is dead!”</p><p>Ye Chen let out a breath. If the evil was still not “dead”, then he would have to take out the Sky Scorpio Sword to kill it, since he could not improve his cultivation further within a short period of time, and the evil spirit would only get more and more powerful as time went on.</p><p>As he waved his hand once, the tag landed in his hand. Studying it carefully, Ye Chen then put it back into his storage ring.</p><p>“The first life and death stone helped me reach the first realm of life and death challenge. Although the second life and death stone did not help me continue breaking through, I still managed to break through under pressure. Adding this life and death stone, I just need three more stones before I can reach the third level of life and death challenge.”</p><p>After getting out of the secret realm, there would be bigger problems waiting for Ye Chen. He knew he could not relax yet, and that he could have to find three more stones in the remaining time he had.</p><p>“Let the hunt continue. There seems to be limited life and death evil spirits within the core areas. After killing the majority of them, I will have to go to the life and death palace to try my luck, I guess.”</p><p>His body flashed once before disappearing completely from where he was standing.</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the Blood Heaven Land, in the Wolf Meadow inside the White Wolf Martial School…</p><p>The White Wolf Martial School as one of the top ten martial institutions covered a huge area of land. In the outer area of the school were mostly werewolves, the weakest ones still at rank 5. Although they had still not been able to turn into human forms, they could all walk upright. Although there were werewolves in the inner areas as well, they were mostly in human forms, and their cultivation would naturally not be low.</p><p>“Eh? How come Wolf Warrior is back? The life and death secret realm should still be open, right?”</p><p>“Something is not right. Perhaps Wolf Warrior was killed inside the realm?”</p><p>“Possible.”</p><p>The wolf beasts discussed amongst themselves.</p><p>“Wolfie, what happened?” An elder with a head of white hair walked out of the palace, his eyes fixed right onto Wolf Warrior.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>Wolf Warrior turned into a beam of light and landed right in front of him. “Great Master, I was killed!” He was full of shame, with an uncontrollable anger and frustration mixed within as well. “It was a human from Blood Heaven Land.”</p><p>“What? The human warriors from the Blood Heaven Land who could kill you would only be the four demi demons. Ling Huyi should not be your opponent, the immortal demon warrior and Tie Kuangzun and Demon Woman Blade…don’t they know the rules of this land?”</p><p>Wolf Warrior shook his head. “It was not one of them. It was a human whom I had never met before. He seemed to have something to do with the Demon Woman Blade Lan Shanmei. He wore blue robes and carried a sword, seeming little over twenty years old.”</p><p>“No matter who he is, I will bury him with my bare hands. If he belongs to a martial institution inside Blood Heaven Land, I will destroy his school as well.” The elder spoke with a scary tone.</p><p>…</p><p>Tiger Roar Mountains, Heaven Tiger Beast Martial School, inside the palace…</p><p>“It was not one of the four demi demon warriors? It was a human sword artist? And he had something to do with the daughter of Demon Blade Martial School Lan Shanmei? Damn it!” The leader of the Heaven Tiger Beast Martial School happened to be at the school. He was shocked upon seeing the Tiger Warrior come back suddenly. And after asking him, he learned that his disciple had been killed by a human martial genius, making him uncontrollably angry.</p><p>“You go close up for now. Don’t dare to come out until you reach the third life and death challenge stage. This is your punishment.” The leader said coldly to Tiger Warrior.</p><p>“Yes, sir!”</p><p>He also knew that the reason that he was beaten was that he was not strong enough, so he accepted the punishment. But, he was still hating Ye Chen inside his mind, since he had more than enough of a chance to find enough of life and death stones and smoothly reach the third stage if it were not for him.</p><p>…</p><p>Inside a deep valley in the core area, Feng Piaoling had just killed a rather powerful high rank evil spirit. He was very lucky, as this high rank evil spirit had a life and death stone within.</p><p>“By the looks of it, I still seem to have the hope of reaching the third level.” Feng Piaoling said while fusing the life and death stone within. Just as he was about to leave, his body froze immediately as a young man in green robes appeared out of nowhere. Although the young man did not have a sword, that aggressive sword intent had locked onto Feng Piaoling. It seemed that as long as his body moved once, the strings would be pulled and the young man in green would throw out an attack immediately.</p><p>“Sword Realm Artist, it is you after all.” Feng Piaoling had an embarrassed expression on his face.</p><p>As one of the top ten sword artists of the Heaven Sword Land, Feng Piaoling had seen Sword Realm Artist’s power during the last life and death secret realm. In other words, besides Luo Tiandu from True Spirit Continent, no one would be his rightful opponent. And he knew for sure he would not be one of them.</p><p>“Should I attack or will you just do it yourself?” Sword Realm Artist asked lightly.</p><p>“Although I am not your rightful opponent, it would be impossible if you want me to exit the place myself.” The embarrassed expression on Feng Piaoling’s face disappeared as he said with a low voice.</p><p>“Very good! It seems like you are not that weak after all.” Sword Realm Artist waved his hand once and a top rank great sword appeared in front of him.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>Without a thought, Feng Piaoling turned around to run. He knew that there would have no chance of surviving if he tried to fight against the Sword Realm Artist. Running away would still afford him a chance.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>Feng Piaoling was specialized in the profound of wind, and his speed was so fast that he managed to fly hundreds of miles away with only a flash, his body turning into a wave of wind.</p><p>“Do you think you can get away from this?”</p><p>Sword Realm Artist looked up and reached out his two fingers from his right hand before pointing out toward Feng Piaoling in the distance.</p><p>Pooh! Pooh! Pooh! Pooh!</p><p>Top rank great swords were shot out at a lightning like speed. Midway, they formed into a sword pattern with one sword being in front and three in the back. Around the sword was a blue tornado, and it was indeed this tornado that increased the speed.</p><p>The Wind sword spell!</p><p>Pooh!</p><p>Feng Piapling was very fast, but the Wind Sword Spell was even faster. The sword spell flashed once, and the back and chest of Feng Piaoling had a massive hole appearing in the next moment. Soon, his body was gradually disappearing.</p><p>“He can even puncture though the half extreme shield! Sword Realm Artist, you are indeed powerful like your reputation! Alright, after getting back to the True Spirit continent, I will do Ye Chen a favor then.”</p><p>Forcing a chuckle, Feng Piaoling’s body disappeared, leaving a life and death stone in the air.</p><p>Sword Realm Artist flew over slowly and made a grabbing gesture with his hand, the stone soon fusing into his body. “True spirit continent has indeed fallen. I wonder Luo Tiandu, what kind of power do you have now?”</p><p>“It is Feng Piaoling!”</p><p>From afar, Ye Chen could see that Feng Piaoling had been punctured through and disappeared completely. Soon, a young man in green robes appeared there.</p><p>“He used the Defensive Sword Spell to drive the sword forward! Huh!” Ye Chen moved over quickly.</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>Sword Realm Artist turned around his head and looked over at Ye Chen with a weird expression, since when people witnessed his power, they would normally run as fast as possible. But strangely, Ye Chen moved over actively with a hint of killing intent.</p><p>“Second level Life and Death Challenge…Not a low cultivation, but unfortunately too silly…” Sword Realm Artist turned around his body and looked at Ye Chen with a cold expression. “What is your name? I don’t kill people without a name.”</p><p>Ye Chen said, “You should be Jian Houzhen from the Heaven Sword Land, right?” He had heard Feng Piaoling mention the top ten sword artists inside Heaven Sword Land.</p><p>“It seems like you have heard about me.” Sword Realm Artist flicked his eyebrows.</p><p>“Indeed! I am Ye Chen, the man who’s going to kill you.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
