Going by her demonic power cultivation base, she could activate the armor for twenty five minutes. In this duration, even the ‘strongest’ half-step Kings wouldn’t be able to do anything to her.</p><p>However, defense and staying alive was merely a last resort. To truly increase one’s strength, one still needed a good offensive artifact.</p><p>As their guide, Wang Lan pitched some ideas as well.</p><p>“Gemstone Islands hold a grand auction every year. The site of the auction is the Golden Island situated in the dead center of the islands. Not one of the artifacts capable of appearing in the auction is anything but premium goods. Although I haven’t visited it personally, I’ve heard that the lowest level is peak upper grade while half supreme grade artifacts are too many too count. Moreover, the auction’s grand reveal is enough to make half-step Kings go crazy…Even Life and Death Kings join the bidding war occasionally.”</p><p>“When is the auction?” Ye Chen was moved and asked.</p><p>Wang Lan replied, “Roughly a month. In this time, you should prepare well in terms of spirit stones.”</p><p>“A month…that’s fortunate.”</p><p>Ye Chen faintly nodded. They didn’t lack spirit stones at all. Although Murong Qingcheng had just spent thirty four million upper grade spirit stones, she still had seventy million left. As for Ye Chen, after obtaining Lin Yuxuan’s spirit ring, his upper grade spirit stones had reached a staggering number a hundred and eighty million. If not for Mysterious Yin Pagoda Master being too powerful, not allowing him to pick the storage rings of others, his spirit stones would number in several hundred million.</p><p>The more powerful a martial artist became, the less they would feel the passage of time. A month could be a long time for a mortal, allowing one to accomplish many things. One might become rich overnight or go bankrupt.</p><p>During this month, aside from increasing his cultivation base, he focused on the Waning Moon and Bewitching Mirror Destruction. Of course, the basics of space profound still held the topmost priority.</p><p>Waning Moon was a fusion profound martial skill, containing eighty percent completed gold profound and sixty percent completed water profound. Although it had been currently taken over by Bewitching Mirror Destruction, it still had a lot of potential. Moreover, Bewitching Mirror Destruction cost a lot of Zhen Yuan, and Waning Moon was a lot better in this respect.</p><p>To improve metal profound and water profound was naturally an extremely arduous task. After all, one could only have the state of being one with the world at the time of breakthrough. Although going from peak Sea of Soul realm to half-step King realm was called a breakthrough, it was merely a transition in reality.</p><p>Thus, being unable to increase profound in the short term, Ye Chen was not obstinate, and instead focused on the fusion of metal profound and water profound. He wasted no time during the month. Along with the improvement in fusion, the strength of Waning Moon increased at a rapid pace.</p><p>Bewitching Mirror Destruction contained the space profound. The amplification of pure might provided by forty percent space profound was equal to a hundred and twenty percent of ordinary profound, a lot stronger than the completion of ordinary profounds. This was Ye Chen’s ace, a killer move that he would not reveal easily.</p><p>Under the pressure of Demonic Kings, Ye Chen felt an urgency to cultivate Bewitching Mirror Destruction to completion. Although he would still be killed by a King even if he accomplished it, a glimmer of hope was still better than nothing.</p><p>Spurt!</p><p>A sword flashed, and the rockery in the courtyard twisted and layered, then suddenly disappeared. In the courtyard, Wang Lan was deeply stunned. To completely destroy rockery was nothing special. She could do it, and a Condensing Yuan martial artist could also do it. However, to accomplish it in this manner, vanishing the entire rockery without giving off a trace of energy, she had never seen it before.</p><p>Of course, the rockery had not truly disappeared, but devoured by the spatial power. To vanish a weak object like the rockery, the course of events could be directly omitted</p><p>Another half a month passed by, and the auction was about to begin. On this day, the three individuals headed to the Golden Island, with Wang Lan in the lead.</p><p>The Golden Island was vast, yet already packed with people. Under the illumination of the sunlight, it glowed with a dim golden color. As for the people on the island, they were either Sea of Soul realm experts or half-step Kings. There was not a single person under Sea of Soul realm.</p><p>Wang Lan said, “I cannot enter the island. Rest is up to you.”</p><p>“You can return to the island first. Perhaps we’ll you need you more.” Wang Lan was, after all, a person raised and born on Gemstones Island. Her advice before leaving the island might save them a lot of time.</p><p>Reaching the island, the two headed toward the single enormous building complex on the island.</p><p>The site of the Golden Island Auction was made precisely with gold. The dazzling golden glow under the sunlight made it a hundred folds more majestic than any building in Ye Chen’s original world. If it were to be transported there, it would become the greatest wonder of the world without a doubt.</p><p>Swish Swish Swish!</p><p>The island was already packed enough, but people still descended one after another. There was no lack of half-step Kings with imposing auras.</p><p>“Let’s go.”</p><p>The two strode toward the auction site’s entrance.</p><p>The auction had no VIP seats, and the front rows were crammed with spectators. Meanwhile, the back seats were spacious and separated by golden barriers. They had a table surrounded by a few soft-cushioned seats, and a beautiful maid standing beside.</p><p>Ye Chen would naturally not squeeze in the crowd, so he sat together with Murong Qingcheng in the back. In fact, the place chosen by him was intended specifically for half-step Kings.</p><p>As they settled down, the maid served hot tea on the table that already had exotic-looking fruits and cakes.</p><p>“So many people!” Leaning back in his chair, Ye Chen slowly sipped his tea.</p><p>“Darklight King is also here.” Murong Qingcheng glanced at the person in question three seats away.</p><p>The latter had also spotted the two. His eyes brimmed with unhidden killing intent, causing the nearby people to stand up and leave, not daring to sit too close to him.</p><p>Ye Chen faintly smiled, not sparing a glance in his direction.</p><p>As time passed, the spectators section’s seats were completely filled, and the seats in the back section were also occupied by more than half. There were many half-step Kings among them worthy of paying attention to. For example, at some point, Shi Shaobao, the raincoat wearing old man, and Huang Mei had also arrived.</p><p>In addition, there were a few more that aroused Ye Chen’s interest; for example, the two women in white robes. One was slightly older, looking in her thirties, and had a dignified face. Meanwhile, the other looked around twenty years old, with delicate features. She was, in fact, Yue Bingxin of Silvermoon Whitefox Clan.</p><p>Yue Bingxin sensed Ye Chen’s gaze and turned around. Seeing him and Murong Qingcheng sitting two seats back, her expression turned that of a pleasant surprise.</p><p>“Young Master Ye, didn’t expect to see you here!” Yue Bingxin spoke.</p><p>Ye Chen said, “What a surprise indeed! Seems like your clan’s Moonlight Island is not too far away from here.”</p><p>“Right, it’s not far.”</p><p>“Bingxin, who are you talking to?”</p><p>The face of the dignified woman beside Yue Bingxin turned strange as she saw the latter speaking to someone two seats away.</p><p>“Sister-in-law, he is the young master Ye Chen I told you about, the one who killed the gang of demonic human experts and saved my life.”</p><p>“Oh, it’s him! Then thank them properly.”</p><p>The dignified woman revealed a faint smile toward Ye Chen, her eyes carrying a trace of gratitude. If not for Ye Chen, Yue Bingxin would have been captured and taken back to the Demonic Human Clan. With Silvermoon Whitefox Clan, it would have been impossible for them to rescue her.</p><p>“Hello, I’m Yue Bingxin’s sister-in-law, Yue Lingshuang. Many thanks for saving Yue Bingxin! If there’s anything we can do, please speak without hesitation.”</p><p>Ye Chen replied, “It was not worth much effort, please be at ease.”</p><p>After a few pleasantries, the sides went back to their own business. However, at some point, Bing Lingshuang noticed Darklight King staring at Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng with unbridled killing intent every once in a while. She frowned, “Bingxin, I’m afraid your benefactor’s situation doesn’t look good. I see Darklight King and them having a major conflict. He seems as if can’t wait to head to their seats.”</p><p>“How can this be?” Yue Bingxin hadn’t paid attention to Darklight King, so she immediately turned anxious. She had heard of his fame. He rarely had rivals under the Life and Death realm. Having offended him, Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng were headed for doom. It would be hard for them to leave Gemstone Islands alive.</p><p>“Sister-in-law, you have to help them!” Yue Bingxin pulled at Yue Lingshuang’s sleeves.</p><p>“You don’t need to say it. I will not sit by and watch them lose their lives. However, I have no certainty of repelling Darklight King given his strength, neither can I protect them everywhere they go. They will have to follow use back to Moonlight Island and stay there for a period of time. He won’t dare to cause trouble at Moonlight Island. Once he leaves, they can silently leave.”</p><p>Yue Lingshuang was a genius of the millennium on Moonlight Island. Since she dared to talk about protecting Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng, she was obviously a ‘strongest’ half-step King herself.</p><p>Hearing her words, Yue Bingxin let out a sigh of relief and decided to immediately take Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng back to Moonlight Island.</p><p>Around ten minutes passed by, and there was almost no space in the auction site. Soon, the auction master arrived on the stage and spoke a few words. With a wave of his hands, two beautiful maids, holding a disc each, walked to the stage, beginning the auction.</p><p>As Wang Lan said, even the lowest tier treasures were peak upper grade. The first item was a dagger, gleaming with a cold light. It was crimson in color, as if soaked in blood. It’s starting price was a hundred and fifty thousand upper grade spirit stones.</p><p>After a round of bidding, it was sold at a price of three hundred and fifty thousand upper grade spirit stones.</p><p>After a couple dozen items were auctioned, the auction entered the late phase. All the following items were either semi-supreme grade artifacts, rare spirit herbs, or unique materials that were unheard of.</p><p>“Thirty seventh item is a Heart Protecting Flower.” On the stage, the host spoke passionately.</p><p>“Heart Protecting Flower!”</p><p>Ye Chen smiled bitterly. Before breaking through half-step King realm, he had always been desirous of the Heart Protecting Flower, but never succeeded. Who would have expected that he would see one after becoming a half-step King! It seemed like a cruel joke, and he could only smile bitterly.</p><p>Of course, even though he no longer had any use for it, it didn’t mean that others didn’t. So, he decided to bid for it for Ye family.</p><p>However, Ye Chen underestimated the demand for the Heart Protecting Flower. Those Sea of Soul realm experts could be directly ignored. The half-step Kings in the back alone increased the bid one after another without batting an eye. Many among them had sects behind them, and they would be compensated a lot more than they would be spending for the flower.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
