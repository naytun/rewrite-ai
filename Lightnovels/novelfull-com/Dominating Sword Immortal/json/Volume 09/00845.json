This gap could not be ignored. Fighting against the demi demon king would not be possible, and even fighting the weakest true life and death king warrior might not have a promising prognosis. But, at least he had a fighting chance now.</p><p>“At the early stages of half step king warriors, the Zhen yuan will have to be infused with the blood in the artery and formed into a loop. At the mid rank level, the Zhen yuan would be infused with the rest of the veins. Once one reaches the high rank level, the Zhen yuan would be infused into the micro veins. As for life and death challenge stages, the Zhen yuan would be slowly infused into the blood and flesh of the body.”</p><p>Learning the meaning of life and death would be a way to elevate one’s mind, which would ultimately improve the cultivation in a highly efficient manner. It would increase the body’s control as well, reaching a level where one could look into one’s internal world. It was also why the cultivation could improve drastically like the head disciple of Zhang Tian Disciple—Gao Zhiyuan—had done.</p><p>After three days, Ye Chen finally managed to stabilize his cultivation and continued to go into the deeper areas of the realm.</p><p>Perhaps it was because the life and death bridge was just in front or perhaps something else, Ye Chen ran into many young martial geniuses. Some of them were beasts and some were humans, but there were rarely any demi demons.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>After flying for a while, an explosive sound was heard from ahead while an intense qi flow spread out into different directions. Some of plants had been uprooted from the ground itself.</p><p>“People are fighting! Let’s go check it out!”</p><p>The young martial geniuses who had come to the life and death secret realm did not come just for the stones, but also to witness the top battles between powerful warriors. An epic battle would allow them to learn things, so their eyes brightened and they unconsciously increased their speed as they flew over.</p><p>‘The battle inside the inner areas seemed to be way more intense than the outer areas.’ Ye Chen thought to himself.</p><p>After thousands of miles, Ye Chen finally arrived at the battling ground.</p><p>“This many people?” Scanning around him, Ye Chen was a bit surprised.</p><p>On top of that endless mountain groups, two groups of people were in a standoff. A group of people led by the Tiger Warrior and a young man with a hooked nose was standing in front of another group led by a long haired young man and a woman with brown hair. The former was representing the Blood Heaven Land while the latter represented True Spirit Continent, since Ye Chen saw Beiming Hui, Situ Hao, and a couple of more familiar faces on the other team.</p><p>“The martial geniuses from True Spirit Continent are just so so!”</p><p>Ye Chen’s arrival did not attract too much attention since the majority of attention was fixed on the two groups who were battling. The powerful teenager who had the horns on his head shook his long spear and the spear light exploded, turning into a massive snake head biting aggressively toward the short, skinny teenager.</p><p>Pooh!</p><p>The young man’s protective Zhen yuan layer was breached through and he was blown backwards into the air with blood streaming out his mouth.</p><p>“Haha!” After beating his opponent, the bulky looking young man roared with laughter. “The martial geniuses from True Spirit Continent are too weak! They have lost two rounds! It seems like True Spirit Continent only has its title, and they are now owned by the Blood Heaven Land!”</p><p>“Yeah, you are right! There might be a lot of martial geniuses in True Spirit Continent, but rarely any elites. We have the eight beast warriors and four demon warriors, who are the top of the top.”</p><p>Over at Blood Heaven Land’s side, the aura seemed to be growing as their discussions got louder and louder. They did not think the martial geniuses from True Spirit Continent were worthy for them to care.</p><p>“Frogs at the bottom of the well.” Beiming Hui stood out.</p><p>“Who do you think you are addressing with that kind of talk?” The powerful teenager pointed out his long spear at Beiming Hui.</p><p>Beiming Hui sneered. “I was addressing you lot. Don’t think that one or two warriors from True Spirit Continent can represent the whole of us, and that you all are so much more powerful. I will let you in on the truth. If you run into our real geniuses, you will be truly shocked.”</p><p>“He! You are joking, right?” The bulky looking young man did not believe him at all.</p><p>“Cut the crap! You use a spear and I also use one. Just watch how I beat you.” A silver long spear appeared in the hand of Beiming Hui’s, its body seeming shiny and reflective.</p><p>“Bring it on! I will make you believe.” The young man looked rather serious as he could sense that Beiming Hui’s spear power was very intense, and that he was a real spear artist.</p><p>“Sky Bank Third Movement, Sky Bank Eternity!”</p><p>Beiming Hui performed his killing attack right at the beginning. His body turned into two, and then both of them performed his attack at the same time. Although it was just one movement, its qi was completely different. One of them was obvious while the other was hidden. The two fused together and the entire environment started to change. The sharp spear light expanded endlessly, growing hundreds of thousands of times longer within a second as the spear intent locked onto the young man.</p><p>“Not good! This attack is actually very powerful!”</p><p>The bulky looking young man waved his long spear and generated a massive whirl, preparing to devour that incoming spear light.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The whirl was broken, and the spear light was shattered. However, Beiming Hui’s attack was not finished.</p><p>“Fourth Attack, Ten Square Invincible.”</p><p>If the third movement of that attack was an attack that combined the first movement, then the forth movement would be related to the second movement, more than twice as strong as before. A couple of years ago, Beiming Hui had created the third movement before creating some other attacks, while the fourth movement was created not that long ago.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>The bulky young man blocked the seven silver light beams but the last three beams landed directly on his abdomen and chest, blowing him into the air.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>After finally gaining some advantages, the young warriors on True Spirit Continent’s side cheered.</p><p>“This Beiming Hui is indeed powerful! He has just reached the first life and death challenge level, but has the power of martial geniuses at a similar level.” The young man with long hair said to the woman with brown hair.</p><p>“Yeah! On our land, besides Dugu Jue, Dantai Mingyue, Chu Zhongtian and Yan Fengfeng, Beiming Hui would be the one with the highest potential.” The woman with brown hair nodded.</p><p>“You have even created a fourth movement I see!” Ye Chen chuckled. The martial art movements would get harder and harder with the increase in power. He remembered that when the other was challenging him before, he had only created the first movement, then the second and third, and now even the fourth. It was indeed a fast speed.</p><p>“Who else wants to learn a lesson?” Beiming Hui said with a loud voice.</p><p>“I will.” Over on the other side, they did not seem to be happy with the loss, so a young man stood out. However, this young man was blown away while puking blood after three movements as well.</p><p>Beiming Hui’s power was famous in the True Spirit continent. Even Dugu Jue and the rest of the powerful warriors would not have the confidence in beating him. And today, he finally had a chance to compete with some other top warriors, and he still seemed really powerful.</p><p>“It is a tie now! Two on our side and two on yours!”</p><p>“If Beiming Hui can win another round, then we will be in the win.”</p><p>“I wonder who is going to challenge him!”</p><p>All of the warriors on True Spirit Continent side discussed.</p><p>“Never mind! In case I have to come out to deal with this later, I might as well take care of all of you.”</p><p>A warrior with vague tiger patten on his forehead and arms stood out, and a natural tiger roar spread out in the area. Everyone seemed to have heard an air slicing sound, and some of the weaker warriors could not even control their own body.</p><p>Inside True Spirit continent was the Heaven Tiger family, who had the Heaven Tiger beast as their ancestor. But the Heaven Tiger bloodline in this person’s body was richer than the a demi beast Heaven Tiger, so it would not be unfair for people to call him a Heaven Tiger. After all, his bloodline was almost identical to his ancestors.</p><p>“Such a powerful beast bloodline!”</p><p>Beiming Hui squinted his eyes and his head went numb. Over at True Spirit continent, although Yan Fengfeng’s comprehensive ability was not that high, Dugu Jue could still never beat her. But, this tiger warrior was not only a purer beast, his cultivation had even reached peak level second life and death challenging level.</p><p>“Tiger warrior is bullying that warrior!” The young man with a hooked nose had a big smile on his face.</p><p>“Are you ready?” Tiger Warrior looked at Beiming Hui with a mischievous expression.</p><p>“Bring it on!”</p><p>Beiming Hui’s body separated into half—one being right and one being left, standing right next to each other.</p><p>“Then die!”</p><p>Tiger Warrior’s body flashed once turned into an aggressive tiger. As his body rose in the air, he reached out his right hand and tore apart the space in front of him.</p><p>“So fast!”</p><p>Beiming Hui felt a sudden blur in front of his eyes before Tiger Warrior was already in front of him. He did not have the time to react, so two Beiming Hui performed the second movement of his Sky Bank to attack tiger warrior together.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Tiger Warrior waved his hand and dozens of silver light attacked over. Soon, a tail grew out of his butt which whipped at one of the Beiming Hui and shattered his body into nothingness.</p><p>It was a body separation that he had just been destroyed, so Beiming Hui’s real body backed out immediately. Meanwhile, his left hand formed a spell and a blue cage appeared from the sky, trapping Tiger warrior within.</p><p>Tiger warrior show a sarcastic expression. “You really think you can trap me?”</p><p>“Naturally not. But, I need a little bit of time.”</p><p>Beiming Hui did not have the time to perform his fourth attack, but with the help of his cage, he successfully performed the fourth movement. Ten beams of silver light shot out and attacked toward Tiger warrior at the same time.</p><p>“Heaven Tiger Roar!”</p><p>Facing Beiming Hui’s killing attack, Tiger warrior seemed quite relaxed before he suddenly opened his mouth. As the roar was heard, time seemed to have frozen while the whole space vibrated.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The cage was shattered while the ten beams of silver light had been tilted in their route by a wave of invisible power, which did not manage to wound Tiger warrior. However, a hint of blood was seen at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>“It contains a mental attack!” Beiming Hui was shocked!</p><p>The secret arts containing mental power were not that rare, but still barely seen. However, the Heaven Tiger roar was actually not a secret art, but rather a natural talent. A secret art would need learning, but natural talent could only be mastered as time passed.</p><p>Chin!</p><p>Tiger Warrior’s body flashed once and then he threw out a claw attack toward Beiming Hui. The latter had quick reflexes still, and he managed to block his long spear in front of his chest. However the blasting power of the claw continued to take effect and passed onto his body, which was then blown into the air. Blood poured out of his mouth. Interestingly, he happened to land right next to Ye Chen.</p><p>“Ye Chen!”</p><p>“Ye Chen? Who is Ye Chen?”</p><p>Almost everyone from Blood Heaven land had not heard about Ye Chen. But, a lot of people from True Spirit continent changed their expression. No one in that group had not heard about that name. Before Ye Chen had left, Dugu Jue had been kept down for all these years. Even Liu Wujian, Jiang Tian, and Chu Zhongtian had lost to him before, or they simply did not dare to fight him in the first place.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
