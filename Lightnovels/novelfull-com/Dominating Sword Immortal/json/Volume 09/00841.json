In fact, it would still be considered their youth. If they managed to become a Life and Death King, fifty years wouldn’t amount to anything.</p><p>“The Life and Death stones in Life and Death Secret Realm can let one comprehend life and death, improving one’s state of mind. However, due to their scarcity, half of the people are bound not to get even a single one. Senior Brother Luo, you’re at the peak of third layer of Life and Death Chamber. As long as you can get your hands on a few Life and Death Stones, you might even break through and become and a King inside the secret realm.” Among the seven individuals, a light brown-haired young woman spoke.</p><p>“How can it be so easy to attain Life and Death realm?” Luo Tian bitterly smiled. Attaining the first layer of Life and Death chamber from late half-step King realm was not that difficult with Life and Death stones; one stone was enough to ensure ninety percent chances of success. However, to attain the second layer from the first, even two stones would not guarantee ninety percent chance. As for the third layer, at least four stones were required. But for reaching Life and Death realm, merely Life and Death stones would not suffice. One needed a bit of opportunity and luck as well.</p><p>Moreover, these stones were not easy to obtain. Every time, more than half of the people entering the realm would return empty-handed. And among those who obtained them, the majority would only get one. Only a few would get their hands on two. But, the latter would be able to increase their strength and state of mind sharply.</p><p>The seven were extremely quick. The others only felt a blur pass them as seven more figures had already arrived beside the bronze gate.</p><p>“Bai Wuxue, Lu Shaoyou, you four have been contending for more than ten years already. That’s something truly rare!” Luo Tian swept his gaze through Bai Wuxue’s group and smiled.</p><p>“Perhaps it’s destined to be.” The long-haired young man beside Luo Tian followed up with a smile.</p><p>Bai Wuxue, Lu Shaoyou, Xia Houzun, and Xiao Chuhe had stood shoulder-to-shoulder since childhood. After a dozen years, although these four were no longer the sun in the sky, being surpassed by Ye Chen, Du Gujue, and Tantai Mingyue—the three monstrosities—the competition between them had yet to conclude.</p><p>“To have rivals is not a bad thing. Isn’t that so, senior brother Luo?” One didn’t necessarily have to belong to the same sect in order to use this form of address. Bai Wuxue was about ten years younger than Luo Tian. Thus, him addressing the latter as senior brother was by no means excessive.</p><p>“You’re right.” Luo Tian faintly nodded, “You all are already half-step King. As long as your luck is not bad, you’ll probably be able to get your hands on a life and death stone. Who knows, we might be able to exchange pointers in the future!”</p><p>Entering Life and Death realm was too hard, and Luo Tian didn’t dare say that he could surely become a Life and Death King. Thus, the distance between him and Bai Wuxue and the rest would continue to decrease. And at some point, they might even become rivals.</p><p>“Those few youngsters over there seem to be packing quite a punch!” The long-haired youngster smilingly glanced at Du Gujue, Chu Zhongtian, and the rest.</p><p>Bai Wuxue said, “Unfortunately, we’re not their opponents.”</p><p>Undoubtedly, Du Gujue, Tantai Mingyue, Chu Zhongtian, Liu Wujian, and Jing Tian were peak geniuses of their level. Even Yan Fengfeng would barely make it to this level. They were the once five young tycoons, and Bei Minghui and a few others were also outstanding geniuses. All the other young geniuses came after them.</p><p>Chu Zhongtian could tell that the former were talking about their group from their gazes, so he simply curled his lips in response. Although he could battle while surpassing ranks, one had to measure their opponent. Luo Tian was a genius himself, and should be able to do the same. Moreover, going by his cultivation base which was at the third layer of Life and Death Chamber, Chu Zhongtian reckoned he wouldn’t last a single move.</p><p>If he wanted to challenge the former, he must at least enter the Life and Death Chamber first.</p><p>Like Chu Zhongtian, Dugu Jue and the rest also remained silent.</p><p>The number of people kept increasing one after another. Not only the geniuses of True Spirit Continent, the geniuses around the oceanic regions around the continent were also arriving here. Of course, the number of people from True Spirit Continent was the highest, around thirty. Adding the geniuses from nearby oceanic regions, the number surpassed fifty. Moreover, more were still coming every once in a while.</p><p>Some were giving an extremely frightening aura, and not many knew them. After all, the geniuses of Oceanic Regions didn’t have much to do with True Spirit Continent.</p><p>Creak!</p><p>Time flowed like water. As the evening arrived, the old bronze gate suddenly opened, issuing a creaking sound. The door’s sound gave off an ancient vibe which made everybody’s heart palpitate.</p><p>“It’s open! Enter!” Luo Tian’s group of seven was the first to enter.</p><p>Following after them, the people charged in an unceasing stream, and the figures outside turned increasingly sparse.</p><p>“Seems like he is not coming!” Chu Zhongtian sighed and entered.</p><p>“You won’t miss this chance, right?” Dugu Jue was the last to enter.</p><p>After everybody entered, the bronze gate didn’t close, because the sun had yet to set and the world had to yet to plunge into darkness.</p><p>Shua!</p><p>Far into the distance, a figure was streaking across. The figure landed, and it was someone Ye Chen was ‘acquainted’ with—Blackwater Alliance’s crown prince, Wang Taiyi.</p><p>“Missing Life and Death Chamber is like missing a lifetime opportunity. That kid has most likely already entered. It’ll save the trouble of finding him.” A sneer appeared on Wang Taiyi’s face. As a ‘strongest’ Half-Step King, his name was also in the Life and Death Substitute List, ranked eighth. In his eyes, even if Ye Chen had entered half-step King realm, the latter would not be his opponent. When the time came, he would have the latter fork out enough Zhen Yuan crystals to make up for both the principal and interest.</p><p>Just as he was about to enter the bronze door, he felt something and looked back. A dazzling golden flame was streaking across, cleaving the sky. Inside the flames was a slender figure with a head full of dense black hair.</p><p>“Eh! Body refiner!” Wang Taiyi’s brows raised.</p><p>“Miss, I’m Wang Taiyi! Can I…” Assuming a faint smile, Wang Taiyi stood before the gate, trying to acquaint the newcomer.</p><p>“Get off!” The yellow flames charged forth like a hot knife cutting through butter and entered the gate. Being brushed by the flames, Wang Taiyi stepped aside in a fluster with a pale face.</p><p>“Damn it, who is this woman?” Wang Taiyi’s face turned unsightly. He was trying to be friendly, but the counterpart actually pushed him aside. However, the latter’s strength truly made his heart jump. Merely brushing past the flames turned his blood Qi tumultuous. That woman was clearly not nameless, but a huge dragon.</p><p>“Hmph!” With a light snort, he entered as well.</p><p>…</p><p>Blood Sky Continent…</p><p>Outside the bronze gate at Desolate Mountain Range, a large group of young half-step Kings had gathered. In addition to the eight young beast lords and four demons, there were other young geniuses whose fame was only beneath the former. Some were from Blood Sky Continent while the others from other nearby regions. All in all, their numbers surpassed forty.</p><p>“Linghu Yi, you were defeated by someone? Is it true?” The Young Tiger Lord had tiger stripes on his bare chest and arms, looking as tough as nails. He grinned at Linghu Yi while the latter indifferently said, “It has nothing to do with you.”</p><p>“Hehe, what are you saying? We all belong to the same continent. That kid’s origins are not known. If I run into him, I might to able to vent for you.”</p><p>“Leave that for after you run into him.” A strange gleam flickered in Linghu Yi’s eyes. He was quite clear about Ye Chen’s strength. As far as he could see, Young Tiger Lord would most likely be suffering a loss if he met Ye Chen. Not that it had anything to do with him anyways, so there was no need for him to inform the latter.</p><p>“Young Tiger Lord, be a bit careful lest you suffer unnecessarily! These days, anything can happen, you know?” Lanshan Mei spoke as he caressed his hair which were blowing due to the marine breeze.</p><p>“An unnecessary loss, you say? That would indeed be foolish! But, do you really think such a thing can happen to me?” Young Tiger Lord smiled with disdain.</p><p>“Who can say for sure?” Lanshan Mei said mockingly.</p><p>“You!”</p><p>“What? Am I saying something wrong?”</p><p>In half a month, although Ye Chen’s deeds had not spread out throughout the whole Blood Sky Continent, how could she not know about it as a disciple of Demon Blade Sect? When she heard the news, she immediately thought of Ye Chen. In her view, only he could have the strength to achieve such a feat.</p><p>“Humph!”</p><p>Young Tiger Lord didn’t wish to tangle with this woman. Although she seemed like a flower, she was the grand disciple of the Blood Sky Sect, and was an extremely savage woman. Instead of falling out right here, he would rather get his hands on a few Life and Death Stones first and then settle accounts later.</p><p>Far away from that area, Ye Chen could see the huge bronze gate erected between the heaven and earth, as well as the numerous young geniuses standing nearby.</p><p>‘There are quite a few people, eh?’ Ye Chen inwardly said.</p><p>The others naturally noticed his arrival.</p><p>“Never seen him before!”</p><p>The gazes of numerous geniuses fell on Ye Chen’s body. Some had curiosity and some had malice, while some also had goodwill. Linghu Yi clenched his fists and sucked in a deep breath. Before reaching Life and Death Chamber, he couldn’t be Ye Chen’s opponent. However, he would make sure to settle this feud one day.</p><p>“You’re here!” Lanshan Mei felt that Ye Chen’s aura had become stronger, evidently reaching late Half-Step King realm. She wondered how much his strength had increased.</p><p>“Life and Death Secret Realm only opens once in ten years. How could I miss it?” Ye Chen faintly smiled at Lanshan Mei.</p><p>“Right! Only Life and Death Secret Realm can allow us to shorten the time to enter Life and Death realm.” Lanshan Mei chatted gleefully with Ye Chen, which astounded many others. Demoness Blade Lashan Mei was no virtuous woman. It was quite rare for her to exchange polite words with the opposite sex.</p><p>“Mei, who is he? Why don’t you introduce us?” As the two were chatting, a cyan-haired tall young man walked over. Recognizing the person who had come, Ye Chen couldn’t help but sigh. It was the head of the four demons, the Young Undying Demon Lord. The latter pursuing Lanshan Mei was a matter that almost everybody knew.</p><p>Lanshan Mei’s brows creased, “He is my friend, Ye Chen.”</p><p>“So, it’s brother Ye! We should get to know each other later. Since you seem to know Mei well, you should get to know me as well.” His words were an indication for Ye Chen that he was being too close to Lanshan Mei and should take the hint.</p><p>“Life and Death Chamber is about to open!” Ye Chen avoided his body and gazed at the bronze gate.</p><p>Gasp!</p><p>Everybody was stupefied. This Ye Chen seemed insane!</p><p>The cyan-haired youth also a little dumbstruck, but he recovered quickly. However, his gaze would emit a slight chill once in a while as he looked at Ye Chen.</p><p>As the sun went behind the mountains, the bronze gate opened with a creak, emitting an ancient air.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
