However, everybody in the sect could still feel the intense aftershocks in the air. The winds were roaring, toppling trees here and there and uprooting plants and flowers before shredding them.</p><p>“This is a battle of Kings!” Li Zhangfeng’s pupils shrunk before he mumbled to himself.</p><p>“Patriarch, isn’t Elder Ye cultivating in the center of the mountain range? We…?” Gao Zhiyuan spoke anxiously.</p><p>“What can we do?” The great elder of Eternal Sky Sect smiled bitterly, “A Life and Death King can uproot our sect with a swing of their hands. We can only hope that Ye Chen can turn the situation around and beat the invading Kings back.”</p><p>The news of Ye Chen heavily injuring Giant Wolf King had long arrived in Eternal Sky Sect. Everybody in the sect knew it, increasing their reverence toward him. They now considered him as an existence rivalling ordinary Kings.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>Suddenly, the ground trembled, toppling several buildings inside the sect. In the next moment, a huge purple fireball rose in the distance. Despite being a thousand li away, the fireball seemed right before their eyes, making them wonder how big it actually was.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>At the same time, a light beam came piercing through the air and crashed into the wall of the grand palace, leaving behind a huge black hole.</p><p>“What was that?”</p><p>Everybody was astonished.</p><p>“It looked like a sword?”</p><p>Suppressing the shock, Li Zhangfeng swiftly acted and thrusted his palm on the wall. Puff! The light beam popped out: it was a scabbard.</p><p>“It’s Elder Ye’s scabbard!” Someone recognized.</p><p>Everybody had seen the Evil Shattering Sword sheathed at Ye Chen’s waist several times.</p><p>Holding the scabbard, the concern on Li Zhangfeng’s face deepened. The scope of this battle had far surpassed the battle with Giant Wolf King, or the scabbard wouldn’t have ended in such a situation.</p><p>…</p><p>Along with the fireball, Poison Fire Hand’s elation soared. Purple Fire Explosion was his strongest ace. Not to mention a kid at the third layer of life-and-death-chamber, even a King of his level wouldn’t dare to take this move with his body. He had no doubt that even Ye Chen’s bones wouldn’t be left by now.</p><p>“Blood Hand King though…What a pity!” Poison Fire King couldn’t understand why Ye Chen would choose to kill Blood Hand even at the cost of his life.</p><p>The fireball gradually shrunk while its color turned from purple red to deep red, then orange. With a puff, it scattered into nothingness as if it never existed. Only the huge hole in the ground and the surging lava around it was its only proof of existence.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>But in the next instant, Poison Fire King’s face changed as he saw Ye Chen still holding swords in both his hands.</p><p>In the air, Ye Chen looked terrible. The two swords in his hands were criss-crossed before his chest and head. However, all the other parts of his body had turned deep black in color. His two legs were nowhere to be seen, and his arms holding the swords looked no different from coke. One could even hear faint popping sounds coming from them.</p><p>The moment Blood Hand King’s attack arrived, Ye Chen had instantly turned to defence, replacing the Destruction Sword Intent with Immortal Sword Intent. However, even so, he could only protect his vitals. His two legs directly evaporated from the heat, and the sheath of Evil Shattering Sword was also sent flying. Who knew where it would end up!</p><p>Crackle!</p><p>Suddenly, Ye Chen’s two arms turned into fire clouds and disappeared. With that, the Evil Shattering Sword, Sky Scorpio Sword, and his storage ring all fell down.</p><p>“That’s mine.”</p><p>Poison Fire King attention directly went to Sky Scorpio Sword, and his body flickered.</p><p>“Sword Snake Art!”</p><p>Hum! Hum!</p><p>At that moment, the Evil Shattering Sword and Sky Scorpio Sword faintly shook, then each turned into thirty three identical sword phantoms. The sixty-six swords turned into two twinkling snake swords and coiled around Poison Fire King.</p><p>Poison Fire King blocked the Evil Shattering Sword but couldn’t block Sky Scorpio Sword. As a result, both his hands and legs turned into blood mist. Fortunately, at the crucial moment, a purple fire appeared in his mouth, which repelled the sword snake that was coiling around his head.</p><p>With that, both the swords flew back and hovered above Ye Chen’s head. Meanwhile, his flesh wriggled, spawning bones. In the next moment, Ye Chen’s hands and legs were completely reformed. Following his moving right hand, the storage ring flew up, landing right between his fingers. With a flicker, Ye Chen was wearing a new set of blue robes.</p><p>Poison Fire King couldn’t control his astonishment as he mumbled to himself. “Damn you Yin Sky King! You didn’t even give such crucial information!” Poison Fire King cursed Yin Sky King to his death. Ye Chen was indeed not a Life and Death King, but he had a King level soul, Death dao, and now limb regrowth.</p><p>If this continued, who knew what else he would reveal next!</p><p>However, as he thought a bit more, he couldn’t bring himself to blame Yin Sky King. All these abilities Ye Chen had revealed were extremely powerful, and he must have concealed them, while Yin Sky King’s research was only basic.</p><p>While thinking all that, Poison Fire King also operated his Undying Body, gaining new hands, legs, as well as a new robe.</p><p>“Ye Chen, seems like we underestimated you.” Poison Fire King apprehensively looked at Ye Chen.</p><p>“Who are you?” Ye Chen asked. Hiding his abilities was something he had always done. If not needed, he would never reveal anything. Like in Life and Death Secret Realm, he never revealed the Bewitching Mirror Destruction. He knew that if he didn’t care about these things during usual times, it would be too late to regret in the time of dire need.</p><p>“Who I am is not important. You only need to know that you will die today.” Poison Fire King didn’t believe that he didn’t injure Ye Chen at all. His Poison Fire Explosion was not just pure destructive power, but also contained a powerful fire poison. This poison was as hard to expel as maggots clinging to bones. Once this fire poison erupted in one’s heart, even a King would struggle to live.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>As he spoke, Ye Chen took out a white fruit from his storage ring. This was the life fruit he had obtained from the Life and Death Secret Realm, containing a large amount of life force. As Fire Poison King had thought, Ye Chen’s body still had fire poison that was hard to expel. This fire poison was constantly eating at his life force, making its way to his heart.</p><p>As he chewed the fruit, life force entered his internal organs, replenishing his lost life force. Ye Chen let out a faint sigh of relief; he was not in danger for the time being.</p><p>“You’re using your Undying Body with Zhen Yuan…The consumption is huge, no?” As if he’d thought of something funny, Poison Fire King grinned.</p><p>“You can find out yourself.” Following Ye Chen’s soul power, the two swords fell in his hands.</p><p>“Then let me find for myself…Poison Fire Explosion!”</p><p>Poison Fire King was quite treacherous. He seemed to have opened his mouth for speaking, but what came was his ace. The scorching purple flames caused the space itself to boil, creating transparent bubble waves.</p><p>“Extinguish!” In response, Ye Chen just raised the Sky Scorpio Sword and chopped.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>The space froze, sealing the purple red flames within, then shattering them into a million pieces.</p><p>“Let me see how long you can keep?”</p><p>Poison Fire King was clearly looking out for Ye Chen’s Zhen Yuan consumption. He continued to spout purple flames, assaulting the latter from several li away.</p><p>Of course, he didn’t dare to close in on Ye Chen, as he still had lingering fears about Soul Light. Blood Hand King was also killed by Soul Light. Otherwise, how could have Ye Chen killed the other with his strength? Ye Chen’s Soul Light was not one bit inferior to a high grade heaven step soul art in its great completion.</p><p>“Humph!”</p><p>Ye Chen coldly snorted. Poison Fire King thought that his Zhen Yuan was about to run out, but his body actually still had sixty-seventy percent left. Using the Undying Body only cost him about thirty percent. However, this didn’t mean he could use Zhen Yuan as he pleased. The fire poison didn’t seem threatening at the moment, but once his Zhen Yuan went below half, it would no longer be as suppressed, and it would attack his heart. At that point, Poison Fire King didn’t have to kill him at all, as he would die by himself.</p><p>“Congealing Water!”</p><p>Using Bewitching Mirror Shattering with Evil Shattering Sword in his left hand, Ye Chen thrust forth with the Sky Scorpio Sword. Water-like purple sword energy pierced through the void and frantically assaulted Poison Fire King, who jumped in fright.</p><p>“Mind as two…a perfect mind as two?”</p><p>Dividing one’s mind in two was not that hard to accomplish, but to do it perfectly like Ye Chen, which was the same as using two aces simultaneously, was something not many could do. Poison Fire King admitted he himself couldn’t do it.</p><p>“Poison Fire Barrier!” Slashing a semicircle with his right hand, Poison Fire King condensed a circular purple barrier.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>The water-like sword energy assaulted the barrier, setting off one ripple after another. With a muffled groan, Poison Fire King retreated several steps, unable to release Poison Fire Explosion brewing in his body.</p><p>“This is it!”</p><p>Ye Chen rapidly closed the distance. Bewitching Mirror Shattering with the left hand and Congealing Water with the right, his body seemingly turned into two, both fiercely assaulting Poison Fire King.</p><p>Peng Peng Peng Peng!</p><p>Poison Fire King again retreated with a trace of blood at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>“How much Zhen Yuan does this kid have? How can the fire poison in his body not erupt?”</p><p>Poison Fire King gradually leaned toward giving up. From the very beginning, he had underestimated Ye Chen at every turn, making him increasingly uncertain.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>Fiercely opening the space, Poison Fire King leapt in.</p><p>“Bewitching Mirror Shattering, condense!”</p><p>Ye Chen’s body steamed as he used the Bewitching Mirror Shattering with the Sky Scorpio Sword. With that, a ridiculous scene occurred—Poison Fire King’s body was stuck in the spatial barrier. Half of his body went inside, and the other half dangled outside, making him look comical.</p><p>Spatial Shattering!</p><p>With that, Poison Fire King’s outer lower body shattered into a million pieces, causing a bloody downpour.</p><p>“Ye Chen, you will die! I’ll take my revenge!”</p><p>From the depths of void came a furious roar. However, Ye Chen didn’t care about Poison Fire King’s words. He spurted out a mouthful of purple red blood. The blood didn’t have a trace of life force, but brimmed with fire poison. Actually, at this moment, Ye Chen was almost at his limits. The last attack of Bewitching Mirror Shattering caused his Zhen Yuan to lose its hold over the fire poison, causing a part of it to erupt. If Fire Poison King had stayed any longer, the loser would certainly have been Ye Chen. Unfortunately, he was scared off.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
