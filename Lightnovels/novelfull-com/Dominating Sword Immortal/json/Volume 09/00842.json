Seeing that the door had opened, they hurried to move in before disappearing into that mysterious gate.</p><p>The Immortal Demon glanced at Ye Chen and said to Lan Shanmei, “Sister Lan, I will excuse me first. Remember to look for me once inside.”</p><p>The gate was only a transporting gate, and entering at the same time would still result in different landing locations. So, there was no need for him to enter the door with Lan Shanmei at the same time.</p><p>“Ye Chen, I will leave first too.”</p><p>Lan Shanmei was a bit older than Ye Chen, and her cultivation was at peak level first life and death challenge. But, just like Ye Chen, it was her first time seeing the opening of the gate as well. Her body flashed before she shot out into the gate within a second.</p><p>Ye Chen nodded slightly as he watched the rest of the warriors disappearing into the gate. Those people included Shi Shaobao from the Golden Lion Race.</p><p>“The life and death secret realm only opens once every ten years and it lasts three months. I wonder if the demon king would let Murong come here.”</p><p>After waiting for a while, the sun was about to set and the gate seemed about to close. At that moment, Ye Chen forced a smile and stopped waiting, moving to jump into the door. It was right then the gate suddenly sealed shut, disappearing into the surreal space.</p><p>…</p><p>It was a creepy looking meadow, creepy because some of the places on this land seemed to be covered in green grass, looking lively, while some areas had nothing but plain ground. And there was no distinguishing line between those two different areas because even though this ground was full of greenery this second, it could have nothing anymore but death in the next second. And the bare ground might have new green growing out in the next second, which would then grow at an extreme speed.</p><p>Life and death!</p><p>Growth and decay!</p><p>It all took on a big role here.</p><p>“What a fantastic secret realm!”</p><p>Ye Chen saw this after being transported in and was shocked. He who learned the profound of wood could make a plant grow as well, but even he could still not make it happen so smoothly like it was happening here in the secret realm.</p><p>The life and death secret realm seemed to contain the concept of reincarnation. Life was not the beginning and death was not the end; life and death was simply a loop.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>Over the head, an eagle cry so powerful that it could shock a man’s soul was suddenly heard. Ye Chen looked up and all he could see was a grey eagle formed in that chaotic sky which did not look like an actual lifeform, but had a surprisingly fast speed. It was still hundreds of meters in the sky, but was already less than one meter from Ye Chen’s head in the next second.</p><p>Ye Chen did not dare to be reckless as he took his Evil shattering sword and stabbed into the eagle’s chest.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>Without any blood, the eagle’s body became blurry again before turning into a beam of bicolored qi flow and disappearing in the air.</p><p>It was a qi of life and death. And the grey eagle was indeed formed from that qi.</p><p>“It seems like I cannot let my guard down at all since this is just the outer area of the realm, and yet the grey eagle already is a mid half step king warrior, with powerful attacks that normal half step king warriors cannot muster. It was rather close to scratching my head after all.”</p><p>Life and death creatures were a molded pile of energy from the qi which then was given evil intentions. These kinds of creatures were not living beings and could only survive in the life and death secret realm.</p><p>“Unfortunately, it was just formed. So, although its power was strong, there was no life and death stone inside.”</p><p>Ye Chen shook his head. Inside the life and death secret realm were present the life and death stones, which would only appear inside these types of creatures. Normally, creatures that carried the life and death stones would be hard to destroy. For example, that grey eagle would not have been killed with one sword attack like Ye Chen had just done if it carried a life and death stone inside.</p><p>After flying for a while, a wave of crazy energy vibration suddenly appeared in the horizon. Clearly, someone was battling.</p><p>“Battling already? Perhaps they have found life and death stones!”</p><p>Flicking his eyebrows, Ye Chen increased his speed and turned into a beam of sword light as he shot out into the distance.</p><p>On that endless meadow, two human figures continued to overlap and clash together, causing an aggressive blasting wave to spread out everywhere and countless massive holes to appear on the land.</p><p>“This life and death stone was retrieved by me after putting in hard effort in killing that evil spirit. If you are smart enough, then leave immediately. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being cruel.” The young man in yellow exchanged attacks with a young man in brown while yelling at him. But, the latter sneered in response. “The winner gets all and the loser should just piss off. The life and death stone is not something you can own. I will keep it for you.”</p><p>“B*stard! Don’t push it too hard.”</p><p>The young man in yellow was furious. There were three different areas inside the secret realm—the core area, inner circles, and the outer circles. If the entire life and death secret realm was a circle, then the core area naturally would be the center and the inner area would be the area between the core and outer area.</p><p>The outer area would be the safest, but it also meant that there would not be as many life and death stones. Some of the weaker warriors would only linger in the outer area, which meant they were unlikely to get any good ones at all. And if they managed to get their hands on some of them, it would just mean that they had a great luck.</p><p>The young man in yellow found an evil spirit the second he entered this realm. With a little bit of hope, he fought three hundred rounds of attacks with this opponent before finally beating it. And what made him super happy was that there was actually a life and death stone inside this evil spirit. And one was already enough for him to have some hope to reach the Life and Death Realm.</p><p>Unfortunately, he was spotted before he could even hide it properly.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The two of them fought madly, the blasting waves of their attacks affecting the area around them within a hundred miles radius. It was like an earthquake or hundreds of massive elephants running together.</p><p>“Go die!”</p><p>The young man in yellow had just fought the spirit not long ago and carried some wounds. After a long battle, his opponent managed to find a gap during which he managed to throw out a punch at him.</p><p>Pooh!</p><p>He puked out a mouthful of blood as his whole body flew back out. Meanwhile, his opponent followed him closely and threw out another punch. All of a sudden, that powerful fist power shattered the head of the young man in yellow.</p><p>However, something confusing had happened. After the young man’s head exploded, his whole body faded and that wave of blood mist faded as well. A life and death stone with two differently colored qi flow wrapped around it floated in the air.</p><p>Holding that stone in his hand, the young man with brown robes laughed. With this stone and as long as he did not have bad luck, he knew he would be able to reach the life and death realm. After all, the warriors that managed to enter the life and death secret realm already had enough potential to reach the life and death realm eventually.</p><p>The stone could just save them sometime.</p><p>Of course, what martial geniuses lacked the most was time.</p><p>“Eh? Someone is here!” Suddenly, the young man’s expression changed. The life and death stone had fused with his body and his speed increased drastically. Within a blink of an eye, he had disappeared into the horizon.</p><p>“Huh, he sure can run fast.” From afar, Ye Chen rushed over.</p><p>Seeing him run away, he felt a bit disappointed since one life and death stone could give him ninety percent chance of reaching the life and death first chamber. Although, the percentage of that possibility decreased with the increase in cultivation, and not all high rank half step king warriors could have that high a possibility of succeeding. But, who among the warriors that managed to come here was not a top martial genius?</p><p>Inside the Savage Mountain in the Blood Heaven Land, at the place where the gate to Life and Death Secret Realm once opened…</p><p>Woooo!</p><p>The space vibrated and the young man in yellow robes appeared out of nowhere, having a scary look on his face. “Damn it! If I don’t avenge this, I swear I am not a man.”</p><p>…</p><p>There were not many life and death stones in the outer area of the secret realm. So, Ye Chen did not want to waste too much time there anymore, and carried on to move toward the central area.</p><p>“Thousand Year Life Plant!”</p><p>“The Life Fruit!”</p><p>Life and Death Secret Realm was not just a wasteland, as there were still valuable spirit plants growing here. Both of the plants had the effect of treating severe wounds. Once the plants got enough years on them, they might be able to turn a pile of white bones back to a living human being as well.</p><p>These healing plants were extremely rare, and Ye Chen would surely not let them go. So, he picked all of them up and stored them in his ring.</p><p>He carried on moving forward while using his soul power to scan the surroundings. He maintained his energy usage to a level that he would not burn himself out too much, but would not miss any of the valuable items either.</p><p>As his soul power brushed through a rock, he seemed to have noticed something and pushed his soul power again.</p><p>“Such a rich wave of death qi!” He stopped and landed next to the rock. This normal looking rock was plain, but if looked carefully, one could find that the surface was surrounded with a light grey aura. At the mere touch of it, all plants nearby seemed to die instantly.</p><p>“Lift!” Ye Chen used his palm to make a grabbing gesture and a wave of sucking power appeared.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The massive rock rushed out of the ground and landed in Ye Chen’s right hand. His palm shook lightly, and the rock shattered completely all of a sudden. Within the rock was a palm-sized dark mineral rock. On the surface, the grey qi was moving as if it was breathing in and out. The second Ye Chen’s Zhen yuan touched it, it seemed about to break completely.</p><p>“Death Qi Iron!” Ye Chen slowly said out its name.</p><p>The Death Qi Iron was one of the extreme rank metals. Although it was not listed in the top 10 rare iron list, it was still a rare kind. Ye Chen had the ability to cultivate swords, so he would be able to eventually use it to create an extreme rank metal. The Death Qi Iron was almost just as useable for him as Life and Death stones.</p><p>“You are quite lucky, managing to find that big a death qi iron rock. After cultivating it for a while, you might be able to get a dragon eye sized death qi iron. How about I make you a deal? Five million top rank spirit stones for that one death qi iron?”</p><p>Not far away from Ye Chen, a warrior appeared and flew over. He looked at the rock in Ye Chen’s hand while talking with a greedy expression in his eyes.</p><p>“Do I look like a hobo in your eyes?”</p><p>Ye Chen had noticed him before he even appeared. Since they did not have beef from before, Ye Chen prepared not to make a fuss if they did not run into each other.</p><p>“I am the head disciple of the White Wolf Beast Martial School, and they call me Wolf Warrior. I think you have probably heard about me before. So, how about you show me some respect and sell it for five million top rank spirit stones? Alright?”</p><p>White Wolf Beast Martial School was one of the top beast martial schools, and he was one of the top eight beast warriors. Normally, people would be frightened no matter which of the two titles they heard, and would make the “right” call and sell him for whatever he wanted. So, the Wolf Warrior looked at Ye Chen with a light smile on his face as he finished talking, waiting for the latter to hand it over.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
