Just a consciousness projection had a mid-step King realm cultivation base, so his real body could only be a high-step King. Meanwhile, he himself was merely a tyrant amongst mid-step Kings, and could barely contend against ordinary high-step Kings.</p><p>The masked man!</p><p>An image appeared in Ye Chen’s mind.</p><p>“Could he be confirming my death?” The masked-man had no enmity or grudges with him, but he still wanted him dead. It was evident that he’d come specifically for him. He could feel the existence of an incorporeal net gradually closing in on him.</p><p>“Kid, how many people have you offended?” Copper Sword King turned around with a gloomy face. He was sure that the masked-man had not come for him. Hence, the only possibility was that he had come to deal with Ye Chen. Who would have expected that he would end up offending a high-step King for no reason? Thus, he was feeling a bit gloomy.</p><p>“Actually, I have no idea who he is either.”‘</p><p>How could Ye Chen know that he was being targeted by powerhouses of the otherworld? He was further clueless that Battle King himself was killed by these people, and even Mysterious Queen suffered an assassination attempt from them.</p><p>“Oh well, I never should have come in the first place.”</p><p>Copper Sword King shook his head and expelled the distracting thoughts from his mind, “I said that I’ll leave you alone if you can take three moves from me. I’ll keep my word.”</p><p>“Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>As far as Ye Chen was concerned, if he could do without taking out Yuan Emperor Phantom, he would be happy. After all, it was his trump card.</p><p>Expelling the thoughts of supreme grade sword from his mind, Copper Sword King turned his interests toward Ye Chen, “As far as I know, there are only five people with Sword Domain in the entire True Spirit World, and four amongst them are in Sky Sword Continent. And then there is you, ze ze… You know what’s the highest layer of Sword Domain currently?”</p><p>“I don’t!” Ye Chen shook his head.</p><p>“Three layers!” Copper Sword King said, “Sword Domain has a total of nine layers. However, it is much harder to evolve than even the spirit body and will. With every evolution, Sword Rules increases in power by several folds. If your Sword Domain had been at the peak of the third layer, even if I had fought at full power, I would have been hard-pressed to injure you. As long as your Zhen Yuan didn’t run out, I could have done nothing to you. Of course, your strength is too low, so neither of us would have won.”</p><p>Copper Sword King had Sword Yuan, allowing his offense and defense to be far stronger than Kings of the same level.</p><p>“Of course!”</p><p>If Ye Chen had to pick between two opponents- an ordinary high step King or Copper Sword King, Ye Chen would pick the former without any hesitation. At least the former’s defenses would not be as absurd as Copper Sword King’s. Against him, Ye Chen would exhaust all his Zhen Yuan and still be unable to inflict a single wound, much less to speak of victory.</p><p>“Sky Sword Continent condenses the sword Qi of the world and has the mystical spatial sword realm. If you have the opportunity, go there and challenge the sword realm. It’ll be a great boon to your sword dao. Of course, you better attain Life and Death Realm first. I can curb my greed for your supreme grade sword, but others might not do so. Dragon King is not in this world for too long, which is something everybody knows.”</p><p>Since he’d given up on the supreme grade sword, he might as well establish good relations with Ye Chen.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll take my leave here.” Copper Sword King’s body flickered and entered the void.</p><p>“Sword artists have firm will in most cases. Copper Sword King also seems the same.” Mumbling to himself, Ye Chen turned around and headed toward the Eternal Sky Sect.</p><p>The second appearance of the masked man made Ye Chen feel an urgency. With his current strength, he’d no confidence to safely escape an assassination attempt from a high step King. Most importantly, he couldn’t say if he would even have the time to let Yuan Emperor Phantom out, because high step Kings bent on assassinating him would either not act or lead with their aces.</p><p>“Comprehending the life dao is a pressing matter now.” At his elder’s summit, Ye Chen let out a long sigh of relief.</p><p>“Eh?” Suddenly, he raised his head.</p><p>“Your sense is really sharp!” The space in his chamber rippled, and a white-haired old man walked out.</p><p>“Senior Dragon King.” A momentary astonishment flashed on Ye Chen’s face before he promptly cupped his fists with utmost sincerity.</p><p>Dragon King kindly smiled, “Every time I see you, I can see your great progress. It’s a really good feeling. Who would have thought that I will be able to see two juniors maturing so fast on my deathbed!”</p><p>“Senior Dragon King, you’ve already exceeded the shackles of life. You can do it again and extend your life.”</p><p>“There are indeed methods to prolong life, but it’s not time yet. That is the road to almost certain death.” Dragon King’s expression gravened somewhat.</p><p>“Certain death?” Ye Chen was befuddled.</p><p>“It’s useless to talk about these things right now. You’ll know later. I’ve come to explain your future progress a bit, and secondly, to bid my farewell.”</p><p>“Senior is going to challenge that road to death.” Ye Chen guessed at once.</p><p>“Everyone has to die. I can live a few years more than others, which is already a grace of the heavens.” Dragon King didn’t wish to linger on this topic, “Seems like you’ve comprehended the Death dao. Now, all you need to do is comprehend the Life dao, then verify the two against each other.”</p><p>“However, Life dao is the challenging part. Back in the day, little girl Yan comprehended Death dao at the age of thirty-one, but she comprehended Life dao at the age of thirty four, and entered Life and Death realm a year later. I’ve no doubts regarding your comprehension ability, but I’ve to warn you that the comprehension of Life dao can’t be rushed. The more you rush it, the farther away you’ll end up. You’ll have to wholeheartedly sink yourself into the comprehension of the existence of the natural life, the existence of life force of all matter, the existence of mundane things that are usually overlooked, and also the cruel nature and darkness of life. There are many geniuses who never enter Life and Death Realm because the more they walk on this path, the farther they end up.”</p><p>“Senior Dragon King, I believe that I can comprehend Life dao soon.” Ye Chen was different from the others. He’d already experienced true life and death; his arrival itself was finding life amidst death. Of course, he still couldn’t comprehend it immediately. After all, he’d only comprehended the life-and-death of his own life, not that of all existence. However, despite this flaw, his starting point was much higher than others’.</p><p>“Hehe, that would be for the best.” Dragon King didn’t doubt Ye Chen’s words, and instead felt relieved. Throughout all these years, he and Mysterious Queen were both clear on Ye Chen’s character. In all honesty, he might be an unprecedentedly frightening young man. A lot of people would try to avoid their weakness despite knowing it, but Ye Chen always self-reflected and self-improved. Sometimes, he often had a mystical feeling that Ye Chen might be from a different world.</p><p>“Senior, can’t you wait for me to become Life and Death King before embarking on that road?” Ye Chen didn’t wish to see Dragon King walking to his own death. There were bound to be many mysteries in this world that the latter was still unaware about.</p><p>“There is no time! If I don’t do it now, I’ll lose the little chance I have.” Dragon King shook his head with a bitter smile. “After I leave, you’ll take care of that lass Xu Jing.”</p><p>“Of course!”</p><p>“This is my first time at the Eternal Sky Sect. Thinking back, kid Li was also an astonishing genius of sword arts. Unfortunately, he died early and couldn’t display his full potential. These otherwordlings have always been my True Spirit World’s tumor. Who knows how many people died in their hands.”</p><p>“Right, I wonder who the guardian of Eternal Sky Sect is. It might be someone I know!” As he spoke, Dragon King released his soul power, spreading it out in every direction.</p><p>“Such a secretive soul power. I can barely feel a ripple.” If Dragon King were not standing right across him, Ye Chen might not have felt the former’s soul power at all. And he could feel the soul power currently only because he was already prepared.</p><p>“Eh!”</p><p>Dragon King’s brows suddenly raised as he grabbed Ye Chen’s shoulder and entered the void. The space spun, and both appeared in the core of mountain range at the back of Eternal Sky Sect.</p><p>Feeling a bit dizzy, Ye Chen immediately steadied his mind.</p><p>“Senior, what’s happening?”</p><p>“Something’s strange. Underneath the surface is a really mysterious array. However, the array seems to have sustained slight damage, causing it to leak some of its aura. Otherwise, even I couldn’t have detected its existence.”</p><p>“Array?”</p><p>Ye Chen thought back to his battle against the Poison Fire King and Blood Hand King. That battle damaged the terrain here and might have ended up revealing the existence of this array. Of course, his soul power was far inferior to Dragon King, and he wouldn’t have discovered it by himself.</p><p>“Come, we’ll head down.”</p><p>Dragon King’s body gleamed in a golden radiance before he grabbed Ye Chen and penetrated underground. En-route, the latter almost couldn’t feel the existence of space. Reaching thirty-forty thousand meters deep underground, Dragon King finally stopped.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>With a stretch of the Dragon King’s hand covered in a golden light, the earth before them parted open by itself, revealing a huge underground space. At the center of this space was a perfectly spherical earthen sphere with a diameter of thirty meters. Faint ripples coming from above the surface could be felt at the sphere.</p><p>“It’s Fire King’s Soul Passing Array!”</p><p>The so-called soul passing array was an array that would render soul scouting in the area impossible. If a soul power swept this area, it would treat this piece of land as ordinary ground.</p><p>“Who is Fire King?”</p><p>Dragon King said, “When I was young, I came across Fire King several times, but he disappeared later. If the guardian of Eternal Sky Sect is him, then he is a titled monarch for sure and should be called the Fire Emperor.”</p><p>“However, as I remember, he was seventy to eighty years older than me.”</p><p>“He is dead?” Ye Chen gazed at the earthen sphere.</p><p>“Dead or not, we’ll know once we break this array.” Dragon King closed his eyes and carefully inspected the workings of the array with his soul power. After a while, he opened his eyes. “Clever! Fortunately, it has sustained some damage and seems to lack energy to operate. Otherwise, I might not have been able to resolve it.”</p><p>Creak…</p><p>Dragon King’s soul power shook, and the earthen sphere split apart, revealing a purple light sphere. In the center of the purple light sphere was a human figure sitting with its head down.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
