Others not being able to surpass his name can still be explained. However, Young Snake Lord’s cultivation base has already reached the third layer, and he has the Nine Headed Snake bloodline. It makes no sense!”</p><p>“Don’t tell me Ye Chen is not a human?”</p><p>“Not possible! He is a human for sure. Not everybody can be blind here.”</p><p>Everybody was left puzzled by this outcome.</p><p>“Impossible!” Young Snake Lord’s first reaction was to doubt the stelle.</p><p>“Hehe…Young Snake Lord, seems like you didn’t take your cultivation diligently these years.” Young Undying Demon Lord sinisterly chucked before walking to the stelle and writing his own name.</p><p>First!</p><p>Eventually, somebody surpassed Ye Chen’s name. He was the leader of the Blood Sky Continent’s Four Demons indeed.</p><p>‘It should be because of his undying body.’ Ye Chen guessed inwardly.</p><p>Undying Body was a basic ability possessed by all kings, and it increased one’s vital Qi by huge amounts. Since both Ye Chen and Young Undying Demon Lord had Undying Bodies, the rankings were decided based on cultivation base. Seeing Young Undying Demon Lord’s name overtaking Ye Chen’s name, everybody could finally ascertain that the stelle had no problem, and Ye Chen’s vital Qi was indeed freakishly strong.</p><p>Ultimately, only Young Elephant Lord and Xu Jing were left.</p><p>Last time, Young Elephant Lord’s vital Qi was underneath that of Young Undying Demon Lord. It was hard to tell what the result would be this time.</p><p>Amongst everybody present on the scene, Young Undying Demon Lord was only apprehensive of three people: Marquis Star Sword, Luo Tiandu, and the Young Elephant Lord. For the former two, they could be gravely injured if hit, but Young Elephant Lord had both powerful strength and defense, which specifically countered him.</p><p>As Young Elephant Lord made his way to the stelle, Young Undying Demon Lord’s eyes squinted. If the former ranked under him, he had more than fifty percent chance to surpass him, and even had hope to snatch the first rank in the substitute list.</p><p>Young Elephant Lord looked quite relaxed; he was quite clear how powerful his vital Qi was as he wrote his name.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>First!</p><p>His name surpassed both Ye Chen and Young Undying Demon Lord, claiming the top spot.</p><p>“Seems like Young Elephant Lord has a chance to claim the first rank this time.”</p><p>“Last time, Young Undying Demon Lord’s vitality was stronger than Young Elephant Lord. Doesn’t this mean that the difference between the two has increased even more?”</p><p>“Not necessarily! Who knows if the Undying Demon Lord has gained powerful means? After all, it’s hard to guess how big their improvement has been after so many years.”</p><p>“Right, sounds reasonable! Vital Qi is nothing more than a reference.”</p><p>“Senior Sister Xu Jing, it’s your turn.” Ye Chen let go of her hand.</p><p>“Right!” Xu Jing faintly nodded and strode forth.</p><p>Others had no idea, but Ye Chen had no doubt that her vital Qi would be the highest. Golden Dragon, a true legendary beast of True Spirit World, was a genuine huge dragon. On the True Spirit Continent, not to mention a huge dragon, even sub-dragons were a rarity. One could even say that the Golden Dragon was an existence that surpassed the beast records of the ancient times, and was more like a legend.</p><p>Without any surprise, Xu Jing’s name immediately snatched the position, flickering with a faint golden light and giving off a holy feeling. This scene naturally made everybody stupefied. Gazes landed on her one after another, trying to figure out her identity.</p><p>“I’ve already activated, but still ended up being pushed down.” Young Elephant Lord could feel that Xu Jing was different from others, neither human nor any demonic beast. “That’s good too. How can an ordinary woman match up to me? Only this kind of woman is worthy for me to chase. As for this kid, I’ll have to look for an opportunity to take care of him.”</p><p>Young Elephant Lord looked at Ye Chen with killing intent.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>Before the stelle, a spatial ripple appeared, and an indistinct human figure emerged. The figure was expressionless, and his voice was cold.</p><p>“The rankings will be computed by total battle credits as usual. Every person will battle with every other person once. Every win will gain you one credit while loss will gain you nothing. In the end, the first ranked will get three life-and-death stones, second and third ranked will get two, and fourth to tenth will get one.”</p><p>“First place reward is three life-and-death stones…second and third place reward is also two stones!” A faint smile appeared on Ye Chen’s face. He was lacking two life-and-death stones in order to break through into the third layer of life-and-death chamber. Once he attained the third layer, he would have the confidence to contend against ordinary Kings.</p><p>“Credit battle begins!” The indistinct figure disappeared.</p><p>Immediately afterward, thirty-six dark tunnels appeared in the chamber. These dark tunnels emitted a powerful attractive force, and each of them sucked one person each inside. Ye Chen and Xu Jing were also sucked inside 2 different tunnels.</p><p>Ye Chen soon appeared in a small chamber, at the front of which was a huge crystal that showed the huge chamber they had been in before. Right at this moment, two names shone.</p><p>Lanshan Mei and Marquis Giant Sword.</p><p>Sha…</p><p>The huge chamber’s wall revealed two openings, and Lanshan Mei and Marquis Giant Sword jumped out from within. Previously, it seemed that the walls of the huge chamber were made of solid rocks. However, after entering the small chamber, one could clearly see that they were actually made of a special crystal that allowed one to see from the inside but not from the outside, like those special glasses from Ye Chen’s previous world.</p><p>The huge chamber was a thousand meters wide. Thus, Lashan Mei and Marquis Giant Sword started a couple hundred meters away from each other.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Marquis Giant Sword’s weapon was a sword that was even bigger than a person. He rapidly charged across and waved his huge sword, letting out a rainbow-like sword Qi.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>However, Lashan Mei’s blade arts were extremely tyrannous. With a single blade strike, she sent the huge sword flying from Marquis Giant Sword’s hand, then swung her blade. Marquis Giant Sword’s head flew high in the air, spurting blood.</p><p>“Powerful! Worthy of being the Blade Demoness, Lashan Mei.”</p><p>“Demonic Blade Sect’s blade arts are simply aces for killing in close-combat.”</p><p>Seeing Lashan Mei settling Marquis Giant Sword in two blade strikes, a lot of people sighed.</p><p>“Damn it!” Inside one of the small chambers, Marquis Giant Sword’s body condensed without missing a hair. In Life-and-Death Palace, one didn’t have to worry about death after all.</p><p>As soon as the fight concluded, another two names shone: Dugu Jue and Young Eagle Lord.</p><p>“I wonder what realm Dugu Jue’s strength has reached…” From inside the small chamber, Ye Chen was paying attention to Dugu Jue. The latter had a headful of white hair and his forehead was giving off an ice-cold killing intent, seeming as if he was born for slaughter.</p><p>“Soaring Eagle!”</p><p>Young Eagle Lord didn’t put Dugu Jue in his eyes at all. He was the peak genius in Blood Sky Continent, considered as one of the two demonic stars along with Lashan Mei. His talent and perception were both above Young Elephant Lord as well as Young Undying Demon Lord.</p><p>A falcon condensed from beast energy pounced at Dugue Jue, moving like lightning as it locked on Dugu Jue’s vital Qi. However, the latter remained expressionless.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>He unsheathed his blade.</p><p>First chop!</p><p>Bang! The falcon was cleaved into two, and pale white blade light headed straight to Young Eagle’s head.</p><p>Young Eagle Lord’s scalp turned numb. What kind of blade art was this? It made him feel despair from the depths of his soul. With a screech, Young Eagle turned into a huge eagle, soaring into the sky and avoiding the blade light.</p><p>“You think can keep dodging?”</p><p>Young Eagle Lord’s movements were quick, but Dugue Jue was even quicker as he immediately leapt up and issued the second strike.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Young Eagle Lord’s one wing was cut off amidst splattering blood.</p><p>Third Blade!</p><p>A huge hole appeared in Young Eagle Lord’s chest as the blade light pierced through his body.</p><p>“Such ferocious blade arts! This is True Spirit Continent’s genius blade artist?” Lashan Mei’s brows creased. As a blade artist, there were only two people who made her apprehensive—Thunder Spirit King and now Dugu Jue. If Thunder Spirit King’s blade arts were broad and all-encompassing, Dugu Jue’s blade arts only gave off one feeling—despair.</p><p>“Young Eagle Lord hasn’t made any improvements! Although his cultivation base has increased a lot, his battle strength has only increased by a bit, not nearly enough to keep pace with me.” Young Elephant Lord shook his head. Young Eagle Lord didn’t lack talent, but temperament. The fame of twin demonic stars had gotten to his head, making him complacent. In contrast, Lashan Mei far surpassed him in terms of efforts.</p><p>Third battle, Marquis Star Sword against Jihai Ruo…</p><p>“You can go first!” Marquis Star Sword faintly smiled at Jihai Ruo.</p><p>“I ran into him so soon?”</p><p>Jihai Ruo felt bitter. With her strength, it was simply impossible for her to beat Marquis Star Sword. Of course, she wouldn’t concede without a fight. If she lost, it must be through a battle.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>She spun both of her hands in a circle and a huge Zhen Yuan cauldron appeared before her body. The cauldron exploded forth, carrying a majestic aura. This was the special method of Cauldron King Sect.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>However, Marquis Star Sword waved the sword in his hand without budging from his position. A light spark pierced through the cauldron, then pierced Jihai Ruo’s throat.</p><p>Jihai Ruo had lost!</p><p>“The difference is too big!”</p><p>“Marquis Star Sword is Marquis Star Sword!”</p><p>“Nobody could be True Spirit World’s number one young sword genius except him.”</p><p>Marquis Star Sword’s sword arts caused many to gasp in astonishment.</p><p>“His sword arts are powerful, but to say he is the number one, that will have to wait.” Chu Zhongtian didn’t accept anybody. If he really had to have a target to chase, that would be Ye Chen.</p><p>The credit battle was going fast because everybody was revealing a part of their aces, wanting to end the battle as quickly as possible and concealing as much as possible. After all, when the battle power of the opposing sides were equivalent, one’s aces were extremely important.</p><p>Xu Jing’s vital Qi was the strongest. Coincidentally or not, her opponent was the lowest person on the stelle. Thus, the conclusion was obvious.</p><p>Life and Death Stelle flickered again, illuminating Ye Chen and Marquis Short Sword’s names.</p><p>Seeing that his opponent was Ye Chen, Marquis Short Sword cursed his bad luck. He wished to face Ye Chen later, as had no intention of being abused so early.</p><p>“As long as I can resist one strike, I’ll be good.” Marquis Short Sword set a target for himself.</p><p>Battle began!</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>And ended!</p><p>Marquis Short Sword had a hole on his forehead.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
