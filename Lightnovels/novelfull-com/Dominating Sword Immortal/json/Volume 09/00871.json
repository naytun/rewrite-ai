I already beat you.”</p><p>The last days allowed Ye Chen to have an even better understanding of the Congealing Water Sword. It now had an even better hint of metal birthing water, giving him a starting point to integrate the two profounds. Since there was hardly any time left, Ye Chen left the waterfall, but didn’t expect Young Elephant Lord, who had made some progress, to try and establish his might through him. Thus, he would naturally not give much face.</p><p>“Humph, that was then, and this is now! Just bring out your sword domain!” Young Elephant was quite dissatisfied with his sixth rank, and he was even more displeased that Ye Chen had obtained the first rank. As far as he was concerned, Ye Chen with his Sword Domain or without didn’t matter much to him. He was not Young Undying Demon Lord, who could not even move under Sword Domain.</p><p>“To deal with you, I don’t need Sword Domain.”</p><p>Ye Chen was naturally aware that Sword Domain would not affect body refiners like Xu Jing and Young Elephant Lord. Of course, Sword Domain could still make the battle much easier for him.</p><p>“Not using Sword Domain?”</p><p>Everybody was astonished.</p><p>In the ranking battles, Ye Chen had relied on Sword Domain to beat Young Elephant Lord. He had suppressed the latter with the Sword Domain and then pierced his eyes. In their view, even though the latter seemed to be disregarding Ye Chen’s Sword Domain, he was still apprehensive to some extent.</p><p>However, at this moment, Ye Chen had proclaimed that he would not be using the Sword Domain. He would obviously not be going back on his words. So, what was he relying on? He must have made considerable improvement.</p><p>Ye Chen’s words were somewhat beyond Young Elephant Lord’s expectations, but he was pleasantly surprised. Ye Chen had relied on Sword Domain to beat him before. Therefore, he thought he would surely Sword Domain again. In that case, it would be better for him to appear magnanimous and ask Sword Domain on his own. However, for some reason, Ye Chen actually gave up Sword Domain.</p><p>“You sure can talk big…Take my fist!”</p><p>With his body swelling to three meters, Young Elephant Lord charged forth in huge strides and raised his huge fist to punch out. A rich savage Qi wantonly burst forth, faintly giving off an illusion of a hundred elephants crying out together.</p><p>Eight Savage Elephant Fist!</p><p>Following his fist, everybody felt a heaviness on their bodies. Young Elephant Lord’s earth profound had clearly improved, improving the might of his fist by a lot.</p><p>“Ye Chen, show me your ace!” Marquis Sword Snow didn’t think for a second that Ye Chen was deliberately trying to be mysterious. As the first ranked, he would never be stupid.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>Confronting Young Elephant Lord’s punch, Ye Chen pulled his sword out. The sword made its way out of the sheath seemingly slowly, yet was extremely fast, gleaming with a dim golden color like water.</p><p>So fast!</p><p>This was everybody’s first impression, and the second impression was, ‘So tyrannous, so flexible!’</p><p>Since Congealing Water Sword contained both metal’s hardness and strength as well as water’s softness and tenacity, it seemed twice as exquisite as Waning Moon.</p><p>Pop!</p><p>Amidst sounds of sparks crackling off a cotton cloth, Evil Shattering Sword pierced through the fist energy and obliquely landed on Young Elephant Lord’s fist.</p><p>Crackle!</p><p>The extremely condensed sword energy traversed through Young Elephant’s right arm through his gloves. As a result, his right arm instantly turned into blood mist amidst countless muffled explosions.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Next, the second sword attack directly pierced Young Elephant Lord’s throat.</p><p>Wide-eyed, the Young Elephant Lord was transported out of the secret realm.</p><p>“This!”</p><p>“This sword seems even stronger than Marquis Sword Snow’s Freezing Sword Point.”</p><p>“Is this really his progress from the past twenty days?”</p><p>If Dugu Jue and Lashan Mei’s improvement was shocking, a nd Marquis Sword Snow’s improvement was stunning, then Ye Chen’s improvement could only be called terrifying. It should be known that during ranking battles, Ye Chen’s sword moves were far less powerful than Marquis Sword Snow’s Freezing Sword Point. However, his sword seemed several times more powerful now, even stronger than Freezing Sword Point.</p><p>“What is this move called?” Marquis Sword Snow asked gravely.</p><p>“Congealing Water!” Ye Chen replied.</p><p>“Good move!”</p><p>Marquis Sword Snow could tell that this move of Ye Chen also contained the power of compression. However, unlike his eruption style, Ye Chen’s sword energy propagated through transmission. The same power, when applied differently, created two different sword moves.</p><p>Apart from the few big battles just now, the others didn’t make big improvements, and thus, blood rarely spilled in their exchanges.</p><p>In the final half day, Xu Jing also arrived. Half a day was too small of a time period, and the two didn’t even know when the time passed by. Eventually, the signs of secret realm closing appeared, and everybody was transported out one by one.</p><p>“Come back soon.” Xu Jing’s figure rapidly dissipated.</p><p>“I will.” Soon, Ye Chen’s body also disappeared.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>Amidst a huge spatial warp, everybody left the Life and Death Secret Realm.</p><p>…</p><p>Blood Sky Continent…</p><p>In the sky above Desolate Mountain Range, space unceasingly rippled as figures flew out one by one.</p><p>“Ye Chen!” Lashan Mei walked over to Ye Chen.</p><p>“Is something the matter?”</p><p>Lashan Mei said, “You’re not from Blood Sky Continent, and you killed Young Tiger Lord. His sect most likely won’t let you get away. You better get out of here and go back to True Spirit Continent. Each day you stay here, you’ll be in greater danger. Although a Life and Death might not kill you brazenly, you won’t escape some punishment at the very least.” Lashan Mei had obviously heard about Ye Chen killing Young Tiger Lord from other people.</p><p>But, the latter shook his head, “True Spirit Continent is billions of li away. It’s too late to escape now, nor do I have any intention to leave.”</p><p>Lashan Mei thought for a bit and then said, “If you don’t try it, how can you tell?”</p><p>“Beast Kings can travel through the void. Millions of li is nothing for them. If I escape, they will be more or less set to deal with me. I’d rather stay here and quietly see how the situation unfolds.” Apart from this reason, Ye Chen also wanted to protect the Eternal Sky Sect. If he escaped, Eternal Sky Sect might have to bear the brunt.</p><p>Who knew what kind of humiliations Eternal Sky Sect would have to go through in future!</p><p>Seeing Ye Chen’s determination, Lashan Mei knew that any more words would be useless. In his eyes, she could vaguely see an intense battle intent, and she wondered if it was just her misconception. “In that case, I’ll tell you about Sky Tiger Sect’s Beast Kings.”</p><p>“Sky Tiger Sect has two Beast Kings—Sky Tiger King, and the sect leader Blood Tiger King. Sky Tiger became a Beast King three hundred years ago. One time, he killed three king grade giant beasts on a star on his own. His battle strength is not something ordinary Kings can compare with.” Lashan Mei recounted the information she learned from the elders of her sect.</p><p>“Killing three king grade giant beasts!”</p><p>Ye Chen’s eyes constricted. There were demonic beasts on the mainland, but in the starry sky were giant beasts. These giant beasts couldn’t force their way in True Spirit World due to the restrictions of the three skies; however, they an possessed enormous strength. One on one, ordinary Kings had no chance against giant beasts. Some powerful giant beasts could even fight against titled Monarchs.</p><p>‘Sky Tiger King…I’m not his opponent. Don’t tell me I have to let Yuan Emperor out again?’</p><p>Hearing this information, Ye Chen’s heart sank. During the era of Battle King five hundred years ago, Sky Tiger King had yet to become a Beast King, so Ye Chen had no clue about his level.</p><p>“Blood Tiger King is a Beast King from five hundred years ago, and is also Sky Tiger King’s father. Of course, his battle strength is nowhere as frightening as Sky Tiger King’s, but he is still frightening. He had killed a giant beast on stars by himself once.”</p><p>As opposed to Sky Tiger King, Blood Tiger King did allow Ye Chen to let out a sigh of relief. Although he still had no confidence, he would not be in despair at least.</p><p>“I know you have an extraordinary battle strength, and you might be able to contend against some newly formed Kings. But, Sky Tiger King and Blood Tiger King are not one of them.” Lashan Mei had an extremely sharp intuition. She always felt that Ye Chen never used his full strength during the ranking battles.</p><p>“Can you tell me which Beast Kings does White Wolf Sect have?” Ye Chen asked.</p><p>“What? You also offended the White Wolf Sect?” Lashan Mei’s lips quivered as a stunned expression appeared on her face.</p><p>Ye Chen touched his nose and bitterly smiled in response.</p><p>“I really hope somebody comes to save you!” Lashan Mei no longer had any strength left to be astonished or worried, “White Wolf Sect has two Beast Kings as well—White Wolf King and the Giant Wolf King. The former is the sect leader. He is much weaker than the Sky Tiger King, but a lot stronger than the Blood Sky Tiger. Giant Wolf King became a Beast King two hundred years ago. It’s said that his advancement into Beast King level is quite strange. He didn’t enter the Life and Death realm through normal means. Thus, his battle strength is only around that of ordinary Kings. White Wolf King doesn’t even let him go to the starry sky, fearing that he will lose his life.”</p><p>‘Sky Tiger King and White Wolf King…I’m not their opponent. I guess Blood Sky Tiger is stronger than me, so I can only deal with Giant Wolf King. But even then, I’ll have to go all out.’</p><p>Lashan Mei’s information was quite crucial to him. At the very least, he’d a number in his mind now.</p><p>“It’s pretty bad. Just come to my Demonic Blade Sect!” Lashan Mei was quite fearful of Ye Chen’s fall. If he fell, this world would lose a peerless King. However, as soon as she said these words, she instantly regretted them. It was not that she didn’t want to help Ye Chen, but Demonic Blade Sect had its own rules. This action of Lashan Mei would be creating huge enemies for Demonic Blade Sect.</p><p>Not to mention, this was only her speaking. Her father and supreme elder would not allow her to make trouble as she pleased.</p><p>“That’s fine. I still have means to deal with this situation.”</p><p>Ye Chen was not stupid. If he really had no other choice, he would seek help from the Yuan Emperor. Even titled monarchs were apprehensive of the Yuan Emperor, let alone Sky Tiger King and White Wolf King. Of course, it would be best if he didn’t have to use Yuan Emperor. The latter was merely a sealed phantom, and every bit of power he used was that bit of power lost permanently. Thus, before entering the Life and Death Realm, Ye Chen had to use Yuan Emperor quite prudently.</p><p>“Hold on for a moment!”</p><p>Lashan Mei took out a jade slip and operated a Zhen Yuan. A letter entered the jade slip before she threw it, and it disappeared into the void.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>Right at this moment, the sky nearby suddenly split and a while-haired old man walked out. Demonic power gushed out of his body like torrents, seeming substantive.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
