It’s the Giant Wolf King!” Lashan Mei cried out.</p><p>Giant Wolf King was the supreme elder of White Wolf Sect, who became a Beast King two hundred years ago. Although there were some questions regarding the process of his advancement, he was still far above recently advanced Kings.</p><p>“It’s Giant Wolf Sect’s Giant Wolf King! What is he here for?”</p><p>“I’m afraid he is here for Young Wolf Lord.”</p><p>Many of Blood Sky Continent’s young experts had not left yet, and even the ones who were just about to leave stopped and looked at the sky. The white-haired old man’s gaze swept down below and finally landed on Ye Chen; his eyes were green and pupils erect.</p><p>“You killed my Lang-er?”</p><p>From the description of Young Wolf Lord, he recognized Ye Chen at a glance.</p><p>“If you’re talking about the Young Wolf Lord, then it’s me.” There was no point in denying at this moment. Thus, Ye Chen nodded faintly.</p><p>“Then, you should be aware of your crime!” Giant Wolf King roared.</p><p>“What crime?”</p><p>“Kid, you’re still being pig-headed. Life and Death Secret Realm is a place for everybody. You denied my kid the chance to obtain life-and-death stones by killing him, and you’re asking me what crime you’ve committed?” Giant Wolf King’s eyes squinted, giving off a vicious aura.</p><p>“He tried to kill me, so I killed him instead. If you want to argue about justice and reason, I can spell it out loud and clear.”</p><p>“If I say you’re at fault, then you’re at fault. You can’t wriggle out your way with words. I will only give you one option—come back to White Wolf Sect with me and suffer for a hundred years, then you’ll gain your freedom back.” Giant Wolf King offered no compromise as he determined Ye Chen’s punishment with a few words.</p><p>“Hundred years!” Lashan Mei’s face changed. Hundred years were enough to change everything and kill a genius’ talent and insight.</p><p>“My apologies, but even a year is too long.” Ye Chen shook his head.</p><p>“It’s not up to you.”</p><p>As a Beast King, Giant Wolf King could naturally not brazenly kill Ye Chen. His purpose was to capture the latter and bring him back to his sect. Hence, his body flickered, and he appeared before Ye Chen like a ghost. His right hand reached out while releasing boundless restrictive power, which condensed a ring of beastly power around the latter.</p><p>Imprisoning Palm Martial Arts—Imprisoning Body Palm!</p><p>The demonic power circle quickly closed in around Ye Chen, making him feel an unceasing pressure around his body. If he didn’t react immediately, this beastly power ring would render him immobile, causing him to lose all his battle power like a sitting duck.</p><p>“Sword Domain!”</p><p>“Congealing Water!”</p><p>At the moment of imminent peril, Ye Chen’s battle power erupted in the form o fhis Sword Domain, slowing down the speed of the ring and giving him a chance. At the same time, his right hand pulled out the Evil Shattering Sword and thrust out. With that, an inconspicuous, dim golden water-like sword light immediately pierced through the ring.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>The palm of Giant Wolf King and Evil Shattering Sword met, creating numerous spatial ripples and cracks.</p><p>“Such a strange sword art!”</p><p>Giant wolf King retreated with his hands behind his back. If one carefully watched, his right hand could be seen faintly trembling. Moreover, the cloth on his right arm also had a slight tear.</p><p>“A Beast King is Beast King.”</p><p>With a trace of blood leaking out of his mouth, Ye Chen flew off. As for the beastly power ring, it had already disintegrated.</p><p>In the first exchange, Ye Chen was slightly on the losing side.</p><p>“What!”</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>The numerous young experts on the scene wiped their eyes one after another, convincing themselves that they were seeing an illusion. Giant Wolf King was actually unable to suppress Ye Chen with his strength! Although he caused the latter to fly off, he himself had to retreat as well.</p><p>“His cultivation base has reached the third layer!”</p><p>Tie Kuangzun’s eyes shined. Even with the same stones, everybody’s rate of improvement was vastly different. Some people could quickly advance, but some hardly advanced even after months, and some never advanced. Although ten people received life-and-death stones at the end of the ranking battles, nobody could advance in only twelve days because the time was too short and one had to refine four stones to advance from the second layer to the third.</p><p>Evidently, Ye Chen had not revealed his cultivation base when he fought against Young Elephant Lord, and had fought using the second layer cultivation base.</p><p>“Well done, kid! No wonder you’re so arrogant! But, you’ve found yourself a wrong opponent this time.” Giant Wolf King’s hand turned to normal, but his voice turned ghastly.</p><p>“Giant Wolf King, you still have time to save yourself some face.” After exchanging a round with Giant Wolf King, Ye Chen had determined that the latter’s demonic power was not unbeatable, even though it was strong.</p><p>“You’re courting death! I’ve decided to take you back and inflict every kind of torture under the skies on you.” Giant Wolf King roared as beastly power violently surged out of his body, creating numerous cracks in the space.</p><p>“Hundred Wolf Stamps Heavenly Palm!”</p><p>Following his thrust of palm, hundreds of giant wolves charged out, and every single one of them contained an enormous beastly power. Only demonic beasts could squander their powers in this manner. If it had been a human King in Giant Wolf King’s place, every strike of this level would form a huge fraction of their total power unless they had cultivated for more than five hundred years.</p><p>Confronting the hordes of charging giant wolves, Ye Chen pushed his Sword Domain to its limits, which slowed the wolves down, and then thrust out. As a result, the space warped and compressed into a mirror.</p><p>“Bewitching Mirror Shattering! Shatter!”</p><p>Peng!</p><p>The mirror shattered, shattering all the wolves along with it.</p><p>Woosh!</p><p>Using sword steps, Ye Chen’s body shot forth like sword light and arrived before Giant Wolf King in a blink of an eye, piercing forth—Autumn Water Arts second style, Congealing Water!</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Giant Wolf King instantly opened a crack in the space, wishing to enter the void. However, under the pressure of Sword Domain, space had turned much stiffer, slowing down his speed somewhat. As a result, his Body Protective Beast Power was hit by Ye Chen’s sword and instantly pierced by the highly condensed sword energy.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>Spurting out a mouthful of blood, Giant Wolf King’s body was sent flying. Spinning in the air, he crashed into a huge mountain of the Desolate Mountain Range.</p><p>“Giant Wolf King’s defense is too strong. The sword energy of Congealing could only inflict a little injury on his body, and that too will be instantly healed.”</p><p>Others only saw Giant Wolf King’s miserable state, but Ye Chen was extremely clear that this attack did nothing to the other, regardless of how good it looked on the surface. Of course, this was something only he understood.</p><p>Every other young expert, including Lashan Mei, had their mouths wide open, unable to utter a word for a long time.</p><p>“He has…the strength to fight a Life and Death King!” Somebody finally exclaimed.</p><p>“Damn it! He was actually concealing his strength since the beginning. With this kind of strength, he could go through the entirety of ranking battles like a breeze. He could have easily won against anybody.”</p><p>What Ye Chen relied to injure Giant Wolf King was neither the Sword Domain nor Congealing Water, but the Bewitching Mirror Shattering. If he’d used this move during the ranking battles, who would be his opponent? Even his girlfriend didn’t seem that favored.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Rocks flew in the air in every direction as Giant Wolf King charged out of the mountain.</p><p>“Kid, you’ll die today!”</p><p>Giant Wolf King had never suffered such humiliation in his life. To think he, a majestic Beast King, was injured by a kid who was not even a Life and Death King. If this news spread out, his fame would drop to the bottom of the ocean. Such a humiliation aroused his killing intent; he would no longer care about any unwritten rules and kill Ye Chen.</p><p>Awoo!</p><p>Giant Wolf King roared at the sky while his body spun, turning into a twenty-five-meters-long, three-meters-high gray wolf. His two eyes were like scout lights, and his gaze condensed into a beam of light that radiated outward. His sturdy body, metal-like fur, as well as razor-sharp claws all screamed power.</p><p>Without moving from his spot, his toe claws swung, cleaving through the space.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>In the next moment, his entire being shot forward. Despite being of the size his body was, he seemed even quicker than before. His entire being disappeared, only leaving behind transparent gray silhouettes.</p><p>How could Ye Chen let him close in? Holding the Evil Shattering Sword with both hands, he chopped down. The space warped and contorted into a mirror, trapping the body of Giant Wolf King within.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>The mirror shattered and numerous scars appeared on Giant Wolf King’s body, raining down blood like a small river.</p><p>“Restore!”</p><p>Giant Wolf King operated his Undying Body, causing the river of blood to flow back in reverse and enter his body again. The scars on his body closed in rapidly, and his fur grew back again.</p><p>“Blood Severing Ghost Finger!”</p><p>The above scene came as no surprise to Ye Chen. If Giant Wolf King could be defeated so easily, he would not be a Beast King. Parting his two legs, his entire being turned chilly, not leaking a bit of his aura. It was as if his entire body had turned into a black hole, not letting out a single bit of his aura.</p><p>At that moment, an astonishing scene occurred: a ghastly figure in white long robe appeared behind Ye Chen. The ghost’s face was fuzzy. As it grinned, it revealed a huge black opening. The grim laughter teetered on the edge of reality and illusion.</p><p>With his right hand bent like a hook, Ye Chen slashed down.</p><p>Following his movements, the white-robed ghost figure extended its right hand. Before it even entered the void, it reappeared before Giant Wolf King and entered his body. With that simple movement, it plucked off a huge amount of blood Qi.</p><p>Awoo!</p><p>Giant Wolf King was terrified. What was this secret art? It could actually snatch his blood Qi!</p><p>Others didn’t know, but he was fully aware of his standing. Despite being a Beast King, he was not one who had advanced normally. The beast power in his body had not integrated with his blood and flesh, leaving behind a small portion of normal flesh. This was his weakness. However, this weakness was inside his body, and thus, Giant Wolf King didn’t care about it much.</p><p>However, this secret art of Ye Chen revealed this weakness of his. If not for this weakness, that ghost hand would not have been able to snatch his blood Qi and would have only grabbed some beast power. This was because there was no distinction between a Beast King’s flesh and beastly power.</p><p>Losing a huge chunk of his blood Qi, Giant Wolf King’s vital aura declined rapidly, and his body gave off a feeling of exhaustion.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
