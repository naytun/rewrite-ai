With your power, you would become a demi demon  king after speading three to five years in the demon ocean. By then, you  and I can go explore the world.”</p><p>“Yeah!”</p><p>Murong Qingchen nodded as she walked to the lady with determination.</p><p>A smile appeared on the lady’s face. Although the demi demon race  looked powerful, but there were just too little of them. Compared to the  whole human race, it was really nothing. With the hope of protecting  her own race, the lady was confident that she could train Murong  Qingchen into a top demi demon.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The lady in black waved his hand. The sky was full of black rain. All  of the sudden, it wrapped around Murong Qingchen and her within before  turning into a black light dot and disapear forever.</p><p>“Huh!”</p><p>The elder in balck looked at Ye Chen with a cold snare before disappearing as well.</p><p>“Luckily it is solved peacefully. Otherwise, I don’t think we have  much luck in that situation.” Yuan Emperor’s hologram forced a smile as  he said.</p><p>Let out a deep breath, Ye Chen seemed to try to push out all of the  negativity from the fact that Murong Qingchen had left. He turned out  and said to the hologram of the Yuan Emperor with respect: “Thank you,  senior for helping. Ye Chen will never forget this.” Although he did not  think the demi demon king came all the way here to kill him, but it  might be actually like Murong Qingchen said that he came to stop the  elder in black. But regardless, the hologram of the yuan emperor indeed  did help him a lot.</p><p>The hologram said, “You do not need to be so formal with me. Right  now, I am only a prop. Whowever gets me, then I will help whoever. As  long as he is not all that bad.”</p><p>“Senior, just like you said before, what is the real danger inside  the ruins of the True Water Palace? Do you mind elaborating?” Ye Chen  asked curiously.</p><p>“In the ancient era, the demon race and the human race fought for the  control of the lands, and the demon race lost. According to my  knowledge, the demon race was not originally from this world. They came  from the outer-realm world. And besides the demon race, there were other  races that invaded this world. But since there were not that many of  them and they were carefully hidden away so no one really knew about  them. This place was indeed destroyed by a powerful warrior from another  outer-realm race, and they seemed to have some kind of secret plans  going on there as well which turned the whole place into an extremely  dangerous place. I have entered within and explored around, but I failed  to find anything. And then, I joined forces with the other king  warriors and sealed it completely away, sinking it into the deep bottom  of the ocean so hoping that my decedents could find something and  reverse the dangerous situation.”</p><p>“The demon race is not from this world?” Ye Chen was rather  surprised. It was his first time knowing this kind of big facts. The  fact that the ruins of the palace can be traced back to another  outer-realm race made him think that this world he lived in now was not  as safe as he imagined so. The races from outer-realm seemed to be  plotting the invasion for this world.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, senior. As long as I have the power, I will promise  that I will reverse this dangerous situation. And I will not stop until I  do so.” Ye Chen said with determination.</p><p>The hologram chuckled, “No rush, that seal should be able to last for  a long while. Perhaps your power will not even be needed, unless there  is another force to break the seal, we will all be safe for a long  time.”</p><p>“So I still have a bit time.”</p><p>Ye Chen let out a breath, what he lacked the most was time.</p><p>Looking at Ye Chen carefully, the hologram said, “I can sense it that  you are one of the main roles that are pushing this era. As long as you  don’t die prematurely, you will be able to grow into someone huge. I  really miss those days. If we are born in the same era, perhaps we would  become competitors.”</p><p>There were not many people who can be appreciated by the emperor  himself. He was a man of the time back in the days. Even the people  nowadays still thought very highly of him, he was listed in the top  amongst the other top warriors.</p><p>“Senior, you are flattering me.”</p><p>Without reaching his realm, Ye Chen thought it would be best to be humble since it did not cost him anything to do so.</p><p>The hologram said, “Try to enter Life and Death Realm as soon as  possible. By then, you will realize that this world is so big and so  wonderful. Then you will have your whole life to explore, you will have  no moment of boredom.”</p><p>“I will.”</p><p>Ye Chen had a sharp look in his eyes.</p><p>“Alright, if it is not life endangering business, don’t use this  painting in the future anymore. I do not have that much energy left. For  my mind to enter the reality, it would slowly disappear as well.” As he  spoke, the hologram walked into the painting and froze back into a  water demon figure.</p><p>“Thank you!”</p><p>Ye Chen said that quietly internally as he put away the painting.</p><p>…</p><p>In the midair, Murong Qingchen seemed to have something on her mind.  The lady in black robe said gently, “Don’t think too much. You will meet  him again, sooner or later.”</p><p>Murong Qingchen did not say anything, she noddedly lightly.</p><p>The lady continued to say, “You are a member of the demi demon race.  You have the responsibility to protect the whole race. Do you know?  Although our race seems to be at peace, but the tension is always there.  With the slightest recklessness, our whole race might be killed. So no  matter if it was for him or for you or your whole family, you would have  to be stronger otherwise you would just blame yourself for not being  strong enough.”</p><p>Murong Qingchen could tell the exhasution in her voice, she asked,  “Senior, although our demi demon race is not welcomed by the human race,  but I did not think it would be that intense as you just described.”</p><p>“You have not reached my level yet, of course you do not know the  real danger. Let me ask you, if one day there are two sides, with one  being demon race and one being the human race, which side will you be  on?”</p><p>Murong Qingchen was surprised, “Isn’t the demon race gone already?”</p><p>“How would the demon race ever be extinct? They are not even from  here, they are from the outer-realm, from another world. When they come  to the true spirit continent again, then it would be the second demon  human world war. We as the demi demons would be stuck in between dancing  on thin ice.”</p><p>“Uh…after all these years, the demon race did not seem to have much  going on. It should not be that coincidental, right?” For Life and Death  Realm warriors, they had only one thousand years life span, Murong  Qingchen thought the chance of the demon human war happening within that  time span was rather low. It should be almost impossible.</p><p>“It is better to be careful than sorry. Plus, I am not saying all  that without any proofs. Anyway, you need to be more powerful as soon as  possible. Be so powerful that you become one of the top warriors of the  world. By then, you might have a saying of things, then you will have  the right to fight for survival for demi demon race.”</p><p>“Senior, which side would you pick?”</p><p>Murong Qingchen asked suddenly.</p><p>“Me!” The lady in black robes forced a laugh, “It does not matter  which side I pick. It matters only if they trust us or not. If we choose  the demon race, we will be always the superior; but if we choose the  human side, then they would still be mindful of us. If some evil people  decided to mingle within, then us as a race would be really in danger.”</p><p>“I will pick the human side.”</p><p>Murong Qingchen said with determination.</p><p>She grew up in the true spirit continent, she also carried half of  the human bloodline. No matter for which reasons, she would choose the  human side.</p><p>“The decision you make now would mean nothing.”</p><p>She stopped talking and sighed lightly. She hoped that day never came or at least not when she was still alive.</p><p>…</p><p>Without Murong Qingchen, Ye Chen no longer rode the flying puppet, he used his own zhen yuan and flew towards the south.</p><p>After half a month, Ye Chen stopped and looked down at the ocean  water. He mumbled to himself, “The Cold Iron City should be down there.”</p><p>With the center of his eye brow cracked open, the silver vertical eye  in between his eye brows looked down. In that silver world, the ocean  water became see through. There was a massive city under the ocean. It  was covered with a thick qi cover. Plenty people came and went all the  time.</p><p>Closed his verticle eye, Ye Chen took a deep breath, he flashed his body and dived into the water, swimming towards the city.</p><p>The city was very ancient. According to legends, the whole city had  walls made with thousand year old cold iron. Although it was not  something that valuable, but it was not that common either. And the  amount of irons used to make the city would be countless.</p><p>Choosing to enter the city, Ye Chen wanted to just visit and also  because he knew that there were a lot of different rare materials. He  thought he might be able to scavenge some extreme rank materials,  preparing for his extreme rank great sword in the future since he was  already not that far away from Life and Death Realm.</p><p>There were eight gates into the city. The other entrance were not allowed for the public to get in.</p><p>Ye Chen landed close to the north side gate.</p><p>Without extra examinations, Ye Chen had been let in directly.</p><p>The other cities would have popular restaurants. But inside this  city, what was popular was actually trading materials. Walking on the  street, vendors selling different materials were actually everywhere.  Some of the things had never been seen before.</p><p>This was Ye Chen’s first time there so he was not that familiar with  the whole place. He wanted to walk around and perhaps get some material  needed for the sword. He would not let go any mid rank and top rank  ones. The later stages of making the sword, the slower the process would  be. If he wanted to make a great sword then he would need at least some  kind of experience for it.</p><p>Approaching to the evening time, Ye Chen came to a restaurant.</p><p>“Have you heard? There was a business group that had been slaughtered  by the top third rob gang amongst the fifty gangs. All of the valuable  belongings had been taken. The men had all been killed brutally and the  women stolen.”</p><p>“This is no longer news. It had been around the city for the past  couple of days. All of the rest of the business would not dare to go out  the city anymore. They are hiring warriors right now, preparing  themselves before daring to go out again.”</p><p>“The fifty gangs indeed was one of the most mysterious power parties.  Any of the robbers came out would be a tyrant of the area.”</p><p>“It is not our business as long as we do not walk past the Blood Ocean.”</p><p>The second Ye Chen sat down he could hear that a lot of people were  talking about the Blood Ocean fifty gang. He did not care for it really  so he ordered some dishes and drinks and started to enjoy it on his own.</p><p>After dining satisfiedly, he walked out of the restaurant.</p><p>Left from the gate, a woman in blue walked past with him. The two of  them seemed to have sense the qi on each other. They froze slightly.</p><p>“This city is indeed one of the most influential city inside the  south deep ocean, having so many powerful warriors hidden so well  within.”</p><p>On the street, Ye Chen thought to himself.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
