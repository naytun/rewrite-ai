They didn’t think that Marquis Sword Star would be the one suffering a loss after the first exchange. His Seven Star Strike Technique was absurdly powerful. Except for Ye Chen and Marquis Sword Snow, they didn’t think any other sword artist could even take the first strike.</p><p>However, Ye Chen seemed like a person who always created miracles. He took the first strike like nothing and resisted the second strike without suffering any injuries, then broke the third strike with his vibrational sword arts; finally, he didn’t even let Marquis Star Sword execute his fourth strike. This moment also marked the beginning of the latter’s downfall.</p><p>They couldn’t help but admit that they had somewhat underestimated Ye Chen. His sword arts were indeed neither gorgeous like Marquis Sword Snow’s or murderous and majestic like Marquis Sword Star’s, but they were always efficient. One didn’t need to have beautiful or majestic sword arts if he could stop the other’s sword and hit back.</p><p>It could even be said that Ye Chen’s sword arts discarded anything that was unnecessary and represented the quintessence.</p><p>His sword dao was different from other people’s. Moreover, even though his sword arts were strong without a doubt, his insight and reactions were simply a cut above. If one wished to defeat him, one had to suppress him with absolute strength or some peerless move. All other means were useless.</p><p>Hearing Marquis Sword Star say that he was going to use his fifth strike, everybody’s gazes fell on Ye Chen, wondering how he would respond. Ye Chen’s swordplay didn’t need to be mentioned, but swordplay had its limits. Beyond this limit, regardless of how good one’s swordplay was, it didn’t matter. When the two challengers were equally matched, one had to rely on their aces to secure victory.</p><p>Moreover, one’s secret ace could secure victory even from the position of weakness.</p><p>‘Sure enough, he’s really learned the fifth strike!’ Lu Tiandu let out a sigh inwardly. Without even fighting, he knew that he was not Marquis Sword Star’s opponent. He wasn’t even sure about handling the fourth strike, not to mention the fifth strike.</p><p>“Seven Sword Strike Techniques, fifth strike…This freak! Fortunately, I’ve also activated my bloodline. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have a chance.” Young Elephant Lord smacked his lips.</p><p>“Fifth strike, huh?” Ye Chen’s brows creased. In reality, excluding the Bewitching Mirror Shattering, his battle strength was not much higher than Marquis Sword Star’s. After all, they two had differences in their cultivation bases; he was at the second layer of life-and-death chamber while his opponent was already at the peak of the third layer. There was a considerable difference in their Zhen Yuan, be it in quantity or quality. Moreover, there was a ten-year age difference between them, which meant that his opponent had ten more years to study sword arts.</p><p>Without using Bewitching Mirror Shattering, Ye Chen had no means of killing a peak level evil spirit. The recovering ability of peak level evil spirits allowed them to disregard most of the attacks. For example, Marquis Sword Star, Lu Tiandu, and the rest could exchange some blows with a peak evil spirit, but they would be ultimately ground to death. This was because they didn’t have anything that could instantly kill a peak level evil spirit.</p><p>‘Seems like I can only reveal the Sword Domain.’ Up to this moment, Ye Chen had only been faintly releasing sword domain, using its pressure to lock down opponents. He’d yet to reveal its true ability.</p><p>“Fifth strike, Meteor Fall!”</p><p>Marquis Sword Star’s figure shot across with a speed that could no longer be described with words. His entire being seemed more like an aurora travelling through the void in the cosmic space. Even more frightening was the fact that his entire being integrated with his sword even before he waved it. From his body, a starry force field erupted from his body. This force field didn’t come solely from his body, but was an additional part of Meteor Fall’s star power.</p><p>Marquis Sword Star had the confidence that this would be the finishing blow of this battle. Even if Ye Chen used his sword pressure on his body, the starry force field would counteract a large portion of it, and the remaining would not be able to influence his body or change his sword’s path.</p><p>“Dangerous!” Lu Tiandu’s neck hair stood erect as he unblinkingly stared. “This move is too frightening!” As a sword artist, his heart almost stopped. This might of this attack was such that even three of him would have no chance in the face of it.</p><p>“Harnessing the power of a star’s core with a single sword strike…worthy of being an ancient sword art.” Marquis Sword Snow’s eyes glittered, wishing to swap places with Ye Chen. He wished to see if his Freezing Sword Point could contend Marquis Sword Star’s fifth strike.</p><p>“It’s over!”</p><p>Lupus in Marquis Sword Star’s hand thrust out, brimming with power of impulse. The sword erupted with a light so bright as if a star had gone supernova.</p><p>Meteor Fall!</p><p>The light of a star’s death!</p><p>“This Marquis Sword Star is merely a step away from Life and Death Realm.” Ye Chen was moved. The dao of death in Meteor Fall clearly indicated that the former was not far away from Life and Death Realm. The realm of life and death naturally required one to comprehend life and death.</p><p>“Sword Domain!” Not daring to be careless in the slightest, Ye Chen operated Green Lotus Sword Arts and fully released sword domain.</p><p>“It’s useless.”</p><p>When Marquis Sword Star reached ten meters away from Ye Chen, time seemed to slow down. Lupus’ tip, which was erupting with blinding starlight, inched closer to Ye Chen.</p><p>‘Sword Rule!’ Ye Chen inwardly worded.</p><p>In the next moment, a horrifying scene occurred. Marquis Sword Star’s sure kill move actually was offset from its course. It seemed as if there was a rule surrounding Ye Chen, and this rule was under his control.</p><p>‘Impossible!’ Marquis Sword Star bellowed inwardly.</p><p>The flow of time seemed to quicken in this moment. Of course, it was merely a conception.</p><p>Woosh! Lupus hit air. The offset was so huge that it seemed absurd. Moreover, the moment he missed, the Evil Shattering Sword in Ye Chen’s pierced his throat. Due to the momentum, it continued to cut half his throat off, causing the blood to erupt like a fountain.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>Marquis Sword Star fell on the ground, sliding lifelessly. On the other hand, Ye Chen never moved from his spot.</p><p>“Sword Domain! It’s the Sword Domain!”: It was at this moment, somebody finally cried out.</p><p>“He actually possesses a sword artist’s territory—Sword Domain!” Marquis Sword Snow forcefully uttered in a lowered voice.</p><p>Sword Domain was the territory of a sword artist. Even amongst Life and Death Sword Kings, only a handful possessed the Sword Domain. A sword artist trained with his sword every day, every month, and every year. As a result, their body possessed a thick sword Qi. When they trained in sword cultivation arts, a resonance between the two would occur, which would never appear in usual times. Only when a sword artist could take their cultivation art to heaven grade or comprehend the sword dao, attaining a height of sword dao that would be even difficult to imagine, this resonance would occur and appear in the form of a Sword Domain.</p><p>Sword Domain could greatly affect a sword artist with no sword domain. As long as one was a sword artist, one’s hand or heart had a sword within, so one could not escape this influence. This effect was so deep-rooted because Sword Domain originally represented the quintessence of sword dao, and any style created using a sword would be affected by it.</p><p>Of course, to affect a sword artist with similar or more strength, one’s sword domain must contain one’s unique rule, which was the so-called Sword Rule. The birth of Sword Rule represented that one’s Sword Domain had entered preliminary stage, no longer being embryonic.</p><p>“Finally, there is an opponent I can’t see the win or loss of.” A frightening battle spirit awakened in the eyes of Marquis Sword Snow. If somebody were in the same chamber as him at this moment, they would have been stunned. Was this the same pretty-next-door-boy like Marquis Sword Snow?</p><p>As soon as Ye Chen revealed the Sword Domain, he became exponentially more frightening in others’ eyes. Sword Domain was almost like bullying. However, how could others imagine the accomplishments of someone capable of possessing Sword Domain in sword dao? Did every sword artist have the ability to take their cultivation art to heaven grade or reach new heights of sword dao?</p><p>Therefore, Sword Domain was basically the light of a sword artist’s talent.</p><p>Losing was nothing surprising; there was nobody to blame. Marquis Sword Snow could only blame his own achievements for not being enough.</p><p>“There is actually a person outside my Sky Sword Continent with a Sword Domain, and that too below the Life and Death Realm.” Inside the small chamber, Marquis Sword Star was stunned to his core. In the entire True Spirit World, all the known possessors of Sword Domain belonged to the Sky Sword Continent, a place that was considered to be heaven’s chosen for sword artists.</p><p>Or else, its name would not be Sky Sword Continent.</p><p>For Ye Chen to possess Sword Domain was simply an anomaly.</p><p>Huff!</p><p>Letting out a breath, Ye Chen sheathed the Evil Vanquishing Sword.</p><p>Truly speaking, the destructive power of Meteor Fall was not that much behind Bewitching Mirror Shattering, although it still would have fallen a bit short in killing a peak level evil spirit. This was because killing a peak level evil spirit was not just a matter of strength alone, but also the latter’s recovery ability. Meteor Fall was based on impulse. On the other hand, even if a peak evil spirit were to be impaled hundreds of times, it would not die.</p><p>If his Sword Domain had not developed a trace of Sword Rule, Ye Chen could have only won by using the Bewitching Mirror Shattering.</p><p>“I reckon he will only need a few years to enter Life and Death Realm after the Life and Death Secret Realm closes.” Before returning to his small chamber, Ye Chen threw a quick glance at Marquis Sword Star’s chamber.</p><p>The battle between the two was so stunning that it caused the dozens of twenty fifth round’s battles to lose all splendor. The people’s appetite had been greatly stimulated.</p><p>However, this situation didn’t last too long as two hot candidates once again met: Xu Jing and Lashan Mei.</p><p>Lashan Mei’s strength was frightening, but her opponent was Xu Jing. As a Golden Dragon, even Ye Chen had no idea how much strength she was concealing. However, he did know that the conclusion of this fight would be Lashan Mei being uprooted like a dried weed. Her Demonic Blade Arts were shattered by a single punch from Xu Jing, destroying the vibrational power alongside.</p><p>Ye Chen’s opponent for the twenty fifth round was Chu Zhongtian, and the result could be well imagined.</p><p>In the twenty sixth and twenty seventh round, there were a few good battles. In the twenty eighth round, Marquis Sword Snow faced Lu Tiandu, and of course the latter lost.</p><p>Marquis Sword Snow didn’t seem frightened of Ye Chen’s Sword Domain at all. In fact, everybody could see that his fighting spirit was soaring.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
