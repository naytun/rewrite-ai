As a ‘strongest’ half-step King herself, she knew well how strong a force field had to be in order to push them back. After all, Zhen Yuan of half-step Kings had already reached the pinnacle under Life and Death realm.</p><p>“Sure enough!” Huang Mei revealed a faint smile, as she had already experienced Murong Qingcheng’s force field. Of course, she didn’t put it in her eyes at that time. However, Murong Qingcheng’s current force field made even her gasp in surprise. It was most likely all thanks to the Shadow Armor.</p><p>“The Darklight King was actually forced back! What is happening?”</p><p>“Shadow Armor is Shadow Armor alright! No wonder she completely offended the Darklight King for this armor! This armor must be quite suitable for her original force field. Two force fields combined is not a simple addition, after all.”</p><p>“I wondered why she would dare to battle the Darklight King. Turns out she indeed has some skill.”</p><p>Everybody discussed in wonder.</p><p>“Hmph! Shadow Armor is a pseudo supreme grade armor. Let me see how long your Zhen Yuan can keep up.” The head steward’s eyes shined as he sneered.</p><p>“Sister-in-law, lady Murong’s forcefield is so powerful that even the Darklight King is forced back. Isn’t she invincible now?” Yue Bingxin happily said.</p><p>Yue Lingshuang shook her head, “A Pseudo supreme grade artifact is no small matter, but it’s too soon to declare her invincible. Unless she can continuously use her armor, the conclusion will still be the same. At most, she is buying some time.”</p><p>Darklight King was forced dozens of li back before being able to stabilize his body. The counterforce made his chest heave up and down; although he wasn’t injured, he wasn’t feeling so good either. His heart had almost been forced to its limit just now. After all, if one were charging forward with all his might and was forced back instantly for dozens of li, one might even die if the difference in cultivation bases was not much.</p><p>“Good, good!” The Darklight King muttered as he never expected his opponent to have this move. No wonder she never paid any attention to him before the Shadow Armor. She was after the Star Force Field of the armor all along.</p><p>“You really think I won’t be able to do anything just because you have this armor?” Darklight King stared her unblinkingly while he restored his condition.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng said indifferently, “These are your own words, not mine.”</p><p>“Hehe.” The Darklight King laughed haughtily, “The farther one is from force field, the lesser the impact. But, I wonder if you can handle my long range attacks.”</p><p>In the majority of the situations, the closer the distance, more powerful the attack would be. However, with Darklight King’s strength, even if attacked from a bit afar, it wouldn’t weaken his attack too much. But, her force field made him give up on instantly settling the fight nonetheless. He knew it was simply not realistic.</p><p>“Just bring it on.” Murong Qingcheng’s body flickered amidst purple lightning and her expression remained unchanged,</p><p>“Now, let me show you the difference.” The Darklight King had already resolved the uneasiness in his body. He approached Murong Qingcheng neither fast nor slow, as if feeling how close he could get without being in danger.</p><p>“Dark Devour!”</p><p>Seeing that Darklight King was not attacking, Murong Qingcheng took the initiative. Her hands rapidly formed seals and a dark rotating light sphere spawned near Darklight King. Then, it suddenly burst forth, wishing to swallow him whole.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The Darklight King immediately responded as soon as he felt some movement around him as he punched at the dark sphere with a roar.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>The sphere shattered without any resistance.</p><p>“Worthy of being a ‘strongest’ half-step King.” Seeing Darklight King taking care of the black sphere without breaking a sweat, Ye Chen sighed with some amazement. This black sphere was not some simple amalgamation of energies. To destroy it, one must have a frightening destructive power.</p><p>“Dark Flying Chop”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng naturally didn’t think that she could take care of Darklight King with a single Dark Devour attack. Her actions were only aimed to pull the distance between the two closer and affect his movements. With that, the disparity between the two was not high any longer.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>A shadow flickered as Murong Qingcheng suddenly charged at the Darklight King. Her hands formed two blades, creating a dense dark blade lighting the void.</p><p>“Damn!”</p><p>As Murong Qingcheng had expected, the Darklight King couldn’t focus enough under the influence of the Dark Force Field. When he wished to retreat, he would be pulled one step closer, and when he wished to approach, he would be pushed by the force. He could not even bring out fifty percent of his overall strength. If not for his solid foundation and frightening strength, he would have already been beheaded by Murong Qingcheng in this duration.</p><p>“This force field is too perverse! Darklight King is, after all, a veteran ‘strongest’ half-step King, but he is still being suppressed.”</p><p>“It seemed like Darklight King could easily capture her before. But now, it seems that it wouldn’t be so easy. Let’s see how the fight evolves!”</p><p>“Demonic Finger!” Murong Qingcheng’s figure stretched wide as she pulled some distance, then used her strongest finger move.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>Under the amplification of the Purple Flame Demonic gloves, the might of Demonic Finger reached a frightening degree. Not only her dark power became much stronger, a layer of purple flame appeared on it as well. Its luminous intensity warped the void, as if it could burn the void at any moment.</p><p>“You really think I can’t do anything to you?”</p><p>“Darklight Palm Arts; first style—Darklight Palm Imprint.”</p><p>Darklight King’s face turned red with anger. His rich Zhen Yuan frantically counteracted the effects of the Dark Forcefield while his fingers gathered together and the thumb lay at the edge of his palm’s hollow. He then pushed his palm at Murong Qingcheng, setting off a majestic aura.</p><p>The Dark Force Field warped as a resonant, flickering huge palm imprint cleaved through it, colliding with Murong Qingcheng’s Demonic Finger.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>A violent energy erupted like a volcanic eruption or a tsunami’s approach. Under the mighty shockwave, the ocean several thousand li in the surroundings trembled and roared, setting off enormous waves. The two figures simultaneously shot back, unable to resist the counter force.</p><p>“A fusion fire-earth profound martial skill?”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng’s face was pale. Even with the Dark Forcefield affecting Darklight King and Shadow Armor protecting her, her Zhen Yuan was soaring violently. This palm contained a frightening defense-piercing property. If she didn’t have her armor, she would have been crippled, if not dead.</p><p>Darklight King himself was not feeling too good either. He was unable to bring out his full strength as of itself, and adding the amplification provided by the Purple Flame Demonic Gloves, the price he had to pay was not cheap either.</p><p>“Ten minutes have already passed. You must have consumed a lot of Zhen Yuan while I haven’t consumed even ten percent!”</p><p>Darklight King was, after all, a ‘strongest’ half-step King. He soon adjusted his condition, then struck another palm imprint at Murong Qingcheng. This time, however, he made sure not to venture too close to her.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>Murong Qingcheng wordlessly issued another Demonic Finger, battling Darklight King from a distance. Bursts of shockwaves spread out in the sky.</p><p>“Murong, bring out your advantage of speed. Don’t think about concealing your identity as a perfect vessel demonic human.” Ye Chen sent a Zhen Yuan transmission to her.</p><p>Biting her lip, she faintly nodded. Speed was her innate demonic ability. If she contended against the Darklight King without making use of it, she would sooner or later run out of Zhen Yuan.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>A black Qi wave covering a huge expanse erupted forth as a pair of huge black colored bat wings appeared behind Murong Qingcheng. With a slight flap of the wings, she instantly disappeared, appearing directly above Darklight King.</p><p>“Soul Extinguisher!”</p><p>A dark light sphere appeared in her hand before she fiercely clenched it.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>A black light arc containing a soul attack spread out, shrouding the Darklight King and pushing him back. The pure offensive power of soul extinguisher was not too strong, which allowed him to not be injured. However, the soul attack it contained made him momentarily dizzy and unable to respond, instantly pushing him to a disadvantage.</p><p>“Black colored bat wings…She is a perfect vessel demonic human of the Demonic Human Clan!” Someone shouted in surprise.</p><p>The previous battle let everybody know that Murong Qingcheng was a demonic human, but nobody thought about perfect vessels. After all, perfect vessel demonic humans were extremely rare. Even the frightening Chaotic Demon Ocean had merely two.</p><p>However, as soon as her demonic bat wings were revealed, people had no trouble recognizing her identity, because her appearance was too similar to the records of perfect vessel demonic humans.</p><p>“Bingxin, what is happening?” Yue Lingshuang gasped as she looked at Yue Bingxin.</p><p>Yue Bingxin said, “I only knew that she is a demonic human, and not perfect demonic human. However, she indeed killed a lot of demonic humans in the Chaotic Demon Ocean. She is most likely not from Chaotic Demon Ocean.”</p><p>“Not belonging to Chaotic Demonic Ocean?” Yue Lingshuang sank into contemplation, then slowly said, “Seems like I’ve a lot to think about. Apart from Chaotic Demon Ocean, there is another place with Demonic Human Clan. Billions of miles away there is a demonic human clan on the True Spirit Continent. They might be from there.”</p><p>“Very good! You can be proud of forcing me to this extent. However, this is still far from enough. Witness my true strength!”</p><p>Rapidly retreating, Darklight King pulled quite a distance. Standing far away, the black light flickering around his body turned increasingly resonant. But unlike Murong Qingcheng’s demonic power, his Zhen Yuan gave off a feeling of burning the heaven and earth to a crisp.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>“Life and Death Chamber second layer!”</p><p>Yue Lingshuang’s eyes gleamed. Until now, Darklight King had fought Murong Qingcheng with Life and Death Chamber’s first layer. However, he was about to reveal his true strength.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
