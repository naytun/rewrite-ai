Mo Xiaotang was a disciple of the Extreme Heaven Martial School, so she followed them back as well. But before she left, she asked someone to tell Gao Zhiyuan that she would leave the school and come join Zhang Tian Martial School.</p><p>Ye Chen shook his head, knowing that he might have to go to Extreme Heaven Martial School.</p><p>Fighting off Ling Huyi gave confidence to the people of the Zhang Tian Martial School, and everyone’s spirits were lifted. For all these years, Zhang Tian Martial School had been treated so badly; not a day had been like this where they could regain their reputation.</p><p>Going back to his own mountain peak, Ye Chen cleared out his mind and began cultivating his profound while training his sword arts.</p><p>“My Bewitching Mirror Flower Destruction has been completed, and the Waning moon has reached a new level as well. I think I can spend more time on Spirit Sword now. Now that my fast profound has improved, my slow profound should have some improvement as well.”</p><p>Waning Moon focused on attacks, while Bewitching Mirror Flower Destruction was powerful in both trapping the opponents as well as attacking. Although the Spirit sword could not compare with the previous two, it had different drastic effects. If he ran into someone who had a similar power level as him, then the attack might be able to make a critical difference.</p><p>Extreme Heaven Martial School…</p><p>The whole martial school was shocked on seeing Ling Huyi and Yun Xiaoshui come back badly wounded. From the outer disciple to the leader of the school, everyone was utterly surprised. It was understandable that Yun Xiaoshui would come back wounded, since he was only at peak level Late Seas of Souls Realm. But, Ling Huyi as a real half step king warrior, and the very top of the kind, made everyone wonder who the person wounding him so badly could be. They suspected that it might be a group of them ganging up on him.</p><p>Inside the Extreme Heave Martial School palace, the leader and the Great Master were both not looking happy. They had learned what happened through the two, not having expected there to be this kind of a young half step king warrior, who even Ling Huyi could not compete with at all.</p><p>“You and him exchanged attacks before. Do you know what level his power has reached?” The Great Master was an elder with grey hair and a bulky body, as well as a strong aura. His eyes were like eagles and looked aggressive as he stared at Ling Huyi and asked the question.</p><p>Ling Huyi was the head disciple, and his position was not lower than the Great Master’s, just below the leader. Right now, he finally calmed down and said, “I have fought against the Heaven Tiger Beast Master before. In my opinion, he might not be his rightful opponent either. They might be able to break even at best.”</p><p>“Even he is not his rightful opponent?”</p><p>The leader was Ling Huyi’s second grandpa, named Ling Huhou. After hearing Ling Huyi’s analysis, he couldn’t help but frown. The Heaven Tiger Beast Master was one of the top ten beast masters. Its master school was even more powerful than the Iron Paw Beast Martial School in the Iron Blood Region. and the Tiger Beast of the Heaven Tiger Beast Martial School was the top martial genius of the beast race. He had already reached the peak level of the first Life and Death challenge, already ranked fifth on the Life and Death Realm warrior-to-be list. Ling Huyi had fought him last year; his Zhen yuan protective layer had been damaged by his one claw attack, which took him one month to recover.</p><p>“It is not possible! Tiger warrior did not use his full strength when he was fighting against you!” The elder in grey did not want to patronize Ling Huyi, but it was just the fact. The Tiger Warrior was the descendant of the Heaven Tiger Race, and his bloodline was very pure. Although he might not be able to compete with his ancestors, he was very horrifying nonetheless. Plus, his cultivation was already at peak level of first Life and Death Challenge. Even two Ling Huyi combined might still not be able to fight against him.</p><p>Ling Huyi nodded. “That was why I said he might be able to break even with him.”</p><p>As a martial genius, Ling Huyi had his pride. Indeed, losing to Ye Chen had embarrassed him, but he would not deny the latter’s power. In his opinion, even the Tiger Warrior might not be as powerful as Ye Chen.</p><p>So, if he wanted to ever beat Tiger Warrior or Ye Chen, he would have to reach the first Life and Death Challenge first.</p><p>Cough!</p><p>Ling Huyi’s wound was severe, so he puked out a big chunk of blood after talking.</p><p>“You go rest now.” Ling Huhou was worried.</p><p>“Uncle, I will close up and train until the beginning of the Life and Death Challenge this time.” With such a level of wounds, normal half step king warriors might not be able to recover within a couple of months fully. But, Ling Huyi had the whole school’s support and enough resources, so he had the confidence to heal within one month completely. In the remaining time, he would also try his best to reach the first level Life and Death Challenge. He had a feeling that the Life and Death Challenge trip would be the most powerful yet this time.</p><p>…</p><p>The mountain was looking green, surrounded by white clouds. On the peak of the mountain stood a blue figure without moving. The sword had been slashed in and out, sometimes fast and sometimes slow.</p><p>Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!</p><p>The flashing sword mark stood in the air before disappearing.</p><p>Not so far away, Gao Zhiyuan walked up step after step. He saw that Ye Chen was training, so he stood aside to watch him in awe.</p><p>“Now that I can leave a mark in the air now, I should not be far from breaking the space.”</p><p>Gao Zhiyuan had a new understanding of Ye Chen’s true power. He had been around and knew that it was not an easy thing to leave a mark in the air. It meant that each sword attack of Ye Chen’s had the power to break the space, which was totally horrifying.</p><p>“You are here!” Ye Chen put his sword back into the scabbard and turned around.</p><p>“Greetings, master Ye!” Gao Zhiyuan greeted Ye Chen formally with his hands formed into fists.</p><p>Ye Chen waved his hand, “You and I are about the same age, so no need for such formalities.” He studied Gao Zhiyuan and continued, “It seems like you are completely healed, and your cultivation has improved to peak level Late Sea of Souls Realm as well. Your training speed is faster than I had expected.”</p><p>“It is all thanks to master Ye’s healing pellets and Zhen yuan crystals.” The battle with Yun Xiaoshui had cost Gao Zhiyuan a couple of meridians. But luckily, Ye Chen was never lacking rare medicines. The couple of items he took out managed to heal Gao Zhiyuan completely in a short period of time. His cultivation had improved from the battle as well.</p><p>“The reason I had called for you was because I want you to tell me a little bit about the young generation inside the Blood Heaven Land.” The Life and Death Secret Realm would open in two months, so Ye Chen needed information about his potential opponents.</p><p>Gao Zhiyuan knew he was referring to the group of top martial geniuses who were aged below 50 years, so he cleared his thought and said, “Inside the Blood Heaven Land, there were five people who have entered the Life and Death Realm warrior-to-be list officially, but that was 9 years ago. Right now, the top warriors inside the land are the top eight beast warriors and the four demons.”</p><p>“Hm?” Ye Chen flicked his eyebrow.</p><p>Gao Zhiyuan explained, “Amongst the eight beast warriors are five beasts and three demi beasts, and there are one demi demon and three humans among the four demons.”</p><p>“Tell me about the eight beast warriors first.”</p><p>“The leading warrior is the elephant beast warrior from Battle Elephant Martial School, ranked third in the list. He carries the Ancient Battle Elephant’s bloodline and possesses an endless godly power. With his physical strength alone, not many people are his rightful opponent. According to the rumors, his power seems to have reached beyond a million pounds.”</p><p>“Indeed impressive!”</p><p>Ye Chen could not help but think of Yan Fengfeng, who was also one of the most powerful beast warriors. Her bloodline was the purest Blue Phoenix bloodline. Although the other beast warriors might carry some pure bloodline as well, the blood had been thinned down generations after generations. It would be very rare to encounter a pure bloodline descendant.</p><p>It was just like the demi beasts. There were billions of demi beasts out there, but actual beast families were barely any. The rest of them were just normal “people” who had a slight hint of demi beast bloodline. There weren’t too many demi beast family members on the true spirit continent either. But, people who carried the demi beast bloodline would be billions and billions out there.</p><p>In fact, there was barely any difference between demi beasts and humans now. It would not be wrong to call the demi beasts with the lowest percentage of bloodline humans.</p><p>The reason the Elephant Warrior was able to be ranked in the leading position among the eight was because his bloodline was very close to his ancestor’s. Ye Chen knew that the beasts could use their talent and special tricks to be in contact with their roots. Once they succeeded, they would be one of the true members of the Hundred Beasts. And by then, they would have no bloodline other than the one they carried.</p><p>“The second in the ranking is the Snake warrior. He is the disciple of the demi beast family the Nine Headed Snake family. His Nine Head Snake bloodline has been completely activated, ranked seventh in the list. He has been competing with the Elephant warrior for decades.”</p><p>Em? There was a Nine Head Snake Family here in the Blood Heaven Land as well?</p><p>Ye Chen froze a bit.</p><p>He had personally trained two Nine Head Snake family members—Wang She and Wang Mei. Wang She had almost activated his Nine Head Snake bloodline as well, just slightly lacking in terms of cultivation. Ye Chen did not expect to hear another family here in this land after knowing the only one in his home land was extinct.</p><p>This family must be a hundred times more powerful than the one back at the True Spirit Continent, since Wang She’s family was just a rank 9 family back then.</p><p>“The warrior ranking third is the Eagle warrior. He has not entered the list yet, and he has only emerged in the recent years.”</p><p>“Tiger Warrior is ranked the fourth, and is twenty-third on the list.”</p><p>“The remaining four demon warrior are the Shark Warrior, Cougar Woman, Wolf warrior, and Butterfly Woman. They are all very powerful just like the Eagle warrior, appearing in the recent years.”</p><p>Hearing his details, Ye Chen nodded in response. The older generation of martial genius should be the five that were in the list, and the remaining must have newly appeared.</p><p>“Master Ye, I could not see through your power. But, in my opinion, only the elephant warrior and the snake warrior would be worthy of your attention amongst the beast warriors. The others would not be your rightful opponents.”</p><p>Ling Huyi was one of the four demons, and they were just as famous as the eight beast warriors. If even Ling Huyi was not Ye Chen’s opponent, then the rest of them would not have that big of a chance.</p><p>With those thoughts in mind, Gao Zhiyuan wondered about Ye Chen’s background, since he looked so young that he must not be older than thirty, but seemed to have an unlimited power.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
