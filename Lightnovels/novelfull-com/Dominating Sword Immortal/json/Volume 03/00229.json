A bright yellow halo shot out through the gap between his fingers. It twisted drastically before it was compressed. Eventually, it condensed into an unreal shadow of a bright yellow mountain, its intense aura spreading out and covering the whole bedroom.</p><p>Letting go of that mountain shadow, Ye Chen let out a breath, “I have finally mastered the first movement of the Five Mountain Condensing. Now I just have to train the second and the third movement.”</p><p>Although each movement of the Five Mountain Godly Fist Art was more powerful than the last one, judging on the difficulty for training, the first movement would be the hardest. If it were not trained well, then the rest of the movements would be less powerful, merely a formality. Therefore, only if one trained the first movement to its extreme would the rest four movements be more and more powerful and unstoppable in a true sense.</p><p>“With the Five Mountain Godly Fist combined with my body strength, I will not have to worry about top rank Earth Realm martial skills in close combat.”</p><p>On this true spirit continent, body boosting martial arts were really rare. There were a lot of Earth Realm manuals in the Sky Cloud Martial School, but the good body boosting martial skills were only of the top rank Mortal Realm rank. There were rarely any Earth Realm body boosting martial skills in the other martial institutions as well. Being able to find a low-rank Earth Realm Pure Jade Body Boosting Martial Skill manual was pure luck for him. And it was indeed that manual that opened a new path for him in training. Ever since he had mastered the fifth movement of the Pure Jade Body Boosting Art – King Kong Jade Body, the pure body strength of Ye Chen had increased twice of its original level, reaching almost fifty thousand pound power. Compared to the other warriors with the same cultivation, he was definitely one of the best. With his Five Mountain Godly Fist Art now, there was indeed no reason for him to worry about top rank Earth Realm martial skills.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! …</p><p>Someone was knocking on the door. Wang Snake’s sound was heard, “Brother Ye, the Snake Island is almost here.”</p><p>“Oh! I will be right out.” Ye Chen straightened his clothes a little bit and walked out of the bedroom.</p><p>On the front deck of the boat...</p><p>Ye Chen looked over into the distance. An island appeared in his sight, shaped like a snake piling up its tail. There were four levels on the island; the first level was the harbor that was filled with boats and people coming and going. The second and third level were occupied with a lot of residential buildings, hotels, restaurants, shops and a lot of houses; as for the fourth level, it was its own different world, covered by a huge valley. In the middle of the valley was a weird-looking mountain, which was the highest part of the mountain.</p><p>“The Wang family in the Star Region Lake knows how to live.” Ye Chen estimated the snake island being hundreds of miles, and since the Wang family had the power and wealth to take over most of the space and a huge area of the lake, they must be really powerful.</p><p>It was also Wang Snake’s first time being on the island. He said in surprise, “They are the main family after all, they do seem fancier than us.”</p><p>Ye Chen said, “Once you reach the Snake Island, they should not dare to kill you out in public, but it would not hurt to just be cautious. Don’t be reckless.”</p><p>“Yah, you are right. But once I inherit the special power, then I will have nothing to worry about.”</p><p>Ye Chen smiled. He would be lying if he said that he was not curious about the special power of that Wang family in the Star Region Lake since he could not imagine what kind of power it would be that allowed the person be able to increase the power without training days after days according to his knowledge.</p><p>The boat had soon reached the dock, and all of the passengers got off the boat one after another.</p><p>There were eight giant doors from the first level to the second, and each one of them was more than ten meters high and twenty meters wide. What connected to the giant doors were high stairs. Once one reached the top, there would be the second level.</p><p>There were four giant doors from the second level to the third. A lot of wealthy businessmen and some powerful warriors had entered there, rarely any normal people finding their way up there.</p><p>Outside of that only huge door from the third level to the fourth, Ye Chen pointed at the fancy-looking restaurant across the street and said, “I am going to stay in this hotel nearby. If you guys hear about the Blood Sun Flower, just come tell me. If I am not here, you can also leave a message with the servant there.”</p><p>Zhou said respectfully, “Warrior Ye, don’t worry. I will try my best.”</p><p>“Brother Ye, we will go up now.” Wang Snake was also very grateful. He knew that he would not be able to make it to the Snake Island without Ye Chen. He promised to remember this favor and never forget in his whole life.</p><p>Ye Chen nodded.</p><p>After saying goodbye to Ye Chen, the two arrived in front of the main gate. After being verified by the guarding warriors, someone ran up to notify the management. Soon, a middle-aged man who was seemingly of high rank came down to welcome them.</p><p>Seeing that they had entered the house safely, Ye Chen stopped looking and walked into the restaurant.</p><p>On the third floor of the next restaurant, two people were standing on the well-furnished balcony, looking down. One of them was short but skinny, was only half a human size, seeming to be in his sixties. He was sending out dangerous vibes. The other person was tall and slim, his skin pale, eyes narrow and shining with a cold light. He was a teenager in his twenties.</p><p>“Ping’er, Mo and Master Liu have both failed.” The short elder said with a smokey voice.</p><p>The teenager sneered, “Useless losers. How can they screw up little things like this?”</p><p>The elder touched his jaw and said with a chuckle, “The purity level of the bloodline for Juan’er was five headed snake. Including him, the two accesses to the forbidden area are full now. Ping’er, what do you want to do now?”</p><p>Hearing him, the teenager was furious. Although he was the eldest son of the Wang Family, his purity level was only of a four-headed snake. If it were in the old days, the two accesses into the forbidden area would definitely include him. But right now, there were suddenly two family members that had five-headed snakes, which put him in a bad spot. He was clear about the benefit of inheriting the power of their bloodline. The forbidden area of the Wang family opened up every fifty years. The people who had entered it were his eldest grandpa and third grandma. According to rumors, when they had entered, they were only Late Condensing Reality Realm warriors. But once they came out, they had reached Early Clasping Yuan Realm already. Furthermore, because of the bloodline, they were able to fight against warriors with higher cultivation. In other words, they had no opponents in their level of cultivation.</p><p>“There are still ten days until they open the forbidden area. Within the next ten days, we will have to try everything to kill him. As long as they do not have enough evidence, even if the others know it was me who killed him, they would not be able to do anything, since the dead would be already dead while the alive ones would still have to carry on living.” The teenager said evilly.</p><p>The short elder took a glance at the restaurant that was right next to theirs and said with a scary voice, “That young man who had come with them seemed to be quite powerful.”</p><p>“Fourth Grandpa, I do not want to see that person ever again.”</p><p>“Don’t you worry. If you don’t say it, I will still kill him for you. Plus, your third grandma is also against this. She wants you into that forbidden area. A member of the branch family wants to inherent the bloodline power? He is asking for death.”</p><p>The teenager sneered. In the family of Wang, not everyone agreed with letting branch members into the forbidden area. At least, the third granny who had great reputation in the main family was on his side.</p><p>The night had slowly arrived.</p><p>Inside the guest room of the hotel, Ye Chen was reading the Five Mountain Godly Fist Art, trying to figure out the second movement.</p><p>On that long pathway to the guest rooms, a servant was carrying dishes and drinks on a tray, walking towards Ye Chen’s room.</p><p>All of a sudden, a short human figure appeared and blocked his way, signaling him to keep quiet.</p><p>The servant looked, then exclaimed in surprise, “Fourth master! What brings you here?”</p><p>The short human figure was indeed that short elder who was chatting with the teenager earlier, who was also the fourth brother of the leader of the Wang family. He warned the servant, “Talk normally later. You have no need to worry about the rest.”</p><p>“I understand.” The servant was worried after all. Seeing the fourth master talking like that, he knew that he was planning to kill the guest in the guest room. But he was only a normal mortal trying to survive on this Snake Island. He would not dare to do anything or say anything that he was not told to.</p><p>Walking over to Ye Chen’s guest room, the servant knocked on the door.</p><p>“Warrior, I have brought you your food and drinks!”</p><p>“Come in!”</p><p>Ye Chen’s voice was heard.</p><p>Shiii!</p><p>Opening the door, the servant walked in while being frightened because the short elder was almost glued to his shadow. If one did not pay attention, one would not be able to sense anything.</p><p>“Put down the food and drinks, lean over and ask him what else he needs.” The short elder’s voice had been compressed into a thin line and poured inside the servant’s ear.</p><p>The servant was stressed out about the situation. He shivered as he walked into the guest room and stopped in front of the bedroom, “Warrior, what else do you need?”</p><p>“Nothing more.” Ye Chen was still training.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>Right then, the short elder jumped out from the shadow. He waved his hand, as three pitch-black zhen qi snake burst out, attacking towards Ye Chen from an unpredictable angle.</p><p>Putting away the manual in his hand seemingly slowly but actually extremely fast, Ye Chen turned his head as he sneered, “I have been waiting for you. Break!”</p><p>He threw out a punch, and the bright yellow mountain shadow appeared. All of a sudden, that brutal aura had covered the whole room, and it spread over to where the short elder was standing.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The whole restaurant that covered a large area started to shake drastically. The huge pitch-black snake disappeared completely.</p><p>“Brat, not bad.”</p><p>The short elder laughed as both of his hands waved in the air. Countless pitch-black snakes appeared out of nowhere, surrounding Ye Chen.</p><p>“Separate!”</p><p>Ye Chen shook his body as human figures shot out from his body, his body already breaking out of the attack and appearing in front of the elder. A fist attack had also been thrown towards the elder.</p><p>“So fast!”</p><p>The elder was shocked, creating layers of zhen qi blockage in front of him. In the middle of the blockage, there was qi flow that was snake-shaped, twisting and crumbling.</p><p>Paw! Paw! Paw!</p><p>The zhen qi blockage looked like it was made of paper. After being punched by Ye Chen, it had been broken layer after layer. Eventually, it was blocked by the short elder’s arms.</p><p>Although it had been blocked, its horrifying power had still gone through, which had blown the elder all the way back to the door.</p><p>Crack! The short elder smashed through the wall and somehow landed on the streets outside of the restaurant.</p><p>Extending his body, Ye Chen followed up.</p><p>In that broken guest room, the servant’s face went extremely pale. He thought to himself. ‘Crap! If the fourth master knew something went wrong in the restaurant, it would be me that he would blame.’</p><p>The third level of the Snake Island was very busy. Even if it were late at night, it would still be crowded with people and the light would still be bright as the sun.</p><p>The short elder had burst out of the wall and landed on the street involuntarily, which had disturbed a lot of people, including the warriors of Wang family who were on patrol.</p><p>“Fourth master, what happened to you?”</p><p>“Who dares to make a mess in the Snake Island? Surround the place!”</p><p>“Being able to blow the fourth master away, he must be so powerful. Better notify the powerful warriors of the Wang Family! Ask them all to come, make sure we will be able to kill this person for good.”</p><p>All the warriors that were on patrol had just made a movement when Ye Chen in blue had jumped out, throwing out a punch right onto the short elder. Its brutal fist power seemed to have frozen space and time. The yellow mountain shadow expanded rapidly, covering the frightened short elder, intending to punch him to death.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
