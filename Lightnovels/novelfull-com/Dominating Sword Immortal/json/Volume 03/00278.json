Those eight blade light had no pattern to help predict them. They were like eight wild horses running towards eight different destinations that no one could really predict.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Tuo Baku avoided five blade lights, but the remaining three were unavoidable for him anymore. So he had to take them head on. He roared, and as his body backed out, he threw out an uppercut punch towards Yan Chihuo in the air.</p><p>Of course, it was not a normal uppercut. Under Yan Chihuo’s feet, a dragon-shaped Qi power appeared out of nowhere, blowing him into the sky. The sharp claws and teeth had almost torn apart his protective zhen Qi layer. All the people in the audience seating area could not help but be shocked. That attack did not seem to be that powerful, but it would be extremely hard to block out. No one had expected that Tuo Baku had still some ace attack hidden away. They could not figure out why he did not use it on Ye Chen.</p><p>Tuo Baku made a face after landing on the ground. He surely wanted to use it on Ye Chen, but people who had not fought against Ye Chen before would not be able to understand how horrifying he was. It was almost impossible to lock his real body down. Up until now, there was no one who really hit Ye Chen’s real body before.</p><p>In his opinion, the most horrifying part of Ye Chen was nothing else but that inhuman control over his power. Competing martial techniques with him would be basically suicidal.</p><p>\"Fire Dragon Cut!\"</p><p>When Yan Chihuo was still in midair, he waved his blade down at Tuo Baku. The red-colored blade Qi exploded in the air, turning into a sharp fire dragon attacking towards Tuo Baku.</p><p>Tuo Baku lifted up his palm that had turned greenish-black. Suddenly, he placed it at the head of the Fire Dragon. That powerful palm power made the fire dragon start to crack open.</p><p>\"Break!\"</p><p>Letting out his palm power, he caused the fire dragon to shatter.</p><p>\"Fire Cut!\" Seizing that window of opportunity, Yan Chihuo appeared instantly in front of Tuo Baku, waving his long blade upwards. Not only had it blown away Tuo Baku, but it had also sparked the dark red flame which landed heavily on Tuo Baku’s body. The rest of the power had fallen from the sky like a rain of fire.</p><p>Tuo Baku’s greenish-black layer seemed to be ready to melt down. He did not dare to waste time and threw out another uppercut punch at Yan Chihuo through the burning flame.</p><p>After what happened before, Yan Chihuo had already been prepared for this attack. He held his long blade backward, and he hit the ground along with that burning flame.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The dragon-shaped qi clashed against the blade light, both shattering eventually.</p><p>\"I want to see how you are going to block this blade attack out!\"</p><p>The long blade stabbed into the platform, and Yan Chihuo did not pull out instantly. His wrist pushed again, and the power cracked the ground. The sky-shooting blade light blew Tuo Baku hundreds of meters away, and he eventually landed heavily on that dark blue light wall, bringing up waves of patterns.</p><p>But before this, Tuo Baku had also returned an ace attack. That powerful fist power had landed on the protective zhen Qi layer, which had boiled up Yan Chihuo’s Qi and blood, making sure that he was no longer calm.</p><p>The result was out. Tuo Baku had lost this battle, but he was only slightly wounded. His shockingly powerful defense was once again surprising for most of the audience.</p><p>The sixty-fifth round had officially finished. After resting for an hour, the sixty-sixth round had begun.</p><p>This round would contain the battles between Bing Ling and Gu Youyun, and Yan Chihuo and Mo Yan.</p><p>Gu Youyun lacked experience after all, and even with the exclusive martial arts from the Stone King – the Stone King Body Protective Fist Art, she was still unable to block out Bing Ling’s Ice Break Fist. After exchanging thirty rounds of attacks, she was eventually beaten by Bing Ling with one punch.</p><p>As for the battle between Yan Chihuo and Mo Yan, there was barely any surprises. Yan Chihuo had won completely.</p><p>The following eighteenth battle attracted extra attention. The contestants were Murong Qingcheng, who was extremely popular, and Li Daoxuan, who just lost to Ye Chen.</p><p>Right then, the battle had already reached its most critical moment. The result depended all on that moment.</p><p>\"Silence!\"</p><p>Facing Murong Qingcheng’s Sky Demon Power Field and the Sky Demon Palm attack, Li Daoxuan was having a rough time. No matter how powerful his sword arts had gotten or how incredible his sword intent was, it was still almost impossible to break through Murong Qingcheng’s defense line. He had either been messed up his rhythm or faced that horrifying attack – Power Field Cut. The truth was that Murong Qingcheng definitely belonged to the type that was the hardest to fight against among the young generation, because no matter if it was Sikong Sheng, Yan Chihuo or Ye Chen, they were all fighting with actual martial art movements. But martial arts like the Sky Demon Great Art and the related attacking style were extremely rare.</p><p>After fighting for a long time, Li Daoxuan finally found a weak spot. He then performed his Silence attack.</p><p>Pop!</p><p>Murong Qingcheng’s reaction was still way too efficient after all. While the Power Field Cut was still performing itself, it was hit by the sword light.</p><p>The protective zhen Qi from the Sky Demon Power Field started to twist. Murong Qingcheng’s face went pale for a second as she backed out few steps. What was more out of the blue was that when the sword light had not yet performed its power yet, Murong Qingcheng had already used the power of her Sky Demon Power Field and diverted that sword light, making it miss its original target. Otherwise, after being hit by that sword attack, it would not be just a changed color on her face, but more likely a serious wound.</p><p>\"No need to fight more. I lost!\" This time, she was not able to wound her opponent, but it did not mean that she would be able to do so the next time. So Murong Qingcheng decided to give up.</p><p>Li Daoxuan let out a breath. He forced a laugh and said, \"I really did not want to fight against you.\"</p><p>The two exclusive martial arts from the Sky Demon Martial School were famous for their trickiness. For example, Mo Yan’s Sky Demon Art gave him Sky Demon eyes, which allowed him to see through weaknesses. However, Mo Yan did not have the chance to perform its true power. Then there was the Sky Demon Great art, which came with the Sky Demon Power Field. It was even trickier than the Sky Demon Eyes. Everything within the ten-meter radius would be in the blasting zone of the Power Field. It could also be spread out by palms to a very far distance. It was definitely a nightmare for most of the normal warriors. Even warriors within the same cultivation would have a rough time taking it on.</p><p>…</p><p>\"The twenty-fouth battle, Ye Chen versus Lin Yun!\"</p><p>The fourth pair of opponents from the top young warriors were indeed Ye Chen and Lin Yun.</p><p>Lin Yun had lost to Murong Qingcheng, but it was more or less because of his recklessness. If he did not regulate himself with ten movements, he would not have to perform all those ace attacks in such a hurry, which left him no chance of fighting back.</p><p>Of course, no matter whether Lin Yun had the power to beat Murong Qingcheng or not, Ye Chen was not really bothered. Under the same condition, Lin Yun could barely make any impact on Ye Chen after all. It was not only because of the gap in their cultivation, but also the fact that Ye Chen was just not threatened by Lin Yun and those types of warriors.</p><p>\"Let’s do this!\" With the Star Scar sword in his hand, Ye Chen stood a hundred meters away from Lin Yun.</p><p>Lin Yun looked extra gloomy. After losing to Murong Qingcheng, he had become much more cautious and careful. However, Ye Chen right now made him sense a lot of pressure. Before the last nine rounds of battles, he had never thought about Ye Chen as a deserving opponent, and thought that Ye Chen was overrated.</p><p>\"Wining against Li Daoxuan was not that big of deal, lose now!\" The Sky Fall Kill needed the Sky Fire Four Spear activated as preparation. Lin Yun flew out with his iron spear in his hand. The dark red flame twisted as it attacked towards Ye Chen, turning into waves of fire midair, looking extremely brutal.</p><p>Ignoring that aggressive looking fire wave, Ye Chen extended his body and shot into that fire wave. When his body was still in the air, he took out his Star Scar Sword. The dark colored sword light flashed once before disappearing, bisecting the fire wave completely.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
