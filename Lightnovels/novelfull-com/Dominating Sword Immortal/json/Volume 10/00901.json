Although it was not much, it was enough for a few sword moves. Seeing the masked man and the other three try to escape, Ye Chen unsheathed the Sky Scorpio Sword and issued the Bewitching Mirror Shattering attack.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>The four escaping Kings were actually forcefully pulled out of the void, trapped in the mirror. Bewitching Mirror Shattering aroused from king grade Zhen Yuan finally displayed the true might of space profound. Even the masked man with a three star battle strength couldn’t escape.</p><p>Kacha!</p><p>The purple mirror shattered. Apart from the masked man, the other three instantly died. Of course, the masked man’s condition didn’t fare too well either. One of this arm and leg were slashed apart from the spatial splinters and turned into blood mist.</p><p>“Escape!”</p><p>The masked man was appalled. Ye Chen’s battle strength was even stronger than he’d imagined. The latter had even pulled him out of the void, so how could he be still the other’s opponent?</p><p>A thunder fire erupted from his body and his entire being into thunder fire before he again escaped in the void.</p><p>“Not right!”</p><p>“Something is wrong!”</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>Killing Ironarm King, Beard King, and Gray Bird King as well as heavily injuring the masked man in one strike didn’t evoke any feelings in Ye Chen. What he felt was that he’d missed something, something of grave importance, much more important than killing the masked man. Therefore, he allowed the masked man to escape, and instead began to ponder and consider all angles.</p><p>“Killing them has nothing strange about it. So, what went wrong before that?”</p><p>“Right, I’ve been undergoing a calamity.”</p><p>“Apart from the thunder calamity and the first half of wind fire calamity, everything seems to be fuzzy. They are indistinct to the extent that I can’t recall anything except that I’ve succeeded in passing the calamity!”</p><p>“Lack of details?”</p><p>“I can sense that I have passed the calamity, but I can’t feel the particulars of my body at all. The will of heaven and earth can imitate other things, but it can’t imitate myself, because it’s not me. It can only create transformations according to the information in my mind. How can I not have any impressions of passing the wind fire calamity and Yuan calamity?”</p><p>“Heart Demon!”</p><p>Lightning flashed in Ye Chen’s mind, and a growl escaped from his mouth.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>Amidst his surging Sea of Soul, Ye Chen awoke.</p><p>Pain!</p><p>His first feeling was an extreme pain. At this moment, he was still undergoing the fire calamity, still surrounded by heavenly fire, which was rubbing against his inner muscles and arousing his pain nerves. He spread out his soul power and saw that the masked man and the other three were still alive and coldly watching him.</p><p>‘What a frightening heart demon!’ Ye Chen couldn’t help but feel his scalp being a little numb.</p><p>The heart demon of other people was single-layered, but his was two-layered. Once one passed the heart demon, they would somewhat relax and let their guard down, allowing the deeper heart demon to avail itself and turn the fake into reality. If Ye Chen’s will had not been strong enough to preserve his spirit, this second layer of heart demon would have been the end of him. His body would have been burnt into nothingness by the fire calamity.</p><p>“Terrifying!”</p><p>Compared to the Doomsday Dragon of the thunder calamity, the heart demon was not majestic. The spectators couldn’t see its deceit at all, but it was ten folds more dangerous than the former. Even Ye Chen couldn’t help but feel a bit begrudged. If it had been someone else, they would have fallen long ago.</p><p>Recalling the details, Ye Chen felt that him losing consciousness was the moment of the heart demon’s assault.</p><p>Even the poison wind couldn’t make him lose consciousness, and the burning pain from the heavenly fire was merely a bit stronger than the former. It couldn’t have made him lose consciousness.</p><p>‘Is this a delusion or not?’ Ye Chen couldn’t help but think.</p><p>“Seems like my heart is erratic. The second layer of heart demon has made me paranoid. As long as my will is strong and unwavering, it doesn’t matter if it’s a heart demon, whether it’s the truth or fake. No matter the external transformations, as long as my body remains unchanging, the heart demon will have no opportunities.”</p><p>With a bitter smile, Ye Chen regained his composure. His eyes calmed down, and even his pain lessened. His state of mind had greatly advanced due to the heart demon’s assault. The trial of the heavenly will sped up his growth. Of course, the other martial artists crossing the calamity would also mature, but not to such an extent.</p><p>“What a frightening will!” The masked man could see Ye Chen’s shivering and spasming before. However, at this moment, his body seemed relaxed and calm.</p><p>“Pursuing Thunder King, what do you think, did he pass the heart demon calamity?” Ironarm King asked.</p><p>“I’m afraid he passed.” The masked man subconsciously replied.</p><p>“Great wind fire calamity has two phases, internal and external. The external phase causes pain, allowing the internal calamity of the heart demon to easily invade. I wonder how powerful his heart demon calamity was.”</p><p>All the four Kings were clear that external calamity was merely a front; the real terror lay in the heart demon calamity. Going by Ye Chen’s talent and potential, the heart demon calamity he’d encountered must have been at least the highest grade, and there was a chance that it could have even transcended that. Of course, the heart demon calamity couldn’t be witnessed from outside, and they could only wonder what Ye Chen’s heart demon looked like.</p><p>The fire stream extinguished and scattered away. The burnt skin on Ye Chen’s body shed off, and a new skin grew out. At this moment, the great wind fire calamity had passed, leaving behind the final godly Yuan calamity.</p><p>Huff!</p><p>Letting out a deep sigh, Ye Chen opened his eyes and looked at the masked man and the other three. His gaze was completely calm and devoid of any killing intent or any other emotions. However, this gaze pressed on the others’ heart; at this moment, they felt their breath stopping as if an invisible hand was grabbing their heart tightly, not allowing it to beat.</p><p>‘What is this gaze?’ The masked man’s complexion sunk and slowly spoke. “Will suppression!”</p><p>Life and Death Kings grasped true means of will utilization. If a Life and Death King and a martial artist under Life and Death realm utilized the same martial will, the results would be completely different. The latter would have no clue about perfectly utilizing martial will suppression, and could only release the will through their instinct, while the King would be able to concentrate the will and create a frightening suppressive effect.</p><p>Although Ye Chen was not a King yet, by passing the heart demon calamity, his grasp over will had already attained the King level, and it might even be more terrifying. This was because other Kings couldn’t make the masked man feel such a suppression.</p><p>It seemed as if this mere glance could determine his life and death.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
