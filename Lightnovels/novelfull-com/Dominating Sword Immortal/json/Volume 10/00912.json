However, we’re not so fortunate as we live in a chaotic world. A chaotic world produces heroes, but it also produces dark times of unrest. To preserve one’s life and not die a premature death, one can only strive to increase their strength at every moment of their lives.” Anicca Spear took a sip of wine and smiled bitterly.</p><p>Ye Chen asked with astonishment, “Elder brother Chang, you’ve also heard about these things?”</p><p>As far as Ye Chen knew, the information about aliens was limited to very few people.</p><p>“How could I not know? Life and Death Kings have many circles who share many of the same members. If there is a secret known to one circle, it usually spreads out in other circles as well. Of course, I know some of the basic information, and not the particulars.” Anicca Spear King explained.</p><p>“So that’s the case. As you said, this era is not a safe one. Alien experts are like tigers stalking their prey. Amongst them, the demon race has caused the greatest suffering to our True Spirit World. The two of you don’t know, but when I was undergoing the life-and-death calamity, some puppets sent by the demonic race tried to kill me. Later on, two Demon Kings personally came to deal with me. Fortunately, I managed to escape.” Ye Chen told some of the things he knew to Anicca Spear King and Iron Monkey King.</p><p>“You were chased by the Demonic Race?” Anicca Spear King and Iron Monkey King were greatly shocked.</p><p>Demonic Race was an alien race superior to the human race. With the same cultivation level, the demonic race was almost guaranteed to come out on top. Back to the topic, Ye Chen managing to escape two Demonic Kings was enough to shock the world. It should be known that demons were no fools. They must have made good preparations. If it had been another genius, he would have fallen long ago.</p><p>“In that case, Brother Ye, you’ll be in danger. Back in the day, Mysterious Queen also suffered assassination attempts. Although she still lives, it doesn’t mean that the Demonic Race will not look to kill her. As long as they have the opportunity, they will not hesitate.” Iron Monkey King said.</p><p>Ye Chen smiled, “You can rest assured! Although I’m far from being unrivalled, if the demon race wants to kill me, it will not be so easy.”</p><p>Ever since arriving in this world, Ye Chen had encountered several dangers, allowing him to develop a state of mind that wouldn’t budge even if the sky collapsed. Thus, it was impossible for him to be concerned over the demon race.</p><p>Anicca Spirit King quite admired Ye Chen’s bold spirit. However, he still expressed his concern, “Since the demon race has made their appearance, I’m afraid the era of chaos is drawing near. We small fishes can only go with the flow.”</p><p>With that, the atmosphere turned somewhat grave. After a while, Iron Monkey King suddenly spoke to Ye Chen, “Brother Ye, you’ve already become a Life and Death King, but you don’t have a title. According to the rules of True Spirit World, you must head to Bestowal King Palace and obtain your title. Otherwise, the palace spirit will directly pull you over.”</p><p>“If not for Monkey, I had completely forgotten to warn you.” Anicca King consented.</p><p>“Bestowal King Palace?”</p><p>There was no information about Bestowal King Palace in the memories of Battle King.</p><p>Anicca Spear King explained, “The Bestowal King Palace is an existence from the ancient era. Nobody knows how long it has existed for. The Kings of True spirit World obtain their titles from Bestowal King Palace, and every King’s title eternally lasts on the Bestowal Pillar at the center of the palace. As for the palace spirit, it’s the spirituality of the palace and has substantial intelligence. He controls the rules of the palace, and the bestowed titles are also determined by him.”</p><p>“Then, the title is given by him or oneself?”</p><p>“By the palace spirit. Of course, you can disagree and ask for a different one as long as you have the qualifications.”</p><p>“Oh!” That seemed alright, so Ye Chen nodded.</p><p>Anicca Spear King supplemented, “Before conferring you the title, the palace spirit will arrange an illusory opponent to test your strength, then confer you the title according to your battle style. In most cases, Kings are satisfied by the titles conferred by the palace spirit.”</p><p>“I understand. Since I have a year’s time, there is no hurry.” Ye Chen was in no hurry to gain his title.</p><p>Anicca Spear King said, “There is indeed no hurry. As I see it, brother Ye actually has a chance to obtain the title of Sword King and break the ancient legend of Sword King!”</p><p>“The title of Sword King!” Iron Monkey King’s eyes wide opened.</p><p>Amongst the varieties of titles, the title of Sword King was the hardest to obtain, and the Blade King and Spear King were next in line. Most importantly, the title of Sword King was the most special. Blade King, Spear King, and Hammer King had progressed further and obtained the titles of Blade Emperor, Spear Emperor, and Hammer Emperor respectively, but there had never been a Sword Emperor. And in the past several tens of thousands of years, there hadn’t even been Sword King, much too less to speak of Sword Emperor or Sword Monarch.</p><p>In order to obtain the title of Sword King, Ye Chen would have to surpass Ancient Sword King in the corresponding time phase.</p><p>“Anything is possible. The reason the ancient Sword King has never been surpassed was because he was indeed too monstrous. He died at fifty years of age. If he’d lived for a few more years, he might have been the first Emperor of the history. However, the ancients are to be surpassed. Nobody accomplishing it till now doesn’t imply that nobody ever will.”</p><p>Actually, there had been a few who surpassed the ancient Sword King in sword dao during his later years. However, nobody could surpass him when he was fifty years old. Anyhow, Anicca King had a feeling that he might witness a miracle in Ye Chen.</p><p>“Your praise is indeed too high. I’ll try my best!”</p><p>Ye Chen was also quite admiring of the Sword King. He believed that if he could have lived a few more months or years, even if he didn’t become the first titled monarch, he would have been at least among the top three.</p><p>“Come, let’s drink to congratulate brother Ye’s Sword King title in advance.” Iron Monkey was fond of talking drivel. Hearing Anicca Spear King’s words, he also joined in the fun.</p><p>…</p><p>Three days later, Ye Chen finally left Monkey Island. Before leaving, Iron Monkey King gave three small jugs of monkey wine to him, each small jug equivalent to three bottles of the wine. Originally, he had brought out five jugs. However, Ye Chen knew that Iron Monkey King had to spend countless resources and effort to make this wine. According to Anicca Spear King, one jug of wine cost a year to brew. Of course, if the situation demanded it, Iron Monkey King could brew three jugs of wine in a year. However, collecting the resources to brew the wine was usually a slow and tiring process. Aside from time, the resources themselves were all supreme grade materials, and hence were invaluable. How could Ye Chen bring himself to take five jugs?</p><p>“Although this wine can increase the cultivation base, don’t over consume it. It’s best to receive friends or acquaintances with it.” Life and Death Kings had lofty statuses. Oftentimes, other Kings would visit him, expanding his circle slowly. If he couldn’t even receive them properly, he would be losing too much face. Thinking that, Ye Chen pondered for a moment. If the Fire Pear Tree could become a supreme grade spirit tree, its fire pears could also be something good to receive guests with.</p><p>“First I need to return to Eternal Sky Sect and create the second style of Vibrational Sword arts, and then it would be the time to officially return to True Spirit Continent.”</p><p>High stage four star battle strength was not world-shaking. If he were to return to True Spirit Continent, he must have a peerless strength, and that was not the case for the present him.</p><p>Soon afterward, Ye Chen returned to the Eternal Sky Sect. The next day, everybody in Eternal Sky Sect knew that he had entered the Life and Death realm.</p><p>“My Eternal Sky Sect has finally gained a Life and Death King. Henceforth, who would dare to openly offend my Eternal Sky Sect! Haha…” Eternal Sky Sect patriarch Li Zhangfeng was going mad with delight. The presence of a Life and Death King was exceptionally important. Without a Life and Death King, Eternal Sky Sect would never have enough deterrence. Hereon, those who wished to offend the Eternal Sky Sect would have to consider if it were worth offending a King. People were especially not willing to offend a King specializing in speed. The latter might not come knocking on their headquarters, but he could kill all of their disciples and escape.</p><p>Life and Death Kings would never easily become enemies. Once two Kings became enemies, it was an enmity of life and death. Thus, Kings rarely offended other Kings for petty reasons.</p><p>Anyhow, the commotion in Eternal Sky Sect didn’t distract Ye Chen one bit, as he was wholeheartedly immersed in creating the second style of Vibrational Sword Arts.</p><p>Rip!</p><p>With a cloth-ripping sound, Ye Chen’s sword slashed out. The sword was exceptionally clear. If one could magnify the sword light two-three times, the sword light would appear to actually vibrate intensely. Due to its excessive frequency, the sword light gave a feeling as if it were a clear, ordinary sword light.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The summit before him was instantly cleaved into two amidst sky-rising dust. The thin slice of mountain body that was sliced out instantly turned into dust.</p><p>“No good…Metal profound and vibrational power are not harmonized.” One knew the affairs of his own family the best. Although the previous slash seemed mighty and grand, it had many gaps. In other words, it lacked in terms of skill. It might work against ordinary opponents, but against opponents like Demonic Blade King, who were proficient vibrational power, these gaps would prop out glaringly.</p><p>Of course, Ye Chen could opt to suppress the opponent with absolute strength. However, he was fond of beating opponents with skill.</p><p>“Eh? Someone is visiting?”</p><p>A man and a woman arrived at the entrance of Eternal Sky Sect. The man looked middle-aged and had a thin stature, exuding a faint blade aura from his body. The aura spread out in fine strands like the surface of a spring breeze. The woman behind him looked extremely young, exuding a cold yet charming feeling. She was none other than Demonic Blade Sect’s Lashan Mei.</p><p>The two didn’t immediately head over to Ye Chen’s place. Instead, they courteously stood on the principal summit of Eternal Sky Sect.</p><p>“I really didn’t expect that he would become a Life and Death King so fast.”</p><p>The middle-aged man felt somewhat regretful. He was hoping to offer a helping hand to Ye Chen during the time of crisis. Sending help in the time of need was much more superior than adding icing on the cake after all. However, the situation changed too drastically, and he’d lost the opportunity to establish a good relationship with the other. Fortunately, his disciple Lashan Mei had a good friendship with him. As soon as he found out that he’d entered Life and Death realm, he immediately decided to pay a visit to Eternal Sky Sect along with Lashan Mei</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
