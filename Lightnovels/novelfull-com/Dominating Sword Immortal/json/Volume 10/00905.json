Underneath, Ye Chen’s aura continued to soar, charging through the three skies.</p><p>“King grade Zhen Yuan is worthy of its name, five times greater in essence. Even a peerless talent would find filling the gap between king grade Zhen Yuan and lower realm Zhen Yuan extremely challenging. Not many could do it even in a thousand years.”</p><p>Raising his right hand, which was postured like a blade, Ye Chen lightly slashed the air.</p><p>Puff…a black crack appeared in the sky, leaking spatial power.</p><p>“Condense!”</p><p>Ye Chen’s space profound, which was already at fifty percent completion, could easily maintain this crack. The spatial energies gushing out of the crack condensed together around the edges of the crack, forming an outline.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>But, the mending power of the space was too strong. After three breaths, the crack mended itself, scattering the energies outside the outline that were preserving the spatial crack.</p><p>“My control over spatial power was lacking just now. If I had done better, the crack could have been maintained for a lot longer.” Shaking his head, Ye Chen again focused his gaze on the masked man, who didn’t try to escape. He was quite clear that trying to escape was useless. Ye Chen’s battle strength was at least in the high end of three star stage, or could even be at the peak of three star. Even the battle strength of the previous him was mid three star, while the current him only had a low three star battle strength. No matter how he tried to escape, it would be an instant death for him. He obviously didn’t think Ye Chen would spare his life.</p><p>“I’ll give you three breaths of time. If you can escape, I may give you a chance.”</p><p>Ordinary Kings had a soul perception range of ten thousand li, which could be enhanced to a hundred thousand li through some secret soul arts. As long as one could escape the soul perception, pursuing them would become a challenging affair. However, Ye Chen was different. His soul eye could see everything within a billion li. Even if the masked man were to escape to the True Spirit Continent, Ye Chen could still find him.</p><p>Hearing these words, the masked man’s face greatly changed. “Ye Chen, don’t be foolish! I’ll give three days of time to reconsider.”</p><p>“One!”</p><p>Ye Chen began counting coldly.</p><p>“Ye Chen, you’ll regret it!” The masked man’s eyes were opened wide, almost cracking, as he bellowed.</p><p>“Two!”</p><p>“Escape!”</p><p>The masked man’s scalp went numb. Lightning fire erupted from his body as his entire being turned into a cloud of lightning fire, escaping into the void. His speed was pushed past his limits, damaging his body. Meanwhile, Ye Chen didn’t move at all and allowed the other to escape as he pleased.</p><p>“Three!”</p><p>Raising the Sky Scorpio Sword, Ye Chen finally thrust forward. With that, a transparent ripple arced into the depths of the void. A hundred thousand li away, the masked man was suddenly caught in a spatial ripple, sealed within a purple mirror. He couldn’t move his body, except for his eyeballs, which slightly turned, staring at Ye Chen with overflowing venom.</p><p>“I gave you a chance, but you didn’t have the skill to take it.”</p><p>The reason Ye Chen gave the masked man three breaths was to verify the use of space profound after entering the Life and Death realm. In reality, he had no intentions of giving the masked man any chance of survival.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>The purple mirror shattered. The frenzied spatial splinters slashed through the body of the masked man, instantly turning him into a blood mist.</p><p>“Space profound can directly disregard spatial distance within a fixed distance. Ten thousand li is no different than a few thousand li for me, but the premise is that one’s soul power and Zhen Yuan has to be strong enough.”</p><p>Ye Chen let out a sigh. He’d finally understood how frightening were the Kings who knew space profound. Fortunately, his space profound had basically been on par with the greater majority of the Kings. If he faced a King with a space profound superior to his, he might not be able to endure even a single slap.</p><p>With a flicker, Ye Chen’s figure entered the void.</p><p>If the spatial energies within the void were crazy blades before, the spatial energies now were like streams, unable to pierce his Protective Zhen Yuan and injure his body. Shuttling in the void, he found the storage rings of Beard King, Ironarm King, and the masked man. As for Gray Bird King’s storage ring, it was outside the void, and had already been collected by him.</p><p>Opening the spatial barrier, Ye Chen again appeared above the great ocean.</p><p>“Life and Death realm is indeed…powerful. But, my gains aren’t only soul power and Zhen Yuan.”</p><p>The moment Ye Chen entered Life and Death realm, his Green Lotus Sword Art entered the mid stage of heaven grade from the lower stages. Its speed of operating Zhen Yuan became inconceivably fast, increasing his cultivation speed by three times.</p><p>A lower stage heaven grade cultivation technique meant that his cultivation speed would be thrice that of the cultivators who didn’t have a heaven grade cultivation art. In other words, compared to other Kings, who would gain a year of cultivation base in one year, you would gain a cultivation base of three years. With his current Green Lotus Sword Arts, Ye Chen would gain a cultivation base of nine years within a year, which would be nine folds compared to the Kings without heaven grade cultivation technique.</p><p>With a simple circulation of Green Lotus Sword Arts, Ye Chen could feel boundless Yuan Qi in the heavens and earth pouring in his body, rapidly converting into Zhen Yuan. Of course, natural Yuan Qi was too sparse for Life and Death Kings, thinner by a thousand folds compared to the Yuan Qi he’d received during the calamity. Therefore, relying on one’s cultivation technique to restore Zhen Yuan wasn’t too realistic. It was too slow, unless one could find a paradise with ten folds or even hundred folds higher concentration of Yuan Qi.</p><p>Once Green Lotus Sword Arts improved, Sword Domain, which was based on Green Lotus Sword Arts, also improved.</p><p>Ye Chen’s sword domain was already at the peak of the second layer. As soon as Green Lotus Sword Arts improved, the Sword Domain entered the second layer, doubling the might of Sword Rule. Its sword pressure had reached such a state that ordinary Kings would be shocked still, unable to defend themselves in any manner.</p><p>With the Sword Domain’s second layer, Ye Chen was no longer sure what level his battle power had reached. Of course, the four star level seemed a bit too unlikely. The difference between each star was enormous. For example, if he had peak three star battle strength, he would still easily lose to a four star King. However, there were some people whose strength would be considered as three star, they were still infinitesimally close to four star battle strength.</p><p>These people possessed what was called the tyrant three star battle strength,</p><p>For example, Copper Sword King possessed a tyrant two star strength, implying that no other two star King could endure a few moves from him. He could even somewhat contend with lower stages of three star Kings. Even if he couldn’t win, he would have a good chance of escaping.</p><p>Going by how easily he was able to kill the masked man, Ye Chen reckoned that he’d at least peak three star strength. As for tyrant three star battle strength, that would require a few more verifications.</p><p>“No hurries! Now that I’ve attained the Life and Death realm, I can enter the one-with-the-heavens state at any point. My profounds will increase by leaps and bounds, and once I improve them to their limits, I will create a powerful sword move that would more or less guarantee a four star battle strength. It shouldn’t be too hard.”</p><p>Four star battle strength represented peak Kings. However, Ye Chen had just entered the Life and Death realm and had a lot of room improvement, which was vastly different from those at their limits.</p><p>“Open!”</p><p>Opening the erect silver eye underneath his forehead, Ye Chen gazed in the direction of Blood Sky Continent.</p><p>Iron Blood Region…</p><p>Eternal Sky Sect…</p><p>Ye Chen could see Li Zhangfeng, Gao Zhiyuan, and many others cultivating or chatting. The surroundings of the sect also seemed peaceful with no indication of imminent danger. Turning his head, he looked at True Spirit Continent.</p><p>Sky Cloud Sect and Ye family were rapidly developing, increasing their personnel by several folds that included many experts. With his soul eye, Ye Chen could see a layer of abstruse and mysterious fate Qi drifting in the skies above Ye family and Sky Cloud Sect. However, even his soul eye couldn’t pierce through this fate Qi, and could only spot a few of its traces.</p><p>“Fortunately, nothing serious seems to be happening. I can go into seclusion for a while and improve my profound!”</p><p>Determining that his acquaintances were temporarily safe, Ye Chen calmed down. As for the Dragon God Celestial Palace, he couldn’t bring himself to look there. Although his current strength seemed high enough, it could not match several exceptionally powerful Kings. Once his strength reached his current limits, he would make a trip to Dragon God Celestial Palace and see what had happened there. Separated by such a distance, he could see but not hear anything after all.</p><p>…</p><p>The palace in the depths of the boundless ocean…</p><p>Several blood colored stones suddenly dimmed on the long table.</p><p>“Pursuing Thunder King and the whole lot of them lost?”</p><p>“Killed by Ye Chen, or killed by someone else?”</p><p>The black-skinned figure tapped the long table with a frown on his face.</p><p>“If they were killed by Ye Chen, he must have entered the Life and Death realm. If he entered Life and Death realm in such a short time, his potential is far above Mysterious Queen.”</p><p>“If he were saved by someone else, he hasn’t entered Life and Death realm, and there is still a chance.”</p><p>“These trash…They couldn’t even do this much!”</p><p>“Alright, relying on trash is not worth it. I better have Horned Demon make a trip. Every day this kind of genius lives, greater the danger for us. If he is given a few decades to mature, I’m afraid even reviving the Lords might encounter some trouble.”</p><p>He had no tolerance for the apex geniuses of True Spirit Continent. A dozen years ago, they couldn’t find an opportunity to kill Mysterious Queen, and now, her strength was such that they had no hopes of killing her. Even if he personally went, killing her seemed impossible even though he had seventy-eighty percent chance of defeating her. There was almost nobody in the five star battle strength range who could kill her. Her abstruse dao had left a deep impression on him.</p><p>He flicked his finger, emitting a blood ray which landed on one of the blood colored stones.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>The stone brightly glowed, and a long-horned blood figure appeared inside the light.</p><p>“What’s the matter?” The horned blood figure asked.</p><p>The black-skinned let out a sigh and said, “Ye Chen might have entered Life and Death realm, with at least high stage three star battle strength, or even peak three star battle strength. He can’t be allowed to grow anymore. Find a chance to kill him. As for other Kings discovering our existence, don’t mind it too much. They have already become somewhat aware in any case.”</p><p>“He entered Life and Death realm? That’s indeed troublesome!” The horned blood figure continued, “We have demonic power from our world, which is completely incompatible with this world. Once it’s leaked, those Kings will certainly try to track it back to here. Since you’ve spoken, I’ll act swiftly. Don’t worry too much! I’ll immediately hide in the abyss later. I don’t believe they will be able to find out too much.”</p><p>“Good!” The black-skinned powerhouse slowly nodded.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
