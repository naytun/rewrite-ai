You seem unable to deal with him by yourself.”</p><p>The fiendish man raised three fingers and said, “Three moves…If he doesn’t fall in three moves, we’ll deal with him together. Until then, just keep him from escaping.”</p><p>As a Demonic King, the fiendish man had his own pride. He didn’t think that dealing with Ye Chen would be too much trouble. Thus, he would rather rely on his own strength.</p><p>“That’s fine.” The youngster faintly nodded and backed down.</p><p>Zi! Zi! Zi!</p><p>Electric currents suddenly sparked between the two horns of the fiendish man, making his spiral horns seem like electric conductors that were glowing with heat. With his title of Horned Demon, his horns were naturally exceptional, containing a frightening demonic power.</p><p>The demonic power in the horns transmitted to his body, making his demonic power aura twice as powerful. With that, the black scales on his body began to gleam with a dim golden color as if being roasted.</p><p>“Demonic Dragon Battle Sky Art!” The fiendish man roared as he stretched his right fist and tilted his head back right, then suddenly thrust out. With that, a giant black dragon phantom roared and shot at Ye Chen, creating sinister-looking scars in the space.</p><p>“His battle strength has increased again.”</p><p>Ye Chen didn’t dare to be neglectful as he raised the Sky Scorpio Sword, and a formless cloud of spatial ripple swarmed at the giant dragon phantom. Although Bewitching Mirror Shattering was unable to completely bring out the seventy percent space profound, its might was still several times higher than before. The moment the spatial ripple and the giant dragon phantom came into contact, the spatial ripple sucked the dragon phantom inside, as if sending it to another world.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The giant dragon phantom was excessively strong. Even sealed within the mirror, it could move and was battering the mirror, creating numerous cracks and seeming as if it could break out at any moment.</p><p>Kacha!</p><p>The purple mirror suddenly shattered, and berserk spatial splinters slashed at the giant dragon phantom’s body, rapidly counteracting its energy. When the dragon phantom charged out of the spatial splinters, it didn’t even have thirty percent of its original power and was slashed in two by Ye Chen, turning into a black stream of air before returning to the heaven and earth.</p><p>“Second move, Tyrant Dragon Fist!”</p><p>This time, it was not a giant dragon phantom, but a dragon head phantom that was even bigger than the giant dragons by several folds. Its mouth, which was big as a small mountain, opened wide, seemingly capable of devouring the heaven and earth as one while emitting a frightening attractive force.</p><p>With his clothes madly fluttering, Ye Chen’s feet struggled as he was being pulled in by the attractive force.</p><p>“Sword Domain!” With a growl, he increased the Sword Domain outside his body to its limits to contend against the attractive force coming from the dragon. At the same time, he slashed three times on the dragon head.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>Three deep sword scars appeared on the dragon head. If seen from close distance, it would be evident that Ye Chen’s Vibrational Sword Arts contained an inconceivable might. However, this dragon head phantom was no ordinary demonic art. Its structure was extremely stable and couldn’t be undone solely by vibrational sword energy.</p><p>Huff!</p><p>Soon, Ye Chen’s entire being was sucked inside the dragon head phantom.</p><p>“It’s over!” The fiendish man let out a sigh. Ye Chen’s tenacity was beyond his expectation. Fortunately, although his strength was high stage four star, the fiendish man’s own strength was at the peak four star once he used his innate skills. And this was because his body had suffered injuries upon forcefully entering True Spirit World. Outside True Spirit World, his battle strength was actually at the peak five star stage. Thus, the demonic martial skills he’d created were exceptionally exquisite.</p><p>“Horned Demon, I didn’t expect to see your Tyrant Dragon Fist being so exquisite. The former you was not one to care about specifics after all.” The youngster was rather astonished, but he spoke with a smile.</p><p>The fiendish man said, “Forcefully entering True Spirit World has caused all of us grave injuries. If your battle strength is high, you can naturally make up for the lack of exquisiteness. However, once your battle strength falls to four star level, you naturally have to pay attention to the details and make sure that you reveal no openings in your move.”</p><p>“That is true, but I find it hard to believe that your Tyrant Dragon Fist can really kill him.” The youngster’s eyes still moved to the dragon head phantom for a quick glance.</p><p>“Tyrant Dragon Fist has a perfect spiral inside and would cost a lot of Zhen Yuan to break out. With his less than two hundred years cultivation base, he won’t be able to hold on.” The fiendish man was exceptionally confident in the Tyrant Dragon Fist. Perhaps it didn’t have much use against those more powerful than him, but it was the bane of the martial artists with the same strength as him.</p><p>Rip!</p><p>Just as the fiendish man was speaking, the dragon head phantom spit open, emitting a blinding out. The crack magnified and a human figure walked out.</p><p>“Impossible!” The fiendish man’s face stiffened.</p><p>The structure of demonic power inside the dragon head phantom was exceptionally dense. Without any exaggeration, if a King with peak four star battle strength were caught off-guard and sucked inside, even they wouldn’t be able to break out within a short time, much less to speak of Ye Chen, who only had high stage four star battle strength.</p><p>“Nothing is impossible. Don’t forget that he is the most monstrous genius in the recent tens of thousands of years. Anything is possible when it comes to him.” The youngster’s eyes squinted, the blue gleam in his eyes condensing into two light acrs.</p><p>“Now try my sword move.” With his clothes frantically fluttering, Ye Chen cleaved the dragon head and slashed at the fiendish man, causing a light and effortless sword aura to spread out.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The moment the sword moved, the fiendish man was instantly hit, and a sword scar, which ran deep enough to expose his organs, appeared on his chest. His right arm was also slashed by the Qi, instantly turned into blood mist by the intense spatial ripple.</p><p>Sky Shattering Sword Arts’ second style—Orbital Strike!</p><p>Precisely speaking, it was not the completed Orbital Strike.</p><p>The perfected Orbital Strike would make the sword trajectory coincide with the spatial ripples. The sword would seem as if it were teleporting, perfectly blending the might and speed without revealing any openings. However, Ye Chen was yet to reach that state. He could only make the sword trajectory closely follow the spatial ripples, potentially cutting down the sword’s might to one third. Even so, it could tear apart the dense and complicated structure inside the dragon head phantom and instantly injure the fiendish man.</p><p>If not for the Orbital Strike, things would have played out exactly as the fiendish man had said. Ye Chen would have lost of Zhen Yuan and would have no power to retaliate.</p><p>The fiendish man and the youngster could only react after the former had a deep wound at his chest and lost his right arm.</p><p>“Ah!” The fiendish man howled like an injured wolf, and his face contorted.</p><p>“Such frightening sword arts!” Meanwhile, the youngster sucked in a breath of cold air. He didn’t expect at all that Ye Chen had already begun to create a powerful space profound sword move. Creating profound martial arts was not a matter of a day or two. Although one would have a huge improvements in the profound upon entering Life and Death realm, creating a profound martial skill suitable for oneself still required several years of work, or even decades in many cases.</p><p>Of course, Life and Death Kings had a lot of time, and a few years didn’t mean much to them. However, merely a month after entering Life and Death realm, Ye Chen had already begun to create a space profound sword move, and its might could already be guessed from the initial display. How could he not be astonished?</p><p>His ability to create seemed simply monstrous.</p><p>“What a pity!” Ye Chen shook his head. His aim was actually the fiendish man’s head. However, the sword trajectory didn’t coincide with spatial ripples, creating some divergence. Space was extremely wondrous; a hundredth of hair’s error could create a difference of thousand li. To accomplish a difference of a mere one meter was already an accomplishment for Ye Chen.</p><p>‘This is not bad. My opponent is from the demon race. The deeper I understand him, the more I will understand the enemy. At least, I will not be completely clueless when I will fight Demonic Kings more powerful than him in the future.’</p><p>Beast race, Demonic Human race, Half Beast Race—these were the races Ye Chen already understood. However, the demonic race, which didn’t belong to True Spirit World was one race that Ye Chen was good as clueless. Therefore, this battle held a lot of meaning for him.</p><p>Amidst wriggling flesh, the fiendish man’s scar on chest and the right arm rapidly mended. He raised his head and callously looked at Ye Chen.</p><p>“Nine Nethers, we’ll deal with him together.” The fiendish man spoke to the youngster.</p><p>The latter smiled, “That’s two moves.”</p><p>“If he were not a genius of True Spirit Continent, I wouldn’t have minded a fair battle against him. But, at this point, we need to finish him off quickly. Our aura is rapidly leaking out in the heaven and earth. Soon, the powerhouses of this world will be alerted.” The fiendish man was exceptionally cool-headed and didn’t fly into a rage.</p><p>“Hehe…Horned Demon, why don’t you become my administrator? My original strength was higher than Black Stone, and he is still inferior to me in many aspects. If you follow me, I can guarantee that you will receive much more.” The youngster was fond of the fiendish man’s prudence and decided to poach him.</p><p>The fiendish man curled his lips, “Kill him first.” As far as he was concerned, Nine Nethers was a lunatic. Following Back Stone was much safer. Of course, he would not reject his invitation right now, lest something unexpected happened.</p><p>“Alright, I know you don’t want to follow me. But, allow me to show you why following me is much better.” The youngster could instantly see through the fiendish man’s heart, but he didn’t mind.</p><p>“They are going to fight together. Seems like my time to leave has come.”</p><p>Ye Chen didn’t think that he could deal with both of them. He guessed that a peak four star battle strength King was not their opponent, and only a tyrant four star King would be able to face them.</p><p>“Tyrant Dragon Fist!”</p><p>“Nine Nethers Sky Seal!”</p><p>The two immediately struck upon deciding to deal with Ye Chen together: One issued a huge dragon head with frightening devouring power while the other rotated both his arms in a circle, flooding the world with a blue radiance and sealing the space. One was taking the frontal assault and the other covering the exits; the two matched their assaults perfectly, clearly showing that the two had joined hands many times before.</p><p>Unfortunately, although they were fast, Ye Chen acted even faster. His body flickered, and his entire being blended with the space, drilling through before the blue light completed its enclosure.</p><p>“Not good! He can already utilize the space profound in movement arts. He is really hard to trap.” The youngster’s face changed before he rushed forth.</p><p>“Your Nine Nethers Sky Seal is very powerful in trapping enemies, isn’t it?” The fiendish man was anxious.</p><p>“It won’t work. Although Nine Nethers Sky Seal contains space profound, it needs some preparatory work to trap powerful enemies.”</p><p>The two chased after Ye Chen in succession. However, the latter’s space profound had attained seventy percent completion. The spatial power inside the void worked as impetus for him, allowing his speed to reach higher and higher. In a few moments, the two had already lost his traces.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
