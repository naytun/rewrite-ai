The immense soul power suppression locked on the soul general.</p><p>Chi! Chi! Chi!</p><p>Splinters of soul power flew off the soul general’s body, and his body became increasingly transparent and thin. With a final bang, it completely scattered.</p><p>“He can even use soul storm with such skill?” Ironarm King sucked in a breath of cold air. Most Life and Death Kings could use the soul storm, but those who could cultivate it to the greater success realm could be counted on two hands. Most could not go past the minor success realm. Ironarm King, who was a body refiner and didn’t have a talent in the aspect of soul, was far away even from the minor success realm. He could see that Ye Chen’s soul storm was not too far away from the minor success realm.</p><p>“Don’t worry, his soul was already injured before. Now, he even had to forcefully unleash the soul storm. Although he looks relaxed, it should have worsened his injuries. Though, I wonder how deep his injuries really are.” Beard King analyzed.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter how deep his injuries are, because there is still one wave left.” As if having felt something, the masked man raised his head and looked at the black hole encompassing all the three skies.</p><p>“Fourth wave?”</p><p>The other three King simultaneously raised their heads.</p><p>Kill!</p><p>A low growl came from inside the black hole, reverberating through the heaven and earth.</p><p>Kill!</p><p>The second time, the growl was a lot clearer, and its might was equally higher. As soon as the voice was heard, a frightening soul pressure descended as if an infernal wind had blown past.</p><p>Kill! Kill! Kill!</p><p>The next moment, three consecutive growls came, and the soul pressure increased by several folds. Apart from the masked man, the three Kings let out muffled groans and retreated several steps.</p><p>“This kid is really a freak! Apart from the unknown wind fire calamity, both the other two calamities had been pushed to new heights. This godly Yuan calamity’s fourth wave…what calamity is this?”</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>From the depths of the black hole, an incorporeal wave rippled out. A cloaked figure with withered and mushy skin—as if sewn together—emerged.</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>“It’s the Primordial Slaughter King!” The masked man blurted out with a trembling voice.</p><p>“Primordial Slaughter King? The fiendish creature from the legendary soul prison?” Gray Bird King was rooted in place.</p><p>The masked man shook his head, “Soul prison is most likely nothing but fantasy. I’ve heard Lord say that after a person dies, their soul breath would scatter. This soul breath has no spirituality and is just chaos, but it still retains a trace of instinct. When countless soul breaths combine in special circumstances, they form a primordial spirit. Primordial spirits are ruthless and irrational. They devour souls wherever they go and strengthen themselves. When a primordial spirit becomes powerful enough, it’s called the Primordial Slaughter King. Primordial Slaugher Kings gain spirituality and have many offensive soul arts at their disposal. It’s a creature far more terrifying than blood demons.”</p><p>Blood demons originated from boundless blood while Primordial Slaughter King originated from countless soul breaths. Both were unnatural existences.</p><p>“If it’s a Primordial Slaughter King, isn’t this kid already dead?” Gray Bird King’s eyes brightened as he asked.</p><p>“No,” The masked man sized Primordial Spirit King and said, “This Primordial Slaughter King’s body has too many signs of mending. The stronger a Primordial Slaughter King is, the lesser the signs of mending. This one should be recently born. Though, even if this kid could get by, his soul will weaken a lot.”</p><p>The masked man sneered. He didn’t expect Ye Chen to encounter the legendary Primordial Slaughter King.</p><p>‘Primordial Slaughter King!’ Relying on Battle King’s memories, Ye Chen figured out the cloaked figure’s origins as well.</p><p>Primordial Slaughter King was formed from countless soul breaths and influenced by their negative sentiments. It could even be considered an irrational creature that only knew how to destroy since the moment it spawned.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Its weapon was also withered and a seemingly sewn together stone rod. Countless vague faces shrieked inside the countless breaths curling around the stone rod. With a flicker, Primordial Slaughter King smashed the stone rod in his hand at Ye Chen. With a grave expression, the latter emitted a soul storm once again.</p><p>Puff! Puff! Puff!</p><p>The stone rod spit apart layers of soul power. Primordial Slaughter King could only absorb unarranged soul power, and thus, could not absorb the soul storm. It could only forcefully break it apart. However, it impacted its movements, not allowing it to instantly close in on Ye Chen.</p><p>“Again!” Ye Chen emitted another soul storm.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>This time, the Primordial Slaughter King was forced to stop, its body stumbling. However, Ye Chen frowned when he noticed that the soul breath around its body was not reduced even by hundredth. It meant that even if he used soul storm two hundred times, it would not be enough to deal with it.</p><p>“Pure soul storm doesn’t work, then what about a Destruction attributed soul storm?”</p><p>Ye Chen pulled open the distance between the two while emitting the third soul storm. This soul storm had the destruction sword intent mixed with the soul power. It should be known that will could also threaten the soul. Moreover, Ye Chen’s sword intent was not any ordinary sword intent, but the destruction sword intent, which was almost unparalleled in its destructive power throughout the whole world.</p><p>Puff! Puff!</p><p>Primordial Slaughter King could not dodge the destructive soul storm and bore the full brunt. The soul breath on its body rapidly evaporated, reducing by almost ten percent.</p><p>“It’s indeed effective!” This was Ye Chen’s first time coming across the legendary Primordial Slaughter King and had no experience.</p><p>Since he saw the destructive soul storm being effective, he would naturally use it.</p><p>Primordial Slaughter King forcefully retreated for several steps. Next, he suddenly growled, and a cloud of soul storm rippled out of his body, evolving into a soul halo. When the destructive soul storm came into contact with the soul halo, it instantly scattered, only taking half of the soul breath compared to before. Its effectiveness was clearly decreased by a lot.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>With the soul halo guarding its body, Primordial Slaughter King raised its stone rod and smashed it down.</p><p>“An offensive soul art!”</p><p>Ye Chen’s gaze shrunk. In his soul perception, countless phantoms of soul rods were hacking at him, every one of which contained a powerful vibrational energy like Lashan Mei’s Demonic Blade Arts and his Vibrational Sword Arts. However, the difference was that Primordial Slaughter King was using soul power, making it much more frightening.</p><p>“I can’t get hit!”</p><p>Even though Ye Chen’s soul power was five times that of others and had already reached the level of Kings in essence, he didn’t dare take the risk of facing this move head on.</p><p>“Immortal soul storm!”</p><p>If the destruction soul storm was for offense, then immortal soul storm was for defense. It was spiraling around his body and protecting it.</p><p>The immortal soul storm was scattered away by the assault of soul rod phantoms, but it only left them with thirty percent of their original power. Naturally, it was not nearly enough to threaten Ye Chen, and they were directly crushed by his soul membrane.</p><p>“I have to lower his soul breath first.”</p><p>In fact, Ye Chen had his own ace—Soul Light. However, he could only use Soul Light twice, and thus, its use must be carefully thought out. His plan was to reduce Primordial Slaughter King’s soul breath, and then use Soul Light to directly kill him. If he used Soul Light right now, his soul power would be reduced by half, and if the opponent didn’t die, while he would most likely die.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Ye Chen defended himself with the immortal soul storm while returning fire with the destructive soul storm, and Primordial Slaughter King used all sorts of offensive soul arts while defending itself with the soul halo. The grand battle between the two turned into a battle of attrition.</p><p>“How is this possible?” Beard King and the other two looked on with dumbstruck faces.</p><p>“Take a closer look, he is rapidly burning his soul power.” The masked man remained cool-headed. Ye Chen had been continually using soul storms, and thus, must have used a lot of soul power.</p><p>Sixty percent!</p><p>Fifty percent!</p><p>Forty percent!</p><p>Almost…</p><p>Ye Chen silently computed the Primordial Slaughter King’s soul breath. As soon as its soul breath reached below forty percent, he brazenly threw out his ace. His forehead parted open, and the erect silver eye beneath spouted a silver light beam. The silver light comprised of an extremely compressed soul power that instantly hit Primordial Slaughter King’s chest.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Like snow melting in the sun, the body of Primordial Slaughter King visibly melted, and its soul breath evaporated: thirty percent, twenty percent, ten percent, five percent…</p><p>In the end, only a trace of soul breath was left.</p><p>“It’s over!”</p><p>There was no need for another soul light or even soul power, so Ye Chen directly shot out a beam of destructive sword intent.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Primordial Slaughter King scattered away, turning into nothingness.</p><p>Godly Yuan calamity, passed!</p><p>The moment the Primordial Slaughter King was destroyed, a huge commotion occurred in the black hole. It began to crazily spin, condensing an extremely pure Yuan Qi sphere. The Yuan Qi sphere contained excessive energy. According to Ye Chen’s estimate, if all this energy entered his body, he would gain at least eighty-ninety years of cultivation base, and a cultivation base of a true King with king grade Zhen Yuan.</p><p>However, the biggest change was not occurring inside the black hole, but inside Ye Chen’s own body. HIs Sea of Soul was surging and roaring, and its countenance was gaining a golden hue, making it seem like a dim golden ocean. The destructive sword soul and immortal sword soul hovering above the Sea of Soul seemed to have gained a huge nourishment and were growing at a pace three times compared to before.</p><p>“My soul power is increasing!”</p><p>Ye Chen could feel that his Sea of Soul was rapidly deepening. Usually, one could gain a ten fold increase in soul power while entering Life and Death realm. However, Ye Chen’s soul power gain was far beyond that. It currently seemed to reach a fifteen fold increase, and was still climbing.</p><p>Fourteen folds!</p><p>Fifteen folds!</p><p>Sixteen folds!</p><p>…</p><p>HIs soul power continued to increase and reached nineteen folds, and finally…twenty folds!</p><p>In other words, even if Ye Chen’s soul power had been ordinary, it had now doubled compared to others. Adding his previous advantage, his current soul power was ten times that of ordinary experts.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
