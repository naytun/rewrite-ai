However, they were the only race to cultivate demonic power, and also the race with the most intense conflict with the True Spirit World.</p><p>For two Demon Kings to have come looking for him, it was really thinking too highly of him! Of course, Ye Chen didn’t feel extremely threatened by the auras of the two. This was proof that their battle strength was not at five star level. If their strength had been that high, he would have instantly escaped. The difference between four star and five star battle strength was too vast after all.</p><p>While Ye Chen was sizing up the fiendish man and the youngster, they were also sizing Ye Chen up.</p><p>“There is something wrong. This kid’s cultivation base is too deep for a recently made King…It’s actually twice as deep.” The youngster’s two gleaming eyes seemed as if they could see through anything. As his blue gaze fell on Ye Chen’s body, he instantly figured out the latter’s cultivation base, and it greatly astonished him. Usually, one had around a fifty year cultivation base upon entering Life and Death realm. Even a genius like Mysterious Queen had a ninety year cultivation base. However, Ye Chen’s cultivation base was evidently above one hundred and fifty years, approaching two hundred years.</p><p>How could he have known that Ye Chen had refined a total of two million Zhen Yuan crystals as well as seven hundred and twenty thousand supreme grade spirit stones, and only then barely crossed the one hundred and eighty years cultivation base mark?</p><p>“Ye Chen, right? Today, you’ll certainly die. Although, it’s a testament of your strength for you to have survived so long.” The fiendish man had a pair of curved horns on his head with a spiral texture, making them look exceptionally sharp. As he talked, his two horns gleamed with a cold light.</p><p>“You couldn’t kill me before Life and Death realm, and now it’s even more impossible for you. Although your strength is high, I’m afraid it’s not five star, is it?” Ye Chen indifferently smiled, seeming confident.</p><p>“Eh, seems like you’re really confident. You think that a four star battle strength can’t do anything to you?” The youngster’s lips curled upwards as he teasingly spoke.</p><p>“You’ll know once you try.”</p><p>The youngster looked at the fiendish man and said, “Horned Demon, seems like we’re being looked down on.”</p><p>“Hold the perimeter…Don’t let him escape.” The fiendish man said indifferently.</p><p>“Fine.” Folding his arms over the chest, the youngster retreated to the side.</p><p>“Ye Chen, I’ll let you know my title before you die. My title is Horned Demon. You can die now!” After announcing his title, the fiendish man’s figure flickered and closed in on the other like a black thunderbolt as he punched out. “Demonic Power Fist!”</p><p>It was the same demonic race art that Murong Qingcheng used, but its degree of suppression was much higher in the hands of the fiendish man. A deep, straight channel opened in the space, overflowing with fist energy.</p><p>Awee!</p><p>The Sky Scorpio Sword in Ye Chen’s hands vibrated, letting out an ear-piercing screech as he raised it to face the incoming fist, using Vibrational Sword Arts. With the fifth step spirit body and the control provided by King grade Zhen Yuan, the current Vibrational Sword Arts were unfathomably more powerful than Lashan Mei’s Annihilation Chop, and it instantly shattered the space.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The fist and Sky Scorpio Sword collided together, and the two retreated back.</p><p>“Four Star battle strength!” The fiendish man let out an alarmed cry.</p><p>“No wonder he is arrogant…His battle strength is actually at the four star level!” The youngster was somewhat amazed. Four star battle strength was not easy to attain. According to the standard of this world, it represented peak Kings, which were rare and widely reputed.</p><p>“Mid stage four star battle strength…not bad! Unfortunately, it’s not enough.”</p><p>Killing intent overflowed from the fiendish man’s eyes. His punch could have easily killed a King with low stage four star battle strength. Since Ye Chen could endure it without any trouble, it clearly meant his battle strength was at mid four star level.</p><p>“Let me see how you will survive this punch.” The fiendish man roared and punched again. The fist energy condensed into a berserk demonic dragon with seemingly unfathomably sharp teeth and claws. This move was certainly above Demonic Power Fist, and it ought to be an ace of the fiendish man.</p><p>Ye Chen neither retreated nor dodged. He again raised his sword, using Congealing Water this time.</p><p>Before his profounds had improved, his battle strength was at most of the tyrant three star level. But, after his profounds greatly improved, his battle strength was evidently at mid four star level, unless he didn’t have Congealing Water that could bring out the full might of metal profound and water profound.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>The demonic dragon phantom and sword energy collided. The former shattered into countless specks while the latter vanished like smoke: Both of them were equally matched.</p><p>“Horned Demon, bring out your true strength! There is something strange about this kid’s battle strength.” The youngster said with a frown.</p><p>‘True Strength?’ Ye Chen coldly looked at the fiendish man with Sky Scorpio pointing diagonally downwards while emitting a purple sword light. ‘Fine, I’ve never fought against a Demon King, Nothing wrong to know more about them.’</p><p>“His battle strength is nearing high step four star!” The fiendish man couldn’t help but admit that he’d somewhat looked down on Ye Chen. Barely a month after Life and Death realm, he already had a battle strength above mid four star level. This was simply a miracle! If he were given some time, wouldn’t his strength directly reach the five star, or even six star level?</p><p>“He can’t be left alive.” The fiendish man decided that even if he had to pay some price, he would make sure that Ye Chen died.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The fiendish man bent his back and firmly clenched his palms together. A boundless, sinister demonic power soared up in the sky, which was not an energy of the True Spirit World. It collided with the Yuan Qi of True Spirit World, creating a ghastly, dim, black shade in the sky. Meanwhile, his body rapidly swelled, growing numerous and dense black scales. Long bones grew out of his elbows and knees, and a tail grew out of his tailbone. The tail seemed extremely flexible and powerful, and its tip had three sharp horns. But, the biggest change occurred at his arms. They lengthened more than twice and deepened several folds, becoming even thicker than thighs. They had bulging muscles, seeming mighty.</p><p>“It seems somewhat like the demonic human clan’s demonic transformation.”</p><p>Ye Chen had some understanding that the demonic human clan’s demonic transformation ability actually came from the demon race’s unique ability. He wondered how powerful the demon race’s transformation was compared to demonic humans.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>After transforming, the fiendish man directly vanished amidst a flicker. He was already before Ye Chen the next instant, and the latter could only see a huge fist right before his eyes.</p><p>‘So fast!’ Ye Chen was startled.</p><p>The fiendish man’s strength had increased by several folds after transforming, and even Ye Chen’s soul power failed to completely lock his trajectory. He seemed to have disappeared and reappeared without a hint.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Raising the Sky Scorpio Sword, Ye Chen defended against the punch, causing sparks to fly. Spurting out a mouthful of blood, he was blasted dozens of li back. This punch had caused him light injuries. If not for the Sky Scorpio Sword, his injuries wouldn’t have been so light.</p><p>“Hehe, die!”</p><p>Upon transforming, the fiendish man’s strength had directly jumped a level, increasing from mid four star level to high four star level. Moreover, his movements and attack speed was far superior than usual high stage fours star Kings. He could easily suppress Kings of the same level.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>The fiendish man again disappeared and appeared within Ye Chen’s right.</p><p>“Sword Domain!”</p><p>High stage four star battle strength was a bit tricky for Ye Chen. However, he had second layer sword domain, which had an enormous suppression effect, and could slow down his opponent substantially.</p><p>“Eh!”</p><p>The fiendish man’s movements somewhat changed, and his fist seemed to have encountered an invisible barrier. Quickly grasping his chance, Ye Chen tilted his body and thrust his sword out. The Sword Domain increased the speed of his sword, creating a purple light arc.</p><p>“Dream on!”</p><p>The fiendish man opened his fist and the grabbed Sky Scorpio Sword before pulling at it.</p><p>Heh!</p><p>Ye Chen sneered and used the Vibrational Sword Arts, causing the Sky Scorpio Sword to vibrate. With his palm completely shredded, the fiendish man involuntarily released the sword from his hand and was instantly pierced through his chest. A deep scar appeared on his chest, but the sword couldn’t cut through his bones.</p><p>‘His bones are so strong?’ Ye Chen didn’t dare delay and instantly retreated.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>A black hole appeared where he stood a moment ago before the fiendish man slowly retracted his right fist.</p><p>“He actually has a battle skill comparable to my demonic race!”</p><p>The fiendish man’s face turned exceptionally grave. When the battle power of the two sides were more or less the same, the battle skills became the deciding factor. Battle skills contained many elements, including experience, reaction speed, instant decisions, and so on.</p><p>The wound on fiendish man’s body instantly healed; this bit of injury was irrelevant to him. Demonic race’s demonic body was a lot stronger than the spirit body. Moreover, under the transformed state, his defenses were exceptionally high. Ye Chen’s sword energy couldn’t spread to other regions of his body.</p><p>“The demonic race is terrifying indeed.”</p><p>Ye Chen was clear that despite the sword being caught by the fiendish man, the residual sword energy would have been enough to injure a human martial artist of the same level. However, the fiendish man seemed as if he didn’t care about it at all. From this, one could assume that the demonic race had innate advantages over the humankind. With the same battle strengths, the demonic race would inevitably hold the vast superiority. Their vastly superior defense was one such example.</p><p>“His sword domain should have attained the second layer.” Far away, the youngster was watching the battle between Ye Chen and Horned Demon.</p><p>Horned Demon’s battle strength was undoubtedly at high stage four star, and the sword move Ye Chen used had the same might as Horned Demon’s punch. Of course, the situation seemed under the former’s control.</p><p>“Sky Scorpio Sword is almost out of crystal energy!”</p><p>Looking down at the sword in his hand, Ye Chen was somewhat moved. Upon encountering danger, he had overworked the Sky Scorpio Sword several times in desperation, nerfing its might. If it still had its powerful crystalline energy, he didn’t believe that the fiendish man would have been completely unscathed.</p><p>“Once I succeed in creating the second style of Sky Shattering Sword Arts, I should focus on Sword Forging Art. With the supreme grade materials I have, I should be able to forge a sword not inferior to the Sky Scorpio Sword.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
