Be it an ordinary person or a martial artist, be it humans or other races, as long as one wasn’t sleeping, they could see the heavens raining down flower petals silently falling on the ground.</p><p>Petals rained down in the underwater palace as well.</p><p>“Flower Shower, birth of a King! He must have entered the Life and Death realm.” A chilling glare emitted from the eyes of the black-skinned powerhouse as he forced out every word through his teeth.</p><p>The horned blood figure remained silent for a few moments before speaking, “After entering the Life and Death realm, one could attain the state of being one with the heavens at any point, establishing a connection with the True Spirit World and inciting a response. However, not everybody can lead to the appearance of the heavenly flower upon entering the Life and Death realm. This phenomenon would only occur for talents with exceptional potential that could influence the future flow of events. The heavenly flower has four grades—white, tri-colored heavenly flower, penta-colored heavenly flower, and hepta-colored heavenly flower. Not even ten figures have incited a seven colored heavenly flower in the past thousand years. This kid can certainly influence future events. He must be eliminated.”</p><p>“I’ll have to leave this matter up to you.” The black-skinned powerhouse urged the horned blood figure again.</p><p>The latter said, “You can be rest assured. I’ve already connected with Nine Nethers. His Nine Nether Art can illuminate that kid’s shadow. I’ll have his whereabouts in no time.”</p><p>“Nine Nethers appeared?” The black skinned powerhouse’s eyes brightened.</p><p>“Right, he was the one to contact me, but he has changed to a new body, and his strength hasn’t fully restored.”</p><p>“Haha, the heavens are helping me! Although Nine Nethers strength is inferior to mine, his greatest superiority is the great Nine Nethers Art. If he had appeared earlier, we wouldn’t have had so much trouble, and that kid would have been eliminated long ago.” The black-skinned man exclaimed.</p><p>“Then, I’ll take my leave.” The horned blood figure’s body scattered, and the blood stone stopped glowing.</p><p>“Nine Nethers is separated by a few decades. I wonder what his current appearance is like. If you had heeded my advice back then and acted more covertly, you wouldn’t have been chased by Dragon King and Mysterious Queen and lost your body.” The black-skinned powerhouse mumbled to himself.</p><p>…</p><p>“What a pretty flower!”</p><p>A couple of dozen years old boys and girls in the Ye Family grounds halted their cultivation and stretched their hands out, grabbing the seven-colored petals raining down the sky. The petals directly passed their hands and fell on the ground, instantly disappearing without a sound.</p><p>“Xiaoxiao, don’t you think these flowers give a very familiar feeling?” A handsome looking teen turned to the girl beside him and said.</p><p>Despite the girl’s young age, her body had already developed. She nodded, “This is a very strange feeling for me. These flowers remind me of eldest brother.”</p><p>“Ah, you also feel the same?” The youngster was a bit amazed.</p><p>…</p><p>Chaotic Demon Ocean, Demonic Lotus Island…</p><p>“It’s Ye Chen!”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng was surrounded by falling seven-colored petals. Dressed in a gorgeous black robe, the beautiful Demonic Human Emperor walked over and said, “If this is your darling or not is yet to be seen, but if you don’t try harder, you won’t even have the qualifications to chase after him.”</p><p>She felt extremely moved. In a few years, a tiny ant had matured into a powerhouse of the same level as her. Although his battle strength was still a lot lacking compared to hers, in terms of standing, they were already equal. In some time, those who could threaten him would become increasingly sparse.</p><p>She was somewhat glad that she wasn’t hostile back then, or she would have created a great enemy. Of course, if she wanted to be hostile, she wouldn’t have allowed him to escape.</p><p>“Teacher!” Murong Qingcheng turned around, her voice carrying a trace of reverence. During these years, Demonic Human Emperor had wholeheartedly helped her improve her strength. If not for her, she couldn’t have reached the peak of life-and-death-chamber’s third layer without entering the Life and Death Secret realm.</p><p>“I have something to tell you. Your little darling has already caught the attention of otherworldly powerhouses.” With a faint nod, Demonic Human Emperor told something extremely worrying for Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>“Is it the Demon Race?” Murong Qingcheng firmly clenched her fists.</p><p>“Yes, but you don’t have to worry. Your little darling is still alive, which means his survival ability is really powerful. The recent flower shower is most likely him entering the Life and Death realm, so if you have worry about something, it’s entering Life and Death realm yourself.”</p><p>Demonic Human Emperor told Murong Qingcheng this information because she wanted to create a sense of urgency in her. As for why she wanted her to become strong, it was partially because she didn’t want to see her potential being wasted, but more so because she wanted to have a figure in the demonic human race whose words would carry some weight.</p><p>She alone would not be able to protect the Demonic Human Clan in the imminent times of turbulence after all.</p><p>“I’ll enter the Life and Death realm.” Murong Qingcheng firmly nodded, her bright eyes filled with determination.</p><p>“Good, you can continue cultivating!” Demonic Human Emperor turned around and left. As she was leaving, she inwardly pondered, ‘Why do I feel Qingcheng influencing the fate of the demonic human clan? Could it be because of him?’</p><p>She shook her head before her figure flickered and disappeared.</p><p>…</p><p>In the depths of the void was a secret realm, with a golden pond inside. From within the pond, a beautiful naked figure emerged. Her two erect breasts were indistinct in the golden water; her long black moist hair were stuck to her shoulders, highlighting her white skin.</p><p>Reaching out her hands, the woman touched the falling seven-colored petals, which went straight through her palm.</p><p>“Junior brother Ye, you’ve finally entered the Life and Death realm.” The woman was none other than Xu Jing. Delight appeared on her face, and her entire being visibly relaxed.</p><p>“I’ll also try to enter Life and Death realm with all my strength.”</p><p>Her body again dove into the golden water, leaving behind trailing snow-white legs above the water for a moment, painting an alluring picture.</p><p>…</p><p>The black-skinned man could feel Ye Chen entering Life and Death realm because he was the main perpetrator of the whole event. Ye Xuan and Ye Xaoxao could faintly feel his presence because they were siblings, while Murong Qingcheng and Xu Jing could sense him because they shared a deep emotional connection. However, there was one more person who knew that the Flower Shower was incited by Ye Chen.</p><p>And that person was was Mysterious Queen.</p><p>After all, the Abstruse Dao was an exceptionally mysterious dao.</p><p>By the pond, she watched the flowers, but didn’t reach out to grab them. These flowers were the manifestation of True Spirit World’s great dao; they could be seen but not touched. They were an incorporeal existence just like the laws.</p><p>“Old Dragon King, you can now rest assured. Ye Chen has already matured. In the upcoming chaos, he will certainly be a leading figure. Perhaps he could eliminate those otherworldly powerhouses one after another and really restore True Spirit Continent to its ancient peak.”</p><p>Bending her waist, she continued to feed fishes. Soon, her figure blended into the surroundings, as if turning into a picture.</p><p>…</p><p>The entire world was stunned. A few decades ago, seven colored flowers appeared, and the world learnt of Mysterious Queen, who became a reputed peak King shortly after.</p><p>Who was it this time?</p><p>The heavenly shower continued for a short while, then disappeared without a trace. However, nobody noticed a wisp of black-and-white sword scar stretching across the whole True Spirit World, faintly interacting with the Sky Sword at the center of Sky Sword Continent. The Sky Sword faintly shook, emitting a sword cry as if bellowing in fury. However, in the end, it couldn’t do anything but restrain itself.</p><p>…</p><p>In the Sea of Soul realm, one would attain the state of being one-with-the-heavens for a short while with every minor realm increase. However, upon entering Life and Death realm, one could enter one-with-the-heavens state at any point, allowing one’s profound to ameliorate by leaps and bounds.</p><p>Although comprehending profound became increasingly difficult at higher stages, it shouldn’t be overlooked that Ye Chen’s soul was ten times more powerful than ordinary Kings. In theory, his comprehension should also be ten times higher. Therefore, in half a month of seclusion, his profound greatly progressed in every aspect.</p><p>First was the space profound.</p><p>The space profound was one of the strongest profound and was several times harder to improve than other profounds. Thus, the improvement could not be too big. However, with Four Extreme Emperor’s basics of space profound, it reached seventy percent completion.</p><p>Then came the metal profound and water profound, both of which directly reached ninety percent completion, only a step away from full circle. Of course, this step was exceptionally hard to take. Many couldn’t complete full circle of one profound in decades. Even with Ye Chen’s comprehension talent, he could expect several years to take this step.</p><p>Wood profound also reached ninety percent completion from sixty percent, while the quick profound reached eighty percent completion from fifty percent. Shadow profound reached seventy percent completion from minor completion, and lastly, the hardest profound that Ye Chen couldn’t comprehend, the slow profound, was also closing in on minor completion.</p><p>With profounds improving in every aspect, Ye Chen’s battle strength naturally soared like rising tides. Previously, he couldn’t grasp his own battle strength, and basically guessed it to be peak three star or tyrant three star. However, at this moment, he was sure that it had attained four star level.</p><p>Four star battle strength represented peak Kings.</p><p>Of course, there were high-and-low amongst peak Kings. Ye Chen’s current strength was probably above lower ranks of peak Kings, but it wasn’t too likely to reach peak four star or tyrant four star.</p><p>“I’m afraid the Bewitching Mirror Destruction can’t use the seventy percent space profound to its limits. I need to create a new space profound sword move.”</p><p>Bewitching Mirror Shattering was extremely powerful, but now Ye Chen needed to create a space profound sword move that was even more powerful. This was no easy task; however, he had long since decided to delegate Bewitching Mirror Shattering and another yet-to-be-created space profound sword move to a new series of sword arts that would be focused on space profound.</p><p>“Let’s call it Sky Shattering Sword Arts!” Ye Chen immediately decided on a name.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
