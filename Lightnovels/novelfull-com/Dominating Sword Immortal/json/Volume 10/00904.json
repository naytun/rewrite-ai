In the Sea of Soul realm, one could project their soul power a hundred li away from their body, but this number increased by ten folds in Life and Death realm, reaching a thousand li. Moreover, one’s proficiency over soul power in Life and Death realm greatly increased, allowing one to cover ten thousand li. However, Ye Chen’s limits were even ten folds that of other Kings, reaching a hundred thousand li.</p><p>And it was through normal means of spreading soul power which every King could employ. Some secret soul arts allowed even ordinary King’s soul perception to a hundred thousand li, which was nothing to be surprised about. If Ye Chen could learn any of such soul amplification art, his soul perception could easily cover a million li. With but a thought, he could sense every grass moving and wind blowing within a million li.</p><p>However, soul perception was merely a minor affair before the amplification his soul eye received after his soul evolved to Life and Death level. Previously, his soul eye could only see within ten million li, and could hardly sense Life and Death Kings. However, at this moment, he could see anything within a billion li.</p><p>“I wonder how many times I can use the soul eye now? And to what extent soul eye’s might has increased?”</p><p>With a sharp increase in soul power, the number of times he could use soul eye must have surpassed two, and its ability must have augmented as well.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Mthe masked man’s eyes overflowed with killing intent once Ye Chen passed the calamity. He thrusted his palm forth from afar, blasting a four-layered lightning fire energy.</p><p>“Merak Hammer!”</p><p>“Gale Slash!”</p><p>“Iron Arm Smash!”</p><p>Beard King, Gray Bird King, and Ironarm King immediately used their most powerful moves as well. This time, they would not give any chance for Ye Chen to escape.</p><p>Confronting four Kings’ combined assaults, Ye Chen didn’t back down. The silver eye underneath his forehead opened and released a silver beam at the masked man. This silver beam was far more powerful than the previous one used against Primordial Slaughter King. As soon as it appeared, it invaded the masked man’s Sea of Soul like a sharp blade. At the same time, Ye Chen raised the Evil Shattering Sword in his left hand and blocked Beard King’s spiraling hammer light while raising the Sky Scorpio Sword in his right hand and thrusting it at the four layered fist energy of the masked man. As for Gray Bird King and Ironarm King’s attacks, he didn’t dodge them, but faced them straight with his body.</p><p>Ah!</p><p>Peng! Peng!</p><p>Puff!</p><p>The first to suffer was the masked man. Confronting Ye Chen’s soul light, half of his Sea of Soul collapsed directly, causing him pain from the depths of his soul. As a result, he couldn’t help but let out a miserable shriek. His entire being seemed to have entered a deranged state.</p><p>Beard King’s spiraling hammer light was counteracted by Ye Chen, but the masked man’s four-layered palm energy destroyed the latter’s sword energy and smashed onto his body. Blood splattered amidst huge lightning fire sparks. In the next moment, Ye Chen, who couldn’t dodge the other attacks in time, was struck again. Amidst the cries of his bronze armor, half of his body directly turned into blood mist.</p><p>If he had still been in the limb regrowth realm, Ye Chen would have instantly died upon losing half of his body. Fortunately, the boundless Yuan Qi pouring into his body had not only increased his Zhen Yuan, but also evolved his Undying Body. It instantly caused his Undying Body to reach the peak of the limb regrowth realm, allowing it to subsequently break through into the initial stages of blood derivation realm.</p><p>Amidst squirming blood Qi, Ye Chen’s lost half of the body rapidly recovered. However, this caused his newly formed Zhen Yuan to directly evaporate. Fortunately, the Yuan Qi contained within the Yuan Qi sphere was too rich, and he had only absorbed one-tenth of it. The very next moment, more Yuan Qi poured into his body as an endless stream.</p><p>“One use of soul light actually emptied a fifth of my soul power. But, my soul power had a twenty fold increase!” Ye Chen felt a bit amazed. “This is fine too. The might soul eye has become really frightening.”</p><p>The masked man had a three star battle strength, but he was still injured at the very foundation of his soul. It would be exceptionally hard for him to completely recover, and his future battle strength would be greatly reduced. He should be grateful if he could even preserve sixty-seventy percent of his battle strength. After all, a soul injury and an injury to the soul’s foundation were two different things. The former could naturally heal with time, but the latter required extremely rare soul nurturing treasures, which might not be available even if one scoured through the entire True Spirit World.</p><p>It could be said that a single soul light from Ye Chen had more or less ruined the masked man.</p><p>The masked man with only sixty-seventy percent of his original strength most likely had lower three star battle strength, which might not even be stronger than Copper Sword King’s. How could he still have his previous awe-inspiring aura?</p><p>In addition, one couldn’t underestimate the soul light since it couldn’t directly kill the masked man, as its effect was too frightening. Ye Chen didn’t just have the soul assault at his disposal, as his battle strength was even more frightening. How could the masked man, who was suffering a heavy soul injury, face Ye Chen’s direct assault?</p><p>“Impossible! His soul didn’t weaken one bit!” Gray Bird King’s eyes wide opened.</p><p>“He tricked us. He was certainly putting on a show for us, trying to lure us in.” Beard King clenched his teeth so hard that they almost broke. If Ye Chen’s soul had been injured, he would never have been able to unleash such a powerful soul assault. Moreover, a weakened soul implied a poor state of one’s body. In such a condition, he could never have blocked an all-out strike of Beard King and counteracted the greater part of the masked man’s four-layered palm energy. It was quite clear that his condition was not weakened, but had instead improved a lot.</p><p>Gu! Gu!</p><p>The Yuan Qi within the Yuan Qi sphere poured in Ye Chen’s body through the top of his head like a sparkling stream of river and instantly transformed into King grade Zhen Yuan. As Zhen Yuan inside his body increased, he could feel that he’d become strong enough to shatter space with a swing of his hand.</p><p>Raising the two forefingers of his right hand, he suddenly pointed at Gray Brd King. With that action, the Sixth step destruction sword intent coupled with king grade Zhen Yuan gushed out.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>A blood hole appeared at Gray Bird King’s forehead, opening at the back of his head.</p><p>One finger, and Gray Bird King died!</p><p>“Too powerful!”</p><p>Not just Beard King, even the hot-blooded Ironarm King couldn’t help but think about escaping right now, completely losing his confidence against Ye Chen. The current him could no longer be compared with the previous one, who was a frightening genius that had yet to mature. Although he was frightening and could put up a fight against them, they at least had a real shot at killing him. However, at this moment, Ye Chen had already entered the Life and Death realm. Killing him would be as hard as mounting the heavens. If the former could keep his life, that would already be fortunate enough.</p><p>“Escape!”</p><p>Beard King and Ironarm King shattered the space and escaped, pushing their speed to the limits.</p><p>“You think you can escape? You think this is a game?”</p><p>Ye Chen sneered. With the Evil Shattering Sword and Sky Scorpio Sword in each hand, he casually slashed. Two congealing water sword energies shattered the space and instantly caught up to the two escaping Kings, smashing into their bodies.</p><p>Beard King’s figure stopped and looked down. The half supreme grade armor at his chest had a huge hole, opening at his back. His heart had been destroyed into nothingness. Ironarm King’s defenses were a lot stronger than the other’s. However, he was fatally wounded nonetheless. All of his internal organs had almost shattered. How could he, who was merely at limb regeneration realm, endure congealing water sword energy that contained a king grade Zhen Yuan? Not dying could already be considered an achievement for him. Of course, the sword energy had been slightly reduced due to the spatial barrier, or his end would have been the same as Beard King.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>With another sword energy, Ironarm King followed in the footsteps of Gray Bird King and Beard King.</p><p>“Eh? The Undying Body improved again?”</p><p>Upon killing ironarm King, Ye Chen felt his understanding of his Undying Body deepening. This deepening of understanding came completely naturally. The moment he’d broken through into Life and Death realm, his comprehension of life and death had deepened a lot. Others were also the same while breaking through into this realm, only their improvement was not as high as his.</p><p>The Undying Body continued to improve up to the mid stages of blood derivation realm before stopping due to insufficient comprehension.</p><p>“Alright, seems like this a complete failure.” At this moment, the masked man finally sobered up. His face was extremely pale, devoid of any light. His expression was gloomy and filled with resentment.</p><p>“The hunter becomes the hunted. You should be able to understand this, no?”</p><p>Ye Chen was still receiving Yuan Qi from the Yuan Qi sphere. The king grade Zhen Yuan in his body was continually increasing, becoming increasingly richer. He didn’t fear that the masked man would escape, and hence didn’t immediately attack.</p><p>“Humph, no need to feel complacent! Let me tell you a secret…The Battle King from five hundred years ago died at the hands of my superiors. If you pledge your allegiance to them, you might have a chance.” The masked man’s pupils shrunk as he quickly calculated.</p><p>“As expected…”</p><p>Hearing his words, Ye Chen could finally be sure that senior Battle King had died at the hands of the otherworldlings. This masked man’s backing must be an otherworldly powerhouse.</p><p>“What do you think? Although your current strength is higher than mine, it’s nothing like Battle King. A wise man submits to circumstances. Why not take the control of your life into your hands?”</p><p>Seeing that Ye Chen had not attacked, the masked man assumed that the former was hesitating.</p><p>Ye Chen replied, “Like you said, my life is in my control. If your superiors want to kill me, they will have to check if they have the capabilities. If they don’t, I wouldn’t mind purging your otherworldly superiors into a river of blood, leaving none behind.”</p><p>“You’re courting death! I advise you to think carefully.”</p><p>“No need to think. As for you, you don’t have to concern yourself with my affairs.” With a final rumble, the Yuan Qi sphere completely poured into Ye Chen’s body, taking his cultivation base to an awe-inspiring ninety years. Adding the Zhen Yuan he’d lost previously to operate the Undying Body, his current cultivation base was at a hundred years.</p><p>To have a hundred year cultivation base the moment one entered Life and Death realm was an affair that had not occurred in tens of thousands of years.</p><p>“What a rich Zhen Yuan!” The masked man’s Zhen Yuan was richer than Ye Chen, but the latter had just entered Life and Death realm!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
