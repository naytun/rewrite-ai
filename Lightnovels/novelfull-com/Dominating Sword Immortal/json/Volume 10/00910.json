The blue light sphere sped forth, and the two followed it without a word.</p><p>“Eh, he is right ahead?”</p><p>The youngster was somewhat shocked. He didn’t think Ye Chen would stop. But a few moments later, the two’s face turned extremely unsightly.</p><p>Ye Chen had clearly found the flaw of Nine Nether Soul Search, leaving behind a Zhen Yuan afterimage. This afterimage contained extremely low Zhen Yuan and had no battle power. However, since it contained his aura, the blue light sphere was attracted to it. The blue light sphere couldn’t sense life force ripples, and thus, ended up being completely useless.</p><p>Shattering the Zhen Yuan afterimage with a punch, the fiendish man gravely said, “He actually escaped!”</p><p>“It was my mistake. I should have sealed the space from the beginning.” However, the youngster was still skeptical. He believed that even if he’d tightened the space, they might not have been able to stop Ye Chen. That sword move of Ye Chen was exceptionally powerful, and had a frightening piercing power.</p><p>“No need to blame yourself. I was careless too.”</p><p>The fiendish man’s heart brimmed with concern. The current Ye Chen was much more frightening than Mysterious Queen from back in the day. Through his battle with Ye Chen, he realized that even if the two of them had made a foolproof plan and instantly acted with all their might, they could have, at most, injured Ye Chen, and not kill him. Never did he expect that a little ant would grow to such an extent that they couldn’t do anything to him within such a short time.</p><p>“Sigh! If my strength had recovered a bit more, this would have turned out differently.” The youngster sighed and continued, “Black Stone is too cautious. If he’d acted himself from the very beginning, this would have never happened.”</p><p>The fiendish man remained silent. Sometimes, he also felt that Black Stone was too prudent, which was the exact opposite of the lunatic Nine Nethers. If the two of them merged, that would be perfection.</p><p>Of course, he could understand Black Stone’s thoughts. Lifting the seal off the Lords was Black their main objective. Black Stone didn’t wish to create troubles on the side, and thus, refrained from acting personally. Moreover, who could have expected that Ye Chen’s progress would be quick to the extent of defying rules, catching them off-guard!</p><p>“No use in talking about these things now.” The fiendish man shook his head.</p><p>“Indeed!” The youngster beckoned and said, “This kid’s wings have grown too fast. We failed to kill him now, and it will only become harder to kill him later. I am not willing to continue chasing after him. It would be too big of a waste of manpower.”</p><p>The fiendish man measured Nine Nethers with a strange gaze. He didn’t expect the latter to show such a stable side. Perhaps the setbacks of the past had caused him to change a lot. Perhaps they owed it to Dragon King and Mysterious Queen, or there was even a chance that he would have ruined their grand plan.</p><p>Of course, this had been Black Stone’s evaluation of Nine Nethers.</p><p>“I will talk to Black Stone. I believe he will not be willing to waste too much manpower on chasing after Ye Chen.”</p><p>Not chasing after Ye Chen didn’t mean that they had given up on killing him. They merely didn’t wish to waste too much of their energy, causing them to lose more than what they would gain. If they had the opportunity, they would not hesitate and kill Ye Chen with full force. It was just like Mysterious Queen, as they would not mind killing her as long as there was an opportunity. Unfortunately, they had yet to find one.</p><p>‘”I’m convinced that Black Stone’s thought process is the same as mine. Ye Chen alone might not be able to create even a dent in our plan. Once the Lords are unsealed, even ten Ye Chens wouldn’t matter. At that point, anything under six star battle strength would make no difference.” The youngster sneered.</p><p>“I hope that will be the case.”</p><p>The fiendish man felt that Nine Nether’s words were reasonable. No matter how fast Ye Chen’s progress had been, once he attained five star battle strength, his improvement would inevitably slow down. Back in the day, Mysterious Queen had also gained four star battle strength soon after entering Life and Death realm. However, her strength only increased by one star in the next decade. Ye Chen was more monstrous than Mysterious Queen, and he might attain high stage five star strength, or even peak five star strength, but six star would be nothing but pipe dream. He simply didn’t have enough time.</p><p>“Nine Nethers, you don’t want to join us?” Setting Ye Chen aside, the fiendish man turned to the youngster.</p><p>The latter shook his head and said, “You folks have your plans, and I have mine. Combined, there is no assurance, but separated, the chances of success are much higher. Never put all your eggs in one basket…you should understand this reasoning.”</p><p>“That’s unfortunate! If you were to join us, our plan would come to fruition much sooner.” The fiendish man was exceptionally clear of Nine Nethers’ ability, and thus, couldn’t help but lament.</p><p>“Alright, this chase is over. I’ll be heading back. If there is nothing important, we better not meet again.” The youngster stepped forth as his body turned into a blue ray and shot across the sky.</p><p>“I better find a safe location first.” The fiendish man opened the space and headed toward the ocean bed of the boundless ocean.</p><p>An hour later, two powerful auras arrived. One was an alluring woman; she had an enchanting figure with two towering peaks, a slender waistline, two long legs that made two-thirds of her height, and exceptionally high and curved buttocks. In other words, she was a demoness that could make men go crazy. The other figure had a sharp aura like that of sword aura, and had an appearance of a middle-aged man dressed in scholarly robes.</p><p>The auras of these two were far more powerful than the two Demonic Kings. If Ye Chen had been here, he would have certainly felt extreme danger, and would have rather opted to approach them.</p><p>“Azure Sky Sword Emperor, you felt demonic race’s aura too, right?” The alluring woman took the initiative to speak.</p><p>“Indeed!” The middle-aged man nodded.</p><p>“We’re late.” The alluring woman cleared a few strands of hair falling on her forehead. As her beautiful brows knitted into a frown, one couldn’t help but feel pity from deep within.</p><p>“This means that the great battle is nearing. Killing these small fries doesn’t mean a thing. We have to find their headquarters and completely get rid of them in one swoop”</p><p>“I’m afraid that wouldn’t be so easy. Although the more powerful they are, the greater their injuries were after forcefully crossing the world barrier, there have been a lot of them crossing the world barrier in the past few years. If my guess is not wrong, they plan to unseal those freakishly strong powerhouses that had been sealed for countless years. Although these otherworldly suffer grave injuries from Yuan Qi, they could slowly recover with their otherworldly treasures. However, the most frightening aspect is that the longer they live here, the lesser rejection from True Spirit World they would have to endure. Once they completely remove this shackle and completely restore their cultivation bases, it would be a disaster for our True Spirit World.”</p><p>“We have no choice in this matter. Like raising vermin, we can only hope to increase our strength, or there is no hope.” The middle-aged man’s eyes were cold and seemed completely devoid of emotions.</p><p>“Seems like we can only wait and see. I’ll take my leave here.”The alluring woman turned around and entered the space. Her body flickered, and she was already several hundred thousand li away.</p><p>“The chaos is coming. I wonder how many Kings are going to fall.” The middle-aged man raised his head to look at the sky, then merged with the void.</p><p>…</p><p>“You and Nine Nethers joined hands and still couldn’t kill him?” Inside the underwater palace, the black-skinned powerhouse looked at Horned Demon’s figure beside him as he spoke gloomily.</p><p>The figure of Horned Demon was a will projection transmitted through the blood stone. He slowly said, “This kid has mastered the space profound. His battle power and escape ability are both top-notch. I’m afraid that nobody under five star stage can stop him, and even ordinary five star Kings don’t have much of a chance. Only five star Kings specializing in speed will do the trick.”</p><p>Battle power and speed were related, but not too tightly. A powerful five star King might not be faster than a four star King. After all, battle power mainly reflected the killing power.</p><p>“Black Stone, this kid has already matured. No need to waste so much manpower on him.” Horned Demon’s blood figure suggested.</p><p>After a few moments of silence, the black-skinned powerhouse faintly nodded, “It was me being too cautious. Since that’s the case, we give up on pursuing him! Next, we put all our attention on unsealing the Lords.”</p><p>The black-skinned powerhouse felt a bit helpless. Back in the day, they had to give up on Mysterious Queen, and now, history seemed to have repeated itself. He couldn’t help but admit that their grasp on True Spirit Continent was still far lacking.</p><p>…</p><p>Using the space profound, Ye Chen’s speed had reached an inconceivable degree. Shuttling in the void, he seemed incorporeal like a cloud of spatial energy. After a while, he finally stopped.</p><p>“After reaching the Life and Death realm, I can finally employ some of the fine applications of space profound, including incorporating space profound in body arts. I couldn’t do it before.”</p><p>As one of the strongest profound, space profound required an equally good control power, which was directly related to the state of mind.</p><p>“My battle strength should be in the high stages of four star. The Demonic King who fought me also had high stage four star battle strength, and was overall a bit stronger than me. But with Orbital Strike, I might have been the winner. However, adding that seemingly unfathomable youngster, I had no chance.”</p><p>Ye Chen felt that although the youngster’s aura was weaker than the fiendish man, his gaze seemed extremely frightening, as if he could see through one’s soul. Battle strength was not that straightforward. For example, Ye Chen felt that the youngster was stronger than the fiendish man, and his strength lay in the state of mind.</p><p>“Unfortunately, Orbital Strike is not complete, and it will probably take some time. Seems like I have to create other styles with simpler nature and increase my battle power.”</p><p>“Autumn Water Sword Arts is out of the question, as my metal profound and water profound have already reached greater completion. To create a sword move containing two grand profounds at greater completion is even harder than the Orbital Strike.”</p><p>One on one, seventy percent space profound was naturally superior to both metal profound and water profound, more or less equivalent to two hundred ten percent completion of metal and water profounds individually. However, when these two profounds were combined, the difficulty to incorporate them into a sword move increased by ten folds, and its might would be far superior to Orbital Strike. Although Ye Chen’s comprehension was ten times that of ordinary people, it didn’t mean that he could create powerful moves as he pleased.</p><p>Since Autumn Sword Arts was out of question, he could only turn to Vibrational Sword Arts.</p><p>Vibrational Sword Art’s first style was the Sky Cutting Sword. If he could create the second style, its might would certainly surpass the half-finished Orbital Strike, which could be a great help to the current him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
