If Ye Chen walked across to kill them, they feared that wouldn’t even be able to muster a response. The disparity of their wills compared to Ye Chen’s was too big. Amongst them, Beard King’s will was a bit stronger, but still at the mid fifth step, while the wills of Gray Bird King and Ironarm King were merely at the peak of the fourth step. On the other hand, Ye Chen’s Destruction Sword Intent had already reached the sixth step, which was equivalent to seventh step ordinary sword intent, two-three steps higher than theirs. How could they endure this seemingly ordinary yet tyrannical will suppression?</p><p>“Pursuing Thunder King, this kid is a bit abnormal!”</p><p>Gray Bird King couldn’t help but develop thoughts of retreating. Even before entering Life and Death realm, Ye Chen could have such a utilization of will. Once he reached Life and Death realm, a single gaze of his might be enough to leave him paralyzed.</p><p>“He is indeed a bit abnormal, but he still has to go through the godly Yuan calamity.”</p><p>In reality, Beard King also felt a bit discouraged. However, with Pursuing Thunder King, he felt that Ye Chen basically had no chance. It should be known that the latter’s battle strength was at the three star level, and at the peak of the third star’s mid stage at that. Adding three of them, they could even fight a high stage three star battle strength King.</p><p>“Beard King is right. Since the ancient times, godly Yuan calamity has always weakened the soul of the martial artist for a while. The moment his soul gets weakened, the four of us will use our strongest moves. It should be more than enough to kill him.”</p><p>Ironarm King was a body refiner, and thus, had the most imposing manner. Although Ye Chen could make his body stiffen with a gaze, it was not enough to make him back down.</p><p>“Alright, we’re here on a mission to kill Ye Chen. If we fail, what will we say upon returning? Especially when he is about to enter Life and Death Realm. Once he enters Life and Death realm, his battle strength will certainly be not below mine, and could even be above mine. At that time, we’ll have to worry about a bigger trouble than Mysterious Queen.” The masked man coldly said.</p><p>Ye Chen didn’t know what the four Kings were thinking, nor did he care. Retracting his gaze, he pondered, ‘One already has a certain understanding of life and death in the Life and Death realm, increasing one’s grasp over will by several folds. No wonder even though body refiners are unreasonably strong, they are a notch below Kings with strong wills since the ancient times.’</p><p>During the life and death calamity, the body itself would gain some enlightenment, improving one’s being in all aspects. This was also the reason Ye Chen could finally defeat the heart demon.</p><p>“The Godly Yuan calamity has arrived!”</p><p>A frightening will pressure spread out of the black hole, causing Ye Chen to raise his head and look.</p><p>The three calamities of life and death had no distinctions of being superior or inferior. But from the standpoint of danger, the heart demon of wind fire calamity was extremely dangerous, yet the godly Yuan calamity was even more dangerous. The slightest of negligence could result in grave soul injury, which would require a lot of time to recover from. Many experts would have their soul weakened by a substantial amount after passing the calamity, causing their state of mind to drop.</p><p>Hu! Hu!</p><p>A whirlwind blew downwards. This whirlwind was not some normal wind; it could not be heard through the ears but through the soul. This was the prelude to godly Yuan calamity—the Soul Whirlwind.</p><p>The whirlwind was exceptionally quick and offered almost no time to react as it swept through Ye Chen’s body. However, his face remained calm and unchanged. If a mere soul whirlwind could cause him trouble, he might as well give up on passing the calamity.</p><p>“Such a frightening soul membrane!” The masked man coldly snorted. When he’d faced the soul whirlwind, it had caused a frown to appear on his face. However, Ye Chen stood as if he’d faced a light breeze.</p><p>“After the soul whirlwind comes the soul storm. Let’s see if he can still be as unconcerned.” Gray Bird King had been thinking of retreating before, and thus, felt a bit embarrassed. At this moment, he intentionally showed his disdain.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The soul storm’s aura was much more powerful than the soul whirlwind. The rumbling of the storm could be directly felt in the depths of the soul of all five. Compared to soul storms they had faced, the soul storm Ye Chen was facing seemed excessively strong.</p><p>Ye Chen was disregarding the soul storm, but seeing Gray Bird King’s expression, a different idea formed in his head.</p><p>The Soul storm swarmed Ye Chen, unceasingly assaulting his soul membrane and attacking several hundred times within a breath like a tidal wave battering a coast. Suddenly he let out a muffled groan, and his face turned a bit pale.</p><p>“Sure enough, he is somewhat suffering from the assault of soul storm.” Gray Bird King smiled complacently.</p><p>As the might of soul storm increased, Ye Chen’s face turned increasingly pale; his eyebrows scrunched together and his gaze intermittently flickered. After quite a while, the soul storm dissipated, leaving behind big beads of perspiration on his forehead.</p><p>“This time, we’ll easily succeed!”</p><p>Beard King and Ironarm King also relaxed quite a bit. Ye Chen’s frightening gaze had evoked a bit of fear in them, but at this moment, it vanished like smoke.</p><p>“Is this kid acting?” The masked man was suspicious. The soul storm Ye Chen faced was indeed a lot stronger than what he’d face, but he still felt a bit of unrest in his heart.</p><p>Godly Yuan calamity usually had three waves of attack. After the soul whirlwind and soul storm came the strongest assault.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>A soul general completely made of soul power raised its huge machete and struck at Ye Chen. Before him, his blade aura had already reached: the soul blade Qi.</p><p>Ye Chen remained unmoved, allowing the soul blade Qi to slash at his soul membrane. He had no defensive soul skills, nor any offensive soul arts except for his innate skill. Therefore, he could only face the soul assault head-on with his soul membrane.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Formless sparks flew outside his soul membrane.</p><p>“Powerful!”</p><p>Ye Chen felt ripples coming from his soul membrane.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The soul general issued three consecutive beams of blade Qi, which assaulted his soul membrane from three different angles.</p><p>“Soul storm!”</p><p>Not having any offensive soul arts didn’t mean that he had to passively endure. A storm surged inside his Sea of Soul and a wave of soul power spiraled out. This was the true soul storm.</p><p>His comprehensive ability was exceptionally strong. The soul storm of godly Yuan calamity allowed him to grasp the method of using the soul storm. Although it was not as perfect as the calamity’s soul storm, he was on the right path.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The soul blade Qi incessantly weakened through the soul storm and was basically powerless by the time it reached the soul membrane. Hence, it couldn’t even budge Ye Chen. However, he still revealed a troubled expression. His face turned completely pale and his mental state seemed to have declined a lot.</p><p>The soul general was persistent. Seeing that soul blade Qi be ineffective, it closed the distance, intending to fight close-range with its huge machete.</p><p>“This is troublesome!” Ye Chen frowned and again used the soul storm.</p><p>The soul general didn’t have thoughts, and even if he had, it couldn’t have known that fighting close range would only make Ye Chen more relaxed. Being battered by the soul storm, its soul body started to turn loose and thin.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
