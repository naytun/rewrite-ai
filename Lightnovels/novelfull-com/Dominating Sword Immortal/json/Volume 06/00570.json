Each one of them had the power of a top master level warrior. Although Du Gujue and Dantai Mingyue were already rather powerful, they were still rather young. They did not have enough time to accumulate experiences. Compared to the top five warriors, there was still quite a bit of gap in power.</p><p>The top young warriors were all so powerful that it was almost impossible to tell how exactly powerful they were. Even the top Sea of Souls Realm master level warriors would not dare to underestimate them. Two years ago, the blade art master level warrior Shen Qianlang had been beaten by one of the two five young warriors Xiao Chuhe. Because of this, a lot of the top of the top warriors in all regions chose to avoid them as well. They were afraid that their reputation would be ruined. So, if it were not extremely necessary, they would not take on the top five young warriors.</p><p>Bai Wuxue was indeed one of the five, his power level unbelievable. According to the legend, he was the only one in his twenties who had managed to walk out of the Cry Blood Ghost Region, which was a king warrior level forbidden place. Without the king level power, it would be impossible for anyone to walk out. Therefore, Bai Wuxue was a special exception.</p><p>\"Bai Wuxue, we have already left the Sky Martial Pavilion hundred miles away. Please, just let us do what we are supposed to do.\" Lin Ku did not want to let go of the great opportunity.</p><p>Bai Wuxue said lightly, \"Even your brother Lin Tian would not dare to ask me to do so, but you as the younger brother would somehow be so brave to ask, eh?\"</p><p>Hearing him, Lin Ku's face sank.</p><p>He was the second successor of the Lin family, which was one of the top four families; his elder brother, Lin Tian, was the first one in line. The two of them shared the same father, but different mothers. Nevertheless, somehow, their talent was equally powerful. But, since Lin Ku had only obtained his reputation a few years ago, and his brother was way higher than him in both reputation and power, the latter was the number one warrior who was most likely to join the top five young warriors.</p><p>\"Lin Ku, let's go!\" Duan Lengya started to consider leaving. Bargaining with Bai Wuxue would not be wise, as the weak did not have the right to bargain with the powerful. Compared to the top young warriors, they would be the weak ones, which was something that could not be changed.</p><p>The four brought Yuwen Jie, who was rather severely wounded, along and started to fly into the distance. Soon, they disappeared completely into the horizon.</p><p>\"Bai Wuxue, we did not ask you for your help.\"</p><p>Yan Fengfeng did not treat Bai Wuxue much better than anyone else. Others might be afraid of the top five young warriors, but she was not. With her extremely fast speed, the top five young warriors could not do anything to her as long as the distance between them was not that close.</p><p>Bai Wuxue had a vague smile on his face, which was rare for him, \"What? You think I was helping you? Actually, your power is just as much as theirs. I just don't like them.\"</p><p>\"Hehe…You don't really hide your feelings, do you?\" Yan Fengfeng started to chuckle, but Bai Wuxue's answer obviously pleased her.</p><p>\"Which one of you is Ye Chen?\" Bai Wuxue scanned around before focusing on Ye Chen.</p><p>Ye Chen did not know what he meant, so he answered, \"I am.\"</p><p>\"Oh!\" Bai Wuxue nodded. He did not have any particular thing with Ye Chen; it was just that he had seen Ye Chen's name on the wall in purple, which had surprised him slightly.</p><p>\"Du Gujue, Dantai Mingyue, Ye Chen…It seems that our top five warriors' thrones are shaking now.\" He smiled brightly before flashing once and turning into a white shadow, flying into the distance without a sound like a ghost.</p><p>Yan Fengfeng turned his head and said, \"Among the top five young warriors, Bai Wuxue is the friendliest one, and has killed the least number of people.\"</p><p>Ye Chen nodded, \"I could feel it too that the killing qi on him was very light.\"</p><p>\"There are countless powerful warriors in this world, but the only one who really impressed me was Bai Wuxue. He is almost out of this world, seemingly so peaceful, but still so sharp and powerful. What is more valuable is that his potential is actually not that high, only twenty-eight on the wall. But still, his success now is no smaller than the other four warriors.\" Hai Wuya let out a cold white breath, his face starting to look better.</p><p>Yan Fengfeng shook his head, \"That was five years ago. If it is now, he would definitely be able to enter the top ten. Potential is something that changes constantly. It all depends on individual abilities, as only the ones with powerful minds would become top warriors.\"</p><p>…</p><p>Few hundred miles away…</p><p>Duan Lengya and Lin Ku flew in the air.</p><p>\"Yuwen Jie, that little brat, what is his name again?\" Duan Lengya asked suddenly.</p><p>Yuwen Jie was very badly wounded, so he said without energy, \"Ye Chen.\"</p><p>\"Ye Chen!\" Duan Lengya's expression changed.</p><p>\"What's wrong?\"</p><p>Duan Lengya said word by word, \"His potential is third on the wall.\"</p><p>\"The third! That powerful! No wonder he seemed equally powerful in aura as me.\" Lin Ku was a bit scared thinking about it.</p><p>Duan Lengya said with a low voice, \"It was not just the third. In fact, he and Du Gujue and Dantai Mingyue were actually at the same level. They had all finished the seventh level…Therefore, their names were purple on the wall.\"</p><p>\"What!\"</p><p>Yuwen Jie and Lin Ku were shocked.</p><p>Duku Jie and Dantai Mingyue's reputation was monstrous; they were outrageously powerful warriors that could stand next to Mysterious Queen shoulder to shoulder. In the past thousand years, there were only those three who had this kind of power. As long as they had enough time and they managed to grow peacefully, they would be able to reach beyond the top five young warriors to the top of the world eventually.</p><p>And now, Ye Chen was able to stand next to them shoulder to shoulder. What kind of power did that represent?</p><p>\"Brother Duan, you are not kidding me, are you?\" Yuwen Jie could not even care for his wounds anymore as he hurried to ask.</p><p>Duan Lengya glanced at him once and said, \"Do I look like someone who would joke around about this?\"</p><p>Lin Ku's cold expression disappeared completely, and he spoke coldly after a while, \"So what if his potential is close to Du Gujue and Dantai Mingyue? Even they would not say for sure that they could make into the Life and Death Realm, not to mention him.\"</p><p>\"Yeah! Just him?\"</p><p>The two brother disciples followed.</p><p>\"Since everything has already happened, there is no point in thinking more about it. I, Duan Lengya, had never been afraid of anyone before. One day, I will step over the top five young warriors.\" Duan Lengya smiled, revealing his white, shiny teeth.</p><p>The martial geniuses were all very proud, and they would not think that they were not as good as someone else. All of them had high ambition, and just a test of potential would not scare them away.</p><p>…</p><p>Seeing the ruins after the battles, Ye Chen suggested to leave.</p><p>\"Yeah, it is time to go.\" Hai Wuya nodded. He had been wounded quite badly, and might need half a month to recover.</p><p>\"Be careful!\" Yan Fengfeng reminded him.</p><p>\"Don't worry! The Sky Ocean Martial School is not that far away from here. I think we will go now. Goodbye!\"</p><p>Hai Wuya held his fists together to greet everyone before guiding his brother and sister disciples to leave.</p><p>\"Brother Ye, are these your friends?\" Seeing Hai Wuya leave, Yan Fengfeng turned her head to look at Li Xiaoyun and Jing Aoxuan.</p><p>Ye Chen introduced, \"This is Li Xiaoyun, and this is Jing Aoxuan. They are both my friends.\" Then, he said to them, \"This is Yan Fengfeng, the head disciple of the Mysterious Martial School.\"</p><p>\"Your friends are really good people!\" Yan Fengfeng was very happy with Li Xiaoyun and Jing Aoxuan's actions. Even if it were Lin Ku and Duan Lengya they were facing, they still chose to stand out for their friends. It was a rather big decision to make.</p><p>\"Ye Chen comes from our Southern regions. Of course, we would stand out for him.\" Li Xiaoyun said it, as if it was an obvious choice for him.</p><p>\"Haha, come to rest in my Mysterious Martial School!\" Yan Fengfeng sent out an invitation to the two.</p><p>…</p><p>In the thunder region that was a hundred miles away, inside one of the most dangerous forbidden places…</p><p>Boom! Pap!</p><p>In the center of the Scream Thunder Cemetery, the lightning fell down from the sky again and again. Within a blink of an eye, a couple hundred bolts had flashed before people's eyes. After another pot of tea worth of time, countless more bolts appeared. It was so unbearably bright that it almost looked like the sun was shining directly there.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The ground was shaking as the lightning exploded on the ground in the center. In the next moment, a massive object appeared out of the ground. It was shooting into the sky at such a fast speed that it was almost invisible to the human eyes. It was a huge altar wrapped in twisted lightning right now, dragging out a long lightning arc behind it.</p><p>When the altar reached a height of ten thousand meters, the power seemed to have burned out. The pressure in the air seemed to make the lightning in the air even more aggressive as they continued to explode.</p><p>Dang!</p><p>Soon, the altar landed onto the ground with force. It was four hundred meters wide, one hundred meters tall, and with six legs. In the middle of the altar was a man in black robes. If Ye Chen were here, he would have recognized him: it was indeed the Evil Demon Master who had been trapped in the underground world.</p><p>He was full of anger right then. He had been already trapped there for three years. If it were not for the return of the altar, he would have been trapped there forever. During the past three years, there had not been a moment when he had not thought about Ye Chen. If it were not for him, he would have obtained the undying body three years ago, and would have been able to use it to get out easily and go back to the world where he belonged.</p><p>Pop!</p><p>The altar made with a white defense layer light disappeared and the Evil Demon master walked out.</p><p>\"Damn!\"</p><p>He threw out a palm attack onto the ground, which was shaken along with the mountain nearby.</p><p>At this moment when he finally saw the sun after three years, he felt a hint of surrealness, as if it were just a dream. But, that feeling soon disappeared completely. Right now, all he could think about was Ye Chen and only him. He swore to himself that he would show Ye Chen what he had been through in the past three years.</p><p>\"In the past three years, that brat would have grown a lot as well, but surely would not have reached the Sea of Souls Realm. If an Astral Reaching Realm warrior still thinks so low of me, then I will show him how wrong he is. No, actually, I will ask him to hand over the undying manual before showing him that. Then, the three years I spent in hell would be somehow worth it.\"</p><p>He was excited, as a vague sneer continued to appear on his face. He could almost see it when he would beat Ye Chen to the ground and make the latter look all scared.</p><p>\"Hehe! Wait of me, you little brat! My revenge is finally here! You have pissed off the wrong guy, and it will be the worst mistake you ever made in this life.\"</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>Thinking that, he turned into a black shadow and shot out into the distance. Midway, he grabbed with both of his hands, shredding two Astral Reaching Realm warriors who were just passing by into ashes. He needed it as an outlet for his anger and frustration that had accumulated over the past three years. There had been moments when he thought he was going to lose his mind. Three years was a long time for someone to be trapped in one place without knowing when he would be able to get out. It would not be easy for a normal man, and even for a master level warrior like him. After all, he was a warrior with a chance of reaching the Life and Death Realm. How could he be okay getting stuck in one place for three years?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
