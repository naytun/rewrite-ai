If you dare, let's fight head-on!\" Li Feng threw out a couple of fist attacks, which all landed on Li Lei since Ye Chen's step art was too unpredictable to follow. Each time, he managed to make Li Lei the one who received all the attacks, which pissed Li Feng off so much.</p><p>Li Feng's speech let Ye Chen know what true evil was, \"Head-on…You guys dare to say those words? With the two of you battling me, you still think you don't have enough of advantage?\"</p><p>\"What a talker! I will make you wish you could cry!\" Li Feng was embarrassed, and consequently became furious.</p><p>\"Brother, I already know of this brat's power! It will be enough for me to take on this brat. Even if I cannot do so, I will be able to burn out his Zhen yuan and mental power. And once he is weakened, you could just swipe in!\" Li Lei and Ye Chen had exchanged dozens of attacks with Ye Chen and realized that he was only powerful with his step art and sword art, there did not seem to be more of advantages.</p><p>\"Alright, I will help you on the side.\"</p><p>Li Feng thought about it and agreed. Both he and his brother were not weak, as long as they did not run into Yan Fengfeng and Tai Shichong, this level of warriors, it would be fine for them to last two hundred attacks even. Plus, even if he went on as well, it would only let Ye Chen beat him for it.</p><p>\"Brat, you just wait for death! And even if you hand over the fruit right now, we will not let you go!\" Let out that, Li Feng took a hundred steps back.</p><p>Heard him, a creepy cold light flashed through Ye Chen's eyes. Indeed, he did not have that many advantages, but he still had his double sword art. His completed Sky Thunder Cut was still not as powerful as his Gold Resonant Radiance, but if combined with the Reverse| Sky Thunder Cut, its power would definitely be more powerful; equivalent to a profound sense sword art at seventy percent completion. Added with his extremely powerful sword intent, his attacking power would be unbeatable.</p><p>However, he was still waiting for a chance, a chance when Li Lei would be unguarded. Then, he would be able to wound the latter severely. As for killing him, it might be impossible at this stage, since there was not a huge power gap between the three. But of course, if he called out his Great Eating Wolf, then it might be possible. However, the wolf was Ye Chen's ace attack. If it were not a critical moment, Ye Chen would not call him out.</p><p>Ding! Ding! Dong! Dong!</p><p>Li Lei held the shield in front of his body as he increased the speed of his Thunder Lightning Leg Shadow, containing the thunder profound that was extremely powerful. Although it was not as intense as his brother Li Feng's Wind Fist, its power was increased quite a lot. Even if it were Ye Chen, he would not want to be hit by that.</p><p>\"Void Shattering Finger!\"</p><p>Facing that sky full of incoming thunder lighting leg shadows, Ye Chen jumped into the air as he pointed out his left fingers. It was indeed the third movement of the Void Shattering Finger Art.</p><p>Pop!</p><p>That massive blue fingers contained the space mentality which was at the edge of space profound. There was only one flash before it cracked open a surreal space amongst the leg shadow. During the process of breaking in, the blue fingers extracted the power of that thunder lightning leg shadow, which was really creepy.</p><p>\"What? What kind of finger art is this? Perhaps the darkness profound? No… it should not be like this…\"</p><p>Even if Li Lei had seen and known a lot, he could not figure out what Ye Chen was employing all of a sudden.</p><p>Li Feng, who was a hundred steps away, was shocked at what he saw, \"Finger shaped…extracting the opponent's power…Perhaps this is the Godly Finger Master Xia Yousun's Void Shattering Finger Art? How come he has it too?\"</p><p>Xia Houzun was one of the young top five warriors who was famous for his finger art, hence the title of Godly Finger Master. He was good at many types of finger arts, but during an epic battle, he had once revealed a very horrifying foreign finger art. It was just like the one Ye Chen was using here, allowing him to extract the opponent's power and increase the finger art's attacking power. Of course, due to the difference of Zhen yuan element, the color was different. Plus, Xia Houzun's Void Shattering Finger was slightly different from Ye Chen's, but that qi and aura was identical.</p><p>\"It must be the Void Shattering Finger Art! It must be!\"</p><p>\"Amaranthine Nature!\"</p><p>After creating a tunnel, Ye Chen jumped within. His thunder disaster sword was like a beam of lightning that could expand and shrike as he wanted. It suddenly stabbed toward Li Lei, who was at the end of the tunnel.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>The sword speed increased continuously, and Li Lei soon realized that he could no longer sense its existence.</p><p>\"Piss off!\"</p><p>Li Lei's body tilted as he groaned, his left leg kicking out like a thunder lightning whip while using his shield to cover his body. He knew that since he could not avoid that incoming attack, he would not try to escape it then. By tilting his body, he would be able to avoid the attack from landing on his fatal organs and the shield would be able to block out some of the power, while his left leg that kicked out would be able to wound Ye Chen's waist as well. He believed that as long as he was kicked by that leg art, Ye Chen's spine would either break completely or have small cracks at least, and that he would definitely make him more wounded than himself.</p><p>Pooh!</p><p>However, Ye Chen's sword attack was way faster than Li Lei's movement with his shield, and it went through Li Lei's left shoulder through the edge of the shield. It was right then when his body also moved horizontally as he took out his thunder disaster sword, which flashed once before disappearing. He had managed to avoid Li Lei's leg attack perfectly. Since Ye Chen was able to come out unharmed in front of sixty-four mental projections which had similar mental power, how could he not avoid Li Lei's attacks? In other words, Li Lei's ideal plan was a pure dream.</p><p>\"Brat, you have aggravated me! I will kill you!\"</p><p>Blood poured out of his shoulder like a fountain as Li Lei's face twisted from the pain and anger. A bright thunder lightning appeared from his body, which twisted like a snake and continued to flash before landing onto the ground, which was burnt black and cracked open within a second. When it passed through the air, space patterns appeared as well.</p><p>\"It seems like he is about to use his ace attack.\"</p><p>Ye Chen maintained a certain distance that was neither to close to Li Lei, nor too close to Li Feng's fast attacks.</p><p>Pap!</p><p>A thick lightning flashed through above Li Lei's head.</p><p>As it happened, Li Lei disappeared completely, as if the lightning had taken him away. But, Ye Chen knew that it was just an illusion of his opponent moving too fast while his whole body was infused into the lightning.</p><p>\"Die! Thunder God Arrival!\"</p><p>In the next instant, Li Lei appeared right above Ye Chen along with his kick attack. The second when his right leg came down, Ye Chen felt like he could see a thunder lightning shadow behind Li Lei's body. It was different from demi demon's bloodline shadow as well as Yan Fengfeng's main body shadow. It was the kind of qi field that had been created on its own, which meant that this attack was powerful to a certain extent.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>That kick attack did look like a godly thunder falling down from the sky.</p><p>\"Yeah, Li Lei is fighting Ye Chen head-on.\" Over there, Yan Fengfeng and the three had already stopped their fighting. It was obviously Yan Fengfeng, who was the fastest, had managed to get the fruit in the end. After all, when there were a lot of people involved, the advantage of speed was irreplaceable, especially when the other four had a similar speed.</p><p>He!</p><p>Ye Chen was already prepared for fighting back as he lifted up his right hand with his thunder disaster sword while holding the gold sword in his left hand, crossing them in front of his chest. The middle part of the two formed a perfect shaped thunder ball, which was expanding at an extreme speed. When it was one meter wide, it clashed with the kick shadow, which was also flashing with a thunder light.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The two were both using the thunder profound, so the destructive power of the clash was shocking. The sky suddenly darkened and endless beams of thick lighting exploded. Meanwhile, the space around the two had become a world of thunder. Flood dragon like lightning flew everywhere, and there was even thunder and lightning under the ground. Everything within thousands of meters was burnt, and only the area one hundred meters from the Longevity tree was perfectly fine. There seemed to be an invisible power that had blocked out the thunder and lightning.</p><p>\"How could this be!\"</p><p>Li Lei suddenly realized that his thunder profound attack was not even as powerful as Ye Chen's, whose qi had managed to accumulate a huge amount of thunder and lightning as it attacked back at him.</p><p>'This attack of my opponent is at mid-rank profound sense, but it is only at eighty percent. Ye, when judging on power, it should be even more powerful than my double sword style attack combined together. Moreover, his cultivation is one realm higher than mine, at the peak level Mid Seas of Souls Realm. However, my sword intent can make up for all of the disadvantages, and even provide me with quite a bit of advantage.'</p><p>His sword intent could make his attacks more intense, including his thunder and lightning power. As a result, its power would naturally be more powerful than Li Lei's.</p><p>\"Break!\"</p><p>With both his arms using full strength, the two swords in Ye Chen's hands rubbed together and created electricity as he sliced the two sides. With that, the attacks that exploded out broke through Li Lei's defense immediately.</p><p>\"Stop!\"</p><p>Seeing that Li Lei was about to be wounded again, Tai Shichong's eyebrows flicked. His longsword shook once in his hand and one circular sword qi was waved out, tearing the sky apart.</p><p>\"Major Phoenix Cut!\"</p><p>Yan Fengfeng would not let Tai Shichong block Ye Chen, so she performed a fire palm blade, which cut the sword qi in half.</p><p>\"Yan Fengfeng, you!\" Tai Shichong stared at Yan Fengfeng in a fury.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>Meanwhile, the battle between Ye Chen and Li Lei finally finished, Li Lei had been blown into the sky, with a crossed sword mark on the chest. The powerful sword qi had made its way into his body and caused a severe damage. In other words, eighty percent of his battling power had been destroyed, and he would be a threat to no one now.</p><p>\"I asked you to stop.\" Tai Shichong stared at Ye Chen with a look of wrath.</p><p>\"And should I just stop because you asked me to do so?\" Ye Chen took a deep breath, making eye contact with Tai Shichong unwaveringly.</p><p>\"Li Lei!\" The battle was too intense, and Li Feng could not even get involved. It was only until then that he cried out at what he saw and flew into the sky to catch his brother, who was wounded badly.</p><p>\"Take revenge for me!\"</p><p>Li Lei had not only received the attack from Ye Chen, but he was also wounded by his thunder and lightning power. Right then, he could no longer handle the injuries, and hence fainted.</p><p>\"Ye Chen, you dare to wound my brother!\"</p><p>Catching Li Lei and landing onto the ground, Li Feng had a scary expression on his face.</p><p>Ye Chen ignored him—without Li Lei, Li Feng would not be his rightful opponent at all. If the latter wanted to take revenge, he would not mind sending both of the twin brothers back with them lying down.</p><p>\"The Longevity fruit has ripened!\"</p><p>It was right then when the third fruit was finally reaped and fell from the branch. The three who were fighting against Hai Wuya and Ling Tianhao heard the news and immediately gave up on the battle, rushing toward the tree.</p><p>Hai Wuya was about to move as well, but Yan Fengfeng stopped him. She shook her head and said, \"Out of three fruits, we already got two. If we still take the third one, then we will become the target of them all. So, leave this one and let them fight for it.\"</p><p>\"You are quite right.\" Hai Wuya nodded and just watched the rest of them while smiling relaxedly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
