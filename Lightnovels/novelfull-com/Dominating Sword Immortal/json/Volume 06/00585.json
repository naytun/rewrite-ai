Inside him was even the dragon power from the Dragon Blood Plant. With one scream, he managed to shoot out of the tough rock wall and escape from the attack of the white flood dragon. His Zhen yuan boiled up as he shot upward at an extreme speed again. Inside the lake, he knew that he could not use all of his power properly.</p><p>All he could hear was a cracking sound before the wall below him was shattered by the flood dragon like a piece of tofu. Its head landed deep into the wall, but its flood dragon tail was waved directly into Ye Chen's direction without skipping a beat.</p><p>\"Gold Resonant Radiance!\"</p><p>Anyway, Ye Chen had been prepared for it as he took out his gold sword and shot out a beam of bright golden light.</p><p>Chin!</p><p>It was like a super electrical chainsaw attack which landed onto the tail of the flood dragon. The burning sparks had ignored the lake's coldness and spilled everywhere. However, that attack was not able to break through the flood dragon's defense, only managing to leave a faint white mark.</p><p>\"What kind of defense is this! Even the Gold Resonant Radiance could not make it through! This power…is at least over five hundred thousand pounds! How crazy!\"</p><p>Ye Chen had heard it from Xu Jing once that thousands of years ago, there was a martial institution called the Cang Man martial school, where everyone inside trained physical strength. People with ten thousand pounds worth of power were only the lowest rank disciples; thirty thousand pounds would make one an outer disciple, while fifty could be for inner ones. The core disciples would have at least eighty thousand pounds worth of power; two hundred thousand for the outer master; and three hundred thousand for the inner master. The leader and some of the great masters were reaching over five hundred thousand pounds in physical power. They could even fight flood dragons and godly creatures only heard of in legends.</p><p>This white flood dragon was definitely at the great master level. With only its physical strength, it could ignore almost all Sea of Souls Realm master level warriors.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>Although the tail of the flood dragon did not manage to restrain Ye Chen and was blocked out by his gold sword, that disastrous power had blown him away again. Blood spilled out of his hand, but in the next second, he used that wave of energy and managed to shoot out of the water.</p><p>Meanwhile, the flood dragon easily pulled out its head and waved its tail, catching up immediately.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The water column exploded immediately as the flood dragon jumped out of the water. Its long body that was hundreds of meters long moved in the air swiftly. As it appeared, the surroundings above the lake started to change dramatically, becoming extremely foggy to the extent of being rather dreamy.</p><p>The flood dragon was staring at Ye Chen as that wave of invisible pressure had been released as well, making the flat ground sink in for a couple of meters. The plants and tiny rocks on the ground had been crushed into dust.</p><p>Pooh!</p><p>The second Ye Chen managed to make it out of the water, he puked out a chunk of blood. The flood dragon's power was beyond imagination; after the two short exchanges of attacks, the former was already wounded internally quite badly. He could even feel the cracks on his bones at this point.</p><p>\"The flood dragon is the species closest to the actual mythical dragon, and this pressure must be the dragon essence. Luckily, it is not the real deal yet…If that were the case, I would not be able to use my Zhen yuan at all.\"</p><p>The flood dragon was one of the beasts with the most concentrated dragon bloodline amongst them all. Once it grew to a certain point, it could even evolve into an actual dragon and fly to the places where human beings could not. The dragons were extremely powerful, and their aura was horrifying. And the flood dragon contained a significant dragon bloodline, it naturally carried a light dragon power as well, using its aura to pressurize its opponent.</p><p>Ye Chen took out a yuan qi replenishing pellet and put into his mouth while activating his undying body to quickly recover from his wound. As for escaping, it would be definitely impossible at this point. It was not that he did not want to, more like he could not outrun the dragon. The dragon's speed under the water could reach his speed on land, and probably only Yan Fengfeng could outrun it.</p><p>Awhooo!</p><p>The white flood dragon seemed to be able to see that Ye Chen was trying to heal his wounds, so it shot out at a fast speed and tried to grab his body. With the claws' sharpness added with the flood dragon's power, even if Ye Chen's defense was increased by twice, he would be crushed into dust by that attack.</p><p>\"Piss off!\"</p><p>This time, Ye Chen was not holding the gold sword; instead, it was the thunder disaster sword which turned into a beam of lightning, clashing with the incoming claw of the flood dragon.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The two's power gap was too massive to ignore; even with his thunder disaster sword enhancing his attack, Ye Chen was still not the rightful opponent of the white flood dragon. His whole body was blown away, landing into the forest right next to the deep lake and disturbing an area of bird beasts.</p><p>Puking out another chunk of blood, Ye Chen seemed to be helpless at this point, \"Five hundred thousand pounds worth of power…is too horrifying. I cannot let it get close to me, but with my long range attack, it would be impossible to break through its defense…and I would be caught in no time. If I could train my Void Shattering Finger to sixty percent, maybe even seventy percent, perhaps I would be able to make it through its layer. Unfortunately, my Void Shattering Finger attack's power is not even as powerful as my Gold Resonant Radiance Attack. It would be useless to use it anyway.\"</p><p>\"I only have this now.\"</p><p>Seeing that the white flood dragon was jumping at him again, Ye Chen held his thunder disaster sword with his right hand while holding the gold sword in his left. He crossed the two in front of his chest before attacking out suddenly.</p><p>A pile of ink blue thunder ball was created and expanded at an extreme speed, devouring the flood dragon within.</p><p>Pap! Pop! Pap! Pop!</p><p>The sound of the thunder rushing was heard as Ye Chen immediately backed out, trying to avoid being wounded by the flood dragon as he stared at it with all of his focus.</p><p>Soon, the thunder mist disappeared, and a burnt mark appeared on the white flood dragon's scale. It was vaguely getting darker and darker, and on its chest was a vague crossed sword mark as well, with the scales there shattered. A hint of blood came out slowly from beneath before dripping onto the plants below. The latter did not seem to be able to handle the power of its blood, so it exploded at the touch of it.</p><p>\"It is still not enough to wound him badly?\" Ye Chen frowned a bit.</p><p>The white dragon was angered; it had been years, countless years since he had been wounded at all. It could not believe that this human in front of him, who did not seem powerful at all, had managed to do so to it. Although it did not even count as a minor wound, it was the godly creature, the flood dragon!</p><p>Whooo!</p><p>Opening its massive bloody mouth, the white flood dragon blew out a gust of ice cold wind. As a result, everything within five hundred meters was instantly covered in thick ice.</p><p>\"Not good!\"</p><p>It was coming in way too fast—Ye Chen was only able to move half a step before being attacked by the wave of freezing qi and turned into a human-shaped ice statue.</p><p>\"Ye Chen, you hold on for a little longer…I am coming at full speed.\"</p><p>All of a sudden, Yan Fengfeng's voice was heard inside Ye Chen's head. It turned out that she had sensed what was going on with Ye Chen through her soul power and used her special Mysterious Martial School's soul messaging to let him know. With her speed, hundred miles of distance would only take her couple breath worth of time.</p><p>But, Ye Chen knew that if he did not manage to break through the ice statue that he was trapped in, he would be smashed into nothingness in the next second.</p><p>\"Break!</p><p>Under that massive life-threatening danger, Ye Chen's ability of growing stronger in front of powerful opponent exploded once again. Before, when he was being chased by the Ao family, he managed to push himself to increase his understanding of the undying body; and right now, facing the threat from the white flood dragon, his whole body seemed to come together. His shockingly powerful sword spirit had broken out of his body directly, shattering the ice around his body immediately.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
