Three fruits of the whole tree had ripened in such a short period of time. The first fruit had landed in Yan Fengfeng's hands after a long battle, and the second one went to Ye Chen. If they could not get the third one, then they would have to wait another half an hour for the fourth one. No one would know what would happen in the next thirty minutes; therefore, this fruit was extremely important for them. With it, the whole mood would be different as well.</p><p>\"Tai Shichong is going to be mad!\" Hai Wuya leaned onto an old tree as he enjoyed watching the battle.</p><p>\"It is about time.\" Ye Chen had gotten a fruit, so he was in a good mood. Right now, he would only try to fight for it for Hai Wuya and the rest of his people; the rest would have nothing to do with him.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Tai Shichong's personal battling power was indeed shocking. Even without his two wind and thunder master warriors' help, his sword intent was even sharper. That longsword in his hand was like a sword made with natural qi; even though that sword attack had missed its target, the sword shadow that expanded out could still puncture through his opponent's protective Zhen yuan. If it were not the fact that it was so chaotic right now and there was the presence of both Tian Yinsou and the bulky middle-aged man, he would have already killed most of the other warriors. Even the bulky middle-aged man had backed out for dozens of steps after clashing with Tai Shichong.</p><p>\"Such a powerful sword power!\"</p><p>The middle-aged man looked even more serious at this point. He was a Savage Man who had not only cultivated his Zhen yuan, but also his physical body. He could handle more than two hundred thousand pounds worth of power, and rarely anyone from the Seas of Souls Realm master level could blow him away. Tai Shichong was not a body training warrior himself normally, but his sword arts were just too powerful, and could actually form a sword from the natural. Hence, that sword attack was similar to the world pressuring the opponent, which made his opponent back out.</p><p>\"Such a powerful sword power!\"</p><p>\"But, it would be impossible for me to give up on the fruit!\"</p><p>The middle-aged man yelled once and jumped out again. The bronze bar was waved in the air, and the whole sky was filled with its shadows.</p><p>\"Mountain Sword!\"</p><p>Tai Shichong knew that it would not work if he still did not use his ace attacks, so he groaned once as he waved his sword out horizontally</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The mountain-like sword shadow contained an extremely rich mud profound, which managed to blow Tian Yinsou and the bulky middle-aged man away immediately.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>Using his palm to generate a suction, Tai Shichong managed to obtain the third fruit.</p><p>\"Damn! Put it down!\"</p><p>Tian Yinsou's expression did not look good. He had been famous for at least a few decades, during which, he had never stopped cultivating. Hence, his cultivation had ameliorated drastically, reaching the peak of Late Sea of Souls Realm. Normally, he would still be able to make a breakthrough without the fruit. However, consuming the fruit would not be just as simple as improving the cultivation; it could also heal a dying man completely, which made it a great life-saving treasure. Besides that, breaking through peak level Late Seas of Souls Realm to the Life and Death Realm would require a huge amount of Zhen yuan, so the Longevity Fruit would be the best thing to have. No matter which function of the fruit was considered, it would all be worth fighting for.</p><p>\"Piss off!\"</p><p>It was not the mud profound that Tai Shichong used this time, but the water profound. With one sword waved out, the water like sword power was slashed out repeatedly, continuing to cancel out the attacks from Tian Yinsou. Soon, another wave of water rushed into the sky before attacking toward the latter.</p><p>Soon, even the bulky middle-aged man could no longer handle Tai Shichong's water profound sword art. Thus, the two were forced to give up on the third fruit, waiting for the fourth one to ripen.</p><p>\"Mud profound, water profound, plus that natural sword before…it seems like Tai Shichong has trained the mud profound after all. Representing the earth from the nature, it incorporates too many elemental profounds, each one of which could be used along with it. 'Mud, the one thing that exists everywhere' is not just a simple saying…It is actually very true in a lot of ways.\"</p><p>Seeing that Tai Shichong had just performed another water profound sword art, Ye Chen understood his battling style for the most part.</p><p>\"Brother Tai Shi, he has wounded my brother badly. You have to take revenge for him!\" Seeing that Tai Shichong had successfully obtained the third fruit, Li Feng hurried to tell him that, knowing that he would not be a rightful opponent for Ye Chen himself. So, he hoped Tai Shichong would take him on for him</p><p>Tai Shichong glanced at Ye Chen, \"I will…but not now.\"</p><p>\"But…\" Li Feng was trying to say something when Tai Shichong frowned, stopping him from talking, \"Right now, getting the fruit is the most important thing. Leave the personal business for later.\"</p><p>If there were no Yan Fengfeng, Tai Shichong would not mind taking revenge for Li Lei already, but he knew how powerful Yan Fengfeng was. And in fact, there was rarely anyone who could push her to use her actual true power, so her power could be considered almost equivalent to the top five young warriors. Even they would not mess with her normally, because they knew that if she wanted to run, no one would be able to stop her. So, not many people really knew exactly how powerful she was. As for the battle before, everyone was still hiding their true power.</p><p>\"It seems like Tai Shichong is not prepared to take you on for now.\" Hai Wuya had caught the expression changes between Li Feng and Tai Shichong, and said to Ye Chen with a laughing expression.</p><p>Ye Chen said lightly, \"He is just concerned about Yan Fengfeng.\"</p><p>Yan Fengfeng was very powerful. Although she seemed at a similar level as Hai Wuya on the surface, with a slightly higher power, that was when she was in her human form right now and not in the battling mode. She was just like Sun Xiaojin, who could increase his actual power drastically after transforming to battling beast mode.</p><p>Of course, Ye Chen did not want to count on her at all. Once he had cultivated using the longevity fruit, his power would increase drastically. By then, he would not have to be afraid of Tai Shichong anymore, and would be able to duke it out with him as well.</p><p>\"It seems like I will have to use my ace attack now.\"</p><p>Tian Yinsou glanced at Tai Shichong and Yan Fengfeng, then finally glanced at the bulky middle-aged man, and knew that all three of them should not be messed with easily. He knew that without his ace attacks, his chance of getting that fourth fruit would not be higher than thirty percent, and might even be lower. So, he was prepared to go all in.</p><p>About another half an hour, the fourth fruit fell down slowly.</p><p>\"It's mine!\" Tian Yinsou yelled loudly before throwing out three great pellets with evil qi, each of which had cost him a great fortune.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Before the three pellets landed onto the ground, they all exploded in the air, bringing up waves of evil winds and beast roars.</p><p>\"It's evil beasts!\"</p><p>Tai Shichong, Yan Fengfeng, and the bulky middle-aged man hurried to stop, while the others were forced to stop as well. Within the roaring evil wind, three cruel-looking, evil beasts appeared out of nowhere. No one had seen beasts of that kind before; they looked like they were made up of a couple of different beasts, seeming both dead and alive.</p><p>\"What are those?\" Guan Qin asked her brother disciple.</p><p>Hai Wuya explained, \"They are the kind of beasts that are not alive, but are created by an evil, secret martial art. First, a couple of rank 10 beasts are captured, taking away their beast power and sealing them into a secret chamber to watch them kill each other. Once all of the beasts are dead, then the secret martial art is employed to collect the evil qi from the dead beast souls and store it into the evil beast pellets. Later on, one puts this pellet into another rank 10 beast's head, letting it slowly devour its soul. Eventually, this beast's soul would enter the pellet and infuse naturally with the evil qi within, which would make the beast's soul even crazier. It would be able to use the earth qi and the evil qi to form its evil beast body, which would be way much more powerful, and enough to kill most normal Sea of Souls Realm master level warriors. Plus, since their bodies are made up of the earth qi and evil qi, it would make them basically immortal. It would be almost impossible to wound them.\"</p><p>\"That powerful!\" Guan Qin was impressed by what she heard.</p><p>Yan Fengfeng stared at an evil beast in front of her while a cold light shone in her eyes, \"The method of creating the evil beasts was almost lost completely. I wonder where he managed to get his hands onto those manuals.\"</p><p>Although Yan Fengfeng had killed a lot of beasts, she was still a beast herself after all. So, she felt disgusted toward this kind of a cruel secret martial art.</p><p>\"Nirvana Fire!\"</p><p>As she talked, a sticky flame came out of her mouth, appearing to have a soul of its own. It moved once in the midair before attacking toward the beasts.</p><p>Whooooo!</p><p>If it were just a normal flame, then it would not be able to wound the beasts at all. But, it somehow managed to burn the beasts very well, making it look like a fire beast. Its hysterical cry was heard through the burning flame, which slowly weakened before disappearing.</p><p>Hai Wuya forced a laugh, \"Your Nirvana Fire is not that easy to train…What a waste to use it on evil beasts!\" Of course, he knew that she was angered right now.</p><p>\"Hm? The soul power combined perfectly with the fire power…what an amazing nirvana fire!\" Ye Chen cried out. He could tell that this fire could not only burn actual beings, but even burn through souls. In other words, this kind of a fire could do double the damage, and it would be hard to estimate its killing power. People below the Life and Death Realm would probably be killed by the mere touch of it.</p><p>However, it might be hard to take on enemies other than the evil beasts with it, since it would be too slow of an attack. Warriors at the same cultivation would be able to avoid it easily. Ye Chen could also tell that there wasn't much of the Nirvana Fire inside her body, and it would be hard to recover after using it.</p><p>'My slaughter and destruction sword intent can also kill these evil beasts' souls, making their evil bodies useless. But, since Yan Fengfeng has already used her nirvana fire, then I will not have to do anything.'</p><p>Perhaps, it would be almost impossible for the others to take on the evil beasts, but for Ye Chen, it would be rather easy. After all, the evil beasts were similar to the thunder spirits, which were also made up of energy. In comparison, the evil beasts' souls would be stronger than the thunder spirit; otherwise, Ye Chen could kill them within a heartbeat.</p><p>After burning the evil beasts, the dimmed down flame went back into her body.</p><p>Over at Ye Chen's side, everything seemed to be under control; however, intense battles seemed to be raging on the other sides. Obviously, both Tai Shichong and the bulky middle-aged man did not have the means to beat the evil beasts in a short time, so they had to go for a long battle.</p><p>As for the Tian Yinsou, he had already obtained the fourth fruit. After seeing Yan Fengfeng kill his beast so casually, he made an unnoticeable expression.</p><p>\"It is not easy to create these beasts. I only managed to create four of them after decades. Once I break the pellet, the evil beasts will slowly burn out the soul power and disappear in thin air. I do not know if it was worth the time and effort anymore…\"</p><p>Tian Yinsou was a bit lost for a second.</p><p>Since they were not natural born beings after all, they would come with quite a major limitation—their soul power would slowly burn out until it ran out completely and turned into nothingness. Their opponents now were Tai Shichong and the middle-aged man, who were obviously impossible to kill in a short period of time. Hence, their effectiveness was limited indeed.</p><p>Whoo! Whoo!</p><p>Moments later, the two other beasts had turned into nothingness. However, Tai Shichong and the middle-aged man were not doing that well. Battling with the beasts had burned a lot of their Zhen yuan and energy, which would not be a good thing for the situation they were stuck in.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
