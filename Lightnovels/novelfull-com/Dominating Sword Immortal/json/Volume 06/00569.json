It was obvious that he did not care about him at all, beating him whenever he pleased.</p><p>\"Lin Ku, we still have got unfinished business from the last time. We can do all that together today!\"</p><p>A pile of anger exploded inside Hai Wuya's heart and a massive deep ocean swirl appeared out of nowhere behind his back. The swirl was spinning slowly but firmly, providing quite a bit of power for Hai Wuya.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The ground under him sank a bit. He closed his five fingers, and struck right at that blade light.</p><p>On one side, it contained the profound sense of rotting, while on the other side, it also contained the power of water profound. The two were like water and fire. The second they clashed together, rounds after rounds of blasting wave appeared out of nowhere. They shot out in different directions, only stopping after reaching ten miles away.</p><p>\"Endless Ocean!\"</p><p>The bald Hai Wuya shot up from the ground, his left hand protecting in front of his chest as his right hand drew a circle in the air. Endless water yuan qi gathered from everywhere, being infused into his fist aura.</p><p>\"Ah!\" He made out a loud scream as he struck out with his most powerful palm attack, bringing up endless waves of water with it.</p><p>\"Dry Wood Revival!\"</p><p>Lin Ku with his grayish-white hair looked cold, holding his blade with both of his hands. Using it, he sliced out endless blade attacks toward that incoming powerful palm attack.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The two famous teenage martial geniuses seemed to have some kind of rivalry already, and the battle between Ye Chen and Yuwen Jie was only a trigger.</p><p>\"Head sister, are you not going to help?\" Ling Tianhao asked Yan Fengfeng, who shook her head in response, \"Every martial genius has his or her own dignity. Hai Wuya's power is not that much weaker than mine. If I go up there and try to help, it will actually upset him.\"</p><p>\"Ok!\" Ling Tianhao nodded, shifting his focus back onto the battle between Hai Wuya and Lin Ku. He was very excited, wondering when he would reach this level.</p><p>\"The argument between powerful parties…it is indeed intense!\"</p><p>Ye Chen could tell that he was just an excuse for this battle in front of him. Even without him being here, they would have found another excuse to start a fight. But comparing the two, it was indeed Lin Ku who was being more aggressive.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Hai Wuya and Lin Ku exchanged another attack before being blown away.</p><p>\"Hai Wuya, my rotting profound is not easy to handle, is it? You are doomed to lose when battling against me!\" Lin Ku's clothes had been torn apart, but his eyes still shone with a bright light, his battling power seemingly endless. His whole body was like a battling blade itself.</p><p>Hai Wuya's face looked a bit pale right then; some vague blade marks had been imprinted onto his body. He sneered, \"Huh! Do not try to put on a tough face. Under my palm power, it would be impossible for you not to get wounded. As for who will be the last one laughing, we still do not know yet.\"</p><p>\"Hehe, I would like to see which one of us will be the first to back out.\" Lin Ku started at Hai Wuxiao without looking away.</p><p>\"Bring it on! I am not afraid of you!\"</p><p>Just as Hai Wuya finished his sentence, the water yuan qi in the air suddenly froze into ice chips, falling down everywhere. The surrounding temperature suddenly decreased drastically. A wave of cold air blew past them, the rocks on the ground starting to crack open.</p><p>\"Ice Seal River!\"</p><p>A cold voice was heard, as all people could see in the distance was a white mist spreading toward them rapidly. It looked like the ice age was about to arrive at any second, and everything in this world would be frozen.</p><p>Crack! Crack!</p><p>Hai Wuya was not prepared for it and was trapped in the ice yuan qi, all of the water yuan qi around him seeming to serve as a helping factor. Within a fraction of a second, a massive ice statue had been created, and in its center was indeed Hai Wuya.</p><p>Besides him, everyone around him was also having a hard time. All of them were trying their best to block out the coldness trying to invade into their bodies. A thick layer of frost had formed on top of their protective Zhen yuan layer. Ye Chen held his gold sword, continuously cutting down the incoming ice cold force with swords after swords. The sword light and the ice-cold frozen ice chips clashed together, exploding out more ice chips which reflected colourful light due to the sunshine.</p><p>Right below them, the mountain and river started to freeze up without a single sound.</p><p>\"Duan Lengya, do you really think that you are so invincible?\"</p><p>Right next to Ling Tianhao and Miao Ying, a burning blue flame exploded: it was indeed from Yan Fengfeng who was furious right now. She pushed out a wave of powerful fire power with both of her hands toward the source of the ice power, that pretty-looking young man with green hair and green leather attire.</p><p>Ice and fire were archenemies. The clash between the two could upset the world natural balance.</p><p>Right then, it was the clash between the fire power and the power of ice, which was even more intense than the battle between Hai Wuya and Lin Ku, since the two's Zhen yuan and profound sense were not that opposite to each other.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The burning heat and the icy cold clashed together, bringing up a white mist such that people could no longer see even their hands in front of them. But, it was only temporary; as the blast wave spread out, the white mist was blown into the sky, and the view in front of everyone else finally cleared up.</p><p>Swooosh!</p><p>The blue colored flame surrounded Yan Fengfeng and the mountain she was standing on. With that, the peak of the mountain below her started to thaw and her fire power started to spread out with her being the center. Countless ice blocks turned into flowing water, pouring down the mountain rapidly with crisp and soothing sound.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The ice statue that concealed Hai Wuya suddenly cracked open, and he was finally freed.</p><p>\"Duan Lengya, you play so low!\"</p><p>Hai Wuya's face got paler. The battle between him and Lin Ku had wounded him quite a bit internally. Most importantly, Duan Lengya's ice profound naturally canceled out his water profound. Judging on the battling power, he should not be that much weaker than Duan Lengya. But, due to the natural factors, he knew that he would not have been able to win against Duan Lengya. Plus, he chose to assassinate him instead of attacking head-on, so he was not prepared for it.</p><p>Stepping on the ice, Duan lengya with a head of green hair walked up.</p><p>\"Hai Wuya, it is not my fault that you got distracted. If it were not for Yan Fengfeng's help, I would have embarrassed you completely just then.\"</p><p>\"You!\" Hai Wuya stared at Duan Lengya madly.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>A beam of blue fire flashed through and Yan Fengfeng appeared in front of Hai Wuya almost at the same time, standing right next to him. She was afraid that Duan Lengya and Lin Ku would join forces and attack him.</p><p>Duan Lengya's pupils shrank once. Yan Fengfeng's speed was something that he was most scared of. In fact, no one below the Life and Death Realm was unafraid of her speed.</p><p>\"Yan Fengfeng, you don't have to worry! I will pay respect to your reputation, but I will not give the other people this great advantage. Whoever wounded Yuwen Jie, walk out himself!\" Duan Lengya said.</p><p>Ye Chen frowned a bit. Lin Ku and Duan Lengya, these two seemed to be more aggressive than the other. No wonder they were able to have this close a relationship with the Yuwen family.</p><p>\"It is me.\" Ye Chen stepped out.</p><p>\"Alright, brave enough!\" Duan Lengya chuckled, looking very unfriendly.</p><p>\"Duan Lengya, what do you want to do?\" Yan Fengfeng's eyebrows were pointing to the ground, looking like a blue flame.</p><p>\"I don't want to do anything, just help my brother out.\"</p><p>Duan Lengya had brought his brother disciples to come to the pavilion, wanting to test out their potential. The testing time was not that long. But, after he walked off the mountain, he realized that Lin Ku and Yuwen Jie were gone. Then, he had sensed an energy vibration a hundred miles away. Following the, he had come here immediately.</p><p>\"Not to mention the fact that it was Yuwen Jie who was in the wrong, even if it were us in the wrong, it would not be you who would have the right to tell us what to do.\" Yan Fengfeng sneered.</p><p>\"Oh? It sounds like that you are trying to protect this brat, eh?\" Duan Lengya's eyes squeezed together.</p><p>\"What if I say yes?\"</p><p>\"What? You don't want to respect me? Since you don't, then why should I?\" Duan Lengya did not have one hundred percent of confidence that he would win against Yan Fengfeng. But, the situation laid before him was in his favor—his ice attack had already wounded Hai Wuya even more severely. As soon as the latter fell, he and Lin Ku could easily take down Yan Fengfeng. It was exactly why he decided to ambush Hai Wuya.</p><p>\"Brother Duan, you stall Yan Fengfeng. I will take care of Hai Wuya.\" Lin Ku had already started his attack. He knew that the opportunities did not come easily.</p><p>\"Alright then, let's do it quickly!\"</p><p>Duan Lengya had a cold light in his eyes. The ice-cold power continued to roar outside his body, looking like it could explode at any time.</p><p>\"Brother Hai, I will come save you.\"</p><p>Ye Chen would not just sit there and watch Duan Lengya and Lin Ku get what they wanted. Normally, he would not take out his half-step extreme rank great sword out, but even if he did right now, he might still not be able to win against Lin Ku. However, on joining forces with Hai Wuya, they would have quite some chance of doing so.</p><p>\"Head sister, let's do this!\" Ling Tianhao and Miao Yin jumped out as well.</p><p>Li Xiaoyun exchanged a look before deciding to fly right behind Yan Fengfeng and the others. Although they did not have anything to do with Lin Ku and Duan Lengya, these two were just pissing them off too much. Plus, Ye Chen had also come from the southern regions, and one would have to help one another when far away from home.</p><p>Shoo! Shoo!</p><p>On the other side, the two brother disciples of Duan Lengya also stood up with very unfriendly expressions.</p><p>On one side were seven warriors, while there were four on the other. It looked like Ye Chen had the upper hand in this battle. But, Hai Wuya was wounded after all, and Lin Ku's battling power was not affected at all.</p><p>There were a couple hundreds of meters between the two groups as they just stood there preparing to attack.</p><p>Everyone watching the fight was holding their breath, staring at them without even blinking. They knew that the two parties were about to have an epic battle that would be intense for sure.</p><p>Duan Lengya smiled as he lifted up his hand, slowly pushing out the word, \"Do…i…\"</p><p>Before he could finish the word \"it\", another beautiful young man appeared out of nowhere on a mountain far away. He wore white robes which had small chrysanthemum sewn on top. He was just standing there quietly, but that powerful aura of his had already spread out. Everyone felt so tiny in the presence of that powerful wave of aura as if they were facing the whole world, and the young man was just the center of the whole universe.</p><p>\"Stop now! This is the Sky Martial Pavilion still, not a battling field for you lot.\" The young man said lightly.</p><p>\"Ba… Bai Wuxue! It is Bai Wuxue!\"</p><p>\"One of the top five powerful young warriors of all time, Bai Wuxue! Why is he here? How could I not detect that at all!\"</p><p>Everyone was frightened.</p><p>Ye Chen frowned. He did not keep his soul power spread out the whole time. Therefore, the appearance of the pretty young man was out of the blue for him as well. Because everyone around here was at the Sea of Souls Realm, even though they did not have their soul power spread out as well, they should have very sensitive senses. The young man was able to appear without a sound, so his power was not hard to imagine.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
