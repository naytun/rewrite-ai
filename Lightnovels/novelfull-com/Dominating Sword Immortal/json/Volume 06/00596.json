All he knew was that his power might not be weaker than his own. As for how much more powerful exactly, he would need to observe more to tell. Meanwhile, Ao Wubai was not that easy to take on either. So, the result of this battle was still unpredictable.</p><p>\"Eight Ruin Wolf Fist!\"</p><p>Ao Wubai's movements were very strange, seeming like a wolf as he waved out his fist. That rich wind turned into a hungry wolf and ran out while roaring, bringing up strange magic power as if there was a full moon in the sky.</p><p>\"Wolf will power? Oh right, this guy carries the bloodline of the Blue eyed white wolf.\"</p><p>He!</p><p>A scream that had a puncturing power was heard. Ye Chen jumped into the air and his Zhen yuan, which was way more powerful now, exploded at once as he stabbed toward the head of that hungry wolf.</p><p>\"Wolf Shadow Jump!\"</p><p>Ao Wubai did not care for the outcome of his fist attack at all as he had jumped as well, disappearing in front of Ye Chen immediately. Soon, shadows appeared one after another one after another. In the beginning, these were human shadows, before eventually turning into the shadows of wolves.</p><p>\"Hehe! It seems like Ao Wubai did not underestimate his opponent, even performing his wolf shadow jump. Yan Fengfeng, I will ask you again…will you just leave? I admit that you are very powerful, but your friends might not be.\" Moqi Lou looked at Yan Fengfeng confidently.</p><p>\"I believe that they will not lose!\"</p><p>Blue flames appeared in her back like a pair of massive wings. Meanwhile, her hands turned into massive blue jade phoenix claws which looked rather skinny in comparison to dragon or tiger claws. But, their sharp edges were already enough to scare Moqi Lou a bit.</p><p>\"Alright, since you will not listen, then I will not waste time to say it. Everyone, let's go! Whoever manages to kill them, I will give him a bit more of the dragon blood plants.\"</p><p>\"Awoo!\"</p><p>\"Garrrrr!\"</p><p>The semi beasts had the characteristics of beasts, in a way that when they got mad, they could become extremely brutal and cruel. Being stimulated by the prospect of the dragon blood plants, they jumped at their opponents excitedly.</p><p>\"Moqi Lou, you lost to me three years ago. I wonder what kind of improvement you have today.\" Yan Fengfeng's speed would be incomparable at her level in this world right now. It took her only one step before she reached right in front of Moqi Lou, her unbreakable Blue Jade Phoenix Claw extending out and trying to get at her opponent's skull.</p><p>\"Three years ago, I had only lost to you by one attack. Today, I will repay that debt in double.\"</p><p>Both hands of Moqi Lou turned into white gold tiger claws, the hair on top seeming crystal clear as if they were made by the purest metals and being full of texture. The tiger claws were like irons, their thickness and sharpness enough to shock people. These claws gave people the sensation of death instantly, as if they were designed to reap lives.</p><p>Dang!</p><p>Moqi Lou clawed out once, blocking out Yan Fengfeng's attacks.</p><p>\"Phoenix Peak!\"</p><p>Yan Fengfeng's other blue phoenix claw tightened, attacking toward Moqi Lou's eyes.</p><p>\"Tiger God Whip!\"</p><p>A beam of white light flashed once as a meter-long, white-gold colored tiger tail whipped out from behind Moqi Lou, whiplashing onto Yan Fengfeng's wrist.</p><p>\"Great!\"</p><p>A fire started to burn behind her eyes as she took a couple of steps back while the pair of fire wings behind her back reached out for dozens of meters.</p><p>…</p><p>Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!</p><p>The powerful claw attacks continued to be shot out as Ao Wubai increased his attacking speed to the maximum.</p><p>Ting! Ting!</p><p>Ye Chen's step art was controlled within one step while his thunder disaster sword was like a poisonous snake, clashing with Ao Wubai's claw shadow.</p><p>\"I cannot win him with my speed?\"</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>The Wolf shadow jumped away, and Ao Wubai's body was revealed.</p><p>\"I think I have underestimated you, but this is for the better. Otherwise, it might be too boring. Now, this will be the real deal. Bloodline infusion!\" He roared, and a blue eyed white wolf shadow infused right into his body. His skull and face started to extend longer and longer while his fangs grew out, and his whole body was then covered in white hair. His back muscles swelled up, also covered in white hair; then, it was his arms, before reaching his stomach and legs. Meanwhile, his clothes had been torn apart into pieces.</p><p>Within a second, Ao Wubai had become a standing werewolf covered in white hair, his muscles overlapping each other while his arms and legs had become extremely long. The fluffy wolf tail waved behind it, making the wolf beast look extra masculine and full of power.</p><p>\"So powerful! Each time I use the power of my bloodline, it makes me feel so great! But unfortunately, it can only last fifteen minutes. But, it would be more than enough to take you down.\"</p><p>\"Die!\"</p><p>Leaning his body forward, Ao Wubai's speed increased to maximum. His right wolf claw reached toward Ye Chen's heart, so fast that it drew a beam of white light behind it.</p><p>\"So fast!\"</p><p>It was Ye Chen's first time seeing a semi beast transformation.</p><p>\"Speed Sword Hell!\"</p><p>The Thunder Disaster Sword disappeared completely in front of Ye Chen and the sword light covered the whole area, leaving no gaps at all.</p><p>\"Break!\"</p><p>Ao Wubai reached through the sword light wall, his claws continuing to reach forward.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>Ye Chen moved a couple of steps sideways, but his right shoulder still had a tear on it, revealing the gold armor with its gold shine.</p><p>\"You cannot get away from this.\"</p><p>Ao Wubai turned around and his powerful right leg reached out, the paw not being any slower than the claw. They were both extremely sharp, and its attacking range would be its additional advantage.</p><p>Dang!</p><p>After he waved his sword horizontally in front of him, Ye Chen was blown backward.</p><p>\"Huh, fast reflexes indeed! But, I would like to see how long you can hold on exactly. After transforming into my beast mode, my speed and power are exploding. The more anger I feel, the more powerful and faster I get. This is the power that no human can compete with.\"</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>Ao Wubai disappeared once again, and when he reappeared, he was already dozens of steps behind Ye Chen's back.</p><p>Sparks appeared on the sword again, and Ye Chen was somehow half a step away from where he was standing before. If it were not for the claw shadow lingering in front of him still, no one would be able to tell that they had just exchanged an attack already.</p><p>\"Impossible! How did he get away! This attack should be even faster than before! The smile on his face froze and Ao Wubai's pupils shrank as he stared at Ye Chen with incredulity.</p><p>Ye Chen said lightly, \"Even if you get twice as fast, it would be impossible for you to hurt me.\" Speaking of the Sea of Souls Realm, Yan Fengfeng's speed was one of the fastest, but in terms of reflexes, observation, and coordination, no one could compete with Ye Chen. No one right now could hurt him with only speed, unless it happened in a head-on attack.</p><p>Over on the other side, Yan Fengfeng and Moqi Lou were still in that intense battle as she laughed, \"I've told you, they will not lose.\"</p><p>In fact, Ye Chen's performance had shocked even Yan Fengfeng to some degree. Ao Wubai's speed had increased to the level where he was not that slower than her, but Ye Chen was still able to turn around within a second. In other words, even if it were her, she would not have the confidence to win against Ye Chen with her speed.</p><p>\"So what? Even if my speed cannot be an advantage, I bet my power can.\" Moqi Lou started to reconsider Ye Chen's abilities. He knew that the latter's power might be just as powerful as Hai Wuya's. But, his general power was even more powerful, and even his enhanced speed could not work on him.</p><p>\"Wolf mutation! Teeth explosion!\"</p><p>After knowing that his speed could not win against Ye Chen, Ao Wubai decided to fight him head-on. Of course, his speed was still the main winning point, but he just added in more power.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Ao Wubai's claws were so fast that they turned into a beam of white line in the air. With a glance, it looked like a massive wolf tooth which was attacking right at Ye Chen's skull.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A beam of sword-shaped light welcomed the attack, and the two went past one another while a swirly qi flow exploded between the two.</p><p>\"Wolf Mutation, double exploding teeth!\"</p><p>Turning around, Ao Wubai ran toward Ye Chen once again. Both of his hands reached forward, with one being in the front and the other in the back, seeming like the teeth from a massive wolf.</p><p>On the other side, the thunder disaster sword attacked out first while the gold sword went up backward. The two swords formed a perfectly crossed sword light, blocking out the incoming wolf teeth attack.</p><p>\"Die!\"</p><p>At this point, Ao Wubai kicked up with his knees.</p><p>\"Thunder Bird Change!\"</p><p>The thunder disaster sword suddenly left his hand as Ye Chen formed his right hand into a fist and an attack landed onto Ao Wubai's chest, bringing up electricity everywhere.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>With that, Ao Wubai was blown into the air.</p><p>\"How can you be even faster than me!\" Ao Wubai puked out a chunk of blood and exclaimed in shock.</p><p>\"I am not faster than you. It is you not adapting to your extreme speed and power. It is impossible for you to control it fully right now, and I have already noticed your incoordination right from the beginning.\"</p><p>A person with a suddenly gained extreme power would not be able to control it perfectly and smoothly, and it would be impossible for the person to transform that newly-gained power into his own power. The slightest flaw in that process could be fatal in a battle. So, after a couple of rounds, Ye Chen had already seen right through him. The second that a change in his movement happened, he would know that an ace attack was coming, so he could attack in advance.</p><p>\"Void Shattering!\"</p><p>The index finger of Ye Chen stuck out, and a beam of light shot out of it. With that, a massive blue finger pressed onto Ao Wubai's chest.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Blood and flesh splashed into the sky from Ao Wubai's chest as he crashed into that heavy mad wind.</p><p>\"Ao Wubai lost!\"</p><p>Moqi Lou, who was still battling with Yan Fengfeng, was a bit shocked when he saw the result, and in that split second of distraction, Yan Fengfeng kicked him in the stomach, the blue flame exploding a little bit as well.</p><p>\"Back out!\" Blood puked out of his mouth as Moqi Lou groaned madly. The other three would be fools not to know what had just happened—the most powerful Moqi Lou and Ao Wubai had both been wounded. If they stayed, then it would only mean death for the rest of them. So, they jumped into the wild wind to escape even at the risk of being wounded. Hai Wuya and the other two were not able to stop them at all.</p><p>\"You want to run!\"</p><p>Yan Fengfeng's speed had been performed to the maximum as she chased after them.</p><p>\"Sky Tiger Roar!\"</p><p>Moqi Lou roared, and the heavenly tiger shadow roared as well. Time seemed to have frozen in that moment, and the space shaken.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>The short second was already enough for Moqi Lou to get away, disappearing in the mad wind.</p><p>\"This attack contained a mental attack!\" Yan Fengfeng stopped chasing after them.</p><p>\"These semi beasts are so annoying.\" Hai Wuya walked up and shook his head. Out of the other three, he had picked the most powerful one, and was still able to maintain his advantage. However, his opponent was very enduring, and it seemed impossible to beat him within a short period of time. Plus, all of those semi beasts had some kind of weird ability.</p><p>Yan Fengfeng said, \"Killing only one or two of them would not make a difference.\"</p><p>\"Yeah!\" Ye Chen nodded. If there were only Ao Wubai, he would have let out his wolf beast. However, there were five of them, and it would be impossible to kill them all. If even one of them got away, it would be tricky, since the rest of the Ao family might attack back, which would be rather problematic.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
