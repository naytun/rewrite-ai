But, it is a shame that he does not have any extreme rank spirit stones.\"</p><p>Pushed his soul power into Tyrant Fist Master's storage ring, Ye Chen smiled lightly. Added with his top rank spirit stones, he had now eight hundred thousand of them. It was not a small number; just by himself, his wealth would put him at the top of the ranks amongst the powerful Sea of Souls Realm warriors.</p><p>The Gu Lan Region and the Sky Martial Region had only one region in between. Five days later, Ye Chen arrived into the Sky Martial Region on his flying puppet. After another ten days, Ye Chen could already see the mountains of the Phoenix Cry Mountain groups.</p><p>The mountain group was one of the top three biggest mountains of the Sky Martial Region, covering one hundred thousand miles. After flying for another long while, Ye Chen had finally arrived in the central region of the mountain group. After arriving, Ye Chen had to get off the flying puppet. In his sight, hundred miles tall mountains stood one after another like sky-rocketing columns. And, on top of those mountains were all kinds of huge palaces. Some of them were truly massive, and some were relatively small. All of them could only be seen vaguely behind the veil of the clouds.</p><p>In Ye Chen's eyes, each one of them was like a beehive, with blacks dots going in and out like busy bees.</p><p>\"It is indeed the Phoenix Cry Mountain, just like its reputation. Each one of those hills is way bigger than the mountains in the Sky Cloud Martial School, with a much greater majesty.\"</p><p>Ye Chen was surprised at the difference between martial institutions.</p><p>\"Who are you? Why are you here in our Mysterious Martial School?\"</p><p>A blood red figure shot out of the Million Blade Mountain Palace that was closest to Ye Chen, as fast as lightning. Within a flash, it arrived right in front of Ye Chen.</p><p>It was a scholarly middle aged man in dark red long robes. Judging by his speed, he must be one of the top Sea of Souls Realm warriors. But, the mountain he was from was only a middle ranged one.</p><p>Ye Chen said while holding his fists in front of him, \"I am Ye Chen from the South Rudra Region. I have something that I would like to talk to the leader of Mysterious Martial School, the Mysterious Queen.\"</p><p>The Mysterious Martial School created by the Mysterious Queen had more female disciples than male ones, which made it the place that almost every female warrior wanted to go to.</p><p>\"Ye Chen from the Sky Cloud Martial School in the South Rudra Region?\" The middle-aged man in red robes seemed to have heard about Ye Chen. Of course, it was not because of Ye Chen's popularity, since in fact, his name had never been heard of before inside the Sky Martial Region. The reason that he was able to recognize Ye Chen's name was because the Mysterious Queen had mentioned his name a couple years ago in a meeting. Being able to be mentioned by his leader would be something worth high priority, which was why he had purposely memorized it for future reference.</p><p>\"Indeed!\"</p><p>\"I am Zhang Dehuo, the leader of this mountain. You go wait in the Fire Cloud Palace for now. Have a cup of tea while I go notify the leader. \" The Fire Cloud Mountain was only one of the thirty-six mountains of the Mysterious Martial School, and also the first line of defense. Zhang Dehuo knew very well who Ye Chen was; therefore, he would not dare to make him wait for long.</p><p>Ye Chen nodded, following him to the lobby of the palace.</p><p>After he had waited for a while, Zhang Dehuo had come back.</p><p>\"Ye Chen, leader has asked to see you!\"</p><p>There were forty-eight important mountains inside the Mysterious Martial School, with three top mountains, nine middle ones, and thirty-six minor ones. With the guidance of Zhang Dehuo, there was no restriction of any sorts for Ye Chen on the way to the main mountain. On the first glance, the whole mountain was covered in a crystal mist. Ye Chen knew that it would be the protection for the whole martial institution. If someone wanted to break in with force, even if it were a Life and Death Realm warrior, it would take him or her forever to do so.</p><p>Whoo!</p><p>The mist separated to the sides, revealing a huge crystalline door. Zhang Dehuo said, \"I will not go inside.\"</p><p>Without anything too important, the mountain leaders would not be allowed to step into the main mountain, which was an official rule of the martial institution.</p><p>Ye Chen held his fist and greeted Zhang Dehuo before flashing and entering the place.</p><p>Going through the mist, Ye Chen realized how wonderful it was inside, which was way much bigger than how it looked from the outside. It was like entering another world. Besides, the spirit qi in here was richer than outside, and even the air seemed to be richer. With just one breath, one could feel the spirit qi entering one's body, purifying itself into pure Zhen yuan.</p><p>\"What a place!\" Ye Chen commented as he looked over at the pretty female disciple.</p><p>\"You are Ye Chen.\"</p><p>She was just like Ye Chen, at the peak level Early Sea of Souls Realm. She seemed to be twenty-three years old. But of course, it was just on the surface, since after reaching the Sea of Souls Realm warrior, the appearance would stop aging. For example, Ye Chen was about to turn twenty-five, but he did not look a day older than twenty.</p><p>He had come to other people's turf, so he knew that he had to be extra polite. He smiled, \"Indeed! I wonder how I could address you, sister disciple?\"</p><p>\"I am the third disciple of the leader, Miao Yin. Follow me.\"</p><p>Mysterious Queen did not stay at the Mysterious Mountain. Instead, she stayed above it where a floating peak was present, just like the Floating Mountain. Of course, the one she stayed on was not as big as the floating mountain, and its materials were indeed not at the same level. This one in front looked like either gold or jade. Vaguely, power patterns seemed to spread out from within it. On top of the floating peak was a pond and a couple of wooden houses.</p><p>Next to the pond, a twenty-something-year-old girl was feeding the fish. Her hair were long like waterfalls, reaching all the way down to her feet. She looked peaceful and friendly.</p><p>\"Miao Yin, you can leave us now.\"</p><p>\"Yes, teacher.\"</p><p>That pretty girl named Miao Yin left respectfully.</p><p>After stepping onto the floating peak, Ye Chen had noticed her. Right then, Mysterious Queen was different from the projection in the parallel space battlefield. She was more peaceful and down to earth in person, a little bit less of the shocking prettiness from the projection.</p><p>\"Mysterious Queen, sorry to disturb your peacefulness.\"</p><p>The latter smiled lightly, \"My name is Yan Qingxuan. You can call me Senior Yan.\"</p><p>\"Senior Yan.\"</p><p>\"Do you need something from me?\" The two stood across a small pond. The Mysterious Queen asked as she fed the fish.</p><p>Ye Chen nodded, \"It has something to do with Murong Qingcheng.\"</p><p>\"What happened to her?\"</p><p>Mysterious Queen lifted up her head; she seemed to be quite caring about Murong Qingcheng after all, since the latter was indeed a great potential for something great in the future.</p><p>\"Qingcheng is fine, but her mother Su Ruhui had been poisoned by the Yuwen family's Shadowless Poison. The only antidote has been destroyed by Yuwen Jin. Therefore, I wish to request Mysterious Queen to save Su Ruhui.\"</p><p>Ye Chen told her what he was here for.</p><p>\"Yuwen familyâ€¦ Shadowless Poison! Damn!\" She was a bit upset and pissed off. She had been trying her best to help the demi demon family, hoping that the humankind would treat the demi demons better and more equally. But, some of the demi demon family members did not even wait for peace. They were trying their best to ruin the peace now. She had already heard about Yuwen family's brutality and recklessness, but she had still never expected that they would poison their own people, especially with such a potent poison.</p><p>\"Senior, would you know how to treat it?\"</p><p>Ye Chen was still quite confident about Mysterious Queen's knowledge. He knew that she was not only extremely powerful, but she was also great at other things, especially in healing.</p><p>\"The extreme poisons in this world are only less than what you can count with two hands, and I can heal more than one hands worth. But unfortunately, this Shadowless Poison is indeed the other half that I cannot cure.\"</p><p>\"Even senior Yan cannot cure it?\"</p><p>Ye Chen's heart sank. Of course, there was an antidote for the Shadowless Poison in this world, but the ingredients for it would be extremely hard to find. Some of the ones were things he had never even heard of, even with the knowledge from the Battle Emperor.</p><p>The Mysterious Queen said, \"Don't worry! Although I cannot heal her completely, but I can still extend her lifespan by a couple of years.\"</p><p>Hearing that, Ye Chen finally let out a breath. With few years of extra time, the hope would be still there.</p><p>\"Shadowless Poison is not that easy to take on. You and I should go there and have a look.\"</p><p>As she said so, she made a gesture in the air and a surreal door appeared on top of the pond.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>She stepped into it, and Ye Chen followed without any hesitation as well. In the deep parts of the surreal space, the door continued to flash. Each flash would mean that they had traveled an unbelievable distance.</p><p>After fifteen minutes, the door appeared inside the branch of the Yellow Dragon Palace.</p><p>Walking out from the door, Ye Chen could not be more shocked. He knew that Life and Death Realm warriors were extremely powerful, but he had not expected her to travel seven hundred thousand miles that he took dozens of days to go through in only fifteen minutes. It had exceeded his imagination.</p><p>\"Mysterious Queen!\"</p><p>After seeing Mysterious Queen and Ye Chen appearing in the room all of a sudden, Murong Zhishui and Murong Qingcheng were caught off guard.</p><p>Waving her hand, Mysterious Queen looked over at Su Ruhui, who was looking rather pale.</p><p>\"Luckily, we came early. The poison gas is already devouring her body.\"</p><p>\"Senior, please, I beg you to save my wife!\"</p><p>Murong Zhishui was so anxious for the past couple of days. In the beginning, Su Ruhui was still looking just the same, and nothing had really changed for her. But, after dozens of days, the situation seemed to have worsened. The poison seemed to pour out of nowhere and had started to eat her body from within. Even her Zhen yuan could not stop it.</p><p>\"You, get out! Mysterious Queen said.</p><p>\"Mister, Qingcheng, let's go out for now.\" Ye Chen dragged the two to leave.</p><p>The treatment time was not that long. After a pot of tea worth of time, the door had been opened.</p><p>Murong Zhishui and Murong Qingcheng looked over. After seeing that Su Ruhui was standing there looking like her old self, they both thought that she was cured, so they hurried to thank Mysterious Queen.</p><p>Mysterious Queen said with a forced smile, \"Do not be too happy. The poison is still there. I had just pushed back the lifespan by three years. After three years, the sealing art will not be able to stop the Shadowless Poison. It will even be a helper for the poison, and increase its potency. No one will be able to save her at all at that time. Therefore, within three years, you have to find all the ingredients for the antidote.\"</p><p>Ye Chen said, \"Mister, Qingcheng, you don't have to worry too much. Three years is already quite long, and it should be enough for us to find everything. Plus, I already have a couple of the ingredients, so it should not be too much of a problem.\"</p><p>He flipped his left hand, revealing a couple of spirit plants which he had gotten from the Treasure River Island.</p><p>As for the formula for the antidote, all the high level people in the demi demon family knew about it. And of course, it would be impossible for the Mysterious Queen not to know about it.</p><p>She was not surprised to see Ye Chen having these sprit plants, since every martial genius had his or her own opportunities. Without a doubt, Ye Chen would have even more than normal ones.</p><p>\"Ye Chen, from now on, you can go and travel inside the Sky Martial Region. Perhaps, you would be able to find some of the ingredients.\"</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
