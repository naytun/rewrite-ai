Each harvest from it would mean that it had accumulated enough and managed to make massive progress. Then, as it gave more fruit, its effect would improve as well. If the first harvest gave it intelligence, then this would be its second harvest.</p><p>On the tree, the red fruits could be seen changing into a fiery red shade soundlessly. Once they completed their transformation, they would be ripe for harvest. However, the four groups nearby was not looking at the fruits. Instead, they were looking at each other as the atmosphere grew more intense.</p><p>\"Since there are four groups here, I think we should divide the fruits into four batches. Each group will get one fruit, how about that?\" Tian Yinsou had been thinking of taking on the bulky middle-aged men so he could split the fruits between himself and Tai Shinchong but it seems he had left that train of thought to die a long time ago. With four groups present, there would always be another group that would push you into a corner regardless of who you attack, especially since nobody could know with absolute certainty the outcome should a battle break out. Even Tian Yinsou was slightly worried, which was why he made such a proposal — to reduce the risk as much as possible.</p><p>The bulky middle-aged looking man sneered, \"Four batches. How convenient. Do you think we can't see what situation you're in? You're all alone and yet, you dare ask for an entire batch of fruit to yourself. How stupid do you think we are?\"</p><p>\"Indeed. You don't have the right to get the fruit.\"</p><p>Hai Wuya's line of thinking was even more extreme. The Long Live Fruit's value could not be underestimated. With one person less to share the harvest, it would be better for the rest by leaps and bounds, especially since there were so many of them. In fact, there were already five people on Hai Wuya's side alone.</p><p>Tian Yinsou's expression darkened. \"Despite decades having passed, some people still don't treat me as they should. I've reached the Seas of Soul Realms master level decades ago. That's a long time before you guys were even born. Since you lot don't think I should get one, then lets go at it with our own methods. May the best win.\"</p><p>He did not realize that decades had passed and no one would recognize him. Even if they did, why would they be afraid of him?</p><p>\"I agree. The most powerful one gets them all.\"</p><p>Tai Shichong's voice sounded aloof and chilly. He did not like the idea of giving his Long Live Fruit since each of them by itself could bring a warrior's cultivation level from the peak of the early Seas of Souls Realm to the mid-rank. It would have a success rate of 90% to boot! However, should one want to reach the late realm from the peak of the Mid Seas of Souls Realm, a single fruit would only have a success rate of roughly thirty percent so he would need at least two to three fruits to be certain.</p><p>\"I don't have a problem with that.\"</p><p>Yan Fengfeng had speed on her side. Without any mishaps, she would be the one getting most of the fruits.</p><p>\"Let's do this then.\"</p><p>The bulky middle-aged man knew that this would the only solution.</p><p>It was settled. Everyone seemed to be safe for the time being as they looked back at the tree, waiting for it to fully mature before the fruits' eventual fall from the tree.</p><p>\"One fruit would give me an 80% chance of reaching the mid-realm from the peak of the Early Seas of Soul realm. If I miss the action this time around, I might not be able to progress without a year or two of hard work. That alone is reason enough for me to want… no, need one of those fruits!\"</p><p>Once one reached the Seas of Souls Realm, every single inch of progress would be incredibly hard to achieve. Ye Chen's training potential was not the best but instead, could only be described as being above average. The only reason he was able to reach the Seas of Souls Realm this fast was because of all the opportunities he had along with the talents of his soul.</p><p>If he was able to get just one fruit, he would be able to reach the mid-realm fairly easily and with his Heaven and Earth spirit pellet, he would be able to pull through to the peak of the next level. If that were the case, his overall power would not just increase by a little. In fact, he would be in a league of his own.</p><p>\"I need one.\"</p><p>As Ye Chen let out a gentle breath, his expression change to one of seriousness.</p><p>There were dozens of Long Live Fruits growing on the tree. Half of them were still light red in color which meant that they still had a ways to go before maturing. The other half, on the other hand, already had three of them changing to a fiery red which meant that they were just one step away from full maturity. In fact, one of the fruits was already shaking and looked like it was going to drop off at any moment.</p><p>Smack!</p><p>Finally, the Long Live Fruit fell down from the tree and landed onto the ground.</p><p>The strange thing was that nobody seemed to want to make the first move. They seemed to all be a little hesitant.</p><p>\"Tian Yinsou, didn't you desperately want the Long Live Fruit? Go on, get one for yourself!\" The bulky looking middle-aged man laughed at Tian Yinsou.</p><p>The later sneered, \"I'll let you have the first one then, go on.\"</p><p>\"Really? You're going to be this nice to me?\"</p><p>\"Aren't you as well?\"</p><p>On the other side of all this, Tai Shichong shot a glance at the fruits on the ground. His eyes had a glimmer to them before they eventually calmed down.</p><p>\"No one seems to want to risk this!\" one of the twins said.</p><p>\"Who would dare to though? If the Long Live Tree still attacks the people who makes an attempt at getting close, then we'll all have to die and that's just for one fruit! It doesn't seem worth it at all. Right now, what we need is for someone to inspect it. As long as someone goes over there and picks up the fruit without being attacked by the tree, we'll know there's no danger to our life any longer.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, that's right. What do we do now then? Do we just wait forever?\"</p><p>Over at Ye Chen's side, Hai Wuya was frowning. \"The second fruit is about to drop as well but unfortunately, nobody wants to be the first to try.\"</p><p>Ye Chen replied, \"Being the first one to go might not be a good thing as well since they'd become everyone's main target.\"</p><p>\"Ye Chen is right. The first fruit…very dangerous indeed.\" Yan Fengfeng nodded.</p><p>As time passed, there was still not a single one of them who would walk up to the tree. They all seemed to be waiting.</p><p>Caw!</p><p>Suddenly, a hysterical bird's cry was heard from above. As a massive grey eagle flew over, it would seem that its target was indeed the Long Live Fruit below.</p><p>Caw!</p><p>The grey eagle was extremely fast and it arrived under the Long Live Tree within a second. Its claw grabbed onto the fruit that fell onto the ground before shooting back up into the sky and into the distance.</p><p>\"Come down here!\"</p><p>All of the sudden, at the same time, everyone attacked the eagle.</p><p>Gah!</p><p>With one cry, the grey eagle had been torn apart, causing the fruit to fall from the sky. Everyone was already in the midst of controlling their body's angle to make sure that they suffered little to no damage from the blast wave. The fruit itself was already very tough and contained a wave of immense energy to protect itself from the blast wave.</p><p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p><p>All of the sudden, four people moved — Yan Fengfeng, Tai Shichong, Tian Yinsou. and the bulky middle-aged man. These were the four most powerful among the groups and since there seemed to be no danger in obtaining the fruit, they could now comfortably take each other on in combat.</p><p>Amongst them, Yan Fengfeng was the fastest of them all. With a flash of light, Yan Fengfeng arrived close to the tree and tried to extract the fruit.</p><p>\"Natural Sword!\"</p><p>Tai Shichong pointed out his sword and a shadow of his sword appeared to block Yan Fengfeng from advancing, cutting him off from extracting the fruit. In the midst of all that, his body seemed to flash a few times and before long, he was already next to the tree.</p><p>\"Phoenix Cut!\"</p><p>Yan Fengfeng lifted his right hand, forming it into a handblade before attacking Tai Shichong.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Tai Shichong took out the long sword hanging from his waist and blocked the fiery power of Yan Fengfeng's blade.</p><p>\"Don't try to fight for it anymore! This fruit belongs to me!\" Tian Yinsou's body shook as dozens of black silhouettes appeared to head toward the fruit.</p><p>\"Piss off!\"</p><p>Although the middle-aged man was moving the slowest, it did not mean he could not get his hands on the fruit since four of them were all being suppressed by someone else. He yelled and lifted his iron bar into the sky before waving it horizontally, blowing away Tian Yinsou's silhouettes.</p><p>The fruit was still falling incredibly fast but the four were fighting at an even faster speed. Within a blink of an eye, the four had already exchanged many attacks.</p><p>\"Human Sword In One!\"</p><p>Tai Shichong waved his long sword and the light of his massive sword wrapped around him as he shot out toward the fruit at an extreme speed.</p><p>Boom! Boom!</p><p>Tian Yinsou and the bulky middle-aged man could not bear watching Tai Shichong get the fruit so they attacked one after the other in an attempt to break through Tai Shichong's sword qi that was wrapped around his body.</p><p>However, this protective layer of sword qi that he had was unexpectedly strong. Although it was covered in cracks, it remained intact. Instead, it managed to cancel out the joint attacks from the other two.</p><p>\"Major Phoenix Cut!\"</p><p>At that critical moment, Yan Fengfeng threw out a palm blade attack once more but this time, a Blue Phoenix's shadow was behind her. It was formed from her own body.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The protective layer broke. It made Tai Shichong very angry — he was so close to the fruit and his martial art technique even increase both his speed and defense to boot! Still, there were four of them battling for the fruit and it would be impossible for him to suppress all three of them alone.</p><p>\"This battle is indeed amazing.\" Ling Tianhao could not believe his eyes.</p><p>Guan Qin glanced at the second fruit that was getting riper and said, \"This one is about to mature as well. I'll use my flight technique and try to get to it as fast as possible.\"</p><p>Guan Qin was very confident with her flying art.</p><p>Hai Wuya laughed. \"Although your flying technique is impressive, they won't just stand there and watch you take the second ripe fruit away. In fact, we should also lay out some ground rules. The other three will help whoever gets the fruit first in blocking the attacks coming their way.\"</p><p>\"Naturally.\" Ye Chen nodded.</p><p>\"The second one is going to fall as well! Hurry up!\"</p><p>\"I'm so nervous!\"</p><p>The people Tai Shichong and the bulky middle-aged man brought along were all staring at the second fruit. If it were not for the fact that the tree would attack before the fruit was fully ripe, they would have all run up to it already.</p><p>Before everyone's eyes, the second Long Live Fruit fell down.</p><p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!</p><p>No one would describe the situation right now - the Long Live Fruit was only moments away from the ground when it fell from the tree. Everyone moved all at once, making it seem like they hundreds of arrows shooting out all at the same time.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>Five beams of light from the sword shot out from his body as Ye Chen's reached the limit of his speed. His initial speed was already 20 times the speed of light and knowing that one could continue to accelerate, Ye Chen managed to reach this kind of speed because he had just broken through on his Sword Light Flying Technique earlier and managed to reach 25 times the speed of light. To top it off, his extreme speed in controlling zhen yuan along with the fact that he had already reached the zhen yuan only made his speed even faster.</p><p>\"Such speed!\"</p><p>Hai Wuya and the other two were shocked.</p><p>With just a flash of light from the sword, Ye Chen had arrived under the Long Live Tree.</p><p>\"You little brat, die!\"</p><p>\"Die you brat!\"</p><p>\"If you dare to touch the fruit even once, I'll kill you all.\"</p><p>At that moment, the people who came with Tai Shichong and the bulky middle-aged man all attacked Ye Chen with an evil and reckless look. They wished they could tear Ye Chen apart on the spot.</p><p>\"How reckless.\" Hai Wuya shook his head.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
