To safeguard the sanctity of my clan, I'm justly acting to apprehend him.\"</p><p>Yuwen Jin was extremely apprehensive of Zhang Zhenguang. Although he didn't have much of a reputation as a Sea of Soul realm Master in the continent, he wasn't far off from the peak Masters. The two of them were not his match. But, even more importantly, he was the Yellow Dragon Hall Master. When it came to Ye Chen, one could still say that he was not a person of Dragon God Palace. However, the former was clearly one, and a high level one at that—one of the five Hall Masters.</p><p>Zhang Zhenguang glanced at Ye Chen and said, \"Then what's with Ye Chen and him fighting? Could it be that you didn't know Ye Chen is a genius that Palace Master holds in high regard? Or, is it that you simply don't care about my Dragon Gold Palace at all, and are just doing what you please?\"</p><p>Zhang Zhenguang clearly showed his bias toward Ye Chen.</p><p>\"Hall Master….\" Yao Yifeng immediately panicked. Zhang Zhenguang showing such clear support for Ye Chen certainly wouldn't result in anything good for him. It was completely opposite of what he had thought. In reality, Zhang Zhenguang had rushed over too fast, and it had caught him somewhat unprepared.</p><p>\"You shut your mouth!\" Zhang Zhenguang sent a glare towards Yao Yifeng.</p><p>The former had already learned of the crux of the matter through the information transmitted by Wang Shi. Yang Yifeng's actions had infuriated him. Ye Chen was a genius that Palace Master held in such a high regard, and despite that, Yao Yifeng treated him in this manner. It was simply making a joke of himself.</p><p>Yao Yifeng immediately swallowed the words in his throat down back. He secretly shot a glance at Ye Chen, his eyes containing a hidden killing intent.</p><p>Seeing Zhang Zhenguang treating Yao Yifeng in such a manner, Yuwen jin's frown intensified,\" Ye Chen's connection with Murong clan is not shallow, so he was obstructing my clan. Yuwen Lie was merely holding him back. We had no intentions of creating trouble for him.\"</p><p>Yan Kui sneered, \"Great Elder of Yuwen Clan, you sure can lie through your teeth. I won't mention the matter of Mo Luo sneak attacking junior brother Ye, since you'll simply deny it. However, later on, I heard that your clan asked Ye Chen to kneel and apologize. If he didn't, you wouldn't allow him to leave. Then, your son and Ye Chen had a fair match, and your son got injured. In that anger, you acted while saying that you'll discipline brother Ye in place of Dragon God Temple. What about that?\"</p><p>\"Eh? Such a thing happened as well!\" Zhang Zhenguang squinted his brows.</p><p>Yuwen jin turned uneasy from Yan Kui's manner. But, he summoned his courage and said, \"Today was the grand wedding of my son, but Ye Chen and the Murong clan came rampaging in. Under such circumstances, it was impossible for the Yuwen clan to sit still, and some actions were taken in the heat of the moment.\"</p><p>Shooting a glance at the Yuwen Clan's two high towers, Zhang Zhenguang spoke, \"Alright! I don't care what happened before, but I'm taking Ye Chen now. Do you something to say?\"</p><p>\"Of course, not.\"</p><p>Even if Yuwen Jin hated Ye Chen to the bone, he wouldn't dare say anything. He was quite clear that if he went against Zhang Zhenguang, the clan would probably abandon him. The clan might support him in secret, but they wouldn't allow him to do so in the open.</p><p>Ye Chen cupped his hands, \"Greetings Zhang Hall Master.\"</p><p>Zhang Zhenguang faintly smiled and nodded, \"Good! Although you had a half-step extreme grade sword's support, to confront Yuwen Clan's Master head-on and even gain a little advantage, you are even above Li Xiaoling.\"</p><p>\"Thanks for Hall Master's praise,\" Ye Chen continued, \"Murong Clan is Ye Chen's friend. As a friend, Ye Chen will advance and retreat with them.\"</p><p>His meaning was that if he were to leave, Murong Clan also had to leave.</p><p>Hearing these words, Zhang Zhenguang turned his head toward Yuwen jin, \"In that case, I'll be taking Murong Clan as well. Otherwise, I can't take Ye Chen with me.\"</p><p>\"This is not appropriate!\" Yuwen Jin's complexion sank.</p><p>\"What, are you not willing?\" Zhang Zhenguang's complexion sank similarly.</p><p>\"Murong Jiushi offended my Yuwen Clan. If he is allowed to leave, what honor would my clan be left with? Others can leave, but he can't.\"</p><p>\"I heard that you forced his daughter before, so there is not much of an issue in him being impulsive. I'll take him with me, so you don't need to allow him to leave.\"</p><p>Zhang Zhenguang's figure was tall and sturdy, while his words were even more domineering. Yuwen Jin clenched his palms and said gloomily, \"Hall Master Zhang, this is a matter of my clan. Please stay out of it.\"</p><p>\"So what if I don't?\"</p><p>Yuwen Jin's expression turned sharp, \"Palace Master Zhang, please have some respect for each other. Don't force me.\"</p><p>Zhang Zhenguang peered straight at Yuwen Jin, then abruptly burst into laughter, \"Force you? What qualifications do you have to make me force you? If I force you, what can you do? Surround me? I'm not looking down on you, but in your Yuwen clan, I alone am enough to sweep through all your clan experts. If you don't believe, you're welcome to try.\"</p><p>Battling all the Sea of Soul realm experts of Yuwen clan by himself didn't seem realistic. However, as far as the current experts on the battlefield were concerned, Zhang Zhenguang was confident.</p><p>Yuwen Jin's face turned extremely unsightly, blue veins popping out of his forehead. It was utter humiliation; he had not suffered such a humiliation ever in his life.</p><p>\"Do you want to try? I don't mind having a little warm up.\" Zhang Zhenguang seemed at leisure.</p><p>\"Jin-er, let them leave.\"</p><p>As Yuwen Jin was seething in resentment, a voice arrived in his ear. It was the Devil King's voice.</p><p>\"OId Ancestor has given his verdict!\"</p><p>Yuwen Jin was astonished. Subsequently, he clenched his teeth and said, \"As Zhang Hall Master wishes.\"</p><p>\"Palace Master Zhang.\" Murong Zhishui was obviously glad that the former was allowing Murong Clan to leave, but there were still matters that made him anxious.</p><p>\"What's the matter?\" Zhang Zhenguang glanced at Murong Zhishui.</p><p>Ye Chen spoke for Murong Zhishui, \"Hall Master Zhang, Yuwen clan has poisoned Uncle's wife and children. What uncle wants to ask is if the Yuwen clan has the antidote.\"</p><p>\"Poisoned?\"</p><p>Zhang Zhenguang was rather surprised. He didn't expect that Yuwen clan would stoop to poisoning, despite claiming themselves as upright and just.</p><p>\"Palace Master Zhang, there was only one antidote, which is already destroyed by me. There is no second one.\"</p><p>\"You really destroyed it?\"</p><p>Murong Zhishui still had some hope in his heart. He hoped that Yuwen Jin was lying.</p><p>\"Hmph! Of course, I destroyed it.\"</p><p>Yuwen Jin was a bit pleased. The Shadowless Poison was one of the mystical poisons under the heavens. The materials for its antidote were extremely rare. Otherwise, Yuwen clan wouldn't have only one batch.</p><p>\"Since there is no antidote here, let's leave!\"</p><p>Zhang Zhenguang didn't care whether the counterpart had the antidote or not. It simply didn't make a difference; if the counterpart didn't wish to hand it over, he had no ways of making him do so. Only if a Life and Death King asked would the counterpart not dare to resist.</p><p>\"Zhishui, let's leave and try to come up with something!\" Su Ruhui comforted Murong Zhishui, and the latter nodded silently.</p><p>As Ye Chen and company left, Yuwen Jin sucked in a deep breath, then suddenly punched the plaza. With a bang, a crack extended in the plaza.</p><p>Today, Yuwen Clan had suffered double losses instead of gaining profit. They would become a laughing stock, and Yuwen Jin would be the main character in the joke.</p><p>…</p><p>In the Yellow Dragon Palace Hall…</p><p>Zhang Zhenguang was seated on the head seat, and down below were Yao Yifeng, Ye Chen, and others. As for Murong clan members, they were in another building.</p><p>\"Yao Yifeng, do you know your wrongs?\" Zhang Zhenguang coldly looked at the Yao Yifeng below.</p><p>Yao Yifeng continued to quibble, \"Hall Master, Ye Chen creates trouble wherever he goes. Sooner or later, he will bring troubles for our Dragon God Palace. For the sake of the Dragon God Palace, Yao Yifeng requests Hall Master to have a careful consideration.\"</p><p>\"Careful consideration, you say?\"</p><p>\"Hall Master...\"</p><p>Yao Yifeng was terrified inwardly, but also resentful. It was all Ye Chen's fault. If not for Ye Chen, he wouldn't have to suffer at all. If he couldn't have it good, Ye Chen shouldn't think he could get away either.</p><p>\"I'll settle your returns after returning. Wang Shi, after Yao Yifeng returns, you'll temporarily oversee the matters of Yellow Dragon Hall's affairs. Yan Kui, you'll help him. I'll send a new Deputy Hall Master soon.\"</p><p>Zhang Zhenguang had no intentions of wasting more words on Yao Yifeng. Who was Ye Chen? He was the hope of the Dragon Gold Palace. He was extremely clear about the current affairs of the Palace; there was no room for delay. They were eagerly waiting for some genius to mature, and Ye Chen was the biggest hope among these geniuses. And here, Yao Yifeng actually targeted Ye Chen. If Ye Chen drifted apart from Dragon God Palace due to this affair, even death of a hundred Yao Yifengs wouldn't make up for it. Fortunately, Wang Shi and Yan Kui informed him in time. Otherwise, it could have been extremely grave.</p><p>\"What?\"</p><p>Yao Yifeng didn't dare believe his ears. He was going to be replaced from the position of Deputy Hall Master? Just because he had treated Ye Chen unfairly?</p><p>\"Palace Master, although Yifeng was wrong, it was not to this extent. Yifeng has worked hard for the palace. This punishment…Yifeng cannot accept.\" Yao Yifeng was almost hysterical.</p><p>Zhang Zhenguang snorted coldly, \"Cannot accept? Come back with me and you'll accept it. Great Yellow Dragon Sealing Art.\"</p><p>Abruptly standing up, Zhang Zhenguang tossed a yellow light sphere. The light sphere floated before his chest, and as his hands made seals, the entire hall rumbled. A yellow dragon phantom charged out of the sphere and enshrouded Yao Yifeng.</p><p>\"Ah!\" Yao Yifeng tried to escape, but in the next moment, dozens of flickering light specks dispersed from the phantom dragon, making it increasingly small, and infiltrated Yao Yifeng's body.</p><p>\"My Zhen Yuan! My physical strength!\"</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
