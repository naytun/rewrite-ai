Now!\"</p><p>Right next to the river, Gu Ping suddenly stopped his body, his hands dancing in the air like butterflies as he formed his spell. Suddenly, a wave of invisible power spread out with him as the center. It was a very aggressive power, but somehow, it did not bring up any pattern on the surface of the water.</p><p>Wooo!</p><p>Under the surface, a blurry human shadow had been blown out. It could not help but get sucked toward where Gu Ping was.</p><p>\"This is the Shadowless Demon…I see! So creepy looking!\"</p><p>The top warriors that were accompanying Gu Ping suddenly felt a chill run down their spines as they could not help but take two steps back.</p><p>\"Don't be afraid! It cannot do anything while I am here.\" Gu Ping laughed brightly. The martial art he had gotten from those ruins was indeed a forbidden martial art of the puppet martial school, the Puppet Spell. It was different from the normal puppet art which used dead objects. Instead, it used living beings, which made it even more horrible. It was indeed the reason that the martial school had been destroyed completely.</p><p>\"Huh? It's wounded!\"</p><p>Gu Ping thought before that the process of training shadowless Demon would not be that simple, since he had never done that before. But, it actually went extremely well; he could tell that it was very weak at the moment, as if it had been wounded just now.</p><p>\"Shadowless Puppet, done!\"</p><p>After the formation of the spell, Gu Ping extended his left hand's five fingers and formed into a fist immediately. All of a sudden, the blurry human shadow shrank into a pile and appeared in his hand.</p><p>When he opened his left hand again, there was nothing there anymore, only a blurred ghost shaped mark that continued to twist and move.</p><p>\"Haha, it is finished! I cannot believe it was that easy!\"</p><p>After successfully creating a shadowless puppet, Gu Ping was full of confidence. He could already see countless powerful undead soldiers following behind him, fighting for him.</p><p>\"The Human Puppet Spell from the Puppet Martial School? That little brat is quite lucky as he actually got his hands on such a valuable thing. Unfortunately, it will not be that easy to train after all. If it were not for the fact that I had let go of my control over my Demon will formation, it would have turned him into a braindead idiot.\"</p><p>In the deep end of the underground world, a cold voice was heard.</p><p>\"Let's go! There should be more Shadowless Demons down there.\"</p><p>Gu Ping led the way proudly as all of the extreme Yin qi was absorbed by him into the mark on his palm.</p><p>…</p><p>\"Yeah, there is also one here, and it is not the one from before!\"</p><p>With his slaughter sword intent protecting his body, he sliced an incoming blurry human shadow into dozens of pieces.</p><p>\"What! Slaughter sword intent!\"</p><p>A shocked cry was heard again from the deep end of the underground world, seeming to be reacting to Ye Chen's movements.</p><p>\"Huh! My Demon spirit is at peal level rank 7, so those Demon will projections should be at least rank 5. I will see how much you could take on at once. Frankly, if you were a Life and Death Realm warrior, I might actually be afraid and reconsider whether it would be a waste to try. But, you are only at the Sea of Souls Realm. Even if you have the fitting sword intent power, your control over your sword intent is just not there yet. Let's go! Let's steal his body!\"</p><p>Soon, the world went back to dead silence.</p><p>Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo!</p><p>An invisible vibration pattern spread out in the area while countless blurry human shadows shot out of the river toward Ye Chen. His protective Zhen yuan layer suddenly looked like a decoration.</p><p>\"Kill!\"</p><p>His slaughter sword spirit shook within his soul ocean as the sword intent spread out circle after circle, with Ye Chen being the center. Not a single human shadow managed to get close; all of them seemed to lose their life force and sink into the river.</p><p>\"Come back!\"</p><p>A voice came from the bottom of the ground again, with which, those wounded human shadows were retrieved to where they came from. In the next second, more blurry human shadows appeared and entered the battle.</p><p>\"So many!\" Ye Chen's expression changed slightly.</p><p>\"Destruction sword intent...Now!\"</p><p>The second he used his destruction sword spirit, the second wave of his attack appeared. Meanwhile, he infused his destruction intent into the sword intent from his second sword spirit. As a result, a destruction sword intent with a slightly weaker power but more horrifying qi was generated.</p><p>Combined with the slaughter sword intent, it looked like a tornado, spreading in all directions. Those blurry human shadows had been cut into pieces first before being wiped clear by the destruction sword intent. Those human shadows had been dissolved completely, and there was no chance of recovering them anymore.</p><p>\"Damn! This destruction sword intent is even more horrifying than the slaughter sword intent! Where did he learn it?\"</p><p>\"No! This is obviously not working. If my Demon will formation continues to be destroyed like this, it will damage my Demon spirit severely. I will fight for the second group of those bodies first.\"</p><p>The being that was at the bottom of the underground seemed to be afraid of that destruction sword intent. Although the slaughter sword intent could destroy his Demon will as well, but in a one-on-one situation, the destruction sword intent would have a bigger impact for sure.</p><p>At the same time, all of the blurry human shadows jumped into the river, swimming upward quickly.</p><p>\"They are leaving?\"</p><p>Ye Chen frowned. He had just figured out why Zuo Qiu and Li Qignxiang could not handle even one Shadowless Demon. First of all, the two's martial spirit was only rank 4. Although his was also only at peak level rank 4, its power would be at least at peak level rank 5, so it was at least one and a half levels higher than the two. Secondly, his martial will was even more stable and balanced than his sword intent. His speed, defense, and attack had been enhanced. But, inside this underground crack, a slight enhancement meant mediocrity; if one's mental attacking power were not powerful enough, it would be impossible to wound the Shadowless Demon. Although the mental defense would have been increased, one would eventually be tired at some point, and that would be the moment those Shadowless Demons would crawl in and wound them.</p><p>However, Ye Chen's sword intent could destroy the Shadowless Demon instantly, even if there were many of them. As for mental defense, Ye Chen would not need it at all; before those Shadowless Demons managed to get close, his sword intent would be alerted already and start to protect him automatically.</p><p>Added with his destruction sword intent, it would be impossible to attack Ye Chen at all.</p><p>\"I will always find a way to deal with it later, and go find the Rootless Flower and Shadowless Plant first.\" Inside this extreme cold environment, Ye Chen was not scared at all. Walking on this path of martial arts, there was no fear or cowardice allowed. Moreover, the sword art path would be even tougher than the former.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>Turning into a beam of blue light, Ye Chen flew toward the lower stream.</p><p>…</p><p>\"Ah! Mr. Ping, please save me!\"</p><p>\"Something is eating my body! I don't think I can hang on!\"</p><p>\"Save me! I don't want to lose my body!\"</p><p>Screams were heard everywhere while Gu Ping's face was pale.</p><p>\"Where did all these Shadowless Demons come from? I cannot handle all of them all by myself!\"</p><p>If it were just two or three of them, Gu Ping was confident that he could take them out. In front of dozens of them, Gu Ping thought that he could protect himself still. Plus, according to the information from the pavilion, there were not many Shadowless Demons at all, so he should only be running into one occasionally.</p><p>\"Human Puppet Spell! Now!\"</p><p>The invisible power seemed like a net that spread out in a huge area, controlling dozens of Shadowless Demons that were trying to get the Gu family warriors' bodies.</p><p>But, those Demons' power was way stronger than the martial art. Even when Gu Ping pushed his power to maximum, he was not able to do anything. He could only helplessly watch those Shadowless Demons enter his fellow disciples' bodies.</p><p>\"Puppet pellet!\"</p><p>In that critical moment, Gu Ping threw out a pellet with creepy shine. It rolled on the ground and floated above his head. Soon, a similar power shot out from within, enhancing his martial art's power.</p><p>\"Come here.\"</p><p>With the pellet's help, Gu Ping's power increased drastically, and he managed to drag out dozens of them.</p><p>\"Huh! He even got the pellet. Indeed got great luck. But unfortunately, that is nothing in my eyes…Demon Will Drill!\"</p><p>The slight vibration spread out and four Shadowless Demons fused together, turning into a shapeless drill that drilled into that pellet.</p><p>Pap!</p><p>With that, the pellet seemed to crack, and the shine inside it was lost simultaneously.</p><p>\"No!\"</p><p>Gu Ping's eyes were wide open, looking like they were about to fall out. The Puppet Pellet was an aiding prop which could enhance his spell to the next level, It was indeed with his pellet that he dared to come down to this underground crack, since he also knew that his Human Puppet Spell had not been trained to completion yet.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>However, at this moment, the pellet shattered completely, turning into a vague light and disappearing into the darkness.</p><p>\"Escape!\"</p><p>Gu Ping did not think further; he knew that as long as he was still alive, he would be able to get more of his pellets and have more opportunities. So many Shadowless Demons had obviously exceeded his expectations and power margin.</p><p>\"Where do you think you are going?!\"</p><p>At that moment, more Shadowless Demons appeared, cornering the group.</p><p>\"Ah!\"</p><p>\"AHH!\"</p><p>Meanwhile, all of the warriors with Gu Ping had been taken, their eyes going white. That intense extreme Yin qi made them look completely different, almost like zombies.</p><p>As all of them were being taken away alive, Gu Ping looked like he had given up hope. He had never thought about the possibility of this happening, his great opportunity turning into his end.</p><p>Amongst all of the Shadowless Demons, one extra powerful one walked out. It had got its mouth wide open as if it was a black hole, devouring Gu Ping instantly. His body struggled a bit as he contained to push his martial will power to attack the blurry human shadow. But, the latter was somehow way more powerful than the rest.</p><p>After a long while, he finally stopped fighting back, letting the human shadow take over his body.</p><p>Pap!</p><p>His feet landed on the ground, his eyes opened. But, unlike the rest of them, his eyeballs did not turn in their sockets and go white; they were normal like before. However, there was a hint of blackness in the deep part of his eyes as if something horrifying seemed to be inside. But, the extreme Yin qi within was light; if one did not look carefully, it would be impossible to spot.</p><p>His mouth was pulled open, and a creepy noise came out of his throat.</p><p>\"Jiejie…I have finally found a great vessel. And now, I can finally go outside to see the world. But before that, I will get that boy's body as well. His seems to be more suitable for me. Once I have my two powerful formations, I might be able to get freed completely finally.\"</p><p>\"Let's go!\"</p><p>Gu Ping waved his hand and countless blurry human shadows jumped into the river water, floating along with him into the distance. All of the warriors from the Gu family followed behind like motionless puppets.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
