I have been waiting to see it myself as well.\" Ye Chen nodded. He had heard about it before, that it was one of the training locations for the martial geniuses inside the Sky Martial Region. Apparently, if one had reached the Seas of Souls Realm and did not go to the Savage Ruin Ancient Place, people would laugh at him or her. But of course, no one would really go there just for the reputation; the most attractive part of the place was that it was a perfectly-kept ancient place, so some of the rarest spirit plants could be found there. Plus, although the evil qi there was seemingly very threatening, it would actually serve to strengthen the warrior's mind.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>Yan Fengfeng took out a partial map from her spatial ring and rolled it out.</p><p>\"When we were in the place before, we were all plainly trying our luck. This time, I happened to get my hands on a partial map which displayed most of the areas in the south-east direction. If we are able to find this area, we would be much safer during our exploration.\"</p><p>As she spoke, she handed the broken map to the four.</p><p>Ye Chen read the map, seeing that there were bloody red dots on it marking the evil places. According to the level of redness, its danger level had been demonstrated. There were other cooler ones as well, but it did not mean that those places were not dangerous. After all those years, no one knew whether more drastic changes had taken place inside the places, so the map could not represent everything accurately. Moreover, it was an incomplete map after all.</p><p>\"It is always better with the map rather than going around blind.\" Hai Wuya could tell the value behind the map. If put on auction, it would be a couple times more valuable than a top rank item.</p><p>Putting away the map, Yan Fengfeng said, \"No time to lose, let's head out! With the flying ship's speed, we should be able to reach there in four days.\"</p><p>Whoo!</p><p>A silver ship that was a dozen meters long floated in mid-air. It was actually a massive puppet boat, which was much more valuable than Ye Chen's flying puppet.</p><p>\"I have been waiting to have one of these…Too bad that I never got the chance.\" Hai Wuya jumped on there first, seeming to know the internal design of the boat already. It was obviously not his first time cooperating with Yan Fengfeng.</p><p>Waiting until everyone had stepped onto the wide empty deck, light shone from in between Yan Fengfeng's eyebrows. A dark red flame shot out from the end of the silver boat as the powerful counterforce pushed the huge boat forward and increased its speed to almost the speed of sound.</p><p>\"Yan Fengfeng, you are also luckier than me. In the future, if you get some great treasures, please sell me this boat.\"</p><p>Hai Wuya apparently had kept thinking about it.</p><p>Yan Fengfeng laughed, \"I did not get it easily, and I don't think I can find better puppets.\"</p><p>Guan Qin said: \"Sister Yan, what does this flying ship do?\"</p><p>Hai Wuyan said for Yan Fengfeng: \"This is a top of the top rank puppet ship that can reach eight times the speed of sound. The defensive layer can handle ten spirit warriors' full powered attack, and even if it were from a couple of master warriors of Sea of Souls Realm, it should be able to hold together for a while. Besides the defense, there are a couple of puppet bombs on this ship as well—one bomb attack would be equal to one Seas of Souls Realm master level warrior's full attack. It would be able to kill anyone below the master level, and even master level warriors would have to escape to stay alive.\"</p><p>\"Wow, this powerful!\" Guan Qin gasped.</p><p>\"It is indeed a rare treasure.\" Ye Chen compared once before realizing that his own flying puppet was only slightly good in terms of speed, and way too behind in all other aspects.</p><p>Yan Fengfeng said to Ye Chen, \"Your flying mode should also be a puppet, right?\"</p><p>Ye Chen nodded, \"It is nothing compared to your flying ship though!\"</p><p>\"No, that is not true. Mine burns a lot of top rank spirit stones, which is the reason that it could be this powerful in all areas. But, your flying puppet is way smaller, and therefore, can focus on only one area.\" With Yan Fengfeng's fortune, even she would not use the flying ship all the time, since it was too huge and costly for simply flying already.</p><p>Ye Chen did not say anything. Through the soul power detection, he could tell that there were yuan qi pipes throughout the whole flying ship, and the rich spirit stone yuan qi would emerge from the deep part of the ship, continuously powering the whole ship. The stone burning speed was indeed shocking! Based on his estimation, its usage would be ten times more than that of his flying puppet.</p><p>The night darkened, and the flying ship disappeared within the darkness.</p><p>On the second day, the weather was quite pleasant. Ye Chen and the rest of them were standing on the deck, enjoying the calm beautiful weather.</p><p>\"Such a great puppet ship! It must be from Yan Fengfeng, right?\" Not far away from them, a huge tiger with massive wings was approaching swiftly. On top of the tiger's back were seven-eight teenagers. The leading guy had a massive body and a rich aura, his vision seeming extremely bright like lightning bolts. The person right next to him was no weaker than him as well; he carried the vibe of a wolf and had a cold look on his face.</p><p>Yan Fengfeng said with a cold tone, \"It is Wan Qilou!\"</p><p>\"Haha, the Savage Ruin Ancient Place...I hope you will not run into me. Otherwise, I will rob the puppet ship off you for sure!\"</p><p>\"This guy is still this arrogant.\" Hai Wuya made a face.</p><p>\"Head disciple, is he the young leader of the Heaven Tiger Race from the demi beast family, Wan Qilou?\" Guan Qin actually knew quite a lot.</p><p>\"Indeed! The Heaven Tiger Race was an ancient king race which was more powerful than the normal ones. This guy is not that great after all, but he is powerful nevertheless. And, that person right next to him should not be underestimated either. He is the second son of the Blue Eyed White Wolf Ao family, Ao Wubai, who is not that weaker than Wan Yilou.\"</p><p>\"Ao Wubai from the Ao family…\"</p><p>Ye Chen could not believe that he would run into people from the Ao family, since the Blue Eyed White Wolf bloodline had left a deep impression on him.</p><p>\"Of course, we do not need to be afraid of them! The ancestor of Wan Qilou had a similar talent as Yan Fengfeng's Blue Phoenix…It is just that he carries the bloodline of the Heaven Tiger.\" Although Hai Wuya had said that, it was only due to the fact that he did not want to overhype him for no reason, since no one would know for sure what would happen if they battled, since Yan Fengfeng was only at rank 9, which would be equivalent to the Mid Seas of Souls Realm. Even if her blue Phoenix bloodline was one of a kind, the ranking was still rather low compared to the others.</p><p>At that moment, Yan Fengfeng said, \"The Heaven Tiger race is good in terms of their speed. At the same time, the special power from his bloodline, the Heaven Tiger Roar, can shake the souls, and is extremely powerful.\"</p><p>\"Demi beasts also have special powers? It should be quite hard to come by, right?\" Ye Chen said.</p><p>Yan Fengfeng nodded, \"Once the beast race's bloodline purity gets to a certain level, the demi beasts would have their special powers. But, I heard that the perfect bloodline would have an even stronger special power. Unfortunately, there are already not that many martial geniuses left due to the fall of the demi demon families.\"</p><p>\"Indeed.\" Although the Yuwen family was seemingly mighty, compared to the bigger context, it was indeed not that influential. It would have something to do with their aggressive and reckless ways of dealing with things. However, Yuwen Ye's special power, the enhanced defense, was indeed very effective. But unfortunately, he did not seem to be able to fully control this special power.</p><p>\"I wonder what kind of special power would Qingcheng have when she reaches the Sea of Souls Realm.\" Ye Chen was slightly excited.</p><p>\"Oh right, sister Yan, what is your special power?\" Guan Qin asked suddenly.</p><p>Yan Fengfeng said with a smile, \"You will see when we are in the Savage Ruin Ancient Place.\"</p><p>Demi beasts all had special powers, and the perfect demi demons had special powers. Hence, it would be certain that Yan Fengfeng as the Blue Phoenix would also have a special power. Moreover, hers would not be weaker than the ones a demi demon would have.</p><p>Days passed by…</p><p>On the fourth morning, the five finally arrived at the edge of the Savage Ruin Ancient Place. Looked into the distance, the whole land was dusty and gloomy, as if there was a huge blockage separating the whole place.</p><p>\"The protective layer of the whole ancient place has weaker and more powerful spots. We will have to work on a rather weaker section.\" Yan Fengfeng waved the flying ship to move forward. Suddenly, a beam of blue flame burnt passionately from her eyes as she scanned the area.</p><p>Ye Chen pointed at the place ahead of him, \"There...That is the weakest spot.\"</p><p>\"Oh!\"</p><p>Hai Wuya and Yan Fengfeng glanced at Ye Chen with surprise. Even they could not find the spot in such a short period of time. It was indeed a powerful observation!</p><p>There was no time to waste. Under Yan Fengfeng's control, a massive cannon appeared in front of the ship. Rich fire element yuan qi started to accumulate in front of the shooting hole, and a dark red light ball was formed eventually.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The light ball was shot out directly, landing onto the weakest point of the protective layer.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>Without any surprises, the layer was shattered immediately, and a dozen-meters-wide tunnel appeared. Inside the tunnel, everything was dark red, which was obviously from the compressed fire element yuan qi's attack.</p><p>\"Let's go!\"</p><p>The flying ship increased its speed to rush into the tunnel.</p><p>\"The Heaven Earth Sword!\"</p><p>It was right then when a group of young men appeared nearby and the leading man used his finger as a sword. He pointed out his finger, and all of the natural yuan qi from the sky and the ground gathered in front of him, accumulating a massive sword shadow which flashed once before disappearing. In the next second, the blockage layer had been punctured through, leaving a massive hole behind.</p><p>Turning his head to see, Hai Wuya's pupils shrank, \"It is Tai Shichong!\"</p><p>Whoo!</p><p>After that, the flying ship entered the tunnel.</p><p>\"Tai Shichong is one of the young sword master warriors. I cannot believe that he is here as well. This guy is frighteningly powerful, as he can turn nature into a sword for him to use. Comparing attacking power, he would be right next to the top young warriors. Even Duan Lengya, the ice spirit master warrior, had lost to him before, and is now seeking revenge.\"</p><p>Being able to be regarded as powerful by Hai Wuya would definitely not be someone normal. He did not get this emotional even while facing Lin Ku and Duan Lengya, since one had a similar power as him while the other could only cancel out his power with his elemental Zhen yuan. Other than that, there was nothing special.</p><p>\"Very powerful! If not for the most critical moment, do not have a conflict with him.\"</p><p>There were a lot of rare treasures inside the ancient place, some of which were worth a bloody battle. It was not that Yan Fengfeng was afraid of Tai Shichong; she was not even afraid of the top five young warriors. But, even though she was fast enough, the others were slow. If they ended up stuck in a life and death battle with Tai Shichong, someone from their side might actually be killed.</p><p>\"Yeah!\"</p><p>Ling Tianhao and Guan Qin both nodded. Tai Shichong was too famous; he was no weaker than Yan Fengfeng, and fighting with him would be out of their imagination.</p><p>Ye Chan glanced at Tai Shichong who was still outside the tunnel. The sword qi that leaked out of from his body had the feeling of being above the sky. It was the connection between one top sword artist with another. They would be either friends or enemies, and there would be no third options.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>The tunnel was long, and the flying ship soon disappeared in its depths.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
