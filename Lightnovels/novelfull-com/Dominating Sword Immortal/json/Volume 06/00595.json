I Will Kill You!</h1><p>\"Damn these crazy birds!\"</p><p>After just crossing the lava lake, the five in Moqi Lou's group had faced the intense attacks from a group of Fire Dragon Birds, which completely caught them off guard.</p><p>By the time they had moved past their attacks, another black lake had blocked their path, just as intense as ink. When the mad wind blew through, it did not bring up any pattern on it at all. A couple of white bone boats rested by the shore.</p><p>\"There is poison in the lake! Get on the boat!\" Moqi Lou had seen a wounded bird beast fall into the river and disappear completely.</p><p>…</p><p>By the time the five got on the boat, Ye Chen and the rest had already gotten to the center of the lake.</p><p>\"I did not expect that this poisonous lake would prepare the white bone boats for us…How thoughtful! Even these fire dragon birds would only stare at us but not dare to come down.\"</p><p>The five picked two boats; Yan Fengfeng, Ling Tianhao and Guan Qin were all on one boat while Ye Chen and Hai Wuya were on the other.</p><p>Ye Chen laughed, \"They were afraid of this poisonous water, since you would be devoured completely with only one drop of it. Therefore, they would not dare to get close to the river at all.\"</p><p>\"Why do I feel that these birds are talking about something?\" Hai Wuya glanced at the bird beasts in the air and frowned.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Just as he spoke, an extremely evil looking black crocodile jumped out of the black river surface near them. It was a Poison Dragon Crocodile which carried an extreme poison. Whoever was hit by it would have no cure on this land. But for some reasons, it did not attack the white bone boats.</p><p>\"Gold Resonant Radiance!\"</p><p>Ye Chen's reflexes surprised Hai Wuya again; the second the black crocodile jumped out of the water, a sword-shaped light beam had been shot out, and it was indeed from Ye Chen.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>The defense of the crocodile was not that high, actually being way lower than the other crocodile beasts. Hence, it was decapitated by one sword attack, and its tensed body fell down before that black river water devoured it.</p><p>Ye Chen had no time to let out a breath because more poisonous crocodile beasts were attacking toward them, shooting out black toxic fluid at them.</p><p>\"Raise!\"</p><p>Hai Wuya activated his Zhen yuan, wanting to lift up the white bone boat. But somehow, the boat acted like it had been pinned to the surface of the lake, and did not move even an inch. It was then that Hai Wuya realized why the crocodile beasts did not try to crash and hit the boat, because it would be pointless.</p><p>\"Endless All Power!\"</p><p>With the realization, Hai Wuya raised up his body into the air instead, throwing out palm attacks in different directions. They were so dense that they seemed to create walls around them, blocking out the poison.</p><p>Ye Chen did not relax either, as the sword-shaped light shot out along the surface of the river. When he was making his breakthrough to Mid Seas of Soul Realm, he had an enlightenment which allowed him to bring his gold profound to the next level, as well as his Gold Resonant Radiance Attack, which had reached one hundred and ten percent. It had changed from its original shape, transforming into a light wave. Ye Chen knew that it was because his sword attack level was really low while his gold profound was too high, and the two could not match. Of course, regardless of that, his Gold Resonant Radiance Attack's power had increased drastically.</p><p>Pooh! Pooh! Pooh! Pooh!</p><p>The beam of light flashed past, and countless crocodile beasts sank into the river.</p><p>On the other side, Yan Fengfeng used her blue phoenix fire to wrap around the white bone boat while using her hands to form blades and kill those beasts, making everything look extremely casual.</p><p>\"The main boss is here!\"</p><p>Without bringing up any patterns in the water, a massive column appeared in the lake along with a bubbling sound.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Within that sky-shooting black water column, a poisonous dragon shot out from below. It looked like a flood dragon as well as a crocodile, as it had a long body while rows of spokes grew on its tail.</p><p>Pap!</p><p>The air was sucked out of the area as this crocodile beast waved its tail at the boat Ye Chen was in.</p><p>\"Piss off!\"</p><p>Hai Wuya was a big fan of battling head-on. He flipped his right hand before pressing it upwards. That palm power was thick like ocean waves, rushing about endlessly.</p><p>Boom! The tail of the leading crocodile beast clashed with Hai Wuya's palm.</p><p>\"Break!\"</p><p>At this moment, Ye Chen seized this opportunity before it slipped away, pointing out his finger toward one eye of the leader and eventually tearing them apart.</p><p>Awhooogooowoogoo!</p><p>The leader beast was so angry that he could feel the fire burning in its chest. Its back legs that were closest to Ye Chen were lifted up, the shiny claws flashing with a cold light before attacking.</p><p>With two swords crossed in front him, Ye Chen blocked out the beast's attack before throwing back a thunder ball.</p><p>\"Phoenix Peak!\"</p><p>Yan Fengfeng's right hand turned into a blue jade phoenix claw which closed up together, shooting out a beam of fire and puncturing through another eye of the leader beast.</p><p>The beast without its two eyes could no longer use its power against his opponents. Hence, it jumped back into the river and disappeared in the black waters.</p><p>After crossing the black river, the five finally got to the shore.</p><p>What the faced here was a gray colored, intense wind. Ye Chen threw out a top rank weapon amidst the gray crystal-like strings, which was destroyed immediately. Luckily, it was not shattered completely.</p><p>\"There are not much of these gray crystal strings. If you all be careful, you should be fine.\"</p><p>The five exchanged a look before jumping into the crazy winds.</p><p>Inside the black river…</p><p>\"I did not expect this round would be easier than that lava river. There are only a couple of crocodile beasts with a weak defense.\" Moqi Lou and his people thought that there would be great danger here, so they were very tense during the whole trip. But unexpectedly, the trip went safe and sound.</p><p>Reaching the shore, the five observed for a while before jumping within as well.</p><p>…</p><p>\"Be careful! There are wind spirits here!\"</p><p>It was just then when countless wind blade attacked toward Yan Fengfeng, which were dodged by her at an extreme speed. Within the crazy winds, human shadows similar to the mad winds' color appeared vaguely and unpredictably.</p><p>\"This sword intent…has the destruction attribute?\" Yan Fengfeng and the other three looked at Ye Chen shockingly.</p><p>Ye Chen would be the archenemy of these naturally-formed life forms. Rank 4 peak level destruction sword intent would be almost equivalent to peak level rank 5 normal sword intent. Added with its special destruction attribute, it would be a piece of cake for him to kill these wind spirits, no matter how many of them came at him.</p><p>Hence, the five continued to move forward and soon made it through the mad wind zone.</p><p>Gasp!</p><p>They gasped almost at the same time—in their sight was a massive bone skeleton which had a very odd shape, almost like a massive snake. The massive head was lifted slightly, and there were two pointy deer horns on top. A wave of shapeless pressure leaked out from within it, which was so powerful that it made breathing hard for the five.</p><p>\"These are dragon's bones!\" Yan Fengfeng mumbled.</p><p>'This pressure! It must be the real dragon pressure, right? It is even more powerful than the ice flood dragon's pressure! Even the activation of my Zhen yuan is restricted.' Ye Chen tried his best to push his Zhen yuan, the dragon power within him running madly and canceling the dragon pressure.</p><p>\"A dead dragon could give out this powerful a pressure. I wonder how powerful it was when it was alive! It must be terrifying!\"</p><p>\"Look! There are dragon blood plants…At least ten of them!\" Guan Qin's breath hastened on seeing the sight</p><p>Dragon Blood Plants, the top of the top plants, only appeared where dragon blood existed. After purifying, they could be converted into a strand of dragon power and increase one's physical strength. Upon using dozens of dragon blood plants at once, the dragon power enhanced would be impressive, allowing one to have body cultivating warrior's power.</p><p>\"Perhaps, these dragon bones would contain dragon bone jade narrow as well. After cultivating that, it could improve the physical strength even more. It would also form a light protective layer, augmenting one's defenses.\"</p><p>Talking about value, this dragon bone jade narrow would be way more valuable than the plant.</p><p>\"It would be hard to move forward in front of this dragon pressure.\"</p><p>The dignity of the dragon should not be underestimated, and the will power of the dragon was even harder to predict. After the dragon died, although its body became more and more fragile, the dragon pressure would not weaken at all; it would be the proof of its former glory.</p><p>\"Haha! Indeed, there is dragon bone narrow! And so many dragon blood plants! So what if we burned out five top rank great items. Even with one or two dragon blood plants, it would be completely worth it.\"</p><p>At that moment, five people appeared before the mad wind; the leading Moqi Lou and Ao Dubai looked shocked. They could not help but start laughing. Meanwhile, the three behind them stopped breathing, their faces filled with greed.</p><p>\"Yan Fengfeng, do me a favour and leave. Then, I will own you one.\" He was scared of Yan Fengfeng the most, so he pleaded.</p><p>She turned her head, \"What is that favour worth? I do not need it.\"</p><p>Ao Wubai walked one step forward, \"Added with me too? How about that? Are you gonna mess with the Heaven Dragon race and the Blue Eye White Wolf Race at the same time? I believe you will make the right decision.\"</p><p>\"What? Just with those words you think you can make us leave? Do you think we are that stupid?\" Hai Wuya said sarcastically.</p><p>\"Hai Wuya, I will remember this. After we get out, I will beat you to death.\" Ao Wubai's pupils were like wolves, looking extremely dangerous.</p><p>\"Kill me?\" Hai Wuya laughed.</p><p>\"Brother Hai, no need to bullsh*t with him. This place would be the best place to bury them.\" Ye Chen had not had the chance to try out his new power yet after making a breakthrough. He really wanted to know if his peak power could kill such semi beast martial geniuses.</p><p>\"Yes, bury them!\" Hai Wuya's eyes showed his killing intent.</p><p>\"Brat, I have never met you, but with these words of yours, there will have no place for you to live anymore. Even Yan Fengfeng cannot save you either. Right now, if you come and take your death, then I will leave your body in one piece for your family.\"</p><p>A blue eyed white wolf shadow appeared behind Ao Wubai's body, its massive wolf tail moving behind threateningly.</p><p>\"With just you?\" Ye Chen turned around to look at him.</p><p>Ao Wubai forced a laugh, \"Which martial art family do you come from? Do you dare to name it out? I will kill all of your people within three months. And I, Ao Wubai, will do what I say. But unfortunately, you will never see that day come, because you will die today.\"</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>Ao Wubao stepped onto the ground before attacking Ye Chen with one fist attack. Behind him, the wolf shadow grew sky high, increasing his power.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
