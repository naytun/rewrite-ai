It contained an endless slaughter qi, under the shower of which, the extreme Yin qi inside the cave was washed off immediately. That young man's body shook as he felt that he was undergoing countless blade and sword attacks; no words could describe that pain he felt. But, compared to the physical pain, the temporary recovery of his consciousness had given him a slight hope in desperation.</p><p>'Ah!'</p><p>Sensing the extreme threat, the shadow behind the young man screamed at Ye Chen. Although that scream did not have any attacking power, it could crawl right into one's soul. The young couple was not prepared for this, so their minds started to slip.</p><p>\"Piss off!\"</p><p>Ye Chen's eyes shot out the silver light again while his slaughter sword intent rushed out, its power reaching the next level and landing on the blurry human shadow.</p><p>Pop!</p><p>Ye Chen's slaughter sword intent was extremely horrifying. If it were not for the fact that he was worried the young man could not handle it, he could have used it all. But, the attack he threw out should be enough to shatter the blurry human shadow. Although the human shadow was not shattered completely in reality, it was indeed blown out of the young man's body.</p><p>Once it left the young man's body, it could no longer be spotted anymore. Even if it were Ye Chen, he could not sense it either unless he opened his Soul eye. But, it would burn too much soul power of his if he used it twice in such a short period of time.</p><p>Pap!</p><p>As the human shadow disappeared, the young man fell onto the ground.</p><p>\"Zuo Qiu!\" The young woman hurried to his side.</p><p>\"I am alright now.\" His voice was weak, his body cold.</p><p>\"I will help you up.\" As she held the boy up, she looked over at Ye Chen. Before, she thought he was just a normal Seas of Souls Realm warrior who was not even as powerful as herself. But now, she had changed her opinion completely. She knew that his sword intent was unbelievably horrifying, as even that evil being could not fight it at all.</p><p>\"You have saved Zuo Qiu's life, which means you have saved my life as well. Therefore, from now on, I, Li Qingxiang owe you one life.\" The young woman said emotionally.</p><p>Ye Chen did not care for what she said to be honest; what he minded more was her name as he asked, \"You are Zuo Qiu and Li Qingxiang from the southern regions?\"</p><p>\"Indeed. And you are…?\" The young woman and man both lifted up their heads.</p><p>Ye Chen chuckled, \"Perhaps you guys don't know me. I am Ye Chen.\"</p><p>\"Ye Chen?\" Li Qingxiang froze a bit, then she chuckled as well, \"Of course we do! How could we not? You are the host of the last tea gathering. Zuo Qiu was also one of the previous hosts. We have been watching the tea gatherings ever since.\"</p><p>\"Since we both are from the southern regions, there is no use in saying thank you and owing lives. Being out here, I will help you when I can for sure. If it were you two, I think you would do so as well.\"</p><p>Zou Qiu swallowed a qi replenishing pellet, then slowly straightened his body with the help of Li Qingxiang and said, \"I could not have expected that the person saving my life would be you, who has the biggest reputation in the southern regions. I guess this must be the so-called destiny. Oh right! Where is that thing?\"</p><p>Ye Chen looked around and said, \"It had been wounded quite badly, so it must have left.\"</p><p>The slaughter sword intent was very powerful in killing shapeless and shadowless evil beings. Even if it were powerful beings that were at the same cultivation, they would not be able to handle it at a close-range, since the sword intent could ignore the physical defense and make an impact on the opponent's mind directly. But normally, they would not be that stupid to just wait for the incoming attacks; they would also let out their martial intent to cancel out the sword intent.</p><p>Zuo Qiu was still afraid of what had happened to him before. \"This is a messed-up place. Regardless of how powerful your cultivation is, you have to have a powerful martial intent. Qingxiang and I are both not that weak in terms of that power, but we somehow could still do nothing to that thing. After a while, it managed to find its way into our minds.\"</p><p>Ye Chen nodded; it was indeed not a nice place. He could vaguely sense some horrible thing deep into the ground, which was like the source of hell.</p><p>\"This place is not suitable for staying too long. Let's go out together!\" Li Qingxiang suggested.</p><p>Ye Chen said, \"I still have something to do. You go out first. Don't worry. That thing has already been hit by my slaughter sword intent, so it does not have the power to do anything to you anymore.\"</p><p>\"Alright, you be careful!\"</p><p>They did not want to spend another second in this place; it was too depressing for them. If it were not for Ye Chen, they could not imagine what would have happened.</p><p>The two left the cave, shooting out the way they came in. Soon, they disappeared from his detection.</p><p>\"Shadowless Demon…?\" Ye Chen mumbled to himself.</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the Unsought Truth Pavilion, there was a transporting stone door on the first floor.</p><p>Whoo!</p><p>A swirl pattern appeared within the door, and a man in black robes appeared.</p><p>\"This little brat runs so fast. He had even made it into the Sky Martial Region!\" It was indeed Evil Demon Master in the black robes. He had first arrived in the pavilion to ask about Ye Chen, where he found out that the latter had come to the Sky Martial Region. He then went through the transporting door to the pavilion inside the East Royal City. Of course, it cost him a great fortune, which was almost half of what he had got. If it were not for the fact that he wanted to get the undying art manual so bad, he would not have been this wasteful.</p><p>\"I would like to know about a person.\"</p><p>Walking out of the side pavilion, the Evil Demon Master said to the pretty but cold-looking woman.</p><p>\"What cultivation? If it is below Sea of Souls Realm, I think you should leave.\" The pavilion did not know everything about everything. Only the valuable ones would be worth for them to search about. Warriors under the Sea of Souls Realm would not be worth it. If it were individual news, then it would be something else. But of course, people below Astral Reaching Realm would still not be worth the effort.</p><p>\"Sea of Souls Realm.\" As he said that, he swore in his mind. When he found out that Ye Chen had reached Sea of Souls Realm, he was shocked and furious.</p><p>\"Sixth floor!\" She said.</p><p>Hearing her, he walked directly to the staircase—it was not his first time looking for people through the pavilion, so he knew his ways quite well there.</p><p>Inside Room No.1 on the sixth floor…</p><p>\"What a coincidence! The person you are looking for was here in the pavilion. And because he is a client of our pavilion, you will have to pay double the price, which would be one hundred thousand top rank soul stones.\" The elder said without an expression.</p><p>Hearing him, the Evil Demon Master bit on his teeth, \"Alright! I will take it!\"</p><p>His heart was bleeding. He had already spent most of his fortune in the pavilion inside thunder city, and he was about to spend another huge part of his fortune in the East Royal City one. Right now, his belongings would not be comparable to even normal Sea of Souls Realm warriors.</p><p>\"Inside an underground crack fifty-five hundred thousand miles north-west to the East Royal City.\" The elder said slowly.</p><p>…</p><p>There were countless massive mountains within the region.</p><p>Shoo! Shoo!</p><p>Two human shadows shoot out of a huge mountain and into the distance.</p><p>\"Mr. Ping!\"</p><p>In the not-far mountain peak, a group of people were standing there calmly. One person from the group saw the two flying in the sky, so he reminded the tall leading teenager.</p><p>The latter looked over and said: \"Let's go and see.\"</p><p>\"Yes!\"</p><p>The group then flew out.</p><p>Inside the huge mountain, near the crack…</p><p>\"Haha, finally found it! Let's go!\"</p><p>A joyous expression flashed past Gu Ping's face, and then, his body disappeared within the black qi. The rest of them did not hesitate either, following right behind him.</p><p>\"Shadowless Demon! Although you are a nightmare to most of the people, but to me, you are a great way of boosting my power. No one knows it, but I have found a Shadowless Demon training secret martial art from some ruins. Through that, I can train my Shadowless Demon to Shadowless Puppet, which would allow me to get anyone's body as I desire. If I get enough of them, there would be more soldiers willing to die for me. Hehe!\"</p><p>Flying ahead, an evil expression flashed across his face.</p><p>\"Mr. Ping, I have sensed the Soul tracker down there!\" Right then, a person said with joy.</p><p>Hearing him, his expression changed, \"Great things happen one after another indeed! Let's follow up! Remember! Do not scare him away! Just keep your distance.\"</p><p>If Ye Chen ran into the Shadowless Demon and they were both wounded by each other, then his rate of succeeding in his plan would grow again, and perhaps he would even manage to get an undead puppet soldier for himself.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>A group of people heard the sound of running water and came to the river, searching around the area.</p><p>No one knew where the water was running to. Looking toward the direction where the water flowed, the ground seemed to get lower and lower, and the water ran faster and faster. In the end, it formed into countless waterfalls, looking like a huge staircase. Eventually, it turned into a vertical crack.</p><p>This was an extremely horrifying place. It was pitch black, and even soul power could not spread out in here.</p><p>Chin!</p><p>There was a sound of chains rubbing together, sounding like the arrival of death himself.</p><p>\"Yeah, my demonic will formation is damaged. Quite a powerful sword intent that can even reach peak level rank 5. Not bad! He is powerful enough to become one of my puppet soldiers.\"</p><p>\"Jiejie…They thought this was the Shadowless Demon. Unfortunately, it was one with an owner, formed by my Demonic will. Wounding one of them could not hurt me at all. I can make more of those at any time.\"</p><p>In the deep end of the darkness, a horrifying rumble was heard.</p><p>\"Go!\"</p><p>A vague vibration appeared and endless Yin wind shot out. If the naked eyes could see it, they could know that it was just like that blurry human shadow, but in an unbelievable quantity. Each second, ten of them would shoot out.</p><p>They jumped into the river and swam up. Wherever they went, the extreme Yin qi spread out, making the water flow seem to be frozen. Midway, the blurry human shadows went through a lake which was shining with green light dots.</p><p>…</p><p>\"The underground crack is too huge. I'll swim up along the water. I should thus be able to find the lake.\"</p><p>Beyond the cave, Ye Chen walked toward the deeper end where the river was flowing. Meanwhile, below him, endless human shadows rushed out toward him. According to the speed of both the parties, they would be able to run into each other within half an hour. Without him noticing, Ye Chen was actually walking into a trap where there were enemies in the front and back.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
