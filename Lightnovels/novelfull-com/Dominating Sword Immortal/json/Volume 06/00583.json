Ye Chen and the rest had also seen the warrior who was fighting the insects as well.</p><p>It was not just one, but five powerful warriors. The strongest two of them were Sea of Souls Realm master level warriors, one would shoot out assassinating weapons while the other had poisonous palm power which killed off waves after waves of locusts.</p><p>\"It is Li Shi from the Dark Shadow Martial School and Zhang Zhongdao from Five Poison School.\" Yan Fengfeng had recognized the two.</p><p>Hai Wuya said, \"Move above them…Do not make contact with them.\"</p><p>After entering the ancient place, one could trust no one besides oneself. Even if it were one's allies, one should still watch out.</p><p>The ship started to move up under the control of Yan Fengfeng as countless locusts were killed along the way. Their black blood would have splashed onto them if not for the protective layers, which would be horrifying and disgusting.</p><p>\"Brother Zhang, there is a puppet ship moving above us!\" The situation with Li Shi was not good. One on one or one against a group would be fine for him. But, one against one billion would be a bit out of his league. On a casual glance, he had seen Yan Fengfeng's flying ship, and his eyes brightened.</p><p>Zhao Zhongdao had also seen it, so he said creepily, \"Let's follow behind them and ask them to take us away. If there is an opportunity, then we will try to steal the puppet ship!\"</p><p>Facing this massive disaster, it was too important to have a ship like this, since the protective layer could save a lot of Zhen yuan for them. If there was an extreme danger, then the layer could cancel out some of it as well, serving as the second layer of defense.</p><p>\"Get their ship!\"</p><p>The other three were not as powerful as Li Shi and Zhang Zhongdao, so they looked like they were in a critical situation. If continued, the chances of them being killed would be very high; therefore, they were more than desperate.</p><p>Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!</p><p>The five pushed their Zhen yuan, trying their best to catch up with the flying ship.</p><p>\"They are catching up with us!\" Guan Qin and Ling Tianhao's expressions changed.</p><p>\"It is fate that led us to meet you. Could you please give us a ride? We could block out some locusts for you in exchange.\" Li Shi's Zhen yuan message came through.</p><p>Yan Fengfeng said lightly, \"Apologies! There are no spare spots on the ship.\"</p><p>Her rejection could not be clearer.</p><p>\"You should reconsider it.\" Zhang Zhongdao did not sound friendly.</p><p>\"I've said no, and it means no!\" Hai Wuya did not try to be polite at all.</p><p>\"Huh! If we are having a sh*t time, then you do not get to be easy as well! Right now, it is too late for you to change your mind. Attack!\" Zhang Zhongdao's expression went cold as he was the first to attack.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Although the five were within the locust groups, the insects could not break through their protective layers yet. With their defense layers, they changed at their targets, attacking the flying ship with their full power. Their powerful Zhen yuan vibration brought an intense turbulence to the ship.</p><p>\"These b*stards!\"</p><p>The five on the ship could sense the impact under their feet as they struggled to maintain their balance.</p><p>\"Fight back! We will see who can last until the end!\" Ling Tianhao held his purple gold hammer and attacked toward the end of the boat, the bright hammer light seeming like a shooting star.</p><p>Yan Fengfeng did not stop him and said to Guan Qin, \"You two, go to the end of the boat. Us three will hold down the fort here. Also, I will operate a cannon to help you two.\"</p><p>Although two of them plus a cannon could not compare with the five that were attacking them, there were still countless locusts in between them that should not be forgotten. Those insects could cancel out their attacks, so they would only be able to release twenty to thirty percent of their original power.</p><p>\"We will finish this mission!\"</p><p>It was Guan Qin's first time encountering this kind of situation, so she seemed slightly scared but more excited.</p><p>Just like that, there were countless locusts on the right side and five powerful warriors who did not seem to give up easily behind them. Ye Chen and the other four did not even have the time to take a breath. They knew it clearly that with the slightest carelessness, the consequences would be too severe to handle, so they could not let it happen.</p><p>After a long while, the ship shook once out of the blue. The protective layer's color seemed to dim down.</p><p>\"Not good! The spirit stones are about to run out! I need to fill it up.\" Yan Fengfeng's expression changed. The ship required three thousand, six hundred and fifty top rank spirit stones in each load. But, even if it looked like a lot, they could also last for quite a long time. However, during the past short while, there had been at least one hundred something cannon shots released. With each attack costing dozens of top rank spirit stones, this kind of spending would not last forever.</p><p>\"I will go fill it up for you.\"</p><p>Ye Chen took out a sword art puppet and gave him a huge box of top rank spirit stones to take to the bottom of the boat. With his power of multitasking, he was more than capable of controlling the puppet to load the top rank spirit stones while attacking the insects.</p><p>\"Sword art puppet!\" Yan Fengfeng cried out loud. \"Then, I will trouble you for that.\"</p><p>Yan Fengfeng knew that she could not go there herself, since the ship would be broken through with one man less on the defense, as the balance would be broken.</p><p>With the sword art puppet loading the top rank spirit stones, the protective layer was stabilized again, and everyone on the ship let out a breath.</p><p>\"I have said it before…you will regret your decision! Five Poison Major Palm Print!\"</p><p>Zhang Zhongdao saw that it had been a long time and they had still not made any progress, so a cold, cruel expression flashed across his face. He did not mind the insects chewing on his protective layer as he formed a spell with both of his hands, abstracting the poison yuan qi around him. After two blinks, he pressed out his right hand which had five different colors on his five fingers, representing five different poisons.</p><p>Pooh! Pooh! Pooh! Pooh! Pooh!</p><p>The attack was extremely poisonous—all of the locusts started to fall down, clearing out a huge area of space. A palm with powerful Zhen yuan and a colorful shine landed on the flying ship and made a huge noise. The colorful poisonous qi seemed to cover up the whole sky.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>The protective layer started to be devoured at a visible speed, about to be broken through at any second.</p><p>\"I would like to see what you, Zhang Zhongdao, exactly have up your sleeves!\"</p><p>The poisonous qi was not only devouring the defensive layer, but also blocked away the locusts from attacking the ship. So, Yan Fengfeng was free to move to the end of the ship.</p><p>\"Phoenix Fire! Natural Burn!\"</p><p>Whooo!</p><p>The blue flame burned at a fast speed as it rushed out, turning into a flame Phoenix wherever it flew and turning everything into nothingness, including the colorful poisonous qi. The young man right next to Zhang Zhongdao, who was careless and got scratched by the flame, had his protective layer broken through at the same time, which led him into the welcoming arms of the endless locusts. Even his cry eventually got drowned in the humming sound.</p><p>Zhang Zhongdao himself was not having a good time either. All this while, he had thought that Yan Fengfeng was only famous for her horrifying speed; but now he knew that he was wrong. Her power was no weaker than her speed; it was only that her speed was just too incomprehensively fast, which led people to forget about her strength.</p><p>\"Stormy Rain!\"</p><p>Li Shi saw that Yan Fengfeng had gotten the upper hand completely, so he hurried to reach out and help. Endless Zhen yuan weapons were shot out like raindrops in a stormy day. The air slicing sound continued to be heard. In the center was hidden a tiny sword that was actually not formed of Zhen yuan; instead, it was actually a top rank assassinating sword.</p><p>\"Gold Resonant Radiance Attack!\"</p><p>Ye Chen took out the gold sword, using it to flick away that tiny sword.</p><p>\"Endless Puncture!\"</p><p>Hai Wuya attacked as well right after Ye Chen's attack, his palm attack blowing away all of the incoming attacks and looking rather horrifying.</p><p>Under the joint forces of the three, Zhang Zhongdao and the other two could not handle it anymore. Hence, they did not have any other choice but to increase the distance between them and the ship and give up on chasing them.</p><p>\"I will remember this!\" Zhang Zhongdao's voice was heard.</p><p>\"You think I am afraid of you?\" Hai Wuya had no fear.</p><p>The poisonous qi disappeared, so the locusts attacked again. Ye Chen and the other four did not dare to slow down, going back to the right side of the boat and trying to block out the insects' attack.</p><p>\"It's getting less!\"</p><p>Gradually, everyone realized that the insects were getting less and less; it was now possible to see some light through the gaps.</p><p>\"Full power escape!\"</p><p>Yan Fengfeng changed her attacking direction, aiming right at the front.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>As the exploding sound was heard, the ship shot out through that dark cloud of insects, and could finally see the sun again.</p><p>\"Lucky that we had the ship. If we are on our own, even if we did not die amongst those b*stards, we would have to burn a lot of our Zhen yuan.\" Hai Wuya laughed.</p><p>Ye Chen turned his head to see endless insects coming at him, seeming to be everywhere. Wherever they went, the mountains started to fall down, the ground started to crack open; even the rivers started to dry up and all the beasts within were devoured completely.</p><p>'This Savage Ruin Ancient Place is indeed like its reputation.' Ye Chen thought to himself.</p><p>…</p><p>After the flying ship got away, another fifteen minutes went by when three human figures made it out of the endless insect groups. It was indeed Zhang Zhongdao and the other two.</p><p>\"Damn, I, Zhang Zhongdao, had never experienced this kind of humiliation before.\" Zhang Zhongdao was the head disciple of the Five Poison Cult. Back in the days, the leader of the one hundred and eight ghost warriors of the Nine Ghost Cult was also from the school. It was just that he had been kicked out of the school, which was different. The school was famous for its poison, and everyone within was an evil being. They would definitely take revenge for themselves for even the smallest grievances, and what Yan Fengfeng had done had definitely pissed him off.</p><p>Li Shi said, \"They have the puppet ship. If we run into them again, I don't think we will win for sure.\"</p><p>\"There will be more opportunities.\" Zhang Zhongdao's eyes squeezed together.</p><p>\"You and I have been wounded badly. Let's find a place first to replenish our Zhen yuan.\" Li Shi suggested.</p><p>\"Yeah!\" Zhang Zhongdao nodded, leading the other two into the distance. There were five of them when they came, but now, there were only three of them left. It was a bit sad in some aspects.</p><p>…</p><p>\"This is a mountain with a spirit fountain.\"</p><p>Late in the evening, the group arrived right in front of a mountain full of spirit qi. On top of the mountain were beams of extremely colorful spirit qi and plants. Some of the spirit qi got to where the plants were, with a vague hint of beast power hidden within. They were obviously the guardian beasts.</p><p>\"Everyone, go pick up some medicines. Try not to get out of my range of detection.\" Putting away her flying ship, Yan Fengfeng said.</p><p>Ye Chen responded, \"I need some medicinal plants, so I hope everyone would spare a minute to look out for me as well.\" Ye Chen named out some of the lacking ingredients for the antidote of the Shadowless Poison.</p><p>\"No problem, these have no effect on us anyway.\" Hai Wuya nodded brightly.</p><p>\"Let's separate now then…Be careful! It's all that matters!</p><p>At the end note of his voice, everyone turned into beams of lights, disappearing into the horizon.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
