He shot out into the sky, 'standing' a hundred steps away from Du Gujue.</p><p>\"Du Gujue, you might not lose amongst the young generation, but today, you will lose right here! There is a big price to be paid for arrogance!\"</p><p>\"Perhaps I will lose, but you do not have the power to make me lose yet. Only people with a talent that reaches beyond me can defeat me, and you are not there yet.\"</p><p>Just like Ye Chen, Du Gujue had never lost amongst the young generation. Even Dantai Mingyue could only manage a draw with him. He had an unstoppable heart, and although his power was not unbeatable, his heart was already set that way.</p><p>\"The more confident you are, the harder I will make you fall.\" Tai Shichong's sharp eyes locked onto Du Gujue.</p><p>On the ground below them, hundreds and hundreds of powerful warriors could sense these two's battling power and killing qi everywhere around them. One of them was one of the top young sword masters who had been famous for a long time, only slightly weaker than the leading swordmaster; the other one was one of the top beasts in the Sky Martial Region. The latter had never lost a battle against the other young warriors from his generation. While he had endless talents, he was also a blade artist at his core.</p><p>It was right then that the battle between Tai Shichong and Du Gujue was about to start.</p><p>It would be a battle between a sword artist and a blade master.</p><p>All of the warriors watching were holding their breaths.</p><p>\"Although it had not been long for Du Gujue to enter the Seas of Souls Realm, he is an extremely powerful martial genius after all! No one could dare to say that he would lose for sure!\" Hai Wuya mumbled to himself as he glanced Ye Chen.</p><p>Ye Chen was also one of the extremely talented martial geniuses.</p><p>\"Who will win and who will lose would depend on their success in their sword or blade arts.\" Ye Chen could tell that Du Gujue was already at Mid Sea of Souls Realm, and he had probably encountered some other great opportunities in the past one year. Of course, it could also be resources from his family, since a rank 5 martial institution would have rare valuable resources available for a warrior they would like to train.</p><p>\"Du Gujue, take my attack first!\"</p><p>Tai Shichong did not draw out his sword; instead, he shot out toward Du Gujue as he put his middle and index fingers together and pointed at his opponent's forehead. It was the Nature Sword attack!</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>With that, a massive sword shadow reached out.</p><p>\"Tai Shochong, take out your sword!\"</p><p>Du Gujue took out his long blade and slashed it vertically across the sky in front of him. That bright white blade light shone onto everyone's heart.</p><p>A loud sound of explosion was heard and the whole space shook for a while as that blade light actually sliced through the sword shadow, attacking toward Tai Shichong with that Despairing extreme power. The latter hurried to take out his longsword and block with it in front of his chest.</p><p>Dang!</p><p>Following the impact, Tai Shichong flew out.</p><p>\"Whoo!\"</p><p>As he took a deep breath, Du Gujue's eyes turned even colder. It was not a cold similar to an icy mountain, but one that could freeze one's heart and mind.</p><p>He held his blade with both of his hands, his knuckles sticking out as he threw out another attack. That bright, white blade light had lighted up the whole sky. All of the people staring right in the direction of his sword could feel that depressive emotion pouring out of their heart.</p><p>\"Mountain Sword!\"</p><p>Du Gujue's power had indeed shocked Tai Shichong, so he performed his ace attack immediately. That mountain like sword shadow was like a giant barrier, sealing up the whole area.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>Du Gujue's blade light broke though Tai Shichong's sword shadow instantly.</p><p>\"How can he be this powerful? And also, this kind of despairing power!\" Right then, Tai Shichong had already treated Du Gujue as one of his top opponents; all he could think of in his mind right then was that he could not lose.</p><p>The will power of sword artists was extremely powerful. Soon, Tai Shichong was able to cut away the emotional thoughts in his brain and invest all of his attention purely into the battle. He let go of his reputation and fame; all he wanted now was to battle with Du Gujue. Without him noticing, his sword aura was getting richer and richer, his condition reaching beyond his peak.</p><p>\"This Du Gujue, how could he be this powerful! Even Tai Shichong could not harm him, and even seems to be in a disadvantageous position!\"</p><p>A lot of people widened their eyes. Meanwhile, Ye Chen frowned as if he was thinking about something.</p><p>Dang! Dang! Dang!</p><p>The whole sky was filled with the blade light and sword shadow from the two, their battle unrelenting like a tsunami.</p><p>\"Water sword—Major Heartless Wave!\"</p><p>After reaching into the sky, Tai Shichong held his sword with both of his hands and suddenly waved out. With that, the endless water-like sword power continued to rumble on without stopping.</p><p>\"The sea will dry out, the stones will eventually rot away…All you will face will be despair!\"</p><p>Du Gujue waved out another extremely bright white colored blade light; wherever it passed, the mountains and the stones cracked open, turning into dust. Even Tai Shichong's sword power ran out rather quickly, which decreased his attacking power drastically. His face was lighted up by the pale white light, carrying a hint of shocked expression on his face.</p><p>The blade light attacked out, and Tai Shichong puked out a mouthful of blood before being blown away.</p><p>\"Even Tai Shichong is not an opponent for Du Gujue…I think it is wrong for us to use our standard to measure those martial geniuses.\" Hai Wuya sighed.</p><p>A lot of people thought that Du Gujue and Dantai Mingyue had both reached the Sea of Souls Realm for only a year, and that they would need a couple of more years to stabilize it. But, Du Gujue had shown them that he could still surpass sword geniuses like Tai Shichong within a short one year. Using the normal standard to measure martial geniuses was indeed unreasonable, since they were martial geniuses for a reason, that they were able to do things normal people could not do.</p><p>Yan Fengfeng said, \"Du Gujue's blade arts seemed rather different.\"</p><p>\"Indeed! They seem to be able to affect people's minds.\" Hai Wuya agreed.</p><p>Ye Chen did not speak, his whole focus resting on Du Gujue.</p><p>\"Tai Shichong, you are too disappointing! I thought I could finally have a big epic fight! But, you did not even have the right to make me use all of my power.\" Du Gujue's cold voice was heard by Tai Shichong, making his eyes go red immediately. Tai Shichong stood on a broken mountain where the sword qi on his body shot up into the sky. His sword intent continued to increase all the way up to the peak level rank 4, which was only half a step away from the rank 5, before slowing stopping. Right then, his mental power had been completely infused into his sword aura, targeting right at Du Gujue from far away.</p><p>\"Alright! I could not have thought that you could make a breakthrough at moments like this…No wonder you could be listed among the top three sword masters.\" Du Gujue chuckled, which was quite a rare sight.</p><p>\"Du Gujue, the moment I made my breakthrough was the time for you to lose! Take that!\"</p><p>Using one kick attack to shatter a mountain, Tai Shichong waved out a sword attack in the air. That circular sword power was like waves of water, spreading out in the whole area. With his peak level rank 4 sword intent's enhancement, that attack was even more intense.</p><p>\"You making your breakthrough is a good thing for me. Only beating the powerful warriors has meaning for me…Otherwise, it would all just be pointless.\" Du Gujue waved his blade and welcomed that incoming attack. The sparks brought out by the clash between the blade and the sword spilled everywhere. The two fought from the east to the west; from the west to the north; then from the sky to the ground. They continued to fight against each other without stopping.</p><p>It was not hard to tell that the two were almost equally powerful, and even Du Gujue could not win instantly now.</p><p>\"I could not have thought that Tai Shichong would make his breakthrough!\" Down below, Du Gumin's eyebrows scrunched together.</p><p>\"Brother Min, don't worry! Your cousin does not seem to have lost in a condition like this before.\" The others standing right next to Du Gumin said.</p><p>\"Yeah, he will not lose.\" Du Gumin's eyes brightened again.</p><p>\"This blade intent?\" On the other side, Ye Chen started to have a basic idea of what was going on.</p><p>On the lake, Du Gujue and Tai Shichong's battle had messed up the lake water; some of the hidden beasts had been torn into pieces by their blade light and sword light.</p><p>\"Tai Shichong, you now have the power to make me use my best attack!\" Du Gujue's power was only slightly more powerful than Tai Shichong at this stage. Without using his ace attack, he would not be able to beat his opponent anymore.</p><p>Tai Shichong's eyebrows looked like swords as the rich sword intent blew up his clothes while the space blurred out.</p><p>\"Du Gujue, I will have to thank you for helping me make to the next level on my sword intent. The improvement of my sword intent had been tough for me for the longest time. But now, it has all been pushed through. Right now, I will let you taste your own fruit!\"</p><p>Tai Shichong groaned, his face going red as that incoming sword intent continued to scramble like it had a spirit of its own. Suddenly his body shot out before his wrist twisted. The longsword was like a mad dragon which created a loud sword clinging sound upon collision.</p><p>\"In front of my most powerful ace attack, all you will have is despair!\"</p><p>Du Gujue fought back without any more emotions. He held the blade with both of his hands, waving the sword on the ground and the lake that had been separated into half.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The two did not clash together, yet the lake water had already been flowing toward the side. Eventually, it crashed onto the banks, drowning most of the land. With that, a region of thousand meters deep mud was revealed.</p><p>\"River water crumble!\"</p><p>Tai Shichong's mad dragon-like longsword had changed drastically. It brought up a sky full of waves, flooding the whole land as that heartless sword power attacked all the way toward Du Gujue along with that lake water.</p><p>\"Despairing Sword Attack!\"</p><p>In the end, Du Gujue waved out his long blade as well. That pale white blade light turned into a white halo in the air, and all sorts of existences appeared on top of it while a desecrating expression appeared on his face.</p><p>\"Indeed, it is the despair attribute…the despair blade intent!\" That bright white light had indeed confirmed Ye Chen's thinking.</p><p>After waving out a sword attack, Tai Shichong was in his prime condition, but this blade attack of Du Gujue's had pushed him off that peak. His face was full of despair, and so was his heart. 'I am about to die! This blade will kill me! There will be no point in trying to block it…I will die anyway! Since there is no point then, why should I even try to block it?'</p><p>\"NO!\"</p><p>Tai Shichong screamed. He bit onto his tongue, and that longsword landed heavily onto that pale white blade light.</p><p>Chin!</p><p>In the next instant, the two went across each other. The whole sky of lake water poured down, which soaked Tai Shichong thoroughly.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>A huge amount of blood spilled out of Tai Shichong's chest. That blade attack of Du Gujue's had gone through that longsword and wounded him. Right at this moment, he could feel all of his organs twisted together.</p><p>\"This blade attack…Why did it make me so depressed? I am a sword artist, and my mind should not be affected by the outside world. Not to mention this kind of situation where my power is not weaker than him in any way!\" Tai Shichong was looking extremely pale. He was no longer his old self.</p><p>\"Being able to survive under my sword attack, you should already be proud of yourself.\" Blood dripped out of Du Gujue's mouth. That last sword attack from Tai Shichong had wounded him a little as well, but of course, he was not as wounded as his opponent.</p><p>Everyone who was watching did not talk for a long time.</p><p>Hai Wuya turned his head to look at Ye Chen, \"Brother Ye, that despair sword intent you mentioned before…what does it mean?\"</p><p>Ye Chen said, \"My sword intents contains the element of destruction, while his has despair. Naturally, I got the name of his intent. Combining with his own blade attack, his attacks would be able to confuse his opponent with their own despairing thoughts. A lot of people would be killed under that kind of situation.\"</p><p>The destruction element was not the same as despair. The latter was an emotion of the humankind, which would affect the opponent's mind directly; on the other hand, the destruction element could not so.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
