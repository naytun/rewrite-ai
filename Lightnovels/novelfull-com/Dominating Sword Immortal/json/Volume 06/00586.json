In the next second, that horrifying power followed his sword to pass onto his arms, and then all the way into his body. The sound of his bones cracking continuously was heard, and even his thunder disaster sword and gold sword had been blown away into the depths of the forest.</p><p>Pooh!</p><p>Ye Chen puked out a huge chunk of blood before flying back.</p><p>\"The power of this flood dragon must be greater than six hundred thousand pounds. Even if it were lower than the leader of that legendary martial school, it would not be that far off.\"</p><p>The surroundings were flying forward and looking all blurry as Ye Chen made a conclusion on the power that had been smashed onto him.</p><p>Awhooo!</p><p>The white flood dragon did not want to let Ye Chen go yet. Its massive body moved forward, showing vaguely behind the clouds. Within one-tenth of a second, it managed to catch up with Ye Chen, who was still flying backward. It opened its bloody mouth again, trying to bite the latter's head off.</p><p>\"It will not be that easy to kill me.\"</p><p>As he flew back, Ye Chen's body shook once like a shadow that moved through the jungle, which would be impossible to see clearly.</p><p>The white flood dragon could not find Ye Chen within a split second, so it shot out another wave of that freezing cold qi, freezing up the area dozen miles ahead. The flood dragon through that Ye Chen should be in this area, and if he was, then he would not be able to escape at all.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>At that moment, a beam of sword light sliced through the jungle, leaving an obvious mark in the air. The cold qi was almost catching up with the sword light, but it still failed eventually.</p><p>\"Although this ice cold qi is not that powerful after all, it is spreading just too fast.\" Few hundred meters away, Ye Chen stood in midair, his left calf frozen—it turned out that although the cold qi did not manage to catch up with him, a hint of it had managed to still make it onto his leg. Luckily, he had his undying body art, which would easily heal the minor wounds on his body.</p><p>\"Ye Chen, are you okay?\"</p><p>It was right then that a beam of blue flame appeared out of nowhere, its speed even slightly faster than the white flood dragon's. It was indeed Yan Fengfeng.</p><p>Ye Chen said, \"I am alright, but this white dragon's power is horrifying, along with its power and defense.\"</p><p>Yan Fengfeng looked over at that white flood dragon as she frowned, \"Although this flood dragon is just like me, at rank 9. but I would not be able to fight it in my human form. I might be able to have a chance only in battling mode.\"</p><p>She was referring to her phoenix true body.</p><p>During the time they were talking, Ye Chen had already called back his swords as he said, \"There is no point in fighting with it head-on. It would do no one any good.\" If he were able to run away, he would not have fought it at all.</p><p>\"Yeah! If I want to leave, it would not be able to catch up at all.\"</p><p>As she said it, she grabbed his shoulder and took him with her to fly into the distance. Her speed had increased to almost forty times the speed of sound, and it was the speed while carrying one extra human.</p><p>The flood dragon roared again, but it did not move. First of all, Yan Fengfeng's speed was way ahead of its speed limit; secondly, the qi on her body had threatened it slightly. It was the kind of connection only beasts at the same rank could feel. So, it was obvious to it that Yan Fengfeng was also a beast in her human form.</p><p>Soon, Hai Wuya and the rest showed up as well.</p><p>\"Ye Chen, you are very unlucky after all, running into a flood dragon which is the tyrant of them all.\"</p><p>When Hai Wuya sensed that Ye Chen was fighting against a flood dragon, he was frightened quite badly, since even he would lose to the flood dragon immediately.</p><p>\"Strange! Ye Chen, how are you not wounded at all?\" Ling Tianhao studied the other with a curious look on his face.</p><p>\"Yeah, I remember you puked out blood a couple of times in that kind of an intense battle, so how can you be fine?\" Hai Wuya had also noticed the strange thing about Ye Chen.</p><p>Ye Chen smiled, \"Perhaps the ice flood dragon had underestimated me and not used all of its power!\" Of course, he could not tell them that he had trained the undying body art.</p><p>\"Perhaps!\"</p><p>Hai Wuya gave Ye Chen a look; he could sense that the latter was hiding quite a lot, but he did not hate him for that, since everyone had their own secrets. The ones who did not were all dead by now.</p><p>Yan Fengfeng then said, \"Do not get close to the deep lake, and we can go to the other regions for plants. Just to be sure, do not get further than fifty miles from each other, so that we can keep each other safe in case of an emergency.\"</p><p>Frankly, Yan Fengfeng was very impressed with Ye Chen. It was such a short period of time and his power seemed to have grown again. He might be already just as powerful as Hai Wuya now, and his survival skills were just crazy; even the ice flood dragon could not kill him immediately.</p><p>\"Yeah, let's do that!\"</p><p>Everyone agreed and went on their separate ways, but kept a fifty miles distance in between each other.</p><p>…</p><p>At some point very far away, a bright red light column shot up into the sky. It was massive in size, and the energy wave it contained did not dissipate even after a long time.</p><p>\"Such a powerful energy pattern! It should be something precious! Let's go check it out!\"</p><p>There were a lot of people entering the ancient place, and after seeing the red light column, everyone rushed over while increasing their speed to the maximum.</p><p>\"Let's go as well!\"</p><p>Tai Shichong and his people were not that far away from the red light column, so they were able to feel the energy inside it even better.</p><p>Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!</p><p>All of a the sudden, dozens of human figures shot toward the column, creating a rather dramatic sight.</p><p>Near the red light column…</p><p>\"Damn, it has been about a month since we got here! Who would have thought that this Longevity Fruit would make this big a scene when it got ready for harvesting!\"</p><p>It was a small island inside the lake, and a group of people were standing in the dense forest on the island. In the middle of the forest was an area of flat ground with nothing but one massive tree. Quite a few red fruits were growing on top of the tree, and the red light column was indeed shooting from the tree.</p><p>What was weird was that this group of people were only staring at the tree without considering picking the fruit at all, as if they were waiting for them to get completely ripen, which was rather mysterious.</p><p>\"The Longevity Fruit is about to be done. We are the closest to the tree, so let's try to get more of them, \" they thought out loud optimistically.</p><p>\"That will have to be the case…I just want the fruits to grow faster.\"</p><p>After that, they stopped talking, just staring at the fruit and wanting for it to get redder and more mature. They could even feel that exciting energy pattern in their hearts.</p><p>\"Haha…We are quite lucky, being the first ones here. Let's go pick those fruits!\" An air-air-slicing sound was heard as a couple of human shadows flew toward that huge tree, fast as lightning.</p><p>The group of people hidden in the dense forest sneered, but did not try to stop them.</p><p>AHHHH!</p><p>Cries were heard all of a sudden as a couple beams of red light shot outward from the big tree, which easily went through these people's bodies. Soon, their bodies disappeared completely, leaving not even ashes behind even.</p><p>\"How great! I hope they do not even know that this is the Longevity Tree, then all of them will be killed, and no one will be fighting for the fruits with us.\" One of them said with a laugh on his face.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
