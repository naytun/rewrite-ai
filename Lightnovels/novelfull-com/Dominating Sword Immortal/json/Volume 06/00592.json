It was Yan Fengfeng and Tian Yinsou who went for the fifth fruit, while Tai Shichong and the middle-aged man went for the sixth. Since the seventh one was about to ripen as well, therefore, everyone else was still waiting.</p><p>\"It's coming down!\"</p><p>A wave of wind blew across, and the seventh fruit shook slowly before falling down onto the ground.</p><p>\"Brother Hai, I will help you on the side to get that fruit.\" Maintaining the same speed as Hai Wuya, Ye Chen passed a message through to him.</p><p>\"Alright!\"</p><p>The battle between Li Lei and Ye Chen let Hai Wuya known that the latter's power was already no weaker than his, and he was probably just slightly stronger. Ye Chen's speed and survival ability was something he needed the most right now. With the other's help, Hai Wuya knew that his chance of getting the fruit would be more than fifty percent.</p><p>\"Head disciple, we will help you too!\"</p><p>Guan Qin was confident about her speed, perhaps not her power. So she knew that once she got the fruit, she would be the target of everyone, and would not survive the attack. Since there were still quite a lot of the fruits on the tree, if her head brother got a lot of them, she might actually be able to have one as well.</p><p>\"Great! This fruit will be mine! I will also bring out all I have got! Earth Spinning!\" Hai Wuya spun his body, and the shockingly powerful water yuan qi accumulated toward him before starting to spin around him. It was a common fact that when an object moved intensely, it would bring up an intense qi field. While the water spun madly, its effect would create a chaotic world within one hundred meters of radius. Whoever and whatever entered this \"world\" would face a loss of balance.</p><p>\"This attack…is very powerful!\"</p><p>Ye Chen could sense the mad water yuan qi that filled up the area, clashing after each other and changing this area's magnetic field.</p><p>\"What's going on? How come I feel that the world is spinning?\"</p><p>The people with weaker power were shocked. Even if they were powerful Sea of Souls Realm warriors who could fly into the sky and dive into the deep waters, they still could do nothing about it while facing the sudden change of nature. For example, when the gravity changed, they could feel the discomfort immediately, since even they would still have to follow the rules of the nature. Hai Wuya managed to disturb the rules that they had to follow. Perhaps slight changes might not make a difference, and might still be tolerable when they got a bit severe; but when they became drastic, even the powerful warriors would not be able to adapt to them in such a short period of time.</p><p>\"The fruit! It's mine!\"</p><p>Everyone was making some level of mistakes while Hai Wuya got the fruit casually.</p><p>\"B*stard! So what if you could affect our balance. Can you affect the balance of the qi flow? Die!\"</p><p>All of a sudden, except for Ye Chen, Guan Qin and Ling Tianhao, all the others started to attack Hai Wuya.</p><p>\"Void Shattering Finger!\"</p><p>\"Mysterious Heaven Hammer!\"</p><p>\"Endless Destroy!\"</p><p>Ye Chen and the other two would not just watch Hai Wuya being attacked by everyone else, so they all performed their ace attacks, canceling out some of the incoming attacks.</p><p>At the same time, Hai Wuya would not let himself be wounded either. The second he got the fruit, he turned his body to throw out a powerful palm attack.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The qi flow exploded, and Hai Wuya was blown backward, looking all pale. Blood dripped down from the corner of his mouth.</p><p>These people still wanted to attack, when a beam of blue flame sliced through them like a phantom. The two people in the front were blown away while the others backed out for a couple of steps as well.</p><p>It was Yan Fengfeng!</p><p>After getting her second fruit, she hurried to get to Hai Wuya as well. Her speed allowed her to save him from a potentially life-threatening danger.</p><p>On the other side, Tai Shichong and the middle-aged man had also come to a conclusion of their struggle as well. It was naturally Tai Shichong who got the fruit finally. It was a fact that the bulky middle-aged man was slightly weaker in the area of trying to fight for things.</p><p>If those battles for the first seven fruits were intense, then the coming ones were just pure madness. Although there were still dozens of longevity fruits there, the tree would only let go of a certain amount, and might keep the rest of them, which had happened before.</p><p>With the cost of taking some minor wounds, the middle-aged man finally got the eighth fruit.</p><p>The ninth fruit belonged to Shi Taichong eventually. Added with this newly-gained one, he had already obtained three of them. He, who had spent all he had got, was indeed frighteningly powerful, such that even Yan Fengfeng would have to watch out for him. However, he was still not satisfied, as he wanted to fight for the Li brothers as well. After all, if they got more powerful, it would only be better for him.</p><p>It was Yan Fengfeng who got the tenth fruit.</p><p>In order to fight for this fruit, she changed back to her true form—a giant blue phoenix. Blue flames burned around her body as she waved her wings once. With that, the sky was then filled with blue flame, bringing dust onto Tian Yinsou and that middle-aged man's faces. Tai Shichong frowned a little, but he did not try to fight for it.</p><p>\"Brother Ling, you better wait for a while before trying to cultivate with the fruit, since it only has eighty percent chance of helping you break through to the Mid Sea of Souls Realm.\" Yan Fengfeng had already gotten two fruits, so she gave the third one to Ling Tianhao as she warned him.</p><p>The latter received the fruit joyously and said, \"Head sister, I know! Wait until I have one hundred percent of confidence, then I will use the fruit.\"</p><p>If he wasted the fruit, even he would not forgive himself, not to mention his sister disciple.</p><p>\"Head disciple…\"</p><p>Guan Qin stared at Hai Wuya with hope–she was the only one who still had not gotten a fruit yet out of the five.</p><p>Hai Wuya frowned, \"No rush…There will be more chances.\"</p><p>On the other side, Tian Yinsou started to think about leaving. He did not need the fruit to improve his cultivation, and it would be only used for augmenting his Zhen yuan storage. One fruit would save him a couple years worth of efforts. Of course, no one would say no to a longevity fruit, the more the merrier. But, he also knew that the three warriors present were more powerful than him. In addition, there were so many of them; if he continued this battle, he might not be able to make it out at all.</p><p>\"Haha, you continue battling then…I will excuse myself now!\"</p><p>The fact that Tian Yinsou was able to escape from the wanted list of rank 5 martial institutions for this long could prove his power. He was able to tell when to say no and not be blinded by his greed, which was impressive already.</p><p>\"This guy runs so fast.\" Yan Fengfeng made a face.</p><p>Not so far away, Tai Shichong squeezed his eyes—he was planning to steal Tian Yinsou's fruit after this whole thing finished. But, he left so fast, which was indeed a bit out of his expectation. As for Ye Chen, he did not plan to do anything to him yet, as there would be plenty of time in the future after reaching Late Sea of Souls Realm. Yan Fengfeng was indeed just as powerful as him after all. Speaking of which, after Li Lei was badly wounded, the general power over his side was actually weaker than Yan Fengfeng's side.</p><p>\"Cheeky old fox…It is indeed hard to make his life miserable!\"</p><p>The bulky middle-aged man did not know what Tian Yinsou was thinking, but he was genially impressed as well.</p><p>\"I will perform my Savage Race God Calling Major Spell soon and take over that eleventh fruit!\" The middle-aged man was very jealous of Tai Shichong and Yan Fengfeng. Amongst everyone here, the two had gotten the most fruits of them all while he had only gotten one.</p><p>When a Savage Person started to use his strength, it would be quite a horrifying sight. They seemed to be able to use some kind of secret art to augment their power—their giant-like body would be covered in black patterns, after which, the attacks from weapons would be canceled out by quite a bit.</p><p>Therefore, the eleventh fruit eventually landed in the hands of the middle-aged man.</p><p>The twelfth and the thirteenth fruits became Yan Fengfeng and Tai Shichong's, the former giving it to Guan Qin.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>After the thirteenth fruit landed onto the ground, the tree suddenly left the ground. The massive roots almost tore apart the whole island, drowning the rest of them. Meanwhile, the fruit was covered in a red light.</p><p>Shoo! It tore apart the air, flying toward the deep part of the ancient place. Soon, only one red dot could be seen, which later flashed a couple of times before disappearing completely.</p><p>Yan Fengfeng and Tai Shichong did not chase after it; even they would not dare to mess with the tree, since it had the power to kill them in a heartbeat.</p><p>\"Haha! This time, we have gained more than the two times before combined! All six of them!\" Hai Wuya laughed.</p><p>There were thirteen fruits in total on the tree, and they had obtained six of them while Tai Shichong got four of them. Two went to the bulky middle-aged man, and one to Tian Yinsou. But obviously, they had gotten most of them.</p><p>Ye Chen said, \"This kind of opportunity would not be happening that often.\"</p><p>\"Indeed! The red light column of the tree could only be seen within one thousand miles. The world out there would not even know that it was here at all. Otherwise, if there were more people fighting for the fruits, then we might not have been able to get many. It would already be good to have two or three at that time.\"</p><p>They were only one of the powerful groups on this island. There might be more powerful master level warriors here.</p><p>\"Yan Fengfeng, there were no winners in today's battles. I will see you next time.\" Tai Shichong did not plan to mess with Ye Chen for now, so he just said coldly.</p><p>Yan Fengfeng responded, \"I will wait for you.\"</p><p>\"Let's go!\"</p><p>Tai Shichong took Li Feng, who was still holding a grudge, to leave the area. Before they left, Li Feng glanced at Ye Chen once. There was a sharp beam of cold light shining out of his eyes, looking extremely evil.</p><p>By the time they left, only the middle-aged man and Yan Fengfeng's groups were left.</p><p>\"Let's go!\" The middle-aged man did not have beef with Ye Chen and the others, so they left as well.</p><p>\"Everyone, I would like to find a place to close-up and train. Could you guys give me one day worth of time?\" One day would be enough for him to break through to the next cultivation level, since it was not the profound sense that he was trying to comprehend. So, Ye Chen looked over at Yan Fengfeng and Hai Wuya while asking.</p><p>Yan Fengfeng said, \"Ye Chen, are you confident in doing so? This fruit is really hard to come across. If you waste it, then it is gone forever.\"</p><p>\"Yeah Ye Chen, this thing is not urgent…Think about it before doing it.\"</p><p>Ye Chen chuckled, \"I would not dare to say I have one hundred percent confidence, but ninety-nine percent is certain.\" He might not be the best in training speed, since that had something to do with the physical talent. But, in terms of cultivation improvement, not many people could compete with him since the advantage of his soul could allow him to think through anything easily. It was one of the reasons why he was able to break through to Sea of Souls Realm at the age of twenty-four. As for Zhen yuan accumulation, he might not be as good as the others, but he could use pellets or great items to make it up.</p><p>\"Alright! One day is not that long, so we will cover for you.\" As they spoke, the group flew toward the south-east.</p><p>…</p><p>It was an endless island, on which, Ye Chen was training inside a short, inconspicuous hill.</p><p>Outside the hill, Yan Fengfeng, Hai Wuya, and the rest were resting with their legs tucked under their bodies, recovering their Zhen yuan that had consumed in the battles before.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
