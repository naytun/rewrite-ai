When he got midair, that massive flying puppet flashed to appear below him. He landed comfortably onto the flying puppet which flapped its wings once before turning into a beam of light toward the north-west.</p><p>\"Yan Fengfeng would not just call us for no reason. It should be an exploration for the whole team.\"</p><p>After reaching the Sea of Souls Realm, all martial geniuses cherished their lives, since it was not easy to get this far. Even if they did not make any improvements, they would still at least not be someone other people could ignore. Therefore, martial geniuses would form into a group to increase their total power, which would allow them to minimize the danger level. Ever since the ancient times, it was neither the life and death battles that killed most of the martial geniuses, nor assassination; it was the exploration of foreign places. Since no one knew exactly how dangerous these forbidden places were or what would be inside, it would be impossible to stay completely safe.</p><p>\"It is actually good, since I have just increased my power again lately and the wolf's dreamscape power has reached the next level as well. Perhaps it would be good to explore out, since I might be able to find more ingredients for creating the antidote to the Shadowless Poison.\"</p><p>Ye Chen was quite interested in this exploration. Before, the ones he went to were alright for him to handle alone; but if Yan Fengfeng was willing to spend this amount of effort on this exploration, it would obviously not be a normal one, since her power was unpredictable even for Ye Chen.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>The flying puppet was flying faster and faster, and after a couple of blinks, it reached its highest speed.</p><p>Right now, one could see a high mountain with river water running below it. The horizon was endless, with everything easily visible. At the highest point of the mountain stood two human figures. It was indeed the head disciple of the Mysterious Martial School, Yan Fengfeng, who was now in blue robes and looking rather sharp. Right next to her was Ling Tianhao.</p><p>\"Head disciple, is this Ancient Savage Land really this dangerous?\" It had not been long for Ling Tianhao since he reached the Sea of Souls Realm. So, he was still not qualified to go to some of the places yet.</p><p>Yan Fengfeng said, \"Considering the chances of dying, this Ancient Savage Land is indeed not that dangerous compared to the other forbidden places, since it is big enough and would be impossible for the whole place to be equally dangerous. Yet, one should not go in carelessly. There are a lot of extremely dangerous spots where even Life and Death Realm king warriors have to be careful. Although I have an incomplete map, I still do not have one hundred percent confidence to go in and out safely.\"</p><p>Ling Tianhao nodded. He had only heard about it before, so he naturally would not be able to know what exactly she was talking about. He lifted up his head to look into the distance, \"The Sky Ocean Martial School is not that far from here, so Hai Wuya should be here soon. I just don't know when Ye Chen will be here. If he had gone back to the South Rudra Region, then won't we have to wait for a long time?\"</p><p>Yan Fengfeng said, \"That forbidden place is filled with Savage Evil qi, which would Affect the Zhen yuan circulation and mental condition. And right now is indeed the weakest month of the year, so if he does not come within three days, then we will leave.\"</p><p>It had been ten days after they notified Hai Wuya and Ye Chen. After another three days, it would be half a month. If Ye Chen was not that far away, then he would have had plenty of time to make it here.</p><p>The sun was burning hot in the sky, and even the air seemed to have been twisted. At that moment, two black dots in the distance were enlarging at an extreme speed.</p><p>\"Haha, sorry for the wait!\"</p><p>Hai Wuya's bald head shone an extra bright light under the sun.</p><p>Yan Fengfeng laughed, \"You are actually quite fast.\"</p><p>Shoo! Shoo!</p><p>It was a young lady who came with Hai Wuya, looking rather pretty. They flashed once before landing onto the peak of the mountain. Hai Wuya touched his bald head and said, \"I came the moment I got the notice. This is my sister disciple Guan Qin. As for the other ones, the master would not let them go.\"</p><p>Yan Fengfeng chuckled, \"What master would let all of his best disciples go into danger all at once? Some of them have to stay at the school after all.\"</p><p>There were four top Seas of Souls Realm warriors inside the Mysterious Martial School, and Yan Fengfneg had brought only Ling Tianhao.</p><p>\"You are quite right after all. You cannot keep all of the eggs in the same basket.\" Hai Wuya drank some water from the water bottle and asked, \"Where is Ye Chen? Did you call him too?\"</p><p>\"Yes, I did, but I don't know if he can make it.\" Yan Fengfeng really cared about Ye Chen since he was not weak, but actually really powerful, even more powerful than Ling Tianhao.</p><p>\"We should notify him. The place would be really dangerous, and one more warrior would mean more security. Plus, he was able to stand out in the southern regions, so he should have quite some tricks.\"</p><p>\"Head disciple, is he this powerful?\" Guan Qin looked at him with her big eyes, looking very young and naive.</p><p>Hai Wuya said, \"Of course! If not, how could he be ranked the third?\"</p><p>Once he went back to his school, he had told his teacher all about Ye Chen. Right now, everyone inside his school knew about the latter, so they were all quite curious.</p><p>Time went fast, and it was already on third day's noon.</p><p>\"After today, we will have to leave first thing in the morning. Why isn't Ye Chen here?\" Ling Tianhao was a bit anxious.</p><p>\"Perhaps he was too far awayâ€¦\" Hai Wuya frowned.</p><p>\"No rush! Although we will have to leave tomorrow, I can only maintain eight times the speed of sound with the Sky Ship. So, if he flies at full speed, he would still be able to make it.\" Yan Fengfeng said. The \"Sky Ship\" she mentioned was a puppet flying ship. After being loaded with top rank soul stones, it could reach eight times the speed of sound at max. Since the place they were heading to would be full of danger, it would be not wise to travel at full speed with Zhen yuan.</p><p>\"You are right.\"</p><p>They nodded.</p><p>The night soon arrived, the stars appearing in the sky.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>At that moment, a vague air slicing sound was heard from the distance as a huge, strange looking bird flew toward them. By the time the sound got there, the bird was already almost at the peak of the mountain.</p><p>\"Ye Chen, you are finally here! We thought that you would not make it this time.\"</p><p>Everyone was resting on the mountain, so they all stood up on his arrival.</p><p>Whoo! Whoo!</p><p>After putting away his flying puppet, he landed on the ground and said with a smile, \"Apologies for the wait everyone.\"</p><p>\"As long as you are here.\" Yan Fengfeng examined Ye Chen and realized that he seemed to have even thicker qi, which would normally mean that he had made another breakthrough.</p><p>Slowly letting out a breath, she reminded, \"Ye Chen, we are heading to the Ancient Savage Land this time, so be mentally prepared for it.\"</p><p>\"Oh!\"</p><p>Ye Chen had heard about it before. The place was more like a region instead of just a forbidden place, because its whole area was not that smaller than the whole of South Rudra Region. Moreover, it was rather different from the other regions, as it kept the style of the ancient era. But on the outer areas, the natural power had formed a protective layer which covered the whole area within and kept the evil qi restricted, which would normally have a huge power limiting effect on the warriors if spread everywhere. Normally, it would still be tolerable, but once one was wounded or not in their best shape, it would be really easy for the warriors to go down a twisted mental path and even go crazy.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
