If struck by this blade aura, even experts at the same level as him would suffer greatly and have their spirits jolted.</p><p>\"Hmph!\"</p><p>Ye Chen stepped out while a peerlessly sharp slaughter intent collided with the blade in the air, giving off muffled explosions and tearing the air.</p><p>\"Eh! This sword aura isn't integrated with the profound at all, but is an attributed sword aura.\" Lin Kui's face showed his surprise.</p><p>'Not losing in terms of aura against Withered Blade Lin Kui…' Hai Wuya and Yan Fengfeng exchanged glances, feeling they had underestimated Ye Chen.</p><p>\"You have quite some skill!\" Lin Kui sneered.</p><p>\"As do you...\" Ye Chen didn't fear the former's aura suppression at all. He was indeed not Lin Kui's opponent in terms of strength, but if the latter wished to suppress him by his aura, he would have to be dreaming. His peak rank 4 slaughter sword spirit was comparable to peak rank 5 sword spirit, which was a King's sword spirit. Of course, this comparison only took account of one aspect. A true Life and Death King's aura would far surpass Ye Chen's, because the former would be far more skilled in its application.</p><p>\"Ye Chen, do you dare to fight?!\"</p><p>Yuwen Jie was not astonished by Ye Chen's aura at all. He was already made aware by his clan members that the latter was highly accomplished in sword intents. Thus, his sword aura naturally wouldn't be any weak. After all, sword aura was much cruder compared to sword intent. Only purely explosive power could be used to suppress him.</p><p>\"If you want to fight, fight!\"</p><p>Ye Chen, of course, didn't fear battle, which was but a primal instinct.</p><p>\"Good! Ye Chen you have humiliated Yuwen Clan. Today, I will return it all one by one. Don't think it of me not giving face to you, as you have brought this on yourself.\" Yuwen Jie's aura suddenly erupted forth, thick and sturdy like a mountain. The surrounding people immediately retreated back to provide some fighting space.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Bending his knees, Yuwen Jie leaped up and fiercely chopped down the huge rapier from high above. His rapier didn't perform any fancy tricks and merely chopped down severely. Under its influence, a section of the soil on the ground caved in.</p><p>Unsheathing the gold sword, Ye Chen sucked in a deep breath and raised it up above. The sword and rapier touched and two energy beams collided, causing the color of sky to fluctuate rapidly. Muffled thunder explosions rang out unceasingly, and the two parted finally with a resounding thunderclap.</p><p>\"You will return all of it? You don't have the strength.\"</p><p>Amidst a golden sword radiance, Ye Chen charged while holding the gold sword with both his hands. The sword radiance seemed as if Ye Chen had dragged down a golden river of stars. It kept increasing and getting sharper before he resolutely chopped at the rapier in Yuwen Jie's hands.</p><p>Clank!</p><p>Intense sparks blossomed like flowers while Yuwen Jie let out a muffled groan. His feet left the ground and he was blasted several li away.</p><p>\"Damn it!\" Yuwen Jie's body stopped and his aura crazily rose.</p><p>\"You will return it? I'll make it so that you won't even dare.\" Ye Chen's sword aura was like a rainbow as he issued another strike.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>Just like that, Yuwen Jie was blasted away again.</p><p>The angered Ye Chen was terrifying. In the spiritual world, he had killed numerous spiritual entities. Although his strength hadn't increased evidently, his batting style had become much simpler and straightforward.</p><p>Ss!</p><p>Everybody hurriedly followed behind the two figures. Seeing Yuwen Jie being firmly suppressed by Ye Chen, they sucked in a breath of cold air. Ye Chen was indeed powerful, but in any case, he wasn't as powerful as Lin Kui, Hai Wuya, and Yan Fengfeng. What shocked them was his battling style. Yuwen Jie had only suffered a slight disadvantage, but ended up being continuously pushed back without any chance to retaliate.</p><p>The chase had gone past hundred li. All Yuwen Jie could do was defend—defend with his life. If he didn't defend, only defeat awaited him.</p><p>Even a mountain peak could be slowly scraped off, and Yuwen Jie's arms had slowly started bleeding.</p><p>\"Ye Chen, don't push it too far.\"</p><p>With a roar, Yuwen Jie spread out his hands before Ye Chen's sword aura. His back bent slightly, protruding out black scales. The moment these scales appeared, Yuwen Jie's upper body swelled two folds. His back seemed like a metal plate and his clothes instantly burst apart.</p><p>\"Gold Resonant Radiance Sword!\"</p><p>Ye Chen's speed soared as a golden sawtooth-shaped sword light streaked forth with a wave of his hand. The sword light ripped through the sky as it chopped at Yuwen Jie while carrying a high-frequency vibrational power.</p><p>A loud explosion rang out. But this time, Yuwen Jie only retreated for a hundred steps.</p><p>\"It's my turn.\"</p><p>With a cruel smile, Yuwen Jie ignored his bleeding chest as his body flickered, with his huge rapier raised up. In the next instant, he chopped at Ye Chen directly. From his back, black streams of Qi curled up, filling half of the sky. Conforming to his offensive, it seemed as if the entire sky was moving.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The two battled in the sky, on the ground, and in the water. Wherever their battle passed, dust filled the air, rock debris soared in the sky, and summits fell one by one.</p><p>\"Die!\"</p><p>Yuwen had two rapiers, but he had been using only one until now. When the battle had reached the critical point, his left hand reached his back and pulled out the second. It swept through, hoping to catch Ye Chen off guard.</p><p>\"Reverse Style Sky Thunder Cut!\"</p><p>With but a glance, Ye Chen's left hand pulled out the green longsword and chopped upward, causing the two weapons to collide together.</p><p>\"These two both use two weapons.\"</p><p>\"Yuwen Jie is not simple…He actually managed to pull out of that situation.\"</p><p>\"Demonic Clan's demonic transformation ability shouldn't be underestimated. Yuwen Jie's strength has at least increased by ten to twenty percent. But, hoping to suppress his opponent by relying on it seems like a long shot.\"</p><p>The spectators discussed the fight as the two separated again.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>\"Ye Chen, to force me to this extent, you can be proud of yourself. Next, prepare to kneel and beg for forgiveness.\"</p><p>Yuwen Jie stood atop a high summit. Behind him, black streams of Qi curled up incessantly as if brewing something while the two rapiers in his hands started to shimmer with a black glow.</p><p>Standing in the air, Ye Chen tightened his grip on swords and said coldly, \"Bring out everything you have. I'll crush all of it along with your extravagant dreams.\"</p><p>\"Your mouth sure is sharp. Let me see how long you can keep being arrogant.\"</p><p>Kacha!</p><p>The summit caved in for several meters and a scar ran all the way down it as Yuwen Jie spread out his hands and the tips of the two rapiers emitted out black spheres of light. These spheres were small, only about a thumb's size; they spun crazily while emitting frightening wheezing sounds, from amidst which black lightning leaked out.</p><p>\"This move will spill your blood...Demonic Light Wave!\"</p><p>Swish!</p><p>Yuwen Jie's stamp crushed the summit and he flickered to a few dozen meters before Ye Chen. He raised both his hands, resolutely smashing down the two rapiers. The two rapiers' ends collided, giving off a rumbling explosion. The sky suddenly darkened as the two black spheres on the rapiers' tip combined into a black light wave which streaked at Ye Chen. This black light wave seemed like a black dragon carrying black lightning.</p><p>\"Go die!\" Yuwen Jie's face had a nasty smile.</p><p>Yuwen Clan was the king of demonic clans. They held many demonic type martial skills of the ancient times, and the Demonic Gold Flicker and Demonic Light Wave were precisely two of those. Demonic Gold Flicker had an extreme offensive power, and although the latter was inferior in this aspect, its black lightning contained a frighteningly destructive power. Merely a trace of it was enough to obliterate a huge summit.</p><p>Yuwen Jie was convinced that this move was not something that Ye Chen could block.</p><p>However, Ye Chen neither retreated nor dodged. The two swords crisscrossed, facing the black energy light wave. At the point of intersection of the two swords was a majestic blue lightning thunder sphere. This sphere was Sky Thunder Cut and its reverse style combined; the destructive power of Sky Thunder Cut's superimposition with its reverse style was actually somewhat similar to Yuwen Jie's Demonic Light Wave.</p><p>The moment two energies collided, the space all around them warped; the ground quaked and mountains shook. A huge sound rang out, and mountain ranges within several dozen li were razed to the ground. Countless smashed rocks and crushed vegetation were swirled into whirlwinds, soaring into the sky. Then, they were further crushed by the black and blue lightning along with muffled explosions.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>It was at this moment that the black light energy wave and blue lightning sphere erupted with their full force. A ten meters wide and several thousand meters long lightning beam chopped down, engulfing the two right in its center.</p><p>With a swoosh, Yuwen Jie rushed out of the lightning beam with blood dripping from the corner of his mouth as he howled, \"Impossible! How can you resist Demonic Light Wave!\"</p><p>Nobody knew the might of this move better than himself. It was a move capable of razing an entire city.</p><p>With lightning snakes curling around his body, Ye Chen raised his head. His complexion had a hint of white, \"There is no such thing as impossible.\"</p><p>Although he spoke these words, he was inwardly sighing at Yuwen Jie's battle power. Murong Zhishui had said that Yuwen Ye was stronger than Yuwen Jie, but it seemed that the latter was much stronger. The others could only manage a four-limb demonic transformation or half-chest transformation, but Yuwen Jie directly underwent a half-body transformation. Furthermore, the Black Light Wave Yuwen Jie had used was much more powerful than Yuwen Ye's Demonic Gold Flicker. The former had evidently grasped the skill much better.</p><p>\"You have lost!\"</p><p>Sheathing the green longsword, Ye Chen flicked out his finger toward Yuwen Jie.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>A huge cyan-colored finger pierced through Yuwen Jie's protective Zhen Yuan, ignoring the distance of several dozen li. As a result, he was sent flying while spurting out blood along the way.</p><p>\"Daring to injure my people…get lost!\"</p><p>Fury raged in Lin Kui's eyes as he suddenly pulled out the battle blade from behind and chopped it toward Ye Chen. With that, a gray-colored, dull, and lonely blade light spread out.</p><p>\"Lin Kui, do you know any shame?\"</p><p>On the other side, Hai Wuya swatted his palm. His palm strike was like a boundless ocean as palm energies streaked toward the gray blade light like boundless waves.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The blade light was deflected and landed on the ground near Ye Chen. The ground immediately split apart, and huge waves of water flew out. Lin Kui's strike had directly pierced through the ground's surface and slashed through the water stream underground. The people around were shocked to their cores by this sight.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
