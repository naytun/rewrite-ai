Today, you won't be able to escape from Yuwen clan.\" Yuwen Jin kept his cool. He knew that as long as he could buy a little time, other Sea of Soul experts of the clan would rush over. His primary goal was simply to hold back Murong Zhishui.</p><p>Murong Zhishui sneered, \"With you two joining hands, I'm certainly not your match. But, if you want to keep me here, it's impossible.\"</p><p>His strength was more or less the same as Yuwen Jin. Adding on an ordinary Sea of Soul realm Master would make him suffer a little. But, if he wished to leave, the other side had no way of stopping him.</p><p>\"Hmph, you really think that?\"</p><p>Yuwen Jin's was lightning fast as he repeatedly attacked while the other Sea of Soul realm Master supplemented from the side.</p><p>Below them, the plaza of the clan was full of holes, and many of the constructions in the surroundings had also been destroyed. At regular intervals, some expert of the clan would rush over and join the encirclement, allowing the encirclement to always maintain a number of around thirty.</p><p>\"This kid is troublesome! We five will join hands and push him back.\"</p><p>Holding the Thunder Disaster Sword, Ye Chen tyrannically made his way through. Wherever he went, a rain of blood followed. Lightning interweaved, and whenever the sword light flickered, somebody would collapse with a hole in their chest. Seeing such heavy casualties, the five peak Daoist grade Sea of Souls realm experts took charge of dealing with him. They were the elders of the clan, and their ranks in the clan were not low.</p><p>\"Quick Sword, Prison!\"</p><p>If this move was used with the Gold Sword, every sword image's might would only be equivalent to an all-out strike of an ordinary Spirit Warrior. However, when it was deployed through the Thunder Disaster Sword, every sword image's might was increased to that of Daoist Grade. Countless sword images blossomed, seeming like an ocean of blue light thundering forth, and Ye Chen was riding on the very top of this blue ocean.</p><p>\"Eh! How is it possible to create so many sword images instantly?\"</p><p>\"Every sword is comparable to the full power attack of a Daoist grade expert. Resisting ten or so swords would be possible, but more than that….\"</p><p>The five were charging forth with a great momentum, but had to back out in a sorry state. However, the nearby clan members were caught in a disaster, their blood splashing everywhere.</p><p>\"You dare, kid!\"</p><p>One of the clan's top experts hurried over from afar. This person was ranked third amongst the clan elders. His name was Yuwen Lie, and his weapon was a blade. The blade's body was red as fire; as he slashed out, a fiery blade energy swirled forth while radiating an intense heat.</p><p>\"Kill!\"</p><p>Ye Chen took out the Gold Sword with his left hand and slashed conforming to the Thunder Disaster Sword: one straight and one inverse. The two sword lights rushed toward the fiery blade energy like heavenly judgment. Not only was the fiery energy was cleaved, a large part of it even attacked Yuwen Lie himself.</p><p>\"Damn it! When did this kid become powerful enough to contend against Sea of Soul Master? No, it's that sword!\"</p><p>Yuwen Lie had seen Ye Chen's portrait. Therefore, he immediately recognized him. Ye Chen in his mind was still quite far from the Master level. As he saw his fiery energy easily cleaved apart, and a part of it even being repelled back to himself, he was stupefied. However, after that, he could immediately feel that it was the effect of Thunder Disaster sword, and not Ye Chen's strength himself.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Yuwen Lie was, after all, a Sea of Soul realm Master; he wouldn't be defeated in one strike. With both hands, he raised the blade and resisted. He stood like the reef at the seashore, unmoving despite the year-long assault from the waves.</p><p>\"Half-step extreme grade sword is a waste in your hands. Why don't you let me have it?\"</p><p>His body shook once and his figure instantly turned from a steady reef to a blazing volcano. Holding the blade in his hands, he issued eighteen blade strikes one after another. Every strike contained a frightening amount of condensed energy. Scorching blade winds turned the surface, which was already riddled with holes, into a crystalline state.</p><p>\"Sword Light flying steps!\"</p><p>A sword light flickered outside Ye Chen's body as he suddenly shot into the sky. The gold sword was already back in its sheath while the Thunder Disaster Sword in his hands seemed like coiling electricity. It slashed down and issued an almost entirely golden, jagged-edged sword light. The sword light cut through space, creating waves like rippling water.</p><p>\"What a quick speed!\"</p><p>Yuwen Lie had rushed back to the clan, and thus, did not know that Ye Chen had this move as well. The blade energy bore no fruit. His figure flickered while speeding like fire and avoiding Ye Chen's most powerful sword strike.</p><p>\"Hmm…light arts containing fire profound!\"</p><p>Ye Chen's brows creased. Among major attributes, wind and thunder reigned supreme over speed. However, that was only under normal circumstances. Powerful experts could bring out aid from their attributes. For example, a flame was the fastest when it erupted. Of course, its duration was quite small, and couldn't be sustained for a long time.</p><p>\"Kid Ye, I'm the third elder of Yuwen clan. You think you can beat me by yourself?\"</p><p>Yuwen Lie appeared behind Ye Chen and stretched his hand as a fiery red vortex erupted forth. It had a powerful attraction force; tearing through the air like a blade, it tried to suck Ye Chen in.</p><p>Ye Chen knew that although Yuwen Lie was inferior to Yuwen Jin, he was also a powerful Sea of Soul Master. He was not like ordinary Sea of Soul Masters. Defeating him in a short time was simply impossible. However, at this moment, there was no room for retreat. Even if it were an impossible fight, he had to fight.</p><p>\"Gold Resonant Radiance Sword!\"</p><p>The intense battle spirit made Ye Chen's aura as sharp as a sword. At this crucial moment, The Gold Resonant Radiance Sword reached the greater success. Ninety percent completion and greater success only seemed to be apart by ten percent, but what they represented was completely different. Ninety percent completion represented a flaw, while the latter represented perfection. Be it sword momentum or sword energy, they would be completely different.</p><p>\"Chop!\"</p><p>Flickering with a golden color, the Thunder Disaster Sword obliquely slashed through the air.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>The red vortex was cleaved into two. The golden sword light carried a momentum of invincibility as it rumbled toward Yuwen Lie.</p><p>\"What? Breakthrough during the battle!\" Yuwen Lie was stunned.</p><p>It was rumored that some battle geniuses became stronger the more they fought. Under absolute pressure, they could overcome bottlenecks, ascending one more step from the top of a bamboo pole. Concerning such geniuses, a slight advantage didn't have much meaning, since it could be overcome at any moment. That advantage would only propel them forward, making one the stepping stone in the process.</p><p>\"B*stard, thinking of me as a stepping stone!\"</p><p>Yuwen Lie was furious as he slashed out; his whole being seemed like fire itself.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The sword and blade energy collided; the surface within several li rippled forth like a wave. In the next moment, a blade and a sword light beam shot in the sky. Be it experts of Yuwen clan or Murong clan, they all immediately stopped in their tracks. They discovered that this sword and blade energy had the power to pierce through their protective Zhen Yuan.</p><p>As for the area outside several li, it was completely unaffected. The waving surface was immediately pushed back upon reaching this point. It was actually Qi energy of Yuwen clan's Devil King, protecting the clan's constructions. Only the clan's plaza and surroundings were allowed to be the battle sites.</p><p>Of course, the clan's Devil King could kill any person on the site, but couldn't act precisely because he was the Devil King. He couldn't even appear on the site. Ye Chen was a genius that the Dragon king held in a high regard. If they acted against him, the Dragon King would certainly pay them a visit. Even if Yuwen clan tried to rely on numbers and Devil King went all out, the Dragon King wouldn't even glance at them while annihilating them all.</p><p>\"Junior brother Ye is too fierce.\"</p><p>Almost every person of the Murong clan had suffered some sort of injury. However, Wang Shi and Yan Kui were actually uninjured. They were people from the Dragon God Palace after all. The experts of Yuwen clan didn't dare to hurt them. They could only hold them back from helping others.</p><p>Su Ruhui nodded, \"He really is a dragon amongst men, a sword marvel.\"</p><p>After saying these words, her brows creased. In the air, Murong Zhishui was slowly pushed back. Under the joint assault of two Sea of Soul realm Masters, it was not easy to survive even to this moment.</p><p>\"Murong Zhishui, just surrender, or this place will be your grave today.\" Yuwen Jin punched out while countless golden blades cleaved through the void.</p><p>\"Dream on!\" Murong Zhishui tried to resist with all his might, displaying his strength to the peak.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>One side was Ye Chen against Yuwen Jie, while the other side was Yuwen Jin and Yuwen clan elder against Murong Zhishui. The shockwaves of the two battles rampaged, causing the space itself to ripple.</p><p>The other people temporarily stopped and merely raised their heads to watch the battle.</p><p>\"Everybody, stop!\"</p><p>At this moment, a shout came from outside the Yuwen clan. This shout seemed majestic and boundless, as if the voice had condensed into iron, pounding in the ears of everyone on site. Those with low cultivation bases paled, and those with high cultivation showed appalled expressions.</p><p>\"Palace Master!\" Yao Yifeng raised his head, gazing toward the shout.</p><p>\"Palace Master is here!\" Wang Shi and Yang Kui were delighted. Although they were rather surprised that Palace Master had rushed over so fast, it was a good news nevertheless.</p><p>Shua! Shua! Shua!</p><p>Three figures swiftly flew over, arriving above the plaza. The leader was a tall, sturdy man in his fifties. The man was wearing a yellow robe with a furious dragon embroidered on it. The dragon was baring its fangs and brandishing its claws upwards.</p><p>\"You're still not stopping?\"</p><p>The man in the yellow robe flicked his sleeves and issued two palm strikes toward the two battles.</p><p>Crackle!</p><p>The fist energy arrived with a crackling sound. Ye Chen and Yuwen Lie only felt a huge pressure arriving and involuntarily retreated. On the other side, Murong Jhishui and Yuwen Jin also stopped. They were clearly not faring well under this pressure either.</p><p>\"How powerful!\"</p><p>Ye Chen's pupils shrank. The yellow-robed man was clearly a Sea of Soul Master, but Yuwen Jin or Murong Zhishui were not even half as powerful as him. Just a casual palm strike from far away could make them part. Under the aftereffects of the fist energy, Ye Chen could feel his blood and Qi rampaging inside.</p><p>When Yuwen Jin saw the middle-aged man, his complexion changed, and he immediately came down. He then cupped his fists, \"So, it's Palace Master Zhang! My humble self is Yuwen clan's head master Yuwen Jin.\"</p><p>\"What is going on here?\"</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
