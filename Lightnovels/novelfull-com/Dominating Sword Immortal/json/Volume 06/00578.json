In his soul detection, he could see some hunters going in and out of the mountains on some rare occasions; the most powerful ones were only at Condensing Reality realm, while the weakest ones were only mortals.</p><p>\"In the last half a year, I never had the time or mood to train, so my profound sense has been stuck in that stage for so long now. Alright! I will train for a while here and try to make another breakthrough.\"</p><p>His body drew a beautiful line in the air and he disappeared into the mountains.</p><p>The group of mountains was indeed not that big, but that was in comparison to the Sky Martial Region. In Ye Chen's old world, it would already be considered massive, since it covered seven to eight hundred miles.</p><p>After circling around in the air a couple of times, Ye Chen picked a beautiful spot with a river, mountain, and even a waterfall to stay at for the next period of time.</p><p>Splash!</p><p>Before he even landed onto the ground, an evil looking strange fish shot out of the lake. It was ten meters long and full of spikes; its tail had a hook like a scorpion, which was looking horrifying; its mouth was full of sharp teeth that looked like massive iron needles. It also had two dorsal fins which seemed to have mutated, since they were both wide and long, allowing it to jump up into the sky without actually using its demon power. Its speed was extreme, no slower than the birds in the sky.</p><p>The strange fish's power was at rank 9, which was equivalent to a human Sea of Souls Realm warrior. Added with its mutation, its power would be even greater than beasts at the same realm. Its temper seemed to be rather short as well; Ye Chen's arrival seemed to have threatened it already, so it reached out of the water and tried to attack him.</p><p>Ye Chen smiled lightly, his right hand patting on the beast tag around his waist.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>In the next instant, the Dream Eating wolf appeared. Its hair were red, and its forehead was full of strange looking eyes. It had been a long time for the wolf in the surreal space, so the second its paws landed on the ground, it roared out loudly.</p><p>The strange fish was frightened, since the wolf was one level higher than itself. Consequently, the rank 10 beast vibration was obviously more intense than its.</p><p>However, this fish beast obviously had the intelligence to recognize power levels. After realizing that the wolf was only powerful in rankings and its battle power might not necessarily be as high, it also let out a strange, creepy groan from its mouth. Its wing-like fins flapped and its huge body attacked toward the wolf beast.</p><p>The wolf saw that there was a beast that dared to challenge it, so the eyes on its forehead opened in response. With that, a cold light shone from them, covering the strange-looking fish immediately.</p><p>The movement of the fish slowed down as if it was in a dream, its eyes losing their shine.</p><p>'Shi…'</p><p>It was indeed a mutated beast, as it even managed to escape from the dream that the wolf had created. But of course, that was because of the wound in the latter's soul that hadn't healed fully yet. Otherwise, even Sea of Souls Realm warriors would have to be concerned about its prowess. Once one was careless, they would be ambushed immediately. With that frightened scream, the fish did not dare to stay any longer as it turned around to dive into the lake again.</p><p>\"You can move around here, but do not run far!\" Without caring too much about the fish, Ye Chen told the wolf, and the latter nodded.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>With that, it shot out into the mountain immediately, ready to enjoy its freedom. Shaking his head, Ye Chen looked back around him.</p><p>It was quite a big space; behind him were green mountains from where lots of small waterfalls were pouring down. Natural water filtered out from within the gaps of the mountain rocks. Some of the places sank in, forming a not-too-small, deep pond. In front of the mountain, there was a bright clear lake which seemed endless. Light reflected on the surface, while countless different looking fish would jump out from the water from time to time, making it look rather colorful.</p><p>\"The great scenery is good, but it will not last forever.\"</p><p>Ye Chen was not affected by the scenery in front of him. Instead, the prettier the view was, the more he was inspired to get better. After all, he knew that pretty things would disappear one day, and only his power would be with him forever.</p><p>Sitting on a rock under the waterfall, he had his eyes closed as he studied the changes in his soul ocean.</p><p>Waves continued to scramble inside his soul ocean, with three swords floating on top: the slaughter sword spirit, the destruction sword spirit, and the third one only being a sword spirit embryo. Its power was not even as strong as one-tenth of the other two.</p><p>Before, when the second sword spirit had not been infused with the destruction element yet, it was able to have a connection with the killing sword spirit and help each other out during a battle. But right then, the destruction sword spirit had been formed completely, and the connection between the two had increased by ten times as they augmented each other's vibration.</p><p>\"The destruction sword intent contains the destruction intent, which is more powerful than the slaughter sword intent. Of course, they are two different individual intents with their own special uses which do not interfere with each other. As a result, they do not decrease the each other's power.\"</p><p>\"Hm? The destruction sword spirit is devouring the slaughter qi?\"</p><p>At that moment, Ye Chen saw something surprising. The black destruction sword spirit looked extremely mighty; its destruction sword intent spread out in the whole area and started to absorb the slaughter qi from the killing sword spirit while the latter looked really calm and did not seem to fight back.</p><p>\"Killing starts from destruction, so the destruction would contain slaughter as well. The two were one at the start, and now are again one. I wonder what would happen when the destruction sword spirit manages to devour the slaughter sword spirit as a whole one day. It would definitely grow a lot.\"</p><p>Letting out a deep breath, Ye Chen's focus left his soul ocean.</p><p>\"Once the destruction spirit is completed, only the immortal sword spirit would be stuck at where it was this whole time. But before that, I want to form the third sword spirit into a real one first. Then, I can infuse it with the immortal sword intent and create an immortal sword spirit that is just as powerful as the destruction sword spirit.\"</p><p>Opening his eyes, he lifted up his head and looked beyond the clouds.</p><p>\"Do not go crazy around here. I will go to the Extreme Void to learn more about the thunder profound.\" Ye Chen communicated with the wolf through the soul mark. He was not worried that anything would happen to it, since they two were linked through the soul. So, he would know everything immediately. The reason that he let it out was to let it breathe some fresh air, in case it went crazy one day without interacting with the outside world.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>He bent his knees slightly and shot out into the clouds. His sharp sword qi sliced through the sky before disappearing completely.</p><p>…</p><p>Time flew by, and it had already been ten days. Near the crack in the underworld, a black shadow was seen standing there.</p><p>It was the Evil Demon Master.</p><p>\"I am late!\"</p><p>He tightened his fists, looking extra dark.</p><p>Ever since he reached the Sea of Souls Realm master level, he had never been this frustrated. If it were a master level warrior that made him this way, perhaps he would not be this angry. But, it was just an Astral Reaching Realm warrior with some master level sword intent.</p><p>\"I will definitely get my hands on the Undying Martial Art one way or another! According to the rumors, one would reach the Life and Death Realm by only training the level where one can regrow the broken limbs. It is a shortcut toward the Life and Death Realm.\"</p><p>After controlling his temper, he flashed his body and left the spot.</p><p>…</p><p>Extreme Void!</p><p>Crack!</p><p>Bright lightning exploded everywhere while space patterns could be spotted everywhere in the surreal sky. Wherever the thunder was, it seemed like a sharp axe, cutting the floating mountains in halves. The massive trees had been burned black, rampant flames visible everywhere.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Thick lightning was attacking toward Ye Chen, containing an extremely deep thunder profound which increased its speed by ten times.</p><p>\"Sky Thunder Cut!\"</p><p>He held his longsword and fought back.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The two beams of lightning clashed, bringing up countless sparks.</p><p>\"No! This is too weak…I will not be able to learn much from it. With my current power, I should go even higher in the Extreme Void.\"</p><p>With that thought in mind, he flew higher.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>It was the center of the thunder ocean, where the thunder Yuan Qi had become thick to the point of liquifying like water. Ye Chen was only trying to reach the edge, his protective Zhen yuan looking like it might break down at any second. With the speed and quantity of thunder pouring down, it would be hard for Ye Chen to even move here.</p><p>\"Sky Thunder Cut!\"</p><p>\"Reverse Sky Thunder Cut!\"</p><p>Holding the Thunder Disaster sword in his right hand and the gold sword in his left, Ye Chen fought against the lightning fiercely.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>It was then that a human figure made of thunder flew over.</p><p>\"A thunder spirit!\" Ye Chen's expression changed.</p><p>Human beings had consciousness, and even plants would have their own after a long time; the same went for even rocks. Where the thunder yuan qi was this rich, it would be natural to find thunder spirits without consciousness. The thunder spirit was formed from the condensed thunder yuan qi; the higher the intelligence, the more powerful it would be. After a certain level, they would even know how to use the thunder profound, so their battling power would also be extremely powerful. Therefore, the thunder spirits would be almost immortal in this place that was full of thunder yuan qi. Even if their body was shattered, they could accumulate everything again, unless one destroyed their consciousness.</p><p>Splash!</p><p>The thunder spirit waved its hand, causing endless thunder tornados to attack toward Ye Chen. That shining thunder was even sharper than a blade, so bright that one's eyes would hurt on staring at it.</p><p>It was a powerful one, even more powerful than Ye Chen. With only one pot of tea worth of time, Ye Chen had been hit dozens of times. If it were not for the fact that he had cultivated the undying body which allowed him to repair his body instantly, he might have died already.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>As he repaired his body again, another massive thunder appeared in front of him and landed right on top of his head.</p><p>The electricity went through his body, making him suddenly look transparent as if he were a huge light bulb. Every meridian and internal organ of his could be seen clearly.</p><p>\"Thunder…The profound sense of thunder! I see it now!\"</p><p>After being hit right on by the thunder, Ye Chen had been wounded badly. If it were not for his powerful soul power, that thunder attack would have destroyed his soul completely. No matter how powerful his undying body was, it would be useless. However, after that powerful attack, Ye Chen had learned so much about the thunder profound; he felt the time had stopped, and only the formation of thunder played in his head again and again.</p><p>\"Sky Thunder Cut! Complete!\"</p><p>As he opened his eyes suddenly, an electricity flashed once in his eyes before disappearing. Next, Ye Chen threw out an attack toward the thunder spirit. It was a pure thunder attack which looked nothing different from a normal one. However, the thunder profound it contained had ameliorated by a couple of times.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>That sword devoured the body of the thunder spirit immediately, turning it into a part of the thunder and increasing its power.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
