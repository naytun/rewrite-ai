Earlier on, the latter had not only killed his favorite Mo Luo, but had also messed up the wedding ceremony, which was the number one priority of the Yuwen family. He would never forget what Ye Chen had done today. He swore to himself that when the Dragon King died one day, he would show the latter what it would be like to wish for a quick death and regret for a lifetime. As for now, he would just ask his son to teach him a small lesson.</p><p>\"Holding back? I will not do that. Murong Qingcheng will only be my woman! Fighting with me for my womanâ€¦He is doomed to live under my shadow. I will beat and humiliate him constantly. Under that endless embarrassment and humiliation, what else can he achieve in this life? Without further achievements, for me to kill him would be like killing a dog.\"</p><p>With that horrible smile on his face, Yuwen Ye in his bridegroom's outfit took a huge step forward. He pointed at Ye Chen and said, \"Ye Chen, do you dare to battle with me?\"</p><p>\"Before, it was your older brother Yuwen Hao, and right now, it is you. Do I have to beat every single one of you?\" Ye Chen said sarcastically.</p><p>\"What? Are you afraid? If you are, then leave now. And from now on, do not ever show up in front of me.\"</p><p>\"Why not? But, what do I get if I win against you too?\"</p><p>Yuwen Ye said, \"If you win, then my father will, of course, let go of the spell on her. But if you lose, then it will have nothing to do with you, and you will have to leave immediately. Whoever dares to break this deal, the other can kill him. How about that? Are you satisfied now?\"</p><p>\"Yuwen Jin, do you agree as well?\" Ye Chen looked over at Yuwen Jin.</p><p>Yuwen Jin said lightly, \"What he said represents me as well.\"</p><p>\"I hope you will not break your promises.\" As he spoke, Ye Chen jumped up into the air. Yuwen Ye sneered in response, flying up as well.</p><p>A thousand meters in the air, the two maintained five hundred meters of distance in between them, staring at each other with a serious look on their faces. The heavy wind blew their hair and clothes into the air, which made them look even scarier.</p><p>\"Ye Chen, be careful of Yuwen Ye's special power. Although I do not know what it exactly is, but according to the history of the perfect bloodline, it will most likely have something to do with speed or defense. Those powers would be very effective.\" Down on the ground, Murong Zhishui passed on a Zhen yuan message to Ye Chen, reminding him to be careful.</p><p>Ye Chen answered without changing his expression, \"Sir, do not need worry. Regardless of what kind of special power he has, I will beat him.\"</p><p>Before he managed to comprehend fifty percent of his Void Shattering Finger, Ye Chen was very scared of Yuwen Ye's special power. But right now, he did not have to care for it at all. All he needed to do was watch out for him, since any special power would not increase the actual power to a completely different level. It would be extremely good if he managed to increase his overall power by two times, and it had to be a very rare body type as well.</p><p>On the contrary, his Void Shattering Finger would be able to tear open a warrior's protective Zhen yuan at the same realm when he first learned it already. But now, his Void Shattering Finger had reached a level hundred times more potent than before. Even a master level Sea of Souls Realm warriors' protective Zhen yuan would be like paper in front of his finger attack. Its attacking power would be something that the Ye Chen from before could not have even imagined.</p><p>\"This confident?\"</p><p>Murong Zhishui had never seen Ye Chen's Void Shattering Finger, so he had no idea where his confidence came from. But of course, for him, having confidence would be the best.</p><p>\"Are you ready?\" Yuwen Ye looked at Ye Chen with obvious confidence.</p><p>\"Anytime when you are ready!\" Ye Chen rested his right hand onto the gold sword.</p><p>Pap! Pop! Pap! Pop!</p><p>The two had still not started fighting yet, but their aggressive qi clashed together, bringing up countless qi swirls. Once one reached the Sea of Souls Realm, the aura would be almost materialized. Because of their martial spirit inside, its attacking power should not be underestimated at all. It could easily wound any Astral Reaching Realm warrior. But of course, it was still invisible and shapeless. Therefore, it could not compete with the actual Astral Reaching Realm warrior's attacks. Nevertheless, it was already scary enough.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>For the last wave of qi attacks, the two seemed to have used their full aura. A wave of see-through pattern spread out, looking extremely colorful.</p><p>\"Rank four martial spirit!\" Ye Chen tested and realized that Yuwen Ye had reached the fourth level in terms of martial spirit, which would be already considered the master level. He was indeed a lot more powerful than Yuwen Hao. Added with his own aura at peak level Mid Sea of Souls Realm, he would indeed be really powerful. No wonder he was so confident.</p><p>\"Ye's martial spirit has reached rank 4?\" A joyous expression flashed past Yuwen Jin's face as he thought to himself, 'It seems like letting Ye travel inside the Sky Martial Region for a year was indeed the right decision. Within a year of time, his martial spirit managed to shine already, reaching the rank 4.'</p><p>'But, this brat also has quite a powerful aura. His sword spirit must be at peak level rank 4 right now.' It was impossible for Yuwen Jin not to know of Ye Chen's cultivation right then. And being able to still compete with his Ye through his aura, his sword spirit ranking would have to be half a rank higher. Plus, the sword intent was always famous for its attacking power, so it would not be unreasonable for it to make up for the lacking cultivation.</p><p>\"If I have guessed it right, you are at peak level rank 4, right?\" Yuwen Ye was surprised.</p><p>\"So what?\"</p><p>It was just a testing round, so Ye Chen did not even use his slaughter sword intent. He only let out the destruction sword intent without infusing it with anything else. It was just at the peak level rank 4.</p><p>\"Very well! Now, it can finally be interesting.\" Yuwen Ye had just got back from the Sky Martial Region, where he had been beaten by a lot of warriors with peak level rank 4 martial spirit. But, those warriors were different from Ye Chen, as they were powerful in every aspect. So even with his special power, he was not able to do much. Due to this, he had been frustrated for a long time already. Right now, Ye Chen was also at peak level rank 4, which was another reason for him to humiliate Ye Chen and blow off some steam.</p><p>\"Water Beast Cage! Trap him!\"</p><p>Yuwen Ye yelled out as both of his hands started to form a spell at an extremely high speed. All of a sudden, that surprising water yuan qi gathered from everywhere and stuck onto the Zhen yuan formed cage. It was generated with the water profound; looking at its shape, it seemed to be more powerful than that fire cage from that master level warrior before. The latter was still a master level warrior after all, so his profound sense controlling ability would be more powerful than Ye Chen's.</p><p>Dang!</p><p>The cage fell from the sky, trapping Ye Chen within.</p><p>\"You want to restrain me?\" Ye Chen took out his gold sword and waved it down at the cage.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>With that, the cage broke immediately.</p><p>Yuwen Ye did not panic as he said with a creepy voice, \"It is not over! Final formation!\"</p><p>In the next instant, the broken cage started to repair at an extreme speed. Meanwhile, a lizard-like Zhen yuan water beast jumped on top of the cage. With the beast's control, the surface of the cage shone with a green light, looking as if it was made with a tough crystal.</p><p>\"Huh? Mid rank profound martial art!\"</p><p>Ye Chen suddenly realized that the reason the fire cage of the master level warrior was so powerful was that it was a mid rank profound martial art. But, Yuwen Ye's water profound martial art comprehension was not that deep, seeming to only be able to bring out thirty percent of its power.</p><p>\"Break!\"</p><p>His Zhen yuan vibrated as he performed his Gold Resonant Radiance Art attack.</p><p>Chin!</p><p>The toughness of the cage was not as strong as the master level's fire cage. Hence, it started to crack open under Ye Chen's most powerful sword attack.</p><p>\"Killing Water Fist!\"</p><p>Yuwen Ye did not expect his cage to actually manage to trap Ye Chen, since he knew that his understanding was not deep enough. Consequently, it was not powerful enough. He was very clear that that attack would only be used to fight for an upper hand in the battle. Right then, since his goal had been reached, so he roared as he threw out his right first with a circle of black pattern around it. It covered half of the sky, turning that side of the world into a world of water. The attack landed heavily on Ye Chen, who was about to throw out a new attack.</p><p>\"Reverse Sky Thunder Cut!\"</p><p>Ye Chen grabbed his emerald longsword with his left hand and welcomed the incoming attack.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The Killing Water Fist Power was extremely powerful, causing Ye Chen to be blown away in the air. But, in that sword attack he had just thrown out was added his slaughter sword intent, which allowed him to step out without getting wounded.</p><p>\"Get down now!\"</p><p>With his fist helping him get the advantage, Yuwen Ye followed up. His body continued to flash at a superfast speed, which was not that slower than Ye Chen's. He then threw out countless fist attacks, covering the sky with his black fist shadows.</p><p>Putting back his longsword, Ye Chen's five fingers flicked quickly in the air, and beams of ray-like lotus heart sword qi appeared. Because there were so many of them, a sword qi tornado was formed spontaneously. With the advantage in quantity, it had immediately canceled out Yuwen Ye's fist power.</p><p>\"What? This many sword qi finger attacks!\"</p><p>Yuwen Ye thought that Ye Chen's most powerful attack would be his Gold Resonant Radiance Art. Therefore, he had used his water beast cage to trap him right in the beginning, making him burn out the Zhen yuan needed for the attack and forcing him to not be able to use it again in a short while. But, what he did not foresee was that Ye Chen still had such powerful sword qi tornado attack beside the Gold Resonant Radiance Art attack.</p><p>Ting! Ting! Dang! Dang!</p><p>In the most critical moment, Yuwen Ye crossed his hands in front of his chest, forming a six star protective shield in front of him. It looked like a human-sized hexagonal crystal, with the center being extra thick. Because of the fluid lining, the incoming power could be deflected easily. It was his most potent defensive martial art.</p><p>The sword qi continued to slam on him as Yuwen Ye was trapped behind his shield. But all of a sudden, the sword qi tornado disappeared. In its place, a wave of pure gold sword light rushed over, landing onto his shield.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Just like that, the crystal-like shield had been broken!</p><p>Right then, Ye Chen was already close to Yuwen Ye.</p><p>The latter lifted up his head, a cold sharp light shining in his eyes, \"I was waiting for you this whole time. Special power! Defense Enhancement!\"</p><p>Compared to Yuwen Hao's demonization power, Yuwen Ye's special power was extremely fast. Suddenly, two horns appeared on his head, very thick and wide at the bottom and with a swirling pattern carved on top. They shone with a cold, creepy light. Once in contact with the air, a first sized vacuum space had been formed.</p><p>The second the horns had appeared, Yuwen Ye's skin and his protective Zhen yuan had changed drastically. Its thickness had been increased by another couple of times.</p><p>It had some similarities to the demonization power, but it was way more powerful than the latter.</p><p>At the same time, Defense Enhancement augmented Yuwen Ye's power as well. More importantly, it allowed him to ignore the other's attack. All he needed to do now was to attack with all the power he had.</p><p>\"Back out!\"</p><p>Yuwen Ye's back fist light was thrown out, still deploying his Killing Water Fist Attack; however, its power was increased by a lot this time. A space pattern appeared and wrapped around his fist.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ye Chen's well-prepared sword attack had arrived as well, clashing with the incoming fist.</p><p>Dang!</p><p>A metal exploding sound was heard as the two both backed out. What was different was that Yuwen Ye managed to stop his flying body and jumped at Ye Chen again while sneering, \"After I enhance my defensive power, my endurance and reflexes are enhanced as well.\"</p><p>\"Oh, is that so?\"</p><p>The slaughter sword spirit inside Ye Chen's head started to make a ringing noise as his slaughter sword intent poured out like an ocean.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
