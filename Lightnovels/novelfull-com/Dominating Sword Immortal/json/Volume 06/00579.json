The sword attack that contained the thunder profound could not harm it, only managing to stop it for a while. The next second, it managed to escape from the thunder sword power and reform its body. It basically walked away from that attack without a scratch.</p><p>\"Indeed a thunder spirit! It is so powerful!\"</p><p>\"However, the power of the Sky Thunder Cut is not my most potent attack after all, being way less powerful than the Gold Resonant Radiance. Only by combining with the reverse one would it be the most powerful attack. Plus, using thunder profound to attack the thunder spirit would a waste of time.\"</p><p>Ye Chen was not surprised at all about the fact that his attack did not work on the thunder spirit, since he was only here to learn more about the profound sense instead of coming here to kill the thunder spirits.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The thunder spirit waved out a couple more lightning attacks toward Ye Chen. But this time, he did not use his Sky Thunder Cut to fight back. As a matter of fact, he did not actually use any sword attacks because he knew that in order to beat this kind of an entity, it would be useless to use any of his martial arts. There would be no point in shattering their bodies which they could easily reform; hence, he could only use his mentality.</p><p>\"Kill!\"</p><p>His eyes locked onto the thunder spirit as the center between his eyebrows was raised up. Next, the slaughter sword intent shot straight out.</p><p>Whoo!</p><p>The thunder spirit's speed slowed down, allowing one to see the thick thunder yuan qi leaking out of their bodies as their rich bodies became almost surreal. They looked like they would disappear at any second.</p><p>\"It is quite hard for you to form a consciousness already, so I will not kill you now.\"</p><p>Ye Chen's power was indeed not as monstrous as the thunder spirit, but it did not mean that he could not kill them, since the biggest weakness of the thunder spirit was its soul. Because it was a living entity formed from thunder, its soul would be originally weak, weaker than any Sea of Souls Realm warrior. Therefore, their mental power was weak as well. On the contrary, Ye Chen's slaughter sword intent had reached peak level rank 5 already, so he could easily shatter the thunder spirit's soul. In other words, it would be easier for him to kill the thunder spirit, which was more powerful than him, than killing weaker Sea of Souls Realm warriors, since any one of those warriors would have martial intent. After the counterattack of the martial intent, Ye Chen's sword intent would not have as much attacking power anymore. At least, it would be impossible for him to shatter Sea of Souls Realm level souls easily, unless his opponent was way weaker than him.</p><p>Of course, this thunder spirit did not seem to have been around for a long period of time. If it were old enough, then its soul could have grown stronger as well. In fact, once the soul of these different kinds of life entities got stronger, their power would augment to a crazy level. That was why there had been very powerful ones amongst them in the past.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>Leaving the thunder spirit alone, Ye Chen shot down toward the ground.</p><p>Back at the mountain range, Ye Chen scanned around the area with his soul power and saw that his wolf was devouring some organs and spinal fluid of some beast, creating a rather bloody sight.</p><p>Ye Chen shook his head; he knew that the wolf was desperately wanting to recover from his soul wounds. But, there was rarely anything in this world that could do that. And, people who found them would not want to take them out for sale. Therefore, if one wanted it, one would have to search for it.</p><p>\"Should I give the wolf the Nine Twist Reverse Spirit Plant? Would it be worth it?\"</p><p>Ye Chen frowned, torn about whether to do it or not.</p><p>'The power of the wolf's dream would be extremely useful. In critical moments, it would be a great help…Since I have already taken some, it would not grant me as much effect anymore…If I just leave it in my ring, then I will not be able to use it anytime soon, if not at all. I might as well use it on the wolf now.'</p><p>With that thought in mind, Ye Chen made a decision and called back the wolf through the soul mark.</p><p>'Come back.'</p><p>'Awhooo!'</p><p>The latter roared once into the air before running toward Ye Chen. After arriving, it used its huge head to rub against the latter's body.</p><p>Patting on the wolf's hair, Ye Chen took out the plant from his storage ring and tore down a leaf to hand over to it.</p><p>The wolf sniffed it, and after realizing the fact that there was so much soul power contained within it, the wolf was surprised and full of excitement. It could not help but look up at Ye Chen, as if to ask whether if it was actually for it.</p><p>Ye Chen nodded.</p><p>'Whoowhoowhooo…'</p><p>After receiving Ye Chen's confirmation, it groaned happily once before biting onto the leaf and swallowing it quickly after chewing a couple of times.</p><p>Whoo!</p><p>As it did so, the vague soul vibration spread out, containing powerful hallucinations which twisted the reality. After a long period of time, the wolf lifted up its head again to look at Ye Chen.</p><p>\"There...All for you.\" Ye Chen handed over all the rest of the plant to the wolf, who looked at him gratefully before swallowing it as a whole.</p><p>A dim light flashed in front of Ye Chen. In his sight, the surroundings seemed to become dreamy, looking more like the dream had overlapped the reality, making it impossible to tell which was which. It was not done purposely by the wolf—while it was recovering from its soul damage, it was not able to control its own power, which led to the leakage of the dream power, devouring the reality.</p><p>\"Hm? The quality of this dream seems to be even more powerful than before!\" Ye Chen was slightly shocked.</p><p>In fact, Ye Chen had underestimated the effect of the Nine Twist Reverse Soul Plant which was able to empower the soul, naturally leading to the recovery of the soul. It was actually rather hard to empower the soul. In comparison, it was actually easier to repair a damaged soul. Therefore, these six leaves could not only fully recover the wolf's damaged soul, but also ameliorate its soul power.</p><p>'Awoo—!!'</p><p>With its soul being completely cured and enhanced, the wolf roared into the sky while all the eyes on its forehead opened up. The dim light spread out like a ripple in the air. Wherever it touched, the line between reality and dream had been blurred. As long as one entered the coverage of the light, one would be dragged into the dream world of the wolf, and the life and death would be in its hands.</p><p>As the owner of the wolf, although the light covered him within as well, it could not affect him.</p><p>'It seems like that I have made the right decision. This ability of creating dreams can wound Seas of Souls Realm master warriors when they are not being careful. Even if it is only for a split second, I can wound them severely.' Ye Chen thought to himself. The power of this wolf was too awesome, and surely would be a great help.</p><p>As for the rare plant, it was okay to use it on this, since he did not know what else it could be used for right now.</p><p>Rubbing the hair of the wolf gently, Ye Chen said, \"In the future where we are in a life and death situation, you cannot try staying out.\"</p><p>'Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!'</p><p>The wolf shook its tail in response; it wanted to fight before this whole time, since fighting was a part of its nature.</p><p>\"So strange! When the other beasts reach rank 9 or 10, they would be able to say something simple already, so why can't you? Your soul is even more powerful than them!\"</p><p>The wolf lowered its head—not being able to speak was its shame. It did not understand why it was so weak in this area either.</p><p>\"Haha…brother, the wolf is here! We finally found it.\"</p><p>In the distance, a group of human shadows flew over, all at the Sea of Souls Realm. The one speaking was a one-eyed man, and in front of him was a Late Sea of Souls Realm warrior.</p><p>\"You sure this is the Dream Eating Wolf?\"</p><p>The middle-aged blade artist stared at the Dream Eating wolf standing right next to Ye Chen.</p><p>\"Before, I was not sure either, but I've seen all of the eyes opening on its forehead before, causing all of the beasts to freeze right where they were, ready to be killed.\"</p><p>The one-eyed man had seen the wolf before, and knew that he would not be able to handle the wolf with his own power. So, he went back to find his friends and come back together. After all, although the wolf would be great to have, but he did not have the power to do so, neither did he have a beast tag.</p><p>\"As long as you can confirm it.\" A greedy expression flashed past the middle-aged blade artist.</p><p>Ye Chen stared at those unwelcome guests as he patted his wolf.</p><p>\"Are you the owner of this wolf?\"</p><p>Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!</p><p>A group of people stood in midair as the middle-aged man asked Ye Chen.</p><p>Ye Chen said lightly, \"Correct.\"</p><p>\"Sell your wolf to me, then I will let you go free.\"</p><p>\"Sell it to you?\" Ye Chen chuckled, \"I don't think you can afford it.\"</p><p>\"I am the leader of the Black Wind Group, and this area is under my jurisdiction. How about this? I am willing to give you one hundred thousand top rank soul stones for your wolf.\" The warrior was still slightly scared of the wolf, so he was trying to avoid a battle. But, he would not be willing if he had to spend too much. One hundred thousand was already where he drew the line.</p><p>\"You think you can use that amount of money to buy a Dream Eating Wolf?\" Ye Chen sneered.</p><p>\"What? Are you not willing?\" The blade artist's voice cooled down, his eyes full of killing intent.</p><p>\"Kill them.\"</p><p>Ye Chen did not care for the middle-aged warrior as he gestured the wolf to create a dreamscape. Since these people had found out about the wolf, he could not let them stay alive in case of future troubles.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>Hearing him, the wolf shot out into the sky, its speed fast like lightning.</p><p>\"Increase our distance! Do not let it get close to you!\"</p><p>Obviously, these people knew very well about the power of the Dream Eating Wolf, so they hurried to increase the distance from the wolf.</p><p>Unfortunately, they had underestimated the range of the wolf's dream. All they could see was a wavy patterned dim light spreading out suddenly; besides the fastest middle-aged blade artist, the others had fallen into the dream, freezing where they were standing. The middle-aged man saw what had happened and gasped as he threw out an attack at the wolf, hoping that this attack would make it stop this dream.</p><p>\"Die!\"</p><p>Ye Chen pointed out one of his fingers; a massive blue finger ignored the physical distance and pressed onto the protective Zhen yuan of the middle-aged man.</p><p>Pop!</p><p>The blade artist disappeared in the next moment, his body turning into a blood mist as he exploded. All of his storage rings and great items fell onto the ground.</p><p>As for the others, they did not need Ye Chen or the wolf to attack at all. All of a sudden, wounds appeared on their bodies, getting more and more severe. Eventually, they all died in the dreamscape, and their bodies fell down into the lake in the real world.</p><p>Dream or reality would become very confusing under the control of the wolf, unless one had a very powerful mental power.</p><p>\"It seems that I had underestimated your power again after all.\" Ye Chen watched those men die automatically and could not help but comment. In his old world, there had been a movie before called 'A Nightmare On Elm Street'; the wolf's ability was very similar to the character Freddy, just that the wolf's body could not travel within the dream.</p><p>Whoo!</p><p>All of a sudden, Ye Chen's storage ring vibrated once. He frowned a bit as he took out a jade tag of his. There were some guiding arrows on it, and the one pointing in the north-west direction had been lit up.</p><p>\"We are gathering?\"</p><p>It was a jade tag Yan Fengfeng had given him before, which was used to notify each other that it was time for a meetup.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
