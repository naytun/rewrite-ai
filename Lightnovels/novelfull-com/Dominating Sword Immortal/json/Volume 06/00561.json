There were numerous top warriors within the region, and some of the rare spirit plants and medicines could be found there as well. According to the rumors, the Undead Tree was right here in the region, although no one really knew where it actually was, not even the Surreal Emperor and the Mysterious Queen. After all, there would always be more unknown things out there than known.</p><p>After hearing the Mysterious Queen's suggestion about traveling to the Sky Martial Region, Ye Chen nodded in agreement. There was no reason for him to not go, since even with his power now, it would not be impossible for him to make something for himself.</p><p>\"The Sky Martial Region has quite a complicated situation. After you get there, go to the Phoenix Cry Mountain first.\"</p><p>Mysterious Queen could tell that Ye Chen did not want to go for now, so she left that suggestion in the air before waving her right hand and disappearing in a surreal door that she had just created with the space power.</p><p>Waiting until she had left, Murong Zhishui said, \"This Shadowless Poison was created inside our demi demon family. I did not expect to see it be used on my wife…\"</p><p>Ye Chen tried to comfort him, \"If sir believes in me, then I will take care of the ingredients for the antidote. Three years of time should be enough.\"</p><p>\"Then I will leave it to you.\"</p><p>There were quite a lot of ingredients in the making of the antidote, and Murong Zhishui just hoped that Ye Chen could be as lucky as he was for a long time.</p><p>\"Since this thing is finished, then let's get back to the South Rudra Region!\"</p><p>Ye Chen had already thought about going to the Sky Martial Region, so he planned to go back home to say goodbye before leaving.</p><p>\"Naturally!\" Murong Zhishui nodded.</p><p>The leader of the Yellow Dragon Palace, Zhang Zhengguang, had already left a while ago, so Ye Chen and the rest said goodbye to Wang Shi and Yankui. Then, they jumped onto a red eyed flying bird beast and started their trip back to the South Rudra Region.</p><p>However, the red eyed bird beast was indeed way slower than Ye Chen's flying puppet. If it were only a couple hundred miles, then it might still be able to travel at a relatively fast speed. However, if it were way more than that, then it would just take too long. Without a choice, Ye Chen took out two flying puppets. Although the latter was only twice as fast, it could also save twice as much time, since the flying puppet did not have to rest at all.</p><p>After twenty days, the group had finally arrived back in the Murong family.</p><p>\"Wait until I reach the Sea of Souls Realm. I will come find you in the Sky Martial Region.\"</p><p>Murong Qingcheng knew that the gap between her and Ye Chen was too big. Only by reaching the Sea of Souls Realm could she shorten the gap; otherwise she would only be a burden for Ye Chen if she tagged along with him. But obviously, her potential was not that weak either. Once she managed to train some of her demon power essence, her realm should be able to reach peak level Early Sea of Souls Realm for sure. It would not be impossible to reach the middle rank as well, since the demon power essence was the essence of demon beasts, and each drop of it would contain a huge amount of demon power.</p><p>\"No need to hurry! You should spend more time on stabilizing the cultivation as well. \"</p><p>Of course, Ye Chen knew about her advantages. Once she reached the Sea of Souls Realm, she would be at least at spirit warrior level, which was already very impressive. But, the Sky Martial Region was not an easy-going place, as it was a top spot for top warriors. Therefore, it would be packed with mighty existences.</p><p>\"Yeah!\" Murong Qingcheng pressed her lips together. Although she was not that close with Ye Chen yet, but they were not that far behind. All they needed was more time together.</p><p>\"I will leave this flying puppet with you. You will need it a lot soon.\"</p><p>Turning his wrist, a cougar flying puppet appeared in front of her, floating in the air. Ye Chen smiled brightly while looking at Murong Qingcheng directly in the eyes, not hiding his emotions at all.</p><p>A blush appeared on her face as Murong Qingcheng's bright eyes were filled with feelings as well.</p><p>…</p><p>On the way back to the Sky Martial Nation, Ye Chen took out his dragon balls.</p><p>\"It turns out that the dragon balls can charge themselves. I wonder how long it will take to have them all fully charged.\"</p><p>It had been one month or so after Ye Chen used his Yellow Dragon Sealing Art for the first time. During this time, the dragon balls seemed to develop its natural color, no longer looking so dimmed.</p><p>\"It is easy to learn the sealing art. But, although it looked so simple for me to take on the Tyrant Fist Master, it was all because of my soul power.\"</p><p>Zhang Zhengguang's soul power was nowhere near Ye Chen's. But still, he was able to shock Yao Yifeng to the stage where he could not even fight back. And, Ye Chen's soul power was four to five times stronger than Zhang Zhengguang's soul power. When he sealed up the Tyrant Fist Master's power, he even left some Zhen yuan behind purposely. And it was indeed the gap between them.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>The flying puppet disappeared in the horizon.</p><p>…</p><p>The mountains in front slowly expanded. Ye Chen sitting on top saw one of the thirty-six mountains under the Mysterious Martial School.</p><p>\"This time coming to the Sky Martial Region, I guess it will be a long time staying here.\"</p><p>After arriving in the South Rudra Region, Ye Chen had spent some time in the family before saying goodbye again to his parents, leaving for the Phoenix Cry Mountain inside the Sky Martial Region.</p><p>Last time, he was in a hurry, so he did not have the time to have a closer look at the mountain. But this time here, he realized that there was a light hint of rawness in this group of mountains. It represented the ancient history of these mountains, which could be traced back to the ancient era.</p><p>Chirp!</p><p>A crisp loud bird chirping was heard. Ye Chen's expression changed slightly, as he could feel his blood traveling at a faster speed in his veins.</p><p>\"This bird is…?\"</p><p>Ye Chen looked over and could see a giant blue bird in the sky to his side. It had seven or eight meter long wings on the side, and feathers on its head that looked like it was wearing a crown. There were three feathers with different colors from each other and the rest, looking quite majestic.</p><p>\"The decedent of the phoenix…The Blue Phoenix!\" Ye Chen gasped. He had never expected that he would be able to see one of these inside these mountains, since the Blue Phoenix was not a normal beast. Judging by its power, it might be even more powerful than Sun Xiaojin from the water ape race. It was at the top of the top rank within beast race, even equal to the nine-headed snake. It meant that once it reached maturity, it would be at least a top rank 10 beast. Its possibility of reaching the beast king level was extremely high as well.</p><p>Plus, the higher the ranking, the more the battling power it had. With Blue Phoenix's ranking, it would be able to reach beyond any beast at the same rank, including Sun Xiaojin.</p><p>It was a famous beast even in the ancient era.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>The Blue Phoenix waved its wings, jumping at Ye Chen while its wings had burning blue flames on them.</p><p>Ye Chen was slightly shocked, since this Blue Phoenix in front of him was at rank 9. He did not know why it was running toward him like that.</p><p>\"Are you Ye Chen?\"</p><p>When it was ten meters away from Ye Chen, the Blue Phoenix stopped moving forward and a human voice was heard; it was a female.</p><p>\"Indeed!\"</p><p>Ye Chen was quite curious. It was not about the beast speaking human language, since he had already seen quite a lot, such as the water apes who looked rather similar to the humankind.</p><p>\"I am the head disciple of the leader, Yan Fengfeng. Nice to meet you!\" The Blue Phoenix said.</p><p>\"Sister Yan.\" Ye Chen greeted with both of his hand held into a fist in front of his chest.</p><p>\"Hehe, follow me! My teacher is waiting for you.\"</p><p>Its tail waved once and then Yan Fengfeng turned around and waved her wings. Her speed was fast like lightning.</p><p>\"Such a fast speed!\"</p><p>Ye Chen had pushed his speed to ninety percent before he could finally catch up with that bird. Seeing that it was looking rather relaxed, he knew that the \"bird\" had only used less than half of its power.</p><p>Yan Fengfeng wanted to test Ye Chen's speed, so her blue wings vibrated once slightly before shooting out again at a faster speed. She was traveling so fast that her body could no longer be seen.</p><p>\"Sword Light Flying Spell!\"</p><p>Ye Chen knew that he had to push more. A sharp sword light shot out of his body; it flashed once before shooting out with his body wrapped in it, following right behind Yan Fengfeng.</p><p>\"You have quite a decent speed. It is only slightly more than my half.\" Yan Fengfeng said.</p><p>\"What!\"</p><p>Ye Chen was completely shocked. Right then, he had used his fastest movement art, the sword light flying art. His speed had reached no less than twenty times the speed of sound. But, she still said that it was less than half of her speed.</p><p>She chuckled, \"No need to be surprised. Amongst the young generation here, perhaps I am not even the most powerful one here. But speaking of speed, if I say I should be ranked second, no one would dare to say they are the first. You are only at peak level Early Sea of Souls Realm, but you already have the speed of a master level warrior. It is very impressive.\"</p><p>'I guess I will have to perfect my sword light flying art.'</p><p>Even if she had said so, Ye Chen was still full of thoughts. Having a speed that was twice the current him…it was an almost unimaginable concept. It was almost like being born as a king warrior. Right now, no one under the Life and Death Realm would be able to catch up with Yan Fengfeng. As for his sword light flying art, he could tell that it was a bit outdated now. When he was at Astral Reaching Realm, its speed was almost as fast as his attacking speed. But once he reached the Sea of Souls Realm, its speed stayed the same, and it was not that fast anymore.</p><p>Soon, Ye Chen had followed Yan Fengfeng and arrived at the Mysterious Fantasy Mountain.</p><p>\"You have arrived!\"</p><p>The voice of Mysterious Queen was heard. Meanwhile, a pulling power covered Yan Fengfeng and him, allowing them to appear immediately on top of the floating mountain.</p><p>\"Senior Yan!\"</p><p>\"Teacher.\"</p><p>Mysterious Queen nodded as she looked over at Ye Chen and said, \"Although you are not my disciple, the old Dragon King and I both already treat you as one. So, it is not that restricted.\"</p><p>\"Thank you, Senior Yan, for your appreciation of me.\"</p><p>\"Fengfeng, this is Ye Chen's first time here in the Sky Martial Region, and there are a lot of rules that he still doesn't know. You take him to the Sky Martial Pavilion and help him leave his name there.\"</p><p>\"Yes! Understood!\" Mei Fengfeng nodded, and the feather crown on her head started to spin.</p><p>Sky Martial Pavilion?</p><p>Ye Chen indeed could not remember the rules of the region anymore, since there were just way too much information in the Battle Emperor's life. Therefore, all he had was only a part of his memory.</p><p>\"Also, there are a couple of disciples from the school who need to leave their names there as well. I think I will leave them all to you.\"</p><p>She really appreciated Yan Fengfeng, whom she regarded as almost half a daughter now. When she first came to the Phoenix Cry Mountain, she had not decided to set her school here yet. Only until she had found a Blue Phoenix egg in the deep end of a mountain under the mountain groups in this area had she made up her mind. By using the secret art to incubate the egg, she managed to have Yan Fengfeng.</p><p>\"Teacher, my shapeshifting pellet is about to run out!\" Yan Fengfeng looked at Mysterious Queen with a sad look. The latter smiled, then took out a jade bottle and threw it to her, \"Use it wisely. It is not easy to make these.\"</p><p>\"Thank you, teacher!\"</p><p>Yan Fengfeng waved her tails and opened her mouth to take the jade bottle, then opened the lid. She placed a pellet into her mouth before swallowing it.</p><p>Whoo!</p><p>In the next moment, a blue light shone brightly like the sun.</p><p>Once it disappeared, the Blue Phoenix was already long gone, and only a beautiful lady in blue robes was standing there. She had a slim body, and beautifully shaped features. An elegant aura was present between her eyebrows, along with a feather crown pattern.</p><p>\"Brother Ye, it's nice to officially meet you.\" Yan Fengfeng in human shape revealed a smile.</p><p>\"Sister Yan, nice to meet you.\" Ye Chen laughed. It was indeed the first time for them to meet each other.</p><p>\"Alright, you guys can go rest now. We will leave tomorrow first thing in the morning.\" Mysterious Queen said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
