During this period, they had a great time together, constantly sharing great techniques of martial arts since the four of them were all rare martial geniuses. So, perhaps one enlightenment and one slight change could help them in the long term. While they were chatting, they could feel some blockages being smoothed out and unblocked.</p><p>After one day, the three left the school.</p><p>\"From now on, we will be on our way.\"</p><p>On a nameless peak, Ye Chen stood there gazing into the distance. As for Li Xiaoyun and Jing Aoxuan, they both had their things to take care of as well, so they had left earlier on.</p><p>\"The ingredients for the Shadowless Poison antidote will not be that easy to find. I will first go check it out at some crowded place.\"</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>Ye Chen turned into a beam of light and shot out toward the closest city.</p><p>…</p><p>East Royal City was one of the top ten cities in this world, with the most powerful power party there being the Gu family. Although they were not one of the top four families, the Gu family in the past was indeed the number one family in the whole world, because they had an Emperor King warrior, the East King. Right now, they were not as powerful as before anymore, but were still one of the top parties in the city.</p><p>The city was very huge, more than double the size of Thunder city. It would take a normal person a couple of days to walk from the east city gate to the west. Although warriors above Condensing Reality Realm warriors could almost fly in the sky, no one would dare to fly in the sky of the East Royal City, since there was actually a law forbidding it. It would be great disrespect on the part of anyone who dared to break the rule. The lucky ones perhaps would be held in prison for couple of days, while the unlucky ones would actually be killed in public.</p><p>In the west part of the city was an unnoticeable seven-floored pavilion. It had a very plain appearance, with only a board carrying its name, \"Unsought Truth\" on it in silver paint.</p><p>It was a place for gaining information, each floor having its own price. The first floor was for common information, and the second would offer some valuable ones; from the third floor upward, it was not a public place anymore, since any piece of news could cost a normal Clasping Yuan Realm warrior's whole life's fortune.</p><p>This place had a very powerful background, such that even the Gu family in the East Royal City would not mess around with them if not necessary. Even they would have to pay and go through the front door when they needed some information; there would be no special cases.</p><p>So, to some degree, this place had a very high status.</p><p>On the first floor, a cold-looking but extremely beautiful lady was sitting on the chair behind the counter, reading with her full focus.</p><p>At that moment, a group of people walked in.</p><p>The leading man was not that good-looking, but he was very tall and bulky. So when he walked, he looked kind of like a tiger, albeit a chubby one. However, once stared at by him, one could feel one's heart skip a beat.</p><p>It was a direct disciple of the Gu family, named Gu Ping. He was one of the rare martial geniuses of the Gu family who had reached the Sea of Souls Realm when he was thirty-two. After accumulating two years of experience, his battling power was even more powerful than the older Sea of Souls Realm warriors, his reputation able to reach over the other top warriors inside the East Royal City.</p><p>\"Miss Ye Ying, it has been a long time!\" Gu Ping walked over to the counter and spoke to the beautiful lady with a smile.</p><p>The lady looked up from her book and said coldly, \"Mr. Ping, we had just seen each other last month. What do you want to know today?\"</p><p>\"Shadowless Demon!\" Gu Ping only said those two words.</p><p>\"Sixth floor!\"</p><p>A shocked expression flashed by the lady's face once, but it disappeared soon as she answered calmly.</p><p>\"Alright! After I come back this time, I wonder if Miss Ye Ying has the time to have dinner with me?\" Before he walked up the floor, Gu Qung turned his head to smile at her; he was obviously interested in her.</p><p>\"Nope!\"</p><p>After she said that, that lady went back to read her book.</p><p>\"But, I believe you are interested.\" A slightly displeased expression flashed past his eyes, then Gu Ping asked the others to stay at the bottom as he walked up to the sixth floor.</p><p>\"Is this the 'Unsought Truth pavilion'?\"</p><p>Ye Chen scanned the surroundings and noticed the pavilion which was rather not that conspicuous, then started walking toward it.</p><p>\"Move to the side!\"</p><p>On the first floor was a group of people blocking the way. If Ye Chen wanted to enter, he would have to crawl from the side. But obviously, it would not be his style.</p><p>After Ye Chen said that, no one spoke or moved to the side. It was as if he was invisible.</p><p>He frowned and activated his Zhen yuan, using his power briefly. With that, the group of people was blown to the ground on the side, making a 'generous way' for him.</p><p>\"Brat! You are looking for death!\"</p><p>\"You dare to do this inside the East Royal City! You are not far away from death.\"</p><p>These people were all at Sea of Souls Realm. However, this pavilion was not simple either, as there was a forbidden restraining power covering the whole place. That shake from Ye Chen's Zhen yuan power did not even move the pavilion at all. But of course, with his pure Zhen yuan and powerful sword intent, blowing a group of normal Sea of Souls Realm warriors could not be easier.</p><p>The lady lifted up her head and said lightly, \"No loud noises in the pavilion. You all go outside.\"</p><p>\"Miss Ye Ying, we are from the Gu family.\"</p><p>These people were used to having their way, so they reminded the cold-looking lady.</p><p>\"Get out!\"</p><p>She waved her hand. Although she did not use her Zhen yuan, that forbidden power of the pavilion was under her control, which blew all the people away, leaving only Ye Chen where he was standing.</p><p>\"What do you want to know about?\"</p><p>As if she had just done a minor daily chore, she asked.</p><p>Ye Chen said, \"About the Shadowless Plant and the Rootless Flower.\"</p><p>Actually, in order to make the antidote for the Shadowless Poison, a lot of ingredients were needed. He needed more than just the Shadowless Plant and Rootless Flower he had mentioned, but Ye Chen was afraid that if he said too much, he might cause some unnecessary trouble. Also, he would have to take it step by step anyway.</p><p>\"Oh?\" A strange expression flashed past her face, \"Do you know the rules of the pavilion?\"</p><p>\"Yes, news on the fourth floor would be starting from ten thousand low rank spirit stones, five thousand top rank spirit stones for the fifth level, and thirty thousand for the sixth level.\"</p><p>The Shadowless Plant and the Rootless Flower were extremely rare, so their information wouldn't be available under the fourth floor.</p><p>While nodding, the lady said, \"Since you know it, then I believe you do have what it takes to get it. What you need would be on the sixth floor.\"</p><p>\"Thank you!\"</p><p>Holding his fist together, Ye Chen started to walk upstairs.</p><p>On the street, that group of Seas of Souls Realm warriors from the Gu family were furious as they stared at that lady with wrath in their eyes.</p><p>\"Who does she think she is? She is just an executive of the pavilion. If it were not for the fact that she was inside the pavilion, I could crush her with one hand.\"</p><p>The whole pavilion had been covered by a wave of invisible, shapeless power. As one of the executives of the pavilion, she could control the forbidden power and attack whoever tried to enter the pavilion by force. It was also why no one would try to mess with the pavilion; the forbidden power was just too powerful.</p><p>\"Huh! This whole existence of the pavilion has affected our Gu family's reputation. If it were not for their powerful background. Our Gu family would have taken it off the ground already.\"</p><p>…</p><p>The sound of footsteps ceased as Ye Chen entered the sixth floor.</p><p>\"I wonder what kind of information you would like to know?\" In front of the staircase was a counter. The man behind the counter said lightly.</p><p>Ye Chen said, \"Medicinal plant!\"</p><p>\"Inside room No. 3.\"</p><p>The middle-aged man pointed at the room No.3.</p><p>Going to the door, Ye Chen pushed to walk in.</p><p>There was only one table and two chairs inside the not-so-big room. However, because of the fact that there were not many furniture pieces, it was not that crowded. On the contrast, it gave people the feeling of being safe.</p><p>\"What kind of medicinal plant?\"</p><p>A voice was heard out of nowhere. Ye Chen turned his head to observe the surroundings, but did not manage to see anything. He knew the it was just a trick of the pavilion, so he answered, \"Shadowless Plant, Rootless Flower.\"</p><p>\"I know something about this…I will go!\"</p><p>A voice was heard again. Then, the wall inside the room No. 3 opened, and a common looking elder entered.</p><p>\"News on the Shadowless Plant, forty thousand top rank spirit stones.\"</p><p>\"News on the Rootless Flower, fifty thousand top rank spirit stones.\"</p><p>\"Do you want both?\" The elder asked.</p><p>\"Yes.\" Ye Chen nodded.</p><p>\"There are three pieces of information on the Shadowless Plant. The first is from fifty years ago, according to someone who heard about it inside the Lost Soul Valley. The second one is from nineteen years ago inside the Star Regional Lake. Someone had seen something on a creepy looking island. The third news is from a year ago. Inside an underground crack fifty-five thousand miles away in the northwest direction, someone also saw it there. I will give you one extra piece of news…Inside the underground crack would be an evil entity called the Shadowless Demon appearing there. It is good at robbing the lives of people, capable of mobbing shadowlessly and shapelessly. Astral Reaching Realm warriors would definitely be killed, and even Sea of Souls Realm warriors would have a great chance of being wounded.\"</p><p>\"There was only one news on the Rootless Flower, also from the underground crack. However, it is from the deepest part of the crack. If you run into the shining light, you might be able to see it.\"</p><p>\"Alright, please pay ninety thousand top rank spirit stones.\"</p><p>Ye Chen took out nine huge boxes of top rank spirit stones as he thought to himself, 'How easy it is to make money here in the pavilion, easily making ninety thousand top rank spirit stones with simply talking. Ninety thousand top rank spirit stones would be pretty much what a normal Sea of Souls Realm warrior's total fortune would amount to.'</p><p>But of course, it was reasonable after all, since information was something that was worth nothing and everything. Moreover, the person who owned the news had also spent a lot of time in obtaining it; it would be impossible to obtain it for free.</p><p>Walking out of the room No. 3, Ye Chen saw the door of Room No. 9 open as well, a tall teenager in his twenties walking out of it. The two exchanged a look before looking away, walking toward the staircase one after the other.</p><p>'This guy carries such powerful sword qi! He is definitely a great martial genius!' Gu Ping, who was walking in front, had an evil smile on his face.</p><p>'This guy has an evil soul. I wonder what kind of evil martial arts he has trained.' Ye Chen had already sensed something.</p><p>After arriving at the first floor, Gu Ping started chasing the lady while Ye Chen left the pavilion immediately. As for those Seas of Souls Realm warriors outside, they seemed to be waiting for someone, so they did not look for more trouble with him. Only one of them secretly blew a little of some shapeless, colourless powder that glued to Ye Chen's clothes.</p><p>Meanwhile, inside another similar pavilion in Thunder City, a man in black robes walked in.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
