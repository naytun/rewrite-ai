Right next to them was also an exclusively-raised Iron Feather Mysterious Eagle.</p><p>Ye Chen had seen two of the three disciples; they were the head disciple of the Mysterious Martial School, Yan Fengfeng, and the other was the third disciple, Miao Yin. The third person was a male disciple with a skin looking like jade. He did not look a day older than twenty-five, which would make him the youngest amongst them all. As for his real age, it would be impossible to know without asking.</p><p>\"Head sister, what is going on with this Ye Chen? How come our teacher appreciates him that much, even wanting you to guide him to the Sky Martial Pavilion yourself?\" The male disciple was named Ling Tianhao, and was the fourth disciple of the school. He was actually twenty-seven years old. But of course, if he were able to reach the peak level Early Sea of Souls Realm at that age, it would already be the kind of power that the Sky Martial Region could not underestimate. If it were in the other top four regions, he would be one of the top warriors in the young generation already; and even if it were the Mysterious Martial School, it was something special nevertheless.</p><p>Yan Fengfeng laughed, \"Disicple Ling, do not underestimate him. He is the newly-raised young king warrior from the Southern regions. His power can shine over anyone from the same generation, perhaps even going way beyond.\"</p><p>\"A young king warrior from the Southern region should not be that big of a deal, right?\"</p><p>It was not that Ling Tianhao did not think highly of Ye Chen. But in his eyes, the young king warriors from the Southern regions were indeed not that impressive, especially in the Sky Martial Region.</p><p>\"He reached the Seas of Souls Realm at the age of twenty-four!\"</p><p>But, after hearing what Yan Fengfeng had said next, Ling Tiaohao's expression changed drastically. Everyone knew that their leader, which was the Mysterious Queen, had reached Sea of Souls Realm when she was twenty five. It had been the record for the past one thousand years, and no one could break it for decades. Even if those two top warriors who could almost compete with their leader from the Sky Martial Region had all only entered the realm at the age of twenty five; so, they had also not broken Mysterious Queen's record. He had never expected to see a martial genius from the Southern region come out with this kind of power and talent. At some level, some parts of his belief had been shattered.</p><p>\"No way!\" His first reaction was denial.</p><p>Yan Fengfeng took a deep breath, \"When leader told me about it, I did not believe it at all either. But, leader has always kept her word, and has never lied. Why would she lie about it now?\"</p><p>After learning that it was actually coming from the leader, he was stuck in between shock and denial. Eventually, he slowly let out a breath, \"His training skill is indeed powerful. Perhaps it is his only specialty.\"</p><p>\"Perhaps not.\" Yan Fengfeng looked at a black dot in the sky, \"His speed has also reached the master level.\"</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>The black dot expanded rapidly; it was Ye Chen in his blue robes.</p><p>\"Sorry for coming so late.\" He held his fist to greet the three as he landed onto the peak of the mountain.</p><p>\"We had just made it here as well. Let me introduce them to you. This is my third sister disciple, Miao Yin, and this is my fourth brother disciple Ling Tianhao.\" Yan Fengfeng explained.</p><p>\"I have already met sister Miao Yin, but it is my first time meeting brother Ling Tianhao.\"</p><p>All three of them were older than him, so it was not awkward to address them as older sisters and brother.</p><p>After knowing that Ye Chen's potential was even greater than Mysterious Queen back when she was young, Ling Tianhao could not underestimate him anymore. Regardless, training talent was also a part of the potential for the future, and the most direct tool to get to higher levels. Without it, no matter how powerful the other talents were, it would be useless.</p><p>\"Let's go!\"</p><p>Miao Yin looked rather calm. She seemed even more mature in comparison to Yan Fengfeng.</p><p>…</p><p>Over in the sky, the Iron Feather Mysterious Eagle carried the four and traveled at an extreme speed, almost reaching fifteen times the speed of sound.</p><p>The eagle beast was a rank 9 beast that was famous for its speed. Flying at full speed, it could reach about eighteen times the speed of sound, which was already master level. But of course, there was a disguised difference between traveling for long haul or short trips. It could not always travel at the extreme speed, since once it got overly exhausted, it would need way more time to rest.</p><p>After all, it was not a flying puppet. Judging on its efficiency in the long haul, it worked similar to Ye Chen's flying puppet. One of them was faster, while the other did not need to rest.</p><p>\"The Sky Martial Pavilion is in the south of the region. It is normally referred to as the South Sky Door. According to the myths, the Sky Martial Pavilion had something to do with the Treasury Holy Tower. People who are older than forty would not be allowed to enter, as well as people who have not reached Sea of Souls Realm. In the middle of the Sky Martial Pavilion is an interesting wall that allows you to leave one thousand names, which would not be gone for at least ten years.\"</p><p>On the back of the flying beast, Yan Fengfeng explained to Ye Chen about the pavilion.</p><p>\"Is it necessary to leave a name inside the pavilion?\" Ye Chen asked.</p><p>She laughed, \"Have you ever heard about the saying 'not entering the south sky door, not entering the sky martial region'? The reason that this sky martial region is called the holy place for martial geniuses is mostly because of the Sky Martial Pavilion.\"</p><p>Hearing her, Ye Chen laughed in a slightly off way. So, according to her logic, only young warriors who had reached the Sea of Souls Realm warriors could go into the pavilion and would be counted as \"truly\" having come to the Sky Martial Region? As for those who had not managed to reach the realm yet, would it be a pure waste of time? So, for the East Demon Xie Zhiqiu to have managed to be famous in the Sky Martial Region would only be amongst the young generation then.</p><p>Ye Chen had guessed right. Xie Zhiqiu had only managed to get a little bit famous within the young generation, but counting the rest of the top warriors, he would be nothing.</p><p>\"It should be quite hard to leave a name on that wall then, right?\"</p><p>\"Of course! Although it would not mean that you would be in the ranking, its value would be pretty much the same. Including all of the top warriors within the past ten years, perhaps some of the top warriors in the other regions would not even be able to rank in the top one thousand after all.</p><p>Freezing for a bit, Yan Fengfeng looked at Miao Yin and Ling Tianhao, then said, \"Therefore, a lot of the martial geniuses would have to stabilise their power first and make sure that they were at their peak before trying out the Sky Martial Pavilion. Otherwise, it would be rather embarrassing.\"</p><p>Ye Chen thought about it and agreed with her. Right after reaching the Sea of Souls Realm was when the power was at a low actually; trying to reach the peak level Early Sea of Souls realm would be the hardest thing to do. Also, once one reached the Sea of Souls Realm, the warrior's comprehensive ability would improve again. Therefore, improving profound martial arts would be just as important as well.</p><p>Right then, Ling Tiaohao said, \"The name wall is also a place where you can judge your power. Being able to be ranked in the top one thousand is already quite hard. Being able to reach in the top one hundred would be even harder. Once one has made it, then all of the Sky Martial Region would know your name. As for the top ten, those places are reserved for truly mad martial geniuses. With bother Ye's potential now, you should be easily able to rank in the top one hundred.\"</p><p>Actually, Ling Tianhao was still a bit sceptical about Ye Chen's power, since although the training potential was rather important, but so were the other parts. There had been martial geniuses who had great training potential, but they were all very mediocre in the other aspects.</p><p>Ye Chen smiled once without saying anything.</p><p>During the long distance until the pavilion, the four continued chatting on and off about this and that. Ye Chen had learned that two disciples of the Mysterious Martial School had made it into the top one thousand. They were the head disciple Yan Fengfeng, and the second disciple Fu Yanhong. Yan Fengfeng had been ranked extremely high up in the rank: she was ranked fifth. Fu Yanhong was way weaker, ranked fifty-seven. But of course, it was relative to Yan Fengfeng. It was an extreme honor to be able to have their names on the wall amongst the other top warriors. And, the fact that it would stay at least ten years would be something amazing as well.</p><p>Iron Feather Mysterious Eagle was indeed a rank 9 beast with a tremendous speed. After seven days, the four had arrived in the south of the Sky Martial Region from the west, crossing six million miles.</p><p>In the afternoon on the seventh day, a sky-reaching mountain appeared before the four's eyes. It was a massive mountain with a sharp peak like a sword. But, the peak seemed to have been cut off, which made it look extremely uneven. On top of the peak was a majestic looking building, with the name \"Sky Martial Pavilion\" written on top.</p><p>\"We are here. There seem to be quite a lot of people here. Some of them also look familiar.\" Yan Fengfeng could see very well. From dozen miles away, she was able to see everyone's faces and recognize them.</p><p>After seeing the pavilion, Ling Tianhao seemed to be breathing heavier than before. It was obvious that he was excited. Even Miao Yin, who was extremely calm the whole way there, started to get passionate as well.</p><p>Only Yan Fengfeng and Ye Chen seemed just the same; the former had been here before already, and she was only here this time to bring the other three there. Hence, she was not involved at all. Meanwhile, the latter was just completely attracted to the aura of the pavilion. In his eyes, the mountain with the pavilion on top looked just like a godly sword that had punctured through the sky. It gave him a shockingly powerful sword-qi-like aura that made his soul chilled.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>The flying beast crawled into the clouds and reached toward the pavilion.</p><p>\"The Iron Feather Mysterious Eagle! People from the Mysterious Martial School!\"</p><p>\"It should be Phoenix Master Yan Fengfeng bringing her disciples to the pavilion to leave their names on the wall.\" Someone on the mountain had noticed and recognised the flying beast, as well as Yan Fengfeng.</p><p>Instead of flying to the pavilion directly, Yan Fengfeng guided the beast to land on an empty ground under the mountain.</p><p>\"Yan Fengfeng, long time no see!\" A bald teenager with a vibrant aura walked over with his sibling disciples.</p><p>Yan Fengfeng laughed, \"Hai Wuya, you also came here with your sibling disciples to leave their names?\"</p><p>\"Indeed!\"</p><p>The teenager named Hai Wuya glanced at Ye Chen and the other two, \"Your Mysterious Martial School already had two disciples having their names on the wall, right? So soon with another three?\"</p><p>\"Hehe, yeah! My sibling disciples did not disappoint.\" Yan Fengfeng continued to have that sweet smile on her face.</p><p>\"I will go now actually…Quite a lot of people are here already.\" Hai Wuya left with the people that came with him, with Ling Tianhao staring at his back.</p><p>\"This guy is Hai Wuya?\"</p><p>Yan Fengfeng said, \"Yeah, he is actually extremely powerful! He was not that weaker than me, ranked ten on the wall right now. Oh right! Perhaps you guys still do not know much about the method to actually leave your name on the wall. It is actually a magic wall. When it is your turn. All you have to do is to pour in your soul power, and then you will be able to form a consciousness inside the wall. It can represent thirty percent of your power, and your opponent would have the same as well. After beating one consciousness, you will be able to reach the next round. In the next round, the power of your consciousness would be increased by two times. It goes on in that pattern. Remember, do not push too hard and challenge your limit. After all, once your consciousness is wounded, it would make your subconsciousness think that you had actually been wounded, and it would damage your real body. The more damage to your consciousness, the more damage will there be to your body. There has been a history of the greatest warriors dying because of it.\"</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
