This trip to the Phoenix Cry Mountain in the Sky Martial Region would require covering seven million miles of distance. Even with the flying puppet without rest, it would still take dozens of days. If it were before, it would be nothing for him; but now, even one extra day would mean more danger for Su Ruhui.</p><p>Over the clouds, a crane shaped flying puppet shot out into the distance. It would travel seven miles with each breath's worth of time, dragging a straight qi flow with its tail.</p><p>Sitting on the back of the flying puppet, Ye Chen did not have the mood nor time to enjoy the scenery as he focused solely on his training.</p><p>During the past battle with Yuwen Lie, he had felt an extreme pressure. But, indeed because of this pressure, he managed to make a breakthrough in terms of his mental qi; it became sharper like the sword. He had suddenly managed to understand the essence of the gold profound, which allowed him to train his Gold Resonant Radiance from ninety percent to completion.</p><p>The completely trained Gold Resonant Radiance Attack was no weaker than the Void Shattering Finger Attack. If performed with the Thunder Disaster Sword, its power might even be more than the latter, and it would become his number one attack. But, if he revealed his top attack, then it would be showcasing his true power to everyone.</p><p>That kind of a situation would be extremely dangerous for Ye Chen. If someone sent a spy and learned about his true power before sending out a perfect assassin for him, then he might end up being killed for sure.</p><p>Therefore, although reaching completion was a good thing for him, he could not rest just yet; stopping once would be a sign of failing soon. If he was lucky, then he might be able to reverse the situation when it actually happened. But, if he did not have any luck, then it would be the end of him, becoming another fallen star.</p><p>\"I will not be able to improve my Void Shattering Finger Art within a short period of time. The difficulty of upgrading from the space mentality to the space profound has already been harder than I had expected. I am afraid that it would not be as easy as training my Gold Resonant Radiance to completion. But, if I am able to enter the deep end of the surreal space and take a look from a close distance, then it would be something else.\"</p><p>\"The Amaranthine Nature Attack is the next level profound sword attack of the Green Lotus Sword Art, and its power is also just as strong. With one sword attack, it will be able to increase its speed again in midair, making its actual speed reach beyond human comprehension and leaving the opponents with no time to react.\"</p><p>\"However, this attack still has quite a bit of flaws, which makes it not as powerful. It would be slightly lacking as an ace attack. Besides the Gold Resonant Radiance Attack, there is only the Sky Thunder Cut and the Reverse Sky Thunder Cut that could be used as top attacks. Combining the two could even increase their power. With seventy percent comprehension, the two combined could reach ninety percent of the Gold Resonant Radiance Attack. If I comprehend them by eighty percent, it might even be more powerful than the completed Gold Resonant Radiance Attack, and become the new number one attack.\"</p><p>Ye Chen thought about all of the sword arts that he had learned and then made a decision that he would focus on his Sky Thunder Cut and Reverse Sky Thunder Cut with all of his power. Of course, it did not mean that he would give up on the other ones.</p><p>\"I have personally designed this Sky Thunder Cut, so it might be a bit harder to learn more. There does not seem to be a clear path for me to travel on, so I will have to figure it all out myself. But, these two attacks have enough of potential, which will be worthy of my full attention. Let's see what I can learn more about these in the next dozens of days.\"</p><p>Without noticing, Ye Chen had already left the city.</p><p>\"Hehe, it will be time for us to do it now!\"</p><p>A hundred miles away from the flying puppet, a black human figure increased its speed suddenly fromÂ ten, all the way to twenty times the speed of sound. The sudden change in speed had exceeded the pressure limit of the air, and it suddenly exploded around the warrior's body while qi flow spread around in all directions.</p><p>Eighty miles!</p><p>Fifty miles!</p><p>Ten!</p><p>\"Brat, stop now!\"</p><p>Within ten miles, the black figure that was wrapped within a beam of light reached out a hand that turned into a fist and attacked toward where Ye Chen was standing.</p><p>\"Retrieve!\"</p><p>Without looking back, Ye Chen jumped up into the sky. The flying puppet below him turned into a beam of vague shadow and shot out into the distance. The next second, the space shook, leaving a blurred out fist print in the air. It was looking brutal, as if it had been imprinted into the surreal space.</p><p>Turning around, Ye Chen looked over at that incoming black shadow and said sarcastically, \"It must have been hard for you to wait this long.\"</p><p>\"You know about me?\"</p><p>The newcomer had a black face mask, which had an effect of blocking out soul power detection. But right then, the warrior sounded a bit surprised.</p><p>\"I have guessed it.\"</p><p>A light hint of silver light appeared in Ye Chen's eyes as that invisible soul power filtered through the mask. He was able to see who the man was.</p><p>\"Indeed, it is a master level Seas of Souls Realm warrior who came to the Yuwen family to congratulate on the marriage. He seems to be called Tyrant Fist Master. A loner, I see...No martial school or anything like that. He seems to have come here only a few years ago, but is a great friend of Yuwen Jin. This guy is great at fist arts then.\"</p><p>There were seven master level warriors at the Yuwen family the other day: One from the Gu Lan Party, three from other martial institutions, Yao Yifeng, and Murong Zhishui. And then there was this Tyrant Fist Master. Besides Yao Yifeng and Murong Zhishui, Ye Chen had some information on the other five.</p><p>\"You have guessed it right! But, there is no prize for that, I am afraid.\"</p><p>The eyes of Tyrant Fist Master that was exposed in the plain air had a blade like cold killing qi leaking out. Ye Chen's power now was at Yuwen Lie's level. He was only slightly more powerful with his half-step extreme rank sword. However, this newcomer was just as powerful as Yuwen Jin, and that fist art of his was even more powerful. It was known for its power to break through protective Zhen yuan. Therefore, in the warrior's eyes, Ye Chen was already a dead man walking. After killing him, whatever Ye Chen had would be his.</p><p>\"It is alright, but there should be a gift for you. Otherwise what a waste of a trip for you to come here!\" Ye Chen looked calm.</p><p>\"You are looking for death!\" The warrior yelled once before shooting out and reaching out his fist.</p><p>It was an extremely simple attack, without any fancy tricks. But, in the Tyrant Fist Master's hand, it was no longer normal. Its tyrant-like aggressive fist power filled up the whole cloud ocean without any restraint.</p><p>Ye Chen looked sharp. The air around him had been covered in that aggressive fist aura already and started to become sticky, almost freezing the whole surreal space within.</p><p>\"Void Shattering Finger Attack!\"</p><p>Ye Chen pointed his finger out; wherever the blue finger reached, the sticky air disappeared away like melting snow in spring.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The blue finger attack clashed with the aggressive fist shadow and the space patterns spread out. It messed up the space around so bad that even soul power would be affected.</p><p>\"Yellow Dragon Sealing Power!\"</p><p>Throwing out a finger attack, Ye Chen suddenly took out a yellow light ball which floated in front of his chest as he formed the spell with both of his hands smoothly. As he did so, there was dark yellow flowy light moving within the yellow light ball like a mad dragon hiding before the fatal attack.</p><p>Whoo!</p><p>The yellow light ball shook once and a yellow dragon shadow broke out of the ball. Somehow, it managed to ignore the messy qi flow between the two and jumped above the head of the Tyrant Fist Master. Its tail reached down while its head pointed upwards, looking majestic.</p><p>\"Ah! Yellow Dragon Sealing Art!\"</p><p>The warrior was already a hundred meters away from Ye Chen when he saw that incoming yellow dragon shadow. His face was filled with fear and shock as if he had just seen a ghost.</p><p>\"Seal!\"</p><p>Without leaving any chance for him, Ye Chen finished the formation of the spell. Dozens of light spots appeared on the dragon shadow's body and it suddenly shrank down, ignoring the protective Zhen yuan layer of the Tyrant Fist Master and disappearing within his body. The whole process happened within a split second.</p><p>\"No! My Zhen yuan!\"</p><p>Tyrant Fist Master did not think about it at all that Ye Chen would be able to learn how to do that within one night, and that he even managed to get his hands on the dragon ball. If he had known it before this whole trip, he would not have dared to come to kill Ye Chen at all. Even if it were an assassination, he would keep the maximum distance between him and Ye Chen, giving the latter zero chance to lock onto him. This Yellow Dragon Sealing Spell was an exclusive Dragon God Heaven Palace martial art. It would normally not be given out to anyone at all, which was also a reason why they were famous for their power and no one would dare to fight against them.</p><p>\"Ye Chen, give me a chance and I will leave immediately! I will never fight against you in my life. I am a man of my word! I will never act against my promises!\" In that extreme fear, Tyrant Fist Master had even exposed his own identity, but it did not matter at all anymore, since there was nothing more important than staying alive.</p><p>Ye Chen sneered, \"If it were you who had captured me, would you let me go?\"</p><p>\"As long as you let go of the Yellow Dragon Sealing Spell, I will be your servant! A master level warrior as your servant is something that no other martial geniuses have.\"</p><p>Although he sounded very sincere, in the deep part of his soul, there was only killing intent rumbling about. He could not stand the fact that a certain thing had somehow turned on him, making him the begging prisoner.</p><p>\"Alright! I will let go of you now.\"</p><p>Stepping on the surreal space, Ye Chen walked over step by step.</p><p>\"No!\"</p><p>It would be impossible for the warrior to not sense Ye Chen's killing intent. He pushed out all of his remaining Zhen yuan residues to escape for his life.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>Ye Chen caught up with him after only half of a step and his gold sword went through the warrior's skull.</p><p>\"Noooo! Not like this!\" Before his life slipped out of his body, the warrior mumbled out with shock written on his face. Taking away the warrior's storage ring, Ye Chen threw out a fist attack, destroying the body of the Tyrant Fist Master completely.</p><p>\"It is indeed powerful!\" Ye Chen examined the yellow light ball in his hand that was dimmed now, and was very surprised. The Yellow Dragon Sealing Spell was taught to him by Zhang Zhengguang. Of course, it was under the Dragon King's order.</p><p>As the exclusive secret spell, it was actually not that hard to learn, since there was no secret to it at all. It was only using soul power and Zhen yuan to release the restraining power within the dragon balls and giving it a slight guidance.</p><p>But, learning the spell did not mean guaranteed success rate of using it, since it would just be impossible to do so without the actual dragon balls, which were also handed to him from the Dragon King. According to Zhang Zhenggunag, there were not more than ten people carrying these dragon balls within the whole palace. The fact that he was given some represented his importance to the Dragon King, since even amongst the five palace leaders, they did not all have one.</p><p>As for whether the dragon power was endless or not, in fact, one dragon ball could only be used once without additional supply. For example, Zhang Zhengguang had used one on Yao Yifeng, and that dragon ball would be temporarily useless right now. As for the supplying method, Ye Chen did not know about it yet.</p><p>There were a few points related to the Yellow Dragon Sealing Spell: first, the opponent would have to be within one hundred meters, and second, his soul power would have to reach beyond the opponent's, because the restraining power of the dragon ball depended on the user's soul power. The more powerful the user's soul power was, the more powerful would the restraining power be. Thirdly, as the spell was being used, it could not be interrupted; otherwise, the spell would reverse a bit, which would cause a catastrophic consequence. Therefore, it could only be used in a one-on-one situation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
