That not-so-big, dark fist filled up the sky, blocking away even the sunlight from above as it attacked right at Ye Chen's skull. If that fist attack arrived right at its target, no matter how powerful Ye Chen's defense was, he would be wounded badly.</p><p>Ye Chen looked cold. His gold sword vibrated at an extreme frequency as he welcomed the incoming attack with his sword.</p><p>Ye Chen's Gold Resonant Radiance Sword attack had been trained to ninety percent, and it could shake two thousand and eight hundred times within a second, which was close to three thousand. Once he reached that stage, his sword attack would reach full completion, and its power would be at the top profound martial art level.</p><p>The Gold Resonant Radiance was indeed a profound sword attack with an extreme attacking power. Normal profound sense martial arts would be nothing in front of it.</p><p>Whoo!</p><p>When the fist and the sword art clashed together, the sound wave that exploded out was extremely horrifying, as if the whole land had drowned in it. Because of the extremely loud sound, everyone felt like they could not actually hear anything anymore.</p><p>At the center of the battle, the dark colored and the gold colored light balls had devoured the two within before expanding to hundreds of meters. The air formed into a qi ball before being pushed away. A thousand-meters-wide vacuum sphere was generated, and the two lights appeared in it together. Still, right in the center, Ye Chen and Yuwen Ye were still maintaining their old attacking position, their fist and sword still pressed together.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The two spherical qi piles exploded together, and all of the buildings inside the Yuwen family seemed about to break down at any second. All of the powerful warriors from the Yuwen family worked together to create a huge Zhen yuan barrier, preventing the blast wave to actually do some serious damage to the buildings.</p><p>As for above them, the surreal space had been pushed in, forming a semi-circular space.</p><p>An unbelievable amount of natural qi of wind, fire, thunder, and water had been leaking out, looking extremely colorful. And yet, it looked as if it was the end of the world.</p><p>In the next moment, the two separated; but just as Yuwen Ye had said, after he performed his special power, his endurance and attacking speed would be enhanced. After backing out for only dozens of meters, he had already managed to step in midair and shoot out toward where Ye Chen was standing.</p><p>\"I will see what else you have got!\"</p><p>Yuwen Ye was very clear that ace attacks could not be performed twice in a row. As Ye Chen had used his Gold Resonant Radiance Art, if he wanted to deploy it again, then he would have to wait for another moment while his fist would be landing on the latter in the next instant.</p><p>\"Double Sword Attack!\"</p><p>It would be impossible for Ye Chen not to know that fact. Indeed, each ace attack would need a bit of time to prepare. Normally, the more powerful the killing attack was, the longer the preparation time would be. Of course, if the warrior's cultivation was high enough, then it would not be a problem, since with higher power, the warrior would train more powerful killing attacks, so it would not take long to prepare. Right then, he was at peak level Early Sea of Souls Realm, and his Gold Resonant Radiance art was no weaker than Yuwen Ye's Killing Water Attack. Therefore, the preparation would take a bit longer than the others, and that amount of time, regardless of how short it was, would be the opponent's advantage. Therefore, he would not be able to perform his Gold Resonant Radiance Art again soon.</p><p>But, without the Gold Resonant Radiance Sword Attack, he still had the Sky Thunder Cut and the Reverse attack, as well as the combination of the two. The Double Sword Attack was just slightly weaker than the Gold Resonant Radiance Attack. More importantly, the double sword attack was two sword attacks combined, which both were slightly weaker than the Gold Resonant Radiance. So, the preparation time was short, and he had more than enough time to finish preparing for it before Yuwen Ye arrived.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>The sword light appeared from two opposite angles; they crossed together, arriving faster than Yuwen Ye's attack.</p><p>\"Huh?\"</p><p>Yuwen Ye's brows flicked, before smiling lightly and hitting his fist. He did not think it would be that powerful even if it were two attacks arriving at the same time.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Once the fist touched that crossed sword light, Yuwen Ye could sense that intense opposite power layered together. Because he was in such a hurry to beat Ye Chen, he did not even wait for his Killing Water Fist to fully prepare. On the contrary, he somehow ended up being in the inferior position during this exchange of attacks. Consequently, he was blown away while a massive hole appeared in his chest, bits of flesh rising in the air before disappearing.</p><p>\"How is this possible! With two sword attacks combined together, somehow it can have this amount of power!\"</p><p>Being able to perform two attacks at the same time would already be quite rare. In this whole land, there might not be that many people who would be able to do so. Inside the Sky Martial Region, Yuwen Ye had seen quite a lot of young warriors being able to do so, but they would rarely choose to do so, since it would be rather distracting. Moreover, the power with the combined attacks would not be as powerful anyway; otherwise, everyone would be trying to do so.</p><p>So, he had not expected that the double sword style attack would be this powerful at all; it was almost as powerful as the Gold Resonant Radiance Art attack he performed before.</p><p>On the other side, Ye Chen looked just the same. He knew the power of the double sword attack. Moreover, it was not a normal double sword attack, since he had personally designed the Sky Thunder Cut and Reverse Sky Thunder Cut, one positive while the other being negative. The two combined together worked perfectly; its power would not be something other ones could compare with.</p><p>With the two swords blowing Yuwen Ye away, Ye Chen flashed his body once, shooting at his opponent from a different angle. The latter was frightened and hurried to lift up his arms.</p><p>Chin!</p><p>That incoming attack landed on his left arm.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>'So tough!'</p><p>That attack of Ye Chen focused on its technique, so it might not be as powerful as the other ones. However, it contained the slaughter sword intent, and combined with the enhancement from the gold sword, the protective layer of Sea of Souls Realm warriors would not be able to handle it at all. Yet when it attacked Yuwen Ye's left arm, it was like hitting steel with wood; it was impossible to cut in. Of course, he also knew that his opponent's defensive layer had blocked out most of its power, so his attack did not manage to break through.</p><p>Yuwen Ye was not wounded, but the cloth on his left arm had been torn apart completely, turning into dust in the air.</p><p>\"How is this possible? Ye is in a bad position!\" Yuwen Jin could not believe his own eyes as he stared at Ye Chen with great anger. Right then, even if he were the stupidest person on the land, he would know that Ye Chen had been hiding power before, and Yuwen Hao had only managed to make him reveal a part of his power.</p><p>\"Ye Chen is this powerful!\" Murong Wu and Murong Zhishui looked at each other without knowing what more to say.</p><p>With Ye Chen's power right now, he was no weaker than normal Sea of Souls Realm master level warriors. Of course, it was just no weaker, so it did not mean that he could beat them for sure. After all, to become a master level warrior, one would have to be powerful in all areas and without flaws. Ye Chen and Yuwen Ye were still relatively weaker compared to true master warriors.</p><p>\"Wow! Already so powerful at peak level Early Sea of Souls Realm. Wait until he reaches mid Sea of Souls Realmâ€¦He might already be able to join the master level, and would not be the weakest one for sure.\"</p><p>\"With Mid Sea of Souls Realm cultivation and this kind of battle prowess, such a martial genius is not that easy to find out there.\"</p><p>\"Yeah! Within all regions around, such martial geniuses are indeed rare.\"</p><p>\"In the surrounding regions, one of the potential successors of the second leader for Yellow Dragon Palace in the Eastern region, Li Xiaoling, seems to be quite close. But, he is only close, and is still not there yet. There are one or two top warriors inside the west and north regions, and definitely not that many inside Sky Martial Region either.\"</p><p>The Gu Lan region and the Sky Martial Region were only one region apart from one and another. A lot of the people here had been there before at least once. So, they actually knew quite a lot about the young generations.</p><p>In the sky, Yuwen Ye had a bad look on his face. Although Ye Chen did not wound him with that attack, the pain on his left arm was still rather severe, almost to the extent that it had started to go numb. But, what angered him was not the physical pain, but the mental surprise, which was something that he could not handle.</p><p>\"My cultivation is at peak level Mid Sea of Souls Realm, and my martial spirit is at rank 4. With the special power enhancement, I am basically powerful in almost all areas. How can I still be in this inferior position?\"</p><p>Regardless of whether Yuwen Ye wanted to admit it or not, it was a fact that he had lost the upper hand of the battle.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>With the power on his left arm, Yuwen Ye backed out rapidly. Meanwhile, he lifted up his right hand, and a huge sphere of dark gold qi appeared out of nowhere.</p><p>\"Demon Gold Flash!\"</p><p>Ye Chen's pupil shrank. Needless to say, he knew that Yuwen Ye's attack would definitely be more powerful than Yuwen Hao's. He knew that it would be extremely powerful and hard to escape from.</p><p>'I have to release all of my slaughter sword intent'</p><p>Before Yuwen Ye used his special power, Ye Chen had been using destruction sword intent. Later on, he actually started to use the slaughter sword intent more. Its power was at rank 5 of normal sword intents. Because of his high-powered soul power, his sword intent did not leak out at all. Therefore, no one really knew that his slaughter sword spirit had reached this level. Right now, if he continued to grow, it would be at peak level rank 5. No matter how powerful his control was over his power, he would not be able to hide it from everyone anymore.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Yuwen Ye released his Zhen yuan. The dark golden qi ball shot out, turning into a dark golden ray that roared toward Ye Chen at an extreme speed. Its speed seemed to be way faster than in case of Yuwen Hao.</p><p>The ray flashed once before disappearing completely. But even with this single flash, the sun seemed to have lost its color, the area turning into a world of black and white.</p><p>Releasing his attack, a creepy evil smile appeared shortly on Yuwen Ye's face. His special power was defensive enhancement which provided him with an extremely powerful body. Hence, it would be impossible for him to not train the Demon Gold Flash. Compared to Yuwen Hao, his talent was even higher; therefore, the power of that attack would be higher as well.</p><p>If it were not because he had been pushed to the corner, he would not have used it at all. For him, the more hidden power he saved, the better. Earlier on, he had thought he would be able to win against Ye Chen easily without the attack.</p><p>'The Demon Gold Flash I performed would be hard for even normal Sea of Souls Realm masters to handle. They can only try to escape. So, having to lose to this attack, it could be considered your honor. Now, let me humiliate you nice and well, making you lose the reputation that you care about.' Yuwen Ye thought to himself cruelly.</p><p>Below him, the Murong brothers, Wang Shi, and Yan Kui could feel their heartbeat quickening as they watched Ye Chen nervously. Yao Yifeng and Yuwen Jin sneered; they seemed to already see what would happen once Ye Chen lost.</p><p>Whoo!</p><p>Seeing that dark golden ray getting closer and closer, Ye Chen's power exploded. His ink-black long hair danced in the air while a horrifying slaughter sword intent shot out into the clouds. That sword intent had reached beyond his control, and the world seemed to fall into chaos in deep silence. Even the sky seemed to have been dyed dark red. It was a sign of killing and bad omen. Once it appeared, it was doomed to have blood splashed about while Ye Chen would transform into the angel of death.</p><p>Since he was no longer keeping his power hidden, everyone there could sense it clearly. All of them had their eyes wide open, just like their mouths.</p><p>\"Impossible! This isâ€¦ a king warrior's sword intent!\"</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
