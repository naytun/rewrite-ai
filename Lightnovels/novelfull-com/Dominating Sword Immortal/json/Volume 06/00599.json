No matter what level he has reached, he will not lose to other people. Right now, even one of the top three sword masters, Tai Shichong has lost to him.\"</p><p>\"Brother Li, you are wrong. He is not one of the martial geniuses…he is one of the top three. Did you not hear? A couple of months ago, there was a young man named Ye Chen who had managed to leave his name on the name wall in the Heaven Martial Pavilion. Although he was only ranked in the top three, he was just like them who had managed to make it through the seventh round.\"</p><p>\"Perhaps his age is even older than Du Gujue and Dantai Mingyue. Although it has nothing to do with talent, it has some effect after all.\"</p><p>\"No, you are wrong again. Someone had dug up his background: he is from a rank 7 martial institution from the South Rudra Region, and he has been largely appreciated by the Dragon King. Plus, his age is not only not older than Gu Dujue and Dantai Mingyue's, he is actually two years younger than them.\"</p><p>\"What! Really! Does that mean that when he reached the Seas of Souls Realm, he was even younger than the Mysterious Queen?\"</p><p>\"Indeed! Therefore, it would not be exaggerating to put him among them.\"</p><p>People who were watching started to chat quietly.</p><p>\"Brother Ye, they are talking about you!\" Hai Wuya laughed.</p><p>Ye Chen said lightly, \"These are only names. A high reputation does not mean that they would be afraid of you. Instead, if you do not perform well, then you would fall even harder.\"</p><p>\"You are right! Those kinds of things are just extra pressure after all. How many martial geniuses had been burdened because of that and ended up with nothing…\"</p><p>Yan Fengfeng said, \"This Du Gujue is a blade artist. Perhaps he could soon be challenging one of the top young warriors Xiao Chuhe.\"</p><p>Xiao Chuhe had beaten one of the top three master warriors in blade art, Shen Qianlang, not that long ago, and became one of the new top blade artists. His reputation was even more well-known than Tai Shichong's, and only the sword master among the top three warriors could battle with him.</p><p>\"Indeed powerful! That despair blade intent should be at rank 4, its power equal to a normal rank 5 blade intent. That attack from before should be approaching the mid rank profound blade art. Plus, I heard that he even trained the dark spirit body and cultivated the dark Zhen yuan, which would be way more powerful than normal ones.\"</p><p>Rank 5 blade intent would be still slightly weaker than Ye Chen's, and although that attack seemed powerful, it could not beat Ye Chen; it was almost the same as Ye Chen's most powerful attack. But, this dark spirit body would be rather tricky, since it was a rare body type that was similar to Jing Aoxuan's thunder spirit body; that dark Zhen yuan would also be stronger than Ye Chen's.</p><p>Ye Chen did not have the confidence of winning against him. But of course, the percentage of him losing would not be that high either: right now, it would be around fifty percent. After this battle, Ye Chen had also figured out Tai Shichong's real power. To be honest, Ye Chen would have more than sixty percent of confidence in winning against his opponent, since his cultivation had improved so many times in the past few days. He had reached the peak level of the mid Sea of Souls Realm already. Even though it might seem little, but his advantage would indeed be his mental power. And right now, even his cultivation had caught up, so all he would need to improve would be his profound sense martial arts, which would be fixed by his sword intent. Therefore, augmenting his cultivation had improved his battling power by a lot.</p><p>However, he might still be slightly weaker than Yan Fengfeng. Up until now, Ye Chen had never seen her use all of her battling power yet. Added with her extremely crazy speed, Ye Chen thought that she could be one of the strongest warriors right below the top five warriors; that too was just because of her humble lifestyle, and that she would never actively challenge other people. But of course, if other people were trying to look for trouble, she would surely do the killing.</p><p>Hai Wuya sighed, \"The epic era is coming. No one would dare to fall behind.\"</p><p>The top three martial geniuses, and countless top martial warriors...This era seemed to be more intense than the peak ones before. Wanting to be at the top was not something just anyone could achieve.</p><p>After beating Tai Shichong, Du Gujue looked over at Ye Chen's direction before locking eyes onto him.</p><p>\"It should be him who had revealed his rank 5 sword intent before!\" When Du Gujue was battling with Tai Shichong, Ye Chen could not help control his battling intention, which led to a minor leakage of his sword intent. People with mental power that was lower than rank 5 would not be able to sense it at all. But, Du Gujue's blade intent happened to be at rank 5, so he felt it, and that slight hint of sword intent had threatened him. After all, no one but Dantai Mingyue had achieved it amongst the young generation.</p><p>'Why is he looking at Ye Chen?' Hai Wuya thought.</p><p>Du Gujue looked at Ye Chen from afar, \"I am Du Gujue…What is your name?\"</p><p>\"Ye Chen.\" He said lightly.</p><p>\"What? He is that Ye Chen! Indeed so young!\"</p><p>Everyone looked over at Ye Chen.</p><p>Hearing him, a bright black light exploded from Du Gujue's eyes, \"You are Ye Chen!\" The news of Ye Chen making through seven levels in a row and leaving his name on the wall, ranking right next to Dantai Mingyue, had been spread out. However, he had only heard about it recently.</p><p>\"Alright! Dantai Mingyue and I had been battling for a long time now. Finally, there is a new opponent. I hope you will not fall behind that soon!\"</p><p>\"As you wish.\"</p><p>Du Gujue chuckled. Ye Chen's attitude was very calm, but that kind of intense confidence was clear to him. All of a sudden, his eyes went cold, and a blade light seemed to be shooting from within. That pale white light sliced through the world, with everything reflected on top of it.</p><p>Ye Chen's expression did not change, but the depths of his eyes, which carried a bright light, suddenly went dark red. With that, a kind of unbreakable sword light shot out, after a mere touch of which, that blade light disappeared immediately. In front of this concrete slaughter sword intent, the despair was inevitable and expected. After all, death was the outcome of killing, and who would not be despairing in front of death?</p><p>Pop!</p><p>The blade intent and the sword intent clashed together. That despair and killing vibe spread out everywhere, and a lot of people were affected. Their faces went pale all of a sudden while a migraine found the way into their brains.</p><p>'It is the slaughter sword intent! No wonder he is not afraid of my despair blade intent. His might even be a bit stronger than mine.' Du Gujue frowned. His blade intent could affect his opponent's emotion and make them despair, losing the hope and just waiting for death. But, there would also be people that he could not influence, such as warriors with the slaughter sword intent. Of course, because of the different attribute, slaughter sword intent could not oppress the despair blade intent either.</p><p>\"You have the right to be listed right beside Dantai Mingyue and I. But, the real battle would be way more brutal than before. A lot of people had missed out the details, but it was the details indeed that decided the result.\"</p><p>Du Gujue was wounded; otherwise, he might have actually battled with Ye Chen already.</p><p>A real battle had got three basic aspects—the cultivation, mind, and profound sense. Besides that, there were also other factors, such as special spirit body type, and these were all the major aspects. But, after judging on those, it would be the tiny details that would act as the deciding points, such as the batting experience, techniques, whether the warrior had fought through life and death, and whether she or he had the potential. In other words, it was really hard to judge one's power, especially for martial geniuses. As for those normal beings and mortals, they could be judged by the first three factors alone.</p><p>Ye Chen smiled, \"Unfortunately, I am a man who is into the details.\"</p><p>\"I have memorized your name now. One day in the future, you and I will meet again.\" After that, Du Gujue turned to leave, with Du Gumin and the others following behind him.</p><p>Hai Wuya watched him leave, then said to Ye Chen, \"It seems like he takes you very seriously. He was not as reckless as before.\"</p><p>Ye Chen sighed, \"Very scary…One of the scariest person I have met in my life.\"</p><p>He was not afraid of powerful people, neither of people with great potential. The only kind of people that he was afraid of were the kind who were powerful in all areas, as well as their mental state, and had a love for the details. In other words, Du Gujue did not have a weak point. If Ye Chen wanted to win against him, he would have to battle with him head-on.</p><p>However, Ye Chen was indeed excited.</p><p>The value of existence of people was not in what they gained from life, but the challenges that they went through.</p><p>\"Let's go.\"</p><p>The battle was finished, and there was no reason to continue staying there.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>With that, the flying ship flew into the distance.</p><p>…</p><p>Fly Feather City, one of the mid-sized cities in the Heave Martial Region...</p><p>Inside an estate, Ye Chen was on a massive practice ground, training his martial arts.</p><p>This estate was rented because warriors tended to travel a lot, so it was unlikely for them to have a permanent residence. Therefore, cities with special geographical characteristics would have situations like full restaurants and hotels. Moreover, some of the powerful warriors did not like to live in the hotels anyway, preferring to stay in Estates or luxurious houses life this. However, once the people left, it would be quite troubling to sell the houses afterward. It was then when the rental business was founded. Renting an estate would definitely be cheaper than buying one. But after a long time, it would still be making quite a bit fortune for the business owner.</p><p>After separating from Yan Fengfeng and the others, Ye Chen came to the Fly Feather City nearby. He was planning to stay here for a while, taking the time to digest some of the enlightenment he got from making a breakthrough.</p><p>On the training yard, Ye Chen drowned in his empty, off-the-world mode, practicing his martial arts with odd postures. This martial art was not the normal concept of martial arts; it was just uninhibited movements of Ye Chen. As Ye Chen moved, a gold light appeared from his body. He threw out a punch, which contained the sharpness of gold, pointing out a finger and creating a loud noise.</p><p>Swoosh! He did not even use any Zhen yuan or will power at all.</p><p>'After reaching the Sea of Souls Realm, each time when I make a breakthrough, I will have some new enlightenment. I did not expect to learn the gold profound after making the breakthrough to the Mid Sea of Souls Realm.'</p><p>He was no longer a normal human being; he was something between a demigod and a mortal. Therefore, after making the breakthrough, there was a small moment where he could feel something way higher than his state. The sensitivity toward the profound reached a completely different level. When he first made the breakthrough, Ye Chen's Gold Resonant Radiance Sword had reached one hundred and ten percent. But, he needed time to rethink the whole process.</p><p>Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!</p><p>Every single one of Ye Chen's movements had a layer of golden shine, a sign of his gold profound reaching a very high realm.</p><p>\"Gold Resonant Radiance!\"</p><p>Putting his right hand index and middle fingers together, Ye Chen used his fingers as his sword and waved them out at the sky.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A beam of bright gold light flew out, the edge jagged like a sawtooth. He heard a loud sound, and a huge crack on the ground cracked open. The gap was narrow at both ends like an eye hole, which was a different kind of effect from his normal Gold Resonant Radiance.</p><p>\"One hundred and thirty percent power! It is almost at the limit.\"</p><p>After comprehending the profound, even if one did not use Zhen yuan and mental power, they would be able to absorb the natural yuan qi. Using the gold profound would take the gold yuan qi out of the natural surroundings, which would bring up an extreme battling power. Therefore, even if Ye Chen lost all of his Zhen yuan and mental power, he would still be as powerful as a Clasping Yuan Realm warrior.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Ye Chen stopped all of his movements.</p><p>\"Three days of time…I have finally finished all of those ideas. I have now completely trained the gold profound. Now, I can move onto cultivating the dragon blood plants and the Dragon Bone Jade Marrow.\"</p><p>Ye Chen had obtained eight dragon blood plants and one jade skeleton in total. Eight plants would train out eight strands of dragon power, and those dragon bones could only achieve a better result. With all those added together, he could potentially train dozens of dragon power strands, which would be rather impressive.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
