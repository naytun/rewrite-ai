Tai Shichong", "volume": 6, "volume_title": "Volume 6", "body": "<h1>597 Du Gujue Vs. Tai Shichong</h1><p>Alright! Regardless, we have won this round, and all of the Dragon Blood Plants belong to us.\" Yan Fengfeng turned her head and looked at the plants near the dragon bones, then said seriously, \"But, before we distribute the plants, I would like to lay down some ground rules.\"</p><p>\"Of course, there should always be ground rules! If a team wants to continue working together, then it should be fair. How are we going to ensure that it is fair? Very simple…we are going to distribute what we get depending on how much effort each of us put in. If you put more effort in this, then you get more…if it's less than the others, then you get less of course. If we distribute everything equally, then it would not be fair at all. That Longevity Fruit was an exception. Sometimes, we can decide based on our affinity for things, but of course, it was just a coincidence.\"</p><p>Looking over at Ling Tianhao and Guan Qin, Yan Fengfeng continued, \"You two had done less, so you two will only get twenty percent of the total gains.\"</p><p>\"Sister disciple, I do not have a problem with that at all.\"</p><p>\"Me neither!\"</p><p>Ling Tianhao and Guan Qin knew their power, and they were already quite happy about getting ten percent. If it were the other teams, they might not have ended up with anything.</p><p>\"Out of the remaining eighty percent, I will only take twenty percent. Yan Fengfeng, you and Ye Chen should take thirty each.\" Hai Wuya volunteered. The battle between Ye Chen and Ao Wubai had let him know that Ye Chen had reached way beyond him. Now, Ye Chen was not that weaker than Yan Fengfeng. In comparison to Yan Fengfeng, Ye Chen had even got more advantages; for example, when he used his powerful destruction sword intent, those horrifying reflexes and observation skills could already make a massive difference. For another example, that wind spirit in that heavy wind was manageable and rather easy to take care of because of Ye Chen.</p><p>After saying that, Hai Wuya was a bit emotional. It had not been long before Ye Chen had reached beyond him.</p><p>\"Brother Hai?\"</p><p>Yan Fengfeng and Ye Chen looked at him; Yan Fengfeng actually wanted to split the eighty percent evenly between the three of them, since it was still the first time out for them, and there was no need to make the cut so clear.</p><p>Hai Wuya laughed as he said, \"Needless to say, I know it clearly. But, the next time, I will use my power to win the percentages.\"</p><p>\"Since that is the case, then so be it. Brother Ye, you don't have a problem with that, right?\" The Mysterious Queen was very serious about Ye Chen, so Yan Fengfeng had been addressing Ye Chen as her brother disciple. But, she had to admit it as well that this brother disciple of hers probably had more than fifty percent chance of winning against even herself. So, after all, it was reasonable for them to get thirty percent each.</p><p>Ye Chen shook his head.</p><p>After deciding the percentage, the rest was easy. They separated to get the dragon blood plants, each one of them wishing they could get a little bit more.</p><p>\"I have six of them here!\"</p><p>\"Nine here!\"</p><p>\"Eight here!\"</p><p>With all of the plants gathered together, Yan Fengfeng said, \"Twenty-nine in total…It would be nice to have another one.\"</p><p>Thirty plants would be an even number, which would be great for calculating.</p><p>\"How about this? Brother Ling, you and Guan Qin can take three plants each. Brother Hai, you get six, and brother Ye, you can get nine. I will just take eight.\"</p><p>Yan Fengfeng was missing one.</p><p>\"Sister Yan, it is my first time here. I will take eight and you take nine.\" Ye Chen took eight plants before putting them into the storage ring.</p><p>\"Haha!\"</p><p>Hai Wuya chuckled. Ye Chen was the type of people he liked.</p><p>Yan Fengfeng also had a slightly better opinion of Ye Chen. There were indeed a lot of plants, but it would not be that easy for someone to just give up on a Dragon Blood Plant this easily. But, this was even better, since everyone seemed to be able to have a great time together, and there would not be any arguments or fights based on benefits.</p><p>\"Now, it will be the time for the Dragon Bone Jade Narrow!\"</p><p>The five of them lifted up their head to look at that massive skeleton at the same time.</p><p>After the Sea of Souls Realm warriors died, spirit power crystal stones would have a chance of appearing. After Life and Death Realm warriors died, those crystal stones would again appear. But of course, their value would be way higher than the ones from Sea of Souls Realm warriors. Similarly, after the dragons died, dragon bones jade marrow would appear inside their bones. But after all these years, no one knew if they had already turned into fossils.</p><p>\"Break!\"</p><p>Yan Fengfeng threw out a palm attack toward the skeleton, which was already no longer as tough as before. The reason that it was able to stay in its shape was because there was a hint of dragon will power residue in it. However, there was not much of it left, and that intense battle had already loosened it up. Right then, when Yan Fengfeng's palm reached out, that skeleton fell apart immediately.</p><p>The broken dragon bone pieces were littered everywhere on the ground. Above it, a pile of blue halo appeared, the size of an egg.</p><p>\"It is the Dragon Bone Jade Marrow!\"</p><p>\"There is only one Dragon Bone Jade Marrow. How should we do this?\"</p><p>The Dragon Bone Jade Marrow was more valuable than the Dragon Blood Plants, so no one seemed to want to give up.</p><p>Ye Chen said, \"Let's just use our power to see!\"</p><p>\"Let's not kill each other though!\" Yan Fengfeng nodded.</p><p>\"We will pass on this.\"</p><p>Ling Tianhao and Guan Qin smiled forcedly; they knew that they could not beat the other three for sure.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>Yan Fengfeng turned into a beam of blue flame, shooting out toward the dragon skeleton.</p><p>Ye Chen was not slow either as five beams of sword light appeared out of his body. His sword light flashed once, following right behind Yan Fengfeng. Meanwhile, Hai Wuya performed his Sky Sea Godly Palm attack. The world seemed to be spinning, and Yan Fengfeng and Ye Chen's balance had been affected. Hai Wuya then waved his big hand, trying to grab the dragon bone skeleton.</p><p>The three were fighting with each other, and that qi flow spread out intensively.</p><p>\"Not good! What is going on? Such a powerful will power attack!\" Hai Wuya's face went pale as he was blown backward into the air.</p><p>\"It is the dragon skeleton!\" Yan Fengfeng frowned, stopping her body.</p><p>Only Ye Chen went forward like nothing had happened. He flew right at the skeleton, reaching out his hand and sucking it over toward him.</p><p>It was a jewel-like blue crystal, with a pure blue halo around it. It was so pure that nothing seemed to be able to touch it. Holding it in his hand, Ye Chen could sense that powerful will power spreading out, along with that faint energy pattern.</p><p>\"Brother Ye, congratulations! I did not expect this dragon bone jade skeleton to have this powerful a dragon will power! I guess only you have the power to fight against that.\"</p><p>Since he could not get it, Hai Wuya let it go.</p><p>Yan Fengfeng laughed, \"Losing one Dragon Blood Plant, getting one Dragon Bone Jade Bone Marrow…I guess the universe is indeed fair. I cannot compete with you even if I try.\"</p><p>The dragon will power was something that no one had expected. But now that one thought about it, it made a lot of sense, since the bone skeleton would not stand for this long without it.</p><p>After playing with the jade bone marrow, Ye Chen flipped his hand, putting it away as he chuckled, \"I am sorry, haha! I think it is meant to be with me.\"</p><p>\"With this, your defense will probably be one of the best right now. It will no longer be your weakness.\" Sword artists' defense was normally weaker than that of others, which was common sense.</p><p>\"Let's go! Let's see if there are some other treasures!\"</p><p>The dragon cave was huge, and they had only explored a very small part of it. The first region they searched was the mad wind area, which was right next to them. But with Ye Chen there, the wind spirits could not do them any harm.</p><p>Soon, all five of them had obtained some top rank wind spirit stones. They were similar to the fire cloud stones, but the top rank wind spirit stones were even harder to find. Only after a thousand years of time could those be formed at places with extremely rich wind yuan qi.</p><p>For a whole day, the five had basically turned the whole dragon cave upside down, managing to gain more treasures. It was only on the second morning that they left the dragon cave.</p><p>…</p><p>In the next couple of days, the five continued to explore the other places. For them, this annual opportunity was so valuable, especially in this era when the others were all trying their hardest to be more powerful. If one did not try, then one could be eliminated just like that. So, everyone had to give it their all.</p><p>During this period of time, Ye Chen finally managed to stabilize his mid rank Sea of Souls Realm, starting to swallow the Earth Spirit Pellet and Sky Spirit pellet to accumulate Zhen yuan.</p><p>The earth spirit pellet was already extremely rare, its effect very potent; and the Heaven Spirit Pellet was three times more potent than the former, so its effect could be imagined.</p><p>With only one week, Ye Chen had reached the peak level of the Mid Sea of Souls Realm, his Zhen yuan richer by twenty to thirty percent.</p><p>…</p><p>\"It is time to leave!\"</p><p>By the end of the month, the Savage Evil qi was getting richer and richer, such that one could see signs of it with bare eyes. It was getting so powerful that it was starting to affect people's will.</p><p>\"Haha! I think we have got more than enough. With all these resources, it would be hard not to get better.\"</p><p>\"I will see you next time. I hope you all make some progress.\"</p><p>The five went on their flying ship, flying where they came from.</p><p>In front of the protective layer…</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Yan Fengfeng tore apart the blockage with only one claw attack, and the flying ship shot out.</p><p>\"Eh? So many people here! What is going on?\"</p><p>Once they came out, the five saw hundreds of people gathered on the flat ground not that far away. All of them were at least spirit level warriors, while master level warriors formed a majority. It was not that surprising after all, since the evil qi around here was at its lowest level of the year, and a lot of people had rushed over. Right now, it was the last day of the month, so everyone was rushing out of the ancient place.</p><p>\"Look! It is Tai Shichong! Someone is messing with him.\" Ling Tianhao said with a low voice.</p><p>\"Let's go check it out!\"</p><p>Riding on the flying ship, the five came above the crowd where a lot of people were \"standing\" as well. They were all Seas of Souls Realm master level warriors.</p><p>\"Tai Shichong! You had wounded my cousin! You should know what the consequences of that would be!\" It was a young man with a similar age as Ye Chen who was standing in front of the group. He was wearing a silver-colored long robe, wielding a narrow, long great blade. His fingers were long, slim, and powerful, with the knuckles slightly sticking out. Although it was Tai Shichong, one of the top three young sword masters standing in front of him, his attitude told people that he did not care about it at all.</p><p>\"It is Du Gujue! I cannot believe that he managed to find Tai Shichong this quickly! Du Gumin is here as well.\" Hai Wuya was immediately attracted to it. He really would like to know who would be more powerful out of Du Gujue and Tai Shichong, since the former had not battled for a long time.</p><p>Tai Shichong sneered, \"Consequences? I am afraid that you do not have what it takes to show me that.\"</p><p>\"With my blade out, blood will spill for sure. Today, I will use your blood to nourish my blade.\" Du Gujue was cold, without any expression on his face.</p><p>\"Brother Taishi, let's teach him a lesson.\"</p><p>Right next to them, Li Feng and Li Lei, who was still recovering from his old wounds, were both standing there while looking at Du Gujue with a sneer on their faces. One of them was only a martial genius who had just reached the Sea of Souls Realm, and he was somehow challenging one of the top sword masters Tai Shichong, who had reached the realm for a whole six years.</p><p>\"Cousin, he had left a sword mark on my chest! You leave one on his as well!\" Du Gumin said with a tough tone.</p><p>Du Gujue looked over at Tai Shichong as he jumped into the air, \"No worries! I will leave him something for sure. Tai Shichong, come up and fight!\"</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
