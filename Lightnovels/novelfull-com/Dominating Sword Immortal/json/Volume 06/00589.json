Plus, he had already thought that getting the second fruit would require a major battle to decide. And, if one of them managed to get the fruit, then the others would have to help the person in blocking out the incoming attacks. But right now, Ye Chen had managed to get the fruit with an incomprehensible speed. At the same time, seven beams of attacks attacked him; it was almost impossible for him to react in time.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Ye Chen's protective Zhen yuan shattered within a second as the seven beams of aggressive power blew him away for hundreds of meters, all the way into a dense forest. The aggressive qi flow had shredded all plants and trees around Ye Chen and blown them into the air, creating a new flat ground on the island.</p><p>Ling Tianhao and Guan Qin went pale all of the sudden, \"Ye Chen…is not dead, is he?\" They both thought that it would be impossible to survive under that seven attacks.</p><p>\"It will all depend on his luck now. But, I don't think he will die. He is not someone who would lose his mind in front of treasures.\" In the beginning, Hai Wuya indeed thought that Ye Chen was being reckless. But after remembering that the latter had managed to grow all the way until now, it would be impossible for him to be doing all that without a plan.</p><p>As he spoke, Hai Wuya's speed increased to the maximum and flew over toward Ye Chen, since it was indeed the latter who had gotten the fruit; and according to their deal before, they had to join forces together and help Ye Chen in fighting off Tai Shichong, that bulky middle-aged man, and their people.</p><p>On the flat ground inside the forest, the smoke disappeared and Ye Chen's figure appeared in Hai Wuya's sight.</p><p>Right then, he looked horrible—all of his clothes were almost torn apart completely, revealing that gold armor underneath. Meanwhile, there were two shields in his hands as well, one covering his head and the other covering his lower body. Added with that main one, he was fully protected.</p><p>Pooh!</p><p>His face was pale as he puked out a huge chunk of flesh and blood.</p><p>\"There were seven attacks. Four of them were Seas of Souls Realm master level, while the other three were also top spirit warrior level. With my defense, it would be hard to handle one, not to mention all seven of them. Luckily, with my armor, most of the attack had been canceled out, and only thirty percent of the power had actually landed on my body. Otherwise, I would have been dead by now for sure.\"</p><p>Although Ye Chen had already expected this to happen, there was still a major risk involved. A slight mistake or unexpected event would have left him dead, without any chance to undo anything.</p><p>\"Ye Chen, are you alright?\"</p><p>Seeing that Ye Chen was still able to puke out blood, Hai Wuya let out a breath.</p><p>\"I will live.\" Before he tried to grab the fruit, he had already swallowed two yuan qi replenishing pellets; and as he performed his Undying Body art, his severe internal injuries had recovered already. Moreover, the loss of yuan qi had been replaced as well.</p><p>\"You are so impressive, being the first one getting the fruit and all.\" Guan Qin's speed was even faster than Hai Wuya, but her reflexes were significantly slower, so she reached there slower.</p><p>Ling Tianhao was the last one there, as he exclaimed with joy and awe, \"Sister Yan and they are still fighting for that first one. I bet they would have never thought that you would actually be the first one to obtain it.\"</p><p>Of course, no one would have guessed that Ye Chen's speed would be way faster than anyone else's, and he would end up being the first one getting the fruit.</p><p>Ye Chen chuckled. If he did not manage to get one immediately, then he might have had to go home without one today. But, it was all about luck after all, since his battling power was not significantly more powerful.</p><p>\"What? This brat had been hit by seven attacks and still made it out alive? He can even talk so casually?\" The people who attacked Ye Chen frowned. They had prepared for it already—once Ye Chen died, they would fight for his storage ring. However, the situation right now was obviously not going the way they wanted.</p><p>\"Damn, this is a Longevity Fruit…A fruit with a great chance of increasing cultivation!\"</p><p>The twin brothers were not happy with what had happened. They were standing dozens of meters away, staring at Ye Chen with an evil look in their eyes.</p><p>\"Brat, the fruit belongs to the people who have the power to deserve it. Hand it over, or I will kill you.\" It was a rough looking middle-aged man next to that bulky man who spoke.</p><p>\"Yes! Hand it over and we will let you live. Otherwise, today will be the day you die.\" The other person supported.</p><p>Putting away the shield, Ye Chen sneered, \"Only a powerful warrior deserves it…Since you guys have the power, then why can't you get this fruit?\"</p><p>\"Huh! You are only fast in speed. If we really battle, you are not powerful enough.\"</p><p>They could all tell that Ye Chen was only at peak level Early Seas of Souls Realm. Although they were a bit concerned, they did not think that Ye Chen would be that powerful.</p><p>\"Sorry, but the things in my hand would never leave.\" Asking Ye Chen to give up his Longevity Fruit would be impossible. These people were actually right, as the fruit should belong to the most powerful of them all. And with the fruit, his power would move onto the next level, perhaps even beyond.</p><p>\"Look at you being this giant idiot…Give it to us!\"</p><p>The middle-aged man with black hair all over his face stomped onto the ground with his right leg, and his whole body expanded from two meters' height all the way to four meters, looking like a giant. His arms were the size of human waists; Veins popped out like snakes on his body, which was a rather frightening view. He jumped out like a dangerous tiger in the jungle, bringing up a wave of evil qi.</p><p>\"Body expansion! He is a Savage man!\" Hai Wuya was having a realization as he yelled, \"I have never battled with one before. Today, I will see it for myself!\"</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The two people clashed together at once, exchanging intense attacks.</p><p>\"Ye Chen, we can only block these two for you. The rest will be still on you.\" Ling Tianao and Tian Qin stood in front of that bulky looking middle-aged man.</p><p>Ye Chen responded, \"Thank you guys!\"</p><p>Being able to have one Longevity fruit was already extremely satisfying for him, and he would not want any of the rest. 'I will fight for Hai Wuya and the rest, trying to create chances for them.'</p><p>\"You two, go stand over there and keep an eye on the third fruit. I will leave him to my two other brothers.\" The twin brothers had a huge ambition. Not only did they want Ye Chen's fruit, they wanted all the fruits on the tree.</p><p>Speaking of which, the two stood shoulder by shoulder, approaching Ye Chen with an evil intention.</p><p>\"Kill!\"</p><p>With a roar, they attacked from two different directions towards Ye Chen.</p><p>\"Little brat, we are the famous Wind Thunder Two Masters! If you are smart enough, hand over the fruit…Otherwise, you are going down!\"</p><p>They were actually quite famous inside the Sky Martial Region, since the two were both Seas of Souls Realm masters. The older brother was called Li Feng while the younger was Li Lei. Each one of them might not be as powerful as Hai Wuya, but with the two combined, not many people would be their rightful opponents. It was mainly because they were able to telepathically communicate with each other to make up for the flaws they might have.</p><p>\"Cut the crap! If you want the fruit, then talk with your power!\"</p><p>If the twin brothers were only one person, then Ye Chen might be very concerned. But, since there were two of them, that meant he would still have a chance. Since he trained battling techniques, he was confident that he would find a way to separate them as long as he managed to find the key.</p><p>\"Since you are looking for death, then do not blame us for being cruel. Wind Fist!\" The older brother Li Feng threw out a punch, bringing out waves of winds. The fist speed was unbelievably fast and aggressive.</p><p>\"Thunder Godly Leg attack!\" Meanwhile, the younger brother attacked as well. He kicked toward Ye Chen's lower body, which was not slower than the fist attack. Both of the incoming attacks were extremely powerful, and contained the thunder profound.</p><p>One fist and one kick attack worked together perfectly.</p><p>'I cannot go head-on against them. With my own power, it would be impossible to stop the two together, so I will have to fight with one of them and forbid them from joining forces.'</p><p>With that thought in mind, Ye Chen took a step forward. His body became surreal, turning into a beam of vague black shadow and avoiding Li Feng's fist attack before drawing a smooth line in the air and making his way toward Li Lei.</p><p>\"Trying to interrupt our connection, huh? Dream on!\"</p><p>Li Feng sneered as he turned his body bringing up a wave of intense wind that attacked toward Ye Chen while Li Lei continued with his attacks. Endless thunder and lightning appeared to fill up the sky; as long as Ye Chen continued to approach, the former was confident that he would burn the other into pieces.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>However, Ye Chen stopped abruptly; under his feet was sword light. He gave up on Li Lei and turned toward Li Feng on the side, his body continuing to shift like a beam of sword light.</p><p>\"You are looking for death!\"</p><p>Li Feng was slightly surprised, as he had just realized that Ye Chen's target was not Li Lei, but himself. However, he was not afraid; he attacked with a sky-full of fist shadows.</p><p>It would be impossible for Ye Chen not to know that his tricks would be seen through by the telepathic twin brothers, and his true intention was to target at li Lei. He stepped his right foot on the ground and a wave of energy dove into the ground before reaching under Li Lei and exploding, bringing up small rocks into the air.</p><p>Although Li Lei was fine, his attacking tempo had been interrupted.</p><p>And it was just that split second of hesitation that provided Ye Chen the perfect opportunity.</p><p>\"Shadow Explosion!\"</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Ye Chen's body shook once before turning into dozens of black shadows, Li Lei's kick shadow and Li Feng's fist shadow had shattered most of the incoming black shadows, but Ye Chen's real body had managed to go through the gap between Li Lei's kick and throw out a moon-shaped sword qi.</p><p>Li Lei yelled, talking out a shield to block the sword qi.</p><p>\"Speed Sword Hell!\"</p><p>Ye Chen's attacking power was like running water, without a moment of rest. It was so fast that the sword shadow was almost invisible to the human eyes, devouring Li Lei within.</p><p>Ting! Ting! Dang! Dang!</p><p>Metallic explosions were heard as Li Lei waved his shield to block out all of the sword shadows without being wounded at all.</p><p>\"Back out!\"</p><p>Ye Chen performed Gold Resonant Radiance Attack and the gold sword light landed onto Li Lei's shield heavily, blowing him dozens of meters away. Ye Chen held his thunder disaster sword and continuously attacked him while maintaining the distance from Li Feng, who was behind him.</p><p>\"B*stard!\"</p><p>Li Lei fought back and Li Feng caught up with them.</p><p>Ye Chen laughed coldly as his body turned into a shadow, attacking Li Lei from an extremely close distance. This made Li Feng worry about accidentally hitting Li Lei, so he did not throw out too powerful attacks.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
