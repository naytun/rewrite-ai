Due to their extreme potency against all evils, they pushed the main Demonic will strongly. After a while, the latter had continuously been pushed out. And it was not over yet, since there was only one Demonic will, with nothing to back it up. On the contrary, the slaughter and destruction sword intent intensified rapidly and kept at their peak conditions. Therefore, it did not take it long for Ye Chen's sword intent to push out the main Demonic will.</p><p>It was like a vicious cycle—the weaker the main Demonic will got, the faster the slaughter and destruction sword intents pushed it out. After two to three blinks' time, it was completely shattered even before being pushed completely out of Ye Chen's body.</p><p>\"Damn! Even the universe seems to be helping that little brat. Not before, neither after, it was right at this damn moment that he decides to make a breakthrough!\"</p><p>After consistent failures, the being in the underground world became desperate, even starting to curse the universe. After the centuries that he had been sealed away for in the underground world, the day where the seal got loosened had finally come, and he managed to easily form his Demonic will formation to come out and move around. But, he could not foresee that he would face this kind of bad luck again after just one year of slight freedom, and that his soul would be wounded this bad in a row. Even the core of his soul had been wounded, which had taken him hundreds of years to recover.</p><p>Of course, what made him the most furious was that Ye Chen, this 'vessel' of his, was so rare and perfect. He knew that once he captured Ye Chen, even if he had to be sealed away in the underground world forever, he could still become one of the top sword kings and use someone else's body to reach the top of the world. And the fact that it was successful all the way until that last critical moment gave him the kind of shock that normal people could never understand.</p><p>\"I am so full of anger and hate! I hate that Star Emperor with a burning passion who had sealed me away in this underground world. I hate that Battle King who had used his immortal sword intent to wound my soul so badly that it managed to reach back to its peak only today. And I hate that brat even more, who turned my hundred years of work into nothing. Those three must be the archenemies of my life! But, even if they are, I will have to make it out! And, I will make you my vessel!\"</p><p>The Demonic will he had sent out was gone completely by now. He had already given up on trying to get Ye Chen's body, since right then and there, his soul had already been wounded badly. Even if he continued to form his Demonic will formation, it would not be as powerful as before. Moreover, Ye Chen's two sword intents were canceling the power of his Demonic will, so it would just be a complete waste of time and effort. After cursing everyone in his mind, he then finally calmed down and went back to his deep sleep.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The surface of the ground cracked open and Ye Chen shot out from below.</p><p>\"It was so dangerous!\"</p><p>Standing under the sunshine, Ye Chen was feeling much better.</p><p>He could vaguely sense that this was not just a crack that led to the underground world. There must be some kind of major secret hidden here, especially the fact that these Shadowless Demons even managed to somehow fuse together and attack as an entity. It was already not something a normal Shadowless Demon could do, since they should only be Demonic wills that could possess people.</p><p>But, just like his soul talent, he needed enough pressure and threat to push him into growing faster. Before, when he was facing powerful warriors from the Ao family, he managed to train his undying body to completion; and this time, when he was about to lose his own body to the evil wills, he explored his potential and managed to infuse his second sword spirit with his intent and form the destruction sword spirit as well.</p><p>Its ranking was just like the slaughter sword spirit, which would also be at peak level rank 4. But, judging on power, it would be way more powerful than the former, able to bring out a power that would be worth peak level rank 5. Although the destruction sword spirit could not reach rank 6 yet, it would be way closer to it now.</p><p>\"You lose some and you win some. It is indeed always like this.\"</p><p>Facing the Shadowless demons that were even scarier than the rumors was his bad luck, but managing to form his destruction sword spirit was his good luck. When one could not pinpoint whether it was pure luck or lack of luck, then all one could call it was a moment hanging between life and death.</p><p>\"This place is not suitable for staying this long…I should leave right now.\"</p><p>Without even looking into the change in his soul ocean, he flashed his body and turned into a beam of blue light, shooting out into the distance. Soon, he disappeared completely from the spot.</p><p>After about fifteen minutes, a space that looked like a mirror appeared above the underground crack and exploded suddenly. Meanwhile, a wave of horrifying destruction qi spread out around the cracked space. It crashed into plenty of mountains, cracking open the surface of the ground as well.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>A human figure walked out of the surreal space while the space slowly repaired itself behind him.</p><p>It was a man in his sixties, wearing a bright yellow colored long robe. He had a clear but skinny face that had beautiful lines, which made him look quite presentable. A head full of grayish-white hair danced in the air, making the air around them continue to twist around. His eyes looked through the ground and into the deep end of the crack.</p><p>\"Ping'er's body!\"</p><p>The elder had found Gu Ping's corpse, his eyes full of slaughter intent.</p><p>\"Who! Who killed Ping'er!\"</p><p>The elder in yellow robes crushed the dimmed jade tag in his hands and turned it into nothingness.</p><p>The Gu family in the East Royal City was a rank 5 family where a king level warrior with the title of emperor was born—the East Emperor. Even nowadays when the Gu family was no longer that rich and powerful, no one would still dare to underestimate them, because they had had two top king warriors: the East King and the Destruction King. The former had inherited the East Emperor's legacy, hence the title 'East King'; his power was unpredictably monstrous. The Destruction King had found his own way of martial arts and comprehended the rare destruction profound, hence his title. His destruction power was even more intense than other king warriors' at the same rank.</p><p>And the elder here was indeed the Destruction King.</p><p>As a rank 5 family that had been around for thousands of years, the Gu family had a life palace where they stored most of the life jade tags. Although, they did not serve that much of a purpose, and were only used to mark the life of important figures. If there were one who was dead, the life mark would lose its light as well, informing the family of the warrior's demise.</p><p>Gu Ping had attained master level power at such a young age, so he was undoubtedly one of the important members of the Gu family, and also the warrior they invested in the most. Therefore, the second his tag dimmed, everyone in Gu family was alarmed, even the Destruction King himself.</p><p>The second he found about the news, he used the other life jade tag that Gu Ping carried with him to locate the whereabouts of his body. He then traveled fifty million miles of distance to arrive at the crime scene immediately. But obviously, the killer had been long gone, and only Gu Ping's dead body was there.</p><p>He tried his best to control his temper as he shut his eyes. The soul power exploded and spread out from between his eyebrows, spreading out at an unbelievable speed. One thousand, five thousand, ten thousand, fifteen thousand miles…After reaching the distance, he still did not see anyone suspicious. Suddenly, a cluster of burning white light flashed in between his eyebrows, as his soul power increased its range of detection.</p><p>When his soul power went through a young man in blue, he did not think about it at all, since the young man was only at the peak level Early Sea of Souls Realm. Even if he could do cross-realm battles, it would be impossible for him to kill Gu Ping, who had master level power. If the young man in blue was suspicious, then a whole lot of people would be suspicious, since he had come across at least dozens of warriors who had a higher cultivation than the young man in blue. Some of them made even the Destruction King think twice before even thinking about engaging, since each powerful young martial genius came from a powerful background.</p><p>\"No! No one!\"</p><p>He pulled back his soul power, looking gloomy and pissed off.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Taking a deep breath, he reached out his right hand and pressed it onto the ground. All of a sudden, the ground shook and a huge crack opened up on the surface of the ground. The ground below appeared slowly, eventually reaching over the height of the ground.</p><p>On the rising ground, Gu Ping and the other mighty Gu family warriors' dead bodies appeared in front of him. However, their faces made them hard to recognize, because all their heads and limbs were all gone. There seemed to have been some kind of an explosion here before. Only the body parts that were protected by the top rank armors were safe from being shattered. But even there, the flesh within was all rotten.</p><p>If it were not for Gu Ping's top rank armor and the life jade tag, it would be impossible to tell that the person behind was Gu Ping.</p><p>\"Huh? This qi…?\"</p><p>The second the body raised up to the ground, the Destruction King frowned. He had sensed a wave of Yin qi which was very strange. It felt like it came from some kind of Demonic arts training creep, making him very uncomfortable. He could even feel a slight threat from it.</p><p>\"No wonder my Ping'er would die here. It turns out that there is a Demon king warrior here…who seems wounded right now, or…sealed away!\"</p><p>Crack!</p><p>His body flashed, and the ground below him sank in suddenly. The protective Zhen yuan around him went through like it was cutting tofu, traveling through the ground easily and drilling into the deep part of the ground. With only a slight shake of his body, he arrived where Gu Ping had died. Of course, the ground had been lifted by him already, so it was only a ruin.</p><p>Examining carefully, he flew to the vertical crack that was in the deepest end. He was so fast that it was no different from teleporting.</p><p>The second he got close to the crack, the being in the underground awakened. Earlier on, he was in a deep sleep; therefore, he did not sense the incoming Destruction King. The being was only alarmed when the warrior almost got to where he was hiding.</p><p>\"A Life and Death Realm warrior! Not good! This place is no longer suitable for staying now. Damn! It is going to waste my energy again. Before I go, I will teach him a lesson. Through the crack of the seal, I think I can throw out a full-range mental attack when he gets close.\"</p><p>The being in the underground did not seem to be that worried about the Destruction King.</p><p>Going through the crack, Destroy King arrived in the darkest place where the air was thick and full of a shapeless power field. Even his soul power detection seemed to become slower her, seeming to be twisted as well.</p><p>\"Piss off!\"</p><p>In the deep end, a tiny noise came out of some object somewhere. Meanwhile, a wave of horrifying Demonic will shot out, attacking toward the Destruction King.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>The beam of Demonic will already had the power to Affect reality, shattering the rock wall behind the Destruction King instantly. All of a sudden, it all turned into ashes. Meanwhile, even though the Destruction King came in full of power, he was wounded right then and blood came out of the corner of his mouth. It was too powerful of a Demonic will, which was at least peak level rank 7. Although he managed to use his martial spirit to fight back slightly, the attack seemed to have still managed to land on him.</p><p>\"Damn! I will let you go this time, but next time…I will make you beg me to kill you!\" The tiny voice could be easily missed if not listened to carefully, and it was only there for a second before stopping abruptly.</p><p>The Destruction King tried his best to control his anger, but he then started to wonder. He felt that a wounded or a sealed Demon king warrior would not be a threat him at all, but that restricted attack had still managed to wound him, even though that was only a mental projection. In that case, without the seal, even ten of him might not be enough.</p><p>\"There are so many places with seals. Some of them were demons and beasts that were unkillable, so they had to be kept away. So, Ping'er's death could not be blamed on anyone. He could only blame himself for coming to this place.\"</p><p>He came to find the killer of Gu Ping, but now knew that there would be no one he could really take revenge from for the latter's death.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
