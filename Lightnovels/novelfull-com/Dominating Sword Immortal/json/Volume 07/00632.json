So, they went directly to the entrance of the third floor.</p><p>While the first two floors were the world of fire and ice, the third floor was completely different. It was filled with crystal like qi flow that was thick as water, covering every inch of the place. Besides this crystal like qi flow, there was zero yuan qi in this world. No yuan qi meant the possibility of transforming the natural yuan qi into one’s own was gone, creating a place of extreme danger.</p><p>“No yuan qi, but somehow it’s filled with treasure qi?”</p><p>Ye Chen could tell with a glance that this crystal like qi flow was the rare treasure qi. He had stored some of it in his storage ring from that weapon chamber on the treasure river island. With it, he could nourish his Thunder Disaster sword and Gold sword, as even the great weapons would get worn down with time. After a long time or intense battle, they might be damaged as well. Some of the tiny cracks could not be spotted by bare eyes, and could be repaired only with treasure qi. Besides, at some level, it could even increase the quality of the weapons; for example, normal top rank weapons might get upgraded to mid or even top rank weapons.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng flew out for a couple of miles before coming back, speaking while frowning, “The speed in here is only about fifty percent of the normal speed outside.”</p><p>“The third floor is already this dangerous…I can only imagine how tough it is going to be on the fourth floor.”</p><p>…</p><p>Although the third floor was not that dangerous for the top master level warriors, it was still under the condition where the top warriors used all of their power. Even they might have a chance of dying if not being careful.</p><p>“Yeah!”</p><p>Flying at a low height, Ye Chen lifted up his head while that Gold sword had been taken out from his waist.</p><p>Dang!</p><p>The gold sword blocked out an incoming treasure light beam which came out of the blue. Ye Chen’s body shook slightly, and he could not stop his body from falling a bit. He eventually managed to regain his balance and landed onto the ground safely.</p><p>“Such a powerful attack! This attack might not reach the top master level, but it should be close…perhaps at sixty percent or so. I had stopped immediately as well, so it did not even reach fifty percent.” There was only one potential danger in this treasure world, which was the fact that the treasure light would shoot out at any second. It was all made from highly compressed treasure light which had no form or shape, and was hard to be detected even by soul power. Luckily, it was not that dense in space, and it was only their first time encountering it since stepping in this world.</p><p>“Are you okay?”</p><p>The attack happened way too suddenly. Murong Qingcheng had only tilted her head a bit before realizing that she had lost sight of Ye Chen. Her reflexes were still weaker than Ye Chen after all.</p><p>Ye Chen answered, “I am alright. This treasure qi in the air is too rich, such that it is affecting my senses. I think we should lower ourselves a bit more. That should keep us safe.”</p><p>The higher one was in the treasure qi world, the richer it would get. It meant it would affect the soul power even more. Meanwhile, there was not as much treasure qi closer to the ground, and the counter force was less as well.</p><p>Just like Ye Chen had guessed, flying closer to the ground had lowered the danger almost by half. Even when there was treasure light shooting over, the two were able to sense it in time and escape from the attack. They even had time to shatter the attack or just simply increase their speed and outrun it.</p><p>“This is the fourth level’s entrance.”</p><p>After about one or two hours, the two managed to find the entrance to the fourth level. It was a door made with treasure qi, looking extra pretty.</p><p>Whoo!</p><p>Just as the two were reaching the fourth level, the treasure qi on both sides of the door suddenly started to solidify, forming into two human figures which were both more than three meters tall. Their “eyes” looked like they were made of diamonds, shining with a bright sharp light.</p><p>Wooo!</p><p>The creature on the left flashed its body once, throwing a punch at Ye Chen. Its intense fist wind was like a blade made with steel and was extremely dense.</p><p>“Gold Pattern!”</p><p>Ye Chen did not have time to struggle with them, so he performed his top attacks. As he waved down his gold sword, the gold pattern spread out in the whole area, looking spectacular.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The creatures made out of treasure qi could not handle the blasting waves of the gold pattern attack for sure as they shattered immediately, turning back into crystal clear treasure qi.</p><p>Over on the other side, Murong Qingcheng had also been fighting with the treasure qi.</p><p>She opened her black bat wings, increasing her speed to the next level. All of a sudden, the whole area was filled with her shadows, attacking the treasure qi from different directions at once. With every three flashes, a crack would appear on the creature, which caused its body to shake drastically.</p><p>However, although the creatures did not have top master level warriors’ power, it was still getting closer after all. Although Murong Qingcheng’s attack looked very efficient, its blasting power was still not enough, and it would be impossible for her to do any severe damage to the creatures.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>“I will take care of it.”</p><p>Ye Chen could tell that it would take Murong Qingcheng a long time to take care of the spirits, so he flashed his body once, waving the gold sword in his hand as if he was just trying to open the curtains.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>Ye Chen had already used his spiritual sword attack, which cut down the “heads” of the creatures without them even having the time to react. But, what shocked him was that the creatures did not disappear. They somehow put back their heads before battling with Murong Qingcheng again, leaving him on the side.</p><p>“Perhaps this is the challenge? Taking out the creatures on one’s own?” A confusion flashed past his face and he stopped attacking.</p><p>Seeing Ye Chen stop his movements, Murong Qingcheng knew that she would have to do this on her own.</p><p>In order to not waste time, she performed the Darkness Sky to block out the incoming attacks before opening her bat wings to their limits. Beams of black flowy light traveled through her bat wings before entering her body and accumulating on her fingertips.</p><p>“Sky Demon Finger!”</p><p>As she pointed out her finger, the black finger power landed on the creature’s chest. A massive black sun appeared, and those two creatures disappeared instantly, turning into nothingness.</p><p>Breathing slightly heavily for a while, Murong Qingcheng said, “Let’s go inside!”</p><p>The Sky Demon Finger was the special demon race martial art she learned after her bloodline had awakened. It was the kind of power that she would need to use the black bat wings on her back for. It burnt out a lot with each use, so she would normally choose not to use it.</p><p>Shoo! Shoo!</p><p>With that, the two disappeared into the entrance to the fourth floor.</p><p>After the two left, some human figures appeared from nearby.</p><p>“That Ye Chen is so powerful! I could not even handle one attack of these creatures, but he could kill them instantly! Those two attacks must be his top killing attacks…So powerful!”</p><p>“Yeah, we have been here watching for a long time now. A lot of the young warriors who had entered the fourth level had used their most powerful attacks. No need to mention the top five young warriors, but that Beiming Hui and Du Gujue are also extremely powerful. They did not even have to look before throwing out an attack to shatter those creatures. Yan Fengfeng’s power has been underestimated as well…She did not even have to go back to her natural form at all. All she did was to flap those fire wings on her back before those creatures were just set on fire on their own.”</p><p>These people had been hidden nearby this whole time. For them, being able to watch top warriors performing their top attacks would be their best experience out of this trip, since they might be able to learn something from them and manage to create their own powerful attacks one day. They did not expect themselves to be just as powerful as Ye Chen and the others; but as long as they could be slightly more powerful than others at their level, they would be more than happy.</p><p>…</p><p>The fourth level was a dangerous place.</p><p>There was not much treasure qi in here, so one could actually see a lot. However, looking around the place, one could see that it was filled with countless different level creatures made with treasure qi. The power vibration coming from these creatures were sometimes strong, and at times not so powerful. The weakest of them all were equivalent to the ones guarding the fourth floor’s entrance. But, the most powerful ones were not weaker than that barbarian who was chasing after Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng, and was actually closer to demi king warrior level.</p><p>“B*stard! You have been onto me for a couple of thousand miles now!”</p><p>Only the top of the top warriors were able to come in here, but the scene was still chaotic. Some of them joined forces to fight against those creatures while some others fought on their own. There were also some warriors who were being chased by those creatures.</p><p>“Yeah, those creatures are all holding top of the top rank weapons.”</p><p>Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng had been attacked by one such creature when they first came to the fourth level world. It was almost three meters tall, holding a dark blue colored light spear in its hand. Judging from the vibration coming from that weapon, it should be extremely powerful.</p><p>Aooo!</p><p>The creature roared once before attacking the two.</p><p>Ye Chen looked the same as he held his gold sword in his hand, waving it gently. The sword wind was like a gentle breeze, but it suddenly landed heavily onto the creature’s body.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>With that, its head had been blown into the air.</p><p>Although they looked like living beings, they were more like pile of energies, since they had not formed a soul yet. It was only powered and generated by the rules of the tower.</p><p>Therefore, as long as there was enough power, anyone would be able to shatter them easily. But of course, without enough attacking power, there would be no point even after one hundred exchanges, since they could all absorb the treasure qi in the air to repair themselves.</p><p>“It is indeed a top rank weapon.”</p><p>Ye Chen studied the long spear in his hand before throwing it into his storage ring.</p><p>After that, the two did not encounter any more creatures with weapons. It seemed like it was just as Murong Zhishui had said—for those who entered the tower, it all came down to luck in the end. With good luck, one might even encounter the semi extreme rank weapons. But obviously, only with enough power could one mange to actually get it.</p><p>…</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Inside a massive valley, Yan Fengfeng studied the creatures in front of her seriously. They were actually tiny, only 180cm tall, but they shone with a bright diamond-like light all over their bodies, which was a couple times brighter than the normal ones.</p><p>The creature wore a fancy looking shield, and the vibration coming from it was extra rich. It was a demi extreme level defense shield. Couple of attacks from Yan Fengfeng had been blocked out, and she had not been able to wound it at all. She had even received a punch herself, which was something that did not happen often.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>A slight whistle was heard as she shot out into the sky and an endless blue light spread out of her body. After the light dimmed down, a massive blue phoenix appeared in the sky. Burning blue flame wrapped around its body, and even its eyeballs were burning.</p><p>Whoo!</p><p>Flapping her wings, the blue flame shot up into the sky, bringing up a powerful wind and blowing away the creatures immediately. Meanwhile, the blue phoenix turned into a beam of blue light, arriving in the high air within a second. Its massive claws grabbed onto the creatures before gently making a tearing gesture. The two “arms” of the creature had been torn down.</p><p>But, it was not the end of it, as the blue phoenix pecked onto the creature with her beak, and the head of the creature was punctured through.</p><p>The next second, the creature disappeared into the air.</p><p>It was just at the second when she was about to grab onto the shield when a beam of powerful finger power shot over, blowing away the blue shield from her hand.</p><p>“Haha! I am quite lucky after all, running into a semi extreme level article already.” On the valley wall, a young man in gold robes was standing there—it was indeed Xia Houzun.</p><p>The blue phoenix spoke in human language, “Xia Houzun, what are you doing?”</p><p>“The great treasure only belongs to whoever deserves it. You should know about this reasoning, right?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
