Some of the granules were made from the fusion of several different Yuan Qi. It could be called Astral Qi particles, or even Godlight particles.</p><p>Chen Yuxin nodded and said, “The rainbow above the lake is called Astral Qi Rainbow, and is condensed from the energies of the lake water rising up and causing friction with the Yuan Qi in the sky. Astral Qi Rainbow’s essence is nothing but the Astral Qi Particles. If you collect Astral Qi Particles, then through a special refining means, it can be refined into five-colored Thunder Shells, which can threaten late Astral Reaching experts. And, if you can harvest Godlight Particles, it can be refined into seven-colored Thunder Shells, which can explode a Sea of Soul Daoist at close range.</p><p>“So that is the case!”</p><p>When Ye Chen was at Condensing Reality realm, he once saw Luo Hanshan easily kill a Clasping Yuan expert with the silverlight thunder shell. However, this five-colored thunder shell’s might was more than ten-fold, and seven-colored thunder shell’s at least a hundred-fold.</p><p>“Senior Brother Ye, you haven’t seen five-colored thunder shell’s explosion, right? It’s beautiful!”</p><p>Chen Yuxin took out a five-colored bead and flicked, which flew out and exploded after covering a thousand meters. With that, a five-colored radiance gushed out. Shining under the sunlight, it reflected hundreds of shades. Unlike normal thunder shells, five-colored thunder shells didn’t produce any clear shockwave, only seeming to emit streaks of light. However, these streaks of light contained a great might, and could further ignite some of the nearby Yuan Qi, thus increasing its sustainability.</p><p>“It is beautiful!” Hundreds of shades were reflected in Ye Chen’s eyes.</p><p>Thereupon, Chen Yuxin took Ye Chen through the majority of scenic spots. Their time was limited, and the island was vast. Hence, they only visited the most famous ones and some below them. However, compared to outside, even the sceneries they had ignored seemed much better.</p><p>“Senior Brother Ye, this is a rather interesting Explosion Orchard. It can test reactions and insight.”</p><p>Riding the flying boat, the two arrived at a huge orchard. It was a circular expanse with a diameter of at least thirty li. In its center was a small lake brimming with various energies, clearly for the orchard’s nutrients. The orchard was filled with Explosion Trees. Ye Chen had heard about Explosion Trees, which were low grade trees. Its fruit could only be used as explosives, with a might that could not even injure an early Clasping Yuan martial artist. Of course, if taken to Ye Chen’s original world, its might could lead to mass casualties.</p><p>“How is this going to test?”</p><p>Chen Yuxin said, “The orchard is covered with a soul array, which won’t allow you to spread your soul power outside. Furthermore, you’re also not allowed to use Zhen Yuan, and can only use the power of fleshy body and instincts to run across the orchard. Whoever completes a full circle first will have higher reactions and insight.”</p><p>“Soul power locked and not allowed to use Zhen Yuan, huh?”</p><p>Ye Chen showed a trace of curiosity. Under the conditions of not being able to use these two assets, he had never tested his reactions and insight. It should be known that there was no direct connection between an individual’s reactions and insight with soul power and Zhen Yuan. The latter could only amplify one’s abilities in all respects; fleshy body and soul were the basis of an individual.</p><p>“Among the core disciples, Second Senior Brother has the strongest reactions and insight. Moreover, he has the Wind Spirit Body…But, even without employing the Wind Spirit Body, his body can be as light as a feather. Therefore, his speed is very fast, and even the Eldest Brother can’t beat him.” Chen Yuxin said.</p><p>“Oh, then what about you?”</p><p>“Me..”.? Chen Yuxin faintly smiled and said with a tinge of pride, “I can’t compare with Eldest Brother and Second Brother, but in last year’s test, I was ranked third.”</p><p>“Pretty good!” Ye Chen faintly nodded. Chen Yuxin could rank third as the fifth disciple, which meant that her potential was quite high. She might not necessarily lose to her Eldest Brother and Second Brother in a fight of same realm.</p><p>“Why don’t you try as well?” Chen Yuxin actually had her own little thoughts as well. She wished to see if Ye Chen was undeserving of his reputation or was really the most frightening sword genius of the continent as his grandfather said.</p><p>“Someone is already taking the test, so I’ll wait.” Ye Chen faintly nodded.</p><p>Seeing the former agree, a complacent expression flickered in her eyes. However, when she saw the person taking the test, she cried out in surprise, “It’s second brother, Li Feng!”</p><p>Ye Chen was also sizing up the second disciple of Dragon God Celestial Palace.</p><p>Li Feng had a clean countenance and a pair of bright eyes. His age seemed around twenty-eight years. He was wearing a cyan-colored body armor, and his exceptionally tall figure, wide shoulders, and long legs gave off an impression as if he could blow with the wind as he stood casually.</p><p>“Second brother’s last year record mark was three forty nine. I wonder what it will be this year.”</p><p>“Will probably increase to three forty five mark!”</p><p>“Hehe, as expected of Second Brother. Even the Eldest Brother’s record is three fifty five, and Fifth Sister’s mark is three sixty seven.”</p><p>Outside the orchard, a large number of disciples had gathered and were chatting. Before them was a huge marked water clock. There were a total of thousand markings. At this moment, the clock hadn’t started, and the mark rested at zero.</p><p>“Alright, you can start the clock.” Li Feng turned his head and instructed.</p><p>“Yes, Second Brother!” One person stepped forward and started the water clock.</p><p>Drip Drip</p><p>String of water drops dripped down.</p><p>Shua!</p><p>At the same time, Li Feng’s figure flickered and entered the orchard. As soon as he entered the orchard, sounds of muffled explosions quickly rose one after another…</p><p>Peng peng peng…</p><p>In a split second, dozens of explosions occurred. From the sound of explosions, it could be deduced that Li Feng had already covered several li. Even without using Zhen Yuan, his speed could exceed the speed of sound.</p><p>“So fast! Second brother’s speed is much quicker than the last time.” Chen Yuxin exclaimed.</p><p>“It is quite fast indeed!” Ye Chen nodded.</p><p>The two’s arrival attracted the majority of attention.</p><p>“It’s Senior Sister Chen. Who is with him? How come I never saw him before?”</p><p>“To have Sister Chen leading the way, he is really enviable.”</p><p>In Eastern Shallow Ocean, Ye Chen’s fame was quite small, and only a few knew about him. The people who recognized him were even smaller in number. If they found out Ye Chen’s name, perhaps a few would have heard of him.</p><p>“Greetings Senior Sister Chen! Who is he?”</p><p>A few core disciples who had good relationship with Chen Yuxin walked over and greeted her before asking.</p><p>For a moment, Chen Yuxin didn’t know how to introduce him, and could only say, “He is Ye Chen, and has come to help deal with the present situation. You may address him as Senior Brother Ye. He is an influential figure on the continent, titled Sword Master.”</p><p>“Titled Sword Master?”</p><p>Many disciples threw suspicious glances at Ye Chen. Anybody who found that a person younger than them was titled Sword Master would feel skeptical inwardly. Not speaking outright was enough face for Ye Chen. A few made unwilling greetings and retreated back.</p><p>“This Ye Chen, does any of you know him?” Upon going back, a group of disciples discussed.</p><p>“Ye Chen, I’ve heard of him. Last year when I went to the Eastern Sector, I heard people talking about him. He should be that guy!”</p><p>“What did they say?”</p><p>“You might not know, but it’s said outside that he is a genius that Patriarch values highly. From their tone, it seemed he is even more valued than Eldest Brother.”</p><p>“Impossible! There is no need to doubt Eldest Brother’s strength. Can he be stronger than eldest brother?”</p><p>“Last year, he wasn’t strong, but can’t say about this year.”</p><p>“Then that’s just an exaggeration. If he weren’t as strong, then could he have caught up to eldest brother and gained the title of Sword Master this year? I don’t believe it!”</p><p>“I don’t believe either, probably self-titled.”</p><p>“Let’s hold it for now! Second brother is about to come out.”</p><p>The distant explosion sounds started to sound increasingly closer. Then, it seemed almost seemed to combine together, attracting everybody’s attention.</p><p>Shua!</p><p>After a few moments, a figure flew out.</p><p>“Three forty mark! Too astonishing!”</p><p>Seeing Li Feng come out, everybody’s attention converged on the water clock. Discovering the scale pointing at three hundred forty marking, a huge commotion broke out.</p><p>Li Feng had already seen the mark. With his lip slightly curved upward, he glanced towards Ye Chen and Chen Yuxin, gently smiling, “Junior Sister Chen, you are also taking the test?”</p><p>Chen Yuxin shook her head and said, “Everybody knows their own condition. Compared to last year, I haven’t made much improvement. But, it’s Senior Brother Ye who wants to try. This is his first time.”</p><p>“Who is he?” Li Feng asked sizing up Ye Chen.</p><p>Chen Yuxin again introduced Ye Chen.</p><p>“Sword Master?” A sneer appeared on Li Feng’s face before he said, “You have a cultivation base of peak mid Sea of Soul realm, which is quite good. But, it’s not nearly enough to hold the title of Sword Master. If I were you, I would never have titled myself Sword Master.”</p><p>Ye Chen said, “The title of Sword Master was bestowed upon me by others…I’m merely carrying it. Whether I can hold it or not, you don’t need to worry.”</p><p>“Hehe…Young ones are sure courageous.” Li Feng smiled, his eyes filled with contempt.</p><p>Seeing his expression, Chen Yuxin couldn’t help but feel a little awkward and hurriedly changed the topic, “Senior Brother Ye, didn’t you want to take the test? Go on!”</p><p>“Alright.” Ye Chen faintly nodded.</p><p>“Just to remind you, the Explosion Fruits will explode by merely sensing vitality. You best go a little slow…Otherwise, you won’t have your clothes when you come back.” Li Feng folded his arms over his chest and said indifferently.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
