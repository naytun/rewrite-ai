An excessively rich fragrance entered his body.</p><p>“Right, Elder Yu, I have something to ask you! Do you know Xu Jing?” Ye Chen asked.</p><p>Elder Yu replied, “Of course, I won’t hide anything from you! Sect Master regards her as extremely important, not less than you. She has already been proclaimed Dragon God Celestial Palace’s goddess, with a status only inferior to Sect Master and above everyone else.”</p><p>“Goddess?”</p><p>Ye Chen’s face turned strange. He couldn’t figure out why Dragon King viewed Xu Jing so favorably. He, of course, knew she was extraordinary. However, everything must have a reason. Since he didn’t know the reason, he couldn’t be confident; he didn’t dare to be confident. In any case, Xu Jing becoming a goddess should be a good thing.</p><p>“Then you know where she is?” Ye Chen asked again.</p><p>A strange expression flickered on elder Yu’s face, “I don’t know. After the Sect Master proclaimed her as a goddess, we never saw her again. But, I can guess that she is probably undergoing closed-door cultivation. You also know that her origins are extraordinary, so much so that even Sect Master treats it as a matter of great importance. Sect Master must have his own reasons to proclaim her as a goddess, but he simply can’t tell us for the time being.”</p><p>Hearing these words, Ye Chen smiled bitterly. He thought he would be able to meet Xu Jing during this trip, but it seemed impossible now. Who knew when she would come out?</p><p>Seeing Ye Chen’s regretful face, Elder Yu said, “You are still so young, a few years doesn’t mean much. And, if you can enter Life and Death realm in the future, even one or two hundred years won’t be much.”</p><p>Ye Chen smiled faintly without replying.</p><p>“Grandpa Yu!”</p><p>As the two were just about to turn at a corner, a group of young men and women rushed over. All of them were beautiful and alluring. The woman who spoke seemed about twenty-two or twenty-three years old., wearing a palace outfit—a bluish-green gown and a green emerald hairpin on her head. Her beautiful eyes exuded longing as she greeted Elder Yu sweetly.</p><p>Elder Yu let out a smile and said, “It’s Yuxin!”</p><p>“Greetings, Elder Yu!”</p><p>“Greetings, Eighteenth Elder!”</p><p>One could tell that this group was made up of Dragon God Celestial Palace’s core disciples. The core disciples of a fifth grade sect had a different status from ordinary sects. In the latter, when one’s cultivation base reached a certain extent, they would be promoted to elders. However, in a fifth grade sect, one would be able to keep the identity of disciples. Moreover, the identity of the core disciples was not low like ordinary elders. They were only below the members of Elders Association—the same status as the inner elders.</p><p>The woman in palace gown, Yuxin, had delicate eyes, ears, nose, and a dazzling countenance. She doubtfully glanced at Ye Chen with her star-like bright eyes and said, “Grandpa Yu, who is this gentleman?”</p><p>The disciples of Dragon God Celestial Palace seldom went to True Spirit Continent, while Ye Chen was only known to the higher-ups of the palace. Thus, it wasn’t strange that they weren’t aware of his name.</p><p>Elder Yu introduced, “Ye Chen, this is the palace’s fifth disciple, Chen Yuxin. Yuxin, you people probably haven’t heard about Ye Chen, but he is the most outstanding member of the continent’s youth, or even the entire young generation, unrivaled. Moreover, he is also the first Sword Master of the continent in several hundred years, and also number one on the Masters Ranking.”</p><p>Hearing Ye Chen’s introduction, Chen Yuxin’s mouth opened in O shape. Each of the identities mentioned was shocking in itself. She knew that although they boasted themselves as extraordinary, True Spirit Continent was extremely vast. Being a part of a fifth grade sect was not that big a deal. There was the fourth grade Void Sect—their disciples could easily crush them. Their strength and talent could not be described as merely strong; they were simply frightening.</p><p>“Isn’t that a little exaggerated? His cultivation base is only at the peak of mid Sea of Soul realm.” A young man standing by Chen Yuxin had a suspicious face as he muttered.</p><p>Elder Yu stared at him and said, “From now on when you see him, treat him as a member of Elders Association or Five Hall Leaders. Keep in mind, you can’t offend him, or you’ll have to take responsibility.”</p><p>He knew these core disciples of Dragon God Celestial Palace were quite arrogant. Unfortunately, this arrogance wasn’t even worth mentioning before Ye Chen. It could even be said that Ye Chen had already become a reserve Life and Death King in the eyes of the Elders Association, which signified that they considered his chances of entering the Life and Death realm more than half.</p><p>“Greetings, Senior Brother Ye!”</p><p>Chen Yuxin seemed quite clever. She could see that although Ye Chen’s appearance was gentle and elegant, his two calm eyes exuded a thread of dense light. This thread was like a sword, a blade giving off a destructive aura that made her heart palpitate.</p><p>She, of course, didn’t know that since Ye Chen’s sword spirit had just entered the fifth step, he was unintentionally leaking a trace of it. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have been able to see through Ye Chen’s deceit, and would have only considered him as simple.</p><p>“Greetings, Junior Sister Chen! Do take care you me in future!” Ye Chen gently smiled.</p><p>“Of course!”</p><p>Chen Yuxin curiously sized up Ye Chen.</p><p>“Alright, I’m taking Ye Chen to Elders Hall. You lot can go back to your own!” Elder Yu left with Ye Chen.</p><p>As soon as the two left, the young man beside Chen Yuxin spoke unresignedly, “With just a peak mid Sea of Soul realm cultivation base, the title of Sword Master is surely either self-proclaimed, or he curried favor with someone.”</p><p>“Junior brother Chen, your cultivation base is merely at the Initial Sea of Soul realm. You don’t have the qualifications to judge him. I believe grandpa won’t say these words without any justification.”</p><p>To tell the truth, she herself was still a little doubtful. But, she believed that Elder Yu wouldn’t speak lies. Thus, there must be something more to Ye Chen than what met eyes.</p><p>“I, of course, can’t compare to him. But, eldest brother’s target is also the title of Sword Master, and he already has a cultivation base of peak late Sea of Soul realm.” The young man had always been on good terms with the eldest brother. Therefore, he couldn’t accept Ye Chen’s title of Sword Master. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been so unresigned.</p><p>“Don’t you try to create any trouble!” Chen Yuxin warned him, but her brows creased slightly. She knew that the eldest brother’s target was the title of Sword Master, and the latter was also the greatest genius of sword dao she’d ever seen. His achievements were quite frightening. By himself, he’d once slain three notorious demonic sword experts, and also all the sword geniuses under them.</p><p>It could be said that his status in Eastern Shallow Ocean was the same as Ye Chen’s status in the continent. One mountain couldn’t shelter two tigers. Sooner or later something was bound to happen.</p><p>“Let’s talk to Grandpa Yu later. He must know more inside details.” Chen Yuxin said inwardly.</p><p>…</p><p>As they approached the Elders Hall, Elder Yu said, “That lass Chen Yuxin is not bad. I’m looking forward to her growth. She is currently twenty-seven years old and has a cultivation base of peak initial Sea of Soul realm. Her strength is even higher than Sea of Soul Masters.”</p><p>Elder Yu only knew that Ye Chen was powerful and his fame surpassed the five young tycoons. However, he was not aware of the rankings of the continent’s geniuses. He thought that Chen Yuxin would rank at the top spot in the continent, and was thus feeling a little proud.</p><p>Unfortunately, Ye Chen could see that Chen Yuxin was merely comparable to Jing Aoxuan and Li Xiaoyun. There were many layers above her.</p><p>Of course, Sky Martial Region was an abnormal place. Chen Yuxin was only twenty-seven years old, thus she was by no means weak. She could definitely be regarded as a peak genius.</p><p>“Yes, she is good!”</p><p>Ye Chen’s words were the truth. As a peak fifth grade sect, even the fifth disciple had a cultivation base of initial Sea of Soul realm. One could imagine that the above positions would be even more powerful. Compared to the Mysterious Sect, the overall strength was a lot stronger.</p><p>“We’ve arrived!”</p><p>Soon, the two arrived beside a magnificent golden palace. Before the awe-inspiring great hall, two carvings of strange beasts stood at the entrance. The beasts’ hands were holding a weighing scale which looked exceptionally steady. It represented absolute impartiality, as well as the will of the Elders Association.</p><p>“Come, enter together with me.” Elder Yu didn’t let Ye Chen wait outside and directly led him to Elders Hall.</p><p>“Li Tong, sound the assembly clock.” As soon as they entered the hall, Elder Yu immediately ordered the attendant.</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>Dong!</p><p>Dong!</p><p>Dong!</p><p>A completely realistic sounding clock sound echoed out in all directions. A few moments later, the members of Elder Association started to arrive one after the other and took their seats around the table.</p><p>“He is that Ye Chen…”</p><p>“Seems so young!”</p><p>This was, after all, their first time seeing Ye Chen. Previously, they had only seen his picture. He seemed much younger than they had imagined, merely about twenty years old. This represented that Ye Chen’s progress had been exceptionally quick, and thus, had been able to preserve his appearance.</p><p>“Ye Chen, I’m surnamed Lin. We meet for the first time!”</p><p>Some elders started to greet Ye Chen. They didn’t put up any airs as members of Elders Association; before Ye Chen, they simply couldn’t. Be it status or strength, they were equal. Meanwhile, in terms of importance, Ye Chen was much higher than them.</p><p>Thump Thump Thump!</p><p>Another elder entered the hall. This elder was second only to the great elder—the second elder. He was a sword artist like Ye Chen, known as Master Silver Sword in the world outside. His weapon was a silver sword, and his strength was deep and immeasurable like the first elder.</p><p>“Ye Chen!” The second elder sized up Ye Chen</p><p>“Ye Chen, this is second elder.” Elder Yu introduced.</p><p>Ye Chen faintly nodded, “Second Elder!”</p><p>Without a word, the second elder’s figure faintly shook and a slaughter-like sword intent gushed out. The entire hall seemed to have been covered by a blood light. Within this blood light, everybody saw a different scene: some saw a mountain of corpses and blood while some saw a bloody battlefield. These scenes could shake one’s heart and spirit, plunging one’s soul into a stupor of bloating pain.</p><p>And, the majority of this sword intent was concentrated toward Ye Chen.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
