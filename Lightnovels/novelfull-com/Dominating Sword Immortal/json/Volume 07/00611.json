Those who had never seen him in person had finally seen him for the first time. As one of the top three martial geniuses, Dantai Mingyue looked over before looking at Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>“Brother Ye, someone is finally challenging you.” Hai Wuya said with a laughter.</p><p>Ling Tianhao said, “Ye Chen, don’t lose!”</p><p>Although he did not think Ye Chen’s power had reached beyond his head disciple Yan Fengfeng, who normally fought in her human form, since he was able to beat Lin Tian, he knew that Ye Chen would have something up his sleeves. This Lan Xieqing was only slightly more powerful than Lin Tian, so Ye Chen might have a winning chance.</p><p>“Lan Xieqing has a lot of thoughts. Just like his battling style, it is very tricky and unpredictable. Since he has made this ten movement battle thing, then he definitely wants to get the upper hand in those ten exchanges so that the crowd will think that he is more powerful than you.” Yan Fengfeng had seen through Lan Xieqing, so she reminded Ye Chen.</p><p>Ye Chen said, “That ten attack thing is either because he is not confident enough, or he is just too full of it. I really hope it is the latter.”</p><p>“What? Ye Chen, you do not dare to take on my challenge?” Lan Xieqing waved his fan as he walked out.</p><p>Ye Chen’s body extended, and he lightly floated down the mountain, stepping onto the surface of the lake. A light pattern appeared as he said, “The ten exchange deal is perfect for me. Let’s do this quickly.”</p><p>“Great! I would like to see exactly how powerful is one of the top five young warriors.”</p><p>In the end, Lan Xieqing was very unhappy about being stepped down. But, just as Yan Fengfeng had said, he was full of schemes. If Ye Chen were really powerful, then he would be other people’s stepping stone, which would not be something he wanted. Therefore, he offered the ten-exchange deal. Even if he did not get the upper hand, he would not have lost it.</p><p>Whoo!</p><p>Lan Xieqing performed his flying art, shooting directly toward the lake. And even before he got there, he was still waving his fan. If one ignored that hint of evilness, he was actually looking quite like a gentleman.</p><p>In the middle of the nine dragon lake, the two stood hundred meters away from each other.</p><p>“Leader Mo, this Ye Chen is also a sword user. I wonder what kind of level he is at right now.” The speaker was a master of a rank 6 martial institution in the Flowy Snow Region. He was talking to the Sword Master, the leader of the Flowy Snow Martial School.</p><p>“Although the ten exchanges are quite short, but we should be able to see something.”</p><p>Sword Master was very emotional. Earlier on when Ye Chen was being chased by the Ao warriors, he had flown past the Flowy Snow Martial School. Back then, she could have killed all of those powerful warriors with her one sword attack. But now, after a couple of years, that martial genius had already grown to her level.</p><p>“Ye Chen, take this!”</p><p>On the lake, Lan Xieqing’s body flashed as he approached Ye Chen in a curved line. The fan in his hand had been lifted up and waved out to release unpredictable shadows.</p><p>Chin!</p><p>At the same time, Ye Chen took out his gold sword and welcomed the attack.</p><p>Their first exchange was to test each other’s power. Therefore, it was not that visually impactful. But, the killing intent was rather obvious. Once they could not handle their opponent’s attack, even the simplest attack would be able to act as a fatal one.</p><p>“Fog Dream Flow!”</p><p>Lan Xieqing was an expert of the fog profound. He formed a spell with his left hand, and an endless thick fog appeared, spreading out with him being the center. Soon, it drowned Ye Chen within, turning the whole area into an ocean of fog.</p><p>“What the hell! How can we watch?”</p><p>Once Lan Xieqing performed his attack, someone from the crowd shouted out. Normal fog could not block out soul power detection, but the fog was generated with the profound sense, which would cancel out most of the soul power. Even though not all soul power would be canceled, but it would still cause them to miss some of the important details.</p><p>Fog flowers formed as Lan Xieqing stepped on them, moving extremely quickly toward Ye Chen without a sound. Each movement and step of his was extremely bizarre and indescribable. If normal warriors had a common healthy way of training martial art, then this Lan Xieqing would be walking on another path. And that would be his unique winning point.</p><p>It was Ye Chen’s first time fighting this type of a warrior. After the first couple of exchanges, he had a general understanding of the other’s battling style.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>He threw out a beam of pure sword qi which shattered the thick fog, separating the lake water.</p><p>“Haha! It is useless! Close!”</p><p>Lan Xieqing was secretly surprised by Ye Chen’s observation, since he had not only broken open his attack, but also thrown out another attack, shattering the thick fog.</p><p>“Speed Sword Hell!”</p><p>Ye Chen looked exactly the same. He had made it out from the foggy forbidden place before, and this fog attack from Lan Xieqing was just a basic version of that. He shook his wrist as he performed his fastest sword art. The sharp sword qi filled up within the thick fog before spreading out in all directions.</p><p>Looking from the outside, the whole area turned into a massive hedgehog within thousand meters of radius. The narrow sword qi was both fast and sharp.</p><p>Huh!</p><p>A groan was heard within that thick fog before a human figure was blown out. Everyone looked over and found it to be Lan Xieqing. Right then, he was looking rather sh*tty. A light footprint had appeared on his chest.</p><p>Lan Xieqing forced himself to swallow the blood that was rising up his throat. Although Ye Chen’s step did not come with any powerful martial art, the power behind it was enough to break through his protective Zhen yuan. It even followed through the armor and got into his physical body, causing severe internal damage.</p><p>“Ye Chen, I have indeed underestimated you! That was me being reckless.” Lan Xieqing had a bad look on his face.</p><p>Stepping on the lake water, Ye Chen slowly walked out the fog as he said, “Right now, it has been seven exchanges. You only have three left.”</p><p>Although Ye Chen was not a man with a small heart, if the others wanted benefit through him, he would not make it easy for them. Therefore, after performing his speed sword hell, he was able to tell the exact location of Lan Xieqing with his soul power. He approached at an extreme speed; and after exchanging two attacks, he kicked his opponent out of the fog.</p><p>Right now, anyone with a bright mind could tell that Ye Chen had the upper hand.</p><p>“Alright! It is you who pushed me to do this.”</p><p>Lan Xieqing did not plan on using everything he had. But right now, he had been pushed to have no options except bringing out everything he had to save his reputation, which he cared about the most in his life.</p><p>“Fog Ocean!”</p><p>Layers of thick fog poured out of Lan Xieqing’s back. This time, these fog was not spreading everywhere, but accumulating behind his body and connecting with his back. It turned into a small area of ocean made of fog, scrambling like real waves.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>After stepping through the lake water, Lan Xieqing shot out toward Ye Chen in a straight line, which was something he rarely did. With the support of that fog ocean behind his back, he seemed extremely powerful and invincible.</p><p>“This Lan Xieqing is indeed powerful. Not only does this fog ocean contain the fog profound, it has also combined with his aura. With that speed as aid, even the most aggressively powerful warriors would have to watch out. I just wonder what Ye Chen would do.”</p><p>The speaker was indeed one of the top three blade artists, Lin Chaonan. And, the person he was talking to was the leader of the three, Xie Baiting.</p><p>He said lightly, “Lan Xieqing still has something up his sleeves, right?” He did not think that Lan Xieqing would be able to win against Ye Chen with only his aura.</p><p>The lake water could no longer handle Lan Xieqing’s aura attack as it spread out to the sides.</p><p>“Lose!”</p><p>Lan Xieqing groaned as he attacked out his jade-like fan. At the same time, that fog ocean suddenly left his back and devoured Ye Chen as a whole. In front of that endless power of the ocean, human power seemed rather weak.</p><p>If this were a normal human being attacked by this shapeless fog ocean, he or she would panic for sure and reveal his or her weaknesses. Even the calmest person would be affected, not to mention that the attack was followed by Lan Xieqing’s extreme attacks. Therefore, Lan Xueqing would be the only person not affected, and would be free to attack his opponent.</p><p>With this kind of power canceling out each other, even stronger people would lose to him.</p><p>And this was indeed his killing attack, the combination of both the real and surreal. With the fog ocean affecting his opponent’s mind, his physical attack would land onto his opponent’s body, which would exhaust them into eventually giving up on defending.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>After one explosion sound, the center of the lake sank down for a thousand meters. On the edge of the sinkhole, the endless lake water spread out, bringing up wall-like waves.</p><p>Seeing over the waves, everyone saw Lan Xieqing’s fans being blocked out by Ye Chen’s golden sword. His fog ocean had not affected the latter at all.</p><p>“Hehe, you have lost!”</p><p>A strange look passed on Lan Xieqing’s face as his fan pressed onto Ye Chen’s gold sword and pushed forwards. A narrow sharp blade shot out of the fan, attacking right at the latter’s forehead. If he were to be stabbed by this blade, he would definitely be disfigured.</p><p>“Oh yeah?”</p><p>Ye Chen’s left hand was fast as lightning as his two fingers blocked out the sharp blade.</p><p>Because the attack was actually thrown out when it was pressed against the sword, the power was not its one hundred percent. Therefore, Ye Chen’s two fingers had not only clipped onto the sharp blade, they had also stopped the attack completely. Unless Lan Xieqing gave up on his fan, it would be impossible for him to throw out a second wave of attack in a short period of time.</p><p>“Not good!” Lan Xieqing let go of his hand immediately to back out.</p><p>Unfortunately, Ye Chen would not give him the opportunity. He held his gold sword in his right hand and waved it upwards. With that, a semicircular gold sword qi blew the other miles away. Eventually, the latter struggled to balance himself on the surface of the lake water, losing his usual cool. He puked out three mouthfuls of blood, looking extremely pale.</p><p>In the ninth movement, Ye Chen had gotten his opponent’s weapon and also managed to seriously wound him with one sword attack.</p><p>“Impressive!” The Sword master said involuntarily.</p><p>The leader of the rank 6 martial institution asked, “Leader Mo, why is this so impressive? Why do I feel that he had not really used any powerful sword attack?”</p><p>The Sword Master of Snow answered, “Because he had not used any is why it is impressive. I ask you now, can you tell if he was being serious or not?”</p><p>“No, I cannot see through him.”</p><p>“That is why…The battle between him and Lan Xieqing did not even bring out eighty percent of his power, which means he is even more powerful now than when he was battling with Lin Tian.”</p><p>Around the lake, everyone chatted away.</p><p>“Indeed the No.1 warrior right under the top five warriors. He has beaten Lan Xieqing so casually! And I did not even see what he did exactly. For example, that sword Tai Shichong had just used was horrifyingly powerful, and that despairing sword attack of Du Gujue was very depressing. Furthermore, this Fog Ocean attack of Lan Xieqing’s even contained a double killing intent.”</p><p>“He would not have gotten his title without actual power. I think no one will question his powerful in the future.”</p><p>This battle had cemented Ye Chen’s position. In the future, he would definitely still have a lot of people challenging him, but they would no longer question his power.</p><p>“Ye Chen, you are indeed one of the top opponents I have ever had.”</p><p>Du Gujue had watched the whole battle while looking extremely serious. Dantan Mingyue was a woman after all, and the battle between men and women would be still slightly different from the battle between two men. This was something fundamental, and not discriminative to women.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
