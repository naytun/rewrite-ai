For example, the ultimate martial arts, secret manuals and demi extreme rank weapons.</p><p>The warriors who were eligible for senior exchange would be Ye Chen and the other couple management warriors since the rest of the warriors would not have enough at all.</p><p>This day, Ye Chen jumped on his flying puppet and flew over towards the head quarter.</p><p>The reason he did not use the transporter was because that it would require extreme rank soul stones for that, if he continued using it for the smallest thing, the palace would be bankrupted soon enough. Although Ye Chen would not be limited by that since no one would dare to say anything, but Ye Chen would not want to do it anyways since it was not too far, it would take only about one month of time on the flying puppet. Of course, it would only be a disguise as well, once he was far enough, he wanted to use his defense sword spell flying art as well.</p><p>The latter would be Ye Chen’s fastest speed. He used it when he just learned it, but back then, his realm was not good enough yet. But now, he had already trained it to the peak level second realm already. He really wanted to try how fast the extreme speed would be like.</p><p>“Alright, right now, let’s try it!”</p><p>On the endless ocean, Ye Chen put away the flying puppet, his finger made a pulling gesture. That gold sword made a loud sound, it got pulled out automatically, floating in front of Ye Chen.</p><p>Took one step forward, Ye Chen stood on that rather wide gold sword. It was rather stable.</p><p>“Speed!”</p><p>The sword spell had been performed again, that gold sword vibrated slightly before shooting out in extreme speed like a beam of light from outer space. Meanwhile, Ye Chen who was standing on top of the sword did not look like he was affected by the speed at all. It was because that during the flying process, his feet and the gold sword had built this connection that they looked like they had been connected like roots in the ground.</p><p>“So fast! It turns out that when in extreme speed, everything around would become slower, it would not be just a blur.”</p><p>Actually, Ye Chen had thought it wrong. Normally when people increase their speed, their eye sight would not be able to follow the fast moving scenery because it would be physically impossible for them to do so. But the reason that Ye Chen could do it was because it was still far from Ye Chen’s limit since his soul power was five times more powerful than normal warriors unless his speed would increase five times more immediately, it would be impossible for him to be overwhelmed by this.</p><p>“Right now, it is about 70x light speed!”</p><p>“72x light speed!”</p><p>“74x light speed!”</p><p>“75x light speed!”</p><p>When he reached 75x light, the speed had finally stopped increasing as if there was an invisible chain.</p><p>“Too fast. The flying spell would only help me reach 50x light speed. The spell could almost increase twice as much speed. Plus, the sword light spell burns rather a lot zhen yuan. When performing defense sword flying spell would burn less zhen yuan, it should be something to do with the soul power as well.”</p><p>75x light speed would be drastic, it was like one breath would fly fifty-one miles, one hour would be three thousand six hundred thousand miles, which meant four million four thousand four hundred thousand miles after one day. In Ye Chen’s world, it meant that Ye Chen would travel around fifty circles around the earth.</p><p>“The defense sword spell flying art would need soul power, although it was nothing, but there would be problems after a long time. I think I will just keep the speed at 60x light speed for now then.”</p><p>After knowing that the highest speed would be 75x light speed, Ye Chen slowly slowed down his speed and maintained it at 60x light speed.</p><p>…</p><p>Four days later, Ye Chen came to the palace.</p><p>Without going somewhere else, Ye Chen went back to his own place on the mountain before summoning his butler Yan Zi.</p><p>“God Dragon Ambassador, you are back!</p><p>Yan Zi was a bit surprised.</p><p>“Yeah!” Ye Chen nodded, he asked, “Where is the place the palace keeps ultimate meaning arts and secret manuals? Take me there.”</p><p>“I know this. There are some secret pavilions inside the palace, there are plenty of those ancient ultimate martial arts and secret arts. Please, follow me.”</p><p>She led Ye Chen in the front.</p><p>After half an hour, the two arrived in front of a group of buildings in the center of the palace. There was a pavilion in front, with three floors. It was looking rather ancient but with a special calming vibe.</p><p>“Mister Ye, that pavilion is the secret pavilion. I cannot enter, so I could only accompany you until here.” She stopped.</p><p>“Here, take this yuan reparing pellet.”</p><p>Ye Chen took out a bottle and threw it towards her. When he was in Ye family, he learned that he would need to reward people for what they did. Therefore, he had quite a bit of those potions with him. It would help drastically for those Clasping Yuan Realm warriors to make a breakthrough.</p><p>“Ah! Thank you so much!”</p><p>Yan Zi took over the bottle with her shaky hands.</p><p>There were some in the palace as well, but it would take four hundred contribution points to exchange for it. She only had fifty something since it was the most valuable thing inside the palace. As a Clasping Yuan Realm staff, rarely anyone could make it to one hundred something points since they would need it to exchange for supplies as well.</p><p>Currently, she was already at peak level mid rank Clasping Yuan Realm. With this bottom of pellets, she would be confident enough to make a breakthrough within three months. It would save her so much time of hardwork.</p><p>Without paying attention to Yan Zi’s expression, Ye Chen walked into the building.</p><p>Outside the pavilion, there were a lot of perimeter and Ye Chen did not want to cause any trouble so he waved out his Five Dragon Tag immediately. He was not stopped at all.</p><p>Came to the door of the pavilion, Ye Chen walked upstairs.</p><p>“Stop right there.”</p><p>The guardian elder walked out.</p><p>“I am Ye Chen, the God Dragon Ambassador of the Dragon God Palace.” Ye Chen flashed his tag again.</p><p>“You are Ye Chen?”</p><p>The elder’s eyes brightened.</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>A smile appeared on his face, “Since you are the ambassador, then I do not have the right to stop you. I will lead the way for you.”</p><p>“Thank you!”</p><p>Ye Chen hesitated. He then nodded. He did not know anything about the pavilion and Yan Zi was only a Clasping Yuan Realm warrior so she could definitely not tell him anything that would be too useful. If the guardian master would lead the way for him, he would be able to save a lot of time and effort.</p><p>The elder’s last name was Tian, he was at peak level Late Seas of Souls Realm. Although he was here guarding the pavilion this whole time, but he did not have much power. But of course, members of the board would have to be respectful around him and would not dare to show him any attitude. And being able to have him as a guide, there were not that many warriors inside the whole palace had the power to do so.</p><p>“There are three floors inside the secret pavilion, the first level being the low rank ultimate meaning marital art and the earth realm top secret art, the second being the mid rank ultimate meaning marital arts and Heaven Realm low rank secret martial art, the third level would have top rank and earth Realm mid rank ones. Of course, there were not many top rank ultimate meaning marital arts, only three actually. They were all made by the leader, even for the Heaven mid rank secret art, there were only five of them.”</p><p>The leader of the pavilion counted like his own treasures.</p><p>Ye Chen said, “Let’s go to the second floor then.”</p><p>Ye Chen did not care for the ultimate meaning marital arts and secret arts on the first floor.</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>Being guided by the leader Ye Chen came to the second floor.</p><p>Although Ye Chen had come here for the secret art, but since he was here, he decided to look around since all ultimate meaning martial arts had their own special parts. He might be able to learn something or get some kind of inspiration during the whole process.</p><p>Both the ultimate meaning and secret arts were carried inside the jade bottle, one would not be able to read directly, but right next to the bottle, there would be a thin booklet where would include all of the related information which allowed potential buyers to see what would be inside.</p><p>Ye Chen picked out a mid rank wind ultimate meaning martial school randomly. He opened it up.</p><p>“Wind DragoN Shatter, Wind Ultimate menaing marital arts, using wind as the source… forming into a dragon shape… its agility and power is very special. It would shoot out nine beams of dragon shaped qi flow after train to completion. The user could use it as both attack and defensing. Mid rank ultimate meaning could be ranked at three stars.</p><p>“Four stars? There is a ranking for the ultimate meaning martial arts here?”</p><p>Ye Chen asked.</p><p>The elder said, “Ultimate meaning martial arts within the same realm would have different ranking as well, according to the effects of the ultimate meaning and power, we have put them in a five star scale with one star being the lowest. It would be like the ones that had been created by warriors who could just create them, while two stars would be an average standard. With three stars would be already rather high. Most of the Seas of Souls Realm master warriors would only create one three star mid rank ultimate meaning martial art and they would already be proud. Only extremely talented warriors would create four star ultimate meaning martial arts. Five star would be the highest ranking, warriors who could create those would be one of the top warriors.”</p><p>“I see.”</p><p>Ye Chen secretly thought to himself, “My Gold Pattern should probably be at four star. The thunder devour might be leaning towards top rank ones, but it is not completed yet so it would only have forty to fifty percent power.”</p><p>Secretly nodded, the rating inside the secret pavilion was really practical and useful. For those of who could not create ultimate meaning martial arts on their own yet would need extremely long time to train a five star marital art which might end up being a completely waste of time. But if they were to choose an one-star martial art then it would be way much easier.</p><p>After that, Ye Chen checked out a lot more of the mid rank ultimate meaning martial arts. The ones on the second floor of the pavilion were mostly two to three stars. There were not many one-star ones, definitely way lesser four-stars. As for five-star, there were less than one percent.</p><p>Compared to the ultimate meaning marital arts, there were way less Heaven Realm low rank secret arts.</p><p>The reason that they were secret arts were because that they were not public ones that were available for everyone. It made them dozens times more valuable. Therefore, the second floor of the secret pavlilion would have the Heaven Realm low rank ones which was one realm lower than the mid ultimate meaning martial arts.</p><p>“Tiger Body! Heaven Realm low rank secret art!”</p><p>“Mysterious Spirit Eye!”</p><p>“Demon Cow Mountain Shattering Spell!”</p><p>…</p><p>Although there were not many secret arts, but it had taken Ye Chen a long time to go through. Amongst which, the Tiger Body Art was a secret art that trained the bones, after trained, the bones would become so tough and it would not be easy to break. While the Mysterious Spirit Eye was a secret pupil art. After training, one could observe the natural yuan qi with his or her bare eyes. It would allow the user to see the zhen yuan route within the opponents as well. It would be an extremely useful aiding secret art. The last one would be even more valuable than the first two, it was a secret art that trained power, if there were a body training warrior here, then he or she would definitely have picked it.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
