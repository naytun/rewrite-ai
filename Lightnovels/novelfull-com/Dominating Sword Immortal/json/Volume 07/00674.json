Being inside the war chariot meant having an extra layer of protection, and this layer of protection extended to several dozens of people. On the battlefield, having an extra layer of protection meant having a higher chance of survival, and thus, higher potential of killing enemies.</p><p>Not to mention ordinary experts, even Ye Chen wouldn’t be able to resist the assault of thousands of experts. If he tried to do it the hard way, he would simply be courting death.</p><p>Storing away the Golden Chariot, the two left the Treasury.</p><p>“Dragon God Envoy, you can set off three days later. There will be several core disciples as well as dozens of inner disciples following you. If possible, try to save a few.” Elder Yu was clear on how frightening Ye Chen was to defeat Li Feng with a mere fingertip. Even the Great Elder said that Ye Chen’s strength was not below his. With his strength, keeping a few disciples alive wouldn’t be a problem.</p><p>“I’ll try my best.” Ye Chen nodded slightly.</p><p>“That’s good! This is a high level elixir that can increase the rate of Zhen Yuan recovery with minimal side effects. Great Elder told me to give it to you.” Elder Yu took out a cyan-colored bottle from his storage ring and handed it over to Ye Chen.</p><p>Accepting the bottle, Ye Chen opened it and took a whiff. An aroma that caused his Zhen Yuan to soar assaulted his nostrils. This was a semi extreme grade medicine with extremely low side effects. One couldn’t even find such a medicine in the market. Only a fifth grade sect would have such high quality medicine. Moreover, even fifth grade sects’ reserves were scarce on such medicines.</p><p>“Good stuff!” Ye Chen stored the elixir away unceremoniously.</p><p>…</p><p>Three days later at the break of dawn, Ye Chen arrived at the designated location—a grand and majestic hall. On the hall’s roof was a winged-dragon sculpture, which seemed as if desirous of spreading its wings and soaring into the skies.</p><p>This hall was the Conveyor Hall, which could take one to any of the five great halls. Of course, it was only used under special circumstances. After all, it consumed top quality spirit stones, which were a precious resource even for a fifth grade sect. Usually, it was only used when a fixed number of people were present.</p><p>Upon entering the hall, Ye Chen saw five conveyor gates. These conveyor gates were much bigger than normal ones. The ten meters wide and twelve meters high conveyor gates could instantly transport dozens of people each. To the left of the first conveyor gate stood all the members of the Elders Association, and to the gate’s right stood several young disciples of Dragon God Celestial Palace, including Chen Yuxin.</p><p>“Dragon God Envoy!” Great Elder greeted with a nod.</p><p>Ye Chen said, “We can set off then?”</p><p>“If you don’t have anything else to take care of, we can begin now.”</p><p>“In that case, let’s go!”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Great Elder cleared his throat and turned toward Chen Yuxin and the other disciples, “This operation will commence with Dragon God Envoy as the leader. Heed all his orders, and if you don’t, you’ll be dealt according to sect rules. Well then, go in together.”</p><p>The conveyor gate was quite wide, and dozens of disciples entered without any congestion. As he was entering the gate, great elder’s voice entered Ye Chen’s ears, “Dragon God Envoy, everything depends on you now.”</p><p>Ye Chen’s body had already half-entered the whirlpool when his fleeting voice could be heard, “Don’t worry, wait for the good news!”</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>The whirlpool violently spun, and Ye Chen’s figure disappeared along with other disciples. Outside the gate, Elder Yu sighed, “I hope they’ll return safely. It doesn’t matter even if they’re defeated.”</p><p>“Don’t say such disheartening words. If they lose, their chances of coming back are pretty slim. We can only hope for their success.”</p><p>“Right, hope for their success!”</p><p>…</p><p>The conveyor gates inside the hall were not different than other conveyor gates outside in just their appearance, their process of transportation also differed. The normal conveyor gates were just like entering a five-colored light passage, allowing one to travel at an extremely high speed. And while the conveyor gates inside the hall also used the principal, it further covered the people inside into a vesicle of primal chaos, which allowed those inside to talk.</p><p>“Senior Brother Ye, this is my Eldest Brother Lin Canghai, and this is my Eighth Junior Brother Luo Yunsong.” Chen Yuxin introduced the two core disciples beside her. To her right was a rather young and gentle but ordinary looking youngster, and to her left was a stern-faced young adult. His face was expressionless, and his two star-like eyes were flickering with a cold light, like two streaks of sword Qi. They seemed extremely invasive and aggressive, and were giving off a sharp and suppressive feeling.</p><p>“Senior Brother Ye!”</p><p>The gentle-looking Luo Yunsong faintly nodded toward Ye Chen. He’d already heard about Ye Chen defeating Li Feng, and thus, had quite the admiration for him. Moreover, Ye Chen was already the Dragon Good Envoy, and was about to become Azure Dragon Palace’s deputy. Him addressing Ye Chen as Senior Brother couldn’t be more proper.</p><p>“Junior brother Luo!” Ye Chen greeted him with a faint smile.</p><p>“Ye Chen!” Lin Canghai raised his head and looked at the other. He didn’t address Ye Chen as Senior Brother. As the prime disciple, it was impossible for him to address Ye Chen as Senior Brother even if the latter’s status was higher than his.</p><p>On this point, Chen Yuxin and Luo Yunsong felt that it was proper, and Ye Chen also thought the same. If he did so, even he would feel a little awkward. After all, the ages of the former two had a difference of merely one or two years from Ye Chen’s, whereas the latter was much older than him. His age was more or less the same as that of the five young tycoons.</p><p>Ye Chen looked at him silently.</p><p>“Li Feng is not that good, letting himself be mocked by you.” His tone changed as he continued, “But, as his eldest brother, I have to get him justice. Of course, I won’t be unscrupulous. And with my style, I also won’t recklessly create trouble for you. So, you can be rest assured.”</p><p>“It’d be best if you think like that.” Ye Chen had heard a few of Lin Canghai’s achievements. If he were the Sword Master of the continent, the latter was the top candidate of Eastern Shallow Ocean’s Sword Master title, and was unrivaled amongst the sword artists here.</p><p>Lin Canghai continued, “However, on the battlefield, I myself will not heed your orders, and I must get justice for Li Feng as well. In that case, let’s compare who can kill more. Whoever kills more will have the say over the other. Do you dare to compete?”</p><p>“Compare who kills more?” Ye Chen lightly smiled, declining to give his opinion, “I don’t care if you don’t heed orders, but if you impact others, I’ll have the authority to detain you despite you being the prime disciple. I hope you’re clear on this. As for who kills more, you can compete if you want to…I don’t mind.”</p><p>“So, you’re agreeing?” Lin Canghai’s brows creased slightly, somewhat dissatisfied with Ye Chen’s attitude. It seemed as if the latter didn’t care much about this matter at all.</p><p>“You can take that as a yes.” Ye Chen didn’t wish to argue over this matter.</p><p>“Eldest Brother and Senior Brother Ye competing over kills?!” Chen Yuxin and Luo Yunsong exchanged glances, feeling a slight anticipation. Such a scene would be extremely thrilling and spectacular.</p><p>As for the win and loss, they couldn’t bet on either.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
