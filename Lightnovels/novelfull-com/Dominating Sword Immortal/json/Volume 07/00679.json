There were thirty people and two rank 10 black octopus beasts who had been decimated like nothing in front of the latter; they did not have a chance to fight back at all. At the same time, Ye Chen continued to maintain that relaxed attitude of his, along with that peacefulness like nothing could ever go wrong.</p><p>The more peaceful he seemed, the more frightened Xing Meilian felt.</p><p>‘Second palace leader Ye’s power is already not something I can imagine. Perhaps he has already reached demi king warrior level? But judging from the surface, I don’t think he has. But who knows what else he’s been hiding.’ Xing Meilian did not know exactly how powerful demi king level warriors were, just as she did not know exactly how powerful Ye Chen was. But in her eyes, Ye Chen was way more powerful than master level Seas of Souls Realm warriors. So, even if he were not at the next level yet, he would not be that far.</p><p>Ye Chen being this powerful had finally calmed Xing Meilian down a bit. As long as there were not too many enemies out there, there should not be too much danger for them. However, the two did not run into any more opponents.</p><p>In the evening time, the two finally went back.</p><p>…</p><p>The days inside the Azure Dragon Palace were very peaceful, but it was only temporary. Once a battle broke out, it would turn into a life and death situation. Therefore, no one was complaining about the peacefulness they were having. They would rather live this kind of life for a bit longer, so that they would have the time to ameliorate their power.</p><p>On that day, a staff member came to Ye Chen’s residence: it was the leader of the Azure Dragon palace, Wei Longtao. He asked the latter to come meet them in the palace for some business.</p><p>On arriving at the palace, Ye Chen saw that the other two deputy palace leaders were there as well.</p><p>“Second palace leader Ye.” Wu Chuan and Xu Danian greeted Ye Chen. The latter greeted them back as well.</p><p>On the top seat, Wei Longtao saw that Ye Chen had come, so he said, “Alright, everyone! I asked you to come this time because I have an important mission for you. However, this is a rather difficult one, so a single person’s power will not be enough. It will take at least two men. Therefore, you guys should discuss this over and decide whom to send over.”</p><p>Xu Danian asked, “Leader, what is the mission?”</p><p>“The resources in the Five Gold Island, the No.1 volcano, and the Mysterious Spirit Island are about to run out. I need you to ship them back.” Wei Longtao’s voice was very calm, but it still caused Wu Chuan and Xu Danian to frown.</p><p>These three islands were important resources. Countless essential items came out from there: the Five Gold Island commonly provided the five rare metal rocks, the No.1 volcano provided a lot of mid rank Fire Cloud Stones, while the Mysterious Spirit Island had three mid rank spirit fountains. Two of those were top mid rank ones, and one was peak one. It was easy to imagine exactly how difficult this mission would be, since the more resources one transported, the more dangers one might face. During all these years, at least five out of ten missions had been disastrous, three of them turning into life and death situations.</p><p>“This kind of major mission cannot happen without me, Wu Chuan!” He stood out without thinking, declaring his attitude.</p><p>Xu Danian let out a long breath and said with a deep voice, “Second leader Hu, Hu Wenhai’s death has been pressuring on me. It will be alright if I do not run into the top four dark power parties, but if I do, I will kill them all. So, I will have to go this time.”</p><p>The two had made their minds clear, leaving behind only Ye Chen.</p><p>“Second palace leader Ye, this is your first time here, so you probably do not know your way around here yet. I think it might be best for you to sit this one out and leave the opportunity for us.” Wu Chuan said.</p><p>Ye Chen said lightly, “I came to help the palace to save the situation. As for the ways inside the Blood Battle Ocean, I think I already have the hang of it. Second palace leader Wu and Xu, you two should discuss about it again and decide who should go this time, since there are only two positions here.”</p><p>“Eh!”</p><p>The two did not think that Ye Chen would reject so quickly, but they did realize his reasoning. After all, they did not come here for fun, and were here for business. But truthfully, the two did not think Ye Chen could make much of a difference. It was not an underestimation of his power; in fact, the two would not dare to think that at all. But, it was more about the tricky mapping of the place, and not something that one or two warriors could change.</p><p>“Never mind! You go then, second palace leader Xu! There must be another chance in the future.” Wu Chuan backed out.</p><p>“Thank you then!” Xu Danian held his fists together to show his gratitude.</p><p>Wei Longtao saw that the three had finished discussing, so he took out two palm-sized black bags which were filled with items. He shook his wrist, and the two bags landed in both Ye Chen and Xu Danian’s hands, “Same rules, ten mid rank storage rings each, fifty low rank ones. All of the resources and required items should be put in them, every single one of them filled to the maximum.”</p><p>Xu Danian explained to Ye Chen, “Second palace leader Ye, these are the resource storage rings. After they are filled up, all of the jewels would light up. Moreover, there is a spell on them as well. So, one can only fill things in, but not take things out.”</p><p>Ye Chen nodded, knowing that it was to prevent people from just leaving with everything. As for the quantity of the things, they would definitely check everything.</p><p>“You should leave first thing tomorrow morning. Remember, do not tell anyone else about the mission. Otherwise, we will punish you according to the rules.”</p><p>“Yes!” With that, the three turned to leave the palace.</p><p>Deep in the night, it was cold and almost frosty. In a fancy looking huge bathroom, a person was facing a light with his back. He took out a horn shaped metal item and poured in the Zhen yuan, which gently lit up.</p><p>“What? Another mission?” A voice somehow came through the horn shaped item.</p><p>“Indeed!” The voice was really strange, seeming to have been modified.</p><p>“Very well, speak it out!”</p><p>“This time, I want ten king level spirit power stones.”</p><p>“What! Are you crazy? You really think a couple hundred people and a batch of resources can be worth ten king level spirit power stones?” The voice sounded a bit angry.</p><p>The owner of the horn seemed calm, “The head disciple, fifth and eighth disciple, and the most valued martial genius of Dragon King—Ye Chen—plus seven hundred people’s lives and a big batch of extra resources…Would it be worth ten king level spirit power stones?”</p><p>The other side went silent. It was after a long while before the voice responded, “You have to know that those stones are only found inside king warrior ruins. In the rest of the land, the quantity of these spirit stones is limited. Five king warrior level spirit power stones and fifty top rank spirit stones…How about that?”</p><p>“Alright, deal!’ A smile appeared on the warrior’s face as he told the voice every detail of the mission.</p><p>…</p><p>On the second day morning, the school was filled with people. At that moment, Ye Chen and Xu Danian arrived one after another.</p><p>Seeing that Lin Canghai was also amongst the crowd, Ye Chen nodded slightly. If the former did not come this time, then Ye Chen would have had to teach him a lesson.</p><p>Without saying more, Ye Chen and Xu Danian said, “Let’s go!”</p><p>Shoo! Shoo!</p><p>The two flew out first, turning into a beam of light and shooting out into the distance. Behind them were seven hundred people following closely.</p><p>Soon, everyone disappeared into the horizon.</p><p>…</p><p>Over that endless ocean were countless islands. The big ones would take a long while to fly over while the small ones would only need a blink of an eye.</p><p>In front of the group, Xu Danian and Ye Chen flew right next to each other.</p><p>“Second palace leader Ye, the Five Gold island and the Mysterious Spirit Island are really close to each other…only a couple hundred miles away. However, the No.1 volcano island is a bit further. You and I should go to the Five Gold island and the Mysterious Spirit island first, then we can regroup and go to the third one. What do you think?” Xu Danian suggested.</p><p>“Alright!” Ye Chen agreed, not seeing any problem in that plan.</p><p>“Then, I will go to the Five gold island and you can go to the mysterious spirit island. I think you know where to go, right?”</p><p>“I had been there around half a month ago.”</p><p>That time, Xing Meilian had taken him to a lot of the important islands. Therefore, the location of those islands was known to him very clearly. He also knew about the surrounding ocean as well, including where all the enemy islands were.</p><p>“We are almost there…I wish you all the best!”</p><p>The palace was almost on the edge of the Blood Battle Ocean. Therefore, the distance to the Five Gold Island and the Mysterious Spirit Island from the Azure Dragon Palace was only sixty or seventy thousand miles. Within two days, the crowd had already made it to their destination. If it were not for the fact that there were a lot of Astral Reaching Realm warriors in the group, it would have taken them even lesser time.</p><p>Half an hour later, seven hundred people had been separated into two groups—one of them was Xu Danian’s group while the other was Ye Chen’s. The two groups flew toward</p><p>different directions.</p><p>“Another hour to the destination…Let’s hurry up!” Ye Chen turned around and said.</p><p>“Increase the speed!” Xing Meilian trusted Ye Chen the most right now, so she helped pass on the messages.</p><p>Hearing him, everyone could not care about the amount of Zhen yuan being used. They started to swallow Zhen yuan recovering pellets to increase their speed.</p><p>Soon, the Mysterious Spirit Island was reached.</p><p>There were thousands of people in charge of collecting resources on the island, and another group of people from the palace was here as well.</p><p>The Dragon Godly Heaven Palace and the four opposing parties had reached an agreement, all of the resources and staffs could not rob or harm other warriors. Therefore, attacks might happen only during transportation, since everyone had their own resources and staffs in the same area. If one party decided to do anything bad, then other parties would return the “favor”, and everyone would walk away with nothing. It would be something that no one would want to see.</p><p>The Dragon Godly Heaven Palace used to have one thousand and two hundred spirit fountains in that area. But, because two hundred of them had been surrounded by opposing parties, which was not a geographically favorable location for doing anything, they lost them eventually. The opposing parties had just taken over the islands in the end, but they did not harm the people on the islands. Instead, they shipped everyone onto the Dragon Godly Heaven Palace island, which the palace had silently agreed to as well. After all, there would be more consequences if they tried to fight against them with force. The innocent people would not have been safe in that case either.</p><p>There were three spirit fountains on the Mysterious Spirit Island, and all of the collected resources had been piled up inside a cave. Once they walked in, they could immediately feel the nourishing qi inside, which was a sign that the spirit qi was too dense. People without enough cultivation could not handle the environment at all. They would be filled up with the spirit qi immediately and break all of the meridians.</p><p>“Second palace leader, the spirit stones are all here!” The man in charge said politely.</p><p>“Alright!” Ye Chen nodded, then took out a mid rank storage ring and made a grabbing gesture. With that, mountain sized spirit stones were put inside instantly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
