Since the  people in the Murong family did not really have much contact with the  outside world, and neither was Chu Zhongtian the kind of person who  loved to spread news, there were not many people out there who knew  about this battle.</p><p>As for Beiming Hui, he would not tell anyone really the fact that he  had just lost to Ye Chen. Although he was not afraid of losing, there  would be no point in telling if no one knew. Those young warriors who  always traveled with him were all afraid of upsetting him, so they  naturally would not say anything either. They only told some of their  best friends, which made the whole process of spreading the news extra  slowly.</p><p>Time went fast in the world of warriors, especially for those of who had already grown older than three hundred years old.</p><p>Within the blink of an eye, another month had gone by.</p><p>On this day, Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng left for the Treasure Holy Tower inside the martial region.</p><p>…</p><p>The Treasure Holy Tower, a historic tower from the ancient era, had  become the holy place for the warriors in the world after all this time.</p><p>It was located on that Decapitating Peak of the Prison Dragon  Mountain inside the region. The mountain was known as an evil mountain,  since it was a place used to oppress the godly ancient dragon, and hence  the name. The peak the tower was on was even more famous, since it  connected to endless hills which made it look like the corpse of a  dragon. Reaching the “dragon neck”, it was “chopped off” as if it was  done by someone. Hence the name of the peak was not referring to the  human head, but the head of the dragon.</p><p>On the Decapitating Peak, a seven floored treasure tower was looking  extra obvious. If one looked closely, just the light itself was of seven  different colors, in the order of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and  purple.</p><p>On top of the first floor entrance were three massive Chinese characters written on top in gold—Mysterious Holy Tower.</p><p>Indeed, it was actually called the Mysterious Holy Tower instead of  the Treasure Holy Tower. But, because there were a lot of treasures  inside, it was commonly referred to as the latter.</p><p>It was dawn, and there were already some people who came to the tower  and had entered within. Soon, there were more and more people entering,  all of whom were young warriors below the age of forty. Some of them  came alone while the others came in groups, but they all looked like  they did not trust anyone; so, there were not many groups after all.</p><p>When the first beam of the sunshine landed on the ground, a powerful  warrior entered the scene—it was indeed Lu Shaoyou, the Sword Master. He  glanced at the fourth color shining on the tower and flashed his body,  turning himself into a flying sword and entering the first floor’s  entrance.</p><p>Then there was Bai Wuxue, and right after him was Xiao Chuhe.</p><p>Shoo! Shoo!</p><p>They flew toward different directions as two beams of light shot  over. Looking from afar, it was not hard to tell that those two beams of  light were wrapping around two womanly figures.</p><p>When the light disappeared, two ladies appeared on the two mountains  right in front of the decapitating peak. One of them was Yan Fengfeng  while the other looked scary on first glance, but with an unbelievably  great body.</p><p>It was the Godly Shark Princess!</p><p>Yan Fengfeng glanced at that cold-looking lady.</p><p>It was indeed the most mysterious warrior among the top five young  warriors, the Godly Shark Princess, who was rarely spotted. Only at  places that could potentially increase battling power as such might she  be spotted. Normally, it was impossible to find her.</p><p>At the same time, she was looking the former as well. She could  already tell that Yan Fengfeng was no human, and just like her, she was  also a beast.</p><p>Unlike her, the Godly Shark Princess had already reached rank 10  while Yan Fengfeng was still at rank 9. But, she would not dare to  underestimate her at all, since she could sense that powerful vibe off  her. It would not be hard to imagine that her original form would be  even more powerful.</p><p>The two exchanged a look but did not say anything. Then, they flew  into the tower one after another, disappearing in the first floor’s  entrance.</p><p>As the sun rose up, more and more famous young warriors arrived here.</p><p>There were Lan Xieqing, Lin Tian, Lin Ku, Luo Haisong, Hai Wuya, and  Du Gujue, who was the talk of everyone right now. There were also  Beiming Hui and Chu Zhongtian, as well as Dantai Mingyue in red robes  and a red veil.</p><p>“So many people are here! Almost all of the famous ones are here.” In  the not far groups were three people standing together—Jing Aoxuan, Li  Xiaoyun, and his girlfriend You Xin.</p><p>Jing Aoxuan and Li Xiaoyun were both at master level already, while  Li Xiaoyun’s girlfriend had already started to train Zhen yuan, and was  currently at Mid rank Astral Reaching Realm. In such a short couple of  years, going from someone who had never trained Zhen yuan to this level  would have to be thanked to the fact that she had a powerful soul and  will power. Added with Li Xiaoyun’s full support, she had access to  everything, which made the whole process of her reaching Mid Astral  Reaching Realm not unreasonable at all. After all, she mainly cultivated  will power, and Zhen yuan for her was only an enhancement.</p><p>“With our power, it might be hard to move into the fourth level. So,  we will just stay on the third floor I think.” Jing Aoxuan had never  given up. She believed that she would stand right next to the top  warriors in the Sky Martial Region one day, but just not now. With her  comprehensive ability and talent, she might not be the top of them all,  and her physical talent was not as significant as Chu Zhongitan’s,. So,  all she had was just her hard work.</p><p>Li Xiaoyun was just like Jing Aoxuan who was also quite open with  these kinds of things, “The third floor is not that bad either. The  chance of getting top rank weapons is not small there. If we are lucky  enough, we might be able to get a set of top rank weapons!”</p><p>On the first floor of the tower were only high rank weapons, and  there would be a slight chance of getting some top rank weapons on the  second floor. Meanwhile, it would be more likely to get high rank  weapons on the third floor, but there would also be a small chance of  winning a whole set. As for the fourth level, semi extreme level weapons  and full set of high rank weapons were all on the table. But, it would  be extremely dangerous, and only top rank master level warriors would  have a chance of saving themselves. If they were not lucky, then even  the top master warriors could die. Normal master level warriors would  definitely face critical moments of life and death.</p><p>Waiting until the three entered the tower, two people walked over  while holding hands— they were indeed Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>“This is the Treasure Holy Tower!” It was Ye Chen’s first time coming here.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng said, “Do you think that the tower itself is like a  weapon? But obviously, more powerful than most great weapons.”</p><p>“Yeah!”</p><p>Ye Chen could also sense that the colorful light around the tower had  got some kind of energy vibration, but it was already almost  solidified, which was way much more powerful than most of the extreme  weapons. It would be hard to imagine what exactly was causing all this.</p><p>No wonder that even if Life and Death Realm warriors could not force their way in.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>A beam of gold light shot out, and Ye Chen turned his head to look, “It is Xia Houzun!”</p><p>Xia Houzun wore gold robes, and his hair had been tied up with a  golden crown. He had a similar style as Beiming Hui, whose choice of  color was silver instead. However, he was even more aggressive looking.  With his expressions, the golden light looked like it was leaking out of  his body. That intense aura did not decrease because of the loss to Bai  Wuxue at all.</p><p>Obviously, Xia Houzun had recognized Ye Chen, since he was the only  warrior who was considered comparable to the top five young warriors. It  would be a lie if Xia Houzun said that he did not recognize Ye Chen,  but it was only at the level of recognition after all. For him, no one  in the next couple of years had the chance of competing with the top  five young warriors, even if it were the most powerful martial genius in  the world. That Lin Tian, who was the talk of the most likely new  replacement of the top five young warriors, had been beaten by Xiao  Chuhe easily within three attacks as well.</p><p>Therefore, Ye Chen right now was not worthy for him to be taken seriously.</p><p>He did not stay a second longer before flashing his body and turning  into a beam of lightning, disappearing in the first floor’s entrance.</p><p>“Let’s go in as well.” With that, Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng entered together.</p><p>…</p><p>The tower was named “Mysterious” for a reason. The first floor of the  tower was like a small world on its own; it was a world of lava.  Looking over, wherever the sight went was covered by dark red burning  lava, its heat intense enough to set any powerful Astral Reaching Realm  warrior on fire. Under the protection of their Zhen yuan defense, most  of the powerful Seas of Souls Realm warriors would still feel the heat  and discomfort, and start sweating like crazy.</p><p>“So hot!”</p><p>Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng could feel the change of temperature the  second they stepped foot into the first floor. Only after activating  their Zhen yuan layer did the two start to feel better.</p><p>“Luckily, we can go outside any time we want, or try to go up to the  second floor. If we had to be stuck in here for a couple of months, it  would be absolute torture.”</p><p>After flying for a bit of distance, they could see one or two human  shadows. One of them had the ice element Zhen yuan around it, and the  warrior did not seem to be suffering at all.</p><p>Ye Chen chuckled a little and continued to move forward.</p><p>This world of flames was filled with red qi flow, and there would  constantly be burning aerolites coming down from the sky. They caused  friction with the air, bringing up waves after waves of burning hot  flames. The higher one got, the more falling aerolites there would be.  Although Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng could handle them, they would not  want to challenge it still. So, they moved forward closer to the lava,  maintaining a height of one hundred meters.</p><p>Splash!</p><p>A wave suddenly exploded up from the lava lake as a fire elemental  beast jumped out. It was covered in red scales, and it attacked right at  Murong Qingcheng who was closer.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Murong Qingcheng threw out a palm attack toward the head of the beast, slamming it back into the lava lake.</p><p>“Very high defensive power.”</p><p>She frowned. That palm attack she threw out was struck with about  fifty percent of her full power, but the beast was still not wounded  somehow. It was safe to assume that it had a very powerful defense. The  first level of the tower was already not easy to make it through.</p><p>“This is the entrance to the second floor.” Ye Chen saw a white door in the midair, leaking out cold air.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>The two swiftly entered the door.</p><p>Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!</p><p>It turned out to be a world of ice. The temperature had changed  drastically from the burning hot to icy cold. In this white world, the  two looked extra small, vaguely visible under that thick snow.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>An ice elemental snake crawled out of the ice surface before jumping  into the air, letting out a cold beast qi. If not careful, it might  actually get one unaware.</p><p>Taking out the gold sword, Ye Chen casually snapped off the head of the ice snake.</p><p>“Huh? Ice spirit! Top rank weapon!”</p><p>That snake beast was not a normal beast; it was actually a spirit  formed from ice yuan qi, so snapping off its head could not kill it at  all. That light shining from the wound of that snake was actually a  weapon.</p><p>Grabbing onto it, Ye Chen wondered, “Perhaps all of the beasts in this tower have a weapon inside their body, eh?”</p><p>Ye Chen had guessed it wrong.</p><p>The hidden weapons inside the tower were not all predictable. They  were scattered everywhere in different forms. Perhaps a weapon might  appear if one cracked open an ice mountain; perhaps there might be a  weapon if one dove into the ground. As for inside the beast’s body,  there were rarely any weapons, and this ice snake was just an exception.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
