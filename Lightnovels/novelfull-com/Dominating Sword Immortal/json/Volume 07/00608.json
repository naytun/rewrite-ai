Therefore, although they were slightly worried, they did not do anything about it. Anyway, even if they did know about it, there was nothing they could really do.</p><p>The Eye of Soul could only last for a short period of time, so Ye Chen had to move fast. Therefore, the second he opened his eyes, he waved out a sword attack toward two killers that were not that far away from him. It was indeed the Gold Pattern that he had figured out not long ago.</p><p>Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!</p><p>A couple of beams of scattered gold sword qi spread out like river patterns, and next, these two killers were decapitated. Blood did not pour out from wound, as it somehow had all been sealed within their bodies. It was indeed why the Gold Pattern was so scary; the power was so intense and none of it leaked out at all.</p><p>“Go die!”</p><p>Ye Chen’s sharpness had made the killers panic a bit. One of the killers who had hidden quite well could no longer hold back his temper, and his body revealed from the rest of them. He had two ghost claws which shone with dots of light. All of a sudden, dozens of claws slashed out of nowhere.</p><p>“Reverse Sky Thunder Cut!”</p><p>Ye Chen did not panic at all, his left had reaching toward his waist, holding onto his gold sword backward before waving out one sword attack. The ink blue sword light was extremely shiny.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>The claw shadow separated and a red mark appeared on the assassin’s face. The next second, blood started to pour out of the red line as the assassin was separated in two halves, the edges blurred.</p><p>“Is he a person or a ghost?”</p><p>The remaining assassins saw what had just happened and started panicking for real. Until now, they had not even touched Ye Chen at all, and the latter had already killed six of them who used to be ghost killers targeting only Sea of Souls Realm master level warriors. However, their reputation had now ended in Ye Chen’s hands. So far, they had not even come up with a successful method of killing Ye Chen still.</p><p>“Do not struggle with him! Use all your strength to capture that woman!”</p><p>Finally, these killers figured out that assassinating Ye Chen would be almost impossible at this point. Only by capturing Murong Qingcheng, they might have a chance. In the worst case scenario, they could use her to finish this mission since the mission itself was separated into two parts—one part involving killing Ye Chen while the other part was to bring in Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!</p><p>All the killers from Ghost Shadow Pavilion jumped at Murong Qingcheng. As for those who did not have real bodies, they started to surround Ye Chen, stopping him from trying to save her. At that moment, she was forced to be separated from him.</p><p>“Dark Sky!”</p><p>However, Murong Qingcheng was not the kind of warrior who would just wait to be captured. Although her martial art could not stop the black shadows, it could effectively block out those killers.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Exploding sounds were heard.</p><p>“Ghost Shadow Stab!”</p><p>One of the powerful killers broke through the black layer of blockage with an evil look on his face. His body flashed once as his whole body made through.</p><p>“You little bit*h! Once I got a hold of you, I will teach you a lesson! If you want to blame someone, then you will have to blame your lover!” This killer was rather scared of Ye Chen. However, that fear slowly turned into aggressive anger. He decided that even if he could not kill Ye Chen, he would make his life miserable.</p><p>“How dare you!”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng’s eyes turned into cat-eyes again; they were indeed the demon eyes from forming the spirit body. With those demon eyes, her opponent’s movement was all clear in her vision.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The two exchanged an attack, and the killer from the Ghost Shadow Pavilion got the slightly upper hand. He then changed his step art and turned into a beam of black smoke as he approached her. His fly art and attacking style was indeed hard to catch up with; even if Murong Qingcheng’s speed was not slower than his at all, it still seemed to be rather hard for her to react on time.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>Two black shadows appeared behind Murong Qingcheng; they were not the black shadows inside the ward or the assassins from the Ghost Shadow Pavilion. They were actually a pair of thirty-meter-long black wings. They came directly from her actual bones in her back while a wave of horrifying demon power spread out madly.</p><p>“What!”</p><p>After his attack failed, he realized that Murong Qingcheng had disappeared out of nowhere, leaving only a broken shadow where she was standing before. What was more horrifying was that she was moving so fast that her qi could still be sensed on that broken shadow. No matter how great of an observer one could be, it would be impossible to tell which one was the real Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>“Flying Sky Assassinating Kill Cut!”</p><p>With the black wings behind her back, Murong Qingcheng had performed her profound martial art to its best. Even though she might not be as powerful as her opponent, she was able to beat him in her current state. From far away, this killer was surrounded by Murong Qingcheng’s shadows which all continued to attack him at an extreme speed.</p><p>Surrounded by many black shadows, Ye Chen was not too worried, since he already knew about Murong Qingcheng’s hidden power, such as her demon eyes and her black bat wings. The demon eyes were formed naturally after she had trained her demon body, since the eyes were a part of the demon body. On the other hand, the black bat wings were her special power. If Yuwen Ye’s special power was to have a powerful defense, then Murong Qingcheng’s special power would be extreme speed, and that pair of black bat wings would be the key to increasing her speed.</p><p>Ding! Ding! Dang! Dang!</p><p>No longer being in the weaker position, she now had the definite upper hand, with her battling power increasing drastically. Of course, it would be impossible to attack her opponent in a short period time.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The other killers rushed in the second the black blockage disappeared, turning into beams of black shadows and attacking Murong Qingcheng. Slowly, she lost her upper hand, having to scatter incoming attacks as she moved around.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>A hundred steps away, Ye Chen crossed both of his swords in front of his chest, breaking through the black shadow blockage.</p><p>“Amaranthine Nature!”</p><p>The sword light flashed once outside Ye Chen’s body as he grabbed onto a killer and threw out a sword attack.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>There was rarely anyone who could escape from the Amaranthine Nature Attack, and it obviously did not include this killer in front of him.</p><p>“Soul Eye is about to close up!”</p><p>An aching feeling came from thecenter of his eyebrows as Ye Chen grasped his last chance and waved out a couple of sword attacks. Dozens of scattered gold sword qi spread out, killing a lot of killers of the Ghost Shadow Pavilion and leaving only the one who was battling with Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>Pap!</p><p>The Eye of Soul finally shut down. However, Ye Chen did not need it anymore anyway.</p><p>“Escape!” That killer was escaping toward the edge of the ward.</p><p>“Where do you think you are going?” Ye Chen followed right behind.</p><p>“Let’s die together then!”</p><p>Seeing that there was no way out, the assassin suddenly turned around. A bright black light exploded from his facial features—he was about to explode himself.</p><p>Unfortunately, Ye Chen’s sword speed was even faster, as it went straight through his eyebrows.</p><p>After killing the last killer from the Ghost Shadow pavilion, Ye Chen felt slightly relieved. During that short period of time, even though he seemed really relaxed, he was actually extremely tensed because he could not afford any mistakes. He knew that he was facing the most powerful killers on this land right then.</p><p>All of a sudden…</p><p>A shadow shot out from the fake ones to Ye Chen’s right; it was indeed the leader of the killers, the ‘second-in-command’ they were referring to before.</p><p>“You will die!”</p><p>A joyous expression appeared on this leader’s face. He did not expect to lose so many warriors to kill Ye Chen. But, everything was ending now in his eyes, because he was alive. Being able to finish this mission meant everything to him. He did not care that much about the men he had just lost, since all killers would be killed one day sooner or later; it was their destiny.</p><p>“Oh yeah?”</p><p>Ye Chen indeed did not have the time to escape from that incoming attack, neither had he the time to block it out. But, he was able to activate his dragon power, which spread out in his whole body. All of a sudden, a layer of white bone layer appeared on the surface of his skin along with a light dragon power which had seemed to freeze even the air.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The second-in-command had broken through Ye Chen’s protective Zhen yuan, and his attack landed on his chest. Under this attack, Ye Chen would have been wounded badly even with the gold armor. Once he was wounded, he would definitely not be able to beat this extremely powerful killer from Ghost Shadow Pavilion. But, with his dragon power defense, he was only blown back dozens of steps, without getting even a single scratch.</p><p>He had three layers of defense now; first one being his defense layer, the golden armor being his second, and the dragon bone layer being his third layer of protection. It would be impossible for him to be wounded, since that killer was not that powerful in terms of attacking power. They focused on the tricks of assassination after all.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>The killer looked shocked. It was not his first time encountering powerful preys, but having a powerful defense at Ye Chen’s level was a first for him. If every target he had this level of defense, then there would have no point in even having the Ghost Shadow Pavilion at all. After all, if they could not even break through the defense, then how could the assassination be conducted?</p><p>“Gold Pattern!”</p><p>With the dragon bone defense layer, Ye Chen barely felt any blasting wave. Added with the dragon power inside his body, his physical condition was even stronger. The qi blow had only slightly shocked him a bit before turning back to normal. Ye Chen held his breath as he collected himself before waving out a sword attack.</p><p>Dang! Dang! Dang!</p><p>This killer was indeed powerful, only slightly weaker than Ye Chen, which made him at the level of Lin Tian and Miu Yunhe.</p><p>“Soul Destruction Wave!”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng flashed out from the side at an extreme speed. She performed her ace attack directly, and her special unique soul attack landed inside the killer’s soul ocean.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Even if she had not reached completion on her ace attack, it was still able to shock the killer and cause a moment of dizziness.</p><p>“Die now!”</p><p>This time, Ye Chen successfully took care of the second-in-command of the Ghost Shadow Pavilion; the scattered gold sword qi cut the latter into pieces.</p><p>“Mission aborted! Run!”</p><p>When the forty-nine killers that had set up the ward saw that their second-in-command had been killed, they stopped doing what they were doing and started to run in different directions, disappearing into the darkness.</p><p>“How fast did they run!” Ye Chen did not plan to chase after them. He knew about the rules before that they could only attack their target once; and once their mission failed, they could not assassinate them anymore in their lifetime. Obviously, there had been cases of exceptions.</p><p>Clapping her black wings, Murong Qingcheng put them away and sighed, “If it were not us, they would have more than ninety percent chance of winning.”</p><p>“There are people like us who are not afraid of being attacked out there.”</p><p>…</p><p>Time flew by, and half a month passed away just like that.</p><p>Meanwhile, the news they awaited had finally been found. One out of the three ingredients had been spotted in a rank 6 martial institution, which was actually on the route to the Nine Dragon Mountain. Therefore, Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng started their journey immediately.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
