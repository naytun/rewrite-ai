Even if he were a fool, he would have realized that they had met an ambush. Up until now, it had always been them ambushing the members of Dragon God Celestial Palace. Never did they imagine that there would be a day when they would encounter such a situation.</p><p>“B*stard, that guy actually betrayed us, giving false news!”</p><p>As Sky Eagle Cult, he naturally knew their inner agents inside the Azure Dragon Hall. Therefore, his first reaction was precisely to conclude that they had been betrayed.</p><p>“Break out at all costs!”</p><p>Confronting five thousand people with fifteen hundred, how could he have any other thoughts except escaping? The only thought in his mind was to break out, regardless of how few made it out.</p><p>“Hall Leader, which side to break out from?” The treacherous looking fatty seemed to have lost his head as he asked anxiously.</p><p>“Here!”</p><p>The bird-nosed man picked Ye Chen’s direction. The other three sides had at least thirteen hundred people, and at most fifteen hundred men. Meanwhile, Ye Chen’s side only had eleven hundred men, a difference of a few hundreds. It should be the biggest hope of their group of fifteen hundred people making it out.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>With a wave of his hand, the bird-nosed man led his fifteen hundred people and charged ahead. He had no intention of tangling with Ye Chen directly. Their primary objective was to break out of encirclement.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Ye Chen stood on the golden chariot while Xu Danian and Wu Chuan stood on the black chariot. With the two chariots in the lead, eleven hundred people were arranged like two long dragons laying neck to neck. When the distance between the two sides reduced to thirty li, Ye Chen and the rest took the initiative to attack; waves upon waves of attacks poured down onto Sky Eagle Cult Members like rain.</p><p>“Defend!”</p><p>Sky Eagle Cult members combinedly raised a thick layer of Zhen Yuan barrier. This defensive barrier was the combined power of fifteen hundred men. Its defense was frightening beyond measure. Even if several half-step Life and Death Kings were to attack it together, they wouldn’t be able to pierce through it. Ye Chen and the rest were still far away, and thus, their attacks were weakened a lot by the time they reached the barrier. Therefore, they only caused some ripples on the barrier like those on a lake due to falling drizzle.</p><p>“Deputy Xu, Deputy Wu, they are defending with all their strength and won’t care about offense. You intercept them with everything…We’ll pincer attack them from the left and right.” Ye Chen promptly decided.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Xu Danian and Wu Chuan separated from the troops, leading six-seven hundred people. Just like that, the two long dragons attacked from both left and right. If the other side only focused on defense, they might survive. However, if they wished to attack, they would have to open their defense. In that case, every wave of attack could get rid of a small group among them.</p><p>“Hurry up, increase the speed!”</p><p>The bird-nosed middle-aged man was anxious. If the other side had not separated, he had the confidence to break out of the encirclement at a loss of a small portion of their members. Then, they could retreat while fighting; once the other three sides joined them, it would be their turn to launch a fierce counterattack.</p><p>Unfortunately, the other side divided into two groups while they were fully focused on defense. One side was constantly attacking them and slowing them down, while the other group temporarily gave up on attacking and swiftly moved right in their path.</p><p>“Left side, focus completely on defense…The rest, attack!”</p><p>In urgency, the bird-nosed man didn’t lose his calm, ordering the left section to defend and those facing Xu Danian and Wu Chuan to abandon all defense and attack. Although the speed of the thirteen hundred men had slowed down quite a bit, they still looked majestic and unstoppable.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>As if countless fireworks exploded, several hundreds of attacks traveled toward Xu Danian and Wu Chuan’s group.</p><p>Xu Danian and Wu Chuan didn’t return fire, as their objective was to obstruct Sky Eagle Cult members. Therefore, their first task was not to counterattack, but to create a steady formation and raise a solid defense.</p><p>“B*stard!”</p><p>Seeing the first wave of attacks going down the drain, the bird-nosed man’s heart sank increasingly. The enemy was thoroughly prepared, and had thought about all possible outcomes beforehand. In other words, they were like fish stuck in the net. They could struggle all they wanted, but to no avail.</p><p>“You people sure are ruthless. All hear my command, split into thirteen groups.”</p><p>Centralized, their defense and offense was high, but they were also easily susceptible to be squeezed in. If they split, many would die instantly. However, under the current situation, trying to make out without high casualties would be simply a fantasy. If they separated, one or two groups might escape. But, if they remained together, all of them would die without a doubt.</p><p>Shua Shua Shua Shua!</p><p>Like a group of fish in water, the members of Sky Eagle Cult hurriedly separated into thirteen groups, squeezing whichever way they saw fit and creating an extremely chaotic scene.</p><p>This change in the situation didn’t make Ye Chen change his method. His troops continued to send wave after wave of attacks, taking care of one group at a time. He himself directly charged toward the bird-nosed man’s group at the forefront with a speed more than twice compared to the latter.</p><p>Creak!</p><p>Ye Chen slashed, and a black sword Qi bombarded the group, as if tearing through void.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere: one sword strike had killed fifty men straightaway.</p><p>Without any pause, Ye Chen slashed again. A black thunder sphere streaked across the horizon, and at the same time, the others on the golden chariot also issued their most powerful attacks one after another, having reached sufficiently close. A vast and mighty energy surged across the air like a tide.</p><p>Just one wave of attack annihilated the bird-nosed man and his group. One couldn’t blame them for their strength being too weak. The golden chariot had the gathering of experts with the strongest battle power—Ye Chen, Chen Yuxin, Luo Yunsong, and Xing Meilian. Ye Chen himself was equivalent to the top section of the troops. Thus, it would actually have been strange if they weren’t able to wipe out the enemy.</p><p>The other members of Sky Eagle Cult didn’t have different outcomes either. Although they created annoyances for a while, they were unable to break out of the encirclement in the end. Out of the thirteen batches, only four remained, containing less than four hundred people.</p><p>By the time the Black Dragon Hall, White Dragon Hall, and Red Dragon Hall caught up, all thirteen hundred members of Sky Eagle Cult were already thoroughly wiped out. Of course, it couldn’t be said that their three factions didn’t play any role. If not for them, the nose-faced man wouldn’t have chosen to flee. He would have separated his troops and certainly engaged in a fight to death. In that case, even if their side turned out victorious, they would have paid a considerable price.</p><p>“Haha, Ye Chen, long time no see!” Mo Feng could be considered quite familiar with Ye Chen.</p><p>Ye Chen smiled and said, “Many thanks for helping us!”</p><p>“What are you saying, Deputy Ye? Sky Eagle Cult is an enemy to all of us. This matter concerns all of us.” The other two hall leaders didn’t dare to treat Ye Chen as an ordinary deputy and spoke politely.</p><p>Ye Chen said, “If nothing unexpected happens, Water wave Sect, Black King Gate, and Whirlwind Gate also will have a lot of people. Another hard battle awaits us.”</p><p>“We’ll see who is afraid of whom! We’re not here to sightsee…We have to at least kill a few!” The Red Dragon Hall Leader was a big man, giving off a bandit like aura and seeming like a bandit leader. However, in terms of strength, he was not inferior to the Black Dragon Hall Leader at all, and were both only under the Azure Dragon Hall Leader Wei Longtao.</p><p>The Black Dragon Hall Leader was a cold, grim looking middle-aged man with an extremely dense killing intent. He said, “Let this place become a nightmare for the four enemies!”</p><p>“Zuo Hall Leader is correct! Let this place become a nightmare for the four enemies.” A cold light flickered in Mo Feng’s eyes.</p><p>Three hall leaders and one deputy stood together, emanating extremely powerful auras and instantly becoming the focus of everybody on the scene. Although Ye Chen hadn’t been a deputy for long, his battle accomplishments were too shocking, and his aura was not under the three hall leaders’; it even indistinctly seemed to be taking the lead.</p><p>After a few moments of coming together, they separated again. Like before, Black Dragon Hall, Red Dragon Hall, and White Dragon Hall spread out more than a hundred li away from Ye Chen’s group, which was neither too far away nor too close, just outside the range of perception of Sea of Soul experts. It would allow them to hurry over quickly and provide support. They were awaiting the members of the other three forces.</p><p>…</p><p>The first to come was the Whirlwind Gate.</p><p>“Something is wrong! Where is Sky Eagle Cult?” Whirlwind Gate’s Yin Wind Hall Leader He Lengji creased his brows and involuntarily slowed his speed.</p><p>“Sky Eagle Cult has already been repelled by us…Seems like you also want to follow in their steps.” Ye Chen’s voice came from afar.</p><p>He didn’t say that Sky Eagle Cult members were annihilated, lest he increased the enemy’s vigilance. After all, repelled and annihilated had completely different meanings.</p><p>“Follow their footsteps? Hmph! Even if you repelled them back, so what? This place will become your grave today.”</p><p>He Lengji didn’t suspect him. In his view, Ye Chen must have brought a lot of people with him, possibly two thousand or even more. In the process of repelling Sky Eagle Cult, they also suffered quite a few losses, and were only left with thirteen hundred people. On the other hand, his side had sixteen hundred people. Moreover, his two allies were also hurrying over. Thus, this matter’s outcome had little suspense left.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Understanding this fact, He Lengji let out a sigh of relief. Waving his hand, he led his troops and charged toward Ye Chen and the rest.</p><p>“Full defense!”</p><p>Ye Chen didn’t intend to counterattack, and instead, raised a combined Zhen Yuan barrier.</p><p>Bang Bang Bang!</p><p>As numerous attacks landed on the barrier, Ye Chen and the rest retreated slowly. Soon, they had retreated for dozens of li.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill1”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Right at this moment, three groups of people appeared from He Lengji’s right, left, and back. The latter’s attention was focused on Ye Chen; thus, by the time they realized it, they were no longer in a position to escape.</p><p>“You dare cheat me! Were the members of Sky Eagle Cult completely wiped out or not?” He Lengji was furious, and his eyes were basically spouting flames.</p><p>“It’s already too late for you to know.”</p><p>“Even if die, I’ll drag you people with me!”</p><p>He Lengji knew that he could not survive. Thus, leading his troops, he threw all caution to the wind and charged toward Ye Chen.</p><p>“Counterattack!”</p><p>Ye Chen was never afraid of them. His retreat was merely to prevent the enemy’s escape, dragging them to the optimal ambush site. With his word, the Zhen Yuan barrier dissipated, and more than a thousand attacks shout out.</p><p>Numerous attacks collided with each other, creating a death zone within dozens of li. At this moment, Black Dragon Hall, Red Dragon Hall, and White Dragon Hall had already arrived within thirty li.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The three sides unleashed their first wave of attack respectively</p><p>Immediately afterward, miserable screams rose as hundreds of Whirlwind Gate members died on the spot. After two more waves of attacks, they followed the steps of Sky Eagle Cult and were completely annihilated.</p><p>“Haha, this is great!”</p><p>Red Dragon Hall Leader had never felt so refreshed from killing. His two eyes had turned deep red, almost oozing out a tangible killing intent.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
