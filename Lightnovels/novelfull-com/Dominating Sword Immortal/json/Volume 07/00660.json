He pushed his soul power, and the sword finger drew a bent line.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>The emerald green ray was just like Ye Chen’s figure art. He drew a line in the air, and it went through the fake mountain the second time. It was only slightly slower than the straight line.</p><p>Next, Ye Chen’s sword finger flicked out a couple of times, and the emerald green ray punctured through the fake mountain from different angles. No one knew how many times it went through the fake mountain, which could no longer handle its own weight and collapsed, bringing up a pile of dust cloud.</p><p>“Come back!”</p><p>Ye Chen made a pulling gesture, and the emerald green ray turned into a sword, going back into the sword scabbard.</p><p>“My soul power is five times stronger than the normal people. I managed to obtain a power equivalent to the second level by only training the first level, that too at a speed that is even faster than Situ Hao. With my even more intense attacking power, my defensive sword spell would be way more monstrous in the future, as proficient as an arm of mine.”</p><p>If Situ Hao could see Ye Chen using his flying sword, he would surely be shocked, since Ye Chen’s first level was already as powerful as his own second level. Obviously, the latter’s second level would be even more powerful than before.</p><p>“However, the first level is still just the first level. It is still not smooth enough to operate the flying sword, and the hard corners are still not natural enough. Once encountering top warriors, it would be easy for the others to find its flaws.”</p><p>After thinking about it for a while, Ye Chen decided not to cultivate the second level now, as there was still some space for development on the first level. He decided he would only move onto the second level when there was nothing more to train in the first one.</p><p>A couple of days came and passed, and Ye Chen was making progress everyday. He had to admit that the defensive sword spell felt as if it was designed specifically for him. With his powerful soul power, he could train it like doing daily chores. But of course, it was only the first level, and the second level would not be as simple.</p><p>On that day, four young women showed up in Ye family.</p><p>The lady on the left was about twenty-five years old. She wore a green dress, and a longsword hung around her waist. She was very pretty, and had eyes black like the dark night. If one looked closely, she seemed kind of similar looking as Ye Chen. They were indeed really close in the bloodline, as she was Ye Xuan, the daughter of Ye Chen’s fourth uncle.</p><p>Ye Chen’s father, Ye Tianhao, and the fourth uncle, Ye Wenhao, were already similar looking; hence, the one small difference in their names. As the daughter of Ye Chen’s fourth uncle, it was reasonable that they also looked alike.</p><p>Ye Xuan had reached the Astral Reaching Realm, which made her the fourth person making it to the Astral Reaching Realm in the family; the first one was Ye Chen, and the other two were his parents. Before Ye Chen’s rise in power, Ye Xuan used to be Ye family’s first martial genius, so it was not unexpected for her to do so.</p><p>The three young ladies traveling with Ye Xuan were all twenty-five years old. The first one on the right was dressed in red; she was very attractive looking, with a nice body. Black whips had been tied around her body, and the way she walked was also very attention grabbing.</p><p>The lady second on the right was just as pretty as Ye Xuan and the lady in red. But, she looked extra friendly, with her curved brows and big bright eyes. She gave people the feeling that they needed to take care of her and protect her from everything.</p><p>The third lady was not as pretty as the other ones, seeming a bit cold-looking, with a hint of pride. She was the tallest of them all, wearing a thin sword around her waist.</p><p>The first three were all at the Early Astral Reaching Realm while the cold lady was already at the mid realm.</p><p>“Ah, I wonder if you could allow us to meet your cousin this time. I have come here so many times already, I just want to see him once.” The lady in red was excited, and a hint of nervousness could be found in her eyes as if she were a teenage girl about to see her crush. If the ones who knew her for a while saw her now, they would be way too shocked, since she was always so confident and aggressive normally.</p><p>Ye Xuan shook her head; these three were her best friends, plus they were slightly different. The lady in red was named Du Hongyin, and was the princess of a mid rank nation, the Red Moon Nation South Rudra Region. Her identity would be more important than even the eldest son of other rank 7 martial institutions. The friendly looking lady was the eldest daughter of a rank 7 martial family, named Lan Cuicui. The one with the highest status would be the cold-looking girl, whose name was Luo Baishuang. She was the top disciple of the rank 6 martial institution, the Sunset Martial School; her cultivation was one realm higher than the other three.</p><p>Amongst the three, Lan Cuicui knew her first, and the two’s friendship was very pure. As for Du Hongyin and Luo Baishuang, they started to approach her because of Ye Chen. However, after spending some time together and some life and death situations, their impure friendship started to become real. Otherwise, Ye Xuan would not have spent so much time with them, to the point of even inviting them to her house.</p><p>Of course, friendship aside, the three would always talk about Ye Chen when they were with Ye Xuan.</p><p>“My cousin would always go to the Sky Martial Region. He might be there a lot and for a long time. I have not seen him for a while either.” Ye Xuan was not home that often, so she did not get to see Ye Chen a lot either.</p><p>“The Sky Martial Region is a great place for martial geniuses. Normal warriors would not even have the right to go there. But, your cousin is even more powerful. He is the No.1 warrior right below the top five young warriors…the one young man being listed in the ranking besides the top five young warriors.” Di Hongyin could not help but praise her man crush. If she found out that Ye Chen had beaten Lu Shaoyou, Xia Houzun, as well as Xiao Chuhe in a way, then she might have fainted by now.</p><p>Lan Cuicui was blushing when she asked quietly, “Ye Xuan, do you think you could take us to your cousin’s yard?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>She refused immediately. Inside the Ye family, everyone treated him as the legend. She admired and was afraid of Ye Chen herself as well. She would not dare to take people to his yard.</p><p>“But I could take you guys to the Wind Pavilion. From there, you can see the yard from far away.” She continued to say.</p><p>“Alright! Let’s go!” The rest of them could not wait.</p><p>The pavilion was one of the tallest building inside the Ye family. From there, one could see most of the family grounds. Ye Chen’s yard was the biggest of them all. Although green trees and bushes had covered up most parts of the building and bedroom, the ground next to the lake and the area above the lake was still visible.</p><p>Dow! Dow! Dow!</p><p>A string of hurried footsteps were heard as the four of them arrived on the ninth floor of the pavilion.</p><p>“There is my cousin’s yard.” Ye Xuan came to that massive window and pointed at the yard where Ye Chen stayed.</p><p>Strangely, all four of them suddenly stopped talking; they even seemed to stop breathing.</p><p>In their eyes, right next to the lake, a young man in blue was training some kind of unique sword art. With his finger pointed out, a beam of emerald colored green ray had been shot out. It flew on top of the lake, creating a beautiful ray net. It was all happening so fast.</p><p>The young man looked like he was even younger than them, only in his early twenties. But, people who had seen his portrait would know that that was indeed Ye Chen himself. He was twenty-six years old this year; the reason that he looked so young was because he had reached Astral Reaching Realm at the age of nineteen, and Sea of Souls Realm at the age of twenty-four. His appearance had stopped aging for a couple of years now, as if time could not affect him at all.</p><p>“You cousin is at home!”</p><p>Di Hongyin covered her mouth with her hands. Meanwhile, Lan Cuicui and Luo Baishuang were almost gasping for air.</p><p>“Yeah!” Ye Xuan nodded like a robot.</p><p>Frankly, Ye Xuan and Ye Chen had never really talked. The two of them were always out traveling most of the times. Being able to run into each other was all pure luck. It would only happen once or twice per year.</p><p>Looking at him from far away, Ye Xuan could not decide what exactly she was feeling.</p><p>Before Ye Chen became somebody significant, she used to be very cold toward him. Although she was never hostile toward him like her other cousins Ye Tang and Ye Ming, she would never be friendly either. She had a really bad relationship with him ever since the incident with Ji Xueyan as well, since she did not care for him at all, and was the No.1 martial genius of the family herself. Thus, there would be nothing for her to talk to him about.</p><p>However, ever since then, Ye Chen started rising unstoppably. In the family gathering, he had already shocked everyone. Then, he managed to become the No.1 warrior of the nine nations, leading in front of the Emerald Prince and the other top martial geniuses. But, all of a sudden, Ye Chen became the king, and with him being the sign, no one would dare to fight him for his thunder.</p><p>If it were already shocking enough, then the following would just be described as legendary.</p><p>In the Hidden Dragon Race, Ye Chen had become a bright rising star. It was a star that was brighter than the sun, as he beat all of the top warriors that Ye Xuan had never even dared to imagine beating. Ye Chen stepped on their bodies and slowly became the first martial genius of the South Rudra Region. When everyone thought that it was where he would stop moving upward, he proved everyone wrong. He managed to become one of the top young warriors in the tea gather of the south regions, being ranked right next to Li Xiaoyun, Jing Aoxuan, and Chu Zhongtian. Moreover, he managed to be the first in the next round as well, and beat off the unwelcomed guests from the east regions. Ye Chen was then family-known name in all southern regions.</p><p>As if it were still not good enough of a stage for him, he came to the Sky Martial Region as the first warrior of the south region and started his new journey. Within a couple of years, he became the first warrior below the top five young warriors. His name slowly became an even wider spread name.</p><p>Right then, Ye Chen was officially a legend, a god to many young warriors.</p><p>As Ye Chen’s family, Ye Xuan knew it well better than anyone. Right now, everyone inside the South Rudra Region would want to be friendly with him. In the eyes of those normal people, the rank 6 martial institutions were incredibly powerful; but a lot of people knew that if Ye Chen wanted, he could tear apart all of the rank 6 martial institutions.</p><p>Everyone inside the South Rudra Region was looking up to Ye Chen; he was not only the first warrior of the young generation, he was also the de facto king warrior of the South Rudra Region. When a king warrior was maddened, everyone would be shaken, including the top four nations, ten mid-sized nations, and thirty-six minor nations.</p><p>And because of Ye Chen, the Ye family and Sky Cloud Martial School had been put in a completely different spot. A lot of royal families wanted to have their children in the school and become a disciple. Some of the royal families even wanted to marry their daughters into the Ye family, even if it were just with an outer disciple. As long as one could have any remote relationship with the Ye family, no parties within the South Rudra Region would do anything to them.</p><p>Although the Ye family did not want to have much to do with the powerful groups, there would always be one or two exceptions. For example, one of the princesses from a mid-sized nation had married into the family, and the youngest princess from the Windy Nation had married one of the inner disciple as well.</p><p>Ye Chen’s rise had saved the family a million years of hard work. Even the older generation warriors would not dare to be disrespectful to Ye Chen. It was purely due to his power.</p><p>“Ye Xuan, could you introduce me to your cousin?” Luo Baishuang, who was normally really cold and proud, said suddenly.</p><p>Ye Xuan came back to reality from her thoughts as she said while shaking her head, “Don’t even think about it. My cousin already has a girlfriend. I think you know her as well. She is Murong Qingcheng.”</p><p>“I don’t mind being his second wife.” Du Hongyin said disappointedly.</p><p>It was right then when Ye Chen, who was standing right next to the lake, pointed out his sword finger. His longsword flew out automatically, and he turned his head and looked at the ninth floor of the restaurant.</p><p>All of a sudden, all four of them held their breaths.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
