He had not expected to see Ye Chen’s observation and accuracy reach this level. He knew that his blade waving speed was already extremely fast, but somehow, Ye Chen could still manage to find the weakest spot and hit it perfectly as if he had handed it right to the latter.</p><p>Waving his long blade, it was Du Gujue’s first time being forced to move from attack to defense.</p><p>In the next second, all of the sparks shot around Du Gujue. Ye Chen’s sword was like the most poisonous snake; the second there was a chance, it would throw out the deadliest attack, leaving Du Gujue no chance of fighting back. Everyone watching saw that Du Gujue had been completely oppressed right from the beginning, and could feel their throats closing up, leaving them gasping for air.</p><p>If one were not battling Ye Chen personally, it would be hard to tell his power.</p><p>Du Gujue thought that his blade speed was already fast enough, and his power was already strong enough to at least battle with Ye Chen fairly. But now, he realized how wrong he was. Ye Chen was not only just as fast and strong as him, what was even more horrifying was that even though their power was similar, it was somehow always he who kept backing out. He felt frustrated because he could not perform his power and martial art the way he wanted to.</p><p>Their battle was constantly changing; with everything happening so quickly, all people could see were the bright sparks, which were the only proof they had of the exchanged attacks. Otherwise, it would be easily thought that the two did not even touch each other.</p><p>Ting! Ting! Ting! Ting! Ting!</p><p>Du Gujue’s defense was perfect, and even Ye Chen could not break through it. But, the latter could weaken his defense still. With each sword attack landing on the weakest point of his blade light, even if it were not one hundred percent accurate, Ye Chen could succeed five out of ten times.</p><p>It was like peeling an onion, Du Gujue’s blade light was getting weaker and weaker, layer after layer. He was clear that under this intense attack of Ye Chen, his blade speed was getting slower and slower. At this rate, his defense would break down when his blade got half a beat slower.</p><p>“Ho!”</p><p>All of a sudden, that despairing qi on Du Gujue intensified again as that white flame started to burn even more aggressively behind his left eye. His hair became white, and that blade light defense of his that was weakening started to get richer again visibly. It perfectly blocked out all of Ye Chen’s attack. Not only that, once the blade light defense reached an advanced stage, Du Gujue’s wrist shook once and that blade light defense disappeared completely. It turned into a beam of extra bright blade light, attacking toward Ye Chen. It was indeed his Despairing Sword Attack, but in a different form.</p><p>Ye Chen had gone through so many different battles but had never really lost. And he was not going to lose this one either. Even though he was at the receiving end, he held his sword with both hands and stabbed it out at the incoming blade light. With that, the Gold Pattern started to spread out in the air.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Ye Chen backed out for only dozens of steps and did not even lose his balance for a split second. With only that, it could tell how much more powerful he was than Xiao Chuhe.</p><p>If Du Gujue’s blade power was powerful enough, then Ye Chen’s sword art was even more unpredictable. That was everyone’s first impression, since that blade was too horrifying. But somehow, Ye Chen was still able to block it out and fight back even in that situation.</p><p>Even with that blade attack gaining the advantage, Du Gujue did not stop attacking as he threw out hundreds of attacks at Ye Chen in a row. For each one of them, that pale white light was like the moon as it continued to spread out across the whole area. It was not hard to block out one blade attack, but wanting to block out hundreds of them would be as hard as reaching the moon. Even Xiao Chuhe could not block out that Despairing Blade attack, not to mention that there were hundreds of them now.</p><p>“So powerful!”</p><p>Ye Chen could sense that Du Gujue’s blade speed and power had reached a new realm, its attacking power augmenting as well. Each blade attack of his would be like a normal killing attack. If he wanted to secure himself, then he would have to use his killing attack as well; it would be his only way out.</p><p>Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!</p><p>As he waved his longsword in the air, waves of golden pattern spread out with Ye Chen at the center, blocking out beams after beams of white blade light.</p><p>“What? Killing attacks in a row?” Du Gujue was shocked as the blade attack was stopped.</p><p>His despairing blade attack was a killing attack, but it would be different than the normal ones. This one used itself as the foundation, so the movement itself was not that special. Therefore, it was easy enough to continue being performed in a short period of time. Of course, doing it so frequently in such a short period of time would affect the blade power. But, even with one-third of its original power, it would still be more powerful than the normal one when struck out enough number of times.</p><p>However, Ye Chen performed his killing attacks a couple of times and managed to block all of them out.</p><p>“Thunder Devour!”</p><p>At that moment, Ye Chen changed his sword style as his body shot out, waving his sword to create a perfect thunder ball. It then brought out waves of space pattern while he appeared right in front of Du Gujue.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Du Gujue’s eyes were still burning with white flames as he threw out a blade attack to avoid the thunder ball.</p><p>Only when perfect could the thunder ball have the most explosive destructive power. As a result, after being cut in half, it could not even produce one-tenth of its actual power. This blade attack of Du Gujue’s had used his blade speed and power perfectly at the same time; otherwise, if he were slightly slower and weaker, then the thunder ball would have exploded at that very second.</p><p>“The two have gotten this powerful…!”</p><p>There were at least twenty master level warriors from the ranking here watching these two fight. They realized sadly that ever since the beginning of the battle, Du Gujue and Ye Chen had demonstrated the kind of power that could win against every single one of them within the first second, and that even their casual attacks would slice them in halves.</p><p>“Such an epic battle for the young warriors!”</p><p>The leader of the pavilion Gao Changtian was here as well. The development of both Ye Chen and Du Gujue was out of his expectation. These two were twenty-eight and twenty-six years old, but their power had already exceeded all of those young warriors.</p><p>“The Supreme Two!” Someone shouted out subconsciously.</p><p>“What a good name!” The person standing right next to him thought about it and agreed with the name.</p><p>Just like that, the Supreme Two became the special title for the two. Although Dantai Mingyue was a similar top martial genius as the two, but she was a female warrior after all, and it would be rather weird to address her like that with a fellow male warrior. Plus, no one really knew her power after all.</p><p>“Three attacks!”</p><p>Ye Chen activated his sword steps and his body turned into a beam of sword light, flashing in the air. That longsword of his stabbed, waved, and sliced out, every single movement targeting right at Du Gujue’s weakness</p><p>Du Gujue was very afraid of Ye Chen’s close-up battling skills which had very high requirement to learn. Although his power was enough to compete with the other, Ye Chen was somehow way much more overbearing. Just now, Lu Shaoyou had indeed lost to Ye Chen’s Spiritual Sword.</p><p>The intense danger had pushed Du Gujue’s reflexes to their limit. He managed to block out Ye Chen’s last attack, but that sharp sword qi had still taken away a piece of cloth of his.</p><p>“Despairing Fox!”</p><p>Taking three steps backward, Du Gujue’s grey white hair danced in the air as he conjured a fox shadow which looked evil and scary while roaring and jumping at Ye Chen.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>A thunder ball entered that fox’s mouth, and the fox shadow shattered completely while that shockwave with electricity spread out everywhere.</p><p>“Alright, that’s it!”</p><p>Ye Chen suddenly increased his speed and the dragon power spread in his arm while he poured his Zhen yuan into his longsword. That sword shot out at an extreme speed toward Du Gujue, fast as an illusion.</p><p>“So fast! Am I going to lose?”</p><p>Du Gujue could feel the despair growing inside him. Different from before, this emotion was brought on by Ye Chen instead of himself. He had to mention that Ye Chen had still underestimated the power of despair, which would bring out the potential of a warrior. Du Gujue felt like he was in that cave again.</p><p>Dang!</p><p>At that critical moment, Du Gujue saw the traveling route of the sword and welcomed it with a blade attack. That massive spark spread out around and a massive fireball appeared between the two.</p><p>“Huh? You can handle even this?”</p><p>Close-up battle was Ye Chen’s strongest area. He could demonstrate both the normal techniques as well as the ones under his dragon power’s enhancement. Unless Du Gujue swallowed some kind of special pellet like Xia Houzun had done, it would be impossible to handle this sword attack. However, Du Gujue was not Xia Houzun at all; the despair had increased his senses, which allowed him to see the traveling route of the sword.</p><p>“The power of despair is limited.”</p><p>Both of Ye Chen’s hands had been covered by a layer of white dragon bone layer as he held the sword handle tightly, throwing out one attack after another at Du Gujue. Each sword attack would twist the space a little which seemed like a mirror, reflecting the two’s shadows.</p><p>Du Gujue had a decent physical strength as well, reaching about three hundred thousand pounds. Most of that was his own physical power while a small amount was gained through training spirit plants, since there were plants apart from the Dragon Blood Plant that could increase qi power.</p><p>Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang!</p><p>Piles of fireball exploded as Du Gujue backed out and Ye Chen continued to chase up. Finally, Du Gujue’s arms went numb and he was stabbed by Ye Chen on the shoulder. That sharp sword power followed his shield and went all way into his body.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Du Gujue opened his mouth and puked out a huge amount of blood. His body backed out, and circles of patterns were brought out in front of his body because of the extreme speed.</p><p>“Du Gujue lost! This Ye Chen…How exactly powerful is he! So incredible!”</p><p>“Even Du Gujue could not handle Ye Chen. Everyone was wrong about him!”</p><p>“What a scary man! I thought Du Gujue was already scary enough…I did not think that Ye Chen was even more so!”</p><p>It was Ye Chen’s first time revealing his full power to the world.</p><p>“Despairing World!”</p><p>Right then, Du Gujue was blown backward when he used all of his remaining power and the potential hidden deep in his soul, waving out that one last blade attack. It was so powerful that the blade light had been shattered immediately, turning into a hundred meters wide grey light column and attacking Ye Chen menacingly. Vaguely, one could see countless human shadows hidden within, crying hysterically.</p><p>“You cannot stop this!”</p><p>After waving out this blade attack, Du Gujue did not even have the power to control his body anymore as that pale white flame in his eye disappeared completely.</p><p>In everyone’s vision, that grey light column devoured Ye Chen immediately. Avoiding and escaping would be impossible at this stage.</p><p>No one had expected to see Du Gujue have such a horrifying killing attack hidden up his sleeve. All of them had their mouths wide open. They all thought that Du Gujue had managed to flip around the situation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
