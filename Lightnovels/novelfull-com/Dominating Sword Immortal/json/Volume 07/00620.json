If it were not for the fact that he had strong enough will power, it would be impossible to cut through that dream with one attack. Ever since the wolf took the Nine Twist Reverse Soul Plant, its dream creating power had improved again. As long as the opponent did not have more than rank four of will power, it would be impossible to fight off the dream created by the wolf. The Eagle Beast and Evil Demon Master must have had some kind of great adventures before; therefore, they had not sunk into the dreams immediately. Instead, they were only half dreaming.</p><p>“Let’s kill the Bear Tyrant and Snake Beast!” Ye Chen said to Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng had just woken from being shocked. She pointed out a finger at each one of them, that pitch black finger power puncturing right through the head of the Snake Beast. The Bear Tyrant, who had too strong defense, only got a bleeding head. And the pain from the wound had actually started to wake it up.</p><p>Right at this side, Ye Chen was approaching the Evil Demon Master at an extreme speed.</p><p>Killing him with sword qi would not be that safe, since he was only half dreaming at this stage. That intense incoming danger might wake him up. Moreover, a beam of sword qi would only wound him slightly, and it would be impossible to kill him with it. Therefore, Ye Chen would have to get close and wait until the last moment when he had one hundred percent confidence in killing him.</p><p>Naturally, the second that Ye Chen approached him, the other was woken up.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The Evil Demon Master screamed as he lifted up his right palm, dragging out a chain saw patterned blade light which attacked right at the other. At that critical moment, his potential exploded; this palm blade was even more powerful than when he was at his peak. Under its effect, even the space started twisting drastically.</p><p>“I have told you! If I had gotten you once, then I will get you twice. As for the third time? There will be no third time.”</p><p>There was no expression on Ye Chen’s face as his thunder disaster sword was stabbed out with his wood profound.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>Evil Demon Master had only performed half of his ace attack when his forehead was punctured through. His pupils dilated as if he could not believe his own death.</p><p>Taking out the thunder disaster sword, Ye Chen bent his body and turned around, flying over at the Eagle Beast that was a hundred meters away.</p><p>The Eagle Beast had been woken by that roar from the Evil Demon Master before his death. Seeing Ye Chen approaching at such a fast speed, he waved his wings, wanting to escape.</p><p>“Gold Pattern!”</p><p>Midway, Ye Chen waved the long sword in his hand. Seven or eight gold sword qi spread out like water patterns.</p><p>Pooh! Pooh! Pooh!</p><p>Although the Eagle Beast was moving very fast, but no matter how fast it was, it would not reach the speed of the sword qi. As a result, he was hit on his back, tail, and left wing. The steel-like feathers and blood splashed in the air; his body shivered, almost falling down from the sky.</p><p>“I will have no holdbacks!”</p><p>With his left wing being wounded, the Eagle Beast’s speed had been affected. He turned around and flapped his right wing, causing wind blades to be thrown out toward Ye Chen.</p><p>“Sword step!”</p><p>Ye Chen turned into a beam of twisted sword light, moving amidst the dense wind blades. Seeing that there were no gaps, he threw out a sword to make way.</p><p>“Wind Fire Pellet!”</p><p>Eagle Beast could not do anything to Ye Chen, so an evil look flashed through his face. His beak spat out a blue-red colored pellet that grew at the touch of the wind. It grew all the way to the size of a house, with bright red flames and dark blue wind wrapping around it. Under the stimulation of the wind and fire, its power had been doubled, attacking right at Ye Chen.</p><p>“Wind Fire Pellet!”</p><p>“What? An inner pellet!” Ye Chen was shocked.</p><p>Normally, beasts under rank 9 would carry an inner pellet inside their body, which would serve as a root for them and would be equivalent to a human’s dantian. It contained an endless beast power.</p><p>Beasts under rank 9 would not be able to spit out their pellets to attack their opponents. Only a small amount of them had the power to do so. But, unless it was an extremely critical moment, they would definitely not do it. After all, once their pellets were destroyed, their cultivation would be damaged severely.</p><p>But, once the beasts reached rank 9, then all of their insides would have been trained into beast power ocean, which would be similar to human warriors who trained their Zhen yuan core into Zhen yuan when they reached the Sea of Souls Realm. Although the names for them were different, its mythology was still the same.</p><p>He had really not expected to see that the Eagle Beast still had a double element inner pellet.</p><p>The truth was that using the inner pellet to attack opponents would be their most powerful attack, which meant that they were no longer holding anything back. It was not hard to imagine how it increased the battling power drastically.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Ye Chen flipped his body in the air, throwing out dozens of gold sword qi.</p><p>Boom! Boom! The attack landed mightily onto that massive inner pellet.</p><p>This pellet was unbreakable; even if Ye Chen used his most powerful attack, it still seemed impossible to break it with one attack. He could only decrease its power.</p><p>The Eagle Beast’s face full of feathers twitched once or twice. The pellet was connected directly with its soul, which meant it was a part of its body. When the pellet was under attack, he would not have a good time either. Plus, this pellet equaled one-third of his cultivation, which meant everything to him. It would take a long time to repair the damage that had been done to it.</p><p>“Huh! Once I use the pellet, even Bear Tyrant himself would not be able to compete with it.”</p><p>The Eagle Beast was always quite proud of himself. Although his position was not as high as Bear Tyrant’s, but it was under the condition that he had not taken out his biggest card. He knew that it would be very necessary to have a life-saving ace card which would be able to save his life when he needed the most. Therefore, he had never revealed it to anyone before.</p><p>As for this pellet, it was actually not his natural power. It was a by-product of him training some secret beast art which would break the inner pellet of his when he reached rank 9. A part of the pellet turned into the beast power ocean, while another part stayed inside his body. After all these years, he had only used it three times. The first time was against some beast that was way more powerful than him, which had eventually helped him kill it. The second time was when the Sky Hunter Master tried to take him. And the third time was now against Ye Chen.</p><p>The pellet contained one-third of his cultivation. Once it flew out to attack its opponent, it would be twice as powerful than any of his attacks.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The pellet continued to clash with Ye Chen, and the wind carried the fire everywhere. Even the mountain rocks had been melted, turning into red lava.</p><p>“This brat somehow has a Dream Eating Wolf! No wonder he would be so confident!” A few miles away, the Sky Hunter Master flapped the colorful wings of his as he looked over at Ye Chen with a gloomy expression.</p><p>Although the Dream Eating Wolf’s battling power was not as powerful as the other top rank beasts, but it was definitely extremely rare. The aid it could bring would be even more significant than those beasts. Looking at the wolf, the Sky Hunter Master was full of greed. He did not want to leave all of a sudden.</p><p>“That pellet had given me a hard time. Even if it cannot cause any damage to this brat, it can at least make him tired. I need to think of a trick to get this wolf.”</p><p>Awhoo~!</p><p>It was right then when an earth-shaking bear roar was heard. With it being the center, a space pattern spread out and the ground started cracking.</p><p>Since the bear tyrant was the owner of the mountain, its body was way more powerful than other beast tyrants with the same cultivation. Even the Ice Flood Dragon Ye Chen had met in the ancient place could not compete with it. Of course, they both were top talented beasts. Once they reached rank 10, they would not be some beasts that the bear tyrant could compete with. But regardless, its power was undoubtedly mighty.</p><p>After being wounded badly a couple of times in a row, the bear tyrant had finally woken from the dream. Seeing Murong Qingcheng continue to attack him, he could not help but get furious.</p><p>Awhoo!</p><p>The wolf roared as well, but it did not go to help Ye Chen, since he had told it to help Murong Qingcheng instead.</p><p>The dim light was like wavy water as it continued to attack the bear tyrant’s soul ocean. The wolf’s red fur stood on its skin, looking like burning flames.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng could see that the wolf had stayed by her side, and she knew that it was Ye Chen’s order.</p><p>“Darkness Sky!”</p><p>Lifting up her hand, she created a black blockade to protect herself and the wolf. The black bat wings on her back had been expanded to their limit. Countless black flowy light beams poured into her body before following her meridians into her finger tips.</p><p>“Sky Demon Finger!” She groaned as she pointed at that furious bear tyrant.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A black sun rose up in the sky as the dizzy bear tyrant was blown into the air; he had no power to fight back.</p><p>“Good job!” Murong Qingcheng knew that the wolf had tried its best. Without its dream power, it would be impossible to wound the bear tyrant for sure.</p><p>Whoo! Whoo!</p><p>The wolf waved its tails in response.</p><p>“Murong has the help of the wolf, and she also has the demon race martial arts from her bloodline. She should be fine. On the other hand, that Sky Hunter Master is a problem.”</p><p>Battling with the Eagle Beast, Ye Chen still had the time to look around; especially what Sky Hunter Master was doing was under his detection.</p><p>“I will take care of this eagle beast first, and the pellet will be a good reward for the wolf.”</p><p>After reaching the rank 9 without the inner pellet, it would not be as valuable anymore. Therefore, rarely would any Sea of Souls Realm warriors go and hunt down rank 9 or 10 beasts, since it would not be that worth it. However, for the eagle beast, it was very different, as he still carried his inner pellet. If Ye Chen let the wolf take it, it would definitely increase his beast power cultivation, which would mean a lot for the wolf.</p><p>“I will let you taste my newly invented Thunder Devour then!”</p><p>He was holding his thunder disaster sword in his right hand and the golden sword in his left, crossing them both in front of him. Two rows of opposite thunder and lightning appeared and fused together, forming into a deep thunder ball. It was not the double sword style attack, since the real double sword style attack would only form a thunder ball at the very last minute. With enough thunder profound enhancement, it was able to fuse successfully.</p><p>Pap!</p><p>The destructive thunder and lightning spread out everywhere. Ye Chen being in the middle of them attacked the incoming inner pellet directly as if nothing could stop him.</p><p>“Now!”</p><p>The Sky Hunter Master had been waiting for the right moment where Ye Chen and the eagle beast were about to throw out their most powerful attacks and could no longer afford to be distracted. He jumped at the wolf, since in his opinion, it would be impossible for Ye Chen and the Eagle beast to beat each other in such a short time. And with enough of preparation, he would not be Affected by the wolf’s dreams anymore. After wounding the wolf badly, he would be able to use Murong Qingcheng to threaten Ye Chen, giving him no chance to fight back.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
