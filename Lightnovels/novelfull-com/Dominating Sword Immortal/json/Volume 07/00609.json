Her actual power was not weak at all, as she was a Sea of Souls Realm master warrior as well. As a part of a historical rank 6 martial institution in the Sky Martial Region, Hua Yingmei did not have a reason not to know about Ye Chen. Therefore, she seemed very friendly and welcoming toward Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>After chitchatting for a short while, Ye Chen jumped to explain the reason for their visit.</p><p>After hearing him, Hua Yingmei frowned and said with a forced smile, “If you guys were here a couple of months early, I would definitely give the Phoenix Tail Fruit to you for an exchange/ But unfortunately, this is a bad time. The only fruit we have in our martial school had been made into pellets with the other ingredients.”</p><p>Ye Chen said, “I heard that there is a phoenix tail tree inside the Flowy Spring Valley. Is there only one phoenix tail fruit on that tree?”</p><p>Hua Yingmei knew that Ye Chen was suspecting her for lying about what she had just said, so she explained, “Of course, there would be more than one fruit on this thousand years old phoenix tail tree, but our one is only nine hundred years old. It grows flowers every three years, and then another three years for fruits. Each time, it only grows one fruit. If you two do not believe me still, I can lead you two there to have a look. I believe you can tell the tree’s age with your eyes.</p><p>“That would not be necessary.” Ye Chen also knew that the quantity of the fruit had a lot to do with the tree’s age. Since she had already told them everything, then it would be disrespectful if he continued to doubt her.</p><p>“Warrior Ye is desperately in need of Phoenix Tail Fruit?” Hua Yingmei asked.</p><p>He nodded, “I need it to make an antidote. It is for saving a life.”</p><p>Hua Yingmei said, “Perhaps warrior Ye could go check in the Ruin Fire region inside the southern regions. Our tree is indeed moved from that region. Although I do not know if there is another tree, but I think it is better than no hope, right?”</p><p>“Ruin Fire Region?”</p><p>It was the Savage Race’s territory. Two-thirds of the whole south region was taken over by then, and the remaining one-third was with the other races. There were rarely any pure humans there.</p><p>“Where exactly in Ruin Fire Region?” A whole region was just too big; it would be impossible for even a Life and Death King warrior to look into every inch of a whole region within his or her lifetime.</p><p>“Our tree was found in the west side of the Savage Mountain. I have a map here, which I can give to warrior Ye.” Hua Yingmei took out an old map to hand it over to Ye Chen. Since this map was of no use to her anyway, she thought she might as well give it out as a kind favor.</p><p>Ye Chen took over the map and opened it. It only had the detailed picture for Savage Mountain, while the rest of them were only drawn out with simple lines.</p><p>Putting away the map, Ye Chen said slightly emotionally, “They all say that leader Hua is very friendly and welcoming. After seeing you today, I can confirm that you are indeed just like your reputation. I think leader Hua is at peak level Late Seas of Souls Realm, so you must be at the stage of trying to accumulate Zhen yuan and preparing for breaking through to Life and Death Realm. Here, I have a couple of medicinal plants which I would like to give to you as a thank you gift.”</p><p>Hua Yingmei was trying to politely reject him, saying, “It would not be that easy to break through to the Life and Death Realm, and I can only try my best. As for the thank you gift, it is really unnecessary. I did not help you that much after all.”</p><p>Ye Chen laughed. “Leader Hua, please do not reject my gift. What I am offering is the necessary ingredient to make extreme rank Sky Spirit Pellets. After you find the other ingredients, you will be able to cultivate a whole tripod of pellets, which could save you more than ten years of hard work.”</p><p>As he spoke, he took out a couple of plants with heavy spirit qi.</p><p>“Ah!” The leader made a noise. She needed to accumulate too much Zhen yuan for reaching Life and Death Realm, although she was still rather far away from the realm. She might not even be able to do so in her lifetime; but, who in this world could guarantee it anyway? If she did not prepare for it, then she would definitely not reach there. If she really managed to cultivate a whole pod of Sky Spirit Pellet, then she could indeed save ten years of hard work. Plus, even if she could not make it to the Life and Death Realm in the future, she would be able to try to make it to the half step king warrior stage.</p><p>“This!” Hua Yingmei was a bit embarrassed. She had actually kind of rejected the gift, and she was considering taking it again now.</p><p>“Here, leader Hua!” Ye Chen handed over the medical plants to her. These plants might be valuable, but he indeed had quite a lot of them, which he had obtained from the Treasure River Island and Savage Ruin Ancient Place. Most of them were from the former; but unfortunately, the island was no longer there. Otherwise, he would love to go there again.</p><p>Leader Hua took over the plants and said seriously. “I had just helped brother Ye a little bit, but you have just given me such precious presents. In the future, if you are ever in need, just tell me. I know some people in the valley after all.”</p><p>“Alright! Then we will excuse ourselves now.” Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng stood up to leave.</p><p>After leaving the palace, the two walked toward the valley entrance.</p><p>“This leader is really friendly.” Murong Qingcheng chuckled as she said.</p><p>Ye Chen nodded. “As the leader of a martial institution, the tolerance of this leader is indeed impressive. Perhaps she would even have a chance of reaching the Life and Death Realm.”</p><p>As they talked, the two arrived at the entrance. They then hopped onto their flying puppet and flew toward the Nine Dragon Mountain.</p><p>…</p><p>The Nine Dragon Mountain was one of the famous mountains inside Sky Martial Region. It took over a huge area that was almost as vast as an entire middle sized mountain range.</p><p>All the way, Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng could see powerful Sea of Souls Realm warriors flying toward the Nine Dragon Mountain. Some of them were alone, while the others are flying in groups. The latter were obviously from big martial institutions—some of them were riding on evil-looking flying beasts, looking rather classy. All of a sudden, the Nine Dragon Mountain seemed to have become one of the most popular places on this land.</p><p>“Haha, brother Ye! What a coincidence!”</p><p>On the right side, Hai Wuya and his brother and sister disciples approached on a water-element flying beast.</p><p>Ye Chen chuckled. “It is brother Hai after all!”</p><p>The two chatted for a while before introducing each other’s company to each other.</p><p>“Brother Ye, I have not seen you for a couple of months, but your name now is known by everyone in the Sky Martial Region! They all say that you are the strongest warrior just below the top five young warriors.”</p><p>To be very honest, when Hai Wuya first heard the news, he was indeed shocked. They all had obtained the Dragon Blood Plant from that trip they went to together, and they had all tried some of them as well. But, their progress was not as incredible as his at all. They had only managed to improve a little bit at best, while Ye Chen had reached over most of the famous young warriors already.</p><p>Ye Chen forced a chuckle. “You win some and you lose some…I guess there are a lot of people hating on me right now.”</p><p>“You are quite right! Besides the young five warriors, no one really dared to call themselves the strongest. Therefore, there must be a lot of them who are extremely unhappy about your existence. You might face a lot of challenges soon.”</p><p>“This is something that I cannot avoid…We will see.”</p><p>Ye Chen did not care about it. He knew that his fame came with a price, and if he did not want to pay the price, he should not have gotten famous.</p><p>“As long as you have the confidence for it!” Hai Wuya changed his subject, “Speaking of which, this time, Xia Houzun and Bai Wuxue have asked for a battle, and the impact it made has indeed been drastic. All of the top young warriors wanted to see what the power gap is like between them and the top five young warriors. The older generation of master level warriors also wants to know where the top five young warriors have reached, and whether they are threatening them. Anyway, this battle might be an epic event, with all of the master level warriors appearing there. Perhaps, half of the whole master level warrior population will show up.”</p><p>Ye Chen said, “The battle between Xia Houzun and Bai Wuxue will benefit the people watching the battle as well. I think that is the main reason.”</p><p>“Yeah, indeed! Cultivation, will power, and profound sense are all basic powers, and everyone has them. But, two people with a similar level of basic power clashing together might expose a massive difference, such as in their profound martial art. The profound sense within low rank profound martial arts are all similar, so the difference there will not be that severe. But how come the power gap would be still so huge? It is indeed because of the different martial movements and application. Plus, self-invented profound martial arts are way more suitable for oneself, so one can bring out their true power even more. With all of those added up together, it would be impossible to tell one’s power from their basic power level…It is all about the battling power.”</p><p>…</p><p>After three days, Ye Chen and the others arrived in the Nine Dragon Mountain. Hai Wuya said, “Xia Houzun and Bai Wuxue have picked the Nine Dragon Lake in the middle of the Nine Dragon Mountain for their battling location. Let’s go!”</p><p>By the time they arrived at the lake, the area was already full of people. Some of them were rather relaxed, as they had built up some wooden houses around the lake. They were continuing to build more stations for watching the battle that was going to take place soon.</p><p>“Indeed busy, huh!”</p><p>Scanning around, Ye Chen had seen at least hundreds of Sea of Souls Realm master warriors; there were even thousands of powerful normal Sea of Souls Realm warriors. Every single of them was extremely powerful, and had a rich aura.</p><p>“Ye Chen is here, as well as Hai Wuya!”</p><p>Some of the people recognized Ye Chen, as well as Hai Wuya, who was just as famous.</p><p>“There is a small mountain!”</p><p>The lake was huge, so it was not too crowded yet. Therefore, there were quite a few empty spots still left. Ye Chen controlled his flying puppet, carrying Murong Qingcheng and himself to fly over there; Hai Wuya followed him naturally. A small mountain would be enough to host them and more people.</p><p>“Shen Qianlang, the former top three master blade artist, is here.”</p><p>Although he had lost to Xiao Chuhe, who was one of the top five young warriors, no one doubted his power. So, the necessary respect had to be paid.</p><p>“Look! Another one of the top three blade artists Lin Chaonan is here!”</p><p>“Lin Channan, one of the top blade artists is here as well!”</p><p>“Snow Sword Master, the leader of the Snowy Martial School is here.”</p><p>“Also the first Thunder Master from the Thunder Region is here as well.”</p><p>They were mostly famous Sea of Souls Realm master level warriors that were recognized by everyone. As for regional Sea of Souls Realm master level warriors, they were not recognized at all; it was the Sky Martial Region after all, the center of the land. Without enough power and reputation, no one would appreciate someone.</p><p>There were still two more days before the battle. Within these two days, people continued to rush over. There were already more than five hundred Seas of Souls Realm master level warriors here. It sounded like a lot, but there were still millions of people out there in the world. So, even if there were thousands of them, it would not be that strange. After all, there would be dozens of Life and Death Realm warriors appearing in every century as well, not to mention Sea of Souls Realm master warriors.</p><p>The reason that the human race warriors were so powerful was that there were a lot of them. Without enough people, no matter how powerful individuals could be, with one dead, it would be one less. It was indeed what happened to the demon race in the ancient era.</p><p>Right before the battle, the atmosphere over the lake got pumped up again.</p><p>“Xiao Chuhe is here.”</p><p>“Sword Master!”</p><p>“Du Gujue!”</p><p>“Yan Fengfeng.”</p><p>“The leader of the top three master warriors! Xie Baiting!”</p><p>In a way, amongst them all, Xie Baiting was the most famous and powerful. It was not because of other reasons, but because he was the leader of the top three blade artists. With this title, he had not lost; even the top five young warriors had not been able to threaten him before.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
