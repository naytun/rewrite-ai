Eagle Demon was naturally fond of flying high in the skies. It only stayed in Moxiong mountains for about half a year, and traveled about during the rest of the time. One time, it ran into Sky Master Hunter, who wished to subdue it. The two fought a big battle, but then encountered a more than two hundred old monstrosity with an appalling strength. The two of them then joined hands and escaped with their lives. Afterward, they got closer to each other, though they still harbored malice for each other deep within.</p><p>“Hehe, they want to make a scene here at Moxiong Mountains? Truly don’t know how to spell death!” The Eagle Demon’s voice was exceptionally sharp like an eagle’s cry.</p><p>“They’re here!”</p><p>The Snake Demon’s eyes squinted, turning cold and sinister.</p><p>…</p><p>A few li away from the principal mountain, Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng stood in the sky.</p><p>“Check with your demonic eyes if there is any Phoenix Plume Tree.” Ye Chen could also check with his soul eyes, but it would waste excessive soul power. If he didn’t have to use it, he would rather not. In any case, using Murong Qingcheng’s demonic eyes was the same.</p><p>Faintly nodding, Murong Qingcheng worked her demonic power into her two eyes.</p><p>“Found it! Underneath the principal mountain is an underground river. There is a three meters tall Phoenix Plume Tree beside it, and it has many fruits as well.” Soon, Murong Qingcheng found the location and said cheerfully.</p><p>“We only need one fruit, that’s all. Let’s try to negotiate first.”</p><p>Bear Demon was a lot stronger than Black Wind Leopard, while the other two were slightly weaker than the latter. Such a lineup couldn’t be looked down upon. Ye Chen also needed to be cautious. Of course, if all negotiations failed, he would simply snatch the fruit by force. He was completely determined.</p><p>Shua! Shua!</p><p>With that, the two headed to the principal mountain and stopped outside a huge cave on the summit,” Is Tyrant Bear inside? Can I, Ye Chen, have a word?”</p><p>“Come in first!” A deep, tyrannical voice came from inside.</p><p>“Come, let’s go in.”</p><p>The bigger one’s skill, bigger the guts. Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng walked inside. In a few moments, the two arrived in the cave’s interior.</p><p>The cave’s interior was like a huge hall with three half-beast figures. Seated in the middle was a huge bear-man, five to six meters tall. He was the Tyrant Bear mentioned by the Black Wind Leopard without a doubt. To his either side was a snake demon with snake torso and human head as well as an eagle demon with a bird’s torso and human head. The three were observing Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>“What business do you have with me?” Tyrant’s Bear huge eyes looked down on Ye Chen.</p><p>Ye Chen slightly frowned and said, “I heard that there is a Phoenix Plume Tree in the Moxiong Mountains. This surnamed Ye has come to your place for one fruit. The price can be negotiated.”</p><p>“You want the Phoenix Plume Fruit?” Tyrant Bear was not astonished, as if already anticipating it.</p><p>“That’s right.”</p><p>“Zi zi, where did you hear our Moxiong Mountains have Phoenix Plume Tree?”</p><p>Ye Chen said, “Black Wind Leopard.”</p><p>“Sure enough!” Killing intent flickered in Snake Demon’s eyes.</p><p>“Gentlemen, one Phoenix Plume Fruit is not worth much for you. Can you spare us one? You’ll certainly not make a loss.” Murong Qingcheng voice sounded from within her muslin.</p><p>Eagle Demon resolutely stared Murong Qingcheng, “Since you’ve come to my Moxiong Mountains, you don’t need to cover your appearance. Remove your muslin, and perhaps we might agree.”</p><p>Ye Chen’s complexion slightly sank, “We’re here for Phoenix Plume Fruit, just say whether you agree or not.”</p><p>“Who are you? How dare you cut me off.” Eagle Demon glared Ye Chen with overflowing intent. Meanwhile, Ye Chen didn’t spare it a glance, merely looking at Tyrant Bear. The other lowered its head into a huge wine cup and said, “You can’t get the Phoenix Plume Fruit. We will help ourselves to your treasures and this woman.”</p><p>“Hehe!” Ye Chen smiled and his eyes narrowed before he said sharply, “Seems like you three have no intentions of trading with me.”</p><p>“Correct! He who has the bigger fist has the final say. In my Moxiong Mountains, Dragons have to lay down and tigers and have to crouch for me.” Tyrant Bear said disdainfully.</p><p>Ye Chen’s gaze lightly swept through the three demons and said indifferently, “You think you three are capable of subduing us?”</p><p>“What if you add us?” In the far rear, a black-robed man and an old man in multi-colored robe appeared.</p><p>Ye Chen turned his head and looked, his brows slightly raised, “Evil Demon Ancestor.”</p><p>“Hehe…Long time no see.”</p><p>Evil Demon Ancestor had a gentle smile on his face. However, this smile didn’t have amiability; instead, it brimmed with an unbridled killing intent.</p><p>Ye Chen said pensively, “Didn’t expect you to appear here. It’s really out of my expectations. I guess you two have been tailing us the whole time. What happened? You’re still not willing to give up?”</p><p>Give up?” Evil Demon Ancestor chuckled, “What’s mine, I’ll definitely get it. This time, you won’t escape even if you grow wings.”</p><p>Ye Chen’s face remained the same as he said indifferently, “If I can make you eat dust once, I can also do it twice. Though, this time will be the last.”</p><p>“Impudent!”</p><p>“Ye Chen!” Murong Qingcheng was somewhat anxious. The enemy was too powerful. Three demonic beasts and two powerful Master level figures…even if someone amongst the top five young warriors ran into such a force, they wouldn’t have an assured victory. Moreover, Ye Chen was still a little lacking compared to the top five young warriors in the end.</p><p>Ye Chen grasped Murong Qingcheng’s slender hand, “No worries!”</p><p>“Ahuh!”</p><p>For some reason, these words from Ye Chen had begun to bring Murong Qingcheng a sense of security.</p><p>“What? Even at this point you think you can escape?” Evil Demon was furious by Ye Chen’s attitude.</p><p>But, Ye Chen pointed at him and said, “Escape? The problem is I don’t want that. I want to kill you all.”</p><p>“What arrogance!”</p><p>Not just the Evil Demon Ancestor and Sky Master Hunter, even the three demons were infuriated at this point.</p><p>“Evil Demon Ancestor, no need to waste words. Just subdue him and that woman!” The Eagle Demon said sharply and took the initiative to attack. With a flap of wing, it shot toward Murong Qingcheng with outstretched claws, its speed not inferior to the Black Wind Leopard.</p><p>“Dark Sky Curtain!” Murong Qingcheng raised a black barrier.</p><p>Creek!</p><p>However, the Eagle Demon tore the barrier and entered with difficulty.</p><p>“Piss off!”</p><p>Ye Chen pulled out the Thunder Disaster Sword and repelled Eagle Demon with a slash.</p><p>“Kid, just hand yourself over, or you’ll merely suffer more in vain.”</p><p>At that moment, Tyrant Bear and Snake Demon also joined in.</p><p>Tyrant Bear had a humongous physique. Its every moment gave off a mountain-crushing aura. Striding out, it clenched its huge fist and punched at Ye Chen. Meanwhile, the Snake Demon’s body curled up before it raised its head high and spouted out a green light wave. It carried a toxic Qi that could make one dizzy.</p><p>“Gold Pattern!”</p><p>Even while confronting the three Demons, Ye Chen was fearless. The Thunder Disaster Sword let out a ripple, and eight golden beams of sword Qi formed a fan before spreading out like a ripple in water.</p><p>Amongst the three demons, Tyrant Bear was the strongest, and Snake Demon was at the second. The average strength of the three was more or less the same as the Black Wind Leopard. How could they resist Gold Patter from the Thunder Disaster Sword? They were forced to retreat one after another. The resulting shockwaves spread out all around the mountain, scraping off layers of the principal peak.</p><p>“Earth As Heavens!”</p><p>At this moment, the Evil Demon Ancestor pushed his Zhen Yuan to peak and punched out. This punch contained the Earth profound, upturning the heaven and earth completely. His aim was to make Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng lose their sense of direction and balance. At the same time, his left hand issued a palm strike, letting out a black-colored light sawtooth.</p><p>“Demonic Finger!”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng hurriedly flapped her wings to keep her balance. At the same time, a layer of black covered the index of her right finger. This black layer converged at the tip of her finger, turning into a black light ball which shot toward the light sawtooth.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Another intense shockwave spread out, and the top half of the summit crumbled completely. The splinters rained down the sky like angels raining down flowers from the heavens.</p><p>“Sky Bird Claw!”</p><p>At this moment, Sky Master Hunter, who was the most powerful of the bunch, also attacked. His right hand shrank into a claw, letting out a multi-colored claw light. The claw light cut through Murong Qingcheng’s black barrier like a tofu. If it hit her, she would lose all her fighting ability even though she had a demonic body.</p><p>It had only been a few moments since the battle broke out. By the time Ye Chen repelled the three demons, Murong Qingcheng had already encountered danger. But, his face remained calm as he stretched out his right finger, pointing toward the multi-colored claw. A finger glowing cyan intercepted its path, destroying it.</p><p>“Great Strength Bear King Art!”</p><p>On the other side, Tyrant Bear, who was much stronger than Black Wind Leopard, had an ugly expression as he immediately used a demonic beast specific secret art. Its body expanded by several times and an earthen-yellow luster curled around it. Striding out in huge steps, it again punched out. Even before the punch struck, everything within dozens of li started trembling.</p><p>“Dream Eater Wolf, come out!”</p><p>Destroying the Sky Master Hunter’s claw, Ye Chen lightly patted the Beast Plate on his waist.</p><p>“Aoooo!”</p><p>The Beast Plate trembled before a huge red-colored wolf charged out from it. The wolf’s head was covered with eyes that were tightly closed. As soon as it appeared, it raised its head and roared toward the heavens.</p><p>“This is?” the Sky Demon Ancestor pondered for a moment before his eyes opened wide, “Dream Eater Wolf…It’s actually a Dream Eater Wolf! Moreover, a tenth grade one!”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Repelling the Tyrant Bear with a slash, Ye Chen instructed the wolf, “Use Dreamland.”</p><p>The wolf nodded, and all the eyes on its forehead opened. With that, dense glum light rays spread out of the wolf’s body like a tide.</p><p>“Not good, retreat quick!”</p><p>Sky Master Hunter bellowed as he shot off into the distance after condensing a pair of Zhen Yuan wings. Even though Evil Demon Ancestor received his warning, he was slightly slow and was swallowed by the light rays. At the same time, the three demons also shared the same fate.</p><p>As the three demons and one man sank deeper into the light, their faces started to show struggling expressions. Amongst them, Bear Tyrant was the first to enter dreamland, and Snake Demon followed shortly after. On the other hand, Eagle Demon as well as Evil Demon Ancestor didn’t immediately enter, but were still in a half-in-half-out state.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
