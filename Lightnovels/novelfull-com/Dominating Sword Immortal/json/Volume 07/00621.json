It turned around, its red hair raised up in the air. That dim light spread out with its skull at the center, attacking right at the latter.</p><p>“Darkness Sky!”</p><p>With the reminder from the wolf, Murong Qingchengg had also noticed Sky Hunter Master’s movement. She pushed both of her hands forwards, and a black barrier appeared, covering most of the sky and stopping him from getting closer.</p><p>“Huh!”</p><p>Sky Hunter Master sneered as he reached both of his hands forwards and made a tearing gesture. With that, the barrier was cracked open immediately.</p><p>“Destruction Soul Wave!”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng’s expression stayed the same as she held a black light ball in her right hand before tightening her five fingers. The black light ball cracked open, turning into a black fan-shaped light pattern while shooting toward Sky Hunter Master.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The fan-shaped light wave brought with it a soul vibration which did not escape from Sky Hunter Master’s detection. He did not expect Murong Qingcheng to have soul attack martial arts. Without the dream eater wolf, he would not have to be afraid. But, since the wolf had such a powerful ability to create dreams, he knew that he would be attacked badly even with the slightest mistake.</p><p>“Sky Crow Major Art!”</p><p>The Sky Hunter Master tapped on the beast tag on his waist, and a huge number of crows appeared out of nowhere. They were only rank 4 beasts, which were equivalent to Late Condensed Reality Realm warriors, but there were just way too many of them…millions of them, covering the entire sky.</p><p>Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah!</p><p>A huge number of black crows welcomed that fan-shaped light wave which seemed just like black waves of water.</p><p>Without a sound, all of the black crows that clashed with the light started to fall down from the sky. Their eyes were rolled up, which was an obvious sign that their soul had been shattered.</p><p>On the other hand, the light wave dimed down quite a lot after being broken through by the crows; the soul vibration it carried was lowered to almost nothing. It did not seem capable of making an impact on the Sky Hunter Master.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Over on the other side, Ye Chen and the Wind Fire Pellet had clashed together as well, creating an enormous explosion and causing wind to blow heavily.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>Vaguely, a breaking exploding sound was heard.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>It was pure fear within the eagle beast’s eyes as he opened his mouth and puked out blood.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Ye Chen could tell that the pellet already had plenty of cracks, and that rich beast power was leaking out of them. He put away his gold sword and formed a fist with his left hand. That white dragon defense layer appeared on the fist before hitting right at the center of the pellet.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The pellet shook drastically before shrinking down suddenly into a tiny, bowl-sized jewel-like pellet.</p><p>Fishing it with his left hand, Ye Chen grabbed onto this shrinking pellet.</p><p>“Want to have my inner pellet? You have to die for that!”</p><p>The inner pellet was a part of Eagle Beast’s body, and was not that hard to control. He focused slightly and that pellet in Ye Chen’s hand moved immediately, looking as if it was about to get bigger again. Plus, beast power started to splash out from the surface of the pellet to burn Ye Chen’s palm.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>However, Ye Chen’s five fingers on his left hand were like hooks. No matter how the pellet moved, it was not able to get bigger by even an inch. As for that beast power that was pouring out, it could not get through the dragon bone defense layer at all. It could only slightly turn the defense layer dark. Of course, it would be impossible for Ye Chen to continue fighting with the eagle beast. He held his thunder disaster sword in his right hand, while throwing out a gold pattern, that gold sword qi left no space for the beast to escape.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Without the pellet, the eagle beast had only had two-thirds of his cultivation. Even if his physical power did not decrease, he would not able to handle Ye Chen’s sword qi.</p><p>Pooh! Pooh! Pooh! Pooh!</p><p>Blood splashed as the eagle beast was torn into pieces under that gold sword qi. Soon, that pellet finally calmed down as well.</p><p>“This eagle beast was indeed powerful. If I did not use my Thunder Devour attack, I might have to fight hundreds of rounds with him.” Ye Chen sighed a bit with the pellet in his hand.</p><p>“Beast Brambles!”</p><p>It took only couple of blinks for Ye Chen to kill the Eagle Beast, during which, the Sky Hunter had already broken through Murong Qingcheng’s defense layer, performing a strangling martial art. Gold light filled up around the wolf, a chain made of pure gold appearing out of nowhere and approaching the wolf as well. The long golden spike soon plugged into the wolf’s body.</p><p>Awoo!</p><p>The wolf wanted to struggle out, but the more it moved, the tighter the chain got. Moreover, those golden spikes brought it an extreme pain.</p><p>“Flying Sky Assassinate Cut!”</p><p>The black bat wings waved and Murong Qingcheng’s body flashed, dozens of her figures appearing from behind her back and attacking her opponent from different directions. It seemed impossible to tell which was real and which was fake.</p><p>“This woman is moving so fast!” However, Sky Hunter Master looked the same as he tapped on the beast tag on his waist, causing different roars to be heard. Meanwhile, a long-horned beast, a crow with black flames, and a dog beast with wings appeared out of nowhere, standing around him.</p><p>“Go! Go grab that woman! Remember, do not kill her.”</p><p>Although Murong Qingcheng was really powerful, it was mostly because of her unpredictable abilities. The three beasts that the Sky Hunter Master had let out were all rank 10 beasts known for their speed. They were all very powerful just like Hai Wuya at the master level Sea of Souls Realm. He did not know how much time he had spent in order to train these three beasts.</p><p>Hearing his order, three rank 10 beasts rushed out to battle with Murong Qingcheng, who was also extremely fast. Although all those beasts were not as fast as her, it was not hard for them to corner her with the three of them combined, keeping her far away from the Dream Eater Wolf.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Getting rid of Murong Qingcheng, Sky Hunter Master turned his head and looked over at the wolf. It was still fighting against the tightening gold chain, even if it made it more and more wounded; the pouring blood made its red hair look even brighter. Even so, it did not back down. It tried to open all of its eyes on the forehead wider, releasing a richer light.</p><p>“It is useless!”</p><p>Although Sky Hunter Master said that, his eyes still blurred for a second. He hurried to bite his own tongue, pushing his martial intent to the maximum and fighting that rich light. Meanwhile, he made a hand movement and that gold chain suddenly got tighter, the spikes going deeper into the wolf’s body.</p><p>Awooo!!</p><p>The wolf screamed.</p><p>“He is looking for death!” Ye Chen saw that happening from far away. His eyes went cold as he jumped into the air, turning into a beam of sword light.</p><p>“How could he take care of the eagle beast in such a short time?”</p><p>The Sky Hunter Master had been focusing on fighting off the wolf’s mental attack, so he did not pay attention to Ye Chen. It was only until the latter flew over that he started to realize what had happened. However, the second he got distracted a little, the wolf’s power sunk into his mind a bit more, which frightened him a lot. Hence, he hurried to focus back on the wolf.</p><p>“This cannot go on like this.” The Sky Hunter Master lifted up his palm, wanting to knock the wolf out.</p><p>“Void Shattering Finger!” Ye Chen reached out his left hand, pointing at the other from afar.</p><p>Pop!</p><p>The blue finger had shortened the space by a lot, and Ye Chen had arrived in front of Sky Hunter Master almost immediately. That horrifying space power had dimmed down his protective layer instantly, twisting it drastically.</p><p>“Damn! Sh*t!”</p><p>The Sky Hunter Master was furious. He was only one last step away before he could get the wolf. And as long as he got to train the wolf, combined with all the other beasts, no other master level Sea of Souls Realm warrior would dare to challenge him anymore.</p><p>“Ye Chen, I will remember you!”</p><p>The Sky Hunter Master was about to leave; the colorful wings on his back flapped, and he instantly got away from the wolf. He shot out into the distance, abandoning those three beasts that he had released.</p><p>“Where do you think you are going?”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng saw that Ye Chen had come for her, so she secretly let out a breath in relief. She then flapped the black bat wings on her back and a pattern appeared in the air.</p><p>Shoo! Despite being cornered by those three beasts, Murong Qingcheng suddenly disappeared completely. Next, a massive area of black light appeared suddenly in front of Sky Hunter Master, and a pitch black finger tapped on his forehead.</p><p>“You are looking for death!” His right hand formed into a claw, welcoming that incoming finger.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The blast wave spread out in the whole place while blood spilled out from the corner of her mouth as she was blown into the air. Although the Sky Hunter Master did not have to back out, he still could not move anymore.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>Meanwhile, a beam of sword light flashed, and Ye Chen appeared in front of him.</p><p>“You cannot run away now.” Ye Chen said lightly.</p><p>Sky Hunter Master was furious. “You brat, you really think you can make me stay here? If I want to go, no one can stop me.”</p><p>As he spoke, he separated into two. Two identical Sky Hunter Masters appeared, their soul and qi completely seeming the same. It was impossible to tell which one was real.</p><p>Next, the two figures flew in different directions.</p><p>Ye Chen did not care about it and also divided into two figures. Although they were not that identical, but besides the soul, it would be impossible to tell one from another.</p><p>The Ye Chen on the left held the golden sword, stabbing it into one of the Sky Hunter Masters. That extreme speed had made his own figure look surreal, as if it were a ghost in the water.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>There was no blood. So, this Sky Hunter Master was not real.</p><p>Meanwhile, the other Ye Chen chased right after the Sky Hunter Master with a speed that was obviously faster.</p><p>“Young man, if you do everything so brutally like this, it will not leave you a good ending.”</p><p>“This should not be coming from you.”</p><p>“If I manage to leave today, then I will return the ‘favor’ with ten times of the pain.” Saying that, the Sky Hunter Master separated himself into two of him again.</p><p>“Shadow Explosion!”</p><p>This time, Ye Chen did not separate into two of him anymore. Instead, he exploded himself up actually. Countless black shadows shot out, drowning both Sky Hunter Masters.</p><p>There was gold sword qi dancing within those intense black shadows, then there was the colorful claw shadow as well.</p><p>Knowing that he could not make it out of here, the Sky Hunter Master had an evil look in his eyes. He used all of his power in this battle with Ye Chen, but he was only slightly more powerful than the Evil Demon Master from before. And the only reason that the latter asked for him was because he had all those beasts on his side, which made his power higher than even Lin Tian and Lan Xieqing. Although he might still not be as powerful as the top five young warriors, it would take them a long time to kill him as well.</p><p>His three most powerful beasts had been sent out to take care of Murong Qingcheng. Right now, it would be impossible for them to make it back on time. Without the right beast, the Sky Hunter Master could only send out some of the weaker beasts to block out Ye Chen. But, they were all cut in half by Ye Chen and his sword. Soon, even he himself had lost an arm.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>That gold sword light brightened the sky as Ye Chen held the sword with both of his hands, appearing right behind the Sky Hunter Master. Next, a light blood mark appeared on the latter’s neck. The wind blew gently and Sky Hunter Master’s head shot up into the air, blood pouring out like a fountain from his neck.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
