So perhaps, I will just call it ‘Spiritual Sword’!”</p><p>Actually, it would not be suitable to call it that either, but there would be no problem, since it was only a name. It would not matter what it was called after all.</p><p>Putting away his sword, Ye Chen lifted up his head and looked over toward the Murong family’s direction.</p><p>Over at the horizon, a black dot was approaching. Soon, it expanded, revealing a beautiful body and the massive black bat wings behind her back.</p><p>“Murong, is something up?”</p><p>Just as Ye Chen started talking, Murong Qingcheng had already appeared in the valley. The black bat wings of hers slowly flapped, pressing the plants onto the ground.</p><p>“Beiming Hui…you should know him, right? He is right next to the family, asking for a battle with you.” Murong Qingcheng said.</p><p>“Beiming Hui!”</p><p>Ye Chen nodded. He had heard about this warrior before. Judging from the fact that it only took him seven attacks to beat Lan Xieqing, he should be very powerful, way more powerful than him half a year ago. Plus, since he was able to beat Lan Xieqing in seven moves, then he must have other secret attacks.</p><p>“Alright! I will go now.” However, Ye Chen was not that worried.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng wanted to say something, “You be careful. He is very powerful! He had beaten my father with only one spear attack. My father did not see it coming at all.”</p><p>“Such a fast spear speed?” Ye Chen had a vague idea of what he would be taking on.</p><p>Before he left, Murong Qingcheng took a look at the grass casually. What made her wonder was how rich and well-grown these plants were. Even the flowers had all blossomed, which was different from all the other grassland nearby.</p><p>…</p><p>Soon, Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng went back to the Murong family area.</p><p>“Warrior Ye is here!”</p><p>“I am so nervous! I wonder how warrior Ye is going to take on Beiming Hui. He does not look that easy to take on. That spear speed seems so horrifying!”</p><p>“Yeah, if he dared to challenge Ye Chen, then he must be prepared for it.”</p><p>Everyone was curious about what was happening while looking at Ye Chen in blue.</p><p>“You are Ye Chen!” Beiming Hui’s expression became slightly more serious. Although he chose to challenge Ye Chen actively because he thought the latter would be easier to take on than Du Gujue, it was just a thought. So, he knew that he should not underestimate the other at all.</p><p>Ye Chen said, “Indeed!”</p><p>“Alright, I, Beiming Hui, would like to challenge you right here, right now. I wonder if you would accept my challenge.” Beiming Hui landed onto the ground, holding his silver spear in his hand.</p><p>“You could beat Lan Xieqing with only seven moves, so you should have quite an okay power. I will accept the challenge.”</p><p>“I should have quite an okay power?”</p><p>Beiming Hui was a bit pissed off. He thought that Ye Chen was very arrogant, since by the sound of it, he probably thought that he could beat him easily.</p><p>“Cut to the chase! Let’s do this!”</p><p>Pointing his long spear toward the ground, Beiming Hui’s battling intent boiled. That aggressive Zhen yuan rumbled under that intent and drew out countless beams of vague spear shadows. There did not seem to be any flaws anywhere as that sharp qi spread out in the whole area.</p><p>“Such a powerful spear intent!” Everyone gasped.</p><p>‘No wonder he could beat Lan Xieqing with only seven attacks. This spear intent alone contains rank 4 peak level power, which is only half a step away from rank 5. Even his comprehensive ability seems to be more powerful than others’.’</p><p>Ye Chen did not speak a word as he rested his right hand onto the gold sword.</p><p>“Kill!” Beiming Hui roared as the muscle in his right arm expanded and veins bulged out. He threw out a spear attack toward Ye Chen, that sharp spear light seeming like a silver dragon waving his claws in the air. When it was tearing apart the air, a metal exploding sound was heard as if it was actually a dragon’s roar.</p><p>Chin!</p><p>Ye Chen looked serious too as he took out his gold sword from its scabbard. That gold sword light twisted at an angle before landing heavily onto that silver spear light.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The clash of both the silver long spear and the gold sword took place and a solidified shockwave spread out. A thick layer of pressed mud was blown away instantly, spreading out in all directions.</p><p>Ting! Ting! Dang! Dang!</p><p>Bright sparks spilled everywhere. The two’s speed was extremely fast; within half a blink, they had already changed six or seven battling locations, making it extremely hard for the audience to catch up.</p><p>“Silver Dragon Seven Attacks!”</p><p>Beiming Hui’s silver long spear seemed to come to life; the body had been wrapped by a burning Zhen yuan, making a loud noise before attacking Ye Chen aggressively from afar.</p><p>Ye Chen looked the same as he used his sword to block out that incoming long spear.</p><p>There were seven different formations within the Silver Dragon Seven Attacks, and the high cut was only one of it. The next one was whip kick, which was like a dragon tail waving in the air. After that was the long spear point attack. Countless gun flowers appeared in the air, targeting different spots over Ye Chen’s whole body. Soon, Beiming Hui changed his gun aura to attack Ye Chen’s lower body before flicking the attack upward. It was so powerful that it looked like it could flick a whole mountain up into the sky. After all of these movements, he stabbed out aggressively as if nothing could stop him at this stage anymore.</p><p>Five attack were launched in a row, with each one of them being so dangerous and powerful. However, Ye Chen had managed to block all of them easily without breaking a sweat.</p><p>When Beiming Hui’s sixth attack arrived in front of him, Ye Chen groaned quietly before performing his sword steps, attacking along with the light. That gold sword of his was waved down, the broken-moon like sword light seeming to fill up Beiming Hui’s sight within the same second as it appeared before expanding at a drastic speed.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Beiming Hui could not perform his sixth attack, so he waved out his spear and tried to block Ye Chen’s incoming attack.</p><p>Chin!</p><p>That sword attack was just too powerful, as even that long spear in Beiming Hui’s hand started to bend like a bow. His arms were going numb; although he managed to block out the attack, he was still blown into the air by the sword power.</p><p>“So powerful!”</p><p>Chu Zhongtian, who was watching from afar, squinted his eyes. Ye Chen was way more powerful than he had ever expected. He could tell that Beiming Hui could not handle Ye Chen trying to fight back.</p><p>As for those young warriors who came with Beiming Hui, they were all looking extremely serious. They started to doubt Beiming Hui’s power now. Whatever they had thought before, they started to think otherwise. They knew the power gap by now, Ye Chen would not be someone who could be beaten easily.</p><p>‘Right now, I cannot perform my Sky Bank attack yet, I will have to wait until his mental and physical condition starts to wear down. Otherwise, I do not think I can win at all.’ If it were someone else, Beiming Hui would have used his Sky Bank attack already, finishing the battle with one spear attack. But right now, his opponent was Ye Chen, and this Ye Chen was way more powerful than he had imagined.</p><p>Of course, Beiming Hui still had confidence that he could beat his opponent.</p><p>“Dragon Formation Spear!”</p><p>Besides his self-created Sky Bank attack, Beiming Hui had another extremely impressive spear attack, which would be even more powerful than the former attack. However, the Sky Bank was faster and had a higher accuracy, which would make a bigger impact.</p><p>Awhoo!</p><p>A dragon ringing sound was heard.</p><p>If Beiming Hui’s spear art had a resemblance of a flood dragon, then this attack would be based on a real dragon. There was distinguishable difference between a flood dragon and an actual dragon: the latter was more powerful and with more majesty, which meant that it was an evolved version of the flood dragon. And this spear attack would be Beiming Hui’s peak battling power.</p><p>“Lose now!”</p><p>After regaining his balance, Beiming Hui jumped at Ye Chen, that long spear forming into a massive silver dragon with its mouth wide opened as it attacked right at Ye Chen with its legs and tails waving in the air.</p><p>“Gold Pattern!”</p><p>Ye Chen’s gold sword was waved in the air, with which, the massive silver dragon was frozen there in the air before waves of gold pattern spread out. It shattered the silver dragon instantaneously before spreading toward Beiming Hui.</p><p>“What! I cannot block this! I cannot!”</p><p>Beiming Hui was shocked, unable to believe that Ye Chen would still have this powerful an ace attack. Under this sword, he did not even know what to do to avoid it, feeling like he had nowhere to escape to. All he could do now was passively defend and try to decrease the potential damage.</p><p>“Dragon Formation Spear!”</p><p>Beiming Hui lowered his body as the silver spear drew a circle around his body and a massive silver dragon wrapped him within, embracing him from the shockwave of the gold pattern attack.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The gold pattern looked beautiful as if it was a pattern brought up in a golden lake. There was no killing intent at all, but the gold pattern landed on the silver dragon and demonstrated its attacking power. The dragon only lasted for one blink of an eye worth of time before being shattered completely into nothingness.</p><p>Pooh!</p><p>Puking out a mouthful of blood, Beiming Hui held the long spear in his hand as he was blown backward, looking horrifyingly pale.</p><p>“So powerful! Brother Beiming did not even have a fighting chance!”</p><p>Those young warriors who came with Beiming Hui were all shocked at what they had just witnessed. Before, they had all indeed thought that Ye Chen was quite powerful, and that Beiming Hui challenging him would be a bad mistake. Even through Beiming Hui managed to convince them in the end, they were still thinking that it was too risky.</p><p>“It seems it is still warrior Ye who is more powerful. This Beiming Hui could only barely handle Ye Chen’s sword art after all.”</p><p>“Ye Chen is too powerful! I think he has the power to compete with even the top five young warriors now, although the chance of him winning might still be quite low.”</p><p>People inside Murong family looked excited. After all, the more powerful Ye Chen was, the better they looked. After Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng’s wedding, he would officially be one of their family members indeed.</p><p>“This Ye Chen is getting more and more powerful by the day! Haha!” Murong Zhishui revealed a smile, giving a glance at his daughter standing right next to him.</p><p>On his side, Su Ruihui chuckled and agreed as well. She was liking Ye Chen more and more. Moreover, he had even saved her life.</p><p>Chu Zhongtian stood on top of the mountain as he shook his head and sighed, “The gap is too massive! Luckily, I did not go and challenge him. Otherwise, it would just have been an unnecessary mistake.”</p><p>This sword attack of Ye Chen could probably wound him severely.</p><p>Without continuing his attack, Ye Chen looked at Beiming Hui who could not get any paler and said lightly, “What? Is this all you have got? Or do you still have some powerful attacks that you have not performed yet? Bring them on! Otherwise, I will not go easy on you from now on.”</p><p>“What? Warrior Ye did not even use all of his power yet?” Everyone understood what Ye Chen meant, so they could not help but gasp.</p><p>Of course Ye Chen had not used all of his power. Otherwise, it would be more than just some light wounds.</p><p>He chose not to kill him was because he did not want to have troubles with the Beiming family. In addition, he also wanted to see Beiming Hui’s most powerful attack.</p><p>Wiping off the blood from the corner of his mouth, Beiming Hui stared at Ye Chen without looking away at all, “I admit that challenging you this time is me hurrying things up. But, no worries, you will just have to wait. At the end of the day, I will be the one winning. The coming up attack is the Sky Bank which was created by me. Amongst the young warriors, no one could make it out without wounds.”</p><p>“Interesting name! But, I do not think it represents anything except the fact that you just have not met anyone powerful enough.” After pausing for a bit, Ye Chen continued to say, “Oh right, I actually created a new attack myself. I would like to see if your attack is faster or mine.</p><p>Powerful attacks could only be as valuable in actual battles. So, it would be a perfect opportunity to test out Beiming Hui’s Sky Bank with his new Spiritual Sword attack.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
