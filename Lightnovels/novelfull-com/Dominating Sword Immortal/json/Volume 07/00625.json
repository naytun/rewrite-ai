One of them was a Sea of Souls Realm warrior while the other  was only an Early Clasping Yuan Realm warrior; one of them was famous  all around the world while the other was not even heard of in the Sky  Wind Nation. Being approved by Ye Chen was something he had never even  dreamt of.</p><p>“I would like to give you this Sky Water Sword Spell as a gift. If  you can understand it completely, you will be able to win against most  warriors below the Late Clasping Yuan Realm.”</p><p>He took out a green secret manual and handed it over to Ye Xiaoshui.</p><p>“Ah! Really? For me?”</p><p>Ye Xiaoshui knew that it was not a normal martial art just by the sound of the name. He took it over emotionally.</p><p>“Alright! I will not disturb you then!”</p><p>After giving the gift, Ye Chen took Murong Qingcheng and his siblings  to leave the Ye family. Ye Xiaoshui still felt like he was dreaming as  he watched them leave.</p><p>It was until they had left his sight that he could think again.</p><p>“I wonder what kind of ranking this sword art is at.”</p><p>He opened the manual and started reading, “Sky Water Sword Spell,  earth realm high-rank sword art, sixteen movements in total. The last  movement can compete with earth realm top rank sword attacks.”</p><p>“It is earth realm top rank sword art! Such a high ranking!”</p><p>Normally, if the last movement of the martial art could reach the  next level of power, it would mean that it was a very high-end martial  art.</p><p>Although Ye family was full of manuals right now, and there were  quite a lot sword art ones as well, he was not that talented. He could  only learn the earth realm low-rank sword arts. He was happy to have a  mid-rank earth realm sword art already. It was his dream to have a top  rank earth realm manual, and he could not believe he actually got one  out of the blue.</p><p>What he did not know was that if it were not for his talent and  comprehensive ability, Ye Chen was planning to give him a top rank earth  realm sword art, since they were not that valuable for the latter  anymore. It was normal for him to give away some of them, since the fact  that he was able to train his gold pattern to completion was nothing  compared with an earth realm top rank manual. He did not even know if Ye  Xiaoshui could learn it at all.</p><p>What Ye Chen did not know was that this small gesture of his had  created a new famous sword artist for the Ye family. But of course, it  would not happen for a long time.</p><p>“Huh! Li Zhao from Tuo Rudra Nation used his high-rank sword art to  beat me within three movements last time. Three months…Give me three  months, and I will make him pay.”</p><p>Because of Ye Chen, the young generation inside the Sky Wind Nation  and the older generation started to aim for the outside world. They were  no longer full of pride and contentedness with what they had got. They  now had a common goal, which was to go out and compete with more and  more people. They had finally started to understand exactly how big the  world was.</p><p>…</p><p>After completing the Gold Pattern, Ye Chen finally let down  everything else and hung out with his young siblings and Murong  Qingcheng. They traveled a lot of places, and not just in the Sky Wind  Nation, leaving footprints in some of the famous ruins. Ye Xuan and Ye  Xiaoxiao were obviously having a great time.</p><p>But of course, they came back after two days.</p><p>On this day, something happened that shocked the whole South Rudra Region.</p><p>Every city in South Rudra Regions started to have a store with  “Knowledge Pavilion” board hanging on top. No matter it was newly built  or renovated, they were all extremely massive and fancy looking. There  was only one type of product available for purchasing, and that was  books.</p><p>What kind of books?</p><p>It was named “Master Level Warrior Ranking”.</p><p>As for what were master level warriors, besides some of the out-of-the-world mortals, no one really knew.</p><p>The book listed seventy-two master level warriors, with each one of  them being extremely powerful. They would be able to beat and kill  normal master level warriors within a second. Since there were countless  master level warriors in this world, the top seventy-two warriors among  them must be extremely powerful.</p><p>Once it was officially released, it got great attention.</p><p>In fact, the South Rudra Region already had it a couple of days later  than the rest. The Sky Martial Region got it first, which was on the  tenth of October. It was already December now where Ye Chen was, which  was one month later than the rest. After all, the whole land was too  massive, and it would be impossible to cover all of it at the same time.  However, this was only the first release, so it should get back to  normal in the future.</p><p>The shops popped up in every city, which meant it was present in Luo city as well.</p><p>Outside the shop, people lined up for blocks. Every powerful warrior  was here basically, including some of the powerful warriors from martial  institutions nearby.</p><p>“Haha, I got it! It is not expensive at all! Only ten low-rank spirit stones.”</p><p>“I cannot get in! Can we look at it together?”</p><p>“I have not seen it yet. Why should I give it out for everyone to  read? After you get your own, then we can discuss about it. I will read  it first!”</p><p>“Damn! So stingy!”</p><p>Although he was saying that, he was already trying his best to squeeze in the shop for a book.</p><p>“Don’t rush guys! There are still plenty of them.” The owner of the  store said with a big smile on his face. No matter how many people there  were, they would be able to get a book eventually.</p><p>After another half an hour, the pavilion finally quieted down. There  were not that many people coming in and out of the store like before. Of  course, it was still not empty yet.</p><p>Inside the restaurant!</p><p>Inside the café!</p><p>Almost every place that had people were talking about the ranking.</p><p>“Look, Ye Chen is in the ranking as well!”</p><p>“Where? Let me see!”</p><p>“Ranking forty-eight!”</p><p>…</p><p>All of a sudden, each shop was packed with people.</p><p>“Sir, give me one!” Li Daoxuan went to the store.</p><p>“Alright, here!”</p><p>The owner took out a brand new book with golden characters written on the leathery cover, which seemed really hard to destroy.</p><p>After paying ten top rank spirit stones, Li Daoxuan walked out.</p><p>Inside a tea café…</p><p>Li Daoxuan stared at the forty-eighth position, where “Ye Chen” was  written. What he had done and accomplished was written below. A rating  was featured as well.</p><p>In other cities!</p><p>Yan Chihuo, Bing Ling, and the others had all bought the book, and  they had all seen the name. It was not a low one, ranking at  forty-eight. There were only four warriors from the whole southern  region that managed to enter the ranking, and only Ye Chen from the  South Rudra region. Amongst the four, Ye Chen had the highest ranking,  and he was also the youngest. The others were at least eighty years old,  and the oldest was already almost two hundred years old.</p><p>Most importantly, looking at all of the seventy-two warriors, there  were only six of them who were under the age of thirty. It was not hard  to imagine how powerful Ye Chen would have to be to be ranked  forty-eighth.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
