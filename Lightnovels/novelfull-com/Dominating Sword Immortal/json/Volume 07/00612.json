But, it was still not quiet. For the Seas of Souls Realm warriors, not sleeping for a couple of days straight was as easy as drinking water. It would not affect their mental condition or energy level at all. Of course, here, during the night, no one would yell or cheer to ruin this peaceful quietness. They only chatted with people they were friends with while drinking tea and wine.</p><p>“Brother Ye, this puppet house of yours is really rare. It should also come with a defensive layer of its own, right?” Hai Wuya studied the puppet house’s interiors as he continued to comment about how impressive the Puppet Martial School’s work was. Ye Chen’s flying puppet and house, as well as Yan Fengfeng’s flying ship were all very impressive. It would not be that hard to tell how exactly powerful they were before.</p><p>Ye Chen chuckled, “Small thing…”</p><p>This puppet house was found during that trip into the Puppet Martial School branch with the second disciple of the Flowy Snow Martial School, Feng Yanrou. It would not be much when used in battles for intense defense, but it indeed was very convenient.</p><p>“Sister Murong, the qi you carry seems to be slightly different from other normal demi demons…” Yan Fengfeng took a sip of the water as she said to Murong Qingcheng. She called Ye Chen ‘brother disciple’, so she naturally would call Murong Qingcheng as sister disciple.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng said, “I took a slightly different path from the other normal demi demons. I have cultivated the demon power.”</p><p>“No wonder!”</p><p>Yan Fengfeng was not too surprised. Murong Qingcheng had the perfect demi demon bloodline, so there were two paths she could choose—cultivating Zhen yuan or demon power. Normal demi demons could only pick the first option, and they could not cultivate the demon power, which was more powerful. But, there was also a downside of the demon power. In the true spirit continent, there were not much demon power in general. The pellets that worked for human warriors would not be useful for demi demons who cultivated the demon power. As a consequence, it would be extremely hard to make a breakthrough. Yan Fengefeng guessed that there must be a rare chance that Murong Qingcheng had encountered to get to this level.</p><p>The night had gotten darker, but no one present sensed a hint of drowsiness. They were all chatting as they waited for the day to come.</p><p>…</p><p>The red sun slowly raised up in the sky once again, dyeing the Nine Dragon Lake with a gold-red color, reflecting the sunshine. All of the warriors who did not sleep for the night were still waiting, becoming more and more emotional and excited for the upcoming battle.</p><p>“It is today, the set battle for Xia Houzun and Bai Wuxue… I wonder when they are going to do it though. The wait is so long!”</p><p>“No hurry! We have been waiting for this long. Who cares about the remaining half a day!”</p><p>“Xia Houzun is still rather close to the Nine Dragon Mountain, so he should arriving first, right?” Someone guessed.</p><p>Outside the wooden house, Ye Chen put away his puppet house and stood right next to Murong Qingcheng by the edge of the mountain, enjoying the warmth of the bright new sunshine.</p><p>“Here he comes!”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng had a great sight; it seemed that only Yan Fengfeng in her real form would be able to compete with her.</p><p>“It is Bai Wuxue.” Ye Chen looked over. At the horizon of the sky, a white figure was moving closer and closer.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>Bai Wuxue was moving extremely fast, and within couple of breath, he had already reached Nine Dragon Mountain before landing onto a steep mountain. He wore white clothes with small flowers stitched on top. The outfit looked humble like the clouds in the sky.</p><p>“Bai Wuxue, I did not expect that you would come earlier than Xia Houzun.” Xia Chuhe, as a fellow top five young warrior, opened his long-shut eyes and spoke.</p><p>Bai Wuxue said lightly, “I always like to arrive earlier than my opponent. Sorry for the wait.”</p><p>“I hope to have some enlightenment from watching the battle between you two.” As the former spoke, he closed his eyes once again.</p><p>Bai Wuxue looked back and made a quick eye contact with Lu Shaoyou while the latter looked extremely calm. Anyway, he did not speak a word.</p><p>“Now that Bai Wuxue is here, Xia Houzun will arrive shortly I suppose. But, aren’t we still missing one warrior from the top five young warriors? Why is he still not here?”</p><p>The young warriors present were Bai Wuxue, Lu Shaoliu, and Xiao Chuhe. Adding Xia Houzun, there were four of them, so they were still missing one.</p><p>“Speaking of which, I do not think I have ever seen the other one before. I heard that it is a ‘she’.”</p><p>“How could we meet them? That last top warrior was decided by all four of them. It means nothing if the world does not know about it, since why would the four of them all agree then?”</p><p>“Yeah! Being able to be recognized by all four top warriors, she must have a corresponding power.”</p><p>Ye Chen asked Yan Fengfeng, “Sister Yan, do you know about this fifth top warrior?”</p><p>She shook her head. “I have only seen her once before. But, I have no idea who she was, or where she was from. All I knew was that everyone called her Godly Sharp Princess. If I have guessed it right, she must also be a demi beast herself as well.”</p><p>Godly Sharp Princess?</p><p>Ye Chen shook his head. ‘This is indeed mysterious.’ He thought to himself.</p><p>After waiting for a while, a golden human shadow appeared from the southwest direction. Before the person had even arrived, that aggressive aura had already reached there.</p><p>“Xia Houzun…It is Xia Houzun!”</p><p>“Finally here!”</p><p>“This aura is making me feel weak and not want to fight with him.”</p><p>“Such an aggressive power! He is indeed like his reputation.”</p><p>The excited atmosphere seemed to be contagious as it spread across the whole Nine Dragon Lake.</p><p>Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng exchanged a look, feeling like they had seen a second Chu Zhongtian. Of course, Xia Houzun’s aura was nothing that Chu Zhongtian could compete with, since one of them was one of the top young warriors while the other was only famous within the South Rudra Region.</p><p>“Bai Wuxue, you are still the same.”</p><p>Xia Houzun laughed. A gold light flashed once before landing onto the middle of the lake water. That aura leaking out of his body was unstoppable, bringing up lake patterns as if he was the center of the whole universe.</p><p>Xia Houzun was very massive; his shoulders were wide and his legs were long. Wearing the bright shiny gold robes of his, he styled his hair in a tail, with a gold crown on top. His eyebrows were thick and long, running all the way into his sideburns. His eyes were like a pair of cold shining stars in the dark night; power itself seemed to be written within.</p><p>“I wonder what Chu Zhongtian would think if he were here.” Murong Qingcheng could not help but wonder.</p><p>Ye Chen said, “Do not underestimate him. Judging only by his body and natural talent, no one seems to be able to reach beyond him. Even people who could compete with him do not seem to exist. As for the future, it all is still very uncertain.”</p><p>Standing on that steep mountain peak, Bai Wuxue said, “You are also still looking the same.”</p><p>“Cut the bullcr*p and let’s do one thousand attacks now.”</p><p>Xia Houzun did not want to wait for him to come down, so he pointed out his right index finger toward Bai Wuxue.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The mountain under Bai Wuxue’s feet exploded like snow in the sky. Soon, countless tiny stones spread out with Bai Wuxue being the center, as if a massive power field was formed next to him.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Bai Wuxue waved his right hand, and the stones in front of him were shattered into nothingness. Soon, he jumped out and arrived directly in front of Xia Houzun while throwing out a palm attack at the same time.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>That palm looked like it came from a god, causing a massive palm print to appear on the surface of the lake. What was scarier was that the lake itself seemed to be frozen for some reason, and that palm print was actually craved within it physically.</p><p>“Natural Painter!”</p><p>Xia Houzun laughed as his index finger drew a circle around his body. The space pattern became organized, forming into a twisted defensive layer. After handling Bai Wuxue’s palm attack, it shattered immediately, but Xia Houzun was not wounded at all.</p><p>“Surreal Emperor Finger Attack!”</p><p>After using his defensive layer to block out Bai Wuxue’s palm attack, Xia Houzun fought back sharply, pointing out his finger attack. An emperor warrior figure appeared behind him, pointing his finger out as well toward Bai Wuxue.</p><p>“Qi Flow Hundred Sky!”</p><p>Meanwhile, Bai Wuxue landed onto the surface of the lake, the water turning solid wherever he stood. His left hand covered the front of his chest while his right hand was placed vertically. He expanded his five fingers slightly, welcoming that powerful finger power from Xia Houzun.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!…</p><p>There were dozens miles of ground in the Nine Dragon Lake. As the two clashed together, the solid lake surface moved up and down before eventually exploding into countless water columns. Each one of them was dozens of meters thick and thousands of meters tall. The lake horizon suddenly lowered by two hundred meters.</p><p>“So powerful! Each movement and attack of theirs is invincible!”</p><p>“Top five young warriors are indeed a bunch of monsters!”</p><p>Everyone present held their breath, their faces red from doing so.</p><p>“Impressive! So impressive! Just impressive!”</p><p>Hai Wuya said three “impressive” in a row. He knew that he would not be able to compete with them for sure, and might not even be able to handle the blast waves from their attacks. That was the top five young warrior’s true power, each one of them being the top of them all; the rest normal warriors could only look up to them.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Ye Chen said lightly, “Right now, they are still just testing each other’s power, using other warriors’ profound martial arts.”</p><p>Of course, self-invented profound martial arts would be the most powerful ones, because it would be the most suitable. They would come with deeper understandings and feelings, which would allow the warriors to perform it to its limitation.</p><p>“I really did not know. It definitely caught me off guard.” Lin Chaonan, as the master level warrior of the top three blade artists, was indeed shocked by what he just witnessed, even though he was slightly more powerful than Shen Qianlang, who was previously one of the top three blade artists. Although he had also improved his martial arts and cultivation in the past two years, he still did not have the confidence to fight any of the top five young warriors.</p><p>Xie Baiting nodded. “Just based on the power now, they should already not be underestimated. If they were using their real power, even I would have to treat it seriously.”</p><p>Being able to make Xie Baiting say that he would have to take it seriously would be almost impossible, since he had already been the no.1 master level blade artist of the whole land for more than ten years. And so far, no one had managed to affect his position.</p><p>“Top five young warriors…”</p><p>Du Guje sat one a rock, his eyes shining brightly. Right then, he did not look like he was wounded at all; it was not hard to tell how excited he was.</p><p>In the middle of the lake, Bai Wuxue and Xie Houzun had already exchanged hundreds of attacks. However, no one was able to do anything to the other, because each movement and attack of theirs had reached the peak of their speed, power, and techniques. Even the simplest movement of theirs had a great damaging power, and was able to serve as both defense and attack.</p><p>Eight hundred attacks!</p><p>Nine hundred!</p><p>One thousand!</p><p>“Indeed. It would be impossible to win against you without using all of my power.” A gold fog arose from Xie Houzun’s body, generated by the extreme movement of his qi and blood.</p><p>Meanwhile, the space around Bai Wuxue’s body started to get blurry as he said coldly, “Bring out all of your power! Let’s end this!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
