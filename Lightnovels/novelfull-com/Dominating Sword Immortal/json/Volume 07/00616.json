However, there was obviously nothing they could do about it, since it was not the kind of thing that one could have only by desiring it. Only people with enough power would be highly-valued by them. The strongest warrior right below the top five young warriors was not some small title. As for Xie Baiting, no one would dare to question his power, since he had been the no.1 master level blade artist for a couple of decades now; his power could only be described as unpredictable. Being ranked among the top fifty master level warriors would be an expectation for him already. It was only a question whether all of the top five young warriors could be ranked in as well.</p><p>“Time is running out!”</p><p>Du Gujue secretly tightened his fist; he had never been this eager to ameliorate his power. They were all young warriors, and even though they could be rather reckless, it would be impossible to stay completely away from the temptation of being rich and famous. The ones who had really lost the passion had already lost their power of competing.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Du Gujue looked extra determined as he glanced at where Ye Chen was standing and said with a loud voice, “Ye Chen, I will battle you right here in one year. Of course, if you do not show up, I cannot do anything about that either.”</p><p>“Eh? Du Gujue is challenging Ye Chen in one year?”</p><p>“Judging from the current situation, although Du Gujue and Ye Chen are not as powerful as the top five young warriors, they are approaching the level at an extreme speed. That is quite rare for anyone to accomplish, including warriors like Lan Xieqing, Lin Tian, and the others. They are all very far away from the top five young warriors.”</p><p>“It seems like Du Gujue wants to use one year as a deadline for him to get better faster. If he is able to beat Ye Chen, that would mean he has achieved more.”</p><p>“The epic battle between the top two monster-like martial geniuses…It should not be that far off from the battles between the top five young warriors.”</p><p>“No, I think it might be even more worth watching than that, since a lot of people want to know which level they would grow to in one year’s time. Do not forget, they had only reached the Sea of Souls Realm one or two years ago. With one more year worth of time, even if they do not grow to that level, they would be close…very close actually. They might even be able to compete with them.”</p><p>“You might actually be right.”</p><p>Hearing that Du Gujue wanted to battle with Ye Chen in one year, everyone’s just-calmed-down hearts started beating fast again. Countless pairs of eyes looked over at Ye Chen, wanting for him to respond.</p><p>Ye Chen said without hesitation, “I will be here!”</p><p>Du Gujue was not someone who should be underestimated; some people got more powerful when competing with stronger people. Ye Chen knew that his growth would only inspire his growth. But, he also really wanted to know if Du Gujue would be able to battle with him. If the latter could, then he knew that his future opponent would very likely be Du Gujue.</p><p>“Ye Chen said yes so quickly!”</p><p>“Naturally! They are both very powerful warriors. If Ye Chen did not say yes, then it would not be a good look for him.” Everyone discussed fervently.</p><p>All of a sudden, a warrior walked out of the crowd. It was indeed one of the top three master level blade artists, ex-member of that group to be more accurate, Shen Qianlang.</p><p>Lin Chaonan saw him walk over and said to Xie Baiting, “It seems like brother Shen could no longer hold it down anymore. This ranking would be a great opportunity for him.”</p><p>Xie Baiting said, “Ah! Well, compared to Bai Wuxue and Xia Houzun, I want to know more about Xiao Chuhe’s blade art level to be honest.”</p><p>Xie Baiting just had finished talking when Shen Qianlang flew to the center of the lake and said loudly, “Xiao Chuhe, could I use this opportunity to battle with you?”</p><p>He had lost to the latter two years ago, losing his title as one of the top three master level blade artists. Today, he wanted to not only regain his old title, but also prove to the world that he would not accept himself being a mediocre or subordinate warrior, even if it were to one of the top five young warriors.</p><p>Xiao Chuhe walked over step by step, “Alright, my blade intent is at its peak! Since you have come out to challenge me, I will give you a chance.”</p><p>The battle between Bai Wuxue and Xia Houzun had already inspired Xiao Chuhe’s battle and blade intent, and Shen Qianlang’s challenge was right on time.</p><p>“These two want to battle as well!” Gao Changtian was intrigued, which was reasonable, since all of the top five young warriors were being watched closely.</p><p>“Let’s do this!” Xiao Chuhe stood on the surface of the lake, holding his blade in his left hand.</p><p>Whoo!</p><p>Whoo!</p><p>Whoo!</p><p>Shen Qianlan slowly breathed in and out, regulating his condition. Xiao Chuhe was definitely one of the fastest growing blade artists. He was challenging the latter not because he had one hundred percent confidence in winning, but because it might be the only chance he would have.</p><p>“Wavy Scramble!”</p><p>Combined with his breathing, Shen Qianlang looked his best. He was calm and responsible, while the audience was extremely excited. That exploding power was like an endless ocean rising wave after wave, making people scared.</p><p>Chin!</p><p>As he took out his blade, the water under Shen Qianland’s feet suddenly rose up, turning into massive waves and bringing him toward Xiao Chuhe, who was not that far away. A beam of blade light appeared, and the Nine Dragon Lake was no longer calm as it started to pressure Xiao Chuhe.</p><p>“Break!” The lake water under Xiao Chuhe continued to stay calm as he yelled once while taking out his long blade, holding it with both his hands and throwing out a blade attack.</p><p>Splash!</p><p>The wave was shattered, just like Shen Qianlang’s blade light.</p><p>Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang!</p><p>The two were both top blade artists, and although their battle was not as epic as the one between Bai Wuxue and Xia Houzun, each blade attack was deadly, making it seem even more intense.</p><p>Shen Qianlang was indeed one of the top former master level blade artists. His blade aura was so powerful that each blade attack of his seemed like a massive wave from the ocean. With dozens of blade attacks in a row, it gave people a truly intense feeling.</p><p>With him waving out those blade attacks, nature itself around them seemed to have changed and become extremely intense. If it were a normal blade artist fighting with him, the blade artist would have had been oppressed by that aura alone. Shen Qianlang’s determination gave people the feeling that he had turned into an endless, unpredictable ocean.</p><p>If Shen Qianlang were an ocean, then Xiao Chuhe would be a blade artist that trained in the ocean. That blade in his hand was not that fast or fancy-looking, but all incoming waves were shattered by the blade attacks without having a fighting chance.</p><p>“The blade power is very dense, with no leakage at all…His mind and body seem to all come together. Such a scare blade artist!”</p><p>Gradually, Ye Chen could sense Xiao Chuhe’s power. If Bai Wuxue was like the clouds which were unpredictable, and Xia Houzun was like thunder that seemed so aggressive and brutal, then Xiao Chuhe would be the earth, the land that carried everything. Unless one had an extreme power, it was impossible to beat a martial artist like him with one attack. It would be doomed to be a long-lasting battle.</p><p>“Wave Rider!”</p><p>Shen Qianlang knew that it would not be good for him if this battle continued for long. So, he carried the wind and wave on his command and rose up into the sky before throwing an aggressive attack out.</p><p>This blade attack had been thrown out in the moment, but it was Shen Qianlang’s most powerful blade attack.</p><p>“Ocean Separation!”</p><p>Xiao Chuhe was still standing where he was. Facing this incoming attack from Shen Qianlang, he did not back out or avoid it, just throwing out blade attacks calmly as if it were not wave after wave of an aggressive ocean that were attacking him.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>Shen Qianlang’s most powerful blade attack disappeared completely. On the surface of the Nine Dragon Lake, a blade mark appeared that spread out all the way to the edges. It was so deep that it separated the whole lake in half, looking extremely terrifying.</p><p>Pooh!</p><p>Puking out a chunk of blood, Shen Qianlang was blown backward; a blade mark appeared on his chest as well. Although that attack did not land directly on his body with the protection of his armor, that extremely focused blade power had already punctured through and wounded his internal organs. Mentally, it was not that painful; on the contrary, he actually felt relieved. In the future, he would not have to battle with Xiao Chuhe anymore, and would not have to bear the pressure that he needed to beat the latter.</p><p>“Such a powerful attack! Shen Qianlang did not even have the chance to fight back at all.”</p><p>Xie Baiting shook his head. This battle might not be as incredible as before, neither was it that intense. Although it was rather intense for Shen Qianlang, but his opponent was Xiao Chuhe, who was like the calm, endless land right from the beginning. Although Shen Qianlang’s blade art seemed very aggressive, it was not threatening for his opponent at all. Right from the beginning, Shen Qianlang did not have the chance to fight back at all; he was only playing along according to Xiao Chuhe’s tempo and pace. Seeing this kind of a battle, even Xie Baiting could not help but feel a chill run down his spine. He knew that even if their cultivation was at a similar level, he would only have a forty percent chance of winning.</p><p>“Xiao Chuhe! Indeed, impressive!” The reason Gao Changtian could become the master of the pavilion was not just because of his excellent observation skills; his own power would naturally not be that weak either. As a master level Sea of Souls Realm warrior himself, he could tell that Shen Qianlang was very powerful. Although it would be hard for him to be ranked into the top twenty, but the top twenty-five should be fine. It was an intense battle full of expansions, but his opponent was Xiao Chuhe. There would be no chance of effectively fighting back at all.</p><p>“Xiao Chuhe, you can be ranked in the top fifteen as well.” Gao Changtian announced.</p><p>Everyone had no doubt in what he had just announced as they started to discuss quietly.</p><p>“This battle was so simple, but why am I having goosebumps?”</p><p>“Me too!”</p><p>“Do you guys think that Shen Qianlang was like a flying bug on a spider web? No matter how hard he tried, he would eventually fall into the mouth of the spider.” Someone expressed in the most accurate way possible.</p><p>Even after beating Shen Qianlang, Xiao Chuhe looked the same. He looked toward Lu Shaoyou, who was looking normal as if he did not care about what just went down. He said, “Lu Shaoyou, I will challenge you for a battle after one year.”</p><p>“Yes, you may.” Lu Shaoyou said lightly.</p><p>“Another battle in one year!”</p><p>Everyone was even more excited now. Adding the battle between Du Gujue and Ye Chen, there would be two epic battles in one year. Regardless of what happened, they would all be there to watch the battles in one year.</p><p>After Shen Qianlang and Xiao Chuhe finished their battle, the lake quieted down again.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Ye Chen knew that there would not be anyone asking him for a battle anymore. Even if there were, they would be small boring ones.</p><p>At that moment, more and more people started leaving, and just like that, the Nine Dragon Lake became empty again regardless of how busy it was during the past few days. Although it was over, but what happened here would be passed around within the Sky Martial Region for a long time.</p><p>The matter about the master level warrior ranking would be a well-spread news not that long after, causing a great impact.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
