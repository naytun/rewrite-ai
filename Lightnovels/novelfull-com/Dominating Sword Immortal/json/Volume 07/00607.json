So, it would take them less than half of a month to reach the mountain. Plus, it was not meaningless for them to be here either, as they were waiting for the news from the pavilion.</p><p>There were ten branches for the pavilion scattered in the top ten cities around the world. Some of the smaller cities also had their own pavilion for information, but it did not offer services by requests. After arriving at the Mysterious Min City, Ye Chen had spent a huge amount of top rank soul stones in requesting the pavilion to find information on the last three ingredients. They promised to have the results in one month. Right now, it had been half a month.</p><p>The night arrived, and the whole city sank into the darkness.</p><p>“Formation!”</p><p>In the heavy cold wind, groups of men in black suddenly appeared in the estate that Ye Chen lived in from different directions. There were all forty-nine of them. They did not enter the estate right away; instead, they just guarded outside. Every single one of them started to form some kind of a spell, and even their forming speed was exactly the same. It would not be hard to tell that it had been done thousands of times by these guys to reach this kind of a synchronization.</p><p>As they prepared their formation, circles of black shadows spread out with them being the center. The black shadows were slightly different from the dark night, extremely black in color. No light could be reflected from them at all. With forty-nine of them there, there were forty-nine black shadows fusing together, eventually forming a massive black shadow light cover that hovered over the whole estate. Looking from the outside, this estate seemed to disappear completely.</p><p>Inside the estate…</p><p>“Ambush! There is an ambush!”</p><p>Ye Chen walked out of the room and stepped onto the snow ground. Murong Qingcheng walked out as well.</p><p>The two looked up where the sky was pitch black, with no light at all. Looking outside the estate, all of the buildings outside were no longer visible, with only darkness covering everything.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>Ye Chen pointed out his finger at that endless darkness, and a ray of sword qi shot out. Without a sound, that sword qi just disappeared into the darkness.</p><p>“Such a powerful formation! A ward has been formed somehow.” Ye Chen’s face froze a bit as he said.</p><p>“A ward?”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng had heard about it before, but she did not know more than the name itself.</p><p>“Ward is a blockage which separates us from the world outside. Inside this ward, no matter what happens, no one will be able to know unless they break it somehow. Of course, this is just the ward’s most basic feature.”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng said, “This kind of well-thought plan should probably come from a powerful dark party, but I wonder which one it is.”</p><p>“This ward contains shadow profound, so if I guess they should be the killers from the Ghost Shadow Pavilion, the No.1 killer groups. The leader of the pavilion, Sha Zu, is actually the No.1 killer among them all. There are also other top four killer kings as well. However, the Sha Zu and the killer kings have nothing to do with us since it would still not require Life and Death Realm warriors to kill us yet. Otherwise, the world would have gone crazy by now.”</p><p>Facing this kind of danger he had never faced before, Ye Chen was not panicking at all, because he knew it would be just offering chances for the killers if he did, which would not help the situation at all.</p><p>Outside the black shadow, a group of men in black who had appeared close to the town walked out.</p><p>“Being able to push us to use the Seven Extreme Ghost Shadow Spell, this Ye Chen should be proud of himself even after he dies. In the past ten years, this is the third time for the Ghost Shadow Pavilion to use it.”</p><p>The leading man in black said, “If it were a normal Sea of Souls Realm master level warrior, then two to three people should have been enough. But, if it were a famous master level warrior, then a strict plan should be placed in order. But according to our investigation, this Ye Chen has got extremely powerful survival skills. Therefore, we had to submit a request to use our Seven Extreme Ghost Shadow Spell. I could not believe that the authorities agreed to it, sending out forty-nine aiding killers to help us.”</p><p>There was a rule of the Ghost Shadow Pavilion that they would only get one chance at assassinating someone; if they failed, they would not attempt it again. Of course, having this rule was not because they had mercy on the people they tried to kill, more because of all of the pressure they would face from different parties, since there were more than just the Ghost Shadow Pavilion on this land. If they provoked some other parties, then they would not be able to survive themselves. Even with this rule, they faced constant troubles from people trying to take them out.</p><p>“We only have one chance. I do not wish to see any failures under my watch.”</p><p>“Second-in-command, don’t worry! With the enhancement of the Seven Extreme Ghost Shadow Spell, there will be no chance of failing. I even think that there is no need for this spell.”</p><p>“Do not be too reckless. I have an instinct that this assassination might be the hardest one ever.” The second-in-command did not reach this conclusion out of nowhere. After becoming a killer for a long time, a killer instinct would slowly develop. If he saw other assassinating targets as preys, then Ye Chen would be the hunter. No matter how powerful a prey was, they would been captured eventually while the hunters might reverse the situation and hunt them back instead.</p><p>“Alright, let’s move! Open a door.” The leading man’s eyes went narrow as he ordered one of the killers.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>His killer’s movement changed slightly, and a door appeared on the pitch black shadow light cover. It was still pitch black inside the door.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>A group of men walked in, and the door closed behind them.</p><p>Inside the estate, the black shadows were everywhere, dancing in the air. They appeared everywhere—the trees, the snowy ground, the air, inside the buildings, inside the plants, perhaps even the lake. These black shadows were extremely lethal, able to change into solid forms and attempt at stabbing the two.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>After slicing open a black shadow, Ye Chen realized that it was impossible to destroy them, since they would just repair very quickly.</p><p>“Darkness Sky!” Murong Qingcheng performed her dark profound, forming a black light halo to cover Ye Chen and herself.</p><p>Boom! Boom!</p><p>The dark profound was different, as it was able to block out the attack from the black shadows. However, it was not that much help, since even though the black shadows outside were not able to come in anymore to attack them, the dark layer was inside the ward itself. So, new black shadows would appear from the space between the two and try to stab them.</p><p>Letting go of her dark profound, she frowned, “Although these black shadows cannot do any real harm to us, it does not feel great to be trapped in here.”</p><p>Ye Chen said lightly, “We will wait. The killing attack will arrive soon.”</p><p>Although the ward was very powerful, it was just an aid. It would only be the killers who would come to assassinate them. By then, it would surely be a real epic battle.</p><p>“Hehe! Die!”</p><p>Amongst the black shadows, there were some special-looking ones mixed about. These shadows were well hidden in Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng’s plain sight, hiding behind other black shadows. Right then, a couple of black shadows shot out! After being shattered, one black shadow became solid from its shadow form, a purple dagger appearing in its hand. That oddly shiny purple tip obviously meant that it carried an extreme poison.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>The stagger stabbed right into Ye Chen’s rear heart.</p><p>“We did it!”</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>This killer did not have time to be happy before realizing that it was just a black shadow that he had stabbed. As the black shadow in front of him disappeared, a cold creepy sound appeared behind him.</p><p>“Shadow profound…I know that too.”</p><p>Crack!</p><p>This killer’s head was twisted by a hand. His expression was both shocked and full of fear as if he was still wondering who his killer was.</p><p>“Damn! This guy knows the shadow profound as well!”</p><p>The other killers inside the ward bit on their teeth. They could not help but shiver a little. A monster level warrior who knew the shadow profound would be a couple of times more powerful than the other warriors in the same realm.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>After killing one killer, Ye Chen’s body twisted, turning into a black shadow and shooting out where there were the most black shadows.</p><p>“Great chance! Right now, I will go get that woman and use her as a bait!” A joyous expression appeared on the other killer. Without a sound, he started to approach Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>At that moment, the latter’s pupils suddenly opened. There were another pair of pupils within the two eyes, vertical like a cat’s and black in color. She scanned around her and could see the incoming killer immediately.</p><p>“Flying Assassinating Cut!” Murong Qingcheng waved out her palm.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>That killer was blown away, blood spilling out of his mouth.</p><p>“Hehe, you indeed carry the perfect demi demon bloodline. You can even see through the shadow profound. Too bad that your vision is too narrow.”</p><p>Another light human shadow appeared in Murong Qingcheng’s back again, pointing out a finger at the back of her neck.</p><p>“Are you talking about yourself?” Ye Chen appeared behind him out of nowhere. The three were in one straight line.</p><p>“What! Impossible! When did he get here?” This killer’s face was full of shock.</p><p>Reaching out his right hand, Ye Chen grabbed onto the other’s skull and twisted his wrist. With that, the skull had been twisted as well, facing him.</p><p>“Be careful.”</p><p>Ye Chen knew that Murong Qingcheng was capable since she had trained demon body throughout her life and even carried the perfect demi demon bloodline. She was no longer human anymore, so she must be more powerful than most other warriors in facing this kind of assassination.</p><p>“Yes, I know!”</p><p>She was very impressed by Ye Chen’s speed; even she did not notice how he managed to get close. But, she knew that it must be some kind of secret illusional martial art.</p><p>More and more black shadows appeared within the ward. Murong Qingcheng’s demon eye could only see through one or two layers of black shadows. But, if there were more than that layered over each other, then her eyes would not be of use. After all, the shadow profound was not that weak either; it was especially used for assassination.</p><p>“Soul Destruction Wave!”</p><p>Facing all of the incoming black shadows, Murong Qingcheng reached out her palm, and a black light ball accumulated before she tightened her grip.</p><p>Whooo!</p><p>The black light ball cracked open, spreading out in front of her.</p><p>“Ahh!”</p><p>One of the killers could no longer handle the soul attack, revealing his real body. She flashed her body once before managing to cut off the killer’s head.</p><p>Over on the other side, Ye Chen killed another assassin. Combined with the other men they killed, there had been four casualties on the other side.</p><p>But, in the following battles, both Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng noticed that the assassins were getting more and more powerful. In other words, those killers in the beginning were all rather weak, and the remaining ones were elite killers who had been in countless battles.</p><p>“Huh! We have finally tested out your bottom line. Now, you two can no longer escape from my hands.”</p><p>Ye Chen knew the shadow profound while Murong Qingcheng had the demon eyes. This was the knowledge that every remaining killer already knew.</p><p>“Soul eye! Open!”</p><p>Right then, a crack opened up in between Ye Chen’s eyebrows and a silver light poured out. With that, all of the killers appeared from their hiding positions inside the estate.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
