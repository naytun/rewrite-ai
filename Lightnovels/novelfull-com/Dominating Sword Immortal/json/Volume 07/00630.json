The killing  attacks would not just be better and with more power. For example, if  extremely powerful attacks did not land on their target, then it would  not mean anything. Ye Chen’s gold pattern was definitely a killing ace  attack, its power even more intense than the Spiritual Attack’s.  However, he did not want to use his gold pattern to beat his opponent,  since he wanted to know whether it was his Spiritual Sword attack that  was faster or his opponent’s Sky Bank attack.</p><p>“Alright! Taste my Sky Bank attack!” Beiming Hui squinted his eyes as  he held his spear in his right hand and stepped on the ground, jumping  out toward Ye Chen.</p><p>Ye Chen looked indifferent as he took out his gold sword out of its  scabbard before extending his body and floating toward his opponent,  seeming like a sword himself.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>The two both had very sharp qi: one of them was unstoppable while the  other was wrapped in sword qi, looking extra powerful. When the two  were approaching each other, even the heavy wind had been cut into  pieces; people with lower cultivation would think even time had been  frozen as they looked from afar.</p><p>While flying, Beiming Hui pulled back his long spear and something  strange happened. In the back of the spear, a space pattern spread out  into a circular shape as if it were a massive bow while the long spear  was that sharp arrow knocked on it.</p><p>“Sky Bank!”</p><p>Beiming Hui groaned, stabbing out his spear attack; however, there seemed to be no way of telling where the spear was heading.</p><p>“Spiritual Sword!”</p><p>Taking out his gold sword, Ye Chen used his right hand to make a  gesture as if he was trying to open the clouds while he threw out an  extremely fast sword attack. The sword wind was vague and hard to trace,  but looked extremely gentle at the same time.</p><p>“So fast! I cannot see the route of that attack at all!”</p><p>Everyone watching the battle all could not help but scream a little inside.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>The two went past each other, and Ye Chen stood on top of a mountain with his back toward Beiming Hui.</p><p>“Who won?”</p><p>Chu Zhongtian frowned, staring at Ye Chen and Beiming Hui closely and  wanting to see something that would indicate the results. But, he could  not tell anything at all.</p><p>On the other side, Murong Qingcheng frowned. Murong Zhishui and his  wife were holding hands, both feeling the cold sweat in each other’s  hand.</p><p>Whoo!</p><p>A wave of heavy wind blew over, lifting off the dead silence.</p><p>“Such a powerful sword attack! It even made me feel a fatal level of  danger. Fortunately, it did not land on me.” A joyous expression flashed  past Beiming Hui’s face. He was extremely terrified in that moment of  exchange. Ye Chen’s sword was like a wave of gentle breeze, turning that  rich killing intent into almost nothing. It was almost impossible to  tell where it would eventually land. Being able to avoid that sword was  something he did not even expect he could do.</p><p>“No! Ye Chen’s attack did not land on him!” Murong Zhishui was surprised.</p><p>Su Ruhui held onto Murong Zhishui’s hand tightly, “Don’t start to  worry yet. Even if Ye Chen’s sword did not land on him, his spear might  not have gotten to Ye Chen either.”</p><p>Putting away his long sword, Ye Chen turned around and said, “Oh? You think it has not landed on you?”</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>Beiming Hui was about to say something when he felt the spot between  his eyebrows go cold before something dripped down his forehead. He  reached out his hand to wipe it off and realized that it was blood.</p><p>“How is this possible!”</p><p>Beiming Hui’s eyes were left wide open; he could not believe what had  just happened. If he had been hit, he should have felt it since he was  not just some other normal human. His reflexes should be even more  powerful than most other warriors in the same realm. The most shocking  thing for him was that it had landed in between his eyebrows, which was  the center of soul ocean and the most sensitive spot, but he could still  not feel it at all.</p><p>If Ye Chen wanted to kill him, this sword would have gone through him.</p><p>“The power gap is massive. Although that sword might not be able to  go through my defense, if it were aiming for my eyes, then I would  definitely be blind by now.” Chu Zhongtian gasped. He was not afraid of  fast speed attacks, but he knew he would not be able to handle powerful  ones, since his defense might be compromised. However, Ye Chen had  broken that rule of his; even if that attack could not break through his  defense, it still could stab through his eyes or throat when he was  least expecting it.</p><p>“It seems like that mark on my chest cannot be returned for another while.”</p><p>It was Ye Chen who had left that crossed sword mark on Chu  Zhongtian’s chest. But, because of his special evil spirit body type, it  would not disappear at all. Although Chu Zhongtian was not that mad at  Ye Chen, and neither did he want to kill the latter, as one of the  martial geniuses, he would not let it go that easily. Even if there  would be no chance of him ever winning in his lifetime, he would not  give up at all.</p><p>“Brother Beiming has lost! Indeed, Ye Chen is extremely  horrifying…perhaps even more than Du Gujue!” A young warrior who came  with Beiming Hui shook his head.</p><p>“Ah! Being able to be ranked forty-eighth isn’t possible while being  weak. This time, warrior Beiming has indeed made a bad mistake.”</p><p>Whoo!</p><p>Murong Qingchengg let out a breath, suddenly remembering that area of rich grassland. She wondered if it was Ye Chen’s doing.</p><p>“Without any shape or traces, that sword attack seems like it never happened.”</p><p>Beiming Hui turned around and said without an expression, “I did not  expect to see my Sky Bank being beaten so soon. Ah well, you made me see  the biggest flaw in my attack this time. I hope you will not lose to  anyone else before I challenge you again next time.”</p><p>Beiming Hui was very stubborn; although it made him feel ashamed to  lose to Ye Chen, he believed that he would be able to beat the latter  and return the embarrassment as long as he tried hard enough. He  believed that this failure would only be just another one of the  failures in his life.</p><p>Plus, he wanted to thank Ye Chen as well; it was indeed his Spiritual  Sword which allowed him to see the hidden weaknesses of his Sky Bank  attack. As long as he improved this part, he believed that it would not  be him who would lose next time.</p><p>“Confidence is a good thing, but I don’t always have time for this.  If you want to challenge me in the future, it would depend on whether  you have the power for it.”</p><p>Standing on the mountain, the wind was gently blowing Ye Chen’s clothes as he spoke slowly.</p><p>“You do not have to worry about me. I, Beiming Hui, always grow  stronger when I meet powerful opponents. What I am afraid is that when  the day comes, I might not be interested in fighting against you  anymore.”</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>After saying that, Beiming Hui lifted up his long spear and flew  toward the way he came from. The other young warriors froze for a second  before following behind him.</p><p>“So arrogant even after he lost….”</p><p>“If it were not for Ye Chen being nice, that sword attack would have killed him immediately.”</p><p>People from the Murong family said a bit angrily.</p><p>Ye Chen chuckled; he did not care for it, since there were just so  many martial geinuses who had challenged him. He could not even remember  some of them by now.</p><p>The battle between Beiming Hui and Ye Chen had officially finished, so Chu Zhongtian turned around, wanting to leave.</p><p>“Chu Zhongtian, since you are already here, why not come down and  catch up with me?” Ye Chen still thought quite highly of Chu Zhongtian,  thinking that he was rather talented and full of potential.</p><p>The latter shook his head and said, “No, thanks! I will challenge you when I see you the next time. We can catch up then!”</p><p>As he spoke, Chu Zhongtian activated his evil yuan, turning into a beam of dark red light and disappearing in the horizon.</p><p>Flying down the mountain, Ye Chen landed onto the Murong family plaza.</p><p>“Ye Chen, are you okay?”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng walked over; the second Ye Chen and Beiming Hui  exchanged attacks, she opened her demon eye, but it was still only  vaguely able to capture a blurry spear shadow. It was not hard to tell  how fast Beiming Hui’s attacking speed was.</p><p>Ye Chen held onto Murong Qingcheng’s hand, “That spear is indeed very fast, but just like he said, it has a major weakness.”</p><p>Sky Bank attack was indeed one of the fastest attacks, but it was  indeed because it was going so fast that it was moving in a straight  line. But because it was a straight line, the attack was quite  predictable, which was why Ye Chen was able to tell exactly where it  would land and manage to avoid instantly. Otherwise, he could only use  his Spiritual Sword attack to cancel out the incoming attack and not be  able to leave that tiny sword mark on his opponent’s forehead.</p><p>“Weakness?”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng was lost in her thoughts; she also thought that  Beiming Hui’s Sky Bank attack was too simple. However, it was just for  Ye Chen. If it were someone else, no one would be able to react in time.  Therefore, it would only be regarded as weakness by Ye Chen and  probably no one else.</p><p>“Haha! Good boy! I cannot believe that you moved onto the next level  already!” Murong Zhishui was feeling really happy. Next to him, Su Ruhui  frowned as she said, “I have never seen another young man being this  arrogant. He was not humble at all! At least someone who lost would have  some decent manners, you would think. So reckless!”</p><p>Beiming Hui’s last sentence was upsetting Su Ruhui.</p><p>Ye Chen laughed. “Ma’am, don’t worry! I have battled him once, and I  will beat him again. There will be a day when he completely gives up on  winning against me.”</p><p>When he said that sentence, Ye Chen was laughing. But somehow, it  gave people the feeling that it was actually something that would happen  in the future for sure.</p><p>“You little brat, you are quite arrogant, huh! Haha!” Su Ruhui heard  him and started chuckling. She was very happy to have such a future  son-in-law, and felt she could trust him with her daughter.</p><p>“He is always this arrogant.”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng made a rare joke. She knew Ye Chen very deeply, and  knew that he was someone who seemed always calm on the surface while  having a heart like a volcano. He just never revealed it to the others,  or simply did not want other people to see this side of him.</p><p>“Hehe! You do know me after all.”</p><p>Ye Chen thought of Xu Jing out of nowhere suddenly; she also knew him  well. Indeed, he was not blindly proud, but had dignity that pushed him  this far, and would push him even further ahead.</p><p>“Alright, everyone can go back to where they were now.” Murong  Zhishui waved for people to leave before turning to say to Ye Chen,  “Although you are very powerful, Ye Chen, you still have your weaknesses  as well, such as your defense, which is something that sword artists  cannot hide.”</p><p>“Yeah!”</p><p>Ye Chen nodded. The biggest weaknesses for a sword artist was  defense. Their sword intent would be able to increase the battling power  drastically, but it would be impossible to improve defense. On the  other hand, a martial intent would manage to do it. Everything had its  own ups and downs, so it would be inevitable. Although he now had the  protection of the dragon bones, it would still not be perfect. If he  were battling a powerful warrior, then even the dragon bone layer might  not keep him safe.</p><p>Murong Zhishui continued to say, “You know about the Treasury Holy  Tower, right? I have been there once back in the days. However, I had a  bad luck, so I could only manage to get one top rank weapon. But with  your power, you might be able to last until the fourth level, which  would allow you to get a semi extreme rank great weapon.”</p><p>“Will it be too dangerous?” Su Ruhui asked worriedly.</p><p>Murong Zhishui said, “For normal master level warriors, there must be  some level of danger, but for top master level warriors, it would be  almost nothing. However, although it is not that dangerous, you would  still need a bit of luck. Without it, you would probably have to leave  with nothing. Plus, pay attention to the others…When one does not have  much power, then they might resort to trickery.”</p><p>“Of course, I am not reminding you to go there out of nowhere. It’s  just that it is open now twenty-four seven. But, the fact is that the  first floor would be open now, then the second one would open next year,  and so on. This time is indeed the fourth year before a new round.  Without any surprises, every talented warrior would be there. If you do  not go there, you would surely be taking a loss.”</p><p>“Of course, I will go!”</p><p>Ye Chen was already planning to go there. If he could get his hand  onto a semi extreme rank defense weapon, it would be very useful for  him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
