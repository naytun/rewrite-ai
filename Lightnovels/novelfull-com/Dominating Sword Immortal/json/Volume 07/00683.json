He did not believe that more than 1,300 people would not be able to deal with 300 people. He thought that only one round of attack would strike out most of them, and two rounds of attacks could absolutely take out all of them.</p><p>This operation was the largest operation of all time, made up of a total of 2,700 people. They had only one mission, which was to kill all of the warriors from the Azure Dragon Palace.</p><p>Therefore, this operation was almost perfect, and there should be no accidents.</p><p>\"You are about to die, so no point to hide anything from you! \" The Whirlwind Gate leader slowly approached with his people, giving the other side an extra pressure.</p><p>\"At least let me die without regret.\" Xu Danian's eyes glanced around. There were four groups of enemies, nearly a thousand of them in total. Meanwhile, there were only 400 of them, 50 at the Sea of Souls Realm and 300 at Astral Reaching Realm.</p><p>Four hundred to one thousand, even with full defense, they probably could last for another twenty or thirty rounds of attacks at most. Since all of the attacks were scattered, they would not be concentrated into one, and neither would they be perfectly integrated together. However, the full defensive formation of the Zhen yuan layer would be a perfect fusion, since everyone had the same Zhen yuan. Even if the elements were different, they could still coordinate with each other perfectly.</p><p>\"I know that you want to know, but I will not tell you. Letting the enemy die in frustration makes me happy.\" The leader of the Whirlwind Gate waved his hand and gestured the people behind him to stop. Ten miles was enough of distance for them. If it were too close, they would easily be impacted by the enemies' last fightback.</p><p>\"I know that there must be an inside man working for you in the palace.</p><p>Being ambushed once might just be a coincidence, but being ambushed twice…? Even fools would know that there was someone on the inside working for the opposite side. But, Xu Danian could not think who the stitch could be no matter how hard he tried. The leader of the top five palaces, Wei Longtao, would be rather unlikely. His status was very noble, and the possibility of him betraying would be very slight. This was true for the second in command, Wu Chuan, as well. They had been good friends for decades now, and he knew the other so well that nothing like that would get through him.</p><p>Excluding the two of them, then there would be only Ye Chen and himself left.</p><p>Of course, it would be impossible to himself, as he could not deceive himself after all. And it should not be possible for Ye Chen either. As a rare genius of the millennium, the possibility of him betraying would be so small that it would be negligible. Geniuses might be arrogant, reckless, or ruthless, but they would not betray. After all, betrayal was frowned upon, and he could not think of any benefit for Ye Chen in doing so.</p><p>As all four were ruled out, Xu Danian knew that he was going nowhere with it.</p><p>\"Hey, you can continue to try guessing.\" Anyways, the head of the Whirlwind Gate team could not be ignored. It was right then when black dots appeared in the distant sky. Soon there were more and more of them as they started to pile up, connecting together.</p><p>\"Deputy leader?\" The warriors standing behind Xu Danian were full of hope. They did not want to die, so when they saw the black dots, a glimmer of hope rose inside their minds.</p><p>\"Look again!\" Xu's voice trembled a little. He turned out to see another area of black dots appearing within a dozen miles to the previous area. The two seemed to be regrouping as they were flying over toward them.</p><p>Xu Danian's expression changed suddenly. He knew Ye Chen had only a little more than three hundred men with him, and the number of these black spots, must have been more than four hundred. So, this could not be Ye Chen. But, it was more reasonable after all. Even if Ye Chen led the people out successfully, they would inevitably lose a lot of men. It would be a miracle if they managed to still have half of the people, and it would still be incredibly lucky if one-third made it out. But, there would only be dozens of them left in all likelihood.</p><p>\"Let's go all-in with these guys!\" The last glimmer of hope was shattered, so all of the powerful warriors from the palace had dead gray expressions on their faces. They had been given hope before it was taken away from them brutally, which was the cruelest thing that could have happened. At this point, they had no intention of escaping anymore. Under the siege of more than a thousand people, the possibility of escape was almost zero.</p><p>\"Defense in full force!\"</p><p>Xu Danian also fell into despair. When nearly a thousand people had surrounded them, they could still manage to block out twenty or thirty rounds of attacks. But now, it would be great if they could block out even ten. The sudden addition of 400 enemies was like that last straw that crushed the camel, pushing them to the bottom of their hope.</p><p>\"Haha, you're done here.\"</p><p>The leaders of the opposing parties had the expressions as if they were looking at dead people. They did not care about the fact that Xu Danian was still trying to delay. Even though they thought that the outcome of the whole battle had been set in stone, they were only waiting for the last two groups of people, since the number of warriors they had on their side was also quite significant. With 400 people against nearly a thousand people, they would still be looking at losing a couple dozens of his men, which was not something they wanted to see.</p><p>And now, with all the others being gathered, the outcome had really been set.</p><p>\"Attack!\"</p><p>Without any hesitation, the Black King Martial School team leader and the Whirlwind Gate team leader both waved their hands. With that, dense attacks appeared like raindrops in the sky, falling on the thick Zhen yuan layer made by Xu Danian and his people. A popping sound was heard instantly, so loud that one's eardrums might get cracked without protection.</p><p>…</p><p>Thousands of miles away, Ye Chen led the people toward them.</p><p>\"We have got an ambush here, so Xu Danian must have one over there as well. I do not know if they can hold on until our arrival.\" Xing Meilian was secretly worried.</p><p>\"Next might be a bloody battle. Everyone, follow my lead and don't get too far from the team, Chen Sister, it will be better for you to not go farther than ten steps away from me. This time, the battle will be very dangerous.\"</p><p>Ye Chen did not think that deputy Xu could kill a lot of the enemies, and perhaps he could not even kill one of them. In other words, they would have to face one thousand warriors at the same time. Facing them head-on, they would not be able to do much at all. Only with the battle chariot could they manage to get into the group, which could limit the enemies' movement. Even so, it would still be very dangerous. It was doomed to be a bloody battle, and the winning key was not in Ye Chen's hands: it would be in the hands of deputy Xu. If he could save a certain number of people, Ye Chen would have the confidence to beat his enemies.</p><p>\"Yes, Ye brother.\"</p><p>Chen Yuxin nodded obediently. Before this, she had never been in a real battle before, and seeing all the enemies dying in front of her had shocked her. Right then, she knew how fragile she was with her limited power, and how easily she could be killed in these kinds of battles.</p><p>\"I don't need your protection.\"</p><p>Lin Canghai secretly tightened his fists; he had obviously lost to Ye Chen a little during the battles before. But, it was a chaotic battle, so it would be hard to know who had killed how many people. In the following battles, he would try his best to use all that he had learned.</p><p>\"I don't think you will need my protection after all.\" Ye Chen was calm in his voice.</p><p>…</p><p>A couple thousand miles only took a few breaths worth of time to cross. But for the Astral Reaching Realm warriors, it was rather far away.</p><p>After a pot of tea worth of time, everyone finally saw Deputy Xu and his people.</p><p>It was a very brutal sconce, with less than three hundred people left. Each breath of time would have dozens more being killed by the enemies. At the same time, the enemies were visibly more in number, at least one thousand three hundred people in total. Their attacks were like falling stars as they landed onto Deputy Xu and the rest of them.</p><p>\"Everyone, follow behind me! Let's do this!\"</p><p>Holding his sword high up in the air, Ye Chen stood right in front of the Golden Dragon Battle Chariot, his black hair dancing in the air.</p><p>\"Kill!\" The others yelled as well, the atmosphere boiling with passion.</p><p>\"What?\" The warriors from the opposing parties looked around in shock, looking at Ye Chen and that three hundred warriors on that battle chariot.</p><p>\"How is this possible? How did they make it here?\" The leaders of the power parties were having trouble accepting the truth in front of them.</p><p>\"It is impossible for them to break through the ambush. They must have gotten around somehow.\" The leader of the Whirlwind Gate said affirmatively.</p><p>\"Regardless, they are already here!\"</p><p>\"So what? We have one thousand and three hundred warriors on our side. Even if half of them go out, we still have six hundred of us. We are more than equipped to kill them.\" That leader licked his lips and said, waving his hand, \"Everyone from my school, listen up! Kill all of them! Leave not a single one behind!\"</p><p>\"Kill!\"</p><p>Not a single warrior from the Whirlwind Gate was panicking, as they had way more warriors on their side. If they could not beat the enemies like this, then they might as well kill themselves.</p><p>Just like this, the warriors of the Whirlwind Gate had gone out to attack Ye Chen and his warriors while the warriors from the Black King Martial School continued to corner Xu Danian and the other warriors from the palace.</p><p>\"Deputy Ye is here! Everyone, hold on!\"</p><p>Xu Danian did not know what he was feeling right now anymore. He was both excited, shocked, happy, and impressed. All of the expressions he might have in a year were displayed right now.</p><p>\"Haha! There is hope for us! Brothers, just hang on for a little bit longer!\"</p><p>Compared to Xu Danian, the others started to even cry. They had started to feel that little bit of hope when it was shattered. So, they sank into a deeper desperation. But now, Ye Chen had brought them a little bit of hope again, which was so much better than that desperation before. Ye Chen's image had been carved into their tense hearts. Years later, they might forget a lot of things, and might even forget what happened today, but would never forget him, because he had already become a part of their beliefs.</p><p>If the potential one might have during the most desperate moment was drastic, then the power everyone was showing right now after that desperation before was just tremendous. All of them could no longer care for the wounds they had received before as they continued to explode with more power to beat the enemies. Right now, there was only one thought on their minds: to live.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The four massive wheels of the chariot rolled rapidly, leaving an obvious mark in the air. Almost three hundred warriors followed behind the battle chariot, attacking toward the incoming enemies. They had nothing to fear because Ye Chen had brought them too much shock, to the extent that as long as he was there, they believed that the victory would be on their side. As long as they had Ye Chen, they would not lose at all.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Their attacks clashed together even before they clashed personally; Ye Chen's group was at a disadvantage, where they lost ten warriors already. On the enemy side, they had lost no warriors yet.</p><p>\"Haha! Kill all of them!\"</p><p>All of the enemy warriors got too arrogant; killing a dozen warriors so early on in the battle had brought them high spirits.</p><p>Ye Chen looked the same, but his eyes shone with a cold light. He put back his thunder devour sword and lifted both of his hands, expanding his five fingers.</p><p>Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!</p><p>Beams of ray-like green lotus sword qi were shot out; each finger of his was like a top master level warrior. As a result, ten fingers were equivalent to ten people. With all ten of them, the damage they did was equivalent to that caused by dozens of normal Sea of Souls Realm warriors.</p><p>Within a second, Ye Chen's side managed to oppress the opponent side while that battle chariot attacked forward without stopping.</p><p>Ten miles!</p><p>Five miles!</p><p>Three miles!</p><p>\"Stop them!\" The leader of the Whirlwind Gate team was shocked as he hurried to yell out.</p><p>\"Increase the speed!\" Ye Chen fought over the control of the battle chariot, pushing his spirit power and Zhen yuan at the same time. With that, the speed of the battle chariot doubled, rushing right into the enemies' side while tearing up a blood tunnel.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
