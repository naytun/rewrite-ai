When patriarch was around, although the four forces didn’t dare to press forward, they still used to have an edge as far as the overall situation of Blood Battle Ocean goes. After the patriarch went into seclusion, my Dragon God Celestial Palace rarely had a major victory. Occasionally turning the tables was almost inconsequential as well.”</p><p>“That’s right! In this half a month, we’ve taken care of more than two thousand people. This is an absolute victory!”</p><p>Previously, Ye Chen’s fame was only limited to the Azure Dragon Hall. The other three halls didn’t have much of an understanding of him, and thought of his achievements as a blind cat coming across a dead mouse. However, at this moment, the three hall leaders admired him to the point of reverence. In their eyes, even though Ye Chen was not the Azure Dragon Hall Leader, he was far superior to the latter.</p><p>“Ye Chen, with you here, we’ll have control over the situation of the Blood Battle Ocean.” Mo Feng couldn’t stop sighing. Who would have thought that Ye Chen alone would turn the Blood Battle Ocean’s situation upside down? If not for seeing with his own eyes, he would certainly have a hard time believing it.</p><p>“I just have some special abilities, that’s all.”</p><p>Ordinary Sea of Soul experts’ soul power could only cover the surroundings of a hundred li, whereas Ye Chen’s soul power could cover five hundred li. This was a huge advantage that couldn’t be ignored. If not for his soul power, he wouldn’t have grasped the enemy’s plans with such precision and toyed with them as if they were on his palms.</p><p>“Special abilities are also a part of your strength. Compared to us, you’re far superior in commanding the battlefield.”</p><p>Ye Chen only replied with a calm smile.</p><p>…</p><p>Black King Gate and Water Wave Sect experts were relatively lucky, as they met each other along the way and joined forces. Thus, three thousand people flew across majestically.</p><p>However, greeting them were five thousand people, a difference of a whole two thousand.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>Seeing the sight, Black King Gate Hall Leader’s complexion changed several shades before he shouted grimly.</p><p>“Chase!”</p><p>Ye Chen waved his hand, and the other three groups merged as they chased forth.</p><p>The reason they didn’t go for the encirclement was because they didn’t have enough people. Usually, only when one side had thrice the number of people compared to the enemy would the encirclement have any meaning. Otherwise, it would merely provide the enemy an opportunity to break every group one by one. After all, this was not an ordinary formation, but a troop made of Astral Reaching level experts and above. One couldn’t view them with common reasoning.</p><p>Just like that, two sides moved crazily one after the other.</p><p>In terms of strength, Dragon God Celestial Palace was undoubtedly superior to the four forces, and their overall speed was also higher. In about two hours, the distance between the two sides had shrunk to about thirty li—the most optimal distance to launch an assault.</p><p>Ye Chen didn’t have to command, as everybody used their best moves one after another.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>Black King Gate and Water Wave Sect’s experts had no other choice but to combinedly raise a defensive barrier, which further slowed down their speed and rendered them even more incapable of breaking away from the pursuit.</p><p>The attacks of five thousand people shook the defensive barrier violently. Every once in a while, someone spurted out a mouthful of blood, suffering a backlash.</p><p>“Old Zhao, what now?” The Black King Gate Palace Leader looked toward the green-robed old man of Water Wave Sect.</p><p>The green-robed old man’s face was extremely unsightly. He said word by word, “If this goes on, the injuries on our side will keep piling up, and after a limit, we won’t even have the qualifications to fight against them. As of now, our best option is to counterattack and fight to the death.”</p><p>“Fight to the death?”</p><p>“We must. We also have the numbers—three thousand and two hundred is not a small number, and the enemy only has five thousand. It’s not like we don’t have the power to fight back.”</p><p>“Alright then, fight!”</p><p>The Black-robed man was not an indecisive person either. Under desperation, a cruel glint flickered in his eyes as if he wished to devour the enemy, seeming like a vicious beast.</p><p>“Fight with everything!”</p><p>Eventually, Black King Gate and Water Wave Sect’s experts stopped fleeing and turned around, intending to engage in a deathmatch with Ye Chen and the rest.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>There was no need for an exchange of words between the two sides; they would kill as soon as they saw each other. Thousands of attack waves collided, turning the area between the two sides into a death zone that seemed like a starry river. Anybody who dared to enter this region would instantly turn into ashes, and not even their bones would survive.</p><p>At this point, individual battle strength was no longer significant. Even Ye Chen was not able to contend against thousands. Once he was separated, he would be instantly blasted apart. Of course, if he wished to escape, they wouldn’t be able to stop him even if there were more people. With the Defensive Sword Art, Ye Chen’s speed was no longer any less than the speed of a Sea of Soul realm’s ordinary attack. He could easily leave these attacks behind him if he were to escape.</p><p>Peng Peng Peng Peng!</p><p>The battle between several thousand people was too magnificent and frightening. Both sides had forgotten about everything other than issuing their best moves, no longer caring about anything else.</p><p>The battle continued for about an hour before a clear decline in experts of Black King Gate and Water Wave Sect could be seen. The reason they could hold out until now was completely because the attacks of Ye Chen and the rest were too crowded, creating a lot of waste. After all, Zhen Yuan could be combined together for a while, but combining killing moves was exceedingly difficult. They canceled out each other as soon as they made contact and turned into pure Zhen Yuan streams, decreasing their strength by a lot.</p><p>However, this advantage was an advantage nonetheless. As the time passed by, Ye Chen’s side was able to preserve their peak condition at all times. On the other hand, due to going all out since the beginning, the enemies were showing signs of collapse. It was especially true for the Astral Reaching experts—since they had swallowed huge amounts of pills, their Zhen Yuan purity was constantly declining, rendering their offense more and more ineffective. In contrast, Astral Reaching experts at Ye Chen’s side had only consumed half the amount of pills compared to the enemy. After all, they had the numerical advantage, and had no need to exert themselves to such an extent. As long as they slowly whittled down the enemy, it would be a success.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>Another fifteen minutes passed, and the experts of Black King Gate and Water Wave Sect were finally unable to endure as they exposed a hole in their formation’s left. Hundreds of people were assimilated into Zhen Yuan streams as ashes, leaving behind sparkling rings that fell into the ocean.</p><p>“Hold on! Kill one, you’re even…kill two, make a killing!” The green robed old man attacked while shouting to increase the morale.</p><p>“Hall Leader is correct. We’re dead anyway! Let’s see if we can drag one more with us.”</p><p>Desperate situations could undoubtedly make people frantic and even hysterical. This kind of hysteria amongst an ordinary formation would only spell trouble, but in sect wars, it could become a source of horrifying might. The lowest cultivation base among these people was early Astral Reaching realm. Their potential was too high compared to ordinary people. Under desperation, they could even burn their vitality.</p><p>Huff!</p><p>Under such an intense fire, Ye Chen’s side also lost dozens of people. Of course, they were already prepared beforehand. In a battle involving thousands of people, wishing to win without losing a single person would be simply impossible. If it were a battle on the scale of ten thousands, Ye Chen would have been able to secure the victory at most. It would have been absolutely impossible to secure the enemy’s complete destruction.</p><p>This was precisely the randomness numbers brought.</p><p>Unfortunately, even potential had a limit, and they couldn’t continue doing so. Moreover, Ye Chen’s side also didn’t dare to be neglectful in the slightest. Each and every one’s nerves were stretched to the limits, and their attacks were one step ahead of their peak. Soon, they once again suppressed their opponents, and the kill count reached seven hundred.</p><p>The higher the kill count got, the faster it increased. Like a snowball, the more it rolled, the bigger it became. The two enemy groups were only one step away from complete defeat.</p><p>“We can’t hold on! Look for an opportunity to escape!” The green-robed old man knew that it was a lost battle, and thus, he sent a Zhen Yuan transmission to the black-robed hall leader.</p><p>“I know.” The black robed man gnashed his teeth.</p><p>When the casualties of Black King Gate and Water Wave Sect reached more than two thousand, dozens of figures suddenly left the formation and streaked toward the rear. They were headed by the green-robed old man and black-robed man.</p><p>“Keep on attacking…I’ll chase.”</p><p>Ye Chen soared above and five sword beams appeared outside his body. With a rustle, he turned into an azure beam of sword light, flickering across the air.</p><p>“Haha, how can you do that without me!” The Red Hall Leader led a couple dozen people and chased.</p><p>Subsequently, the Black Dragon Hall Leader and White Dragon Hall Leader also soared up with their respective groups. Their presence had no effect on the current situation. If four thousand people couldn’t take care of one thousand people, they might as well go kill themselves.</p><p>Actually, the situation was even better than they thought. When the experts of Black King Gate and Water Wave Sect saw that even their hall leaders had fled, how could they have the heart to continue fighting? Like a poked hornet’s nest, they scattered in every direction, looking for an opportunity to escape under the chaos. However, their actions only made their deaths quicker. Just a casual wave of attacks resulted in their complete annihilation, leaving not even their bones behind.</p><p>“Brother Sun, we’ll go on our separate ways.” Green robed old man and black-robed man separated into two groups, each fleeing separately. Chasing after them, Ye Chen gave up on the black-robed man and chased after the green-robed old man alone.</p><p>Fearing that Ye Chen might have an accident, White Dragon Hall Leader Mo Feng chased after the green-robed old man as well. Meanwhile, the other two hall leaders went after the black-robed man.</p><p>Although Sword Light Flight was not as fast as Defensive Sword Flight, it had once been Ye Chen’s trump card. With a flicker, he covered several li, and the distance between him and the old man had already been reduced to fifty li in a few moments.</p><p>“Kid, you’re courting death!”</p><p>A green glow appeared in the eyes of the green-robed old man as he suddenly turned around and led the twenty men to kill Ye Chen. He didn’t believe that Ye Chen alone could fight against the twenty of them. It should be known that he himself was an extremely powerful expert—a figure with the same strength as the Dragon God Celestial Hall Leaders.</p><p>He might not be afraid of Ye Chen even one on one.</p><p>The more than twenty people charged with surging auras like tigers. The distance between the two sides unceasingly shortened to fifty li….forty li…thirty five li…</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>At that moment, Mo Feng’s face changed and he hurriedly commanded the people behind him, “Hurry up! We have to support Deputy Ye!”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Each and every single person Mo Feng brought had a cultivation of late Sea of Soul realm and was a veteran; they could even act as leaders themselves. Seeing Ye Chen in danger, their speed secretly increased, surpassing their own limits.</p><p>Confronting more than twenty people head on, Ye Chen was calm and showed no fear. Holding the Thunder Disaster Sword in his right hand, he raised it high in the air. At the sword’s tip, a dark golden colored sword light appeared silently.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>When the distance closed to merely thirty li, the green-robed old man and the twenty individuals behind him simultaneously aroused their Zhen Yuan and were about to launch their top moves. Unfortunately, Ye Chen was even quicker than them, starting later but finishing first.</p><p>“Golden Pattern!”</p><p>The Thunder Disaster Sword slashed down, and a dark golden ripple radiated out. Wherever it passed, the sky turned dark, only leaving behind some dark golden traces streaking across.</p><p>Puchi Puchi Puchi!</p><p>Without any suspense, the twenty individuals and the green-robed old man all turned into dust. The upper grade artifacts and storage rings flew about chaotically, flickering with bright lights.</p><p>At this point, the operation was nearing completion. Under Ye Chen’s lead, the four enemy forces suffered frightening losses, and his battle accomplishments had also reached a frightening level, perhaps unprecedented in the history of the Dragon God Celestial Palace.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
