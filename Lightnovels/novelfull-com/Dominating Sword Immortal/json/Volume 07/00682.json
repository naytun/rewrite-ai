From farther away, the attack force would get weakened too much, and the opponent might get the upper hand from a nearer distance. Standing in front of the Golden Dragon Battle Chariot, Ye Chen raised his Thunder Disaster sword before waving it down.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>The sky was torn open as the black thunder ball looked the same while shooting out in a straight line. Meanwhile, the others followed suit immediately.</p><p>The sky was in a chaotic state in a flash as more than forty Seas of Souls Realm warriors and three hundred Astral Reaching Realm warriors attacked together, forming a terrifying scene. Even half-step king warriors would retreat in the face of such an onslaught rather than facing it head-on. Anyone below that level would be killed with the lightest touch.</p><p>“Kill them.”</p><p>The head of the Water wave School waved his hand as he yelled.</p><p>In fact, they had already been ready when the Ye Chen and others were thirty miles away even without the command of the Water wave School leader, each one of them throwing out the most violent attack. It would be a very tragic result if they went for a head-on attack without that. Personal strength was infinitely reduced in such situations, and only by being united could they perhaps compete with the others.</p><p>Bang, bang!</p><p>On one side were more than three hundred attacks, and on the other were nearly four hundred attacks. They were closely connected together, due to which explosions that were enough to make people’s hearts shatter continued to be heard. Chaotic and violent shockwaves kept spreading out, turning the central belt into a death zone.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>Attacks on both sides were not all colliding together, as there was always some fishes escaping the net. About thirty attacks went through the chaos in the air and bombarded the protective shield of the Gold Dragon Battle Chariot, stirring waves of ripples as the whole vehicle continued to shake.</p><p>But in the end, the protective shield of the chariot was not shattered at all.</p><p>The defense of the Golden Dragon Battle Chariot was stronger than a single semi extreme level defense armor. Although there were a lot of attacks, most of them had been burnt out, and naturally could not break through the shield.</p><p>On the other side, there were more than forty attacks that went through all the chaos and attacked the enemies at the Water wave School side, taking the lives of a dozen people within a flash.</p><p>It turned out that the thunder ball attack thrown out by the Ye Chen had destroyed a large number of attacks, while Lin Canghai could not be underestimated either. The two of them were equal to many people combined. So, even though the number of warriors from the palace was less than the enemies, the effect was way more than the Water wave School and the Sky Eagle Cult combined.</p><p>“Keep killing!” Ye Chen was no longer performing his thunder devour, but changed to only ordinary sword attacks. Although the individual attack force was not as powerful as his thunder devour attack, he could wave out dozens or hundreds of sword attacks with his sword speed. With that, the others followed his lead and started to perform their fastest attacks.</p><p>More than three hundred people had thrown out thousands of attacks within a blink of an eye, and the scene was heating up.</p><p>“Block them.”</p><p>The first round of attacks struck more than a dozen people, causing the head of the Water wave School to be a little shocked. Ye Chen and Lin Canghai’s battle power was beyond his imagination; these two people were absolutely at the top master level. He was afraid that only the leader himself could compete with one of them.</p><p>The second round of attack killed off a dozen more warriors from the Water wave School, and the remaining people from the Sky eagle cult had also lost seven or eight of their warriors as well.</p><p>At this moment, the Golden Dragon chariot was already less than ten miles away. The attacks thrown out from ten miles away were almost not weakened at all, bringing with them their strongest might. With the distance getting closer, death and injury were increasing drastically as well. The second round of attack had killed off three to four warriors on Ye Chen’s side. Of course, these three or four warriors were the Astral Reaching Realm warriors, and their defense was just too weak.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Finally, the defense of the battle chariot was broken and the violent blast waves landed on each warrior, constantly weakening their protective Zhen yuan layer.</p><p>Pop!</p><p>A middle-aged man on the left side of the car spewed out a mouthful of blood, seriously injured by the attacks; he was the man who controlled the Golden Dragon Battle Chariot. When the defense layer was broken, he suffered a little shockwave, so he could not stop the remaining aftershocks from the attack, which eventually shattered his protective Zhen yuan.</p><p>“Change to another person to operate the chariot. You sit down and take some rest.”</p><p>Ye Chen made a quick decision.</p><p>“Yes, sir!” A chubby man activated his Zhen yuan and poured it into the Golden Dragon Battle Chariot. Suddenly, a circle of pale golden transparent defensive halo appeared outside of the dragon chariot with that.</p><p>With this round of attacks, the number of deaths and injuries on Ye Chen’s side broke double digits, reaching fourteen people—13 dead and one seriously injured.</p><p>Fortunately, the number of dead and injured on the other side was even higher, suddenly increasing to more than thirty. The number of deaths and injuries of the Sky eagle cult had even exceeded fifty.</p><p>After several rounds of attacks, Ye Chen had only lost twenty people while the other side had lost nearly a hundred; the contrast was clearly huge.</p><p>Seeing the Golden Dragon Battle Chariot approaching them, the head of the Water wave School gritted his teeth, “Full defense! Wait for reinforcements!”</p><p>He could not have imagined that this battle of his would come with no reinforcements at all, as four other groups of warriors had already been wiped out by Ye Chen and his warriors, with not a single one of them left.</p><p>Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop!</p><p>Changing their attack mode to defense mode, Water wave School did not lose any of their warriors anymore as their thick Zhen yuan layer steadily blocked out the attacks from Ye Chen and the others. However, the world had no unbreakable defenses; it was good for a short period of time. After a long while of facing the constant onslaught, the layer started to tremble, looking like it was not going to be able to hold on.</p><p>“You have no hope… The other four groups of warriors are all dead souls. ” Ye Chen dropped the truth bomb.</p><p>“Bullsh*t! You think you could kill all four groups of warriors? Do you even know the total number of warriors? They could drown you with just one spit each. ” No one from the Water wave School’s side believed Ye Chen.</p><p>Ye Chen sneered, “Four groups of warriors in total…The largest number was 250, and the least was more than 180. Am I wrong? And, how did you think we made it here? If we entered the ambush zone, do you think it would be you losing all these men?”</p><p>“I don’t believe it!”</p><p>The head of the Water wave School’s face went pale as he had started to believe Ye Chen. But even if he did, he could not admit it. Otherwise, the consequences could not be imagined.</p><p>“Believe it or not, it is your call.” Ye Chen did not need to convince them all. As long as he could leave a seed in their hearts, they would start to gradually feel the despair.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The Golden Dragon Battle Chariot parked five miles away and continued to bombard the Zhen yuan layer, which had begun to shake up even though it seemed so unbreakable before.</p><p>Time passed by and the Zhen yuan layer started to shake more and more frequently, while the Astral Reaching Realm warriors who were pouring Zhen yuan into the layer started to bleed out and get seriously injured. The Zhen yuan layer was closely connected to them; the defense being constantly shocked would wound them constantly as well. Perhaps getting attacked once or twice would have been fine, but after hundreds of times, no Astral Reaching Realm warrior could handle it.</p><p>Gradually, more and more Astral Reaching Realm warriors got injured, and the Zhen yuan layer got weaker and weaker, leading to a vicious circle.</p><p>The leader of the Water wave School group did not expect support by now, so he started to threaten Ye Chen, “Kill us and you will not be able to get away from this. The Water wave School will give you ten times more back in return. ”</p><p>“That’s in the future. Why don’t you think about the present first?” Ye Chen increased the intensity of the attacks.</p><p>“Let’s hold on! Reinforcements are bound to come.” The leader of the Water wave School group was despairing, and he could only expect a miracle.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>Half an hour passed, and the Zhen yuan layer was weakened to a certain point where cracks started to appear. Although they were trying to fix the cracks, the speed of repair was obviously not as at par with the damage.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Suddenly, the whole Zhen yuan layer collapsed and hundreds of Astral Reaching Realm warriors puked out blood, getting blown away after being seriously injured. The majority of the remaining Astral Reaching Realm warriors also had injuries. As for the Sea of Souls Realm warriors, although they might have been able to block out most of the attacks, their blood and qi were already boiling. The situation was getting out of their control.</p><p>“Kill!” Ye Chen was drunk.</p><p>More than three hundred attacks relentlessly bombarded the enemy camp. If it were like before, the enemy side could still intercept these. But now, less than ten people still had the power to fight back, and they were all either seriously injured or almost dying.</p><p>Screams rang out and the opposite side was about to crack down. At that moment, people started to run away. Unfortunately, the escaped ones were Ye Chen’s focus. His most casual green lotus sword qi with the destruction sword intent could kill a line of people. Not to mention the Astral Reaching Realm warriors, even the Sea of Souls Realm warriors could not block it out.</p><p>With a rank 5 destruction sword intent, even his simplest attack contained an unbelievable attacking power.</p><p>…</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Thousands of miles away from the island, Deputy Xu and his people had been forced to stop because the sea in front of them was disturbed suddenly. A wall of water rose from the ground, blocking their way. It was visible to the naked eye that there were more than a dozen huge black octopuses swimming under the sea.</p><p>In front of them, there were more than three hundred people to the left and more than two hundred people on the right front. The two combined groups were about twice their size.</p><p>“Retreat!” Xu Danian knew that he had been ambushed, so he ordered his people to back out.</p><p>“Haha! You can’t escape.”</p><p>They did not manage to escape for hundreds of miles when another two groups of warriors with a number of not less than two hundred warriors approached in their way. They were people from the Black King and Whirlwind Gate .</p><p>“How dare your palace kill half a dozen master warriors half a month ago! This time, I will return the favor to you ten times over.” The leader of the one of the power party looked cold.</p><p>“Deputy Xu, let’s kill them all!”</p><p>The warriors he led started to get desperate, and were all prepared to die. Since they could not escape, they might as well try to kill as many enemies as possible.</p><p>Xu Danian was tense, “Let’s not get too worked up yet. Save your Zhen yuan and wait for the reinforcements. ”</p><p>“Don’t be delusional! The other group also has more than 1,300 people taking care of it. Without any surprise, they are probably all dead by now. Of course, if they become ghosts, they might be able to reinforce you.”</p><p>“How did you know about our plan?”</p><p>Xu Danian still had hope in his heart. For the past half a month, he did not stay idle, especially in terms of understanding Ye Chen’s background. He had realized that the latter was a must-have figure. He never thought that someone could be so talented, growing from a small genius into a generation legend, oppressing every other martial genius on this land.</p><p>So, he firmly believed that although others might die, Ye Chen would not. Perhaps he could save some of them and manage to regroup with them. Although they would still be in a disadvantageous position, it would not be without a little hope. As long as they could bring the resources back, it would be a victory. As for other things, he had already given up. The most important thing right now was to hold on while waiting for reinforcements.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
