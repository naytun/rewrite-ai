No matter who lost, it would be a big news once it got out. If one sold this information to the pavilion, one could get at least one thousand top rank spirit stones. After all, not every Sea of Souls Realm warrior could have the wealth like Ye Chen did. Normal Sea of Souls Realm warriors would only have about ten thousand top rank spirit stones. If they wanted to buy some very expensive profound martial art or top rank weapons, then that might only leave them with a couple thousand or hundreds of them left. Therefore, one thousand top rank spirit stones would not be a small number.</p><p>It was like even if one had millions of them, one would still not say no to ten thousand spirit stones.</p><p>The warrior was afraid that Xia Houzun would see him and look for trouble in the future, so he turned around to leave the mountains without even looking back once.</p><p>“I welcome you to challenge me anytime…if you have the determination.” For Ye Chen, no one in the young generation could threaten him anymore. Even if it were Bai Wuxue, who had never revealed his real power, he could not give Ye Chen the feeling of concern. If Xia Houzun wanted to keep looking for him and battling with him, he would not have a problem with that, since he was fairly certain that it would not be him who would be the one giving up eventually. There would be no one out there who would be willing to continue challenging someone one lost to every time. If Xia Houzun was really that determined, then Ye Chen might be wrong about him after all.</p><p>“Damn! I will beat you!” Xia Houzun roared, his eyes bloodshot. Right then, he looked like a completely different person than the one competing with Bai Wuxue.  ( NovelFull )</p><p>Ye Chen shook his head and turned to leave. When one had everything going the way he wanted, one would be happy and proud of oneself; when one started to fail at things, then one might be too proud to admit it. Only a very small number of people could actually realize it in time. Before, in another world, Ye Chen had seen that rich businessman jump off the building because of bankruptcy. Those people looked so superior and wealthy, which might make one jealous at times; but once the fall was overwhelming, they were even worse than normal people in a way.</p><p>Therefore, the biggest opponent was not someone else, but oneself. Even if it were Ye Chen, he would not say that he could keep it cool for sure when he lost to someone. All he could do would be to continuously improve himself and win against himself.</p><p>…</p><p>The flying puppet continued to travel as it flew past the mountain regions and arrived in the South Rudra Region.</p><p>There were four massive countries inside the South Rudra Region, and ten medium sized nations.</p><p>As he flew past the medium nations, his expression changed. He then controlled his flying puppet to fly down, fast like light.</p><p>“Martial school battles?”</p><p>As he went lower and lower, he could see that there were hundreds of people battling in the mountains below. These people were wearing four different clothing. One group had a massive scorpion sewed at the back of the cloth. There were small snakes on the sleeves of another, and a small sword present on the arm of yet another group. There was a fire pattern on the chest of the last remaining group.</p><p>If Ye Chen had guessed it right, the ones with a massive scorpion on their clothes should be warriors from the rank 8 Black Scorpion Martial School, while the ones with small snakes should be the rank 8 Green Snake Valley. The ones with small swords might be the rank 7 Fly Swords martial school. Lastly, those fire patterns might be from the Fire Cloud Martial School.</p><p>As the top four martial institutions, while the Black Scorpion Martial School and the Flying Sword were together, the Green Snake Valley and Fire Cloud Martial School were together as well. The two groups of warriors fought aggressively with each other, and people continued to die.</p><p>It was Ye Chen’s first time seeing a massive battle between martial schools, and it was rather intriguing for him.</p><p>“Hm…Spirit Fountain?”</p><p>He looked around casually, then finally realized why the four martial schools were fighting. It turned out that the yuan qi on top of the mountains was very rich. Apparently, there was a massive mineral cave somewhere in the mountain. The yuan qi outside had formed into a yuan qi tornado which was about a hundred meters long. It seemed to be controlled by some invisible power which led to yuan qi accumulated for dozens of years.</p><p>“It is one of the top low rank spirit fountains…I see.”</p><p>The spirit fountain had been separated into low, mid, top, and extreme ranks; each one of them could be split into another four sub-levels. Among the low rank spirit fountains, the bottom one would be a normal one, then there was a mid tier one, a top tier, and an extreme tier.</p><p>A normal low rank spirit fountain would be worth enough for rank 8 and 9 martial institutions to use it for ten years. Mid low rank ones could last them twenty years, and a top one would easily trigger two rank 7 martial schools to fight. As for an extreme tier one, once it appeared, then the battle happening right now would happen quite often. After all, every martial institution would want it, even if it meant that they would lose a lot.</p><p>In the past fifty years for the Sky Cloud Martial School, the best one that ever appeared was a mid low rank spirit fountain. And even the Ye family had gotten a normal low rank one before as well.</p><p>A spirit fountain was just way important to a martial institution. In other words, it would be the foundation of the school. Not everyone in the school would become Ye Chen, traveling on his own, killing opponents, and getting all of their belongings; or exploring ruins and finding treasures. Normal warriors would not be as lucky. They would most likely be killed by their opponents, or just never run into anything.</p><p>Therefore, a martial institution was not made by one person, and most of the martial institutions would need spirit fountains to develop. Only with spirit fountains and enough spirit stones would a school be able to pay its disciple. Even the Sky Cloud Martial School would give its outer masters a couple hundreds of low rank spirit stones per month, while inner masters would have thousands, along with couple dozens of mid rank spirit stones. Adding some of the management, core disciples, inner disciples, and outer disciples, the operating cost in low rank spirit stones would be at least one hundred thousand per month, and around two million per year. Ye Chen had given the school countless of them, yet it would only be able to last them a couple of years.</p><p>According to Ye Chen, a rank 7 martial institution would not be able to operate without five million low rank spirit stones and two hundred thousand mid rank ones; for top rank 7 schools, it would take at least seven or eight million. As for a rank 6 martial school, the figure would be even greater; without thirty or forty million low rank spirit stones and mid rank ones, it would be the end of them. If they could not even pay out the normal monthly spirit stones, no one would want to stay or join the martial school. It was a sign that the martial institution was powerful, since it could not be expected that everyone within the school would go out and earn some spirit stones.</p><p>A top low rank spirit fountain could even yield one million mid rank spirit stones. Therefore, the two rank 7 martial schools and the two rank 8 schools had started fighting for it.</p><p>In the mountain, that pretty light shone everywhere, and countless people were decimated with each passing moment. It was such an awful view, but spectacular at the same time.</p><p>“The battle between rank 7 and 8 martial schools is always this intense. I cannot even imagine the battle between rank 5 martial schools. It bet it would be ten times, or even a hundred times more intense.” The rank 5 martial institutions were different from the rank 7 or 8: their main power force was made up of Sea of Souls Realm warriors, hundreds or even thousands of them. With all of them fighting together, the slightest mistake would end up as a horrible tragedy.</p><p>On seeing this battle, Ye Chen could not help but start to worry about the Dragon Godly Heaven Palace. Their opponents would be the rank 4 and 5 martial institutions. Even though any one of those institutions was not as powerful as the Dragon Godly Heaven Palace, with all of them added together, their power would definitely be greater. Last time, the leader of the White Dragon Palace Mo Fengfeng and Long Biyun had already told him that the palace had already lost three hundred Astral Reaching Realm warriors, and twenty-something Sea of Soul ones. It was already shocking news for him to learn, since all of the lost men added together would be enough to destroy dozens of rank 6 martial schools.</p><p>Ye Chen decided that once the palace needed his help, he would go without hesitation. Although his power could not make any definite changes to the outcome of the battle between rank 5 martial institutions, it would be a different story for him to help or not. It would mean the world to give people the help when they needed the most.</p><p>“If it were someone else, he or she would join in to fight for that spirit fountain, I guess.”</p><p>Ye Chen did not care for that top low rank spirit fountain because he did not need low rank spirit stones or mid rank ones. But, if he had a martial institution to take care of, then it would be a completely different story. But, Ye Chen would not do such a thing, since his sword art required a man with a righteous mind. If the martial school was in need of spirit stones, then he would help to look; but, he would not steal other people’s findings.</p><p>Without a sound, Ye Chen sat on his flying puppet and left the area.</p><p>“Finally left…”</p><p>Ye Chen did not purposely try to hide his trace. All of the Astral Reaching Realm warriors down on the ground had basically seen him, and were afraid that he could come fight for the spirit foundation regardless of his title. If he really decided to do that, then there would be nothing they could do but hand it over. Luckily for them, that did not happen.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Once Ye Chen had left, these Astral Reaching Realm warriors stopped restraining themselves and started to fight with their opponents, resuming the cruel killings.</p><p>…</p><p>On leaving the White Mysterious Nation, Ye Chen had purposely gone to check on the Murong family, since Murong Qingcheng was still in closed-up training due to the injuries from last time, and it would take quite a long time for her to recover back to her peak condition.</p><p>After staying in the Murong family for a day, Ye Chen went back to the Ye family.</p><p>After his arrival, he learned that the leader of the White Dragon Palace had already left the South Rudra Region. The other party had pushed the palace in a very bad situation; qualifying a certain level, all of the members settled in different parts of the land might be called back.</p><p>Anyway, Ye Chen had told Long Biyun that he would go anytime he was needed.</p><p>On this day, Ye Chen started his Defensive Sword Spell training. The spell would require top rank great swords besides soul power, as only with top rank great swords could the warrior form a soul mark. Although the mid rank weapons could also be used, but the control power could not be as intricate as in case of the top rank one, so the power would be decreased drastically.</p><p>There were three different levels for the defense sword spell.</p><p>The first level would be the very basic defensive sword spell that allowed the warrior to control the flying sword and kill his opponent. It traveled in a straight line: the more powerful the soul power, the longer the distance.</p><p>On the second level, the sword moved with the warrior’s thought like his own arm. The whole process of killing the opponent would be completed within one thought; moreover, the flying speed would way faster than the first level.</p><p>The third level would be where the profound sense came into play, and the warrior would be able to form a Zhen yuan flying sword. After cultivating to the highest realm, the warrior would be able to kill the opponent with hundreds of Zhen Yuan swords.</p><p>Inside Ye family, right next to the lake.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>As he made a sword with his right hand, the emerald longsword came out of his scabbard on its own. It was like an emerald-colored green ray as it went through the fake mountain hundred steps away. It was even faster than the Spiritual Sword Attack.</p><p>Of course, it was not because his defensive sword spell was that powerful. What really made the defensive sword spell powerful was Ye Chen’s soul power, which was five times stronger than normal people. Controlling the sword to kill people would be easier than drinking water or eating food for him, and that was just at the first level.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
