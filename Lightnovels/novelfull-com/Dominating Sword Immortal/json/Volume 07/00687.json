But, it would also thicken the cultivator’s bones, which would eventually alter his or her appearance. So, I think I will pass on that. The Mysterious Eye can see the natural yuan qi layout in the air, as well as the Zhen yuan traveling route inside the opponents’ bodies. In the end, I might be able to see through everything, which would allow me to break through anything. But, I already have the soul eye, which would make this a waste of time. But this Cow Demon Mountain Spell indeed sounds rather nice. Should I learn it?”</p><p>Ye Chen was slightly hesitant, the Tiger Spirit Body and the Mysterious Eye would not be something he wanted to invest the time to learn. But, the Cow Demon Mountain Shattering Spell could increase his power drastically, augmenting his close-up battling techniques drastically.</p><p>“This martial art is indeed something, and a lot of body training warriors from the palace had trained it before. The body training martial arts at the same level cannot compete with this at all.” The guardian master slightly nodded and said to Ye Chen.</p><p>“Senior Tian, take me to the third floor please!”</p><p>Ye Chen planned to go check out the third floor, since there would be five Heaven Realm mid rank secret arts there. If something caught his attention, then it would be easier to make the decision.</p><p>“Alright, follow me.” Hearing that, the master turned to walk to the third level.</p><p>The third floor was really simple, and there was nothing in the middle. Instead, eight bookshelves had been set around in a circle, each having a jade bottle and a thin booklet on it.</p><p>After coming to the third floor, the master then stood aside and let Ye Chen make his own choice. Starting from the first bookshelf on the left, the latter started to pick up the booklets one after another.</p><p>The first one was a high rank two star profound martial art called the Poison Dragon Drill, which only contains one profound—the water element. But, if one wanted to cultivate it to the highest level, then he or she would have to understand the water profound to completion. Once trained, the power of the poison dragon drill would make even some of the powerful warriors fear. It was a kind of profound specially aimed at breaking through other profound martial arts.</p><p>The second one was a three stars profound art called Green Dragon Hook, which contained two different types of profound—wood and bone. With the two infused together, it could bring out a huge potential. With one grabbing gesture, it would numb the opponents’ limbs as if the opponents were captured by the huge dragon.</p><p>The third book was a four star profound called Ocean Realm, which also contained two profounds—water and wood. This was a domain type martial art, which would be able to increase the cultivator’s own power while lowering the opponents’. It was extremely powerful, since it would need the warrior to train both the profound of water and wood.</p><p>Without a doubt, the three top rank profound arts were created by the dragon king himself.</p><p>“So powerful!” Ye Chen thought to himself.</p><p>According to the description in the book, Ye Chen could already draw a picture in his head—a blurry human figure continuously performing the Poison Dragon Drill, the Green Dragon Hook, and the Ocean Realm, oppressing the enemies completely.</p><p>“Even if my Gold Pattern is trained to completion and becomes a high rank profound martial art, it would only be at one star. It is nothing to be compared with.”</p><p>“If the high rank profound martial arts are already this powerful, then I wonder how exactly powerful a top rank profound martial art would be.”</p><p>Beyond the high rank profound martial arts were the extreme rank ones, which were already close to the heaven realm rules; those were not concepts mortal humans could even imagine, and were extremely dangerous.</p><p>The Battle King had met an elder before who lifted up his finger and pointed at the sky, where a massive sun appeared out of nowhere instantly. Although it was not as big as the real one, it was looking almost identical. It was indeed something that would be almost impossible to imagine. According to the Battle King’s estimation, that sun should include different types of profound—earth, fire, and water. Obviously, the fire and water profound oppose each other, and wanting to infuse them together would be extremely different. At least, the Battle King himself could not estimate the elder’s level, and could only be respectful.</p><p>“If I try to bite off too much than I can chew, then I will not be able to do anything. I have not finished cultivating my Gold Fury yet, and if I continue to train another top rank profound, then it would be a complete waste of time. Although training is all about making the most out of limited time, it is also about spending the right effort and time on the right thing. I cannot blindly aim for more power.”</p><p>Without taking another look at the profound manuals, Ye Chen came to the fourth bookshelf.</p><p>The senior master secretly nodded. When he first came to the secret pavilion, he had been obsessed with the three top rank profound martial arts, and could not keep his eyes away from them. Contrasting to him, Ye Chen could look away so determinately, so it would not be hard to tell of the latter’s self-discipline. That alone was already quite impressive.</p><p>‘This guy is definitely going to be someone significant in the future. One day, this wind, these clouds, and this water will be moving for him. He will become a new legend.’</p><p>The senior master had been guarding this pavilion for hundreds of years, and had trained himself to be calm. He did not judge people by their appearance; instead, he saw through their minds.</p><p>“Heaven Realm mid rank secret arts, Blood Qi Rudra!”</p><p>Heaven Realm mid rank secret arts would undoubtedly be more mysterious than the low rank ones. This martial art was a blood qi training secret art. Once trained to the first level, it would increase the blood qi by a couple of times. The cultivator would turn into an invincible wall that nothing could pass. And, after cultivating to completion, a Blood Qi Rudra would be formed behind the cultivator’s body, bringing out an unbelievable power.</p><p>“Being in this secret pavilion would need a lot of self-control I see. Even with my mentality now, I still feel a bit uneasy with all of the temptation. I wonder how do those newly-arrived warriors feel when they come here for the first time.”</p><p>Everyone had the heart to want to be more powerful. Some people might lose their original ambition as time flew by, while others might become stronger and stronger as they went. The more intense the ambition, the more determined one might be. But, regardless whether there was a heart wanting to be more powerful or not, everyone who stepped inside this pavilion would be heavily affected. Each profound martial art and secret art inside this secret pavilion would be mind numbing. Even though they knew that they would not cultivate them, they might still think about it, which would cost them their normal calmness.</p><p>The first and second levels of the secret pavilion might be okay, but the third floor tempting beyond imagination. If any of the manuals in here got out, it would cause an epic battle among rank 5 martial schools. With these, the palace was indeed a top rank 5 school, being way much more powerful than the normal rank 5 ones. In conclusion, the top rank profound martial arts and the Heaven realm mid rank secret arts could make any warrior crazy.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Ye Chen put down the Blood Qi Rudra booklet and then walked toward the fifth book shelf.</p><p>“Mind Fort!”</p><p>“Mysterious Pupil!”</p><p>“Survival Art!”</p><p>The second secret art was the Mind Fort while the third and the fourth were two other different martial arts.</p><p>The Mind Fort was a special soul power cultivation secret art, after training, the trainer could help block out some will power impact or one of those illusion trap attacks. Although it could not directly increase the power, but it would make the warrior more perfect and flawless, increasing the survival chance drastically.</p><p>The Mysterious Pupil was just like the Mysterious Spirit Eye, it was a pupil spell secret art. What was different was that the Mysterious Pupil could make the opponents starting to have illusions. Once they opened their eyes, the pupil secret art attack would be thrown out, and it would be almost impossible to block out.</p><p>The Survival Art would be the most special one. It could not directly augment one’s power, neither did it come with any aiding effect. But, it would enhance one’s survival instinct drastically. One’s survival instinct should not be underestimated, since only using that strong survival instinct could one explode out that an unbelievable power when that last critical moment arrived.</p><p>The human body was a small universe, and there were still so much to know. When one figured out everything within one’s body, he or she would no longer be a human.</p><p>Unfortunately, these three secret arts were not tempting enough for Ye Chen yet. Although the Mind Fort was rather good, his talent lay in soul power, which was really strong. So, he would not be fooled by illusion or tricks that easily anyways. Since the mind of sword artists were the most aggressive ones, they would not choose to train such safe secret arts. In other words, if they relied on the Mind Fort and blocked out the enemies’ illusion attacks, then he would no long be a sword artist anymore, since his sword mind would not be strong enough.</p><p>Of course, Ye Chen would not need the Mysterious Pupil either, as winning against an opponent with tricks would not be fitting to his style of martial arts. Moreover, the Survival Art was not something Ye Chen needed either. Most importantly, he wanted to use his own power to win anything.</p><p>Four out of the five secret arts had been eliminated, leaving one last one.</p><p>“Heaven Realm mid rank secret art—the Blood Severing Ghost Finger.”</p><p>Picking up the booklet, Ye Chen opened the first page. After a long time, a surprised expression appeared on his face.</p><p>“So scary!”</p><p>There was no star ranking at the end of the manual. In other words, the Blood Severing Ghost Finger was the only five star secret art, one of the best there ever was.</p><p>Blood cutting meant cutting the blood qi, which would be one of the core aspects of human bodies. Without any blood qi would leave one without the essence of life; as a result, one would not be able to survive. Losing parts of the blood qi would affect one’s exploding power, reflexes, observation skills, and even physical strength.</p><p>Blood Severing Ghost Finger would break through one’s blood with a ghostly and scary finger attack.</p><p>So aggressive, so poisonous, so brutal!</p><p>It was a deathly finger art. Once the first level was cultivated to completion, a very horrifying power would be gained. And once it was fully cultivated, the cultivator would not need to even approach the enemies. All he would need to do was point out a finger, and the blood qi of the enemies would disappear on demand, as if they were zapped into hell.</p><p>The Blood Severing Ghost Finger would be extremely hard to train though. According to Dragon King’s description, no one had been able to train it to the highest level. Even if it were the Dragon King, he could only train it to first level’s completion. It had nothing to do with comprehensive abilities, but would require the kind of decisive power when it came to life and death situations.</p><p>“I will take this.” Ye Chen had made a decision.</p><p>The master saw that Ye Chen had picked up that particular jade bottle and frowned slightly, “Envoy, this manual cannot be trained without the palace leader’s permission himself. But, before he entered his close-up training, he said to satisfy all of your needs. Therefore, you have the right to do whatever. But, I would like to point out that no one has successfully trained this yet, even if the leader himself. Are you really sure about choosing it?”</p><p>He was thinking for Ye Chen. He did not want the latter to waste time on this secret art. If he could successfully train it then he might have nothing more to say. But, this Blood Severing Ghost Finger would be extremely tough to train. Even with the highest comprehensive ability, it would still be impossible to train.</p><p>“I will just give it a try. Don’t worry!” Although he was just saying it, Ye Chen did not plan to just do that.</p><p>“Since that is the case, then I will not say another word.” The elder sighed.</p><p>“How much contribution points would this take?” Ye Chen asked.</p><p>The elder chuckled, “You are the Dragon God Celestial Palace Envoy, so there’s no need for contribution points in your case. Plus, this secret art would not be something that the contributing points would count.”</p><p>“Since that is the case, then alright!” Ye Chen wanted to use his contribution points to exchange for it, but he also understood that this Blood Severing Ghost Finger might not be exchangeable.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
