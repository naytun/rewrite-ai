It was the kind of aura as if millions of war horses were running together.</p><p>“I did not think that Xiao Chuhe would be this scary when he was pissed off. It is nothing like what he is normally like.”</p><p>“Beiming Hui is indeed powerful though. He had even managed to wound Xiao Chuhe, I wonder if he would still have some battling power left!”</p><p>Everyone was a bit scared of Xiao Chuhe’s aura, so they chatted in a very low voice.</p><p>Xiao Chuhe had thrown out an incredibly powerful blade attack. That remaining power had kept pressing on Beiming Hui, bringing his body away and dragging out a mile long deep mark. Eventually when the power ran out, the remaining blade qi still continued to smash onto the protective shield of Beiming Hui’s. It just kept going as if it wanted to ensure a hole in it.</p><p>Meanwhile, Beiming Hui kept puking out blood. Seeing that even this remaining power was this intense, he yelled and shook his body. That powerful Zhen yuan shocked the blade qi and shockwave spread out, causing the surface of the lake to sink down.</p><p>Wahhh!</p><p>After doing all that, Beiming Hui puked out another mouthful of blood. The place where he got hit with the blade attack had gone numb completely.</p><p>“Xiao Chuhe won!”</p><p>Sitting on the peak of the mountain, Ye Chen shook his head. Beiming Hui could not fight on; that blade attack from Xiao Chuhe had contained enough power to shatter a whole ocean. The power was very dense, such that even with a shield, it had already cut off most of the meridians on Beiming Hui’s chest.</p><p>“Top five young warriors…Indeed not one of them is easy to take on.”</p><p>Besides the Godly Shark Princess whom no one really knew about, Ye Chen thought that Xiao Chuhe was one of the weaker ones amongst the five. But, judging from what he had just witnessed, although Xiao Chuhe might be way weaker than Bei Wuxue, he would not be weaker than Xia Houzun. Hence, the battle with Lu Shaoyou would be another tough battle by the looks of it.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Beiming Hui’s pupils shrank down to two dots as he stared at Xiao Chuhe. The latter’s power had exceeded his imagination. To be honest, he had never thought that highly of Xiao Chuhe, and whom he really was scared of were Bai Wuxue and Xia Houzun. One of them was very thorough, leaving no flaws at all, while the other was extremely powerful in defense. Besides these two, Beiming Hui was not even scared of Lu Shaoyou; and because that Ye Chen was also a sword artist, he thought that he could beat the two one day.</p><p>However, reality had slapped him in the face directly. Xiao Chuhe, whom he had the least interest in had displayed the kind of battling power that he had never dreamt of. Although his new Sky Bank was also very powerful, he had never thought that Xiao Chuhe could shatter four beams of it, and was only hit by that last beam of attack. Obviously, that beam of attack had only wounded him lightly, since the defense of the top five young warriors could not be weak at all; only with more than two beams of those silver rays might he be able to do a real damage.</p><p>“Damn! I was so close!”</p><p>Beiming Hui could not be madder. If he could rewind time, he would have not underestimated Xiao Chuhe and used his maximum capabilities to battle with the latter. He could be sure that if he had one more chance, Xiao Chuhe would no longer be able to shatter four attacks.</p><p>Unfortunately, there was no such thing as a time machine.</p><p>Ye Chen did not know what Beiming Hui was thinking about, and even if he did, all he would do was shake his head. The reason that Xiao Chuhe could win against Beiming Hui was because he had the power to do so. It was not something that someone could just fake. Therefore, even if there was a rematch, it would still be Beiming Hui who would lose.</p><p>“My biggest mistake was that I underestimated you.” Beiming Hui said.</p><p>Xiao Chuhe said coldly, “It was not you who underestimated me, it was just you overestimating yourself. I think it might not just be you though.”</p><p>In his opinion, Beiming Hui, Situ Hao, and Ye Chen all had overestimated themselves.</p><p>“Alright…This time, I have lost to you, so I have nothing to say to that.” In front of everyone, even if Beiming Hui hated it to the ground, all he could do was admit his failure.</p><p>As he spoke, he tiptoed on the surface of the lake before jumping into the sky and landing on a massive tree close to the lake. There, he sat down quickly after swallowing a pellet.</p><p>In the middle of the lake, Xiao Chuhe glanced at Ye Chen once before turning back to his spot.</p><p>“Beiming Hui lost!”</p><p>“The top five young warriors are indeed worthy of their titles. I am afraid that for the next year, it will not change at all. Ye Chen and Beiming Hui are still lacking a bit after all.”</p><p>It was only until Beiming Hui admitted himself before everyone found out about the result of the battle.</p><p>“I wonder how exactly powerful Du Gujue is already.” Someone said suddenly.</p><p>“Tomorrow will be the date of the battle, so you will found out soon enough.”</p><p>On a small mountain, Li Daoxuan and Yan Chihuo had watched that battle as well.</p><p>Yan Chihuo had never seen a powerful blade artist like Xiao Chuhe before. Compared to him, those blade artists from the Fire Spirit Palace would be like infants trying to learn how to walk; and he would not be much better either. That massive power gap had sharpened his will to get more powerful. He decided that he would beat powerful blade artists like the other one day and stand on top of the world.</p><p>Li Daoxuan was excited about the arrival of Lu Shaoyou. Xiao Chuhe had been beaten by him before, but it was not that well-known. Therefore, he really wanted to know how exactly sharp Lu Shaoyuo’s sword arts were, and how it would look like when compared to Ye Chen’s.</p><p>‘I really hope the two can compete with each other.’ Li Daoxuan was drowned in his thoughts as he forced a chuckle. He thought that it was not that likely to happen since Ye Chen had asked to battle with Du Gujue. If he battled with Lu Shaoyou, then it would still be a bit of a stretch, since he was a top master level warrior who had beaten Du Gujue after all.</p><p>Soon, the fourth day had come and gone.</p><p>On the fifth day morning, it was finally the time of the battle.</p><p>Before the sun had officially appeared in the sky, air-slicing sounds were heard everywhere as a lot of the warriors finally arrived in the lake area after a long journey. Amongst them were some of the very famous warriors, such as Xie Baiting. An elder with white hair was standing right next to him.</p><p>He was actually not a nobody, and was indeed the older sword master who was ranked second in the ranking named Xu Yuan. He was aged at least one hundred and fifty years old.</p><p>One of them was a blade artist ranked 5th, and the other was the sword artist ranked 2nd. It would be impossible for their arrival to be unnoticed.</p><p>“Brother Xie, thank you for pushing this battle so hard. I had been so excited about it. I cannot wait for it to take place.” Xu Yuan chuckled.</p><p>Xie Baiting said, “Xu brother, you will not be disappointed!”</p><p>“Alright! If brother Xie has said so, then I will definitely not be disappointed.” Xu Yun was very clear about Xie Baiting’s judgment. One year ago, he was not there because of his reputation, but there was no need for him to be there anyway. The reason that he had decided to join along this time was because Xie Baiting had told him about Lu Shaoyou and Xiao Chuhe.</p><p>As for the battle between Ye Chen and Du Gujue, they honestly did not really care about it, since even top of the top martial geniuses would need time to grow. Therefore, this time, it would still be focusing on Lu Shaoyou and Xiao Chuhe. Ye Chen’s battle with Du Gujue would only be a side dish.</p><p>A lot of people had recognized Xu Yuan and his identity. They were glad that they were able to witness this top martial warrior who had not been seen for many years. According to the rumors, his power had already reached the next level.</p><p>Of course, Xie Baiting’s identity was no less than Xu Yuan’s. Although his ranking was a bit behind, it was only a point of reference after all. If there were an actual battle, no one could really tell who would win. The reason that Xu Yuan seemed way more famous was because he was rarely spotted, which made him more mysterious.</p><p>The fog in the morning had finally disappeared, and the sun was one-thirds in the sky.</p><p>People with good eye sight could see a beam of white light flashing in the horizon, the distance from which was decreasing at a drastic speed.</p><p>Soon, the white light became a human figure: it was indeed Lu Shaoyou!</p><p>“He is finally here!”</p><p>“So excited! Lu Shaoyou is here first, so the battle between him and Xiao Chuhe would go first I think.”</p><p>“Ah, I actually really wanted to see the battle between Ye Chen and Du Gujue first. Otherwise, I might not be as interested after the battle between Lu Shaoyou and Xiao Chuhe.”</p><p>It was like eating; if one had been eating a lot of delicious food, one could no longer opt out for average food.</p><p>Lu Shaoyou was like a floating dragon as he appeared above the lake within the second. That flowy qi seemed to have cooled down the area.</p><p>“What a sword artist!”</p><p>Xu Yuan’s eyes brightened. Once reaching his realm, all he needed to do was sense the warrior’s qi before telling the warrior’s power level. Without a doubt, Lu Shaoyou had piqued his interest.</p><p>“Lu Shaoyou!”</p><p>Xiao Chuhe stood up as that powerful blade intent clashed with Lu Shaoyou’s sword intent. The sky seemed to start changing while countless sword shadows and blade lights seemed to appear vaguely.</p><p>Some of the weaker warriors could feel the chill run down their spines and their hair stand up on their arms. This included Li Daoxuan and Yan Chihuo, one of whom was a sword artist while the other was a blade artist.</p><p>“It seems like we will have to battle first. But, it is for the best I think. The sooner we battle, the sooner we can leave.” Lu Shaoyou had no interest in watching Ye Chen and Du Gujue battle, especially if he had to wait for it.</p><p>“I was thinking the same. The other battles do not mean much to me.”</p><p>Xiao Chuhe’s wounds had been cured completely. As long as it was not too severe a wound, he could heal most of them.</p><p>“Let’s do this!” Lu Shaoyou breath calmly, but his eyes got sharper and sharper.</p><p>Relaxing his body, Xiao Chuhe was about to fly out before he made a slight noise as he looked into the distance. A grey light was approaching.</p><p>“It is Du Gujue! He is finally here!” Someone yelled out.</p><p>The light was moving at an extreme speed. When it was getting close to the lake, the protective Zhen yuan layer had been let go as it appeared in the middle of the lake.</p><p>Without looking at anyone else, Du Gujue found Ye Chen with his grey colored pupils.</p><p>Ye Chen sat on the mountain as he put away his new-found manual and lifted up his head, looking over relaxedly. He was a bit surprised as he sensed his opponent’s qi and thoughts seemed to have passed through his mind.</p><p>Whoo!</p><p>All of a sudden, an aggressive, hysterical aura was released from Du Gujue’s body and a despairing blade intent poured out toward Ye Chen. Those people who were standing close to him had sensed hell, that emotion of despair growing in their heads as they started to look pained.</p><p>“What a horrifying blade intent!” Ye Chen did not move, but Xie Baiting did. He released out his own blade intent which clashed with Du Gujue’s.</p><p>What shocked him was that the second his blade intent touched Du Gujue’s, he could sense a surreal Du Gujue jumping at him with a blade. That despairing blade light filled up his whole mind, and he could not help but gasp for air.</p><p>“Wow, so scary! Ye Chen will definitely lose this one!” Xie Baiting’s body shook once as he let go of his blade intent. Cold sweat appeared on his forehead.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
