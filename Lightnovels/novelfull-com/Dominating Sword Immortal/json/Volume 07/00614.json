The space profound was one of the most powerful profounds, and only slightly weaker than the time profound. If it clashed with other profounds, the winner would definitely be the space profound without a doubt. Wanting to compete with it, then one would have to have a similar level profound; without it, one would have to be better at the martial arts than the other. Being slightly more powerful in some aspects would not be useful in this situation at all.</p><p>“Lose!”</p><p>Xia Houzun’s eyes shone with a bright light as he pointed out his finger at Bai Wuxue, who was a thousand meters away from him. As he threw out that attack, the rich space power had been added into his finger power. It sliced through the sky before accumulating into a pointy, tower-shaped, massive, golden finger, pressing onto Bai Wuxue.</p><p>“You can’t escape!”</p><p>Bai Wuxue wanted to dodge, but the space power was extremely mysterious. With the horrifying effect of shortening distance, it made it seem that it was still a thousand meters away, but the real distance might only be five hundred meters.</p><p>“Since I cannot avoid that attack, then I will not escape.”</p><p>“Life Shield! Ultimate Defence!”</p><p>Bai Wuxue had already started the formation of his spell when Chu Zhongtian was performing his Void Shattering Finger Attack. His speed of forming the spell had been pushed to its limit, such that it was already impossible for others to see his hands anymore; only a blurry green light ball could be seen there. Behind him, Zhen yuan branches expanded out of his body, which looked extremely ancient on the surface and were similar to the Zhen yuan ancient tree from before.</p><p>Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!…</p><p>Being enhanced by countless Zhen yuan branches, Bai Wuxue looked like a giant spider. An air-slicing sound was heard as all of the Zhen yuan branches reached in front of Bai Wuxue, forming into a green shield that was made out of tree branches. They all guarded in front of him, connecting with a lot of other tree branches.</p><p>In the next second, the golden finger landed on the green shield, creating an earth-shaking sound.</p><p>“The shield had been broken through!”</p><p>Everyone who was watching the battle could see that the green shield had been broken open with a massive crack, and the attack was almost making its way through.</p><p>“Oh, wait! The shield is repairing itself at a crazy speed!” The people with great sight were shocked at what they had just witnessed.</p><p>That golden finger was unstoppable, capable of devouring most of the energy on that shield to make itself stronger. But, the green shield was not shattered at the touch of it, as the countless green tree branches served as a channel for more power to generate the ones he lost. Hence, even if the golden finger had absorbed some parts, it would still be fine for him.</p><p>“It is the power of life! I did not expect that Bai Wuxue had learned the profound of life.” Someone cried out.</p><p>Time was the most important profound of this world, with space being the second in lead. It was obvious that the time profound was naturally the most powerful of them all, since it was a chain that connected the past, present, and future. Then there was the profound of space next, and to some degree, it was no weaker than the profound of time. While being under the space profound, there were still quite a lot of relatively powerful profounds, such as the profound of Yin, Yang, Life, and Death. Even more significantly, once one combined the profound of Yin and Yang, or Life and Death, it would be form an equivalently powerful profound. Just because these polar-opposite profounds would need to be combined manually, which was way more complicated that the profound of space itself, they had less of a reputation than the former.</p><p>Although the profound of life was not as powerful as the profound of space alone, Bai Wuxue’s understanding of his profound was obviously way deeper than Xia Houzun’s. The never-ending power of life continued to be poured into the green shield, canceling out the incoming attack of the golden finger.</p><p>“He has comprehended the profound of life!” Xia Houzun was a bit shocked. He threw out another Void Shattering Finger toward Bai Wuxue, wanting to shatter him with one attack.</p><p>Bai Wuxue reached both his hands out forward, his green shield seeming unbreakable. After the activation of his profound of life, an endless power was being generated, which canceled out the incoming golden finger attack.</p><p>“Xia Houzun’s Void Shattering Finger has been blocked out…It is indeed Bai Wuxue!”</p><p>“I wonder what will happen next. I wonder if Xia Houzun will continue to use his Void Shattering Finger or not.”</p><p>“I do not think he would, would he? The more powerful the profound, the more Zhen yuan it would require. If he continues to force it, he will burn out his Zhen yuan way faster than Bai Wuxue.”</p><p>“That’s a good point!”</p><p>Hearing everyone’s discussion, Xie Baiting thought to himself. “He had probably learned his profound of life from his wood profound, right? In the five core profound, both the wood and water profound could contain the profound of life. Even the profound of mud would contain a bit of it as well. Cultivating the wood profound to its peak, he might be able to comprehend the profound of life under the condition that he has a great comprehensive ability.</p><p>Everything in this world was connected, including time and space, because everything was formed from nothing.</p><p>“Bai Wuxue, you are really powerful! You might be powerful to a level where I have to be impressed as well. But, if you think this is all I have got, then you would be horribly mistaken. Correct…the Void Shattering Finger might be the profound martial art with the most powerful attacking power. But, it is not my best profound martial art. This is my most powerful martial art invented by me and for me! Take this…Star Nuclear Finger Attack!”</p><p>Xie Houzun did not perform his Void Shattering Finger again as he flashed his body, approaching Bai Wuxue at an extreme speed. That green shield could only block out in front of him, so it would be impossible for him to guard everywhere around him.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>Xie Houzun arrived at Bai Wuxue’s side, throwing out a finger attack.</p><p>Pop!</p><p>Where Bai Wuxue was standing, all of the air, yuan qi, and even the lake water was pushed toward Xia Houzun, before eventually being compressed into a light ball. At the same time, Bai Wuxue, who was also in this space, could not help but be pulled in as that inviolable pressure pressed onto him cruelly.</p><p>“This is the Star Nuclear Gravity!” Bai Wuxue frowned.</p><p>“Indeed! This is a martial movement I learned from my starlight profound. Judging on its battling power, it might not be as powerful as my Void Shattering Finger Art, but it can accomplish the things that the Void Shattering Finger cannot, such as beating you.”</p><p>Xia Houzun was very confident; it was not something he born with, but something that was purely power driven.</p><p>“Indeed, this is very impressive!”</p><p>Bai Wuxue let go of his shield and activated his Zhen yuan, trying to block out the star nuclear gravity that Xia Houzun had unleashed. He did not doubt at all that once he let the power affect him, he would be torn apart for sure. With those kinds of severe injuries, he would not make it through the battle. Therefore, distance would be very important.</p><p>“Qi Flow Hundred Day!”</p><p>Bai Wuxue attacked Xia Houzun with a palm attack and the qi power poured out. But, what surprised him a lot was that the movement that had been treated so perfectly by him could not be performed for some reason. The second he let out his Zhen yuan, it would be dragged away. It was impossible to accumulate it together, making it a complete waste of Zhen yuan.</p><p>“Haha! This attack not only makes an impact on you, but also your Zhen yuan.”</p><p>“I cannot attack, and I guess my defense will not work at this stage either. Even my protective Zhen yuan is being affected.”</p><p>Bai Wuxue could sense that his protective Zhen yuan was twisting, looking like it would shatter at any moment. Xia Houzun’s power was way more powerful than he had expected.</p><p>“Since I cannot block it out, then I might as well go the other way around. This Star Nuclear Gravity power should not be able to disturb the natural balance. There must be a limit of this kind of power.”</p><p>Even while facing this kind of danger, Bai Wuxue did not lose his cool. He took a deep breath as the Zhen yuan in his dantian exploded like a broken dam, rushing through his meridians. The green Zhen yuan was like a burning flame, continuing to grow madly.</p><p>“What?” Xia Houzun did not really understand what Bai Wuxue was doing.</p><p>Lin Chaonan, one of the top three blade artists, could not understand it either. Hence, he turned and asked Xie Baiting, “Brother Xie, what do you think Bai Wuxue is planning to do with this?”</p><p>Xie Baiting could tell that Bai Wuxue’s Zhen yuan had been absorbed by Xia Houzun, and was being compressed into a green light ball. As it grew bigger and bigger, Xia Houzun’s control over it was getting weaker and weaker. He sighed, “Such a powerful battling experience! For a brief second, even I could not come up with an appropriate response to that attack. I cannot believe that he made it. He is doing exactly what Xia Houzun wanted him to do, but with a twist. He is burning his own Zhen yuan to cancel out Xia Houzun’s attack, since the latter also comes with a limitation. Once the former breaks through the limitation, the attack will become useless.”</p><p>After being reminded by Xie Baiting, Lin Chaonan realized it immediately as well, and a surprised expression appeared on his face.</p><p>It was very obvious that Xia Houzun had also realized what Bai Wuxue was doing, so he said with a gloomy expression, “Do you really think this is going to work? You performed an attack earlier on that I did not foresee, and now, you should taste the feast I have prepared for you.”</p><p>The Star Nuclear Finger Attack was not the active attacking type. Of course, it was also not the kind would just wait to be attacked. It was somewhere in the middle.</p><p>“Explode!”</p><p>Xia Houzun did something rather strange as well. He flashed his body and backed out at an extreme speed, escaping from where Bai Wuxue was.</p><p>“The Shield of Life!”</p><p>Bai Wuxue’s expression changed as he hurried to reach out his right hand. Dozens of Zhen yuan branches appeared from his arm, forming into a tiny green shield.</p><p>In the next second, the Zhen yuan ball that had been compressed into a green light ball exploded. It was Bai Wuxue’s Zhen yuan, ending up being another way of making one pay with his own power.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The green shield shattered and Bai Wuxue was blown backward into the sky. Midway, he suddenly sank down, pressing both of his hands onto the surface of the lake.</p><p>“Life Spear!”</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>At the bottom of the lake, countless Zhen yuan streams formed into a long spear and jumped out of the water which happened to be right below Xie Houzun. As a result, that spear landed right on his protective Zhen yuan.</p><p>Pooh!</p><p>After his protective Zhen yuan was shattered, Xia Houzun puked out a huge amount of blood.</p><p>Arrhh!</p><p>After throwing out that attack, Bai Wuxue had also been wounded quite badly. Blood leaked out of the corner of his mouth, dyeing the lake below him.</p><p>“Bai Wuxue won?”</p><p>No one watching the battle was sure what just had happened. They all looked at each other, exchanging looks.</p><p>On that small hill, Yan Fengfeng, Hai Wuya, and the others also did not know who really won, since by judging on the surface, Bai Wuxue had badly wounded Xia Houzun; so, it would be him who had won. But, he was wounded himself as well. If Xia Houzun still had the power to battle again, then it would still not be the end of this battle.</p><p>Whoo!</p><p>It was right then when Ye Chen, who was standing right next to Murong Qingcheng, leaked out a wave of intensely powerful space vibration which was getting stronger and stronger. It was intense to the point where Murong Qingcheng was forced to get away from him for now.</p><p>“Void Shattering Finger, sixty percent!”</p><p>“Seventy percent!”</p><p>In that not-so-long period of time, Ye Chen managed to train his space profound into the next extremely powerful level, mainly because he was stuck at fifty percent before and was missing that one important factor. He had accumulated enough, and all he needed was to make it through the blockage. Once he found the right trigger, it happened so smoothly and quickly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
