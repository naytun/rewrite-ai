The golden sword involuntarily unsheathed, and a dense sword Qi circled his head twice. Next, the golden sword suddenly shook and segmented into two more vivid golden swords. These swords were created from Zhen Yuan simulation—the three swords were integral, without any difference.</p><p>To split out Zhen Yuan flying sword was by no means easy. The most challenging aspect of it was to let it happen naturally. If done forcefully, not to mention three, even hundred could be easily accomplished. Unfortunately, they wouldn’t have any significance at all. A forcefully created Zhen Yuan flying sword was merely equivalent to an ordinary Zhen Yuan attack. Even with Ye Chen’s dreadful sword intent, its might would not be that great. After cultivating for a while, Ye Chen was only able to split out two Zhen Yuan flying swords at most.</p><p>A true Zhen Yuan flying sword’s might should at least be one third of its main body. Otherwise, it would not be considered perfected, and its power would be deemed insufficient.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Three sword shadows shot out, stabbing into a somewhat damaged upper grade shield.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Three sword holes appeared on the shield. The mid sword hole was extremely thin as if been delicately polished. Meanwhile, the two side holes were somewhat warped, giving off a burnt sulfur smell like that of rotten eggs.</p><p>This shield was a part of Ye Chen’s war spoils in the Blood Battle Ocean. He handed all the treasures in good condition to the palace, and in return, the palace rewarded him sufficiently. As for the broken ones, he had kept a portion for himself. He discovered that using broken upper grade artifacts were quite good for testing offensive power. After all, regardless of how broken they were, upper grade artifacts couldn’t be compared to mid grade artifacts, and were impossible to be destroyed by ordinary Sea of Soul Masters. Thus, they were optimal tools for testing offensive power.</p><p>“Not bad! They have more or less one-third might of the main body.” Judging from the size and appearances of sword holes, it was not difficult for Ye Chen to estimate their capabilities.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>The Zhen Yuan flying sword pierced through the upper grade shield. In the next moment, it went hazy before vanishing like smoke, leaving behind two strands of green mist.</p><p>The golden sword was still as sharp as before.</p><p>Shua!</p><p>Ye Chen’s sword fingers made a pulling gesture, and the golden sword returned back to its sheath.</p><p>“Ye Chen, aunt is calling you for dinner!”</p><p>Not far away, a purple-robed Murong Qingcheng with an unmasked face walked over, bringing a fragrant wind with her.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll come right away. First, let me change my clothes.”</p><p>Ye Chen kissed Murong Qingcheng and headed to his room. Splitting Zhen Yuan flying swords required an immense concentration, and thus, his body was slightly sweating.</p><p>…</p><p>Days passed by, and Ye Chen cultivated every day. During the time he did not cultivate, he spent it with Murong Qingcheng, feeling quite fulfilled.</p><p>One day, an attendant from Luo City’s Unsought Truth Pavillion brought a message.</p><p>It turned out to be a letter from Yan Fengfeng, asking Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng for a meeting in the Sky Martial Region. Since the distance was too great, she had the letter delivered by the number one information organization, the Unsought Truth Pavillion. It had shops covering the entire continent, making it the fastest means of exchanging information.</p><p>Upon reading the letter, Ye Chen said to Murong Qingcheng, “It’s been quite a while since we visited the Sky Martial City. Let’s head out tomorrow!”</p><p>Sky Martial Region was considered a sacred ground for most of the geniuses, but for Ye Chen, it didn’t mean anything special. The higher one stood, the more indifferent they would become.</p><p>Since the distance was too great, they didn’t have to travel by themselves. Both of them mounted the flying puppet and slowly headed toward the Sky Martial Region with a speed ten times that of sound.</p><p>In the world, ordinary people worked and worked, but didn’t accomplish much. Every day, in order to make ends meet, they left early and returned late, yet also dancing to the beats of the rich. En-route, Ye Chen didn’t have the puppet fly too high. As they passed over a city, they witnessed upon a very familiar scene. If his soul had not crossed over, perhaps he would also be a part of the people under, toiling away. However, he didn’t have to worry about those things now. What he pursued was the peak of the sword dao and exploring the mysteries of the heaven and earth.</p><p>Unwittingly, Ye Chen discovered that he had already left the mundane world, attaining a higher realm. The people below him were common people in his view. Even if their life were pleasant and fulfilling, the target they sought was completely different.</p><p>A month later, the two arrived at the Sky Martial Region.</p><p>The place Yan Fengfeng invited Ye Chen to was one of the ten biggest cities of the continent—Lotus City. The entire city was structured blue. Ye Chen could see arrays of buildings and complexes from far away, several hundred meters high. Even the shortest ones were more or less the same, stretching as far as the eye could see.</p><p>Shua!</p><p>Not lowering his flying speed, they directly entered the city.</p><p>White Cloud Restaurant was one of the two biggest restaurants of the city. It was luxurious, but not extravagant, made of antique Cloud Section Wood. It had eighteen floors; each floor was twenty meters high and sufficiently wide, capable of holding several hundred people. Sitting on the eighteenth floor, the white clouds seemed within a palm’s grasp.</p><p>“Ye Chen!”</p><p>On the eighteenth floor, Yan Fengfeng spotted Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng. Beside her were numerous disciples of the Mysterious Sect and Hai Wuya.</p><p>Putting the flying puppet back in, Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng directly floated into the eighteenth floor.</p><p>“It’s been a while.” Ye Chen cupped his fists.</p><p>Hai Wuya smiled, “You kid, I thought you forgot us, not showing your face for nearly two years! This time, we’ll drink to our heart’s content.”</p><p>“Sure!”</p><p>Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng sat down and poured whole cups down their throats.</p><p>“Drink!” Hai Wuya and Yan Fengfeng emptied one cup each as well.</p><p>“Elder brother Ye!”</p><p>“Hello, elder brother Ye!”</p><p>The disciples of Mysterious Sect and Sky Ocean Sect greeted Ye Chen one by one. Many among them were seeing him for the first time in person, and thus were somewhat reserved.</p><p>Ye Chen smiled faintly, “Relax.”</p><p>Hai Wuya said, “With you here, they won’t be able to relax. Think about your identity for a moment. You’ll get used to it, so don’t mind it too much.”</p><p>“Is this not Sword Master Ye Chen?”</p><p>“It turns out that Yan Fenfeng invited him.”</p><p>Every floor of the restaurant could hold several hundred people, and those who could enter the eighteenth floor were all either high level members of the sects or peak geniuses, many among whom had seen Ye Chen previously. A few of them had quite a reputation in Sky Martial City. However, when they saw Ye Chen, each and every one of them started gossiping in low voices and with excited countenances.</p><p>“Ever since Ye Chen received the title of Sword Master, he went missing. Many said that he was afraid of not being able to keep the title of Sword Master. Now that he is back, I wonder how many of them will dare to say these words on his face.”</p><p>“Of course, they wouldn’t dare! They can only talk behind his back.”</p><p>“That’s how it is. There are not many who would dare say it to his face.”</p><p>A lot of murmurs could be heard, and many glances fell on Ye Chen from time to time.</p><p>Within a year, during Ye Chen’s absence, the new Masters Ranking was out, with Du Gujue in the lead, ranked second. Tantai Mingyue immediately shocked all the spectators once he acted, getting ranked third. Bai Wuxue had been in the top since the very beginning, ranked fourth. Most of the top twenty positions had been occupied by the young experts, kicking out the old generation experts.</p><p>However, the first was still Ye Chen. In this generation of geniuses that seemed to be breeding like flies, Ye Chen could be the only one to claim the first spot for two consecutive years. Back in the day, Ye Chen was also merely one amongst these geniuses. However, as of now, his fame had already spread all over the place. And while there were many who had not seen him, there were hardly any who hadn’t heard his name.</p><p>However, the newborn calves wouldn’t fear the tigers. This was some new geniuses’ attitudes toward Ye Chen. They only saw the frightening Du Gujue, the shocking Tantai Mingyue, and the elegant Bai Wuyue. As for Ye Chen, they thought he would sooner or later lose his spot.</p><p>After all, nobody could say for certain that they would continually make great progress throughout the year. The time period of one year was enough for many transformations; for example, the changes in the Masters Ranking.</p><p>“Sword Master Ye Chen…seems interesting.”</p><p>On a table by the window sat a group of three young individuals. The young man sitting to the left had a tall and lofty figure like a pagoda. His arms were much thicker than normal, and he carried a huge blade on his waist. His tiger eyes seemed to carry a frightening power. Beside him sat a young woman in a multi-colored robe, carrying a foreigner’s temperament. Her eyes were big, the bridge of the nose raised high, and lips were red and plump. Her appearance was charming and figure was provocative, while her complexion was light wheatish, looking exceptionally healthy.</p><p>Sitting before the two was a youngster. His two hands holding the wine cup were extremely slender like a bamboo stick. His appearance was not extraordinary, but neither was it ugly. His eyes were thin and exceptionally sharp at the corners. At this moment, the corner of his mouth was slightly raised, carrying a trace of malice.</p><p>The clothes of the three young individuals stood out from the rest. It seemed like they had come from some far away place.</p><p>“Talking sword before elder brother Liu is disgracing oneself.” The young woman said with a sweet voice, not trying to cover her voice in the slightest.</p><p>“That’s right!”</p><p>“Who are you people?”</p><p>On the table beside them, some reputed geniuses who had been won over by Ye Chen frowned and asked.</p><p>“We’re from the Western Ocean.” The youngster answered without moving his head at all.</p><p>“West Ocean? No matter where you come from, you better show some awareness. Ye Chen is not someone you can talk down at will.”</p><p>“So what?” The youngster faintly shook his wine cup, swirling the translucent wine.</p><p>“You come from the Western Ocean and have no achievements in True Spirit Continent. What rights do you have to talk down?”</p><p>The woman spoke with disdain, “You know Lu Shaoyou?”</p><p>“Lu Shaoyu, we know him, of course! What about him?”</p><p>Although Ye Chen, Du Gujue, Tantai Mingyue, and Yan Fengfeng would sooner or later become the five young tycoons. Lu Shaoyu had already been one. Who knew what realm his current strength had reached.</p><p>“Half a year ago, he arrived at West Ocean, but he couldn’t even take ten sword strikes from brother Liu. Your so-called Sword Master Ye Chen might not be as powerful as you think.”</p><p>“What? Lu Shaoyu couldn’t take ten moves? Moreover, it was half a year ago!”</p><p>Half a year ago, Lu Shaoyu certainly would have been much more powerful than before. But still, he couldn’t take ten sword strikes of this youngster. Who the hell was this youngster!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
