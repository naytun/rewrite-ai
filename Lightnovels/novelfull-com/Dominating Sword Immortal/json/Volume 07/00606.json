Inside the city, it snowed three hundred days of the year, and the weather was always gloomy. Sometimes, it could have such heavy wind that it could blow away houses and normal people.</p><p>Inside an estate in the city, Ye Chen and Murong Qingchengg lived a quiet life. At times they would make tea and chat together, forgetting about the whole world and the bloody battles.</p><p>Of course, the two did not forget about training either.</p><p>On the empty ground that was covered in thick snow, Ye Chen moved his body at an incredibly fast speed while holding a normal giant sword. The sword light danced in the air, with beams of golden light shooting out of the tip of the sword.</p><p>“A sword art is not good just because it is complicated. It should be getting closer to the profound. If that could be achieved, then half of the job is done. If I cannot, then it would take even longer to get to that level. For the gold profound, it is all about its sharpness. But, I still feel like I have missed something.”</p><p>The sword qi made up of the gold yuan qi shot out.</p><p>Crack! Crack! The thick frost was cut open, and the lake water poured up from below. With the improvement of the sword qi, the ice frost had almost been shattered completely. Some of it directly turned into dust due to the sharp sword qi.</p><p>Inside the lake, circle of patterns spread out.</p><p>He glanced at the moving lake water. Without him even noticing, he stopped everything else he was doing just to stare at the pattern.</p><p>“Gold…water…gold? Water… Ah! Gold makes water!”</p><p>Something inside Ye Chen’s mind seemed to have been switched on, and he had an enlightenment.</p><p>It was a common knowledge that the classic five elements canceled out each other: gold made water, water made wood, wood made fire, fire made mud, and mud made gold. Normally, the gold mines were always near the lake—every place with gold would have water around. As for gold making water, it was not referring to when gold melted and would turn into liquid. Instead, it meant that when gold/metal sat there for a long time, there would be water on the surface. In a deeper sense, the gold qi was gentle and calm, which would make for great sword arts containing the gold profound. But, one could not just focus on the gold element; instead, one should look into the water element as well.</p><p>After finding the breaking point, Ye Chen continued to train his sword art. It was not hard to tell that his sword art was no longer just sharp and aggressive; it slowly started to have this gentleness that did not cancel out the sharpness of the sword art. Instead, it made the sword art even more full of attacking power and room for leverage.</p><p>Three days later…</p><p>Ting!</p><p>A crispy sword clinging was heard as Ye Chen waved his long sword in the air and dozens of gold sword qi spread out like a pattern, spreading out toward the fake mountains around.</p><p>The fake mountain did not move at all.</p><p>A smile revealed on his face as he pushed out his left hand again, and a wave of palm power blew out.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>The fake mountain cracked open into pieces, scattering all over the ground. The edges were smooth and clean as if they were made that way purposefully, and there was zero dust in comparison to using the gold profound sword art before, which always left small particles in the air. It was because the sword qi was too sharp and powerful, which had scattered the power a little.</p><p>The gentleness had actually made the sword qi come together.</p><p>“This attack is only just forming, but I guess I have finally made it onto the right path. Since it is an inspiration I got from water, then I will call it Gold Pattern.”</p><p>Gold Pattern!</p><p>The first mid-rank profound sword art Ye Chen had invented!</p><p>Its power had twice that of Gold Resonant Radiance, and it was still not completely finished. Once completed, the regular mid-rank profound martial art would not have this level of power, because this movement was no longer the simple gold profound sword art anymore.</p><p>On this day, the sky was clear, which had not happened for a while. However, the white snow was still everywhere, covering the ground.</p><p>“I have been here for a couple of days now, and I have still not been to the city yet. Ah well, it is a nice day for a walk.” After spending some time together, Ye Chen and Murong Qingchengg had gotten closer and closer. The two were both enjoying each other’s warmth, holding hands as they walked out of the estate.</p><p>As one of the top ten cities, it was not surprising that there were so many people coming and going here. Once the sky cleared out, the whole street was full of people; some of them wore blades, some of them were traveling around, and there were also businessmen who seemed to be traveling a lot. There were also ladies and gentlemen from rich families roaming about the place.</p><p>Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng walked amongst the group and looked quite different, so everyone could not help but give them a second look. After walking around for a while, the two came to a restaurant, sitting down right next to the windows.</p><p>“Have you heard? On the eighteenth of September, the God Finger Master Xia Houzun and Bai Wuxue called on a battle on the Nine Dragon Mountain.” Inside the restaurant lobby, someone suddenly told a surprising news.</p><p>“What? Xia Houzun and White Wuxue asked for a battle? Is it real?”</p><p>“Naturally! Right now, this news has spread out in the whole Sky Martial Region. This city is located in the south of the region, so the news got here a bit slower.”</p><p>“The top five young warriors had made a pact together with each other. This is massive! Normally, if they battle with each other, they would not make it a big deal and do it secretly. Once the battle is settled, a result would have to come out of that, so it is going to be rather brutal. Within the last five years, only Sword Master and Xiao Chuhe had battled once. At that time, the sword master was slightly more powerful, so he wounded Xiao Chuhe with one sword. But, according to the rumors, Xiao Chuhe has grown to a mysterious level within these five years. Therefore, he might not be weaker than the sword master anymore. Xiao Houzun and Bai Wuxue had never exposed their most powerful skills yet, so I cannot believe that they are going to call for a battle.”</p><p>Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng heard these people and could not help but get intrigued by what they were talking about.</p><p>“September 18th…it is still one and half month away.” Murong Qingcheng said.</p><p>Ye Chen said, “I had seen Bai Wuxue once…He is extremely powerful, and his aura was everywhere, more powerful than even Lin Tianmu’s Cloud Crane Flow. The top five young warriors should all be at the peak of their Sea of Souls Realm. If they continue their growth, they would almost reach the Life and Death Realm.”</p><p>“I wonder if those old generation of master level warriors can still compete with these five?” She said.</p><p>Ye Chen shook his head, “Being able to win against these five would be extremely hard. But of course, it would not be impossible. The leader of the Yellow Dragon Palace Zhang Zhengguang seemed to have the power. The other four palaces, the black dragon, blue dragon, white dragon, and red dragon, might also have leaders with similar power. They might even reach beyond the top five. Then there are also the top three blade master artists, as Xiao Chuhe had only won against one of them after all.”</p><p>“Sounds right!” Murong Qingcheng nodded, “Right now, there is a rumor in Sky Martial Region that you are the number one warrior right below the top five young warriors Even Du Gujue and Dantai Mingyue have been surpassed by you.”</p><p>Ye Chen chuckled, “This should not be counted. You also know that I had made quite some big breakthroughs a couple of months ago. But right now, I have slowed down. Judging by this speed, the others must have made great breakthroughs, so just winning at one moment cannot prove anything.”</p><p>As the two talked, the restaurant got louder and louder.</p><p>“Hey, you guys think who is more powerful? Xia Houzun or Bai Wuxue?”</p><p>“I don’t know… Xia Houzun and Bai Wuxue had their own great moments. Xia Houzun is the top master level warrior when it comes to finger arts, while Bai Wuxue is the only Sea of Souls Realm warrior who had made it out of the ghost region in the past twenty years. I really wonder who is more powerful.”</p><p>“Although that is right, I still think Xia Houzun is more powerful. You have not seen his finger art…It is extremely powerful! I heard that it is some kind of Void Shattering Finger, and contains the space profound!”</p><p>“The space profound!”</p><p>Gasping sounds could be heard everywhere, while Ye Chen’s pupils shrank as well.</p><p>“Ye Chen, what happened?” Murong Qingcheng asked.</p><p>He forced a smile and said, “You should also know it that I have a finger art, and it also contains the profound of space, called the Void Shattering Finger. If I have guessed it right, then both Xia Houzun’s and mine should come from the same source, which means that they are two movements within the Void Shattering Finger Art.”</p><p>“Two movements? Does it mean that besides you two, there might be others out there?”</p><p>Ye Chen said, “I do not know how many movements he has, but I think I will run into him at some point in the future. I just do not know how it will go down yet.”</p><p>The Void Shattering Finger and that white key he found from the Goat Head Mountain carried a great treasure. So far, Ye Chen had no idea what it meant yet, but he vaguely could tell that it would be a tomb where an emperor warrior lay. But of course, it was just an understanding based on the literal translation; as for what it actually meant, it was impossible to tell so far with all the limited clues.</p><p>“Then you should reveal your Void Shattering Finger lesser in the future.” Murong Qingcheng reminded.</p><p>Ye Chen said, “I will. This time, the battle between Xia Houzun and Bai Wuxue would be a great chance for me to watch. Perhaps my Void Shattering Finger would breakthrough to the profound sense level as well.”</p><p>Needless to say, Xia Houzun’s achievement in Void Shattering Finger would be higher than Ye Chen’s, since he was ten years older than the latter, and it would be impossible to make zero breakthroughs during that time. Otherwise, he would not have been ranked among the top five young warriors. While Xia Houzun and Bai Wuxue battled, he would definitely use his Void Shattering Finger. At that time, Ye Chen would watch his martial art while trying to understand his own space profound.</p><p>“Haha, it is less than one and half month until 18th of September. With my speed, I will be able to make it to the Nine Dragon Mountain right on time. After drinking this while, I will start my journey immediately.”</p><p>“Right! It would be such a waste if we do not go there and watch this kind of a battle. Plus, the top young warriors have booked battles with each other, so everyone powerful in this world would join in to watch as well.”</p><p>“Not just the young warriors, the older master level warriors could come as well. They would want to see the top young warriors for sure, to see how exactly powerful they had gotten.”</p><p>Xia Houzun and Bai Wuxue’s battle was just too intriguing, and the atmosphere in the restaurant was very intense; it could not quiet down for a long time.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Putting down some gold, Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng walked out.</p><p>Amongst all of the people drinking, someone glanced at Ye Chen and looked at the man sitting right next to him while saying, “Why do I think he looks like Ye Chen who had beaten Lin Tian?”</p><p>“Ye Chen? Let me see.” The person looked over and frowned, then looked at Murong Qingcheng who was standing right next to him, “It is Ye Chen. Ever since the incident in the West Ling City, there is always a young woman in purple dress with light veil right next to him.”</p><p>“Ye Chen!”</p><p>The others’ attention had been attracted over by their conversation. Unfortunately, by the time everyone realized, Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng had already left.</p><p>There was a rumor inside the Sky Martial Region that Ye Chen was the number one warrior right below the top young five warriors. And that news had already spread out to the Mysterious Ming City.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
