We would only be wasting our warriors for no reason.”</p><p>Six hundred warriors against two hundred and seventy would definitely be an absolute advantage, but wanting to kill all of them would still not be that easy.</p><p>Plus, amongst these two hundred and seventy people, there were still Ye Chen and Lin Canghai. If these two wanted to escape, then they would manage to do it without a doubt. In other words, if they decided to fight head-on, then it would probably end up with Ye Chen and Lin Canghai escaping, and them losing another one-third of their people.</p><p>Killing one thousand opponents, but losing eight hundred of their own…It was not something that the leader of the Whirlwind Gate team wanted to see. After speaking, he stared at the leader of the Black King Martial School.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, the latter said with a low voice: “You are quite right! Indeed, it was I who did not think it through. After getting back, I will report it.”</p><p>“That’s right. I believe the management will not ignore this person’s existence either. They will want to send someone to take care of him unless he just hides away this whole time.”</p><p>Taking a deep breath, the leader of the Whirlwind Gate revealed a smile.</p><p>“Everyone from the Black King Martial School, listen up…Back out!”</p><p>“Everyone from the Whirlwind Gate, listen up…Back out!”</p><p>The two reached an agreement, so they immediately gave out the orders.</p><p>“They are backing out?”</p><p>Over at Ye Chen’s side, they did not know what to do anymore. They had never expected to see the enemies backing out when they had way more people.</p><p>“Haha, they really decided to back out! We won!”</p><p>Seeing that the leader of the Black King Martial School and Whirlwind Gate left with all of their warriors, all of the warriors from the Dragon Palace cheered. They were not afraid of death, but they still wanted to live after all. Even if they were confident about Ye Chen, they did not think there would be no deaths amongst them during upcoming battles, since there were twice as many enemies as them. It was something that could not be ignored.</p><p>It was right then when the leader of the Black King Martial School, who was already rather far away, said with a loud voice, “I will remember this day. Next time, I will make your head separate from your body.”</p><p>“There might not be a next time.”</p><p>Ye Chen had not yet revealed his peak power yet. During these battles, individual power had been quite underutilized. Even if it were Ye Chen, he would not dare to take on too many attacks. But, he had trained his Defensive sword spell, and his speed could be increased to a crazy level. Not to mention if there were hundreds of people surrounding him, even if there were thousands of them, he could make it out nonetheless.</p><p>But, it was his ace attack, which should not be revealed too easily.</p><p>“I wish you can say this when the time comes.” The leader of the Black King Martial School team soon led his people to leave the area, disappearing into the horizon.</p><p>Whoo!</p><p>Letting out a big breath suddenly, Xu Danian let out a joyous expression as he held his fists together to greet Ye Chen. “Deputy Ye, I cannot put my gratitude in words.”</p><p>Putting away the battle vehicle, the latter smiled lightly.</p><p>“Alright, deputy Ye, how did you guys come here? Were you not ambushed?” Since they were ambushed badly, Ye Chen’s side must have suffered the same thing as well. As for how he managed to bring his warriors and survive, they could not help but wonder. Perhaps, Ye Chen could tell the future in advance?</p><p>Ye Chen said, “We killed our way through.”</p><p>Xu Danian could not understand.</p><p>Xing Meilian jumped in to say, “Leader Ye has said it correctly, we have made our way through by killing. We killed all of the warriors from the Water Wave School and Sky Eagle Cult, more than one thousand and three hundred of them in total. Of course, without our leader Ye, we would have been in exactly the same situation as you. We would have been ambushed and lost most of our men.”</p><p>“One thousand and three hundred warriors?” Xu Danian had his eyes wide open.</p><p>…</p><p>All of the resources from the two islands had been collected completely. Then, they flew over toward the following island, the No.2 Volcano Island. After collecting a lot of mid rank Fire Cloud Stones, everyone started to head back.</p><p>…</p><p>The news of Ye Chen and the crew getting back did not spark much attention. But, when the news of Ye Chen killing two thousand warriors with his crew spread out, it shocked the whole palace.</p><p>Two thousand warriors was a lot. In the past couple of years, all the warriors that the palace had killed might only be that much when added up together. In other words, it was a pure success! It would at least keep the enemy at bay for a while.</p><p>Originally, the warriors inside the palace were already giving up, not united at all. But, after this news was spread out, their first reaction was to tighten their fists as their face turned red from excitement. An image appeared in their heads naturally—Ye Chen in blue robes leading hundreds of warriors while running around the battlefield and killing all of the enemies.</p><p>Ye Chen had brought them hope and ambition which had disappeared a long time ago.</p><p>“Deputy Ye lost quite a few warriors as well. Let’s not waste any time and apply to join his team! If we are late, then it would not be our turn anymore.”</p><p>“Haha…I have applied for it already. I came to tell you to do it too.”</p><p>“What? You didn’t wait for me?”</p><p>This was the most discussed topic amongst everyone within the palace after the news broke out.</p><p>Killing so many enemies…Of course it would come with rewards!</p><p>Amongst the two thousand warriors, there were one thousand and seven hundred Astral Reaching Realm warriors. When converted to contribution points, it would be worth eighty-five thousand points, which was rather impressive.</p><p>There were three hundred Sea of Souls Realm warriors, which would make for two hundred and fifty thousand points. Thirty-eight management executives would be worth one thousand one hundred and forty thousand points, and fifteen head management staffs made for seventy-five thousand points. Meanwhile, four deputy palace leader level warriors were worth forty thousand points.</p><p>With it all added up together, the contribution points reached a monstrous five hundred and sixty-four thousand points. As for the rationing of these points, the second-in-command would get twice as many points as the head management staff, who in turn would get twice as many as the battling managing executives, and so on.</p><p>Since most warriors were killed by Ye Chen and his warriors, therefore, all these points would be added onto their team, having nothing to do with Xu Danian.</p><p>Ye Chen only had two hundred something warriors left on his side, one hundred and fifty of them being Astral Reaching Realm warriors. There were twenty-eight normal Seas of Souls Realm warriors, twenty-four battle executives, seven head management warriors, and one second-in-command warrior. So, according to the ration, Astral Reaching Realm warriors would get about two hundred and thirty points while normal Sea of Souls Realm warriors would get four thousand and six hundred points. The battling executives would get nine thousand, and head warriors would get eighteen thousand points; Ye Chen would get the most, thirty-seven thousand points.</p><p>Without the others, just the points would make a lot of warriors jealous, since the contribution points would be the most valuable inside the palace. Without the battles, it was really hard to earn them. Only with battles would they earn more, which was how the palace used them to inspire people’s passion.</p><p>The ones gaining the most would definitely be the Astral Reaching Realm warriors of the palace. According to power, they should only get two hundred and thirty points. But, because of their disciple title, they would be listed as battling executives. Therefore, according to the ratio, they would get much more.</p><p>Moreover, the contribution points would not just be useable within the Azure Dragon Palace, but in the whole palace. Normally, these contribution points would only total around one thousand. But this time, they managed to earn about nine thousand within such a short while.</p><p>Of course, they had used their lives to fight for them. They were the disciples of the palace; with the title of martial geniuses, their lives were much more valuable than that of normal Astral Reaching Realm warriors. And this time, they had lost fellow warriors even with Ye Chen’s protection.</p><p>There were two groups of warriors who did not manage to get any contributing points.</p><p>The first group would be Xu Danian’s people, since they had only killed a couple of enemies, which did not matter that much. But, they got some reward nevertheless. Although it might not be as valuable as the contribution points, it was better than nothing. They were already happy that they could get back alive, and there was nothing more they could ask for at this point.</p><p>The second group would be the warriors that were killed. This time, there were seven hundred warriors in total, but only two hundred and seventy of them made it back alive. A total of four hundred and thirty warriors had been killed, which was a huge number.</p><p>They could not get any points or rewards because they were dead already. But, their families would get some special treatment from the palace. They would receive some important resources as well, increasing their chance of having more powerful warriors in the future.</p><p>Inside the palace, the normal mid rank great weapons were worth three hundred points, and the top mid rank ones would be worth five hundred; normal top rank ones would be worth four thousand points. As for the defensive items, they would cost more, usually about one and half times more than attacking weapons. A semi extreme rank attacking weapon would cost thirty thousand points while a defensive one would be worth forty-five thousand points.</p><p>What Ye Chen had could easily get him a semi extreme rank attacking weapon, but the amount was slightly lacking for a defensive one. Of course, if it were outside the palace, it would cost banks for one to obtain a right item or weapon, and a lot of warriors would spend everything they had to collect what they needed. But, inside the palace, they would just have to use the points.</p><p>Besides the weapons and items, warriors could also get pellets, jewelry, profound sense martial arts, secret arts, and spirit stones in exchange for contribution points.</p><p>Judging from this, the palace had a lot of weight on their shoulders indeed. Without enough resources, it would be easily dragged down. It would also be why the palace would be willing to fight against the top four parties and still not be willing to give up on any resources.</p><p>With thirty seven thousand points, Ye Chen did not think of exchanging for weapons, since he already had whatever he needed. Even if it were semi extreme rank plants, he still had plenty of those. But, he was very intrigued by the palace’s secret arts.</p><p>Xia Houzun had performed the Blood Emperor Void Shattering Finger Art before, carrying an extreme attacking power which Ye Chen had witnessed before. He surely would want to expand his martial art to work towards its peak.</p><p>After all, no one would think that they had learned too many martial arts.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
