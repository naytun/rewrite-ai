Normally, there were not a single person inside; but today, countless human shadows were seen inside and outside of the place. Amongst them, a young couple was walking shoulder to shoulder—the man was in blue and wearing a longsword while the woman was in purple dress, with a light veil on her face. It was indeed Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng who had left the West Ling Region a month ago. It was at that moment that Ye Chen said after letting out a small breath.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng glanced at him and said after closing her lips together, “I did not expect you to find this many ingredients in this short period of time. Three more to go…it should not need that much longer. Thank you!”</p><p>Her mother Su Ruhui’s Shadowless Poison had always been on her mind. In fact, if not for this distraction, she could have reached the Sea of Souls Realm even faster. After talking to Su Ruhui, she finally managed to focus onto the closed-up training and reach the realm two months after that.</p><p>She thought before that it would be hard for Ye Chen to find all of these ingredients by himself, but she did not know that he cared about it this much. When she first got here, he had already found all of them except five; and now, only three were left.</p><p>Ye Chen chuckled but did not say anything, changing the subject instead, “I did not expect there to be a small town here in the middle of nowhere. If it were not for the information from the pavilion, I would probably have missed these two ingredients.”</p><p>The town was actually could the Ruin Mountain Town, which was located right on the border of Sky Martial Region and South Region. There had not been a resident here for hundreds of years. Eventually, it turned into a secret auction yard, dealing with some items that should not be known of by the rest of the world. The time of the auction was also unpredictable. Sometimes, there would be one every other month, and at times, it would be quiet for years. Through the pavilion, Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng had learned that there was going to be an auction here, so they traveled hundreds of thousand of miles to arrive here.</p><p>On top of a tall building that was close to the town, a group of human shadows stood on top.</p><p>“You see? It was them. In that auction, that guy and spent one hundred thousand top rank soul stones without even blinking to buy two spirit plants. I think he must have more top rank stones than that.” The speaker lifted up a finger while pointing at Ye Chen.</p><p>“One hundred thousand top rank soul stones…” The others standing right next to him mumbled.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“It is one million top rank soul stones!”</p><p>“One million! That is too much! Perhaps he has already spent most of it.”</p><p>“I have been in the auction for so many years…Do you think I will make a mistake like this? Besides the Life and Death Realm warriors whom I have never seen, no matter how powerful others are, there would be clues for me to notice. According to their eyes and facial expression or some micro expressions, I can tell their whole fortune. For example, if you have got one hundred thousand top rank soul stones and spent ninety thousand in buying something, you would feel painful at some level. And, you would not even realize it before giving some minor gesture to comfort yourself.”</p><p>“That actually makes a lot of sense. You said that guy spent a couple hundred thousand top rank stones and still did not feel anything, which is why you guessed that he had got one million in total.”</p><p>“Indeed! It was a big deal after all.”</p><p>“I am just afraid that we cannot get him. The warriors who dare to come here would be powerful at some level. This guy must be one of the powerful martial geniuses from the Sky martial Region. Unfortunately, I have never seen him before to tell who he really is.”</p><p>“If you have never seen, then it means that he was not that famous. As long as he is not one of those top young warriors, we will have what it takes to get him. Even if he were someone rather famous, we would still have more than sixty percent chance of winning against him. Well, wealth is not that easy to get anyway. Plus, we still have three godly martial puppet cannons.”</p><p>“Damn it, let’s do it!”</p><p>It was not until this month when Ye Chen’s reputation had started to spread around the Sky Martial Region. And, the city was at the border of Sky Martial Region and the south regions; therefore, there were plenty of people who could not recognize him.</p><p>…</p><p>“We are about to get out of the fog.”</p><p>Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng did not fly in the air. A massive area of fog surrounded the town, and people could only walk out step by step. Once jump into the air and it would be very easy to get lost in the fog, which would be time-consuming. It was also why the town could be used as a secret auction yard.</p><p>“Watch out!” Ye Chen suddenly grabbed Murong Qingcheng’s hand as he pulled back suddenly.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A pile of bright red light landed onto the ground right in front of the two. All of a sudden, a massive hole appeared out of nowhere, which was more than hundreds of meters wide and fifty meters deep. The surface of the ground revealed was crystallized, and the mud had been burnt into crystals.</p><p>“Puppet cannon?”</p><p>Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng backed out at an extreme speed. They were only slightly affected by the attack, so they were okay. But, the power of the red light had made the two look a bit more serious. If it were not for backing out on time, they would have been badly wounded, or worse, killed.</p><p>“Damn! They managed to get away! Let’s fire up the cannon. I do not believe that they can get away from this.” Three miles away, a group of people spread out. In front of them were three massive puppet cannons with wheels. They were dark red, with accented patterns. On top of the cannon was a circle with a white crystal carved inside. Inside the crystal, human figures were running on top: they were indeed Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The puppet cannon exploded, and three bright red light shoot out. They were like three fiery shooting stars inside the fog, targeting right at the two a few miles away.</p><p>After avoiding the two beams of red light, the third one was impossible to escape from. So, Ye Chen took out his thunder disaster sword and waved it out, landing right at the middle of the red light.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>He performed his Gold Resonant Radiance attack, which separated the incoming red light into two beams. The weakened red light landed on the two sides, exploding into sky-high flames.</p><p>“Strange! Why are they aiming at us?” Ye Chen was curious, since this fog had the effect of canceling soul power. Even with his powerful soul power, he was able to shoot out only five miles tops, while most of the other Seas of Souls Realm warriors could only reach one mile. But in his detection, the people that were attacking them were three miles away, which meant that they were able to aim at them from three miles.</p><p>“Dark Sky Wall!”</p><p>With both of her hands creating black qi, Murong Qingcheng created a semi-circular blockage, protecting the two within.</p><p>“What? They disappeared!”</p><p>Inside the white crystal, Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng disappeared completely. It was something that had never happened before, since this white crystal was not a normal one. It was a kind of special crystal that could sense life. It was not originally carved into this cannon—they found it from some ruins and thought to combine it with the cannon, which turned out to be a great idea that helped them take out a lot of more powerful Seas of Souls Realm master level warriors.</p><p>“It must be some kind of secret art. Damn it! Let’s go!”</p><p>This group of people moved on as quickly as they made the decision, putting away the cannon and running into the distance.</p><p>“They are gone!”</p><p>The black blockage was lifted as there were no more red light attacking them. Ye Chen guessed that the dark profound had the effect of blocking out sensors, since his soul power had been decreased by eighty percent as well. It was only until Murong Qingcheng let go of her dark profound that he realized that there was no one there three miles away anymore.</p><p>“This dark profound of yours is quite powerful!” Ye Chen praised.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng said, “Unfortunately, it is only a defensive martial art.”</p><p>“But, being able to understand the dark profound can have a great deal of positive effects. In the future, I can rely on its special characteristics and create my own profound sense art in the future.”</p><p>Since the Sky Thunder Cut and Gold Resonant Radiance had made a breakthrough, they respectively reached one hundred and ten percent, and one hundred and thirty percent. Ye Chen was now already studying his new sword art.</p><p>Since the original level of Sky Thunder Cut and Gold Resonant Radiance was quite low, it was getting hard to merge both thunder and gold profound. In Ye Chen’s opinion, the sword arts were like containers while the profound sense was like water. Once the container got full, then it would reach completion. But, once the water started getting out, then it meant that the profound sense had reached beyond the sword attacks’ level. After all, there were mid-rank profound sword movements above low-rank ones as well.</p><p>…</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Ten miles away, the group of people who were attacking Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng had been blocked by a group of men in black, who were almost see-through like black smoke. Basically, they gave the feeling of having no tangible weight.</p><p>The leading man in black chuckled, “The puppet cannon is quite good. If you leave it, then I can avoid killing you guys.”</p><p>“Why the he…”</p><p>He was not able to finish the sentence before the leading man in black disappeared out of the blue, and after a couple of flashes, those group of people who were attacking Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng had fallen onto the ground with a massive bloody hole in their chests.</p><p>Putting away these people’s storage rings, the leading man in black opened every single one of them, and soon realized that there were three warrior puppet cannons.</p><p>“Not bad! These three cannons might be one of the top puppet works.”</p><p>The other man in black said, “I did not expect this mediocre bunch to have this level of puppet cannon. Such a good gain for us!”</p><p>“The puppet cannon is just a pleasant surprise. Go kill that young man named Ye Chen and take that girl. That is our mission!”</p><p>“That Ye Chen is not simple. No wonder he could take the right arm of Duan Lengya and piss off the Ice Pavilion enough for them to fish out two million top rank soul stones to hire us. This price would be worth killing ten normal Sea of Souls Realm master level warriors.”</p><p>“No, not just two million, it is actually three. Do not forget that whatever we get from him will be for us as well.”</p><p>“Second command, when should we do this?”</p><p>“No rush. Taking that girl would be simple. As for killing Ye Chen, I think it might be rather difficult. I do not want you guys to get injured just to finish this mission. It is not what we believe in our Ghost Shadow Pavilion. If we are going to do this, then we do it with one hundred percent confidence.”</p><p>“Hehe, we have not missed a target for ten years now. I feel sorry for that woman. Once we hand her over to the ice pavilion, it would be the end of her good days.”</p><p>“Ah well, nothing we can do about it since we are being paid. Plus, you all are not any great lads either. I do not think you guys can hold out as well.”</p><p>“Haha, second commend indeed knows us well.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
