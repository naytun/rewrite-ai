It was more like a nation than a tribe.</p><p>The Battle Halberd Tribe had more than one gathering grounds. Like the human race countries that had lots of cities, the tribe had been separated into dozens of small cities as well. In the middle of them all was the main city, called the Battle Halberd City.</p><p>The poison mountain that Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng were looking for was indeed right next to that.</p><p>Around the mountain were so many barbarians that there would have a row of arrow towers every one thousand meters and a massive fort every five thousand meters. There were even flying beasts raised by them flying around in the sky as well, giving people the feeling that there were no gaps to get in at all.</p><p>Not far away from the mountain, two black shadows could be spotted vaguely as they blended with the shadows around them.</p><p>“There are too many of them…There are more flying beasts in the sky as well. There might even be hidden traps that we do not know of.” Ye Chen frowned. Facing this kind of situation, it was almost impossible to get in without being detected, since he would not use his soul power to scan the place. Even if he could, he might not be able to enter the poison mountain within that second and not let anyone find out.</p><p>“Let’s go check out the other places.” Murong Qingcheng suggested.</p><p>After looking at different places, they found them to be just as secure as before. Some of the places were under even closer watch, which meant they were more important.</p><p>“We are not in a hurry for now. Let’s wait for the night first.”</p><p>At night, Ye Chen would perform his shadow profound to its peak while Murong Qingcheng would use her darkness profound. With the help of the dark night, it should not be a problem for them to enter the poison mountain.</p><p>…</p><p>The night had arrived, and a broken moon slowly rose up into the sky. Lotus-shaped clouds were covering the moon, turning the ground pitch black.</p><p>“Now!”</p><p>The second the darkness took over the land, Ye Chen moved his body as like a beam of shadow, shooting out closest to the ground without making a sound. Meanwhile, Murong Qingcheng waved her wings, her demon power infused perfectly with the night under the effect of her darkness profound; she was also moving without a sound.</p><p>Without alarming anyone, the two successfully made it through the extremely poisonous qi and entered the poison mountain.</p><p>It was a massive mountain that seemed endless. There were some poisonous beasts and demons, but there were not too many of them, and their ranking was not that high.</p><p>Deep in the night…</p><p>The two had finally found where the Skull Flowers were .</p><p>“So many Skull flowers!”</p><p>Inside that not-so-big yet not-so-small valley were countless Skull Flowers, such that it would be impossible to count them all. On top of them, all of those Skulls looked extra creepy.</p><p>“Three thousand eight hundred years!”</p><p>“Four thousand five hundred!”</p><p>“Four thousand nine hundred!”</p><p>“Five thousand five hundred!”</p><p>“There are indeed more than five thousand years old Skull flowers.” Ye Chen scanned the area with his eyes and immediately spotted the relatively bigger ones. Those flowers leaked out a black qi which seemed like spilled ink.</p><p>“I found a six thousand years old Skull flower here as well.” Murong Qingcheng passed on a message via Zhen yuan.</p><p>Ye Chen replied, “Take some more just in case.”</p><p>Pop!</p><p>The two did not have time to pick too many flowers when some of the surreal Skulls suddenly disappeared. It turned out that those Skulls were made of poisonous qi, and the Skulls were exactly where they were stored. Now that some of the oldest Skull flowers had been picked, they started to change immediately.</p><p>On top of a tall mountain far away, a beast that had an extreme sight had spotted the change within the valley. It started to roar, its voice sounding very powerful.</p><p>“Not good! Let’s go!”</p><p>Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng rushed out of the valley, shooting out while using their shadow and darkness profounds to hide their scent.</p><p>“Who is there?”</p><p>There were buildings inside the poison mountain, from which, a huge number of barbarians rushed out. The leading man were peak level Late Sea of Souls Realm warrior who seemed to have an extra powerful Zhen yuan vibration. Soon, that soul power started to scan the area where Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng were present.</p><p>It was obvious that although Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng had very powerful profound sense martial arts, they could still not escape from the detection of a peak level Late Sea of Souls Realm warrior, and were spotted by him almost immediately.</p><p>“Some humans have breached through! Get them immediately.”</p><p>The poison mountain was only hundred miles wide, and was more than enough for growing poisonous plants. But, Sea of Souls Realm powerful warriors could cover more than that area with the most causal detection. Right then, the barbarians used their soul power to send out messages to every other one.</p><p>“Damn! Humans dared to come to our poison mountain?”</p><p>All of the Sea of Souls Realm savage people outside were furious as they rushed to the pointed place, trying to blocking out the road in front of Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>Whoo!</p><p>Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng had made it out of the poisonous mist, but what awaited them were actually countless shining sharp arrows or spear lights that were dense to the point of seeming solid.</p><p>“Darkness Sky!”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng lifted up the black barrier, protecting themselves from those sharp arrows and spear lights.</p><p>“Fly to higher grounds!”</p><p>Ye Chen held Murong Qingcheng’s hand, flying for the higher clouds above the poison mountain. They were fast like beams of light, leaving light marks under the moonlight.</p><p>“Huh!”</p><p>All of those Seas of Souls Realm barbarians would not let them leave like this for sure, as they hurried to push their Zhen yuan and follow behind.</p><p>Slowly, most of the weaker ones had fallen behind and had to give up on chasing, leaving only one with a rather powerful cultivation. It was an extremely powerful one; although he was at peak level Late Sea of Souls Realm, his Zhen yuan did not seem to end at all. It was also way more powerful than a normal warrior’s. He seemed to be accumulating Zhen yuan for reaching the Life and Death Realm.</p><p>“Savage King Major Hand Print!”</p><p>This barbarian saw that he could not catch up with Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng anymore, so he pressed down his fan like massive palms onto the ground. A rich powerful surreal hand print appeared out of nowhere, shooting toward the two. All of a sudden, the peace in the nature seemed to be disturbed as a vibration spread out in the air like water.</p><p>“So powerful! I am afraid that he is not that far from the demi Barbarian King state.”</p><p>Life and Death Realm was not that easy to reach, and countless people had been stuck right at its door. But, some warriors with extremely strong endurance and power might become demi king warrior after decades or even centuries of training. Although it was not as powerful a state as the Life and Death Realm, it would be way more powerful than Sea of Souls Realm. For example, the leader of the ape race in the south shallow sea, Sun Tai, was indeed a demi beast king who had a power that was impossible to predict.</p><p>Ye Chen currently could still not compete with the demi Barbarian king yet, neither could he compete with the top five young warriors.</p><p>“Thunder Devour!”</p><p>He turned around suddenly and crossed his swords, making the thunder ball land onto that surreal hand palm.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The blast wave spread out into the sky as Ye Chen was blown away. But with that, his speed had doubled, He grabbed onto Murong Qingcheng immediately, taking her riding onto that counter blast power, leaving the people behind them far, far away.</p><p>“Tricky humans!” An angry expression flashed across this barbarian’s face.</p><p>“Savage King Roar!”</p><p>He was like a massive whale absorbing all of the air thousand meters around him. His eyes then popped out as he opened his mouth to let out a shockingly powerful sound wave, which was similar to the Life and Death Realm Zhen yuan. The second he let it out, the sky became bright white.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>In the next second, that apocalyptic sound spread out at 100 times the speed of normal sound, covering Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>Pooh!</p><p>Both of them puked out blood; the sound wave was like a vibrating machine with high frequency, forcing their bodies to handle thousand times stronger vibration. If it were not for the fact that Ye Chen had trained rank 3 spirit body as well as his dragon power, and the fact Murong Qingcheng had rank 2 demon body, this roar would have wounded them drastically and left them with no power to fight back.</p><p>At the same time, that high frequency vibration had stopped their Zhen yuan from moving, and their speed decreased drastically as well. They seemed about to be caught up at any second.</p><p>“Dream Wolf, come out here.” Ye Chen was about to call out his wolf to battle with that barbarian. As long as his opponent’s will power did not reach rank 5, the wolf would be able to enter his dream world and help him get the upper hand. Plus, besides his current power and his wolf, he still had a massively powerful ace attack which he did not plan on using unless it was a life or death situation.</p><p>“Ye Chen, I have a way.” Murong Qingcheng grabbed Ye Chen’s hand over his tag.</p><p>“You do?” Ye Chen looked over at her with a questioning look in his eyes.</p><p>“Yeah!” She nodded before grabbing Ye Chen’s palm to hold it tightly.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The black bat wings started to wave intensively behind her back. Meanwhile, a surprisingly powerful demon power spread out, pushing out all of the air within the area. That kind of demon power was more potent than any level of Sea of Souls Realm demon power, almost at the Life and Death Realm level.</p><p>“Demon power essence!”</p><p>Ye Chen seemed to understand something. This demon power vibration belonged to that demon king in the battlefield. It seemed like Murong Qingcheng had not fully trained it all yet, only a part of it. But, it was reasonable after all, since that demon king was extremely powerful. With Murong Qingcheng’s cultivation now, she would not be able to fully cultivate it.</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>That barbarian who was not far away from them anymore looked shocked at what he had just seen. He could sense a threat from this vibration.</p><p>“Huh! Something is going one. But it will not scare me.” The barbarian reached out his massive palm and performed his martial art once again.</p><p>This time, his attack missed its target since Murong Qingcheng and Ye Chen disappeared all of a sudden from where they were standing.</p><p>“How could this be? Their speed has reached the maximum level that the space can tolerate!”</p><p>He had his eyes wide open, as he could not believe what just happened.</p><p>The space in this world had its limits. Once the speed reached a certain level, it would be impossible to increase it. Of course, it would not be impossible to increase the speed, since one would move into the surreal space beyond the limit, where the speed would be be unrestrained. It was also why the Life and Death Realm king warriors would travel in surreal space even though it was not their intent.</p><p>“Ah well, there wasn’t anything much valuable in that poison mountain after all. It was just the poisonous plants. Even if we lost some of the important poisonous plants, it would not hurt us.”</p><p>Shaking his head, that barbarian flew back from where he came from.</p><p>Five hundred miles away…</p><p>A huge amount of black light flooded out as Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng jumped out. The latter’s face was very pale. With her power now, she could still not control her demon essence that well. Even though she had just used a tiny bit of it, it came with a great cost.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
