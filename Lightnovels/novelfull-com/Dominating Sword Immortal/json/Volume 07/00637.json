Xia Houzun</p><p><strong>Translator:</strong> EndlessFantasy Translation <strong>Editor:</strong> EndlessFantasy Translation</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The space pattern was forming at such a fast speed that Murong Qingcheng did not have the time to react, her back crashed on top of it. Her face went pale instantly, puking out a huge chunk of blood.</p><p>“I must use my demon power essence now!”</p><p>A hint of gold light appeared in her pupils as a huge amount of black light appeared around her body. The black light looked like it was made of crystalline strings which were extremely strong. The unbreakable space barrier was crushed by the black light before being broken open like a massive mirror.</p><p>“What!”</p><p>Xia Houzun’s expression froze a little. This black light was horrifyingly pure and dense. It would be impossible for a Sea of Souls Realm warrior to have this level of power; even if it were a half-step king warrior, he would be slightly lacking as well. However, it was obvious that Murong Qingcheng had only learned the entry level of it, and she could not fully control this highly dense power, which caused a slight leakage on the side. It lowered her power a little; otherwise, the space barrier would not just explode, but actually just disappear into nothingness.</p><p>“Who is she?”</p><p>Watching Murong Qingcheng leave the room and enter the tunnel, Xia Houzun thought to himself.</p><p>“I could only use the demon power essence to increase my speed. If I used it to increase my attack, although it would definitely threaten him, it would only mess him up a bit in the end, and I would not be able to make it out after all.” Murong Qingcheng had thought about using her essence to attack him, but it would obviously not work. It would be hard to severely wound him as well. If it were Lin Tian or people at that level, then she would have one hundred percent confidence to win against them, since she could only control it for a brief second. Even just a second after that would be dangerous for her. And, she would have to wait a couple of moments before using it again. At her peak condition, she could only use it three times.</p><p>Of course, using it to increase her speed, she was confident that even Yan Fengfeng would not be able to catch up with her within that one second.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>Traveling like a beam of black lightning, her body turned around drastically in the air, shooting out toward the tunnel on her left. She was traveling at such a fast speed that she managed to leave a surreal form of her where she was staying before for a brief moment.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Inside the room, a huge area of gold light exploded as if a huge sun had appeared out of nowhere in this room. Xia Houzun’s speed had been increased to its peak as he also shot out of the room. Meanwhile, he pointed out his right index finger three times in a row at the walls in front of him.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The walls were punctured through mostly, leaving only a very thin layer.</p><p>“Draw Attack!”</p><p>Forming a circle space barrier, he roared as he punctured through the walls and came to the other side.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>She turned around and just made it past that area. She could already feel the powerful wind roaring behind her, the little rocks suspending in the air, and Xia Houzun’s body approaching.</p><p>“Increase the speed!”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng accumulated her demon power essence again, increasing her speed by six times. With this kind of speed, even Yan Fengfeng would not be able to do anything. The only downside of it was that there was no enough space around them, and the advantage of speed could not be optimized to its best. She would have to make a turn every time she encountered a hard corner, which decreased her speed even though she tried not to. Meanwhile, breaking through the walls would be impossible for her, since it would almost be giving Xia Houzun the time to catch up with her. After all, he could then very well just go through the hole that she created for herself. Plus, this was already her second time using the demon essence.</p><p>However, even so, she still managed to stay ahead for more than a thousand meters. And it was still because of the tough geographic reasons; otherwise, if they were in the sky, she could make the gap between them to even seventy miles. After all, even those half-step king level barbarians could not do much to her.</p><p>“Huh! In this tunnel, the faster the speed, the more restriction you will face. It would be impossible to fly at this speed forever. I will see how many times you can actually use this power of yours.”</p><p>Xia Houzun could no longer sense her, but he was not in a hurry. As he flew around, he shot out beams of soul power. Meanwhile, a couple of his puppet snakes were traveling around different corners as well, watching the area.</p><p>“Got you!”</p><p>Through a puppet snake, Xia Houzun had found her.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>She had also noticed the snake, throwing out a finger attack and shattering it. But, it was not until she traveled far before she encountered another one of those.</p><p>“He has got this many puppet snakes!” She had a bad look on her face.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>One wall was punctured through and Xia Houzun walked over, taking the short cut and shortening the distance by a couple of times. Inside these maze-like tunnels, cuts allowed him to find Murong Qingcheng faster. Even if she had way faster speed, it would not make that big of a difference, which was indeed the convenience of having a high attacking power. He could tell that she could not use that power of hers for a long time; otherwise, he could not make it this close at all.</p><p>Her demon power essence had already burned out, and she was only traveling at her own normal speed at this point. Her own speed was still slightly faster than Xia Houzun’s, but the latter was not trying to compete with her in speed at all. After breaking down walls after walls, he was getting way closer.</p><p>“I only have one more usage out of my demon power essence.”</p><p>Her pretty eyebrows had been tied into a knot right now. Suddenly, she thought of something. She took out a jade tag from her storage ring before pouring in her demon power.</p><p>…</p><p>“It looks like Beiming Hui has not prepared to fight with me again. He chose to leave directly after encountering me. Perhaps he was afraid that I might just kill him?”</p><p>Ye Chen found it a bit funny how he had just run into Beiming Hui just now and found him actually being a bit scared of him. He thought that he might be scared of the former killing him, since there were a lot of people when they were battling. But inside the palace, even if he had kill Beiming Hui, no one would really know.</p><p>Ye Chen moved on at a not-so-fast-not-so-slow speed as he released out his soul power. Nothing within five hundred meters’ radius could get away from his eyes.</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>At that moment, his expression changed drastically. He took out a jade tag from his storage ring and an arrow appeared, moving in a mysterious way.</p><p>“It is Murong!”</p><p>Ye Chen did not realize it himself, but he increased his speed and started moving toward where the arrow was pointing as he thought to himself, ‘This is a one-time item, so she would not have used it if it were not necessary. Is she in some kind of danger right now? No, she is moving at such a high speed. Is someone hunting her right now?’</p><p>Thinking about the key point, five beams of sword light appeared outside Ye Chen’s body and carried his body, traveling at an extreme speed through the tunnels.</p><p>Because of his powerful soul power, he always managed to make a smart turn to maintain his speed each time he encountered a hard corner. Even a person with the same speed as his would not be able to catch up with him in this maze.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>Sword light bounced around inside the tunnels, and Ye Chen’s smoothness could scare off anyone who was watching, because he knew exactly when to slow down and when to speed up.</p><p>…</p><p>“You cannot escape from me!” Xia Houzun’s voice was heard through a puppet snake.</p><p>She sneered gently as she threw out a finger power to shatter the snake. She had crushed at least a dozen of those, but had no idea where one could get this many puppet snakes.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The walls that were not that far behind had been punctured through as Xia Houzun in gold robes appeared with a powerful aura.</p><p>“Even if you could outrun me now, do you think you could be on the run for the rest of your life? There are no exits in this palace. Only at the second when the palace disappears can you be transported out.”</p><p>Xia Houzun could finally sense her body, as there were only two walls in between them. One of them was already in front of him.</p><p>“Void Shattering Finger!”</p><p>The gold tower like massive finger punctured through one-third of the wall, and then both of his hands reached out one after another. Two beams of comet finger power landed at the same point on the wall.</p><p>In the next second, he appeared on the other side of the wall through the smoke he brought up.</p><p>“Do I really have to use my last chance of my demon power essence?” A hesitation appeared on her face. “No, even if I use it, I would not be able to escape from his detection. So, it would just be a completely waste. I might as well use it to fight back.”</p><p>With her mind made up, she stopped moving, her body floating in the air. Those massive black bat wings had been expanded to the maximum.</p><p>“She is not moving…”</p><p>He had an instinct of something bad happening or would happen. He secretly performed his draw attack, protecting his body inside his space barrier before throwing out four comet finger powers in a row to puncture through the walls. The second the walls had been breached, that horrifying black light poured in.</p><p>“Sky Demon Finger attack!”</p><p>The finger attack this time was not the normal kind that she always used—it was the Sky Demon Finger Attack containing her demon power essence. A fist-sized black light ball shot out, following the edge of the hole as it appeared right in front of Xia Houzun. That intense demon power vibration had made his pupils shrink to the maximum.</p><p>“You are looking for death!”</p><p>He roared as he reached out his left index finger, pointing out another Void Shattering Finger attack. Meanwhile, he backed out immediately, using a top rank shield to block in front of him.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>That massive black light exploded in the air, inside which, the gold string of light filled up the whole space. All of the walls and tunnels around had been cracked open under this wave of blasting power, some of which were more than half a meter deep. With a little bit of more power, the walls would be cracked open completely. However, in the center of the explosion, a ten meters wide and one meter deep hole had been created. Given the fact that the walls and ground inside the palace were extremely tough, normal attacks would barely leave a mark on them. Only top warriors like Ye Chen or the top five young warriors could make this level of an impact. But somehow, Murong Qingcheng managed it.</p><p>Pooh!</p><p>The top rank shield in his hand had been twisted drastically as Xia Houzun puked out a huge chunk of blood while his whole body crashed into that wall not too far away. The wall shook a little, bringing up another wave of dust in the air.</p><p>“You are really looking for death!”</p><p>He was both shocked and furious. He could not believe that someone could twist a top rank shield like this and manage to shatter his draw attack at the same time. He had even used his Void Shattering Finger attack to cancel out the attack as well.</p><p>Seeing that Murong Qingcheng had puked out more blood than him and her face was looking pale like paper, it would be impossible for him not to realize that she had already burned out all of her battling power.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>Gold light flashed once before their eyes as Ye Chen appeared in the tunnel that Murong Qingcheng was in.</p><p>“I was just trying to get those gloves. But now, I do not think like that anymore.” A horrifying look flashed though Xia Houzun’s face. She had wounded him, which was something he could never forgive. God knows how long it had been since he lost to Bai Wuxue.</p><p>Boom! Boom!</p><p>It was right then that the tunnels right next to the two suddenly shook twice. They were already full of cracks, and that crazy sword intent ignored the walls and filtered through. The air was filled with the killing intent from both sides.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Another quake took place and the cracks on the walls seemed like nets, twisting as it spread out in the whole area.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
