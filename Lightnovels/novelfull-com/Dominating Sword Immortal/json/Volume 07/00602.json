Standing high in the air and holding the Gold Sword, he stared at the cold-looking youngster with the red mole on his forehead and said indifferently, \"Calamity, huh? First time coming face-to-face, and you're able to deem me a calamity. Seems like you really like to run your mouth off.\"</p><p>\"A battle of exchanging pointers should only go so far. But you cut off his arm! That's too cruel, too sinister! If everybody were like you, there wouldn't be a day of peace in Sky Martial Region.\" The mole on the guy's forehead seemed to be somewhat throbbing; he had a slightly round face which wore a cold look right now.</p><p>\"Haha!\" Ye Chen couldn't help but laugh, \"If it were me who lost an arm, would you still have said these words, or turned a blind eye to it?\"</p><p>The round-faced youngster said. \"If you lost an arm, we would have lectured him. Although I am familiar with his character, if he acted against you, he must have had his reasons. Alright, now be obedient and hand yourself over, and I'll spare your dog life. Against us, you have no chance. Don't try to resist, as it will only make your death much faster.\"</p><p>\"Lecture him?\" Ye Chen shook his head with a laugh before his gaze turned cold, \"You see, you two aren't enough to preach fairness to me. You two are nothing more than two filthy dogs. Get lost, or you'll have your dog skins peeled off.\"</p><p>Hearing these words, everybody couldn't help but suck in a breath of cold air. They had never seen someone daring to speak to Mu Yunhe and Lin Tian in this manner. It should be known that the two of them were considered young experts just under the five big tyrants. They were far above the likes of Duan Lengya and Lin Ku.</p><p>Ye Chen, of course, knew the identities of these two. The two had the same strength more or less, and were much more powerful than Taishi Chong, who was one of three great young Sword Masters. Before his breakthrough, Ye Chen was absolutely not their opponent; perhaps only Yan Fengfeng would be their opponent. Unfortunately, she rarely appeared in the outside world for some reason.</p><p>\"What did you say?\"</p><p>The round-faced youngsters face turned ashen. Apparently, he couldn't believe that Ye Chen could say these words. Who was he? He was a senior disciple of Prison Sect, one of the nine great sects under the heavens. Under the five young tyrants, he had a peak battle power. Nobody could defeat him, and could at most match him. Ye Chen was merely a newly emerged name who had managed to defeat Duan Lengya and Lin Ku through some fortuitous encounter.</p><p>\"Do you dare to say that again?\" Mu Yunhe's eyes were spouting flames. Lin Tian's face also turned cold, and his killing intent shot through the sky.</p><p>\"I said that you two are filthy dogs.\" Ye Chen's voice was loud enough, covering more than half of the district.</p><p>\"This guy is simply going against the heavens.\" At the sidelines, Lin Ku's eyes were wide open, whereas Duan Lengya had long since passed out.</p><p>ChapterMid();</p><p>\"Courting Death!\" Mu Yunhe snarled as Zhen Yuan erupted behind his body, condensing into mounds of red clouds. His body moved through the red clouds like an ominous crane. His five fingers spread out, as if ready to crush Ye Chen's skull.</p><p>This move had no profoundness to it. It was merely quick, like a predator bird going for the kill. How fast was it? It was more than ten times faster than the fastest bird. Moreover, the tips of his fingers exuded a blood-colored light, ripping through the air.</p><p>\"Pipe down!\" Raising the Gold Sword, Ye Chen simply slashed down.</p><p>\"Look how I snatch your sword!\"</p><p>Mu Yunhe didn't expect that Ye Chen would react so quickly. He also hadn't made any back-up plan. With a swing of his arm, he was going to snatch the sword in Ye Chen's hands. Unfortunately, the latter's reactions turned out to be too quick, leaving him with no other option but to change his claw into fist and send out a fist energy.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>A huge explosion rang out as if two meteorites had smashed into each other. The sky above the entire district turned upside down, and the space itself seemed to be collapsing.</p><p>\"It's Mu Yunhe!\"</p><p>To everybody's astonishment, it was Mu Yunhe who sustained injuries, going down from Ye Chen's slash.</p><p>\"What's happening? Did he end up underestimating his enemy too much?\"</p><p>\"Even if he underestimated Ye Chen too much, he shouldn't have ended up so badly, should he?\"</p><p>\"Look, Ye Chen hasn't moved at all!\"</p><p>Not only the spectators, even Lin Ku was also stunned. He couldn't help but take a step back. Meanwhile, Lin Tian 's eyes constricted; his eyes were filled with killing intent, but also apprehension.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>Mu Yunhe staggeringly landed on the street, stumbling backward. Every step caused the street's surface to erupt, toppling the nearby buildings.</p><p>\"Impossible! What kind of bizarre power is this?\" Mu Yunhe's chin was dyed red as he unblinkingly stared Ye Chen who was high in the air.</p><p>\"Mu Yunhe is not Ye Chen's opponent at all.\" Although Murong QIngcheng hadn't been to Sky Martial Region before, she knew the top geniuses here; for example, the five young tyrants, three great sword artists, and so on. This Mu Yunhe was second only to the five young tyrants, and could easily be ranked in the top fifteen. Those comparable to him could be counted on two hands, and those who could injure him in one move were only the five young tyrants.</p><p>\"Mu Yunhe, you now know your place. You can get lost from here.\"</p><p>Mu Yunhe had approached Ye Chen on his own initiative. Ye Chen's ability to fight in close range could only be said heaven-defying. His body contained a strength of four hundred thousand pounds. Adding the Zhen Yuan, his power at close range was more frightening than the Dual Sword Style for long range.</p><p>\"You're just a bit stronger at close range. I won't fight you at that range. Let's see how you can resist my attacks then.\" Mu Yunhe snarled and leaped up. His fingers crooked into claws and swatted repeatedly, sending out blood-red palm imprints.</p><p>\"Break!\"</p><p>Holding the Gold Sword with both hands, Ye Chen slashed down. With that, an elongated sawtoothed sword light rushed through, thoroughly clearing out the palm imprints. However, Mu Yunhe was not Lin Ku or Duan Lengya. His cultivation base had already reached the late Sea of Soul realm, allowing his Zhen Yuan to be exceptionally rich. He kept sending out palm imprints, which slowly whittled down the might and speed of the sawtoothed sword light.</p><p>\"Splitting Yuan Hand!\"</p><p>Mu Yunhe's figure flickered and appeared far into air. His fingers opened up, pressing obliquely down toward Ye Chen.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The space caved in like mud, and in the next moment, a scarlet-red palm descended down. Blood rays spread out, and in an instant, the scarlet palm expanded several folds to cover the sky, wishing to pulverize Ye Chen into a paste.</p><p>\"This guy's will and profound sense are more or less the same as Duan Lengya and Lin Ku, but his Zhen Yuan is stronger by a minor realm. Thus, his battle power is much higher.\"</p><p>\"But, since you don't want to battle close-range, how can your attacks defeat me? Anything you send my way, I can destroy it with my body.\"</p><p>Kacha!</p><p>When the blood-red palm arrived ten meters before Ye Chen, his hands erupted with power, and he slashed the Gold Sword upwards. With a tearing sound, a huge hole appeared in the palm as Ye Chen flew through it in a flash, arriving above it while the palm behind him vanished without a trace.</p><p>\"My Splitting Yuan Hand was just broken like that?\" Mu Yunhe was stupefied momentarily, \"Impossible! Although body-refiners are strong, they don't have such insight and perception. Moreover, my Splitting Yuan Hand contains an oppressive force. One could only exhibit eighty percent of their strength at most in the face of it.\"</p><p>\"It should be my turn now.\"</p><p>Five sword light beams appeared as Ye Chen's figure flickered. His speed had already attained a realm which made Mu Yunhe's movements seem clumsy. In an instant, he reached thirty times the speed of sound.</p><p>Ye Chen's speed had already reached twenty-five times the speed of sound when his cultivation base was at the peak of early Sea of Soul realm. Now that it had reached the peak of mid Sea of Soul realm, his Zhen Yuan's overall amount and purity had improved to another level. Thus, his speed had also augmented a lot.</p><p>In a flash, Ye Chen arrived beside Mu Yunhe.</p><p>\"No!\"</p><p>The latter's reaction was not slow as he subconsciously raised his hand to block.</p><p>\"Fly for me!\"</p><p>But, how could he have expected that Ye Chen wouldn't use the sword in his right hand? Instead, the latter grabbed the sword at his waist with his left hand and slashed upwards. With that, a sword energy carrying the crackling lightning swirled in.</p><p>Clatter!</p><p>As if struck by a lightning bolt, Mu Yunhe's figure shot back while spurting out a huge mouthful of blood.</p><p>Couldn't withstand one strike!</p><p>The numerous spectators underneath couldn't imagine that the renowned Mu Yunhe wouldn't be able to endure even one strike from Ye Chen. When Ye Chen was passive, it all seemed fine. However, when Ye Chen took the initiative to strike, the former didn't even have the power to retaliate, and could only be beaten miserably.</p><p>\"Enough!\"</p><p>Lin Tian, who had simply been biding his time without doing anything, couldn't watch anymore. His movements became unclear as his whole body seemed to have turned into a treasured blade which shot up through the sky.</p><p>He slashed out, sending out an earthen-yellow blade light that charged at Ye Chen like a torrential river.</p><p>Ye Chen gave up on Mu Yunhe and cleaved apart the earthen-yellow sword light.</p><p>\"I admit that your strength is pretty good, but you shouldn't be too arrogant.\" Lin Tian stared at Ye Chen gloomily while the latter sized his opponent. He could tell that the former also had a cultivation base at the peak of mid Sea of Soul realm. However, the essence Qi of his body was like a smoke signal shooting into the sky. This was a sign that his strength was exceptional, \"You're also a body-refiner.\"</p><p>\"Have a try, and you'll know.\" Lin Tian continued to stare coldly.</p><p>\"Brother Lin, beat him into a cripple for me.\" Mu Yunhe's clothes were tattered, and his chest was charred black; he was forcefully suppressing heavy injuries. As he flew down, he transmitted his message to Lin Tian. Lin Tian and Mu Yunhe were different; the former had been cultivating body refining techniques from a young age, and was quite talented at it. Thus, he primarily focused on strength, while Zhen Yuan was supplementary. Of course, Lin family was one of the four great clans under the heavens. Spending huge amounts on resources, they were able to bring his cultivation base to the mid Sea of Soul realm. With the combination of these two factors, Mu Yunhe had to admit that he could barely win if he were to put distance between the two. However, he was no match in close combat.</p><p>Yet, as he thought about Ye Chen, he couldn't help but shudder. Whether the latter specialized in Zhen Yuan or strength, he couldn't make head or tail of it. It was simply breaking the balance of nature.</p><p>\"Don't worry! I don't fear anybody when it comes to close combat.\"</p><p>\"Good, then I'll wait for the good news.\" Mu Yunhe clenched his fists as he headed downward. Suddenly, he turned toward Murong Qingcheng, revealing a sneer.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
