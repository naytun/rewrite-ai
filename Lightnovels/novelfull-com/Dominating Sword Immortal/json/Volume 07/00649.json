Surrounding him was a gentle sword wind which was almost impossible to track.</p><p>The flying sword had been affected by the sword wind. Sparks continued to be brought up as each wave of the sword wind was like an attack.</p><p>Dang! Ye Chen’s sword speed reached beyond the flying sword’s attacking speed and landed suddenly on its weakest spot, blowing it away instantly.</p><p>Right then, the Spiritual Sword had reached a whole new realm which could not be compared with its state half a year ago.</p><p>The sword was connected with Situ Hao’s mind, after it was blown away, Situ Hao’s face went pale a bit while horror manifested on his face.</p><p>Whoo!</p><p>After using one sword attack to flick away the longsword, Ye Chen maintained his position as he waved his right arm. That gold sword shot out into the distance, and the gentle sword wind suddenly became intense and aggressive.</p><p>Pop!</p><p>Chin!</p><p>Situ Hao’s defensive Zhen yuan was shattered immediately while the shield he was wearing looked like it was caught on fire, bringing up endless sparks. His whole body looked like it had been struck by thunder, bleeding out from everywhere. Although the spiritual sword looked gentle, it did not mean that the power it contained was gentle as well. That sword attack contained an extremely intense but well-hidden power, as well as a shocking destructive power. That dense sword power still managed to make it into Situ Hao’s body even with the defensive shield there to cancel out most of it.</p><p>Wuaa!</p><p>The sword power continued to do damage inside Situ Hao’s body and he could not hold it anymore, puking out some blood. His face could not be paler.</p><p>“You have wasted the defensive sword spell.”</p><p>Ye Chen was quite intrigued by the spell. It looked like it would need four elements working together to achieve perfection—Zhen yuan, profound sense, sword intent, and soul power. Zhen yuan would be able to ensure a basic attacking power, and the profound could improve the attacking power, same as the sword intent. At the same time, the soul power would be the most important part. The more powerful the soul power, the faster it could attack out in a more controlled way. It would even be an advantage in a situation that was not looking too good.</p><p>For example, if it were Ye Chen who was controlling the flying sword, even being blown away would not have affected his control over the sword.</p><p>But of course, if it were Ye Chen who was controlling the sword, then it would be way more horrifying, since his soul power was five times more powerful than normal warriors’. Although the sword speed might not be able to increase by five times as well, it should be perfectly fine to increase it by two times or even more.</p><p>Increasing the flying sword’s speed by two times would be the speed that even Ye Chen could not escape, and would just have to block out with all his power. This martial art in Ye Chen’s hand would be way much more menacing, and the attacking power would just be deadly.</p><p>“Even faster than my flying sword?”</p><p>After fully realizing what had just happened, Situ Hao was shocked already when he heard what Ye Chen had commented, and the look on his face somehow worsened.</p><p>Ye Chen chuckled, “Defensive sword spell has a very high requirement on soul power, but yours looks very normal. Indeed, the spell could increase your power, but is very limited. Wait until you figure out more powerful profound sense martial arts. Then, the defensive sword spell would not be your only ace attack. I think you see it as well that it is not giving you that much of an advantage.”</p><p>Ye Chen was not the only one with talent in soul power; a small number of people in this world were also gifted. But of course, they were not as good as Ye Chen. In fact, people with a high comprehensive ability could normally have very high soul talent.</p><p>Of course, it did not exclude some of the normal warriors with normal talent, but high comprehensive ability.</p><p>“So what?”</p><p>Situ Hao knew that Ye Chen was telling the truth, that the defensive sword spell was harsh on soul power. But, the growth of soul power was way too difficult; it might improve only when reaching a new realm. With each day of not reaching the Life and Death Realm, the value of his defensive sword spell was decreasing. Once he reached the Life and Death Realm, although the defensive sword spell would improve again, but its value would decrease again as time went on.</p><p>“How about we make a trade? I have enough of what you need, but I can trade it with your defensive sword spell? How about that?” Ye Chen had no problems with Situ Hao. The battle inside the treasure tower was just a common thing one did when there was a valuable item involved. No one would give that up in that situation.</p><p>Situ Hao sneered. He made a thought and that sword far away flew over, “Semi rank defensive shield? I will have a chance to get that. Semi extreme rank attacking weapon? I am not lacking that. Some soul plants? I would not care for them either. Besides those, what else can you offer me? Do you really think I will exchange my defensive sword spell with just those words of yours?”</p><p>“I do not have great items. And, I do not think you could care about normal spiritual plants. But, I could tell that the wood profound comprises a big part of your martial art. How about this? I will trade my spiritual sword spell with your defensive sword spell, plus four dragon blood plants?”</p><p>Ye Chen decided that as long as it did not reach beyond his bottom-line, he would give out anything for that defensive sword spell. As for robbing him for that, he did not even think about it. After all right now, everyone in the world knew that the other had the long lost sword spell. Even if he had extras in his storage rings, it would not make sense for Ye Chen to rob them, since he was not ready to take on any king level warrior behind Situ Hao. It would be a very stupid idea.</p><p>“Four dragon blood plants?”</p><p>Situ Hao was shocked. The Dragon Blood Plants were spirit plants that were known to increase physical strength. One of them could increase a hundred thousand pounds worth of power. During a close-up battle, it would definitely give him more advantage. With four of them, it would mean a completely different thing, turning him into a body training top warrior.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Situ Hao was a bit torn as he said with a low voice, “This Spiritual Sword is that sword attack you just performed?”</p><p>“Indeed!” Ye Chen nodded.</p><p>“The Spiritual Sword contains the profound of wood. What else does it contain?” Situ Hao did not think of the profound of fast at all. He thought it was because of other reasons that the sword ended up being that fast, since all the profounds in the world was connected one way or another. A lot of things would be unpredictable after different profounds were combined.</p><p>“The ultimate meaning of fast!” Ye Chen did not try to hide at all.</p><p>Situ Hao’s pupil shrank, and his heart started to beat aggressively. As a sword artist, no one would not want their sword speed to be faster. And this profound of fast would be the one purely capable of achieving that. It would be the easiest one to combine with other profounds, since most of the other ones all contained a little bit of it as well, if not the profound of slow.</p><p>“Give me another three of those plants and then I will say yes.”</p><p>Although Situ Hao did not really like Ye Chen, but in facing enough benefits, the dislike would just be a minor misunderstanding. The power of that spiritual sword was something he already knew by now. It was even faster than his defensive sword spell. But of course, he did not think about whether he could train it to Ye Chen’s level. As long as he could have eighty percent of that power, he would be able to have a much higher attacking power without using his defensive sword spell. Mostly importantly, he could learn the profound of fast from it, and use it to explore other options on his own. Otherwise, if he would have to learn the fast profound on his own, then it might never ever happen.</p><p>Without a doubt, it would be way much easier to try to learn other people’s profound sense martial art. As for how much exactly he could learn, that would all be up to him.</p><p>Plus, if he exchanged out his defensive sword spell, it only meant that there would be one more person training it. He could still use it anytime he wanted. In other words, he would not be losing anything.</p><p>Ye Chen shook his head, “I do not have that many Dragon Blood Plants. I will give you one more.”</p><p>“Two!” Situ Hao was firm.</p><p>“Alright, deal!”</p><p>Ye Chen did not hesitate. He had only used one, so there were still seven of them left. After giving Situ Hao six, he could still save one for himself.</p><p>“Oh, right! You will have to promise that you do not trade it out in the future as well.” Situ Hao was afraid that the world would be full of people performing his martial art. In that case, he would lose his advantage.</p><p>“Don’t worry. Even if you plan to, I will not.”</p><p>If it were not for the fact that he really liked the defensive sword spell, it would not be a thought at all for Ye Chen to use all of those treasures to exchange for it. After all even if he was lucky, he might never be able to get another Dragon Blood Plant.</p><p>“Here…This is the Defensive Sword Spell manual.”</p><p>The sword spell itself did not contain a profound; therefore, it was not stored in a jade bottle. It was simply just a manual. Situ Hao took it out and tossed it at Ye Chen. He was not afraid that the latter was going to eat his words.</p><p>And Ye Chen naturally was not that kind of person either. After receiving the manual, he looked through it roughly before nodding his head. He took out a jade bottle and six plants. The type of jade container they used could be found in the market everywhere, called the “memory jade bottle”. The owner could enter inside with his or her mind to view and store the images of the martial art movements.</p><p>Tossing them over, Ye Chen said, “You have a look.”</p><p>“No need.” Situ Hao put them away and turned to fly over to a smaller mountain, taking a seat immediately.</p><p>Smiling lightly, Ye Chen went back to his own mountain.</p><p>Since they did the whole transaction quietly, everyone watching only knew that they were trading something, but having no more details beyond that. They could not help but wonder.</p><p>“I got it!”</p><p>Ye Chen seemed happy. With the defensive sword spell, his soul power could not only be an advantage for his comprehensive ability and soul eye, but also in his attacking prowess. Otherwise, his five times stronger soul power would just be a waste.</p><p>Just like Ye Chen, Situ Hao was in a good mood as well; the loss had been forgotten completely. The Dragon Blood Plants could turn him into a body training top warrior very soon, which could improve his survival rate. And that spiritual sword had increased his chance of learning the fast profound.</p><p>With it, he could create his own profound sense and infuse it within to increase its speed and attacking power.</p><p>…</p><p>In the afternoon, two of the top five young warriors arrived: they were Bai Wuxue and Xiao Chuhe.</p><p>After some time, Beiming Hui arrived as well.</p><p>The first two arrivals had attracted some attention from the audience, and Beiming Hui’s arrival was no smaller deal than that. Right now, most people believed that he had the power to compete with the top five young warriors. That horrifying Sky Bank second movement scared most people, and even Situ Hao would not dare to challenge him that casually.</p><p>Haha!</p><p>Beiming Hui laughed twice as he looked at Ye Chen bluntly. He had modified his Sky Bank second movement after competing with Lin Chaonan, and was clearly way more powerful than before. This time, he planned to not only beat Ye Chen, but also beat some of the top young warriors.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
