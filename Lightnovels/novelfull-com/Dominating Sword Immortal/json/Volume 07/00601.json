Her temperament is different from Tantai Mingyue, but it fits her perfectly in its own way. No wonder Duan Lengya lost his cool.\"</p><p>Lin Kui was a little moved himself. Since he comprehended the withering profound, he had not thought about intimate relationships for a long time.</p><p>Shua!</p><p>With a flicker, Lin Kui flew out of the restaurant. The purple-robed woman stood high in the air, her dense black hair and sleeves fluttering in the wind.</p><p>Fifty meters before her was a figure condensed of icy gales. Duan Lengya smiled and said, \"Miss doesn't have to run a thousand li away from me. I merely wish to see miss' true appearance. Rest assured, I'll immediately let you go after that. I'm a man of my word.\"</p><p>The purple-robed woman said, \"It's rumored that Ice Spirit Master Duan Lengya is always tyrannous. Seems like that's quite true. But pardon me, I can't abide.\"</p><p>\"Then I have no other choice. I, Duan Lengya, am really curious what you look like. Seal!\"</p><p>Duan Lengya was titled the Ice Spirit Master. Aside from comprehending the Ice Profound, his physical body was the rarely seen Ice Spirit Body. Otherwise, even if he had comprehended a mid-grade profound martial skill fully, he wouldn't have been able to freeze three hundred li of river. As he channeled his Zhen Yuan, his right palm was instantly covered in ice crystals. It made a semi-circle in the air, then slapped out.</p><p>Kacha!</p><p>A chilly gale blew, immediately freezing the Water Yuan Qi in the air. In the next moment, hailstones started raining down from the sky.</p><p>\"Dark Sky Curtain!\"</p><p>The purple-robed woman could have actually left easily, avoiding all the trouble. But, she was waiting for a person, so she confronted the chilling palm energy head-on. A black Qi curled up between her hands, forming a protective barrier. As soon as this barrier appeared, darkness descended several hundred li around her, and it kept on spreading. Soon, it made contact with the palm energy, keeping it outside.</p><p>\"Dark Profound!\"</p><p>Duan Lengya was somewhat astonished. However, the palm energy was a little more powerful. An ice dragon suddenly charged out of it, heading straight toward the black barrier.</p><p>Creak! Crunch…!</p><p>Teeth-clattering sounds resounded, and a black curtain slowly warped under the assault of the ice dragon.</p><p>Inside a private room on the restaurant's fifth floor, two young elites were drinking wine.</p><p>\"Seems like there's a fight outside?\" The youngster with a red mole on his forehead spread out his soul power outside, seeming to have heard something.</p><p>\"It's Duan Lengya and your younger brother…Tsk, this woman is good. A pity that her face is not visible.\"</p><p>The other youngster with a stern face said, \"What are they doing? It's just a woman. I bet they will forget her after having a little fun.\"</p><p>\"Hehe, let's keep drinking.\"</p><p>Outside the restaurant, the fight was in a deadlock.</p><p>\"Let's see how long you can hold on for! Explode!\"</p><p>Duan Lengya raised his hand and clenched it, causing the ice dragon to explode suddenly. The impetus tore apart the black barrier, and the chilly wind instantly infiltrated.</p><p>Shua!</p><p>Far off in the distance, a sword light beam flickered. It was extremely quick, seeming to be outside the city at first. But the next instant, it was already in the sky above the city.</p><p>\"Duan Lengya, you're courting death!\"</p><p>A huge cyan-colored finger suddenly appeared out of nowhere. With an intermittently visible speed, it shot across the air. The cold Qi which had spread out after the ice dragon exploded was swept clean as soon as it made contact with the cyan finger, as if it was sucked in a void.</p><p>\"Who is it?\"</p><p>Seeing that the cyan-colored finger was still heading toward him, Duan Lengya slapped again, dissolving the finger.</p><p>Shua!</p><p>The purple-robed woman's vision blurred, and a blue-robed youngster appeared before her. Who would it be if not Ye Chen?</p><p>\"Ye Chen, you're here!\"</p><p>The purple-robed woman revealed a smile.</p><p>\"Mid Sea of Soul realm…More or less as I expected.\" The purest demonic energy of Demonic Beast King, although it wasn't much in quantity, was enough for Murong Qingcheng to advance a few minor realms. For her to advance from peak Astral Reaching realm to mid Sea of Soul realm in one go wasn't too exaggerated.</p><p>\"So, she is your friend?\" Duan Lengya's complexion turned gloomy.</p><p>Turning his head around, Ye Chen said, \"After a few months, we meet again.\"</p><p>\"That's right! I didn't expect her to be your friend. Oh, mid Sea of Soul realm! No wonder you're so arrogant. But, there is no Yan Fengfeng this time. If you want to leave safely, I'm afraid it won't happen this time.\" Duan Lengya could tell that Ye Chen's cultivation base had advanced to the mid Sea of Soul realm. But as far as he was concerned, the gap between the two of them was too big, and this small bit wasn't enough to fill it.</p><p>Ye Chen said, \"I'll leave safely. As for you two, you'll be lying on your backs.\"</p><p>\"You're still unafraid of death, aren't you? Let me see on what you have got to put us down. Brother Duan, he has delivered himself to me this time. Last time, he had Hai Wuya blocking me, but now, there is nobody to help him.\"</p><p>Hearing Ye Chen's words, Lin Kui's figure flickered and appeared beside Duan Lengya. His grey-clothes fluttered in an unbridled manner, giving a feeling of sharp blade.</p><p>\"Good, you can have him. Yuwen Jie will be quite glad after he finds out that Ye Chen has been beaten into a cripple. It's a pity that he isn't here though.\"</p><p>Hearing Lin Kui's words, Duan Lengya took a step back and turned his attention toward Murong Qingcheng, \"Your friend is in deep trouble. Perhaps, you can help reduce his suffering.\"</p><p>Murong Qingcheng creased her brows and said, \"I believe in him. If he says he will have you lie down, he will.\" After her long time with Ye Chen, Murong Qingcheng had sort of a blind trust toward Ye Chen. That was because she knew that he was not one to run off his mouth for the sake of putting up a front. If he said something, he certainly had something to back it up.</p><p>\"Humph! Then let's see who is right. Brother Lin, make sure you don't let others look down on us.\" Duan Lengya's mood turned sour. He could tell that the relationship between Murong Qingcheng and Ye Chen was not an ordinary one. Even after considering Tantai Mingyue, he wanted to obtain this woman, be it for a short period.</p><p>\"Who is this kid, daring to offend Duan Lengya and Lin Kui?\"</p><p>\"Women are truly sources of disasters, especially a peerless beauty. Although her appearance is hidden, she is top-quality just from her temperament.\"</p><p>\"That's right! No wonder Duan Lengya has chased her all the way down. I wonder what will be the conclusion of this kid.\"</p><p>\"What do you think will happen? He will certainly be beaten into a cripple or might even be killed. Keep in mind, this is not the first time Duan Lengya is doing something like this. All those women who were fancied by him ended up being discarded.\"</p><p>\"A pity... Such a top-quality woman!\"</p><p>In the restaurant and on the streets, discussions were going everywhere accompanied by sighs and headshakes.</p><p>With a chuckle, Lin Kui raised his blade high in the air and shouted, \"Ye Chen, it's too late for regrets. Withered tree regains life!\"</p><p>Followed by a chop, a gray-colored blade light expanded up to a hundred meters. It was an exquisite blade art; the deathly silent blade light contained a mighty withering power. The blade winds caused the constructions around to instantly crumble and erode away.</p><p>\"Get lost!\"</p><p>Unsheathing the Gold Sword, Ye Chen waved it single-handedly. A saw-toothed sword light cut through the gray blade light and fiercely slashed at Lin Kui's protective Zhen Yuan.</p><p>\"What? Impossible!\"</p><p>Lin Kui's face turned pale. Before he could respond, his protective Zhen Yuan was torn open, and the sword light struck his chest like a thunderbolt. Like a dead fish, his body shook a dozen times before spurting out a mouthful of blood. The spray was more than several meters long, seeming as if he'd spurted out his internal organs as well.</p><p>Yi!</p><p>Everybody took a sharp breath. One sword was enough to heavily injure Lin Kui. It was completely different from what they had anticipated; in fact, it was the complete opposite.</p><p>\"How is this possible? When did this guy gain such strength?\" Duan Lengya's face was so gloomy that it seemed to be dripping water. His eyes had further shrunk into two dots. He only knew that if he couldn't cripple Ye Chen this time, then his future wouldn't be good. Later on, Ye Chen would certainly cripple, or even kill him.</p><p>\"Die!\"</p><p>Spreading out his two hands, Duan Lengya shot a palm energy in the form of two ice dragons, which charged at Ye Chen while curling and twisting about each other. Any person caught in between these two dragons would have his bones crushed amongst the fragments of ice.</p><p>The speed of the ice was extremely quick, instantly arriving behind Ye Chen. They seemed like a pair of scissors that were about to cleave Ye Chen in two.</p><p>Kacha!</p><p>However, Ye Chen neither retreated nor dodged. A sword light flickered, cutting off one dragon's head; the cut was extremely clean like glass, without a single rough spot.</p><p>\"There is one more. Let's see how you dodge this.\"</p><p>Duan Lengya followed behind the ice dragon. As long as Ye Chen was busy dealing with the ice dragon, he could inflict a fatal wound, disabling the latter from retaliation.</p><p>However, he didn't expect that as soon as the dragon reached Ye Chen, Ye he simply clenched his fist and punched it. That berserk power directly made the dragon explode, and the ice-crystals swirled back, trapping Duan Lengya instead.</p><p>\"What kind of power is this?!\"</p><p>The spectators were stunned silly. To break an ice-dragon in one punch such that even the crystals shot back in reverse? This kind of strength was already beyond their imagination.</p><p>Creak Creak Creak…</p><p>Caught completely unprepared, Duan Lengya's protective Zhen Yuan was continuously being chewed down by the ice shards. Ultimately, it crumbled completely; fortunately, the ice shards were mostly over as well. He simply smashed his palm on the remaining ones.</p><p>\"Cut!\"</p><p>Ye Chen's callous face appeared in his line of sight, and his face immediately revealed a terrified expression, \"No!\"</p><p>A sword light flickered, cleaving off Duan Lengya's right arm and releasing spurting bloodstreams.</p><p>Cutting off Duan Lengya's right arm, Ye Chen kicked his stomach. With that, the former's figure flew across like a shooting star, smashing onto the street.</p><p>Shua!</p><p>Right at this moment, a black light suddenly streaked across, targeting Ye Chen's head. It was a throwing knife slicing at an inconceivable speed, containing Astral energy that could cut through Protective Zhen Yuan of a Sea of Soul realm Master.</p><p>As if he had eyes on his back, Ye Chen raised his hand and caught the flying knife, its tail trembling in his hands.</p><p>\"Even my Star Cleaving Flying Knife failed!\" Lin Kui's scalp went numb, and he madly dashed towards the restaurant.</p><p>\"Where are you going?\"</p><p>With a slash of his Gold Sword, a crescent moon shaped sword Qi chased after Lin Kui, closing in rapidly.</p><p>\"Stay your hand!\"</p><p>A stern-faced youth suddenly appeared outside the restaurant, smashing the sword Qi with his bare fist. Beside him appeared a youngster with a red mole on his forehead. The latter looked at Duan Lengya, who had lost one of his arms, and a furious expression appeared on his face, \"Kid, for better for worse, you've appeared in Sky Martial Region as an anomaly. It certainly won't be quiet here. In that case, let me settle the calamity that is you.\"</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
