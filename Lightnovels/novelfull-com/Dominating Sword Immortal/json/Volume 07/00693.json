I’ll make you despair.”</p><p>Wei Longtao had complete confidence in his defense. He didn’t believe that Ye Chen would be able to break his defense and seriously injure him. Of course, he didn’t dare to get careless either. The muscles on his entire body swelled, and a frightening energy covered every inch of his body, causing his body to be shrouded by a layer of crystalline red glow.</p><p>Across him, Ye Chen stood a few li away from him, facing the wind. He didn’t draw his sword, neither did he assume any battle posture. But, his gaze gradually sharpened, locking in on every moment of Wei Longtao.</p><p>Amidst the night breeze, the spectators afar stood holding their breath, unblinkingly staring Ye Chen to witness his so-called true strength.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>A cold light flickered in his two eyes as Ye Chen pointed with his right hand. The golden sword at his back unsheathed and shot out with a speed exceeding the perception of soul power. Such a speed caused everybody to still focus on Ye Chen, awaiting his killer move.</p><p>‘Danger!’</p><p>Wei Longtao felt his scalp go numb. Following that, this numbness traveled to his feet before returning back to his head again. This was no longer his perception warning him of danger, but the instincts of his body. In fact, the time he had was simply not enough for him to think anything.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Splashing lava like sparks flew off his chest and a dense rotting, metallic smell spread out. In the next moment, Wei Longtao spurted a huge mouthful of blood, and his figure shot back like a wisp of smoke, covering dozens of li in an instant. En-route, his eyes, nose, and ears also let out streams of blood like wriggling small snakes.</p><p>“Hall Leader Wei lost?”</p><p>The spectators were stupefied. They were eagerly waiting for Ye Chen to bring out an exceptionally powerful move. But, they only saw Ye Chen’s right hand moving and Hall Leader Wei flying back while spurting a huge mouthful of blood, his chest mysteriously letting off sparks.</p><p>Hiss!</p><p>After a momentary silence, numerous sounds of sharp intakes could be heard. A move that they could see was not as frightening or terrifying as the move that they couldn’t make head or tail of.</p><p>“Return!”</p><p>With a thought, the golden sword flew back and returned to its sheath, its sharpness completely covered.</p><p>“This is the sword that defeated Hall Leader Wei?”</p><p>Everybody immediately realized that Ye Chen’s ultimate move was a flying sword technique. As for whether or not he had used his hands to throw the sword or it was something else, they couldn’t tell. After all, they had no time previously to pay attention to this detail at all.</p><p>“Sword Master Ye Chen…really worthy of the title.”</p><p>Wu Chuan and Xu Danian were thoroughly in admiration. When they originally found out Ye Chen’s title of Sword Master, they didn’t take it too seriously. However, they now realized that there was simply no sword artist in the Sea of Soul realm who could rival him. Ye Chen was this generation’s Sword Master without a doubt. Even in Eastern Shallow Ocean, there wasn’t a sword artist capable of contending against him.</p><p>“Hall Leader Wei, whose might shook Blood Battle Ocean for decades, is actually defeated! Deputy Ye’s strength simply goes against the heavens! It’s simply unbelievable!”</p><p>“Same! I thought he was simply talking big just now.”</p><p>“But, we still don’t know why they fought in such a manner!”</p><p>Numerous discussions arose, accompanied by incessant sighing.</p><p>Upon defeating Wei Longtao with one sword strike, Ye Chen reached out and made a pulling motion. A powerful attractive force pulled the former’s body back, making him spurt another mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Wei Longtao, do you still have something to say?”</p><p>Wei Longtao no longer had any fighting strength left, and he just resentfully looked at Ye Chen, “Even if you beat me, so what? You think the Elders Association will believe you, an outsider, and forcefully declare me guilty? Ye Chen, I’ll remember today’s disgrace till my last moment, and surely return it back one day.”</p><p>“You can keep your words for the Elders Association. As for what they choose to do with you, that’s their own matter.”</p><p>Grabbing Wei Longtao, Ye Chen flew toward the great hall. Regarding such an important affair, he could only hurry back to the palace.</p><p>As soon as Ye Chen left, Chen Yuxin and Xing Meilian exchanged a glance. Ye Chen’s tyrannous means shook them to their cores. The majestic Azure Dragon Hall Leader was ultimately unable to escape, being grabbed by the neck to be judged. To do such a thing, Ye Chen was the first, and would probably be the last.</p><p>Dragon God Celestial Palace, Great Hall…</p><p>Ye Chen appeared outside the conveyor gate, grabbing Wei Longtao.</p><p>“Dragon God Envoy!”</p><p>There were four attendants in the great hall.</p><p>Ye Chen said, “Notify all elders to come to Elders Hall.”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>Before leaving, the four attendants glanced at Wei Longtao and their faces turned somewhat strange. However, they didn’t say anything. With their figures flickering, they left one after another.</p><p>…</p><p>Elders Hall…</p><p>The elders rushed over one after another. However, when they saw Wei Longtao captured by Ye Chen, they were somewhat dumbfounded. Not to mention how Ye Chen captured him, wondering what crime he’d committed made them puzzled.</p><p>Soon afterward, the third elder, second elder, and Great Elder arrived as well.</p><p>Third elder, who was skilled in keeping a calm head, merely showed faint surprise. Apart from that, he didn’t reveal any expression.</p><p>Clearing his throat, the Great Elder asked, “Dragon God Envoy, what is going on?”</p><p>Ye Chen gave a detailed narration of Yao Yifeng’s deeds, then how Wei Longtao killed him in a hurry. Then, he told his suspicions of Wei Longtao and used his identity of Dragon God Envoy as the basis for his actions. There was no exaggeration or downplaying anywhere in his narration.</p><p>Wei Longtao raised his head and said calmly, “Do you people believe me or him?”</p><p>“This…!”</p><p>A lot of elders were hesitating. Although Wei Longtao’s actions of killing Yao Yifeng were impulsive and somewhat queer, he was, after all, Azure Dragon Hall Leader, with a status only under the Great Elder. To apprehend him almost whimsically gave them a little inexplicable feeling. Furthermore, thinking about their own, Ye Chen even dared to capture the Azure Dragon Hall Leader. Then, if his suspicions turned toward them one day, wouldn’t they be arrested without any questions asked?</p><p>Of course, Ye Chen was still the Dragon God Envoy, and they couldn’t say anything before him. Although Elders Association was the authority that handled all the big and small matters of the palace, they were not the highest authority. Above them were the Protectors, hidden from plain sight.</p><p>“Hall Leader Wei, if you haven’t done anything, nobody will be able to do anything to you. You can be at ease.” An elder with friendly relations with Wei Longtai consoled, although he did shoot a quick glance at Ye Chen.</p><p>“Right, Hall Leader Wei, hold on! Deputy Ye is merely suspicious. After all, your actions of killing Yao Yifeng were a little impulsive.”</p><p>Elder Yu, who was sitting nearby, sent a Zhen Yuan transmission to Ye Chen, “Dragon God Envoy, you were a little hasty this time. After all, Wei Longtao is the Azure Dragon Hall Leader, a person with connections. Most importantly, the evidence is insufficient. I dare say, due to this incident, many elders will grow apprehensive of you and push you away.”</p><p>Ye Chen revealed a sneer, “Impulsive? I don’t think so. If he really is a spy, his presence in Azure Dragon Hall will be disastrous. As for the elders growing apprehensive….Hehe. Elder Yu, I’m not a person desiring of authority. I only believe in strength. With sufficient strength, you can even oppose the heavens. Authority is merely equivalent to the floating clouds.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
