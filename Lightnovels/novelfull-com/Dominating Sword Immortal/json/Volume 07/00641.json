Ninety percent completed Void Shattering Finger is completely different from the completed one. The power difference is a whole level’s worth. As long as I can train this Void Shattering Finger to completion, then even if it is Bai Wuxue, he would not be able to win against me at all. And, one Ye Chen would be nothing at all either.”</p><p>With that thought in mind, Xia Houzun was a bit relieved.</p><p>Before, he was a bit losing it, because he had never expected to be defeated by Ye Chen at all. Therefore, he really wanted to beat Ye Chen now, treating him like his No.1 enemy. He thought it was a bit funny as even though it had to be done regardless, his No.1 enemy should not be the latter at all. It should still be Bai Wuxue and warriors at his level at least.</p><p>…</p><p>Returning back to Muron Qingcheng, Ye Chen said a bit annoyed, “He escaped!’</p><p>“As long as we are okay.” Her face was very pale like fragile white china that could break any second. After seeing him, she let out a breath. Xia Houzun’s power was too much, and he kept bringing out new powerful attacks. Although Ye Chen was able to oppress him still, if pushed too much, then he might have decided to die with the latter.</p><p>“How are you doing?”</p><p>Ye Chen held up her hand which was so soft as if there was not a single bone, the silky skin that used to be warm now almost icy cold. Pouring in his soul power, Ye Chen realized that her meridians were all messed up, some of which were completely shattered.</p><p>She took her hand and used a handkerchief to wipe off the blood off his mouth, “You do not have to worry about me. Although the demon power essence is very powerful, since it came from where my demon power originates, it cannot cause any internal wounds that cannot be fixed. I will eventually be fully recovered. It is you whom I am worried about. You had taken on so many attacks of Void Shattering Finger Art.”</p><p>Ye Chen laughed, “I forgot to mention this to you, but I have already trained the undying body, so these kinds of wounds will be healed very soon.”</p><p>“Undying body?”</p><p>She was surprised. She knew that he had obtained the undying body secret art. But, she had never expected that he had already trained it fully, since it was something that only Life and Death Realm king warriors could think about. It would not be easy to train at all, and might be just as hard as entering the Life and Death Realm itself.</p><p>“Being able to train the undying body quickly will be able to greatly help you while entering the Life and Death Realm, right? Have you made any progress?” A while ago, Ye Chen had already given Murong Qingcheng his undying body secret art, hoping that she could just be like him and train the undying body in advance. He thought that she might be safe fighting against other people the next time, and it might be great help for her in the future when she tried to reach the Life and Death Realm.</p><p>She shook her head, “Perhaps, I am not suitable to train this secret art, since the demon race still has some big differences from the human race. Hence, the training method of undying body might be different as well.”</p><p>“That is true.” Ye Chen felt that it was a shame.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng could sense Ye Chen’s care, so she tightened his hand while leaning her head over his shoulder. Two looked a bit strange together, but only they knew that it was a result of coincidence and great effort, as if someone had tied them together with a red string.</p><p>In the tunnel, a beam of blue flame flew out. When it got close to Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng, it suddenly stopped and landed onto the ground, slowing forming into a human shadow.</p><p>It was Yan Fengfeng.</p><p>“You two!” Yan Fengfeng revealed a playful smile.</p><p>Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng left each other’s embrace, but they were still holding hands, “Sister Yan, have you gotten any great treasure yet?”</p><p>Yan Fengfeng made a face, “They are really not that easy to come across, but I did not have many expectations, since I had already gotten a semi extreme rank shield out there. You two are getting quite cozy here, huh? Hiding out here and cuddling…Did I interrupt something?”</p><p>Ye Chen said with a forced smile, “We are not that relaxed. We had just beaten off Xia Houzun, Murong is quite badly wounded as well.”</p><p>“You beat off Xia Houzun?” Yan Fengfeng just realized that the tunnels around them looked like they had been hit by falling stars. Moreover, Murong Qingcheng’s face was paler than a white piece of paper. An intense battle looked to have happened here indeed.</p><p>Yan Fengfeng was shocked at Ye Chen’s battling power, since she knew quite a lot about Xia Houzun’s power. Inside the valley, although she was not bulled by him, but Xia Houzun did not use all of his power either. If he had, Yan Fengfeng knew that she might not have made it out safely. But, Ye Chen was able to beat him, and obviously cause some damage on him; otherwise, the latter would not have left like that.</p><p>“The palace would only exist for three days, I will not disturb you two anymore!”</p><p>Inside the maze tunnels, it was not necessarily a good thing to have this many people as well. After all, if one ran into some treasures, it would not be possible to separate it in three parts.</p><p>“Alright, you take care!” Ye Chen nodded.</p><p>Separating from Yan Fengfeng, Ye Chen did not rush to look for more treasures. In fact, after getting that semi extreme rank shield, he had nothing to wish for.</p><p>…</p><p>Three days went past quickly, and everyone was shipped out of the palace. Soon, the massive palace slowly disappeared in front of everyone’s eyes.</p><p>Judging by everyone’s expression, it was not hard to tell how many people ended up with nothing from the palace. Only a very small amount of people managed to get something. As for whether they were semi extreme rank items, there would be no way of knowing, since no one would want to expose what they had gotten just to show off, which would be rather stupid.</p><p>“Huh!”</p><p>Xia Houzun looked at Ye Chen with a cold sneer. He made a noise before turning into a beam of gold light and shooting out into the distance, leaving the others wondering what had happened between the two.</p><p>Amongst the top five young warriors, Bai Wuxue and Lu Shaoyou looked like they were thinking about something. Earlier on, they had glanced at Xia Houzun, and although he was not wounded at all, that qi on him seemed quite weak, which was very uncommon. What was even stranger was that was the fact Xia Houzun seemed to be very hostile toward Ye Chen.</p><p>He stopped looking Bai Wuxue said with a quiet voice, “Our position as the top five young warriors is going to be shaken now. I have a very strong instinct about that.”</p><p>Lu Shaoyou touched his sword and said with a cold voice, “The position is something you have to fight for yourself, and no one can take that away from you. Since when did the Bai Wuxue I know started saying such petty things?”</p><p>“Haha!” Bai Wuxue chuckled without saying anything more.</p><p>On the other side, Ye Chen did not care about that sneer Xia Houzun gave him before he left. For him, this kind of hostile attitude meant nothing. All he wanted to do was to beat the other every time he saw his opponent, killing all of his opponent’s confidence. Although it sounded cruel, there was no other way of winning except beating all of your opponents.</p><p>“Let’s go!” Ye Chen greeted Yan Fengfeng and flew over toward the east with Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>…</p><p>For the next half month, besides Xia Houzun who had left the fourth level world first, the remaining folks all tried their best to search for more treasures, since such opportunities were not that easy to come across. There would be another four year wait after this after all.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>In that massive flatland, Ye Chen was battling a pile of treasure qi that was one hundred and seventy centimeters tall. Its body was perfect like diamonds, without any flaws. Each movement brought that rich treasure qi up into the air, turning it into a sky tearing light column and attacking toward Ye Chen.</p><p>“Thunder Devour!”</p><p>Ye Chen waved one of his hand, and a silver lightning appeared on his sword. It tied up together and did not leak out at all, seeming to be forming into a ball shaped attack.</p><p>In the battle with Xia Houzun, Ye Chen started to gain some understanding of his thunder profound. He had used one sword to perform his thunder devour, but it was obvious that one sword was not as great as two swords, which could easily perform the attack. However, it was somehow even harder to use only one sword. He had managed to form half a small thunder ball only one out of the ten times he tried. But, what was surprising was that even with that tiny thunder ball, its power was already way more than the one performed with two swords. It was easy to tell that once he could perform the perfect thunder devour with one sword, he would be able to top his current powerful attacks for sure.</p><p>The treasure qi creature was very powerful, not that much weaker than Xia Houzun with his top attacks. He would be the perfect practice opponent with no other emotional business involved.</p><p>But of course, only Ye Chen would dare to use this kind of a treasure qi creature for training. If it were other people, even if it were the top five young warriors, they would not dare to do so at all, since they did not have the undying body yet. They would be wounded one way or another after a long battle; small wounds would add up and turn into a severe wound, which would only lead to death. On the contrary, the creature would not die unless a fatal attack was employed. Otherwise, it would last forever and use the natural qi to repair itself.</p><p>Over on the other side, Murong Qingcheng sat on a huge rock, resting as she watched Ye Chen train. She was not surprised to see him training what other people would consider recklessly. She just smiled gently; she was very clear that her boyfriend was very incredible and full of potential. Even though he was only human, he was somehow like a beast. In the not so far future, she believed that he might become a sword king or the top sword emperor, which had not emerged in thousands of years, perhaps even more.</p><p>Before, she was not that ambitious at all; but after spending some time with Ye Chen, she knew that she would need some, since it would not take that long time before Ye Chen reached way beyond her to another level. Therefore, she knew that if she wanted to be with him, she would have to follow him and become more powerful alongside him.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The whole world shook as Ye Chen continued to throw sword attacks onto the continuously moving treasure qi creature. This sword attack had formed out half a silver thunder ball which landed directly onto that creature’s chest.</p><p>It looked like a mad thunder had fallen from the sky. The treasure qi around that creature spread out, its shape dimming down a bit.</p><p>“Three attacks!”</p><p>With his spiritual sword being the leading attack, he threw out three attacks at once, aiming for the creature’s head.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>A head was blown up into the sky.</p><p>Whoo!</p><p>Ye Chen breathed heavily as he thought to himself, ‘Unfortunately, this world does not have natural yuan qi, and my Zhen yuan would definitely be burned out if this battle continued. So, I had to beat it. Otherwise, I could have brought my Thunder Devour to the next level sooner.’</p><p>Anyway, he performed his Thunder Devour with one sword and was already able to form half a thunder ball, which was great progress compared to before.</p><p>…</p><p>Within a blink of an eye, half a month flew by, and the world on the fourth floor was about to close up. No matter it was the fourth floor or the third or the second, all of the young warriors would have to walk down. If they did not, then they would be closed in for eleven months, and it would open again only next year. Only the first floor was open all the time.</p><p>Outside the tower, a huge amount of people poured in.</p><p>“Haha, this was a great trip after all. I got two top rank weapons! It looks like this will be a lucky year for me.”</p><p>“Mine was not too bad either. I had got one top rank long whip!”</p><p>The whip weapon was very rare; and even though the top rank long whip might not be as powerful as a semi extreme rank weapon, its rarity was the same, since it was a special type after all.</p><p>“You think this is good luck? On the third floor world, someone got a whole full set of top rank weapons.”</p><p>“What! A full set! That is even more precious than normal semi extreme rank weapons, since it would increase defense as well as attacking prowess.”</p><p>“Why should I lie to you? It is her!” Someone pointed at Jing Aoxuan.</p><p>“Should we try to steal it?” Some of them looked rather evil.</p><p>Just as everyone else was about to make a move, Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng walked out and flew over toward Jing Aoxuan and Li Xiaoyun. Someone from the group remembered the rest of them after seeing Ye Chen’s arrival, and a cold sweat broke out of their bodies. They were glad that they did not do anything that would put them in grave danger</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
