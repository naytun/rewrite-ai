They all could tell that that stare was pure negative, only filled with battle intent and hostility.</p><p>“Why does it look like even Beiming Hui has beef with Ye Chen?”</p><p>“How strange! Situ Hao got problems with Ye Chen, and so does Beiming Hui. But, when did they exchange attacks? Why do I have the feeling that both of them had lost to Ye Chen before? Otherwise, they would have no reasons to be mad at him at all, right?”</p><p>“I feel the same too!”</p><p>With one Situ Hao already, now that there was Beiming Hui as well, everyone started to realize how powerful Ye Chen really was, and that he had somehow taken advantage of these two top warriors already without anyone knowing. It would not be something that everyone could achieve.</p><p>Ye Chen could sense the battle intent from Beiming Hui as he smiled lightly. Nevertheless, he sat on top of the mountain without moving because he had realized that Xiao Chuhe somehow had battle intent toward Beiming Hui as well. Obviously, Beiming Hui had beaten Lin Chaonan, which had threatened Xiao Chuhe and his position.</p><p>Ye Chen was the first person who realized it, and then it was Bei Wuxue before that battle intent fully released out from Xiao Chuhe’s body and spread out toward Beiming Hui without hiding. The air seemed to have stopped moving, and everything seemed to have slowed down.</p><p>“Xiao Chuhe, you wanna battle me?”</p><p>Beiming Hui stopped looking at Ye Chen and squinted his eyes as he stared at Xiao Chuhe.</p><p>The other walked over step after step and said lightly, “Even if I do not come out to challenge you, you will challenge us soon. So, might as well deal with it now.”</p><p>How could he not realize Beiming Hui’s ambition? It was the kind that people who craved power would only have. Xiao Chuhe had it before as well, but he was very lucky as he had beaten one of the previous top three master level warriors—Shen Qianlang—which had accumulated a lot of experience and aura for him.</p><p>“Hehe, you are quite right. This time, I came here to beat a lot of people. Otherwise, it would be a big waste of time.” Beiming Hui stopped for a moment before continued speaking, “You guys have occupied the title for too long, and I think it is time for you to take a break. How about I take the first slot?”</p><p>It would be very meaningful to be the first person taking over the top five young warriors’ position. If that happened, then Beiming Hui would be the first person breaking the era and successfully making his way up.</p><p>“It seems like you are quite confident, but I love to kill off this kind of confidence indeed.” Xiao Chuhe’s battling style was very calm, but it should never be forgotten that he was a blade artist who had this kind of tyrant vibe carved into his bones.</p><p>He flew to the middle of the Nine Dragon Lake while Beiming Hui took out the long spear from behind him and pointed the tip at Xiao Chuhe, “Amongst the top three master level warriors, I have already beaten Lin Chaonan, and you are next. Are you ready?”</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>Beiming Hui’s loud profile had shocked a lot of people; they had not seen anyone challenging the top five young warriors like this in a long while.</p><p>“It is indeed the Sky Martial Region after all…So intense!”</p><p>Li Daoxuan and the other two had never seen this kind of a battle before featuring top warriors like this. The title of top five young warriors had been something that they heard a lot even back in their hometowns. But inside the Sky Martial Region, someone who actually dared to challenge them like this made them respect Ye Chen even more for being so comfortable in a place as such.</p><p>“He is so bright and outstanding wherever he goes.” Bing Ling sighed. There were no words that could express her awe.</p><p>When they first came to the Sky Martial Region, they were like normal mortals who had just come out of their shells. Right then, Ye Chen’s reputation had already been spread out everywhere. And here, someone who had the confidence to challenge the top five young warriors head on seemed to have lost to Ye Chen before.</p><p>“Let’s just start from being normal people then!” Yan Chihuo tightened his fists, feeling inspired.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>Tapping his foot lightly on the ground, Xiao Chuhe came to the center of the lake and faced Beiming Hui.</p><p>“Let me see your power!”</p><p>Xiao Chuhe took out his sword since he was not stupid; that opponent of his was not just anyone. Not taking out his sword would give him nothing but disadvantages; therefore, the second he arrived near his opponent, he had taken out his longsword. A white light wrapped around the blade like flowing water.</p><p>“Alright! Bring it on!”</p><p>The lake below his feet suddenly exploded as Beiming Hui dove down like a mad dragon. He shot out directly, his battle intent sharp and direct.</p><p>“Silver Dragon Seven Attack!”</p><p>Right in the beginning, Beiming Hui wanted to test out his opponent’s power. It would be really dangerous to perform his deadliest attack without ensuring that the power gap was not that far apart. If that were the case, then it would be really dangerous if he could not beat his opponent with one attack, then his opponent would be able to avoid and fight back. Although he was very confident in his new Sky Bank second movement, his opponent was one of the top five young warriors after all, and definitely should not be underestimated.</p><p>The Silver Dragon Seven Attack had seven different changes of attacks. Performed by Beiming Hui, the long spear seemed to have turned into a silver flood dragon, smashing its way forward and seeming unstoppable.</p><p>Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang!</p><p>As one of the top five young warriors, Xiao Chuhe naturally could not be beaten by the Silver Flood Seven Dragon. He stood still, throwing out blade attacks after blade attacks. If these blade attacks came from other people, they would be very ordinary; but in his hand, the normal blade attacks had blocked out that aggressive Silver Dragon Seven Attacks completely.</p><p>After blocking out the last attack, Xiao Chuhe suddenly fought back. That long blade carried the power that could break the ocean waves before as it sliced out at its target.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>The Nine Dragon Lake could not handle this powerful blade pressure and was suddenly split open into two toward the sides.</p><p>“What a good timing! Dragon Spear Spell!”</p><p>Beiming Hui did not back out at all. Instead, he shook his long spear and a silver dragon appeared out of nowhere, roaring into the sky. It shook its head and tail as it threw its claws toward the incoming blade light.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The blade light and the massive silver dragon clashed together. With that, the center of the lake was pushed into the sky, forming a hundred meters tall water column.</p><p>“Ocean Separation!”</p><p>Xiao Chuhe cut the water column in half and that white blade light spread out while intensifying by one hundred times. That bright white light was almost unbearable for the human eyes to look at.</p><p>“It is indeed hard to take on.”</p><p>Beiming Hui was a bit surprised. He had heard about Xiao Chuhe’s calm battling style before, but it was only now that he realized how calm the latter really was, and how it was all preparing for that attack. It was like the ocean before a storm.</p><p>“Dragon Spear Spell! Dragon Aura!”</p><p>During that battle with Ye Chen before, he had not been able to finish his attack yet. All he had used was the defensive aspect.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Xiao Chuhe’s blade light landed onto that massive silver dragon that was hit heavily, making it roar into the sky again angrily. Its body shot out into the sky as well, shattering the blade light.</p><p>“This Beiming Hui is very impressive. Before, some of the young martial geniuses who had challenged Xiao Chuhe had all been beaten within a couple of attacks. And right now, these two have already exchanged dozens of attacks, and Beiming Hui still seems to have the upper hand.”</p><p>Seeing that Beiming Hui managed to shatter the blade light, a lot of people started their chattering. They seemed rather shocked, since it was their first time seeing someone who was not one of the top five young warriors challenging Xiao Chuhe.</p><p>“He has made quite a progress!” This dragon attack had impressed Ye Chen.</p><p>“Sky Bank!”</p><p>After shattering Xiao Chuhe’s blade light, Beiming Hui’s eyes could not look brighter as he stabbed out a spear into the air. Most people could not even see the spear at all; all they could sense was that the gap between them seemed to have shortened for a brief second.</p><p>“You really think this is the attack that you can beat me with?”</p><p>Xiao Chuhe was so powerful that he did not have to think before throwing out his blade attack right at the center of the invisible spear light and shattering it completely.</p><p>“What about this attack?”</p><p>Beiming Hui yelled with a low voice as the long spear in his hand was shaken five times. Next, five twisting, unpredictable silver rays were shot out, seeming very slow because they were moving too fast. All of a sudden, the splash that the rays brought up looked like it had been frozen.</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>Xiao Chuhe suddenly changed his expression. This spear was so powerful that it was out of his expectations. Although he had heard about Sky Bank Second Movement’s power, he had never seen it first hand.</p><p>That bone-deep danger reddened Xiao Chuhe’s eyes. He was so highly focused that everything around him was ignored automatically. All he could see were those five beams of rays.</p><p>Ting!</p><p>Ting!</p><p>Ting!</p><p>Ting!</p><p>No one could describe exactly how fast Xiao Chuhe’s blade speed was, but each blade attack he performed gave people a sense of sharpness and decisiveness. Normally when warriors were training their blade arts above the ocean, they did not aim to maintain their fast blade speed for the whole time. Once there was a massive wave, they had to be able to increase their blade speed to its peak; otherwise, the power would not be enough to split the ocean. However, Xiao Chuhe’s blade speed was ten times faster than the blade speed that was required to split an ocean wave.</p><p>In other words, Xiao Chuhe’s average blade speed might not be the greatest, or it could not compete with Ye Chen’s sword speed at least; but within a split second, his blade speed would be horrifyingly fast.</p><p>However, the Sky Bank second movement would not be that easy to break either. Four of the five silver rays were shattered, and the last one landed on Xiao Chuhe’s left shoulder, blowing him away. Blood poured out from the corner of his mouth, dyeing the lake red.</p><p>“Ocean Breaker Three Blades!”</p><p>Right at the moment when everyone thought that Xiao Chuhe was about to lose, he stopped his body by force as both of his feet stomped on the surface of the lake heavily, bringing up massive waves. Riding on a wave, he threw out three blade attacks in a row from above. All three attacks layered over each other, looking extremely aggressive. The color of the sky changed drastically, looking paler than normal; it gave people the feeling that a storm was about to arrive.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Beiming Hui did not expect to face such a counterattack. Hence, he yelled once before performing his dragon attack.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The silver dragon had only managed to block out two of the incoming blade lights while the third blade light cut off its head before blowing Beiming Hui away.</p><p>“If you guys want to steal the title from the top five young warriors, it is still a bit too early.” Xiao Chuhe stood on top of the wave while looking cold, his eyes still red. In his opinion, regardless if it was Beiming Hui or Ye Chen, they were only warriors who had gotten a little bit of power and way too much confidence. He thought that it would just be a joke if they wanted to steal the title. After all, the top five young warriors had fought so many times to secure their hard-earned title.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
