Great name!” After completing the soul mark, Ye Chen learned the name of the shield.</p><p>“Let’s see its power.”</p><p>There was still a difference between different shields in the same rank; some of them were great for head-on attacks while other ones were better for sides and back attacks. Some of them were great for lowering attacking power.</p><p>Removing the gold shield he was already wearing, Ye Chen put on this new one.</p><p>Whoo!</p><p>As he accumulated his Zhen yuan, a see-through egg like qi layer appeared outside his body. It was the protective Zhen yuan with a pattern on the surface being lit up. Twisted blue symbols infused with the protective Zhen yuan as if they had been actually carved onto the shield, leaving no dead corners at all.</p><p>“Yeah, it is a comprehensive defense with no weak points or outstanding spots. So, it is rather even.”</p><p>Ye Chen had got a rough idea of the shield by now. Although the shield itself did not have many weak points or any extra strong regions, he was really happy about it. With the shield protecting him on the outside and the dragon bone defense layer on the inside, his weakness in terms of defense was not only covered, but it had been strengthened as well.</p><p>Of course, Ye Chen also knew that defense would never be as important as attacks for warriors. Rarely anyone would want to waste a lot of time on studying defensive martial arts. It was exactly because of that defensive items were this important, since it would allow the warriors to perform their attacks with no concern at the back of their minds.</p><p>…</p><p>“Damn! How can this guy shatter my defensive sword spell this easily? Even if he were fast, he should not be able to react this quickly!” Situ Hao performed his body art, moving at a high speed in the tunnel. After a whole fifty minutes of flying, he finally stopped moving.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>He threw out a punch onto the wall, looking frustrated and angry.</p><p>“My Defensive Sword Spell is a secret art which I had gotten from ancient ruins three months ago, and I had never performed it in front of anyone before. I thought the first time using it would make a massive impact, but I cannot believe it would fail this horribly.”</p><p>The Defensive Sword Spell was not a secret art passed down in the Situ family; instead, he had randomly found it in an ancient ruin. It took him three full months of training before finally completing it. He was very confident with it before Ye Chen, thinking that he could take anyone besides the top five young warriors out with it. Moreover, he even thought that even the top five young warriors might not be able to beat him with it as well.</p><p>“Ye Chen, I will remember you! But, do not think that you will win against me twice. There are three different levels in the defensive sword spell, and I have only trained the first one. Once I reach the second level, I will use it to beat you.”</p><p>The cold voice lingered in the tunnel, but he had disappeared already.</p><p>…</p><p>“From here to the room one thousand meters away would require getting around a series of hard corners, then I will get to the east side of the room.”</p><p>Closing her gold vertical eye on her forehead, Murong Qingcheng let out a long breath. She walked toward the tunnel behind her, and finally managed to find the tunnel that was connecting to the room after couple of corners.</p><p>“Interesting! She could see through walls?”</p><p>In a corner, a tiny snake traveled out.</p><p>It was a tiny puppet snake that was wrapped around with a layer of snakeskin, looking nothing different from a real snake. The one thing that was different was that it had no living scent.</p><p>The red snake eye moved around, reflecting Murong Qingcheng’s figure within.</p><p>A couple hundred meters away, Xia Houzun laughed gently while walking over.</p><p>“Here!”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng arrived in front of the door.</p><p>Hm?</p><p>She naturally had very sensitive senses, and could hear a very tiny footstep sound which was at least a hundred meters away from her. If it were someone else, then it would be impossible to notice it at all. It was not that warriors had weaker hearing than normal human beings, but inside these tunnels, not only soul power had been restricted, even the hearing had been affected due to the thick sound proofing walls. Normally, one hundred meters would be Sea of Souls Realm warriors’ hearing limit. The reason that Murong Qingcheng could hear it was because that she had the demon spirit body, which was way more powerful than normal people.</p><p>She frowned and suddenly pointed out her fingers. A beam of black finger power shot out, shattering the puppet snake in the corner.</p><p>After doing so, she walked into the room.</p><p>“Huh!”</p><p>Xia Houzun, who was a hundred meters away, looked surprised. That puppet snake was nothing to him, but he was used to being treated superiorly. Even if it were done carelessly, but that kind of rejection would piss him off as well. There were only four people who could treat him as equal, and only them. The rest had no right to do so.</p><p>On top of the stone stand in the middle of the room was a light ball. Inside the light ball was a set of purple-black gloves floating within. Although the power vibration had been blocked out, the powerful aura still managed to leak out, delivering a tiger-roar like sound.</p><p>“Such an aggressive qi!”</p><p>Normally, the attacking weapons’ qi would be way much more aggressive than that of defensive items.</p><p>Pop!</p><p>After breaking the light ball with one finger, she reached in to grab onto the gloves. It was made of a very soft fabric, and she could feel that hysterical power pouring in through her palms.</p><p>Pooh!</p><p>She activated her demon power, easily canceling out this wave of power. While she was at it, she poured her demon power into the gloves as well, letting the gloves get familiar with its future owner.</p><p>“Making the soul mark would probably take a while. If I use it now, I should be able to use about seventy percent of its power. But, it should be enough.”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng would not forget the fact that she was being watched; she knew that a battle was in order.</p><p>Semi extreme rank items were extremely powerful after all, especially the semi extreme rank attacking weapons. Wanting to make the existing power not reject one’s own, a certain amount of time to get used to each other was definitely necessary. Of course, it would not need that long either, and it all depended on each warrior’s situation.</p><p>Obviously, these aggressive looking gloves quite liked Murong Qingcheng’s demon power. Besides the fightback in the beginning, it was rather cooperative.</p><p>Pap! Pap!</p><p>At that moment, the footsteps arrived right in front of the door, and soon, a human shadow appeared outside the door. It was a person in gold robes and gold head accessories. He had an aggressive aura as if it was about to solidify.</p><p>It was Xia Houzun indeed!</p><p>Seeing that it was Xia Houzun, Murong Qingcheng’s expression changed a little. If it were people like Lin Tian, then she did not have to worry about anything. Even if it were Beiming Hui, she still had the confidence to last for a while before leaving safely. But, Xia Houzun was not someone like that. He was one of the top five young warriors, with an extreme power and an unpredictable finger art that no one seemed to be able to compete with.</p><p>“Oh! Such evil looking gloves.”</p><p>He was a bit disappointed. What he was looking for were semi extreme rank defensive items, since he had already gotten a set of gloves.</p><p>“Put it down and you can leave.”</p><p>But obviously, he had not gotten to the level where he would just say no to semi extreme rank items. Even if he did not use it himself, he could still use it as a part of his wealth. Sometimes, he could even use it to exchange for things that he really wanted. Plus, by the looks of it, these gloves was better than the ones he already had. Also, the evil qi it came with was making it very different.</p><p>“Sorry, but I really like this set of gloves.” She slowly put on the gloves, which seemed a bit bigger before but were able to adjust its size according to the user. The gloves themselves did not have much weight to; instead, she felt like that she could control their power easily.</p><p>Xia Houzun chuckled a little. If Yan Fengfeng had the guts to fight with him, it would make more sense, since her speed was something even he could not compete with. Plus, her real form was a blue phoenix, which meant that even though he could oppress her, it would be impossible to kill her even if he wanted to. So, Murong Qingcheng’s words and behavior had surprised him a little.</p><p>“Hehe, you really liked these gloves, huh? Alright. How about this? If you give up on that Ye Chen and be with me, then I will promise to give you whatever you want.”</p><p>His attitude had changed completely.</p><p>She tightened her fists and said while looking directly in his eyes, “Leave him for you? Why? Emotions aside, judging on power and talent, I do not think you have many advantages.”</p><p>Hearing her, Xia Houzun felt like he had just heard the most laughable joke in the world, “This is the first time I have been looked down, especially by a woman. But just with this, I will kill him now.” Xia Houzun had never taken Ye Chen seriously, including Du Gujue and the rest of them. To him, they were all nothing but talks by other stupid people who did not know what they were talking about.</p><p>“But before that, I will keep this set of gloves for you!”</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>A beam of gold light flashed as Xia Houzun approached Murong Qingcheng, pointing out his finger at her.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>A pair of massive black bat wings expanded and she flew out, almost touching that incoming finger power.</p><p>“Do you think you can outrun me?”</p><p>Mid-air, Xia Houzun turned around his body while performing his Star Nuclear Finger Art. That endless pulling power affected Murong Qingcheng, dragging her closer and closer to him.</p><p>“Darkness Sky!”</p><p>She looked the same as she waved her right hand. Those gloves flashed once, and a black shield appeared suddenly in front of her.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The black barrier twisted drastically before shattering right before her; but, she managed to have the time to move to the door.</p><p>“Huh? The dark profound!”</p><p>Xia Houzun was a bit surprised. Star Nuclear Finger Attack was his killing attack, getting him what he wanted each time. Even if it were Yan Fengfeng who had a crazily powerful beast yuan, she had a hard time because of it. But, Murong Qingcheng’s dark profound had perfectly blocked out his pulling power. It was only because she had still not trained it perfectly that the pulling power still managed to break through.</p><p>“Interesting!”</p><p>Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!…</p><p>Looking slightly more serious, Xia Houzun shoot out another hundreds of finger power, filling up the whole room. It was so fast that the black barrier had just been set up before being shattered eventually with a loud exploding sound.</p><p>She used the power to fly back out, but a couple of beams tore apart her purple dress, revealing the leather shield inside.</p><p>“You cannot outrun this. Draw Attack!”</p><p>There was rarely anyone who knew that this finger art of Xia Houzun could be used as a defensive martial art as well as a restraining attack. However, it was useless in front of powerful warriors such as Bai Wuxue, so he never really used it before.</p><p>Xia Houzun waved out his left index finger, drawing around in the air. With that, the space around Murong Qingcheng started to vibrate drastically, forming into a patterned blockage.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
